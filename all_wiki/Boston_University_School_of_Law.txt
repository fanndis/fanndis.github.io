'''Boston University School of Law''' ('''BU Law''') is the [[law school]] of [[Boston University]], a private university in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lsac.org/officialguide/2013/lsac_3087.asp |title=Boston University School of Law {{!}} Official Guide<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2014-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331133751/http://lsac.org/officialguide/2013/lsac_3087.asp |archive-date=2014-03-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

BU Law was one of the first law schools in the country to admit students regardless of race or gender. It is the second-oldest law school in [[Massachusetts]], and a charter member of the [[American Bar Association]].  More than 700 students are enrolled in the full-time J.D. degree program and about 350 in the school's five [[LLM degree]] programs.

==History==
The Boston University School of Law was founded in 1872. It was one of the first law schools to admit women and minorities, at a time when most other law schools barred them. In 1881, Lelia Robinson became the first female BU Law graduate. Then, women lawyers were less than half of one percent of the profession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.stanford.edu/library/womenslegalhistory/articles/makinghistory.htm |accessdate=March 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202205307/http://www.law.stanford.edu/library/womenslegalhistory/articles/makinghistory.htm |archive-date=December 2, 2010 }}</ref>  Upon graduation, she successfully lobbied the Massachusetts legislature to permit the admission of women to the state bar, and in 1882, became the first woman admitted to the Massachusetts bar. Her classmate, [[Nathan Abbott]], would later become the founding dean of [[Stanford Law School]]. Another prominent female alumna at the time, [[Alice Stone Blackwell]], would go on to help found the [[League of Women Voters]] and edit the [[Woman's Journal]]. [[Takeo Kikuchi]] (1877), the school's first Japanese graduate, was co-founder and president of [[Tokyo's English Law School]] which grew into [[Chuo University]]. Clara Burrill Bruce (1926) was the first black woman elected editor-in-chief of a [[law review]] (the ''Boston University Law Review'').

BU Law's first homes were 36 Bromfield Street, 18â€“20 [[Beacon Street]] and 10 Ashburton Place.  In 1895, the university's trustees acquired 11 Ashburton Place, which was refurbished and named Isaac Rich Hall in honor of the third founder of Boston University. The dedication speaker was [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] whose historic speech ''The Path of the Law'' was delivered in 1897. Former United States President [[William Howard Taft]] lectured on legal ethics from 1918 until his appointment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1921.<ref>{{cite web|title=BU School of Law Timeline|url=http://www.bu.edu/law/about/timeline.html|publisher=Boston University|accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>

Isaac Rich Hall housed BU Law until 1964. In 1964 BU Law occupied the bottom half of the current building, 765 [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Avenue]] on the Charles River Campus, colloquially known as the "Tower."  BU Law shared the Tower with the School of Education for some years but now occupies the entire building.  The School of Law's legal library, the Fineman & Pappas Law Libraries, occupies three floors in the Law Complex, spanning both the Law Tower and the Redstone Building. The Libraries also include two floors of closed stacks in the basement of the adjacent Mugar Memorial Library, BU's main library.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/law/about/law-libraries/|title=Law Libraries {{!}} School of Law|website=www.bu.edu|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref>

In July 2016, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] announced a new partnership allowing BU Law to serve as headquarters for a $350 million initiative researching and combating antibiotic-resistant diseases.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2016/07/28/hhs-forges-unprecedented-partnership-combat-antimicrobial-resistance.html|title=HHS forges unprecedented partnership to combat antimicrobial resistance|last=Division|first=News|date=2016-07-27|website=HHS.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-11}}</ref> Professor [[Kevin Outterson]], a health law specialist and researcher at BU Law, serves as executive director of the initiative, which is named [[CARB-X]].<ref name=":0" />
