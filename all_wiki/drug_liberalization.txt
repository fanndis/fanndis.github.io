'''Drug liberalization''' is the process of eliminating or reducing [[Prohibition of drugs|drug prohibition]] laws. Variations of drug liberalization include: '''drug legalization''', '''drug relegalization''' and '''drug decriminalization'''.<ref>[https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/committee/371/ille/03evb-e Proceedings of the Special Committee on Illegal Drugs], Senate of Canada, 28 May 2001</ref>

== Policies ==
The 1988 [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] made it mandatory for the signatory countries to "adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law" (art. 3, §&nbsp;1) all the activities related to the production, sale, transport, distribution, etc. of the substances included in the most restricted lists of the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. Criminalization also applies to the "cultivation of opium poppy, coca bush or cannabis plants for the purpose of the production of narcotic drugs". The Convention distinguishes between the intent to traffic and personal consumption, stating that the latter should also be considered a criminal offence, but "subject to the constitutional principles and the basic concepts of [the state’s] legal system" (art. 3, §&nbsp;2).<ref name=reform>[https://www.tni.org/en/paper/drug-policy-reform-practice Drug Policy Reform in Practice: Experiences with alternatives in Europe and the US], Tom Blickman & Martin Jelsma, Transnational Institute, July 2009.</ref>

The [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] (EMCDDA) defines decriminalization as the removal of a conduct or activity from the sphere of criminal law; depenalisation signifying merely a relaxation of the penal sanction exacted by law. Decriminalization usually applies to offences related to drug consumption and may include either the imposition of sanctions of a different kind (administrative) or the abolition of all sanctions; other (noncriminal) laws then regulate the conduct or activity that has been decriminalized. Depenalisation usually consists of personal consumption as well as small-scale trading and generally signifies the elimination or reduction of custodial penalties, while the conduct or activity still remains a criminal offence. The term legalization refers to the removal of all drug-related offences from criminal law: use, possession, cultivation, production, trading, etc.<ref name=reform /><ref name=emcdda>[http://eldd.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_10080_EN_EMCDDATP_01.pdf Illicit drug use in the EU: legislative approaches], EMCDDA thematic papers, Lisbon 2005</ref>

Drug liberalization proponents hold differing reasons to support liberalization, and have differing policy proposals. The two most common positions are '''drug legalization''' (or re-legalization), and '''drug decriminalization'''.

=== Drug legalization ===
Drug legalization calls for a return to the pre-20th century situation in which almost all drugs were legal. This would require ending government-enforced prohibition on the distribution or sale and personal use of specified (or all) currently banned drugs. Proposed ideas range from full legalization which would completely remove all forms of government control, to various forms of regulated legalization, where drugs would be legally available, but under a system of government control which might mean for instance:<ref>[http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blueprint%20download.htm After the War on Drugs: Blueprint for Regulation], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (12 Nov 2009)</ref>
* Mandated labels with dosage and medical warnings.
* Restrictions on advertising.
* Age limitations.
* Restrictions on amount purchased at one time.
* Requirements on the form in which certain drugs would be supplied.
* Ban on sale to intoxicated persons.
* Special user licenses to purchase particular drugs.
* A possible clinical setting for the consumption of some intravenous drugs and/or supervised consumption. 
The regulated legalization system would probably have a range of restrictions for different drugs, depending on their perceived risk, so while some drugs would be sold over the counter in pharmacies or other licensed establishments, drugs with greater risks of harm might only be available for sale on licensed premises where use could be monitored and emergency medical care made available. Examples of drugs with different levels of regulated distribution in most countries include: caffeine (coffee, tea), nicotine (tobacco),<ref>[http://transform-drugs.blogspot.com/2010/02/regulation-saves-lives.html Tobacco regulation: Saving livings vs personal freedom], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (3 Feb 2010)</ref> and ethyl alcohol (beer, wine, spirits).

Full legalization is often proposed by groups such as [[libertarians]] who object to drug laws on moral grounds, while regulated legalization is suggested by groups such as [[Law Enforcement Against Prohibition]] who object to the drug laws on the grounds that they fail to achieve their stated aims and instead greatly worsen the problems associated with use of prohibited drugs, but who acknowledge that there are harms associated with currently prohibited drugs which need to be minimized. Not all proponents of drug re-legalization necessarily share a common ethical framework, and people may adopt this viewpoint for a variety of reasons. In particular, favoring drug legalization does not imply approval of drug use.<ref>[http://transform-drugs.blogspot.com/2009/12/reformers-are-not-pro-drug-mr-costa.html Reformers and not 'pro-drug' Mr Costa], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (7 Dec 2009)</ref><ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/portugal-drug-policy-decriminalization-works-2012-7 Portugal Decriminalized All Drugs Eleven Years Ago And The Results Are Staggering], [[Business Insider]] (17 Jul 2012)</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Boaz|first1=David|title=Let's Quit the Drug War|url=https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/lets-quit-drug-war|website=Cato Institute|access-date=24 April 2018|language=en|date=17 March 1988|quote=This article originally appeared in the New York Times on March 17, 1988}}</ref>

=== Drug decriminalization ===
Drug decriminalization calls for reduced control and penalties compared to existing laws. Proponents of drug decriminalization generally support the use of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] or other punishments to replace [[prison]] terms, and often propose systems whereby illegal drug users who are caught would be fined, but would not receive a permanent criminal record as a result. A central feature of drug decriminalization is the concept of [[harm reduction]].

Drug decriminalization is in some ways an intermediate between prohibition and legalization, and has been criticized as being "the worst of both worlds", in that drug sales would still be illegal, thus perpetuating the problems associated with leaving production and distribution of drugs to the criminal underworld, while also failing to discourage illegal drug use by removing the criminal penalties that might otherwise cause some people to choose not to use drugs. However, there are many that argue that the decriminalization of possession of drugs would redirect focus of the law enforcement system of any country to put more effort into arresting dealers and big time criminals, instead of arresting minor criminals for mere possession, and thus be more effective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 2001 Portugal began treating use and possession of small quantities of drugs as a public health issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/05/why-hardly-anyone-dies-from-a-drug-overdose-in-portugal/|title=Why hardly anyone dies from a drug overdose in Portugal|last=https://www.facebook.com/chrisingraham|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-22}}</ref> This means that, rather than incarcerating those in possession, they are referred to a treatment program. The drugs are still illegal, the police just handles the situation differently. This also decreases the amount of money the government spends fighting a war on drugs and money spent keeping drug users incarcerated.
"As noted by the EMCDDA, across Europe in the last decades, there has been a movement toward "an approach that distinguishes between the drug trafﬁcker, who is viewed as a criminal, and the drug user, who is seen more as a sick person who is in need of treatment" (EMCDDA 2008, 22).6 A number of Latin American countries have similarly moved to reduce the penalties associated with drug use and personal possession" (Laqueur, 2015, p.&nbsp;748).
[[Portugal]] is the first country that has decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs, to positive results.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html | work=Time | first=Maia | last=Szalavitz | title=Drugs in Portugal: Did Decriminalization Work? | date=26 April 2009}}</ref> Anyone caught with any type of drug in Portugal, if it is for personal consumption, will not be imprisoned.

== Economics ==
There are numerous economic and social impacts of the criminalization of drugs. Prohibition increases crime (theft, violence, corruption) and drug price and increases potency.<ref>{{Cite web

  }}</ref> In many developing countries the production of drugs offers a way to escape poverty. [[Milton Friedman]] estimated that over 10,000 deaths a year in the US are caused by the criminalization of drugs, and if drugs were to be made legal innocent victims such as those shot down in drive by shootings, would cease or decrease. The economic inefficiency and ineffectiveness of such government intervention in preventing drug trade has been fiercely criticised by drug-liberty advocates. The [[War on Drugs]] of the United States, that provoked legislation within several other Western governments, has also garnered criticism for these reasons.

=== Prices and consumption ===
Much of the debate surrounding the economics of drug legalization centers on the shape of the demand curve for illegal drugs and the sensitivity of consumers to changes in the prices of illegal drugs.<ref name=Clark>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Andrew E.|title=The Economics of Drug Legalization|url=http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/clark-andrew/ecleg.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809060914/http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/clark-andrew/ecleg.pdf|url-status=live|archive-date=2011-08-09|access-date=2016-12-10}}</ref> Proponents of drug legalization often assume that the quantity of addictive drugs consumed is unresponsive to changes in price; however, studies into addictive, but legal, substances like alcohol and cigarettes, have shown that consumption can be quite responsive to changes in prices.<ref name=Grossman>{{cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Michael|author2=Frank J. Chaloupka|title=The Demand for Cocaine by Young Adults: a Rational Addiction Approach|journal=Journal of Health Economics|year=1998|volume=17|issue=4|pages=428|doi=10.1016/s0167-6296(97)00046-5|pmid=10180926|s2cid=14660848|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w5713.pdf}}</ref> In the same study, economists Michael Grossman and Frank J. Chaloupka estimated that a 10% reduction in the price of cocaine would lead to a 14% increase in the frequency of cocaine use.<ref name="Grossman" />{{rp|459}} This increase indicates that consumers are responsive to price changes in the cocaine market. There is also evidence that in the long run, consumers are much more responsive to price changes than in the short run,<ref name="Grossman" />{{rp|454}} but other studies have led to a wide range of conclusions.<ref name=Levitt>{{cite journal|last=Kuiemko|first=Ilyana|author2=Steven D. Levitt|title=Empirical Analysis of Imprisoning Drug Offenders|journal=Journal of Public Economics|year=2003|issue=9–10|volume=88|doi=10.1016/s0047-2727(03)00020-3|pages=2043–2066|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.6010}}</ref>{{rp|2043}}

Considering that legalization would likely lead to an increase in the supply of drugs, the standard economic model predicts that the quantity of drugs consumed would rise and the prices would fall.<ref name="Grossman" />{{rp|428}} However, Andrew E. Clark, an economist who has studied the effects of drug legalization, suggests that a [[specific tax]], or [[sin tax]], would counteract the increase in consumption.<ref name="Clark" />{{rp|3}}

=== Associated costs ===
Proponents of drug prohibition argue that many negative [[externalities]], or third party costs, are associated with the consumption of illegal drugs.,<ref name="Levitt" />{{rp|2043}}<ref name=Miron>{{cite journal|last=Miron|first=Jeffrey A.|author2=Jeffrey Zwiebel|title=The Economic Case Against Drug Prohibition|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|year=1995|volume=9|issue=4|doi=10.1257/jep.9.4.175|pages=175–192|doi-access=free}}</ref>{{rp|183}} Externalities like violence, environmental effects on neighborhoods, increased health risks and, increased healthcare costs are often associated with the illegal drug market.<ref name="Clark" />{{rp|3}} Opponents of prohibition argue that many of those externalities are created by current drug policies. They believe that much of the violence associated with drug trade is due to the illegal nature of drug trade, where there is no mediating authority to solve disputes peacefully and legally.<ref name="Clark" />{{rp|3}}<ref name="Miron" />{{rp|177}} The illegal nature of the market also affects the health of consumers by making it difficult to acquire syringes, which often leads to needle sharing.<ref name="Miron" />{{rp|180–181}}
Prominent economist [[Milton Friedman]] argues that prohibition of drugs creates many negative externalities like increased incarceration rates, the undertreatment of chronic pain, corruption, disproportional imprisonment of African Americans, compounding harm to users, the destruction of inner cities and harm to foreign countries.<ref name=Friedman>{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Milton|title=There's No Justice in the War on Drugs|newspaper=New York Times|date=1/11/1998}}</ref> Proponents of legalization also argue that prohibition decrease the quality of the drugs made, which often leads to more physical harm, like accidental overdoses and poisoning, to the drug users.<ref name="Miron" />{{rp|179}} [[Steven D. Levitt]] and Ilyana Kuziemko point to the over crowding of prisons as another negative side effect of the war on drugs. They believe that by sending such a large number of drug offenders to prison, the war on drugs has reduced the prison space available for other offenders. This increased incarceration rate not only costs tax payers more to maintain, it could possibly increase crime by crowding violent offenders out of prison cells and replacing them with drug offenders.<ref name="Levitt" />{{rp|2043}}

=== Direct costs ===
A [[Harvard University|Harvard]] economist, [[Jeffrey Miron]], estimated that ending the war on drugs would inject 76.8 billion dollars into the US economy in 2010 alone.<ref name=Bernd>{{cite news|last=Debusmann|first=Bernd|title=Einstein, Insanity and the War on Drugs|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2008/12/03/einstein-insanity-and-the-war-on-drugs/|access-date=4/1/2012|newspaper=Reuter|date=12/3/08}}</ref> He estimates that the government would save $41.3 billion for law enforcement and the government would gain up to $46.7 billion in tax revenue.<ref name=Cato>{{cite journal|last=Miron|first=Jeffrey A.|author2=Katherine Waldock|title=The Budgetary Impact of Ending Drug Prohibition|journal=The Cato Institute|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/budgetary-impact-ending-drug-prohibition|date=2010-09-27}}</ref>

Since the war on drugs began under the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|administration]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], the federal drug-fighting budget has increased from $100 million in 1970 to $15.1 billion in 2010, with a total cost estimated near 1 trillion dollars over 40 years. In the same time period an estimated 37 million nonviolent drug offenders have been incarcerated. $121 billion was spent to arrest these offenders and $450 billion to incarcerate them.<ref name=AP>{{cite news|last=The Associated Press|title=After 40 years, $1 trillion, US War on Drugs Has Failed to Meet Any of its Goals|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/05/13/ap-impact-years-trillion-war-drugs-failed-meet-goals/|access-date=4/1/2012|newspaper=The Associated Press|date=5/13/2010}}</ref>

=== Size of the illegal drug market ===
According to 2013 data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and European crime-fighting agency Europol, the annual global drugs trade is worth around $435 billion a year, with the annual cocaine trade worth $84 billion of that amount.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.cnbc.com/id/100957882|title = CNBC|date = 2013-08-13|access-date = 11/10/15|website = Global drugs trade 'as strong as ever' as fight fails|publisher = CNBC|last = Ellyatt|first = Holly}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://irc.princeton.edu/pmunc/docs/UNODC%20BG%20formatted.pdf|title = UN Office on Drugs and Crime|access-date = 11/10/2015|publisher = Princeton|last = Liebman|first = Jonathan}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Drug bottle containing cannabis.jpg|thumb|right|Prior to prohibition, cannabis was available freely in a variety of forms]]
The cultivation, use and trade of [[psychoactive]] and other drugs has occurred since the dawn of civilization. In the 20th century, the United States government led a major renewed surge in drug prohibition called the "[[War on Drugs]]." It was only in the 20th century that Britain and the United States outlawed cannabis. The British had gone to war with China in the 19th Century in what became known as the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s to protect their valuable trade in narcotics.

Motivations claimed by supporters of drug prohibition laws across various societies and eras have included [[religious observance]], allegations of violence by [[racial minorities]], and [[public health]] concerns. Those who are not proponents of anti-drug legislation characterize these motivations as [[religious intolerance]], [[racism]], and [[public healthism]].

Various proponents of drug liberalization wish to repeal these laws for [[Arguments for and against drug prohibition|reasons]] ranging from [[individual rights]]-based defenses of [[liberty]], to [[consequentialist]] arguments against the economic and social outcomes of drug prohibition. Starting in the 20th century, large organized movements to overturn existing drug laws formed around the world. The most vocal of these groups exist in [[liberal democracies]], and typically attract [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] supporters, although drug liberalization itself is a non-partisan issue and may be supported by adherents of any ideology.

The campaign against [[alcohol prohibition]] culminated in the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] repealing prohibition on 5 December 1933, as well as liberalization in [[Canada]], and some but not all of the other countries that enforced prohibition. However, many laws controlling the use of alcohol continue to exist even in these countries.

Current proponents of drug liberalization seek the repeal or softening of drug prohibition laws, most commonly [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] but also including other [[controlled substance]]s such as [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[opiate]]s, [[stimulant]]s, [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelics]], [[dissociative]]s, [[prescription drug]]s, and others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Policies by country ==

===Asia===

====Thailand====
Although [[Thailand]] has a strict [[drug policy]], in May 2018, the Cabinet approved draft legislation that allows for more research into the effects of marijuana on people. Thus, the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) will soon begin clinical trials of marijuana as a preliminary step in the production of drugs from this plant. These medical studies are considered exciting, new landmarks in the history of Thailand, because since 1979, marijuana is a drug and its use, storage and manufacture is illegal.<ref>https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1546686/medical-marijuana-trials-to-start-soon</ref>

On 9 November 2018, the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] officially proposed to allow licensed medical use of marijuana, thereby legalizing what was previously considered a dangerous drug.

The National Assembly on Friday submitted its amendments to the Ministry of Health, which would place marijuana and vegetable kratom in the category allowing their licensed possession and distribution in regulated conditions. The ministry reviewed the amendments before sending them to the cabinet, which returned it to the National Assembly for a final vote. This process was completed on 25 December 2018.<ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrebourque/2018/12/28/thailands-legalization-of-medical-cannabis-proves-one-very-important-thing/#6aeb29314b3d</ref> Thus, Thailand became the first Asian country to legalize medical [[cannabis]].<ref>https://420intel.com/articles/2018/11/09/where-do-thai-lawmakers-stand-legalizing-medical-marijuana</ref> It is worth noting that the proposed changes will not allow recreational use of drugs. These actions were taken because of the growing interest in the use of marijuana and its components for the treatment of certain diseases.

Supporters of legalization argue that the legal market for marijuana in Thailand could increase to $5 billion by 2024.<ref>https://www.thestrategist.media/Thailand-Malaysia-to-legalize-medical-cannabis_a3309.html</ref>

==== Czech Republic ====
In the Czech Republic, until 31 December 1998 only drug possession "''for other person''" (i.e. intent to sell) was criminal (apart from production, importation, exportation, offering or mediation, which was and remains criminal) while possession for personal use remained legal.<ref name="Cz expl rep" />

On 1 January 1999, an amendment of the Criminal Code, which was necessitated in order to align the Czech drug rules with the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], became effective, criminalizing possession of "''amount larger than small''" also for personal use (Art. 187a of the Criminal Code) while possession of small amounts for personal use became a misdemeanor.<ref name="Cz expl rep">{{Citation

Dosavadní beztrestnost totiž eliminuje v řadě případů možnost postihu dealerů a distributorů drog.''"</ref>

The judicial practice came to the conclusion that the "''amount larger than small''" must be five to ten times larger (depending on drug) than a usual single dose of an average consumer.<ref>{{Citation

On 14 December 2009, the [[Government of the Czech Republic]] adopted Regulation No. 467/2009 Coll., that took effect on 1 January 2010, and specified what "''amount larger than small''" under the Criminal Code meant, effectively taking over the amounts that were already established by the previous judicial practice. According to the regulation, a person could possess up to 15&nbsp;grams of marijuana or 1.5&nbsp;grams of heroin without facing criminal charges. These amounts were higher (often many times) than in any other European country, possibly making the Czech Republic the most liberal country in the [[European Union]] when it comes to drug liberalization, apart from Portugal.<ref>[http://www.praguepost.com/news/3194-new-drug-guidelines-are-europes-most-liberal.html New drug guidelines are Europe's most liberal], The Prague Post, 23 December 2009</ref> Czech Republic has also the highest prevalence of last years cannabis use among young adults (15–34) (18.5% in 2012) among the 30 counties reporting to the [[EMCDDA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/data/2014|title=EMCDDA – European Drug Report 2014: Data and statistics — the drug situation in Europe|work=europa.eu}}</ref>

In 2013, a District Court in [[Liberec]] was deciding a case of a person that was accused of criminal possession for having 3.25 grams of methamphetamine (1.9 grams of straight methamphetamine base), well over the Regulation's limit of 2 grams. The court considered that basing a decision on mere Regulation would be unconstitutional and in breach of Article 39 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms|Czech Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms]] which states that "''only a law may designate which acts constitute a crime and what penalties, or other detriments to rights or property, may be imposed for committing them''" and proposed to the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]] to abolish the Regulation. In line with the District Courts' argument, the Constitutional Court abolished the Regulation effective from 23 August 2013, noting that the "''amount larger than small''" within the meaning of the Criminal Code may be designated only by the means of an Act of Parliament, and not a Governmental Regulation. Moreover, the Constitutional Court further noted that the Regulation merely took over already existing judicial practice of interpretation of what constitutes "''amount larger than small''" and thus its abolishment will not really change the criminality of drug possession in the country.<ref name="concourt">{{Citation

Sale of any amount (not purchase) remains a criminal act. Possession of "''amount larger than a small''" of marijuana can result in a jail sentence of up to one year. For other illicit drugs, the sentence is up to two years.

Following a contentious debate France opened its first supervised injection centre on 11 October 2016.

==== Germany ====
{{See also|Drug policy of Germany|Legality of cannabis by country#.C2.A0Germany}}
In 1994 the [[Bundesverfassungsgericht|Federal Constitutional Court]] ruled that drug addiction was not a crime, nor was the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use. In 2000 the German narcotic law ("BtmG") was changed to allow for supervised drug injection rooms. In 2002, a pilot study was started in seven German cities to evaluate the effects of [[heroin-assisted treatment]] on addicts, compared to methadone-assisted treatment. The positive results of the study led to the inclusion of heroin-assisted treatment into the services of the mandatory health insurance in 2009. On 4 May 2016 the [[Cabinet of Germany]] decided to approve the measure for legal cannabis for seriously ill patients who have consulted with a doctor and "have no therapeutic alternative".

==== Netherlands ====
{{See also|Drug policy of the Netherlands}}

The drug policy of the [[Netherlands]] is based on 2 principles:

# Drug use is a [[public health]] issue, not a [[criminal]] matter
# A distinction between [[drug harmfulness|hard and soft drugs]] exists

Cannabis remains a controlled substance in the Netherlands and both possession and production for personal use are still [[misdemeanor]]s, punishable by fine. [[Cannabis coffee shop]]s are also illegal according to the statutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugsweb.nl/drugsweb153.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212055950/http://www.drugsweb.nl/drugsweb153.asp|title=Landelijke wetgeving|archive-date=12 December 2004}}</ref>

However, a policy of non-enforcement has led to a situation where reliance upon non-enforcement has become common, and because of this the courts have ruled against the government when individual cases were prosecuted.

==== Norway ====
On 14 June 2010, the Stoltenberg commission recommended implementing heroin assisted treatment and expanding harm reduction measures.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.encod.org/info/NORWEGIAN-COMMISSION-RECOMMENDS.html |title=ENCOD.org: Norwegian commission recommends drug policy reform |access-date=25 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924000721/http://www.encod.org/info/NORWEGIAN-COMMISSION-RECOMMENDS.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 18 June 2010, [[Knut Storberget]], [[Minister of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Minister of Justice and the Police]] announced that the ministry was working on new drug policy involving decriminalization by the Portugal model, which was to be introduced to parliament before the next general election.<ref>http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/06/18/nyheter/knut_storberget/narkotika/narkotikapolitikk/innenriks/12188316/ Dagbladet</ref> However, Storberget later changed his statements, saying the decriminalization debate is "for academics", instead calling for coerced treatment.<ref>http://www.abcnyheter.no/borger/101228/justisministrenes-nei-til-avkriminalisering ABC Nyheter</ref> In early March 2013, minister of health and care services [[Jonas Gahr Støre]] proposed to decriminalize the inhalation of heroin by 2014 as a measure to decrease drug overdoses.<ref name=Dagsavis>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/samfunn/store-vil-gjore-det-l-ovlig-a-royke-heroin/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504111356/http://www.dagsavisen.no/samfunn/store-vil-gjore-det-l-ovlig-a-royke-heroin/|title=Støre vil gjøre det lovlig å røyke heroin|archive-date=4 May 2013}}</ref> In 2011 there were 294 fatal overdoses, in comparison to only 170 traffic related deaths.<ref name=Dagsavis /> 

The country is currently preparing a massive policy change in terms of how to deal with drug use and drug possession for personal use. The reform titled "From punishment to help" was approved by the Norwegian government in 2017 and is now in the final phase of approval by the parliament. Changes are expected to be implemented by early 2021. The new reform policy emphasizes that criminalizing drug use has no significant effect on rates of drug consumption and that drug addiction is better dealt with by health care services, hence the slogan "from punishment to help". Instead of fines or prison time, a person caught with a drug quantity for personal use will now be met with an independent panel consisting of social and health care workers that will discuss administrative sanctions or addiction treatment methods. This will hopefully encourage problematic users to seek help rather than fear of prosecution. There is also hope that this will improve the relationship between drug users and law enforcement officers. Opponents of the reform, including the police force and the progress party, fear that drug use will increase once a person is no longer at risk of facing criminal charges.<ref> https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/hod/org/styrer-rad-og-utvalg/rusreformutvalget/id2594880</ref>

Research commissioned by the [[Cato Institute]] and led by [[Glenn Greenwald]] found that in the five years after the start of decriminalization, illegal drug use by teenagers had declined, the rate of [[HIV]] infections among drug users had dropped, deaths related to heroin and similar drugs had been cut by more than half, and the number of people seeking treatment for drug addiction had doubled.<ref name=cato>[http://www.cato.org/pubs/wtpapers/greenwald_whitepaper.pdf Drug Decriminalization in Portugal: Lessons for Creating Fair and Successful Drug Policies], Glenn Greenwald, Cato Institute, April 2009</ref> However, Peter Reuter, a professor of criminology and public policy at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], suggests that the heroin usage rates and related deaths may have been due to the cyclical nature of drug epidemics, but conceded that "decriminalization in Portugal has met its central goal.

====Ukraine====
The use of [[marijuana]] in [[Ukraine]] is not prohibited, but the manufacture, storage, transportation and sale of cannabis and its derivatives are under administrative and criminal liability.<ref>https://korrespondent.net/ukraine/3997959-v-oon-poschytaly-upotrebliavshykh-marykhuanu-ukrayntsev</ref>

Speaking on the legalization of soft drugs in Ukraine has been going on for a long time. In June 2016, the Parliament received a bill on the legalization of marijuana for medical purposes. It dealt with changes to the current act "On narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and precursors" and was registered number 4533.<ref>https://24tv.ua/ru/konoplja_protiv_maka_sostoitsja_li_v_ukraine_legalajz_n1053052</ref> The document must examine the relevant committee, and then submit it to the government. It was expected that this would happen in the fall of 2016, but the bill was not considered.

In October 2018, a petition appeared on the website of electronic appeals to the President of Ukraine asking for the legalization of marijuana.<ref>https://dnepr.info/news/v-ukraine-podnyali-temu-legalizatsii-narkotikov</ref>

In October 2018, the State Service of Ukraine on Drugs and Drug Control issued the first license for the import and re-export of raw materials and products derived from cannabis. The corresponding licenses were obtained by the USA company C21. The company is also in the process of applying for additional licenses, including the cultivation of cannabis.<ref>http://finance.bigmir.net/business/96326-Ykraina-vpervie-vidala-licenziu-na-proizvodstvo-prodyktov-iz-marihyani</ref>

=== Latin America ===
{{Main|Latin American drug legalization}}

In the late 2000s and early 2010s, advocacy for drug legalization has increased in [[Latin America]]. Spearheading the movement [[Uruguay]]an government announced in 2012 plans to legalize state-controlled sales of marijuana in order to fight drug-related crimes. Some countries in this region have already advanced towards depenalization of personal consumption.

==== Argentina ====
In August 2009, the [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Argentine supreme court]] declared in a landmark ruling that it was unconstitutional to prosecute citizens for having drugs for their personal use – "adults should be free to make lifestyle decisions without the intervention of the state".<ref name="N000645">{{cite news | first=Simon | last=Jenkins | title= The war on drugs is immoral idiocy.

==== Brazil ====
In 2002 and 2006, Brazil went through legislative changes, resulting in a partial decriminalization of possession for personal use. Prison sentences no longer applied and were replaced by educational measures and community services.<ref>[http://www.druglawreform.info/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&view=category&cid=101&Itemid=14&lang=en Drug Law Reform in Latin America] (accessed 14 September 2010)</ref> However, the 2006 law does not provide objective means to distinguish between users or traffickers. A disparity exists between the decriminalization of drug use and the increased penalization of selling drugs, punishable with a maximum prison sentences of 5 years for the sale of very minor quantities of drugs. Most of those incarcerated for drug trafficking are offenders caught selling small quantities of drugs, among them drug users who sell drugs to finance their drug habits. Since 2006, there's been a long debate whether the anti-drug law goes against the Constitution and principle of personal freedom. In 2009,<ref>[http://www.ocregister.com/articles/possession-678463-use-personal.html=en Brazil Supreme Court debates decriminalization of drugs], The Orange Conty Register, 19 August 2015</ref> the Supreme Federal Court re-opened to vote if the law is Constitutional, or if it goes against the Constitution specifically against personal Freedom of choice. Since each Minister inside the tribunal can take a personal time to evaluate the law, the voting can take years. In fact, the voting was re-opened in 2015, 3 ministers voted in favor, and then the law was again paused by another minister.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120801044316/http://www.druglawreform.info/index.php?fid=45&cid=574&ord=1&task=weblink&option=com_flexicontent&Itemid=37&lang=en Too many in jail for drugs offenses in Brazil], Comunidad segura, 13 August 2009</ref>

==== Honduras ====
On 22 February 2008, [[Honduras]] President [[Manuel Zelaya]], called on the United States to legalize drugs, in order, he said, to prevent the majority of violent murders occurring in Honduras. Honduras is used by [[cocaine]] smugglers as a transiting point between [[Colombia]] and the US. Honduras, with a population of 7 million suffers an average of 8–10 murders a day, with an estimated 70% being as a result of this international drug trade. The same problem is occurring in [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Mexico]], according to Zelaya.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080226143644/http://www.laprensahn.com/index.php/ediciones/2008/02/23/zelaya_sugiere_a_eua_legalizar_drogas Zelaya sugiere a EUA legalizar drogas]. laprensahn.com (23 February 2008)</ref>

==== Mexico ====
In April 2009, the Mexican Congress approved changes in the General Health Law that decriminalized the possession of illegal drugs for immediate consumption and personal use allowing a person to possess up to 5&nbsp;g of marijuana or 500&nbsp;mg of cocaine. The only restriction is that people in possession of drugs should not be within a 300-meter radius of schools, police departments, or correctional facilities. Opium, heroin, LSD, and other synthetic drugs were also decriminalized, it will not be considered as a crime as long as the dose does not exceed the limit established in the General Health Law.<ref>[http://www.elpensador.com.mx/2009/10/17/Ley-de-Narcomenudeo/ Ley de Narcomenudeo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130224127/http://www.elpensador.com.mx/2009/10/17/Ley-de-Narcomenudeo/ |date=30 November 2010 }}, ''El Pensador'' {{in lang|es}}, 17 October 2009</ref> Many question this, as cocaine is as much synthesised as heroin, both are produced as extracts from plants. The law establishes very low amount thresholds and strictly defines personal dosage.

==== Uruguay ====
{{Main|Legality of cannabis in Uruguay}}
Uruguay is one of few countries that never criminalized the possession of drugs for personal use. Since 1974, the law establishes no quantity limits, leaving it to the judge's discretion to determine whether the intent was personal use. Once it is determined by the judge that the amount in possession was meant for personal use, there are no sanctions.<ref>[http://www.druglawreform.info/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&view=category&cid=108&Itemid=21&lang=en Drug Law Reform in Latin America], (accessed 14 September 2010)</ref>

In June 2012, the Uruguayan government announced plans to legalize state-controlled sales of marijuana in order to fight drug-related crimes. The government also stated that they will ask global leaders to do the same.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18529993 Uruguay government aims to legalise marijuana]. ''[[BBC]]''. Retrieved 21 June 2012.</ref>

On 31 July 2013, the Uruguayan House of Representatives approved a bill to legalize the production, distribution, sale, and consumption of marijuana by a vote of 50 to 46. The bill then passed the Senate, where the left-leaning majority coalition, the [[Broad Front (Uruguay)|Broad Front]], held a comfortable majority. The bill was approved by the Senate by 16 to 13 on 10-December-2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/12/11/uruguay-makes-history-by-legalising-entire-marijuana-market/|title=Uruguay makes history by legalising entire marijuana market|work=euronews}}</ref> The bill was presented to the President [[José Mujica]], also of the Broad Front coalition, who has supported legalization since June 2012. Relating this vote to the 2012 legalization of marijuana by the U.S. states Colorado and Washington, John Walsh, drug policy expert of the [[Washington Office on Latin America]], stated that "Uruguay's timing is right.

Throughout the United States, various people and groups have been pushing for the legalization of marijuana for medical reasons. Organizations such as [[NORML]] and the [[Marijuana Policy Project]] work to decriminalize possession, use, cultivation, and sale of marijuana by adults, even beyond medical uses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=5059|title=NORML Policy on Personal Use|access-date=26 August 2008 |publisher=NORML|date=3 October 2004}}</ref> In 1996, 56% of California voters voted for [[Proposition 215|California Proposition 215]], legalizing the growing and use of marijuana for medical purposes. This created significant legal and policy tensions between federal and state governments. Since then, 20 more states and the District of Columbia have legalized and regulated medical marijuana. State laws in conflict with federal law about cannabis remain valid, and prevent state level prosecution, despite cannabis being illegal under federal law (see [[Gonzales v. Raich]]).

On 6 November 2012, Colorado and Washington state legalized possession of small amounts of marijuana for private recreational use, and created a process for writing rules for legal growing and commercial distribution of marijuana within each state.<ref>{{cite news|title=Legalization of Marijuana in Washington and Colorado|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/07/us-usa-marijuana-legalization-idUSBRE8A602D20121107|publisher=reuters|access-date=10 January 2013|date=7 November 2012}}</ref>

The 2014 Midterms saw voters in Oregon, Alaska, and Washington, D.C. vote to legalize marijuana for recreational use.

In 2016, [[Adult Use of Marijuana Act|California Proposition 64]] was passed, legalizing private, recreational use of marijuana for those age 21 or older in the state of California.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/en/propositions/64/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220211718/http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/en/propositions/64/ |archive-date=20 February 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Following the 2018 midterm ballot, Michigan legalized the recreational use of marijuana in private.

In 2019, Illinois passed the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, making Illinois the first state to legalize the recreational use by an act of the state legislature. This took affect as of January 1, 2020.

{{further|Cannabis in Australia|Illicit drug use in Australia}}In 2016 Australia legalised medicinal cannabis on a federal level.

Since 1985, the Federal Government has run a declared "War on Drugs" and while initially Australia led the world in '[[Injecting room|harm-minimization]]' approach, they have since lagged. 

Australia has a number of political parties that focus on cannabis reform, The [[Help End Marijuana Prohibition Party|(HEMP) Help End Marijuana Prohibition Party]] was founded in 1993 and registered by the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] in 2000. The [[Legalise Cannabis Queensland|Legalise Cannabis Queensland Party]] was established in 2020.

A number of Australian and international groups have promoted reform in regard to 21st-century Australian drug policy. Organisations such as Australian Parliamentary Group on Drug Law Reform, Responsible Choice, the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, [[Norml]] Australia, [[Law Enforcement Against Prohibition]] (LEAP) Australia and Drug Law Reform Australia advocate for drug law reform without the benefit of government funding. The membership of some of these organisations is diverse and consists of the general public, social workers, lawyers and doctors, and the [[Global Commission on Drug Policy]] has been a formative influence on a number of these organisations.

In 1994 the [[Australian National Task Force on Cannabis]] formed under the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy noteded that the social harm of cannabis prohibition is greater than the harm from cannabis itself,<ref name="Booth20052">{{cite book|author=Martin Booth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O7AoY6ljSygC&pg=PA391|title=Cannabis: A History|date=June 2005|publisher=Picador|isbn=978-0-312-42494-7|pages=391–}}</ref> total prohibition policies have been unsuccessful in reducing drug use and have caused significant social harm, as well as higher law enforcement costs, the use of cannabis is widespread in Australia and that its adverse health effects are modest and only affect a minority of users.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Australian task force reported in 1994 that cannabis prohibition causes “significant social harm”|url=https://www.ponderingpot.com.au/national/australian-task-force-reported-in-1994-that-cannabis-prohibition-causes-significant-social-harm/|website=Pondering Pot}}</ref>

In 2019 The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) and St Vincent Health Australia called on the NSW Government to publicly release the findings of the Special Commission of Inquiry into the Drug ‘Ice, saying there was "no excuse" for the delay. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Doctor's Urge Immediate Release of 'Ice' Inquiry Report|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/no-excuse-doctors-urge-immediate-release-of-ice-inquiry-report-20200216-p5418b.html|website=Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>The report was the culmination of months of evidence from health and judicial experts, as well as families and communities affected by  amphetamine-type substances across NSW. The report made 109 recommendations aimed to strengthen the NSW Governments response regarding amphetamine-based drugs such as crystal meth or ice. Major recommendations included more supervised drug use rooms, a prison needle and syringe exchange program, state-wide clinically supervised substance testing, including mobile pill testing at festivals, decriminalisation of drugs for personal use, a cease to the use of drug detection dogs at music festivals and to limit the use of strip searches. The report, also called for the NSW Government to adopt a comprehensive Drug and Alcohol policy, with the last drug and Alcohol policy expiring over a decade ago. The reports commissioner said the state's approach to drug use was profoundly flawed and said reform would require "political leadership and courage", "Criminalising use and possession encourages us to stigmatise people who use drugs as the authors of their own misfortunate," Mr Howard said current laws "allow us tacit permission to turn a blind eye to the factors driving most problematic drug use" including childhood abuse, domestic violence and mental illness.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ice Inquiry Findings|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-27/ice-inquiry-findings-decriminalisation-pill-testing/12006176|website=Australian Broadcasting Company}}</ref> The NSW government rejected the reports key recommendations, saying it would consider the other remaining recommendations.

In the [[Australian Capital Territory]], after a bill was passed on 25 September 2019, new laws came into effect on 31 January 2020 which allowed for possession of up to 50 grams of dry material, 150 grams of wet material, and cultivation of 2 plants per individual up to 4 plants per household, effectively legalising the possession and growing of cannabis in the ACT. However the sale and supply of cannabis and cannabis seeds is still illegal, so the effects of the laws are limited and the laws also contradict federal laws. It is also still illegal to smoke or use cannabis in a public place, expose a child or young person to cannabis smoke, store cannabis where children can reach it, grow cannabis using hydroponics or artificial cultivation, grow plants where they can be accessed by the public, share or give cannabis as a gift to another person, to drive with any cannabis in your system, or for people aged under 18 to grow, possess, or use cannabis.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Treasury|first=ACT Government; PositionTitle=Director; SectionName=Corporate Management; Corporate=Chief Minister and|date=19 February 2020|title=Home|url=https://www.act.gov.au/cannabis|website=Cannabis}}</ref>The personal possession and growth of small amounts of cannabis remains prohibited non-medicinal purposes in every other jurisdiction in Australia.

{{See also|Cannabis political parties}}

Many [[political parties]] support, to various degrees, and for various reasons, liberalising drug control laws, from [[liberalism|liberal]] parties to [[far-left]] movements, as well as some pragmatic [[right-wing]] intellectuals.  Drug liberalization is fundamental in the platforms of most [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] parties.

In the UK in March 2016, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] became the first major political party in the country to support the legalisation of cannabis.<ref>[http://www.libdems.org.uk/liberal_democrats_call_for_a_legalised_cannabis_market# Liberal Democrats call for a legalised cannabis market].

There are also numerous single issue [[marijuana parties]] devoted to campaign for the legalisation of cannabis exclusively.

== Ways of achieving drug liberalization ==
Drug liberalization can be attempted by electing politicians and representatives of political parties that are in favour of drug liberalization in order to attempt to implement change via passing [[legislation]] via a majority vote in a country or state's [[legislature]]. If there is not a majority political will within a legislature for any particular form of drug liberalization, change can be attempted through forms of more [[direct democracy|direct democratic]] processes, such as through [[Initiative|initiatives]] and [[Referendum|referendums]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Muller |first= Natalie |date= 7 May 2019 |title= New Zealand to vote on cannabis legalization |url= https://www.dw.com/en/new-zealand-to-vote-on-cannabis-legalization/a-48631917 |work= Deutsche Welle |access-date= 26 February 2020}}</ref> Ballot initiatives to liberalize drug laws have been successful in a number of U.S. states, such as a [[Adult Use of Marijuana Act|2016 Californian ballot initiative]], which was successful in legalizing cannabis in California.<ref>{{cite news |last= Levin |first= Sam |date= 9 November 2016 |title= California, Nevada and Massachusetts vote to legalize recreational marijuana |url= https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/08/state-ballot-initiative-election-results-live-marijuana-death-penalty-healthcare |work= The Guardian |access-date= 26 February 2020}}</ref>
