Corazon Aquino was the most prominent figure of the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]], which ended the [[History of the Philippines (1965-1986)|20-year rule]] of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. She was named ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Time Person of the Year|Woman of the Year]] in 1986. Prior to this, she had not held any elective office.

A self-proclaimed "plain [[homemaker|housewife]]",<ref name=fb>{{cite speech|title=Corazon Aquino Speaks to Fulbrighters|author=Aquino, Corazon|date=October 11, 1996|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.fulbrightalumni.org/olc/pub/FBA/fulbright_prize/aquino_address.html|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}</ref> she was married to [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]], the staunchest critic of President Marcos. She emerged as the leader of the opposition after her husband [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.|was assassinated]] on 21 August 1983 upon returning to the Philippines from exile in the [[United States]]. In late 1985, Marcos called for a [[snap election]], and Aquino ran for president with former senator [[Salvador Laurel]] as her running mate for [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]]. After the [[1986 Philippine presidential election|election]] held on 7 February 1986, the [[Batasang Pambansa]] proclaimed Marcos and his running mate [[Arturo Tolentino]] as the winners; allegations were made of [[electoral fraud]], with Aquino calling for massive [[civil disobedience]] actions. Defections from the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the support of the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|local Catholic hierarchy]] led to the People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos and secured Aquino's accession on 25 February 1986.

As President, Aquino oversaw the promulgation of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]], which limited the powers of the Presidency and re-established the [[bicameral]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]]. Her administration provided a strong emphasis on and concern for [[civil liberties]] and [[human rights]] and on peace talks to resolve the ongoing [[CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion|Communist insurgency]] and [[Islamic insurgency in the Philippines|Islamist secession]] movements. Her economic policies centered on restoring economic health and confidence and focused on creating a market-oriented and socially responsible economy. In 1987, she became the first Filipino to be bestowed with the prestigious [[Prize For Freedom]] Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://liberal-international.org/people/corazon-aquino/ |title=Corazon Aquino |publisher=Liberal International |access-date=27 January 2019}}</ref>

[[1986–90 Philippine coup attempts|Several ''coup'' attempts]] were made against Aquino's government; it also faced various natural calamities until the end of her term in 1992. She was succeeded as president by [[Fidel Ramos]] and returned to civilian life while remaining public about her opinions on political issues. In recognition of her role in the world's most peaceful revolution to attain democracy, she was awarded the prestigious [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] in 1998.

Aquino was diagnosed with [[colorectal cancer]] in 2008; she died on 1 August 2009. Her monuments of peace and democracy were established in the capital [[Manila]] and her home province of [[Tarlac]] after her death. Her son [[Benigno Aquino III]] became President of the Philippines from 30 June 2010 to 30 June 2016. Throughout her life, Aquino was known to be a devout [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]], and was fluent in [[French language|French]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[English language|English]] aside from her native [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]].<ref name="9facts">{{cite web |url=http://www.filipiknow.net/facts-about-cory-aquino/ |title=9 Interesting Facts You May Not Know About Corazon Aquino |website=filipiknow |access-date=23 August 2016}}</ref> She is highly regarded by the international diplomatic community as the ''Mother of Democracy''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Torild Skard|title=Women of Power: Half a Century of Female Presidents and Prime Ministers Worldwide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1N0aBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA169|year=2015|publisher=Policy Press|isbn=978-1-4473-1580-3|pages=169–170}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lo |first=Barnaby |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/filipinos-mourn-mother-of-democracy-cory-aquino/ |title=Filipinos Mourn "Mother of Democracy" Cory Aquino |publisher=CBS News |date=5 August 2009 |access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news-2-15012/filipinos-mourn-the-mother-of-democracy-1-1355068 |title=Filipinos mourn the mother of democracy |newspaper=The Scotsman |access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/15/philippines-people-typhoon-haiyan-disasters-manmade-marcos |title=Philippines' people power has been beset by disasters natural and man-made &#124; Michael White &#124; World news |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 November 2013 |access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/tears-for-mother-of-democracy-20090805-ea3c.html |title=Tears for mother of democracy |newspaper=Smh.com.au |date=6 August 2009 |access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/acxnetwork/acknowledging-the-value-of-women-2ff7615ffc22 |title=Acknowledging the Value of Women: - Access |publisher=Medium |date=6 March 1957 |access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Banggollay |first=Melvin |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/feedback/08/10/09/re-cory-aquino-mother-philippine-democracy |title=RE: CORY AQUINO, Mother of Philippine Democracy &#124; ABS-CBN News |publisher=News.abs-cbn.com |date= |access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Aquino was born '''Maria Corazon Sumulong Cojuangco''' on 25 January 1933 in [[Paniqui, Tarlac|Paniqui]], [[Tarlac]],<ref name="malacanang.gov.ph"/> and was the sixth (of whom two died in infancy) of eight children of [[José Cojuangco]], a former congressman, and Demetria Sumulong, a pharmacist. Her siblings were Pedro, Josephine, Teresita, Jose Jr., and Maria Paz. Both Aquino's parents came from prominent clans. Her father was a prominent Tarlac businessman and politician, and her grandfather, Melecio Cojuangco, was a member of the historic [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]]. Her mother belonged to the Sumulong family of [[Rizal province]] who were also politically influential; [[Juan Sumulong]], a prominent member of the clan, ran against [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]] President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] in 1941.<ref name="Corazon">{{cite web|url=http://www.coryaquino.ph/index.php/essential/article/4a66ceac-f098-11df-b3cf-001617d76479 |title=Essential Cory Aquino: The Young Cory  |access-date=25 January 2017|publisher=Ninoy & Cory Aquino Foundation }}</ref>

As a young girl, Aquino spent her elementary school days at [[St. Scholastica's College Manila|St. Scholastica's College]] in Manila, where she graduated at the top of her class as valedictorian. She transferred to [[Assumption College San Lorenzo|Assumption Convent]] to pursue high school studies. Afterward, her family went to the United States and she attended the Assumption-run [[Ravenhill Academy]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1949, she graduated from [[Notre Dame School (Manhattan)|Notre Dame Convent School]] in New York. She then pursued her college education in the U.S. graduating from the [[College of Mount Saint Vincent]] in 1953 in New York, with a major in French and minor in mathematics. During her stay in the United States, Aquino volunteered for the campaign of U.S. [[Republican Party in the United States|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Thomas Dewey]] against then [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] during the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 U.S. Presidential Election]].<ref name=" Corazon"/>

After graduating from college, she returned to the Philippines and studied law at [[Far Eastern University]] in 1953.<ref name="9facts"/> She later met [[Benigno Aquino Jr.|Benigno "Ninoy" S. Aquino Jr.]]—son of the late Speaker [[Benigno Aquino Sr.|Benigno S. Aquino Sr.]] and a grandson of General [[Servillano Aquino]]. She discontinued her law education and married Ninoy in Our Lady of Sorrows church in [[Pasay]] on 11 October 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/08/01/14/throwback-how-ninoy-cory-got-engaged |title=Throwback: How Ninoy, Cory got engaged |work=[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]] |date=1 August 2014 |access-date=24 August 2016}}</ref> The couple raised five children: Maria Elena ("Ballsy"; born 1954), Aurora Corazon ("Pinky"; born 1957), [[Benigno Aquino III|Benigno Simeon III]] ("Noynoy"; born 1960), Victoria Elisa ("Viel"; born 1961) and [[Kris Aquino|Kristina Bernadette]] ("Kris"; born 1971).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/37181-ninoy-children-bad-times-good-times |last=Tah |first=B.

Aquino had initially had difficulty adjusting to provincial life when she and her husband moved to [[Concepcion, Tarlac]] in 1955. Aquino found herself bored in Concepcion, and welcomed the opportunity to have dinner with her husband inside the [[Clark Air Base|American military facility at nearby Clark Field]].<ref name=lt>{{cite book|author=Lorna Kalaw-Tirol|title=Public Faces, Private Lives|year=2000|publisher=Anvil Publishing, Inc|location=Pasig City, Philippines|pages=2–23|isbn=971-27-0851-9}}</ref>

Unknown to many, she voluntarily sold some of her prized inheritance to fund the candidacy of her husband. She led a modest existence in a bungalow in suburban Quezon City. A member of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], Aquino's husband Ninoy rose to become the youngest governor in the country and eventually became the youngest senator ever elected to the [[Senate of the Philippines]] in 1967. During her husband's political career, Aquino remained a housewife who helped raise their children and played hostess to her spouse's political allies who would frequent their Quezon City home.<ref name=pi>{{Cite news |author=Pico Iyer |title=Corazon Aquino |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1986.html |work=Time Magazine |date=5 January 1987 |access-date=26 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220000538/http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1986.html |archivedate=20 December 2007  }}</ref> She would decline to join her husband on stage during campaign rallies, preferring instead to stand at the back of the audience and listen to him.<ref name=lt/>

Ninoy Aquino soon emerged as a leading critic of the government of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. He was then touted as a strong candidate for president to succeed Marcos in the 1973 elections. However, Marcos, being barred by the Constitution to seek a third term, declared [[martial law]] on 21 September 1972, and later abolished the existing [[Philippine Commonwealth Constitution|1935 Constitution]], thereby allowing him to remain in office. As a consequence, her husband was among those to be first arrested at the onset of martial law, later being sentenced to death. During his incarceration, Ninoy sought strength from prayer, attending daily [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and saying the [[rosary]] three times a day. As a measure of sacrifice and solidarity with her husband and all other political prisoners, she enjoined her children from attending parties and she also stopped going to the [[beauty salon]] or buying new clothes until a priest advised her and her children to instead live as normal lives as possible.<ref name=lt/>

In 1978, despite her initial opposition, Aquino decided to run in the [[1978 Philippine parliamentary election|1978 Batasang Pambansa elections]]. A reluctant speaker, Corazon Aquino campaigned on behalf of her husband, and for the first time in her life delivered a political speech. In 1980, upon the intervention of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Jimmy Carter]],<ref name=fb/> Marcos allowed Senator Aquino and his family to leave for exile in the United States, where he sought medical treatment.<ref name=campaign>{{cite news|title=Aquino's 'Flesh-to-Flesh Campaign'|author=Branigin, William|work=The Washington Post|date=2 February 1986|page=A1}}</ref> The family settled in [[Boston]], and Aquino would later call the next three years as the happiest days of her marriage and family life. On 21 August 1983, however, Ninoy ended his stay in the United States and returned without his family to the Philippines, only to be assassinated on a staircase leading to the tarmac of the Manila International Airport (now [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] or NAIA), which was later renamed in his honor (see [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.]]). Corazon Aquino returned to the Philippines a few days later and led her husband's funeral procession, in which more than two million people participated.<ref name=fb/>

==1986 presidential campaign==
{{Main|1986 Philippine presidential election}}
Following her husband's assassination in 1983, Aquino became active and visible in various demonstrations and protests held against the Marcos regime. She began to assume the mantle of leadership left by her husband Ninoy and started to become the symbolic figurehead of the anti-Marcos political opposition. In the last week of November 1985, Marcos surprised the nation by announcing on American television that he would hold a snap presidential election in February 1986, in order to dispel and remove doubts against his regime's legitimacy and authority.<ref>{{cite news|author=Milt Freudenheim, Henry Giniger & Richard Levine|title=Marcos Moves Toward A Vote|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/17/weekinreview/the-world-marcos-moves-toward-a-vote.html|work=New York Times|date=17 November 1985|access-date=15 April 2008 }}</ref>

Initially reluctant, Aquino was eventually prevailed upon to heed the people's clamor, after one million signatures urging her to run for president were presented to her. Despite this, [[United Nationalist Democratic Organization|United Opposition (UNIDO)]] leader Salvador Laurel, did not immediately give way to his close friend's widow. Laurel only gave way to Cory after a political deal which was later reneged on by Cory after the election. According to Salvador Laurel's diary, Cory offered to Laurel that he would be her Prime Minister, she would step down in two years, he would name 30 percent of the Cabinet, and that she would appoint the remaining 70 percent after close consultations with him. As an example of the deal recorded by Laurel later being reneged upon, after Aquino succeeded as president, the office of Prime Minister abolished by the new Constitution in October 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://philippinediaryproject.wordpress.com/category/diary-of-salvador-h-laurel/|title=Diary of Salvador H. Laurel - The Philippine Diary Project|website=philippinediaryproject.wordpress.com}}</ref> [[Salvador Laurel]] eventually ran as Cory Aquino's running mate for vice president under the United Opposition (UNIDO) party. With that, the Aquino-Laurel tandem was formally launched to challenge Marcos and finally put an end to his two-decade rule.

In the subsequent political developments and events, given Ninoy's links with the communists,<ref>{{cite news|title=Ninoy linked up with the Left to aid presidential ambition|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/198820/news/specialreports/ninoy-networked-with-everyone-reds-included|newspaper=GMA News|date=18 August 2010}}</ref> Marcos charged that Aquino was being supported by [[Philippine Communist Party|communists]] and agreed to share power with them once elected into power. A political novice, Aquino categorically denied Marcos' charge and even stated that she would not appoint a single communist to her cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|author=Milt Freudenheim & Richard Levine|title=A Marcos Charge Irks Mrs. Aquino|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/weekinreview/the-world-a-marcos-charge-irks-mrs-aquino.html|work=New York Times|date=12 January 1986|access-date=15 April 2008 }}</ref> Running on the offensive, the ailing Marcos also accused Aquino of playing "political football" with the United States with respect to the continued United States military presence in the Philippines at [[Clark Air Base]] and [[Subic Naval Base]].<ref>{{cite news|author=United Press International|title= Marcos Says Rival Trifles With U.S. Bases|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/31/world/around-the-world-marcos-says-rival-trifles-with-us-bases.html|work=New York Times|date=31 December 1985|access-date=15 April 2008 }}</ref> Furthermore, the male strongman derided Aquino's womanhood, by saying that she was "just a woman" whose place was in the bedroom.<ref name=fb/> In response to her opponent's [[sexism|sexist]] remark, and in reference to the fact that the ailing and feeble Marcos was increasingly seen as being largely a front man for his wife, [[Imelda Marcos|Imelda]], Aquino simply remarked that "may the better woman win in this election". Marcos also attacked Aquino's inexperience and warned the country that it would be a disaster if a woman like her with no previous political experience was to be elected president, to which Aquino cleverly and sarcastically responded, admitting that she had "no experience in cheating, lying to the public, stealing government money, and killing political opponents".

The [[snap election]] called by Marcos, which was held on 7 February 1986, was marred by massive electoral fraud, violence, intimidation, coercion, and disenfranchisement of voters. Election Day proved to be bloody as one of Aquino's staunchest allies, former Antique province Governor [[Evelio Javier]], was brutally murdered, allegedly by some of Marcos' supporters in his province. Furthermore, during the counting and tallying of votes conducted by the [[Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC), 30 poll computer technicians walked out to dispute and contest the alleged election-rigging being done in favor of Marcos. However, not known to many, the walkout of computer technicians was led by Linda Kapunan,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1990/10/03/the-final-report-of-the-fact-finding-commission-iv-military-intervention-in-the-philippines-1986-1987/ |title=The Final Report of the Fact-Finding Commission: IV: Military Intervention in the Philippines: 1986 – 1987 &#124; GOVPH |access-date=20 September 2016 }}</ref> wife of Lt Col Eduardo Kapunan, a leader of [[Reform the Armed Forces Movement]], which plotted to attack the [[Malacañang Palace]] and kill Marcos and his family,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/84953-gringo-plot-kill-marcos-almonte-memoir|title=Gringo plotted to kill Marcos – Almonte}}</ref> leading some to believe that the walkout could have been planned with ulterior motives.<ref name="Manila Times">{{cite journal|last=Manila Times|title=Setting the record straight on Edsa 1|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/opinion/columns/virtual-reality-by-tony-lopez/141677/setting-the-record-straight-on-edsa-1.html|access-date=30 August 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610115431/http://manilastandardtoday.com/opinion/columns/virtual-reality-by-tony-lopez/141677/setting-the-record-straight-on-edsa-1.html|archivedate=10 June 2016}}</ref> Despite this, the Batasang Pambansa, which was dominated by Marcos' ruling party and its allies, declared President Marcos as the winner on 15 February 1986. However, [[National Citizens' Movement for Free Elections|NAMFREL]]'s count showed that Corazon Aquino won. In protest to the declaration of the Philippine parliament, Aquino called for a rally dubbed "Tagumpay ng Bayan" (People's Victory Rally) the following day, during which she claimed that she was the real winner in the snap election according to NAMFREL's count and urged Filipinos to boycott the products and services by companies controlled or owned by Marcos' cronies. The rally held at the historic Rizal Park in Luneta, Manila drew a mammoth-sized crowd, which sent a strong signal that Filipinos were quite tired of Marcos' two decades of rule and the lengths to which he would go to perpetuate it. Further, the dubious election results drew sharp reactions from both local quarters and foreign countries. The [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] (CBCP) issued a statement strongly criticizing the conduct of the election which was characterized by violence and fraud. The [[United States Senate]] likewise condemned the election.<ref name=pi/><ref name=bbc>{{cite news|title=Filipino coup leaders tell Marcos to go|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/22/newsid_2519000/2519155.stm|work=BBC|date=22 February 1986|access-date=15 April 2008 }}</ref> Aquino rejected a power-sharing agreement proposed by the American diplomat [[Philip Habib]], who had been sent as an emissary by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] to help defuse the tension.<ref name=bbc/> On 25 February 1986, supporters of Aquino and Marcos celebrated the inauguration of their supported President.

===Accession as President===

On 22 February 1986, disgruntled and reformist military officers led by then-Defense Minister [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] and General [[Fidel V. Ramos]], surprised the entire nation and the international community when they announced their defection from the Marcos government, citing a strong belief that Aquino was the real winner in the contested presidential election. Enrile, Ramos, and the rebel soldiers then set up operations in [[Camp Aguinaldo]], the headquarters of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], and [[Camp Crame]] (headquarters of the [[Philippine Constabulary]]) across [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (EDSA). Cardinal Sin appealed to the public in a broadcast over Church-run [[Radio Veritas]], and millions of Filipinos trooped to the part of [[Epifanio De Los Santos Avenue]] between the two camps to give their support and prayers for the rebels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/579772/timeline-feb-22-1986-day-one |title=Timeline: Feb. 22, 1986, Day One |website=Inquirer.net |date=22 February 2014 |access-date=26 August 2016}}</ref>

At that time, Aquino was meditating in a [[Carmelite]] convent in [[Cebu]], and upon learning of the defection, she urged people along with Cardinal Sin on DZRV or "Radyo Veritas" to rally behind Minister Enrile and General Ramos. Aquino flew back to Manila to prepare for the takeover of the government, and after [[1986 People Power Revolution|three days of peaceful mass protests]], was sworn in as the eleventh President of the Philippines on 25 February 1986.<ref>{{Citation |last=Crisostomo |first=Isabelo T. |title=Cory, Profile of a President: The Historic Rise to Power of Corazon. |publisher=Branden Books |isbn=978-0-8283-1913-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/coryprofileofpre00cris/page/257 257] |url=https://archive.org/details/coryprofileofpre00cris/page/257 |access-date=3 December 2007 |date=1 April 1987 |url-access=registration}}</ref>

==Presidency==
{{Main|Presidency of Corazon Aquino}}
[[File: Cory Aquino during a ceremony honoring US Air Force.jpg|thumb|left|Corazon Aquino during a ceremony honoring the United States Air Force.|alt=]]
The triumph of the peaceful People Power Revolution and the ascension of Corazon Aquino into power signaled the end of authoritarian rule in the Philippines and the dawning of a new era for Filipinos. The relatively peaceful manner by which Aquino came into power drew international acclaim and admiration not only for her but for the Filipino people, as well.

She was the first female president of the country and the only president with no political background. She is also regarded as the first [[List of elected and appointed female heads of state|female president]] in [[Asia]]. One of Aquino's first moves was the creation of the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] (PCGG), which was tasked to go after the Marcos ill-gotten wealth.

Immediately after assuming the presidency, President Aquino issued [[s:Constitution of the Philippines (1973)#1986 Amendment (Proclamation No. 3 and the 1986 Provisional Constitution)|Proclamation No. 3]], which established a revolutionary government. She abolished the [[Sb. 1973|1973 Constitution]] that was in force during [[Martial Law in the Philippines|Martial Law]], and by decree issued the [[provisional constitution|provisional]] [[Constitution of the Philippines#"Freedom Constitution" (1986)|1986 Freedom Constitution]] pending the ratification of a more formal, comprehensive charter. This allowed her to exercise both executive and legislative powers until the ratification of the [[1987 Constitution]] and the restoration of Congress in 1987.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Joaquin G. Bernas]]|title=The Intent of the 1986 Constitution Writers|publisher=Rex Book Store|location=Manila, Philippines|year=1995|pages=2–4}}</ref>

Aquino promulgated two landmarks [[Philippine legal codes|legal codes]], namely, the [[Civil Code of the Philippines#The Family Code of 1987|Family Code of 1987]], which reformed the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] on family relations, and the [[Adminstrative Code of 1917|Administrative Code of 1987]], which reorganized the structure of the [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|executive branch of government]]. Another landmark law that was enacted during her tenure was the 1991 [[Local Government Code]], which devolved national government powers to local government units (LGUs). The new Code enhanced the power of LGUs to enact local taxation measures and assured them of a share in the national revenue. Aquino closed down the Marcos-dominated [[Batasang Pambansa]] to prevent the new Marcos loyalist opposition from undermining her democratic reforms and reorganized the membership of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] to restore its [[Judicial independence|independence]].

In May 1986, the reorganized Supreme Court declared the Aquino government as "not merely a ''[[de facto]]'' government but in fact and law a ''[[de jure]]'' government", whose legitimacy had been affirmed by the community of nations.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Lawyers League v.

To fast-track the restoration of a fully constitutional government and the writing of a new charter, she appointed 48 members of the 1986 Constitutional Commission ("Con-Com"), led by retired activist Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Cecilia Muñoz-Palma]]. The Con-Com completed its final draft in October 1986.<ref>, Bernas, p. 19</ref> On 2 February 1987, the new [[Constitution of the Philippines]], which put a strong emphasis on civil liberties, human rights, and social justice, was overwhelmingly approved by the Filipino people. The ratification of the new Constitution was followed by the election of senators and congress that same year and the holding of local elections in 1988.

====Economic management====
As soon as she assumed the presidency of the Philippines, Aquino moved quickly to tackle the issue of the US$28 billion-foreign debt incurred by her predecessor, which has badly tarnished the international credit standing and economic reputation of the country. After weighing all possible options such as choosing not to pay, Aquino eventually chose to honor all the debts that were previously incurred in order to clear the country's image. Her decision proved to be unpopular but Aquino defended that it was the most practical move. It was crucial for the country at that time to regain the investors' confidence in the Philippine economy. Beginning in 1986, the Aquino administration paid off $4 billion of the country's outstanding debts to regain good international credit ratings and attract the attention of future markets. Although it borrowed an additional $9 billion, increasing the net national debt by $5 billion within six years after the ouster of former President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Manila Plan To Cut Debt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/21/business/manila-plan-to-cut-debt.html|access-date=27 February 2010|date=21 February 1992|journal=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> due to the need to infuse capital and money into the economy, the Aquino administration succeeded in wrangling lower interest rates and longer payment terms in settling the country's debts. From 87.9 percent when it inherited the foreign debt from the Marcos regime, the Cory Aquino administration was able to reduce by 30.1 percent the Philippines' external [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] to 67.8 percent in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://malacanang.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/ThePresidentReport.pdf |title=The Aquino Management of the Presidency |website=malacanang.gov.ph |access-date=25 August 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083529/http://malacanang.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/ThePresidentReport.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016  }}</ref>

Furthermore, recognizing how [[crony capitalism]] weakened the economy due to collusion between government and big business and adhering to the Catholic social principle of [[Subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], President Aquino set out on a course of market liberalization agenda while at the same time emphasizing solidarity, people empowerment and civic engagement to help alleviate poverty in the country. The Aquino administration also sought to bring back fiscal discipline in order as it aimed to trim down the government's budget deficit that ballooned during Marcos' term through [[privatization]] of bad government assets and [[deregulation]] of many vital industries. As president, Aquino sought out to dismantle the [[cartel]]s, [[monopoly|monopolies]] and [[oligopoly|oligopolies]] of important industries that were set up by Marcos cronies during the dark days of Martial Law, particularly in the sugar and coconut industries. By discarding these monopolies and allowing market-led prices and competition, small farmers and producers were given a fair chance to sell their produce and products at a more reasonable, competitive, and profitable price. This, in a way, also helped a lot in improving a lot of farmers who are in dire need of increasing their personal income and earnings. It was also during Aquino's time that vital economic laws such as the Built-Operate-Transfer Law, Foreign Investments Act, and the Consumer Protection and Welfare Act were enacted.

The economy posted a positive growth of 3.4% during her first year in office. But in the aftermath of the [[1989 Philippine coup attempt|1989 coup attempt]] by the rightist [[Reform the Armed Forces Movement]], international confidence in the Philippine economy was seriously damaged. During her presidency, Aquino made fighting inflation one of her priorities, after reeling from skyrocketing prices during the Martial Law years, in which at one point inflation reached 50.3 percent in 1984. Although inflation peaked at 18.1 percent during the 1991 [[Gulf War]], which caused panic among Filipinos who have many family members working in the Middle East, inflation during Aquino's time-averaged 9.6 percent from 1986 to 1992, which was way lower than the average 20.9 percent-inflation rates that were recorded during the last 6 years of the Marcos dictatorship.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Her Term About to End, Aquino 'Hasn't Made Much Difference' to the Poor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/08/world/her-term-about-to-end-aquino-hasn-t-made-much-difference-to-the-poor.html|access-date=27 February 2010|first=DE|last=Sanger|date=8 June 1992|journal=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bles.dole.gov.ph/PUBLICATIONS/Yearbook%20of%20Labor%20Statistics/STATISTICAL%20TABLES/PDF/CHAPTER%2011/Tab11.2.pdf ''Year of Labor Statistics'']{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Overall, the economy under Aquino had an average growth of 3.8% from 1986 to 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Asia-and-the-Pacific/Philippines-OVERVIEW-OF-ECONOMY.html|title=Philippines Overview of economy, Information about Overview of economy in Philippines|publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com|access-date=13 March 2010}}</ref>

Soon after taking office, several Senators declared that the presence of U.S. military forces in the Philippines was an affront to national sovereignty. Even though Aquino personally felt that they should remain, certain members of the Senate called for the United States military to vacate [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay]] and [[Clark Air Base]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/28/world/philippines-orders-us-to-leave-strategic-navy-base-at-subic-bay.html |last=Sanger |first=David E. |title=Philippines Orders the U.S. to Leave Strategic Navy Base at Subic Bay |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=28 December 1991 |access-date=25 August 2016}}</ref> The United States objected, pointing that they had leased the property and the leases were still in effect.<ref>Baker 2004 p. 123</ref> Also, thousands of Filipinos worked at these military facilities and they would lose their jobs and the Filipino economy would suffer if the U.S. military moved out. The United States stated that the facilities at [[Subic Bay]] were unequaled anywhere in [[Southeast Asia]] and a U.S. pullout could make all of that region of the world vulnerable to an incursion by the Soviet Union or by a resurgent Japan. The Senate refused to back down and insisted that the United States get out even though Aquino herself led a protest against a pullout. The protest gathered between 100,000 and 150,000 supporters, far short of the 500,000 to 1 million that had been originally expected.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-11-mn-1923-story.html|title=100,000 March With Aquino to Back U.S. Treaty : Philippines: 'People power' is used to pressure the Senate, but the crowd falls short of her expectations.

She had to formally concede to it, and in December 1991 the government served notice that the U.S. must close the base by the end of 1992.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-12-27-mn-909-story.html|title=Close Subic Base by End of '92, Manila Tells U.S.|date=27 December 1991|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=5 June 2019|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

President Aquino envisioned agrarian and land reform as the centerpiece of her administration's social legislative agenda. However, her family background and social class as a privileged daughter of a wealthy and landed clan became a lightning rod of criticisms against her land reform agenda. On 22 February 1987, three weeks after the resounding ratification of the 1987 Constitution, agrarian workers, and farmers marched to the historic Mendiola Street near the [[Malacañan Palace]] to demand genuine land reform from Aquino's administration. However, the march turned violent when Marine forces fired at farmers who tried to go beyond the designated demarcation line set by the police. As a result, at least 12 were killed and 51 protesters were injured<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1993/mar1993/gr_84607_1993.html|title=Supreme Court G.R. No. 84607|website=www.lawphil.net|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref> in this incident now known as the [[Mendiola Massacre]]. This incident led some prominent members of the Aquino Cabinet to resign their government posts.

In response to calls for agrarian reform, President Aquino issued Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order 229 on 22 July 1987, which outlined her land reform program, which included sugar lands. In 1988, with the backing of Aquino, the new [[Congress of the Philippines]] passed [[List of Philippine laws|Republic Act]] No. 6657, more popularly known as the "Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law". The law paved the way for the redistribution of agricultural lands to tenant-farmers from landowners, who were paid in exchange by the government through [[just compensation]] but was also allowed to retain not more than five hectares of land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tanggol.org/environmental_laws/RA6657.html |title=Section 6, Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law |access-date=13 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823212620/http://www.tanggol.org/environmental_laws/RA6657.html |archivedate=23 August 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> However, corporate landowners were also allowed under the law to "voluntarily divest a proportion of their [[stock|capital stock]], equity or participation in favor of their workers or other qualified beneficiaries", in lieu of turning over their land to the government for redistribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tanggol.org/environmental_laws/RA6657.html |title=Section 31, Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law |access-date=13 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823212620/http://www.tanggol.org/environmental_laws/RA6657.html |archivedate=23 August 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Despite the flaws in the law, the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality in 1989, declaring that the implementation of the comprehensive agrarian reform program (CARP) provided by the said law, was "a revolutionary kind of expropriation".<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Association of Small Landowners v. Luz|vol=175|reporter=SCRA|opinion=343|pinpoint=386|court=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]|date=14 July 1989|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1989/jul1989/gr_78742_1989.html }}</ref>

Despite the implementation of CARP, Aquino was not spared from the controversies that eventually centered on [[Hacienda Luisita]], a 6,453-hectare estate located in the Province of [[Tarlac]], which she, together with her siblings inherited from her father [[Jose Cojuangco]] (Don Pepe).<ref name=pdihl>{{cite news |author=Russell Arador |title=Life once 'sweeter' at Hacienda Luisita |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=64019 |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=4 May 2007 |access-date=25 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005095533/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=64019 |archivedate=5 October 2008  }}</ref>

Critics argued that Aquino bowed to pressure from relatives by allowing stock redistribution under Executive Order 229. Instead of land distribution, Hacienda Luisita reorganized itself into a corporation and distributed stock. As such, ownership of agricultural portions of the hacienda was transferred to the corporation, which in turn, gave its shares of stocks to farmers.<ref name=pdihl/>

The arrangement remained in force until 2006 when the [[Department of Agrarian Reform]] revoked the stock distribution scheme adopted in Hacienda Luisita and ordered instead of the redistribution of a large portion of the property to the tenant-farmers. The Department stepped into the controversy when in 2004, violence erupted over the retrenchment of workers in the Hacienda, eventually leaving seven people dead.<ref name=pdihl/>

===Natural disasters and calamities===
During her last two years in office, President Aquino's administration faced a series of natural disasters and calamities. Among these were the [[1990 Luzon earthquake]], which left around 1,600 people dead and the 1991 volcanic eruption of what was then thought to be a dormant [[Mount Pinatubo]], which was the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century, killing around 300 people and causing widespread long-term devastation of agricultural lands in [[Central Luzon]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Cataclysmic 1991 Eruption of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/1997/fs113-97|access-date=22 March 2008|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]}}</ref> On 1 November 1991 [[Tropical Storm Thelma]] (also known as Typhoon Uring) caused massive flooding in [[Ormoc City]], leaving around 5,000 dead in what was then considered to be the deadliest typhoon in Philippine history. On 8 November, Aquino declared all of [[Leyte]] a [[disaster area]].<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Vindicator|date=9 November 1991|access-date=7 May 2013|title=The Philippines: Search continues for bodies of victims|page=A3|location=Manila, Philippines|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CedYAAAAIBAJ&pg=1325%2C4260781}}</ref> On 20 December 1987, the [[MV Doña Paz|MV ''Doña Paz'']] sank which ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and others have dubbed as "the deadliest peacetime maritime disaster of the 20th century",<ref name=Hooke/> given the death toll which were initially estimated to be around 1,500<ref>{{cite news |author1=Omar Acosta |author2=Dave Veridiano |author3=Gerry Lirio  |name-list-style=amp |title=238 Bodies Washed Ashore in Mindoro |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=24 December 1987 }}</ref> which later grew for at least 3,000,<ref>{{cite news |title=3,159 people were on 'Dona Paz'|publisher=Lloyd's List|date=24 February 1988 }}</ref> and finally exceeded about 4,300.<ref name=Hooke>Hooke, Norman.

===Electrical power grid inadequacy===
During Aquino's presidency, electric [[power outage|blackouts]] became common in Manila. The capital experienced blackouts lasting 7–12 hours, bringing numerous businesses to a halt. By the departure of Aquino in June 1992, businesses in Manila and nearby provinces had lost nearly $800 million since the preceding March.

Corazon Aquino's decision to mothball the Bataan Nuclear Plant built during the Marcos administration contributed to the power crisis in the 1990s, as the 620 megawatts capacity of the plant was enough to cover the shortfall at that time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brownouts Darken Outlook for Aquino : Philippines: Power outages cripple industry and snarl traffic.

===Controversies and Cabinet Infighting===
When 51 farmers staging a peaceful rally in Mendiola were gunned down by the military under Aquino on 22 January 1987 during the [[Mendiola Massacre]], [[Jose Diokno]], father of human rights, head of the Presidential Committee on Human Rights, chairman of the [[Commission on Human Rights]] (CHR), and chairman of the government panel in charge of negotiations with rebel forces resigned from his government posts in deep disgust and great sadness. His daughter Maris said, "It was the only time we saw him near tears."<ref name=dalisaybio>{{cite web|last=Dalisay|first=Jose Jr.|title=Jose W.

In September 1987, Vice President Doy Laurel resigned as Cory's Secretary of Foreign Affairs. In his letter to Cory, he said: "the past years of Marcos are now beginning to look no worse than your first two years in office. And the reported controversies and scandals involving your closest relatives have become the object of our people's outrage. From 16,500 NPA regular when Marcos fell, the communists now claim an armed strength of 25,200. From city to countryside, anarchy has spread. There is anarchy within the government, anarchy within the ruling coalesced parties and anarchy in the streets."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/opinion/columns/back-channel-by-alejandro-del-rosario/140961/doy-laurel-s-letter-to-cory-aquino.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 September 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927015810/http://manilastandardtoday.com/opinion/columns/back-channel-by-alejandro-del-rosario/140961/doy-laurel-s-letter-to-cory-aquino.html |archivedate=27 September 2016  }}</ref>

===Influence in 1992 presidential campaign===
[[File: Corazon Aquino 1992.jpg|thumb|left|President Corazon Aquino addresses base workers at a rally at Remy Field concerning jobs for Filipino workers after the Americans withdraw from the U.S. facilities]]

In part due to Marcos' excesses, the framers of the 1987 Constitution limited the president to a single six-year term, with no possibility of re-election. As the end of her presidency drew near, close advisers and friends told Aquino that since she was not inaugurated under the 1987 Constitution, she was still eligible to seek the presidency again in the upcoming [[1992 Philippine presidential election|1992 elections]], the first presidential elections held under normal and peaceful circumstances since 1965. However, Aquino strongly declined the requests for her to seek reelection and wanted to set an example to both citizens and politicians that the presidency was not a lifetime position.

Initially, she named [[Ramon V. Mitra]], a friend of her husband Ninoy and then-Speaker of the [[Philippine House of Representatives]], as her candidate for the presidential race in 1992. However, she later on backtracked and instead threw her support behind the candidacy of her defense secretary and EDSA Revolution hero, General Fidel V. Ramos, who constantly stood by and defended her government from the various coup attempts and rebellions that were launched against her. Her sudden change of mind and withdrawal of support from Mitra drew criticism not only from her supporters in the liberal and [[social democratic]] sectors but also from the Roman Catholic Church, which questioned her anointing of Ramos since the latter was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. Nevertheless, Aquino's candidate eventually won the 1992 elections, albeit with only 23.58% of the total votes in a wide-open campaign, and was sworn in as the 12th President of the Philippines on 30 June 1992.

==Post-presidency and continued political activism==
[[File: Aquino 2003.jpg|thumb|right|Mrs. Aquino speaking before the 2003 Ninoy Aquino Award ceremony at the U.S. Embassy in Manila.]]

===Activities and drives===

====Political causes====
On 30 June 1992, President Aquino formally and peacefully handed over power to Ramos, after six years of hard-fought democratic transition and restoration. After the inauguration of the new president, Aquino chose to leave by riding in a simple white [[Toyota Crown]] she had purchased, rather than the lavish government-issued [[Mercedes Benz]] which she and Ramos had ridden in on the way to the ceremonies, to make the point that she was once again an ordinary citizen.<ref>{{cite news|first=Sandra|last=Burton|title=Time 100: Corazon Aquino|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990823/aquino1.html|work=Time Magazine|date=23–30 August 1999|access-date=15 April 2008}}</ref>

After Aquino retired to private life following the end of her term she remained active in the Philippine political scene, constantly voicing opposition and dissent to government actions and policies, which she deemed as threats to the liberal traditions and democratic foundations of the country. In 1997, Aquino, together with Cardinal [[Jaime Sin]], led a huge rally which succeeded in thwarting then President Fidel Ramos' attempt to extend his term by amending the 1987 Constitution's restriction on presidential term limits. In 1998, Aquino endorsed the candidacy of former police general and Manila Mayor [[Alfredo Lim]] for president. Lim, however, lost to then Vice-President [[Joseph Estrada]], who won by a landslide.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lozada misses Cory Aquino in Navotas Mass|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/86302/Lozada-misses-Cory-Aquino-in-Navotas-Mass|publisher=GMA News.TV|date=26 March 2008|access-date=14 April 2008 }}</ref> The following year, Aquino again with Cardinal Sin successfully opposed President Estrada's plan to amend the Constitution, which he said was intended to lift provisions that 'restrict' economic activities and investments; he denied that it was another ploy for him to extend his stay in office.

In 2000, Aquino joined the mounting calls for Estrada to resign from office, amid strong allegations of bribery charges and gambling kickbacks and a series of corruption scandals, which eventually led to his unsuccessful impeachment in December of that year. In her Preface to [[Frank-Jürgen Richter]] and Pamela Mar's book ''Asia's New Crisis'',<ref>[[Frank-Jürgen Richter]], Pamela Mar: ''Asia's New Crisis'', John Wiley & Sons Singapore, 2004</ref> she decries that the unique Asian way of doing business has given rise to much crony capitalism and opacity in Asia, including the Philippines. In January 2001, during the [[Second EDSA Revolution]] which ousted Estrada, Aquino enthusiastically supported the ascendancy of another woman, then-Vice President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], to power.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Landler|title=In Philippines, The Economy As Casualty; The ped, a Credibility Repair Job|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/09/business/philippines-economy-casualty-president-ousted-credibility-repair-job.html|work=New York Times|date=9 February 2001|access-date=14 April 2008}}</ref> Estrada was acquitted of [[perjury]] but found [[Guilty (law)|guilty]] of [[plunder]] and sentenced to [[reclusion perpetua]] with the accessory [[sanctions (law)|penalties]] of perpetual disqualification from [[public office]] and [[Asset forfeiture|forfeiture]] of ill-gotten [[wealth]] on 12 September 2007 and pardoned by Macapagal-Arroyo on 26 October 2007.

In 2005, after a series of revelations and exposes alleged and implicated President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] in [[2005 Philippine electoral crisis|rigging]] the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 presidential elections]], Aquino called on Macapagal-Arroyo to resign in order to prevent bloodshed, violence and further political deterioration.<ref>{{cite news|author=Carlos H.

In the [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 senatorial elections]], Aquino actively campaigned for the senatorial bid of her only son, [[Benigno Aquino III|Noynoy Aquino]], who ran successfully. In December 2008, Corazon Aquino publicly expressed regret for her participation in the EDSA Revolution of 2001, which installed Arroyo into power. She apologized to former President Joseph Estrada for the role she played in his ouster in 2001.<ref>{{cite news|title=Aquino says sorry to Estrada; concedes EDSA II was a mistake|author=Leah Salaverria|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20081223-179471/Aquino-says-sorry-to-Estrada|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=23 December 2008|access-date=23 December 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108152044/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20081223-179471/Aquino-says-sorry-to-Estrada|archivedate=8 January 2009}}</ref> For this action, many politicians criticized Aquino.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cory apologizes for EDSA 2, get flak|url=http://angperyodiko.net/home/?p=9|access-date=28 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723013602/http://angperyodiko.net/home/?p=9|archivedate=23 July 2011}}</ref> In June 2009, two months before her death, Aquino issued a public statement which strongly denounced and condemned the Arroyo administration's plan of amending the 1987 Constitution, calling such attempt as a "shameless abuse of power."

====International engagements====
Shortly after leaving the presidency, Aquino traveled abroad, giving speeches and lectures on issues of democracy, development, human rights, and women empowerment. In 1997, Aquino attended the wake and funeral of Saint [[Mother Teresa of Calcutta]], whom she met during the latter's visit in Manila in 1989. In the 2000s (decade), Aquino joined various global leaders and democratic icons in urging the Government of [[Burma]] to unconditionally release Burmese democratic leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] from detention, whom she delivered a speech on behalf in the 1994 meeting of the [[UNESCO]] World Commission on Culture and Development in Manila. In 2005, Aquino joined the international community in mourning the death of [[Pope John Paul II]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

====Charitable and social initiatives====
Aside from being visible in various political gatherings and demonstrations, Aquino was heavily involved in several charitable activities and socio-economic initiatives. From 1992 until her death, Aquino was chairperson of the Benigno S. Aquino, Jr. Foundation which she set up in her husband's honor right after his brutal assassination in 1983. Further, she supported other causes such as the [[Gawad Kalinga]] social housing project for the poor and homeless. In 2007, Aquino helped establish the PinoyME Foundation, a non-profit organization that aims to provide microfinancing programs and projects for the poor. She was also a lifelong member of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]], an international organization of former and current female heads of state and government. She also studied painting, and would occasionally give away her paintings to friends and family. In some events, Aquino auctioned her painting and gave all of the money to charity. She never sold her art for her own profit.<ref name="RCATA"/>

==Illness and death==

On 24 March 2008, Aquino's family announced that the former president had been diagnosed with [[colorectal cancer]].

A series of healing [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]es for Aquino (a devout Catholic) were held throughout the country intended for her recovery.

Upon learning of Aquino's death, then-incumbent President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], who was then on a state visit to the United States, announced a 10-day mourning period for the former president and issued Administrative Order No. 269 detailing the necessary arrangements for a [[state funeral]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Palace declares week of mourning on the passing of Cory|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/168753/Palace-declares-week-of-mourning-on-passing-of-Cory|work=GMANews.tv|access-date=1 August 2009|date=1 August 2009}}</ref> Aquino's children, however, declined the government's offer of a state funeral for their mother.<ref>{{cite web|author=Noel Orsal & Paul Mata|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/22688/Kris-Aquino-explains-why-family-chose-not-to-have-state-funeral-for-former-President-Corazon-Aquino|title=Kris Aquino explains why family chose not to have state funeral for former President Corazon Aquino|publisher=Pep.ph|access-date=13 March 2010}}</ref>

All churches in the Philippines celebrated requiem masses simultaneously throughout the country and all government offices flew the Philippine flag at half-mast.

A final requiem Mass was held on the morning of 5 August 2009, with then-[[Archbishop of Manila]] [[Gaudencio Rosales|Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales]], then-[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Balanga|Bishop of Balanga]] [[Socrates B.

Aquino's flag-draped casket was escorted from the cathedral to Manila Memorial Park in [[Parañaque]], where she was interred beside her husband in the family mausoleum. Aquino's funeral procession took more than eight hours to reach the burial site, as tens of thousands of civilians lined the route to pay their respects. [[Philippine Air Force]] [[UH-1]] helicopters showered the procession with yellow confetti and ships docked at Manila's harbor blared their sirens, all to salute the late President.

===Reaction===
Both local and international leaders showed respect for Aquino's achievements in the process of democratization in the Philippines.

====Local reaction====

Various politicians across the political spectrum expressed their grief and praise for the former Philippine leader. President Arroyo, once an ally of Aquino, remembered the sacrifices she made for the country and called her a "national treasure."<ref name="AgerInquirer2">{{cite news|url=http://www.inquirer.net/specialreports/coryaquino/view.php?db=1&article=20090801-218238|title=Arroyo orders 10 days of mourning|last=Cabacungan, Jr.|first=Gil|date=1 August 2009|publisher=INQUIRER.net|access-date=2 August 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810212450/http://www.inquirer.net/specialreports/coryaquino/view.php?db=1&article=20090801-218238|archivedate=10 August 2009}}</ref> Former President Estrada said that the country had lost its mother and guiding voice with her sudden death.

Former Senate President [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], Aquino's defense minister and later fierce critic, asked the public to pray for her eternal repose. Although former Aquino interior minister and Senate minority floor leader [[Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.]], revealed that he had "mixed feelings" about Aquino's death, he also said that the country "shall be forever indebted to Cory for rallying the nation behind the campaign to topple dictatorial rule and restore democracy".<ref>{{cite news|title=Senators remember Cory's greatness|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/168760/Senators-remember-Corys-greatness|work=GMANews.tv|access-date=1 August 2009|date=1 August 2009}}</ref>

Ordinary Filipinos throughout the country wore either yellow shirts or held masses for Aquino as their way of paying tribute to the woman who once led them in a revolution that changed the course of their country's history. Yellow Ribbons, which were once used during Aquino's battle with Marcos, were tied along major national roads and streets as a sign of solidarity and support for the now deceased Aquino and her grieving family. In popular social networking sites such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], Filipinos posted yellow ribbons in their accounts as a tribute to the former Philippine leader. Following her death, Filipino Catholics called on the Church to have Aquino canonized and declared as a [[saint]]. During her lifetime, Aquino was known and praised for her strong spirituality and sincere devotion to the Catholic faith. Days after her funeral, the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] (BSP) announced that it supported calls to put the former president on the 500-Peso banknote alongside her husband, Ninoy Aquino.<ref>{{cite news|title=BSP backs adding Cory image to P500 bill|url=http://business.inquirer.net/money/breakingnews/view/20090806-219048/BSP-backs-adding-Cory-image-to-P500-bill|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|access-date=6 August 2009|date=6 August 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808203647/http://business.inquirer.net/money/breakingnews/view/20090806-219048/BSP-backs-adding-Cory-image-to-P500-bill|archivedate=8 August 2009}}</ref>

====International reaction====
Across the globe, messages of sympathy and solidarity with the Filipino people were sent by various heads of state and international leaders. Pope [[Benedict XVI]], in his letter to Archbishop Rosales, recalled Aquino's "courageous commitment to the freedom of the Filipino people, her firm rejection of violence and intolerance" and called her a woman of courage and faith. U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], through White House Press Secretary [[Robert Gibbs]], said that "her courage, determination, and moral leadership are an inspiration to us all and exemplify the best in the Filipino nation". U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] expressed sadness over the passing of Aquino, to whom she had sent a personal letter of best wishes for recovery while she was still in hospital in July 2009. Clinton said that Aquino was "admired by the world for her extraordinary courage" in leading the fight against dictatorship.<ref>{{cite news|title=World mourns Aquino's death|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090801-218251/World-mourns-Aquinos-death|work=INQUIRER.net|access-date=1 August 2009|date=1 August 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804033534/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090801-218251/World-mourns-Aquinos-death|archivedate=4 August 2009}}</ref> Meanwhile, South African President [[Jacob Zuma]] called Aquino "a great leader who set a shining example of peaceful transition to democracy in her country".<ref>{{cite news|title=Aquino mourned at wake by thousands of Filipinos |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hgwQ8MfOS2fuOym9WcK126G9-UQgD99QM71O0 |last=Gomez |first=Jim |agency=Associated Press |access-date=4 August 2009 |date=1 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5imI9aEUA?url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hgwQ8MfOS2fuOym9WcK126G9-UQgD99QM71O0 |archivedate=4 August 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

[[Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom, through the British Ambassador in Manila, sent a message to the Filipino people which read: "I am saddened to hear of the death of Corazon 'Cory' Aquino the former President of the Republic of the Philippines". She also added, "I send my sincere condolences to her family and to the people of the Philippines.

Furthermore, Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]], in a telegram to President Arroyo, said that "the name of Corazon Aquino is associated with a period of profound reforms and the democratic transformation of Filipino society". Medvedev also lauded Aquino's sympathy to Russian people and her contribution to the improvement of [[Philippines–Russia relations|Russian-Filipino relations]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/text/news/2009/08/220411.shtml|title=Dmitry Medvedev expressed his condolences to President of the Philippines Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo following the passing of former President of the Republic Corazon Aquino.|date=1 August 2009|publisher=[[Presidential Press and Information Office]]|access-date=2 August 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807055946/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/text/news/2009/08/220411.shtml|archivedate=7 August 2009}}</ref>

Moreover, global democratic icons such as [[Timor-Leste]] President [[José Ramos-Horta]] and [[Wan Azizah]], wife of Malaysian opposition leader [[Anwar Ibrahim]], came to the Philippines not just to express their sympathies but to attend their friend Aquino's death and funeral, as well.

After her release from imprisonment for almost 20 years, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], Burma's democratic opposition leader, publicly stated that Aquino is one of her inspirations as she continues to champion the cause of democracy in [[Myanmar]]. She has also expressed her good wishes for Aquino's son, then incumbent Philippine president [[Benigno S. Aquino III]].

''[[Foreign Policy]]'' listed Corazon Aquino, along with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], and [[Sari Nusseibeh]], as people who "never won the [[Nobel Prize]], but should have."<ref>{{cite news|first=David |last=Kenner |title=Nobel Peace Prize Also-Rans |date=7 October 2009 |publisher=The Washington Post Company |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/10/07/nobel_peace_prize_also_rans |work=Foreign Policy |pages=1–7 |access-date=11 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125073527/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/10/07/nobel_peace_prize_also_rans |archivedate=25 January 2010 }}</ref>

Despite the accolades she has received for assuming the mantle of leadership of the democratic struggle against the Marcos dictatorship, Aquino has always stated that it was actually the Filipino people, not her, who restored democracy in the Philippines and maintained that she was only an instrument.

To preserve and celebrate her legacy, various types of commemorations and memorials in honor of President Aquino were made. Among these are as follow:

*On 3 February 2010, Grand Prize winner Julian Eymard Paguiligan of [[Bulacan State University]]'s College of Architecture and Fine Arts (CAFA) made his painting entry entitled ''Ika-25 ng Pebrero, 1986'' presented in the last year's 24th Visual Arts National Competition for the Directories Philippines Corporation's directory cover as a paid tribute. He made a portrait of the late President Aquino in 27.5x34.25" [[watercolor]] on paper, as a symbol for her contribution not only for [[democracy]], but also in the successes of the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]] in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/arts-and-culture/547206/images-tita-cory |last=Yuson |first=Alfred A. |title=Images of Tita Cory |website=Philstar.com |date=8 February 2010 |access-date=25 August 2016}}</ref>

President Corazon Aquino ended her term in 1992 with the country reeling under severe power shortage crisis. It was the offshoot of her administration's failure to provide replacement for the more than 600-MW of electricity foregone with the government's decision to mothball the Bataan nuclear power plant (BNPP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/opinion/2014/09/19/1370749/legacy-darkness|title=A legacy of darkness|first=Marichu A.|last=Villanueva}}</ref>
