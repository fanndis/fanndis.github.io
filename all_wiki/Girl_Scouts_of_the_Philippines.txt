The '''Girl Scouts of the Philippines (GSP)''' is the national [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Scouting]] association for girls and young women in the [[Philippines]]. Its mission is "to help girls and young women realize the ideals of womanhood and prepare themselves for their responsibilities in the home, to the nation, and to the world community".<ref name="gsp-mission">{{cite web |title=What is Girl Scouting? |url=http://www.girlscouts.org.ph/aboutus_index.html |publisher=Girl Scouts of the Philippines |accessdate=2007-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116110315/http://www.girlscouts.org.ph/aboutus_index.html |archivedate=2010-01-16 }}</ref> The girls-only association serves 800,000 members, as of 2017.<ref name="wagggs-membership">{{cite web |title=Our world.

The first Girl Scout troops were organized in the Philippines as early as 1918 by [[United States|American]] missionaries and [[Soldier|servicemen]]. These Scout troops were directly registered with the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]].{{cn|date=December 2016}}

[[Pilar Hidalgo-Lim]] and [[Josefa Llanes Escoda]] spearheaded the organization of a Scout movement for girls, and requested the assistance of the [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]] (BSP). In 1939, Mrs. Escoda was sent to the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] for training through the help of [[Joseph Stevenot]] of the BSP. Upon her return to the Philippines, she immediately started setting up the GSP with the help of other civic organizations.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

[[File:Girl Scouts of the Philippines.jpg|thumb|left|Historical marker]]On May 26, 1940, the GSP was chartered under [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]] Act No. 542.

In 1946, the GSP was accepted as a tenderfoot member of the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS) during the 11th World Conference held at [[Evian]], [[France]]. In 1948, the GSP became a full member of WAGGGS during the 12th World Conference held at [[Cooperstown, New York]].

Since 1995,  the organization lost nearly half of its members; the membership number decreased from 1,275,113 in 1995<ref name="Trefoil 1997">{{cite book |last=World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts |title=Trefoil round the World |year=1997 |publisher=World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts |location=London |isbn=0-900827-75-0 }}</ref> to 671,267 in 2003.<ref name="wagggs-membership"/> 

==Program==
The GSP's program focuses on "well-being, family life, heritage and citizenship, world community, preparedness, economic self-sufficiency, arts and environment".<ref name="Trefoil 1997"/> Center of the program is the "eight-point challenge", a merit-badge program. The highest award is the "Chief Girl Scout Medal" which was introduced in 1976.<ref name="chief girl scout medal">{{cite web|title=Chief Girl Scout Medal Scheme |url=http://www.girlscouts.org.ph/chief.html |publisher=Girl Scouts of the Philippines |accessdate=2007-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050505141907/http://www.girlscouts.org.ph/chief.html |archivedate=May 5, 2005 }}</ref>
