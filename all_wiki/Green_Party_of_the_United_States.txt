{{Politics of the United States}}

The '''Green Party of the United States''' ('''GPUS''') is a federation of [[Green party|Green]] state [[political parties in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Green Party|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Green_Party|publisher=ballotpedia.org|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref> The party promotes [[green politics]], specifically [[environmentalism]]; [[nonviolence]]; [[social justice]]; [[participatory democracy|participatory]], [[grassroots democracy]]; [[gender equality]]; [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]]; [[anti-war]]; [[anti-racism]] and [[ecosocialism]]. On the [[political spectrum]], the party is generally seen as [[left-wing]].<ref name="gp.org">{{cite web|url=http://gp.org/cgi-bin/vote/propdetail?pid=835|title=Green Party of the United States – National Committee Voting – Proposal Details|publisher=Green Party US|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref> 

The GPUS was founded in 2001 as the [[Association of State Green Parties]] (ASGP) split from the [[Greens/Green Party USA]] (G/GPUSA). After its founding, the GPUS soon became the primary national green organization in the country, eclipsing the G/GPUSA, which was formed in 1991 out of the Green Committees of Correspondence (CoC), a collection of local [[Green party|green groups]] active since 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/2001-13.pdf|title=Advisory Opinion 2001–13|publisher=Federal Election Commission|date=November 8, 2001|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref> The ASGP, which formed in 1996,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/989440.pdf|title=AOR 2011–13: Advisory Opinion Request (AOR) Seeking Recognition of the Coordinating Committee of the Green Party of the United States as the National Committee of the Green Party |publisher=Federal Election Commission|date=August 9, 2001|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref> had increasingly distanced itself from the G/GPUSA in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/989436.pdf|title=Coordinating Committee for the Greens/Green Party USA National Committee Governing Body of the "Green Party", Greens/Green Party USA|publisher=Federal Election Commission|date=September 7, 2001|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>

The Greens gained widespread public attention during the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], when the ticket composed of [[Ralph Nader]] and [[Winona LaDuke]] won 2.7% of the popular vote. Nader was vilified and scapegoated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], who accused him of [[Ralph Nader#Spoiler controversy|spoiling]] the election for [[Al Gore]], the Democratic candidate. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/09/us/2000-elections-green-party-angry-democrats-fearing-nader-cost-them-presidential.html|title=The 2000 Elections: The Green Party; Angry Democrats, Fearing Nader Cost Them Presidential Race, Threaten to Retaliate|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 9, 2000|last=Dao|first=James|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref> Nader maintains that he was not a spoiler in the 2000 election.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nader|first1=Ralph|date=June 2, 2016|title=I was not a 'spoiler' in 2000.

== History ==
{{main|History of the Green Party of the United States}}

=== Early years ===
The political movement that began in 1985 as the decentralized Committees of Correspondence<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.greens.org/s-r/14/14-03.html|title=A Historical Look at Green Structure: 1984 to 1992|accessdate=August 15, 2019|author=Marks, Jodean|journal=Synthesis/Regeneration|volume=14|year=1997}}</ref> evolved into a more centralized structure by 1990, opening a national clearinghouse and forming governing bodies, bylaws and a platform as the Green Committees of Correspondence (GCoC) and by 1990 simply The Greens. The organization conducted grassroots organizing efforts, educational activities and electoral campaigns.

Internal divisions arose between members who saw electoral politics as ultimately corrupting and supported the notion of an "anti-party party" formed by [[Petra Kelly]] and other leaders of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] in [[Germany]]<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.greens.org/s-r/28/28-18.html|title=On Morality and Human Dignity (excerpts)|accessdate=August 15, 2019|author=Kelly, Petra|journal=Synthesis/Regeneration|volume=28|year=2002}}</ref> vs. those who saw electoral strategies as a crucial engine of social change. A struggle for the direction of the organization culminated a "compromise agreement", ratified in 1990 at the Greens National Congress in [[Elkins, West Virginia]] and in which both strategies would be accommodated within the same [[527 organization|527 political organization]] renamed the [[Greens/Green Party USA]] (G/GPUSA). It was recognized by the [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] as a national political party in 1991.

The compromise agreement subsequently collapsed and two [[Green party]] organizations have co-existed in the United States since. The Green Politics Network was organized in 1990 and the National Association of Statewide Green Parties formed by 1994. Divisions between those pressing to break onto the national political stage and those aiming to grow roots at the local level continued to widen during the 1990s. The [[Association of State Green Parties]] (ASGP) encouraged and backed Nader's presidential runs in 1996 and 2000. By 2001, the push to separate electoral activity from the G/GPUSA issue-based organizing led to the Boston Proposal and subsequent rise of the Green Party of the United States.  The G/GPUSA lost most of its affiliates in the following months and dropped its FEC national party status in 2005.

== Ideology ==
{{Green politics sidebar}}
===Values===
The Green Party of the United States follows the ideals of [[green politics]], which are based on the Four Pillars, namely: 
# [[Ecosophy|Ecological wisdom]],
# [[Social justice]],
# [[Grassroots democracy]], and
# [[Nonviolence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gp.org/the_four_pillars|title=The Four Pillars|publisher=Green Party US|accessdate=August 15, 2019}}</ref>

The Ten Key Values, which expand upon the Four Pillars, are as follows:<ref name="Key">{{cite web|url=https://www.gp.org/ten_key_values_2016|title=Ten Key Values|publisher=Green Party US|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>
# [[Grassroots democracy]],
# [[Social justice]] and [[equal opportunity]],
# [[Ecosophy|Ecological wisdom]],
# [[Nonviolence]],
# [[Decentralization]],
# [[Community-based economics]],
# [[Feminism]] and [[gender equality]],
# [[Multiculturalism|Respect for diversity]],
# [[Social responsibility|Personal and global responsibility]], and
# Future focus and [[sustainability]].

The Green Party does not accept donations from corporations, [[political action committee]]s (PACs), [[527 organization|527(c) organization]]s or [[soft money]]. The party's [[Party platform|platforms]] and rhetoric harshly criticize corporate influence and control over government, media, and society at large.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Register as a Green – Green Party Website|url=http://www.gp.org/what-we-believe/why-register-as-a-green|publisher=Green Party|accessdate=November 9, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112190059/https://www.gp.org/what-we-believe/why-register-as-a-green|archivedate=November 12, 2014}}</ref>

===Ecosocialism===
In 2016, the Green Party passed a motion in favor of rejecting both [[capitalism]] and [[state socialism]], supporting instead an "alternative economic system based on ecology and decentralization of power".<ref name="Key" /> The motion states the change that the party says could be described as promoting "[[ecological socialism]]", "[[communalism]]", or the "cooperative commonwealth".<ref name="Key"/>

== Structure and composition ==
=== Committees ===
The Green Party has two national committees recognized by the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC):
* The [[Green National Committee]] (GNC)
* The [[Green Senatorial Campaign Committee]] (GSCC)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.greenscc.org/|title=The Green Senatorial Campaign Committee|publisher=Greenscc.org|url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115062754/https://www.greenscc.org/|archive-date=January 15, 2011|accessdate=August 17, 2019}}</ref>

=== Green National Committee ===
{{main|Green National Committee}}
The GNC is composed of delegates elected by affiliated state parties. The state parties also appoint delegates to serve on the various standing committees of the GNC. The National Committee elects a steering committee of seven co-chairs, a secretary and a treasurer to oversee daily operations. The National Committee performs most of its business online, but it also holds an annual national meeting to conduct business in person.

=== Caucuses ===
Five Identity Caucuses have achieved representation on the GNC:
* Black Caucus<ref>{{cite web|last=Grigsby|first=Karen|url=https://gpblackcaucus.blogspot.com/|title=Green Party Black Caucus Journal|publisher=Gpblackcaucus.blogspot.com|date=October 21, 2010|accessdate=August 17, 2019}}</ref>

Maine has the highest per capita number of Green elected officials in the country and the largest Green registration percentage with more than 29,273 Greens comprising 2.95% of the electorate {{as of|November 2006|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|last=Winger|first=Richard|url=http://www.ballot-access.org/2007/03/26/maine-green-registration-rises-again/|title=Maine Green Registration Rises Again|accessdate=August 17, 2019|publisher=Ballot Access News|date=March 26, 2007}}</ref> [[Madison, Wisconsin]] is the city with the most Green elected officials (8), followed by [[Portland, Maine]] (7).
[[File:GPUS_membership.svg|thumb|Membership in the Green Party of the United States by year]]
The 2016 [[Jill Stein presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] of [[Jill Stein]] got substantive support from counties and precincts with a high percentage of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] population. For instance, in [[Sioux County, North Dakota|Sioux County]] (North Dakota, 84,1% Native American), Stein gained her best county-wide result: 10.4% of the votes. In [[Rolette County, North Dakota|Rolette County]] (also North Dakota, 77% Native American), she got 4.7% of the votes. Other majority Native American counties where Stein did above state average are [[Menominee County, Wisconsin|Menominee]] (WI), [[Roosevelt County, Montana|Roosevelt]] (MT) and several precincts in [[Alaska]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|accessdate=August 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://decisiondeskhq.com/data-dives/creating-a-national-precinct-map/|title=Creating a National Precinct Map – Decision Desk HQ|website=decisiondeskhq.com|accessdate=August 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820073655/https://decisiondeskhq.com/data-dives/creating-a-national-precinct-map/|archive-date=August 20, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

At its peak in 2004, the Green Party had 319,000 registered members in states allowing party registration and tens of thousands of members and contributors in the rest of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.greens.org/stats/|title=Green Party Ballot Status and Voter Registration Totals (United States)|accessdate=August 17, 2019|publisher=Green Party of California|date=May 2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526183505/http://web.greens.org/stats/|archivedate=May 26, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Green Party Voter Registration Statistics|url=https://registergreenparty.org/|access-date=2020-10-07|website=registergreenparty.org}}</ref> {{As of|2020|}}, this has dropped to 251,000. One challenge that the Green Party (as well as other [[Third party (United States)|third parties]]) faces is the difficulty of overcoming [[ballot access]] laws in many states, yet the Green Party has active state parties in all but a few states.

== Fundraising and position on Super PACs ==
In the early decades of Green organizing in the United States, the prevailing American system of money-dominated elections was universally rejected by Greens, so that some Greens were reluctant to have Greens participate in the election system at all because they deemed the campaign finance system inherently corrupt. Other Greens felt strongly that the Green Party should develop in the electoral arena and many of these Greens felt that adopting an alternative model of campaign finance, emphasizing self-imposed contribution limits, would present a wholesome and attractive contrast to the odious campaign finance practices of the money-dominated major parties.

Over the years, some state Green parties have come to place less emphasis on the principle of self-imposed limits than they did in the past. Nevertheless, it is safe to say that Green Party fundraising (for candidates' campaigns and for the party itself) still tends to rely on relatively small contributions and that Greens generally decry not only the rise of the [[Political action committee|Super PACs]], but also the big-money system, which some Greens criticize as [[plutocracy]].

Some Greens feel that the Green Party's position should be simply to follow the laws and regulations of campaign finance.<ref>{{cite web|author=Garecht, Joe|url=http://www.localvictory.com/fundraising/creative-political-fundraising-ideas.html|title=7 Creative Political Fundraising Ideas|publisher=Localvictory.com|date=December 8, 2011|accessdate=August 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316233902/http://www.localvictory.com/fundraising/creative-political-fundraising-ideas.html|archive-date=March 16, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other Greens argue that it would injure the Green Party not to practice a principled stand against the anti-democratic influence of money in the political process. Candidates for office, like [[Jill Stein]], the 2012 and 2016 Green Party nominee for the President of the United States, typically rely on smaller donations to fund their campaigns.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/colleen-becker/long-shots_b_1263720.html|title=Long Shots|work=The Huffington Post|date=February 9, 2012|last=Becker|first=Colleen|accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref>
