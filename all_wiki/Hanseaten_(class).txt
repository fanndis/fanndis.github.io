The '''{{lang|de|Hanseaten}}''' ({{IPA-de|hanzeˈaːtn̩|lang}}, ''Hanseatics'') is a collective term for the hierarchy group (so called ''First Families'') consisting of elite individuals and families of prestigious rank who constituted the [[ruling class]] of the [[free imperial city]] of [[Hamburg]], conjointly with the equal ''First Families'' of the free imperial cities [[Bremen]] and [[Free City of Lübeck|Lübeck]]. The members of these ''First Families'' were the persons in possession of hereditary [[Grand Burgher|grand burghership]] (''{{lang|de|Großbürgerschaft}}'') of these cities, including the [[mayor]]s (''{{lang|de|Bürgermeister}}''), the [[senator]]s (''{{lang|de|Senatoren}}''), joint [[diplomat]]s (''{{lang|de|Diplomaten}}'') and the senior [[pastors]] (''{{lang|de|Hauptpastoren}}''). ''{{lang|de|Hanseaten}}'' refers specifically to the ruling families of Hamburg, Lübeck and Bremen, but more broadly, this group is also referred to as [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricians]] along with similar social groups elsewhere in continental Europe.

The three cities since the [[Congress of Vienna]] 1815 are each officially named the "[[Free state (government)#Germany|Free]] and Hanseatic City Hamburg" (''{{lang|de|Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg}}''),<ref>The [[Hanseatic League]] ended about mid 17th century. J. Werdenhagen, ''{{lang|la|De Rebus Publicis Hanseaticis Tractatus}}'', Frankfurt 1641, was the first to use the term "Hanseatic", characterizing the Union between Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck, created between 1630 and 1650 in lieu of the perished Hanse.

The Hanseaten were regarded as being of equal rank to the (landed) [[nobility]] elsewhere in Europe,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |author=Rudolf Endres |title=Adel in der frühen Neuzeit |encyclopedia=Enzyklopaedie Deutscher Geschichte |volume=18 |publisher=Oldenbourg |page=72 }}</ref> although the Hanseaten often regarded the (rural) nobility outside the city republics as inferior to the (urban and often more affluent, and in their own view, cultivated) Hanseaten. [[Thomas Mann]], a member of a Lübeck Hanseatic family, portrayed this class in his [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning novel ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'' (1901), for which he received the 1929 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].

==Relationship to the nobility==
{{See also|Republicanism}}
{{History of Hamburg}}
[[File:Johann Heinrich Burchard 1905.jpg|thumb|First Mayor [[Johann Heinrich Burchard]]]]
The relationship between the Hanseatic and noble families varied depending on the city. The most republican city was Hamburg, where the nobility was banned, from the 13th century to the 19th century, from owning property, participating in the political life of the city republic, and even from living within its walls. Hamburg, however, was not a true democracy, but rather an [[oligarchy]], with the Hanseaten as its elite occupying the position held by noble and princely families elsewhere. According to [[Richard J. Evans]], "the wealthy of nineteenth-century Hamburg were for the most part stern republicans, abhorring titles, refusing to accord any deference to the Prussian nobility, and determinedly loyal to their urban background and mercantile heritage."<ref>{{cite book |author=Richard J. Evans |authorlink=Richard J. Evans |title=Death in Hamburg: Society and Politics in the Cholera Years 1830–1910 |location=Oxford |year=1987 |page=560 }}</ref> Many grand burghers considered the nobility inferior to Hanseatic families.<ref name="Hauschild-Thiessen">{{cite book |author=Renate Hauschild-Thiessen |chapter=Adel und Bürgertum in Hamburg |title=Hamburgisches Geschlechterbuch |volume=14 |year=1997 |page=30 }}</ref> A marriage between a daughter of a Hanseatic family and a noble was often undesired by the Hanseaten.<ref>{{cite book |author=Percy Ernst Schramm |title=Gewinn und Verlust |publisher=Christians |location=Hamburg |year=1969 |page=108 }}</ref> From the late 19th century, being integrated into a German nation state, a number of Hanseatic families were nevertheless ennobled (by other German states, e.g. Prussia), but this was often met with criticism among their fellow Hanseaten.  As the Hanseatic banker [[Johann von Berenberg-Gossler]] was ennobled in Prussia in 1889, his sister Susanne, married [[Amsinck]], exclaimed "''{{lang|de|Aber John, unser guter Name!}}'' [But John, our good name!]"<ref name="Hauschild-Thiessen"/> Upon hearing of the ennoblement of Rudolph Schröder (1852–1938) of the ancient Hanseatic Schröder family, Hamburg First Mayor [[Johann Heinrich Burchard]] remarked that the Prussian King could indeed "place" (''{{lang|de|versetzen}}'') Schröder among the nobles, but he could not "elevate" (''{{lang|de|erheben}}'') a Hanseatic merchant.<ref name="Hauschild-Thiessen"/>
