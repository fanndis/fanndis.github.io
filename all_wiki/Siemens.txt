===1847 to 1901===
[[File:Wvs 1885.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|[[Werner von Siemens]], co-founder of [[Siemens & Halske]].]]
[[Siemens & Halske]] was founded by [[Werner von Siemens]] and [[Johann Georg Halske]] on 1 October 1847. Based on the [[telegraph]], their invention used a needle to point to the sequence of letters, instead of using [[Morse code]]. The company, then called ''Telegraphen-Bauanstalt von Siemens & Halske'', opened its first workshop on 12 October.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://new.siemens.com/global/en/company/about/history/news/the-year-is-1847.html |title=The year is 1847 – How it all began", Siemens Historical Institute |publisher=Siemens AG |access-date=27 October 2019}}</ref>

In 1848, the company built the first long-distance telegraph line in Europe; 500&nbsp;km from Berlin to [[Frankfurt am Main]]. In 1850, the founder's younger brother, Carl Wilhelm Siemens, later [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens|Sir William Siemens]], started to represent the company in London. The [[Siemens Brothers|London agency]] became a branch office in 1858. In the 1850s, the company was involved in building long-distance telegraph networks in Russia. In 1855, a company branch headed by another brother, [[Carl Heinrich von Siemens]], opened in [[St Petersburg]], Russia. In 1867, Siemens completed the monumental [[Indo-European telegraph]] line stretching over 11,000&nbsp;km from [[London]] to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://new.siemens.com/global/en/company/about/history/news.html |title=Halfway around the world in 28 minutes – Indo-European Telegraph Line |website=Siemens Historical Institute |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120233553/http://w4.siemens.de/archiv/en/laender/asien/indien.html |archive-date=20 January 2008|url-status=dead |access-date=12 January 2008}}</ref>

In 1881, a Siemens [[Alternating current|AC]] [[Alternator]] driven by a [[watermill]] was used to power the world's first electric street lighting in the town of [[Godalming]], United Kingdom. The company continued to grow and diversified into [[electric locomotive|electric trains]] and [[light bulbs]]. In 1887, it opened its first office in Japan.<ref>Siemens website [http://www.siemens.com/history/en/news/1125_japan.htm August 1, 2012 – 125 Years Siemens in Japan (1887–2012)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305014307/http://www.siemens.com/history/en/news/1125_japan.htm |date=5 March 2016 }} Retrieved on 12 August 2013</ref> In 1890, the founder retired and left the running of the company to his brother Carl and sons Arnold and Wilhelm.

Siemens & Halske (S & H) was incorporated in 1897, and then merged parts of its activities with Schuckert & Co., Nuremberg in 1903 to become [[Siemens-Schuckert]].  In 1907, Siemens ([[Siemens & Halske]] and [[Siemens-Schuckert]]) had 34,324 employees and was the seventh-largest company in the German empire by number of employees.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fiedler |first=Martin |year=1999 |title=Die 100 größten Unternehmen in Deutschland – nach der Zahl ihrer Beschäftigten – 1907, 1938, 1973 und 1995 |journal=Zeitschrift für Unternehmensgeschichte |publisher=Verlag C.H.

In the 1920s, Siemens constructed the [[Shannon hydroelectric scheme|Ardnacrusha]] Hydro Power station on the [[River Shannon]] in the then [[Irish Free State]], and it was a world first for its design. The company is remembered for its desire to raise the wages of its under-paid workers only to be overruled by the [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] government.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20020804/ai_n12846719 |title=Ardnacrusha – Dam hard job |date=4 August 2002 |work=[[Sunday Mirror]] |access-date=18 September 2010 |first=Andrew |last=Bushe |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221060803/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20020804/ai_n12846719 |archive-date=21 February 2008}}</ref>

During the final years of [[World War II]], numerous plants and factories in Berlin and other major cities were destroyed by Allied air raids. To prevent further losses, manufacturing was therefore moved to alternative places and regions not affected by the air war. The goal was to secure continued production of important war-related and everyday goods. According to records, Siemens was operating almost 400 alternative or relocated manufacturing plants at the end of 1944 and in early 1945.

In 1972, Siemens sued German satirist F.C. Delius for his satirical history of the company, ''Unsere Siemenswelt'', and it was determined much of the book contained false claims although the trial itself publicized Siemens' history in Nazi Germany.<ref>[http://www.adl.org/braun/dim_13_2_forgetting_print.asp German Industry and the Third Reich: Fifty Years of Forgetting and Remembering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030133244/http://www.adl.org/braun/dim_13_2_forgetting_print.asp |date=30 October 2012 }}.

===2005 and continuing: worldwide bribery scandal ===
In 2005 Germany opened investigations into Siemens business practices worldwide, prompted by requests from prosecutors in Italy, Liechtenstein and Switzerland; US investigators joined in 2006 and the US investigators addressed violations only since 2001, when Siemens started selling shares in a US stock exchange.<ref name=NYThow>{{cite news |last1=Schubert |first1=Siri |last2=Miller |first2=T.

Fines were anticipated to be as high as $5 billion as the investigation unfolded.<ref name=Guardian2008>{{cite news |last1=Gow |first1=David |title=Record US fine ends Siemens bribery scandal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/16/regulation-siemens-scandal-bribery |work=The Guardian |date=15 December 2008}}</ref>  Settlement negotiations took place through most of 2008 and when they were announced in December they were far less, driven in part by Siemens' cooperation, in part by the imminent change in US administrations (the [[Obama administration]] was about to take over from the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]), and in part by the dependence of the US military on Siemens as a contractor.<ref name=NYThow/><ref name=Guardian2008/><ref name=WaPo2008/>

The company paid a total of about $1.6 billion, around $800 million in each of the US and Germany.  This was the largest bribery fine in history, at the time.  The money paid to Germany included a $270 million fine paid the year before (related to bribes in Nigeria<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7105582.stm |title=Nigeria probes Siemens bribe case}}</ref>).  The US payment included $450 million in fines and penalties and a forfeiture of $350 million in profits.<ref name=WaPo2008/>  The company was also obligated to spend $1 billion on setting up and funding new internal compliance regimens.<ref name=NYThow/>  Siemens pleaded guilty to violating accounting provisions of the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]; the parent company did not plead guilty to paying bribes (although its Bangladesh and Venezuela subsidiaries did<ref name=WaPo2008/>); such a guilty plea would have barred Siemens from contracting for the US government.<ref name=NYThow/>  As the scandal had started breaking, Siemens had fired its chairman and CEO [[Heinrich von Pierer]], and had hired its first non-German CEO, Peter Löscher; it also had appointed a US lawyer, Peter Solmssen as an [[independent director]] to its board, in charge of compliance, and had accepted oversight of [[Theo Waigel]], a former German finance minister, as a "compliance monitor".<ref name=Guardian2008/>  The compliance overhaul eventually entailed hiring around 500 full-time compliance personnel worldwide. Siemens also enacted a series of new anti-corruption compliance policies, including a new anti-corruption handbook, web-based tools for due diligence and compliance, a confidential communications channel for employees to report irregular business practices, and a corporate disciplinary committee to impose appropriate disciplinary measures for substantiated misconduct.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-fraud/legacy/2013/05/02/12-12-08siemensvenez-sent.pdf |title=United States of America v.

The culture of bribery was old in Siemens, and led to the 1914 [[Siemens scandal|scandal in Japan]] over bribes paid by both Siemens and [[Vickers]] to Japanese naval authorities to win shipbuilding contracts.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sims |first=Richard |year=2001 |title=Japanese Political History Since the Meiji Renovation 1868–2000 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=113 |isbn=0-312-23915-7}}</ref>

The culture of bribery had further had grown up inside Siemens after World War II as Siemens attempted to rebuild its business by competing in the developing world, where bribery is common.  Until 1999 in Germany, bribes were a tax-deductible business expense, and there were no penalties for bribing foreign officials.  In 1999 the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] came into effect, to which Germany was a party, and Siemens started to use off-shore accounts and other means of hiding its bribery.

As the investigation opened a midlevel executive in the telecommunications unit, Reinhard Slekaczek, was identified as a key player; Slekaczek quit Siemens in 2005 after the company required him to sign a document saying he had followed law and company policy, and turned state's evidence and led investigators to documents he had saved and to other documents.  He had controlled an annual global bribery budget of $40 to $50 million.  The usual method of bribery was to pay a local insider as a "contractor" who would in turn pass money to government officials; as part of the settlement Siemens disclosed that it had 2,700 such contractors worldwide.  Bribes were generally around 5% of a contract's value but in very corrupt countries they could be as high as 40%.  It paid the highest bribes in Argentina, Israel, Venezuela, China, Nigeria, and Russia.<ref name=NYThow/>

Examples of bribery the investigation found included:<ref name=NYThow/>
* $40 million in bribes in Argentina to win a $1 billion contract to make national identity cards. 
* $20 million in Israel for a contract to build power plants
* $16 million in Venezuela for urban rail lines. 
* $14 million In China for medical equipment
* $12.7 million in payments in Nigeria
* $5 million in Bangladesh for mobile phones
* $1.7 million in Iraq to Saddam Hussein and others.

The investigation led directly to several prosecutions while it was unfolding, and led to settlements with other governments and prosecution of Siemens employees and bribe recipients in various countries.

In May 2007 a German court convicted two former executives of paying about €6 million in bribes from 1999 to 2002 to help Siemens win [[natural gas]] [[Gas turbine|turbine]] supply contracts with [[Enel]], an Italian energy company. The contracts were valued at about €450 million. Siemens was fined €38 million.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/business/worldbusiness/15siemens.html |title=The New York Times |access-date=15 May 2007 |date=15 May 2007 |first=G.

In July 2009, Siemens settled allegations of fraud by a Russian affiliate in a [[World Bank]]-funded mass transit project in Moscow by agreeing to not bid on World Bank projects for two years, not allowing the Russian affiliate to do any World Bank funded work for four years, and setting up a $100 million fund at the World Bank to fund anti-corruption activities over 15 years, over which the World Bank had veto and audit rights; this fund became the "“Siemens Integrity Initiative”.<ref name=cold>{{cite book |last1=Oduor |first1=Jacinta Anyango |last2=Fernando |first2=Francisca M.
