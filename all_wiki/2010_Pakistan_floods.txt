The '''floods in Pakistan''' began in late July 2010, resulting from heavy [[monsoon]] rains in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Sindh]], [[Punjab (Pakistani province)|Punjab]] and, [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] regions of [[Pakistan]], which affected the [[Indus River]] [[Drainage basin|basin]].

A research by [[Utah State University]]<ref>Wang et al. (2011) http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JD015760/abstract</ref> analyzed conditional instability, moisture flux, and circulation features and the results support a persistent increase in conditional instability during the July premonsoon phase, accompanied by increased frequency of heavy rainfall events. The increased convective activity during the premonsoon phase agrees with the projected increase in the intensity of heavy rainfall events over northern Pakistan. Large-scale circulation analysis reveals an upper-level cyclonic anomaly over and to the west of Pakistan<ref>{{cite journal|title=Identification of extreme precipitation threat across midlatitude regions based on short-wave circulations | doi=10.1002/jgrd.50841 | volume=118| issue=19 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|pages=11,059–11,074|bibcode=2013JGRD..11811059W|year = 2013|last1 = Wang|first1 = Shih-Yu| last2=Davies | first2=Robert E. | last3=Gillies | first3=Robert R. | url=https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/psc_facpub/795 }}</ref>–a feature empirically associated with weak monsoon. The analysis also suggests that the anomalous circulation in 2010 is not sporadic but rather is part of a long-term trend that defies the typical linkage of strong monsoons with an anomalous anticyclone in the upper troposphere.

In response to previous [[Indus River]] floods in 1973 and 1976, Pakistan created the [[Federal Flood Commission]] (FFC) in 1977. The FFC operates under Pakistan's [[Ministry of Water and Power (Pakistan)|Ministry of Water and Power]]. It is charged with executing flood control projects and protecting lives and property of Pakistanis from the impact of floods. Since its inception the FFC has received Rs 87.8 billion (about US$900 million). FFC documents show that numerous projects were initiated, funded and completed, but reports indicate that little work has actually been done due to ineffective leadership and corruption.<ref name=ahmadani>{{cite web |url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/19-Aug-2010/Heavily-funded-FFC-fails-to-deliver/ |author=Ahmadani A |title=Heavily Funded FFC Fails to Deliver |publisher=TheNation |date=19 August 2010 |accessdate=17 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930122149/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/19-Aug-2010/Heavily-funded-FFC-fails-to-deliver/ |archive-date=30 September 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Agricultural crops such as cotton, rice, and sugarcane and to some extent [[mangoes]] were badly affected in Punjab, according to a Harvest Tradings-Pakistan spokesman. He called for the international community to fully participate in the rehabilitation process, as well as for the revival of agricultural crops in order to get better GDP growth in the future.

In affected Multan Division in [[Punjab (region)|South Punjab]], some people were seen to be engaging in price-gouging in this disaster, raising prices up to Rs 130/kg. Some called for [[Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited]] to write off all agricultural loans in the affected areas in Punjab, Sindh and [[Khyber Pukhtunkhwa]] especially for small farmers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.congoo.com/news/2010August19/Harvest-Tradings-floods-Pakistan-Millions |title=Harvest Tradings on Floods in Pakistan Millions of People And Their Property Have |publisher=Congoo |date=19 August 2010 |accessdate=24 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004105349/http://www.congoo.com/news/2010August19/Harvest-Tradings-floods-Pakistan-Millions |archive-date=4 October 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

====Climate-resilient model villages====

Following the 2010 floods, the Punjab government subsequently constructed 22 'disaster-resilient' model villages, comprising 1885 single-storey homes, together with schools and health centres. The [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]] was engaged to advise on how to make the new infrastructure resilient to extreme weather events occurring in the future. The idea was that the villages should provide 'triple wins' of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, promoting development and building resilience to climatic events. Now inhabited, the model villages incorporate biogas plants, solar energy systems, livestock sheds, covered sewerage, brick-paved streets, parks, play areas, markets and community centres.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/news-pakistans-punjab-builds-model-villages-to-withstand-disasters/?loclang=en_gb ''NEWS: Pakistan’s Punjab builds model villages to withstand disasters''], [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 17 December 2013.</ref>

===Political effects===
The floods' aftermath was thought likely contribute to public perception of inefficiency and to [[Riot|political unrest]]. These political effects of the floods were compared with that of the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]]. The scepticism within the country extended to outside donors. Less than 20% of the pledged aid was scheduled to go through the government, according to Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, with the remainder flowing through non-governmental organisations.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11200179 |work=BBC News | title=How to fix flood-hit Pakistan | date=7 September 2010| accessdate= 10 February 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110126041553/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11200179| archivedate= 26 January 2011| url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.care2.com/causes/global-warming/blog/top-5-facts-to-know-about-pakistan-flood-crisis/ |title=Top 5 Shocking Facts About The Pakistan Floods |publisher=Care2.com |accessdate=5 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Hassani |first=Reem |url=http://www.businesstoday.org/online-journal/pakistan-flood-political-and-economic-disaster |title=Pakistan: A Flood of Political and Economic Disaster |publisher=Business Today |date=28 August 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213010113/http://businesstoday.org/online-journal/pakistan-flood-political-and-economic-disaster |archivedate=13 December 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pakalertpress.com/2010/08/18/alert-pakistan-flood-crisis-raises-fears-of-countrys-collapse/ |title=Alert: Pakistan flood crisis raises fears of country's collapse |publisher=Pakalert Press |accessdate=5 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028094332/http://www.pakalertpress.com/2010/08/18/alert-pakistan-flood-crisis-raises-fears-of-countrys-collapse/ |archivedate=28 October 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://despardes.com/?p=17634 |title=Geopolitical Consequences of Pakistan's Floods &#124; DesPardes.com &#124; Breaking News&#124;Latest News&#124;India News &#124;Pakistan News&#124;Politics News &#124;Bollywood News&#124;Cinema News&#124;Hollywood News&#124;Cricket&#124;Business News&#124;Sports News&#124;Health News&#124;Science & Technology News&#124;Stock Market News |publisher=DesPardes.com |date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101121214142/http://despardes.com/?p=17634| archivedate= 21 November 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://floodsinpakistan.com/?p=414 |title=Top 5 Shocking Facts About The Pakistan Floods « Floods in Pakistan, 2010 &gt; Latest Updates on Floods by Techure Foundation UK |publisher=Floodsinpakistan.com |accessdate=5 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711010701/http://floodsinpakistan.com/?p=414 |archive-date=11 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://krepon.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/2855/the-flood#more-462 |title=Michael Krepon • The Flood |publisher=Krepon.armscontrolwonk.com |date=14 September 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104214705/http://krepon.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/2855/the-flood#more-462 |archivedate=4 January 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The government's response was complicated by insurgencies (in [[Balochistan]] and Waziristan), growing urban sectarian discord, increasing suicide bombings against core institutions and relations with India.<ref>Cohen, Stephen P.

The loss of over 10 million head of livestock along with the loss of other crops would reduce agricultural production by more than 15%. [[Indus Motors Company|Toyota]] and [[Unilever Pakistan]] said that the floods would sap growth, necessitating production cuts as people coped with the destruction. Parvez Ghias, the chief executive of Pakistan's largest automotor manufacturer [[Indus Motors Company|Toyota]], described the economy's state as "fragile". Nationwide car sales were predicted to fall as much as 25%, forcing automakers to reduce production in October–2010 from the prior level of 200 cars per day. Milk supplies fell by 15%, which caused the retail price of milk to increase by Pk Rs 4 (5 US cents) per litre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://makanaka.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/economic-impacts-of-pakistan-floods/|title=Economic impacts of Pakistan floods|work=Resources Research}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/pakistan/100826/pakistan-floods-illustrate-consequences-climate-change |title=Pakistan &#124; Floods &#124; Climate Change |publisher=Globalpost.com |accessdate=5 December 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101130072426/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/pakistan/100826/pakistan-floods-illustrate-consequences-climate-change| archivedate= 30 November 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-08-20/toyota-unilever-pakistan-say-floods-may-sap-growth.html |title=Toyota, Unilever Pakistan Say Floods May Sap Growth |work=BusinessWeek |date=20 August 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2010}}</ref>

Accomplishing this objective required enabling the country's capacity to deal with floods and watershed management in a holistic manner by developing around three inter-related pillars i.e. strategic augmenting of flood forecasting and hazard maps, data sharing platforms, and capacity development. These pillars were further divided into five components which incorporated short-term and medium-term interventions to provide the much needed support for immediate strengthening of early warning systems, while building on lessons learned from the 2010 floods to address the long-term forecasting, disaster management and data sharing issues.

===Neglect of minorities===
It was reported that members of Pakistan's [[Ahmadiyya]] community, who were caught up in floods in [[Muzaffargarh]], were not rescued from their homes because rescuers felt that Muslims must be given priority.

Members of the [[Sikh]] community, who arrived at [[gurdwara]]s in [[Lahore]], also complained of government apathy.
