'''Linda Rose Tripp''' ([[née]] '''Carotenuto'''; November 24, 1949 – April 8, 2020) was an American [[civil servant]] who played a prominent role in the [[Clinton–Lewinsky scandal]] of 1998. Tripp's action in secretly recording [[Monica Lewinsky]]'s confidential phone calls about her relationship with President [[Bill Clinton]] caused a sensation with their links to the earlier ''[[Clinton v. Jones]]'' lawsuit and with the disclosing of intimate details. Tripp claimed that her motives were purely patriotic, and she was able to avoid a wiretap charge in exchange for handing in the tapes. She then claimed that her firing from [[the Pentagon]] at the end of the Clinton administration was vindictive, while the administration called it standard procedure for a political appointee. From 2004, Tripp and her husband, Dieter Rausch, owned and ran a year-round holiday store called The Christmas Sleigh in [[Middleburg, Virginia]].<!-- No need for citations in the summary. Citations go below in the body of the article. -->

==Early life and career==
Tripp was born Linda Rose Carotenuto in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. She was the daughter of Albert Carotenuto, a high school math and science teacher, and his wife, Inge, a German woman whom he met when he was an American soldier stationed in Germany. They divorced in 1968 after he had an affair with a fellow teacher. She graduated from [[Hanover Park High School]] in [[East Hanover, New Jersey]] in 1968 and then worked as a secretary in Army Intelligence at [[Fort Meade, Maryland]]. In 1971, she married Bruce Tripp, a military officer with whom she had a son and a daughter. They divorced in 1990.<ref name="NYT obit"/>

Tripp transferred to [[the Pentagon]] in 1987.{{cn|date=April 2020}} She was a [[White House]] employee in the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|George H. W. Bush administration]], and kept her job when [[Bill Clinton]] became president in 1993.<ref name="NYT obit"/> During the summer of 1994, senior White House aides wanted Tripp removed from the White House, so they arranged a job for her in the public affairs office in the Pentagon, which gave her a raise of $20,000 per year.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Goldstein |first=Amy |last2=Sanchez |first2=Rene |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/tripp020798.htm |title=Tripp's Curious Path to the Pentagon |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 7, 1998 |page=A12 |access-date=October 9, 2007}}</ref>

==Involvement in the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal==
Tripp became a close confidante of [[Monica Lewinsky]], another former White House employee, while they both worked in the Pentagon's public affairs office.<ref name="NYT obit"/> According to Tripp, who was about 24 years older than Lewinsky, they knew one another for a year and a half before the scandal began to reach its critical stage. After Lewinsky revealed to Tripp that she had been in a physical relationship with President Clinton, Tripp, acting on the advice of literary agent [[Lucianne Goldberg]], began to secretly record phone conversations with Lewinsky while encouraging Lewinsky to document details of her relationship with the president.<ref name="NYT obit"/>

In August 1997, [[Michael Isikoff]] from ''Newsweek'' reported that Tripp said that she had encountered [[Kathleen Willey]] coming out of the [[Oval Office]] "disheveled", that "her face red and her lipstick was off." Willey alleged that Clinton groped her. Clinton's lawyer [[Robert S. Bennett]] said in the ''Newsweek'' article "Linda Tripp is not to be believed."<ref>{{cite magazine |author1-link=Michael Isikoff |last1=Isikoff |first1=Michael |last2=Thomas |first2=Evan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/nwcover012698b.htm |title=Clinton and the Intern |magazine=[[Newsweek]] |date=February 2, 1998 |access-date=October 9, 2007}}</ref>

In January 1998, Tripp gave the tapes to [[independent counsel]] [[Kenneth Starr]] in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Tripp disclosed to Starr that she was aware of the relationship between Lewinsky and Clinton, that Lewinsky had submitted a false affidavit denying the relationship to the federal court in Arkansas in the ''[[Clinton v. Jones]]'' lawsuit, and that Lewinsky had attempted to [[Subornation of perjury|suborn]] Tripp's perjury in that suit to conceal what she knew of the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship and of Kathleen Willey from the federal court. As Tripp explained, she was being solicited to commit a crime to conceal evidence in the Jones civil rights case.<ref name=LarryKing>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/16/tripp.transcript/ Transcript: Linda Tripp on 'Larry King Live'], ''[[CNN]]'', February 16, 1999. Accessed October 9, 2007.</ref> Jones’ lawsuit, initially filed in April 1994 through her attorneys Joseph Cammarata and Gilbert K. Davis, eventually resulted in the landmark [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''Clinton v. Jones'' which held that a sitting president of the United States does not have immunity against civil lawsuits for acts done before taking office, and unrelated to the office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/520/681/|title=Clinton v.

Ark. 1994)|website=Justia Law}}</ref>

Tripp also informed Starr of the existence of a navy blue dress that Lewinsky owned that was soiled with Clinton's semen. During their friendship, Lewinsky had shown the dress to Tripp and said she intended to have it dry-cleaned; Tripp convinced her not to have it cleaned.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lewinsky-tripp-vetoed-dry-cleaner/ |title=Lewinsky: Tripp Vetoed Dry Cleaner |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |work=[[CBS News]] |date=September 21, 1998}}</ref>

Based on Tripp's tapes, Starr obtained approval from Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] and the special court overseeing the independent counsel to expand Starr's investigation into the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship, looking for potential incidents of perjury, to investigate Lewinsky for perjury and suborning perjury as a witness in the lawsuit [[Paula Jones]] had brought against Clinton.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/text012998.htm |title=Text of Reno's Petition for Starr |date=January 29, 1998 |accessdate=May 1, 2008 | work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

Tripp also told Starr that she had evidence directly linking the White House to the [[Travelgate]], [[Filegate]], and [[1996 United States campaign finance controversy|Chinagate]] affairs, but Starr chose not to act on that, preferring to pursue the sex-related allegations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Tripp maintained that she acted out of "patriotic duty." Tripp also claimed that she taped Lewinsky out of self-defense because she feared retaliation from the Clinton administration, also claiming Lewinsky had assured President Clinton that she had told only Tripp about their affair (which was untrue), thus making her a target since she refused to go along with perjuring herself to protect Lewinsky and the president.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Eventually both Clinton and Lewinsky had to appear before a [[grand jury]] to answer questions, but Clinton appeared via [[closed circuit television]]. At the conclusion of Lewinsky's interrogation, the jurors offered Lewinsky the chance to offer any last words. "I hate Linda Tripp," she said.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/09/22/tripp/ |title=What goes around comes around?

===Indictment by the state of Maryland===
Tripp was a resident of Hickory Ridge, Columbia, Maryland, at the time she made her surreptitious recordings of the conversations with Lewinsky, and 49 Democrats in the Maryland Legislature signed a letter to the state prosecutor demanding that Tripp be prosecuted under Maryland's wiretap law.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Susan |last1=Schmidt |first2=Paul W. |last2=Valentine |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/starr072398.htm |title=Grand Jury Hears Currie; Official Defends Tripp Probe |accessdate=May 1, 2008 |date=July 23, 1998 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref> Before the trial, the state court ruled that because of the immunity agreements which the independent counsel's office entered into with Tripp, Lewinsky, and others, a substantial amount of the evidence which the prosecution intended to use was inadmissible.<ref>{{cite book | access-date = April 9, 2020 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BsxTEuUCFwsC&q=tripp+maryland+inadmissible&pg=PA25 | page= 25 | title = Ratting: The Use and Abuse of Informants in the American Justice System | first = Robert M. | last = Bloom | date= 2002 | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn = 9780275968182}}</ref>

At a pre-trial hearing, the prosecution called Lewinsky as a witness to try to establish her testimony against Tripp was untainted by the independent counsel's investigation. However, the Maryland state court ruled Lewinsky, who "admitted that she lied under oath in a federal proceeding and has stated that lying has been a part of her life," was not credible and Lewinsky's proposed testimony against Tripp was "bathed in impermissible taint." As a result, all charges against Tripp were dismissed on May 26, 2000 when the prosecution decided not to proceed with the trial of the case.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lewis |first1=Neil A. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/06/us/judge-allows-maryland-to-proceed-in-tripp-case.html |title=Judge Allows Maryland To Proceed in Tripp Case |work=The New York Times |date=May 6, 2000 |accessdate=November 28, 2018}}</ref>

===Arrest record controversy===
Tripp had been arrested in 1969 when she was 19 years old in Greenwood Lake, New York on charges of stealing $263 in cash as well as a wristwatch worth about $600. The charges were dismissed before coming to trial.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/14/tripp.lewinsky/ |date=March 14, 1998 |accessdate=May 1, 2008 |title=Report: Tripp Didn't Disclose Arrest On Pentagon Job Form |work=CNN}}</ref> Years later, Tripp answered "no" to the question "Have you ever been either charged or arrested for a crime?" on her form for a [[United States Department of Defense]] security clearance.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/06/29/tripp.bio/ |title=Tripp: No Stranger to Controversy |date=June 29, 1998 |work=CNN |access-date=October 14, 2015}}</ref> In March 1998, shortly before Tripp was scheduled to appear before the grand jury in the Lewinsky investigation, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs [[Kenneth Bacon]] and his deputy Clifford Bernath leaked how Tripp had answered that question to [[Jane Mayer]] of ''The New Yorker''. The Department of Defense then leaked other confidential information from Tripp's personnel and security files to the news media. The Department of Defense inspector general investigated these leaks and found that Bacon and Bernath violated the Privacy Act of 1974, and the United States Department of Defense inspector general concluded both Bacon and Bernath should have known the release of information from Tripp's security file was improper.<ref>{{cite news |last=Becker |first=Elizabeth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/26/us/2-officials-rebuked-for-tripp-disclosures.html |title=2 Officials Rebuked for Tripp Disclosures |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 26, 2000 |access-date=November 12, 2007}}</ref>

===Termination from government employment===
On January 19, 2001, the last full day of the Clinton Administration, Tripp was fired from her job in the Pentagon.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/19/tripp.fired.03/index.html |title=Linda Tripp, like many others, loses federal job |work=[[CNN]] |date=January 19, 2001 |accessdate=February 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207191131/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/19/tripp.fired.03/index.html |archivedate=December 7, 2004}}</ref> Tripp claimed that the firing was vindictive, but the Clinton administration said that all political appointees such as Tripp are normally asked to submit their resignation when a new administration takes over.<ref>{{cite news |title=U.S. ambassadors appointed by Obama must quit by Inauguration Day |work=[[Reuters]] |date=January 6, 2017 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-diplomats/u-s-envoys-appointed-by-obama-denied-extensions-past-inauguration-day-new-york-times-idUSKBN14Q0DU |access-date=November 15, 2017 |quote=... leave the government on schedule, just as thousands of political aides at the White House and in federal agencies must do.}}</ref>{{Failed verification |reason=Describes what happened in 2017, not what happened in 2001. |date=April 2020}} Those who refuse to do so may be fired.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

===Lawsuit and settlement===
Tripp sued the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the Justice Department for releasing information from her security file and employment file to the news media in violation of the [[Privacy Act of 1974]]. On November 3, 2003, Tripp reached a settlement with the federal government.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McDonough |first1=Siobhan |url=https://apnews.com/78765b8bb4ab3ba19f8cf958943a93e6 |title=Defense Department settles with Linda Tripp |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 3, 2003}}</ref> The settlement included a one-time payment of more than $595,000, a retroactive promotion, and retroactive pay at the highest salary for 1998, 1999, and 2000. She also received a pension and was cleared to work for the federal government again. Her rights to remain part of a class action against the government were preserved.<ref name="transcript">{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0312/01/lkl.00.html |title=CNN Larry King Live Interview With Linda Tripp |work=CNN |date=December 1, 2003}}</ref>

==Later years==
Tripp married German architect Dieter Rausch in 2004.<ref name="NYT obit">{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/linda-tripp-dead.html |title = Linda Tripp, Key Figure in Clinton Impeachment, Dies|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = April 8, 2020|last1 = Gates|first1 = Anita|last2 = Seelye|first2 = Katharine Q.}}</ref> They lived in [[Middleburg, Virginia]], where they owned and operated a German winter-themed holiday store called the Christmas Sleigh.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.middleburglife.com/come-experience- | access-date = April 9, 2020 | title = Christmas Sleigh | website= Middleburg Life}}</ref>

In an appearance with [[Larry King]] on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' on December 1, 2003, Tripp talked about living with [[breast cancer]]. On the subject of her successful invasion of privacy lawsuit against the federal government, Tripp claimed that she actually came out behind financially because of attorneys' fees and the derailment of her government career. She also claimed that her violations of Lewinsky's privacy and the Clinton administration's violations of her privacy were not equivalent as the Clinton administration's leaking of her employment history was illegal, noting that although her wiretapping was also illegal, she was able to avoid prosecution for such by accepting immunity in exchange for her testimony.<ref name="transcript"/>

In 2018, Tripp said that "she was the victim of 'a real high-tech lynching.'"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Andrews-Dyer |first1=Helena |title=Linda Tripp says she was the victim of 'a real high-tech lynching' in first public address since 2000 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2018/07/30/linda-tripp-says-she-was-the-victim-of-a-real-high-tech-lynching-in-first-public-address-since-2000/ |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 30, 2018}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
Tripp was portrayed by [[John Goodman]] in recurring ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketches. Tripp had mixed feelings about the impression, saying she enjoyed most of the sketches, but mentioning that at least one had hurt her feelings.<ref name=LarryKing />

In the television series ''[[American Crime Story#Impeachment|Impeachment: American Crime Story]]'', slated to air in late 2020, Tripp will be portrayed by [[Sarah Paulson]].<ref name="Vanity Fair ACS Sarah Paulson">{{Cite web | url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/photos/2020/01/american-crime-story-impeachment-clinton-lewinsky-photos | title=The American Crime Story: Impeachment Cast and Their Real-Life Counterparts |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | date= January 20, 2020 | first = Yohana | last = Desta | access-date = April 9, 2020}}</ref>
