==History==
[[File:FirstPizzaHut.jpg|thumb|left|The first Pizza Hut (pictured) opened on June 15, 1958, in [[Wichita, Kansas]].]]
Pizza Hut was founded on May 31, 1958 by two [[Wichita State University]] students, brothers Dan and Frank Carney, as a single location in [[Wichita, Kansas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Pizza_Hut_Inc.aspx |title=History of Pizza Hut |publisher=encyclopedia.com |accessdate=October 12, 2015}}</ref> Six months later they opened a second outlet and within a year they had six Pizza Hut restaurants. The brothers began franchising in 1959. The iconic Pizza Hut building style was designed in 1963 by Chicago architect George Lindstrom<ref>Andrew F.

On June 25 and 27, 2019, it was reported that Pizza Hut was bringing back their logo and the red roof design that was used from 1976 until 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pizza-hut-brings-back-old-logo-2019-6|last=De Luce|first=Ivan|date=June 27, 2019|title=Pizza Hut is rebooting its iconic 'red roof' logo with a retro design|work=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/25/business/pizza-hut-new-logo/index.html|last=Valinsky |first=Jordan |date=June 25, 2019|title=Pizza Hut brings back its retro logo|work=[[CNN Business]]|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>

In March 2020, several Pizza Hut locations in [[Western New York]] temporarily closed due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. On July 22, 2020, a statement was released by a company spokesperson from Pizza Hut saying that all 17 locations in the area have closed. The statement said, "As a result of 17 Pizza Hut dine-in restaurants in Western New York initially closing temporarily due to COVID-19 restrictions, the local franchisee made the decision to permanently close these stores. However, Pizza Hut has new franchisees coming into the New York region, and we are hopeful we will be able to serve our customers in this area again in the future."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-22|title=17 Western New York Pizza Hut locations permanently close|url=https://www.wivb.com/news/local-news/buffalo/western-new-york/all-western-new-york-pizza-hut-locations-permanently-close/|website=News 4 Buffalo|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Concept==
[[File:Pizza Hut Athens OH USA.JPG|right |thumb|The distinctive roof shape and lettering style shown here were typical of U.S. Pizza Huts. (This location in [[Athens, Ohio]], pictured in 2009, closed in 2013.)]]
Pizza Hut is split into several different restaurant formats: the original family-style dine-in locations; storefront delivery and carry-out locations; and hybrid locations that have carry-out, delivery, and dine-in options. Some full-size Pizza Hut locations have a lunch buffet, with "all-you-can-eat" pizza, salad, desserts, and breadsticks, and a pasta bar. Pizza Hut has other business concepts independent of the store type.

In 1975, Pizza Hut began testing concepts with Applegate's Landing.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dining down memory lane|url=https://www.kansas.com/entertainment/restaurants/article1036797.html|last=Neil|first=Denise|date=June 18, 2010|website=The Wichita Eagle|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trademark.trademarkia.com/applegates-landing-73083225.html|title=APPLEGATE'S LANDING Trademark of Pizza Hut, Inc. Serial Number: 73083225 :: Trademarkia Trademarks|website=trademark.trademarkia.com}}</ref> These restaurants had exteriors that looked like Colonial Style houses and had eclectic interiors featuring a truck with a salad bar in the bed. The chain offered much of the same Italian-American fare, such as pizza and pasta dishes with some additions like hamburgers and bread pudding. Applegate's Landing went defunct in the mid-1980s except for one location in McPherson, Kansas that closed in fall, 1995.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://roadsideks.wordpress.com/2013/06/16/pa-applegate-has-left-the-building/|title=Pop Applegate has Left the Building|date=June 16, 2013}}</ref>

An upscale concept was unveiled in 2004, called Pizza Hut Italian Bistro. At 50 U.S. locations, the Bistro is similar to a traditional Pizza Hut, except that the menu features new, Italian-themed dishes such as [[penne]] pasta, chicken pomodoro, and toasted sandwiches.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_14_39/ai_n13593323 |date=April 4, 2005 |title=Pizza Hut licensee opens 'Italian bistro' concept |work=Nation's Restaurant News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502024746/http://www.pizzahut.com/Menu.aspx?tab=signatureCrusts |archivedate=May 2, 2007 }}</ref> Instead of black, white, and red, Bistro locations feature a burgundy and tan motif.<ref name="news-press">{{cite web|url=http://www.news-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070309/COLUMNISTS37/703090323/1061/ENT07 |title=Three tomatoes to a capable Pizza Hut 'Bistro' |author=Jean Le Boeuf |date=March 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502024746/http://www.pizzahut.com/Menu.aspx?tab=signatureCrusts |archivedate=May 2, 2007 }}</ref> Pizza Hut Bistros still serve the chain's traditional pizzas and sides. In some cases, Pizza Hut has replaced a red roof location with the new concept. Pizza Hut Express locations are fast food restaurants; They offer a limited menu with many products not seen at a traditional Pizza Hut. These stores are often paired in a [[Colocation (business)|colocation]] with [[WingStreet]], in USA and Canada, or other sibling brands such as [[KFC]] or [[Taco Bell]] and found on college campuses, food courts, theme parks, bowling alleys, and within stores such as [[Target Corporation|Target]].

Vintage locations featuring the red roof, designed by architect Richard D. Burke, can be found in the United States and Canada; several exist in the UK, Australia, and Mexico. In his book ''Orange Roofs, Golden Arches'', Phillip Langdon wrote that the Pizza Hut red roof architecture "is something of a strange object – considered outside the realm of significant architecture, yet swiftly reflecting shifts in popular taste and unquestionably making an impact on daily life. These buildings rarely show up in architectural journals, yet they have become some of the most numerous and conspicuous in the United States today."<ref>''Orange Roofs, Golden Arches: The Architecture of American Chain Restaurants'' By Phillip Langdon. Pp. 99, 189. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1986.</ref>

''Curbed.com'' reports, "Despite Pizza Hut's decision to discontinue the form when they made the shift toward delivery, there were still 6,304 traditional units standing as of 2004, each with the shingled roofs and [[trapezoidal]] windows signifying equal parts suburban comfort and strip-mall anomie." This building style was common in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The name "red roof" is somewhat anachronistic now, since many locations have brown roofs. Dozens of these restaurants have closed or been relocated or rebuilt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curbed.com/archives/2014/01/02/how-sitdown-pizza-huts-created-a-corporate-vernacular-architecture.php|title=This Transnational Survey of Old Pizza Huts is So Satisfying|work=Curbed National|first=Spencer|last=Peterson|date=January 2, 2014}}</ref>

Many of the older locations with the red roof design have beer if not a full bar, music from a [[jukebox]], and sometimes an arcade. In the mid-1980s, the company moved into other formats, including delivery or carryout and the fast food "Express" model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://muypizzas.com/the-food/|title=The Food|website=MUY Pizzas}}</ref>

Savio S. Chan (陳少宏, Pinyin: ''Chén Shàohóng'') and Michael Zakkour, authors of ''[[China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell it to Them]]'', stated middle-class Chinese perceive Pizza Hut as "akin to fine dining", though Pizza Hut was "China's largest and most successful foreign casual-dining chain".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTfxAwAAQBAJ&q=%22China%27s+largest+and+most+successful+foreign+casual-dining+chain%22&pg=PA96|title=China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell it to Them|first1=Savio|last1=Chan|first2=Michael|last2=Zakkour|date=September 3, 2014|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|via=Google Books|isbn=9781118905906}}</ref>

==Products==
In North America, Pizza Hut has notably sold: pan pizza, baked in a pan with a crispy edge; stuffed crust pizza, with the outermost edge wrapped around a cylinder of mozzarella cheese; "hand-tossed", more like traditional [[pizzeria]] crusts; “Thin 'N Crispy”, a thin, crisp dough which was Pizza Hut's original style; Dippin' Strips pizza, a pizza cut into small strips that can be dipped into a number of sauces; the P’Zone, a [[calzone]] with a marinara dipping sauce that comes in plain, Supremo, Meaty, and pepperoni, and its largest product, the Bigfoot pizza.

The stuffed-crust pizza was introduced on March 26, 1995.

==Advertising==

===United States===
Pizza Hut's first television commercial was produced in 1965 by Bob Walterscheidt for the Harry Crow agency in Wichita, and was entitled "Putt Putt to the Pizza Hut". The ad looks just like an old movie, and set in fast motion. It features a man in a business suit and tie, played by Ron Williams, who was then a production manager for Wichita's ABC affiliate [[KAKE-TV]], as he starts ordering take-out, leaves his house, and gets into his 1965 Mustang JR by driving to Pizza Hut, where he is chased by a variety of townspeople, portrayed by neighborhood kids, Walterscheidt and his daughter, and various employees for Harry Crow and KAKE-TV. He goes inside Pizza Hut by picking up his pizza, and gets back in the 1965 Mustang Jr to return home. They went eating all the pizza except the man who ordered it, which makes the man very upset, as he calls Pizza Hut again. The ad first aired on November 19, 1966, during halftime of the [[1966 Notre Dame vs. Michigan State football game|Notre Dame vs. Michigan State "Game of the Century"]], and dramatically increased sales for the franchise. "Putt Putt to the Pizza Hut" ran on TV for eight years and was nominated for a [[Clio Award]].<ref>{{cite AV media |people= |date= February 24, 2008|title= Putt Putt to the Pizza Hut|trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPpc4rY8iMI|access-date= December 2, 2015|format= [[YouTube]]|time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jrcentral.com/forum/general/index.cgi?noframes;read=775 |title=Background on the Pizza Hut Commercial |publisher=JR Central |date=February 28, 2008 |accessdate=December 2, 2015}}</ref>

Until early 2007, Pizza Hut's main [[advertising slogan]] was "Gather 'round the good stuff".<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.brandeating.com/2014/06/feature-a-look-at-recent-fast-food-slogan-changes.html|title=Feature: A Look at Recent Fast Food Slogan Changes}}</ref> From 2008 to 2009, the advertising slogan was "Now You're Eating!".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/the-15-greatest-fast-food-slogans-of-all-time-burger-king-mcdonald-s-and-more|title=The 15 greatest fast-food slogans of all time|first=Kevin|last=Alexander|website=Thrillist}}</ref> From 2009 to 2012, the advertising slogan was "Your Favorites.

Pizza Hut does not have an official international mascot, but at one time, a series of commercials in the U.S. aired, titled "[[The Pizza Head Show]]". These commercials ran from 1991 to 1999 and was created by Walter Williams, creator of the [[Mr. Bill]] sketches from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the late 1970s - upon which the ad campaign was based. The ads featured a slice of pizza with a face made out of toppings called "Pizza Head". In the 1970s, Pizza Hut used the signature red roof with a jolly man named "Pizza Hut Pete". Pete was on the bags, cups, balloons, and hand puppets for the kids. In Australia during the mid to late 1990s, the advertising mascot was a delivery boy named Dougie, with boyish good looks, who upon delivering pizza to his father, would hear the catchphrase "Here's a tip: be good to your mother". Adding to the impact of these advertisements, the role of Dougie was played by famous Australian soap opera and police drama actor [[Diarmid Heidenreich]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Pizza Hut sponsored the film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989) and offered a free pair of futuristic sunglasses, known as "Solar Shades", with the purchase of Pizza Hut pizza. Pizza Hut also engaged in [[product placement]] within the film, having a futuristic version of their logo with their trademarked red hut printed on the side of a [[mylar]] dehydrated pizza wrapper in the McFly family dinner scene, and appear on a storefront in [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley]] in the year 2015.<ref>{{cite AV media |people= |date= February 11, 2008|title= Pizza Hut commercial with Back to the Future theme|trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_EFGMyfYoc|access-date= December 16, 2011|format= [[YouTube]]|time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>

The 1990 [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game]]'', came with a coupon for a free pizza. The game included Pizza Hut [[product placement]] in the form of background advertisements and pizza that would refill the character's life.

In 1995, 21 years before becoming [[President of the United States]], [[Donald Trump]] and his ex-wife [[Ivana Trump]] appeared in a commercial. The last scene of the commercial showed Ivana asking for the last slice, to which Donald replied, "Actually dear, you're only entitled to half", a play on the couple's recent divorce.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jezebel.com/watch-young-donald-trump-eat-pizza-and-joke-about-divor-1723502119|title=Watch Young Donald Trump Eat Pizza And Joke About Divorce|last=Rothkopf|first=Joanna|work=Jezebel|access-date=March 17, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1995, [[Ringo Starr]] appeared in a Pizza Hut commercial which also featured [[The Monkees]]. A commercial with [[Rush Limbaugh]] dates from the same year, in which he boasts "nobody is more right than me," yet he states for the first time he will do something wrong, which was to participate in Pizza Hut's then "eating pizza crust first" campaign regarding their stuffed-crust pizzas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.monkeeslivealmanac.com/1/post/2017/04/1995-pizza-hut-commercial-with-ringo-starr.html|title=1995 Pizza Hut commercial with Ringo Starr|website=The Monkees Live Almanac}}</ref><Ref>https://retronewser.com/2015/06/29/ringo-starr-appears-in-pizza-hut-commercial-with-three-monkees-20-years-ago-today-june-29-1995/</ref>

In 1999, the announcer says, "The best pizzas under one roof" in the Big New Yorker pizza commercial seen on the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] Pizza Hut Demo Disc 1. Also, in 1999, the game ''[[Crazy Taxi (video game)|Crazy Taxi]]'' for Sega Dreamcast featured Pizza Hut as one of the locations to which players were able to drive and drop off customers. However, in the game's 2010 re-release for [[Xbox Live]] and [[PlayStation Network]], all of the product placement, including the Pizza Hut locations, were removed.<ref name="siliconera">{{cite news|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2010/06/21/no-pizza-hut-tower-records-or-kfc-in-crazy-taxi/ | title=No Pizza Hut, Tower Records Or KFC In Crazy Taxi | work=siliconera | date=June 21, 2010 | accessdate=April 29, 2010}}</ref>

Early 2007 had Pizza Hut move into several more interactive ways of marketing to the consumer. Using mobile-phone SMS technology and their MyHut ordering site, they aired several television commercials (commencing just before the [[Super Bowl]]) containing hidden words that viewers could type into their phones to receive coupons. Other innovative efforts included their "MySpace Ted" campaign, which took advantage of the popularity of social networking, and the burgeoning user-submission marketing movement via their Vice President of Pizza contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retaildive.com/ex/mobilecommercedaily/pizza-hut-scores-super-bowl-sales-touchdown-with-mobile-orders|title=Pizza Hut scores Super Bowl sales touchdown with mobile orders &#124; Retail Dive|website=www.retaildive.com}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
In 1996, as part of Pizza Hut's global advertising strategy using celebrities, [[Formula One]] driver [[Damon Hill]] and BBC motorsport commentator [[Murray Walker]] advertised the stuffed-crust pizza, which parodies Walker's extravagant style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/news-damon-hill-makes-ad-debut-pizza-hut-film/15929|title=NEWS: Damon Hill makes ad debut in Pizza Hut film}}</ref>

Talk show host [[Jonathan Ross]] co-starred in an ad with American model [[Caprice Bourret]]. They advertised the stuffed-crust pizza, with Jonathan Ross saying "stuffed cwust" due to his [[Rhotacism (speech impediment)|rhotacism]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Aiming to be a model singer|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/419518.stm|accessdate=January 5, 2017|publisher=BBC|date=August 17, 1999}}</ref>

Following England's defeat to Germany on penalties in the semifinals of [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro '96]], [[Gareth Southgate]], [[Stuart Pearce]], and [[Chris Waddle]] featured in an advertisement, which shows Southgate wearing a paper bag over his head in shame as he was the one who missed the crucial penalty against Germany. Waddle and Pearce, who both missed penalty kicks at [[1990 FIFA World Cup|World Cup '90]], are ridiculing him, emphasizing the word "miss" at every opportunity. After Southgate finishes his pizza, he takes off his paper bag, heads for the door, and bangs his head against the wall. Pearce responds with, "this time he's hit the post".<ref>{{cite web|title=Gareth Southgate Pizza Hut advert: Watch the England manager's classic Euro '96 paper bag penalty apology|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/gareth-southgate-pizza-hut-advert-watch-the-england-managers-classic-euro-96-paper-bag-penalty-a3408961.html|website=standard.co.uk|accessdate=January 5, 2017}}</ref>

===Russia===

In 1997, former [[Soviet Union]] [[Premier]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and his granddaughter Anastasia Virganskaya starred in a Pizza Hut commercial to raise money for the Perestroyka Archives.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9712/23/gorby.pizza/ |date=December 23, 1997 |newspaper=CNN |title=Gorbachev's pitch for pizza released}}</ref> The ad "obviously exploited the shock value of having a former world leader appear... [and] played on the fact that Gorbachev was far more popular outside Russia than inside it". It was filmed on a multi-million budget with a cinematic quality, including mounting cameras on the Kremlin and shutting down Red Square to get the establishing shots of the square, and dialogue entirely in Russian with English subtitles, to show Pizza Hut as a global brand compared to its American rivals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/28/mikhail-gorbachev-pizza-hut-ad-thanksgiving-miracle/|title=Mikhail Gorbachev's Pizza Hut Thanksgiving Miracle|first=Paul|last=Musgrave}}</ref>

===Pasta Hut===
[[File:84 Charing Cross Road, London.jpg|thumb|A branch of Pizza Hut rebranded as "Pasta Hut" on Charing Cross Road, London, in 2009]]
On April 1, 2008, Pizza Hut in America sent [[email]]s to customers advertising their pasta items. The email (and similar advertising on the company's website) stated: "Pasta so good, we changed our name to Pasta Hut!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huliq.com/55564/pasta-hut-new-name-pizza-hut|title=Pasta Hut Is The New Name For Pizza Hut|publisher=Huliq.com|accessdate=October 11, 2015}}</ref> The name change was a publicity stunt held on [[April Fools' Day]], extending through the month of April, with the company's Dallas headquarters changing its exterior logo to Pasta Hut.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-pasta-hut-080401,0,600012.story|title=Pizza Hut renaming itself Pasta Hut for April Fool's. | work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>
This name change was also used to promote the new Tuscani Pasta line and new Pizza Hut dine-in menu. The first Pasta Hut advertisement shows the original Pizza Hut restaurant being imploded and recreated with a "Pasta Hut" sign.

The program has been criticized by some psychologists on the grounds it may lead to [[overjustification effect|overjustification]] and reduce children's intrinsic interest in reading.<ref name="Flora, S.

A pamphlet produced by the group argued the program promoted junk food to a captive market, made teachers into promoters for Pizza Hut, and undermined parents by making visits to the chain an integral part of bringing up their children to be literate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/28883/pizza-reading-pizza-huts-book-it|title=Pizza for Reading: Pizza Hut's "Book It!"|work=Mental Floss}}</ref> However, a study of the program found participation in the program neither increased nor decreased reading motivation.<ref name="Flora, S.

=={{anchor|Nutrition}}Criticism==
In the United Kingdom, Pizza Hut was criticized in October 2007 for the high salt content of its meals, some of which were found to contain more than twice the daily recommended amount of salt for an adult. The meats that consumers demand for pizza toppings (ham, sausage, bacon, etc.) are, likewise, salty and fatty meats.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7050585.stm|title= Fast food salt levels 'shocking'<!-- Bot generated title --> | date=October 18, 2007 | accessdate=January 6, 2010 | work=BBC News}}</ref>

To meet the [[Food Standards Agency]] 2010 target for salt levels in foods, between 2008 and 2010, the company removed over 15% of salt across its menu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/hccpizzahutsept10.pdf |title=Pizza Hut FSA Commitments 2010/2011 |publisher=Food Standards Agency |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019174650/http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/hccpizzahutsept10.pdf |archivedate=October 19, 2010 }}</ref>
