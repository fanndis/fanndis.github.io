'''Northwood University''' ('''NU''') is a private [[university]] in [[Midland, Michigan]]. Opened in 1959, more than 33,000 people have graduated from the institution.<ref name=HISTORY>[http://www.northwood.edu/aboutus/ Northwood University: About Us-History]</ref>

==History==
Northwood University opened as Northwood Institute in 1959 by Arthur E. Turner and R. Gary Stauffer. One hundred students enrolled at the new school, which was initially located in a 19th-century mansion in [[Alma, Michigan]]. Northwood Institute moved to Midland, Michigan, in 1961.<ref name=PETE>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gUOLgwyEUKAC&pg=PA2104 Peterson's Four-Year Coilleges by Thomson Peterson, page 2101-2104, Northwood University]</ref>

The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] operated a [[seminary]] known as ''West Baden College'' at the former [[West Baden Springs Hotel]], in [[Orange County, Indiana]], from 1934 until June 1964, when declining enrollment forced the closure of the facility. They sold the property to a Michigan couple, who in turn donated it to Northwood Institute, which operated a [[satellite campus]] of their business management school under the great dome on the property from 1966 until 1983, when it was closed.<ref name=RESORT>[https://www.frenchlick.com/history French Lick Resort website: History-West Baden Springs Hotel]</ref> During the same time frame during which the Indiana campus was opened, a Northwood facility was also established in Texas, which continues to serve students in the Southwest United States.

In 1982, David E. Fry became president of the school. The Florida residential campus was added and the academic curricula was expanded. The school was accredited by the [[Higher Learning Commission]].<ref name=ACCREDITED>[https://www.hlcommission.org/?option=com_directory&Action=ShowBasic&instid=1356 Higher Learning Commission]</ref>

In 1993, the name was changed from ''Northwood Institute'' to Northwood University and The DeVos Graduate School of Management was created. A joint program with the [[Hotel Institute Montreux]] was established in 2001 to combine Swiss hospitality traditions with American management practices. The school, located in [[Montreux, Switzerland]] was Northwood University's first international venture. University College program centers were expanded for a total of 40 locations in eight states and program centers were begun in [[Bahrain]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Switzerland]].

In October 2007, Keith A. Pretty was named Northwood's third President and CEO. Kent MacDonald became president in 2019.<ref name=meet>{{cite web |last1=Beacom |first1=Ron |last2=News |first2=for the Daily |title=Meet Northwood University's new president |url=https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Meet-Northwood-s-new-president-14375264.php |website=Midland Daily News |date=24 August 2019}}</ref>

In 2014, Northwood announced that it would close its residential operations at its Texas location, while continuing to expand its adult degree program and graduate program there.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wirtz|first=Ralph|title=Northwood closing residential operations in Texas|url=http://www.ourmidland.com/news/northwood-closing-residential-operations-in-texas/article_62412509-9e47-5ecc-b7be-20c233a846fd.html|accessdate=29 March 2014|newspaper=Midland Daily News|date=5 March 2014}}</ref> A year later in 2015, the university sold its Florida location to [[Keiser University]].<ref name=FLSALE>[http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2015/03/18/keiser-university-to-take-over-northwood.html Keiser University to take over Northwood University's West Palm Beach campus]</ref>
