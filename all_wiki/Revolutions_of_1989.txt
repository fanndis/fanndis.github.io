{{History of the Soviet Union}}

The '''Revolutions of 1989''' formed part of a [[revolutionary wave]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s that resulted in the end of communist rule in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and beyond. The period is often also called the '''Fall of Communism'''<ref>{{cite book|author1= Gehler, Michael|author2= Kosicki, Piotr H. |author3= Wohnout, Helmut |title=Christian Democracy and the Fall of Communism|year=2019|publisher= [[Leuven University Press]] |isbn= 9789462702165}}</ref> and sometimes called the '''Fall of Nations''' or the '''Autumn of Nations''',<ref name="NedelmannSztompka1993">{{cite book|author1=Nedelmann, Birgitta|author2=Sztompka, Piotr|title=Sociology in Europe: In Search of Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cOqTuIDuuMMC&pg=PA1|date=1 January 1993|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-013845-0|pages=1–}}</ref><ref name="BernhardSzlajfer2010">{{cite book|author1=Bernhard, Michael|author2=Szlajfer, Henryk|title=From the Polish Underground: Selections from Krytyka, 1978–1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YE29dvVxvdgC&pg=PA221|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04427-9|pages=221–}}</ref><ref name="Luciano2008">{{cite book|author=Luciano, Bernadette|title=Cinema of Silvio Soldini: Dream, Image, Voyage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eBdKQYm4tyYC&pg=PA77|year=2008|publisher=Troubador|isbn= 978-1-906510-24-4|pages=77–}}</ref><ref name="Grofman2001">{{cite book|author=Grofman, Bernard|title=Political Science as Puzzle Solving|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SuIZ0wkeTmIC&pg=PA85|year=2001|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-08723-1|pages=85–}}</ref><ref name="SadurskiCzarnota2006">{{cite book|author=Sadurski, Wojciech|author-link=Wojciech Sadurski|author2=Czarnota, Adam|author3=Krygier, Martin|title=Spreading Democracy and the Rule of Law?: The Impact of EU Enlargemente for the Rule of Law, Democracy and Constitutionalism in Post-Communist Legal Orders|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_c9HAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA285|date=30 July 2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-3842-6|pages=285–}}</ref> a play on the term [[Spring of Nations]] that is sometimes used to describe the [[Revolutions of 1848]].

On 4 June 1989, the trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] won an overwhelming victory in a [[1989 Polish legislative election|partially free election in Poland]], leading to the peaceful [[Fall of communism in Poland|fall of Communism in that country]] in the summer of 1989. Also in June 1989, Hungary began dismantling its section of the physical [[Iron Curtain]]. 

The opening of a border gate between Austria and Hungary at the [[Pan-European Picnic]] on August 19, 1989 then set in motion a peaceful chain reaction, at the end of which there was no longer an [[East Germany]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]] had disintegrated. Due to the inconsistent action of the Eastern European rulers at the Pan-European Picnic, the bracket of the Eastern Bloc was broken. Now the media-informed Eastern Bloc citizens knew that the Iron Curtain was no longer tight and that the power of the authorities was increasingly broken. This led to [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations]] in cities such as [[Leipzig]] and subsequently to the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in November 1989, which served as the symbolic gateway to [[German reunification]] in 1990.

The Soviet Union became a multi-party semi-presidential republic until its [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] in December 1991, resulting in eleven new countries ([[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Moldova]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Uzbekistan]]), which had declared their independence from the Soviet Union in the course of the year, while the [[Baltic states]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]) [[Occupation of the Baltic states|regained]] their independence by September 1991. The rest of the Soviet Union, which constituted the bulk of the area, continued with the establishment of the [[Russian Federation]] in December 1991. [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] abandoned Communism between 1990 and 1992. By 1992, Yugoslavia had [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|split into five new countries]], namely [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Slovenia]] and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was later renamed [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003 and [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|eventually split in 2006]] into two states, [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. Serbia was then further split with the breakaway of the [[International recognition of Kosovo|partially recognized]] state of [[Kosovo]] in 2008. [[Czechoslovakia]] dissolved three years after the [[Velvet Revolution|end of Communist rule]], splitting peacefully into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] on 1 January 1993.<ref>{{citation|contribution-url=http://www.cecl.gr/RigasNetwork/databank/Constitutions/Yugoslavia.html|publisher=CECL|date=27 April 1992|place=[[Greece|GR]]|title=Constitution|contribution=Yugoslavia}}.</ref> The impact of these events was felt in many [[socialist countries]]. Communism was abandoned in countries such as [[People's Republic of Kampuchea#Transition and State of Cambodia (1989–1992)|Cambodia]] (1991), [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] (1990), [[People's Republic of Mongolia|Mongolia]] (which in 1990 [[1990 Mongolian legislative election|democratically re-elected]] a Communist government that ran the country until [[1996 Mongolian legislative election|1996]]) and [[South Yemen]] (1990).

Political reforms were varied, but in only four countries were Communist parties able to retain a monopoly on power, namely [[China]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]], and [[Vietnam]] ([[North Korea]] went through a [[Constitution of North Korea#2009 amendment|constitutional change]] in 2009 that made it nominally no longer Communist, but still ''de facto'' organised on [[Stalinist]] lines). Many communist and socialist organisations in the West turned their guiding principles over to [[social democracy]] and [[democratic socialism]]. Communist parties in [[Italy]] and [[San Marino]] suffered and the [[Mani Pulite|reformation of the Italian political class]] took place in the early 1990s. In contrast, and somewhat later, in [[South America]], a [[Pink tide]] began in [[Venezuela]] in 1999 and shaped politics in other parts of the continent through the early 2000s. The [[Politics of Europe|European political landscape]] changed drastically, with several former Eastern Bloc countries joining [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], resulting in stronger economic and social integration with Western Europe and the [[United States]].

== Background ==
=== Development of the Eastern Bloc ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}
{{further|Eastern Bloc|List of socialist states}}

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 saw the first [[communist state]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), when the [[Bolsheviks]] overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]].

During the period between the world wars, communism had been on the rise in many parts of the world, especially in towns and cities. This led to a series of purges in many countries to stifle the movement. Violent resistance to this repression led to an increase in support for communism in Central and Eastern Europe.

In the early stages of [[World War II]], both Nazi Germany and the USSR invaded and occupied the countries of Eastern Europe after the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. Germany then turned against and invaded the USSR: the battles of this [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] were the largest in history. The USSR joined with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and in conferences at [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]] and [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]], the Allies agreed that Central and Eastern Europe would be in the "Soviet sphere of political influence.". The USSR fought the Germans to a standstill and finally began driving them back, reaching Berlin before the end of the war. Nazi ideology was violently [[anti-communist]], and the Nazis brutally suppressed communist movements in the countries it occupied. Communists played a large part in the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance to the Nazis]] and the [[German resistance to Nazism|resistance to the Nazis by the Germans]] in these countries. As the Soviets forced the Germans back, they assumed temporary control of these devastated areas.

After World War II, the Soviets ensured that communists loyal to Moscow took power in the countries it occupied. The Soviets retained troops throughout these territories. The [[Cold War]] saw these states, bound together by the [[Warsaw Pact]], have continuing tensions with the capitalist west, bound together by [[NATO]]. The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] established communism in [[China]] in 1949.

During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a spontaneous nationwide anti-authoritarian revolt, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary to assert control. Similarly, in 1968, the USSR repressed the [[Prague Spring]] by organizing the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].

=== Emergence of Solidarity in Poland ===
{{main|Solidarity (Polish trade union)}}
Labour turmoil in Poland during 1980 led to the formation of the independent [[trade union]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], led by [[Lech Wałęsa]], which over time became a political force. On 13 December 1981, Polish Prime Minister [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] started a crackdown on Solidarity by declaring [[martial law in Poland]], suspending the union, and temporarily imprisoning all of its leaders.

=== Mikhail Gorbachev ===
{{main|Mikhail Gorbachev|Perestroika|Glasnost|Democratization (Soviet Union)}}
Although several Eastern Bloc countries had attempted some abortive, limited economic and political reform since the 1950s (e.g. the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and [[Prague Spring]] of 1968), the ascension of reform-minded Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in 1985 signaled the trend toward greater liberalization. During the mid-1980s, a younger generation of Soviet [[apparatchiks]], led by Gorbachev, began advocating fundamental reform in order to reverse years of [[Brezhnev stagnation]]. After decades of growth, the Soviet Union was now facing a period of severe economic decline and needed Western technology and credits{{clarify|date=March 2017}} to make up for its increasing backwardness. The costs of maintaining its military, the [[KGB]], and subsidies to foreign client states further strained the moribund [[Soviet economy]].

[[File:President Ronald Reagan greets a young boy while touring Red Square during the Moscow Summit in the USSR.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in Red Square, Moscow, 1988]]
The first signs of major reform came in 1986 when Gorbachev launched a policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) in the Soviet Union, and emphasized the need for ''[[perestroika]]'' (economic restructuring). By the spring of 1989, the Soviet Union had not only experienced lively media debate, but had also held its first multi-candidate elections in the newly established [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]]. While glasnost ostensibly advocated openness and political criticism, these were only permitted within a narrow spectrum dictated by the state. The general public in the Eastern Bloc was still subject to [[secret police]] and [[political repression]].

Gorbachev urged his Central and Southeast European counterparts to imitate ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost'' in their own countries. However, while reformists in Hungary and Poland were emboldened by the force of liberalization spreading from the east, other Eastern Bloc countries remained openly skeptical and demonstrated aversion to reform. Believing Gorbachev's reform initiatives would be short-lived, hardline communist rulers like [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], [[Communist Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]'s [[Todor Zhivkov]], [[Communist Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]]'s [[Gustáv Husák]] and [[Communist Romania|Romania]]'s [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] obstinately ignored the calls for change.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://countrystudies.us/romania/75.htm | contribution = Romania – Soviet Union and Eastern Europe | place = US | publisher = Library of Congress | title = Country studies}}.</ref> "When your neighbor puts up new wallpaper, it doesn't mean you have to too," declared one East German [[politburo]] member.<ref name="Steele">{{Citation | last = Steele | first = Jonathan | title = Eternal Russia: Yeltsin, Gorbachev and the Mirage of Democracy | place = Boston | publisher = Faber | year = 1994}}.</ref>

=== Soviet republics ===
[[File:USSR Map timeline.gif|thumb|An animated series of maps showing the fall of the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the [[disintegration of the Soviet Union]], which later led to conflicts in the post-Soviet space]]

By the late 1980s, people in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Baltic states]] were demanding more autonomy from [[Moscow]], and the Kremlin was losing some of its control over certain regions and elements in the [[Soviet Union]]. In November 1988, the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] issued a [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|declaration of sovereignty]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-17/news/mn-458_1_soviet-union|title=Parliament in Estonia Declares 'Sovereignty'|work=latimes|date=17 November 1988}}</ref> which would eventually lead to other states making similar declarations of autonomy.

The [[Chernobyl disaster]] in April 1986 had major political and social effects that catalyzed or at least partially caused the revolutions of 1989. One political result of the disaster was the greatly increased significance of the new Soviet policy of [[glasnost]].<ref name="ShlyGlasnost">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00139157.1992.9931445 |title=Chernobyl andGlasnost: The Effects of Secrecy on Health and Safety |year=1992 |last1=Shlyakhter |first1=Alexander |last2=Wilson |first2=Richard |journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=25}}</ref><ref name="PetrynaSarc">{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/can.1995.10.2.02a00030 |title=Sarcophagus: Chernobyl in Historical Light |year=1995 |last1=Petryna |first1=Adriana |journal=Cultural Anthropology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=196–220|s2cid=144062565 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3baa4b94f69420e5289f466cc871ffa246e6ba6 }}</ref> It is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster.

=== Impact of Solidarity grows ===
{{main|Solidarity (Polish trade union)}}
[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|The 20–21 March 1981 issue of ''Wieczór Wrocławia'' (''This Evening in [[Wrocław]]'') shows blank spaces remaining after the government censor pulled articles from page 1 (right, "What happened at [[Bydgoszcz]]?") and from the last page (left, "Country-wide strike alert"), leaving only their titles as the printers—[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity-trade-union]] members—decided to run the newspaper with blank spaces intact. The bottom of page 1 of this master copy bears the hand-written Solidarity confirmation of that decision.]]

Throughout the mid-1980s, [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] persisted solely as an underground organization, supported by the Catholic Church. However, by the late 1980s, Solidarity became sufficiently strong to frustrate [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski's]] attempts at reform, and [[1988 Polish strikes|nationwide strikes in 1988]] forced the government to open dialogue with Solidarity. On 9 March 1989, both sides agreed to a [[bicameral legislature]] called the [[National Assembly (Poland)|National Assembly]]. The already existing [[Sejm]] would become the lower house. The Senate would be elected by the people. Traditionally a ceremonial office, the presidency was given more powers<ref>[http://www.2facts.com Poland:Major Political Reform Agreed], ''Facts on File World News Digest'', 24 March 1989. Facts on File News Services. 6 September 2007</ref> ([[Polish Round Table Agreement]]).

On 7 July 1989, President Mikhail Gorbachev implicitly renounced the use of force against other Soviet-bloc nations. Speaking to members of the 23-nation Council of Europe, Mr. Gorbachev made no direct reference to the so-called [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], under which Moscow had asserted the right to use force to prevent a Warsaw Pact member from leaving the Communist fold. He stated, "Any interference in domestic affairs and any attempts to restrict the sovereignty of states—friends, allies or any others—are inadmissible".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/07/world/gorbachev-spurns-the-use-of-force-in-eastern-europe.html?scp=714&sq=Hungary&st=nyt&gwh=8324637C96A56F9E0671EC017DB71D98 | work=The New York Times | first=James M. | last = Markham | title=Gorbachev spurns the use of force in Eastern Europe | date=7 July 1989}}</ref> The policy was termed the [[Sinatra Doctrine]], in a joking reference to the [[Frank Sinatra]] song "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]". Poland became the first Warsaw Pact country to break free of Soviet domination.

=== Falls of right-wing regimes ===
{{see also|Third Wave Democracy}}
In February 1986, in one of the first peaceful, mass-movement revolutions against a dictatorship, the [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] peacefully overthrew dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and inaugurated [[Cory Aquino]] as president.

The [[domino effect]] of the revolutions of 1989 affected other regimes as well. The [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] regime and [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–1990)|Pinochet's military dictatorship in Chile]] were gradually dismantled during the 1990s as the West withdrew their funding and diplomatic support. [[Ghana]], [[Indonesia]], [[Nicaragua]], [[South Korea]], [[Suriname]], [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), and [[Yemen Arab Republic|North]] and [[South Yemen]], among many others, elected democratic governments.

Exact tallies of the number of democracies vary depending on the criteria used for assessment, but by some measures by the late 1990s there were well over 100 democracies in the world, a marked increase in just a few decades.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

[[File:Kolejka.jpeg|thumb|Queue waiting to enter a store, a typical view in [[Polish People's Republic|Poland in the 1980s]]]]

A [[1988 Polish strikes|wave of strikes]] hit Poland in April and May 1988. A second wave began on 15 August, when a strike broke out at the [[July Manifesto]] coal mine in [[Jastrzębie-Zdrój]], with the workers demanding the re-legalisation of the Solidarity trade union. Over the next few days, sixteen other mines went on strike followed by a number of shipyards, including on 22 August the [[Gdansk Shipyard]], famous as the epicentre of the [[History of Solidarity|1980 industrial unrest]] that spawned Solidarity.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 151}} On 31 August 1988 [[Lech Wałęsa]], the leader of Solidarity, was invited to Warsaw by the Communist authorities, who had finally agreed to talks.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 157}}

On 18 January 1989 at a stormy session of the Tenth Plenary Session of the ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party|United Workers' Party]], General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], the First Secretary, managed to get party backing for formal negotiations with Solidarity leading to its future legalisation, although this was achieved only by threatening the resignation of the entire party leadership if thwarted.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 174}} On 6 February 1989 formal Round Table discussions began in the Hall of Columns in Warsaw. On 4 April 1989 the historic [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Agreement]] was signed legalising Solidarity and setting up partly free [[1989 Polish legislative election|parliamentary elections]] to be held on 4 June 1989 (incidentally, the day following the midnight crackdown on Chinese protesters in Tiananmen Square). A political earthquake followed as the victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the [[Sejm]], while in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (with the one remaining seat taken by an independent candidate). At the same time, many prominent Communist candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them.

On 15 August 1989, the Communists' two longtime coalition partners, the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] (ZSL) and the [[Democratic Party (Poland)|Democratic Party]] (SD), broke their alliance with the PZPR and announced their support for Solidarity.

Following Poland's lead, Hungary was next to switch to a non-Communist government. Although Hungary had achieved some lasting economic reforms and limited political liberalization during the 1980s, major reforms only occurred following the replacement of [[János Kádár]] as General Secretary of the Communist Party on 23 May 1988 with [[Károly Grósz]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/23/world/hungarian-party-replaces-kadar-with-his-premier.html?scp=135&sq=Hungary&st=nyt&gwh=E283E53C9144CEB5DC839A7740A35E80 | work=The New York Times | first=Henry | last=Kamm | title=Hungarian Party replace Kadar with his premier | date= 23 May 1988}}</ref> On 24 November 1988 [[Miklós Németh]] was appointed Prime Minister.

Mass demonstrations on 15 March, the National Day, persuaded the regime to begin negotiations with the emergent non-Communist political forces. [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table talks]] began on 22 April and continued until the Round Table agreement was signed on 18 September. The talks involved the Communists (MSzMP) and the newly emerging independent political forces [[Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Union|Fidesz]], the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SzDSz), the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]] (MDF), the [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|Independent Smallholders' Party]], the [[National Peasant Party (Hungary)|Hungarian People's Party]], the Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky Society, and the Democratic Trade Union of Scientific Workers. At a later stage the [[Democratic Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] and the [[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democratic People's Party]] (KDNP) were invited.{{Sfn | Falk | 2003 | p = 147}} At these talks a number of Hungary's future political leaders emerged, including [[László Sólyom]], [[József Antall]], [[György Szabad]], [[Péter Tölgyessy]] and [[Viktor Orbán]].<ref>{{Citation | first = József | last = Bayer | contribution-url =  http://www.europainstitut.hu/pdf/bayer22.pdf | contribution = The Process of Political System Change in Hungary | title = Schriftenreihe | publisher = Europa Institutes | place = Budapest, [[Hungary|HU]] | year = 2003 | page = 180}}.</ref>

On 2 May 1989, the first visible cracks in the [[Iron Curtain]] appeared when [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] began [[Removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria|dismantling its {{convert |240|km| adj =on}} long border fence]] with Austria.<ref>{{Citation | last = Stokes | first = G | title = The Walls Came Tumbling Down | page = 131 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1993}}.</ref> This increasingly destabilized [[East Germany]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] over the summer and autumn, as thousands of their citizens illegally crossed over to the West through the Hungarian-Austrian border.

The initially inconspicuous opening of a border gate of the [[Iron Curtain]] between Austria and Hungary in August 1989 then triggered a chain reaction, at the end of which the GDR no longer existed and the Eastern Bloc had disintegrated. It was the largest escape movement from East Germany since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. The idea of opening the border came from [[Otto von Habsburg]] and was brought up by him to [[Miklós Németh]], who promoted the idea.<ref name="auto">Miklós Németh in Interview, Austrian TV - ORF "Report", 25 June 2019.</ref> The local organization in Sopron took over the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the other contacts were made via Habsburg and [[Imre Pozsgay]]. Extensive advertising for the planned picnic was made by posters and flyers among the GDR holidaymakers in Hungary. The Austrian branch of the [[Paneuropean Union]], which was then headed by [[Karl von Habsburg]], distributed thousands of brochures inviting them to a picnic near the border at Sopron.<ref>Hilde Szabo: ''Die Berliner Mauer begann im Burgenland zu bröckeln'' (The Berlin Wall began to crumble in Burgenland - German), in Wiener Zeitung 16 August 1999; Otmar Lahodynsky: ''Paneuropäisches Picknick: Die Generalprobe für den Mauerfall'' (Pan-European picnic: the dress rehearsal for the fall of the Berlin Wall - German), in: ''Profil'' 9 August 2014.</ref><ref>Ludwig Greven "Und dann ging das Tor auf", in Die Zeit, 19 August 2014.</ref> After the pan-European picnic, [[Erich Honecker]] dictated the '' Daily Mirror '' of August 19, 1989: “Habsburg distributed leaflets far into Poland, on which the East German holidaymakers were invited to a picnic.

Now tens of thousands of the media-informed East Germans made their way to Hungary, which was no longer ready to keep its borders completely closed or to oblige its border troops to use force of arms. In particular, the leadership of the GDR in East Berlin no longer dared to completely block the borders of their own country.<ref>Michael Frank: Paneuropäisches Picknick – Mit dem Picknickkorb in die Freiheit (German: Pan-European picnic - With the picnic basket to freedom), in: Süddeutsche Zeitung 17 May 2010.</ref><ref> Andreas Rödder, Deutschland einig Vaterland – Die Geschichte der Wiedervereinigung (2009).</ref>

The [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table agreement]] of 18 September encompassed six draft laws that covered an overhaul of the [[Constitution of Hungary|Constitution]], establishment of a [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional Court]], the functioning and management of political parties, multiparty elections for National Assembly deputies, the penal code and the law on penal procedures (the last two changes represented an additional separation of the Party from the state apparatus).{{Sfn | Heenan | Lamontagne | 1999 | p = 13}}{{Sfn | De Nevers | 2003 | p = 130}} The electoral system was a compromise: about half of the deputies would be elected proportionally and half by the majoritarian system.{{Sfn | Elster | Offe | Preuss | 1998 | p = 66}} A weak presidency was also agreed upon, but no consensus was attained on who should elect the president (parliament or the people) and when this election should occur (before or after parliamentary elections).

On 2 May 1989, [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] [[Removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria|started dismantling its barbed-wire border]] with [[Austria]]. The border was still heavily guarded, but it was a political sign.

The Pan-European Picnic in August 1989 finally started a movement that could not be stopped by the rulers in the Eastern Bloc. It was the largest escape movement from East Germany since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. The patrons of the picnic, [[Otto von Habsburg]] and the Hungarian Minister of State [[Imre Pozsgay]] saw the planned event as an opportunity to test the reaction of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and the Eastern Bloc countries to a large opening of the border including flight. After the pan-European picnic, [[Erich Honecker]] dictated the Daily Mirror of August 19, 1989: “Habsburg distributed leaflets far into Poland, on which the East German holidaymakers were invited to a picnic. When they came to the picnic, they were given gifts, food and Deutsche Mark, and then they were persuaded to come to the West.” But with the mass exodus at the Pan-European Picnic, the subsequent hesitant behavior of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the non-intervention of the Soviet Union broke the dams.

By the end of September 1989, more than 30,000 East Germans had escaped to the West before the [[East Germany|GDR]] denied travel to Hungary, leaving [[Czechoslovakia]] as the only neighboring state to which East Germans could escape. Thousands of East Germans tried to reach the West by occupying the West German diplomatic facilities in other Central and Eastern European capitals, notably the [[Prague Embassy]] and the Hungarian Embassy, where thousands camped in the muddy garden from August to November waiting for German political reform. The GDR closed the border to Czechoslovakia on 3 October, thereby isolating itself from all its neighbors. Having been shut off from their last chance for escape, an increasing number of East Germans participated in the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]] in Leipzig on 4, 11, and 18 September, each attracting 1,200 to 1,500 demonstrators. Many were arrested and beaten, but the people refused to be intimidated. On 25 September, the protests attracted 8,000 demonstrators.

After the fifth successive Monday demonstration in Leipzig on 2 October attracted 10,000 protesters, [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) leader [[Erich Honecker]] issued a ''shoot and kill'' order to the military.<ref name = "Pritchard">{{cite book|title=Reconstructing education: East German schools and universities after unification| first = Rosalind MO | last = Pritchard|page =10}}</ref> Communists prepared a huge police, militia, [[Stasi]], and work-combat troop presence, and there were rumors a [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen Square-style massacre]] was being planned for the following Monday's demonstration on 9 October.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Germany, 1918–2000: the divided nation| first =Mary | last = Fulbrook|page = 256}}</ref>

On 6 and 7 October, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] visited East Germany to mark the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic, and urged the East German leadership to accept reform. A famous quote of his is rendered in German as "Wer zu spät kommt, den bestraft das Leben" ("The one who comes too late is punished by life."). However, Honecker remained opposed to internal reform, with his regime even going so far as forbidding the circulation of Soviet publications that it viewed as subversive.

In spite of rumors that the Communists were planning a massacre on 9 October, 70,000 citizens demonstrated in Leipzig that Monday, and the authorities on the ground refused to open fire. The following Monday, 16 October 120,000 people demonstrated on the streets of Leipzig.

Erich Honecker had hoped that the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet troops]] stationed in the GDR by the [[Warsaw Pact]] would restore the communist government and suppress the civilian protests. By 1989 the Soviet government deemed it impractical for the Soviet Union to [[Sinatra Doctrine|continue asserting its control]] over the Eastern Bloc, so it took a neutral stance regarding the events happening in East Germany. Soviet troops stationed in eastern Europe were under strict instructions from the Soviet leadership not to intervene in the political affairs of the Eastern Bloc nations and remained in their barracks. Faced with ongoing civil unrest, the SED deposed Honecker on 18 October and replaced him with the number-two-man in the regime, [[Egon Krenz]]. However, the demonstrations kept growing, and on Monday, 23 October, the Leipzig protesters numbered 300,000 and remained as large the following week.
[[File:BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate.jpg|thumb|[[Berlin Wall]] at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], 10 November 1989]]
The border to Czechoslovakia was opened again on 1 November, and the Czechoslovak authorities soon let all East Germans travel directly to West Germany without further bureaucratic ado, thus lifting their part of the Iron Curtain on 3 November. On 4 November the authorities decided to authorize a demonstration in Berlin and were faced with the [[Alexanderplatz demonstration]], where half a million citizens converged on the capital demanding freedom in the biggest protest the GDR ever witnessed. Unable to stem the ensuing flow of refugees to the West through Czechoslovakia, the East German authorities eventually caved in to public pressure by allowing East German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany directly, via existing border points, on 9 November 1989, without having properly briefed the border guards. Triggered by the erratic words of regime spokesman [[Günter Schabowski]] in a TV press conference, stating that the planned changes were in effect "immediately, without delay," hundreds of thousands of people took advantage of the opportunity. The guards were quickly overwhelmed by the growing crowds of people demanding to be let out into West Berlin. After receiving no feedback from their superiors, the guards, unwilling to use force, relented and [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|opened the gates]] to West Berlin. Soon new crossing points were forced open in the [[Berlin Wall]] by the people, and sections of the wall were literally torn down. The guards were unaware of what was happening and stood by as the East Germans took to the wall with hammers and chisels.

On 7 November, the entire ''Ministerrat der DDR'' ([[State Council of East Germany]]), including its chairman [[Willi Stoph]], resigned.<ref>[[:de:Ministerrat der DDR (1986–1989)]] contains all the members of the Council.</ref> A new government was formed under a considerably more liberal Communist, [[Hans Modrow]].<ref>see also [[:de:Regierung Modrow]]</ref>
On 1 December, the [[Volkskammer]] removed the SED's leading role from the [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|constitution of the GDR]]. 
On 3 December Krenz resigned as leader of the SED; he resigned as head of state three days later. On 7 December, Round Table talks opened between the SED and other political parties. On 16 December 1989, the SED was dissolved and refounded as the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|SED-PDS]], abandoning Marxism-Leninism and becoming a mainstream democratic socialist party.

On 15 January 1990, the Stasi's headquarters was stormed by protesters. Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany until [[1990 East German general election|free elections were held on 18 March 1990]]—the first [[November 1932 German federal election|since November 1932]]. The SED, renamed the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]], was heavily defeated. [[Lothar de Maizière]] of the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|East German Christian Democratic Union]] became Prime Minister on 4 April 1990 on a platform of speedy [[German reunification|reunification]] with the West. The two Germanies were reunified on 3 October 1990.

The [[Government of the Soviet Union|Kremlin's]] willingness to abandon such a strategically vital ally marked a dramatic change by the Soviet superpower and a fundamental [[paradigm shift]] in [[international relations]], which until 1989 had been dominated by the East–West divide running through Berlin itself. The last [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Russian troops]] left the territory of the former GDR, now part of a reunited [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], on 1 September 1994.

The "Velvet Revolution" was a non-violent transition of power in Czechoslovakia from the Communist government to a parliamentary republic. On 17 November 1989, riot police suppressed a peaceful student demonstration in Prague, a day after a similar demonstration passed without incident in Bratislava. Although controversy continues over whether anyone died that night, that event sparked a series of popular demonstrations from 19 November to late December. By 20 November the number of peaceful protesters assembled in Prague had swelled from 200,000 the previous day to an estimated half-million. Five days later, the Letná Square protest held 800,000 people.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.denik.cz/z_domova/demonstrace-na-letne-pred-25-lety-urychlily-kapitulaci-komunistu-20141123.html | title = Demonstrace na letne pred 25 lety urychlily kapitulaci komunistu | language = cs| place = [[Czhec|CZ]] | newspaper = Denik| date = 23 November 2014 }}.</ref> On 24 November, the entire Communist Party leadership, including general secretary [[Miloš Jakeš]], resigned. A two-hour general strike, involving all citizens of Czechoslovakia, was successfully held on 27 November.

With the collapse of other Communist governments, and increasing street protests, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia announced on 28 November 1989 that it would relinquish power and dismantle the single-party state. Barbed wire and other obstructions were removed from the border with West Germany and Austria in early December. On 10 December, President [[Gustáv Husák]] appointed the first largely non-Communist government in Czechoslovakia since 1948, and resigned. [[Alexander Dubček]] was elected speaker of the federal parliament on 28 December and [[Václav Havel]] the President of Czechoslovakia on 29 December 1989. In June 1990 Czechoslovakia held its first democratic elections since 1946. On 27 June 1991 the last Soviet troops were withdrawn from Czechoslovakia.<ref>{{cite news| title=20 Years After Soviet Soldiers Left the Czech Republic, Russians Move In|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2011/06/28/soviet-soldiers-left-czechoslovakia-20-years-ago-ordinary-well-off-russians-to-move-in/ | newspaper= The Wall Street Journal|date=28 June 2011}}</ref>

=== Bulgaria ===
In October and November 1989, demonstrations on ecological issues were staged in Sofia, where demands for political reform were also voiced. The demonstrations were suppressed, but on 10 November 1989 (the day after the Berlin Wall was breached) Bulgaria's long-serving leader [[Todor Zhivkov]] was ousted by his Politburo. He was succeeded by a considerably more liberal Communist, former foreign minister [[Petar Mladenov]]. Moscow apparently approved the leadership change, as Zhivkov had been opposed to Gorbachev's policies. The new regime immediately repealed restrictions on free speech and assembly, which led to the first mass demonstration on 17 November, as well as the formation of anti-communist movements. Nine of them united as the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (UDF) on 7 December.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.sds.bg/about/history | title = History of the UDF | language = bg | publisher = SDS | place = [[Bulgaria|BG]]}}</ref> The UDF was not satisfied with Zhivkov's ouster, and demanded additional democratic reforms, most importantly the removal of the constitutionally mandated leading role of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]].

Mladenov announced on 11 December 1989 that the Communist Party would abandon its monopoly on power, and that multiparty elections would be held the following year. In February 1990, the Bulgarian legislature deleted the portion of the constitution about the "leading role" of the Communist Party. Eventually, it was decided that a round table on the Polish model would be held in 1990 and elections held by June 1990. The round table took place from 3 January to 14 May 1990, at which an agreement was reached on the transition to democracy. The Communist Party abandoned Marxism–Leninism in April 1990 and renamed itself as the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]. In June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held, won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party.

After having suppressed the [[Braşov Rebellion]] in 1987, [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] was re-elected for another five years as leader of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) in November 1989, signalling that he intended to ride out the anti-Communist uprisings sweeping the rest of Europe. As Ceauşescu prepared to go on a state visit to Iran, his [[Securitate]] ordered the arrest and exile of a local Hungarian [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] minister, [[László Tőkés]], on 16 December, for sermons offending the regime. Tőkés was seized, but only after serious rioting erupted. [[Timișoara]] was the first city to react on 16 December and civil unrest continued for five days.

[[File:Civilian with PM Md. 1963 during the Romanian Revolution of 1989.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Armed civilians during the [[Romanian Revolution]]. The revolution was the only violent overthrow of a [[Communist state]] in the [[Warsaw Pact]].]]

Returning from Iran, Ceauşescu ordered a mass rally in his support outside Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest on 21 December. However, to his shock the crowd booed and jeered him as he spoke. Years of repressed dissatisfaction boiled to the surface throughout the Romanian populace and even among elements in Ceauşescu's own government, and the demonstrations spread throughout the country.

At first the security forces obeyed Ceauşescu's orders to shoot protesters. However, on the morning of 22 December, the Romanian military suddenly changed sides. This came after it was announced that defense minister [[Vasile Milea]] had committed suicide after being unmasked as a traitor. Believing Milea had actually been murdered, the rank-and-file soldiers went over virtually ''en masse'' to the revolution.<ref>{{cite publication|last=Cornel|first=Ban|title=Sovereign Debt, Austerity, and Regime Change: The Case of Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania|date=13 December 2012|publisher=East European Politics & Societies|page=34|doi=10.1177/0888325412465513|s2cid=144784730}}</ref> Army tanks began moving towards the Central Committee building with crowds swarming alongside them. The rioters forced open the doors of the Central Committee building in an attempt to capture Ceauşescu and his wife, [[Elena Ceauşescu|Elena]], coming within a few meters of the couple. However, they managed to escape via a helicopter waiting for them on the roof of the building.

Although elation followed the flight of the Ceauşescus, uncertainty surrounded their fate. On Christmas Day, Romanian television showed the Ceauşescus facing a hasty trial, and then being executed by firing squad. An interim [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] Council led by [[Ion Iliescu]] took over and announced elections for April 1990, the first free elections held in Romania since 1937. These were, however, postponed until 20 May 1990. The Romanian Revolution was the bloodiest of the revolutions of 1989: over 1,000 people died, one hundred of which were children, the youngest only one month old. Unlike its kindred parties in the Warsaw Pact, the PCR simply melted away; no present-day Romanian party claiming to be its successor has ever been elected to the legislature since the change of system. However, former PCR members have played significant roles in post-1989 Romanian politics; every [[Romanian President]] until the election of [[Klaus Iohannis]] in [[2014 Romanian presidential election|2014]] was a former Communist Party member.

=== Yugoslavia ===
{{main|Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Wars}}
The [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was not a part of the Warsaw Pact but pursued [[Titoism|its own version]] of Communism under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. It was a multi-ethnic state which Tito was able to maintain through a [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav patriotic doctrine]] of "[[Brotherhood and unity]]". Tensions between ethnicities began to escalate, however, with the [[Croatian Spring]] of 1970–71, a movement for greater [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]]n autonomy, which was suppressed. Constitutional changes were instituted in 1974, and the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] devolved some federal powers to the constituent republics and provinces. After Tito's death in 1980 ethnic tensions grew, first in Albanian-majority [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|SAP Kosovo]] with the [[1981 protests in Kosovo]].

Parallel to the same process, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] initiated a policy of gradual liberalization in 1984, somewhat similar to the Soviet Perestroika. This provoked tensions between the [[League of Communists of Slovenia]] and the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|central Yugoslav Party]] and [[Yugoslav People's Army|federal army]]. In 1984 the decade long ban to build the [[Church of Saint Sava|Saint Sava Cahedral]] in [[Belgrade]] was lifted, the backdown of the communist elite and a popular gathering of 100.000 believers on 12 May 1985 to celebrate liturgy inside the walls of the ruins marked the return of religion in postwar Yugoslavia.<ref>Dunja Predić 2012: How big is all that, really? In: Cultures of Assembly - Architecture + Critical Architerctural Practice. Ständelschule Architecture Class, Frankfurt am Main. [http://criticalspatialpractice.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CSP_Cultures_Of_Assembly_Newspaper_2012.pdf(PDF)]</ref> By the late 1980s, many civil society groups were pushing towards [[democratization]], while widening the space for cultural plurality. In 1987 and 1988, a series of clashes between the emerging civil society and the Communist regime culminated with the so-called [[Slovene Spring]], a mass movement for democratic reforms. The [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]] was established as the platform of all major non-Communist political movements. By early 1989, several anti-Communist political parties were already openly functioning, challenging the hegemony of the Slovenian Communists. Soon, the Slovenian Communists, pressured by their own civil society, came into conflict with the [[League of Communists of Serbia|Serbian Communist]] leadership.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

[[File:Yugoslavia ethnic map.jpg|thumb|[[Ethnic groups in Yugoslavia]] in 1991]]

In January 1990, an extraordinary Congress of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] was called in order to settle the disputes among its constituent parties. Faced with being completely outnumbered, the Slovenian and [[League of Communists of Croatia|Croatian]] Communists walked out of the Congress on 23 January 1990, thus effectively bringing to an end to Yugoslavia's communist party. Both parties of the two western republics negotiated free multi-party elections with their own opposition movements.

On 8 April 1990, the democratic and anti-Yugoslav [[DEMOS coalition]] won the [[1990 Slovenian parliamentary election|elections in Slovenia]], while on 22 April 1990 the [[1990 Croatian parliamentary election|Croatian elections]] resulted in a landslide victory for the nationalist [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) led by [[Franjo Tuđman]]. The results were much more balanced [[1990 Bosnia and Herzegovina parliamentary election|in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[1990 Macedonian parliamentary election|in Macedonia]] in November 1990, while the [[1990 Serbian parliamentary election|parliamentary]] and [[1990 Serbian presidential election|presidential]] elections of December 1990 in Serbia and [[1990 Montenegrin parliamentary election|Montenegro]] consolidated the power of Milošević and his supporters. Free elections on the level of the federation were never carried out.

The Slovenian and Croatian leaderships started preparing plans for secession from the federation, while a part of the [[Serbs of Croatia]] started the so-called [[Log Revolution]], an insurrection organized by [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]] that would lead to the creation of the breakaway region of [[SAO Krajina]]. In the [[1990 Slovenian independence referendum|Slovenian independence referendum]] on 23 December 1990, 88.5% of residents voted for independence.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/slovenian3.pdf |publisher=Sussex |place=UK |title=Slovenian Referendum Briefing No. 3 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218000730/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/slovenian3.pdf |archive-date=18 December 2010 }}</ref> In the [[1991 Croatian independence referendum|Croatian independence referendum]] on 19 May 1991, 93.24% voted for independence.

The escalating ethnic and national tensions were exacerbated by the drive for independence and led to the following [[Yugoslav wars]]:
* [[Ten-Day War|War in Slovenia]] (1991)
* [[Croatian War of Independence]] (1991–1995)
* [[Bosnian War]] (1992–1995)
* [[Kosovo War]] (1998–1999), including the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].

In addition, the [[insurgency in the Preševo Valley]] (1999–2001) and the [[insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia]] (2001) are also often discussed in the same context.{{Sfn | Judah |  2011}}{{Sfn | Naimark | Case | 2003 | p = xvii}}{{Sfn | Rogel | 2004 | pp = 91–92}}

=== Albania ===
{{main|Fall of communism in Albania}} <!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Fall of Communism in Albania.JPG|thumb|left|The fall of Enver Hoxha's Statue in central Tirana on 11 December 1990]] -->
In the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], [[Enver Hoxha]], who led Albania for four decades, died on 11 April 1985. His successor, [[Ramiz Alia]], began to gradually open up the regime from above. In 1989, the first revolts started in [[Shkodra]] and spread in other cities. Eventually, the existing regime introduced some liberalization, including measures in 1990 providing for freedom to travel abroad. Efforts were begun to improve ties with the outside world. March 1991 elections—the first free elections in Albania since 1923, and only the third free elections in the country's history—left the former Communists in power, but a general strike and urban opposition led to the formation of a coalition cabinet including non-Communists. Albania's former Communists were routed in elections held in March 1992, amid [[Albanian Civil War|economic collapse and social unrest]].

=== Mongolia ===
{{main|Mongolian Revolution of 1990}}
Mongolia declared independence in 1911 during the [[Xinhai Revolution|fall]] of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The [[Mongolian People's Party]] [[Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921|took power]] in 1921, and the party renamed itself the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Constitutions of the Communist World|editor-first=William B.|editor-last=Simons|publisher=BRILL|year=1980|isbn=9028600701|pages=256}}</ref> During these years, Mongolia was closely aligned with the Soviet Union. After [[Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal]] left in 1984, the new leadership under [[Jambyn Batmönkh]] implemented economic reforms, but failed to appeal to those who, in late 1989, wanted broader changes.<ref name="Kaplonski" /> The "[[Mongolian Revolution of 1990|Mongolian Revolution]]" was a democratic, [[Nonviolent revolution|peaceful]] revolution that started with demonstrations and [[hunger strike]]s and ended 70-years of [[Marxism-Leninism]] and eventually moved towards democracy. It was spearheaded by mostly younger people demonstrating on [[Sükhbaatar Square]] in the capital [[Ulaanbaatar]]. It ended with the [[authoritarian]] government resigning without bloodshed. Some of the main organizers were [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]], [[Sanjaasürengiin Zorig]], [[Erdeniin Bat-Üül]], and [[Bat-Erdeniin Batbayar]].

During the morning of 10 December 1989, the first public demonstration occurred in front of the Youth Cultural Center in the capital of Ulaanbaatar.<ref>{{cite news|last=G.|first=Dari|title=Democracy Days to be inaugurated|publisher=news.mn (in Mongolian)|url=http://politics.news.mn/content/89237.shtml|accessdate=8 July 2013|date=5 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110172038/http://politics.news.mn/content/89237.shtml|archive-date=10 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> There, Elbegdorj announced the creation of the [[Mongolian Democratic Union]],<ref name="CDMongolia">{{cite web|title=Tsakhia Elbegdorj|publisher=Community of Democracies Mongolia|url=http://cdmongolia.mn/tsakhia-elbegdorj/#.UdovIfmmiAg|accessdate=8 July 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155307/http://cdmongolia.mn/tsakhia-elbegdorj/#.UdovIfmmiAg|archive-date=10 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the first pro-democracy movement in Mongolia began. The protesters called for Mongolia to adopt [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]]. Dissident leaders demanded free elections and economic reform, but within the context of a "human democratic socialism".<ref name="Kaplonski"/> The protesters injected a [[Pan-Mongolism|nationalist element]] into the protests by using traditional [[Mongolian script]]—which most Mongolians could not read—as a symbolic repudiation of the political system which had imposed the [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet]]. In late December 1989, demonstrations increased when news came of [[Garry Kasparov]]'s interview in ''[[Playboy]]'', suggesting that the Soviet Union could improve its economic health by selling Mongolia to China.<ref name="Kaplonski">{{cite book|title=Truth, History, and Politics in Mongolia: The Memory of Heroes|first=Christopher|last=Kaplonski|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|pages=51, 56, 60, 64–65, 67, 80–82|isbn=1134396732}}</ref> On 14 January 1990, the protesters, having grown from three hundred to some 1,000, met in a square in front of Lenin Museum in Ulaanbaatar, which has been named Freedom Square since then.

In November 1991, the People's Great Hural began discussion on a [[Constitution of Mongolia|new constitution]], which entered into force on 12 February 1992. In addition, the new constitution restructured the legislative branch of government, creating a unicameral legislature, the State Great Hural (SGH). The MPRP retained its majority, but lost the 1996 elections. The final Russian troops, which had stationed in Mongolia in 1966, fully withdrew in December 1992.

=== China ===
{{main|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989}}

While China did not undergo a revolution resulting in a new form of government in 1989, a popular national movement led to large demonstrations in favor of democratic reforms. Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1982–1987) had developed the concept of [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]] and enacted local [[Socialist market economy|market economy]] reforms around 1984, but the policy had stalled.<ref>{{Citation | date = 3 February 2012 | url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90780/7719657.html | title = 'Market fundamentalism' is unpractical | newspaper = People's Daily | publisher = Central Committee of the Communist Party | place = [[China|CN]] | accessdate = 13 January 2013}}</ref>

The first Chinese student demonstrations, which eventually led to the Beijing protests of 1989, took place in December 1986 in [[Hefei]]. The students called for campus elections, the chance to study abroad and greater availability of Western pop culture. Their protests took advantage of the loosening political atmosphere and included rallies against the slow pace of reform. [[Hu Yaobang]], a protégé of Deng Xiaoping and a leading advocate of reform, was blamed for the protests and forced to resign as the CCP general secretary in January 1987. In the "Anti Bourgeois Liberalization Campaign", Hu would be further denounced.

The Tiananmen Square protests were sparked by the death of Hu Yaobang on 15 April 1989. By the eve of Hu's state funeral, some 100,000 students had gathered at [[Tiananmen Square]] to observe it; however, no leaders emerged from the [[Great Hall of the People|Great Hall]]. The movement lasted for seven weeks.<ref name= "Zhao153">{{Citation | first = Dingxin | last = Zhao | title = The Power of Tiananmen: State-Society Relations and the 1989 Beijing Student Movement | place = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-226-98260-2 | page = 153}}.</ref>

Mikhail Gorbachev visited China on 15 May during the protests, bringing many foreign news agencies to Beijing, and their sympathetic portrayals of the protesters helped galvanize a spirit of liberation among the Central, South-East and Eastern Europeans who were watching. The Chinese leadership, particularly Communist Party general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]], who had begun to radically reform the economy earlier than the Soviets, was open to political reform, but not at the cost of a potential return to the disorder of the [[Cultural Revolution]].

The movement lasted from Hu's death on 15 April until tanks and troops rolled into the [[Tiananmen Square protests]] of June 4 1989. In Beijing, the [[Tiananmen Square massacre|military response]] to the protest by the PRC government left many civilians in charge of clearing the square of the dead and severely injured. The exact number of casualties is not known and many different estimates exist. The event, however, did make some political change; the most notable being that [[China]] started to open up its economy. This allowed for the country to bring in large sums of money and also started the wave of mass migration from rural Western China to urban Eastern China. The problem with the mass migration is that it has now started a deepening divide between the rural poor and the rich urban people.<ref>{{Citation|title=FRONTLINE {{!}} The Tank Man {{!}} Season 2006 {{!}} Episode 8|url=https://www.pbs.org/video/frontline-the-tank-man/|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>

The [[Malta Summit]] consisted of a meeting between U.S. President George H. W. Bush and U.S.S.R. leader Mikhail Gorbachev, taking place between 2–3 December 1989, just a few weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a meeting which contributed to the end of the [[Cold War]]{{citation needed| date=December 2010}} partially as a result of the broader pro-democracy movement.

== Election chronology in Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia ==
Between June 1989 and April 1991, every Communist or former Communist country in Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia—and in the case of the USSR and Yugoslavia, every constituent republic—held competitive parliamentary elections for the first time in many decades. Some elections were only partly free, while others were fully democratic.

== Dissolution of the Soviet Union ==
{{main|Dissolution of the Soviet Union}}
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}

On 1 July 1991, the Warsaw Pact was officially dissolved at a meeting in Prague. At a summit later that same month, Gorbachev and Bush declared a US–Soviet strategic partnership, decisively marking the end of the Cold War. President Bush declared that US–Soviet cooperation during the 1990–1991 [[Gulf War]] had laid the groundwork for a partnership in resolving bilateral and world problems.

As the Soviet Union rapidly withdrew its forces from Central and Southeast Europe, the spillover from the 1989 upheavals began reverberating throughout the Soviet Union itself. Agitation for self-determination led to first Lithuania, and then Estonia, Latvia and Armenia declaring independence. However, the Soviet central government demanded the revocation of the declarations and threatened military action and economic sanctions. The government even went as far as controversially sending [[Soviet Army]] troops to the streets of the Lithuanian capital, [[Vilnius]], to [[January Events (Lithuania)|suppress the separatist movements]] in January 1991, causing the deaths of 14 people.

Disaffection in other Soviet republics, such as Georgia and Azerbaijan, was countered by promises of greater decentralization. More open elections led to the election of candidates opposed to Communist Party rule.

''Glasnost'' had inadvertently released the long-suppressed national sentiments of all peoples within the borders of the multinational Soviet state. These nationalist movements were further strengthened by the rapid deterioration of the Soviet economy, whose ramshackle foundations were exposed with the removal of Communist discipline. Gorbachev's reforms had failed to improve the economy, with the old Soviet [[planned economy|command structure]] completely breaking down. One by one, the constituent republics created their own economic systems and voted to subordinate Soviet laws to local laws. In 1990, the Communist Party was forced to surrender its seven-decade monopoly of political power when the Supreme Soviet rescinded the clause in the Soviet Constitution that guaranteed its sole authority to rule. Gorbachev's policies caused the Communist Party to lose its grip over the media. Details of the Soviet Union's past were quickly being declassified. This caused many to distrust the 'old system' and push for greater autonomy and independence.

After a referendum confirmed the preservation of the Soviet Union but in a looser form, a group of Soviet hard-liners represented by Vice-President [[Gennadi Yanayev]] launched [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|a coup attempting to overthrow Gorbachev]] in August 1991. [[Boris Yeltsin]], then president of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], rallied the people and much of the army against the coup and the effort collapsed. Although restored to power, Gorbachev's authority had been irreparably undermined. Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party following the coup, and the Supreme Soviet dissolved the Party and banned all Communist activity on Soviet soil. Just a few weeks later, the government granted the Baltic states their independence on 6 September.

Over the next three months, one republic after another declared independence, mostly out of fear of another coup. Also during this time, the Soviet government was rendered useless as the new Russian government began taking over what remained of it, including the Kremlin. The penultimate step came on 1 December, when voters in the second most powerful republic, Ukraine, overwhelmingly voted to secede from the Soviet Union in a referendum. This ended any realistic chance of keeping the Soviet Union together. On 8 December, Yeltsin met with his counterparts from Ukraine and Belarus and signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], declaring that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. Gorbachev denounced this as illegal, but he had long since lost any ability to influence events outside of Moscow.

Two weeks later, 11 of the remaining 12 republics—all except Georgia—signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]], which confirmed the Soviet Union had been effectively dissolved and replaced by a new voluntary association, the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Bowing to the inevitable, Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president on 25 December, and the Supreme Soviet ratified the Belavezha Accords the next day, legally dissolving itself and the Soviet Union as a political entity. By the end of 1991, the few Soviet institutions that hadn't been taken over by Russia had dissolved. The Soviet Union was officially disbanded, breaking up into fifteen constituent parts, thereby ending the world's largest and most influential Socialist state, and leaving to China that position. A [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] dissolved into violence in Moscow as the [[Russian Army]] was called in to reestablish order.

[[File:1989 08 23 Baltijoskelias14.jpg|thumb|[[Baltic Way]] was a [[Human chain (politics)|human chain]] of approximately two million people dedicated to liberating the [[Baltic Republics]] from the [[Soviet Union]].]]

Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania implemented democratic reforms and achieved independence from the Soviet Union. The [[Singing Revolution]] is a commonly used name for events between 1987 and 1991 that led to the restoration of the independence of [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]] and [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]].<ref>{{Cite book | last=Thomson | first=Clare | title=The Singing Revolution: A Political Journey through the Baltic States | location= London  | publisher= Joseph | year= 1992 | isbn= 0-7181-3459-1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last=Ginkel | first=John |date=September 2002 | title=Identity Construction in Latvia's "Singing Revolution": Why inter-ethnic conflict failed to occur | journal=Nationalities Papers | volume=30| issue=3| pages=403–33 | doi = 10.1080/0090599022000011697| s2cid=154588618 }}</ref> The term was coined by an Estonian activist and artist, [[Heinz Valk]], in an article published a week after the 10–11 June 1988 spontaneous mass night-singing demonstrations at the [[Tallinn Song Festival Grounds]].<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nI73PdnqQlcC&pg | title = Between Utopia and Disillusionment | first = Henri | last = Vogt | page = 26 | isbn = 1-57181-895-2| year = 2005 }}.</ref> Estonia [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|declared its sovereignty]] from the Soviet Union on 16 November 1988. Lithuania followed on 18 May 1989 and Latvia on 28 July 1989.

These declarations were met with force from the Soviet Union in early 1991, in confrontations known as the [[January Events (Lithuania)|"January Events" in Lithuania]] and "[[The Barricades]]" in Latvia. The Baltic states contended that their incorporation into the Soviet Union had been illegal under both international law and their own law, and they were reasserting an independence that still legally existed.

Soon after the launching of the August coup, Estonia and Latvia declared full independence. By the time the coup was foiled, the USSR was no longer unified enough to mount a forceful resistance, and it recognized the independence of the Baltic states on 6 September.

=== Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova ===
* {{flag|Belarus|1991}} declared full independence from the USSR on 25 August 1991. The main political changes of the early 1990s were driven by the [[Belarusian Popular Front]] and its fraction in the [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus]]. A few years later, a new post-communist leader, [[Alexander Lukashenko|Alyaksandr Lukashenka]], obtained power. After a short period, he increased his power as a result of two controversial referendums (1995–96) and has been criticized for [[Human rights in Belarus|repressing political opposition]] ever since.
* {{flag|Moldova}} participated in the [[War of Transnistria]] between Moldova and Russian-connected forces in the separatist region of [[Transnistria]]. Communists came back to power in a 2001 election under [[Vladimir Voronin]], but faced [[2009 Moldova civil unrest|civil unrest]] in 2009 over accusations of rigged elections.
* {{flag|Ukraine}} [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|declared its independence]] in August 1991. Presidencies of former Communists [[Leonid Kravchuk]] and [[Leonid Kuchma]] were followed by the [[Orange Revolution]] in 2004, in which Ukrainians elected [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (also a former member of [[CPSU]]).

* {{flag|Georgia|1990}} and the [[North Caucasus]] have been marred by ethnic and sectarian violence since the collapse of the USSR. In April 1989 the [[Soviet Army]] [[April 9 tragedy|massacred]] demonstrators in [[Tbilisi]]; in November 1989, the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]] officially condemned the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]]. Democracy activist [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] served as president from 1991 to 1992.<ref name="princeton"/> Russia aided break-away republics in wars in [[1991-1992 South Ossetia War|South Ossetia]] and [[War in Abkhazia (1992-1993)|Abkhazia]] during the early 1990s, conflicts that have periodically reemerged, and Russia has accused Georgia of supporting Chechen rebels during the [[First Chechen War|Chechen wars]]. A coup d'état installed former Communist leader [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] as President of Georgia until the [[Rose Revolution]] in 2003.
* {{flag|Armenia}}'s independence struggle included violence as the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]] was fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Armenia became increasingly militarized (with the ascendancy of Kocharian, a former president of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], often viewed as a milestone), while elections have since been increasingly controversial, and government corruption became rifer. After Kocharyan, notably, [[Serzh Sargsyan]] ascended to power. Sargsyan is often noted as the "founder of the Armenian and Karabakh militaries" and was, in the past, defense minister and national security minister.
* {{flag|Azerbaijan}}'s [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party|Popular Front Party]] won the first elections with the self-described pro-Western, populist nationalist Elchibey. However, Elchibey planned to end Moscow's advantage in the harvesting of Azeri oil and build much stronger links with Turkey and Europe, and as a result was overthrown by former Communists in a coup backed by Russia and Iran (which viewed the new country as a compelling threat, with territorial ambitions within Iranian borders and also being a strong economic rival).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Glenn E.|title=Azerbaijan: A Country Study|date=1995}}</ref> Mutallibov rose to power, but he was soon destabilized and eventually ousted due to popular frustration with his perceived incompetence, corruption and improper handling of the war with Armenia.

The [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]] was fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and has largely defined the fates of both countries. However, unlike Armenia, which remains a strong Russian ally, Azerbaijan has begun, since Russia's 2008 war with Georgia, to foster better relations with Turkey and other Western nations, while lessening ties with Russia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nagorno-Karabakh profile|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18270325|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>

=== Chechnya ===
[[File:Evstafiev-chechnya-women-pray.jpg|thumb|[[Chechnya|Chechen]] women praying for Russian troops not to advance towards [[Grozny]] during the [[First Chechen War]], December 1994.]]

In [[Chechnya]] (an [[Autonomous republics of the Soviet Union|autonomous republic]] within [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] that had a strong desire for independence), using tactics partly copied from the Baltics, anti-Communist coalition forces led by former Soviet general [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] staged a largely bloodless revolution, and ended up forcing the resignation of the Communist republican president. Dudayev was elected in a landslide in the following election and in November 1991 he proclaimed [[Checheno-Ingushetia]]'s independence as the Republic of Ichkeria. Ingushetia voted to leave the union with Chechnya, and was allowed to do so (thus it became the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria). Due to Dudayev's desire to exclude Moscow from all oil deals, Yeltsin backed a failed coup against him in 1993. In 1994, Chechnya, with only marginal recognition (one country: Georgia, which was revoked soon after the coup landing Shevardnadze in power), was invaded by Russia, spurring the [[First Chechen War]]. The Chechens, with considerable assistance from the populations of both former-Soviet countries and from Sunni Muslim countries repelled this invasion and a peace treaty was signed in 1997. However, Chechnya became increasingly anarchic, largely due to the both political and physical destruction of the state during the invasion, and general Shamil Basaev, having evaded all control by the central government, conducted raids into neighboring Dagestan, which Russia used as pretext for reinvading Ichkeria. Ichkeria was then reincorporated into Russia as Chechnya again, though insurgency continues.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.rbc.ru/politics/12/05/2017/5915d8799a794757ef77f42e |title = ИГ взяла на себя ответственность за нападение на полицейских в Ингушетии}}</ref>

=== Central Asia ===
* {{flag|Kazakhstan|1991}}'s independence struggle began with the [[Jeltoqsan]] uprising in 1986. Former Communist leader [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] has been in power from 1990 when he started serving as [[Kazakh SSR|President of Kazakh SSR]] until his retirement from his position in 2019.

* {{flag|Turkmenistan|1991}}'s [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] retained power until his death in 2006 and was criticized as one of the world's most totalitarian and repressive leaders, maintaining his own [[cult of personality]]. Niyazov’s successor [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow|Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov]] initially eased changes made by Niyazov before starting his very own cult of personality.
* {{flag|Uzbekistan}}'s [[Islam Karimov]] retained power until his death in 2016, and was widely criticized for repressing the political opposition throughout his tenure.

Other impacts:
*[[File:Global effect of 1989-1991 Revolutions.png|thumb|387x387px|alt=|Global effect of 1989-1991 Revolutions.]]{{flag|Israel}} – In 1990, the Soviet Union finally permitted free emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel. Prior to this, [[1970s Soviet Union aliyah|Jews trying to leave the USSR faced persecution]]; those who succeeded arrived as refugees. Over the next few years, some one million Soviet citizens migrated to Israel. Although there was a concern that some of the new immigrants had only a very tenuous connection to Judaism, and many were accompanied by non-Jewish relatives, this massive wave of migration brought large numbers of highly educated Soviet Jews and slowly changed the demographic nature of Israel. In addition, thousands of [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] were [[Operation Solomon|rescued]] by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in 1991.

== Political reforms ==
{{main|Decommunization}}
Decommunization is a process of overcoming the legacies of the [[Communist state]] establishments, culture, and psychology in the post-Communist states. Decommunization was largely limited or non-existent. Communist parties were not outlawed and their members were not brought to trial. Just a few places even attempted to exclude members of communist secret services from decision-making. In a number of countries the Communist party simply changed its name and continued to function.<ref>[http://www.icer.it/docs/wp2000/Pejovich162000.pdf After Socialism: where hope for individual liberty lies]. Svetozar Pejovich.</ref> In several European countries, however, endorsing or attempting to justify crimes committed by Nazi or Communist regimes became punishable by up to 3 years of imprisonment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?PID=888&LID=2|title=This page does not / no longer exist|author=Anne Frank Stichting|date=28 September 2018}}</ref>

== Economic reforms ==
[[File:GDP of Russia since 1989.svg|thumb|Russian GDP since the end of the [[Soviet Union]] (from 2014 are forecasts)]]

State run enterprises in socialist countries had little or no interest in producing what customers wanted, which resulted in shortages of goods and services.<ref name="aslund"/> In the early 1990s, the general view was that there was no precedent for moving from socialism to capitalism",<ref name="Havrylyshyn"/> and only some elderly people remembered how a market economy worked. As a result, the view that Central, Southeastern and Eastern Europe would stay poor for decades was common.<ref>{{Cite news | title=The world after 1989: Walls in the mind |work=The Economist | date=5 November 2009 | url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14793753 }}</ref>

There was a temporary fall of output in the official economy and an increase in black market economic activity.<ref name="aslund"/>
Countries implemented different reform programs. One example, generally regarded as successful was the "shock therapy" [[Balcerowicz Plan]] in Poland.

[[Chinese economic reform|Chinese economic liberalization]] began in 1978 and has helped lift millions of people out of poverty, bringing the poverty rate down from 53% of the population in the Mao era to 12% in 1981.

Harvard University Professor [[Richard B. Freeman]] has called the effect of reforms "The Great Doubling". He calculated that the size of the global workforce doubled from 1.46&nbsp;billion workers to 2.93&nbsp;billion workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/webfac/eichengreen/e183_sp07/great_doub.pdf |title=The Great Doubling: The Challenge of the New Global Labor Market |accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref><ref name="Freeman">{{cite web | url=http://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc261a.pdf | title=The new global labor market | author=Richard Freeman | publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison Institute for Research on Poverty | year=2008}}</ref> An immediate effect was a reduced ratio of capital to labor.

In 1992, President Yeltsin's government invited [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] to serve as an expert to testify at the [[CPSU]] trial by [[Constitutional Court]] of Russia, where the Communists were suing Yeltsin for banning their party. The respondent's case was that the [[CPSU]] itself had been an unconstitutional organization. To prepare for his testimony, Bukovsky requested and was granted access to a large number of documents from Soviet archives (then reorganized into [[TsKhSD]]). Using a small handheld scanner and a laptop computer, he managed to secretly scan many documents (some with high [[security clearance]]), including [[KGB]] reports to the [[Central Committee]], and smuggle the files to the West.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = JHU | contribution-url = http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/buk.html | contribution = Soviet Archives | title = Info-Russ}}.</ref>
== Interpretations ==
The events caught many by surprise. [[Predictions of Soviet collapse|Predictions of the Soviet Union's impending demise]] had been often dismissed.<ref name="melt">{{cite news|first=Ian|last=Cummins|title=The Great MeltDown|work=The Australian|date=23 December 1995}}</ref>

Bartlomiej Kaminski's book ''The Collapse of State Socialism'' argued that the state Socialist system has a lethal paradox, saying that "policy actions designed to improve performance only accelerate its decay".<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/47325/robert-legvold/the-collapse-of-state-socialism | title = The Collapse of State Socialism | newspaper = Foreign Affairs| date = 28 January 2009 }}.</ref>

By the end of 1989, revolts had spread from one capital to another, ousting the regimes imposed on Central, South-East and Eastern Europe after World War II. Even the isolationist Stalinist regime in Albania was unable to stem the tide. Gorbachev's abrogation of the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] was perhaps the key factor that enabled the popular uprisings to succeed. Once it became evident that the feared Soviet Army would not intervene to crush dissent, the Central, South-East and Eastern European regimes were exposed as vulnerable in the face of popular uprisings against the one-party system and power of [[secret police]].

[[Coit D. Blacker]] wrote in 1990 that the Soviet leadership "appeared to have believed that whatever loss of authority the Soviet Union might suffer in Central and South-East Europe would be more than offset by a net increase in its influence in western Europe."<ref name="fa90">{{Citation | first = Coit D | last = Blacker | title = The Collapse of Soviet Power in Europe | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 70 | pages = 88–102 | year = 1990| issue = 1 | doi = 10.2307/20044696 | jstor = 20044696 }}.</ref> Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Gorbachev ever intended for the complete dismantling of Communism and the Warsaw Pact. Rather, Gorbachev assumed that the Communist parties of Central and South-East Europe could be reformed in a similar way to the reforms he hoped to achieve in the CPSU. Just as ''perestroika'' was aimed at making the Soviet Union more efficient economically and politically, Gorbachev believed that the [[Comecon]] and Warsaw Pact could be reformed into more effective entities. However, [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], a close advisor to Gorbachev, would later state that it would have been "absurd to keep the system" in Central and South-East Europe. Yakovlev had come to the conclusion that the Soviet-dominated Comecon could not work on non-market principles and that the Warsaw Pact had "no relevance to real life".<ref>{{citation|author=Steele, Jonathan|title=Eternal Russia: Yeltsin, Gorbachev and the Mirage of Democracy|place=Boston|publisher=Faber|year=1994}}</ref>
