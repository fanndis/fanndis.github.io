'''Theophilus Eugene “Bull” Connor''' (July 11, 1897&nbsp;&ndash; March 10, 1973) was an American politician who served as Commissioner of Public Safety for the city of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]], for more than two decades. He strongly opposed the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s. Under the [[city commission government]], Connor had responsibility for administrative oversight of the Birmingham Fire Department and the [[Birmingham Police Department (Alabama)|Birmingham Police Department]],<ref name=EOA/> which also had their own chiefs. Connor was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].

Bull Connor enforced legal [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] and denied [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] to black citizens, especially during 1963's [[Birmingham campaign]], led by the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]. He became an international symbol of [[institutional racism]] and [[police brutality]], largely due to his directing of the widespread use of [[fire hose]]s and police [[attack dog]]s against civil rights activists, including against children supporting the protests.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Meet the Players: Other Figures {{!}} American Experience {{!}} PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/meet-players-other-figures/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-08-05|website=PBS|language=en}}</ref> National media broadcast these tactics on television, horrifying much of the country. The outrages served as catalysts for major social and legal change in the [[Southern United States]] and contributed to passage by the [[United States Congress]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref name=EOA/>

==Early life==
Connor was born in 1897 in [[Selma, Alabama]], the son of Molly (Godwin) and Hugh King Connor, a [[train dispatcher]] and telegraph operator.<ref name=EOA/> He entered politics as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in 1934 winning a seat in the [[Alabama House of Representatives]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/connor.html|title=The Political Graveyard: Index to Politicians: Connor|first=Lawrence|last=Kestenbaum|website=politicalgraveyard.com}}</ref> As a legislator, he supported [[Populism|populist]] measures and pro-union issues for white people. He voted for extending the [[poll tax]], which served as a barrier to voter registration by poor blacks and whites, and against an anti-sedition bill intended to stifle union activity.<ref name=EOA/> He did not stand for a second term in 1936, instead running for Commissioner of Public Safety for the City of Birmingham. Concurrently during this period, Connor served as the radio play-by-play broadcaster of the minor league Birmingham Barons baseball club spanning the 1932 through 1936 seasons.<ref>Brands, Edgar G., "Broadcasts of Game Blanket America",''The Sporting News'' (St. Louis, Mo.), April 23, 1936, p. 2</ref> [[Willie Mays]] remembered listening to him call games: "Pretty good announcer, too, although I think he used to get too excited."<ref>{{cite book|last=Mays|first=Willie|title=Say Hey: The Autobiography of Willie Mays|location=New York|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1988|isbn=0671632922|page=30}}</ref>

==Commissioner of Public Safety (1936–1954, 1957–1963)==
In 1936, Connor was elected to the office of Commissioner of Public Safety of Birmingham, beginning the first of two stretches that spanned a total of 26 years. His first term ended in 1952, but he was re-elected in 1956, serving to 1963.

In 1938, Connor ran as a candidate for [[List of Governors of Alabama|Governor of Alabama]]. He announced he would be campaigning on a platform of "protecting employment practices, [[law enforcement]], segregation and other problems that have been historically classified as [[states' rights]] by the Democratic party".<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AC12CwAAQBAJ&q=There%27s+not+enough+room+in+town+for+Bull+and+the+Commies&pg=PT36 | title=Vagrant Nation: Police Power, Constitutional Change, and the Making of the 1960s| isbn=9780190262273| last1=Goluboff| first1=Risa| date=2016-01-25}}</ref>

In 1948, Connor's officers arrested the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Idaho]], [[Glen H. Taylor]]. He was the running mate of [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] presidential candidate [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]], former Democratic [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. Taylor, who had attempted to speak to the [[Southern Negro Youth Congress]], was arrested for violating Birmingham's racial segregation laws. Connor's effort to enforce the law was caused by the group's reported [[Communism|communist]] philosophy,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123771194|title=How 'Communism' Brought Racial Equality To The South|publisher=}}</ref> with Connor noting at the time, "There's not enough room in town for Bull and the Commies."{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

During the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]], Connor led the Alabama delegation in a walkout when the national party included a civil rights plank in its platform.<ref name="EOA" /> The offshoot [[Dixiecrat|States' Rights Democratic Party]] (Dixiecrats) nominated [[Strom Thurmond]] for president at its convention in Birmingham's [[Boutwell Memorial Auditorium|Municipal Auditorium]].<ref>J. Barton Starr, "Birmingham and the 'Dixiecrat' Convention of 1948," ''Alabama Historical Quarterly'' 1970 32(1–2): 23–50</ref>

Connor's second run for governor fell flat in 1954. He was the center of controversy that year by pushing through a city ordinance in Birmingham that outlawed "communism."<ref>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.428.4376&rep=rep1&type=pdf</ref>

===Civil rights era===
Before returning to office in 1956, Connor quickly resumed his brutal approach to dealing with perceived threats to the social order. His forces raided a meeting at the house of African-American activist Reverend [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], where three [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] ministers were attending. He feared that the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] that was under way would spread to Birmingham, in an effort to integrate city buses. He had the ministers arrested on charges of [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]], which did not allow a prisoner bail, nor any visitors during the first three days of their incarceration. A federal investigation followed, but Connor refused to cooperate.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Shuttlesworth had led civil rights activities despite being threatened with violence. His church was bombed twice. He, his wife, and a white minister were attacked by a racist mob after attempting to use "white" restrooms at the local bus station, which had segregated facilities.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In 1960, Connor was elected [[Democratic National Committee]]man for [[Alabama]], soon after filing a civil lawsuit against ''[[The New York Times]]'' for $1.5 million. He objected to what he claimed was their insinuation that he had promoted racial hatred. He dropped his claim for damages to $400,000; the case dragged on for six years until Connor lost a $40,000 judgment on appeal.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/11/archives/eugene-bull-connor-dies-at-75-police-head-fought-integration-less.html</ref>

==Freedom Riders==
{{main|Freedom Riders}}
In the spring of 1961, integrated teams of civil rights activists mounted what they called "Freedom Rides" to highlight the illegal imposition of racial segregation on interstate buses, whose operations came under federal law and the constitution. They had teams ride [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] and [[Trailways Transportation System|Trailways]] buses traveling through southern capitals, with the final stop intended as New Orleans. The teams encountered increasing hostility and violence as they made their way deeper into the South.

On May 2, 1961, Connor had won a landslide election for his sixth term as Commissioner of Public Safety in Birmingham. As Commissioner, he had administrative authority over the police and fire departments, schools, public health service, and libraries, all of which were segregated by state law.<ref name=EOA/> Tom King, a candidate running for mayor of Birmingham, met with Connor on May 8, 1961, to pay his respects. In addition, he asked him to refrain from announcing support for the other leading mayoral candidate, Art Hanes, so that King's chances would be greater. At the end of the meeting, Connor noted that he was expecting the [[Freedom Riders]] to reach Birmingham the following Sunday, Mother's Day. He stated, "We'll be ready for them, too," and King responded, "I bet you will, Commissioner," as he walked out.<ref>Nunnelley, William. ''Bull Connor.'' Tuscaloosa and London: The University of Alabama Press, 1991, p. 93.</ref>

After a stop in [[Anniston, Alabama]], the Greyhound bus of the Freedom Riders was attacked. They were offered no police protection. After they left town, they were forced to stop by a violent mob that firebombed and burned the bus, but no activists were fatally hurt. A new Greyhound bus was placed into service and departed for Birmingham. The activists on the earlier Trailways bus had been accosted by KKK members who boarded the bus in Atlanta and beat up the activists, pushing them all to the back of the bus.

The Freedom Riders arrived in Birmingham on May 14, 1961. As the Trailways bus reached the terminal in Birmingham, a large mob of [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansmen]] and news reporters was waiting for them. The Riders were viciously attacked soon after they disembarked from the bus and attempted to gain service at the whites-only lunch counter. Some were taken to the loading dock area, away from reporters, but some reporters were also beaten with metal bars, pipes, and bats and one's camera was destroyed. After 15 minutes, the police finally arrived, but by then most Klansmen had left.<ref>Arsenault, Raymond. ''Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 154.</ref><ref name="npr">[https://www.npr.org/2006/01/12/5149667/get-on-the-bus-the-freedom-riders-of-1961 Terry Gross, "Get On the Bus: The Freedom Riders of 1961"], 12 January 2006; accessed 10 January 2017</ref>

Connor intentionally let the Klansmen beat the Riders for 15 minutes with no police intervention. He publicly blamed the violence on many factors, saying that "No policemen were in sight as the buses arrived, because they were visiting their mothers on Mother's Day".<ref>Dierenfield, Bruce. ''The Civil Rights Movement.'' Great Britain: Pearson Education Limited, 2004.</ref> He insisted that the violence came from out-of-town meddlers and that police had rushed to the scene "as quickly as possible."<ref name="bull"/> The violence was covered by national media.

He said:  
<blockquote>As I have said on numerous occasions, we are not going to stand for this in Birmingham. And if necessary we will fill the jail full and we don't care whose toes we step on. I am saying now to these meddlers from out of our city the best thing for them to do is stay out if they don't want to get slapped in jail. Our people of Birmingham are a peaceful people and we never have any trouble here unless some people come into our city looking for trouble. And I've never seen anyone yet look for trouble who wasn't able to find it.<ref name="bull">Nunnelley, William. ''Bull Connor.'' Tuscaloosa and London: The University of Alabama Press, 1991, p. 154.</ref></blockquote>

In 1962, Connor ordered the closing of 60 Birmingham parks rather than follow a federal court order to desegregate public facilities.

In November 1962, in response to the extremely negative perception of the city -- it was derisively nicknamed "[[Bombingham]]" by outsiders for the numerous attacks on the homes and churches of black civil rights activists -- Birmingham voters changed the city's form of government. Rather than an at-large election of three commissioners, who had specific oversight of certain city departments, there would be a mayor-council form of government. Members of the city council were to be elected from nine single-member districts. Blacks were still largely disenfranchised. For instance, in 1961 when the president of the city's [[Chamber of commerce|Chamber of Commerce]] was visiting Japan, he saw a newspaper photo of a bus engulfed in flames, which occurred during the [[Freedom Rides]]. Bull Connor had arranged for opponents to have time to attack civil rights activists when their bus reached Birmingham.

Endorsed by Governor [[George Wallace|George C. Wallace]], Connor attempted to run for mayor, but lost on April 2, 1963. Connor and his fellow commissioners filed suit to block the change in power,<ref name=EOA/> but on May 23, 1963, the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]] ruled against them.<ref>Connor v. State, 275 Ala. 230, 153 So. 2d 787 (1963).</ref> Connor ended his 23-year tenure in the post. Citing a general law, he had argued that the change could not take effect until the October 1 following the date of the election, but the Supreme Court of Alabama held that the general law was preempted by a special law applicable to only the City of Birmingham.

==Birmingham campaign==
{{Main|Birmingham campaign}}

Local civil rights activists had been unable to negotiate much change with the city or business leaders, in their efforts to gain integration of facilities and hiring of blacks by local businesses. They invited Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and his team to help mount a more concerted campaign. The day after the April election, Dr. King and local civil rights leaders began "[[Birmingham campaign|Project 'C']]" (for "confrontation") against the Birmingham business community. They used economic boycotts and demonstrations to seek integration of stores and job opportunities. Throughout April 1963, King led smaller demonstrations, which resulted in his arrest along with many others.<ref name="Segregation at All Costs: Bull Connor and the Civil Rights Movement - YouTube" >[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9kT1yO4MGg "Segregation at All Costs: Bull Connor and the Civil Rights Movement"], YouTube, 8 Apr 2011</ref>

King wanted to have massive arrests to highlight the brutal police tactics used by Connor and his subordinates. (By extension, the campaign was intended to demonstrate the general suppression by other Southern police officials as well). After King was arrested and jailed, he wrote his ''[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]],'' which became noted as a moral argument for civil rights activism. The goal of the campaign was to gain mass arrests of non-violent protesters and overwhelm the judicial and penal systems. It would also demonstrate to national media and local residents the strong desire of African Americans to exercise their constitutional rights as citizens.

===Children's Crusade===
{{Main|Children's Crusade (1963)|l1 = Children's Crusade}}

In the final phase of Project C, the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]'s [[James Bevel]] introduced a controversial new tactic of using young people in the demonstrations. Most adults were working and could not afford to take time off. On May 2, 1963, the first youths and students walked out of the [[16th Street Baptist Church]] and attempted to march to Birmingham's City Hall to talk to the Mayor. By the end of the day, 959 children, ranging from ages 6–18, had been arrested.

The next day, even more students joined the marches, against whom Connor ordered the use of fire hoses and attack dogs. This did not stop the demonstrators, but generated bad publicity for Connor through the news media. The use of fire hoses continued and by May 7, Connor and the police department had detained more than 3,000 demonstrators.<ref name="Segregation at All Costs: Bull Connor and the Civil Rights Movement - YouTube" />

The blacks' economic boycott of businesses that refused to hire them and downtown stores that kept segregated facilities helped gain negotiation by the city's business leaders. The SCLC and the Senior Citizens Committee, who represented a majority of Birmingham businesses, came to an agreement. On May 10, they agreed on  desegregation of lunch counters, restrooms, fitting rooms, and drinking fountains at department stores, the upgrading in position and hiring of blacks, cooperation with SCLC legal representatives in releasing all detainees, and the establishment of formal communication between black and whites through the Senior Citizens Committee.<ref>Nunnelley, William.

==Later life and death==
On June 3, 1964, Connor resumed a place in government when he was elected President of the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]]. He suffered a stroke on December 7, 1966, and used a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He was present on February 16, 1968, when the [[Haleyville, Alabama]], police precinct made the first use of [[9-1-1]] as an [[emergency telephone number]]. Months later, Connor won another term, but was defeated in 1972.

He suffered another stroke on February 26, 1973, which left him unconscious. He died a few weeks later, in March of that year.<ref>"Eugene 'Bull' Connor Dies at 75", ''Associated Press'', March 11, 1973</ref> Survivors included his widow, Beara, a daughter, and a brother, Edward King Connor.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Legacy==
Connor's brutality and violence against civil rights activists contributed to Ku Klux Klan and other violence against blacks in the city of Birmingham. On a Sunday in September 1963, the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] destroyed a portion of the church basement causing the death of four African-American girls. The church was known as the center of civil rights activities in Birmingham. The city and movement leaders had just reached a negotiated agreement on integration of facilities and jobs. The deaths of the children prompted the Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy]] to call Governor George Wallace and threaten to send in federal troops to control violence and bombings in Birmingham.

*Connor is mentioned in contemporary folk singer [[Phil Ochs]]'s 1965 song "Talking Birmingham Jam".
*[[Spike Lee]]'s [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[4 Little Girls]]'' (1997) (about the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]], includes footage of Connor and interviews with people describing police tactics during his tenure).
*Footage of Connor also appears in the 1999 film ''[[Our Friend, Martin]],'' in which he is voiced by veteran voice artist [[Frank Welker]]
*Connor is cited by name in the 2014 film ''[[Selma_(film)|Selma]]'' as an example of a particular type of bullying public official and police officer whose tolerance, or encouragement, of violence towards Civil Rights campaigners plays into the hands of the media-conscious SBLC and Martin Luther King Jr.
