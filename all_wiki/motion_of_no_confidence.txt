{{short description|Vote on whether a group of people still has confidence in a government or leader}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}
A  '''motion of no confidence''', or a '''vote of no confidence''', or '''no confidence motion''', is a statement or vote about whether a person in a position of responsibility (government, managerial, etc.) is no longer deemed fit to hold that position, perhaps because they are inadequate in some aspect, are failing to carry out obligations, or are making decisions that other members feel as being detrimental. As a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|parliamentary motion]], it demonstrates to the [[head of state]] that the elected parliament no longer has confidence in (one or more members of) the appointed [[Executive (government)|government]]. In some countries, if a no confidence motion is passed against an individual minister they have to resign along with the entire council of ministers.

A [[censure]] motion is different from a no-confidence motion. Depending on the constitution of the body concerned, "no confidence" may lead to dismissal of the [[Council of Ministers]] or other position-holders, whereas "censure" is meant to show disapproval and does not result in the resignation of ministers. The censure motion can be against an individual minister or a group of ministers, but depending on a country's constitution, a no-confidence motion may be more directed against the entire [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Again, depending on the applicable rules, censure motions may need to state the reasons for the motion while no confidence motions may not require reasons to be specified.

==Parliamentary systems==
There are a number of variations in this procedure between parliaments. In some countries a motion of no confidence can be directed at the government collectively or at any individual member, including the [[prime minister]]. In [[Spain]], it is presented by the prime minister after consultation. Sometimes motions of no confidence are proposed even though they have no likelihood of passage, simply to pressure a government or to embarrass its own critics, who may for political reasons decide not to vote against it.

In many [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]], there are strict time limits for no confidence motions: they may only be allowed once every three, four or six months. Thus, the timing of a motion of no confidence is a matter of political judgement; a motion of no confidence on a relatively trivial matter may prove counterproductive if a more important issue suddenly arises which actually warrants a motion of no confidence, because such a motion cannot be proposed if one has been voted on recently. Sometimes, the government will choose to declare that one of its bills is a "motion of confidence" in order to prevent dissident members of their own party voting against it.

===Australia===

In the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]], a motion of no confidence requires a [[majority#Application in other voting requirements|majority of the members present]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to agree to it. The House of Representatives consists of 151 members; requiring 76 votes in favour of the motion when all members of the House are present. A straight vote of no confidence in a [[Australian Government|government]], or a motion or amendment censuring a government, has never been successful in the House of Representatives.<ref name=AHoR/> Despite this, on eight occasions governments have either resigned or advised a dissolution following their defeat on other questions before the House.<ref name=AHoR/> The last time a government resigned after being defeated in the House came in October 1941, when the House rejected the budget of [[Arthur Fadden]]'s minority government.

Specific motions of no confidence or [[censure|censure motion]]s against the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], ministers, the [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]], [[Australian Senate|Senators]] and leaders of political parties have been moved and have been successful on some occasions. Motions of no confidence against the government may be passed in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], yet may have little or no impact in the House.<ref name=AHoR>{{cite book |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice6/Practice6HTML?file=Chapter9&section=07&fullscreen=1 |title=Motions of no confidence and censure |work=House of Representatives Practice |edition=6th |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] |location=Canberra |access-date=15 July 2016 }}</ref> However, the Senate's right to refuse supply helped spark the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]]. The convention remains a grey area as Westminster governments are not normally expected to maintain the confidence of the upper house.

===Canada===
In [[Canada|Canadian]] politics, a vote of no confidence is a motion that the legislature disapproves, and no longer consents to the governing [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] or provincial [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] and the incumbent Cabinet.<ref name=conven2>{{cite web|url=https://www.ourcommons.ca/About/Compendium/ParliamentaryFramework/c_d_confidenceconvention-e.htm|title=Confidence Convention|publisher=Parliament of Canada|year=2019|work=Compendium of Procedure  |access-date=4 September 2019}}</ref> A vote of no confidence that passes leads to the fall of the incumbent government. The practice originates as a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]],<ref name=conven2/> and remains an uncodified procedure not outlined in any standing orders for the [[House of Commons of Canada]].<ref name=confcon>{{cite web|url=https://www.ourcommons.ca/marleaumontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?Language=E&Sec=Ch02&Seq=3|title=The Confidence Convention|publisher=Parliament of Canada|year=2019|work=Parliaments and Ministries|access-date=4 September 2019}}</ref> A no confidence motion may only be directed against the incumbent government in the legislature, with votes of no confidence against the legislature's [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]] being inadmissible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ourcommons.ca/MarleauMontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?Language=E&Sec=Ch15&Seq=2|publisher=Parliament of Canada|access-date=4 September 2019|year=2019|work=Special Debates|title=Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne}}</ref>

At the federal level a vote of no confidence is a motion presented by a member of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] that explicitly states the House has no confidence in the incumbent government.<ref name=confcon/> The government may also declare any bill or motion to be a question of confidence.<ref name=confcon/> Several motions and bills are also considered implicit motions on confidence, and a vote of no confidence may be asserted automatically if they fail to pass. Bills and motions that are considered implicit motions of confidence includes appropriations/[[supply bill]]s, motions concerning budgetary policy, and the Address in Reply to the [[speech from the throne]].<ref name=glob>{{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/3568037/vote-of-no-confidence-canada/|title=Taking down the government, how a confidence vote works in Canada|work=Global News|access-date=4 September 2019|first=Katie|last=Dangerfield|date=30 June 2017|publisher=Corus Entertainment Inc.}}</ref> While the failure to pass these bills may be used as an automatic assertion of a vote of no confidence, the opposition is not obligated to assert the failure as a no confidence motion against the government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/newsblogs/politics/inside-politics-blog/2012/06/feeling-confident-about-the-budget-vote.html|title=Feeling confidence about the budget vote?|date=11 July 2012|access-date=6 September 2019|work=CBC News|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|last=McGregor|first=Janyce}}</ref>

Should a vote of no confidence pass, the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] is required to submit his or her resignation to the [[Governor General of Canada]].<ref name=conven2/> The Governor General may then invite the leader of another coalition/party to attempt to form a new government in the House of Commons, or dissolve Parliament and call for a [[Elections in Canada|general election]].<ref name=conven2/> Six no confidence motions have been passed in the House of Commons of Canada, in 1926, 1963, 1974, 1979, 2005, and 2011.<ref name=glob/> Successful votes of no confidence in the 20th century were all the result of a [[loss of supply]], while votes of no confidence in 2005 and 2011 were the result of explicit confidence motions presented by the opposition.

The confidence convention is also present in the provincial legislatures of Canada, and largely operate in the same manner as its federal counterpart. However, if the motion passes, the decision to either dissolve the legislature and call for an election, or see if another coalition/party can form a government is left to the provincial [[lieutenant governor (Canada)|lieutenant governors]], and not the Governor General.<ref name=glob/>

Two Canadian territories, the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]], operate as a [[consensus government]] system; in which the premier is chosen by the members of the non-partisan legislature. In the event a vote of no confidence against the incumbent government passes, the premier and cabinet are removed from office, and the legislature is permitted to elect a new premier.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/north/story/2009/02/04/nwt-leg.html (CBC)]</ref> Ministers in consensus governments are also nominated by members of the legislature, and as a result, confidence motions may be directed against any individual ministers holding office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/glen-abernethy-wally-schumann-non-confidence-motion-1.4885951|title=N.W.T.'s Health, Infrastructure ministers survive non-confidence votes|work=CBC News|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=31 October 2018|access-date=4 September 2019}}</ref>

===European Union===
The [[European Parliament]] can dismiss the [[European Commission]], the executive body of the European Union, through a successful motion of no confidence. Such a motion requires a two-thirds vote. A successful vote on the motion leads to the resignation of the commission.<ref>https://www.europarl.europa.eu/ftu/pdf/en/FTU_1.3.2.pdf</ref>

===Germany===
{{Main|Constructive vote of no confidence}}
In [[Germany]],<ref name="germanconst">[https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf German Constitution Official English Translation] Article 67 - Vote of No Confidence</ref> a vote of no confidence in the [[Chancellor of Germany|Federal Chancellor]] requires that the opposition, on the same ballot, propose a candidate of their own whom they want to be appointed as successor by the [[President of Germany|Federal President]]. Thus, a motion of no confidence can only be brought forward if there is a positive majority for the new candidate. The idea was to prevent crises of the state such as those found near the end of the German [[Weimar Republic]]. Frequently, Chancellors were turned out of office without their successors having enough parliamentary support to govern. Unlike the British system, the Chancellor does not have to resign in response to the failure of a vote of confidence, provided it has been initiated by them and not by the parliamentary opposition, but rather may ask the President to call general elections &ndash; a request the President may or may not fulfill.

===India===
In India, a motion of no confidence can be introduced only in the [[Lok Sabha]] (the [[lower house]] of the [[Parliament of India]]). The motion is admitted for discussion when a minimum of 50 members of the house support the motion (under rule 198 of Lok Sabha Rules 16th edition).<ref name="Current Lok Sabha hasn't seen trust vote, no-confidence motion">{{cite news|title=Current Lok Sabha hasn't seen trust vote, no-confidence motion|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-08-11/news/41295707_1_trust-vote-no-confidence-motion-no-confidence-motion|access-date=9 December 2013|date=11 Aug 2013|quote=the move could not even take off as Banerjee's party failed to muster the support of even 506 members, the minimum required for bringing a no trust motion.|work=The Times of India}}</ref> If the motion carries, the House debates and votes on the motion.

With the [[Anti-defection law (India)]], the vote of no confidence has no relevance when the majority party has an absolute majority in the House. If the party with an absolute majority in the House issues a [[Whip (politics)|whip]] to party members to vote in favour of the Government, then it is impossible to remove the Government by a no confidence motion. Hence the no confidence exercise of the House merely becomes a no confidence exercise of the Party.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=S|date=Jun 2017|title=Threatening Indian democratic system: Case of Anti-Defection Law|url=http://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=8546:threatening-indian-democratic-system-case-of-anti-defection-law&catid=124:research&Itemid=140|journal=The Voice}}</ref>

===Pakistan===
The [[Constitution of Pakistan]] has provision for a no confidence motion in all constituents of the [[Electoral College (Pakistan)|Electoral College]] of the state. The motions can target speakers and deputy speakers of [[List of provincial governments of Pakistan|provincial]] and [[Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan|national assemblies]], the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]], [[List of current Pakistani chief ministers|chief ministers]] of [[Administrative units of Pakistan|provinces]], as well as the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]].<ref name="CoP">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch3.html|title=Part III: The Federation of Pakistan: Chapter 3: The Federal Government|website=The Constitution of Pakistan}}</ref> Before it can be put for vote on the pertinent house's floor, it needs to have the backing of at least 20% of the elected members in all cases except those moved against speakers or deputy speakers, in which case there is no minimum support limit.

===Peru===

In Peru, the legislative and the executive branch both have the power to bring a motion of no confidence against acting legal members of each branch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Peru_2009.pdf?lang=en|title=Peru's Constitution of 1993}}</ref> The President of the Cabinet can propose a motion of no confidence against any minister to Congress, that then needs more than half the Congress to approve it. The [[President of Peru|President of the Republic]] has the power to dissolve [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Congress]] if it has censured or denied its confidence to two Cabinets. These articles (132-134) can be found in the 1993 version of the [[Constitution of Peru]].

Due to the [[2019 Peruvian constitutional crisis]], President [[Martín Vizcarra]] enacted a constitutional process on 29 May 2019 that would create a motion of no confidence towards Congress if they refused to cooperate with his proposed actions against corruption.

===South Africa===
Any MP in the lower house (National Assembly), may request a motion of no confidence in either the cabinet (excluding the President) or the President. The Speaker is obliged to, within the rules of parliament, add such a motion to the Order Paper. Such a motion must be given due priority. If a motion of no confidence cannot be scheduled by the last sitting day of the annual sitting, it must be the first item on the Order Paper of the next sitting<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.parliament.gov.za/storage/app/media/Rules/NA/2016-09-28_NA_RULES.pdf |title = Rules of the National Assembly|date = 11  June 2020}}</ref>. In the event of a successful motion, the Speaker automatically assumes the position of acting president. 

On 7 August 2017, Speaker [[Baleka Mbete]] announced that she would permit a motion of no confidence in [[Jacob Zuma]]'s government to proceed in the National Assembly via [[secret ballot]]. It was the eighth motion to be brought against Zuma in his presidency and the first to be held via secret ballot.

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] provides for motions of no confidence to be proposed by one-tenth of the [[Congress of Deputies]]. Following the German model, votes of no confidence in Spain are [[Constructive vote of no confidence|constructive]], so the motion must also include an alternative candidate for [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]]. For a motion of no confidence to be successful, it has to be carried by an absolute majority in the Congress of Deputies. A minimum period of five days must pass after the motion's registration before it can come up for a vote. Other parties are entitled to submit alternative motions within the first two days from the registration.<ref name="MotionKeys">{{cite news |date=25 May 2018 |title=Qué hace falta para que la moción de censura a Rajoy salga adelante |url=https://www.eldiario.es/politica/Claves-salga-adelante-mocion-censura_0_775172648.html |language=es |work=eldiario.es |access-date=25 May 2018}}</ref><ref name="SpanishConstitution">{{cite web |url=https://www.boe.es/legislacion/documentos/ConstitucionINGLES.pdf |title=The Spanish Constitution |work=boe.es |access-date=25 May 2018}}</ref>

Concurrently, the Prime Minister is barred from dissolving the [[Cortes Generales]] and calling a general election while a motion of no confidence is pending. If the motion is successful, the incumbent Prime Minister must resign. Per the Constitution, the replacement candidate named in the motion is automatically deemed to have the confidence of the Congress of Deputies and is immediately appointed as Prime Minister by the [[Monarchy of Spain|monarch]]. If unsuccessful, the signatories of the motion may not submit another during the same session.<ref name="MotionKeys"/><ref name="SpanishConstitution"/>

Current Prime Minister [[Pedro Sánchez (politician)|Pedro Sánchez]] was sworn in on 2 June 2018 after a [[2018 vote of no confidence in the government of Mariano Rajoy|motion of no-confidence]] against Prime Minister [[Mariano Rajoy]] was approved on 1 June 2018.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44327573 Mariano Rajoy: Spanish PM forced out of office]</ref>

===Sweden===
No confidence motions can be levelled against either the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] (on behalf of the entire [[Government of Sweden|Government]]) or an individual lower-level minister.  At least 35 members of parliament (MPs) have to support a proposal to initiate such a vote. A majority of MPs (175 members) must vote in favour of a declaration of no confidence for it to be successful. If an individual minister loses the confidence vote, he/she must resign. If the prime minister loses the no confidence vote, his/her entire government must resign.<ref>{{cite web |title=Examines the work of the Government |url=http://riksdagen.se/en/how-the-riksdag-works/what-does-the-riksdag-do/examines-the-work-of-the-government/ |website=Sveriges Riksdag}}</ref> The parliamentary speaker may allow the ousted prime minister to head a transitional or caretaker government until parliament elects a new prime minister.

Under the principle of negative parliamentarism, a prime ministerial candidate nominated by the speaker does not need the confidence of a majority of MPs to be elected. However, a majority of MPs must not vote against the candidate, which renders prime ministerial votes similar to a no confidence vote. This means for a prime ministerial candidate to be successful in the parliamentary vote, he must have at least a total of 175 'yes' and/or 'abstain' votes. If a speaker fails four times to have his/her nominee elected, an election must be held within three months of the final vote.

===United Kingdom===
{{Further|Motions of no confidence in the United Kingdom}}
Traditionally, in the [[Westminster system]], the defeat of a [[Supply Bill|supply bill]] (one that concerns the spending of money) is seen to automatically require the government to either resign or ask for a new election, much like a no confidence vote. A government in a Westminster system that cannot spend money is hamstrung, also called [[loss of supply]].

Prior to 2011, in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]], a no confidence motion generally first appeared as an [[early day motion]] although the vote on the [[Speech from the Throne]] also constituted a confidence motion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/m07.pdf |title=House of Commons Factsheet M7: Parliamentary Elections |publisher=House of Commons Information office |page=3 |access-date=23 March 2011}}</ref> However, under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], only a motion explicitly resolving "That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government" is treated as a motion of no confidence.

==Semi-presidential systems==
In [[semi-presidential systems]], the legislature may occasionally pass motions of no confidence, which removes only the cabinet and prime minister, the legislature may also have the power to [[impeachment|impeach]] an executive or judicial officer, with another institution or the legislature removing the officer from their office.

===Russia===
In the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], the lower house of the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Federal Assembly]] (the [[State Duma]]) may by a [[majority|simple majority]] (i.e. at least 226 votes out of 450) pass a motion of no confidence against the [[Government of Russia]] as a whole. In this case, the matter goes for consideration of the [[President of Russia|President]], who may choose to dismiss the cabinet (which the President can do at any moment in time at his own discretion anyway) or just to ignore the Duma's decision. Should the Duma pass a second motion of no confidence against the same composition of the cabinet within three months, the President will be forced to make a concrete decision – to dismiss the government or to dissolve the Duma itself and call for new [[Elections in Russia#Federal elections|general elections]]. The State Duma may not be dissolved on these grounds if it was elected less than a year earlier, if it has already initiated impeachment proceedings against the President himself by bringing respective accusations, if less than six months is left until elections of the President, or if there is a [[State of emergency in Russia|state of emergency]] or [[Martial law in Russia|martial law]] throughout the whole territory of Russian Federation. In the above-mentioned cases, the President would therefore be effectively forced to dismiss the Government.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===France===
In [[France]], the lower house of [[French Parliament]] (the [[French National Assembly]]) may by a simple [[majority]] vote pass a motion of no confidence against the [[Government of France]] as a whole. In this case, the Government is removed from power and the [[President of France]] has to appoint a new [[Prime Minister of France]], who will have to form a new government.

==History==
{{See also|List of prime ministers defeated by votes of no confidence}}
The first motion of no confidence occurred in March 1782{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} when, following news of the [[Siege of Yorktown|British defeat at Yorktown]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]] the previous October, the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] voted that they "can no longer repose confidence in the present ministers". [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] responded by asking [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to accept his resignation. This did not immediately create a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]. During the early 19th century, however, attempts by prime ministers, such as [[Robert Peel]], to govern in the absence of a parliamentary majority proved unsuccessful, and by the mid-19th century, the power of a motion of no confidence to break a government was firmly established in the UK.

In the United Kingdom, 11 prime ministers have been defeated through a no-confidence motion. There has been only one such motion since 1925, in [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|1979]] (against [[James Callaghan]]).

In modern times, passage of a motion of no confidence is a relatively rare event in two-party democracies. In almost all cases, [[party discipline]] is sufficient to allow a majority party to defeat a motion of no confidence, and if faced with possible defections in the government party, the government is likely to change its policies rather than lose a vote of no confidence. The cases in which a motion of no confidence has passed are generally those in which the government party's slim majority has been eliminated by either [[by-election]]s or defections, such as the [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry]] in the UK which was carried by one vote, forcing a general election which was won by [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].

Motions of no confidence are far more common in multi-party systems in which a minority party must form a [[coalition government]]. This can mean that there have been many short-lived governments because the party structure allows small parties to defeat a government without means{{clarify|date=November 2015}} to create a government. This has widely been regarded as the cause of instability for the [[French Fourth Republic]] and the German [[Weimar Republic]]. More recent examples have been in [[Italy]] between the 1950s and 1990s, [[Israel]], and [[Politics of Japan|Japan]].

To deal with this situation, the French placed a greater degree of executive power in the office of its [[President of France|President]], who is immune from motions of no confidence, along with a [[Two-round system|two-round]] [[plurality voting system]] that makes easier the formation of stable [[majority government]]s.

In 2008, Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], of the re-appointed minority government of Canada, requested that Governor-General Michaëlle Jean [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogue Parliament]].
