There has been growing concern over the '''health effects arising from the [[September 11 attacks]]''' in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Lower Manhattan]]. Within seconds of the [[collapse of the World Trade Center]], building materials, electronic equipment, and furniture were pulverized and spread over the area.

In the five months following the attacks, dust from the pulverized buildings continued to fill the air of the [[World Trade Center site]]. Increasing numbers of New York residents are reporting symptoms of Ground Zero [[respiratory illness]]es.<ref name="latimes3275974">{{cite news| url=https://articles.latimes.com/2006/oct/14/nation/na-cleaners14 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Lost in the Dust of 9/11 | first=Ellen | last=Barry | date=October 14, 2006 | access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

Various health programs have arisen to deal with the ongoing health effects of the September 11 attacks.

A study of 5,000 rescue workers published in April 2010 by Dr. David J. Prezant the chief medical officer for the Office of Medical Affairs at the New York City Fire Department found that all the workers studied had impaired lung functions with an average impairment of 10 percent. The study found the impairments presented itself in the first year of after the attack with little or no improvements in the ensuing six years. 30 to 40 percent of workers were reporting persistent symptoms and 1000 of the group studied were on "permanent respiratory disability." Dr. Prezant noted the medications that are being given ease symptoms but are not a cure. Dr. Byron Thomashow, medical director of the Center for Chest Disease and Respiratory Failure at New York–Presbyterian/Columbia hospital said that "The drop-off in lung function initially is really quite significant and doesn't get better. That's not what we've generally come to expect in people with fire and smoke exposure.

A study published in December 2012 in [[JAMA (journal)|''The Journal of the American Medical Association'']] observed the possible association between exposure to the World Trade Center debris and excess cancer risk. Over 55,000 individuals enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Registry, separated by rescue and/or recovery workers and non-rescue and/or recovery workers, were observed from 2003 or 2004 to December 31, 2008. The findings showed the overall [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of all cancers among rescue and/or recovery workers was not significantly elevated, compared to non-rescue and/or recovery workers. Despite this, the incidences for [[prostate cancer]], [[thyroid cancer]], and [[multiple myeloma]] were significantly elevated among the rescue and/or recovery workers, in the final year of observation.<ref name="Li">{{cite journal|last2=Cone|first2=JE|last3=Kahn|first3=AR|last4=Brackbill|first4=RM|last5=Farfel|first5=MR|last6=Greene|first6=CM|last7=Hadler|first7=JL|last8=Stayner|first8=LT|last9=Stellman|first9=SD|year=2012|title=Association between World Trade Center exposure and excess cancer risk|journal=JAMA|publisher=American Medical Association|volume=308|issue=23|pages=2479–88|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.110980|pmid=23288447|last1=Li|first1=J|doi-access=free}}</ref>

On November 28, 2006, the ''[[Village Voice]]'' reported that several dozen recovery personnel have developed cancer – as opposed to having contracted respiratory ailments, and that doctors have argued that some of these cancers developed as a result of the exposure to toxins at the Ground Zero site:

== Monitoring ==
There is scientific speculation that exposure to various toxic products and the pollutants in the air surrounding the Towers after the WTC collapse may have negative effects on fetal development. Due to this potential hazard, a notable children's environmental health center (Columbia University Center for Children's Health) is currently analyzing the children whose mothers were pregnant during the WTC collapse, and were living or working near the World Trade Center towers. The staff of this study assesses the children using psychological testing every year and interviews the mothers every six months. The purpose of the study is to determine whether there is significant difference in development and health progression of children whose mothers were exposed, versus those who were not exposed after the WTC collapse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cpmcnet.columbia.edu/dept/sph/ccceh/research/wtc_pregnancy.html|title=CCCEH Study of the Effects of 9/11 on Pregnant Women and Newborns|year=2006|publisher=Columbia University|work=World Trade Center Pregnancy Study|access-date=September 8, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910090040/http://cpmcnet.columbia.edu/dept/sph/ccceh/research/wtc_pregnancy.html|archive-date=September 10, 2006}}</ref>

An ongoing [[Pennsylvania State University]]/[[Monmouth University]] study reported that [[respiratory]] illnesses grew by more than two hundred percent in the year and a half after the September 11 attacks. (This was the first study that monitored police officers at the Ground Zero site. It was published in the "Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.") In this study of 471 police officers, 19 percent of the officers in October 2001 experienced shortness of breath; 44 percent of the officers experienced shortness of breath in April 2003.

[[File:EPA WTC 2001-10-10.jpg|thumb|An Environmental Protection Agency employee checks one of the many air sampling locations set up around the site of the World Trade Center.]]

President [[George W.

===Early statement by Christine Todd Whitman===
On September 18, 2001, [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency|EPA administrator]] [[Christine Todd Whitman]] told the public, via a [[press release]], "We are very encouraged that the results from our monitoring of air-quality and drinking-water conditions in both New York and near the Pentagon show that the public in these areas is not being exposed to excessive levels of asbestos or other harmful substances" and that "Given the scope of the tragedy from last week, I am glad to reassure the people of New York … that their air is safe to breathe and the water is safe to drink."<ref name="kristenlombardi" />

===Alleged EPA deceptions about Ground Zero air quality===
{{See also|United States Environmental Protection Agency September 11 attacks pollution controversy}}
An August 2003 report by the Office of the Inspector General of the EPA said the Bush administration pressured the EPA to remove cautionary information about the air quality at Ground Zero.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oig/reports/2003/WTC_report_20030821.pdf|title=EPA's Office of Inspector General|last=EPA,OIG|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=November 16, 2016}}</ref>

Numerous key differences between the draft versions and final versions of EPA statements were found. A recommendation that homes and businesses near ground zero be cleaned by professionals was replaced by a request that citizens follow orders from NYC officials. Another statement that showed concerns about "sensitive populations" was deleted altogether. Language used to describe excessive amounts of asbestos in the area was altered drastically to minimize the dangers it posed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0823-03.htm |title=EPA Misled Public on 9/11 Pollution |date=August 23, 2003 |publisher=Newsday |author=Laurie Garrett |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120200307/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0823-03.htm |archive-date=November 20, 2006 }}</ref>

In September 2006, the [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security]] held a two-day hearing on illnesses caused by post-9/11 air quality.

===Alleged government downplaying of health risks===
Critics assert that government officials – notably Bush, Christine Todd Whitman (former head of the US EPA), and New York City mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] – downplayed the health risks of the area and rushed to reopen the area around Ground Zero, although this posed a grave and immediate health risk to first responders.<ref>Persons interviewed in ''Dust to Dust:The Health Effects of 9/11.''</ref> Many corporations were eager to hear the news of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] being reopened only a few days after the collapse.<ref name="autogenerated2">Juan Gonzalez, "Former head of EPA Whitman doesn't second guess opening up lower Manhattan after 9/11", ''New York Daily News'', June 26, 2007, p. 5</ref> On June 25, 2007, Whitman testified before a [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] committee chaired by [[Jerrold Nadler]]. She said that a [[White House]] official informed her that President Bush expected that the Financial District would reopen within three days, that is, by September 14. She said that she replied that this would be cumbersome, since the EPA was still judging the health situation in the area.<ref name="autogenerated2" />
Investigations after the attacks suggest that the Bush administration pressured Whitman and Giuliani to provide health reassurances in order to keep Wall Street operating.<ref name="andrewstephen">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2007/06/york-air-death-city-breathe|title=The poisonous legacy of 9/11|website=www.newstatesman.com|access-date=November 16, 2016}}</ref><ref name="bensmith">Ben Smith, Rudy's Black Cloud: WTC Health Risks May Hurt Prez Bid."

In the first month after the attacks, the mayor said, "The air quality is safe and acceptable."<ref name="anitagates" />

In November 2001, Giuliani wrote to the city's Congressional delegation and urged that the city's [[legal liability|liability]] for Ground Zero illnesses be limited, in total, at $350 million. Two years after Mayor Giuliani finished his term, FEMA appropriated $1 billion to a special insurance fund to protect the city against 9/11 lawsuits.<ref name="anthonydepalma">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/nyregion/14giuliani.html|title=Ground Zero Illnesses Clouding Giuliani's Legacy|last=Depalma|first=Anthony|date=May 14, 2007|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=November 16, 2016}}</ref>

In a September 18, 2006 ''New York Daily News'' article titled, "Rudy's Black Cloud: WTC health risks may hurt Prez Bid", [[Sally Regenhard]], mother of firefighter Christian Regenhard who died on September 11, is quoted, "There's a large and growing number of both FDNY families, FDNY members, former and current, and civilian families who want to expose the true failures of the Giuliani administration when it comes to 9/11." She told the ''New York Daily News'' that she intends to "[[Swiftboating|Swift Boat]]" Giuliani.<ref name="bensmith" />

Then senator [[Hillary Clinton]] contemplated calling Giuliani to testify before a Senate committee on whether the government failed to protect recovery workers from the effects of polluted Ground Zero air.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-giuliani8apr08,0,2321840,print.story?coll=la-home-headlines |title=Giuliani foes plan to use 9/11 against him |last=Wallsten |first=Peter |date=April 8, 2007 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=May 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621112054/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-giuliani8apr08%2C0%2C2321840%2Cprint.story?coll=la-home-headlines |archive-date=June 21, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/49582|title=Potential Clinton-Giuliani Battle Brews Over 9/11 Health Issues|access-date=June 15, 2015}}</ref>

Congressman Nadler was quoted in a March 1, 2007, "New York Sun" article, "Potential Clinton-Giuliani Battle Brews Over 9/11 Health Issues." He said that he "absolutely" wishes to interview Giuliani administration officials regarding the environment in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. He asked, "Who made decisions, if any, that resulted unnecessarily in a lot of people getting sick?"<ref>Russell Berman, "Potential Clinton-Giuliani Battle Brews Over 9/11 Health Issues", ''New York Sun', March 1, 2007''</ref>

===Handling of cleanup procedure===
A May 14, 2007, ''New York Times'' article, "Ground Zero Illness Clouding Giuliani's Legacy", gave the interpretation that thousands of workers at Ground Zero have become sick and that "many regard Mr. Giuliani's triumph of leadership as having come with a human cost." The article reported that he seized control of the cleanup of Ground Zero, taking control away from established federal agencies, such as the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]. He instead handed over responsibility to the "largely unknown" city Department of Design and Construction. Documents indicate that the Giuliani administration never enforced federal requirements requiring the wearing of [[respirators]]. Concurrently, the administration threatened companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed.<ref name="anthonydepalma" />

Workers worked without proper respirators. They wore painters' masks or no covering. Specialists claim that the only effective protection against toxins such as airborne asbestos, is a special respirator. New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health industrial hygienist David Newman said, "I was down there watching people working without respirators." He continued, "Others took off their respirators to eat. It was a surreal, ridiculous, unacceptable situation."<ref name="michaelmason" />

The local EPA office sidelined the regional EPA office. Dr. Cate Jenkins, a whistle-blower EPA scientist, said that on September 12, 2001, a regional EPA office offered to dispatch 30 to 40 electron microscopes to the WTC pit to test bulk dust samples for the presence of asbestos fibers. Instead, the local office chose the less effective polarized light microscopy testing method. Dr. Jenkins alleged that the local office refused, saying, "We don't want you f—ing cowboys here. The best thing they could do is reassign you to Alaska."<ref name="michaelmason" />

===Lawsuit, settlement, and treatment costs===
First responders and other individuals are suing the City of New York. Lawyers are criticizing the city for failing to provide proper facial [[ventilators]] to [[Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11, 2001 attacks|clean-up workers]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/23/nyregion/23responders.html|title=9/11 Suit Tests New York Stand on Immunity|last=Depalma|first=Anthony|date=June 23, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=November 16, 2016}}</ref>

On November 19, 2010, attorneys said that plaintiffs accepted a settlement which should lead to $625 million being paid to more than 10,000 workers experiencing problems as a result of inadequate preparation to work at Ground Zero. Not all affected participated, but those who did not would be eligible for a portion of $7.4 billion provided by the [[James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act]], which the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] passed in September 2010. New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] asked the [[United States Senate|Senate]] to do the same.

On October 28, 2007, Jim Riches reported that the City of New York and litigating first responders have shown interest in a [[legal settlement]], to resolve lawsuits against the city.

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] issued a study on July 17, 2007, indicating that the estimates for monthly costs of treating Ground Zero workers had increased from around $6 million per month to $20 million per month by the end of 2007. The causes of the increased expense lie in the increasing numbers of workers getting sick and the worsening illnesses of workers. This indicated that the planned U.S. House appropriation legislation (of $50 million) for the sick workers, for the coming year, would be inadequate. The number of workers that have registered with area hospitals' Ground Zero programs has reached 37,000. With about 500 new workers registering each month, the institute estimated that the number of registrants could reach 65,000 in two years.

===World Trade Center health administrators===
On June 11, 2007, Mayor Bloomberg appointed Jeffrey Hon as World Trade Center health coordinator. Hon had previously worked as the spokesman for the [[American Red Cross]] September 11 Recovery Program. People have offered conflicting statements, however, regarding Hon's role. In an interview with the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' Hon said that his role was to correct inconsistencies in city agencies and to handle related pension issues. Yet, Mayor Bloomberg said that Hon's role would not involve handling pension-related issues. A press release also indicated that the coordinator will "provide a central repository of WTC health information and ensure effective communication with those who may be experiencing 9/11-related health effects."<ref>Jordan Lite and Michael Saul, ''Daily News'', June 12, 2007, p. 4</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://media-newswire.com/release_1052193.html|title=Media-Newswire.com - Press Release Distribution - PR Agency|last=Distribution|first=Media-Newswire.com - Press Release|website=media-newswire.com|access-date=November 16, 2016}}</ref>

Dr. [[John Howard (public health administrator)|John Howard]] was appointed the medical administrator of the federal [[World Trade Center Health Program]] funded through the [[Zadroga Act|James Zadroga Act]]. On July 22, 2011, Howard's report on a study of a link between particulate exposure in the aftermath and cancer was released. The report said that there was insufficient evidence of a link between particulate exposure and cancer. The report's findings meant that many first responders to the attacks would be limited in their access to funds for medical treatment. Three New York Congressional delegation Representatives, [[Peter T. King]], [[Carolyn B. Maloney]] and [[Jerrold Nadler]], said that they believed that further studies would indicate a link between exposures and cancer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/nyregion/not-enough-evidence-to-link-911-and-cancer-report-finds.html|title=Not Enough Evidence to Link 9/11 and Cancer, Report Finds|last=Hartocollis|first=Anemona|date=July 26, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=November 16, 2016}}</ref>

=== Lawsuit by area residents ===
Lower Manhattan and [[Brooklyn]] residents brought a 111-page lawsuit against the EPA for purported deception of the public about hazards of Ground Zero air and dust. A major force behind this effort is Brooklyn resident Jenna Orkin of the World Trade Center Environmental Organization. On February 2, 2006, Federal Court Judge [[Deborah Batts]] issued an 83-page statement, indicating that there are sufficient grounds for the case to proceed. She also rejected granting Whitman immunity from the lawsuit.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/truth-out-6399648|title=Truth Out|last=Lombardi|first=Kristen|date=February 14, 2006|newspaper=Village Voice|access-date=November 16, 2016}}</ref>

On December 10, 2007, legal proceedings began in a case on the question of responsibility of government officials in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks. Former EPA Director Whitman is among the defendants in the suit; plaintiffs in the suit allege that Whitman is at fault for saying that the downtown Manhattan air was safe in the aftermath of the attacks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/12/11/2007-12-11_christie_whitman_lied_about_ground_zero_.html|title=Christie lied, panel is told|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=November 16, 2016}}</ref>

On April 22, 2008, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] ruled that EPA head Whitman could not be held liable for saying to World Trade Center area residents that the air was safe for breathing after the buildings collapse. The appeals court said that Whitman had based her information on contradictory information and statements from President Bush. The [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] had argued that holding the agency liable would establish a risky [[legal precedent]] because future public officials would be afraid to make public statements. Judge [[Deborah Batts]] had previously declined to dismiss Whitman as a defendant, saying that her actions were "conscience-shocking".<ref>The [[Associated Press]] April 22, 2008, https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-EPA-Sept-11-Lawsuit.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=whitman&st=nyt&oref=slogin</ref>

An arbitrator has said that most of the complainants that did not participate in an earlier fund (created by Congress) would be granted settlement awards. The awards would total $500 million.

=== Ground Zero workers' and area residents' protests ===
On January 30, 2007, Ground Zero workers and groups such as [[Sierra Club]] and Unsung Heroes Helping Heroes met at the Ground Zero site and urged President [[George W. Bush]] to spend more money on aid for sick Ground Zero workers. They said that the $25 million that Bush promised for the ill workers was inadequate. A Long Island iron-worker, John Sferazo, at the protest rally said, "Why has it taken you 5½ years to meet with us, Mr. President?"<ref name="emiendo" />

Area residents joined the protest. Mariama James, who lives within blocks of the Ground Zero site, said that she became ill after cleaning the Ground Zero debris and dust from her apartment. "Recovery workers aren't the only people that were affected by this disaster," she said. "There are other people in need of treatment and monitoring."<ref name="emiendo" />

===Ground Zero workers' lawsuit===
Families of Ground Zero workers have filed a mass lawsuit against the city. Andrew Carboy of the firm, Sulivan, Pappain, Block, McGrath and Cannovo said of the deaths of Cesar Borja, James Zadroga, and Mark DeBiase, "If Borja, Zadroga and now DeBiase isn't a wakeup call for the city, I don't know what will wake them."<ref name="carlcampanile-kinsuing" />

==Vulnerable individuals==

In 2008, the lead researcher of a [[New York State Department of Health]] study informed ''[[The New York Post]]'' of a study documenting at least 204 deaths of rescue and recovery workers since September 11, 2001. The researchers for the study confirmed 98 deaths with death certificates. The researchers showed that 77 persons died of illnesses, including 55 from lung and various other cancers. Kitty Gelberg, New York state Bureau of Occupational Health's chief epidemiologist said, "We're not saying they are all World Trade Center related; we're just saying this is what people are dying from." Many of the 55 responders who died from cancer had cancer before September 11, 2001, but most of the cancer patients developed the disease afterward.<ref name="autogenerated1">Susan Edelman, "Charting post-9/11 deaths", ''New York Post'', January 6, 2008, p. 2</ref>

The 98 deaths up to 2008 included:
*55 cancers
*21 traumatic injuries (motor-vehicle crashes, gunshots and five homicides, including four cops killed in the line of duty)
*12 heart disease, including 10 heart attacks
*2 [[sarcoidosis]]
*1 [[polyneuropathy]] (neorological disorder)

==== Legal ====
Surviving first responders and their advocates are asserting that their illnesses have resulted from exposure to toxins at Ground Zero. The [[Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of the City of New York]] (PBA) filed a lawsuit to secure benefits for Officer Christopher Hynes, 36. In March 2004 he was diagnosed as having sarcoidosis. However, the NYPD has refused to bestow line-of-duty injury status to him. Hynes had worked for 111 hours at Ground Zero and its vicinity. He claims that he was never given a proper respirator for his work at Ground Zero. He has had difficulty in paying medical bills because of the denial of line-of-duty status. One medical provider sued him for $3,094 for medical bills. The provider eventually settled out of court for $1,625. The PBA noted that firefighters, by contrast, have been given line-of-duty status for their injuries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/06022007/news/regionalnews/pba_sues_to_boot_9_11_air_victim_regionalnews_david_seifman.htm |title=PBA SUES TO BOO$T '9/11 AIR VICTIM' {{!}} By DAVID SEIFMAN {{!}} New York News {{!}} New York City News {{!}} NY News |date=September 29, 2007 |access-date=November 16, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929152919/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06022007/news/regionalnews/pba_sues_to_boot_9_11_air_victim_regionalnews_david_seifman.htm |archive-date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=6&aid=70319 |title=NY1: Law Enforcement |date=September 27, 2007 |access-date=November 16, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002945/http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=6&aid=70319 |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>

===Various volunteers===
Hundreds of volunteer firefighters, construction workers, health professionals, clergy, and other individuals descended upon the scene in the days immediately following the attacks. These individuals volunteered directly at the Ground Zero site or cared for traumatized responders. Among individuals in the latter group, newspaper accounts have cited South Carolinian [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] nun, [[Sister Cindy Mahoney|Sister Cindy Mahoney's]] death as a fatality of Ground Zero illness. Mahoney spent several months attending to first responders' spiritual needs. Two weeks prior to her death, she was cut off from her insurance.

Sen. [[Hillary Clinton]] on Sister Mahoney and Ground Zero illness: "We know that so many are now suffering health effects from breathing the toxic air at Ground Zero … Yet there are still some who doubt the link. By raising attention to her own devastating illness, Sister Mahoney will continue as she did in life, to help those affected by 9/11."<ref name="davegoldiner" />

===Communication workers===
Communications recovery worker Mark DeBiase, aged 41, died on April 9, 2006, from a Ground Zero illness. He worked without protective gear for restoring communications at the site. "DeBiase's work was so crucial in emergency workers to communicate that he was shuttled between locations in a military helicopter," according to his father, Angelo DeBiase.<ref name="carlcampanile-kinsuing" />

===Janitorial workers===
Manuel Checo is one of many janitors that performed cleanup work who now suffer from ''[[World Trade Center cough]].'' He spent six months at the site. Compounding janitorial workers' troubles, three-quarters of them lack health insurance.<ref name="latimes3275974" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2006/oct/14/nation/na-cleaners14|title=Lost in the Dust of 9/11|last=Barry|first=Ellen|date=October 14, 2006|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=November 16, 2016}}</ref>

===Financial district personnel===
Civil rights attorney Felicia Dunn-Jones, 42, died February 10, 2002, from [[sarcoidosis]].

Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] acted quickly to "reopen [[Wall Street]]." The Wall Street area reopened for business on September 17.

===Educators and students===
Students and staff at [[Stuyvesant High School]] returned to the school which lies within one-third of a mile north of the World Trade Center site, while fires were still burning at Ground Zero. Alumni are circulating a petition for greater attention to health problems related to the Ground Zero air.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asthmamoms.com/worldtradecenterarticles2001.htm |title=AsthmaMoms World Trade Center: Environmental Health Articles 2001 |date=February 2, 2012 |access-date=November 16, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202132450/http://asthmamoms.com/worldtradecenterarticles2001.htm |archive-date=February 2, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stuyhealth.blogspot.com/2006_03_01_stuyhealth_archive.html|title=StuyHealth: March 2006|author=StuyHealth|access-date=June 15, 2015}}</ref> There is a debate over whether the 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander's developing cancer is related to Ground Zero air.

In addition, the students and staff members at the [[Murry Bergtraum High School]] returned to the building a couple of days after the attack, with the air system in the school severely affected and damaged from the debris and dust from the World Trade Center site (the school is three-quarters of a mile east of the site). Several teachers, particularly from the business department, and students have developed asthma and other breathing problems because of the lack of unpolluted air and the failure to clean the school's central air system thoroughly years after the attack.
