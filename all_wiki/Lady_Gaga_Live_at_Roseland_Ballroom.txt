'''Lady Gaga Live at Roseland Ballroom''' was the first [[concert residency]] by American singer [[Lady Gaga]]. Performed at the [[Roseland Ballroom]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the residency began on March 28 and concluded on April 7, 2014, after completing seven shows. It was the final event hosted by the venue after it was announced that it was being closed down and being replaced with a 42-story skyscraper. Gaga revealed that Roseland was the only venue in New York City that she had never played, although she had visited there previously to watch shows. A poster announcing the event was released, showing an old image of Gaga taken before the time she became successful as a recording artist.

As an homage to the venue, the stage was decorated with roses. The multi-leveled set-up consisted of New York City [[fire escape]] routes. Other parts of the stage had a ladder reaching the [[mezzanine]] floors and a replica of an [[F (New York City Subway service)|F train]] carriage. Gaga's wardrobe was also rose themed, with leotards, hats and jackets, and instruments adorned with red roses. The main [[set list]] for the residency encompassed songs from ''[[The Fame]]'', ''[[The Fame Monster]]'', ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'', and ''[[Artpop]]''. Some tracks were performed in acoustic versions.

The residency received positive reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]]. Reviewers were impressed by Gaga's vocals, the choreography, and the overall presentation of the residency. The shows were sold out with ticket prices being above the average costs of tickets at the venue. ''Billboard'' revealed that the seven dates had sold a total of 24,532 tickets while grossing a total of $1.5 million. Two performances from the residency were transmitted on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', while [[MTV]] and [[Logo TV]] collaborated to show the behind-the-scenes logistics for the residency. The final show on April 7, 2014 was [[live-streamed]] by [[Verizon Communications]].

According to Gaga, playing at the Roseland Ballroom was always a dream of hers. She explained to John Seabrook of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that "It's basically the only room in the city I ''haven't'' played." As a young girl, she could not afford tickets, but she did manage to win free tickets to a [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] show during her senior year of high school. Gaga recalled that she fell down during the show and got her nose broken, making her parents forbid her from visiting Roseland. After the singer's career took off with the release of debut album, ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008), she bypassed playing at the venue until its closure.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lady Gaga's Roseland Rehearsals|url=https://www.newyorker.com/talk/2014/04/07/140407ta_talk_seabrook|first=John|last=Seabrook|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=April 7, 2014|accessdate=March 29, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329081403/http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2014/04/07/140407ta_talk_seabrook|archivedate=March 29, 2014}}</ref> Gaga revealed the official poster for the residency on March 18, 2014.

The main [[set list]] for the residency included songs from ''[[The Fame]]'', ''[[The Fame Monster]]'', ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'', and ''[[Artpop]]''. The show began with Gaga appearing on top of the platforms and danced towards her piano to perform an acoustic version of "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]", before proceeding to dance on the rafters with her backup troupe to "Black Jesus + Amen Fashion" in her purple leotard and jacket. A costume change ensued and Gaga performed "[[Monster (Lady Gaga song)|Monster]]" wearing a crimson leather body suit and roses atop her head. She played the rose-adorned [[keytar]] and gradually segued into "[[Bad Romance]]". Middle of the performance, she ran to the left of the stage to climb a ladder to the mezannine floors, where she sang the final chorus and "[[Sexxx Dreams]]" followed with energetic dance moves.

Gaga moved towards the F train stage on the right, and sang the piano ballads "[[Dope (Lady Gaga song)|Dope]]" and "[[You and I (Lady Gaga song)|You and I]]", interspersed with monologues about the venue, her beginnings as a singer in New York and addictions. The third costume change took place with the performance of "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]", where she wore yellow hot pants and metallic chest plates, while being accompanied by her full troupe of nine dancers. An intermediate break was introduced with Gaga playing another keytar. "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" followed, being played by Gaga on the piano. The song was rearranged to include lyrics about the venue and New York. "[[Artpop (song)|Artpop]]" was then played as an interlude.

The final song of the set was "[[Applause (Lady Gaga song)|Applause]]", where Gaga wore another costume, this time the purple bikini and jacket. Towards the end of the performance, confetti rained on the audience and after a brief interlude Gaga appeared in a white jumpsuit for an encore of "[[G.U.Y.]]" The singer showed provocative dance moves while straddling her backup performers, and executed choreography similar to the song's music video. The show ended with Gaga and her troupe taking a bow to the audience and thanking Roseland.

Andrew Hammp of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' called the residency "electrifying" though he felt that "If SXSW served as a statement about how brands should fund artists' creative expression, Gaga's Roseland residency was about giving the people what they wanted. ... . [The] night ended rather abruptly after almost exactly 60 minutes".<ref name="Billboard opening night review"/> A writer for ''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'' called the show "short but sweet" and praised her for never showing "signs of slowing down" throughout the show.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lady Gaga plays it short, but sweet|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/international/lady-gaga-plays-it-short-but-sweet-1.292249|newspaper=[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]|date=March 29, 2014|accessdate=March 29, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329094241/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/international/lady-gaga-plays-it-short-but-sweet-1.292249|archivedate=March 29, 2014}}</ref> James Montgomery of [[MTV News]] praised the overall show, calling it "heavy on the hits, sublimely sexual, suitably sentimental—both for her glory days and the iconic venue she's closing with this seven-night stand—and ridiculous in all the right ways". He noted that the abrupt ending of the show was compensated by Gaga's dancing and singing, which in turn helped counteract the negative press she had been receiving since the release of ''Artpop''.<ref name="mtv">{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=James|title=Lady Gaga At Roseland: The Pop Powerhouse Returns|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1725061/lady-gaga-roseland-ballroom-new-york-city.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|date=March 29, 2014|accessdate=March 29, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329155619/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1725061/lady-gaga-roseland-ballroom-new-york-city.jhtml|archivedate=March 29, 2014}}</ref> Glenn Gamboa from ''[[Newsday]]'' called the show "fierce" and "brainy", saying that the singer "fired up" from the moment she took the stage, displaying an avant-garde artistic sensibility.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga rules Roseland Ballroom|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/backstage-pass-1.811987/lady-gaga-rules-roseland-ballroom-1.7568974|work=[[Newsday]]|accessdate=April 1, 2014|date=April 1, 2013|last=Gamboa|first=Glenn|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091401/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/backstage-pass-1.811987/lady-gaga-rules-roseland-ballroom-1.7568974|archivedate=April 7, 2014}}</ref> Jon Caramanica of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the show part of the "Supernova" phase of her career and explained,

<blockquote>Gaga grounds this sort of spectacle with her voice. She is still a fearsome singer when she chooses to be, which is to say rarely on records but often in concert ... What she gave the faithful was easy to digest: largely bulletproof pop, swinging back and forth between brooding, panting torch songs delivered at top volume and grand-scale 1980s-style digital rock with a nightclub twist.<ref>{{cite news|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|title=On Stage, Lady Gaga's Artistry Endures|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/31/arts/music/on-stage-lady-gagas-artistry-endures.html|accessdate=March 29, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 29, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410140547/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/31/arts/music/on-stage-lady-gagas-artistry-endures.html|archivedate=April 10, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

Adam Markovitz from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' declared that if the "Roseland show is any indication, Gaga's not going anywhere anytime soon", in spite of the overall negative reception towards her campaigns for ''[[Artpop]]''. He welcomed the absence of any art-related things in the show and commended the focus on music, Gaga's vocals and abilities as an entertainer. Markovitz also complimented Gaga's rapport with the audience members and rated the performances of "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" and "[[Bad Romance]]" as highlights.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2014/03/31/gaga-roseland/|title=Lady Gaga live at New York's Roseland Ballroom: Dispatches from the edge of glory|last=Markovitz|first=Adam|date=March 31, 2014|accessdate=April 1, 2014|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331193807/http://music-mix.ew.com/2014/03/31/gaga-roseland/|archivedate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> Markos Papadatos from Digital Journal website declared Gaga as a "pop muse" for the performances. He complimented the choice of songs in the [[set list]] calling them "eclectic" and felt they "displayed different sides to her craft".

Hilary Hughes from ''[[USA Today]]'' also noticed Gaga's vocal range, especially during the acoustic interpretation of "[[Dope (Lady Gaga song)|Dope]]" and "Just Dance".
