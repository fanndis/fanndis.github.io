The '''Al-Hamidiyah Souq''' ({{Lang-ar|'''سوق الحميدية'''}}) is the largest and the central [[souk]] in [[Syria]], located inside the old walled city of [[Damascus]] next to the [[Citadel of Damascus|Citadel]]. The souq is about {{convert|600|m|ft|-2}} long <ref name="discoversyria">[http://www.discover-syria.com/bank/52 سوق الحميدية - اكتشف سورية]</ref><ref name="arabweekly">[http://www.thearabweekly.com/Levant/2448/Al-Hamidiyah-Souk%2C-main-Damascus-shopping-centre Al-Hamidiyah Souk, main Damascus shopping centre - The Arab Weekly]</ref> and {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} wide,<ref name="discoversyria"/> and is covered by a {{convert|10|m|ft|0|adj=on}} tall metal arch. <ref name="discoversyria"/> The souq starts at Al-Thawra street and ends at the [[Umayyad Mosque]] plaza, and the ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Temple of Jupiter, Damascus|Temple of Jupiter]] stands 40 feet tall in its entrance.

The souq dates back to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, being built along the axis of the Roman route to the [[Temple of Jupiter, Damascus|Temple of Jupiter]] <ref name="arabweekly"/> around 1780 during the reign of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid I]],<ref name="discoversyria"/> and later extended during the reign of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]].<ref name="discoversyria"/> Nowadays it is one of the most popular shopping districts in Syria, being lined with hundreds of clothes emporiums, handicraft shops selling traditional crafts and jewelry, cafés, grocery stores, food stalls and ice cream parlors.<ref name="arabweekly"/> Before the ongoing [[Syrian Civil War]], it was one of Damascus's main attractions and was visited by many foreigners including Europeans and Gulf Arabs;<ref name="arabweekly"/> however, it still remains a popular attraction between locals and Syrians.<ref name="arabweekly"/>

Although there have been many violent clashes around Damascus and in some of its neighborhoods, the souq has not been affected in any way by the ongoing war, although peaceful protests and demonstrations have taken place in the nearby [[Medhat Pasha Souq]] which extends from the Al Hamidiyah Souq.

It was one of the treasures featured in the 2005 [[BBC]] documentary ''[[Around the World in 80 Treasures]]'' presented by [[Dan Cruickshank]].
