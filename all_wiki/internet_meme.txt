{{Internet}} 
An '''Internet meme''', more commonly known simply as a '''meme''' ({{IPAc-en|m|iː|m}} {{respell|MEEM}}), is a type of [[meme]] that is spread via the [[Internet]], often through [[social media platforms]] and especially for humorous purposes. Memes can spread from person to person via [[social network]]s, [[blog]]s, direct [[email]], or news sources. They may relate to various existing [[Internet culture]]s or [[subculture]]s, often created or spread on various websites. One hallmark of Internet memes is the appropriation of a part of broader culture, for instance by giving words and phrases intentional misspellings (such as [[lolcat]]s) or using incorrect grammar (such as [[Doge (meme)|doge]]). In particular, many memes utilize [[popular culture]] (especially in [[image macros]] of other media), although this can lead to issues with [[copyright]].

Instant communication on the Internet facilitates [[word of mouth]] transmission, resulting in [[fad]]s and sensations that tend to grow rapidly. An example of such a fad is that of [[Planking (fad)|planking]] (lying down in public places); posting a photo of someone planking online brings attention to the fad and allows it to reach many people in little time. The internet also facilitates the rapid evolution of memes. “Dank” memes have emerged as a new form of image-macros, and many modern memes take on inclusion of [[Surrealism|surreal]], nonsensical, and non-sequitur themes.

Colloquially, the terms ''meme'' and ''Internet meme'' may refer to pieces of media that are designed in the format of true Internet memes, but which are not themselves intended to spread or evolve, and which have recently become umbrella terms referring to any piece of quickly-consumed comedic or relatable content. What is considered a meme may vary across different communities on the Internet and is subject to change over time: traditionally, memes consisted of a combination of [[image macros]] and a concept or catchphrase, but the concept has since become broader and more multi-faceted, evolving to include more elaborate structures such as challenges, [[GIF]]s, videos, and [[Viral phenomenon|viral sensations]].

== Characteristics ==
There are two central attributes of Internet memes: creative reproduction of materials and [[intertextuality]]. Creative reproduction refers to "parodies, remixes, or mashups," and include notable examples such as "''Hitler's Downfall'' Parodies",<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Shifman|first=Limor|title=Memes in Digital Culture|publisher=CRC Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1-4619-4733-2|oclc=926526630}}</ref> and "''[[Nyan Cat]]''", among others. [[Intertextuality]] may be demonstrated through memes that combine different cultures; for example, a meme may combine United States politician [[Mitt Romney]]'s assertion of the phrase "[[binders full of women]]" from a 2012 US presidential debate with the Korean pop song "[[Gangnam Style in popular culture|Gangnam style]]" by overlaying the politician's quote onto a frame from [[Psy]]'s music video where paper blows around him. The intertextuality in the example gives new meaning to the paper blowing around Psy, the meme indexes intertextual practices in political and cultural discourses of two nations.<ref name=":3" />

The spread of Internet memes has been described as occurring via two mechanisms: [[mimicry]] and [[remix]]. Remix occurs when the original meme is altered in some way, while mimicry occurs when the meme is recreated in a different fashion to the original.<ref name=":032">{{Cite book|last=Shifman|first=Limor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZI9AQAAQBAJ&q=memes&pg=PP6|title=Memes in Digital Culture|date=2014|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-52543-5|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Madison|date=2019-04-09|title=Meme-ology: Studying Patterns in Viral Media|url=https://medium.com/@madisonicole/meme-ology-studying-patterns-in-viral-media-f1931b3d1c7e|access-date=2020-11-26|website=Medium|language=en}}</ref> The results in the study of ''Online Memes, Affinities, and Cultural Production,'' show that the internet directly adds some longevity in a meme's lifespan.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Knobel|first1=Michele|last2=Lankshear|first2=Colin|date=2018|title=Online memes, affinities and cultural production (2018 update to our 2007 chapter) To appear as: Knobel, M. and Lankshear, C.

== Evolution and propagation ==
[[File:Typical internet meme image format.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Typical format for image macros.]]
An Internet meme may stay the same or may evolve over time, by chance or through commentary, imitations, [[parody]], or by incorporating news accounts about itself. Internet memes can evolve and spread extremely rapidly, sometimes reaching worldwide popularity within a few days. Internet memes usually are formed from some social interaction, pop culture reference, or situations people often find themselves in. Their rapid growth and impact has caught the attention of both researchers and industry.<ref name="researchSN">{{Cite conference |first1=David |last1=Kempe |first2=Jon |last2=Kleinberg |first3=Éva |last3=Tardos |title=Maximizing the spread of influence through a social network |publisher=ACM Press |booktitle=Int.

Commercially, they are used in [[viral marketing]] where they are an inexpensive form of mass advertising.

One empirical approach studied meme characteristics and behavior independently from the networks in which they propagated, and reached a set of conclusions concerning successful meme propagation.<ref name="CosciaHarvardCID2013">{{Cite arXiv|eprint=1304.1712|class=physics.soc-ph|first=Michele|last=Coscia|title=Competition and Success in the Meme Pool: a Case Study on Quickmeme.com|date=April 5, 2013}} Paper explained for laymen by {{Cite web|last=Mims|first=Christopher|date=June 28, 2013|title=Why you'll share this story: The new science of memes|url=http://qz.com/98677/why-youll-share-this-story-the-new-science-of-memes/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703055640/http://qz.com/98677/why-youll-share-this-story-the-new-science-of-memes/|archivedate=July 3, 2013|website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]}}</ref> For example, the study asserted that Internet memes not only ''compete'' for viewer attention generally resulting in a shorter life, but also, through user creativity, memes can ''collaborate'' with each other and achieve greater survival.<ref name="CosciaHarvardCID2013" /> Also, paradoxically, an individual meme that experiences a popularity peak significantly higher than its average popularity is not generally expected to survive unless it is unique, whereas a meme with no such popularity peak keeps being used together with other memes and thus has greater survivability.<ref name="CosciaHarvardCID2013" />

Internet memes have been examined by Dancygier and Vandelanotte in 2017 for aspects of cognitive linguistic and construction grammar. The authors analyzed some selective popular image macros like, Said no one ever, One does not simply, But that's none of my business, and Good Girl Gina to draw attention to the constructionally, multimodality, viewpoint and intersubjectivity of these memes. They further argued that with the combination of text and images, the Internet memes can add to the functioning linguistic construction frame as well as create new linguistic constructions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Dancygier|first1=Barbara|last2=Vandelanotte|first2=Lieven|date=2017-08-28|title=Internet memes as multimodal constructions|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/cogl/28/3/article-p565.xml|journal=Cognitive Linguistics|volume=28|issue=3|pages=565–598|doi=10.1515/cog-2017-0074|s2cid=149309447|issn=0936-5907}}</ref>

Writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 2013, Dominic Basulto asserted that with the growth of the Internet and the practices of the marketing and advertising industries, memes have come to transmit fewer snippets of human culture that could survive for centuries as originally envisioned by Dawkins, and instead transmit banality at the expense of big ideas.<ref name=WashingtonPost20130705>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2013/07/05/have-internet-memes-lost-their-meaning/ |title=Have Internet memes lost their meaning? |last=Basulto |first=Dominic |date=July 5, 2013 |website=The Washington Post |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705202602/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2013/07/05/have-internet-memes-lost-their-meaning/ |archivedate=July 5, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==

=== Origins and early memes ===
The word ''[[meme]]'' was coined by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' as an attempt to explain how ideas replicate, mutate, and evolve ([[memetics]]).<ref name="cream" /> The concept of the Internet meme was first proposed by [[Mike Godwin]] in the June 1993 issue of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''. In 2013, Dawkins characterized an Internet meme as being a meme deliberately altered by human creativity—distinguished from biological genes and his own pre-Internet concept of a meme, which involved mutation by random change and spreading through accurate replication as in Darwinian selection.<ref name="Wired20130620">{{Cite journal|last=Solon|first=Olivia|date=June 20, 2013|title=Richard Dawkins on The Internet's hijacking of the word 'meme'|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/20/richard-dawkins-memes|url-status=dead|journal=Wired UK|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709152558/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/20/richard-dawkins-memes|archivedate=July 9, 2013}}</ref> Dawkins explained that Internet memes are thus a "hijacking of the original idea", the very idea of a meme having mutated and evolved in this new direction.<ref name="Saatchi20130622">{{Cite web|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|date=June 22, 2013|title=Just for Hits|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFn-ixX9edg|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617051511/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFn-ixX9edg|archive-date=June 17, 2015|access-date=June 16, 2015|website=The Saatchi & Saatchi New Directors' Showcase}} (video of speech)</ref> Furthermore, Internet memes carry an additional property that ordinary memes do not: Internet memes leave a footprint in the media through which they propagate (for example, social networks) that renders them traceable and analyzable.<ref name="CosciaHarvardCID2013" />

Internet memes grew as a concept in the mid-1990s. At the time, memes were just short clips that were shared between people in [[Usenet]] forums.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} As the Internet evolved, so did memes. When [[YouTube]] was released in 2005, video memes became popular. Around this time, [[rickrolling]] became popular and the link to this video was sent around via email or other messaging sites. Video sharing also created memes such as "[[Turn Down for What]]" and the "[[Harlem Shake (meme)|Harlem Shake]]". As social media websites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] started appearing, it was now easy to share [[GIF]]s and [[image macro]]s to a large audience. Meme generator websites were created to let users create their own memes out of existing templates. Memes during this time could remain popular for a long time, from a few months to a decade, which contrasts with the fast lifespan of modern memes.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/story/guide-memes/ |title=The WIRED Guide to Memes |magazine=Wired|access-date=November 30, 2018 |first1=Angela |last1=Watercutter |first2=Emma |last2=Grey Ellisby |date=April 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201164321/https://www.wired.com/story/guide-memes/|archive-date=February 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Over the years, many memes have originated on the [[4chan]] website, which have been described as "the cradle of memes, [[Internet troll|trolling]] and [[alterculture]]"; major memes popularized by that site include [[lolcat]]s as well as the [[pedobear]].<ref name="JemielniakPrzegalinska202023">{{cite book|author1=Dariusz Jemielniak|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLDMDwAAQBAJ|title=Collaborative Society|author2=Aleksandra Przegalinska|date=18 February 2020|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-35645-9}}</ref>{{Rp|74}}

Early in the Internet's history, memes were primarily spread via [[email]] or [[Usenet]] discussion communities. [[Internet forum|Messageboards]] and [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroups]] were also popular because they allowed a simple method for people to share information or memes with a diverse population of Internet users in a short period. They encourage communication between people, and thus between meme sets, that do not normally come in contact. Furthermore, they actively promote meme-sharing within the messageboard or newsgroup population by asking for feedback, comments, opinions, etc. This format is what gave rise to early Internet memes, like the [[Hampster Dance]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grunge.com/184711/the-oldest-memes-on-the-internet/|title=The oldest memes on the internet|last=Cantrell|first=Asher|date=2020-01-22|website=Grunge.com|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> Another factor in the increased meme transmission observed over the Internet is its interactive nature. [[Publishing|Print]] matter, [[radio]], and [[television]] are all essentially passive experiences requiring the reader, listener, or viewer to perform all necessary cognitive processing; in contrast, the social nature of the Internet allows phenomena to propagate more readily. Many phenomena are also spread via [[web search engine]]s, [[Internet forum]]s, [[social networking service]]s, [[Social news website|social news]] sites, and [[video hosting service]]s. Much of the Internet's ability to spread information is assisted from results found through search engines, which can allow users to find memes even with obscure information.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Memes On the Internet |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/ce7.shtml |publisher=[[Oracle Thinkquest]] |access-date=November 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511193449/http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/ce7.shtml |archivedate=May 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Marshall |first=Garry |title=The Internet and Memetics |url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Conf/MemePap/Marshall.html |publisher=School of Computing Science, [[Middlesex University]]|access-date=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119134239/http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Conf/MemePap/Marshall.html|archive-date=January 19, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The earlier forms of image based memes include the demotivator, image macro, [[Photo manipulation|photoshopped]] image, LOLCats, advice animal, and comic.<ref name=":0222">{{Cite book|last=Denisova |first=Anastasia|title=Internet Memes and Society: Social, Cultural, and Political Contexts|isbn=978-0-429-46940-4|location=New York, NY|oclc=1090540034}}</ref> The Demotivator image includes a black background with white, capitalized text, often in [[Times New Roman]]. The objective of using this format was to parodize inspirational and motivational posters, where the name "demotivator" is derived from.<ref name=":0222"/> Image macro consists of an image with white Impact font within a black border. The text/context of the meme is at the top and bottom of the image itself.<ref name=":0222"/> The photoshopped image is closely related to the macro image, but often is created without the use of text, mostly edited with another image.<ref name=":0222"/> Advice animals contain a photoshopped image of an animal's head on top of a rainbow/color wheel background. It includes the image macro of the top and bottom text with Impact font.<ref name=":0222"/> LOLCats incorporate the design of image macro and advice animals, but instead of just the cat's head, it is the entire picture unedited with top and bottom text, often with the usage of Internet slang.<ref name=":0222" /> Comics follow a typical newspaper comic strip format; there are a variety of different ways to create one, as multiple images and texts can be used to create the overall meme.
[[Rage comic]]s such as [[Trollface]] were often used to create comic memes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Maker Of The Trollface Meme Is Counting His Money|url=https://kotaku.com/the-maker-of-the-trollface-meme-is-counting-his-money-1696228810|last=Klepek|first=Patrick|date=April 8, 2015|website=Kotaku|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221101337/https://kotaku.com/the-maker-of-the-trollface-meme-is-counting-his-money-1696228810|archive-date=February 21, 2020|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/technology/personaltech/rage-comics-turn-everyday-stress-into-laughs.html |date=May 9, 2012 |last=Boutin |first=Paul |title=Put Your Rage Into a Cartoon and Exit Laughing |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2020-11-07}}</ref>

=== Modern memes ===
[[File:WikiMeme Dank.jpg|thumb|An example of a dank meme on the subject of Wikipedia and its practice of article referencing.]]
Modern memes began to arise first in the form of "dank" memes, a sub-genre of memes usually involving meme formats in a different way to the image macros that were in large use before. The term "[[wiktionary:dank|dank]]", which means "a cold, damp place", was later adapted by [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] smokers to refer to high-quality marijuana, and then became an ironic term for a type of meme, also becoming synonymous for "[[wiktionary:cool|cool]]".<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Hoffman |first1=Ashley |title=Donald Trump Jr. Just Became a Dank Meme, Literally |url=http://time.com/5130384/donald-trump-jr-dankness-tweet/ |website=Time|access-date=May 19, 2018 |date=February 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501012644/http://time.com/5130384/donald-trump-jr-dankness-tweet/|archive-date=May 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> This term originally meant a meme that was significantly different from the norm but is now used mainly to differentiate these modern types of memes from other, older types such as image macros.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Dank memes can also refer to "exceptionally unique or odd" memes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/dank-meme/ |title=Dank Memes&nbsp;— What does dank meme mean? |website=[[Dictionary.com]]|access-date=November 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130071447/https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/dank-meme/|archive-date=November 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> They have been described as "Internet in-jokes" that are "so played out that they become funny again" or are "so nonsensical that they are hilarious".<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Griffin |first1=Annaliese |title=What does "dank" mean?

The formats are usually from popular television shows, movies, or video games and users then add humorous text and images over it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} The culture surrounding memes, especially dank memes, grew to the point of the creation of many subcultures surrounding them. For instance, a "meme market", satirizing on the kind of talks and stocks found normally on Wall Street, was created in September 2016. Originally started on [[Reddit]] as r/MemeEconomy, people would only jokingly "buy" or "sell" shares in a meme to indicate how popular a meme was thought to be. The market is seen as a way to show how people assign value to commonplace and otherwise valueless things such as memes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/10/14223264/meme-economy-reddit-stock-market |title=How a group of Redditors is creating a fake stock market to figure out the value of memes |last=Plaugic |first=Lizzie |date=January 10, 2017 |website=The Verge|access-date=December 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211010109/https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/10/14223264/meme-economy-reddit-stock-market|archive-date=December 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Example of modern internet meme.jpg|thumb|Modern Internet meme on the subject of Wikipedia and pages breaking when certain characters are removed. Internet memes sometimes represent everyday problems]]
One example of a dank meme is "''Who Killed Hannibal''", which is made of two frames from a 2013 episode of ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]''. The meme features the host Andre shooting his co-host Buress in the first frame and then lamenting that his co-host has been shot in the next, with Andre often depicted blaming someone else for the shot. This was then adapted to other situations, such as [[baby boomers]] blaming [[millennials]] for problems that they allegedly caused.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Mary von Aue |title=Meme About 'Who Killed Hannibal' Is Reddit's Current Obsession |website=Inverse|access-date=May 19, 2018 |date=April 19, 2018 |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/43903-who-killed-hannibal-reddit-meme|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519120857/https://www.inverse.com/article/43903-who-killed-hannibal-reddit-meme|archive-date=May 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{Anchor|Moth memes}}
Dank memes can also stem from interesting real-life images that get shared or remixed many times. So-called "moth" memes (often stylized with diacritics on the "o": "möth") came about after a Reddit user posted a close up picture of a [[moth]] that they had found outside their window onto the r/creepy [[subreddit]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/8ys873/close_up_of_moth_outside_my_window/ |title=Close up of moth outside my window |author=u/No_Reason27 |date=July 2018|access-date=November 30, 2018 |website=[[Reddit]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006145655/https://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/8ys873/close_up_of_moth_outside_my_window/|archive-date=October 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> This image of a moth became popular and began to be used in memes. According to Chris Grinter, a [[lepidopterist]] from the [[California Academy of Sciences]], moth memes gained recognition because of the inexplicably surrounding moth's attraction to lamps.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/the-latest-viral-meme-trend-is-possibly-not-as-stupid-as-you-think/ |website=IFL Science |access-date=November 30, 2018 |title=The Latest Viral Meme Trend Is (Possibly) Not As Stupid As You Think |first=Katie |last=Spalding |date=October 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002222940/https://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/the-latest-viral-meme-trend-is-possibly-not-as-stupid-as-you-think/ |archive-date=October 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Deepfyed meme "W".jpg|thumb|Example of a deepfried meme without any context. Surrealist and nonsensical themes are typical of modern memes]]
{{Anchor|They did surgery on a grape}}
Many modern memes stem from nonsense or otherwise unrelated phrases that are repeated and placed onto other formats. One example of this is "they did surgery on a grape," from a video of a [[da Vinci Surgical System]] performing test surgery on a grape.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNHgeykDXFw |title=da Vinci Surgical System: Surgery on a grape |last=EdwardHospital |date=August 11, 2010|access-date=November 30, 2018 |via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127050657/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNHgeykDXFw|archive-date=November 27, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> People sharing the post tended to add the same caption to it ("they did surgery on a grape"), and eventually created a satirical image with several layers of captions on it. Memes such as this one continue to propagate as people start to include the phrase in different, otherwise unrelated memes.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Feldman |first1=Brian |title=They Did Surgery on a Grape |url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/why-is-everyone-saying-they-did-surgery-on-a-grape.html |work=Intelligencer |publisher=NYMag |date=November 26, 2018|access-date=November 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126201420/http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/why-is-everyone-saying-they-did-surgery-on-a-grape.html |archive-date=November 26, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Hess |first1=Peter |title="They Did Surgery on a Grape" Meme Began With Legally Suspect Medical Tool |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/51209-they-did-surgery-on-a-grape-but-is-the-grape-okay |website=Inverse |date=November 27, 2018|access-date=November 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127110402/https://www.inverse.com/article/51209-they-did-surgery-on-a-grape-but-is-the-grape-okay |archive-date=November 27, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Santiago |first=Amanda Luz Henning |title='They did surgery on a grape' is the weird meme that's your new obsession |url=https://mashable.com/article/they-did-surgery-on-a-grape-meme/ |website=Mashable |date=November 26, 2018|access-date=November 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126200029/https://mashable.com/article/they-did-surgery-on-a-grape-meme/ |archive-date=November 26, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The increasing trend towards irony in meme culture has resulted in absurdist memes, not unlike [[postmodern art]]. Many Internet memes have several layers of meaning built off of other memes, not being understandable unless the viewer has seen all previous memes. "Deep-fried" memes, memes that have been distorted and run through several filters, are often counter-culture and strange to one not familiar with them.<ref>{{cite web|website=Know Your Meme |url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deep-fried-memes |title=Deep-fried memes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327091650/https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deep-fried-memes |archive-date=March 27, 2019|accessdate=March 26, 2019}}</ref> An example of these memes is the "E" meme, a picture of [[Markiplier]] photoshopped onto [[Lord Farquaad]] from the film ''[[Shrek]]'', photoshopped into a scene from [[Mark Zuckerberg]]'s hearing in Congress.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hathaway|first=Jay |website=The Daily Dot |date=November 5, 2018 |url=https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/lord-farquaad-e-meme/ |title=The 'E' meme shows just how weird memes can get|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326134655/https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/lord-farquaad-e-meme/ |archive-date=March 26, 2019|accessdate=March 26, 2019}}</ref> "Surreal" memes are based on the idea of increasing layers of irony so that they are not understandable by popular culture or corporations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bryan|first=Chloe |website=Mashable |date=February 6, 2019 |url=https://mashable.com/article/surreal-memes/#dBMHaD8Josqt |title=Surreal memes deserve their own internet dimension |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327090359/https://mashable.com/article/surreal-memes/#dBMHaD8Josqt |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |accessdate=March 26, 2019}}</ref> This strange irony was discussed in the ''Washington Post'' article "Why is millennial humor so weird?" to show the disconnect from how millennials and other generations conceive of humor;<ref>{{cite news|last=Bruenig|first=Elizabeth |work=The Washington Post |date=August 11, 2017 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/why-is-millennial-humor-so-weird/2017/08/11/64af9cae-7dd5-11e7-83c7-5bd5460f0d7e_story.html |title=Why is millennial humor so weird? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507081349/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/why-is-millennial-humor-so-weird/2017/08/11/64af9cae-7dd5-11e7-83c7-5bd5460f0d7e_story.html |archive-date=May 7, 2019|accessdate=March 26, 2019}}</ref> the article itself also became a meme where people photoshopped examples of deep-fried and surreal memes onto the article to make fun of the point of the article and the abstraction of meme culture.<ref>{{cite web|website=Know Your Meme |url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/why-is-millennial-humor-so-weird |title=Why Is Millennial Humor So Weird? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326134706/https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/why-is-millennial-humor-so-weird |archive-date=March 26, 2019|accessdate=March 26, 2019}}</ref>

====Short-form video ====
{{See also|Vine (service)}}
After the success of the application Vine, a format of memes emerged in the form of short videos and scripted sketches.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dry|first=Jude |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2016/10/vine-dead-twitter-snapchat-video-legacy-1201740985/ |title=Vine Is Gone, But Not Forgotten: Why Twitter's Defunct Platform Was an Incubator for Digital Creatives |website=IndieWire|date=October 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112182428/https://www.indiewire.com/2016/10/vine-dead-twitter-snapchat-video-legacy-1201740985/ |archive-date=November 12, 2019|accessdate=September 19, 2019}}</ref> Vine, in spite of its closure in early 2017, has still retained relevance through uploads of viral vines in compilations onto other sharing social media sites such as [[Twitter]] and [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Glum|first=Julia |url=http://money.com/money/longform/vine-compilations-youtube-collab-payouts/ |title=Millions Are Obsessed With Vine Compilations on YouTube.

{{See also|Reaction video}}

The short-form videos created on sites like Vine and TikTok found use in being posted on other social media sites, such as Twitter, as a form of reacting and responding to other posts. These videos become replicated into other contexts and often become part of [[Internet culture]]. An example of a TikTok meme is the cosplay by Nyannyancosplay juxtaposed to the musical track "[[Mia Khalifa (song)|Mia Khalifa]]" by iLoveFriday. This meme became known as Hit or Miss.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/nyannyancosplay-hit-or-miss|title=Nyannyancosplay / Hit or Miss|website=Know Your Meme|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref> Hit or Miss has been referenced multiple times, including [[PewDiePie]]'s 2018 Rewind as one of the most influential memes of the year alongside numerous other influential memes of the year.<ref>{{cite AV media|author=PewDiePie |date=December 27, 2018 |via=YouTube|title=YouTube Rewind 2018, but it's actually good|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By_Cn5ixYLg|access-date=2020-05-02}}</ref> PewDiePie's 2018 rewind video has been viewed over 70 million times and has 8.9 million likes as of April 28, 2020. Hit or Miss has been remixed as well, including by other social media influencers such as [[Belle Delphine]]. SirKibbs' YouTube has uploaded a video of Belle Delphine and Kat (Nyannyancosplay) side-by-side comparison and has garnered 2.7 million views as of April 28, 2020.<ref>{{cite AV media|author=SirKibbs|date=November 19, 2018|via=YouTube |title=Hit or miss - Belle Delphine vs Kat|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tXmsxvCOGc|access-date=2020-05-02}}</ref>

==Marketing==
Public relations, advertising, and marketing professionals have embraced Internet memes as a form of [[viral marketing]] and [[guerrilla marketing]] to create marketing "[[Marketing buzz|buzz]]" for their product or service. The practice of using memes to market products or services is known as [[Memetics|memetic]] marketing.<ref name="memetic marketing">{{Cite news |first=Nick |last=Flor |title=Memetic Marketing |publisher=InformIT |date=December 11, 2000 |access-date=July 29, 2011 |url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=19996 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114180653/http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=19996 |archive-date=January 14, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Internet memes are seen as cost-effective, and because they are a (sometimes self-conscious) [[fad]], they are therefore used as a way to create an image of awareness or trendiness. To this end, businesses have taken to attempting two methods of using memes to increase publicity and sales of their company; either creating a meme or attempting to adapt or perpetuate an existing one.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2017/05/08/meme-marketing-how-brands-are-speaking-a-new-consumer-language/ |title=Meme Marketing: How Brands Are Speaking A New Consumer Language |last=McCrae|first=James |website=Forbes |date=May 8, 2017|access-date=December 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315134855/https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2017/05/08/meme-marketing-how-brands-are-speaking-a-new-consumer-language/|archive-date=March 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Examples of memetic marketing include the [[FreeCreditReport.com]] singing ad campaign,<ref>{{Cite news |last=McAlone |first=Nathan |url=http://pigeonsandplanes.com/in-depth/2014/03/freecreditreport-com-band |title=We Found The FreeCreditReport.Com Band, and They Aren't Who You Thought They Were |work=PigeonsandPlanes|date=March 4, 2014|access-date=April 19, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419201842/http://pigeonsandplanes.com/in-depth/2014/03/freecreditreport-com-band|archive-date=April 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> the "Nope, Chuck Testa" meme from an advertisement for taxidermist [[Chuck Testa]], [[Wilford Brimley]] saying "Diabeetus" from [[Liberty Medical]]{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} and the [[Dumb Ways to Die]] public announcement ad campaign by [[Metro Trains Melbourne]].

Marketers, for example, use Internet memes to create interest in films that would otherwise not generate positive publicity among critics. The 2006 film ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' generated much publicity via this method.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/29/business/worldbusiness/29iht-carr.1839216.html |work=The New York Times |first=David |last=Carr |title=Hollywood bypassing critics and print as digital gets hotter |date=May 29, 2006 |access-date=October 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703071008/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/29/business/worldbusiness/29iht-carr.1839216.html |archive-date=July 3, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Used in the context of public relations, the term would be more of an advertising [[buzzword]] than a proper Internet meme, although there is still an implication that the interest in the content is for purposes of trivia, ephemera, or frivolity rather than straightforward advertising and news.

Brands' use of memes has disadvantages when considering people's perception of a brand. While effective use of a meme can lead to increased sales and attention, seeming forced, unoriginal, or unfunny can negatively impact the brand as a whole. For instance, the fast food company [[Wendy's]] began a social media approach in 2017 that heavily featured memes and was initially met with success, resulting in an almost 50% profit growth that year;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kao |first1=Griffin |last2=Perusse |first2=Michael |last3=Sheng |first3=Weizhen |last4=Hong |first4=Jessica |date=February 2020 |title=Turning Silicon into Gold |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339544830 |location=Research Gate |publisher=Apress |pages=99–107 |isbn=978-1484256299}}</ref> however, the strategy has also resulted in backfire when sharing memes that are controversial or otherwise negatively perceived by consumers.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Whitten |title=A Wendy's tweet just went viral for all the wrong reasons |publisher=CNBC |date=January 4, 2017 |access-date=August 19, 2020 |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/04/wendys-saucy-tweets-are-hit-and-miss-on-social-media.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://stuntandgimmicks.com/2018/03/09/memes-politics-and-snarky-web-content-marketing-when-brands-break-bad/ |title=Memes, Politics, and Snarky Web Content Marketing: When #Brands Break #Bad |last=Mouravskiy |first=Alex |website=Stunt and Gimmicks |date=March 9, 2018 |access-date=August 19, 2020}}</ref>

== By context ==

=== Politics ===
As internet memes become a common means of online expression, they become quickly used by those seeking to express political opinions or to actively campaign for (or against) a political entity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Seiffert-Brockmann|first1=Jens|last2=Diehl|first2=Trevor|last3=Dobusch|first3=Leonhard|date=August 2018|title=Memes as games: The evolution of a digital discourse online|journal=New Media & Society|volume=20|issue=8|pages=2862–2879|doi=10.1177/1461444817735334|issn=1461-4448|s2cid=206729243}}</ref>

====Elections====
Early examples of which can be seen from the Internet memes resulting from the [[Dean Scream]]. Another example can be seen from MyDavidCameron.com, a website that allowed users to change the text of a [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative]] election campaign poster featuring [[David Cameron]] from the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election.]] This website often used to produce memes that replaced the original slogan with a series of exaggerated claims or sarcastic fake campaign promises along with derision of David Cameron's airbrushed appearance.

Within each subsequent election, and the growing importance of visual communications due to the Internet and social media, memes have become a more important element within political campaigns as fringe communities have shaped broader discourse through the use of Internet memes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MacLeod|first=Alan|date=2018-10-12|title=Book review: Kill all normies: Online culture wars from 4chan and Tumblr to Trump and the alt-right|journal=New Media & Society|volume=21|issue=2|pages=535–537|doi=10.1177/1461444818804143|issn=1461-4448|s2cid=67774146}}</ref> For example, [[Ted Cruz]]'s 2016 Republican presidential bid was damaged by Internet memes that speculated he was the [[Zodiac Killer]].<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Stuart|first1=Tessa|last2=Stuart|first2=Tessa|date=2016-02-26|title=Is Ted Cruz the Zodiac Killer?

Another internet meme was created from the 2012 US presidential debate surrounding United States politician [[Mitt Romney]]'s usage of the phrase "[[binders full of women]]". Internet meme creators quickly created "My Binders Full of Women Exploded", referencing the Korean pop song "[[Gangnam Style in popular culture|Gangnam style]]" by overlaying the politician's quote onto a frame from [[Psy]]'s music video where paper blows around him. This internet meme specifically indexes the central attribute of intertextuality by blending together pop culture with politics.<ref name=":032"/>

However, there has further been academic research that provides evidence that the use of memes during elections has a role to play in informing the public. In a study of 378 Internet memes posted across Facebook during the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], McLoughlin and Southern found memes were a widely shared conduit for basic political information to audiences who often did not seek it out.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=McLoughlin|first1=Liam|last2=Southern|first2=Rosalynd|date=2020-07-14|title=By any memes necessary?

This increasing importance of memes has been explicitly taken advantage of by some political campaigns; as part of the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 US presidential campaign]], [[Michael Bloomberg]] sponsored a number of Instagram accounts with over 60 million collective followers to post memes related to the Bloomberg campaign.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lorenz|first=Taylor|date=February 13, 2020|title=Michael Bloomberg's Campaign Suddenly Drops Memes Everywhere|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/michael-bloomberg-memes-jerry-media.html|access-date=July 30, 2020}}</ref> Similar to criticisms against corporations who use meme marketing, the campaign was faulted for treating meme culture as an advertisement or something that can be bought.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Tiffany|first=Kaitlyn|date=February 28, 2020|title=You Can't Buy Memes|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/02/bloomberg-memes-instagram-ads/607219/|access-date=July 30, 2020|work=The Atlantic}}</ref>

The 2020 Presidential Campaign of [[Kanye West]] quickly became a meme, following its announcement on [[Twitter]], with numerous celebrities and influencers endorsing the rapper out of [[irony]]. Other personalities began announcing their own satirical presidential campaigns, parodying West.

The [[Occupy Wall Street|Occupy Wall Street (OWS)]] protest movement saw a rise in internet memes after gaining attention on social media. All internet memes that were created and shared during the movement were very important in mediated discussions surrounding the OWS. Typical phrases such as "[[We are the 99%|We Are the 99]]%" and "This is what democracy looks like", were remixed into memes and subsequently posted in the discussion board of OWS on popular social media sites such as [[Reddit]], Tumblr, and [[4chan|4Chan]].

The text reads "open access memes for copyright-compliant libreens". In smaller text below is written the public domain attribution "Georg Reimer [public domain], via wikimedia commons. CC0."|thumb|Most memes are illegal to share in countries with [[fair dealing]] laws.]]
The eligibility of any memes to get copyright protection depends on the copyright law of the country in which such protection is sought. Some of the most popular formats of memes include cinematographic stills, personal or stock photographs, [[rage comics]], and illustrations meant to be a meme,<ref name="auto1">{{Cite journal |last1=S Iyer |first1=Aishwaria |last2=Mehrotra |first2=Raghav |title=A Critical Analysis of Memes and Fair Use |url=http://dspace.jgu.edu.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10739/1443/1/A%20Critcal%20analysis%20of%20meme.pdf |journal=Rostrum Law Review}}</ref> and the copyright implications differ for each of these different formats. In a cinematographic still, part of the entire end product is taken out of context and presented solely for its face value. The still is generally accompanied by a superimposed text of which conveys a distinctive idea or comment, such as the [[Boromir]] meme<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/one-does-not-simply-walk-into-mordor |title=One Does Not Simply Walk into Mordor |website=Know Your Meme|access-date=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425064033/https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/one-does-not-simply-walk-into-mordor|archive-date=April 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> or "Gru's Plan".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/grus-plan |title=Gru's Plan |website=Know Your Meme|access-date=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419192012/https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/grus-plan|archive-date=April 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Other memes are created based on online phenomena or individually-created content. Photographs of people or animals, especially stock photos, can be turned into memes by superimposing text, often to depict an emotion such as in the Distracted Boyfriend and [[Overly Attached Girlfriend]] memes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/distracted-boyfriend |title=Distracted Boyfriend |website=Know Your Meme|access-date=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419195640/https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/distracted-boyfriend|archive-date=April 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Rage comics]] are a subcategory of memes which depict a series of human emotions and conclude with a satirical punchline.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ragecomics |title=Rage Comics |website=Know Your Meme|access-date=April 20, 2019}}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The sources for these memes often come from [[webcomic]]s. Other memes are purely viral sensations such as in [[Keyboard Cat]] and Bongo Cat.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bongo-cat |title=Bongo Cat |website=Know Your Meme|access-date=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425064154/https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bongo-cat|archive-date=April 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

If it is found that the meme has made use of a copyrighted work, such as the movie still or photograph without due permission from the original owner, it would amount to [[copyright infringement]]. Rage comics and memes created for the sole purpose of becoming memes would normally be original works of the creator and therefore, the question of infringing other copyright work does not arise.<ref name="lawandarts.org">{{Cite journal |last1=Offsay |first1=Max |title="What Do You Meme?": A Fair Use Analysis |url=https://lawandarts.org/2018/04/02/critical-corner-what-do-you-meme-a-fair-use-analysis/ |journal=Columbia Journal of Law and Arts|access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422040922/https://lawandarts.org/2018/04/02/critical-corner-what-do-you-meme-a-fair-use-analysis/|archive-date=April 22, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> This does not mean that all memes made from movie still or photographs are infringing copyright. There are defenses available for such use in various jurisdictions which could exempt the meme from attracting liability for the infringement.

=== United States ===
{{Main|Copyright#Obtaining protection}}
Under United States copyright law, a creation receives copyright protection if it satisfies four conditions under 17 U.S.C. § 102.<ref name="17USCode§102">{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102 |title=17 U.S. Code § 102.

#It falls under one of the categories of work which is protected under the law
#It is an "expression"
#It has a modest amount of creativity
#It is "fixed".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mondaq.com/india/x/668356/Copyright/MEMES+AND+COPYRIGHT+FAIR+USE+OR+INFRINGEMENT |title=Memes and Copyright: Fair Use or Infringement? |last=Rout |first=Shrabani |website=Mondaq|date=January 30, 2018|access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424230716/http://www.mondaq.com/india/x/668356/Copyright/MEMES+AND+COPYRIGHT+FAIR+USE+OR+INFRINGEMENT|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Memes can be considered pictorial, graphical or motion picture, and so are subject to copyright law<ref name="17USCode§102" /> As such, memes are protected under copyright under the same conditions as these mediums, including concepts such as the low [[threshold of originality]] for what constitutes creativity (as demonstrated by [[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.|Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co]]).<ref>{{ussc|name=Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.|link=|volume=499|page=340|pin=|year=1991}}.</ref> Since a meme is essentially a comment, satire, ridicule or expression of an emotion it constitutes the expression of an idea. Memes are contained in the medium of the Internet and so are fixed expressions by 17 U.S.C. § 101.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101 |title=17 U.S. Code § 101.

==== Fair use ====
{{Main|Fair use}}

[[Fair use]] is a defense under US Copyright Law which protects work that has made using other copyrighted works.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107 |title=17 U.S. Code § 107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use|access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507195714/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107|archive-date=May 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The section provides that if a copyrighted work is reproduced "for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching [...], scholarship or research", it would not amount to infringement. Notably, for memes, the use of the term ''"such as"'' in the section denotes that the list is not exhaustive but merely illustrative. Furthermore, the factors mentioned in the section are subjective in nature and the weight of each factor varies on a case to case basis.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last1=Patel |first1=Ronak |title=First World Problems:' A Fair Use Analysis of Internet Memes |url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt96h003jt/qt96h003jt.pdf?t=nndf5x&v=lg |journal=UCLA Entertainment Law Review |volume=20 |issue=2}}</ref> All the factors have to be weighed together and an overall assessment is made whether the infringing work would qualify as fair use.

The four factors are:
#The purpose or character of use,
#The nature of the copyrighted work,
#The amount and substantiality of the portion used, and
#Effect on the market.

The purpose and character of the use involve how the original copyrighted work's purpose differs from the meme's purpose, as well as commercial uses of products that use copyrighted material. Many memes are [[Transformation (law)|transformative]] in nature as they have no relation to the original work and the motive behind the communication of the meme is personal, in terms of disseminating humor to the public. Such memes being transformative would be covered by fair use.<ref name=":2" /> However, copying memes that are made for the sole purpose of being memes would not enjoy this protection as there is no transformation{{em dash}}the copying has the same purpose as the original meme which is to communicate humorous or entertaining anecdotes.<ref name="barandbench.com">{{Cite web |url=https://barandbench.com/viewpoint-memes-copyright-got |title=The Viewpoint – Game of Thrones Memes: Potential Copyright Infringement or Fair Use? |last1=Mishra |first1=Meghna |last2=Nigam |first2=Anusuya |website=Bar and Bench|date=September 25, 2017|access-date=April 20, 2019}}</ref>

Purpose and character of use weigh in against memes which have been used for commercial purposes because then the work has not been created for the communication of humor but for economic gain. For example, [[Grumpy Cat]] won $710,001 in a copyright lawsuit against the beverage company Grenade which used the Grumpy Cat image on its roasted coffee line and t-shirts.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thewrap.com/grumpy-cat-wins-710001-in-copyright-lawsuit-memes-have-rights-too/ |title=Grumpy Cat Wins $710,001 in Copyright Lawsuit: 'Memes Have Rights Too' |last1=Nakamura |first1=Reid |publisher=The Wrap|access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422040921/https://www.thewrap.com/grumpy-cat-wins-710001-in-copyright-lawsuit-memes-have-rights-too/|archive-date=April 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The nature of the copyrighted work asks what the differences between the meme and the other material are. This factor applies to many types of memes because the original work is an artistic creation that has been published and thus the latter enjoys protection under copyright which the memes are violating. However, as memes are transformative, this factor does not have a lot of weight.<ref name="lawandarts.org"/>

The amount and substantiality of the portion used tests not only the quantity of the work copied but the quality that is copied as well.<ref name="SCOTUS">{{Ussc|name=Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises|471|539|1985}}. {{Usgovpd}}</ref> [[Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises]] clarified this position. For cinematography, only a small portion of the entire film is copied whereas for rage comics and personal photographs, the entire portion has been used to create the meme. Despite this, all categories of memes would be considered to be falling under fair use because the text that is added to those images adds value, without which it would just be pictures.<ref name=":2" /> Moreover, the heart of the work is not affected because the still/picture is taken out of context and portrays something entirely different from what the image originally wanted to depict.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=M. Lantagne |first1=Stacey |title=Famous on The Internet: The Spectrum of Internet Memes and The Legal Challenge of Evolving Methods of Communication |url=https://lawreview.richmond.edu/files/2018/01/Lantagne-522.pdf |journal=University of Richmond Law Review|access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127185203/https://lawreview.richmond.edu/files/2018/01/Lantagne-522.pdf|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Lastly, the effect on the market offers court analysis on whether the meme would cause harm to the actual market of the original copyright work and also the harm it could cause to the potential market.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/15-3885/15-3885-2018-02-27.html |title=Fox News Network, LLC v.

Warner Brothers was sued for infringing the [[Nyan Cat]] meme by using it its game Scribblenauts.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2013/05/03/warner-brothers-sued-for-infringing-cat-meme-copyright/#24bc370d2e34 |title=Warner Brothers Sued For Infringing Cat Meme Copyright |last=Woollacott |first=Emma |work=Forbes|date=May 3, 2013|access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422040933/https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2013/05/03/warner-brothers-sued-for-infringing-cat-meme-copyright/#24bc370d2e34|archive-date=April 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== India ===
Under Section 2(c)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/121334999/ |title=Section 2(c) in the Copyright Act, 1957 |access-date=May 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420163506/https://indiankanoon.org/doc/121334999/ |archive-date=April 20, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957, a meme could be classified as an 'artistic work' which states that an artistic work includes painting, sculpture, drawing (including a diagram, map, chart or plan), an engraving or a photograph, whether or not any such work possesses artistic quality.<ref name=":0" /> The section uses the phrase ''"whether or not possessing artistic quality"'', the memes that are rage comics or those such as [[Keyboard Cat]] would enjoy protection as they are original creations in the form a painting, drawing, photograph or short video clip, despite not having artistic quality.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url=https://spicyip.com/2013/12/guest-post-keep-calm-and-share-copyright-not-being-infringed.html |title=Keep Calm and Share – Copyright Not Being Infringed |last=Barooah |first= Swaraj Paul |website=SpicyIP|date=December 13, 2013 |access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216115115/https://spicyip.com/2013/12/guest-post-keep-calm-and-share-copyright-not-being-infringed.html|archive-date=December 16, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Memes that made from cinematograph still or photographs, the original image in the background for the meme would also be protected as the picture or the still from the series/movie is an 'artistic work'.<ref name="auto1"/> These memes are a modification of that already existing artistic work with some little amount of creativity and therefore, they would also enjoy copyright protection.

==== Fair dealing ====
{{Main|Fair dealing}}

Any distribution of a work which has a copyright, wholly or partly, would constitute an infringing copy under Section 2(m)(i)<ref name="auto">{{Cite journal|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/1367|title=Copyright Act, 1957|date=June 4, 1957|via=indiacode.nic.in}}</ref> of the Copyright Act, 1957. India follows a fair dealing approach as an exception to copyright infringement under Section 52(1)(a)<ref name="auto"/> for the purposes of private or personal use, criticism or review. The analysis requires three steps: the amount and substantiality of dealing, the purpose of copying, and the effect on potential markets.

The amount of sustainability of dealing asks about how much of the original work is used in the meme, or how the meme transforms the original content. A meme makes use to existing copyright work whether it is a cinematograph still, rage comic, personal photograph or a meme made for the purpose of being a meme. However, since a meme is made for comedic purposes, taken out of context of the original work, they are transforming the work and creating a new work.<ref name=":0" />

The purpose of copying factors in the purpose of the meme compared to the purpose of the original work. Under Section 52(1)(a)<ref name="auto"/> the purpose is restricted to criticism or review. A meme, as long as it is a parody or a criticism of the original work would be protected under the exception but once an element of commercialization comes in, they would no longer be exempted and because the purpose no longer falls under the those mentioned in the section .<ref name=":1" /> When the Indian comedic group, [[All India Bakchod]] (AIB) parodied [[Game of Thrones]] through a series of memes, the primary purpose was to advertise products of companies that have endorsed the group and it would not be fair dealing.<ref name="barandbench.com"/>

Memes generally do not have an effect on the potential market for a work. There must be no intention on part of the infringer to compete with the original owner of the work and derive profits from it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1685540/ |title=Blackwood & Sons Ltd. v. A.N. Parasuraman [AIR 1959 Mad. 410]|access-date=May 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422040923/https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1685540/|archive-date=April 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Since memes are generally meant for comedic value and have no intention to supplant the market of the original creator, they would be squarely fall within the ambit of this section.<ref name=":1"/><!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->
