The [[European Union]] (EU) consists of 27 member states. Each member state is party to the [[Treaties of the European Union|founding treaties]] of the union and thereby shares in the privileges and obligations of membership. Unlike members of other [[international organisation]]s, the member states of the EU have agreed by treaty to shared sovereignty through the [[institutions of the European Union]] in some (but by no means all) aspects of government. Member states must agree unanimously for the EU to adopt some policies; for others, collective decision making is by [[qualified majority voting]]. [[Subsidiarity]], meaning that decisions are taken collectively if and only if they cannot realistically be taken individually, is a founding principle of the EU.

In the 1950s, [[Inner Six|six core states]] founded the EU's predecessor [[European Communities]] ([[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[West Germany]]). The remaining states have acceded in subsequent [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargements]]. To accede, a state must fulfill the economic and political requirements known as the [[Copenhagen criteria]], which require a candidate to have a democratic, [[free-market]] government together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions, and respect for the [[rule of law]]. Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate's adoption of the existing body of EU law, known as the [[acquis communautaire]].

Until 2020, no member state had ever withdrawn or been suspended from the EU, though some dependent territories or semi-autonomous areas had previously left. The [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|UK government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union]] on 29 March 2017 to formally initiate the [[Brexit]] process. Completion occurred on 31 January 2020 (at 23:00 [[UTC+00:00|London time]]),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/world/europe/brexit-britain-eu.html|title=Brexit Day Live Updates: U.K.’s Final Hours in the E.U.|last=Times|first=The New York|date=2020-01-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-31|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=31 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131205621/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/world/europe/brexit-britain-eu.html|url-status=live}}</ref> with all other arrangements remaining in place during a transition period while a [[free trade agreement]] is negotiated.

===Outermost regions===
{{further|Special member state territories and the European Union}}
There are a number of overseas member state territories which are legally part of the EU, but have certain exemptions based on their remoteness. These "outermost regions" have partial application of EU law and in some cases are outside of Schengen or the EU VAT area—however they are legally within the EU.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/activity/outermost/index_en.cfm Regional policy & outermost regions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916102029/http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/activity/outermost/index_en.cfm |date=16 September 2011 }}, European Commission</ref> They all use the [[euro]] as their currency.

==Changes in membership==
===Enlargement===
{{See also|Enlargement of the European Union|Future enlargement of the European Union|Brexit}}
[[File:EC-EU-enlargement animation.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|Member states of the European Union (dark blue) (1993-present). Pre-1993, the EU was known as the European Communities (sky blue). Animated in order of accession and secession.]]

According to the [[Copenhagen criteria]], membership of the European Union is open to any European country that is a stable, [[free market|free-market]] [[liberal democracy]] that respects the [[rule of law]] and human rights. Furthermore, it has to be willing to accept all the obligations of membership, such as adopting all previously agreed law (the 170,000 pages of [[acquis communautaire]]) and switching to the [[euro]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Accession criteria |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/enlargement_process/accession_process/criteria/index_en.htm |access-date=25 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209003613/http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/enlargement_process/accession_process/criteria/index_en.htm |archive-date=9 February 2008}}</ref> For a state to join the European Union, the prior approval of all current member states is required.  In addition to enlargement by adding new countries, the EU can also expand by having territories of member states, which are outside the EU, integrate more closely (for example in respect to the [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]]) or by a territory of a member state which had previously seceded and then rejoined (see withdrawal below).

===Suspension===
{{main|Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union}}
There is no provision to expel a member state, but [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title I: Common Provisions#Article 7|TEU Article 7]] provides for the suspension of certain rights. Introduced in the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], Article 7 outlines that if a member persistently breaches the EU's founding principles (liberty, democracy, human rights and so forth, outlined in [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title I: Common Provisions#Article 2|TEU Article 2]]) then the [[European Council]] can vote to suspend any rights of membership, such as voting and representation. Identifying the breach requires unanimity (excluding the state concerned), but sanctions require only a qualified majority.<ref name="suspend">[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/suspension_clause.html Suspension clause] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222220107/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/suspension_clause.html |date=22 December 2017 }}, Europa glossary. Retrieved 22 December 2017</ref>

The state in question would still be bound by the obligations treaties and the Council acting by majority may alter or lift such sanctions. The [[Treaty of Nice]] included a preventive mechanism whereby the Council, acting by majority, may identify a potential breach and make recommendations to the state to rectify it before action is taken against it as outlined above.<ref name="suspend"/> However, the treaties do not provide any mechanism to expel a member state outright.<ref name="expel">Athanassiou, Phoebus (December 2009) [http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp10.pdf Withdrawal and Expulsion from the EU and EMU, Some Reflections] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120184437/http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp10.pdf |date=20 January 2013 }} (PDF), European Central Bank. Retrieved 8 September 2011</ref>

===Withdrawal===
{{Main|Withdrawal from the European Union}}
The [[Lisbon Treaty]] made the first provision of a member state to leave. The procedure for a state to leave is outlined in [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title VI: Final Provisions#Article 50|TEU Article 50]] which also makes clear that "Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements". Although it calls for a negotiated withdrawal between the seceding state and the rest of the EU, if no agreement is reached two years after the seceding state notifying of its intention to leave, it would cease to be subject to the treaties anyway (thus ensuring a right to unilateral withdrawal).<ref name="expel"/> There is no formal limit to how much time a member state can take between adopting a policy of withdrawal, and actually triggering Article 50.

In a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|non-binding referendum in June 2016]]—the result of which the government promised to implement—the United Kingdom voted to withdraw from the EU. The UK government triggered Article 50 on 29 March 2017.<ref name=GuardianMay>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws|title=Theresa May to trigger article 50 by end of March 2017|last=Elgot|first=Jessica|work=The Guardian|date=2 October 2016|access-date=22 October 2016|archive-date=22 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022225706/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-to-propose-great-repeal-bill-to-unwind-eu-laws|url-status=live}}</ref>  After an extended period of negotiation and internal political debate the United Kingdom eventually withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020 concluding the first phase of the [[Brexit]] process. 

Prior to 2016, no member state had ever voted to withdraw. However, [[French Algeria]], [[Greenland]] and [[Saint-Barthélemy]] did cease being part of the EU (or its predecessor) in 1962, 1985, and 2012, respectively, due to status changes. The situation of Greenland being outside the EU while still subject to an EU member state had been discussed as a template for the pro-EU regions of the UK remaining within the EU or its single market.<ref>[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/07/07/reverse-greenland-arrangement/ Could a ‘reverse Greenland’ arrangement keep Scotland and Northern Ireland in the EU?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022222052/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/07/07/reverse-greenland-arrangement/ |date=22 October 2016 }}, London School of Economics 7 July 2016</ref>

Beyond the formal withdrawal of a member state, there are a number of independence movements such as [[Catalan independentism|Catalonia]] or [[Partition of Belgium|Flanders]]<!---THIS IS JUST MENTIONING TWO EXAMPLES FROM DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES, PLEASE DO NOT TURN IT INTO A LIST OF EVERY INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT IN EUROPE---> which could result in a similar situation to Greenland. Were a territory of a member state to secede but wish to remain in the EU, some scholars claim it would need to reapply to join as if it were a new country applying from scratch.<ref>Happold, Matthew (1999) [http://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2011/cerwp2-2807.pdf Scotland Europa: independence in Europe?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022085918/http://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2011/cerwp2-2807.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Centre for European Reform.

As of February 2020 the [[United Kingdom]] is the only former member state to formally undertake the process of withdrawing from the [[European Union]]. This began when the [[HM Government|UK Government]] [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|triggered Article 50]] to begin [[Brexit|the UK's withdrawal from the EU]] on 29 March 2017 following a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|June 2016 referendum]], and the withdrawal was scheduled in law to occur on 29 March 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/confirmation-of-uk-government-agreement-to-article-50-extension |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 April 2019 |archive-date=1 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401192151/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/confirmation-of-uk-government-agreement-to-article-50-extension |url-status=live }}</ref> Subsequently, the UK sought, and was granted, a number of Article 50 extensions until 31 January 2020. On 23 January 2020, the Withdrawal agreement was ratified by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], and on 29 January 2020 by the European Parliament.

==Representation==
[[File:Familiefoto europese raad 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A 2011 'family photo' of the [[European Council]], which comprises the [[head of state|heads of state]] or [[head of government|government]] of the member states, along with [[President of the European Council]] and the [[President of the European Commission]]]]
Each state has representation in the [[institutions of the European Union]]. Full membership gives the government of a member state a seat in the [[Council of the European Union]] and [[European Council]]. When decisions are not being taken by [[consensus]], [[qualified majority voting]] (which requires majorities both of the number of states and of the population they represent, but a sufficient [[Voting in the Council of the European Union|blocking minority]]  can veto the proposal). The [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] rotates among each of the member states, allowing each state six months to help direct the agenda of the EU.<ref>{{cite web

Similarly, each state is assigned [[Member of the European Parliament|seats in Parliament]] according to their population (smaller countries receiving more seats per inhabitant than the larger ones). The members of the [[European Parliament]] have been elected by [[universal suffrage]] since 1979 (before that, they were seconded from [[National parliaments of the European Union|national parliaments]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=The European Parliament: Historical Background|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/presidency-council-eu/|access-date=14 May 2016|archive-date=26 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326171859/http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/presidency-council-eu/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news

The national governments appoint one member each to the [[European Commission]], the [[European Court of Justice]] and the [[European Court of Auditors]]. Prospective Commissioners must be confirmed both by the President of the Commission and by the European Parliament; prospective justices must be confirmed by the existing members. Historically, larger member states were granted an extra Commissioner. However, as the body grew, this right has been removed and each state is represented equally. The six largest states are also granted an Advocates General in the Court of Justice. Finally, the Governing Council of the [[European Central Bank]] includes the governors of the national central banks (who may or may not be government appointed) of each [[eurozone|euro area]] country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/govc/html/index.en.html|title=Governing Council|website=European Central Bank|access-date=14 May 2016|archive-date=3 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203063704/https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/govc/html/index.en.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The larger states traditionally carry more weight in negotiations, however smaller states can be effective impartial mediators and citizens of smaller states are often appointed to sensitive top posts to avoid competition between the larger states. This, together with the disproportionate representation of the smaller states in terms of votes and seats in parliament, gives the smaller EU states a greater power of influence than is normally attributed to a state of their size. However most negotiations are still dominated by the larger states. This has traditionally been largely through the "[[France–Germany relations|Franco-German]] motor" but Franco-German influence has diminished slightly following the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|influx of new members in 2004]] (see [[G6 (EU)|G6]]).<ref>{{cite news|author=Peel, Q|date=26 March 2010|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d599e1a0-3912-11df-8970-00144feabdc0.html|title=Deal shows Merkel has staked out strong role]|work=[[Financial Times]]|display-authors=etal|access-date=15 June 2010|archive-date=4 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604231941/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d599e1a0-3912-11df-8970-00144feabdc0.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

While the member states are sovereign, the union partially follows a [[Supranational union|supranational]] system for those functions agreed by treaty to be shared. ("Competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the member states"). Previously limited to [[European Community]] matters, the practice, known as the '[[community method]]', is currently used in many areas of policy. ''Combined sovereignty'' is delegated by each member to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions. This practice is often referred to as 'pooling of sovereignty'. Those institutions are then empowered to make laws and execute them at a European level.

If a state fails to comply with the [[law of the European Union]], it may be fined or have funds withdrawn.

In contrast to other organisations, the EU's style of integration has "become a highly developed system for mutual interference in each other's domestic affairs".<ref>[[Robert Cooper (strategist)|Cooper, Robert]] (7 April 2002) [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldview/story/0,11581,680117,00.html Why we still need empires] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621231953/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldview/story/0,11581,680117,00.html |date=21 June 2011 }}, ''[[The Guardian]]'' (London)</ref> However, on defence and foreign policy issues (and, pre-[[Lisbon Treaty]], police and judicial matters) less sovereignty is transferred, with issues being dealt with by unanimity and co-operation.

The question of [[Supremacy (European Union law)|whether EU law is superior to national law]] is subject to some debate. The treaties do not give a judgement on the matter but court judgements have established EU's law superiority over national law and it is affirmed in a declaration attached to the Treaty of Lisbon (the [[European Constitution]] would have fully enshrined this). Some national legal systems also explicitly accept the Court of Justice's interpretation, such as France and Italy, however in Poland it does not override the [[Constitution of the Republic of Poland|national constitution]], which it does in Germany.{{Cn|reason=Which judiciary decisions?|date=August 2019}} The exact areas where the member states have given legislative competence to the EU are as follows.

===Competences===
{{see also|subsidiarity}}
In EU terminology, the term 'competence' means 'authority or responsibility to act'. The table below shows which aspects of governance are exclusively for collective action (through the Commission) and which are shared to a greater or lesser extent. If an aspect is not listed in the table below, then it remains the exclusive competence of the member state. Perhaps the best known example is taxation, which remains a matter of national sovereignty.

===Conditional mutual support===
As a result of the [[European sovereign debt crisis]], some [[eurozone]] states were given a [[bailout]] from their fellow members via the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] and [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (replaced by the [[European Stability Mechanism]] from 2013), but this came with conditions. As a result of the [[Greek government-debt crisis]], Greece accepted a large austerity plan including privatisations and a sell off of state assets in exchange for their bailout. To ensure that Greece complied with the conditions set by the [[European troika]] (ECB, IMF, Commission), a 'large-scale technical assistance' from the European Commission and other member states was deployed to Greek government ministries. Some, including the [[Euro Group#President|President of the Euro Group]] [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], stated that "the sovereignty of Greece will be massively limited."<ref>Kirschbaum, Erik (3 July 2011) {{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/03/us-greece-juncker-idUSTRE7620ZK20110703|title=Greek sovereignty to be massively limited: Juncker|agency=Reuters|access-date=1 July 2017|archive-date=1 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001133749/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/03/us-greece-juncker-idUSTRE7620ZK20110703|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Mahony, Honor (4 July 2011) [http://euobserver.com/9/32582 Greece faces 'massive' loss of sovereignty] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707103730/http://euobserver.com/9/32582/ |date=7 July 2011 }}, ''[[EUobserver]]''</ref><ref name="protectorate">[http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief-cover/755611-athens-becomes-eu-protectorate Athens becomes EU 'protectorate'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713200429/http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/news-brief-cover/755611-athens-becomes-eu-protectorate |date=13 July 2011 }} [[List of newspapers in Greece|To Ethnos]] via PressEurop 4 July 2011</ref> The situation of the bailed out countries (Greece, Portugal and Ireland) has been described as being a [[Ward (law)|ward]]<ref>Fitzgerald, Kyran (15 October 2011) [http://www.examiner.ie/business/business-features/reform-agendas-leading-light-170819.html Reform agenda’s leading light] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923135456/https://www.irishexaminer.com/ |date=23 September 2020 }}, [[Irish Examiner]]</ref><ref>Coy, Peter (13 January 2011) [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_04/b4212009727572.htm If Demography Is Destiny, Then India Has the Edge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806032801/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_04/b4212009727572.htm |date=6 August 2011 }}, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]</ref> or [[protectorate]]<ref name="protectorate"/><ref>Mahler ''et al'' (2 September 2010) [http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,676507,00.html How Brussels Is Trying to Prevent a Collapse of the Euro] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010112955/http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,676507,00.html |date=10 October 2011 }}, ''[[Der Spiegel]]''</ref><ref>[http://openeuropeblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/economic-protectorate.html The Economic Protectorate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108220006/http://openeuropeblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/economic-protectorate.html |date=8 November 2011 }}, [[Open Europe]] (4 February 2010)</ref> of the EU with some such as the [[Netherlands]] calling for a formalisation of the situation.<ref>{{cite web|first =Leigh|last =Phillips|date =7 September 2011|url =http://euobserver.com/19/113552|work =[[EU Observer]]|title =Netherlands: Indebted states must be made ‘wards’ of the commission or leave euro|access-date =17 October 2011|archive-date =25 October 2011|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20111025202309/http://euobserver.com/19/113552|url-status =live}}</ref>

==Multi-speed integration==
{{see also|Multi-speed Europe}}
EU integration is not always symmetrical, with some states proceeding with integration ahead of hold-outs. This comes in two forms; a faster integrated core where some states forge ahead with a new project, and opt-outs where a few states are excused from normal integration. The notion of multi-speed integration is anathema to some, including President Juncker, who see it as divisive to the European project and others, such as the less-integrated states, who feel they would be left behind. It is however supported by others, such as President Macron, to move forward in integration faster.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.politico.eu/article/juncker-to-oppose-multispeed-europe/|title = Juncker to oppose multispeed Europe|website = Politico|date = 13 September 2017|last = Eder|first = Florian|access-date = 29 December 2017|archive-date = 29 December 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171229232258/https://www.politico.eu/article/juncker-to-oppose-multispeed-europe/|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>[https://euobserver.com/institutional/138832 Macron revives multi-speed Europe idea] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229231647/https://euobserver.com/institutional/138832 |date=29 December 2017 }}, EUObserver 30 August 2017</ref>

===Enhanced cooperation===
{{main|Enhanced cooperation}}
There are several different forms closer integration both within and outside the EU's normal framework. The main mechanism is [[enhanced cooperation]] where nine or more states can use EU structures progress in a field that not all states are willing to partake in. One example of this is the [[European Public Prosecutor]].<ref>[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/10/12/eppo-20-ms-confirms/ 20 member states confirm the creation of a European Public Prosecutor's Office] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316161727/http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/10/12/eppo-20-ms-confirms/ |date=16 March 2018 }}, General Secretariat of the Council 12 October 2017</ref> A similar mechanism is [[Permanent Structured Cooperation]] in Defence, where the majority of EU states work in a flexible manner on defence cooperation. Other projects, such as the [[European Fiscal Compact]], operate between EU members but as a separate intergovernmental treaty outside of the official EU structures.<ref>[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/12/11/defence-cooperation-pesco-25-member-states-participating/ Defence cooperation: Council establishes Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), with 25 member states participating] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225075632/http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/12/11/defence-cooperation-pesco-25-member-states-participating/ |date=25 December 2017 }}, General Secretariat of the Council 11 December 2017</ref>

===Opt-outs===
{{main|Opt-outs in the European Union}}
A number of states are less integrated into the EU than others. In most cases this is because those states have gained an [[Opt-outs in the European Union|opt-out]] from a certain policy area. The most notable is the opt-out from the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]], the adoption of the [[euro]] as sole legal currency. Most states outside the [[Eurozone]] are obliged to adopt the euro when they are ready, but Denmark (and formerly the United Kingdom) has obtained the right to retain their [[Currencies of the European Union|own independent currency]].

Ireland does not participate in the [[Schengen Agreement]]. Denmark has an opt out from the [[Common Security and Defence Policy]]; Denmark and Ireland have an opt-out on police and justice matters and Poland has an opt out from the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]].<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/opting_out.html Opting out] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229232323/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/opting_out.html |date=29 December 2017 }}, Eur-lex</ref>

{{Politics of the European Union}}

Entry to the EU is limited to liberal democracies and [[Freedom House]] ranks all EU states as being totally free electoral democracies.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018 |title = Freedom in the World 2018: Democracy in Crisis |publisher = [[Freedom House]] |year = 2018 |access-date = 15 April 2018 |archive-date = 7 October 2019 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191007111055/https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018 |url-status = live }}</ref>  All but 4 are ranked at the top 1.0 rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world-2018-table-country-scores |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411130830/https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world-2018-table-country-scores|archive-date=11 April 2018 |title=Freedom in the World 2018: Table of Country Scores |publisher=[[Freedom House]] |year=2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, the exact political system of a state is not limited, with each state having its own system based on its historical evolution.

More than half of member states—15 out of 27—are [[parliamentary republic]]s, while six states are [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], meaning they have a monarch although political powers are exercised by elected politicians. Most republics and all the monarchies operate a [[parliamentary system]] whereby the head of state (president or monarch) has a largely ceremonial role with [[reserve power]]s. That means most power is in the hands of what is called in most of those countries the prime minister, who is accountable to the [[National parliaments of the European Union|national parliament]]. Of the remaining republics, five operate a [[semi-presidential system]], where competencies are shared between the president and prime minister, while one republic operates a [[presidential system]], where the president is head of state and government.

Parliamentary structure in member states varies: there are 15 [[unicameral]] national parliaments and 12 [[bicameral parliaments]]. The prime minister and government are usually directly accountable to the directly elected [[lower house]] and require its support to stay in office—the exceptions being Cyprus and France with their presidential systems. [[Upper house]]s are composed differently in different member states: it can be directly elected like the [[Senate of Poland|Polish senate]]; indirectly elected, for example, by regional legislatures like the [[Federal Council of Austria]]; or unelected, but representing certain interest groups like the [[National Council of Slovenia]]. All elections in member states use some form of [[proportional representation]]. The most common type of proportional representation is the [[Party-list proportional representation|party-list system]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}<!-- True but still needs to be cited  -->

There are also differences in the level of [[self-governance]] for the sub-regions of a member state. Most states, especially the smaller ones, are [[unitary state]]s; meaning all major political power is concentrated at the national level. 9 states allocate power to more local levels of government. Austria, Belgium and Germany are full federations, meaning their regions have constitutional autonomies. Denmark, Finland, France and the Netherlands are [[Federacy|federacies]], meaning some regions have autonomy but most do not. Spain and Italy have system of [[devolution]] where regions have autonomy, but the national government retains the right to revoke it. \<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=McGarry |first=John |editor1-last=Weller |editor1-first=Marc |editor2-last=Nobbs |editor2-first=Katherine|encyclopedia=Asymmetric Autonomy and the Settlement of Ethnic Conflicts |year=2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-8122-4230-0 |pages=148–179}}</ref>

States such as France have a number of [[Special Member State territories and the European Union|overseas territories]], retained from their [[Colonial empire|former empires]].

There are a number of countries with strong links with the EU, similar to elements of membership. Following Norway's decision not to join the EU, it remained one of the members of the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) via the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA), which also includes [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Switzerland]]. Switzerland rejected membership of the EEA. The EEA links these countries into the EU's market, extending the [[Internal market|four freedoms]] to these states. In return, they pay a membership fee and have to adopt most areas of [[Law of the European Union|EU law]] (which they do not have direct impact in shaping). The democratic repercussions of this have been described as "fax democracy" (waiting for new laws to be faxed in from [[Brussels and the European Union|Brussels]] rather than being involved in drafting them).<ref>{{cite web |last = Ekman |first = Ivar |date = 27 October 2007 |url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/26/news/norway.php |title = In Norway, EU pros and cons (the cons still win) |work = International Herald Tribune |access-date = 30 August 2008 |archive-date = 14 June 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614162428/http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/26/news/norway.php |url-status = live }}</ref>

A different example is [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which has been under international supervision. The [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is an international administrator who has wide-ranging powers over Bosnia and Herzegovina to ensure the peace agreement is respected. The High Representative is also the EU's representative, and is in practice appointed by the EU. In this role, and since a major ambition of Bosnia and Herzegovina is to join the EU, the country has become a ''de facto'' protectorate of the EU. The EU appointed representative has the power to impose legislation and dismiss elected officials and civil servants, meaning the EU has greater direct control over Bosnia and Herzegovina than its own states. Indeed, the [[Flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina|state's flag]] resembles the [[Flag of Europe|EU's flag]] according to some observers.<ref name="Balkan Insight 2017">{{cite web | title=Bosnia's 'Foreign' Flag Still Draws Mixed Feelings | website=Balkan Insight | date=2017-12-06 | url=https://balkaninsight.com/2017/12/06/bosnia-s-foreign-flag-still-draws-mixed-feelings-12-05-2017/ | access-date=2020-04-01 | archive-date=6 July 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200706120755/https://balkaninsight.com/2017/12/06/bosnia-s-foreign-flag-still-draws-mixed-feelings-12-05-2017/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

However the EU mission does enjoy certain executive powers over the state and has a responsibility to maintain stability and order.<ref>{{cite web |last = Kurti |first = Albin |date = 2 September 2009 |url = http://euobserver.com/9/28602 |title = Comment: Causing damage in Kosovo |work = EUobserver |access-date = 2 September 2009 |archive-date = 3 September 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090903142957/http://euobserver.com/9/28602 |url-status = live }}</ref> Like Bosnia, Kosovo has been termed an "EU protectorate".<ref>Judah, Tim (18 February 2008) [http://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/detail/article/kosovo-the-era-of-the-eu-protectorate-dawns/ Kosovo: the era of the EU protectorate dawns] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222025759/http://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/detail/article/kosovo-the-era-of-the-eu-protectorate-dawns/ |date=22 December 2011 }}, [[European Union Institute for Security Studies]]</ref><ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,536354,00.html 'Kosovo Is not Independent, It Is an EU Protectorate'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122061459/http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,536354,00.html |date=22 November 2011 }}, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' (19 February 2008)</ref><ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/10711623 Independence day] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120091030/http://www.economist.com/node/10711623 |date=20 January 2016 }}, ''[[The Economist]]'' (17 February 2008)</ref>

However, there is also the largely defunct term of ''associate member''. It has occasionally been applied to states that have signed an [[European Union Association Agreement|association agreement]] with the EU. Associate membership is not a formal classification and does not entitle the state to any of the representation of free movement rights that full membership allows. The term is almost unheard of in the modern context and was primarily used in the earlier days of the EU with countries such as Greece and Turkey. Turkey's association agreement was the 1963 [[Ankara Agreement]], implying that Turkey became an associate member that year.<ref>{{cite web|date=14 November 2005 |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/eu-turkey-relations/article-129678 |title=EUTurkey relations |publisher=EurActiv |access-date=4 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706153600/http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/eu-turkey-relations/article-129678 |archive-date=6 July 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date = 10 June 2008 |url = https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/turkeys-tigers/report-card-turkey-and-eu-membership/introduction/583/ |title = Turkey's Tigers, Report Card: Turkey and EU Membership?: Introduction |publisher = Public Broadcasting Service |access-date = 4 March 2010 |archive-date = 13 April 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100413121010/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/turkeys-tigers/report-card-turkey-and-eu-membership/introduction/583/ |url-status = live }}</ref> Present association agreements include the [[Stabilisation and Association Process|Stabilisation and Association Agreements]] with the western Balkans; these states are no longer termed "associate members".

The United Kingdom's future relationship and agreements with the rest of the European Union is yet to be officially decided, with a current deadline of 31 December 2020, the date for new post Brexit relations to be reached. For the rest of 2020 (following The UK's departure on 31 January 2020), the United Kingdom will remain in the EU Customs Union and single market; however, the British government have insisted that they do not wish to remain in either after 2020, and hope for a more distant future relationship.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/boris-johnson-brexit-deal-northern-ireland-trade/ |work=The Telegraph |title=What does Boris Johnson's Brexit deal mean for Northern Ireland and trade with the EU? |first=Peter |last=Foster |date=16 January 2020 |access-date=11 September 2020 |archive-date=7 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200607044458/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/boris-johnson-brexit-deal-northern-ireland-trade/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
