== History ==

''BuzzFeed News'' began as a division of [[BuzzFeed]] in December 2011 with the appointment of [[Ben Smith (journalist)|Ben Smith]] as editor-in-chief. In 2013, [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Mark Schoofs]] of [[ProPublica]] was hired as head of investigative reporting.<ref name="Mullin-Poynter-2017">{{cite news |last1=Mullin |first1=Benjamin |title=''BuzzFeed News'' gets its first Pulitzer citation |date=April 10, 2017 |url=https://www.poynter.org/news/buzzfeed-news-gets-its-first-pulitzer-citation |work=Poynter }}</ref> By 2016, ''BuzzFeed News'' had 20 investigative journalists.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url=https://www.poynter.org/news/digital-digging-how-buzzfeed-built-investigative-team-inside-viral-hit-factory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130000513/https://www.poynter.org/news/digital-digging-how-buzzfeed-built-investigative-team-inside-viral-hit-factory |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 30, 2017 |title=Digital Digging: How BuzzFeed built an investigative team inside a viral hit factory |website=Poynter |access-date=June 16, 2018|date=February 15, 2016 }}</ref> The British division of ''BuzzFeed News'' is headed by [[Janine Gibson]], formerly of ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref name="Robischon-FC-Quest">{{cite news |last1=Robischon |first1=Noah |title=BuzzFeed's Quest For Impact In The Viral News Era |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3056365/buzzfeeds-quest-for-impact-in-the-viral-news-era |work=Fast Company |date=February 22, 2016}}</ref> Notable coverage includes a 2012 partnership with the BBC on [[match-fixing]] in professional tennis, and inequities in the U.S. [[Guest worker program#H-2 Program|H-2 guest worker program]], reporting of which won a [[National Magazine Award]].<ref name=":1"/>

A 2017 study in the journal ''Journalism'' which compared news articles by BuzzFeed and ''[[The New York Times]]'' found that ''BuzzFeed News'' largely follows established rules of journalism. Both publications predominantly used [[inverted pyramid (journalism)|inverted pyramid]] news format, and journalists' opinions were absent from the majority of articles of both. Both ''BuzzFeed News'' and the ''Times'' predominately covered government and politics, and predominantly used politicians, government, and law enforcement as sources. In contrast, ''BuzzFeed News'' devoted more articles to social issues such as protests and LGBT issues, more frequently quoted ordinary people, less frequently covered crime and terrorism, and had fewer articles focusing on negative aspects of an issue.<ref name="Tandoc2017">{{cite journal |last1=Tandoc |first1=Edson C. |year=2017 |title=Five ways BuzzFeed is preserving (or transforming) the journalistic field |journal=[[Journalism (journal)|Journalism]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=200–216 |doi=10.1177/1464884917691785 }}</ref>

On July 18, 2018, ''BuzzFeed News'' moved from a section of the BuzzFeed site to its own domain, BuzzFeedNews.com,<ref>{{cite news |last=Wang |first=Shan |url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/07/the-investigations-and-reporting-of-buzzfeed-news-not-buzzfeed-are-now-at-their-own-buzzfeednews-com/ |title=The investigations and reporting of BuzzFeed News — *not* BuzzFeed — are now at their own BuzzFeedNews.com |publisher=[[NiemanLab]] |accessdate=July 23, 2018}}</ref> with a Trending News Bar and programmatic advertisements.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ha |first=Anthony |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/buzzfeed-news/ |title=BuzzFeed launches a new website for its real journalism |work=TechCrunch |accessdate=July 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Willens |first=Max |url=https://digiday.com/media/buzzfeed-ditches-native-goes-programmatic-buzzfeed-news/ |title=BuzzFeed ditches native, goes all programmatic with BuzzFeed News |work=[[Digiday]] |date=July 20, 2018 |accessdate=July 23, 2018}}</ref>

== Editorial stance, coverage, and criticism ==

''BuzzFeed News'' states in its editorial guide that "we firmly believe that for a number of issues, including civil rights, women's rights, [[anti-racism]], and [[LGBT equality]], there are not two sides" but goes on to state that "when it comes to activism, BuzzFeed editorial must follow the lead of our editors and reporters who come out of a tradition of rigorous, neutral journalism that puts facts and news first."<ref>{{Cite news|author=Dylan Byers|url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/06/should-news-outlets-declare-allegiances-209576|title=Should news outlets declare allegiances?|work=Politico|date=June 26, 2015}}</ref> Some commentators have criticized BuzzFeed's editorial guide as internally inconsistent, arguing that ''BuzzFeed News'' cannot make claims to be neutral while also endorsing positions on controversial political issues.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Ryan Cooper|url=https://theweek.com/articles/568321/why-buzzfeeds-ethics-guide-incoherent-mess|title=Why BuzzFeed's ethics guide is an incoherent mess|date=July 28, 2015|work=The Week}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author=Timothy P.

The media watchdog [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] found that in 100 BuzzFeed stories about [[Barack Obama]] in 2016 (most from ''BuzzFeed News'', but also from the general BuzzFeed site), 65 were positive, 34 were neutral, and one was critical. The report called BuzzFeed's coverage of Obama "creepy" and "almost uniformly uncritical and often sycophantic".<ref>{{Cite news|author=Adam Johnson|url=https://fair.org/home/buzzfeeds-obama-coverage-is-99-percent-uncritical-and-borderline-creepy/|title=BuzzFeed's Obama Coverage Is 99 Percent Uncritical–and Borderline Creepy|date=June 30, 2016|publisher=Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting}}</ref>

In June 2020, ''BuzzFeed News'' senior reporter [[Ryan Broderick]] was fired after it was revealed he had "plagiarized or misattributed information in at least 11 of his articles."<ref name="TheWrap 2020">{{cite web|last=Chan |first=J.

== Notable stories ==
=== ISDS Exposé ===

On August 28, 2016, [[Chris Hamby]] published a series of articles detailing how international investors were using the [[ISDS]] to "undermine domestic regulations and gut environmental laws at the expense of poorer nations."<ref name="2017Pulitzer">{{cite web |title=Finalist: Chris Hamby of BuzzFeed News, New York, NY |url=https://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/chris-hamby-buzzfeed-news |website=Pulitzer Prize Nominees 2017 |publisher=Pulitzer Foundation |accessdate=11 May 2020}}</ref>.

The Pulitzer Prize nomination cited this as bringing attention to the court, and the articles were cited in a question to the [https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2016-006659_EN.html European Parliament]. In the articles, Hamby dives into cases such as [https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/investment-dispute-settlement/cases/419/sajwani-v-egypt Sajwani v. Egypt] allowed investors who made deals with corrupt regimes to keep those deals after the fall of the regime. He also exposed how the threat of the court is used to prevent fines and expensive environmental cleanups, such as the leak of lead into the groundwater in Sitio del Niño, [[El Salvador]].

The ISDS would go on to be a controversial part of NAFTA<ref>{{cite web |last1=Warren |first1=Elizabeth |title=Warren Urges U.S. Trade Rep to Remove ISDS Provisions During Next Round of NAFTA Negotiations |url=https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-urges-us-trade-rep-to-remove-isds-provisions-during-next-round-of-nafta-negotiations}}</ref> and the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership|TPP]],<ref name="ISDS-TPP">{{cite web |last1=Yu |first1=Peter K. |title=Investor-State Dispute Settlement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership |url=https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=872119091124113026024096001123090087049073070064025021111113077102071086101119122000120032062006006027002112106108097068024011000029026049019124067080028081082011034006054124069097002066105122068074018002112079070124098109086112103080104108074116086&EXT=pdf |website=SSRN |publisher=INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND THE JUDICIARY |accessdate=11 May 2020}}</ref> with the former being stripped of its ISDS provisions and the latter being rejected by the United States.

{{Main|Steele dossier}}
On January 10, 2017, [[CNN]] reported on the existence of classified documents that claimed Russia had compromising personal and financial information about President-elect [[Donald Trump]]. Trump and President Barack Obama had both been briefed on the content of the dossier the previous week. CNN did not publish the dossier, or any specific details of the dossier, as they could not be verified.

''BuzzFeed News'' faced at least two lawsuits as a result of publishing the dossier. In February 2017, Aleksej Gubarev, the Russian chief of the technology company XBT, and a figure named in the dossier, sued ''BuzzFeed News'' for [[defamation]]. The suit centered on the allegations from the dossier that XBT had been "using [[botnet]]s and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct 'altering operations' against the Democratic Party leadership".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=David|last2=Hall|first2=Kevin G.|last3=Gordon|first3=Greg|title=BuzzFeed sued over its publication of uncorroborated Trump dossier|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article130659399.html|work=McClatchy DC|date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> In response, BuzzFeed redacted the name of the company and official in its published dossier.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Eli|title=Russian Executive Sues BuzzFeed Over Unverified Trump Dossier|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/us/russia-trump-buzzfeed-sue.html|work=The New York Times|date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> In May 2017, [[Mikhail Fridman]], [[Petr Aven]], and [[German Khan]] – the owners of [[Alfa-Bank|Alfa Bank]] – filed a defamation lawsuit against ''BuzzFeed News'' for publishing the unverified dossier,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Tom|title=Russian Bankers Sue BuzzFeed Over Publication Of Unverified Trump Dossier|url=http://www.newsweek.com/alfa-bank-buzzfeed-trump-dossier-616763|accessdate=May 28, 2017|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=May 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Gerstein|first1=Josh|title=Russian bank owners sue BuzzFeed over Trump dossier publication|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2017/05/26/trump-dossier-russian-bank-owners-sue-buzzfeed-238876|accessdate=May 28, 2017|work=[[Politico]]|date=May 26, 2017}}</ref> which alleged financial ties and collusion between Putin, Trump, and the three bank owners.<ref name=bombshell>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Geoffrey|title=Here's Why Russian Intelligence Bombshell on Donald Trump Might Be Believable|url=http://fortune.com/2017/01/11/donald-trump-intelligence-russian/|accessdate=April 5, 2018|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=January 11, 2017}}</ref><ref name=jewish>{{cite news|last1=Sommer|first1=Allison Kaplan|title=Controversial Dossier on Trump Alleges That Russia Targets Jewish-American Businessmen|url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/leaked-trump-dossier-alleges-that-russia-targets-jewish-americans-1.5484596|accessdate=April 5, 2018|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=January 11, 2017}}</ref> In January 2018, one year after the dossier became public, Trump's lawyer [[Michael D.

Yiannopoulos and other Breitbart employees developed and marketed the values and tactics of these groups, attempting to make them palatable to a broader audience.

=== Michael Cohen story ===

On January 17, 2019, ''BuzzFeed News'' published an article in which the authors accused Trump of ordering his personal attorney, [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]], to lie to Congress about the timing of a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.<ref>Jason Leopold and Anthony Cormier, ''[https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation?ref=bfnsplash/President Trump Directed His Attorney Michael Cohen To Lie To Congress About The Moscow Tower Project]'', BuzzFeed, January 17, 2019</ref><ref>Jason L. Anthony C.
