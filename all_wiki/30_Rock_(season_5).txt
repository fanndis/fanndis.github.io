On July 31, 2010, NBC announced that an [[Live Show|episode of ''30 Rock'''s fifth season]] would be filmed and broadcast live, twice, on the evening of October 14, 2010. The two separate recordings resulted in a live telecast of the episode to American viewers in both the West and East Coast.

==Synopsis==
Season 5 continues with Liz in a relationship with Carol ([[Matt Damon]]), a man she met in the episode "[[I Do Do]]", and Jack practicing to be and then being a father. Jack finally marries the woman he chose in "I Do Do", but an error in the wedding certificate leads to shocking results. Jack meets with Kabletown's boss, Hank Hooper ([[Ken Howard]]), who acts rather like Kenneth, and meets his competition in his granddaughter, Kaylee Hooper ([[Chloë Grace Moretz]]). Meanwhile, Tracy also becomes a father and finally gets an [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]] ("E" standing for "[[Emmy]]", "G" for "[[Grammy]]", "O" [[Academy Award|Oscar]]", and "T" for "[[Tony Award|Tony]]" ). However, the pressure of being an award-winning celebrity leads Tracy to nearly bring ''TGS'' to cancellation. With the help of Jenna, Kenneth tries to get back into the NBC Page Program. Tracy's wife, Angie, is given a reality show of her own, "[[Queen of Jordan (30 Rock)|Queen of Jordan]]", which was aired as an episode of ''30 Rock''. In the middle of the season, Jack and Avery's daughter is born, but a few episodes later, something happens in their relationship that separates them, possibly forever. Jenna continues her relationship with Paul. ''The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS)'' celebrates its 100th episode.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
The fifth season earned positive reviews from critics, a number of whom noted that it had staged a "comeback" after what they had considered a disappointing [[30 Rock (season 4)|fourth season]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Ryan|last=Keefer|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/45567/30-rock-season-four/|title=30 Rock: Season Four Review|accessdate=September 21, 2010|date=September 21, 2010|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100924152258/http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/45567/30-rock-season-four/| archivedate= 24 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="hitfixreview"/><ref name="avclubreview1"/> Writing for ''[[HitFix]]'', reviewer [[Alan Sepinwall]] noted his disappointment in the fourth season and opined that the fifth had "rebounded", commenting "there have been weeks [...] where ''30 Rock'' made me laugh longer, louder and more frequently than not only every other NBC sitcom, but every comedy on TV". Sepinwall cited a tighter focus on its main characters, a happier [[Liz Lemon]], smarter use of guest stars and a general improvement in quality as the reasons why the series had demonstrated such a turnaround.<ref name="hitfixreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/review-how-30-rock-rebounded-its-way-to-a-strong-season-5|title=Review: How '30 Rock' rebounded its way to a strong season 5|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|work=HitFix|date=May 4, 2011|accessdate=January 30, 2012}}</ref> Nathan Rabin of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' expressed similar sentiments in regard to the fourth season, noting "the growing pains hit hard [...] the show devolved into self-parody". However he considered that "''30 Rock'' found its footing in its fifth season [...] it has at least aged into a show that no longer feels such a desperate need to impress. For all its busyness, it feels a little more comfortable in its own skin".<ref name="avclubreview1">{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/respawn,55490/|title=30 Rock - "Respawn"|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|work=The A.V.

Club|date=January 27, 2011|accessdate=January 30, 2012}}</ref>

Francis Rizzo of ''[[DVD Talk]]'' was also positive about the season, commenting that "the joy of ''30 Rock'' is the way it manages to keep surprising after years of following the same, relatively unchanging characters, thanks to writing that's frequently ridiculous and hilarious, and a cast that makes even the most over-the-top situation feel real, and thus even funnier".<ref name="dvdtalkreview">{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/51871/30-rock-season-5/|title=30 Rock: Season 5|last=Rizzo|first=Francis|work=DVD Talk|date=November 25, 2011|accessdate=January 30, 2012}}</ref>

Alec Baldwin, however, has said on several occasions that both he and the 30 Rock team in general felt that the writing in the fifth season was not up to the high standards of the previous four seasons. (Baldwin attributes this to inevitable burnout) For this reason, Alec Baldwin felt that the show should finish its run after the next - and last contracted - season.  However, the sixth season ended up being so enjoyable - and the quality of the writing so spectacular - that Baldwin had a change of heart, and was prepared to commit for three more seasons (which would have brought the total to nine seasons).  Instead, Tina Fey ended the show after the seventh season; according to Baldwin, she made the decision after having her second child.
