His paternal grandfather, Yitzchak Leib was born in [[Jerusalem]] in 1895 to a community worker and pharmacist named Zalman Yoseph Soloveitchik (b. 1874). Zalman Yoseph was the son of Simchah (c. 1830-1921), a [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] born Jew who emigrated to [[Jerusalem]] where he was called "The Londoner" due to the time he spent living in London. Simcha was the son of [[Eliyahu Soloveitchik]], an uncle to the famous scholar [[Beis Halevi|Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik]].

Salovey spent his early years in northern [[New Jersey]] and attended high school at [[Williamsville North High School]] in a suburb of [[Buffalo, New York]], before moving to [[Greater Los Angeles Area|suburban Los Angeles]] in 1975, when his father was appointed a professor at the [[University of Southern California]].<ref name="CBA">{{cite web |first=Johnny J. |last=Arguelles |title=Peter Salovey |website=The Official Web Site of the California Bluegrass Association |publisher=California Bluegrass Association |date=11 August 2010 |url=http://www.cbaontheweb.org/hook.aspx?hookid=1064 |accessdate=8 November 2012}}</ref> In 1976, he graduated [[valedictorian|co-valedictorian]] from [[Palos Verdes Peninsula High School|Rolling Hills High School]] in [[Rolling Hills Estates, California]].

==Academic biography==
After graduating from Stanford, Salovey moved to [[New Haven, Connecticut]], to pursue a [[Ph.D.]] in psychology at Yale under the guidance of [[Judith Rodin]]. After completing a dissertation entitled "The Effects of Mood and Focus of Attention on Self-Relevant Thoughts and Helping Intention," he graduated from Yale in 1986 and joined the Yale Department of Psychology as an [[Professors in the United States#Assistant Professor|assistant professor]].<ref name="CV" /> He was appointed [[Professors in the United States#Professor|full professor]] in 1995 and now has secondary faculty appointments in Yale's [[Yale School of Management|School of Management]], [[Yale School of Public Health|School of Public Health]] and the Institution for Social and Policy Studies. He is currently the [[Chris Argyris]] Professor of Psychology.

Salovey's most significant research contributions are in the field of [[emotional intelligence]]. With [[John D. Mayer]] he significantly expanded the scope of the concept and authored several of the field's seminal papers, arguing that people have widely ranging abilities pertaining to emotional control, reasoning, and perceptivity.<ref>Although Salovey and Mayer are frequently credited with the term's origination, they attribute it to earlier researchers such as Wayne Payne.</ref> Against earlier theories of intelligence that conceived of emotion as rival to reasoning, Salovey and Mayer contended that emotion could motivate productive outcomes when properly directed.<ref name="Emotional Intelligence Article">{{cite journal |last=Salovey| first=Peter |author2=Mayer, John D. |title=Emotional Intelligence |journal=Imagination, Cognition and Personality |date=1 January 1989 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=185–211 |doi=10.2190/DUGG-P24E-52WK-6CDG}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Chamberlin |first=Jamie |title=Psychologist Peter Salovey named Yale's next President |volume=44 |periodical=Monitor on Psychology  |date=January 2013 |publisher=American Psychological Association |issue=1 |page=11 }}</ref> Subsequently, he has worked to develop models and tests of emotional intelligence, such as the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test]]. Salovey's second vein of research is in health psychology, where he has applied social psychology principles to investigate the efficacy of health messaging in promoting HIV risk reduction, early cancer detection, and smoking cessation. In all, Salovey has authored or edited thirteen books translated into eleven languages and published more than 350 journal articles and essays.

Outside Yale, Salovey has served on the [[National Science Foundation]]'s Social Psychology Advisory Panel, the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] Behavioral Science Working Group, and the NIMH National Advisory Mental Health Council. Salovey served as President of the Society for General Psychology and Treasurer of the International Society for Research on Emotion.  He was the founding editor of the ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' and an associate editor of ''[[Emotion (journal)|Emotion]]'' and ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]''.<ref name="AMWS" /><ref name="President Bio" />
