From 1995 to 2005, the health of combat veterans worsened in comparison with nondeployed veterans, with the onset of more new chronic diseases, functional impairment, repeated clinic visits and hospitalizations, [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]-like illness, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], and greater persistence of adverse health incidents.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Li |first1=B. |last2=Mahan |first2=C.

According to a 2013 report by the [[Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America]], veterans of the U.S. wars in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Iraq]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] may also suffer from Gulf War syndrome,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.armytimes.com/mobile/news/2013/01/gannett-new-vets-showing-gulf-war-illness-symptoms-012313 |title=Report: New vets show Gulf War illness symptoms |author=Kennedy, Kelly |date=23 January 2013 |newspaper=Army Times |accessdate=28 January 2013 |agency=USA Today}}</ref> though later findings identified causes that would not have been present in those wars.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":5" />

== Signs and symptoms ==
According to an April 2010 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) sponsored study conducted by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), part of the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], 250,000<ref name="www8.nationalacademies.org" /> of the 696,842&nbsp;U.S. servicemen and women in the 1991 Gulf War continue to suffer from chronic multi-symptom illness, which the IOM now refers to as ''Gulf War illness''. The IOM found that it continued to affect these veterans nearly 20&nbsp;years after the war.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

According to the IOM, "It is clear that a significant portion of the soldiers deployed to the Gulf War have experienced troubling constellations of symptoms that are difficult to categorize," said committee chair Stephen L. Hauser, professor and chair, department of neurology, [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF). "Unfortunately, symptoms that cannot be easily quantified are sometimes incorrectly dismissed as insignificant and receive inadequate attention and funding by the medical and scientific establishment. Veterans who continue to suffer from these symptoms deserve the very best that modern science and medicine can offer to speed the development of effective treatments, cures, and—we hope—prevention. Our report suggests a path forward to accomplish this goal, and we believe that through a concerted national effort and rigorous scientific input, answers can be found."<ref name="www8.nationalacademies.org" />

Questions still exist regarding why certain veterans showed, and still show, medically unexplained symptoms while others did not, why symptoms are diverse in some and specific in others, and why combat exposure is not consistently linked to having or not having symptoms.  The lack of data on veterans' pre-deployment and immediate post-deployment health status and lack of measurement and monitoring of the various substances to which veterans may have been exposed make it difficult — and in many cases impossible — to reconstruct what happened to service members during their deployments nearly 20&nbsp;years after the fact, the committee noted.<ref name="www8.nationalacademies.org" /> The report called for a substantial commitment to improving identification and treatment of multisymptom illness in Gulf War veterans focussing on continued monitoring of Gulf War veterans, improved medical care, examination of genetic differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups and studies of environment-gene interactions.<ref name="www8.nationalacademies.org" />

Birth defects have been suggested as a consequence of Gulf War deployment.  However, a 2006 review of several studies of international coalition veterans' children found no strong or consistent evidence of an increase in birth defects, finding a modest increase in birth defects that was within the range of the general population, in addition to being unable to exclude [[recall bias]] as an explanation for the results.<ref name="DoyleReview">{{cite journal |last1=Doyle |first1=P. |last2=MacOnochie |first2=N. |last3=Ryan |first3=M. |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1817 |title=Reproductive health of Gulf War veterans |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=361 |issue=1468 |pages=571–584 |year=2006 |pmid=16687262 |pmc=1569619}}</ref> A 2008 report stated that "it is difficult to draw firm conclusions related to birth defects and pregnancy outcomes in Gulf War veterans", observing that while there have been "significant, but modest, excess rates of birth defects in children of Gulf War veterans", the "overall rates are still within the normal range found in the general population".<ref name=GWV_08_p50>{{cite report |year=2008 |title=Gulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans, Scientific Findings and Recommendations |publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs |page=50 (p. 60 in PDF) |url=http://www.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/docs/Committee_Documents/GWIandHealthofGWVeterans_RAC-GWVIReport_2008.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603002651/http://www1.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/docs/Committee_Documents/GWIandHealthofGWVeterans_RAC-GWVIReport_2008.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-03 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The same report called for more research on the issue.

A 2017 study by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs found that veterans possibly exposed to chemical warfare agents at [[Khamisiyah]] experienced different patterns of brain cancer mortality risk compared to the other groups, with veterans possibly exposed having a higher risk of brain cancer in the time period immediately following the Gulf War.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Barth |first1=Shannon K. |last2=Dursa |first2=Erin K. |last3=Bossarte |first3=Robert M. |last4=Schneiderman |first4=Aaron I. |date=October 2017 |title=Trends in brain cancer mortality among U.S. Gulf War veterans: 21 year follow-up |journal=Cancer Epidemiology |volume=50 |issue=Part A |pages=22–29 |doi=10.1016/j.canep.2017.07.012 |issn=1877-783X |pmc=5824993 |pmid=28780478}}</ref>

== Causes ==
The [[United States Congress]] mandated the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]]' contract with the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) to provide reports on Gulf War illnesses. Since 1998, the NAS's Institute of Medicine (IOM) has authored ten such reports.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/announcement.asp |title=Gulf War exposures announcement |website=publichealth.va.gov |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218093021/http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/announcement.asp |archivedate=2009-12-18 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In addition to the many physical and psychological issues involving any war zone deployment, Gulf War veterans were exposed to a unique mix of hazards not previously experienced during wartime. These included [[pyridostigmine bromide]] pills (given to protect troops from the effects of nerve agents), depleted uranium munitions, and multiple simultaneous vaccinations including [[anthrax vaccine|anthrax]] and [[botulinum]] toxin vaccines. The oil and smoke that spewed for months from hundreds of burning oil wells presented another exposure hazard not previously encountered in a war zone. Military personnel also had to cope with swarms of insects, requiring the widespread use of pesticides. High-powered microwaves were used to disrupt Iraqi communications, and though it is unknown whether this might have contributed to the syndrome, research has suggested that safety limits for electromagnetic radiation are too lenient.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://www.veterans.senate.gov/hearings.cfm?action=release.display&release_id=a22ac85f-bc73-435f-b78b-3b107a51cf87 |title=Gulf War Illnesses |year=2007 |publisher=U.S. Senate Veterans Affairs Committee |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227190650/http://veterans.senate.gov/hearings.cfm?action=release.display&release_id=a22ac85f-bc73-435f-b78b-3b107a51cf87 |archive-date=2013-02-27 |df=dmy-all}}, Testimony to the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee by Meryl Nass, MD on September 25, 2007</ref>

The Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses (RAC), a VA federal advisory committee mandated by Congress in legislation enacted in 1998,<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":4" /> found that pre-2005 studies suggested the veterans' illnesses are neurological and apparently are linked to exposure to [[neurotoxin]]s, such as the nerve gas sarin, the anti-nerve gas drug [[pyridostigmine bromide]], and [[pesticide]]s that affect the nervous system. The RAC concluded in 2004 that, "research studies conducted since the war have consistently indicated that psychiatric illness, combat experience or other deployment-related stressors do not explain Gulf War veterans illnesses in the large majority of ill veterans."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/docs/Committee_Documents/ReportandRecommendations_ScientificProgressinUnderstandingGWVI_2004.pdf |collaboration=Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses |date=September 2004 |title=Scientific Progress in Understanding Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses: Report and Recommendations |publisher=United States Department of Veterans Affairs |accessdate=2012-05-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319024036/http://www.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/docs/Committee_Documents/ReportandRecommendations_ScientificProgressinUnderstandingGWVI_2004.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-19 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The RAC concluded<ref name=":0" /> that "exposure to pesticides and/or to PB [pyridostigmine bromide nerve agent protective pills] are causally associated with GWI and the neurological dysfunction in GW veterans. Exposure to [[sarin]] and [[cyclosarin]] and to [[oil well fire]] emissions are also associated with neurologically based health effects, though their contribution to development of the disorder known as GWI is less clear. Gene-environment interactions are likely to have contributed to development of GWI in deployed veterans. The health consequences of chemical exposures in the GW and other conflicts have been called “toxic wounds” by veterans. This type of injury requires further study and concentrated treatment research efforts that may also benefit other occupational groups with similar exposure-related illnesses."<ref name=":5" />

However, there are suggestions that long-term exposure to high doses of DU may cause other health problems unrelated to GWI.<ref name="FedReport" />

More recent medical literature reviews disagree, stating for example that, "the number of Gulf War veterans who developed the Gulf War syndrome following exposure to high quantities of DU has risen to about one-third of the 800,000 U.S. forces deployed," with 25,000 of those having suffered premature death.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Faa, A. |display-authors=etal |year=2018 |via=researchgate.net |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316656324 |title=Depleted uranium and human health |journal=Current Medicinal Chemistry |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=49–64 |doi=10.2174/0929867324666170426102343 |type=Review Article |pmid=28462701}}</ref> Since 2011, US combat veterans may claim disability compensation for health problems related to exposure to depleted uranium.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/depleted_uranium/ |title=Depleted Uranium |department=Public Health |website=publichealth.va.gov}}</ref> The [[Veterans Administration]] decides these claims on a case-by-case basis.

==== Pyridostigmine bromide nerve gas antidote ====
The US military issued [[pyridostigmine bromide]] (PB) pills to protect against exposure to nerve gas agents such as sarin and [[soman]]. PB was used as a [[prophylactic]] against nerve agents; it is not a vaccine. Taken before exposure to nerve agents, PB was thought to increase the efficiency of nerve agent antidotes. PB had been used since 1955 for patients suffering from [[myasthenia gravis]] with doses up to 1,500&nbsp;mg a day, far in excess of the 90&nbsp;mg given to soldiers, and was considered safe by the FDA at either level for indefinite use and its use to pre-treat nerve agent exposure had recently been approved.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=PBS |work=Frontline |accessdate=2012-05-09 |date=1996-12-01 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/syndrome/analysis/pyribrom.html |title=Pyridostigmine bromide use in the First Gulf War |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112142950/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/syndrome/analysis/pyribrom.html |archivedate=2012-11-12 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Given both the large body of epidemiological data on myasthenia gravis patients and follow-up studies done on veterans it was concluded that while it was unlikely that health effects reported today by Gulf War veterans are the result of exposure solely to PB, use of PB was [[Causality|causally associated]] with illness.<ref name=FedReport /> However, a later review by the [[Institute of Medicine]] concluded that the evidence was not strong enough to establish a causal relationship.<ref name="iom_p13">{{cite book |page=13 |author=Committee on Gulf War and Health: Treatment for Chronic Multisymptom Illness; Board on the Health of Select Populations; Institute of Medicine |title=Gulf War and Health: Treatment for Chronic Multisymptom Illness |year=2013 |publisher=[[National Academies Press]]}}</ref>

==== Organophosphates ====
[[Organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy]] (OPIDN, aka organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy) may contribute to the unexplained illnesses of the Gulf War veterans.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2017.08.451 |title=New insights into the organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy |journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences |volume=381 |pages=153–159 |year=2017 |last1=Qiang |first1=D |last2=Xie |first2=X |last3=Gao |first3=Z}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmc=3042861|title=Neuropsychological and psychiatric functioning in sheep farmers exposed to low levels of organophosphate pesticides}}</ref>

===== Organophosphate pesticides =====
The use of [[organophosphate]] [[pesticides]] and [[DEET|insect repellents]] during the first Gulf War is credited with keeping rates of pest-borne diseases low.

Chemical detection units from Czechoslovakia, France, and Britain confirmed chemical agents. French detection units detected chemical agents. Both Czech and French forces reported detections immediately to U.S. forces. U.S. forces detected, confirmed, and reported chemical agents; and U.S. soldiers were awarded medals for detecting chemical agents. The [[Riegle Report]] said that chemical alarms went off 18,000 times during the Gulf War. After the air war started on January 16, 1991, coalition forces were chronically exposed to low but nonlethal levels of chemical and biological agents released primarily by direct Iraqi attack via [[missile]]s, [[rocket]]s, [[artillery]], or aircraft [[munitions]] and by fallout from allied bombings of Iraqi chemical warfare munitions facilities.<ref>{{citation |title=U.S. Chemical and Biological Warfare-Related Dual Use Exports to Iraq and their Possible Impact on the Health Consequences of the Gulf War |date=1994-02-09 |accessdate=2012-05-09 |df=dmy-all |last=Riegle |first=D.

In 1997, the US Government released an unclassified report that stated:
: "The [[US Intelligence Community]] (IC) has assessed that Iraq did not use chemical weapons during the Gulf war. However, based on a comprehensive review of intelligence information and relevant information made available by the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), we conclude that chemical warfare (CW) agent was released as a result of US postwar demolition of rockets with chemical warheads in a bunker (called Bunker&nbsp;73 by Iraq) and a pit in an area known as Khamisiyah."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/gulf/cia/970409/cia_wp.html |title=Khamisiyah: A Historical Perspective on Related Intelligence |author=Persian Gulf War Illnesses Task Force |date=April 9, 1997 |accessdate=March 29, 2015 |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722221240/https://fas.org/irp/gulf/cia/970409/cia_wp.html |archivedate=July 22, 2013}}</ref>

Recent studies have confirmed earlier suspicions that exposure to sarin, in combination with other contaminants such as pesticides and PB were related to reports of veteran illness. Estimates range from 100,000 to 300,000&nbsp;individuals exposed to nerve agents.<ref name=Golomb08>{{cite journal |author=Golomb BA |title=Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and Gulf War illnesses |journal=Proc.

While low-level exposure to nerve agents has been suggested as the cause of GWI, the 2008 report by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War illnesses (RAC) stated that "evidence is inconsistent or limited in important ways."<ref name=RAC11 /> The VA's 2014 RAC report concluded that, "exposure to the nerve gas agents sarin/cyclosarin has been linked in two more studies to changes in structural magnetic resonance imaging findings that are associated with cognitive decrements, further supporting the conclusion from evidence reviewed in the 2008 report that exposure to these agents is etiologically important to the central nervous system dysfunction that occurs in some subsets of Gulf War veterans."<ref name=":0" />

=== Less likely causes ===
According to the VA's 2008 RAC report, "For several Gulf War exposures, an association with Gulf War illness cannot be ruled out. These include low-level exposure to nerve agents, close proximity to oil well fires, receipt of multiple vaccines, and effects of combinations of Gulf War exposures." However, several potential causes of GWI were deemed, "not likely to have caused Gulf War illness for the majority of ill veterans," including "depleted uranium, anthrax vaccine, fuels, solvents, sand and particulates, infectious diseases, and chemical agent resistant coating (CARC)," for which "there is little evidence supporting an association with Gulf War illness or a major role is unlikely based on what is known about exposure patterns during the Gulf War and more recent deployments."<ref name="RAC11">{{cite report |last=Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|title=Gulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans: Scientific Findings and Recommendations |url=http://www.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/docs/Committee_Documents/GWIandHealthofGWVeterans_RAC-GWVIReport_2008.pdf |page=1 |year=2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603002651/http://www1.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/docs/Committee_Documents/GWIandHealthofGWVeterans_RAC-GWVIReport_2008.pdf |url-status=live |location=Washington, DC |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |archivedate=2014-06-03 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The VA's 2014 RAC report reinforced its 2008 report findings: "The research reviewed in this report supports and reinforces the conclusion in the 2008 RACGWVI report that exposures to pesticides and pyridostigmine bromide are causally associated with Gulf War illness. Evidence also continues to demonstrate that Gulf War illness is not the result of psychological stressors during the war." It also found additional evidence since the 2008 report for the role of [[sarin]] in GWI, but inadequate evidence regarding exposures to oil well fires, vaccines, and depleted uranium to make new conclusions about them.<ref name=":0" />

==== Oil well fires ====
During the war, many [[Kuwaiti oil fires|oil wells were set on fire in Kuwait]] by the retreating Iraqi army, and the smoke from those fires was inhaled by large numbers of soldiers, many of whom suffered acute [[pulmonary]] and other chronic effects, including [[asthma]] and [[bronchitis]]. However, firefighters who were assigned to the oil well fires and encountered the smoke, but who did not take part in combat, have not had GWI symptoms.<ref name=RAC_GWVI_Minutes_2005/>{{rp|pages=148, 154, 156}} The 2008 RAC report states that "evidence [linking oil well fires to GWI] is inconsistent or limited in important ways."<ref name="RAC11" />

== Diagnosis ==
Clinical diagnosis of Gulf War illness has been complicated by multiple case definitions. In 2014, the [[National Academy of Sciences]] [[Institute Of Medicine|Institute of Medicine]] (IOM)—contracted by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]] for the task—released a report concluding that the creation of a new [[Clinical case definition|case definition]] for chronic multisymptom illness in Gulf War veterans was not possible because of insufficient evidence in published studies regarding its onset, duration, severity, frequency of symptoms, exclusionary criteria, and laboratory findings. Instead, the report recommended the use of two case definitions, the "Kansas" definition and the "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)" definition, noting: "There is a set of symptoms (fatigue, pain, [[neurocognitive]]) that are reported in all the studies that have been reviewed. The CDC definition captures those three symptoms; the Kansas definition also captures them, but it also includes the symptoms reported most frequently by Gulf War veterans."<ref name=":1">{{cite book |title=Chronic Multisymptom Illness in Gulf War Veterans: Case Definitions Reexamined |department=Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences |collaboration=Committee on the Development of a Consensus Case Definition for Chronic Multisymptom illness in 1990–1991 Gulf War Veterans |publisher=National Academies Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-309-29877-3 |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=90–99 |oclc=880456748}}</ref>

The Kansas case definition is more specific and may be more applicable for research settings, while the CDC case definition is more broad and may be more applicable for clinical settings.<ref name=":1" />

=== Classification ===
Medical ailments associated with service in the 1990–1991 Gulf War have been recognized by both the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]].<ref name=veteranIllnesses>{{cite web |url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/associated_illnesses.asp |title=Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses: Illnesses Associated with Gulf War Service |date=nd |accessdate=2012-05-09 |publisher=United States Department of Veterans Affairs |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212190215/http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/associated_illnesses.asp |archivedate=2012-02-12 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Before 1998, the terms ''Gulf War syndrome, Gulf War veterans' illness, unexplained illness'', and ''undiagnosed illness'' were used interchangeably to describe chronic unexplained symptoms in veterans of the 1991 Gulf War. The term ''chronic multisymptom illness'' (CMI) was first used following publication of a 1998 study<ref name=":2" /> describing chronic unexplained symptoms in Air Force veterans of the 1991 Gulf War.<ref name="iom_p13" />

In a 2014 report contracted by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]], the [[National Academy of Sciences]] Institute of Medicine recommended the use the term ''Gulf War illness'' rather than ''chronic multisymptom illness''.<ref name=":1" /> Since that time, relevant publications by the National Academy of Science and the U.S. Department of Defense have used only the term ''Gulf War illness'' (GWI).

The [[U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) confusingly still uses an array of both old and new terminology for ''Gulf War illness''. VA's specialty clinical evaluation War Related Illness and Injury Study Centers (WRIISCs) use the recommended term ''Gulf War illness'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.warrelatedillness.va.gov/WARRELATEDILLNESS/education/factsheets/gulf-war-illness-for-veterans.pdf |series=Gulf War Illness |title=Information for Veterans |website=War Related Illness and Injury Study Center}}</ref> as do VA's Office of Research and Development (VA-ORD) and many recent VA research publications.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.research.va.gov/currents/1017-Evidence-of-DNA-damage-in-Vets-with-Gulf-War-illness.cfm |title=Researchers find evidence of DNA damage in Vets with Gulf War illness |last=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Research and Development |date=2017-10-19 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, VA's Public Health website still uses ''Gulf War veterans' medically unexplained illnesses'', ''chronic multi-symptom illness'' (CMI), and ''undiagnosed illnesses'', but explains that VA doesn't use the term ''Gulf War syndrome'' because of varying symptoms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/medically-unexplained-illness.asp |title=Gulf War Veterans' Medically Unexplained Illnesses |series=Public Health |publisher=US Department of Veterans Affairs |department=Veterans Health Administration |website=publichealth.va.gov |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224112435/http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/medically-unexplained-illness.asp |archivedate=2014-02-24 |df=dmy-all |url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Veterans Health Administration]] (VHA) originally classified individuals with related ailments believed to be connected to their service in the Persian Gulf a special non-ICD-9 code DX111, as well as ICD-9 code V65.5.<ref>{{cite web |collaboration=Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Initiative |url=http://www.hanford.gov/hanford/files/VA_GuidetoGulfWarVeteransHealth.pdf |title=A Guide to Gulf War Veterans' Health |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926215559/http://www.hanford.gov/hanford/files/VA_GuidetoGulfWarVeteransHealth.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-26 |df=dmy-all |year=2002}}</ref>

=== Kansas definition ===
In 1998, the State of Kansas Persian Gulf Veterans Health Initiative sponsored an epidemiological survey led by Dr. Lea Steele of deployment-related symptoms in 2,030 Gulf War veterans. The result was a "clinically based descriptive definition using correlated symptoms" in six symptom groups: fatigue and sleep problems, pain, neurologic and mood, gastrointestinal, respiratory symptoms, and skin (dermatologic) symptoms.<ref name=":1" />

To meet the "Kansas" case definition, a veteran of the 1990–91 Gulf War must have symptoms in at least three of the six symptom domains, which during the survey were scored based on severity ("severity"). Symptom onset must have developed during or after deploying to the 1990–91 Gulf War theatre of operations ("onset") and must have been present in the year before interview ("duration"). Participants were excluded if they had a diagnosis of or were being treated for any of several conditions that might otherwise explain their symptoms ("exclusionary criteria"), including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, chronic infectious disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis, stroke, or any serious psychiatric condition.<ref name=":1" />

Applying the Kansas case definition to the original Kansas study cohort resulted in a prevalence of Gulf War illness of 34.2% in Gulf War veterans and 8.3% in nondeployed Gulf War era veterans, or an excess rate of GWI of 26.3% in Gulf War veterans.<ref name=":1" />

=== CDC definition ===
Also in 1998, a study published by Dr. Keiji Fukuda under the auspices of the [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) examined chronic multisymptom illness through a cross-sectional survey of 3,675 ill and healthy [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] veterans of the 1990–91 Gulf War, including from a [[Pennsylvania]]-based [[Air National Guard]] unit and three comparison Air Force units. The CDC case definition was derived from clinical data and [[statistical analyses]].<ref name=":1" />

The result was a symptom-category approach to a case definition, with three symptom categories: fatigue, mood–cognition, and musculoskeletal. To meet the case definition, the veteran of the 1990–91 Gulf War must have symptoms in two of the three categories and have experienced the illness for six months or longer ("duration").<ref name=":1" />

The original study also including a determination of severity of symptoms ("severity"). "Severe cases were identified if at least one symptom in each of the required categories was rated as severe. Of 1,155 participating Gulf War veterans, 6% had severe CMI, and 39% had mild to moderate CMI; of the 2,520 nondeployed era veterans Of 1,155 participating Gulf War veterans, 6% had severe CMI, and 39% had mild to moderate CMI; of the 2,520 nondeployed era veterans, 0.7% had severe and 14% had mild to moderate CMI."<ref name=":1" />

== Treatment ==
A 2013 report by the [[Institute of Medicine]] reviewed the peer-reviewed published medical literature for evidence regarding treatments for symptoms associated with ''chronic multisymptom illness'' (CMI) in 1990–91 Gulf War veterans, and in other chronic multisymptom conditions. For the studies the report reviewed that were specifically regarding CMI in 1990–91 Gulf War veterans (''Gulf War illness''), the report made the following conclusions:<ref name="iom_p13" />
* [[Doxycycline]]: "Although the study of doxycycline was found to have high strength of evidence and was conducted in a group of 1991 Gulf War veterans who had CMI, it did not demonstrate efficacy; that is, doxycycline did not reduce or eliminate the symptoms of CMI in the study population."
* [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]] (CBT) and Exercise: "These studies evaluated the effects of exercise and CBT in combination and individually. The therapeutic benefit of exercise was unclear in those studies. Group CBT rather than exercise may confer the main therapeutic benefit with respect to physical symptoms."

The report concluded: "On the basis of the evidence reviewed, the committee cannot recommend any specific therapy as a set treatment for [Gulf War] veterans who have CMI. The committee believes that a 'one-size-fits-all' approach is not effective for managing [Gulf War] veterans who have CMI and that individualized health care management plans are necessary."<ref name="iom_p13" />

By contrast, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) noted in a May 2018 publication that the primary focus of its Gulf War illness Research Program (GWIRP) "has been to fund research studies to identify treatment targets and test interventional approaches to alleviate symptoms. While most of these studies remain in progress, several have already shown varying levels of promise as GWI treatments."

According to the May 2018 DoD publication:<ref name=":3" />{{Long quote|date=November 2020}}

<blockquote>'''''Published Results on Treatments'''''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''The earliest federally funded multi-center clinical trials were VA- and DoD-funded trials that focused on antibiotic treatment (doxycycline) (Donta, 2004) and cognitive behavioral therapy with exercise (Donta, 2003). Neither intervention provided long-lasting improvement for a substantial number of Veterans.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Preliminary analysis from a placebo-controlled trial showed that 100&nbsp;mg of Coenzyme&nbsp;Q10 (known as CoQ10 or Ubiquinone) significantly improved general self-reported health and physical functioning, including among 20&nbsp;symptoms, each of which was present in at least half of the study participants, with the exception of sleep. These improvements included reducing commonly reported symptoms of fatigue, dysphoric mood, and pain (Golomb, 2014). These results are currently being expanded in a GWIRP-funded trial of a "mitochondrial cocktail" for GWI of CoQ10 plus a number of nutrients chosen to support cellular energy production and defend against oxidative stress. The treatment is also being investigated in a larger, VA- sponsored Phase III trial of Ubiquinol, the reduced form of CoQ10.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''In a randomized, sham-controlled VA-funded trial of a nasal CPAP mask (Amin, 2011-b), symptomatic GW Veterans with sleep-disordered breathing receiving the CPAP therapy showed significant improvements in fatigue scores, cognitive function, sleep quality, and measures of physical and mental health (Amin, 2011a).''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Preliminary data from a GWIRP-funded acupuncture treatment study showed that Veterans reported significant reductions in pain and both primary and secondary health complaints, with results being more positive in the bi-weekly versus weekly treatment group (Conboy, 2012). Current studies funded by the GWIRP and the VA are also investigating yoga as a treatment for GWI.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''An amino acid supplement containing L-carnosine was found to reduce irritable bowel syndrome-associated diarrhea in a randomized, controlled GWIRP-funded trial in GW Veterans (Baraniuk, 2013). Veterans receiving L-carnosine showed a significant improvement in performance in a cognitive task, but no improvement in fatigue, pain, hyperalgesia, or activity levels.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Results from a 26&nbsp;week GWIRP-funded trial comparing standard care to nasal irrigation with either saline or a xylitol solution revealed that both irrigation protocols reduced GWI respiratory (chronic rhinosinusitis) and fatigue symptoms (Hayer, 2015).''</blockquote>

== Prognosis ==
According to the May&nbsp;2018 DoD publication cited above, "Research suggests that the GWI symptomology experienced by Veterans has not improved over the last 25&nbsp;years, with few experiencing improvement or recovery ...&nbsp;. Many [Gulf War] Veterans will soon begin to experience the common co-morbidities associated with aging. The effect that aging will have on this unique and vulnerable population remains a matter of significant concern, and population-based research to obtain a better understanding of mortality, morbidity, and symptomology over time is needed."<ref name=":3" />

== Prevalence ==
The 2008 and 2014 VA (RAC) reports and the 2010 IOM report found that the chronic multisymptom illness in Gulf War veterans—Gulf War illness—is more prevalent in Gulf War veterans than their non-deployed counterparts or veterans of previous conflicts.<ref name="FedReport" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name="books.nap.edu" /> While a 2009 study found the pattern of comorbidities similar for actively deployed and nondeployed Australian military personnel, the large body of U.S. research reviewed in the VA and IOM reports showed the opposite in U.S. troops.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kelsall |first1=H.L. |last2=McKenzie |first2=D.P. |last3=Sim |first3=M.R. |last4=Leder |first4=K. |last5=Forbes |first5=A.B. |last6=Dwyer |first6=T. |year=2009 |title=Physical, psychological, and functional comorbidities of multisymptom illness in Australian male veterans of the 1991 Gulf War |journal=Am J Epidemiol |volume=170 |issue=8 |pages=1048–56 |pmid=19762370 |doi=10.1093/aje/kwp238|doi-access=free }}</ref> The VA's 2014 RAC report found Gulf War illness in "an excess of 26–32&nbsp;percent of Gulf War veterans compared to nondeployed era veterans" in pre-2008 studies, and "an overall multisymptom illness prevalence of 37&nbsp;percent in Gulf War veterans and an excess prevalence of 25&nbsp;percent" in a later, larger VA study.<ref name=":0" />

According to a May&nbsp;2018 report by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], "GWI is estimated to have affected 175,000 to 250,000 of the nearly 700,000&nbsp;troops deployed to the 1990–1991 GW theater of operations. Twenty-seven of the 28&nbsp;Coalition members participating in the GW conflict have reported GWI in their troops. Epidemiologic studies indicate that rates of GWI vary in different subgroups of GW Veterans. GWI affects Veterans who served in the U.S. Army and Marines Corps at higher rates than those who served in the Navy and Air Force, and U.S. enlisted personnel are affected more than officers. Studies also indicate that GWI rates differ according to where Veterans were located during deployment, with the highest rates among troops who served in forward areas."<ref name=":3">{{cite web |url=http://cdmrp.army.mil/gwirp/pdfs/GWIRP_Landscape.pdf |title=The Gulf War Illness Landscape |collaboration=Gulf War Illness Research Program |quote=Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program |publisher=U.S. Department of Defense |date=May 2018 |access-date=2018-07-11 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Research ==
Epidemiologic studies have looked at many suspected causal factors for Gulf War illness as seen in veteran populations. Below is a summary of epidemiologic studies of veterans displaying multisymptom illness and their exposure to suspect conditions from the 2008 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs report.<ref name=RAC230>{{cite report |year=2008 |title=Gulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans, Scientific Findings and Recommendations |publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs |page=220 (p. 230 in PDF) |url=http://www.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/docs/Committee_Documents/GWIandHealthofGWVeterans_RAC-GWVIReport_2008.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603002651/http://www1.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/docs/Committee_Documents/GWIandHealthofGWVeterans_RAC-GWVIReport_2008.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-03 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

A fuller understanding of immune function in ill Gulf War veterans is needed, particularly in veteran subgroups with different clinical characteristics and exposure histories. It is also important to determine the extent to which identified immune perturbations may be associated with altered neurological and endocrine processes that are associated with immune regulation.<ref name=GWVI_08_p262>{{cite report |year=2008 |title=Gulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans, Scientific Findings and Recommendations |publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs |page=262 (p. 272 in PDF) |url=http://www.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/docs/Committee_Documents/GWIandHealthofGWVeterans_RAC-GWVIReport_2008.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603002651/http://www1.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/docs/Committee_Documents/GWIandHealthofGWVeterans_RAC-GWVIReport_2008.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-03 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Very limited cancer data have been reported for U.S. Gulf War veterans in general, and no published research on cases occurring after 1999.

In addition, cancer rates should be evaluated in relation to identifiable exposure and location subgroups.<ref name=RAC55>{{cite report |year=2008 |title=Gulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans, Scientific Findings and Recommendations |publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs |page=45 (p. 55 in PDF) |url=http://www.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/docs/Committee_Documents/GWIandHealthofGWVeterans_RAC-GWVIReport_2008.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603002651/http://www1.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/docs/Committee_Documents/GWIandHealthofGWVeterans_RAC-GWVIReport_2008.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-03 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
An early argument in the years following the Gulf War was that similar syndromes have been seen as an after effect of other conflicts — for example, "[[shell shock]]" after [[World War I]], and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) after the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hyams |first=Kenneth C. |date=1996-09-01 |df=dmy-all |title=War Syndromes and Their Evaluation: From the U.S. Civil War to the Persian Gulf War |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=398–405 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-125-5-199609010-00007 |pmid=8702091 |issn=0003-4819}}</ref> Cited as evidence for this argument was a review of the medical records of 15,000&nbsp;[[American Civil War]] soldiers showing that "those who lost at least 5% of their company had a 51% increased risk of later development of cardiac, gastrointestinal, or nervous disease."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pizarro |first1=Judith |last2=Silver |first2=Roxane Cohen |last3=Prause |first3=JoAnn |date=2006-02-01 |df=dmy-all |title=Physical and Mental Health Costs of Traumatic War Experiences Among Civil War Veterans |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=63| issue=2 |pages=193–200 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.2.193 |pmid=16461863 |pmc=1586122 |issn=0003-990X}}</ref>

Early Gulf War research also failed to accurately account for the prevalence, duration, and health impact of Gulf War illness. For example, a November&nbsp;1996 article in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' found no difference in death rates, hospitalization rates, or self-reported symptoms between Persian Gulf veterans and non-Persian Gulf veterans. This article was a compilation of dozens of individual studies involving tens of thousands of veterans. The study did find a statistically significant elevation in the number of traffic accidents suffered by Gulf War veterans.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=Gregory C. |last2=Coate |first2=Bruce D. |last3=Anderson |first3=Christy M. |last4=Kang |first4=Han K. |last5=Berg |first5=S.

In contrast to those early studies, in January&nbsp;2006, a study led by Melvin Blanchard published in the ''[[Journal of Epidemiology]]'', part of the "National Health Survey of Gulf War-Era Veterans and Their Families", found that veterans deployed in the Persian Gulf War had nearly twice the prevalence of chronic multisymptom illness, a cluster of symptoms similar to a set of conditions often at that time called Gulf War Syndrome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://record.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/6377.html |title=Study finds multisymptom condition is more prevalent among Persian Gulf vets |last=Purdy |first=M.C. |date=2006-01-20 |publisher=[[Washington University in St. Louis]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414152555/http://record.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/6377.html |archive-date=2009-04-14 |url-status=live |access-date=2012-05-09 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>
[[File:Louis Jones Jr - edit-NR.jpg|thumb|216x216px|[[Louis Jones Jr]]. claimed Gulf War syndrome as a defense in his murder trial]]
On November 17, 2008, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs| Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses (RAC), a Congressionally mandated [[Federal Advisory Committee Act|federal advisory committee]] composed of VA-appointed clinicians, researchers, and representative Gulf War veterans,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.va.gov/rac-gwvi/ |title=Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses home page |collaboration=Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses |website=va.gov |language=en |access-date=2018-07-11 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> issued a major report announcing scientific findings, in part, that "''Gulf War illness is real''", that GWI is a distinct physical condition, and that it is not psychological in nature. The 454&nbsp;page report reviewed 1,840&nbsp;published studies to form its conclusions identifying the high prevalence of Gulf War illness, suggesting likely causes rooted in toxic exposures while ruling out combat stress as a cause, and opining that treatments likely could be found. It recommended that Congress increase funding for treatment-focused Gulf War illness research to at least $60&nbsp;million per year.<ref name="CNN">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/11/17/gulf.war.illness.study/index.html |title=Gulf War illness is real, new federal report says |publisher=[[CNN]] |last=Silverleib |first=A. |date=2008-12-09 |accessdate=2012-05-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109040324/http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/11/17/gulf.war.illness.study/index.html |archivedate=2012-11-09 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="RAC11"/>

In March&nbsp;2013, a hearing was held before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], to determine not whether Gulf War illness exists, but rather how it is identified, diagnosed and treated, and how the tools put in place to aid these efforts have been used.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo45677 |title=Gulf War: What Kind of Care Are Veterans Receiving 20&nbsp;Years Later? |quote=Hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives, One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, First Session, Wednesday, March 13, 2013. |department=Committee on Veterans' Affairs |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives}}</ref>

By 2016, the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) concluded there was sufficient evidence of a positive association between deployment to the 1990–1991 Gulf War and Gulf War illness.<ref>{{cite book |series=Gulf War and Health |volume=10 |title=Update of Health Effects of Serving in the Gulf War |editor1-first=Deborah |editor1-last=Cory-Slechta |editor2-first=Roberta |editor2-last=Wedge |collaboration=Committee on Gulf War and Health |quote=Board on the Health of Select Populations; Institute of Medicine, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine |publisher=National Academy Press |others=Fulco, Carolyn; Liverman, Catharyn T.; Sox, Harold C.; Mitchell, Abigail E.; Sivitz, Laura; Black, Robert E. |year=2016 |isbn=978-0-309-07178-9 |location=Washington, D.C. |page=11 |oclc=45180227}}</ref>
