Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975 along with her then-boyfriend [[Lindsey Buckingham]].

The album remained at number one on the American albums chart for 31 weeks and reached number one in other countries. The album won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1978. It produced four U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top-ten singles, with Nicks' "[[Dreams (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dreams]]" being the band's only ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one hit.

In 1981, while remaining a member of Fleetwood Mac, Nicks began her solo career, releasing the studio album ''[[Bella Donna (album)|Bella Donna]]'', which topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and has reached [[RIAA certification|multiplatinum]] status.<ref>{{certification Cite|region=United States|type=album|artist=Stevie Nicks|title=Bella Donna}}</ref> She has released eight solo studio albums.

== Life and career ==

=== 1948–1971: Early life and career beginnings ===
Stephanie "Stevie" Nicks was born at Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona to Jess (July 2, 1925 – August 10, 2005),<ref>Stevie Nicks, The lSource, 1981.</ref> and Barbara Nicks (November 12, 1927 – December 29, 2011). Nicks is of German, English and Irish ancestry. Nicks's grandfather, Aaron Jess "A.J." Nicks Sr., taught Nicks to sing duets with him by the time she was four years old. Nicks's mother was protective, keeping her at home "more than most people" and fostered in her daughter a love of fairy tales. Toddler Stephanie could pronounce her own name only as "tee-dee", which led to her nickname of "Stevie".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/family.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on her Family |publisher=inherownwords.com |access-date=June 1, 2010}}</ref>
Her father's frequent relocation as the president of [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] had the family living in Phoenix, Arizona; Albuquerque, New Mexico; El Paso, Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; Los Angeles; and San Francisco. With the [[Goya guitar]] that she received for her 16th birthday, Nicks wrote her first song, titled "I've Loved and I've Lost, and I'm Sad but Not Blue". She spent her adolescence playing records constantly, and lived in her "own little musical world".<ref name="nicksfix1980">{{cite news|url=http://www.nicksfix.com/rs_issue310.htm |title=Five Not So Easy Pieces |work=Rolling Stone&nbsp;– Issue 310 |author=Daisann McLane |year=1980 |access-date=June 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116203855/http://www.nicksfix.com/rs_issue310.htm |archive-date=January 16, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="nicksfix1997">{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/azrepub9.htm |title=Oh, Mother!&nbsp;– Fleetwood Mac's Stevie, 49, still Barbara's little girl |newspaper=Arizona Republic |author=Randy Cordova |date=October 21, 1997 |access-date=June 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/emin-your-dreamsem-docume_b_1937997.html |title=In Your Dreams Documentary Premieres at Hampton's: Chatting With Stevie Nicks |work=The Huffington Post |author=Mike Ragogna |year=2012 |access-date=July 8, 2013}}</ref> While attending [[Arcadia High School (California)|Arcadia High School]] in Arcadia, California,<ref>{{cite web|title=Stevie Nicks Story pg2 - Arcadia High School ROCK Legends|url=http://www.arcadiaapaches.com/memories/rock_history/stevie_nicks_story2.htm|website=Arcadiaapaches.com|access-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref> she joined her first band, the Changing Times, a [[folk rock]] group focused on vocal harmonies.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7qT3AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT132 |page=32 |title=Play On: Now, Then and Fleetwood Mac |last1=Fleetwood |first1=Mick |author-link=Mick Fleetwood |last2=Bozza |first2=Anthony | author-link2 = Anthony Bozza |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton |year=2014 |isbn=9781444753264 |quote=She briefly had a band called Changing Times, but her musical journey did not really begin until the family moved, yet again, to San Francisco.}}</ref>

He asked Nicks in mid-1967 to replace the lead singer. Fritz later opened for [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Janis Joplin]] from 1968 until 1970.

=== 1972–1978: Buckingham Nicks and Fleetwood Mac ===
After Fritz disbanded in 1972, Nicks and Buckingham continued to write as a duo, recording demo tapes at night in Daly City, California on a one-inch, four-track [[Ampex]] tape machine Buckingham kept at the coffee-roasting plant belonging to his father.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/rs103097.htm |title=Back on the Chain Gang |work=Rolling Stone |author=Fred Schruers |date=October 30, 1997 |access-date=June 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/music-lindsey-buckingham-two-worlds/366253 |title=Music: Lindsey Buckingham in Two Worlds |last=Jackson |first=Blair |date=February 1, 2011 |journal=[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]]}}</ref> They secured a deal with [[Polydor Records]], and the eponymous ''[[Buckingham Nicks]]'' was released in 1973. The album was not a commercial success and Polydor dropped the pair. With no money coming in from their album, and Buckingham contracting mononucleosis shortly thereafter, Nicks began working multiple jobs. She waited tables and cleaned producer [[Keith Olsen]]'s house, where Nicks and Buckingham lived for a time before moving in with [[Richard Dashut]].<ref name="nicksfix. com">{{cite web |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/behind_the_music.htm |title=Stevie Nicks&nbsp;– Behind the Music |website=Nicksfix.com |access-date=June 2, 2010}}</ref> She was soon experimenting with [[cocaine]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=132659&page=1 |title=Stevie Nicks in Her Own Words |publisher=ABC News |author=Cynthia McFadden |date=September 7, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130092902/http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=132659&page=1 |archive-date=January 30, 2011 |access-date=September 1, 2014}}</ref> "We were told that it was recreational and that it was not dangerous," Nicks told [[Chris Isaak]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Chris Isaak, Stevie Nicks |date=March 5, 2009 |title=The Chris Isaak Hour |medium=Television |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR0--gXpJEU |access-date=July 26, 2017|time=0:37 |publisher=[[The Biography Channel]]}}</ref>

While living with Dashut, Buckingham landed a guitar role with the [[Everly Brothers]] 1972 tour. Nicks stayed behind working on songwriting herself. During this time, Nicks wrote "[[Rhiannon (song)|Rhiannon]]" after seeing the name in the novel ''Triad'' by [[Mary Bartlet Leader|Mary Leader]]. She also wrote "[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]", inspired by the scenery of Aspen and her slowly deteriorating relationship with Buckingham.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/landslide.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on 'Landslide' |publisher=inherownwords.com |access-date=June 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://performingsongwriter.com/stevie-nicks-landslide/ |title=Stevie Nicks Tells the Story Behind 'Landslide' |publisher=performingsongwriter.com |access-date=February 3, 2014}}</ref>

In late 1974, Keith Olsen played the Buckingham Nicks track "Frozen Love" for drummer [[Mick Fleetwood]], who had come to [[Sound City Studios|Sound City]] in California in search of a recording studio. Fleetwood remembered Buckingham's guitar work when guitarist [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]] departed to pursue a solo career. On December 31, 1974, Fleetwood called Buckingham, inviting him to join the band. Buckingham refused, insisting that Nicks and he were "a package deal" and he would not join without her. The group decided that incorporating the pair would improve Fleetwood Mac, making the British band into an Anglo-American one. The first rehearsals confirmed this feeling, with the harmonies of the newcomers adding a pop accessibility to the band's former style of blues-based rock.

[[File:Stevie Nicks - 1977.jpg|thumb|upright|Nicks in 1977]]
In 1975, Fleetwood Mac achieved worldwide success with the album ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]''. Nicks's "[[Rhiannon (song)|Rhiannon]]" was voted one of [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] by ''Rolling Stone''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407 |title=500 Greatest Songs of All Time |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=September 30, 2012}}</ref> Her live performances of the song throughout the decade began to take on a theatrical intensity not present on the album. The song built to a climax in which Nicks's vocals were so impassioned that Mick Fleetwood declared, "her 'Rhiannon' in those days was like an exorcism."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/behind_the_music.htm |title=Stevie Nicks&nbsp;– Behind the Music |access-date=September 30, 2012}}</ref> "Landslide" became another hit from the album, with three million airplays.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20031104_stevie_nicks_wins_in_a_landslide_at_bmi_country_awards_jeffrey |title=Stevie Nicks Wins in a 'Landslide' at BMI Country Awards; Steele Named Songwriter of the Year |date=November 3, 2002 |access-date=September 30, 2012}}</ref>

Becoming aware of her image as a performer, Nicks worked with clothing designer Margi Kent to develop a unique onstage look. Her costumes had a gypsy-bohemian style that featured flowing skirts, shawls, and platform boots.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/latimes8.htm |title=Airy Godmother |work=Los Angeles Times |author=Booth Moore |date=October 23, 1997 |access-date=June 2, 2010}}</ref>

While Nicks and Buckingham achieved professional success with ''Fleetwood Mac'', their personal relationship was eroding. Nicks ended the relationship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/interview_chum_may6_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks Interview |publisher=CHUM Radio in Toronto |author=Marilyn Dennis |date=May 6, 2001 |access-date=June 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/lindsey2.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on Lindsey Buckingham |publisher=inherownwords.com |access-date=June 2, 2010}}</ref> Fleetwood Mac began recording their follow-up album, ''Rumours'', in early 1976 and continued until late in the year.

Among Nicks's contributions to ''Rumours'' was "[[Dreams (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dreams]]", which became the band's only [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one hit single. Nicks had also written and recorded the song "[[Silver Springs (song)|Silver Springs]]", but it was not included on the album because the early versions of the song ran too long, and the band didn't want too many slow songs on the album. Studio engineer and co-producer [[Ken Caillat]] said that Nicks was very unhappy to find that the band had decided against her song "Silver Springs", which he said was beautifully crafted, and carried some of the band's best guitar work.<ref name=Caillat>{{cite book |last1=Caillat |first1=Ken |last2=Stiefel |first2=Steve |title=Making Rumours the inside story of the classic Fleetwood Mac album |date=2012 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken, N.J. |isbn=978-1-118-28286-1 |pages=292–294 |oclc=775898199 }}</ref> "Silver Springs", written about her tumultuous relationship with Buckingham, was released as a B-side of the "[[Go Your Own Way]]" single—Buckingham's equally critical song about Nicks.<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/silver-springs-inside-fleetwood-macs-great-lost-breakup-anthem-201303/|title='Silver Springs': Inside Fleetwood Mac's Great Lost Breakup Anthem|first1=Brittany|last1=Spanos|date=August 17, 2017|access-date=January 10, 2020}}</ref> Copies of the single eventually became collectors' items among fans of Fleetwood Mac.

In November 1977, after a New Zealand concert for the ''Rumours'' tour, Nicks and Fleetwood secretly began an affair. Fleetwood was married to Jenny Boyd.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/rs103097.htm |title=Back on the Chain Gang |work=Rolling Stone |author=Fred Schruers |date=October 30, 1997 |access-date=June 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/timeline/timeline1970s.html |title=Fleetwood Mac Timeline for the 1970s |website=Fleetwoodmac-uk.com |access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref> "Never in a million years could you have told me that would happen," Nicks has stated.

[[File:Fleetwood Mac - Stevie Nicks (1980).png|thumb|upright|Nicks performing in 1980]]
After the success of the ''Rumours'' album and tour in 1977 to 1978, Fleetwood Mac began recording their third album with Nicks and Buckingham, ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'', in the spring of 1978. By this time, Nicks had amassed a large backlog of songs that she had been unable to record with Fleetwood Mac, because of the constraint of having to accommodate three songwriters on each album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nicksfix.com/behind_the_music.htm|title=Stevie Nicks&nbsp;– Behind the Music|access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref> ''Tusk'' was released on October 19, 1979.

=== Backup vocals and duets ===
While working on ''Tusk'', Nicks sang back-up on virtually every track of ''Not Shy'', recorded by musician [[Walter Egan]], a friend of both Nicks and Buckingham. "[[Magnet and Steel]]", inspired by Nicks, prominently featured her back-up vocals and became a hit single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart during the summer of 1978.<ref name="FMnet_PenguinQ&A_2">{{cite web

Nicks wrote and recorded demos for a solo project during ''Tusk'' sessions in 1979 and the ''Tusk'' world tour of 1979–80.<ref name="nicksfix1980" /> Nicks, Danny Goldberg, and Paul Fishkin founded [[Modern Records (1980)|Modern Records]] to record and release Nicks's material.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pzAdAAAAIBAJ&pg=5482%2C3389480 |title=The Tuscaloosa News&nbsp;– Google News Archive Search |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

Nicks's first solo album, ''[[Bella Donna (album)|Bella Donna]]'', was released on July 27, 1981, to critical and commercial acclaim, reaching number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart, with four singles making the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and ''Rolling Stone'' deeming her "the Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/bella-donna-mw0000191230/awards |title=Bella Donna |website=AllMusic |access-date=February 28, 2014}}</ref>

The day that ''Bella Donna'' reached number one on the ''Billboard'' 200, Nicks was told that her best friend Robin Anderson had leukemia. Anderson was pregnant at the time and given only three months to live. She gave birth to a son, appointing Nicks as the child's godmother. "I never got to enjoy ''Bella Donna'' at all because my friend was dying.

''Bella Donna'' introduced Nicks's permanent back-up singers, Sharon Celani and Lori Perry (now Nicks), who have contributed vocals to all of Nicks's solo albums since then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inherownwords.com/girls.htm|title=Stevie Nicks on the Girls: Sharon Celani & Lori Perry-Nicks|publisher=Inherownwords.com|access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> In November 1981, Nicks embarked on her ''White Winged Dove'' tour, which she had to cut short to record ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]''.

Nicks released her second solo album, ''[[The Wild Heart (album)|The Wild Heart]]'', on June 10, 1983. The album went double platinum, reached number five on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart, and featured three hit singles. It also introduced songwriter and performer [[Sandy Stewart (musician)|Sandy Stewart]] as co-writer and vocalist.

Nicks performed at the second [[US Festival]] at Glen Helen Regional Park in San Bernardino, California, and later [[The Wild Heart Tour|toured the U.S.]] from June 1983 to November 1983. Nicks appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in December 1983, performing "[[Stand Back]]" and "Nightbird".

Following the tour for ''The Wild Heart'', Nicks commenced work on her third solo album. Originally titled ''Mirror Mirror'', Nicks recorded songs for the album during 1984. However, Nicks was unhappy with the album, and opted to record a new batch of songs in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inherownwords.com/rockalit.htm|title=Stevie Nicks on 'Rock A Little'|website=inherownwords.com|access-date=June 2, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Rock a Little]]'', as it was retitled, was released November 18, 1985, to commercial success, supported by three successful singles. Nicks toured for ''Rock a Little'' until October 1986, and performed with [[Bob Dylan]] and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers during their tour in Australia.

The tour marked a turning point in Nicks's life. The January before the tour was to begin, a plastic surgeon warned her of severe health problems if she did not stop using cocaine.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Stevie Nicks: a survivor's story |first=Mick |last=Brown |date=September 8, 2007 |access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref> "I said, 'What do you think about my nose?'", she recalled on ''The Chris Isaak Hour'' in 2009. "And he said, 'Well, I think the next time you do a hit of cocaine, you could drop dead.'" At the end of the Australian tour, Nicks checked herself into the [[Betty Ford Center]] for 30 days to overcome her cocaine addiction.<ref name="youtube1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR0--gXpJEU|title=Stevie Nicks 2009 - The Chris Isaak Hour 4|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/article_dailynews_sep7_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks in Her Own Words |publisher=ABC News |author=Cynthia McFadden |date=September 7, 2001 |access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref> Recalling the strong influence of [[Janis Joplin]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] on her music and life, she told a UK interviewer, "I saw how they went down, and a part of me wanted to go down with them&nbsp;... but then another part of me thought, I would be very sad if some 25-year-old lady rock and roll singer ten years from now said, 'I wish Stevie Nicks would have thought about it a little more.'

Later that year, on the advice of friends concerned that she might relapse, she visited a psychiatrist who prescribed the sedative [[Clonazepam|Klonopin]] to help her remain free from cocaine.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nicksfix.com/interview_chum_may6_2001.htm |title=Toronto Interview |publisher=CHUM Radio |author=Marilyn Dennis |date=May 6, 2001 |access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref>

=== 1987–1990: ''Tango in the Night'', ''The Other Side of the Mirror'', and ''Behind the Mask'' ===
In late 1985, Fleetwood Mac began work on ''[[Tango in the Night]]'', but due to her promotional schedule for the ''Rock a Little'' album and subsequent tour, Nicks was mostly unavailable to work on the album with the band except for a few weeks following her stay at the Betty Ford Center in 1986 (which was the inspiration for the song "Welcome to the Room...Sara"). She sent the band demos of her songs to work on in her absence. The album was released in April 1987 and became the band's second-highest selling album ever, behind ''Rumours''.

Creative differences and unresolved personal issues within the band led Buckingham to quit the group right before their world tour. According to bassist [[John McVie]], a "physically ugly" confrontation between Nicks and Buckingham ensued when Nicks angrily challenged Buckingham's decision to leave the band.<ref name=FMart60>Sykes, Graham. ''Rock Family Trees Transcript''.</ref>

The band embarked on the ''Shake the Cage'' tour in September 1987, with Buckingham replaced by [[Rick Vito]] and [[Billy Burnette]]. The tour was suspended during Nicks's bout with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] and developing addiction to [[Clonazepam|Klonopin]], though it resumed in 1988. ''Tango in the Night'' met with commercial success and was followed in 1988 by Fleetwood Mac's ''[[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in November 1988.

Also in 1988, Nicks began work on a fourth solo album with English record producer [[Rupert Hine]]. ''[[The Other Side of the Mirror (album)|The Other Side of the Mirror]]'' was released on May 11, 1989, to commercial success. Nicks became romantically involved with Hine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/rooms.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on 'Rooms on Fire' |website=inherownwords.com |access-date=June 2, 2010}}</ref>

Nicks toured the U.S. and Europe from August to November 1989, the only time she has toured Europe as a solo act. She later said she had "no memory of this tour" because of her increasing dependency on Klonopin,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=231&c=11 |work=[[People (American magazine)|People]] |date=January 19, 1998 |title=High Priestess |author=Steve Dougherty, Todd Gold}}</ref> prescribed in ever increasing amounts by a psychiatrist between 1987 and 1994, in an attempt to keep Nicks from regressing to her former abuse of cocaine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.benzo.org.uk/nicks.htm|title=benzo.org.uk - Stevie Nicks: "Klonopin - more deadly than coke"|website=www.benzo.org.uk|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html|title=Stevie Nicks: a survivor's story|last=Brown|first=Mick|journal=Daily Telegraph|date=September 7, 2007|access-date=February 4, 2019|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

In 1989, Nicks set to work with Fleetwood Mac on ''[[Behind the Mask (album)|Behind the Mask]]'', released in 1990 to moderate commercial success in the U.S. In the UK, however, the album entered the chart at number one and was certified platinum. The band went on a world tour to promote the album, on the last night of which Buckingham and Nicks reunited on stage to perform "Landslide".<ref>{{cite news |title=Fleetwood Mac, Live at the Great Western Forum, Inglewood, California December 7th, 1990 |work=Rolling Stone |author=Steve Pond |date=February 7, 1991}}</ref> After the tour concluded, Nicks left the group over a dispute with Mick Fleetwood, who would not allow her to release the 1977 track "Silver Springs" on her album ''[[Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks]]'', because of his plans to save it for release on a forthcoming Fleetwood Mac box set.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/timeline/timeline1990s.html |title=Timeline 1990s |publisher=Go Your Own Way |access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref> Fleetwood knew that the song would be valuable as a selling point for the box set, since over the years, it had gained interest among the band's fans.<ref name=Furman2003 />

=== 1991–1996: ''Timespace'' and ''Street Angel'' ===
On the 10th anniversary of her solo career debut, Nicks released ''Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks'' on September 3, 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/stevie-nicks/discography/66977/ |title=Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks by Stevie Nicks |work=MTV Artists |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> The following year, Fleetwood Mac also released a four-disc box set, ''[[25 Years&nbsp;– The Chain]]'', which included "Silver Springs".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://louderthanwar.com/fleetwood-mac-25-years-the-chain-4-cd-box-set-warner-bros-records-inc/ |title=Fleetwood Mac: 25 Years, The Chain 4 CD box set review |work=Louder Than War |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

During the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign, [[Bill Clinton]] used the Fleetwood Mac hit "[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]" as his campaign theme song, and Nicks rejoined the classic ''Rumours'' line-up of the band (including Buckingham) to perform the song at Clinton's 1993 inaugural gala. No plans for an official reunion were made at that time. Nicks was criticized for her weight gain.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXNUWWuzscMC&q=clinton+inauguration+%22stevie+nicks%22+fat&pg=PA367 |title=Milk it!: collected musings on the ...&nbsp;– Google Books |access-date=January 9, 2011 |isbn=0-306-81271-1 |year=2003|last1=Derogatis |first1=Jim }}</ref> Nicks, who is {{convert|5|ft|1|in|m}}, had gained weight, peaking at 175&nbsp;lbs (79.4&nbsp;kg). "Klonopin was worse than the cocaine," she has said. "I lost those 8 years of my life. I didn't write, and I had gained so much weight."<ref name="youtube1" />

In late 1993, while Nicks held a baby shower at her house, she tripped over a box, passed out, and cut her forehead near a fireplace. "I'm one of those people who doesn't injure themselves. I was horrified to see that blood. I hadn't had enough wine. I knew it was the Klonopin," she said. Realizing that she needed help, Nicks endured a painful 47-day detox in a hospital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/article_us_weekly_june11_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks&nbsp;– Goes her own way |work=US Weekly |date=June 11–18, 2001 |access-date=October 5, 2011}}</ref>

Following her successful detox, Nicks released her fifth solo album, ''[[Street Angel (album)|Street Angel]]'', recorded during 1992 and 1993 using material written mostly in previous years. Released on May 23, 1994, ''Street Angel'' was poorly received, reaching number 45 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200. Nicks has since expressed major disappointment with the album, claiming that a lot of its production work took place during her second stint in rehab, meaning she had little or no say over the final product.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/article_msn_music_may_30_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks Talks To MSN Music |website=Nicksfix.com|access-date=February 28, 2014 |date=January 1999}}</ref> Despite a three-month tour in support of the album, Nicks was crushed by the focus on her weight and the poor reception of the album. Disgusted by the criticism she received during the tour for being overweight, she vowed to never set foot on a stage again unless she slimmed down.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stepko |first1=Barbara |title=Stevie Wonder |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/mccalls1.htm |website=Nicksfix.com|access-date=October 17, 2014 |date=May 25, 2001}}</ref>

In 1996, Nicks reunited with Lindsey Buckingham and contributed the duet "Twisted" to the ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' movie soundtrack, while in 1996, the [[Sheryl Crow]]-penned "Somebody Stand by Me" featured on the ''[[Boys on the Side]]'' soundtrack, and Nicks also remade Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'" for Fox's TV hit ''[[Party of Five]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://radio.com/2013/03/18/whenever-i-call-you-friend-stevie-nicks-greatest-collaborations/ |title=Whenever I Call You, Friend: Stevie Nicks' Greatest Collaborations " Radio.com |publisher=Radio.com |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010134628/http://radio.com/2013/03/18/whenever-i-call-you-friend-stevie-nicks-greatest-collaborations/ |archive-date=October 10, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/507970/party-of-five-soundtrack-due-in-96/ |title="Party of Five" Soundtrack Due in '96 |publisher=MTV News |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

=== 1997–2001: ''The Dance'', ''Enchanted'', and ''Trouble in Shangri-La'' ===
In 1996, Lindsey Buckingham, working on a planned solo album, enlisted the help of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, which eventually led to a reunion of the entire band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=5927&c=9 |title=The Blue Letter Archives |publisher=Bla.fleetwoodmac.net |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> A newly invigorated and slimmed-down Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac for ''The Dance'', a highly successful 1997 tour that coincided with the 20th anniversary of the release of ''Rumours''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Fj5OAAAAIBAJ&pg=6700%2C4141263 |title=Lakeland Ledger&nbsp;– Google News Archive Search |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> Prior to the tour, Nicks started work with a voice coach, to lend her voice more control and protect it from the stress of lengthy touring schedules.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2011/09/gold-dust-woman-a-qa-with-stevie-nicks/4/ |title=Gold Dust Woman: A Q&A With Stevie Nicks |work=American Songwriter |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/eonline.htm |title=Stevie Nicks interview |publisher=Rockalittle.com |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> She also went on a diet and started [[jogging]] to lose weight.<ref name="people.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20125232,00.html |title=Stevie Nicks: Rock Singer |work=People |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

The band's live CD ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'' was released to commercial and critical acclaim.

Nicks put work on a new solo album on hold when she was approached by [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]] to release a solo career-spanning box set, to finish her contract with [[Atlantic Records]] in the U.S. After the culmination of the Fleetwood Mac reunion tour, Nicks settled down in Los Angeles and Phoenix, Arizona with close friends and colleagues to devise a track list for this three-disc collection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/interv6.htm |title=Stevie Nicks Interview on KLOS |publisher=Rockalittle.com |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=302&c=11 |title=The Blue Letter Archives |publisher=Bla.fleetwood.net |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

The box set ''[[Enchanted (Stevie Nicks album)|Enchanted]]'' was released to acclaim on April 28, 1998, with liner notes from Nicks, as well as exclusive rare photographs, and pages from her journals. Nicks supported the box set with a successful U.S. tour. In 1998, Nicks contributed to the ''[[Practical Magic]]'' soundtrack and performed in Don Henley's benefit concert for the Walden Woods Project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockalittle.com/ew11.htm |title="Crystal" Mesh Sheryl Crow and Stevie Nicks invite EW to their first recording session|work=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Rockalittle.com |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/151513/bjork-joni-mitchell-reign-over-walden-woods-benefit/ |title=Bjork, Joni Mitchell Reign Over Walden Woods Benefit |publisher=MTV News |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

=== 2002–2009: ''Say You Will'', ''Crystal Visions'', and ''Soundstage Sessions'' ===
[[File:Stevie Nicks.jpg|left|thumb|Nicks during Fleetwood Mac's 2003 tour]]

In 2001, Fleetwood Mac began work on a new studio album, though this time without [[Christine McVie]], leaving Nicks as the sole woman in the band for the first time. After the end of her solo tour, Nicks convened with the other members of the band for recording during 2002.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

''[[Say You Will (album)|Say You Will]]'' was released in April 2003 and met with commercial success but mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/say-you-will/fleetwood-mac |title=Reviews for Say You Will by Fleetwood Mac |website=Metacritic |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogcritics.org/music-review-fleetwood-mac-say-you/ |title=Music Review: Fleetwood Mac&nbsp;– Say You Will |work=Blogcritics |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> Nicks joined the group to support the album with a world tour lasting until September 2004.

She has subsequently stated in several interviews that she was not happy with the album or the successful world tour that followed, citing production disputes with Buckingham as a core factor, as well as the absence of fellow female band member Christine McVie.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/a-magical-life/2006/02/09/1139465789637.html?page=fullpage |title=A magical life&nbsp;– Music&nbsp;– Entertainment |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |date=February 12, 2006 |access-date=January 9, 2011 |first=Guy |last=Blackman}}</ref> A documentary of the making of the album, ''Destiny Rules'', was released on DVD in 2004 and chronicles the sometimes-turbulent relationships between band members, especially Buckingham and Nicks, during that time in the studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/sep/10/dvdreviews.shopping |title=Pop DVD: Fleetwood Mac, Destiny Rules&nbsp;– Music |work=The Guardian |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

After a few months' respite from the ''Say You Will'' tour, Nicks did a four-night stint in May 2005 at [[Caesars Palace]] in Las Vegas, and then did 10 shows with Don Henley dubbed the ''Two Voices'' tour. During the summer of 2005, Nicks continued doing solo shows (''Gold Dust'' tour) with pop singer [[Vanessa Carlton]] as the opening act, playing over 20 dates nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=1077&c=11|title=The Blue Letter Archives|publisher=Bla.fleetwoodmac.net|access-date=December 21, 2014}}</ref>

On March 27, 2007, [[Reprise Records]] released ''[[Crystal Visions&nbsp;– The Very Best of Stevie Nicks]]'' in the U.S. The album debuted at number 21 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1053163/mcgraw-leads-seven-top-10-debuts-onto-billboard-200 |title=McGraw Leads Seven Top 10 Debuts Onto Billboard 200 |date=April 4, 2007 |work=Billboard |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

The compilation includes her hit singles, a dance remix, and one new track, a live version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]". Two versions of this album were made, one with just the audio CD and a deluxe version which includes a DVD featuring all of Nicks's music videos with audio commentary from Nicks herself, as well as rare footage from the ''Bella Donna'' recording sessions.

A tour with [[Chris Isaak]], opening in Concord, California on May 17, 2007, supported the release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://casinoconnectionac.com/issue/june_2007/article/bella_donna |title=Bella Donna -Bella Donna&nbsp;– Casino Connection Atlantic City |publisher=Casinoconnectionac.com |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/04/stevie-nicks-to-join-chris-isaak-on-tour.html |title=Stevie Nicks To Join Chris Isaak on Tour |work=Paste |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

Reprise Records initially released two radio-only promos, the live version of "Landslide" with the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]] and "Rock and Roll". Both tracks failed to garner much airplay and made no impact on the charts. Reprise Records released "[[Stand Back#Re-releases|Stand Back]]" (issued with club mixes) on May 29, 2007. "Stand Back", which peaked at number five on the pop singles chart in 1983, reached number two on the ''Billboard'' Club chart. Nicks previously reached number one on this chart, with "Planets of the Universe" (from ''Trouble in Shangri-La'') in 2001. The remix single of "Stand Back" debuted on the ''Billboard'' Hot Singles Sales chart on September 15, 2007, at number 10, peaking at number four the following week. It also debuted on the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Singles Sales chart at number three, later peaking at number one .

On March 31, 2009, Nicks released the album, ''[[The Soundstage Sessions]]'', via Reprise Records. The album debuted at number 47 on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart. The first single from the album, "[[Crash Into Me#Stevie Nicks version|Crash into Me]]", was released as a digital download, along with "Landslide" (orchestra version) as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], on March 17, 2009.

In late 2008, Fleetwood Mac announced that the band would tour in 2009, beginning in March. As per the 2003–2004 tour, Christine McVie would not be featured in the line-up. The tour was branded as a 'greatest hits' show titled "Unleashed", although they played album tracks such as "Storms" and "I Know I'm Not Wrong".

=== 2010–2013: ''In Your Dreams'' and Extended Play Tour ===
[[File:Stevie Nicks Performing.jpg|thumb|Nicks performing with Dave Stewart in November 2011]]

After completing the ''Unleashed'' tour with Fleetwood Mac, Nicks began work on her first solo album in a decade with [[David A. Stewart]], a musician and record producer best known for being one half of the duo [[Eurythmics]].

Nicks performed in a series of shows in August 2010 ("it's not really a tour", she said). They did not contain any of her new music, because she did not want it to end up on YouTube. The Santa Barbara show benefited a young girl she had met through the Make-a-Wish Foundation in Los Angeles with rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare cancer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.com/news/2010/jul/26/stevie-nicks-looking-back-charging-forward-new-alb/ |title=Stevie Nicks Is Looking Back, Charging Forward on New Album |date=July 26, 2010 |work=Santa Barbara Independent |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

On January 13, 2011, Reprise announced Nicks's upcoming album ''[[In Your Dreams (Stevie Nicks album)|In Your Dreams]]'' would be released on May 3, and the lead single, "[[Secret Love (Stevie Nicks song)|Secret Love]]", would be released on February 8. Reprise provided a free download of the single to fans who ordered the album via certain websites. Nicks originally wrote "Secret Love" in 1976 and recorded a demo of it for Fleetwood Mac's 1977 album, ''Rumours''. It did not make the final cut for the album. The demo version had been circulating among fans for many years prior to its inclusion on ''In Your Dreams''. Nicks promoted the song with a video directed by Dave Stewart. Nicks's goddaughter Kelly appears in the video wearing a vintage dress that Nicks wore on stage in 1976. According to Nicks, Kelly portrays the young Nicks blending with the soul of Nicks's 62-year-old self.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=46793 |title=PrideSource&nbsp;– Stevie Nicks talks gays, 'Glee' controversy and losing weight&nbsp;... with her own music? |work=Pridesource |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> On the U.S. [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], "Secret Love" was a modest hit on the Adult Contemporary Singles chart, peaking at number 20, and at number 25 on the Triple-A Singles chart.

Nicks has said that her vocal style and performance antics evolved from female singers like [[Grace Slick]] and [[Janis Joplin]]. She admitted inspiration when she saw Joplin perform live (and opened for her with her first band Fritz) shortly before Joplin's death. Nicks owns a strand of Joplin's stage beads. She also commented that she once saw a woman in her audience dressed in dripping chiffon with a [[Gibson Girl]] hairstyle and big boots, and Nicks knew she wanted something similar.

=== Philanthropy ===
Nicks has started a charity foundation titled "Stevie Nicks' Band of Soldiers" which is used for the benefit of wounded military personnel.<ref name=SNBOF>Andrew Gumbel.

In late 2004, Nicks began visiting Army and Navy medical centers in Washington, D.C. While visiting wounded service men and women, she became determined to find an object she could leave with the soldiers that would raise their spirits, motivate, and give them something to look forward to each day. She eventually decided to purchase hundreds of iPod Nanos, load them with music, artists, and playlists which she would hand select, and autograph them:<ref name=troops>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/journal_visiting_troops.htm |title=Stevie's Journal Entries Regarding Visits to the Injured Troops |publisher=The Nicks Fix |access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref>

{{Quote|I call it a soldiers' iPod. It has all the crazy stuff that I listen to, and my collections I've been making since the 1970s for going on the road, when I'm sick&nbsp;... or the couple of times in my life that I have really been down, music is what always dances me out of bed.|source=Stevie Nicks, ''[[The Arizona Republic]].}}

She now regularly delivers these tokens of her appreciation, bringing her closest friends, such as Mick Fleetwood, along to share the experience:<ref name=troops />

{{Quote|So, as Mick [Fleetwood] and I went from room to room delivering their tiny iPod, they told us their stories. Mick became his tall, loving, father figure, English self, taking in every word they said, remaining calm (at least on the outside) inspiring them. We floated from room to room down through the halls of the two hospitals over a three-day period. We gave out all our iPods. Right before I left for DC, [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] dug into their pockets and came up with $10,000 for me. In my eyes they went from the coolest rock stars to generous great men; as my press agent Liz Rosenberg said, every returning wounded soldier should be given an iPod.

=== Style ===
Nicks's style has remained the same throughout her years in the spotlight and even "at 60 she is still working the gossamer tunics and shawls that have influenced two generations of Stevie acolytes, and given her performances the feel of a Wiccan ritual" writes ''New York Times'' reporter Ruth La Ferla.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/fashion/09STEVIE.html |title=Still Dressing for Stevie |newspaper=New York Times|access-date=July 20, 2015}}</ref> Nicks has been known for her multiple wardrobe changes during live performances, almost having a new outfit for each song she sang. The cost to keep up her overall style, of hair, makeup, and wardrobe, was not cheap. Nicks filed tax deductible expenses in 1991 costing "$12,495 for makeup and hairstyling [and] $43,291 for professional clothing and maintenance".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/may99butcher.html|title=Tax Treatment of Leisure Accoutrements|publisher=American Bar Association|access-date=July 20, 2015}}</ref> Nicks sings about the store where her iconic style all started in the song "Gypsy" on Fleetwood Mac's 13th studio album "Mirage", released in 1982. In the song, Nicks sings of a store called the Velvet Underground, a boutique in San Francisco, California where famous rockers like Janis Joplin and Grace Slick were known to shop.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/gypsy_velvet_popup.html|title=Stevie Nicks on Gypsy|publisher=In Her Own Words|access-date=November 15, 2017}}</ref> It was at the Velvet Underground where Nicks' unique and easily recognizable style began.

The Dixie Chicks covered "Landslide", which became a top-10 hit (number one on the Adult Contemporary chart) and a number one hit on the Country chart. This cover also earned her a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Songwriters Award in 2003 when it won Song of the Year (the award is given to the songwriter of the track, regardless of the performer). According to BMI, "Landslide" also earned Nicks the 35th Robert J. Burton Award as "Most Performed Country Song of the Year". This distinction is given to the song tallying the most feature U.S. broadcast performances during the eligibility period. Included on the Dixie Chicks' platinum Monument album ''Home'', "Landslide" was a Country, Adult Top 40, Hot 100 and AC ''Billboard'' charts smash.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/233884 |title=Stevie Nicks Wins in a 'Landslide' at BMI Country Awards |publisher=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] |date=November 3, 2003 |access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref> Alternative rock band [[the Smashing Pumpkins]] made an acoustic cover of the song that was featured on their 1994 B-side collection ''Pisces Iscariot''.

Other successful covers have included [[the Corrs]]' "Dreams" and [[Courtney Love]]'s band [[Hole (band)|Hole]] with "Gold Dust Woman". "[[Edge of Seventeen]]" was sampled on [[Destiny's Child]]'s 2001 number one single "[[Bootylicious]]". Nicks appeared in the video for "Bootylicious" and in an episode of MTV's ''[[Making The Video]]'' that featured it, in which she expressed her admiration for both the song and the group. Also, American actress and singer [[Lindsay Lohan]] covered "[[Edge of Seventeen]]" on her second studio album ''[[A Little More Personal (Raw)]]'' (2005). [[Deep Dish (band)|Deep Dish]] fulfilled their "Dreams" of working with Nicks in 2005 when Nicks offered to re-record vocals on a remix of her number-one penned song, "[[Dreams (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dreams]]". The Deep Dish version went on to reach number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Airplay chart, as well as providing Nicks with her third UK top-40 hit. Nicks provided additional vocals and writing on Vanessa Carlton's 2007 album, ''Heroes and Thieves''.

On January 31, 2010, Nicks performed with [[Taylor Swift]] at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]]. Swift, who describes Nicks as one of her childhood heroes, introduced her to the audience by saying, "It's a fairy tale and an honor to share the stage with Stevie Nicks."<ref>{{cite web |last=Ditzian |first=Eric |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1630891/20100131/swift__taylor.jhtml |title=Taylor Swift Shares The Stage With Stevie Nicks at the Grammys |publisher=MTV |date=January 31, 2010 |access-date=January 9, 2011}}</ref>

In October 2018, Nicks was one of fifteen artists to be nominated for induction to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. On December 13, 2018, she was announced as one of seven inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame class of 2019, making her the first woman to be inducted twice to the hall.

== Personal life ==
Nicks' only marriage was to Kim Anderson, the widower of her friend Robin Anderson. They married in 1983 soon after Robin Anderson died of leukemia and while the ''Bella Donna'' album was on the top of the charts. "I was determined to take care of [Robin's] baby, so I said to Kim, 'I don't know, I guess we should just get married.'" Nicks and Anderson divorced after only three months: "We didn't get married because we were in love, we got married because we were grieving and it was the only way that we could feel like we were doing anything."<ref name="robin" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/article_in_style_march2002.htm |title=Desert Rose |publisher=In Style |author=Stephanie Tuck |date=March 2002 |access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref> Years after their divorce, she reunited with her stepson when he was a teenager, putting him through college,<ref name=SurvivorsStory>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |title=Stevie Nicks: A Survivor's Story|author= Brown, Mick |date=September 8, 2007 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=July 4, 2014}}</ref> and she has maintained contact with him ever since.

Nicks had been romantically linked to Lindsey Buckingham since 1966, briefly to Mick Fleetwood in 1977, [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] drummer/vocalist [[Don Henley]] during the late 1970s, and briefly to Eagles songwriter [[J.D. Souther]].<ref>Furman 2003.

Nicks has said that she consciously chose not to have children of her own, due to her demanding career and desire to follow her art wherever it should take her: "My mission maybe wasn't to be a mom and a wife; maybe my particular mission was to write songs to make moms and wives feel better."<ref>Stevie Nicks on ABC Downtown, 2001.</ref> Of her niece, godchildren, and extended family she says: "I have lots of kids.

Nicks has maintained a journal nearly every day since her tenure in Fleetwood Mac began.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.more.com/stevie-nicks |title=Stevie Nicks on Loss, Love, and What She Wears |publisher=More |author=Holly-George Warren |access-date=February 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221113304/http://www.more.com/stevie-nicks |archive-date=February 21, 2014 }}</ref> "I like to tell all my fairy goddaughters and my niece that when I'm gone they can sit on the floor and go through all these journals, and they can walk through my life, and they can smell the gardenia perfume on the pages. They can have it in their hands, who I was." Regarding a book based on her life, she has said, "I wouldn't write a book unless I could really tell the truth, and say all the people are in it are represented right&nbsp;... If I'm gonna talk about all the people in my life, I need to be old enough and so do they, that nobody's gonna care&nbsp;... I would never write a book about the bad parts. I would mostly revel in the fantastic parts, of which there were so many."<ref name=drew /> Writing in her journal in 2020, Nicks blasted the US response to [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID–19]], comparing it to ''[[American Horror Story]]''. "Everyone gathering at the beaches, in the bars, block parties, et cetera—'let's get drunk and make out and, by the way, can I have the other half of your drink?'—we are heading for a crash; people are dying because people aren't wearing their masks.&nbsp;... Nobody is leading us. Nobody has a plan."<ref>{{cite tweet|author=Stevie Nicks|user=StevieNicks|number=1293322603948638208|date=August 10, 2020|title=We still have our freedom, but we don't have much time}}</ref>

In early 2007, reports surfaced concerning [[Lindsay Lohan]]'s interest in buying the rights to Nicks's life story and developing a motion picture in which she planned to play her. In March 2007, while promoting her album ''Crystal Visions'', Nicks was asked about this rumor. She told ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', "That is completely insane and crazy. There is no movie in the works on my life. Nobody can do a movie about my life without me being involved, because nobody knows what really happened in my life until I tell them. So, nobody can make a movie about my life. And if anybody ever went and made a movie about my life without my permission and my being involved, I would slam it so hard to the press that it would never do anything."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycVwQKjsU44#t=5m |title=Stevie Nicks interview&nbsp;— Access Hollywood |work=YouTube |access-date=October 17, 2014}}</ref> In 2009, she told ''The New York Times'' about Lohan, "Over my dead body.

Until July 2007, Nicks lived in Paradise Valley, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, in a home she had built in 1981 and shared with her brother Christopher Nicks, his wife Lori Perry-Nicks and their daughter Jessica. She announced in mid-2007 that her Paradise Valley home would be put up for sale, citing her aspirations to "downsize" and focus more on her charity work, and that in the previous year she had only "spent about two weeks there". The house was put on the market for a reported $3.8 million and later sold for $3 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2008/01/14/story5.html |title=The Insider: Stevie Nicks sells home in Paradise Valley |work=Phoenix Business Journal |date=January 2008 |access-date=September 16, 2013}}</ref>

In October 2005, Nicks attended the Melbourne Cup Week in Australia, and one of the horse-racing stakes was named after her: The Stevie Nicks Plate. She used this opportunity to launch her promotion of an Australian/New Zealand extension to her ''Gold Dust'' tour in February and March 2006. Nicks toured in Australia and New Zealand with popular Australian performer [[John Farnham]].<ref>By Sharon Krum, Women's Weekly, December 2005.</ref> She also appeared in concert with Tom Petty in June near [[Manassas, Virginia]], and at the [[Bonnaroo]] Music Festival that same month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmlegacy.com/concertssn2006.html |title=The 2006 Stevie Shows |publisher=fmlegacy.com |access-date=June 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510061151/http://www.fmlegacy.com/concertssn2006.html |archive-date=May 10, 2009 }}</ref>

In 2006, Nicks performed with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers for the first leg of their tour in the summer, and later in the year returned as a guest performer for a number of songs on the tour celebrating Petty's 30th anniversary since his debut album.

Nicks was also the featured performer for [[Bette Midler]]'s benefit function, Hulaween, in October 2006.<ref>[[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]], 'HULAWEEN' SUCCESS&nbsp;– New York Post, November 2, 2006.</ref>

Beginning in May 2007, Nicks began touring with pop/rock artist Chris Isaak. The last Stevie Nicks/Chris Isaak show was June 17, 2007, at the [[Comcast Center for the Performing Arts|Tweeter Center]] in Boston. Nicks continued the tour solo, with Vanessa Carlton opening on some dates. The tour finished at [[The Borgata]] in Atlantic City, New Jersey on August 24, 2007.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In 2008, Nicks embarked on the ''Soundstage Sessions'' tour in the U.S. A video recording of one concert date was released in 2009: ''[[Live in Chicago (Stevie Nicks video)|Live in Chicago]]''. Vanessa Carlton performed as a guest artist.

In 2009, Fleetwood Mac embarked on a global hits tour. The ''Unleashed'' tour took place in arenas on multiple continents. The tour ended in December with two sell-out shows of 35,000 people at the New Plymouth TSB Bowl of Brooklands in New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
