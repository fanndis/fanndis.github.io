{{SCOTUS series}}
The '''demographics of the Supreme Court of the United States''' encompass the [[gender]], [[ethnicity]], and religious, geographic, and economic backgrounds of the 115 people who have been appointed and confirmed as justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Some of these characteristics have been raised as an issue since the Court was established in 1789. For its first 180 years, justices were almost always [[White people|white]] [[Man|male]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] of [[White Anglo Saxon Protestant|Anglo]] or [[Northwestern Europe]]an descent.<ref name="SegalSpaeth2002_p183">{{cite book

|title=The Supreme Court and the Attitudinal Model Revisited|page=183}}</ref>

Prior to the 20th century, a few [[Catholics]] were appointed, but concerns about diversity of the Court were mainly in terms of geographic diversity, to represent all [[Regionalism (politics)|geographic regions]] of the country, as opposed to ethnic, religious, or gender diversity.<ref name=obrien46>{{cite book|last=[[#OBrien2003|O'Brien]]|title=Storm Center |year=2003 |page=46}}</ref> The 20th century saw the first appointment of justices who were [[Judaism|Jewish]] ([[Louis Brandeis]], 1916), [[African-American]] ([[Thurgood Marshall]], 1967), female ([[Sandra Day O'Connor]], 1981), and [[Italian-American]] ([[Antonin Scalia]], 1986). The first appointment of a [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] justice was in the 21st century  with [[Sonia Sotomayor]] in 2009, with the possible exception of justice [[Benjamin Cardozo]], a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jew]] of Portuguese descent, who was appointed in 1932.

In spite of the interest in the Court's demographics and the symbolism accompanying the inevitably political appointment process,<ref name=obrien54>{{cite book|last=[[#OBrien2003|O'Brien]]
|title=Storm Center|year=2003|page=54}}</ref> and the views of some commentators that no demographic considerations should arise in the selection process,<ref name="McIver">[http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/perry.htm John P.

For example, the opinions of the two African-American justices have reflected radically different judicial philosophies; [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]] and [[Antonin Scalia]] shared Catholic faith and a [[Harvard Law School]] education, but shared little in the way of jurisprudential philosophies. The court's first two female justices voted together no more often than with their male colleagues, and historian Thomas R. Marshall writes that no particular "female perspective" can be discerned from their opinions.<ref name=marshall-109>{{cite book |last=[[#Marshall2008|Marshall]]|title=Public Opinion and the Rehnquist Court|year=2008|page=109}}</ref>

==Geographic background==
For most of the existence of the Court, geographic diversity was a key concern of presidents in choosing justices to appoint.<ref name=obrien46/> This was prompted in part by the early practice of Supreme Court justices also "riding circuit"—individually hearing cases in different regions of the country. In 1789, the United States was divided into judicial circuits, and from that time until 1891, Supreme Court justices also acted as judges within those individual circuits.<ref name="segalspaeth182">{{cite book|last=[[#SegalSpaeth2002|Segal and Spaeth]] |title=The Supreme Court and the Attitudinal Model Revisited'' |year=2002|page=182}}</ref> [[George Washington]] was careful to make appointments "with no two justices serving at the same time hailing from the same state".<ref name=Marshall2008_p108>{{cite book|last=[[#Marshall2008|Marshall]]|title=Public Opinion and the Rehnquist Court|year=2008 |page=108}}</ref> [[Abraham Lincoln]] broke with this tradition during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]],<ref name="segalspaeth182"/> and "by the late 1880s presidents disregarded it with increasing frequency".<ref name=SegalSpaeth2002_p182_quote>[[#SegalSpaeth2002|Segal and Spaeth]] (2002), quoting Richard Friedman, "The Transformation in Senate Response to Supreme Court Nominations", 5 Cardozo Law Review 1 (1983), p. 50.</ref>

Although the importance of regionalism declined, it still arose from time to time. For example, in appointing [[Benjamin Cardozo]] in 1929, President Hoover was as concerned about the controversy over having three [[New York (state)|New York]] justices on the Court as he was about having two Jewish justices.<ref name=SegalSpaeth_p182-3>{{cite book|last=[[#SegalSpaeth2002|Segal and Spaeth]]|title=The Supreme Court and the Attitudinal Model Revisited |year=2002|pages=182–83}}</ref> David M. O'Brien notes that "[f]rom the appointment of [[John Rutledge]] from [[South Carolina]] in 1789 until the retirement of [[Hugo Black]] [from [[Alabama]]] in 1971, with the exception of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] decade of 1866–1876, there was always a southerner on the bench. Until 1867, the sixth seat was reserved as the “southern seat”. Until Cardozo's appointment in 1932, the third seat was reserved for [[New England]]ers."<ref name=obrien46-47>{{cite book

[[File:DJBrewer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Josiah Brewer]] was born to [[missionary]] parents in [[Smyrna]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]], (now [[İzmir]], [[Turkey]]).]]
Geographic balance was sought in the 1970s, when [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] attempted to employ a "Southern strategy", hoping to secure support from Southern states by nominating judges from the region.<ref name="SegalSpaeth2002_p183"/> Nixon unsuccessfully nominated Southerners [[Clement Haynsworth]] of [[South Carolina]], [[G. Harrold Carswell]] of [[Florida]] and [[Herschel Friday]] of [[Arkansas]], before finally succeeding with the nomination of [[Harry Blackmun]] of [[Minnesota]].<ref name=obrien48>{{cite book|last=[[#OBrien2003|O'Brien]]|title=Storm Center|year=2003 |page=48}}</ref>  The issue of regional diversity was again raised  with the 2010 retirement of John Paul Stevens, who had been appointed from the midwestern Seventh Circuit, leaving the Court with all but one Justice having been appointed from states on the East Coast.<ref>Mark Sherman, [https://www.nbcnews.com/id/36890869 Is Supreme Court in need of regional diversity?] (May 1, 2010).</ref>

{{As of|2020}}, the Court has a majority from the Northeastern United States, with five justices coming from states to the north and east of [[Washington, D.C.]]: three justices born in New York (two in New York City), one in New Jersey, and one from Washington D.C. itself. The remaining four justices come from Georgia, California, Colorado, and Indiana; until the appointment of [[Amy Coney Barrett]] of Indiana in 2020, the most recent justice from [[Midwestern United States|the Midwest]] had been [[John Paul Stevens]] of Illinois who retired in 2010. Contemporary Justices may be associated with multiple states. Many nominees are appointed while serving in states or districts other than their hometown or home state. Chief Justice John Roberts, for example, was born in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]], but moved to [[Indiana]] at the age of five, where he grew up. After law school, Roberts worked in [[Washington, D.C.]] while living in [[Maryland]]. Thus, three states may claim to be his home state. Justice Barrett is another example; although her commission identifies her as being from Indiana, she was born in [[New Orleans]], raised in the adjacent suburb of [[Metairie, Louisiana]], and did not live in Indiana until [[Notre Dame Law School|law school]].

Some states have been over-represented, partly because there were fewer states from which early justices could be appointed. New York has produced fifteen justices, three of whom have served as chief justice. [[Ohio]] has produced ten justices, including two chief justices; [[Massachusetts]] nine (including Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan); and [[Virginia]] eight, including three chief justices. There have been six justices each from [[Pennsylvania]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Maryland]] (the latter including current chief justice John Roberts and current associate justice Brett Kavanaugh); and five each from [[Kentucky]] and [[New Jersey]].<ref name=obrien48/> States that have produced four justices include California, Illinois (one chief and three associates each), and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

A handful of justices were born outside the United States, mostly from among the earliest justices on the Court. These included [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], born in [[Fife]], Scotland; [[James Iredell]], born in [[Lewes]], England; and [[William Paterson (judge)|William Paterson]], born in [[County Antrim]], Ireland. Justice [[David Josiah Brewer]] was born farthest from the U.S., in [[Smyrna]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]], (now [[İzmir]], [[Turkey]]), where his parents were missionaries at the time. [[George Sutherland]] was born in [[Buckinghamshire]], England. The last foreign-born Justice, and the only one of these for whom English was a second language, was [[Felix Frankfurter]], born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].<ref>Kermit Hall, James W. Ely, Joel B. Grossman, ''The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States'' (2005), p. 710; all other foreign born justices were born in English-speaking countries, except Brewer, who moved from Turkey to the United States while still in his infancy.</ref> The Constitution imposes no [[United States nationality law|citizenship]] requirement on federal judges.

===Other states producing justices===
* Connecticut has produced 3 justices (2 chiefs and 1 associate).
* South Carolina has produced 3 justices (1 chief, 1 chief who was earlier an associate, and 1 associate).
* Alabama has produced 3 associate justices.
* Colorado has produced 2 associate justices, including current associate justice Neil Gorsuch.
* Arizona has produced 2 associate justices, 1 of whom would later become a chief justice, but had moved from Arizona to Virginia (William Rehnquist).
* Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Hampshire have each produced 2 associate justices.
* Louisiana has produced 1 justice who served both as an associate and as chief.
* Kansas, Maine, Missouri, Mississippi, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming have each produced 1 associate justice.

===States producing no justices===
Despite the efforts to achieve geographic balance, only seven justices{{efn|[[David Josiah Brewer]] from Kansas; [[Byron White]] and [[Neil Gorsuch]] from Colorado; [[Willis Van Devanter]] from Wyoming; [[George Sutherland]] from Utah and [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] and [[William Rehnquist]] from Arizona}} have ever hailed from states admitted after or during [[American Civil War|the Civil War]]. Nineteen states have never produced a Supreme Court Justice; in chronological order of admission to the Union these are:

==Ethnicity==
[[File:LBJ Marshall-close.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thurgood Marshall]], the first African American Justice, speaking with his appointing President, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].]]
All Supreme Court justices were [[White Americans|white]] and of European heritage until the appointment of [[Thurgood Marshall]], the first [[African American]] Justice, in 1967. Since then, only two other non-white Justices have been appointed, Marshall's African-American successor, [[Clarence Thomas]] in 1991, and Latina Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] in 2009.

===Foreign birth===
There have been six foreign-born justices in the Court's history: [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]] (1789-1798), born in [[Ceres, Fife|Caskardy]], [[Scotland]]; [[James Iredell]] (1790-1799), born in [[Lewes]], [[England]]; [[William Paterson (judge)|William Paterson]] (1793-1806), born in [[County Antrim]], [[Ireland]]; [[David Josiah Brewer|David Brewer]] (1889-1910), born to American missionary parents in [[Smyrna]], [[Ottoman Empire]] (now [[İzmir]], [[Turkey]]);<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McAllister|first1=Stephen R.|title=The Kansas Justice, David Josiah Brewer|journal=[[The Green Bag (1997)|The Green Bag]]|date=Autumn 2015|volume=19|issue=1|page=37|url=http://www.greenbag.org/v19n1/v19n1_articles_mcallister.pdf|access-date=June 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219111550/http://www.greenbag.org/v19n1/v19n1_articles_mcallister.pdf|archive-date=December 19, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> [[George Sutherland]] (1922-1939), born in [[Buckinghamshire]], England; and [[Felix Frankfurter]] (1939-1962), born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].<ref name="SCOTUS FAQ">{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/faq_justices.aspx#faqjustice12|publisher=Supreme Court of the United States|access-date=May 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320120356/https://www.supremecourt.gov/faq_justices.aspx#faqjustice12|archive-date=March 20, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===White justices===
The vast majority of white justices have been [[Protestants]] of [[Northern Europe]]an, [[Northwestern Europe]]an, or [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic]] descent. There have been several justices of [[Irish-American|Irish]] or [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Irish]] descent, with [[William Paterson (judge)|William Paterson]] born in Ireland to an [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] Protestant family and [[Joseph McKenna]], [[Edward Douglas White]], [[Pierce Butler (justice)|Pierce Butler]], [[Frank Murphy]], [[William J. Brennan Jr.]], [[Anthony Kennedy]], and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] being of [[Irish Catholic]] origin.  Up until the 1980s, only six justices of "central, eastern, or southern European derivation" had been appointed, and even among these six justices, five of them "were of Germanic background, which includes Austrian, German-Bohemian, and Swiss origins ([[John Catron]], [[Samuel Freeman Miller|Samuel F. Miller]], [[Louis Brandeis]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], and [[Warren Burger]])", with Brandeis and Frankfurter being of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, while only one justice was of non-Germanic, Southern European descent ([[Benjamin N. Cardozo]], of [[Sephardic Jewish]] descent).<ref name="Schmidhauser">John Richard Schmidhauser, ''Judges and justices: the Federal Appellate Judiciary'' (1979), p. 60.</ref> Cardozo, appointed to the Court in 1932, was the first justice known to have non-Germanic, non-Anglo-Saxon or non-Irish ancestry and the first justice of [[Southern European]] descent.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}. Both of Justice Cardozo's parents descended from [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jews]] from the Iberian Peninsula who fled to Holland during the [[Spanish Inquisition]] then to London, before arriving in New York prior to the American Revolution.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kaufman|first1=Andrew L.|title=Cardozo|date=1998|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0674096452|edition=First|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/cardozo00kauf|access-date=June 18, 2017|chapter=1. Cardozo’s Heritage: The Sephardim and Tammany Hall|quote=The family into which Benjamin Nathan Cardozo was born ... was a Sephardic family, descended from those Jews who had fled from the Iberian peninsula during the Inquisition and had come to America via the Netherlands and England. Both branches of the family (the Cardozos and the Nathans) had arrived in the American colonies before the American Revolution. Cardozo family tradition holds that their ancestors were Portuguese Marranos--Jews who practiced Judaism secretly after forced conversion to Christianity--who fled the Inquisition in the seventeenth century. They took refuge first in Holland and then in London. Later members of the family emigrated to the New World.

===African American justices===
No African-American candidate was given serious consideration for appointment to the Supreme Court until the election of [[John F. Kennedy]], who weighed the possibility of appointing [[William H. Hastie]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]].<ref name="Goldman">Sheldon Goldman, ''Picking Federal Judges: Lower Court Selection from Roosevelt Through Reagan'' (1999), p. 184-85. {{ISBN|0-300-08073-5}}</ref> Hastie had been the first African-American elevated to a Court of Appeals when [[Harry S. Truman]] had so appointed him in 1949, and by the time of the Kennedy Administration, it was widely anticipated that Hastie might be appointed to the Supreme Court.<ref>"What Negroes can expect from Kennedy", ''[[Ebony Magazine]]''(Jan 1961), v. 16, no. 3, p. 33.</ref> That Kennedy gave serious consideration to making this appointment "represented the first time in American history that an African American was an actual contender for the high court".<ref name="Goldman"/>

The first African American appointed to the Court was [[Thurgood Marshall]], appointed by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in 1967. Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice [[Tom C. Clark]], saying that this was "the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place." Marshall was [[Nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States|confirmed]] as an Associate Justice by a [[United States Senate|Senate]] vote of 69–11 on August 31, 1967.<ref>Graham, Fred P. (August 31, 1967) [https://www.nytimes.com/1967/08/31/archives/senate-confirms-marshall-as-the-first-negro-justice-10-southerners.html ''Senate Confirms Marshall As the First Negro Justice; 10 Southerners Oppose High Court Nominee in 69-to-11 Vote''.]  ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> Johnson confidently predicted to one biographer, [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]], that a lot of black baby boys would be named "Thurgood" in honor of this choice (in fact, Kearns's research of birth records in New York and Boston indicates that Johnson's prophecy did not come true).<ref>According to the [[Social Security Administration]] [http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/index.html Popular baby name database], Thurgood has never been in the top 1000 of male baby names.</ref>

The second was [[Clarence Thomas]], appointed by [[George H. W. Bush]] to succeed Marshall in 1991.  Bush initially wanted to nominate Thomas to replace [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]], who stepped down in 1990, but Bush decided that Thomas had not yet had enough experience as a judge after only months on the federal bench.<ref name="abc news">{{cite news|author=Jan Crawford Greenburg|date=September 30, 2007|title=Clarence Thomas: A Silent Justice Speaks Out|publisher=[[ABC News]]|url=https://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3664944&page=1|access-date=October 18, 2008}}</ref> Bush nominated New Hampshire Supreme Court judge [[David Souter]] (who is not African American) instead.<ref name="abc news" /> When Marshall retired due to health reasons in 1991, Bush nominated Thomas, preserving the racial composition of the court.

===Hispanic and Latino justices===
[[File:Obama and Sotomayor.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sonia Sotomayor]], the first Hispanic justice, with appointing President [[Barack Obama]].]]
The words "[[Latino (demonym)|Latino]]" and "[[Hispanic]]" are sometimes given distinct meanings, with "Latino" referring to persons of [[Latin America]]n descent, and "Hispanic" referring to persons having an ancestry, language or culture traceable to [[Spain]] or to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] as a whole, as well as to persons of [[Latin America]]n descent, whereas the term "[[Lusitanic]]" usually refers to persons having an ancestry, language or culture traceable to [[Portugal]] specifically.

[[Sonia Sotomayor]]—nominated by President [[Barack Obama]] on May 26, 2009, and sworn in on August 8—is the first Supreme Court Justice of [[Latin America]]n descent. Born in [[New York City]] of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] parents, she has been known to refer to herself as a "[[Nuyorican]]". Sotomayor is also generally regarded as the first Hispanic justice, although some sources claim that this distinction belongs to former Justice [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]].

It has been claimed that "only since the [[George H. W. Bush]] administration have Hispanic candidates received serious consideration from presidents in the selection process",<ref name=Davis2005_p50>{{cite book|last=[[#Davis2005|Davis]] |title=Electing Justice: Fixing the Supreme Court Nomination Process |year=2005 |page=50}}</ref> and that [[Emilio M.

They identify a number of other sources that present conflicting views as to Cardozo's ethnicity, with one simply labeling him "Iberian."

===Ethnic groups that have never been represented===
Many ethnic groups have never been represented on the Court. There has never been a Justice with any Asian, Native American, or Pacific Islander heritage, and no person having such a heritage was publicly considered for an appointment until the 21st century. Legal scholar [[Viet D. Dinh]], of [[Vietnam]]ese descent, was named as a potential [[George W.

===Public opinion on ethnic diversity===
Public opinion about ethnic diversity on the court "varies widely depending on the poll question's wording".<ref name="marshall-109"/> For example, in two polls taken in 1991, one resulted in half of respondents agreeing that it was "important that there always be at least one black person" on the Court while the other had only 20% agreeing with that sentiment, and with 77% agreeing that "race should never be a factor in choosing Supreme Court justices".<ref name="marshall-109"/>

==Gender==

Of the 115 justices, 110 (95.7%) have been men. All Supreme Court justices were males until 1981, when [[Ronald Reagan]] fulfilled his [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 campaign promise]] to place a woman on the Court,<ref name="obrien53">{{cite book|last=[[#OBrien2003|O'Brien]] |title=Storm Center|year=2003|page=53}}</ref> which he did with the appointment of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]. O'Connor was later joined on the Court by [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], appointed by [[Bill Clinton]] in 1993. After O'Connor retired in 2006, Ginsburg was joined by [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and [[Elena Kagan]], who were successfully appointed to the Court in 2009 and 2010, respectively, by [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-kagan-sworn-in-20100808,0,3379225.story |title= Elena Kagan Sworn in as Supreme Court Justice |first=Janet |last=Hook |date= August 7, 2010 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=August 7, 2010}}</ref> In September 2020, following Ginsburg's death, [[Donald Trump]] nominated [[Amy Coney Barrett]] to succeed her.<ref name="official SCOTUS">{{cite web |author1=Steve Holland |author2=Lawrence Hurley |author3=Andrew Chung |title=Trump announces 'brilliant' conservative judge Barrett as Supreme Court pick |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-trump/trump-announces-brilliant-conservative-judge-barrett-as-supreme-court-pick-idUSKBN26H0GI |website=reuters.com |access-date=26 September 2020}}</ref> Barrett was confirmed the following month. The only other woman to be nominated to the Court was [[Harriet Miers]], whose nomination to succeed O'Connor by [[George W. Bush]] was [[Harriet Miers Supreme Court nomination|withdrawn under fire]], also marking the first time when a woman was nominated to replace another woman on the court.

Substantial public sentiment in support of appointment of a woman to the Supreme Court has been expressed since at least as early as 1930, when an editorial in the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' encouraged [[Herbert Hoover]] to consider Ohio justice [[Florence E. Allen]] or assistant attorney general [[Mabel Walker Willebrandt]].<ref name=Maltese1998_p126>{{cite book |last=[[#Maltese1998|Maltese]] |title=The Selling of Supreme Court Nominees|year=1998|page=126}}</ref> [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] later appointed Allen to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]]—making her "one of the highest ranking female jurists in the world at that time".<ref name=women>{{cite book |last=[[#SalokarVolcansek1996|Salokar and Volcansek]] |title=Women in Law: A Bio-bibliographical Sourcebook |year=1996 |page=20}}</ref> However, neither Roosevelt nor his successors over the following two decades gave strong consideration to female candidates for the Court. [[Harry Truman]] considered such an appointment but was dissuaded by concerns raised by justices then serving that a woman on the Court "would inhibit their conference deliberations", which were marked by informality.<ref name=women/>

President [[Richard Nixon]] named [[Mildred Lillie]], then serving on the [[California Courts of Appeal|Second District Court of Appeal of California]], as a potential nominee to fill one of two vacancies on the Court in 1971.<ref name="obrien53"/> However, Lillie was quickly deemed unqualified by the [[American Bar Association]], and no formal proceedings were ever set with respect to her potential nomination. [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Lewis Powell]] and [[William Rehnquist]] were then successfully nominated to fill those vacancies.

===Public opinion on gender diversity===
In 1991, a poll found that 53% of Americans felt it "important that there always be at least one woman" on the Court.<ref name="marshall-109"/> However, when O'Connor stepped down from the court, leaving Justice Ginsburg as the lone remaining woman, only one in seven persons polled found it "essential that a woman be nominated to replace" O'Connor.<ref name=marshall-109/>

==Marital status and sexual orientation==

===Marital status===
All but a handful of Supreme Court justices have been married. [[Frank Murphy]], [[Benjamin Cardozo]], and [[James McReynolds]] were all lifelong bachelors.<ref name=AARR>{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/reliable-source/2009/05/rs-sonia27.html | first1=Amy | last1=Argetsinger | first2=Roxanne | last2=Roberts | author-link1=Amy Argetsinger | author-link2=Roxanne Roberts | title=Sotomayor: A Single Supreme? | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=May 27, 2009| access-date=July 10, 2010 |series=The Reliable Source}}</ref> In addition, retired justice [[David Souter]] and current justice [[Elena Kagan]] have never been married.<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100513081527/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64910220100510 Kagan bucks 40-year trend as court pick]", Reuters News, May 10, 2010.</ref><ref name="Belkin">Lisa Belkin, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/magazine/23FOB-wwln-t.html Judging Women]", ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' (May 18, 2010).</ref> [[William O.

[[Sonia Sotomayor]] was the first female justice to be appointed as an unmarried woman, having divorced in 1983, long before her nomination in 2009.<ref name=AARR/><ref name="Belkin"/>

Several justices have become widowers while on the bench. The 1792 death of Elizabeth Rutledge, wife of Justice [[John Rutledge]], contributed to the mental health problems that led to the rejection of his recess appointment.<ref name="Flanders">{{cite book|last=Flanders|first=Henry|title=The Lives and Times of the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States |orig-year=1874 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qbE427HiSx0C&pg=PA431 |access-date=April 29, 2008 |volume=1|publisher=J.

===Sexual orientation===
With regard to [[sexual orientation]], no Supreme Court justice has identified himself or herself as anything other than [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]], and no incontrovertible evidence of a justice having any other sexual orientation has ever been uncovered. However, the personal lives of several justices and nominees have attracted speculation.

[[G. Harrold Carswell]] was unsuccessfully nominated by [[Richard Nixon]] in 1970 and was convicted in 1976 of [[battery (crime)|battery]] for making an "unnatural and lascivious" advance to a male police officer working undercover in a Florida men's room.<ref name=MurdochPrice2002_p187>{{cite book |last=[[#MurdochPrice2002|Murdoch and Price]] |title=Courting Justice: Gay Men and Lesbians V. the Supreme Court |year=2002|page= 187}}</ref> Some therefore claim him as the only [[gay]] or [[bisexual]] person nominated to the Court thus far.<ref name=Stern2006_p84>{{cite book |first=Keith |last=Stern |title=Queers in History |year=2006|page=84}} Stating of Carswell, "He's the only known homosexual to have been nominated to the Supreme Court, though he was in the closet".</ref><ref name=Dean2001_p20>{{cite book |last=[[#Dean2001|Dean]]|title=The Rehnquist Choice: The Untold Story of the Nixon Appointment That Redefined the Supreme Court |year=2001 |page=20}}</ref> If so, it is unlikely that Nixon was aware of it; [[White House Counsel]] [[John Dean]] later wrote of Carswell that "[w]hile Richard Nixon was always looking for historical firsts, nominating a homosexual to the high court would not have been on his list".<ref name=Dean2001_p20/>

Speculation has been recorded about the sexual orientation of a few justices who were lifelong bachelors, but no unambiguous evidence exists that they were gay. Perhaps the greatest body of circumstantial evidence surrounds [[Frank Murphy]], who was dogged by "[r]umors of homosexuality [...] all his adult life".<ref>Joyce Murdoch and Deb Price, ''Courting Justice: Gay Men and Lesbians v. The Supreme Court'' (New York: Basic Books, 2001) p.18.</ref>
<blockquote>For more than 40 years, Edward G. Kemp was Frank Murphy's devoted, trusted companion. Like Murphy, Kemp was a lifelong bachelor. From college until Murphy's death, the pair found creative ways to work and live together. [...] When Murphy appeared to have the better future in politics, Kemp stepped into a supportive, secondary role.<ref>Joyce Murdoch and Deb Price, ''Courting Justice: Gay Men and Lesbians v. The Supreme Court'' (New York: Basic Books, 2001) pp. 19-20.</ref></blockquote>
As well as Murphy's close relationship with Kemp, Murphy's biographer, historian [[Sidney Fine (historian)|Sidney Fine]], found in Murphy's personal papers a letter that "if the words mean what they say, refers to a homosexual encounter some years earlier between Murphy and the writer." However, the letter's veracity cannot be confirmed, and a review of all the evidence led Fine to conclude that he "could not stick his neck out and say [Murphy] was gay".<ref>Quoted in Joyce Murdoch and Deb Price, ''Courting Justice: Gay Men and Lesbians v. The Supreme Court'' (New York: Basic Books, 2001) p.19.</ref>

Speculation has also surrounded [[Benjamin Cardozo]], whose [[celibate|celibacy]] suggests repressed homosexuality or asexuality. The fact that he was unmarried and was personally tutored by the writer [[Horatio Alger, Jr.|Horatio Alger]] (alleged to have had sexual relations with boys) led some of Cardozo's biographers to insinuate that Cardozo was homosexual, but no real evidence exists to corroborate this possibility. Constitutional law scholar [[Jeffrey Rosen (legal academic)|Jeffrey Rosen]] noted in a ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' of [[Richard Polenberg]]'s book on Cardozo:
<blockquote>Polenberg describes Cardozo's lifelong devotion to his older sister Nell, with whom he lived in New York until her death in 1929. When asked why he had never married, Cardozo replied, quietly and sadly, "I never could give Nellie the second place in my life." Polenberg suggests that friends may have stressed Cardozo's devotion to his sister to discourage rumors "that he was sexually dysfunctional, or had an unusually low sexual drive or was homosexual." But he produces no evidence to support any of these possibilities, except to note that friends, in describing Cardozo, used words like "beautiful", "exquisite", "sensitive" or "delicate."<ref name=NYT_Rosen>Jeffrey Rosen, [https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/02/reviews/971102.02rosent.html NYT November 2, 1997]</ref></blockquote> Andrew Kaufman, author of ''Cardozo'', a biography published in 2000, notes that "Although one cannot be absolutely certain, it seems highly likely that Cardozo lived a celibate life".<ref name=Kaufman1998_p68>{{cite book|last=[[#Kaufman1998|Kaufman]] |title=Cardozo|year=1998|page=68}}</ref> Judge [[Learned Hand]] is quoted in the book as saying about Cardozo: "He [had] no trace of homosexuality anyway".<ref name=Kaufman1998_pp68-9>{{cite book |last=[[#Kaufman1998|Kaufman]] |title=Cardozo|year= 1998|pages= 68–69}}</ref>

More recently, when [[David Souter]] was nominated to the Court, "conservative groups expressed concern to the White House ... that the president's bachelor nominee might conceivably be a homosexual".<ref>[[Tinsley E. Yarbrough]], "David Hackett Souter: Traditional Republican on the Rehnquist Court" (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. viii.</ref> Similar questions were raised regarding the sexual orientation of unmarried nominee Elena Kagan.<ref>{{cite news|title=From softball to Bridget Jones: Why we should stop talking about Elena Kagan's sexuality| last=Baird | first=Julia | author-link=Julia Baird | url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/05/12/from-softball-to-bridget-jones.html | access-date=August 5, 2010 | newspaper=Newsweek | date=May 12, 2010 }}</ref> However, no evidence was ever produced regarding Souter's sexual orientation, and Kagan's apparent heterosexuality was attested by colleagues familiar with her dating history.<ref>Ruth Marcus, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/13/AR2010051304685.html Elena Kagan: A smart woman with fewer choices?], ''The Washington Post'' (Friday, May 14, 2010).</ref>

==Religion==
When the Supreme Court was established in 1789, the first members came from among the ranks of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] and were almost uniformly Protestant. Of the 115 justices who have been appointed to the court, 91 have been from various Protestant denominations, 15 have been Catholics (one other justice, [[Sherman Minton]], converted to Catholicism after leaving the Court). Another, [[Neil Gorsuch]], was raised in the Catholic Church but later attended an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church, though without specifying the denomination to which he felt he belonged.<ref name=gorsuchrel/> Eight have been Jewish and one, [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], had no known religious affiliation. Three of the 17 chief justices have been Catholics, and one Jewish justice, [[Abe Fortas]], was unsuccessfully nominated to be chief justice.

===Protestant justices===
Most Supreme Court justices have been Protestant Christians. These have included 33 [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]], 18 [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], nine [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], five [[Methodism|Methodists]], three [[Baptists]], two [[Disciples of Christ]], and lone representatives of various other denominations.<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/adh_sc.html Adherents.com page on the Supreme Court].</ref> [[William Rehnquist]] and [[William R. Day]] were the Court's only [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]. [[Noah Haynes Swayne|Noah Swayne]] was a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]]. Some fifteen Protestant justices did not adhere to a particular denomination. The religious beliefs of [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], one of the earliest Justices, have been the subject of some dispute, as there are writings from various points of his life from which it can be argued that he leaned towards [[Presbyterianism]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Thomism]], or [[Deism]]; it has been deemed likely that he eventually favored some form of Christianity.<ref>Mark D. Hall, "James Wilson: Presbyterian, Anglican, Thomist, or Deist? Does it Matter?", in Daniel L. Dreisbach, Mark David Hall, Jeffrey Morrison, Jeffry H.

Conversely, [[mainline Protestant]] churches historically were overrepresented.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Following the retirement of [[John Paul Stevens]] in June 2010, the Court had an entirely non-Protestant composition for the first time in its history.<ref name="npr lack">[[Nina Totenberg]], "Supreme Court May Soon Lack Protestant Justices," [[NPR]], ''Heard on Morning Edition'', April 7, 2010, found at [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125641988 NPR website] and transcript found at [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=125641988 NPR website].

===Catholic justices===
[[File:Roger Taney.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Roger B. Taney]], the first Catholic Justice.]]
The first Catholic justice, [[Roger B. Taney]], was appointed chief justice in 1836 by [[Andrew Jackson]]. The second, [[Edward Douglass White]], was appointed as an associate justice in 1894, but also went on to become chief justice. [[Joseph McKenna]] was appointed in 1898, placing two Catholics on the Court until White's death in 1921. This period marked the beginning of an inconsistently observed "tradition" of having a "Catholic seat" on the court.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060215105343/http://www.catholicleague.org/research/catholics_and_the_supreme_court.htm Hitchcock, James, ''Catholics and the Supreme Court: An Uneasy Relationship'' (June 2004)] (from [[Catalyst (magazine)]]).</ref>

Other Catholic justices included [[Pierce Butler (justice)|Pierce Butler]] (appointed 1923) and [[Frank Murphy]] (appointed 1940). [[Sherman Minton]], appointed in 1949, was a Protestant during his time on the Court. To some, however, his wife's Catholic faith implied a "Catholic seat".<ref>{{cite news|title=Indiana Man Is Nominated for U.S. Court Post|work=[[Kentucky New Era]]|agency=Associated Press|date=September 15, 1949|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ae0rAAAAIBAJ&pg=2057%2C5000964}}</ref>  Minton joined his wife's church in 1961, five years after he retired from the Court.<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/adh_sc.html Religious affiliation of Supreme Court justices] Justice [[Sherman Minton]] converted to Catholicism after his retirement. [[James F. Byrnes]] was raised as Catholic, but became an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] before his confirmation as a Supreme Court Justice.</ref>  Minton was succeeded by a Catholic, however, when President [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] appointed [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William J. Brennan]] to that seat. Eisenhower sought a Catholic to appoint to the Court—in part because there had been no Catholic justice since Murphy's death in 1949, and in part because Eisenhower was directly lobbied by [[Francis Spellman|Cardinal Francis Spellman]] of the [[Archdiocese of New York]] to make such an appointment.<ref name="Jeffrey A. Segal 2002 p. 184">Jeffrey A. Segal, Harold J. Spaeth, ''The Supreme Court and the Attitudinal Model Revisited'' (2002) p. 184.</ref> Brennan was then the lone Catholic justice until the appointment of Antonin Scalia in 1986, and [[Anthony Kennedy]] in 1988.

Like Sherman Minton, Clarence Thomas was not a Catholic at the time he was appointed to the Court. Thomas was raised Catholic and briefly attended [[Conception Seminary College]], a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[seminary]],<ref>[http://www.conceptionabbey.org/TowerTopics/TTWinter2001/CThomas.htm Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas visits Conception Seminary College] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321033051/http://www.conceptionabbey.org/TowerTopics/TTWinter2001/CThomas.htm |date=March 21, 2008 }}, Winter 2001.</ref> but had joined the Protestant denomination of his wife after their marriage. At some point in the late 1990s, Thomas returned to Catholicism. In 2005, [[John Roberts]] became the third Catholic Chief Justice and the fourth Catholic on the Court. Shortly thereafter, [[Samuel Alito]] became the fifth on the Court, and the eleventh in the history of the Court. Alito's appointment gave the Court a Catholic majority for the first time in its history. Besides Thomas, at least one other Justice, [[James F. Byrnes]], was raised as a Catholic, but converted to a different branch of Christianity prior to serving on the Court.

In contrast to historical patterns, the Court has gone from having a "Catholic seat" to being what some have characterized as a "Catholic court."  The reasons for that are subject to debate, and are a matter of intense public scrutiny.<ref>[[Barbara A. Perry|Perry, Barbara A.]] [http://www.press.georgetown.edu/detail.html?id=9781589012158 "Catholics and the Supreme Court: From the 'Catholic Seat' to the New Majority," in ''Catholics and Politics: The Dynamic Tension between Faith and Power''], [[Georgetown University Press]], 2008, Edited by K. E. Heyer, M. J. Rozell, M. A. Genovese.</ref> That the majority of the Court is now Catholic, and that the appointment of Catholics has become accepted, represents a historical 'sea change.'  It has fostered accusations that the court has become "a Catholic boys club" (particularly as the Catholics chosen tend to be politically conservative) and calls for non-Catholics to be nominated.<ref>[http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/politics/1455/catholic_boy%E2%80%99s_club:_religion_and_the_supreme_court Kissling, Frances (May 17, 2009) ''Catholic Boy's Club: Religion and the Supreme Court'' Religious Dispatches].  Frances Kissling is a visiting scholar at the Center for Bioethics at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and former president of [[Catholics for a Free Choice]].</ref>

In May 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] nominated a Catholic woman, [[Sonia Sotomayor]], to replace retiring Justice [[David Souter]].<ref name=Paulson>[https://www.boston.com/news/local/articles_of_faith/2009/05/sotomayor_would.html  Paulson, Michael''' Catholicism: Sotomayor would be sixth Catholic''' May 26, 2009.] ''[[Boston Globe]]''.</ref> Her confirmation raised the number of Catholics on the Court to six, compared to three non-Catholics. With [[Antonin Scalia]]'s death in February 2016, the number of Catholic Justices went back to five. [[Neil Gorsuch]], appointed in 2017, was raised Catholic but attends and is a member of an Episcopal church; it is unclear if he identifies as a Catholic as well as belonging to the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].<ref name=gorsuchrel /> With [[Anthony Kennedy]]'s retirement in July 2018, the number of Catholic Justices went down by one, and returned to its previous number with the confirmation of [[Brett Kavanaugh]]. In September 2020, following the death of [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], Donald Trump nominated another Catholic, [[Amy Coney Barrett]] to succeed her.<ref name="official SCOTUS"/>

All of the Catholic justices and nominees have been members of the [[Latin Rite]] within the Catholic Church, and specifically of the [[Roman Rite]].

===Jewish justices===
[[File:Brandeisl.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Louis Brandeis]], the first Jewish Justice.]]
In 1853, President [[Millard Fillmore]] offered to appoint [[Louisiana]] Senator [[Judah P. Benjamin]] to be the first Jewish justice, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported (on February 15, 1853) that "if the President nominates Benjamin, the Democrats are determined to confirm him". However, Benjamin declined the offer, and ultimately became [[Confederate States Secretary of State|Secretary of State for the Confederacy]] during the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]]. The first [[Jewish]] nominee, [[Louis Brandeis]], was appointed in 1916, after a tumultuous hearing process. The 1932 appointment of [[Benjamin N. Cardozo|Benjamin Cardozo]] raised mild controversy for placing two Jewish justices on the Court at the same time, although the appointment was widely lauded based on Cardozo's qualifications, and the Senate was unanimous in confirming Cardozo.<ref>''The New York Times'', February 25, 1932, p. 1.</ref> Most Jewish Supreme Court justices were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, with the exception of Cardozo, who was Sephardic.  None of the Jewish Supreme Court Justices have practiced [[Orthodox Judaism]] while on the Court, although [[Abe Fortas]] was raised Orthodox.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.jewishpress.com/sections/features/features-on-jewish-world/abe-fortas-and-nixons-franking-privilege/2018/10/17/|title=Abe Fortas and Nixon's 'Franking' Privilege|last=Singer|first=Saul Jay|date=October 17, 2018|work=[[The Jewish Press]]|access-date=September 18, 2019|quote=Although raised Orthodox, Fortas was himself not observant, to the point that he married a Protestant; as Professor David Dalin writes, “[F]or Fortas, his parents’ Judaism was always an obstacle to be overcome rather than a heritage to be celebrated.}}</ref>

Cardozo was succeeded by another Jewish Justice, [[Felix Frankfurter]], but Brandeis was succeeded by Protestant [[William O. Douglas]].  Negative reaction to the appointment of the early Jewish justices did not exclusively come from outside the Court. Justice [[James Clark McReynolds]], a blatant [[anti-semite]], refused to speak to Brandeis for three years following the latter's appointment and when Brandeis retired in 1939, did not sign the customary dedicatory letter sent to Court members on their retirement.  During [[Benjamin N. Cardozo|Benjamin Cardozo's]] swearing in ceremony McReynolds pointedly read a newspaper muttering "another one" and did not attend that of [[Felix Frankfurter]], exclaiming "My God, another Jew on the Court!"<ref>Henry Julian Abraham, ''Justices, Presidents, and Senators: A History of the U.S. Supreme Court Appointments from Washington to Bush II'' (2007), p. 140.</ref>

Frankfurter was followed by [[Arthur Goldberg]] and [[Abe Fortas]], each of whom filled what became known as the "Jewish seat". After Fortas resigned in 1969, he was replaced by Protestant [[Harry Blackmun]]. No Jewish justices were nominated thereafter until Ronald Reagan nominated [[Douglas H. Ginsburg]] in 1987, to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of [[Lewis F. Powell]]; however, this nomination was withdrawn, and the Court remained without any Jewish justices until 1993, when [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] (unrelated to Douglas Ginsburg) was appointed to replace [[Byron White]]. Ginsburg was followed in relatively quick succession by the appointment of [[Stephen Breyer]], also Jewish, in 1994 to replace [[Harry Blackmun]]. In 2010, the confirmation of President Barack Obama's nomination of Elena Kagan to the Court ensured that three Jewish justices would serve simultaneously. Prior to this confirmation, [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[political commentator]] [[Pat Buchanan]] stated that, "If Kagan is confirmed, Jews, who represent less than 2 percent of the U.S. population, will have 33 percent of the Supreme Court seats".<ref name="Buchanan">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/pat-buchanan-msnbc-leaves-292073|title=Pat Buchanan Officially Out at MSNBC|date=February 16, 2012|first=Marisa|last=Guthrie|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> At the time of his remarks, 6.4 percent of justices in the history of the court had been Jewish. In 2020, Justice Ginsburg died, reducing the number of Jewish Justices to two.

===The shift to a Catholic majority, and non-Protestant Court===
{{anchor|nonprotmaj}}With Breyer's appointment in 1994, there were two [[Catholic]] justices, Antonin Scalia and [[Anthony Kennedy]], and two Jewish justices, Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. [[Clarence Thomas]], who had been raised as a Catholic but had attended an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church after his marriage, returned to Catholicism later in the 1990s. At this point, the four remaining Protestant justices—Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, and Souter—remained a plurality on the Court, but for the first time in the history of the Court, Protestants were no longer an absolute majority.

The first Catholic plurality on the Court occurred in 2005, when Chief Justice Rehnquist was succeeded in office by Chief Justice [[John Roberts]], who became the fourth sitting Catholic justice. On January 31, 2006, Samuel Alito became the fifth sitting Catholic justice, and on August 6, 2009, Sonia Sotomayor became the sixth. By contrast, there has been only one Catholic U.S. President, [[John F. Kennedy]] (unrelated to Justice Kennedy), and one Catholic U.S. Vice President, [[Joe Biden]], and there has never been a Jewish U.S. President or Vice President.

At the beginning of 2010, Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] was the sole remaining Protestant on the Court.<ref name=Paulson/><ref name="nyt053009rc">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/31/us/politics/31catholics.html | title=Sotomayor Would Be Sixth Catholic Justice, but the Pigeonholing Ends There | author=Goodstein, Laurie | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 30, 2009 | access-date=May 31, 2009}}</ref> In April 2010, Justice Stevens announced his retirement, effective as of the Court's 2010 summer recess. Upon Justice Stevens' retirement, which formally began on June 28, 2010, the Court lacked a Protestant member, marking the first time in its history that it was exclusively composed of Jewish and Catholic justices.<ref name="npr lack"/> Although in January 2017, after seven years with no Protestant justices serving or nominated, President [[Donald Trump]] nominated [[Neil Gorsuch]] to the Court, as noted above it is unclear whether Gorsuch considers himself a Catholic or an Episcopalian.<ref>Robert Barnes, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-picks-colo-appeals-court-judge-neil-gorsuch-for-supreme-court/2017/01/31/2b08a226-e55e-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html Trump picks Colo. appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch for Supreme Court], ''The Washington Post'' (January 31, 2017).</ref><ref name=gorsuchrel /> Following the retirement of Justice Kennedy, the Catholic majority on the Court was extended by the appointment of [[Brett Kavanaugh]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Five things to know about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/09/supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaugh-five-things/770210002|access-date=July 10, 2018 |work=USA Today |date=July 9, 2018}}</ref> leaving five Catholic members of the Court, or six if Gorsuch is classified as a "Catholic."<ref name=gorsuchrel/>

This development led to some comment. Law school professor [[Jeffrey Rosen (legal academic)|Jeffrey Rosen]] wrote that "it's a fascinating truth that we've allowed religion to drop out of consideration on the Supreme Court, and right now, we have a Supreme Court that religiously at least, by no means looks like America".<ref name=Rosen>Rosen, Jeffrey. ''The Supreme Court: The Personalities and Rivalries That Defined America''. Times Books, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-8050-8182-4}}"</ref>

===Unrepresented religions===
A number of sizable religious groups, each less than 2% of the U.S. population,<ref>[http://religions.pewforum.org/reports Pew Research Religious Landscape Survey] Retrieved April 5, 2015</ref> have had no members appointed as justices. These include [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Mormons]], [[Pentecostal]]s, [[Muslim]]s, [[Hindu]]s, [[Buddhist]]s, and [[Sikhism|Sikhs]]. [[George Sutherland]] has been described as a "lapsed Mormon"<ref>[[Dean L. May]], ''Utah: a People's History'' (1987), p. 162.</ref> because he was raised in the [[LDS Church]], his parents having immigrated to the United States during Sutherland's infancy to join that church.<ref name="Mayer">Robert R. Mayer, ''The Court and the American crises, 1930–1952'' (1987), p. 217.</ref> Sutherland's parents soon left the LDS Church and moved to Montana.<ref name="Mayer"/> Sutherland himself also disaffiliated with the faith, but remained in Utah and graduated from [[Brigham Young Academy]] in 1881, the only non-Mormon in his class.<ref>Eric Alden Eliason, ''Mormons and Mormonism: an Introduction to an American World Religion'' (2001), p. 169.</ref> In 1975, Attorney General [[Edward H. Levi]] had listed [[Dallin H. Oaks]], a Mormon who had [[law clerk|clerked]] for [[Earl Warren]] and was then president of [[Brigham Young University]], as a potential nominee for [[Gerald Ford]]. Ford "crossed Oaks's name off the list early on, noting in the margin that a member of the LDS Church might bring a 'confirmation fight'".<ref name=Yalof>David Alistair Yalof, ''Pursuit of Justices: Presidential Politics and the Selection of Supreme Court Nominees'' (2001), p. 128.</ref>

No professing [[atheist]] has ever been appointed to the Court, although some justices have declined to engage in religious activity, or affiliate with a denomination. As an adult, Benjamin Cardozo no longer practiced his faith and identified himself as an [[agnostic]], though he remained proud of his Jewish heritage.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/cardozo.html Jewish Virtual Library, Benjamin Cardozo.]</ref>

==Age==
[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr circa 1930-edit.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]], the oldest justice in history, served on the Court until he was 90.]]
Unlike the offices of President, U.S. Representative, and U.S. Senator, there is no minimum age for Supreme Court justices set forth in the [[United States Constitution]]. However, justices tend to be appointed after having made significant achievements in law or politics, which excludes many young potential candidates from consideration. At the same time, justices appointed at too advanced an age will likely have short tenures on the Court.

The youngest justice ever appointed was [[Joseph Story]], 32 at the time of his appointment in 1812; the oldest was [[Charles Evans Hughes]], who was 67 at the time of his appointment as Chief Justice in 1930. (Hughes had previously been appointed to the Court as an associate justice in 1910, at the age of 48, but had resigned in 1916 to run for president). Story went on to serve for 33 years, while Hughes served 11 years after his second appointment. The oldest justice at the time of his initial appointment was [[Horace Lurton]], 65 at the time of his appointment in 1909. Lurton died after only four years on the Court. The oldest sitting justice to be elevated to Chief Justice was Hughes' successor, [[Harlan Fiske Stone]], who was 68 at the time of his elevation in 1941. Stone died in 1946, only five years after his elevation. The oldest nominee to the court was South Carolina senator [[William Smith (South Carolina senator)|William Smith]], nominated in 1837, then aged around 75 (it is known that he was born in 1762, but not the exact date). The Senate confirmed Smith's nomination by a vote of 23–18, but Smith declined to serve.<ref>Steven P. Brown, ''John McKinley and the Antebellum Supreme Court'' (2012), p. 106.</ref>

Of the justices currently sitting, the youngest at the time of appointment was Clarence Thomas, who was 43 years old at the time of his confirmation in 1991. As of October 2020, [[Amy Coney Barrett]] is the youngest justice sitting, at {{ayd|1972|01|28}} old, while [[Stephen Breyer]] is the oldest at {{ayd|1938|8|15}}. The oldest person to have served on the Court was [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]], who stepped down two months shy of his {{ordinal|91}} birthday.<ref name="Weiss">

The average age of the Court as a whole fluctuates over time with the departure of older justices and the appointment of younger people to fill their seats. The average age of the Court is {{age in years and months|1945|11|27}}. Just prior to the death of Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] in September 2005, the average age was 71. After [[Sonia Sotomayor]] was appointed in August 2009, the average age at which current justices were appointed was about 53 years old.

The longest period of time in which one group of justices has served together occurred from August 3, 1994, when [[Stephen Breyer]] was appointed to replace the retired [[Harry Blackmun]], to September 3, 2005, the death of Rehnquist, totaling 11 years and 31 days. From 1789 until 1970, justices served an average of 14.9 years. Those who have stepped down since 1970 have served an average of 25.6 years. The retirement age had jumped from an average of 68 pre-1970 to 79 for justices retiring post-1970. Between 1789 and 1970 there was a vacancy on the Court once every 1.91 years. In the next 34 years since the two appointments in 1971, there was a vacancy on average only once every 3.75 years. The typical one-term president has had one appointment opportunity instead of two.<ref>[[Steven G. Calabresi]] and [[James Lindgren]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20050414061240/http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110006539 Justice for Life? The case for Supreme Court term limits.], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', April 10, 2005.</ref>

Commentators have noted that advances in medical knowledge "have enormously increased the life expectancy of a mature person of an age likely to be considered for appointment to the Supreme Court".<ref name=cramton-car-4>Roger C. Cramton and Paul D. Carrington, eds., ''Reforming the Court: Term Limits for Supreme Court Justices'' ([[Carolina Academic Press]], 2006), p. 4.</ref> Combined with the reduction in responsibilities carried out by modern justices as compared to the early justices, this results in much longer potential terms of service.<ref name="cramton-car-4"/> This has led to proposals such as imposing a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices<ref>[[Richard Allen Epstein|Richard Epstein]], "Mandatory Retirement for Supreme Court Justices", in Roger C.

==Educational background==
{{main|List of law schools attended by United States Supreme Court justices}}
[[File:Stanley Reed.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Stanley F. Reed]] was the last sitting Justice to have not graduated from law school.]]
Although the Constitution imposes no educational background requirements for federal judges, the work of the Court involves complex questions of [[law]]—ranging from [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]] to [[administrative law]] to [[admiralty law]]—and consequently, a legal education has become a ''de facto'' prerequisite to appointment on the Supreme Court. Every person who has been nominated to the Court has been an [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]].<ref name="segalspaeth182"/>

Before the advent of modern [[Law school in the United States|law schools in the United States]], justices, like most attorneys of the time, completed their legal studies by "[[reading law]]" (studying under and acting as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] to more experienced attorneys) rather than attending a formal program. The first justice to be appointed who had attended an actual law school was [[Levi Woodbury]], appointed to the Court in 1846. Woodbury had attended [[Litchfield Law School|Tapping Reeve Law School]] in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]] prior to his admission to the bar in 1812. However, Woodbury did not receive a [[law degree]]. Woodbury's successor on the Court, [[Benjamin Robbins Curtis]], who graduated from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1832, and was appointed to the Court in 1851, was the first Justice to bear such a credential.<ref name=abraham-49>Henry Julian Abraham, ''Justices, Presidents, and Senators: A History of the U.S. Supreme Court Appointments from Washington to Bush II'' (2007), p. 49.</ref>

Associate Justices [[James F. Byrnes]], whose short tenure lasted from June 1941 to October 1942, and [[Robert H. Jackson]], who served from July 1941 to October 1954, were the last two justices to be appointed without having graduated from law school; [[Stanley Forman Reed]], who served on the Court from 1938 to 1957, was the last sitting justice from such a background. In total, of the 115 justices appointed to the Court, 49 have graduated from law school, an additional 18 attended some law school but did not graduate, and 47 received their legal education without any law school attendance.<ref name="abraham-49"/> Two justices, [[Sherman Minton]] and [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.]], earned a [[Master of Laws]] degree.<ref>Biographical encyclopedia of the Supreme Court : the lives and legal philosophies of the justices / edited by Melvin I. Urofsky.

== Professional background ==
Not only have all justices been attorneys, nearly two thirds had previously been judges.<ref name="segalspaeth182"/> {{As of|2020}}, eight of the nine sitting justices previously served as judges of the [[United States courts of appeals]], while Justice Elena Kagan served as [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]], the attorney responsible for representing the federal government in cases before the Court. Few justices have a background as [[criminal defense lawyer]]s, and Thurgood Marshall is reportedly the last justice to have had a client in a [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] case.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Ifill | first = Sherrilyn | title = Commentary: Break the mold for Supreme Court picks | publisher = CNN | date = May 4, 2009   | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/04/ifill.court/ }}</ref>

Historically, justices have come from some tradition of public service; only [[George Shiras Jr.]] had no such experience.<ref>Abraham (2007), p. 48.</ref> Relatively few justices have been appointed from among members of Congress.

Predominantly, recent justices have had experience in the [[Executive branch]].  The last [[Member of Congress]] to be nominated was [[Sherman Minton]]. The last nominee to have any [[Legislative branch]] experience was [[Sandra Day O'Connor]].

{{As of|2020}}, 42 justices have been military veterans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/408378-More-veterans-should-be-nominated-to-the-Supreme-Court|title=More veterans should be nominated to the Supreme Court|first=Rory E.|last=Riley-Topping|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=September 25, 2018}}</ref> Numerous justices were appointed who had served in the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[American Civil War]] (including three who had served in the [[Confederate States Army]]), [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. However, no justice has been appointed who has served in any subsequent war. The last justice to have served in the military during wartime was [[John Paul Stevens]], who was in naval intelligence during World War II.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/08/none-of-the-supreme-court-justices-has-battle-experience/260973/|title=None of the Supreme Court Justices Has Battle Experience|first=Andrew|last=Cohen|publisher=[[The Atlantic]]|date=August 13, 2012}}</ref>

==Financial means==
The financial position of the typical Supreme Court Justice has been described as "upper-middle to high social status: reared in nonrural but not necessarily urban environment, member of a civic-minded, politically active, economically comfortable family".<ref name="abraham-49"/> [[Charles A. Beard]], in his ''[[An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States]]'', profiled those among the justices who were also drafters of the Constitution.

[[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], Beard notes, "developed a lucrative practice at [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]]" before becoming "one of the directors of the [[Bank of North America]] on its incorporation in 1781".<ref name=Beard1913_p147>{{cite book|last=[[#Beard1913|Beard]]|title=An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States|year=1913|page=147}}</ref> A member of the [[Georgia Land Company]], Wilson "held shares to the amount of at least one million acres".<ref name=Beard1913_p148>{{cite book|last=[[#Beard1913|Beard]]|title=An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States|year=1913|page=148}}</ref> [[John Blair Jr.|John Blair]] was "one of the most respectable men in Virginia, both on account of his Family as well as fortune".<ref name=Beard1913_p77>{{cite book|last=[[#Beard1913|Beard]]|title=An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States|year=1913|page=77}}</ref> Another source notes that Blair "was a member of a prominent Virginia family. His father served on the Virginia Council and was for a time acting Royal governor. His granduncle, James Blair, was founder and first president of the College of William and Mary."<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/RevWar/ss/blair.htm U.S. Army Center of Military History page on John Blair].</ref> [[John Rutledge]] was elected Governor of South Carolina at a time when the Constitution of that state set, as a qualification for the office, ownership of "a settled plantation or freehold ... of the value of at least ten thousand pounds currency, clear of debt".<ref name=Beard1913_p142>{{cite book|last=[[#Beard1913|Beard]]|title=An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States|year=1913|page=142}}</ref> [[Oliver Ellsworth]] "rose rapidly to wealth and power in the bar of his native state" with "earnings... unrivalled in his own day and unexampled in the history of the colony", developing "a fortune which for the times and the country was quite uncommonly large".<ref name=Beard1913_p89>{{cite book|last=[[#Beard1913|Beard]]|title=An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States|year=1913|page=89}}</ref> [[Bushrod Washington]] was the nephew of [[George Washington]], who was at the time of the younger Washington's appointment the immediate past President of the United States and one of the wealthiest men in the country.<ref>Eugene Parsons, Graeme Mercer Adam and Henry Wade Rogers, ''George Washington: A Character Sketch'', (1903), p. 34.</ref>

"About three-fifths of those named to the Supreme Court personally knew the President who nominated them".<ref name="Jeffrey A. Segal 2002 p. 184"/> There have been exceptions to the typical portrait of justices growing up middle class or wealthy. For example, the family of [[Sherman Minton]] went through a period of impoverishment during his childhood, resulting from the disability of his father due to a [[heat stroke]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Sherman Minton: New Deal Senator, Cold War Justice|author1=Gugin, Linda  |author2=St. Clair, James E.|publisher=Indiana Historical Society|year=1997|isbn=0-87195-116-9}}</ref>

In 2008, seven of the nine sitting justices were millionaires, and the remaining two were close to that level of wealth.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/06/scotus.finances/index.html Justices are well-off, well-traveled], ''[[CNN]]'', June 4, 2008.</ref> Historian [[Howard Zinn]], in his 1980 book ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'', argues that the justices cannot be neutral in  matters between rich and poor, as they are almost always from the upper class.<ref>[[Howard Zinn]], ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'' (New York: Perennial, 2003), p.260-261 {{ISBN|0-06-052837-0}}.</ref> Chief Justice Roberts is the son of an executive with [[Bethlehem Steel]]; Justice Stevens was born into a wealthy Chicago family;<ref>[[Jeffrey Rosen (legal academic)|Jeffrey Rosen]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/magazine/23stevens-t.html "The Dissenter,"] ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' (September 23, 2007).</ref> and Justices Kennedy and Breyer both had fathers who were successful attorneys. Justices Alito and Scalia both had educated (and education-minded) parents: Scalia's father was a highly educated college professor and Alito's father was a high school teacher before becoming "a long-time employee of the New Jersey state legislature".<ref>[https://www.oyez.org/justices/samuel_a_alito_jr/ Oyez Biography of Samuel A. Alito, Jr.].</ref>  Only Justices Thomas and Sotomayor have been regarded as coming from a [[American lower class|lower-class]] background. One authority states that "Thomas grew up in poverty. The Pin Point community he lived in lacked a sewage system and paved roads.

Beginning in 1979, the [[Ethics in Government Act]] of 1978 required federal officials, including the justices, to file annual disclosures of their income and assets.<ref>The constitutionally of those portions of the Act requiring federal judges to disclose their income and assets were themselves challenged in a United States federal court, and were held to be constitutional. ''Duplantier v. United States'', 606 F.2d 654 (5th Cir. 1979), ''cert. denied'', 449 U.S. 1076 (1981).</ref> These disclosures provide a snapshot into the wealth of the justices, reported within broad ranges, from year to year since 1979. In the first such set of disclosures, only two justices were revealed to be millionaires: [[Potter Stewart]]<ref name=Beck79>Melinda Beck et al., "Who Has How Much in Washington", ''[[Newsweek]]'' (May 28, 1979), p. 40.</ref> and [[Lewis F. Powell]],<ref>"Powell Reports Finances", ''Facts on File World News Digest'' (June 22, 1979), p. 464 B3.</ref> with Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] coming in third with about $600,000 in holdings.<ref name=Beck79/> The least wealthy Justice was [[Thurgood Marshall]].<ref name=Beck79/>

The 1982 report disclosed that newly appointed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was a millionaire, and the second-wealthiest Justice on the Court (after Powell).<ref name=82assets>Barbara Rosewicz, "Millionaires on the bench", ''United Press International'' (May 17, 1982), Washington News.</ref> The remaining justices listed assets in the range of tens of thousands to a few hundred-thousand, with the exception of Thurgood Marshall, who "reported no assets or investment income of more than $100".<ref name=82assets/> The 1985 report had the justices in relatively the same positions,<ref>Henry J. Reske, "Justices reveal personal worth", ''United Press International'' (May 16, 1985), Washington News.</ref> while the 1992 report had O'Connor as the wealthiest member of the Court, with Stevens being the only other millionaire, most other justices reporting assets averaging around a half million dollars, and the two newest justices, [[Clarence Thomas]] and [[David Souter]], reporting assets of at least $65,000.<ref>"Souter and Thomas Report Least Assets of All Justices", ''The New York Times'' (May 17, 1992),  Section 1; Page 31; Column 1; National Desk</ref> (In 2011, however, it was revealed that [[Clarence Thomas#Personal life|Thomas had misstated his income]] going back to at least 1989.<ref>{{cite news |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 22, 2011 |access-date=January 23, 2011 |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-thomas-disclosure-20110122,0,2413407.story |title=Clarence Thomas failed to report wife's income, watchdog says |first=Kim | last = Geiger}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/us/politics/25thomas.html |date=January 24, 2011 |work=The New York Times |title=Thomas Cites Failure to Disclose Wife's Job |first=Eric | last = Lichtblau |access-date=January 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/01/clarence-thomas-supreme-court-financial-report-/1 |date=January 24, 2011 |work=USA Today |title=Clarence Thomas fixes reports to include wife's pay |first=Catalina | last = Camia |access-date=February 5, 2011}}</ref>)

The 2007 report was the first to reflect the holdings of John Roberts and Samuel Alito. Disclosures for that year indicated that Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy were the only justices who were clearly not millionaires, although Thomas was reported to have signed a book deal worth over one million dollars.<ref name=AFX>"Justices report 2006 finances", ''[[Agence France-Presse|AFX News Limited]]'' (June 8, 2007).</ref> Other justices have reported holdings within the following ranges:<ref>[http://moneyline.cq.com/flatfiles/editorialFiles/moneyLine/reference/scotus/scotus.html Justices of the Supreme Court], ''MoneyLine Reference'' (accessed January 18, 2006).</ref><ref name=Balcerzak17>Ashley Balcerzak and Viveca Novak, [https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2017/01/trumps-pick-gorsuch/ "Trump’s pick: Gorsuch is respected jurist — and another multimillionaire"], OpenSecrets.org, Center for Responsive Politics (January 31, 2017).</ref>

The financial disclosures indicate that many of the justices have substantial stock holdings.<ref name=AFX/> This, in turn, has affected the business of the Court, as these holdings have led justices to recuse themselves from cases, occasionally with substantial impact. For example, in 2008, the recusal of John Roberts in one case, and Samuel Alito in another, resulted in each ending in a 4–4 split, which does not create a binding precedent.<ref>"Supreme Recusal; When high court justices step aside from cases, there is no easy remedy for the consequences", ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (March 8, 2008), p. A14.</ref> The Court was unable to decide another case in 2008 because four of the nine justices had conflicts, three arising from stock ownership in affected companies.<ref>"[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/opinion/18sun3.html Court Without a Quorum]", ''[[The New York Times]]'' (May 18, 2008), Section WK; Column 0; Editorial Desk; p. 11.</ref>
