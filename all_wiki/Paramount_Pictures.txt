== History ==
=== Famous Players Film Company ===
{{Main|Famous Players Film Company}}

Paramount is the fifth oldest surviving film studio in the world after the French studios [[Gaumont Film Company]] (1895) and [[Pathé]] (1896), followed by the [[Nordisk Film]] company (1906), and [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] (1912).<ref name="Abel10" /><!-- never mentions Gaumont only LA studios <ref>{{cite web |title=The Big Five Movie Studios |url=http://www.ealmanac.com/1843/numbers/the-big-five-movies-studios}}</ref> -->  It is the last [[major film studio]] still headquartered in the [[Hollywood]] district of [[Los Angeles]].

Paramount Pictures dates its existence from the 1912 founding date of the [[Famous Players Film Company]]. Hungarian-born founder [[Adolph Zukor]], who had been an early investor in [[nickelodeon movie theatre|nickelodeons]], saw that movies appealed mainly to working-class immigrants.<ref name="TIMWU2010">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iM6sos2U554C |title=The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires – Tim Wu – Google Books |date= November 2, 2010|isbn=9780307594655 |access-date=June 17, 2015|last1=Wu |first1=Tim }}</ref> With partners [[Daniel Frohman]] and [[Charles Frohman]] he planned to offer feature-length films that would appeal to the middle class by featuring the leading theatrical players of the time (leading to the slogan "Famous Players in Famous Plays"). By mid-1913, Famous Players had completed five films, and Zukor was on his way to success. Its first film was ''[[Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth]]'', which starred [[Sarah Bernhardt]].

That same year, another aspiring producer, [[Jesse L. Lasky]], opened his Lasky Feature Play Company with money borrowed from his brother-in-law, Samuel Goldfish, later known as [[Samuel Goldwyn]]. The Lasky company hired as their first employee a stage director with virtually no film experience, [[Cecil B. DeMille]], who would find a suitable site in Hollywood, near Los Angeles, for his first feature film, ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]''.

[[File:Paramount logo 1914.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Paramount Pictures' first logo, based on a design by its founder [[William Wadsworth Hodkinson]], used from 1917 to 1967.]]

Starting in 1914, both Lasky and Famous Players released their films through a start-up company, Paramount Pictures Corporation, organized early that year by a Utah theatre owner, [[W. W. Hodkinson]], who had bought and merged several smaller firms. Hodkinson and actor, director, producer [[Hobart Bosworth]] had started production of a series of [[Jack London]] movies. Paramount was the first successful nationwide distributor; until this time, films were sold on a statewide or regional basis which had proved costly to film producers. Also, Famous Players and Lasky were privately owned while Paramount was a corporation.

=== Famous Players-Lasky ===
{{Main|Famous Players-Lasky}}
[[File:Spanish Paramount logo (Distribuida Pela Paramount), circa 1929.ogv|thumb|The logo, with Portuguese captions: ''Distribuida Pela Paramount''.]]
In 1916, Zukor maneuvered a three-way merger of his Famous Players, the Lasky Company, and Paramount. Zukor and Lasky bought Hodkinson out of Paramount, and merged the three companies into one. The new company Lasky and Zukor founded, '''[[Famous Players-Lasky]] Corporation''', grew quickly, with Lasky and his partners Goldwyn and DeMille running the production side, Hiram Abrams in charge of distribution, and Zukor making great plans. With only the exhibitor-owned [[First National Pictures|First National]] as a rival, Famous Players-Lasky and its "Paramount Pictures" soon dominated the business.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lasky-company-merges-with-famous-players-later-to-become-paramount|title=Lasky Company merges with Famous Players, later to become Paramount – Jun 28, 1916 – HISTORY.com|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=August 10, 2017}}</ref>

[[File:GrangeLasky-DeMille1913.jpg|thumb|left| Lasky's original studio (a.k.a. "The Barn") as it appeared in the mid 1920s. The Taft building, built in 1923, is visible in the background.]]
Because Zukor believed in stars, he signed and developed many of the leading early stars, including [[Mary Pickford]], [[Marguerite Clark]], [[Pauline Frederick]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Rudolph Valentino]], and [[Wallace Reid]]. With so many important players, Paramount was able to introduce "[[block booking]]", which meant that an exhibitor who wanted a particular star's films had to buy a year's worth of other Paramount productions. It was this system that gave Paramount a leading position in the 1920s and 1930s, but which led the government to pursue it on [[antitrust]] grounds for more than twenty years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/ftc-case_into.htm|title=The Famous Players-Lasky Antitrust Case|website=www.cobbles.com|access-date=August 10, 2017}}</ref>

The driving force behind Paramount's rise was Zukor. Through the teens and twenties, he built the '''Publix Theatres Corporation''', a chain of nearly 2,000 screens, ran two production studios (in [[Astoria, New York]], now the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]], and [[Hollywood, California]]), and became an early investor in radio, taking a 50% interest in the new [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] in 1928 (selling it within a few years; this would not be the last time Paramount and CBS crossed paths).

In 1926, Zukor hired independent producer [[B. P. Schulberg]], an unerring eye for new talent, to run the new West Coast operations. They purchased the Robert Brunton Studios, a 26-acre facility at 5451 Marathon Street for US$1&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paramount.com/node/7664 |title=1926: THE NEW STUDIO &#124; Paramount Pictures |publisher=Paramount.com |access-date=October 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114001735/http://www.paramount.com/node/7664 |archive-date=November 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1927, Famous Players-Lasky took the name '''Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation'''. Three years later, because of the importance of the Publix Theatres, it became '''Paramount Publix Corporation'''.

In 1928, Paramount began releasing ''[[Inkwell Imps]],'' animated cartoons produced by [[Max Fleischer|Max]] and [[Dave Fleischer]]'s [[Fleischer Studios]] in New York City. The Fleischers, veterans in the animation industry, were among the few animation producers capable of challenging the prominence of [[Walt Disney]]. The Paramount newsreel series [[Paramount News]] ran from 1927 to 1957. Paramount was also one of the first Hollywood studios to release what were known at that time as "[[sound film|talkies]]", and in 1929, released their first musical, ''[[Innocents of Paris]]''. [[Richard A. Whiting]] and [[Leo Robin]] composed the score for the film; [[Maurice Chevalier]] starred and sung the most famous song from the film, "[[Louise (Maurice Chevalier song)|Louise]]".

==== Publix, Balaban and Katz, Loew's competition and wonder theaters ====
[[File:Publix theatre Indiana Repertory Theatre.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of Publix Theatre logo on what is now [[Indiana Repertory Theatre]].]]

By acquiring the successful [[Balaban & Katz]] chain in 1926, Zukor gained the services of [[Barney Balaban]] (who would eventually become Paramount's president in 1936), his brother [[A. J. Balaban]] (who would eventually supervise all stage production nationwide and produce talkie shorts), and their partner Sam Katz (who would run the Paramount-Publix theatre chain in New York City from the thirty-five-story Paramount Theatre Building on [[Times Square]]).

Balaban and Katz had developed the Wonder Theater concept, first publicized around 1918 in Chicago. The Chicago Theater was created as a very ornate theater and advertised as a "wonder theater." When Publix acquired Balaban, they embarked on a project to expand the wonder theaters, and starting building in New York in 1927. While Balaban and Public were dominant in Chicago, [[Loew's]] was the big player in New York, and did not want the Publix theaters to overshadow theirs. The two companies brokered a non-competition deal for New York and Chicago, and Loew's took over the New York area projects, developing five [[Loew's Wonder Theaters|wonder theaters]]. Publix continued Balaban's wonder theater development in its home area.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Kings Is Dead!

=== 1920s and 1931–40: Receivership ===
Eventually, Zukor shed most of his early partners; the Frohman brothers, Hodkinson and Goldwyn were out by 1917 while Lasky hung on until 1932, when, blamed for the near-collapse of Paramount in the [[Great Depression|Depression]] years, he too was tossed out. Zukor's over-expansion and use of overvalued Paramount stock for purchases led the company into receivership in 1933. A bank-mandated reorganization team, led by [[John D. Hertz|John Hertz]] and [[Otto Kahn]] kept the company intact, and, miraculously, Zukor was kept on. In 1935, Paramount-Publix went bankrupt. In June 1935 [[John E. Otterson]]<ref>Eileen S. Quigley. ''International Motion Picture Almanac,'' 1938. p. 581.</ref>  and in 1936 [[Barney Balaban]] became president, and Zukor was bumped up to chairman of the board. In this role, Zukor reorganized the company as '''Paramount Pictures, Inc.''' and was able to successfully bring the studio out of bankruptcy.

As always, Paramount films continued to emphasize stars; in the 1920s there were [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Wallace Reid]], [[Rudolph Valentino]], [[Florence Vidor]], [[Thomas Meighan]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Bebe Daniels]], [[Antonio Moreno]], [[Richard Dix]], [[Esther Ralston]], [[Emil Jannings]], [[George Bancroft (actor)|George Bancroft]], [[Betty Compson]], [[Clara Bow]], [[Adolphe Menjou]], and [[Charles Buddy Rogers]]. By the late 1920s and the early 1930s, talkies brought in a range of powerful draws: [[Richard Arlen]], [[Nancy Carroll]], [[Maurice Chevalier]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Charles Ruggles]], [[Ruth Chatterton]], [[William Powell]], [[Mae West]], [[Sylvia Sidney]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Claudette Colbert]], the [[Marx Brothers]], [[W.C. Fields]], [[Fredric March]], [[Jack Oakie]], [[Jeanette MacDonald]] (whose first two films were shot at Paramount's [[Astoria, New York]], studio), [[Carole Lombard]], [[George Raft]], [[Miriam Hopkins]], [[Cary Grant]] and [[Stuart Erwin]], among them.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eames |first=John Douglas |title=The Paramount story |year=1985 |publisher=Crown |location=New York |isbn=0-517-55348-1 |page=37 |edition=[1st ed.].}}</ref> In this period Paramount can truly be described as a movie factory, turning out sixty to seventy pictures a year. Such were the benefits of having a huge theater chain to fill, and of block booking to persuade other chains to go along. In 1933, [[Mae West]] would also add greatly to Paramount's success with her suggestive movies ''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'' and ''[[I'm No Angel]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/shed.html |title=Filmsite.org |publisher=Filmsite.org |access-date=January 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/imno.html |title=Filmsite.org |publisher=Filmsite.org |access-date=January 7, 2010}}</ref> However, the sex appeal West gave in these movies would also lead to the enforcement of the [[Production Code]], as the newly formed organization the [[Catholic Legion of Decency]] threatened a boycott if it was not enforced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mae-west.org/old/mw.bio.html |title=Mae-West.org |publisher=Mae-West.org |access-date=January 7, 2010}}</ref>

Paramount cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios continued to be successful, with [[Character (arts)|characters]] such as [[Betty Boop]] and [[Popeye the Sailor]] becoming widely successful. One Fleischer series, ''[[Screen Songs]]'', featured live-action music stars under contract to Paramount hosting sing-alongs of popular songs. The animation studio would rebound with [[Popeye]], and in 1935, polls showed that Popeye was even more popular than [[Mickey Mouse]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forums.goldenagecartoons.com/showthread.php?t=2907 |title=Forums.GoldenAgeCartoons.com |publisher=Forums.GoldenAgeCartoons.com |access-date=January 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711104313/http://forums.goldenagecartoons.com/showthread.php?t=2907 |archive-date=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> After an unsuccessful expansion into feature films, as well as the fact that Max and Dave Fleischer were no longer speaking to one another, Fleischer Studios was acquired by Paramount, which renamed the operation [[Famous Studios]]. That incarnation of the animation studio continued cartoon production until 1967, but has been historically dismissed as having largely failed to maintain the artistic acclaim the Fleischer brothers achieved under their management.<ref>{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |title=Of Mice and Magic |year=1987 |orig-year=1980 |publisher=Plume |location=New York |page=311}}</ref>

=== 1941–50: ''United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.'' ===
In 1940, Paramount agreed to a government-instituted consent decree: block booking and "pre-selling" (the practice of collecting up-front money for films not yet in production) would end. Immediately, Paramount cut back on production, from 71 films to a more modest 19 annually in the war years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eames |first=John Douglas |title=The Paramount Story |year=1985 |publisher=Crown Publishers, Inc |location=New York |isbn=0-517-55348-1 |page=115}}</ref> Still, with more new stars like [[Bob Hope]], [[Alan Ladd]], [[Veronica Lake]], [[Paulette Goddard]], and [[Betty Hutton]], and with war-time attendance at astronomical numbers, Paramount and the other integrated studio-theatre combines made more money than ever. At this, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] decided to reopen their case against the five integrated studios. Paramount also had a monopoly over [[Detroit]] movie theaters through subsidiary company United Detroit Theaters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/united-detroit_paramount-history.htm |series=SIMPP v. Paramount Theatres|title=The Paramount Theater Monopoly: The History of United Detroit Theaters |publisher=Cobbles.com |access-date=January 7, 2010}}</ref> This led to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' (1948) holding that movie studios could not also own movie theater chains. This decision broke up Adolph Zukor's creation, with the theater chain being split into a new company, [[United Paramount Theaters]], and effectively brought an end to the classic Hollywood [[studio system]].

=== 1951–66: Split and after ===
With the separation of production and exhibition forced by the U.S. Supreme Court, Paramount Pictures Inc. was split in two.<ref name="Nelmes">{{cite book |last=Nelmes |first=Jill |title=An Introduction to Film Studies |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |edition=3 |page=16 |isbn=0-415-26268-2}}</ref> Paramount Pictures Corporation was formed to be the production distribution company, with the 1,500-screen theater chain handed to the new [[United Paramount Theaters]] on December 31, 1949. [[Leonard Goldenson]], who had headed the chain since 1938, remained as the new company's president. The Balaban and Katz theatre division was spun off with UPT; its trademark eventually became the property of the Balaban and Katz Historical Foundation. The Foundation has recently acquired ownership of the Famous Players Trademark. Cash-rich and controlling prime downtown real estate, Goldenson began looking for investments. Barred from film-making by prior antitrust rulings, he acquired the struggling [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network in February 1953, leading it first to financial health, and eventually, in the mid-1970s, to first place in the national Nielsen ratings, before selling out to [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities]] in 1985 (Capital Cities would eventually sell out, in turn, to [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 1996). United Paramount Theaters was renamed ABC Theaters in 1965 and was sold to businessman Henry Plitt in 1977. The movie theater chain was renamed Plitt Theaters. In 1985, [[Cineplex Odeon Corporation]] merged with Plitt. In later years, Paramount's TV division would develop a strong relationship with ABC, providing many hit series to the network.

==== The DuMont Network ====
Paramount Pictures had been an early backer of television, launching experimental stations in 1939 in Los Angeles and Chicago. The Los Angeles station eventually became [[KTLA]], the first commercial station on the West Coast. The Chicago station got a commercial license as WBKB in 1943, but was sold to UPT along with Balaban & Katz in 1948 and was eventually resold to CBS as [[WBBM-TV]].

In 1938, Paramount bought a stake in television manufacturer [[DuMont Laboratories]]. Through this stake, it became a minority owner of the [[DuMont Television Network]].<ref name="Hess1">{{cite book |last=Hess |first=Gary Newton |title=An Historical Study of the DuMont Television Network |publisher=Arno Press |location=New York |year=1979 |page=91 |isbn=0-405-11758-2}}</ref> Also Paramount launched its own network, [[Paramount Television Network]], in 1948 through its television unit, Television Productions, Inc.<ref name="Schatz">{{cite book |last=Schatz |first=Thomas |title=Boom and Bust: American Cinema in the 1940s |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |page=433 |isbn=0-520-22130-3}}</ref>

Paramount management planned to acquire additional [[owned-and-operated station]]s ("O&Os"); the company applied to the FCC for additional stations in San Francisco, Detroit, and Boston.<ref name="Browne">{{cite book|last=Browne|first=Nick|title=American Television: New Directions in History and Theory|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|page=32|isbn=3-7186-0563-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yuU72DJI97UC&q=%22Paramount%20Pictures%22%2B%22FCC%22%2B%22San%20Francisco%22&pg=PA32|access-date=April 9, 2010}}</ref> The FCC, however, denied Paramount's applications. A few years earlier, the federal regulator had placed a five-station cap on all television networks: no network was allowed to own more than five [[VHF]] television stations. Paramount was hampered by its minority stake in the DuMont Television Network. Although both DuMont and Paramount executives stated that the companies were separate, the FCC ruled that Paramount's partial ownership of DuMont meant that DuMont and Paramount were in theory branches of the same company. Since DuMont owned three television stations and Paramount owned two, the federal agency ruled neither network could acquire additional television stations. The FCC requested that Paramount relinquish its stake in DuMont, but Paramount refused.<ref name="Browne" /> According to television historian William Boddy, "Paramount's checkered antitrust history" helped convince the FCC that Paramount controlled DuMont.<ref name="Boddy">{{cite book|last=Boddy|first=William|title=Fifties Television: the Industry and Its Critics|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1992|page=56|isbn=0-252-06299-X}}</ref> Both DuMont and Paramount Television Network suffered as a result, with neither company able to acquire five O&Os. Meanwhile, CBS, ABC, and NBC had each acquired the maximum of five stations by the mid-1950s.<ref name="BrooksandMarsh">{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Tim|last2=Marsh|first2=Earle|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946–present|publisher=Ballantine|location=New York|year=2007|edition=9th|page=xiii|isbn=978-0-345-49773-4}}</ref>

When ABC accepted a merger offer from UPT in 1953, DuMont quickly realized that ABC now had more resources than it could possibly hope to match. It quickly reached an agreement in principle to merge with ABC.<ref name="Bergmann5">Bergmann, Ted; Skutch, Ira (2002). ''The DuMont Television Network: What Happened?'', pp. 79-83. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-8108-4270-X}}.</ref> However, Paramount vetoed the offer due to antitrust concerns.<ref name="RWPDTV">Dean, L.

Larry Dean's R-VCR Television Production website. Retrieved December 28, 2006.</ref> For all intents and purposes, this was the end of DuMont, though it lingered on until 1956.

In 1951, Paramount bought a stake in [[Telemeter (pay television)|International Telemeter]], an experimental pay TV service which operated with a coin inserted into a box. The service began operating in Palm Springs, California on November 27, 1953, but due to pressure from the FCC, the service ended on May 15, 1954.<ref>{{cite web |title=Telemeter: Coin Operated TV |url=http://www.tvobscurities.com/articles/cointv/ |publisher=TVObscurities.com |access-date=June 9, 2012}}</ref>

With the loss of the theater chain, Paramount Pictures went into a decline, cutting studio-backed production, releasing its contract players, and making production deals with independents. By the mid-1950s, all the great names were gone; only [[Cecil B. DeMille]], associated with Paramount since 1913, kept making pictures in the grand old style. Despite Paramount's losses, DeMille would, however, give the studio some relief and create his most successful film at Paramount, a 1956 [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|remake]] of his 1923 film ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/tenc.html |title=Filmsite.org |publisher=Filmsite.org |access-date=January 7, 2010}}</ref> DeMille died in 1959. Like some other studios, Paramount saw little value in its film library, and sold 764 of its pre-1950 films to [[MCA Inc.]]/[[EMKA, Ltd.]] (known today as [[Universal Television]]) in February 1958.<ref>McDougal, Dennis (2001).

=== 1966–70: Early Gulf+Western era ===

By the early 1960s, Paramount's future was doubtful. The high-risk movie business was wobbly; the theater chain was long gone; investments in DuMont and in early pay-television came to nothing; and the Golden Age of Hollywood had just ended, even the flagship Paramount building in Times Square was sold to raise cash, as was KTLA (sold to [[Gene Autry]] in 1964 for a then-phenomenal $12.5&nbsp;million). Their only remaining successful property at that point was [[Dot Records]], which Paramount had acquired in 1957, and even its profits started declining by the middle of the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/dot/dotstoryc.html |title=Dot Records Story, Part 3 |publisher=BSNpubs.com |date=November 10, 1999 |access-date=February 14, 2016}}</ref> Founding father Adolph Zukor (born in 1873) was still chairman emeritus; he referred to chairman Barney Balaban (born 1888) as "the boy." Such aged leadership was incapable of keeping up with the changing times, and in 1966, a sinking Paramount was sold to [[Charles Bluhdorn]]'s industrial conglomerate, [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf + Western Industries Corporation]]. Bluhdorn immediately put his stamp on the studio, installing a virtually unknown producer named [[Robert Evans]] as head of production. Despite some rough times, Evans held the job for eight years, restoring Paramount's reputation for commercial success with ''[[The Odd Couple (film)|The Odd Couple]]'', ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'', ''[[The Godfather]]'', ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', and ''[[3 Days of the Condor]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Robert |title=The kid stays in the picture |year=2006 |publisher=Phoenix Books |location=Beverly Hills, Calif. |isbn=1-59777-525-8 |pages=xii |edition=1st New Millennium printing. |url=https://archive.org/details/kidstaysinpictu00evan |url-access=registration }}</ref>

Gulf + Western Industries also bought the neighboring [[Desilu Productions|Desilu]] television studio (once the lot of [[RKO Pictures]]) from [[Lucille Ball]] in 1967. Using some of Desilu's established shows such as ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', and ''[[Mannix]]'' as a foot in the door at the networks, the newly reincorporated [[Paramount Television]] eventually became known as a specialist in half-hour situation comedies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dick |first=Bernard F. |title=Engulfed : the death of Paramount Pictures and the birth of corporate Hollywood |year=2001 |publisher=Univ.

In 1968, Paramount formed Films Distributing Corp to distribute sensitive film product, including ''Sin With a Stranger'', which was one of the first films to receive an [[X rating]] in the United States when the [[MPAA]] introduced their new [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating system]].<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]|first=A.D.|last=Murphy|title=Coding Old Pix New Wrinkle|date=November 20, 1968|page=1}}</ref>

=== 1971–80: CIC formation and high-concept era ===
In 1970, Paramount teamed with [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] to form [[Cinema International Corporation]], a new company that would distribute films by the two studios outside the United States. [[Metro–Goldwyn–Mayer|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] would become a partner in the mid-1970s. Both Paramount and CIC entered the video market with Paramount Home Video (now [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Home Entertainment]]) and [[CIC Video]], respectively.

Robert Evans abandoned his position as head of production in 1974; his successor, [[Richard Sylbert]], proved to be too literary and too tasteful for Gulf + Western's Bluhdorn. By 1976, a new, television-trained team was in place headed by [[Barry Diller]] and his "Killer-Dillers", as they were called by admirers or "Dillettes" as they were called by detractors. These associates, made up of [[Michael Eisner]], [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Dawn Steel]] and [[Don Simpson]] would each go on and head up major movie studios of their own later in their careers.

The Paramount specialty was now simpler. "[[High concept]]" pictures such as ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' and ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' hit big, hit hard and hit fast all over the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/80sintro.html |title=Film History of the 1980s |publisher=Filmsite.org |date=September 8, 1986 |access-date=August 8, 2015}}</ref>  and Diller's television background led him to propose one of his longest-standing ideas to the board: [[Paramount Television Service]], a [[Fourth television network|fourth commercial network]]. Paramount Pictures purchased the [[Hughes Television Network]] (HTN) including its satellite time in planning for PTVS in 1976. Paramount sold HTN to Madison Square Garden in 1979.<ref name=ap>{{cite news |title=Cohen Buys Hughes TV Network for 3rd Time |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-74495632.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117060244/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-74495632.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |access-date=May 30, 2012 |agency=Associated Press |date=June 9, 2003}}</ref> But Diller believed strongly in the concept, and so took his fourth-network idea with him when he moved to [[20th Century Fox]] in 1984, where Fox's then freshly installed proprietor, [[Rupert Murdoch]] was a more interested listener.

However, the television division would be playing catch-up for over a decade after Diller's departure in 1984 before launching its own television network – [[UPN]] – in 1995. Lasting eleven years before being merged with [[The WB]] network to become [[The CW]] in 2006, UPN would feature many of the shows it originally produced for other networks, and would take numerous gambles on series such as ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' that would have otherwise either gone direct-to-cable or become [[Broadcast syndication|first-run syndication]] to independent stations across the country (as ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' were).

Paramount Pictures was not connected to either [[Paramount Records]] (1910s-1935) or [[ABC Records|ABC-Paramount Records]] (1955–66) until it purchased the rights to use the name (but not the latter's catalog) in the late 1960s. The [[Paramount Records (1969)|Paramount]] name was used for soundtrack albums and some pop re-issues from the [[Dot Records]] catalog which Paramount had acquired in 1957. By 1970, Dot had become an all-country label<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/dot/paramount.html |title=Paramount Album Discography |publisher=BSNpubs.com |date=April 16, 2000 |access-date=January 7, 2010}}</ref> and in 1974, Paramount sold all of its record holdings to [[ABC Records]], which in turn was sold to [[MCA Inc.|MCA]] (now [[Universal Music Group]]) in 1979.<ref>{{Cite book |isbn = 1471611868|title = Elton John|last1 = Hombach|first1 = Jean-Pierre|year = 1987}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |isbn = 1471632903|title = Whitney Houston - Bobby Brown the Truth|last1 = Hombach|first1 = Jean-Pierre}}</ref>

=== 1980–94: Continual success ===
Paramount's successful run of pictures extended into the 1980s and 1990s, generating hits like ''[[Airplane!]]'', ''[[American Gigolo]]'', ''[[Ordinary People]]'', ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]'', ''[[Flashdance]]'', ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'', ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'', ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'', ''[[Top Gun]]'', ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'', ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'', ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', the ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' [[slasher film|slasher]] series, as well as teaming up with [[Lucasfilm]] to create the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]]. Other examples are the ''[[Star Trek]]'' film series and a string of films starring comedian [[Eddie Murphy]] like ''[[Trading Places]]'', ''[[Coming to America]]'' and ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' and its [[sequel]]s. While the emphasis was decidedly on the commercial, there were occasional less commercial but more artistic and intellectual efforts like ''[[I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can]]'', ''[[Atlantic City (1980 film)|Atlantic City]]'', ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'', ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'', ''[[Children of a Lesser God (film)|Children of a Lesser God]]'' and ''[[The Accused (1988 film)|The Accused]]''. During this period, responsibility for running the studio passed from Eisner and Katzenberg to [[Frank Mancuso, Sr.]] (1984) and [[Ned Tanen]] (1984) to [[Stanley R. Jaffe]] (1991) and [[Sherry Lansing]] (1992). More so than most, Paramount's slate of films included many remakes and television [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]]; while sometimes commercially successful, there have been few compelling films of the kind that once made Paramount the industry leader.

On August 25, 1983, Paramount Studios caught fire. Two or three sound stages and four outdoor sets were destroyed.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fire destroys sets, stages at Paramount |date=August 26, 1983 |page=18 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9S8aAAAAIBAJ&dq=paramount%20fire%20cheers%20star-trek&pg=6670%2C8783024 |newspaper=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|Times-News]] |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |access-date=August 17, 2012|agency=[[Associated Press]] |author=John Antczak}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Fire destroys Paramount sound stages |date=August 26, 1983 |page=8 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CJszAAAAIBAJ&dq=paramount%20studios%20fire%20cheers%20star-trek&pg=3449%2C6550609 |agency=[[United Press International]] |newspaper=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]] |location=Lodi, California |access-date=August 17, 2012}}</ref>

When Charles Bluhdorn died unexpectedly, his successor Martin Davis dumped all of G+W's industrial, mining, and sugar-growing subsidiaries and refocused the company, renaming it Paramount Communications in 1989. With the influx of cash from the sale of G+W's industrial properties in the mid-1980s, Paramount bought a string of television stations and [[KECO Entertainment]]'s theme park operations, renaming them [[Paramount Parks]]. These parks included [[California's Great America|Paramount's Great America]], [[Canada's Wonderland|Paramount Canada's Wonderland]], [[Carowinds|Paramount's Carowinds]], [[Kings Dominion|Paramount's Kings Dominion]], and [[Kings Island|Paramount's Kings Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visitkingsisland.com/media-center/park-history |title=Park History &#124; Kings Island, Mason OH |publisher=Visitkingsisland.com |access-date=August 8, 2015}}</ref>

In 1993, [[Sumner Redstone]]'s entertainment conglomerate [[Viacom (1971–2005)|Viacom]] made a bid for a merger with Paramount Communications; this quickly escalated into a bidding war with [[Barry Diller]]'s [[QVC]]. But Viacom prevailed, ultimately paying $10&nbsp;billion for the Paramount holdings. Viacom and Paramount had planned to merge as early as 1989.<ref name="Delugach">{{cite news |last=Delugach |first=Al |title=Viacom, Gulf & Western Discuss Merger |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-05-06/business/fi-2144_1_five-television-and-eight-western-deal-sumner-m-redstone |access-date=May 30, 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=May 6, 1989}}</ref>

Paramount is the last major film studio located in Hollywood proper. When Paramount moved to its present home in 1927, it was in the heart of the film community. Since then, former next-door neighbor [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] closed up shop in 1957 (Paramount ultimately absorbed their former lot); [[Warner Bros.]] (whose old Sunset Boulevard studio was sold to Paramount in 1949 as a home for [[KTLA]]) moved to [[Burbank, Los Angeles County, California|Burbank]] in 1930; [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] joined Warners in Burbank in 1973 then moved again to [[Culver City, California|Culver City]] in 1989; and the Pickford-Fairbanks-Goldwyn-United Artists lot, after a lively history, has been turned into a [[post-production]] and music-scoring facility for Warners, known simply as "The Lot". For a time the semi-industrial neighborhood around Paramount was in decline, but has now come back. The recently refurbished studio has come to symbolize Hollywood for many visitors, and its studio tour is a popular attraction.

In 1983, Gulf and Western began a restructuring process that would transform the corporation from a bloated conglomerate consisting of subsidiaries from unrelated industries to a more focused entertainment and publishing company. The idea was to aid financial markets in measuring the company's success, which, in turn, would help place better value on its shares. Though its Paramount division did very well in recent years, Gulf and Western's success as a whole was translating poorly with investors. This process eventually led Davis to divest many of the company's subsidiaries. Its sugar plantations in Florida and the Dominican Republic were sold in 1985; the consumer and industrial products branch was sold off that same year.<ref name = "lbm" /> In 1989, Davis renamed the company Paramount Communications Incorporated after its primary asset, Paramount Pictures.<ref name="restructure">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-10/business/fi-1718_1_paramount-s-parent-plans-values-publishing-businesses|title=Gulf & Western Wants Buyer for Finance Division : Paramount's Parent Plans to Change Name, Focus on Entertainment, Publishing|last=Williams|first=Linda|date=April 10, 1989|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=May 21, 2012}}</ref> In addition to the Paramount film, television, home video, and music publishing divisions, the company continued to own the Madison Square Garden properties (which also included [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]]), a 50% stake in [[USA Network]]s (the other 50% was owned by [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]/[[Universal Studios]]) and Simon & Schuster, [[Prentice Hall]], [[Pocket Books]], [[Allyn & Bacon]], Cineamerica (a joint venture with [[Warner Communications]]), and Canadian cinema chain [[Famous Players Theatres]].<ref name = "lbm">Prince, Stephen (2000) ''A New Pot of Gold: Hollywood Under the Electronic Rainbow, 1980–1989'' (p. 60-65). [[University of California Press]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]/[[Los Angeles, California]]. {{ISBN|0-520-23266-6}}</ref>

That same year, the company launched a $12.2&nbsp;billion hostile bid to acquire [[Time Inc.]] in an attempt to end a stock-swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications, which also renamed itself after a [[Warner Bros.|film studio it owned]] upon selling off its non-entertainment assets. (The original name of Warner Communications was [[Kinney National Company]].) This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9&nbsp;billion in cash and stock. Gulf and Western responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time-Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Gulf and Western to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of [[Time Warner]].

Paramount used cash acquired from the sale of Gulf and Western's non-entertainment properties to take over the [[TVX Broadcast Group]] chain of television stations (which at that point consisted mainly of large-market stations which TVX had bought from [[Taft Broadcasting]], plus two mid-market stations which TVX owned prior to the Taft purchase), and the [[KECO Entertainment]] chain of theme parks from Taft successor Great American Broadcasting. Both of these companies had their names changed to reflect new ownership: TVX became known as the [[Paramount Stations Group]], while KECO was renamed to [[Paramount Parks]].

Paramount Television launched Wilshire Court Productions in conjunction with USA Networks, before the latter was renamed [[NBCUniversal Cable]], in 1989. Wilshire Court Productions (named for a side street in Los Angeles) produced [[television film]]s that aired on the USA Networks, and later for other networks. USA Networks launched a second channel, the Sci-Fi Channel (now known as [[Syfy]]), in 1992. As its name implied, it focused on films and television series within the science fiction genre. Much of the initial programming was owned either by Paramount or Universal. Paramount bought one more television station in 1993: [[Cox Enterprises]]' [[WKBD-TV]] in Detroit, Michigan, at the time an affiliate of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].

=== 1994–2005: Dolgen/Lansing and "old" Viacom era ===
In February 1994, [[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom]] acquired 50.1% of Paramount Communications Inc. shares for $9.75&nbsp;billion, following a five-month battle with [[QVC]], and completed the merger in July.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 15, 1994|page=A1|last=Fabrikant|first=Geraldine|title=Executives Say That Viacom Has Won Paramount Battle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/15/business/executives-say-that-viacom-has-won-paramount-battle.html|access-date=August 15, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Report|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/44482/0000950112-94-002132.txt|website=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]|access-date=March 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=75 Power Players: The Outsiders|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=61 |quote=Viacom completed acquisition of Paramount Communications in July 1994, creating one of the world's largest entertainment companies.}}</ref> At the time, Paramount's holdings included Paramount Pictures, [[Madison Square Garden]], the [[New York Rangers]], the [[New York Knicks]], and the [[Simon & Schuster]] publishing house.<ref name="Viacom">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/15/business/executives-say-that-viacom-has-won-paramount-battle.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=Executives Say That Viacom Has Won Paramount Battle|last=Fabrikant|first=Geraldine|date=February 15, 1994|work=New York Times|access-date=May 21, 2012}}</ref> The deal had been planned as early as 1989, when the company was still known as Gulf and Western.<ref name="Delugach"/> Though Davis was named a member of the board of [[National Amusements]], which controlled Viacom, he ceased to manage the company.

Under Viacom, the Paramount Stations Group continued to build with more station acquisitions, eventually leading to Viacom's acquisition of its former parent, the [[CBS]] network, in 1999. Around the same time, Viacom bought out [[Spelling Television|Spelling Entertainment]], incorporating its library into that of Paramount itself.

Viacom split into two companies in 2006, one retaining the [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]] name (which continues to own Paramount Pictures), while another was named [[CBS Corporation]] (which now controls Paramount Television Group, which was renamed CBS Paramount Television, now known as [[CBS Television Studios]] and worldwide distribution unit is now [[CBS Television Distribution]] and [[CBS Studios International]], in 2006, Simon & Schuster [except for Prentice Hall and other educational units, which Viacom sold to [[Pearson PLC]] in 1998, and what's left of the original Paramount Stations Group, now known as [[CBS Television Stations]]). National Amusements retains majority control of the two.

Together, these two companies own many of the former media assets of Gulf and Western and its Paramount successor today. Meanwhile, the Madison Square Garden properties (including Madison Square Gardens, the [[MSG Network]], Knicks and Rangers) were sold to [[Cablevision]] for $1.075 billion not long after the Viacom takeover.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=January 12, 1995|page=26|edition=61st anniversary|title=Sumner Redstone}}</ref> CBS retained ownership of the Paramount Parks chain for a few months after becoming part of the new CBS Corporation, but sold the parks to [[Cedar Fair]] in the summer of 2006, and thus National Amusements got out of the theme park ownership business entirely. Over the next few years, Cedar Fair purged references to Viacom-owned properties from the former Paramount Parks, a task completed in 2010. Viacom also sold its stake in the [[NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group|USA Networks]] to Universal in 1997, and the channels came under the ownership of Universal's successor, [[NBCUniversal]], which still retained those holdings as of late July 2013.

During this time period, Paramount Pictures went under the guidance of Jonathan Dolgen, chairman and [[Sherry Lansing]], president.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-17/business/fi-35287_1_sony-pictures |title=Viacom to Name Jonathan Dolgen New Paramount Studio Head : Hollywood: The Sony Pictures executive will oversee movie and TV operations in a deal that is expected to be announced today. – latimes |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=March 18, 1994 |access-date=August 8, 2015 |first=Alan |last=Citron}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherrylansingfoundation.org/page.php?whPage=lansing.php |title=The Sherry Lansing Foundation |publisher=The Sherry Lansing Foundation |access-date=August 8, 2015}}</ref> During their administration over Paramount, the studio had an extremely successful period of films with two of Paramount's ten highest-grossing films being produced during this period.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/studio/chart/?view=company&view2=allrovis&studio=paramount.htm |title=Box Office by Studio: Paramount|website=BoxOfficeMojo.com |access-date=January 7, 2010}}</ref> The most successful of these films, ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', a joint partnership with [[20th Century Fox]], and [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] became the highest-grossing film up to that time, grossing over $1.8&nbsp;billion worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=titanic.htm |title=Titanic|website=BoxOfficeMojo.com |date=March 15, 1998 |access-date=January 7, 2010}}</ref> Also during this time, three Paramount Pictures films won the [[Academy Award]] for Best Picture; ''Titanic, Braveheart'', and ''Forrest Gump''.

Paramount's most important property, however, was ''Star Trek''. Studio executives had begun to call it "the franchise" in the 1980s due to its reliable revenue, and other studios envied its "untouchable and unduplicatable" success. By 1998 ''Star Trek'' TV shows, movies, books, videotapes, and licensing provided so much of the studio's profit that "it is not possible to spend any reasonable amount of time at Paramount and not be aware of [its] presence"; filming for ''Star Trek: Voyager'' and ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' required up to nine of the largest of the studio's 36 [[sound stage]]s.<ref name="meehan2005">{{cite book |title=Why TV is not our fault: television programming, viewers, and who's really in control |last=Meehan |first=Eileen R. |year=2005 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEtw4yGRjwUC&q=%22star%20trek%22%20%22the%20franchise%22%20paramount&pg=PA93 |isbn=0-7425-2486-8}}</ref><ref name="poe1998">{{cite book |title=A Vision of the Future |last=Poe |first=Stephen Edward |year=1998 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-671-53481-5}}</ref>{{rp|49–50,54}}

In 1995, Viacom and [[Chris-Craft Industries]]' [[BHC Communications#United Television|United Television]] launched [[UPN|United Paramount Network]] (UPN) with ''Star Trek: Voyager'' as its flagship series, fulfilling Barry Diller's plan for a Paramount network from 25 years earlier. In 1999, Viacom bought out United Television's interests, and handed responsibility for the start-up network to the newly acquired [[CBS]] unit, which Viacom bought in 1999 – an ironic confluence of events as Paramount had once invested in CBS, and Viacom had once been the syndication arm of CBS as well.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Croteau|first1=David|last2=Hoynes|first2=William|title=The business of media : corporate media and the public interest|year=2006|publisher=Pine Forge|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=1-4129-1315-2|edition=2nd|page=85|chapter=3}}</ref> During this period the studio acquired some 30 TV stations to support the UPN network as well acquiring and merging in the assets of Republic Pictures, Spelling Television and Viacom Television, almost doubling the size of the studio's TV library. The TV division produced the dominant prime time show for the decade in ''Frasier'' as well as such long running hits as NCIS and ''Becker'' and the dominant prime time magazine show ''Entertainment Tonight.'' Paramount also gained the ownership rights to the [[Rysher Entertainment|Rysher]] library, after Viacom acquired the rights from [[Cox Enterprises]].

During this period, Paramount and its related subsidiaries and affiliates, operating under the name "Viacom Entertainment Group" also included the fourth largest group of theme parks in the United States and Canada which in addition to traditional rides and attractions launched numerous successful location-based entertainment units including a long running "Star Trek" attraction at the Las Vegas Hilton. Famous Music – the company's celebrated music publishing arm almost doubled in size and developed artists including Pink, Bush, Green Day as well as catalog favorites including Duke Ellington and Henry Mancini. The Paramount/Viacom licensing group under the leadership of [[Tom McGrath (media executive)|Tom McGrath]] created the "Cheers" franchise bars and restaurants and a chain of restaurants borrowing from the studio's Academy Award-winning film ''Forrest Gump'' – ''The Bubba Gump Shrimp Company''. Through the combined efforts of Famous Music and the studio over ten "Broadway" musicals were created including Irving Berlin's ''White Christmas'', ''Footloose, Saturday Night Fever'', [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''Sunset Boulevard'' among others. The company's international arm, United International Pictures (UIP), was the dominant distributor internationally for ten straight years representing Paramount, Universal and MGM. Simon and Schuster became part of the Viacom Entertainment Group emerging as the US' dominant trade book publisher.

In 2002, Paramount; along with [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Sony Pictures|Columbia TriStar Pictures Entertainment]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM/UA Entertainment]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]], [[DreamWorks Pictures]], [[Artisan Entertainment]], [[Lionsgate|Lions Gate Entertainment]], and [[Warner Bros.]] formed the [[Digital Cinema Initiatives]]. Operating under a waiver from the antitrust law, the studios combined under the leadership of Paramount Chief Operating Officer [[Tom McGrath (media executive)|Tom McGrath]] to develop technical standards for the eventual introduction of digital film projection – replacing the now 100-year-old film technology.<ref name="dcimovies.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.dcimovies.com/ |title=Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI) November&nbsp;20, 2008 ERRATA TO DCI DIGITAL CINEMA SYSTEM SPECIFICATION, VERSION 1.2 |publisher=Dcimovies.com |access-date=January 7, 2010}}</ref> DCI was created "to establish and document voluntary specifications for an open architecture for digital cinema that ensures a uniform and high level of technical performance, reliability and quality control."<ref name="dcimovies.com" /> McGrath also headed up Paramount's initiative for the creation and launch of the Blu-ray Disc.

====CBS/Viacom split====
Reflecting in part the troubles of the broadcasting business, in 2006 Viacom wrote off over $18&nbsp;billion from its radio acquisitions and, early that year, announced that it would split itself in two. The split was completed in January 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=Viacom's Big Bath|last=Higgins|first=John M.|author-link=John M.

With the announcement of the split of Viacom, Dolgen and Lansing were replaced by former television executives Brad Grey and Gail Berman.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hollywood Pioneer Lansing Is Poised to Exit Paramount|last=Eller|first=Claudia|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2004/nov/02/business/fi-paramount2 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 2, 2004|access-date=April 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Another Exec Quits Viacom in Shake-Up|last1=Hofmeister|first1=Sallie|last2=Eller|first2=Claudia|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2004/jun/03/business/fi-dolgen3|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 3, 2004|access-date=April 17, 2013}}</ref> The Viacom Inc. board split the company into [[CBS Corporation]] and a separate company under the [[Viacom (2005–2019)|Viacom]] name.

On December 11, 2005, the Paramount Motion Pictures Group announced that it had purchased [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] SKG (which was co-founded by former Paramount executive [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]]) in a deal worth $1.6&nbsp;billion. The announcement was made by [[Brad Grey]], chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures who noted that enhancing Paramount's pipeline of pictures is a "key strategic objective in restoring Paramount's stature as a leader in filmed entertainment."<ref>{{cite news |title=Paramount-Dreamworks deal finalised |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-02-02/paramount-dreamworks-deal-finalised/790778 |publisher=ABC News |date=February 3, 2006 |access-date=April 27, 2013}}</ref> The agreement does not include [[DreamWorks Animation]] SKG Inc., the most profitable part of the company that went public the previous year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Paramount Pictures Buys Dreamworks |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,178401,00.html |newspaper=foxnews.com/ Associated Press |date=December 12, 2005 |access-date=April 14, 2013}}</ref>

====History since 2006====
Grey also broke up the famous United International Pictures (UIP) international distribution company with 15 countries being taken over by Paramount or Universal by December 31, 2006 with the joint venture continuing in 20 markets. In Australia, Brazil, France, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand and the U.K., Paramount took over UIP. While in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain and Switzerland, Universal took over and Paramount would build its own distribution operations there. In 2007 and 2008, Paramount may sub-distribute films via Universal's countries and vice versa. Paramount's international distribution unit would be headquartered in Los Angeles and have a European hub.<ref name=bks>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Anne |title='End of an Era' for United International Pictures |url=https://www.backstage.com/news/end-of-an-era-for-united-international-pictures/ |access-date=May 16, 2019 |work=Backstage |date=September 7, 2005}}</ref> In Italy, Paramount distributed through Universal.<ref name=vty>{{cite news|title=Fox and Paramount Forge Unique Distribution Partnership in Italy|last=Vivarelli|first=Nick|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/global/fox-paramount-forge-distribution-partnership-italy-1202468799|work=Variety|date=June 16, 2017|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref> With Universal indicated that it was pulling out of the UIP Korea and started its own operation there in November 2016, Paramount agreed to have [[CJ Entertainment]] distribute there.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Whiteman |first1=Bobbie |title=CJ to carry Paramount pix for South Korea |url=https://variety.com/2006/film/features/cj-to-carry-paramount-pix-for-south-korea-1117954672/ |access-date=May 22, 2019 |work=Variety |date=November 29, 2006 |language=en}}</ref> UIP president and chief operating officer Andrew Cripps<ref name=bks/> was hired as Paramount Pictures International head.

On October 6, 2008, DreamWorks executives announced that they were leaving Paramount and relaunching an independent DreamWorks. The DreamWorks trademarks remained with DreamWorks Animation when that company was spun off before the Paramount purchase, and DreamWorks Animation transferred the license to the name to the new company.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/06/business/media/06dreamworks.html?ref=business |title=DreamWorks Executives Sever Ties With Paramount to Form a New Company |first=Michael|last=Cieply |work=The New York Times |date=October 6, 2008}}</ref>

DreamWorks films, acquired by Paramount but still distributed internationally by Universal, are included in Paramount's market share. Grey also launched a Digital Entertainment division to take advantage of emerging digital distribution technologies. This led to Paramount becoming the second movie studio to sign a deal with [[Apple Inc.]] to sell its films through the [[iTunes Store]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2014/02/paramount-pictures/ |title=Paramount Pictures |access-date=October 10, 2017}}</ref>

Also, in 2007, Paramount sold another one of its "heritage" units, [[Famous Music]], to [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] (best known for publishing many songs by [[The Beatles]], and for being co-owned by [[Michael Jackson]]), ending a nearly-eight-decade run as a division of Paramount, being the studio's music publishing arm since the period when the entire company went by the name "Famous Players."<ref>{{cite book|last=Garrett|first=Charles Hiroshi|title=The Grove Dictionary of American Music|date=January 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-531428-1|edition=Second}}</ref>

In early 2008, Paramount partnered with Los Angeles-based developer [[FanRocket]] to make short scenes taken from its film library available to users on Facebook. The application, called VooZoo, allows users to send movie clips to other Facebook users and to post clips on their profile pages.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nakashima |first=Ryan |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/2008-03-11-3376706485_x.htm |title=Facebook app lets users send movie clips |work=USA Today |date=March 11, 2008 |access-date=January 7, 2010}}</ref> Paramount engineered a similar deal with [[Makena Technologies]] to allow users of [[MTV|vMTV]] and [[There.com]] to view and send movie clips.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lang |first=Derrik J. |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2008-04-03-2435038588_x.htm |title=Paramount to open virtual movie vault |work=USA Today |date=April 3, 2008 |access-date=January 7, 2010}}</ref>

In July 2011, in the wake of critical and box office success of the animated feature, ''[[Rango (2011 film)|Rango]]'', and the departure of DreamWorks Animation upon completion of their distribution contract in 2012, Paramount announced the formation of [[Paramount Animation|a new division]], devoted to the creation of animated productions.<ref name=pa>{{cite news |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/07/06/paramount-pictures-animation/ |title=Riding high off the success of 'Rango,' Paramount Pictures to launch in-house animation division |first=Aly|last=Semigran |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> It marks Paramount's return to having its own animated division for the first time since 1967, when Paramount Cartoon Studios shut down (it was formerly [[Famous Studios]] until 1956).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonresearch.com/paramount.html |title=The Lost Popeye Titles |publisher=Cartoonresearch.com |date=May 24, 1941 |access-date=August 8, 2015}}</ref>

In July 2017, [[Paramount Players]] was formed by the studio with the hiring of Brian Robbins, founder of [[AwesomenessTV]], Tollin/Robbins Productions and Varsity Pictures, as the division's president.

== Investments ==
=== DreamWorks Pictures ===
In 2006, Paramount became the parent of [[DreamWorks Pictures]]. [[Soros Fund Management|Soros Strategic Partners]] and [[RatPac-Dune Entertainment|Dune Entertainment II]] soon afterwards acquired controlling interest in live-action films released through DreamWorks, with the release of ''[[Just Like Heaven (film)|Just Like Heaven]]'' on September 16, 2005. The remaining live-action films released until March 2006 remained under direct Paramount control. However, Paramount still owns distribution and other ancillary rights to Soros and Dune films.

On February 8, 2010, Viacom repurchased Soros' controlling stake in DreamWorks' library of films released before 2005 for around $400&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fixmer|first=Andy|title=Viacom Acquires Soros Stake in Films for $400 Million (Update3)|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a5_oOCdFObtM|access-date=February 7, 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|date=February 11, 2010}}</ref> Even as DreamWorks switched distribution of live-action films not part of existing franchises to [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]] and later [[Universal Pictures]], Paramount continues to own the films released before the merger, and the films that Paramount themselves distributed, including [[sequel]] rights such as that of ''[[Little Fockers]]'' (2010), distributed by Paramount and DreamWorks. It was a [[sequel]] to two existing [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] films, ''[[Meet the Parents]]'' (2000) and ''[[Meet the Fockers]]'' (2004). (Paramount only owned the international distribution rights to ''Little Fockers'', whereas [[Universal Pictures]] handled domestic distribution<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=meetthefockerssequel.htm |title=Box Office Mojo |website=Box Office Mojo |access-date=October 28, 2011}}</ref>).

Paramount also owned distribution rights to the [[DreamWorks Animation]] library of films made before 2013, and their previous distribution deal with future DWA titles expired at the end of 2012, with ''[[Rise of the Guardians]]''. [[20th Century Fox]] took over distribution for post-2012 titles beginning with ''[[The Croods]]'' (2013)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/08/exclusive-dreamworks-animation-to-fox/ |title=Dreamworks Animation to Fox for new 5-Year Distribution Deal |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=August 20, 2012 |access-date=September 25, 2012}}</ref> and ending with ''[[Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie]]'' (2017). Universal Pictures subsequently took over distribution for DreamWorks Animation's films beginning with ''[[How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World]]'' (2019) due to [[NBCUniversal]]'s acquisition of the company in 2016, though Paramount's rights to the 2006-2012 DWA library would've expired 16 years after each film's initial theatrical release date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/2013ar/Dreamworks_2013_Annual_Report.pdf|title=2013 Annual Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412002524/http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/2013ar/Dreamworks_2013_Annual_Report.pdf|archive-date=12 April 2019}}</ref> However, in July 2014, DreamWorks Animation purchased Paramount's distribution rights to the pre-2013 library, with 20th Century Fox distributing the library until January 2018, which Universal then assumed ownership of distribution rights.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alexandra|last=Cheney |url=https://variety.com/2014/biz/news/dreamworks-animation-q2-earnings-fall-short-of-estimates-1201271262/ |title=DreamWorks Animation Q2 Earnings Fall Short of Estimates, SEC Investigation Revealed |work=Variety |date=July 29, 2014 |access-date=August 8, 2015}}</ref>

Another asset of the former DreamWorks owned by Paramount is the pre-2008 [[DreamWorks Television]] library, which is currently distributed by Paramount's sister company [[CBS Television Distribution]]; it includes ''[[Spin City]]'', ''[[High Incident]]'', ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', ''[[Undeclared]]'' and ''[[On the Lot]]''.

=== CBS library ===
Independent company Hollywood Classics represents Paramount with the theatrical distribution of all the films produced by the various motion picture divisions of [[CBS]] over the years, as a result of the Viacom/CBS merger.

Paramount has outright video distribution to the aforementioned CBS library with some exceptions; less-demanded content is usually released manufactured-on-demand by CBS themselves or licensed to [[Visual Entertainment Inc.]] Until 2009, the video rights to ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' were with original theatrical distributor [[Warner Bros.]], under license from CBS (the video license to that film has now reverted to Paramount).

In March 2012, Paramount licensed their name and logo to a luxury hotel investment group which subsequently named the company Paramount Hotels and Resorts. The investors plan to build 50 hotels throughout the world based on the themes of Hollywood and the California lifestyle. Among the features are private screening rooms and the Paramount library available in the hotel rooms. In April 2013, Paramount Hotels and Dubai-based [[DAMAC Properties]] announced the building of the first resort: "DAMAC Towers by Paramount."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-14/paramount-hotels-resorts-plans-50-hollywood-themed-properties.html |title=Paramount Hotels & Resorts Plans 50 Hollywood-Themed Properties |first=Zainab|last=Fattah |date=May 14, 2012 |work=Bloomberg}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://travel.cnn.com/paramounts-first-movie-themed-resort-planned-dubai-288176 |title=Paramount's first resort under development in Dubai – CNN Travel |work=CNN}}</ref>

== Logo ==
[[File:DarioCampanile.Paramount.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Artist Dario Campanile poses with a picture Paramount commissioned him in 1986 to paint for its 75th anniversary. The company later used the painting as a basis for its new logo. That logo was introduced as a prototype in the 1986 film ''[[The Golden Child]]''; the 1987 film ''[[Critical Condition (film)|Critical Condition]]'' was the first to feature the finalized version of the logo. 1999's ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' was the first to use an enhanced version of the logo, which was last used on 2002's ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]''.]]

[[File:Paramount Pictures logo (2010).jpg|right|250px|thumb|For its 90th anniversary, Paramount adopted the logo shown here. In 2012, it was used in tandem with the current one. This picture shows the 2010 modification of the logo, which includes [[Viacom (2005–2019)|Viacom]]'s revised byline introduced in 2006. The first movie to use the revised Viacom byline was ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.]]

The distinctively pyramidal Paramount mountain has been the mainstay of the company's [[production logo]] since its inception and is the oldest surviving Hollywood film logo. In the sound era, the logo was accompanied by a fanfare called ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' after the film of the same name, released in 1930. The words to the fanfare, originally sung in the 1930 film, were "Proud of the crowd that will never be loud, it's Paramount on Parade."

Legend has it that the mountain is based on a doodle made by [[W. W. Hodkinson]] during a meeting with [[Adolph Zukor]]. It is said to be based on the memories of his childhood in [[Utah]]. Some claim that Utah's [[Ben Lomond Mountain (Utah)|Ben Lomond]] is the mountain Hodkinson doodled, and that Peru's [[Artesonraju]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150268/artesonraju.html |title=Artesonraju – Climbing, Hiking & Mountaineering |publisher=SummitPost |access-date=January 7, 2010}}</ref> is the mountain in the live-action logo, while others claim that the Italian side of [[Monte Viso|Monviso]] inspired the logo. Some editions of the logo bear a striking resemblance to the [[Pfeifferhorn]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.summitpost.org/trip-report/466312/wasatch-alpine-classic-north-ridge-pfeifferhorn-photo-trip-report-november-2008.html |title=Wasatch Alpine Classic |work=Summit Post |access-date=October 20, 2010}}</ref> another [[Wasatch Range]] peak, and to the [[Matterhorn]] on the border between [[Switzerland]] and [[Italy]]. [[Mount Huntington (Alaska)|Mount Huntington]] in Alaska also bears a striking resemblance.

The motion picture logo has gone through many changes over the years:
* The logo began as a somewhat indistinct charcoal rendering of the mountain ringed with superimposed stars. The logo originally had twenty-four stars, as a tribute to the then current system of contracts for actors, since Paramount had twenty-four stars signed at the time.
* In 1951, the logo was redesigned as a [[matte painting]] created by [[Jan Domela]].
* A newer, more realistic-looking logo debuted in 1953 for Paramount films made in 3D. It was reworked in early-to-mid 1954 for Paramount films made in [[widescreen]] process [[VistaVision]]. The text ''VistaVision – Motion Picture High Fidelity'' was often imposed over the Paramount logo briefly before dissolving into the [[title sequence]]. In early 1968, the text "A Paramount Picture/Release" was shortened to "Paramount", and the byline ''A Gulf+Western Company'' appeared on the bottom. The logo was given yet another modification in 1974, with the number of stars being reduced to 22, and the Paramount text and Gulf+Western byline appearing in different fonts.
* In September 1975, the logo was simplified in a shade of blue, adopting the modified design of the 1968 print logo, which was in use for many decades afterward. A version of the print logo had been in use by Paramount Television since 1968.
* The studio launched an entirely new logo in December 1986 with [[computer-generated imagery]] of a lake and stars. This version of the Paramount logo was designed by Dario Campanile and animated by Apogee, Inc; for this logo, the stars would move across the screen into the arc shape instead of it being superimposed over the mountain as it was before. A redone version of this logo debuted with ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', released on June 30, 1999.
* In March 2002, an updated logo was introduced in which shooting stars would fall from a night sky to form the arc while the Paramount logo would fly into place between them. An enhanced version of this logo debuted with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', released on May 7, 2010. The south col area of [[Mount Everest]] became the primary basis. The music is accompanied by ''Paramount on Parade''. This logo continued to be featured on DVD and Blu-ray releases with the [[Viacom (1952–2006)|first incarnation of Viacom]] byline until March 5, 2019, ending with ''[[Instant Family]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

==Film library==
{{Main|Lists of Paramount Pictures films}}
A few years after the ruling of the ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' case in 1948, Music Corporation of America ([[MCA Inc.|MCA]]) approached Paramount offering $50&nbsp;million for 750 sound feature films released prior to December 1, 1949 with payment to be spread over a period of several years. Paramount saw this as a bargain since the fleeting movie studio saw very little value in its library of old films at the time. To address any antitrust concerns, MCA set up [[EMKA, Ltd.]] as a dummy corporation to sell these films to television. EMKA's/Universal Television's library includes the five Paramount [[Marx Brothers]] films, most of the Bob Hope–Bing Crosby ''[[Road to...]]'' pictures, and other classics such as ''[[Trouble in Paradise (1932 film)|Trouble in Paradise]]'', ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'', ''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'', ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'', ''[[The Palm Beach Story]]'', ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', ''[[Double Indemnity]]'', ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'', and ''[[The Heiress]]''.

The studio has produced many critically acclaimed films such as<!--[[Wikipedia:Overlistification#Trivia and trivial lists|By this point forward, no more examples, this is way too much.]]--> ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'', ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', ''[[Braveheart]]'', ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', ''[[The Truman Show]]'', ''[[Mean Girls]]'', ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Rocketman (film)|Rocketman]]'', ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'', ''[[Days of Thunder]]'', ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[Nebraska (film)|Nebraska]]'', ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', ''[[Forrest Gump (film)|Forrest Gump]]'', ''[[Super 8 (2011 film)|Super 8]]'', ''[[Coming to America]]'', ''[[World War Z (film)|World War Z]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', ''[[The Conversation (film)|The Conversation]]'', ''[[The Fighter (2010 film)|The Fighter]]'', ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'', ''[[Team America: World Police|Team America]]'', ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'', ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' and ''[[A Quiet Place (film)|A Quiet Place]]''; as well as commercially successful franchises and/or properties such as: the ''[[The Godfather (film series)|Godfather]]'' films, ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', the ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' films, ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (Film)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', the ''[[Top Gun]]'' films, ''[[The Italian Job]]'', the ''[[Transformers (film series)|Transformers]]'' films, the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (film series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' films, the ''[[List of Tomb Raider media#Films|Tomb Raider]]'' films, the ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' films, the ''[[Cloverfield (franchise)|Cloverfield]]'' films, the ''[[G.I.

== Controversy ==
On July 31, 2018, Paramount was targeted by the [[National Hispanic Media Coalition]] and the National Latino Media Council, which have both claimed that the studio has the worst track record of hiring Latino and Hispanic talent both in front of and behind the camera (the last Paramount film directed by a Spanish director was ''[[Rings (2017 film)|Rings]]'' in 2017). In response to the controversy, Paramount released the statement: "We recently met with NHMC in a good faith effort to see how we could partner as we further drive Paramount's culture of diversity, inclusion, and belonging. Under our new leadership team, we continue to make progress — including ensuring representation in front of and behind the camera in upcoming films such as ''[[Dora and the Lost City of Gold|Dora the Explorer]]'', ''[[Instant Family]],'' ''[[Bumblebee (film)|Bumblebee]],'' and ''[[Like a Boss (film)|Limited Partners]]'' – and welcome the opportunity to build and strengthen relationships with the Latino creative community further."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/latino-representation-paramount-pictures-film-nlmc-nhmc-1202436979/|title=Paramount Responds To Latino Leaders' Boycott Call Over "Dismal" Hiring Of Latinos In Films – Update|last=Robb|first=David|magazine=Deadline Hollywood|date=July 31, 2018|access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-paramount-diversity-20180801-story.html|title=Paramount says it is making progress on Latino representation after criticism|author=David NG|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 1, 2018|access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/07/paramount-pictures-boycott-latino-groups-studio-representation-1201989645/|title=Paramount Pictures Boycott Called for By Latino Groups Claiming Studio Has Worst Recent Representation Track Record|last=Marotta|first=Jenna|work=IndieWire|date=July 31, 2018|access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref>

The NHMC protested at the Paramount Pictures lot on August 25. More than 60 protesters attended, while chanting "Latinos excluded, time to be included!". NHMC president and CEO Alex Nogales vowed to continue the boycott until the studio signed a memorandum of understanding.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/paramount-targeted-by-hispanic-protestors-over-dismal-hiring-record-1202452258/|title=Paramount Targeted By Hispanic Protestors Over "Dismal" Hiring Record|last=Robb|first=David|magazine=Deadline Hollywood|date=August 25, 2018|access-date=August 25, 2018}}</ref>
