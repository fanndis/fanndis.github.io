During the release of "[[Judas (Lady Gaga song)|Judas]]", the second single from ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'', Lady Gaga confirmed in an interview that she would embark on a [[concert tour]] in 2012, which would visit Latin American countries for the first time, like Brazil, and would return to Mexico.<ref name="caracol 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.noticiascaracol.com/entretenimiento/musica/video-217515-lady-gaga-revela-detalles-de-su-gira-latinoamerica|title=Lady Gaga revela detalles de su gira por Latinoamérica|date=January 31, 2012|accessdate=February 8, 2012|language=es|work=[[Noticias Caracol]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103210902/http://www.noticiascaracol.com/entretenimiento/musica/video-217515-lady-gaga-revela-detalles-de-su-gira-latinoamerica|archive-date=November 3, 2012}}</ref> In November 2011, producer DJ White Shadow asserted that Gaga was "doing [preparations] for the next round of touring", adding that the singer's main objective in the following year was to continue preparing for the Born This Way Ball, as well as create new songs for her next studio album.<ref name=mtv>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1675019/lady-gaga-next-album-tour.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga 'Doing Prep' For Tour, Next Album|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|publisher=[[MTV News]].

He opined, "This album was the most personal [because of] the amount of detail that went into this record, the amount of passion [and] emotion from her and the team. Every song was a story towards the [[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]] theme.

==Concert synopsis==
[[File:Highway Unicorn Milan.JPG|thumb|left|Lady Gaga opening the show with the performance of "Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)" atop a fully puppeteered horse]]
The show is set in and around a large medieval style castle, known as the "Kingdom of Fame" which rotates and manoeuvres throughout the show. A classical score accompanies the show's interludes, tying in with the show's dark, operatic theme. The show began with "Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)" accompanied by an extended intro, which Gaga performed while atop a fully puppeteer-ed horse, with a mechanical look, built by [[The Jim Henson Company]], out of the three-story medieval castle prop.<ref name=stuffnz>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/music/gig-reviews/7063477/Review-Lady-Gaga-at-Vector|title=Review: Lady Gaga at Vectors|first=Bridget|last=Jones|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate=June 12, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328171300/http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/13/showbiz/lady-gaga-surgery|archive-date=March 28, 2013}}</ref> After the song, the stage went dark and spotlights were shone across the stage with a helicopter sound being played. The audience then hears "Mother G.O.A.T." speak for the first time stating that "alien fugitive Lady Gaga has escaped" and that "Operation: Kill the Bitch", is in order. Gaga comes out in an alien costume and sings "[[Government Hooker]]", in which she "seduces" a dancer who is dressed in a suit before killing him and leaving the stage. Gaga's dancers then reenact the birth scene akin to that in "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]", as the singer moans and simulates giving birth after coming out of the zipper-like vagina of a large, inflatable body.<ref name=nzz>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=10811877|title=Review: Lady Gaga II, passion in the cheap seats|first=Damien|last=Grant|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=June 9, 2012|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}</ref><ref name=ising>{{cite web|url=http://events.insing.com/feature/concert-review-lady-gaga-born-this-way-ball/id-3a4d3f00|title=Concert Review: Lady Gaga Born This Way Ball|first=Zaki|last=Jufri|publisher=iSing|date=May 29, 2012|accessdate=June 12, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531235607/http://events.insing.com/feature/concert-review-lady-gaga-born-this-way-ball/id-3a4d3f00|archive-date=May 31, 2012}}</ref>

After "Black Jesus + Amen Fashion" and "Bloody Mary" an interlude commences and recites the opening dialogue of the music video of "Born This Way".<ref name=yahooz/> For "[[Bad Romance]]", Gaga arrives on the stage inside a vessel. Following the song, she escapes to the top of the castle and sings "[[Judas (Lady Gaga song)|Judas]]", before escaping and performing "Fashion of His Love" and "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]". During "[[LoveGame]]", a clear bathtub built on the stage inside which it is sung. After a speech from Gaga, thanking the audience for coming to her show, "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]" is performed with the original choreography. An interlude follows, with Mother G.O.A.T. describing "Gaga's take over of planet earth". "Heavy Metal Lover" is performed next and Gaga appears laying atop across the body of a motor-"[[tricycle]]" with her arms in two slots, a recreation of the album cover. Gaga drives around the Monster Pit followed by choreography for the last chorus of the song. After "Bad Kids" an acoustic section follows with songs like "[[Hair (Lady Gaga song)|Hair]]", "Princess Die" and "[[You and I (Lady Gaga song)|You and I]]". The section concludes with "[[Electric Chapel]]" with a display of flashing lights before Gaga leaves the stage.

[[File:Lady Gaga Alejandro meat couch.jpg|thumb|Gaga sitting on a "meat couch" during "[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]" ]]
After a Spanish guitar intro, she then returns in a recreation of the meat dress and performs "[[Americano (song)|Americano]]". "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" is performed next and at the end of the song Gaga is lowered into a meat grinder. A moment later she emerges from the stage sitting on a meat couch and performs "[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]" with her gun bra and green trousers. The castle closes along an interlude and blue lights. Mother G.O.A.T. flies around the castle lip-syncing the words to the first verse of "[[Paparazzi (Lady Gaga song)|Paparazzi]]" until Gaga returns to kill her with her new disco stick. Gaga then gives a speech about how there are no boundaries in music, and then performs "[[Scheiße (song)|Scheiße]]". After the song the stage goes black. Moments later she returns in a tower singing "[[The Edge of Glory]]" and the last song, "[[Marry the Night]]". When the song ends, she and her dancers are lowered off stage and the castle goes dark.

===North America===

Reviews of the North American leg were mostly positive.

Other North American reviews were more critical. Emily Zemler of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the Los Angeles show a mixed review, writing: "The music was, at best, secondary to the grab-bag, highly produced performance...

Not that Gaga's mission of inclusion, tolerance, love and empowerment is anything but positive and necessary – but a drawn-out monologue repeatedly making the point that no one should give a f-k in the face of criticism only restated what is already in the lyrics."<ref>[https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/Concert+review+Lady+Gaga+Bell+Centre+2013/7952116/story.html Lady Gaga more Cirque than rock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215060626/http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/Concert%20review%20Lady%20Gaga%20Bell%20Centre%202013/7952116/story.html |date=February 15, 2013 }}</ref>

Both Russian dates sold out in hours.

Despite the worldwide commercial success of the tour, it was not very well received by the South American market. In [[Colombia]], some tickets were sold at half of their original price to increase ticket sales.

The North American leg of the tour additionally experienced strong ticket sales. By the time the final 21 dates of the tour had been canceled on February 13, the entire leg had been nearly sold out. Had the entire leg been completed, the tour would have topped $200 million in ticket sales and finished as one of the top fifteen [[list of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing tours of all time]]. The cancellation of the last 21 dates resulted in refunds of over $25 million and 200,000 tickets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/15/lady-gaga-tour-cancellation-cost-millions_n_2695195.html|title=Lady Gaga Tour Cancellation Will Cost Millions|first=Kia|last=Makarechi|work=The Huffington Post|date=February 15, 2013|accessdate=February 15, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304215112/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/15/lady-gaga-tour-cancellation-cost-millions_n_2695195.html|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>
With more than twenty dates left, Gaga was forced to cancel the remaining tour dates due to sustaining a hip injury that required surgery. With the dates of the tour that were successfully completed, Gaga grossed more than $160 million.

==Controversies==

The South Asian part of the tour was the subject of some controversy due to its denunciation by social conservatives. Gaga's support for [[LGBT rights]], the supposed indecency of her shows, and religious content in her lyrics led some conservative Christian and Muslim groups in South Korea, the Philippines, and Indonesia to call for the cancellation of the concerts.<ref name="Kabling">{{cite news|title=Palace Will Not Block Lady Gaga's Concert|date=May 20, 2012|author=Genalyn D.

Several conservative political commentators denounced The Born This Way Ball shortly after the conception of the tour. In May 2012, Gaga sparked an online uproar, particularly in the city of Bangkok when she [[Twitter|tweeted]]: "I just landed in Bangkok baby! Ready for 50,000 screaming Thai monsters. I wanna get lost in a lady market and buy fake [[Rolex]]."  Several of Gaga's fans felt that the tweet was racist and viewed it as a negative [[stereotype]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Lady Gaga angers Thai fans with fake Rolex comment|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2012/05/24/lady-gaga-thailand-fake-rolex.html|publisher=[[CBS]]|accessdate=June 18, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618035600/http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2012/05/24/lady-gaga-thailand-fake-rolex.html|archive-date=June 18, 2012}}</ref> The following month, weeks after her concert in Thailand, several members of the country filed a public lawsuit against Gaga for misuse of the Thailand flag. The complaints came from when Gaga while wearing an accessorized and provocative bikini costume with and a traditional Thai headdress, rode a motorcycle across the stage with a Thai flag tied to it. Government officials in the country deemed the act as "not appropriate" and felt that it "hurt the feelings of Thai People".<ref>{{cite news|title=Lady Gaga's Thai concert inspires formal complaint Culture ministry critical of her use of country's flag|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2012/06/15/gaga-thailand-complaint.html|publisher=[[CBS]]|accessdate=June 18, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618040208/http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2012/06/15/gaga-thailand-complaint.html|archive-date=June 18, 2012}}</ref>

Gaga caused more controversy after her performance of June 27 in Melbourne, where she debuted a new song called "Princess Die", about suicide and mental illness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hear Lady Gaga's New Suicide Song "Princess Die|url=http://idolator.com/6664531/lady-gaga-princess-die-suicide|work=Idolator|accessdate=July 2, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103081853/http://idolator.com/6664531/lady-gaga-princess-die-suicide|archive-date=January 3, 2013}}</ref> The song's lyrics, including lines such as "I wish that I was strong/I wish that I was wrong/I wish that I could cope/but I took pills and left a note" were slammed as "distasteful" by suicide charities, who feared the message about the suicide that the song portrayed. Chris Wagner of [[Lifeline (crisis support service)|Lifeline]], an international crisis support service, stated, "Lifeline is very concerned about the nature of the song, particularly as it clearly describes the method of suicide and talks in depth about suicide. It doesn't actually have any message of hope, of help seeking, or anything of a positive nature whatsoever."<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga slammed after launching suicide song Princess Die that has Princess Diana death lyrics at Melbourne concert|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/lady-gaga-slammed-after-launching-suicide-song-princess-die-that-has-princess-diana-death-lyrics-at-melbourne-concert/story-e6frewyr-1226411294968|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=July 2, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220212256/http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/lady-gaga-slammed-after-launching-suicide-song-princess-die-that-has-princess-diana-death-lyrics-at-melbourne-concert/story-e6frewyr-1226411294968|archive-date=December 20, 2012}}</ref> The song's references to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] and [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|her death]] also caused offense and outrage, despite Gaga attempting to distance herself from such controversy by clearly spelling out the name of the song during her concert.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga courts controversy with suicide song, Princess Die, at Melbourne concert|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/music/lady-gaga-courts-controversy-with-suicide-song-princess-die/story-e6frf9hf-1226411053311|work=[[Herald Sun]]|accessdate=July 2, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328171300/http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/13/showbiz/lady-gaga-surgery|archive-date=March 28, 2013}}</ref>
