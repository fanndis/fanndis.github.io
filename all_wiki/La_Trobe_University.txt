'''La Trobe University''' is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] based in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. Its flagship campus is located in the Melbourne suburb of [[Bundoora, Victoria|Bundoora]]. The university was established in 1964, becoming the third university in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and the twelfth university in Australia. La Trobe is one of the Australian [[verdant universities]] and also part of the [[Innovative Research Universities]] group.

La Trobe's original and principal campus is located in the Melbourne metropolitan area, within the northern Melbourne suburb of Bundoora. It is the largest metropolitan campus in the country, occupying over {{convert|267|ha|acre}}.<ref>La Trobe University, [https://www.latrobe.edu.au/handbook/2014/required/about-latrobe/the-university.htm "University Handbook 2014"], La Trobe University website, Accessed 20 January 2015.</ref> It has two other major campuses located in the regional Victorian city of [[Bendigo]] and the twin border cities of [[Albury-Wodonga]]. There are two smaller regional campuses in [[Mildura]] and [[Shepparton]] and a city campus in Melbourne's [[Central business district|CBD]] on [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]] and in Sydney on [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]].

La Trobe offers [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] courses across its two colleges of Arts, Social Science and Commerce (ASSC) and Science, Health and Engineering (SHE).

In 2015, it was ranked in the top 100 universities under 50 by the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]].<ref>[https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2015/one-hundred-under-fifty "100 Under 50 Rankings 2015 results"], ''Times Higher Education'' website, 2015, Accessed 9 June 2015.</ref> In the 2021 [[QS World University Rankings]], it was ranked in the top 300 universities for arts and humanities.

==History==

The university was established in 1964 following the assent of the ''La Trobe University Act'' by Victorian Parliament on 9 December 1964. The passing of the Act of [[Parliament of Victoria|Victorian Parliament]] to establish La Trobe University followed earlier University Acts to establish the [[University of Melbourne]] (1853) and [[Monash University]] (1958).<ref name="Gregory"/>{{Rp|3}} The Minister of Education at the time and the appointed planning council were "unanimous in their enthusiasm that the new institution should be innovative in its approach",<ref name="Marshall">Marshall, A.S.(1979), 'La Trobe University: The Vision and the Reality', Centre for Comparative and International Education: School of Education: La Trobe University. La Trobe University Library, Bundoora (Victoria), p.1.</ref> and the university adopted an academic structure based on schools of studies (rather than on faculties) and a collegiate format, where a large number of students lived on campus. At this time, [[Flinders University]] and [[Macquarie University]] were also establishing a schools-based system.

Many prominent Victorians were involved in La Trobe's establishment process, and there was a strong belief that it was important to increase research and learning in Victoria. One of the major individuals involved was [[Davis McCaughey]], who later became [[Governor of Victoria]]. The university was named after [[Charles Joseph La Trobe]], the first Governor of Victoria, and the university motto, 'whoever seeks shall find', is adapted from Charles La Trobe's family motto.<ref name="Gregory"/>{{rp|3}} The La Trobe University [[Coat of Arms]] incorporates the scallop shells from the La Trobe family bearings, the Australian wedge-tailed eagle to represent Australia, and sprigs of heath to represent Victoria.<ref>[https://www.latrobe.edu.au/about/history "Our History, La Trobe University"]. La Trobe University. Retrieved 17 June 2009.</ref>

=== Origins===

The origins of La Trobe can be traced back to the post-World War II era where there emerged a global recognition of the need to increase facilities for higher education.{{#tag:ref|'In Britain, the [[Robbins Committee]] reported in 1963 on the need for the expansion of tertiary education in that country. During the 1950s in the United States, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] moved with great speed in establishing a grand plan to vastly expand facilities for higher education including many new universities.'<ref name="Glenn"/>{{rp|21}}|group=Note}} In 1957 Prime Minister [[Sir Robert Menzies]] established a special committee to report on the future of [[Australian universities]], inviting Sir [[Keith Murray, Baron Murray of Newhaven|Keith Murray]], Chairman of the University Grants Committee of Great Britain, to chair it. The Murray Committee, in a far-reaching report submitted in September 1957, recommend a major expansion of university facilities in Australia and changes in administration and financing.<ref name="Glenn"/>{{rp|21}}

As a direct consequence of the key recommendations of the Murray report, the [[Australian Federal Government|federal government]] established the Australian Universities Commission (AUC) in 1959, appointing Sir [[Leslie H. Martin| Leslie Martin]] as its chair.<ref name="Glenn"/>{{rp|21}} Menzies appointed Martin to chair a special committee in 1961 to report to the AUC on the rapidly increasing demands for higher education in Australia.<ref name="Glenn"/>{{rp|21}} In August 1963 it released its second report, which recognised the urgency of Victoria's situation "...the resources of [[University of Melbourne|Melbourne]] and [[Monash University|Monash]] Universities are not likely to meet the long-term demands for university education beyond 1966. The Commission therefore is willing to support in the 1964–1966 triennium the extension of university facilities in the Melbourne metropolitan area."<ref name="Glenn"/>{{rp|21–22}} Following the recommendations the federal government passed the Universities Assistance Bill in October 1963, providing a grant for a "third" university for recurrent expenditure in 1965 of $106,000 and $210,000 in 1966. The first capital grant was for 1966 and amounted to $1,000,000. These grants were to be matched by equivalent state grants.<ref name="Glenn"/>{{rp|21–22}}

===Establishment===

==== Third University Committee ====

In April 1964, Sir [[Archibald Glenn]] was invited by the Victorian premier, Sir [[Henry Bolte]], to chair a "Third University Committee".<ref name="Glenn"/>{{rp|23}} In addition to Glen, 13 other members were announced on 21 May 1964. The committee, therefore, consisted of:<ref name="autogenerated189">{{cite book |year=1989 |chapter=Appendix A |editor=William J. Breen |title=Building La Trobe University: Reflections on the first 25 years 1964–1989 |isbn=1-86324-003-9 |location=Melbourne |publisher=La Trobe University Press |pages=189–190 |hdl=1959.9/201803}}</ref>
* Sir Archibald Glenn, [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Engineers Australia|AMIE Aust.]], [[Institution of Chemical Engineers|MIChemE]], Chairman and Managing Director, [[Orica#History|ICI Australia Ltd]], ''Chairman''
* F. H. Brookes, Assistant Director of Education, Victoria
* Sir John Buchan [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], Architect and Chairman, Buchan, Laird & Buchan
* Sir Michael Chamberlin, [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], Deputy Chancellor, [[Monash University]]
* Sir [[Thomas MacFarland Cherry|Thomas Cherry]] [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science|FAA]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], President, [[Australian Academy of Science]] 1961-65
* [[Kathleen Fitzpatrick (Australian academic)|Kathleen Fitzpatrick]], formerly Associate Professor of History, [[University of Melbourne]]
* J. A. Hepburn, Chief Planner, [[Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works]]
* Ethleen King [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], President of the Free Kindergarten Union and former President of the [[National Council of Women of Australia|National Council of Women]]
* [[Phillip Law]] [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], Director of the Antarctic Division, [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of External Affairs]]
* C. E. Newman [[Military Cross|MC]], solicitor, Numurkah, Victoria
* J. D. Norgard, General Manager (Operations), [[BHP Billiton|BHP Co. Ltd]]
* W. C. Radford [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]], Director, [[Australian Council for Educational Research]]
* R. Selby Smith [[Order of Australia|AM]], Professor of Education, Monash University, and Principal of [[Scotch College (Melbourne)|Scotch College]], Melbourne, 1953–64
* Russel G. French, secretary of the committee

The terms of reference of the committee were to advise the government on all matters concerning the establishment of a third Victorian university. This consisted of "the selection of the site, the preparation of a detailed development program, planning and calling tenders for buildings, the formulating of an administrative structure, the appointment of an Academic Planning Board and the recruitment of key staff." It was planned that La Trobe would enrol students, if possible, in March 1967.<ref name="Glenn"/>{{rp|23}}

==== Selecting the site ====

The first meeting of the committee occurred on 2 June 1964 in the rooms of the [[Royal Historical Society of Victoria|Historical Society of Victoria]] on [[Victoria Street, Melbourne|Victoria Street]]. From there, they acted promptly in seeking out a suitable metropolitan location, inspecting 27 sites from a list of 57 possibilities.{{#tag:ref|"A number of these prospects were the result of submissions by local councils and other interested groups"<ref name="Glenn"/>{{rp|23}}|group=Note}}

The main constraints facing all options were area - "adequate for a full and balanced university"; cost - preferably [[Crown land|Crown owned land]], as private land would require large compensation payments; and locality - somewhere reasonably close to the demographic centre of Melbourne (calculated to be in the [[Camberwell, Victoria|Camberwell]] area) and to public transport.<ref name="Gregory"/>{{rp|5}}

A subcommittee, headed by [[Phillip Law]], quickly recognised that "somewhere on the eastern side of Melbourne stands out as the right location", however, [[Monash University|Monash]] was already growing in the southeastern suburbs so an alternative area was sought.<ref name="Gregory"/>{{rp|5}} An early list of possibilities read:

''Outer'' - [[Bundoora]], [[Lilydale, Victoria|Lilydale]].
''Inner'' - [[Burnley College (Australia)|Burnley Horticultural College]], [[Wattle Park, Melbourne|Wattle Park]], [[Caulfield Racecourse]], [[Kew Asylum|Kew Mental Asylum]]<ref name="Gregory"/>{{rp|6}}

Selection of an inner site was unlikely, as they were mostly "either inadequate or unattainable, especially the racecourse", however, the Kew site was a real possibility.<ref name="Gregory"/>{{rp|6}}

The "ultimate choice" was unanimously agreed upon by the end of July, resulting in the farm attached to the [[Mont Park Asylum]]. Cunningham Dax, head of the Mental Health Authority, was "most co-operative", although he raised concerns that the loss of the farm would be serious for the hospital. An alternative site for the farm was procured a little further out on Plenty Road, resolving the issue.<ref name="Glenn"/>{{rp|23}}

==== Naming the university ====

While it was an interesting interpretation of a "local name", [[Charles La Trobe|La Trobe]], proposed by [[Kathleen Fitzpatrick (Australian academic)|Fitzpatrick]],<ref>Davies, Susan (1995). "Kathleen Fitzpatrick: Sculptor with Words". In Macintyre, Stuart; Thomas, Julian. The Discovery of Australian History: 1890–1939. Carlton South: Melbourne University Press. pp. 158–173. {{ISBN|0-522-84699-8}}.</ref> was agreed unanimously upon by the planning committee after some alternatives, such as [[Alfred Deakin|Deakin]], were "thoughtfully put aside".{{#tag:ref|"[P]robably the most distinguished name among Victorians born in Victoria".<ref name="Gregory"/>{{rp|6}}|group=Note}} [[Parliament of Victoria|Victorian State Parliamentarians]], however, were far from unanimous when they came to debate the La Trobe University Bill.{{#tag:ref|"'redolent of the [[Folies Bergère]] and prurient Parisian life' complained one who, perhaps more seriously, proposed '[[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]' as an alternative."<ref name="Gregory"/>|group=Note}}

Sir [[Archibald Glenn]], chairman of the committee, provided a concise summary as to why La Trobe was chosen:

"Lieutenant-Governor Charles Joseph La Trobe has great historic significance for [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and his name is recognised internationally. La Trobe was not a university man...{{#tag:ref|'La Trobe enrolled at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College at Cambridge]] but it is doubtful whether he ever attended a lecture'.<ref>C J La Trobe Society, '[http://www.latrobesociety.org.au/LaTrobe2.html Early Life]', The C J La Trobe Society [website], accessed 7 January 2015.</ref>|group=Note}} but he appears to have had almost every quality, one would desire in one. He had a lively interest in every aspect of life of the community, the will to work for the good of other men, and a sense of responsibility towards prosperity.'<ref name="Glenn"/>{{rp|24}}

The Victorian Minister for Education, Sir John Bloomfield, upon presenting the enabling bill to the [[Victorian parliament]], reflected on the influence of Charles La Trobe in the foundation of the [[University of Melbourne]] over a 100 years before, concluding "my most satisfying reflection at this moment is that my father's father sought for gold in our hills, and he knew this city in the days of the man whom, at the behest of others, I am now trying to acknowledge. If Providence and this Parliament will it, my son's son may be taught in his aura and tradition."<ref name="Simpson">{{cite book |author=Roy Simpson |year=1989 |chapter=The Master Plan |editor=William J. Breen |title=Building La Trobe University: Reflections on the first 25 years 1964–1989 |isbn=1-86324-003-9 |location=Melbourne |publisher=La Trobe University Press |pages=39–49 |hdl=1959.9/201726}}</ref>{{rp|39–40}}

Although La Trobe, like his [[Christian Ignatius Latrobe|father]], used "La Trobe" and "Latrobe" interchangeably,<ref name="Reilly_Armstrong">See Reilly, Diane and Armstrong, Helen, '[http://www.latrobesociety.org.au/LaTrobeana/LaTrobeanaV12n3.pdf#Page=16 The Latrobe/La Trobe Family Name]', La Trobeana, 12/3 (2013), 31-32, accessed 15 January 2015.</ref> the committee selected the spelling that was predominantly used by his side of the family.<ref name="Reilly_Armstrong"/>

==== Interim council ====

Following the passing of the ''La Trobe University Act'', the interim council was established in December 1964. Aside from Sir Michael Chamberlin and Kathleen Fitzpatrick, who indicated they were unavailable, all members of the Third University Committee were appointed to the interim council, with Sir Archibald Glenn remaining as chairman.<ref name="autogenerated189"/> Additional members of the interim council were:

* [[Keith Aickin]] QC, barrister
* [[Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet]] [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians|FRACP]], [[Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians|FRCP]], [[List of Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science|FAA]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], Nobel Prize for Medicine 1960, Professor of Experimental Medicine and Director of the [[Walter and Eliza Hall Institute]], President, [[Australian Academy of Science]] 1965-69
* J. Andrews, Professor of Geography, [[University of Melbourne]],{{#tag:ref|Appointed to Interim Council in May 1965<ref name="autogenerated189"/>|group=Note}}  
* [[Bernard Callinan]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Engineers Australia|MIEAust.]], Consulting Engineer and Commissioner of [[State Electricity Commission of Victoria|SEC]].
* [[Michael Clarke (Australian politician)|Michael Clarke]], representing [[Northern Province (Victoria)|Northern Province]], [[Victorian Legislative Council]]
* [[John Galbally]], barrister, representing [[Melbourne North Province|Melbourne North]] and Opposition Leader, Victorian Legislative Council
* [[Davis McCaughey]], Master of [[Ormond College]], [[University of Melbourne]]
* [[Joe Rafferty (politician)|J. A. Rafferty]], representing [[Electoral district of Ormond|Ormond]], [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]]
* Peter Thwaites, Principal of [[Geelong College]]
* David Myers, [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|MIEE]], [[Institution of Chemical Engineers|MIEAust]], [[Institute of Physics|FInstP]], Vice-Chancellor (''ex officio''). {{#tag:ref|Became a member on taking up appointment of 1 September 1965.<ref name="autogenerated189"/>|group=Note}}

Sir Thomas Cherry died late in 1966, prior to the final meeting of the Interim Council.<ref name="autogenerated189"/> All other members automatically became members of council upon its establishment with the first meeting held on 19 December 1966. It was this meeting that Sir Archibald was elected as chancellor of the university.<ref name="autogenerated189"/>

=== La Trobe eras ===

The concept of the "La Trobe eras" was first coined by William Breen and John Salmond in the university's 25th anniversary history, ''Building La Trobe University: Reflections on the first 25 years 1964–1989''. It is used to refer to La Trobe in periods of 25 years, following the year of establishment in 1964 rather than the year of opening in 1967.{{#tag:ref|"This year (1989) will mark not just the first quarter century but the end of the first era of La Trobe's history. It is likely that the second era will witness the emergence of a very different institution, much larger, much more diverse in its offerings, and catering to a broader range of student needs than in the past."<ref>{{cite book |year=1989 |chapter=Introduction |editor=William J. Breen |title=Building La Trobe University: Reflections on the first 25 years 1964–1989 |isbn=1-86324-003-9 |location=Melbourne |publisher=La Trobe University Press |pages=xi–xii |hdl=1959.9/201803}}</ref>|group=Note}} As of 2015, La Trobe is currently in its third era.

=== First era: 1964–1989 ===

[[File:Martin building, autumn 2.jpg|thumb|right|Martin Building in autumn.]]
La Trobe University was officially opened by the Victorian premier, Sir [[Henry Bolte]], on 8 March 1967 at a ceremony that was attended by a number of dignitaries including former [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[Robert Menzies]].<ref name="Myers">{{cite book |author=David M. Myers |year=1989 |chapter=The First Decade |editor=William J. Breen |title=Building La Trobe University: Reflections on the first 25 years 1964–1989 |isbn=1-86324-003-9 |location=Melbourne |publisher=La Trobe University Press |pages=31–38 |hdl=1959.9/201719}}</ref>{{rp|31}} Teaching commenced at the Bundoora campus in the first semester of that year, with some 500 students.<ref name="Gregory"/>{{rp|3}} La Trobe was seen to be unique amongst Australian universities due to its school-based and collegiate structure. At the time, "this novel approach became commonly known in the university as 'The La Trobe Concept'".<ref>Henry, M. (1971) "La Trobe: a study of the idea of a university". Sociology Department: School of Social Sciences: La Trobe University. La Trobe University Library, Bundoora (Victoria).</ref> Within four years, however, this format had all but broken down, with the collegiate ideal reduced to halls of residence and the schools becoming departmentalised.<ref name="Marshall"/>

Up until the late 1980s, La Trobe focused almost exclusively on the [[liberal arts]] and science.{{cn|date=October 2020}} In 1987 the '''Lincoln Institute of Health Sciences''' merged with the university. The Lincoln Institute had begun as Lincoln House, after the building was bought by the government in 1966, with its formal constitution being established in December 1972. Lincoln House comprised professional training schools for [[occupational therapy]], [[physiotherapy]] and [[speech therapy]], all of which were affiliated with the Victoria Institute of Colleges.<ref name=li>{{cite web | title=Lincoln Institute of Health Sciences | website=Research Data Australia | url=https://researchdata.edu.au/lincoln-institute-health-sciences/492421 | access-date=8 October 2020}}</ref> Lincoln Institute thus became the university's Faculty of Health Sciences, offering several professional health science programs.

=== Second era: 1990–2014 ===

The university established other professional schools, including its law school in 1992, which was previously a legal studies department which was established in 1972. In 2008, Victoria's second dentistry school was established at La Trobe. However, despite being a leading Australian university in professional health and biomedical sciences, La Trobe does not have a medical school. When planned and developed in the 1960s, there was strong expectation that La Trobe would eventually establish a medical school and a teaching hospital.<ref>{{cite book|last=La Trobe University|title=La Trobe University Handbooks|year=1967–1970|publisher=Jonker Printing Pty Ltd|location=Bundoora, Victoria}}</ref>

The Bendigo campus of La Trobe dates back to 1873: the Bendigo College of Advanced Education amalgamated with La Trobe University in 1991, completing a process that began in the late 1980s as part of the [[Dawkins reforms]] to higher education. During the merger process, a controversial issue erupted when the university's head office in Bundoora raised concerns about the academic standards at Bendigo CAE. This led to a public outcry in which Bendigo CAE students threatened the ''Bendigo Advertiser'' over publishing the matter in its newspapers. Several newspapers were burned in the protest.

The inclusion of the Wodonga Institute of Tertiary Education took place in the same year. The university has continued to expand, with the opening of the Research and Development Park at Bundoora and the upcoming opening of a second Melbourne CBD site.

====Funding and cutbacks====
Higher education reforms by the [[John Howard|Howard government]] allowed Australian universities to increase fees and take in a greater number of full-fee paying students. Despite a large student backlash, La Trobe took advantage of the reforms, increasing fees by 25% in 2005.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/01/1078117370918.html La Trobe latest to lift HECS fees] ''The Age''. Retrieved 03/08/2009.</ref> Around the same time, the university suffered cutbacks in government funding,<ref name="funding1">[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/la-trobe-cutbacks-alarm-staff/2008/05/20/1211182801432.html La Trobe cutbacks alarm staff] ''The Age''. Retrieved 3 August 2009.</ref> a problem experienced across most of the Australian higher education sector.

La Trobe has lost funding disproportionately across its departments. For instance, the History Department at the university was once by far the largest of any institution in Australia; however, funding restrictions have led to a significant reduction in its size. Similarly, in 1999, the Music Department was closed due to funding cuts; in 2004 the Geology Department was excised even though it had the highest graduate satisfaction rating in the country. The university's African Research Institute, the only major African studies centre in Australasia, was closed at the end of 2006.<ref>[http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&list=h-africa&month=0703&week=e&msg=ZJcW%2b048Gpfl7eJS68DFfw&user=&pw= Message posted by Peter Limb on 30 March 2007 to H-Africa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521051828/http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&list=h-africa&month=0703&week=e&msg=ZJcW+048Gpfl7eJS68DFfw&user=&pw= |date=21 May 2011 }} ([[H-Net]] list on African studies)</ref> In 2008, the university cut the Philosophy and Religious Studies Program at the Bendigo campus, the change resulted in the stream only being taught as a minor.

=== Third era: 2015–present ===


====COVID-19 pandemic====

In 2020, La Trobe University had its operations substantially impacted by the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. In March, part of the Bundoora campus had to be closed for a deep clean after a student tested positive for the disease.<ref>[https://www.3aw.com.au/la-trobe-university-student-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/ La Trobe University student tests positive for coronavirus] ''3AW Radio''. Retrieved 6/07/2020.</ref> The university remained open for a time, until the health advice from the Department of Health and Human Services indicated the university should close - although a limited number of courses eventually continued in a face-to-face teaching mode.

This, combined with a reduction in international student enrolments, purportedly weakened the university's financial position<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/la-trobe-university-seeks-lifeline-from-banks-as-seven-found-to-be-at-high-financial-risk "La Trobe University seeks lifeline from banks as seven institutions found to be at 'high financial risk'"], ''The Guardian''.

The Melbourne campus at Bundoora is the foundation campus of La Trobe and was officially opened in 1967 when La Trobe began operations. The campus is the main base of all La Trobe's main courses except education, pharmacy, and dentistry, all of which are based at Bendigo. The main campus buildings were designed by Melbourne architecture firm, [[Yuncken Freeman]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn3506434|title=Digital Collections - Pictures - Sievers, Wolfgang, 1913–2007. La Trobe University [architectural] model, Victoria, architect: Yuncken Freeman, 1965 [3] [picture]|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> in a utilitarian, Post-War International style. Main campus buildings are connected by a series of raised walkways. The Bundoora campus is the largest university campus in the Southern Hemisphere.

Bundoora has around 22,000 students on campus and therefore has many facilities such as restaurants, bars, shops, banks and an art gallery. The main library on the campus, the Borchardt, has well over one million volumes.

La Trobe University has three on-campus residential colleges: [[Menzies College, La Trobe|Menzies]], [[Glenn College, La Trobe University|Glenn]] and Chisholm.

The Bundoora campus is home to the [[La Trobe University Medical Centre and Hospital]].
The La Trobe Wildlife Sanctuary,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latrobe.edu.au/wildlife/|title=La Trobe Wildlife Sanctuary|author=La Trobe University|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> part of the university, is adjacent to the campus.

Bundoora also has sporting and recreation facilities such as an indoor pool, gyms, playing fields, and indoor stadiums. [[A-League]] franchise [[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City]] have constructed a $15 million training facility on the campus grounds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/27/a-league-melbourne-city-training-base|title=A-League: Melbourne City unveil new $15m training base|last=Press|first=Australian Associated|date=2015-02-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Prior to the construction of its new training facilities, the [[Essendon Football Club]] had trained at La Trobe University during the summer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.essendonfc.com.au/news/2010-05-05/facility|title=Tough decisions needed on new training facility - essendonfc.com.au|work=essendonfc.com.au|access-date=2017-03-28}}</ref> Additionally the Sport Program exists to assist student athletes.

The university is also home to the [[Centre for Dialogue]], an interdisciplinary research institution which delves into certain intercultural and inter-religious conflicts, both in the domestic setting and in [[international relations]]. In March 2009, the centre attracted controversy in hosting a lecture given by former Iranian President, H. E. Sayed Mohammed Khatami (1997–2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latrobe.edu.au/dialogue/events/khatami-2009.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318000608/https://www.latrobe.edu.au/dialogue/events/khatami-2009.html |archivedate=18 March 2009 |date=20 February 2009 |title=Former Iranian President, Khatami, to visit La Trobe |publisher=La Trobe University}}</ref> Khatami emphasised the importance of dialogue between civilizations, especially in relation to quelling misunderstandings between the Islamic world and the West.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/khatami-israeli-nukes-the-problem-20090325-9aj0.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Khatami: Israeli nukes the problem | first=Daniel | last=Flitton | date=26 March 2009}}</ref>
The Centre for Dialogue has also won acclaim for its leadership programme for young Muslims, implemented predominantly in Melbourne's northern suburbs.<ref>https://www.latrobe.edu.au/dialogue/assets/downloads/muslim-leadership-program-article.pdf</ref>

====Research and Development Park====
The R&D Park opened in 1993, adjacent to the Melbourne (Bundoora) campus. Tenants include a branch of the [[Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research]], the [[Victorian State Forensic Centre]], a [[Rio Tinto Group]] research centre, Victorian [[Environment Protection Authority (Victoria)|Environment Protection Authority]] (EPA), the [[Co-operative Research Centre for Vaccine Technology]], [[CAVAL]], AgriBio and the Technical Enterprise Centre (a [[business incubator]] for new ventures in information technology, biotechnology and the life sciences).

===Bendigo===
La Trobe Bendigo was established in 1991, initially as the La Trobe University College of Northern Victoria (1991–1994).<ref>[https://www.latrobe.edu.au/news/articles/2013/release/bendigo-community-to-celebrate-milestone 'Bendigo community to celebrate milestone'], La Trobe University [website], (2013), accessed 27 January 2015</ref> It succeeded 118 years of tertiary education in the regional centre, which began with the [[Bendigo School of Mines]] in 1873. The main site of the Bendigo campus, the Edwards Road campus, was established in 1967 under the Bendigo Institute of Technology (1967–1976).<ref name="auto1">'[http://www.bendigoweekly.com.au/news/touched-by-the-school-of-mines Touched by the School of Mines]', ''Bendigo Weekly'', 19 Apr. 2013, accessed 27 January 2015.</ref> While the Osbourne Street campus was established in 1959 under the Bendigo Teacher's College (1926–73). Together these two sites are known as the Flora Hill campus precinct.<ref>'[https://www.latrobe.edu.au/io/vision/bendigo-campus Bendigo Campus]', La Trobe University [website], (2013), accessed 27 January 2015.</ref> They were acquired by La Trobe University in 1991 after an amalgamation with the Bendigo College of Advanced Education (1976–1991).

The Bendigo campus is situated on 33 hectares of land, consisting of four sites—Edwards Road, Osbourne Street, the Visual Art Centre and the La Trobe Rural Health School.<ref>'[https://www.latrobe.edu.au/io/documents/maps/bendigo/Bendigo-Locality-Map.pdf Locality Map, Bendigo Campus]', La Trobe University [website], accessed 27 January 2015.</ref> The Edwards Road campus is positioned three kilometres away from the centre of Bendigo and is the home of La Trobe's School of Education. The Heyward Library is also located there. The Osbourne Street Campus is predominantly used for examination facilities and is home to the La Trobe University Bendigo Athletics Track. There is also the associated [[Central Victorian Innovation Park]], located on university land, which opened in December 2003.

Some of the facilities used in the 2004 [[Commonwealth Youth Games]] were located at La Trobe University Bendigo.

Between 1994 and 2005, La Trobe Bendigo's curriculum was separate from that based at Bundoora, operated by a multidisciplinary Faculty of Regional Development. All campuses could choose to offer individual courses from both Bundoora and Bendigo. This situation ceased in 2005 after the Bendigo campus formed part of the Melbourne campus structure.<ref name="auto1" />

===City===

La Trobe has a campus in Melbourne's [[central business district]], on Collins Street. The campus delivers postgraduate courses for both domestic and international students.

====Bouverie Centre====
The Bouverie Centre (first known as the Collins Street Clinic) was established as a clinical mental health service for children and adolescents. In 1956, the centre was renamed the Bouverie Clinic following its relocation from Collins Street, in the CBD of Melbourne to Bouverie Street, Carlton. The Bouverie Centre made the transition from a child psychiatric clinic to the first family therapy centre in Australia in the mid 1970s. In 2007 the Bouverie Centre moved into a $5 million, state government funded, purpose built building at 8 Gardiner Street, [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]].

La Trobe University took over the management of the Bouverie Centre from the Mental Health Branch of the Victorian Department of Human Services, and added to Bouverie's name the subtitle Victoria's Family Institute. In the decades that followed, the range of clinical academic courses offered by Bouverie expanded and to date, the Centre delivers a number of Graduate Certificate programs, including the Graduate Certificate in Narrative Therapy; a program specifically tailored for professionals working with people impacted by Acquired Brain Injury seeking to enhance their skill and confidence in working with families, and the nationally recognised Graduate Certificate in Family Therapy for [[Indiginous Australians|Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander]] Workers. The centre's flagship Master's level program is a regular feature on the academic calendar and we also boast a vibrant higher degree research program.

The Bouverie Centre has over 40 staff, with clinical staff typically working across a number of different service areas.<ref>Bouverie Centre, '[http://www.bouverie.org.au/about-us/our-history Our History]', ''Bouverie Centre'' [website], (2015), accessed 14 April 2015.</ref>

===Albury-Wodonga===

The Albury Wodonga (A-W) Campus is located three kilometres from the centre of [[Wodonga]] on a 26 hectare site. It used to be the sole campus of the Wodonga Institute of TAFE. The La Trobe campus was established in 1991. The campus continues to share various resources with the TAFE. The A-W campus houses the faculties of education, health sciences, biology, business and others.

===Mildura===
[[File:MilduraLaTrobeUniversity.JPG|thumb|Mildura offices]]
The Mildura Campus was established in 1996, co-located with the main campus of the [[Sunraysia Institute of TAFE]]. These institutions and other tertiary education and research institutions on the site share various resources. A second Mildura City campus opened in 2006 in the old Mildura Cultivator offices, next to "Gallery 25", an art gallery La Trobe became involved with a few years earlier.

===Shepparton===
The Shepparton campus was established in 1994. A new two-storey campus building at 210 Fryers St. was opened in late 2010.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Former campuses===

The Hotel and Conference Centre at Beechworth closed on 23 May 2011. This decision followed stakeholder consultation and feedback about the proposed closure from local businesses and the community. The Beechworth site was once home to the [[Beechworth Asylum|Beechworth Lunatic Asylum]], founded in 1867 and later renamed "Mayday Hills Hospital". The hospital ceased operation in 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tasa.org.au/conference/2004/healthday.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050615140938/http://www.tasa.org.au/conference/2004/healthday.php |archivedate=15 June 2005 |title=Health Day: Wednesday 8 |work=TASA 2004 Conference La Trobe University, Beechworth Campus, December 8–11 |publisher=TASA: The Australian Sociological Association}}</ref>

===Planned campuses===

In 2007, the university announced plans to open "learning nodes" co-located with the Wangaratta and Seymour campuses of [[Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latrobe.edu.au/news/2007/mediarelease_2007-58.php |date=27 September 2007  |title=New La Trobe Shepparton Campus gets the green light |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012203014/http://latrobe.edu.au/news/2007/mediarelease_2007-58.php |archivedate=12 October 2007 }}</ref> and at the Swan Hill campus of [[Sunraysia Institute of TAFE]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22482528-12332,00.html | work=The Australian | first1=Milanda | last1=Rout | first2=Catherine | last2=Armitage | title=Howard backs links to TAFE | date=26 September 2007}}</ref>

==Heraldry and brandmark==
=== Coat of arms ===
According to Glenn: "The Coat of Arms was approved and the Chancellor was asked to write formally to the [[College of Arms]] requesting the Grant-of-Arms."<ref name="Glenn">{{cite book |author=J.&nbsp;R. Archibald Glenn |year=1989 |chapter=The Planning Phase |editor=William J.

The Coat of Arms were granted by the [[College of Arms]] in 1966 with the [[blazon]] described as: 
:''"[[Argent]] a [[Chaplet (headgear)|chaplet]] of [[Epacris impressa|Common Heath]] [[Proper (heraldry)|proper]] tied with a [[Riband]] [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]] and encircling in [[Chief (heraldry)|chief]] an open Book proper bound and over all on a [[Fess]] [[Gules]] three [[Scallops|Escallops]] Argent And for the [[Crest (heraldry)|Crest]] On a [[Torse|Wreath]] Argent and Gules Perched on a Parchment Scroll an Australian wedgetailed eagle wings [[Attitude (heraldry)|inverted]] proper supporting with the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] claw an Escallop Argent".''<ref>Public Record Office of Victoria, '[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=554679891239671&set=pb.215890588451938.-2207520000.1380414447.&type=3&theater April 2013 - Showcase Record]', Facebook, viewed 15 January 2015.</ref>

==== Crest ====
On the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] sits an Australian [[wedge-tailed eagle]], perched on a parchment scroll and clasping an escallop shell. The wedge-tailed eagle (''aquila audax''), being such a well-known Australian bird that is found across the continent, was selected to symbolise La Trobe as an Australian university.

==== Motto ====
The motto ''qui cherche trouve'' ("whoever seeks shall find") is taken from the amorial bearings of the La Trobe family - ''qui la cèrca la tròba'' ([[Occitan language|Occitan]] for "who seeks shall find"). In Occitan, ''la tròba'' means "he finds it", and in regards to the La Trobe family there is debate over what was the object of the search.<ref>Latrobe, Pierre, [http://www.latrobesociety.org.au/LaTrobeana/LaTrobeanaV9n2.pdf "The patronymic: the latrobe/la trobe family name"], La Trobeana, 9/2 (2010), 2, accessed 25 October 2015.</ref> Such uncertainty is also expressed in the university's adaption, as John S. Gregory, an [[emeritus professor]] of La Trobe, phrased it: "what one actually finds is rarely exactly what one seeks or hopes for".<ref name="Gregory">{{cite book |author=John S. Gregory |year=1989 |chapter=Qui cherche, trouve: an overview of the first twenty-five years |editor=William J. Breen |title=Building La Trobe University: Reflections on the first 25 years 1964–1989 |isbn=1-86324-003-9 |location=Melbourne |publisher=La Trobe University Press |pages=3–18 |hdl=1959.9/201707}}</ref>{{rp|17}}

==== Escutcheon ====
Upon the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] (shield), there are three main features: the common heath, the escallop shells and the book. The heath refers to the [[Epacris impressa|common heath]] (''Epacris impressa''), the pink form, or '''pink heath''' form of which is the floral emblem of the [[Victoria (Australia)|State of Victoria]]. In a sense, this floral symbol also reflects the university's attempts to cater to all Victorians. The blue ribbon serves a decorative purpose in tying both sprigs of heath together to form a [[Chaplet (headgear)|chaplet]]. The three [[escallop]] shells upon a [[fess]] were taken from the armorial bearings of the La Trobe family and signify the La Trobe name.

=== Brandmark ===
[[File:Old_La_Trobe_Brandmark.jpg|thumb|right|Initial brandmark of La Trobe University.<ref>Opening Ceremony and Inaugural Lectures 1967 (Melbourne: F. W. Cheshire Publishing, 1969)</ref>]]

The university has traditionally incorporated parts of its [[coat of arms]] into its brandmark. The first [[brandmark]] was heavily based on its armorial bearings, following the common university practice of using only the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and the [[motto]]. It is acceptable for a university to use the shield of Arms by itself, or with a motto. A university can choose how and where to display the different elements of its Arms.

==Organisation and administration==
===Organisation===
The university has two colleges, made up of several schools, offering courses at all levels:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latrobe.edu.au/faculties|title=Colleges|author=La Trobe University|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref>

=== La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science ===
[[File:LIMS building 3.jpg|thumb|Molecular inspired windows at LIMS]]
The [[La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science]] (LIMS) is an interdisciplinary research institute based at the university. It contains research groups in life sciences (biochemistry and [[genetics]]), physical sciences (chemistry and physics), and applied sciences (pharmacy) and teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in these areas through the School of Molecular Sciences.<ref name=":3">{{cite web|title = LIMS study|url = https://www.latrobe.edu.au/lims/study|website = www.latrobe.edu.au|accessdate =7 October 2015}}</ref> It also contains two [[Biotech|biotech companies]]: Hexima<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url = http://s3.amazonaws.com/zanran_storage/www.business.vic.gov.au/ContentPages/126282911.pdf|title = Melbourne Australia: life sciences capital of the Asia-Pacific|accessdate =7 October 2015|website = www.business.vic.gov.au|publisher = Life Science CLUSTERS Magazine}}</ref> and AdAlta.<ref>{{Cite report|url = https://www.latrobe.edu.au/lims/lims-documents/LIMS-2011-Research-Report.pdf|title = LIMS 2011 Research Report|accessdate =7 October 2015|website = www.latrobe.edu.au}}</ref> The institute is housed in three buildings: LIMS1 and LIMS2 in the centre of the university's main campus in Bundoora and the applied science building at the Bendigo campus.

===AgriBio===
[[File:LTU Agribio front.jpg|thumb|Agribio building]]
[[File:LTU Agribio atrium 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Agribio Atrium]]
In 2004 the Victorian Government identified a need to collocate its primary industries department's plant and animal science research capabilities with other research entities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.agribio.com.au/about-the-jv/background|title=Background|last=3001|first=c=AU; st=Victoria; o=State Government of Victoria; ou1=Department of Primary Industries; street=P.O.

A key objective of AgriBio is to facilitate science collaboration between the University and the [[Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning]] (previously [[Department of Environment and Primary Industries (Victoria)|DEPI]]).<ref name="La Trobe Research" />

The La Trobe AgriBio building, on the south eastern side of the university, has grown into a structure of around 31,000 square metres and over three levels with a number of external buildings under construction such as a large glasshouse and poly-house complex. Construction commenced in May 2009 and was completed in August 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.agribio.com.au/construction|title=Construction|last=AgriBio|access-date=28 March 2017}}</ref>

===Australian Archaeomagnetism Laboratory===
In 2011 the university, in conjunction with the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences built the Australian Archaeomagnetism Laboratory (TAAL),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeomagnetism.com|title=The Australian Archaeomag Lab (TAAL)|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> based within the Department of Archaeology, Environment and Community Planning. The main aim and focus of research in the laboratory is promoting the use of magnetic methods of analysis ([[palaeomagnetism]], [[rock magnetism]], [[archaeomagnetic dating]] and [[magnetostratigraphy]]) for understanding the age, palaeoenvironmental/climate context and site formation history of archaeological and fossil sites. The laboratory also undertakes other research with the Department of Physics, including comparative work at the [[Australian Synchrotron]].

In 2011 the laboratory was involved in dating the age of the new South African hominin species ''[[Australopithecus sediba]]'', which was published in the journal "Science".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latrobeuniversitybulletin.com/2011/12/06/dating-our-earliest-ancestors/|title=Out of Africa: dating our earliest ancestors|work=La Trobe University Bulletin|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref>

==Arts and culture==

[[File:David Myers Building Panorama La Trobe University Bundoora VIC 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|David Myers Building]]
La Trobe began collecting in the early 1960s before construction even started on the main campus at Bundoora. The collection now consists of more has more than 3000 post-war contemporary Australian art works valued at $17 million<ref name="The art of the matter">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/the-art-of-the-matter-20101123-184mf.html |location=Melbourne |work=The Age |title=The art of the matter |date=23 November 2010}}</ref> This is the second largest university art collection in Victoria in terms of collection value.<ref name="The art of the matter"/>

Art galleries are located on site at two of the university campuses: the University Art Museum at Melbourne campus and the Phyllis Palmer Gallery at Bendigo; the university also operates the Visual Arts Centre in Bendigo. The Melbourne campus has a sculpture park which includes the controversial upside-down statue of Victorian colonial Governor Charles Joseph La Trobe, by sculptor Charles Robb.<ref name="latrobe3">https://www.latrobe.edu.au/life/arts</ref>

The La Trobe University Art Collection began in 1966, before construction of the first buildings commenced at the site of the University's major campus at Bundoora. Recognising the importance of an art collection within an educational environment, the university's master architect, Roy Simpson AO, incorporated the installation and display of art works into his overall vision for La Trobe.

With Frank Barnes, the university's first business manager, and the generosity of individual benefactors, Roy Simpson initiated the commissioning of paintings by Gareth Jones-Roberts, Leonard Lloyd Annois and Charles William Bush to establish the Art Collection. Major sculptural works, such as Allen David's monumental glass screen that graces the main entrance to the University Library, were also included in the original design. The further installation of sculpture in the grounds and paintings throughout the buildings were proposed in the original master plan, and were made possible with funds raised through the 1976 Retirement Appeal for the inaugural vice-chancellor, David Myers.

Today the La Trobe University Art Collection is considered{{who|date=December 2015}} a major public art collection, comprising over 2,000 post war and contemporary Australian art works. The collection covers most media and periods of Australian art. It includes the largest holding of works by the Australian surrealist Bernard Boles, expatriate artist Allen David and the Etta Hirsh Ceramics Collection which consists of over 300 pieces.

In addition to an active acquisition program, art works have been acquired through an artist in residence program and sponsorship of public art prizes.

Public accessibility to the collections remains a priority, with many of the works displayed across the university's metropolitan and regional campuses, included in touring exhibitions and exhibitions held at the La Trobe University Museum of Art and other venues.<ref>https://www.latrobe.edu.au/luma/collections/la-trobe.</ref>

The other campuses have access to local exhibition spaces. The Shepparton Gallery is located in the Shepparton town centre. Albury-Wodonga students can access Albury Regional Art Gallery. In Mildura, Visual Arts students present a final year art exhibition and there is also the Mildura Wentworth Arts Festival.<ref name="latrobe3"/>

In August 2019, an honorary PhD was given to [[Bollywood]] actor Shah Rukh Khan in recognition of his efforts to aid underprivileged children, in empowering women through his Meer Foundation, and for his contribution to the arts via superlative achievements in the Indian entertainment industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latrobe.edu.au/news/articles/2019/release/la-trobe-to-honour-shah-rukh-khan|title=La Trobe to honour Shah Rukh Khan|last=University|first=La Trobe|website=www.latrobe.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2019-08-24}}</ref> Khan attended the award ceremony at La Trobe's Bundoora campus, where he spoke to a sold-out crowd about women's empowerment and of his hopes for the opportunities his new PhD Research Scholarship would provide for a worthy student.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/celebrities/story/shah-rukh-khan-honoured-with-doctorate-degree-at-la-trobe-university-for-humanitarian-work-1579084-2019-08-09|title=Shah Rukh Khan honoured with doctorate degree at La Trobe University for humanitarian work|last=MelbourneAugust 9|first=Indo Asian News Service|last2=August 9|first2=2019UPDATED|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2019-08-24|last3=Ist|first3=2019 13:54}}</ref>

==Student life==

===Student Union===
{{main|La Trobe Student Union}}

The La Trobe University Students' Union is responsible for the Eagle Bar, Contact Student Services but its role has been considerably diminished as a consequence of [[Voluntary Student Unionism]]. There used to be three main student representative bodies on campus known as the La Trobe University Student Guild, the Student's Representative Council and the La Trobe Postgraduate Student's Association. The [[La Trobe University Student Representative Council]], became the principal representative body on campus and a student advocacy group as well as student representatives for welfare, disability, women, queer, indigenous, environment, education and welfare and the Guild managed student services. In 2011 however, the Student's Representative Council, the La Trobe Postgraduate Students Association, the Students Guild and the university merged the three separate organisations into one body: the La Trobe Student Union.

The largest faculty-based student representative organisation on campus is the Law Students Association (LSA). Postgraduate students are represented in the new union. The students at the Bendigo campus are represented by the Bendigo Student Association (BSA), a much less activist and political organisation than the student union. The BSA publishes the ''3rd Degree'' magazine.

===''Rabelais''===
''[[Rabelais Student Media]]'' is a student newspaper at La Trobe University, named after French Renaissance writer [[François Rabelais]]. From its founding in 1967, Rabelais Student Media has been run as a department of the La Trobe University Student Representative Council (now the La Trobe Student Union). The paper is funded by a combination of advertising revenue and a student levy. Editors are elected annually and serve for a single year.

Notably it was the subject of a [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] case after the Office of Film and Literature Classification ruled in 1995 that it "promotes, incites and instructs in matters of crime" because of an article on shoplifting (reprinted from elsewhere). This decision was later reviewed by the High Court of Australia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huntley|first=Rebecca|title=Rabelais Goes To Canberra|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/CLCCommsUpd/1998/127.pdf|journal=CLC Communications Update|volume=127|pages=20–21|via=Database}}</ref>

===Athletics===
La Trobe University is one of 36 universities across Australia that is part of the Elite Athlete Friendly University Network. The network was established by the Australian Sports Commission in 2004 to identify, promote and support the specific needs of university students who participate in sport at an elite level. As a result, an Elite Athlete Friendly University (EAFU) program was developed and formulated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latrobe.edu.au/sara/elite-athletes/index.htm|title=Sport, La Trobe University}}</ref>

In 2011 La Trobe University was the reigning champion at the Southern University Games, having won the competition in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latrobe.edu.au/sara/unigames.htm|title=Sport, La Trobe University}}</ref>

The Sports Centre at the Melbourne campus has a fully equipped gym, squash/racquetball and tennis courts, volleyball, badminton, indoor soccer, netball and basketball courts, a 25-metre pool with a deep water pit, and dance and yoga studios. The centre also offers group exercise classes, dance classes, pilates and yoga. Tuition in most sports can be arranged and courts can be hired to students at discounted rates. The centre also offers deep tissue and trigger point sports massage. La Trobe University participates in the annual [[Australian University Games]]<ref>https://www.latrobe.edu.au/life/sport.</ref> [[A-League]] association football (soccer) club [[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City]] have their training and administrative facilities based at La Trobe University.<ref>{{cite web|title=Melbourne City FC Re-Commence Training|url=http://www.melbournecityfc.com.au/article/news-melbourne-city-fc-re-commence-training/uhezs3kpfgu310t71bi1f1x0g|publisher=melbournecityfc.com.au|accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref>

=== Song ===
The university song is the tune of [[Marche Henri IV]]. The melody is originally from Cassandre by [[Thoinot Arbeau]]. There are many university chants that are sung at matches which vary between the sports clubs. The most common chant that is used by La Trobe teams is "LT Who? LTU!".

Other student-run activities include the [[La Trobe International Relations Associations]].<ref>LIRA, "constitution", 02-02-2010, "[http://www.lira.org.au/?page_id=60 Source 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605174107/http://www.lira.org.au/?page_id=60 |date=2011-06-05 }}", 16-04-2010</ref>

On 16 March 2016, ABC news reported that a Liberal Nationals MP, George Christensen, had used parliamentary privilege to accuse the Safe Schools program of being linked to a "[[Paedophilia|paedophilia advocate]]", referring to a professor, Gary Dowsett, and a report he published in 1982. A spokesman for La Trobe University stated: "We are appalled that a respected academic has been attacked using parliamentary privilege. This is a blatant attempt to distract attention from the independent endorsement of the highly effective Safe Schools program. We stand by the important work of Professor Dowsett and his team."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-16/george-christensen-links-safe-schools-program-to-paedophilia/7252476|title=George Christensen links Safe Schools to 'paedophilia advocate'|date=16 March 2016}}</ref>

In May 2016, the Victorian Government reignited its feud with Canberra over the controversial Safe Schools program, announcing it will publicly provide material about sexual diversity that had been deleted from the federal government's website, and an additional $300,000 a year to deliver the program in full.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-15/safe-schools-victoria-reignites-feud-with-canberra-over-program/7415452|title=Victoria defies Federal Government over Safe Schools program|date=15 May 2016}}</ref>
