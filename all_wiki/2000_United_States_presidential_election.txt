The '''2000 United States presidential election''' was the 54th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]], held on Tuesday, November 7, 2000. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[George W. Bush]], the [[governor of Texas]] and eldest son of the 41st president, [[George H. W.

Gore secured the Democratic nomination with relative ease, defeating a challenge by former Senator [[Bill Bradley]]. Bush was seen as the early favorite for the Republican nomination and despite a contentious primary battle with Senator [[John McCain]] and others, secured the nomination by [[Super Tuesday]]. Bush chose former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]] as his running mate, while Gore chose Senator [[Joe Lieberman]].

Both major-party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal [[social insurance]] programs, although foreign policy was not ignored. Due to President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton–Lewinsky scandal|sex scandal]] with [[Monica Lewinsky]] and subsequent [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]], Gore avoided campaigning with Clinton. Republicans denounced Clinton's indiscretions, while Gore criticized Bush's lack of experience. On election night, it was unclear who had won, with the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] of the state of [[Florida]] still undecided. The returns showed that Bush had won Florida by such a close margin that state law required a [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|recount]]. A month-long series of legal battles led to the highly controversial 5–4 [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', which ended the recount.

The recount having been ended, Bush won Florida by 537 votes, a margin of 0.009%. The Florida recount and subsequent litigation resulted in major post-election controversy, and with speculative analysis suggesting that limited county-based recounts would likely have confirmed a Bush victory, whereas a statewide recount would likely have given the state to Gore.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The American Statistician|date=February 2003|volume=57|number=1|pages=1–14|publisher=American Statistical Association|doi=10.1198/0003130031144|title=Statistical Practice: Reliability of the Uncertified Ballots in the 2000 Presidential Election in Florida|first1=Kirk|last1=Wolter|first2=Diana|last2=Jergovic|first3=Whitney|last3=Moore|first4=Joe|last4=Murphy|first5=Colm|last5=O'Muircheartaigh|url=http://www.amstat.org/misc/PresidentialElectionBallots.pdf|jstor=3087271|s2cid=120778921|accessdate=June 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318154912/http://www.amstat.org/misc/PresidentialElectionBallots.pdf|archive-date=March 18, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="battle"/> Ultimately, Bush won 271 electoral votes, one more than a majority, despite Gore receiving 543,895 more votes (a margin of 0.51% of all votes cast).<ref name=el2000>{{cite web|title=Federal Elections 2000: 2000 Presidential Electoral and Popular Vote Table|url=https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/elecpop.htm|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|accessdate=March 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709174557/https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/elecpop.htm|archive-date=July 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Bush won 11 states that had voted Democratic in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]] election: [[2000 United States presidential election in Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Arizona|Arizona]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Florida|Florida]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Kentucky|Kentucky]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Louisiana|Louisiana]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Missouri|Missouri]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Nevada|Nevada]], [[2000 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Ohio|Ohio]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Tennessee|Tennessee]] and [[2000 United States presidential election in West Virginia|West Virginia]].

==Background==
{{Further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}
[[File:Bill Clinton.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[incumbent]], [[Bill Clinton]]. His second term expired at noon on January 20, 2001.]]
[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] dictates that the President and Vice President of the United States must be [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizens]] of the United States, at least 35 years old, and residents of the United States for a period of at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the political parties, in which case each party devises a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Traditionally, the primary elections are [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The general election in November is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors in turn directly elect the president and vice president.

President [[Bill Clinton]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and former [[Governor of Arkansas]], was ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], and in accordance with Section{{nbsp}}1 of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], his term expired at noon [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on January 20, 2001.

=== Primaries ===
Bush became the early front-runner, acquiring unprecedented funding and a broad base of leadership support based on his governorship of Texas and the Bush family's name recognition and connections in American politics. Former cabinet member [[George Shultz]] played an important early role in securing establishment Republican support for Bush. In April 1998, he invited Bush to discuss policy issues with experts including [[Michael Boskin]], [[John B. Taylor|John Taylor]], and [[Condoleezza Rice]], who later became his [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]]. The group, which was "looking for a candidate for 2000 with good political instincts, someone they could work with", was impressed, and Shultz encouraged him to enter the race.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Frontline|serieslink=Frontline (U.S. TV series)|network=PBS|station=[[WGBH-TV]] |location=Boston|airdate=October 12, 2004|transcript=The Choice|transcripturl= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/choice2004/etc/script.html }}</ref>

Several aspirants withdrew before the [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2000|Iowa Caucus]] because they did not secure funding and endorsements sufficient to remain competitive with Bush. These included [[Elizabeth Dole]], [[Dan Quayle]], [[Lamar Alexander]], and [[Bob Smith (New Hampshire politician)|Bob Smith]]. [[Pat Buchanan]] dropped out to run for the Reform Party nomination. That left Bush, [[John McCain]], [[Alan Keyes]], [[Steve Forbes]], [[Gary Bauer]], and [[Orrin Hatch]] as the only candidates still in the race.

On January 24, Bush won the Iowa caucus with 41% of the vote. Forbes came in second with 30% of the vote. Keyes received 14%, Bauer 9%, McCain 5%, and Hatch 1%. Two days later, Hatch dropped out and endorsed Bush. The national media portrayed Bush as the establishment candidate. McCain, with the support of many moderate Republicans and Independents, portrayed himself as a crusading insurgent who focused on [[Electoral reform|campaign reform]].

On February 1, McCain won a 49–30% victory over Bush in the [[New Hampshire Presidential primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Bauer subsequently dropped out, followed by Forbes, who came in third in the Delaware primary. This left three candidates. In the [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2000|South Carolina primary]], Bush soundly defeated McCain. Some McCain supporters accused the Bush campaign of mudslinging and dirty tricks, such as [[push poll]]ing that implied that McCain's adopted Bangladeshi-born daughter was an African-American child he fathered out of wedlock.<ref name=pushpolling>{{cite web |url=http://www.dadmag.com/archive/060400jmccain.php |title=Interview with John McCain |website=Dadmag.com |date=June 4, 2000 |accessdate=November 16, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221071033/http://www.dadmag.com/archive/060400jmccain.php |archive-date=December 21, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> McCain's loss in South Carolina damaged his campaign, but he won both Michigan and his home state of Arizona on February 22.

(The primary election that year also affected the [[South Carolina State House]], when a controversy about the Confederate flag flying over the capitol dome prompted the state legislature to move the flag to a less prominent position at a [[Flag of the Confederate States of America#Display at South Carolina's state capitol|Civil War memorial on the capitol grounds]]. Most GOP candidates said the issue should be left to South Carolina voters, but McCain later recanted and said the flag should be removed.<ref>Holmes, Steven A. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/20/us/after-campaigning-on-candor-mccain-admits-he-lacked-it-on-confederate-flag-issue.html After Campaigning on Candor, McCain Admits He Lacked It on Confederate Flag Issue] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226024221/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/20/us/after-campaigning-on-candor-mccain-admits-he-lacked-it-on-confederate-flag-issue.html |date=February 26, 2017 }}. ''[[The New York Times]]''. April 20, 2000. Retrieved 2015-06-19.</ref>)

On February 24, McCain criticized Bush for accepting the endorsement of [[Bob Jones University]] despite its policy banning [[interracial dating]]. On February 28, McCain also referred to [[Jerry Falwell]] and televangelist [[Pat Robertson]] as "agents of intolerance", a term he distanced himself from during his [[John McCain 2008 presidential campaign|2008 bid]]. He lost Virginia to Bush on February 29. On [[Super Tuesday]], March 7, Bush won New York, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri, California, Maryland, and Maine. McCain won Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, but dropped out of the race. McCain became the Republican presidential nominee [[2008 United States presidential election|8 years later]], but lost the general election to [[Barack Obama]]. On March 10, Keyes got 21% of the vote in Utah. Bush took the majority of the remaining contests and won the Republican nomination on March 14, winning his home state of Texas and his brother [[Jeb Bush|Jeb's]] home state of Florida, among others. At the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Bush accepted the nomination.

Bush asked former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]] to head up a team to help select a running mate for him, but ultimately chose Cheney himself as the vice presidential nominee. While the U.S. Constitution does not specifically disallow a president and a vice president from the same state, it does prohibit electors from casting both of his or her votes for persons from his or her own state. Accordingly, Cheney—who had been a resident of [[Texas]] for nearly 10 years—changed his voting registration back to Wyoming. Had Cheney not done this, either he or Bush would have forfeited his electoral votes from Texas.

Running an insurgency campaign, Bradley positioned himself as the alternative to Gore, who was a founding member of the centrist [[Democratic Leadership Council]]. While former basketball star [[Michael Jordan]] campaigned for him in the early primary states, Bradley announced his intention to campaign "in a different way" by conducting a positive campaign of "big ideas". His campaign's focus was a plan to spend the record-breaking budget surplus on a variety of social welfare programs to help the poor and the middle class, along with campaign finance reform and [[gun control]].

Gore easily defeated Bradley in the primaries, largely because of support from the Democratic Party establishment and Bradley's poor showing in the Iowa caucus, where Gore successfully painted Bradley as aloof and indifferent to the plight of farmers. The closest Bradley came to a victory was his 50–46 loss to Gore in the New Hampshire primary. On March 14, Gore clinched the Democratic nomination.

None of Bradley's delegates were allowed to vote for him, so Gore won the nomination unanimously at the [[2000 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]]. [[Connecticut]] Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] was nominated for vice president by voice vote. Lieberman became the first [[American Jews|Jewish American]] ever to be chosen for this position by a major party. Gore chose Lieberman over five other finalists: Senators [[Evan Bayh]], [[John Edwards]], and [[John Kerry]], [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] [[Dick Gephardt]], and [[New Hampshire Governor]] [[Jeanne Shaheen]].<ref name=GoreLiebermanCNN>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/08/07/gore.lieberman/index.html |title=Gore, Lieberman prepare for public debut of Democratic ticket |publisher=CNN |date=August 8, 2000 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105210049/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/08/07/gore.lieberman/index.html |archivedate=November 5, 2008}}</ref>

==General election campaign==
Although the campaign focused mainly on domestic issues, such as the projected budget surplus, proposed reforms of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], health care, and competing plans for tax relief, foreign policy was often an issue.

Bush criticized [[Clinton administration]] policies in [[Somalia]], where 18 Americans died in 1993 trying to sort out warring factions, and in the Balkans, where United States peacekeeping troops perform a variety of functions. "I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called [[nation-building]]", Bush said in the second [[American presidential debate|presidential debate]].<ref>{{cite web |year=2004 |url=http://www.debates.org/pages/trans2000b.html |title=The Second Gore-Bush Presidential Debate |work=2000 Debate Transcript |publisher=Commission on Presidential Debates |accessdate=October 21, 2005 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050403122916/http://www.debates.org/pages/trans2000b.html |archivedate= April 3, 2005}}</ref> Bush also pledged to bridge partisan gaps, claiming the atmosphere in Washington stood in the way of progress on necessary reforms.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/ |title=Election 2000 Archive |publisher=CNN/AllPolitics.com |accessdate=November 16, 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080730055332/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/ |archivedate= July 30, 2008}}</ref> Gore, meanwhile, questioned Bush's fitness for the job, pointing to gaffes Bush made in interviews and speeches and suggesting he lacked the necessary experience to be president.

[[Bill Clinton]]'s [[impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]] and the [[Lewinsky scandal|sex scandal]] that led up to it cast a shadow on the campaign. Republicans strongly denounced the Clinton scandals, and Bush made a promise to restore "honor and dignity" to the White House a centerpiece of his campaign. Gore studiously avoided the Clinton scandals, as did Lieberman, even though Lieberman had been the first Democratic senator to denounce Clinton's misbehavior. Some observers theorized that Gore chose Lieberman in an attempt to separate himself from Clinton's past misdeeds and help blunt the GOP's attempts to link him to his boss.<ref>[[Dan Rather|Rather, Dan]].

[[File:pbc-fl-2000-recount-1.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|Palm Beach County recount]]
With the exceptions of [[Florida]] and Gore's home state of [[Tennessee]], Bush carried the Southern states by comfortable margins (including Clinton's home state of Arkansas) and also won [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], most of the rural [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] farming states, most of the Rocky Mountain states, and Alaska. Gore balanced Bush by sweeping the [[Northeastern United States]] (with the exception of [[New Hampshire]], which Bush won narrowly), the Pacific Coast states, [[Hawaii]], [[New Mexico]], and most of the [[Upper Midwest]].

As the night wore on, the returns in a handful of small-to-medium-sized states, including [[Wisconsin]], [[Iowa]], Oregon and New Mexico (Gore by 355 votes) were extremely close, but the election came down to Florida. As the final national results were tallied the following morning, Bush had clearly won 246 electoral votes and Gore 250, with 270 needed to win. Two smaller states—[[Wisconsin]] (11 electoral votes) and Oregon (7)—were still too close to call, but Florida's 25 electoral votes would be decisive regardless of their results. The election's outcome was not known for more than a month after voting ended because of the time required to count and recount Florida's ballots.

===Florida recount===
{{Main|2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida}}
[[File:TallahaseePalmBeachBallotBox1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|2000 Palm Beach County voting stand and ballot box]]
Between 7:50&nbsp;p.m. and 8:00&nbsp;p.m. EST on November 7, just before the polls closed in the largely Republican Florida panhandle, which is in the Central time zone, all major television news networks (CNN, NBC, FOX, CBS, and ABC) declared that Gore had won Florida. They based this prediction substantially on [[exit poll]]s. But in the vote tally Bush began to take a wide lead early in Florida, and by 10 p.m. EST the networks had retracted their predictions and placed Florida back in the "undecided" column. At approximately 2:30&nbsp;a.m. on November 8, with 85% of the vote counted in Florida and Bush leading Gore by more than 100,000 votes, the networks declared that Bush had carried Florida and therefore been elected president. But most of the remaining votes to be counted in Florida were in three heavily Democratic counties—[[Broward County, Florida|Broward]], [[Miami-Dade County|Miami-Dade]], and [[Palm Beach County|Palm Beach]]—and as their votes were reported Gore began to gain on Bush. By 4:30&nbsp;a.m., after all votes were counted, Gore had narrowed Bush's margin to under 2,000 votes, and the networks retracted their declarations that Bush had won Florida and the presidency. Gore, who had privately conceded the election to Bush, withdrew his concession. The final result in Florida was slim enough to require a mandatory recount (by machine) under state law; Bush's lead dwindled to just over 300 votes when it was completed the day after the election. On November 8, Florida Division of Elections staff prepared a press release for [[Florida Secretary of State]] [[Katherine Harris]] that said overseas ballots must be "postmarked or signed and dated" by Election Day. It was never released.<ref name="battle"/>{{rp|16}} A count of the overseas ballots later boosted Bush's margin to 930 votes. (According to a report by ''The New York Times'', 680 of the accepted overseas ballots were received after the legal deadline, lacked required postmarks or a witness signature or address, or were unsigned or undated, cast after election day, from unregistered voters or voters not requesting ballots, or double-counted.<ref name="NYT07152001">{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-how-bush-took-florida-mining-the-overseas-absentee-vote.html|title=Examining the Vote; How Bush Took Florida: Mining the Overseas Absentee Vote|first1=David|last1=Barstow|first2=Don, Jr.|last2=Van Natta|date=July 15, 2001|accessdate=November 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115173828/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-how-bush-took-florida-mining-the-overseas-absentee-vote.html|archive-date=November 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>)
[[File:1116c6 (5124003635).jpg|thumb|right|Florida Supreme Court during the recount]]
Most of the post-electoral controversy revolved around Gore's request for hand recounts in four counties (Broward, Miami Dade, Palm Beach, and [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia]]), as provided under Florida state law. Harris, who also co-chaired Bush's Florida campaign, announced she would reject any revised totals from those counties if they were not turned in by 5&nbsp;p.m. on November 14, the statutory deadline for amended returns. The [[Florida Supreme Court]] extended the deadline to November 26, a decision later [[vacated]] by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. Miami-Dade eventually halted its recount and resubmitted its original total to the state canvassing board, while Palm Beach County failed to meet the extended deadline, turning in its completed recount results at 7&nbsp;p.m., which Harris rejected. On November 26, the state canvassing board certified Bush as the winner of Florida's electors by 537 votes. Gore formally contested the certified results. A state court decision overruling Gore was reversed by the Florida Supreme Court, which ordered a recount of over 70,000 ballots previously rejected as undervotes by machine counters. The U.S. Supreme Court halted that order the next day, with [[Justice Scalia]] issuing a concurring opinion that "the counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner" (Bush).<ref>{{cite web

On December 12, the Supreme Court [[Bush v. Gore|ruled]] in a per curiam decision (asserted as a 7–2 vote) that the Florida Supreme Court's ruling requiring a statewide recount of ballots was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds, and in a 5–4 vote reversed and remanded the case to the Florida Supreme Court for modification before the optional "safe harbor" deadline, which the Supreme Court argued that Florida court had said the state intended to meet. With only two hours remaining until the December 12 deadline, the Supreme Court's order effectively ended the recount, and the previously certified total held.

Even if the Supreme Court had decided differently in ''Bush v. Gore'', the Florida Legislature had been meeting in Special Session since December 8 with the purpose of selecting of a slate of electors on December 12 should the dispute still be ongoing.<ref>{{cite news|title=Florida legislature to appoint electors during special session Friday|url=http://staugustine.com/stories/120700/sta_120700002b.shtml#.WFQR2lMrKpo|accessdate=December 16, 2016|work=The St. Augustine Record|date=December 7, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220183518/http://staugustine.com/stories/120700/sta_120700002b.shtml#.WFQR2lMrKpo|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=FLORIDA LEGISLATURE–SPECIAL SESSION A–2000 (Dec) HISTORY OF HOUSE BILLS|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/data/session/2001a/citator/Final/hsehist.pdf|accessdate=December 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220174725/http://www.leg.state.fl.us/data/session/2001a/citator/Final/hsehist.pdf|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Had the recount gone forward, it would have awarded those electors to Bush, based on the state-certified vote, and Gore's likely last recourse would have been to contest the electors in the United States Congress.

A victory in any of these three states (or any state that Bush won) would have given Gore enough electoral votes to win the presidency.

Before the election, the possibility that different candidates would win the popular vote and the Electoral College had been noted, but usually with Gore winning the Electoral College and Bush the popular vote.<ref>http://www.leinsdorf.com/newhampshireprimary.htm</ref><ref>https://www.texastribune.org/2000/11/06/excess-stomach-acid/</ref><ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anything-can-happen/</ref><ref>https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-2000-11-07-3333849-story.html</ref><ref>https://slate.com/human-interest/2000/11/war-on-the-electoral-college.amp</ref> That Bush could win the Electoral College and Gore the popular vote was not considered likely.

This was the first time since 1928 in which a non-incumbent Republican candidate won West Virginia.

The [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] results were the closest since [[1876 United States presidential election|1876]]. Gore's 266 electoral votes is the highest for a losing nominee.

Bush was the first Republican in American history to win the presidency without winning Vermont or Illinois, the second Republican to win the presidency without winning California ([[James A. Garfield]] in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]] was the first) or Pennsylvania ([[Richard Nixon]] in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] was the first), and the first winning Republican not to receive any electoral votes from California (Garfield received one vote in 1880). Bush also lost in Connecticut, the state of his birth. As of 2020, Bush is the last Republican nominee to win New Hampshire.

This marked the first time since Iowa entered the union in 1846 in which the state voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in four elections in a row (1988, 1992, 1996, and 2000), and the last time until 2020 that Iowa did not vote for the overall winner. There were two counties in the nation that had voted Republican in [[United States Presidential Election, 1996|1996]] and voted Democratic in 2000: [[Charles County, Maryland]], and [[Orange County, Florida]], both rapidly diversifying counties. The 2000 election was also the last time a Republican won a number of populous urban counties that have since turned into Democratic strongholds. These include [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina]] (Charlotte); [[Marion County, Indiana]] (Indianapolis), [[Fairfax County, Virginia]] (DC suburbs), and [[Travis County, Texas]] (Austin). In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Republican [[Donald Trump]] lost Mecklenburg by 30%, Marion by 23%, Fairfax by 36%, and Travis by 38%. Conversely, as of 2020 Gore is the last Democrat to have won any counties at all in Oklahoma.<ref name="NewsOK">{{cite web|last1=Casteel|first1=Chris|title=Oklahoma's 28th presidential election will be first with GOP voters in majority|url=http://newsok.com/article/5525574|website=NewsOK|accessdate=March 18, 2017|date=November 6, 2016}}</ref>

===Post recount===
On January 6, 2001, a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] met to certify the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]. Twenty members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], most of them members of the all-Democratic [[Congressional Black Caucus]], rose one-by-one to file objections to the electoral votes of Florida. However, pursuant to the [[Electoral Count Act]], any such objection had to be sponsored by both a representative and a [[United States Senate|senator]]. No senator would co-sponsor these objections, deferring to the Supreme Court's ruling. Therefore, Gore, who presided in his capacity as [[Vice President of the United States|President of the Senate]], ruled each of these objections out of order.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CREC&browsePath=2001%2F01%2F01-06\%2F7&isCollapsed=false&leafLevelBrowse=false&ycord=482 |title=FDsys - Browse CREC |website=Gpo.gov |date=January 6, 2001 |accessdate=August 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701123721/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CREC&browsePath=2001%2F01%2F01-06%5C%2F7&isCollapsed=false&leafLevelBrowse=false&ycord=482 |archive-date=July 1, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Subsequently, the joint session of Congress certified the electoral votes from all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Bush took the oath of office on January 20, 2001. He would serve for the next eight years. Gore has not, as of 2020, considered another presidential run, endorsing Howard Dean's candidacy during the 2004 Democratic primary and remaining neutral in the Democratic primaries of 2008, 2016 and 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://prospect.org/article/new-new-gore|title=The New New Gore|last=Klein|first=Ezra|date=2006-03-19|work=The American Prospect|access-date=2019-02-05|language=en-US|issn=1049-7285|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207015859/https://prospect.org/article/new-new-gore|archive-date=February 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The first independent recount of undervotes was conducted by the ''Miami Herald'' and ''USA Today''. The commission found that under most scenarios for completion of the initiated recounts, Bush would have won the election; however, Gore would have won using the most generous standards for undervotes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/media-jan-june01-recount_04-03/|title=Media Recount: Bush Won The 2000 election|publisher=PBS|access-date=September 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003021106/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/media-jan-june01-recount_04-03/|archive-date=October 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Ultimately, a media consortium — comprising ''The New York Times'', ''The Washington Post'', ''The Wall Street Journal'', Tribune Co. (parent of the ''Los Angeles Times''), Associated Press, CNN, ''The Palm Beach Post'' and the ''St. Petersburg Times''<ref name="fair2002">{{cite web|url=http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/who-won-the-election-who-cares/|title=Who Won the Election?

Their goal was to determine the reliability and accuracy of the systems used for the voting process. Based on the NORC review, the media group concluded that if the disputes over all the ballots in question had been resolved by applying statewide any of five standards that would have met Florida's legal standard for recounts, the electoral result would have been reversed and Gore would have won by 60 to 171 votes. (Any analysis of NORC data requires, for each punch ballot, at least two of the three ballot reviewers' codes to agree or instead, for all three to agree.) For all undervotes and overvotes statewide, these five standards are:<ref name="battle"/><ref>Wolter, K.M., Jergovic, D., Moore, W., Murphy, J. and O'Muirheartaigh, C. 2003.

*Prevailing standard – accepts at least one detached corner of a chad and all affirmative marks on optical scan ballots.
*County-by-county standard – applies each county's own standards independently.
*Two-corner standard – accepts at least two detached corners of a chad and all affirmative marks on optical scan ballots.
*Most restrictive standard – accepts only so-called perfect ballots that machines somehow missed and did not count, or ballots with unambiguous expressions of voter intent.
*Most inclusive standard – applies uniform criteria of "dimple or better" on punch marks and all affirmative marks on optical scan ballots.

Such a statewide review including all uncounted votes was a tangible possibility, as Leon County Circuit Court Judge [[Terry Lewis (Florida judge)|Terry Lewis]], whom the Florida Supreme Court had assigned to oversee the statewide recount, had scheduled a hearing for December 13 (mooted by the U.S. Supreme Court's final ruling on the 12th) to consider the question of including overvotes as well as undervotes. Subsequent statements by Judge Lewis and internal court documents support the likelihood of including overvotes in the recount.<ref name="newsweek2001">[https://web.archive.org/web/20081030111614/http://www.newsweek.com/id/76207/page/1 "The Final Word?

Further, according to sociologists [[Christopher Uggen]] and Jeff Manza, the 2000 election might have gone to Gore if the disenfranchised population of Florida had voted. Florida law disenfranchises convicted felons, requiring individual applications to regain suffrage. In their 2002 ''American Sociological Review'' article, Uggen and Manza found that the released felon vote could have altered the outcome of seven senatorial races between 1978 and 2000, and the 2000 presidential election.<ref>{{cite web|title= Florida's ex-convicts seek right to vote|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-07-20/news/0407200186_1_felons-civil-rights-re-elect|website= tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date= February 23, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304181347/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-07-20/news/0407200186_1_felons-civil-rights-re-elect|archive-date= March 4, 2016|url-status= live}}</ref> Matt Ford noted their study concluded "if the state's 827,000 disenfranchised felons had voted at the same rate as other Floridians, Democratic candidate Al Gore would have won Florida—and the presidency — by more than 80,000 votes."<ref name="restore">[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/maryland-felon-voting/462000/ Matt Ford, "Restoring Voting Rights for Felons in Maryland"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421090255/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/maryland-felon-voting/462000/ |date=April 21, 2017 }}, ''The Atlantic,'' February 9, 2016, accessed March 23, 2016</ref> The effect of Florida's law is such that in 2014, purportedly "[m]ore than one in ten Floridians – and nearly one in four African-American Floridians – are shut out of the polls because of felony convictions."<ref>Brent Staples, "Florida Leads the Pack – in Felon Disenfranchisement", ''New York Times'', November 7, 2014, accessed March 23, 2016</ref>

===Voting machines===
Because the 2000 presidential election was so close in Florida, the United States government and state governments pushed for [[election reform]] to be prepared by the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]]. Many of Florida's year 2000 election night problems stemmed from [[usability]] and ballot design factors with voting systems, including the potentially confusing "[[butterfly ballot]]". Many voters had difficulties with the paper-based [[voting machine#Punch card|punch card]] voting machines and were either unable to understand the required process for voting or unable to perform the process. This resulted in an unusual amount of [[overvote]] (voting for more candidates than is allowed) and [[undervote]]s (voting for fewer than the minimum candidates, including none at all). Many undervotes were caused by voter error, unmaintained punch card voting booths, or errors having to do merely with the characteristics of punch card ballots (resulting in hanging, dimpled, or pregnant [[Chad (paper)|chads]]).

A proposed solution to these problems was the installation of modern [[electronic voting]] machines. The United States presidential election of 2000 spurred the debate about election and voting reform, but it did not end it.

In the aftermath of the election, the [[Help America Vote Act]] (HAVA) was passed to help states upgrade their election technology in the hopes of preventing similar problems in future elections. Unfortunately, the electronic voting systems that many states purchased to comply with HAVA actually caused problems in the presidential election of 2004.<ref>Freeman, Steven & Bleifuss, Joel. Was the 2004 election stolen?: exit polls, election fraud, and the official count. Seven Stories Press, 2006, p. 68-83.</ref>

===Exit polling and declaration of vote winners===
The [[Voter News Service]]'s reputation was damaged by its treatment of Florida's presidential vote in 2000. Breaking its own guidelines,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} VNS called the state as a win for Gore 12 minutes before polls closed in the [[Florida Panhandle|Florida panhandle]]. Although most of the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, counties in the Florida panhandle, located in the Central Time Zone, had not yet closed their polls. Discrepancies between the results of exit polls and the actual vote count caused the VNS to change its call twice, first from Gore to Bush and then to "too close to call". Due in part to this (and other polling inaccuracies){{citation needed|date=February 2017}} the VNS was disbanded in 2003.

According to Bush adviser [[Karl Rove]], exit polls early in the afternoon on election day showed Gore winning by three percentage points, but when the networks called the state for Gore, Bush led by about 75,000 votes in raw tallies from the [[Florida Secretary of State]].

Charges of media bias were leveled against the networks by Republicans, who claimed that the networks called states more quickly for Al Gore than for George W. Bush. Congress held hearings on this matter,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} at which the networks claimed to have no intentional bias in their election night reporting. A study of the calls made on election night 2000 indicated that states carried by Gore were called more quickly than states won by Bush{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}; however, notable states carried by Bush, such as New Hampshire and Florida, were very close, and close states won by Gore, such as Iowa, Oregon, New Mexico and Wisconsin, were called late as well.<ref>[[Joseph Uscinski]]. 2007. "Too Close Too Call? Uncertainty and Bias in Election Night Reporting" Social Science Quarterly vol. 88,(1).</ref>

The early call of Florida for Gore has been alleged to have cost Bush several close states, including Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wisconsin.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} In each of these states, Gore won by less than 10,000 votes, and the polls closed after the networks called Florida for Gore. Because the Florida call was widely seen as an indicator that Gore had won the election, it is possible that it depressed Republican turnout in these states during the final hours of voting, giving Gore the slim margin by which he carried each of them.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The call may have also affected the outcome of the [[United States Senate election in Washington, 2000|Senate election in Washington state]], where incumbent Republican [[Slade Gorton]] was defeated by approximately 2,000 votes.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Ralph Nader spoiler controversy===
{{Further|Ralph Nader presidential campaign, 2000#The "spoiler" controversy}}
Many Gore supporters claimed that third-party candidate Nader acted as a [[spoiler effect|spoiler]] in the election, under the presumption that Nader voters would have voted for Gore had Nader not been in the race.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/tweedledee-indeed/|title=Tweedledee, Indeed|journal=The Nation|first=Eric|last=Alterman|date=March 22, 2001|access-date=December 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210111434/https://www.thenation.com/article/tweedledee-indeed/|archive-date=February 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Nader received 2.74 percent of the popular vote nationwide, getting 97,000 votes in Florida (by comparison, there were 111,251 [[overvotes]])<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2001-05-10-overvotetable.htm |work=USA Today |title=Overvote county summary |date=May 10, 2001 |access-date=September 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630154726/http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2001-05-10-overvotetable.htm |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Herron |first1= Michael C. |last2= Lewis |first2= Jeffrey B. |title= Did Ralph Nader spoil Al Gore's Presidential bid?

Winning either state would have won the general election for Gore. Defenders of Nader, including [[Tom Tomorrow|Dan Perkins]], argued that the margin in Florida was small enough that Democrats could blame any number of third-party candidates for the defeat, including [[Workers World Party]] candidate [[Monica Moorehead]], who received 1,500 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.salon.com/comics/tomo/2000/11/13/tomo/index.html|title=This Modern World|work=Salon.com Comics|access-date=May 23, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315015827/http://archive.salon.com/comics/tomo/2000/11/13/tomo/index.html|archive-date=March 15, 2006|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> But the controversy with Nader also drained energy from the Democratic Party as divisive debate went on in the months leading up to the election.

Nader's reputation was hurt by this perception, which may have hindered his goals as an activist. For example, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' wrote about the so-called "rank-and-file liberals" who saw Nader negatively after the election and pointed out that [[Public Citizen]], the organization Nader founded in 1971, suffered a drop in contributions. ''Mother Jones'' also cited a Public Citizen letter sent out to people interested in Nader's relation with the organization at that time, with the disclaimer: "Although Ralph Nader was our founder, he has not held an official position in the organization since 1980 and does not serve on the board.

Democratic party strategist and [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC) chair [[Al From]] expressed a different view. In the January 24, 2001, issue<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Blueprint-2000dec-00004 |title=Building A New Progressive Majority by Al From |publisher=DLC |date=January 24, 2001 |accessdate=January 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130084859/http://www.unz.org/Pub/Blueprint-2000dec-00004 |archive-date=January 30, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> of the DLC's ''Blueprint'' magazine,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ndol.org/ndol_ka.cfm?kaid=132 |title=Democratic Leadership Council: Blueprint Magazine |publisher=Ndol.org |accessdate=January 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818141457/http://www.ndol.org/ndol_ka.cfm?kaid=132 |archive-date=August 18, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> he wrote, "I think they're wrong on all counts. The assertion that Nader's marginal vote hurt Gore is not borne out by polling data. When exit pollers asked voters how they would have voted in a two-way race, Bush actually won by a point. That was better than he did with Nader in the race."

In an online article published by ''[[Salon.com]]'' on Tuesday, November 28, 2000, Texan progressive activist [[Jim Hightower]] claimed that in Florida, a state Gore lost by only 537 votes, 24,000 Democrats voted for Nader, while another 308,000 Democrats voted for Bush. According to Hightower, 191,000 self-described liberals in Florida voted for Bush, while fewer than 34,000 voted for Nader.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/2000/11/28/hightower/ |title=How Florida Democrats torpedoed Gore - Salon.com |access-date=November 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111183522/https://www.salon.com/2000/11/28/hightower/ |archive-date=November 11, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Press influence on race===
In their 2007 book ''The Nightly News Nightmare: Network Television's Coverage of US Presidential Elections, 1988–2004'', professors Stephen J. Farnsworth and S. Robert Lichter alleged most media outlets influenced the outcome of the election through the use of [[horse race journalism]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/nightlynewsnight0000farn |url-access=registration |author1=Farnsworth, S.J.|author2=Lichter, S.R.|title=The Nightly News Nightmare: Network Television's Coverage of US Presidential Elections, 1988–2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nightlynewsnight0000farn/page/n174 159]–160|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2007|isbn=9780742553774}}</ref> Some liberal supporters of Al Gore argued that the media had a bias against Gore and in favor of Bush. Peter Hart and Jim Naureckas, two commentators for [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR), called the media "serial exaggerators" and alleged that several media outlets were constantly exaggerating criticism of Gore:<ref name=ipqvzww>{{cite news|title=Serial Exaggerators: Media's double standard on political lying|first1=Peter|last1=Hart|first2=Jim|last2=Naureckas|date=January 1, 2001|url=http://fair.org/extra/serial-exaggerators/|publisher=FAIR|access-date=December 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220045744/http://fair.org/extra/serial-exaggerators/|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> they alleged that the media falsely claimed Gore lied when he claimed he spoke in an overcrowded science class in Sarasota, Florida,<ref name=ipqvzww/> and also alleged the media gave Bush a pass on certain issues, such as Bush allegedly exaggerating how much money he signed into the annual Texas state budget to help the uninsured during his second debate with Gore in October 2000.<ref name=ipqvzww/> In the April 2000 issue of ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', columnist [[Robert Parry (journalist)|Robert Parry]] also alleged that media outlets exaggerated Gore's supposed claim that he "discovered" the [[Love Canal]] neighborhood in [[Niagara Falls, New York]] during a campaign speech in Concord, New Hampshire on November 30, 1999,<ref name=kqvz/> when he had only claimed he "found" it after it was already evacuated in 1978 because of chemical contamination.<ref name=kqvz>{{cite magazine|title=He's No Pinocchio: How the press exaggerated Al Gores exaggerations|first=Robert|last=Parry|date=April 2000|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2000/0004.parry.html|magazine=Washington Monthly|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115051407/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2000/0004.parry.html|archivedate=November 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' columnist [[Eric Boehlert]] also alleged media outlets exaggerated criticism of Gore as early as July 22, 1999,<ref name=ipqkva>[[Eric Boehlert|Boehlert, Eric]], (December 6, 2001), "The Press v.

===Color coding===
This is the election that fixed red as a color for the Republican Party and blue for the Democrats. ''[[The New York Times]]'' used these colors on their full-color election maps. Senior graphics editor Archie Tse, decided that as Republican started with an ''R'' then red "was a more natural association". Prior to that color coding choices were inconsistent across the media. In 1976, in its first election map on air, NBC used bulbs that turned red for Carter-won states (Democratic), and blue for Ford (Republican). This original color scheme was based on the British political system, where blue is used to denote the centre-right Conservative Party and red for the centre-left Labour Party (gold or yellow is used for the 'third party' Liberal Democrats). However, the NBC format did not catch on long term, as the media did not follow suit. The unusually long 2000 election helped to cement red and blue as colors in the collective mind.<ref name="Verge 2012">{{cite web |last1=Streams |first1=Kimber |title=Why are Republicans red and Democrats blue? |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/6/3609534/republicans-red-democrats-blue-why-election |website=The Verge |accessdate=11 August 2018 |date=November 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811195016/https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/6/3609534/republicans-red-democrats-blue-why-election |archive-date=August 11, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Effects on future elections and Supreme Court===
A number of subsequent articles have characterized the election in 2000, and the Supreme Court's decision in ''Bush v. Gore'', as damaging the reputation of the Supreme Court, increasing the view of judges as partisan, and decreasing Americans' trust in the integrity of elections.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/ct-xpm-2012-07-02-ct-oped-0702-krauthammer-20120702-17-story.html | title=Why Roberts did it | access-date=July 4, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703052113/https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/ct-xpm-2012-07-02-ct-oped-0702-krauthammer-20120702-17-story.html | archive-date=July 3, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=4557&context=ylj</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1417&context=facpub |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531023521/https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1417&context=facpub |archive-date=May 31, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url=https://theweek.com/articles/488658/legacy-bush-v-gore| title=The legacy of Bush v.
