Before taking up the post, the Progress Party had announced that it would be reducing the amount of [[toll roads]], and this was widely expected to be one of the most important transformation reforms.<ref>{{cite news|last=Andersen |first=Christina |title=Frp går tilbake på bompenger |url=http://www.abcnyheter.no/motor/2013/09/11/frp-gar-tilbake-pa-bompenger |accessdate=13 January 2014 |newspaper=An.no |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114092148/http://www.abcnyheter.no/motor/2013/09/11/frp-gar-tilbake-pa-bompenger |archive-date=14 January 2014 }}</ref> Despite immediately beginning to dismantle some existing toll booths, and cancelling some planned toll projects, there was disappointment among his party's core constituency over the slow pace of the reform.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fossen|first=Cato|title=Her er den første bomstasjonen Frp stanser|url=http://www.nrk.no/norge/frp-stanser-ett-bompengeprosjekt-1.11342103|accessdate=13 January 2014|newspaper=Nrk.no}}</ref>

Solvik-Olsen has stated that he thinks Norway needs a "liberalism that is pragmatic". He was noted as a critic of the [[Red-Green Coalition|Red-Green]] governmental [[green politics|environmental policies]], claiming their policies to be based too much on "symbol politics" and unrealistic ambitious goals, instead of seeking feasible realistic options.<ref name=tu>{{cite news|url=http://www.tu.no/energi/article201303.ece|work=Teknisk Ukeblad|title=– Liberalisme er ikke anarki|first=Truls|last=Tunmo|date=17 March 2009}}</ref> He has said that he is personally [[social conservative]], though is [[laissez-faire|liberal]] with regards to how other people wish to live their lives.<ref name=tu/>

A lifelong [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]], he abstains from all stimulants, including tobacco, and coffee. He is however, a notorious aficionado of [[chocolate]], an addiction which has been described as "morbid".<ref>{{cite news|last=Erikstad|first=Vegard|title=Han mener trening er hysteri om han ikke får spise sjokolade samtidig|url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/naringsliv/article2645864.ece|accessdate=13 January 2014|newspaper=Dn.no}}</ref> He compensates the high-sugar diet by eating very small regular meals, and skipping lunch altogether.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johansen|first=Robert|title=Ketil Solvik-Olsen: - Ikke fortell noe negativt om meg|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/Ketil-Solvik-Olsen---Ikke-fortell-noe-negativt-om-meg-7347174.html#.UtQdfaizxCc|accessdate=13 January 2014|newspaper=Aftenposten}}</ref> Since his stay in the United States, Solvik-Olsen has been an [[Car tuning|automobile enthusiast]], his collection includes a second generation 1985 model [[Cadillac Seville]], a convertible [[Dodge Stratus]], in addition to over 80 [[Model car]]s.<ref name=ce/> He is a supporter of [[Bryne FK]] football club.<ref>{{cite news|last=Oppedal|first=Mathias|title=Rogalendingane dominerte på Slottsplassen|url=http://www.nrk.no/rogaland/da-rogaland-overtok-regjeringa-1.11300557|accessdate=13 January 2014|newspaper=nrk.no|date=16 October 2013}}</ref>

Solvik-Olsen publicly announced his withdrawal from the [[Church of Norway]] in 2010, after the church leadership had publicly opposed [[oil exploration]] in [[Lofoten]] and [[Vesterålen]].<ref name=vl/> He is connected to [[Pentecostalism]], as he for several years has attended the Pentecostal congregation ''Filadelfia''.<ref name=ce>{{cite news|last=Natland|first=Jarle|title=Folk: Vi som elsker Amerika|url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/nyheter/lokalt/Vi-som-elsker-Amerika-2755172.html#.UtQx8KizxCc|date=4 April 2003|accessdate=13 January 2014|newspaper=Aftenbladet.no}}</ref> While his wife is a member of the congregation and his two children are [[Infant baptism|baptised]] there, he is not a formal member himself since it requires a [[Believer's baptism]], and he considers his childhood baptism to be valid and sufficient. He has stated that as of present he only has his personal direct contact with God, not being part of any "earthly membership lists".<ref name=vl/>
