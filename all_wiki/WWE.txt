WWE has also branched out into other fields, including [[WWE Studios|movies]], [[XFL (2001)|football]], and [[WWE#Expansion beyond wrestling|various other business ventures]].

The WWE name also refers to the [[professional wrestling promotion]] itself, founded in the 1950s as the [[Capitol Wrestling Corporation]].

As in other professional wrestling promotions, WWE shows are not legitimate contests, but purely [[Sports entertainment|entertainment-based]] performance theater, featuring [[Angle (professional wrestling)|storyline]]-driven, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|scripted]], and partially choreographed matches, though matches often include moves that can put performers at risk of injury, even death, if not performed correctly. This was first publicly acknowledged by WWE's owner [[Vince McMahon]] in 1989 to avoid taxes from athletic commissions. Since the 1980s, WWE publicly has branded its product as [[sports entertainment]], acknowledging the product's roots in competitive sport and dramatic theater.

The company's majority owner is its chairman and CEO, third-generation wrestling promoter Vince McMahon, who retains a 42% ownership of the company's outstanding stock and 70.5% of the voting power.<ref name="Ownership">{{cite web|url=http://otp.investis.com/clients/us/wwe/SEC/sec-show.aspx?FilingId=12610278&Cik=0001091907&Type=PDF&hasPdf=1|title=WWE Definitive Proxy Statement 2018|page=7|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|date=March 9, 2018|accessdate=October 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Barrons85m">{{Cite web | url=https://www.barrons.com/articles/wwe-ceo-vince-mcmahon-bags-85-million-stock-payday-51585336562 |title = WWE CEO Vince McMahon in $85 Million Stock Deal with Morgan Stanley}}</ref>

The current entity, incorporated on February 21, 1980, was previously known as '''Titan Sports, Inc.''', which was founded that same year in [[South Yarmouth, Massachusetts]]. It acquired Capitol Wrestling Corporation Ltd., the holding company for the World Wrestling Federation, in 1982.

Titan was renamed '''World Wrestling Federation, Inc.''' in 1998, then '''World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc.''' in 1999, and finally the current '''World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.''' in 2002.

==Company history==
{{Main|History of WWE}}

===Capitol Wrestling Corporation (1953–1963)===
{{Main|Capitol Wrestling Corporation}}
WWE's origins can be traced back as far as the 1950s when on January 7, 1953, the first show under the '''[[Capitol Wrestling Corporation]]''' ('''CWC''') was produced. There is uncertainty as to who the founder of the CWC was. Some sources state that it was [[Vincent J. McMahon]] <ref>{{Cite book|title=Capitol Revolution: The Rise of the McMahon Wrestling Empire|last=Hornbaker|first=Tim|date=2015|page=117|id={{ASIN|1770411240|country=de}}|quote=He Inaugurated his promotion on January 7, 1953, [...].}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=WWE Legends|last=Solomon|first=Brian|date=2006|page=6|id={{ASIN|0743490339|country=de}}|quote=McMahon formed a company he called the Capitol Wrestling Corporation, and presented his first regular wrestling show under the Capitol banner on January 7, 1953}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia of Sports Entertainment|last=Sullivan, Greenberg & Pantaleo|date=2016|page=372|isbn = 978-1465453136|quote=On January 7, 1953, he put on the first-ever Capitol Wrestling Corporation event}}</ref> while other sources cite McMahon's father [[Jess McMahon]] as founder of CWC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/superstars/vincemcmahon|title=Vincent J.

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation (1963–1979) ===
Vincent J. McMahon and Toots Mondt were very successful and soon controlled approximately 70% of the NWA's booking, largely due to their dominance in the heavily populated [[Northeastern United States]]. In 1963, McMahon and Mondt had a dispute with the NWA over [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|"Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers]] being booked to hold the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]].<ref name="won2011">{{cite journal|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=July 20, 2011|title=NWA World Heavyweight Championship}}</ref> Mondt and McMahon were not only promoters but also acted as Buddy's manager and were accused by other NWA promoters of withholding Buddy making defenses in their cities versus only defending in Mondt and McMahon's own cities thus maintaining a monopoly on the World Heavyweight Championship. In a now infamous situation, the NWA sent former 5-time World Champion and legitimate wrestler Lou Thesz to Toronto to face Buddy Rogers on January 24, 1963. Thesz recalls this was not planned and prior to the match remembered telling Buddy "we can do this the easy way or the hard way." Buddy agreed to lose the fall and title in a one fall match versus the traditional two out of three fall matchup that most World Title matches were defended. Once word reached back to Mondt and McMahon, at first they simply ignored the title change. From January until April 1963, Buddy Rogers was promoted as the NWA World Champion or simply the World Heavyweight Champion in their area. The World Wide Wrestling Federation was not an immediate creation as once thought the day after Rogers' one fall loss to Thesz. Mondt and McMahon both eventually left the NWA in protest and formed the '''World Wide Wrestling Federation''' ('''WWWF''') in the process. They brought along with them Willie Gilzenberg, long time boxing and wrestling promoter in New Jersey. In June 1963, Gilzenberg was named the first president of the World Wide Wrestling Federation. The WWE traditionally views this as beginning of their history <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smile.amazon.de/WWE-50-Kevin-Sullivan/dp/1465419233/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=50+years+wwe+book&qid=1580427614&sr=8-1-fkmr1|title=WWE 50: Celebrating 50 years of Sports Entertainment|last=Sullivan|first=Kevin|date=2014}}</ref> with Buddy Rogers winning a fictitious tournament in Rio de Janeiro on April 25, 1963 when he defeated long time Capitol Sports favorite Antonino Rocca. In truth, Rocca was no longer in the area as he was working for Jim Crockett Sr. in the Carolinas. Buddy Rogers also had already suffered what would later be a career ending heart attack on April 18 in Akron, Ohio and was in an Ohio hospital during the time the alleged tournament took place.<ref>http://wrestlingclassics.com/.ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=10;t=005277;p=3</ref> Mondt left Capitol in the late 1960s and although the WWWF had withdrawn from the NWA, Vince McMahon, Sr. quietly re-joined in 1971.

==== Transition (1979–1982) ====
Vincent J. McMahon's son, [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]], and his wife [[Linda McMahon|Linda]], established '''Titan Sports, Inc.''', in 1980 in [[South Yarmouth, Massachusetts]] and applied trademarks for the initials "WWF".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/19882005690FSupp1315_11786.xml/TITAN%20SPORTS,%20INC.%20v.%20COMICS%20WORLD%20CORP|title=Titan Sports, Inc.

====The Golden Era (1982–1992)====
{{Main|1980s professional wrestling boom}}
[[File:Vince McMahon 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vince McMahon]], the owner, chairman and CEO of the WWE since 1982]]
The younger McMahon bought Capitol from his father in 1982, effectively seizing control of the company. The actual date of sale is still unknown but the generally accepted date is June 6, 1982; however this was likely the date the deal was struck. On WWF television, Capitol Wrestling Corporation maintained copyrights and ownership past the June 1982 date. The World Wrestling Federation was not solely owned by Vince Sr but also by Gorilla Monsoon, Arnold Skaaland and Phil Zacko. The deal between the two McMahons was a monthly payment basis where if a single payment was missed, ownership would revert to McMahon Sr. and his business partners. Looking to seal the deal quickly, McMahon Jr. took several loans and deals with other promoters and the business partners (including the promise of a job for life) in order to take full ownership by May or June 1983 for an estimated total of roughly $1 million with the three business partners receiving roughly $815,000 among them and Vincent J McMahon receiving roughly $185,000.<ref>Death of the Territories: Expansion, Betrayal and the War that Changed Pro Wrestling Forever by Tim Hornbaker.

At the annual meeting of the NWA in 1983, the McMahons and former Capitol employee [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]] all withdrew from the organization.<ref name=won2011/> McMahon also worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States. This angered other promoters and disrupted the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions, eventually ending the territory system, which was in use since the founding of the NWA in the 1940s. In addition, the company used income generated by advertising, television deals, and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters.

In an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', McMahon noted: {{bquote|In the old days, there were wrestling fiefdoms all over the country, each with its own little lord in charge. Each little lord respected the rights of his neighboring little lord. No takeovers or raids were allowed. There were maybe 30 of these tiny kingdoms in the U.S. and if I hadn't bought out my dad, there would still be 30 of them, fragmented and struggling. I, of course, had no allegiance to those little lords.<ref name=si/>}}

McMahon gained significant traction when he hired [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) talent [[Hulk Hogan]], who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling, notably for his appearance in the film ''[[Rocky III]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|0084602}}</ref> McMahon signed [[Roddy Piper]] as Hogan's rival, and then shortly afterward [[Jesse Ventura]] as an announcer. Other wrestlers joined the roster, such as [[Jimmy Snuka]], [[Don Muraco]], [[The Iron Sheik]], [[Nikolai Volkoff]], [[Junkyard Dog]], [[Paul Orndorff]], [[Greg Valentine]], and [[Ricky Steamboat]]. Many of the wrestlers who would later join the WWF were former AWA or NWA talent.

The WWF would tour nationally in a venture that would require a huge capital investment, one that placed the WWF on the verge of financial collapse. The future of McMahon's experiment came down to the success or failure of McMahon's groundbreaking concept, [[WrestleMania]]. WrestleMania was a major success and was (and still is) marketed as the [[Super Bowl]] of professional wrestling. The concept of a wrestling [[Card (sports)|supercard]] was nothing new in North America; the NWA had begun running [[Starrcade]] a few years prior. In McMahon's eyes, however, what separated WrestleMania from other supercards was that it was intended to be accessible to those who did not watch wrestling. He invited celebrities such as [[Mr. T]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Cyndi Lauper]] to participate in the event, as well as securing a deal with [[MTV]] to provide coverage. The event and hype surrounding it led to the term ''[[Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]'', due to the cross-promotion of [[popular culture]] and professional wrestling.

The WWF business expanded significantly on the shoulders of McMahon and his [[face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] hero Hulk Hogan for the next several years. The introduction of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' on [[NBC]] in 1985 marked the first time that professional wrestling had been broadcast on network television since the 1950s when the now-defunct [[DuMont Television Network]] broadcast matches of Vince McMahon Sr.'s Capitol Wrestling Corporation. The 1980s "Wrestling Boom" peaked with the [[WrestleMania III]] pay-per-view at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1987, which set an attendance record of 93,173, a record that stood for 29 years until [[WrestleMania 32]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/wrestlemania-32--record-and-reputations-tumble-075620564.html|title=Wrestlemania 32: Record and reputations tumble|publisher=|accessdate=March 15, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061259/https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/wrestlemania-32--record-and-reputations-tumble-075620564.html|archivedate=October 7, 2016}}</ref> A rematch of the WrestleMania III main event between WWF champion Hulk Hogan and [[André the Giant]] took place on ''[[The Main Event I]]'' in 1988 and was seen by 33 million people, the most-watched wrestling match in North American television history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania3.html|title=Steamboat&nbsp;— Savage rule WrestleMania 3|last=Powell|first=John|publisher=SLAM!

In 1985, Titan moved its offices to [[Stamford, Connecticut]], though the [[Titan Towers|current building]] was built in 1981. Subsequently, a new Titan Sports, Inc. (originally WWF, Inc.) was established in [[Delaware]] in 1987 and was consolidated with the Massachusetts entity in February 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000095013099005812/0000950130-99-005812.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 17, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710093918/https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000095013099005812/0000950130-99-005812.txt |archivedate=July 10, 2017}}</ref>

====New Generation Era (1992–1997)====
{{Main|Monday Night Wars}}
The WWF was hit with allegations of [[Anabolic steroid|steroid]] abuse and distribution in 1992. This was followed by allegations of [[sexual harassment]] by WWF employees the following year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/linda-mcmahon-wwe-sexual-harassment_n_585c1bc0e4b0d9a594577de6|title=Trump's Small Business Pick Defended Wrestling Empire Against Teen Sex Abuse Allegations|last1=Liebelson|first1=Dana|last2=Waldron|first2=Travis|date=2016-12-22|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/809312-wwe-wellness-fallout-a-brief-history-of-drug-testing-in-professional-wrestling|title=WWE Wellness Fallout: A Brief History of Drug Testing in Professional Wrestling|last=Bixenspan|first=David|website=Bleacher Report|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> McMahon was eventually exonerated, but the allegations brought bad [[public relations]] for the WWF, and an overall bad reputation. The steroid trial cost the company an estimated $5 million at a time of record low revenues. This helped drive many WWF wrestlers over to rival promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), including 1980s babyface hero Hulk Hogan. During this period, the WWF promoted wrestlers of a younger age comprising "The New Generation", featuring [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]], [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], [[Bret Hart]], and [[The Undertaker]], in an effort to promote new talent into the spotlight.

In January 1993, the WWF debuted its flagship cable program ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''. WCW countered in September 1995 with its own Monday night program, ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'', which aired in the same time slot as ''Raw''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|title=WWE: History of WrestleMania|year=2009|page=53}}</ref> The two programs would trade wins in the ensuing [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] competition (known as the "[[Monday Night Wars]]") until mid-1996. At that point, ''Nitro'' began a nearly two-year ratings domination that was largely fueled by the introduction of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo), a stable led by former WWF performers Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall (the former Razor Ramon), and Kevin Nash (the former Diesel).<ref>{{cite web|last=Scaia|first=Rick|title=RAW vs. Nitro: Year One|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/features/mnw-y1.shtml|publisher=Online Onslaught Wrestling|accessdate=April 10, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516125131/http://www.oowrestling.com/features/mnw-y1.shtml|archivedate=May 16, 2008}}</ref>

====The Attitude Era (1997–2002)====
{{Main|Attitude Era}}
{{See also|Montreal Screwjob}}
As the Monday Night Wars continued between ''Raw Is War'' and WCW's ''Nitro'', the WWF would transform itself from a family-friendly product into a more adult-oriented product, known as the [[Attitude Era]]. The era was spearheaded by WWF VP [[Shane McMahon]] (son of owner Vince McMahon) and head writer [[Vince Russo]].

1997 ended with McMahon facing real-life controversy following [[Bret Hart]]'s controversial departure from the company, dubbed as the [[Montreal Screwjob]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Mick Foley|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2000|page=648|isbn=0-06-103101-1|title-link=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks}}</ref> This proved to be one of several founding factors in the launch of the Attitude Era as well as the creation of McMahon's on-screen character, "[[Vince McMahon#Mr. McMahon (1997)|Mr. McMahon]]".

Before the Montreal Screwjob, which took place at the [[Survivor Series (1997)|1997 Survivor Series]], former WCW talent were being hired by the WWF, including [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[Mick Foley|Mankind]], and [[Big Van Vader|Vader]]. Austin was slowly brought in as the new face of the company despite being promoted as an [[antihero]], starting with his "[[Stone Cold Steve Austin#Austin 3:16 (1996–1997)|Austin 3:16]]" speech shortly after defeating [[Jake Roberts]] in the tournament finals at the [[King of the Ring (1996)|King of the Ring]] pay-per-view in 1996.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foley|first=Mick|title=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2000|page=229|isbn=0-06-103101-1|title-link=Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks}}</ref>

On May 6, 1998, Titan Sports, Inc. was renamed '''World Wrestling Federation, Inc'''. It was renamed '''World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc'''. a year later.

On April 29, 1999, the WWF made its return to [[terrestrial television]], airing a special program known as ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' on the fledgling [[UPN]] network. The Thursday night show became a weekly series on August 26, 1999—competing directly with WCW's Thursday night program ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]'' on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]. In 2000, the WWF, in collaboration with television network [[NBC]], announced the creation of the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]], a new professional [[American football|football]] league that debuted in 2001.<ref name=xfl>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2000/2000_02_03.jsp|title=WWE Entertainment, Inc. announces the formation of the XFL – a new professional football league|accessdate=May 5, 2007|date=February 3, 2000|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406072307/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2000/2000_02_03.jsp|archivedate=April 6, 2007}}</ref> The league had high ratings for the first few weeks, but initial interest waned and its ratings plunged to dismally low levels (one of its games was the lowest-rated prime-time show in the history of American television).

On October 19, 1999, World Wrestling Federation, Inc. launched an [[initial public offering]] as a publicly traded company, trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) with the issuance of stock then valued at $172.5 million.<ref name="money.cnn.com">[https://money.cnn.com/1999/08/03/companies/wrestling/ "WWF pins IPO," CNN Money, August 3, 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606230532/http://money.cnn.com/1999/08/03/companies/wrestling/ |date=June 6, 2014 }}, Retrieved June 5, 2014.</ref> The company has traded on the NYSE since its launch under ticker symbol WWE.<ref name="nyse.com">[https://www.nyse.com/about/listed/lcddata.html?ticker=wwe "World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., NYSE.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509111600/http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/lcddata.html?ticker=wwe |date=May 9, 2013 }}, accessed June 5, 2014.</ref>

By the fall of 1999, the Attitude Era had turned the tide of the Monday Night Wars into WWF's favor. After [[Time Warner]] merged with [[AOL]], [[Ted Turner]]'s control over WCW was considerably reduced, and the newly merged company announced a complete lack of interest in professional wrestling as a whole and decided to sell WCW in its entirety. Although [[Eric Bischoff]], whom Time Warner fired as WCW president in October 1999, was nearing a deal to purchase the company, in March 2001 McMahon acquired the rights to WCW's trademarks, tape library, contracts, and other properties from AOL Time Warner for a number reported to be around $7 million.<ref name=wcw>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2001/2001_03_23.jsp|title=WWE Entertainment, Inc.

On May 5, 2002, the World Wrestling Federation announced it was changing both its company name and the name of its wrestling promotion to '''World Wrestling Entertainment''' (WWE) after the company lost a lawsuit initiated by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] over the WWF trademark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://contracts.onecle.com/wwe/wwf.settle.1994.01.20.shtml|title=World Wildlife Fund and Titan Sports, Inc. legal settlement|publisher=Contracts.onecle.com|date=January 20, 1994|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref> Although mainly caused by an unfavorable ruling in its [[WWE#WWF name dispute|dispute]] with the [[World Wildlife Fund]] regarding the "WWF" initialism, the company noted it provided an opportunity to emphasize its focus on entertainment.<ref name=GetFOut />

==== First brand split (2002–2011) ====
{{Main|WWE brand extension|WWE draft}}

In March 2002, WWE decided to create two separate rosters, with each group of wrestlers appearing on one of their main programs, ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown!'', due to the overabundance of talent left over from the [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|Invasion storyline]]. This was dubbed as the "[[WWE brand extension|brand extension]]".

Beginning in 2002 a [[WWE draft|draft lottery]] was held nearly every year to set the rosters, with the first draft to determine the inaugural split rosters, and subsequent drafts designed to refresh the rosters of each show. On May 26, 2006, WWE announced the relaunch of [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW as a third WWE brand]]. The [[ECW (WWE)|new ECW]] program aired until February 16, 2010.<ref name=SciFi>{{cite web|title=WWE brings ECW to Sci Fi Channel|publisher=WWE.com|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/scifi|accessdate=August 28, 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813175344/http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/scifi|archivedate=August 13, 2006}}</ref> All ECW wrestlers at that point became free agents that could sign either Raw or SmackDown.

On April 7, 2011, WWE, via the WWE Corporate website, announced that the company was ceasing use of the full name World Wrestling Entertainment and would henceforth refer to itself solely as '''WWE''', making the latter an [[Pseudo-acronym|orphan initialism]]. This was said to reflect WWE's global entertainment expansion away from the ring with the ultimate goal of acquiring entertainment companies and putting a focus on television, live events, and film production. WWE noted that their new company model was put into effect with the relaunch of ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'', being a non–scripted program (contrary to the scripted nature of professional wrestling) and with the launch of the [[WWE Network]] (at the time scheduled to launch in 2012; later pushed back to 2014). However, the legal name of the company remains as World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.<ref name="2011name"/>

==== End of the brand split (2011–2016) ====
Beginning with the August 29, 2011 episode of ''Raw'', it was announced that ''Raw'' would feature talent from both ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'', and would be known as ''Raw Supershow'' (the "Supershow" suffix would be dropped on July 23, 2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011/08/29|title=Shows|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220183600/http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011/08/29|archivedate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> Championships previously exclusive to one show or the other were available for wrestlers from any show to compete for; the "Supershow" format would mark the end of the brand extension, as all programming and live events from when the original announcement was made until July 2016 featured the full WWE roster.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tom Herrera|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/the-most-important-moments-in-raw-history/page-11|title=The 10 most important moments in Raw history|publisher=WWE.com|date=January 11, 2014|accessdate=February 2, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207043137/http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/the-most-important-moments-in-raw-history/page-11|archivedate=February 7, 2014}}</ref>

In 2013, the company built the sports medicine and training facility [[WWE Performance Center]] in the east [[Orange County, Florida]] in partnership with [[Full Sail University]] from [[Winter Park, Florida]].

[[file:WWE brands.jpg|thumb|right|200px|As of 2019, WWE's three primary brands are Raw, NXT, and SmackDown.<br>Each brand features its own distinct roster, championships, and announcers.]]
On May 25, 2016, WWE announced a relaunch of the brand extension, billed as the "New Era". Following that announcement, ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'' now each feature their unique rosters, announcers, ring sets/ropes, and championships. A [[2016 WWE draft|draft]] took place to determine which wrestlers would appear on what show. ''SmackDown'' also moved from Thursdays to Tuesday nights, which began on July 19 (the night of the aforementioned draft), and airs live instead of the previous pre-recorded format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/wwe-smackdown-live-usa-1201782569/|title=WWE's 'Smackdown' Will Move To Live Broadcast On USA (Exclusive)|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=May 25, 2016|website=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=May 25, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526113045/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/wwe-smackdown-live-usa-1201782569/|archivedate=May 26, 2016}}</ref>

==Terminology==
WWE uses a variety of special terms in promoting their product, such as describing the wrestling industry as [[sports entertainment]]. The fan base is referred to as "the WWE Universe". A wrestler is designated a "WWE Superstar", while retired wrestlers are described as "WWE Legends" (or "Hall of Famers" if they have been inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]]).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spotswood|first1=Beth|title=WrestleMania expected to attract 120,00 fans to Bay Area|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/WrestleMania-expected-to-attract-120-00-fans-to-6145870.php|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=March 21, 2015|archivedate=March 31, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331102905/http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/WrestleMania-expected-to-attract-120-00-fans-to-6145870.php}}</ref>

==Contracts==
{{Main|List of WWE personnel}}
WWE signs most of its talent to exclusive contracts, meaning talent can appear or perform only on WWE programming and events. They are not permitted to appear or perform for another promotion unless special arrangements are made beforehand. WWE keeps all wrestlers' salary, employment length, benefits, and all other contract details strictly private.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2015/03/28/breaking-down-how-wwe-contracts-work/|title=Breaking down how WWE contracts work|magazine=[[Forbes]].com|date=March 28, 2015|accessdate=October 4, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002163718/http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2015/03/28/breaking-down-how-wwe-contracts-work/|archivedate=October 2, 2015}}</ref>

WWE classifies its professional wrestlers as [[independent contractor]]s and not as employees. A study by the [[University of Louisville School of Law|''University of Louisville Law Review'']] found that after applying the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 20-factor test, 16 factors "clearly indicate that wrestlers are employees". However, as a result of WWE terming them as independent contractors, "the wrestlers are denied countless benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cowley|first1=David|title=Employees vs. independent contractors and professional wrestling|url=http://louisvillelawreview.org/sites/louisvillelawreview.org/files/pdfs/printcontent/53/1/10-Cowley.pdf|accessdate=July 3, 2015|archivedate=July 3, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703063128/http://louisvillelawreview.org/sites/louisvillelawreview.org/files/pdfs/printcontent/53/1/10-Cowley.pdf|publisher=[[University of Louisville School of Law|University of Louisville Law Review]]}}</ref>

In September 2020, WWE reportedly told wrestlers that they could no longer "engage with outside third parties", such as [[Cameo (website)|Cameo]], and claimed that the WWE "owns the real names of talent, not just their character names".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2020/09/exclusive-vince-mcmahon-threatens-to-punish-talent-engaging-674408/|title=Exclusive: Vince McMahon Threatens To Punish Talent Engaging With Third Parties|date=4 September 2020|first1=Raj|last1=Giri|publisher=Wrestling, Inc}}</ref>

In 1991, wrestlers were subjected to independent testing for [[anabolic steroid]]s for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-07-17/sports/1991198183_1_steroid-testing-mcmahon-wwf|title=McMahon says he'll clean up steroids in WWF|accessdate=May 30, 2014|date=July 14, 1991|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140531115416/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-07-17/sports/1991198183_1_steroid-testing-mcmahon-wwf|archivedate=May 31, 2014}}</ref> The independent testing was ceased in 1996, being deemed too expensive as the company was going through financial duress at the time as a result of their competitors, [[World Championship Wrestling]], being so overwhelmingly more popular and hurting the federation's business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/e60/columns/story?id=4055522|title=WWE's Vince McMahon is still a tough target on drug-testing|accessdate=May 30, 2014|date=April 14, 2009|publisher=ESPN|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027201330/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/e60/columns/story?id=4055522|archivedate=October 27, 2013}}</ref>

The Talent Wellness Program is a comprehensive drug, alcohol, and cardiac screening program initiated in February 2006, three months after the [[sudden death of athletes|sudden death]] of one of their highest-profile and most popular talents, [[Eddie Guerrero]], who died at 38-years-old.<ref name=wwepolicy>{{cite web| url=http://corporate.wwe.com/documents/TalentWellnessProgramOutline2-27-06CORPweb.pdf| title=WWE Talent Wellness Program| accessdate=October 11, 2007| date=February 27, 2007| publisher=Corporate WWE Web Site| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025021149/http://corporate.wwe.com/documents/TalentWellnessProgramOutline2-27-06CORPweb.pdf| archivedate=October 25, 2007| df=mdy-all}}</ref> The policy tests for [[recreational drug use]] and abuse of prescription medication, including anabolic steroids.<ref name=wwepolicy/> Under the guidelines of the policy, talent is also tested annually for pre-existing or developing cardiac issues.

After the [[Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide|double-murder and suicide]] committed by one of its performers, [[Chris Benoit]], with a possible link to steroid abuse encouraged by WWE, the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] requested that WWE turn over any material regarding its talent wellness policy.<ref name=steroid>{{cite web| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20002071/| title=Congress wants WWE's info on steroids, doping| accessdate=July 29, 2007| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117012701/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20002071/| archivedate=November 17, 2007| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In August 2007, WWE and its employees defended the program in the wake of several busts of illegal pharmacy that linked WWE performers to steroid purchases even after the policy was put into place. Ten professional wrestlers were suspended for violating the Wellness Policy after reports emerged they were all customers of Signature Pharmacy in [[Orlando, Florida]]. According to a statement attributed to WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt, an eleventh wrestler was later added to the suspension list.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/more/08/30/wrestlers/| title=Fourteen wrestlers tied to pipeline| work=Sports Illustrated| date=August 30, 2007| accessdate=October 11, 2007| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628221742/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/more/08/30/wrestlers/| archivedate=June 28, 2011| df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| first=Paul| last=Farhi| title=Pro Wrestling Suspends 10 Linked to Steroid Ring| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/31/AR2007083101961.html| newspaper=[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]| date=September 1, 2007| accessdate=October 11, 2007| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517140854/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/31/AR2007083101961.html| archivedate=May 17, 2008| df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.headlineplanet.com/base/articles/1188623664.html| title=WWE Suspends Yet Another Wrestler| date=September 1, 2007| work=Headline Planet| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107162727/http://www.headlineplanet.com/base/articles/1188623664.html| archivedate=November 7, 2007}}</ref>

Because of the Wellness Policy, physicians were able to diagnose one of its performers with a heart ailment that would otherwise likely have gone unnoticed until it was too late. In August 2007, then-reigning [[WWE United States Championship|United States Champion]] [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] (real name: Hassan Assad) was diagnosed with [[Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/08102007/articles/mvpmostvaluableprogram| title=MVP's Most Valuable Program| publisher=WWE| date=August 10, 2007| accessdate=December 12, 2007| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114155517/http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/08102007/articles/mvpmostvaluableprogram| archivedate=November 14, 2007| df=mdy-all}}</ref> which can be potentially fatal if gone undiagnosed.

===Disputes with rival companies ===
In 1996, Titan Sports, the parent company of the World Wrestling Federation, sued World Championship Wrestling (WCW) over WCW implying that Scott Hall and Kevin Nash (Razor Ramon and Diesel) were invading WCW on the WWF's behalf. This led to a series of lawsuits filed by both companies as the Monday Night War heated up. The lawsuit went on for years, ending with a settlement in 2000. One of the terms gave then WWF the right to bid on WCW's assets if the company were liquidated. AOL Time Warner, the then-parent company of WCW, cancelled WCW's television shows in March 2001 and sold the company assets to the WWF.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://bleacherreport.com/articles/883214-wwe-the-5-most-interesting-excerpts-from-wwe-related-lawsuit-filings-case-law|title= WWE: The 5 Most Interesting Excerpts from WWE-Related Lawsuit Filings & Case Law|website= Bleacher Report|accessdate= July 19, 2017|date= October 7, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170731155611/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/883214-wwe-the-5-most-interesting-excerpts-from-wwe-related-lawsuit-filings-case-law|archivedate= July 31, 2017|df= mdy-all}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=February 2019}}

On May 23, 2012, [[Impact Wrestling|Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA, now Impact Wrestling) sued former employee Brian Wittenstein and WWE. [[TNA Entertainment, LLC v. Wittenstein|The suit]] alleged that Wittenstein violated a non-disclosure agreement and shared confidential information with the WWE which represented a comparative advantage in negotiating with wrestling talent under contract with TNA. He was subsequently hired by WWE, after which TNA asserted that Wittenstein violated the agreement by downloading confidential TNA trade secrets and providing that information to WWE. Although WWE fired Wittenstein and alerted TNA officials as to the disclosure of the information, TNA claimed that WWE had access to the information for three weeks prior to disclosure and in this time, the WWE used [[Trade secret|secret contract information]] and attempted to poach their talent in violation of Tennessee's [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]].<ref name=Burr&Forman>{{cite web|url=http://www.noncompetetradesecretslaw.com/tag/tna-entertainment-llc/|title=TNA Entertainment LLC – Noncompete Trade Secrets Law|publisher=Burr & Forman Blog|accessdate=July 10, 2012|author=John Paul Nefflen|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915081303/http://www.noncompetetradesecretslaw.com/tag/tna-entertainment-llc/|archivedate=September 15, 2015}}</ref> The lawsuit was formally withdrawn without prejudice, by the plaintiff, TNA, on January 15, 2013 under a "Notice of Voluntary Nonsuit" which offers no ruling on the merits of the suit and allows TNA to potentially refile at a later date.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=TNA drops lawsuit vs. WWE this week|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_67952.shtml|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222143547/http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_67952.shtml|archivedate=February 22, 2013}}</ref>

===WWF name dispute===
In 1994, Titan Sports had entered into an agreement with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (also trademarked WWF), an environmental organization, regarding Titan's use of the "WWF" acronym, which both organizations had been using since at least March 1979. Under the agreement, Titan had agreed to cease using the written acronym "WWF" in connection with its wrestling promotion, and to minimize (though not eliminate) spoken uses of "WWF" on its broadcasts, particularly in scripted comments. In exchange, the environmental group (and its national affiliates) agreed to drop any pending litigation against Titan, and agreed not to challenge Titan's use of the full "World Wrestling Federation" name or the promotion's then-current logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000095013099005741/0000950130-99-005741.txt|title=Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1|author=World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc.|date=October 13, 1999|accessdate=December 25, 2013|at=Exhibit 10.16: Agreement between WWF – World Wide Fund for Nature and Titan Sports, Inc. dated January 20, 1994|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226073929/http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000095013099005741/0000950130-99-005741.txt|archivedate=December 26, 2013}}</ref>

On September 27, 2005, WWE released a DVD documentary focusing on Warrior's retrospective wrestling career, titled ''The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior''. The DVD featured clips of his more notable feuds and matches along with commentary from WWE stars past and present (most of which are unflattering). The DVD has provoked some controversy due to Warrior's allegations of libel by WWE against him. Originally, Warrior was asked to help with the production of the DVD, but as he refused to work with WWE, there had been some resulting animosity between Warrior and WWE over the Warrior claiming bias on the part of WWE.<ref name="Sokol">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/07/05/1127823.html|last=Sokol|first=Chris|title=Warrior speaks his mind in new shoot|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|accessdate=May 18, 2008|date=July 5, 2005}}</ref> In January 2006, Warrior filed another lawsuit against WWE in an [[Arizona]] court over the depiction of his wrestling career in ''The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior'' DVD.<ref>[http://www.wrestlemag.com/2006/01/19/wwe-ultimate-warrior-files-lawsuit-against-world-wrestling-entertainment/ WWE: Ultimate Warrior files lawsuit against World Wrestling Entertainment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128174017/http://www.wrestlemag.com/2006/01/19/wwe-ultimate-warrior-files-lawsuit-against-world-wrestling-entertainment/ |date=January 28, 2008 }}.

During Warrior's falling out with WWE, Warrior made comments that WWE has decided to not acknowledge. In 2005, Warrior went on a rant calling now former WWE announcer [[Todd Grisham]] a "queer".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/230079-the-ultimate-warrior-appears-on-byte-this|last=Clark|first=Ryan|title="The Ultimate Warrior" Appears on Byte This|publisher=|accessdate=|date=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107003843/http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/230079-the-ultimate-warrior-appears-on-byte-this|archivedate=November 7, 2017}}</ref> Warrior referred to [[Droz (wrestler)|Droz]], a former WWF wrestler who fractured two discs in his neck and is [[quadriplegic]], as a "cripple".

Warrior returned to WWE to be inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]. During his induction, he mentioned that WWE should create an award to honor those behind the scenes called the Jimmy Miranda Award, named after a long time WWE employee who died. Warrior died three days after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. WWE decided to create the Warrior Award, an award for people "who embodied the spirit of the Ultimate Warrior." The award was later given to [[Connor Michalek]] (a child who died from cancer), [[Joan Lunden]] (a journalist who was diagnosed with cancer), and [[Eric LeGrand]] (a former college football player who became a quadriplegic after an in-game injury).
