Miller disclosed her experience in being harassed many times. An article published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2017 mentioned Miller as saying that harassment happens frequently in industries and companies dominated by males.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/12/of-course-ive-experienced-sexual-harassment-says-ex-culture-secretary|title=Tory MP Maria Miller: 'Of course I've experienced sexual harassment'|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=12 October 2017|website=the Guardian|access-date=16 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516174713/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/12/of-course-ive-experienced-sexual-harassment-says-ex-culture-secretary|archive-date=16 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

She supports a campaign to expose incidents of sexual harassment on women which gained the support of other MPs like Labour Party MP [[Jess Phillips]] and Conservative MP [[George Freeman (politician)|George Freeman]]. Miller also encouraged teachers to become more stringent on harassment that takes place in schools instead of treating such behaviour as something marginal. According to the former Culture Secretary, head teachers must review existing school policies and treat sexual exploitation as a crime.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/maria-miller-tory-mp-sexual-harassment-workplace-numerous-times-basingstoke-a7998171.html|title=Tory MP Maria Miller reveals she has been sexually harassed 'numerous' times|date=13 October 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=16 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516181322/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/maria-miller-tory-mp-sexual-harassment-workplace-numerous-times-basingstoke-a7998171.html|archive-date=16 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
