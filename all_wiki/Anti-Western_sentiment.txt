{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
In many modern cases, anti-western sentiment is fueled by [[anti-imperialism]], particularly against countries that are "all are deemed guilty for the colonial crimes of the past and present" such as Germany, the UK and the Netherlands. Anti-Western sentiment occurs in many countries, even from the West itself &ndash; especially European countries. Broad anti-Western sentiment also exists in the [[Muslim world]] against Europeans and the [[United States]]. The hatred against the United States stems from their support for [[Israel]], the seizure of [[Iraq]] and the numerous sanctions on [[Iran]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/embassy-attacks-salafis-jihadists|title=Anti-western violence gripping the Arab world has little to do with a film|last=Abdul-Ahad|first=Ghaith|date=2012-09-14|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref>

[[File:Vladimir Putin 21 February 2001-2.jpg|thumb|left|Russian President Vladimir Putin with religious leaders of Russia, 2001. Putin has promoted religious traditionalism and the rejection of some Western liberal principles, like toleration of homosexuality.]]
Anti-Western sentiment in Russia dates back to 19th century from an intellectual debate between [[Westernizer|Westernists]] and [[Slavophilia|Slavophiles]]. While the former deemed Russia to be a lagging Western country, the latter rejected these claims outright and dubbed West to be 'rotten'. An important figure in Western criticism under reign of [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander the Third]] was [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], a former liberal who eventually denounced and thoroughly criticised his former views.

Under the Communist rule 'the West' eventually became synonymous with 'the capitalist world', resulting in appearance of famous propagandist cliché 'corrupting influence of the West'.

After [[Cold War]], a number of politicians in the Russian Federation have supported an explicit promotion of Russian Orthodox traditionalism, and a rejection of Western liberalism.

Some [[ultra-nationalist]] politicians, such as [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]], an anti-communist, express the most anti-Western sentiment.

[[Vladimir Putin]] has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, both at home and abroad.  Putin has attacked [[globalism]] and [[neoliberalism]],<ref>Sergei Prozorov,  "Russian conservatism in the Putin presidency: The dispersion of a hegemonic discourse." ''Journal of Political Ideologies'' 10#2 (2005): 121–143.</ref> and promoted new think tanks that stress Russian nationalism, the restoration of Russia's historical greatness, and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.<ref>Marlene Laruelle, "The Izborsky Club, or the New Conservative Avant‐Garde in Russia." ''Russian Review'' 75#4 (2016): 626–644.</ref> Putin has collaborated closely with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].
