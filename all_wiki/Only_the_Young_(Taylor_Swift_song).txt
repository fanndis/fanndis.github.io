"'''Only the Young'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. It was released on January 31, 2020, through [[Republic Records]], as a [[promotional single]] for ''[[Miss Americana]]'', a [[Netflix]] [[documentary film|documentary]] that follows Swift's life and career over several years; the song is featured in the film's ending credits. Held back from being included on Swift's seventh studio album, ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019), the song was written and produced by Swift and [[Joel Little]], inspired by [[2018 United States midterm elections]].    

As a [[protest song]], "Only the Young" discusses [[School shooting|school shootings]], [[Donald Trump]], and [[2016 United States presidential elections#Vote tampering concerns|vote-tampering concerns]] in its lyrics. It is built around an [[electropop]] production consisting of [[Trap music|trap]] beats and a whistling [[synthesizer]], and features backing vocals from Little's daughters. The song was met with critical acclaim upon release, with praise towards Swift's lyricism on [[Politics of the United States|United States politics]], addressing matters like [[Gun violence in the United States|gun violence]] and [[Mass shootings in the United States|mass shootings]]. Music critics have noted it as Swift's most politically-charged song yet.   

Entering the charts in several countries worldwide, "Only the Young" debuted at number one on the [[Digital Songs|''Billboard'' Digital Song Sales]] chart, becoming Swift's record-extending nineteenth number-one song on it. It further reached number two in New Zealand, top-20 in Scotland and the Netherlands, top-40 in Australia, Hungary and Ireland, and top-50 in Belgium and the US. The song was used in an advertisement as part of the [[Biden/Harris]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] campaign for the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 US Presidential elections]].   

==Background and composition==

Swift wrote "Only the Young" after the [[2018 United States elections]]. Chris Willman of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' termed the song as "an anthem for millennials who might've come away disillusioned with the political process".<ref name="Variety2020">{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2020/music/features/taylor-swift-politics-sundance-documentary-miss-americana-1203471910/|title=Taylor Swift: No Longer 'Polite at All Costs'|last=Willman|first=Chris|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 21, 2020|accessdate=January 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200121160238/https://variety.com/2020/music/features/taylor-swift-politics-sundance-documentary-miss-americana-1203471910/|archive-date=January 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Prior to the elections, Swift broke her political silence by endorsing two [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]: Congressman [[Jim Cooper]] for re-election to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and former [[Governor of Tennessee|Tennessee governor]] [[Phil Bredesen]] for the [[United States Senate|Senate]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/10/07/taylor-swift-getting-gasp-political-instagram-post/1562123002/|title=Taylor Swift makes rare political statement, backing Democrat in Tennessee Senate race|last=Haas|first=Susan|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=October 8, 2018|accessdate=January 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122130433/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/10/07/taylor-swift-getting-gasp-political-instagram-post/1562123002/|archive-date=January 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Swift also criticized the voting record of Bredesen's opponent, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Marsha Blackburn]].

{{Quote
 | title    = "How Midterm Elections Inspired Taylor Swift's New Song, 'Only the Young'"
 | quote    = It was hard to see so many people feel like they had canvassed and done everything and tried so hard. I saw a lot of young people's hopes dashed. And I found that to be particularly tragic, because young people are the people who feel the worst effects of gun violence, and student loans and trying to figure out how to start their lives and how to pay their bills, and climate change, and are we going to war – all these horrific situations that we find ourselves facing right now.

In an interview with Willman, Swift revealed that she held back "Only the Young" from being included on her seventh studio album ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019). She also revealed that the song is co-written and co-produced with [[Joel Little]], who worked with Swift on four songs on the album including "[[Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince]]", from which the title of the documentary comes, and that it is not intended to be a single.<ref name="Variety2">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/taylor-swift-political-song-documentary-miss-americana-1203473948/|title=How Midterm Elections Inspired Taylor Swift's New Song, 'Only the Young'|last=Willman|first=Chris|date=January 21, 2020|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=January 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200121183745/https://variety.com/2020/music/news/taylor-swift-political-song-documentary-miss-americana-1203473948/|archive-date=January 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Little added the song was the last he and Swift worked on in a week in New York City, following "[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]" and "[[Me!]]", and that his two daughters contributed backing vocals to the song.<ref name="Variety2"/>

"Only the Young" incorporates political lyrics, in contrast to her earlier work which was politically neutral. Swift urges young citizens to get involved in politics if they want things to change. She does this by alluding to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]], the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], the [[2016 United States presidential election#Vote tampering concerns|vote tampering allegations]] after the election, and issues like [[Gun violence in the United States|gun violence]] and [[school shooting]]s in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/01/31/taylor-swift-only-the-young-new-song/|title=Taylor Swift Calls Out 'Big Bad Man' Donald Trump On Inspiring New Song 'Only The Young'|last1=Brow|first1=Jason|last2=Norwin|first2=Alyssa|date=January 31, 2020|magazine=[[Hollywood Life]]|access-date=January 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131164651/https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/01/31/taylor-swift-only-the-young-new-song/|archive-date=January 31, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Vulture"/><ref name="Paper"/><ref name="Cosmopolitan"/>

The video advertisement was released on October 30, 2020. It opens with a quote from [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential]] candidate, [[Kamala Harris]], wondering why "so many powerful people are making it so difficult to vote". The rest of the video features a montage of "chaotic and hopeful" scenes from the past four years in the US: Clips of [[Me Too movement|Me Too]] and [[Black Lives Matter]] protesters, President Trump removing his face mask following a hospitalization for [[COVID-19]], Judge [[Amy Coney Barrett]] being sworn in as a [[U.S. Supreme Court Justice|Supreme Court justice]], a 75-year-old protester in Buffalo being pushed to the ground by police, and a scene of young voters and supporters of Democratic [[Presidential nominee]] [[Joe Biden]] organizing and taking part in [[early voting]]. The lyrics "And the big bad man and his big bad clan / Their hands are stained with red / Oh, how quickly, they forget" are timed to play over photos of Trump, Senators [[Mitch McConnell]] and [[Lindsey Graham]], and [[Attorney general|Attorney General]] [[William Barr|Bill Barr]]. The video ends with the motto: "You've marched for four years. Now it's time to run", and many popular hashtags, including #MeToo, [[I can't breathe|#ICantBreathe]], #WearAMask, #BidenHarris2020, [[USPS|#SaveUSPS]] and #Vote. Harris responded with thanks to Swift, and added that the singer is showing the American youth "what's at stake" in the election.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Moreau|first=Jordan|last2=|first2=|date=October 30, 2020|title=Taylor Swift Approved Her Song for This Unofficial Biden-Harris Ad|url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/taylor-swift-biden-harris-ad-only-the-young-1234819677/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 30, 2020|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|language=en-US}}</ref>
