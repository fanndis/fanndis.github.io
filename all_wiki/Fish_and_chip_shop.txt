A '''fish and chip shop''' is a form of a [[fast food restaurant]] that specialises in selling [[fish and chips]]. Usually, fish and chip shops provide [[takeaway]] service, although some have seating facilities. Variations on the name include fish bar, fisheries in [[Yorkshire]], fish shop and chip shop. In the [[United Kingdom]] including [[Northern Ireland]], they are colloquially known as a '''chippy''' or ''' fishy''', while in the rest of [[Ireland]] they are known as '''chippers'''. Fish and chip shops may also sell other foods, including variations on their core offering such as [[battered sausage]] and burgers, to regional cuisine such as [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] or [[Chinese food]].

==History==
A [[blue plaque]] at [[Oldham]]'s Tommyfield Market in England marks the 1860s origin of the fish and chip shop and [[fast food]] industries.{{cn|date=August 2020}} In 1928, [[Harry Ramsden's]] fast food restaurant chain opened in the UK. On a single day in 1952, his fish and chip shop in [[Guiseley]], [[West Yorkshire]], served 10,000 portions of fish and chips, earning itself a place in the ''[[Guinness Book Of Records]]''.{{cn|date=August 2020}} Now the "corner fish-n-chip shop" has become staple throughout the western world,{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} as well as making inroads into the middle- and far-east.

==Etymology==
The word "chip-shop" is first recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in 1953.<ref>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/31816?redirectedFrom=chip+shop#eid9512710]{{subscription required}}</ref> "Chippy" or "chippie" was first recorded in 1961.<ref>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/31840?rskey=h19y0g&result=1&isAdvanced=false#eid]{{subscription required}}</ref>
Occasionally the type of fish will be specified, as in 'Cod-n-Chips'.

==Operations==
Many British villages, suburbs, towns and cities have fish and chip shops, especially near coastal regions.

Fish and chip outlets sell roughly 30% of all the [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]] consumed in the United Kingdom, and use 10% of the UK potato [[crop]].<ref name="fff">{{cite web|url=http://www.federationoffishfriers.co.uk/pages/history--599.htm | title=As British as Fish And Chips}}</ref>

In Ireland, many "chippers" are operated by Italian immigrant families, all native to the [[Province of Frosinone]] in [[Lazio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itica.ie/history|title=The History of ITICA â€” ITICA|website=www.itica.ie}}</ref> The Italian chip shop tradition began with Giuseppe Cervi, who took a boat to America in the 1880s but instead disembarked at [[Cobh, County Cork]] and walked to [[Dublin]], establishing a takeaway at 22 [[Pearse Street|Great Brunswick Street]] (modern Pearse Street).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comeheretome.com/2017/03/14/a-postcard-giuseppe-cervi-and-the-story-of-the-dublin-chipper/|title=A postcard, Giuseppe Cervi and the story of the Dublin chipper.|date=14 March 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/how-fish-and-chips-enriched-a-nation-1.765095|title=How fish and chips enriched a nation|website=The Irish Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/romayos-3038416-Oct2016/|title=6 interesting facts from the unique history of Irish-Italian chippers|website=TheJournal.ie}}</ref>

==Regional differences==
In Scotland, the fish tends to be [[haddock]], where in England it tends to be [[cod]]. This is because both fish tend to be sourced from Scottish waters in the North Sea, and then shipped around the UK. Haddock was thought to taste better than cod when fresh, while cod tasted better a few days later. In the days before refrigerated haulage this meant that haddock would taste bad by the time it made it out of Scotland, while the cod would still taste good if it took a few days to reach its destination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/18/where-did-all-the-cod-go-fish-chips-north-sea-sustainable-stocks|title=Where did all the cod go? Fishing crisis in the North Sea|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=18 August 2019|accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref> Hake, pollock, whiting, and plaice are also seen at many chip shops.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/02/fish-chips-cod-food-standards|title=Cod and chips could be a load of pollock|last=Meikle|first=James|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 April 2013|accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref> In Scotland, 'special fish' is a variant where the haddock is breadcrumbed instead of battered.

A number of fish and chip shop condiments exist, including salt and vinegar (very often actually [[non-brewed condiment]]) across the UK, mushy peas and curry sauce in various parts of the UK, chip spice in Hull,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/hulls-famous-chip-spice-taking-483147|title=Hull's famous Chip Spice is taking over Yorkshire|last=Habergham|first=Harriet|newspaper=[[Hull Daily Mail]]|date=15 September 2017|accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref> chippy sauce in Edinburgh,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/shocking-secret-edinburghs-chippy-sauce-revealed-104357|title=Shocking secret of Edinburgh's chippy sauce revealed|last=Rudden|first=Liam|newspaper=[[Edinburgh Evening News]]|date=21 February 2019|accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref> gravy in Derby, mushy pea and mint sauce in Nottingham, and gravy and cheese in Yorkshire. There are also variations with the oil used to cook the fish and chips. Traditional frying uses beef [[dripping]] or lard, and are still used in the Midlands and the North; however, vegetable oils, such as palm oil, rapeseed or peanut oil (used because of its relatively high smoke point) now predominate, particularly in the South.

There are also a number of other offerings at fish and chip shops that do not involve fish, such as the [[battered sausage]].
