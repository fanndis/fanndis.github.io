The '''National Conversation''' was the name given to the [[Scottish Government]]'s [[public consultation]] exercise regarding possible future changes in the power of the [[devolution|devolved]] [[Scottish Parliament]] and the possibility of [[Scottish independence]], a policy objective of the [[Scottish National Party]], who at the time were the [[minority government]] with power over devolved affairs in [[Scotland]], as the [[Scottish Government]]. It culminated in a multi-option white paper for a proposed [[Referendum (Scotland) Bill, 2010]].

==Process==
The National Conversation was launched on 14 August 2007 by [[Alex Salmond]], the [[First Minister of Scotland]]. It consisted of a 59-page [[white paper]], titled [[Choosing Scotland's Future]], and a [[website]]. The white paper included a draft [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] for a [[referendum]] to allow for negotiations with the [[UK Government]] on Scottish independence. The website encourages comments to be made on the white paper. Comments are encouraged from members of the public, rather than just [[interest group]]s.

As a culmination to the National Conversation, a [[white paper]] for the proposed [[Referendum (Scotland) Bill, 2010]] was published on [[St. Andrew's Day]] on 30 November 2009.<ref name=Independent30Nov09SNPReveals>{{cite news

==Response==
On 6 December 2007, the [[Scottish Parliament]] voted to create a [[Commission on Scottish Devolution]], chaired by Sir [[Kenneth Calman]], and with the remit:

: To review the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998 in the light of experience and to recommend any changes to the present constitutional arrangements that would enable the Scottish Parliament to serve the people of Scotland better, improve the financial accountability of the Scottish Parliament, and continue to secure the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom.

The Commission was supported by the three main [[Unionism in Scotland|pro-Union]] political parties in Scotland: [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]], [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservatives]] and [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]]. Wendy Alexander, at the time leader of the Labour party in the Scottish Parliament, proposed the motion, rejecting the National Conversation and an amendment proposed by the [[Scottish National Party]] calling for support for the National Conversation was defeated, Ms Alexander associating it with moves towards [[Scottish independence]] and making the following response:

: The SNP amendment predictably calls for us to participate in the National Conversation, but how can the SNP possibly claim to be leading a conversation when it has already decided what the only acceptable outcome will be? Worst of all, it has no parliamentary mandate whatsoever for the conversation. How can the SNP possibly justify the use of taxpayers' money on something that is little more than propaganda?<ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness.aspx#Col4133 Parliamentary Business : Scottish Parliament<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Notably the remit of the Commission on Scottish Devolution precludes the consideration of Scottish independence.

The rejection of the National Conversation by the Scottish Parliament has led to criticisms as to its legitimacy.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/alancochrane/3554991/Alex-Salmonds-national-conversation.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Alex Salmond's national conversation | first=Alan | last=Cochrane | date=2008-02-14 | accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref> Concerns have also been raised by

===Website controversy===

On 24 April 2008, [[George Foulkes, Baron Foulkes of Cumnock|Lord Foulkes]], a Labour [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]], claimed that the National Conversation had been met with "complete indifference" by the people of Scotland, quoting website visiting figures. He further claimed that the website had become a meeting place for SNP activists, noting also that although 41 comments had been removed from the site, "there are still [[Anglophobia|anti-English]] remarks bordering on [[racism]]."<ref>[http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/snp-s-national-conversation-a-chatroom-for-cybernats-1-1165459 SNP's national conversation 'a chatroom for cybernats' - The Scotsman<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Influence ==

The initiative influenced the [[Parti Québécois]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and, in March 2008, shortly before the Parti Québécois National Council, leader [[Pauline Marois]] presented the party's plan to propose a ''conversation nationale'' to Quebecers as part of Marois' renewal of the party's approach on independence and [[social democracy]]. In this case, however, the conversation is to be solely on independence, instead of three options. The expression was met with less enthusiasm in [[Quebec]] and arose cynicism in the press and objection with some [[Pur et dur|party hardliners]].<ref>''[https://www.ledevoir.com/2008/03/25/181983.html Logique impériale]'' by François Brousseau, 25 March 2008, ''[[Le Devoir]]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413132628/http://www.ledevoir.com/2008/03/25/181983.html |date=13 April 2008 }}</ref> Shortly after, the Parti Québécois replaced the term with ''débat sur la souveraineté'' ("debate on [[sovereignty]]").
