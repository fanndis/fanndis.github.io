The '''president of the European Commission''' is the head of the [[European Commission]], the executive branch of the [[:European Union]]. The president of the Commission leads a cabinet of commissioners, referred to as the ''college'', collectively accountable to the [[European Parliament]]. The president is empowered to allocate portfolios amongst, reshuffle or dismiss commissioners as necessary. The college directs the Commission's civil service, sets the policy agenda and determines the legislative proposals it produces.
(The Commission is the only body that can propose{{efn|within the areas specified by the Treaties}} [[European Union law|EU laws]].)
{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} 

The president of the Commission also represents the EU abroad, together with the [[president of the European Council]] and the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]].

The post was established in 1958. Each new president is nominated by the [[European Council]] and formally elected by the European Parliament, for a five-year term.

In July 2019, the [[European Council]] nominated [[Ursula von der Leyen]] to succeed [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], and she was elected the 13th president of the European Commission by the [[European Parliament]] on 16 July.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-european-leaders-pick-germany-defense-minister-ursula-von-der-leyen-to-lead-commission-charles-michel-council/|title=EU leaders pick Germany's von der Leyen to lead Commission|last=Barigazzi|first=Jacopo|date=2 July 2019|work=POLITICO europe|access-date=2 July 2019|last2=Herszenhorn|first2=David M.|last3=Bayer|first3=Lili}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=MEPs elect first female EU Commission president |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49010801 |accessdate=17 July 2019 |publisher=BBC News |date=16 July 2019}}</ref> Von der Leyen assumed office on 1 December 2019, following the approval of her college of commissioners by the European Parliament.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Herszenhorn |first1=David M. |last2=de la Baume |first2=Maïa |title=Von der Leyen's in – now the hard work begins |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliament-confirms-von-der-leyen-commission/ |accessdate=1 December 2019 |work=Politico |date=27 November 2019}}</ref>

===Establishment===
The present Commission was established by the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957; it also replaced the High Authority and the Commission of [[Euratom]] in 1967.<ref name="ENA commission history">{{Cite web|title=European Commission|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/european_commission-en-281a3c0c-839a-48fd-b69c-bc2588c780ec.html|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref> The Commission's first president was [[Walter Hallstein]] (see [[Hallstein Commission]]) who started consolidating [[Law of the European Union|European law]] and began to impact on national legislation. National governments at first took little heed of his administration, with the president having to stamp the Commission's authority early on. With the aid of the [[European Court of Justice]], the Commission began to be taken more seriously.{{sfn|Eppink|2007|pp=221–222}}

In 1965, Hallstein put forward his proposals for the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which would give the Community its own financial resources while giving more power to the Commission and Parliament and removing the veto power over Agriculture in the Council. These proposals led to an immediate backlash from France.<ref name="ENA Chair">{{Cite web|publisher=CVCE|title=The 'empty chair' policy|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_empty_chair_policy-en-f6d19361-9a7a-4e39-ae93-0f898e652d85.html|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref> Hallstein knew the proposals would be contentious, and took personal charge of drafting them, over-riding the [[European Commissioner for Agriculture|Agriculture Commissioner]]. However he did gain the support of Parliament through his proposals to increase its powers, and he also presented his policy to Parliament a week before he submitted them to the Council. He aimed to demonstrate how he thought the Community ought to be run, in the hopes of generating a wave of pro-Europeanism big enough to get past the objections of member states. However, in this it proved that, despite its past successes, Hallstein was overconfident in his risky proposals.<ref name="LSE Chair">{{Cite web|last=Ludlow|first=N|year=2006|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|title=De-commissioning the Empty Chair Crisis: the Community institutions and the crisis of 1965–6|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2422/01/Decommisioningempty.pdf|accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025203706/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2422/01/Decommisioningempty.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 25 October 2007}}</ref>

[[File:Sicco Mansholt 1946.jpg|thumb|[[President Mansholt]] opened the first enlargement talks with Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom]]

In reaction to Hallstein's proposals and actions, then-French president [[Charles de Gaulle]], who was sceptical of the rising supranational power of the Commission, accused Hallstein of acting as if he were a [[head of state]]. France eventually withdrew its representative from the Council, triggering the notorious "empty chair crisis".<ref name="ENA Chair"/> Although this was resolved under the "[[Luxembourg compromise]]", Hallstein became the scapegoat for the crisis. The Council refused to renew his term, despite his being the most 'dynamic' leader until [[Jacques Delors]].<ref name="LSE Chair"/>

===1967–1985===
Hallstein's work did position the Commission as a substantial power. The presidents were involved in the major political projects of the day in the 1970s, such as the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|European Monetary Union]].{{sfn|Eppink|2007|p=222}} In 1970, President [[Jean Rey (politician)|Jean Rey]] secured the Community's own financial resources,<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |title=The Rey Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/history/rey/index_en.htm |accessdate=10 February 2008}}</ref> and in 1977, President [[Roy Jenkins]] became the first Commission president to attend a [[G8|G7]] summit on behalf of the Community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deljpn.ec.europa.eu/union/showpage_en_union.external.g8.php |title=EU and the G8 |accessdate=25 September 2007 |publisher=European Commission |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226165606/http://www.deljpn.ec.europa.eu/union/showpage_en_union.external.g8.php |archivedate=26 February 2007 }}</ref>

However, owing to problems such as the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the [[1979 energy crisis]], economic hardship reduced the priority of European integration, with only the president trying to keep the idea alive. The member states had the upper hand, and they created the [[European Council]] to discuss topical problems, yet the Council was unable to keep the major projects on track such as the [[Common Agricultural Policy]].{{sfn|Eppink|2007|pp=222–223}} The Community entered a period of [[eurosclerosis]], owing to economic difficulties and disagreements on the [[Budget of the European Union|Community budget]], and by the time of the [[Thorn Commission]] the president was unable to exert his influence to any significant extent.{{sfn|Eppink|2007|p=24}}

===Presidentialism===
[[File:Jacques Delors, Kurt Furgler, Gaston Thorn, World Economic Forum 1986.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques Delors]] (left) breathed new life into the European Commission Presidency after a period of 'eurosclerosis' under his predecessor, [[Gaston Thorn]] (right)]]
However, the Commission began to recover under President [[Jacques Delors]]' [[Delors Commission|Commission]]. He is seen as the most successful president, being credited with having given the Community a sense of direction and dynamism.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Burson-Marsteller]] |title=The new Commission&nbsp;– some initial thoughts |year=2004|url=http://www.bmbrussels.be/box_bmnewcomm.php |accessdate=17 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925173727/http://www.bmbrussels.be/box_bmnewcomm.php<!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=25 September 2007}}</ref> The ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' noted the work of Delors at the end of his second term in 1992: "Mr. Delors rescued the European Community from the doldrums. He arrived when Europessimism was at its worst. Although he was a little-known (outside France) finance minister and former MEP, he breathed life and hope into the EC and into the dispirited Brussels Commission. In his first term, from 1985 to 1988, he rallied Europe to the call of the single market, and when appointed to a second term he began urging Europeans toward the far more ambitious goals of economic, monetary and political union."<ref name="IHT Delors quote">{{cite web |last=Merritt |first=Giles |title=A Bit More Delors Could Revamp the Commission |work=International Herald Tribune |date=21 January 1992 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1992/01/21/edgi_0.php |accessdate=17 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121053056/http://www.iht.com/articles/1992/01/21/edgi_0.php<!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=21 January 2008}}</ref>

But Delors not only turned the Community around, he signalled a change in the Presidency. Before he came to power, the Commission president still was a position of [[first among equals]]; when he left office, he was the undisputed icon and leader of the Community. His tenure had produced a strong Presidency and a strong Commission as the president became more important. Following treaties cemented this change, with the president being given control over the allocation of portfolios and being able to force the resignation of Commissioners. When President [[Romano Prodi]] took office with the new powers of the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], he was dubbed by the press as Europe's first Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web |last=James |first=Barry |title=Prodi to Have Wide, New Powers as Head of the European Commission |work=International Herald Tribune |date=16 April 1999 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1999/04/16/eu.2.t_0.php |accessdate=17 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017203411/http://iht.com/articles/1999/04/16/eu.2.t_0.php<!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=17 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Rossant |first=John |title=Commentary: Romano Prodi: Europe's First Prime Minister?

However, later Commissions did not enjoy the same support, and in 1999, the European Parliament used its powers to force the [[Santer Commission]] to resign.{{sfn|Eppink|2007|p=228}}

===Parliamentary oversight===
[[File:Vladimir Putin with Romano Prodi-1.jpg|thumb|[[President Prodi]] was dubbed by the press as "Europe's first Prime Minister" due to his new powers]]
Historically, the Council appointed the Commission president and the whole body by unanimity without input from Parliament. However, with the [[Treaty on European Union]] in 1993, the European Parliament, the body elected directly by the citizens of the European Union,<ref name="ENA Parliament">{{cite web |title=European Parliament |publisher=[[European NAvigator]] |url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/european_parliament-en-ad6a0d57-08ef-427d-a715-f6e3bfaf775a.html |accessdate=5 August 2017}}</ref> gained the right to be consulted on the appointment of the president and to veto the Commission as a whole. Parliament decided to interpret its right to be consulted as a right to veto the president, which the Council reluctantly accepted.{{sfn|Hix|2008|pp=37–38}} This right of veto was formalised in the [[Amsterdam Treaty]]. The [[Treaty of Nice]] changed the Council's vote from a unanimous choice to one that merely needed a [[Voting in the Council of the European Union|qualified majority]]. This meant that the weight of the Parliament in the process increased resulting in a quasi-[[parliamentary system]] where one group could be in government. This became evident when numerous candidates were put forward in 2004, and a centre-right vote won out over left-wing groups, France and Germany.{{sfn|Hix|2008|p=38}} [[José Manuel Barroso]], elected Commission president that year, was then forced to back down over his choice of Commissioners, owing to Parliament's threat that it would not approve his Commission.{{sfn|Hix|2008|p=39}}

In 2009, the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) endorsed Barroso as its candidate for Commission president, and the EPP subsequently retained its position as largest party in that year's election. The Socialists responded by pledging to put forward a rival candidate at future elections.<ref name="PES candidate 09"/> Once again, Barroso was forced by Parliament to make a change to his proposed Commission,<ref>Mahony, Honor (19 January 2009). "[http://euobserver.com/9/29296 EU commission vote delayed as Bulgarian nominee steps down]", ''EU Observer''</ref> but eventually received assent. However, in exchange for approval, Parliament forced some concessions from Barroso in terms of Parliamentary representation at Commission and international meetings.<ref name="B2A">{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Simon |title =MEPs agree working relations with Barroso |work=[[European Voice]] |date=28 January 2010 |url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/meps-agree-working-relations-with-barroso/66982.aspx |accessdate =28 June 2007}}</ref> On 7 September 2010, Barroso gave the first US-style [[State of the Union (European Union)|State of the Union address]] to Parliament, which focused primarily on the EU's economic recovery and human rights. The speech was to be annual.<ref>Rettman, Andrew (7 September 2010). "[http://euobserver.com/9/30747 EU has survived economic crisis, Barroso says in first State of Union address]", ''EU Observer''</ref>

==Appointment==
[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - EPP Congress Warsaw (290).jpg|thumb|[[President Barroso]], from the [[European People's Party|EPP]] which was the largest party after the 2004 and 2009 elections]]
Article 17 of the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty on European Union]], as amended by the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], lays out the procedure for appointing the president and their team. The [[European Council]] votes by [[qualified majority]] for a nominee for the post of President, [[#Spitzenkandidat|taking account]] of the latest [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]]. This proposal is then put before Parliament which must approve or veto the appointment. If an absolute majority of MEPs support the nominee, they are elected. The president then, together with the Council, puts forward their team to the Parliament to be scrutinised. The Parliament normally insists that each one of them appear before the parliamentary committee that corresponds to their prospective portfolio for a public hearing. The Parliament then votes on the Commission as a whole; if approved, the European Council, acting by a qualified majority, appoints the president and their team to office.<ref>Article 17 of the [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0013:0045:EN:PDF Treaty on European Union (Lisbon amended)], (PDF) Eur-Lex</ref>

===Transparency===
Qualified majority in the Council has led to more candidates being fielded while there has been greater politicisation due to the involvement of Parliament and the change of policy direction in the EU from the creation of the [[single market]] to reform of it.{{sfn|Hix|2008|p=157}} However, despite this, the choice within the Council remains largely behind closed doors. During the appointment of Santer, discussions were kept ''[[in camera]]'' (private), with the media relying on insider leaks. MEPs were angry with the process, against the spirit of consultation that the new EU treaty brought in. [[Pauline Green]] MEP, leader of the [[Party of European Socialists|Socialist group]], stated that her group thought "Parliament should refuse to condone a practice which so sullies the democratic process".{{sfn|Hix|2008|p=158}} There were similar deals in 1999 and 2004 saw a repeat of Santer's appointment when Barroso was appointed through a series of secret meetings between leaders with no press releases on the negotiations being released.{{sfn|Hix|2008|p=159}} This was sharply criticised by MEPs such as the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group|ALDE group]] leader [[Graham Watson]] who described the procedure as a "[[Justus Lipsius building|Justus Lipsius]] carpet market" producing only the "lowest common denominator"; while [[The Greens–European Free Alliance|Green-EFA]] co-leader [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] asked Barroso after his first speech "If you are the best candidate, why were you not the first?"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cohn-Bendit|first=Daniel|title=Nomination of Commission President handled 'in a most unsatisfactory way'|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|year=2004|url=http://www.grahamwatsonmep.org/news/000025.html|accessdate=1 July 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829045302/http://www.grahamwatsonmep.org/news/000025.html|archivedate=29 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Watson|first=Graham|title=Statement by the President-designate of the Commission|publisher=Graham Watson MEP website|date=21 July 2004|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+CRE+20040721+ITEM-006+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN|accessdate=1 July 2007}}</ref>

The candidate selected by the Council has often been a leading national politician, but this is not a requirement. The choice of President must take into account the result of the latest [[Elections in the European Union|Parliamentary elections]] (for example, by choosing the candidate supported by the largest [[European political party]] in particular, or at least someone from that political family{{snd}} the [[#Spitzenkandidat|''Spitzenkandidat'']] principle, below{{snd}} but this is a convention not an obligation).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/05/30/the-race-for-the-eus-big-jobs-gets-under-way |title=The race for the EU's big jobs gets under way |work=[[The Economist]] |date=30 May 2019 |accessdate=8 June 2019}}</ref> That provision was not in force in the nomination in 2004, but the centre-right EPP, which won the election, pressured for a candidate from its own ranks. In the end, the EPP candidate, José Manuel Barroso, was chosen.<ref>{{cite web |title=Barroso Appointed EU Commission President |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=30 June 2004 |url=http://www.dw.de/barroso-appointed-eu-commission-president/a-1250649 |accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref> On the same basis, the EPP endorsed again Barroso for a second term during the 2009 European election campaign and, being largest again after that election, was able to secure his nomination by the [[European Council]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Further criteria seen to be influencing the choice of the Council include: which area of Europe the candidate comes from, favoured as Southern Europe in 2004; the candidate's political influence, credible yet not overpowering members; language, proficiency in French considered necessary by France; and degree of integration, their state being a member of both the [[eurozone]] and the [[Schengen Agreement]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fuller |first=Thimas |title=Portuguese premier wants to unite bloc : Barroso nominated to head EU executive |work=International Herald Tribune |date=30 June 2004 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/06/30/eu_ed3__5.php |accessdate=1 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20110604225815/http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/06/30/eu_ed3__5.php |archivedate=4 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Stuart |first=Paul |title=Portugal's Prime Minister Barroso nominated as European Commission president |publisher=World Socialist Web Site |date=21 July 2004 |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/jul2004/port-j21.shtml |accessdate=1 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606130922/http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/jul2004/port-j21.shtml|archivedate=6 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=José Manuel Durão Barroso: The New Commission President |publisher=Grayling |year=2004 |url=http://www.graylingbrussels.com/Vote4CommissionPresident/index.php?page=barossoprofile |accessdate=1 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929043354/http://www.graylingbrussels.com/Vote4CommissionPresident/index.php?page=barossoprofile |archivedate=29 September 2007}}</ref>

There has been an assumption{{by whom|date=June 2019}} that there is a rolling agreement along these lines,{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}<!-- Please do not delete as this is probably cited in Hix (2008), but it is not certain. --> that a president from a large state is followed by a president from a small state, and one from the political left will be followed by one from the political right: Roy Jenkins (British socialist) was followed by Gaston Thorn (Luxembourgish liberal), Jacques Delors (French socialist), Jacques Santer (Luxembourgish Christian democrat), Romano Prodi (Italian left-wing Christian democrat) and Jose Barroso (Portuguese Christian democrat). However, despite these assumptions, these presidents have usually been chosen during political battles and coalition-building. Delors was chosen following a Franco-British disagreement over [[Claude Cheysson]], Santer was a compromise after Britain vetoed [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]], and Prodi was backed by a coalition of thirteen states against the Franco-German preference for [[Guy Verhofstadt]].{{sfn|Hix|2008|p=156}}

===Elections===
In February 2008, President Barroso admitted that despite the president having in theory as much [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]] as heads of governments, in practice it was not the case. The low [[voter turnout]] creates a problem for the president's legitimacy, with the lack of a "European political sphere", but analysts claim that if citizens were voting for a list of candidates for the post of President, turn out would be much higher than that seen in recent years.<ref name="Barroso Legitimacy">{{Cite web|last=Mahony|first=Honor|title=Barroso admits legitimacy problem for commission president post|publisher=EU Observer|url=http://euobserver.com/9/25740|date=28 February 2008|accessdate=29 February 2008 }}</ref>

Under the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] the [[European Council]] has to take into account the results of the latest European elections and, furthermore, the Parliament elects, rather than simply approve, the Council's proposed candidate.

[[File:Laophorium Ioannis Claudii Juncker anno 2014.jpg|thumb|270px|For the first time, prior to the 2014 election presidential candidates were nominated. This enabled them to present election programmes and campaign for the position (the campaign bus of [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] depicted).]]

The {{lang|de|Spitzenkandidat}} (German for 'lead candidate') process is the method of linking European Parliament elections by having each major political group in Parliament nominating their candidate for Commission President prior to the Parliamentary elections. The {{lang|de|Spitzenkandidat}} of the largest party would then have a mandate to assume the Commission Presidency. This process was first run in 2014, and its legitimacy was contested by the Council.

====Background====
According to the treaties, the president of the European Commission is nominated by the European Council. Until 2004, this nomination was based on an informal consensus for a common candidate. However, in 2004 the centre-right EPP rejected the consensus approach ahead of the [[European Council]] meeting, and pushed through its own candidate, [[José Manuel Barroso|Barroso]].<ref name="ECFR 2014">{{cite web |accessdate=8 August 2014 |url=http://www.ecfr.eu/content/entry/commentary_five_lessons_from_the_spitzenkandidaten_european_parliament_c281 |title=Five lessons from the "Spitzenkandidaten" European Parliament campaign |first=Josef |last=Janning |date=1 July 2014 |publisher=[[European Council on Foreign Relations]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809192020/http://www.ecfr.eu/content/entry/commentary_five_lessons_from_the_spitzenkandidaten_european_parliament_c281 |archivedate=9 August 2014}}</ref> The approach of national governments was to appoint the various high-profile jobs in EU institutions (European Council president, High Representative and so on) dividing them according along geographic, political and gender lines. This also led to fairly low-profile figures in some cases, for it avoided candidates who had either made enemies of some national governments or who were seen as potentially challenging the Council or certain member states.<ref name="die">{{cite news |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-commission-top-job-jean-claude-juncker-time-for-the-spitzenkandidat-to-die/ |title=Time for the Spitzenkandidat to die |work=[[Politico Europe|Politico]] |date=11 July 2017}}</ref>

====Article 17.7====
Unease had built up around the secretive power play that was involved in these appointments, leading to a desire for a more democratic process.<ref name="die"/> At the end of 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force. It amended the appointment of the Commission President in the [[Treaty on European Union]] Article 17.7 to add the wording "taking into account the elections to the European Parliament", so that Article 17.7 now included the wording {{Quote|text=Taking into account the elections to the European Parliament and after having held the appropriate consultations, the European Council, acting by a qualified majority, shall propose to the European Parliament a candidate for President of the Commission.}}

====2014 election====
In 2013, in preparation for the [[2014 European Parliament election|European election of 2014]], [[Martin Schulz]], then [[President of the European Parliament]] campaigned for [[European political party|European political parties]] to name lead candidates for the post of President of the European Commission; his own party group, the centre-left [[Party of European Socialists]] named Schulz as its lead candidate ({{lang-de|link=no|Spitzenkandidat}}). The EPP held an election Congress in Dublin, where [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] beat his rival [[Michel Barnier]] and subsequently ran as the EPP's lead candidate.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://juncker.epp.eu |title=Jean-Claude Juncker: Experience. Solidarity. Future. |publisher=European People's Party}}</ref> The [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]] and the [[European Green Party]] also selected lead candidates. The [[Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists]] did not name a candidate, objecting to the principle of {{lang|de|Spitzenkandidaten}} and its "tenuous" basis in law.<ref>{{cite news |accessdate=8 August 2014 |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140630STO51009/html/Syed-Kamall-new-leader-of-European-Conservatives-and-Reformists |title=Syed Kamall: new leader of European Conservatives and Reformists |date=30 June 2014 |publisher=[[European Parliament]]}}</ref> The German term for lead candidates caught on, and they became known informally as {{lang|de|Spitzenkandidaten}}.

The EPP won a plurality (29%) in the 2014 election, and Jean-Claude Juncker, its lead candidate, was nominated by the European Council. British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] were the only members of the council to object to his selection.<ref>{{cite news |accessdate=1 April 2016|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-28049375 |title= EU backs Juncker to head Commission in blow to UK |publisher=BBC News|date=27 June 2014}}</ref>

====Criticism====
Some commentators argued that this amendment did not entitle the political parties of the Parliament to nominate candidates for the president of the Commission, and that such an interpretation would amount to a "power grab" at the expense of the European Council.<ref>{{Cite news|accessdate=8 August 2014|url=http://www.ceps.be/book/never-mind-spitzenkandidaten-it%E2%80%99s-all-about-politics|title=Never mind the Spitzenkandidaten: It's all about politics|first=Marco|last=Incerti|date=6 June 2014|series=CEPS Commentaries|publisher=[[Centre for European Policy Studies]]|quote=the result of a sneaky manoeuvre on the part of the European Parliament, which is ever eager to grab powers from the Heads of State and Government|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808175652/http://www.ceps.be/book/never-mind-spitzenkandidaten-it%E2%80%99s-all-about-politics|archive-date=8 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Council found itself taken off guard by how the process took off, and had backed themselves into a corner in having to approve the Parliament's candidate.

On the other hand, it has also been argued that it is still insufficiently democratic and needs to be replaced with a more direct system.<ref name="die"/> Some suggestions toward this have been electing the president via a transnational list, having a direct election,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euvisions.eu/why-and-how-the-spitzenkandidaten-procedure-should-be-further-developed/ |title=Why and How the Spitzenkandidaten Procedure Should be Further Developed |author=Johannes Müller Gómez |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927114438/http://www.euvisions.eu/why-and-how-the-spitzenkandidaten-procedure-should-be-further-developed/ |archive-date=27 September 2018 |website=EUvisions |date=9 June 2016}}</ref> and holding [[primary election]]s.<ref>[https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-needs-us-style-primaries-spitzenkandidaten/ Why Europe needs US-style primaries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102013003/https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-needs-us-style-primaries-spitzenkandidaten/ |date=2 January 2018 }}, Politico 20 December 2017</ref> Parliamentary proposals to enact some of these in advance of the [[2019 European Parliament election|2019 election]] have been opposed by some in the Council.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sven-giegold.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/COM-President-non-paper.pdf |title=Presidency non-paper |date=20 April 2016 |website=Sven Giegold |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190817121256/http://www.sven-giegold.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/COM-President-non-paper.pdf |archive-date=17 August 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=1 January 2018 }}</ref>

==Term of office==
The president is elected for a renewable five-year term starting five months after the [[Elections in the European Union|elections to the]] [[European Parliament]]. These were brought into alignment via the [[Maastricht Treaty]] (prior to which the Commission had a four-year term of office) and the elections take place in June every five years (in years ending in 4 and 9).<ref name="Pres R&P">{{Cite web|title=Role and Powers|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/personal/role/index_en.htm|accessdate=10 January 2008 }}</ref> This alignment has led to a closer relationship between the elections and the president themself with the above-mentioned proposals for political parties running with candidates.

The president and their Commission may be removed from office by a [[Motion of censure|vote of censure]] from Parliament. Parliament has never done this to date, however the imminence of such a vote in 1999, due to allegations of financial mismanagement, led to the [[Santer Commission]] resigning on its own accord, before the Parliamentary vote.<ref name="EV">{{Cite web |last=Harding |first=Gareth |title=Unfolding drama of the Commission's demise |date=18 March 1999 |publisher=[[European Voice]] |url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/archive/article.asp?id=8627 |accessdate=7 October 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Duties and powers==
{{Politics of the European Union}}
The president of the European Commission is the most powerful position in the European Union,{{sfn|Hix|2008|p=155}} controlling the Commission which collectively has the [[right of initiative (legislative)|right of initiative]] on [[Law of the European Union|Union legislation]] (only on matters delegated to it by member states for collective action, as determined by the treaties) and is responsible for ensuring its enforcement.{{sfn|Hix|2008|p=155}}<ref name="Europa Institutions">{{Cite web|title=Institutions of the EU: The European Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm|accessdate=18 June 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623104055/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm|archivedate=23 June 2007}}</ref> The president controls the policy agenda of the Commission for their term and in practice no policy can be proposed without the president's agreement.{{sfn|Hix|2008|p=155}}

The role of the president is to lead the Commission, and give direction to the Commission and the Union as a whole. The treaties state that "the Commission shall work under the political guidance of its president" (Article 219 [[Treaty of Rome|TEC]]), this is conducted through their calling and chairing of meetings of the college of Commissioners,<ref name="Pres R&P"/> their [[Cabinet (European Commission)|personal cabinet]] and the meetings of the heads of each commissioner's cabinet (the Hebdo). {{sfn|Hix|2008|p=155}}<ref name="Pres R&P"/> The president may also force a Commissioner to resign.<ref name="Pres R&P"/> The work of the Commission as a body is based on the principle of [[Cabinet collective responsibility]], however in their powers they act as more than a [[Primus inter pares|first among equals]].<ref name="Pres R&P"/> The role of the president is similar to that of a national Prime Minister chairing a cabinet.{{sfn|Hix|2008|p=155}}

The president also has responsibility for representing the Commission in the Union and beyond. For example, they are a member of the [[European Council]] and takes part in debates in Parliament and the Council of Ministers. Outside the Union they attend the meetings of the [[G8]] to represent the Union.<ref name="Pres R&P"/> However, in foreign affairs, the president does have to compete with several Commissioners with foreign affairs related portfolios: the [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]] and the [[president of the European Council]].{{sfn|Eppink|2007|pp=232–3}}

The presidential system had started to develop since [[Jacques Delors]] and has since been cemented. However, externally they are still dependent on support from the Council and Parliament. Delors had enjoyed the Parliament's and the Council's support for his whole term, during which, through treaty changes, the Parliament increased in powers and, through the accession of new Member States, the Council increased in membership. The membership is now so large the president is increasingly unable to garner the support of all the states, even though the job is supposed to try to keep everyone happy. The Parliament now has more powers over the Commission and can reject its proposals, although the Commission has little power over Parliament, such as the ability to dissolve it to call new elections.{{sfn|Eppink|2007|pp=226–8}}

The president's office is on the top, 13th, floor of the [[Berlaymont building]] in Brussels. The president receives their political guidance from their [[Cabinet (European Commission)|cabinet]], the head of which acts as a political bodyguard for the president. Such factors can lead to an isolation of the president from outside events.{{sfn|Eppink|2007|pp=211–3}} For the [[European Civil Service]] the president has a very high status, due to their immense authority and symbolism within the body.{{sfn|Eppink|2007|p=211}} The president exercises further authority through the [[Directorate-General for Legal Service (European Commission)|legal service]] and [[Secretariat-General of the European Commission|Secretariat-General of the Commission]]. The former has the power to strike down proposals on legal technicalities while the latter organises meetings, [[Agenda (meeting)|agendas]] and minutes. The president's control over these areas gives them further political tools when directing the work of the Commission. This has also increased the presidential style of the Commission president.{{sfn|Eppink|2007|pp=217–21}}

With the reorganisation of leading EU posts under the [[Lisbon Treaty]], there was some criticism of each post's vague responsibilities. Ukrainian ambassador to the EU Andriy Veselovsky praised the framework and clarified it in his own terms: The Commission president speaks as the EU's "government" while the [[president of the European Council]] is a "strategist". The High Representative specialises in "bilateral relations" while the [[European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy]] deals in technical matters such as the free trade agreement with Ukraine. The [[president of the European Parliament]] meanwhile articulates the EU's values.<ref name="Ukr">Rettman, Andrew (15 March 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/29680 Ukraine gives positive appraisal of new-model EU], EU Observer</ref>

The MEP and author of several EU text books [[Richard Corbett]] has suggested that, instead of every EU institution having a "president", it would have been clearer if they had been named differently, with a "Speaker" of the Parliament, a "Governor" of the Central Bank, a "Chairman" of the (ordinary) Council of Ministers, a "president" of the European Council, and a "Prime Commissioner".

===Relationship to the President of the European Council===
[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - EPP Summit March 2010 (31).jpg|thumb|Having both a Commission president (Barroso, left) and a European Council president (Van Rompuy, right) led to concerns over confusion and infighting]]
Despite the recent presidential style, the president has also begun to lose ground to the larger member states as countries such as France, Italy, the UK and Germany seek to sideline its role. This may increase with the recent creation of the permanent [[president of the European Council]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Iey Berry |first=Peter Sain |publisher=EU Observer|title=[Comment] Power is, according to some observers, slipping from the Commission to the European Council |date=18 January 2008|url=http://euobserver.com/9/25484 |accessdate=18 January 2008}}</ref> There has been disagreement and concern over competition between the president of the European Council Van Rompuy and the Commission president Barroso due to the vague language of the treaty. Some clarifications see Van Rompuy as the "strategist" and Barroso as a [[head of government]]. In terms of economic planning Van Rompuy saw the Commission as dealing with the content of the plan and the European Council as dealing with the means and implementing it. Despite weekly breakfasts together there was a certain extent of rivalry between the two, as well as with the High Representative.<ref name="Ukr"/><ref name="Duff VR">[[Andrew Duff|Duff, Andrew]] (23 February 2010) [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/913633f6-1f90-11df-8975-00144feab49a.html Who is Herman Van Rompuy?]</ref><ref name="VanB">{{Cite web|publisher=[[EU Observer]]|title=A Van Barroso?|url=http://blogs.euobserver.com/mahony/2010/04/15/a-van-barroso/|date=15 April 2010|accessdate=16 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417113809/http://blogs.euobserver.com/mahony/2010/04/15/a-van-barroso/|archivedate=17 April 2010}}</ref> At international summits, both presidents go at the same time to represent the Union, with, in principle, the Commission president speaking on economic questions and the European Council president on political questions, although this division is often hard to maintain in practice.

Although there are concerns that this competition with the new European Council president would lead to increased infighting,<ref name="FG Plan">{{Cite web|last=Hix|first=Simon|last2=Roland|first2=Gérard|publisher=[[Foreign Policy Centre]]|title=Why the Franco-German Plan would institutionalise 'cohabitation' for Europe|url=http://fpc.org.uk/articles/201|accessdate=1 October 2007 }}</ref> there are provisions for combining the two offices. The European Council president may not hold a national office, such as a Prime Minister of a member state, but there is no such restraint on European offices. So the Commission president, who already sits in the European Council, could also be appointed as its president. This would allow the European Council to combine the position, with its powers, of both executive bodies into a single [[president of the European Union]].<ref name="Constitution">{{Cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|title=SCADPlus: The Institutions of the Union: European Council|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/europeancouncil_en.htm|accessdate=27 June 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221041824/http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/europeancouncil_en.htm|archivedate=21 December 2009}}</ref>

==List of presidents==
{{see also|High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community#President|European Atomic Energy Community#Presidents of the EAEC}}
{{Structural evolution of the European Commission}}
The European Economic Community was established by the [[Treaty of Rome]], presently known as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; a founding treaty of the union, which explains that the enumeration of presidents which ends with the present position starts with the first president of the Commission of the European Economic Community. The European Union is also the legal successor of the European Economic Community, or the European Community as it was named between 1993 and 2009. The establishment of the [[European Union]] in 1993 upon the entry into force of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] (formally the Treaty on European Union) did not affect the name of the position.

Upon its entry into force in 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] renamed the Commission of the European Communities the European Commission, reflecting the ''de facto'' name as well as the fact that the [[European Communities]] [[Three pillars of the European Union|pillar]] was abolished along with the rest of the pillar system.
