The complex of buildings is located next to the [[Karura Forest]] in the [[Gigiri]] district of Nairobi, along United Nations Avenue. It stands across the street from the [[Embassy of the United States, Nairobi|US Embassy in Kenya]].

The UN complex contains a [[zero energy building|'green' building]], a completely [[energy neutral design|energy]] and [[carbon-neutral]] building, housing UNEP and UN-Habitat offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greeningtheblue.org/news/new-un-office-nairobi-showcase-sustainability |title=New UN office in Nairobi is a showcase for sustainability |publisher=Greening the Blue }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=www.standardmedia.co.ke |url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/InsidePage.php?id=%202000032357&cid=4&story=New%20benchmark%20as%20UN%20opens%20green%20building%20in%20Nairobi |title=Standard Digital News : : Business – New benchmark as UN opens green building in Nairobi |publisher=Standardmedia.co.ke |date=1 April 2011 |access-date=19 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104204113/http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/InsidePage.php?id=%202000032357&cid=4&story=New%20benchmark%20as%20UN%20opens%20green%20building%20in%20Nairobi |archive-date=4 January 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The building is the first of its kind in Africa, recycling water and using natural light to reduce reliance on artificial lighting. In addition, the building is designed to use natural flow of air as a substitute to air conditioning, and it contains solar panels to generate all the energy that the building might consume.<ref>{{cite web|last=Recio |first=Eugenia |url=http://climate-l.iisd.org/news/unep-showcases-new-green-buildings-in-nairobi/ |title=UNEP Showcases New Green Buildings in Nairobi – Climate Change Policy & Practice |publisher=Climate-l.iisd.org |date=7 March 2011}}</ref> It was opened on 31 March 2011 by [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] and Kenyan President [[Mwai Kibaki]].<ref>{{cite news |title=New energy-efficient UN offices in Kenya serve as model for future – Ban |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2011/03/370882 |publisher=UN News |date=31 March 2011}}</ref>
