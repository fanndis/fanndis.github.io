Along with the central package delivery operation, the UPS brand name (in a fashion similar to that of competitor [[FedEx]]) is used to denote many of its divisions and subsidiaries, including its cargo airline ([[UPS Airlines]]), freight-based trucking operation ([[UPS Freight]], formerly Overnite Transportation), and its delivery drone airline ([[UPS Flight Forward]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=UPS starts Distributing its Delivery Packages with Drones|url=https://www-upsers.com/ups-starts-using-drones/|website=UPSers|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=UPS Employee Programs|url=https://www.upsers.online/benefits/|website=UPSers.online|accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref> The global logistics company is headquartered in the U.S. city of [[Sandy Springs, Georgia]], which is a part of the [[Greater Atlanta|Greater Atlanta metropolitan area]].

==History==
===Foundation===
[[Image:MPD1916UPS.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Merchants Parcel Delivery delivery vehicles in 1916]]
On August 28, 1907, [[James E. Casey|James Casey]] founded the '''American Messenger Company''' with Claude Ryan<ref name="cnn">{{Cite news|author=Paul Lukas Reporting by Maggie Overfelt |url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2003/04/01/341024/index.htm |publisher=CNN | title=UPS United Parcel Service James Casey like pie.| date=April 1, 2003 |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}</ref> in [[Seattle]], Washington,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ups.com/content/cn/en/about/history/1929.html|title=UPS: 1907–1929|work=ups.com |accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref> capitalized with $100 in debt.<ref name="HistoryLink">{{cite web |last=Warren |first=James R. |date=September 20, 1999 |title=United Parcel Service (UPS) |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=1679 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=February 21, 2016}}</ref> Most deliveries at this time were made on foot and bicycles were used for longer trips.

The American Messenger Company focused primarily on package delivery to retail stores with special delivery mail delivered for its largest client the [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. Post Office]]. In 1913, the company acquired a [[Model T Ford]] as its first delivery vehicle. Casey and Ryan merged with a competitor, Evert McCabe, and formed '''Merchants Parcel Delivery'''. Consolidated delivery was also introduced, combining packages addressed to a certain neighborhood onto one delivery vehicle.<ref name="HistoryLink"/> In 1916, Charlie Soderstrom joined Merchants Parcel Delivery bringing in more vehicles for the growing delivery business. In 1919, the company expanded for the first time outside of Seattle to [[Oakland, California]], and changed its name to United Parcel Service. The name change to United Parcel Service was to remind the company that expansion operations were still ''United'' under the same organization and ''Parcel'' identified the type of business offered as part of its ''Service''. [[Common carrier]] service was acquired in 1922 from a company in [[Los Angeles, California]]. UPS became one of the only companies in the United States to offer common carrier service. At first common carrier was only limited to a small area around Los Angeles but by 1927 expanded to areas up to 125 miles outside the city. In 1924, a conveyor belt system was debuted for the handling of packages for UPS operations.<ref>{{cite web|title=1907–1929|url=https://www.ups.com/content/cn/en/about/history/1929.html|website=ups.com|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref>

In 1930, a consolidated service began in New York City, and soon after in other major cities in the [[Eastern United States|East]] and the [[Midwest]].<ref name="UPS"/> The use of common carrier for delivery between all customers placed UPS in direct competition with USPS and the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]. The common carrier service was applied in cities where UPS could use the service without the authority of the ICC and state commerce commissions. The first city for UPS to use common carrier status outside California was [[Chicago, Illinois]], in 1953.<ref>{{cite web|title=Company History 1930–1980|url=https://www.ups.com/content/aw/en/about/history/1980.html|website=UPS|accessdate=July 4, 2017}}</ref>

[[Image:UPSModelT1921.jpg|thumb|right|330px|[[Ford Model T]] UPS delivery vehicle in 1921]]
Air service through UPS was first used in 1929 through private airlines. However, [[The Great Depression]] and a lack of volume ended the air service. In 1953, UPS resumed air service called UPS Blue Label Air with two-day service to major cities along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Air Service|url=https://www.ups.com/content/cn/en/about/history/1980.html|website=UPS.com|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref>

===Expansion and diversification===
In 1975, UPS moved its headquarters to [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], and began serving all of the 48 [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] of the United States. The expanded operations made UPS the first package delivery company to serve every address in the contiguous United States. UPS went international in 1975 establishing operations in [[Canada]] and in 1976 operations were established in [[Germany]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=United Parcel Service {{!}} History & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-Parcel-Service|access-date=2020-11-27|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>. On February 28, UPS Ltd. (later changed to UPS Canada Ltd.) began operations in Toronto, [[Ontario]]. UPS Canada's head office is located in [[Burlington, Ontario]]. In 1976, UPS established a domestic operation in [[West Germany]].<ref name="UPS Pressroom">{{cite web|url=https://www.pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/about/HistoryStackList.page|title=History Timeline|website=www.pressroom.ups.com}}</ref>

UPS Next Day Air Service was launched in 1985 for all 48 contiguous states plus [[Puerto Rico]]. In 1988, UPS Airlines was launched with authorization from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]. UPS Airlines became the fastest-growing airline in FAA history and today is the 10th largest airline in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=UPS History Timeline|url=https://www.pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/about/HistoryStackList.page|publisher=UPS|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref> Domestic air service was added to [[Germany]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|title=UPS Airlines|url=https://www.ups.com/content/cn/en/about/history/1990.html?WT.svl=SubNav|website=UPS.com|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref> In 1991, UPS moved its headquarters to [[Sandy Springs, Georgia]], a suburb of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. In 1992, UPS acquired both [[Haulfast]] and [[Carryfast]] and rebranded them UPS Supply Chain Solutions. Haulfast provided the pallet haulage and trucking network for the CarryFast group of companies. By 1993, UPS was delivering up to 11.5 million packages and documents per day.

The large volume of UPS customers in the 1990s made UPS develop new technology for better efficiency. A handheld device called Delivery Information Acquisition Device (DIAD) was created to record and upload delivery information to the UPS network immediately upon pickup by every UPS driver. In 1992, UPS began tracking all ground shipments electronically. In 1994, UPS.com debuted, and provided an interface to make what was primarily internal operational information available for customer access. In 1995, UPS acquired [[SonicAir]] to offer service parts logistics and compete with Choice Logistics. In the same year, UPS launched UPS Logistics Group to facilitate global supply chain management services and consulting for customer needs. In 1997, a [[United Parcel Service strike of 1997|walkout]] by the 185,000 members of the [[Teamsters]] shut down UPS for 16 days.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.cnn.com/US/9708/20/ups.update.early/ | publisher= CNN | date= August 20, 1997 | title= It's official: Teamsters end UPS strike| accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> In 1998, UPS Capital was established to enable companies to grow their business through a comprehensive menu of integrated financial services through UPS.<ref>{{cite web|title=1991–1999|url=https://www.ups.com/content/cn/en/about/history/1999.html?WT.svl=SubNav|website=UPS.com|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref> UPS acquired Challenge Air in 1999 to expand its operations in Latin America.<ref>{{Cite news|title = UPS Agrees to Buy Challenge Air Cargo Assets|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jun/29/news/nc-51218|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = June 29, 1999|access-date = December 23, 2015|issn = 0458-3035|language = en-US|last = Bloomberg News}}</ref>

In 2004, UPS entered the [[freight|heavy freight]] business with purchase of [[Menlo Worldwide|Menlo Worldwide Forwarding]], a former subsidiary of [[Menlo Worldwide]]. UPS rebranded it as UPS Supply Chain Solutions. The purchase price was US$150&nbsp;million and the assumption of US$110&nbsp;million in long-term debt.

==Competitors==
Major competitors in the United States include the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) and [[FedEx]], along with regional carriers such as [[OnTrac]], and [[LSO (company)|LSO]] (formerly Lonestar Overnight). In addition to these domestic carriers, UPS competes with a variety of international operators, including [[Canada Post]] (and its subsidiary [[Purolator Courier|Purolator]]), [[TransForce]], [[Deutsche Post]] (and its subsidiary [[DHL Express|DHL]]), [[Royal Mail]], [[Japan Post Service]], [[India Post]] and many other regional carriers, national postal services and air cargo handlers (see [[Package delivery]] and [[Mail]] pages).

Historically, the bulk of competition for UPS came from inexpensive ground-based delivery services, such as [[Parcel post|Parcel Post]] (USPS) or Choice Logistics. In 1998, FedEx expanded into ground parcel delivery through its acquisition of [[Roadway Package System|RPS]] (formerly Roadway Package System), rebranding it as [[FedEx Ground]] in 2000. In 2003, DHL acquired [[Airborne Express]], expanding its operations in the United States.

In response to the expansion of FedEx and DHL, UPS partnered with the US Postal Service to offer UPS Mail Innovations,<ref>[http://www.upsmailinnovations.com/ UPSmailinnovations.com]. UPSmailinnovations.com. Retrieved on July 12, 2011.</ref> a program that allows UPS to pick up mail & packages weighing under one pound separately from the main ground network and transfer them to a USPS center, or destination delivery unit (DDU),<ref>[http://pe.usps.gov/Archive/HTML/DMMArchive1209/E250.htm PE.usps.gov] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705155849/http://pe.usps.gov/Archive/HTML/DMMArchive1209/E250.htm |date=July 5, 2007 }}. PE.usps.gov. Retrieved on July 12, 2011.</ref> for final distribution. This process is also known as zone skipping,<ref>[http://multichannelmerchant.com/opsandfulfillment/advisor/zone_skipping/ Multichannelmerchant.com]. Multichannelmerchant.com (January 18, 2006). Retrieved on July 12, 2011.</ref> long used by Parcel Consolidators.<ref>[https://www.usps.com/business/shipping-consolidators.htm Shipping Consolidators]. USPS.com. Retrieved on January 2, 2013.</ref> UPS also has a separate product called "SurePost" which uses the UPS Ground network to deliver packages weighing under 10 pounds to the nearest UPS Package Center, which transfers them to the USPS DDU for "final mile" delivery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logisticsmgmt.com/article/ups_rolls_out_new_economy_ground_service_for_delivery_to_residential_locati/|title=UPS rolls out new economy ground service for delivery to residential locations|date=April 11, 2011|work=logisticsmgmt.com}}</ref>

More recently, the continued growth of [[online shopping]], combined with increasing awareness of the role of transportation (including package delivery) on the [[Natural environment|environment]], has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents. For instance, the [[US Postal Service]] claims "greener delivery" of parcels on the assumption that USPS letter carriers deliver to each US address, six days a week anyway, and therefore offer the industry's lowest fuel consumption per delivery. Other carriers, like ParcelPool.com,<ref>[http://www.parcelpool.com/ Parcelpool.com]. Parcelpool.com. Retrieved on July 12, 2011.</ref> which specializes in residential package delivery to [[APO/FPO]] addresses, [[Hawaii]], [[Alaska]], [[Puerto Rico]], and other US Territories, arose in response to increased demand from catalog retailers and online e-tailers for low-cost residential delivery services closely matching service standards normally associated with more expensive expedited parcel delivery.

==Transportation==
UPS operates over 119,000 delivery vehicles worldwide, ranging from bicycles to tractor-trailer trucks.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/ContentDetailsViewer.page?ConceptType=FactSheets&id=1426321563187-193|title=UPS Fact Sheet|work=UPS Pressroom|access-date=September 11, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> In a long-running company policy to avoid advertisement or endorsement of a vehicle manufacturer, all external manufacturer emblems and badging are removed when a vehicle enters service (whenever possible).

The typical lifespan of a UPS ground vehicle is 20–25 years (or more), lasting until the structural integrity is compromised. The company does not re-sell any of its ground vehicles, so retired vehicles are almost always stripped of reusable parts before being sent to be crushed/broken up. Prior to scrapping, UPS trucks and trailers have all company branding painted over and are assigned an ADA (Automotive Destruction Authorization) number and must be crushed under the supervision of UPS Automotive personnel, which records the vehicle's destruction. The only exception to this policy are vehicles taken off the road for internal use; package cars (repainted white) are used for various purposes (typically at large hubs); older semi tractors sometimes see use as [[terminal tractor]]s.

===Delivery vans===
UPS refers to its [[Multi-stop truck|delivery van]] as a "package car". Several designs and sizes are used by the company, dependent on routes and package volume.

[[Morgan Olson]] (Grumman Olson), [[Utilimaster Corporation|Union City Body]], and [[Utilimaster Corporation|Utilimaster]] manufacture the bodies for UPS delivery vans.  While older vehicles were based on Ford or General Motors P-chassis, vehicles manufactured since the 1990s are based on Navistar, Freightliner, or Workhorse chassis. Originally, UPS delivery vehicles were equipped with manual transmissions and steering, although many newer vehicles are updated with automatic transmissions.

For lower-volume delivery routes, UPS utilizes production-based vehicles, including minivans (including the [[Ford Transit Connect]] and [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan C/V]]) and [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter|Mercedes-Benz (Dodge/Freightliner) Sprinter]] box vans. UPS has ordered [[Modec]] [[electric van]]s for its UK and German fleets. Energy costs play a huge part in the potential profitability of package delivery companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4evriders.org/2008/11/europe-ups-orders-modec-electric-vans-for-uk-and-german-fleets/|title=Europe: UPS Orders Modec Electric Vans for UK and German Fleets|date=November 20, 2008|accessdate=December 18, 2010}}</ref>

Most package cars have no air conditioning, with the exception of tractor-trailers. This has been considered to be a contributing factor to heatstroke and other heat-related health problems in drivers who work in these vehicles for the entire shift.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Visram |first1=Talib |title=UPS doesn't air condition its trucks.

On January 29, 2020, UPS invested in [[Arrival (company)]] and ordered 10,000 Generation 2 Electric Vehicles.<ref>https://arrival.com/news/ups-invests-in-arrival-and-orders-10000-generation-2-electric-vehicles</ref>

===Tractor-trailers===
UPS commonly refers to its ground package tractor-trailers as "feeders"; these vehicles are distinct from the [[UPS Freight]] fleet. In line with its delivery vehicles, nearly all UPS [[tractor unit]]s are painted in a Pullman brown livery.  Prior to the 1990s, many tractors were of [[Cab over|cabover]] configuration; as trailer-length laws were revised in the United States, the company transitioned towards the use of conventional-style semitractor. As of 2018, nearly the entire UPS semitractor fleet consists of conventional-cab trucks.

In North America, UPS utilizes a fleet of trucks from several manufacturers, including [[Mack Trucks]] (Pinnacle and Vision) and [[Navistar International|Navistar]] (International [[International ProStar|ProStar+]] and [[International 9000|9900i]]), along with PACCAR vehicles ([[Kenworth]] T800, T660 and T680). Older vehicles in the fleet include Ford/Sterling tractors ([[Ford L-Series|Aeromax/A-Line]]), Freightliner ([[Freightliner Argosy|Argosy]], the final cabover truck used by UPS); Mack CH and International 8100 tractors are in the process of being phased out.

Previous trucks used by UPS include the Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, International 8100/8200, International 9670, GMC Astro, Peterbilt 362, Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, WhiteGMC High Cabover/Road Commander II, Mack CH, Mack MH UltraLiner, Mack F, and Diamond T/Diamond Reo cabovers. At one time{{When|date=May 2017}}, UPS used electric-powered trucks (made by [[White Motor Company|White Motors]]) for deliveries in Manhattan, NYC. There were only a few hundred of them, but they were notable for their "spooky silence" when running{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

Painted a light gray, company-owned [[Semi-trailer|semitrailers]] are distinguished by a large UPS emblem on the forward portion of the trailer sides; newer trailers are distinguished by the fitment of [[trailer skirt]]s. Designed in several configurations, UPS uses several lengths of trailers (28, 45, 48, and 53 feet). Along with standard flat-bottom van trailers, there are drop-frame trailers (largely phased out of the fleet) and trailer-on-flatcar trailers (TOFC); the latter are trailers designed for transport on railroad cars.

Dependent on state and provincial regulations, many UPS short trailers are towed in tandem.

===Brown===
The brown color that UPS uses on its vehicles and uniforms is called ''[[Pullman brown]]''. Company founder James E. Casey originally wanted company vehicles to use a yellow paint scheme, but one of his partners, Charlie Soderstrom, stated that a yellow vehicle would be hard to keep clean and that [[Pullman (car or coach)|Pullman railroad cars]] were brown for just that reason.<ref name="cnn" />

During the 2000s, the company used the familiarity of its color scheme in an advertising slogan: ''"What can Brown do for you?"''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressroom.ups.com/pressreleases/archives/archive/0,1363,3917,00.html |title=UPS Launches Biggest, "Brownest" Ad Campaign Ever |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021102082746/http://pressroom.ups.com/pressreleases/archives/archive/0%2C1363%2C3917%2C00.html |archive-date=November 2, 2002 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Font===
UPS commissioned brand consultancy FutureBrand to develop its own font, ''UPS Sans'', for use in marketing and communication material. ''UPS Sans'' was created by slightly altering certain parts of [[FSI FontShop International]]'s font ''[[FF Dax]]'' without permission.
