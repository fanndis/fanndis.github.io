The IRA was formed in 1913 as the [[Irish Volunteers]], at a time when all of Ireland was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].<ref name="taylororigins">{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|pp=8–10.}}</ref> The Volunteers took part in the [[Easter Rising]] against [[British rule in Ireland|British rule]] in 1916, and the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]] that followed the [[Irish Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] by [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Republic)|Dáil Éireann]] in 1919, during which they came to be known as the [[Irish Republican Army (1919–1922)|Irish Republican Army]].<ref name="taylororigins"/> The subsequent [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], which [[partition of Ireland|partitioned Ireland]] into the [[Irish Free State]] and Northern Ireland, which remained part of the United Kingdom, caused a split in the IRA, the pro-Treaty IRA being absorbed into the [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]], which defeated the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|anti-Treaty IRA]] in the [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name="white1921">{{harvnb|White|2017|p=21.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|p=18.}}</ref> Subsequently, while denying the legitimacy of the Free State, the IRA focused on overthrowing the Northern Ireland state and the achievement of a [[united Ireland]], carrying out a [[S-Plan|bombing campaign in England in 1939 and 1940]],<ref>{{harvnb|Oppenheimer|2008|pp=53–55.}}</ref> a [[Northern campaign (Irish Republican Army)|campaign in Northern Ireland in the 1940s]],<ref>{{harvnb|English|2003|pp=67–70.}}</ref> and the [[Border campaign (Irish Republican Army)|Border campaign of 1956–1962]].<ref>{{harvnb|English|2003|p=75.}}</ref> Following the failure of the Border campaign, internal debate took place regarding the future of the IRA.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1995|p=72.}}</ref> Chief-of-staff [[Cathal Goulding]] wanted the IRA to adopt a [[socialist]] agenda and become involved in politics, while traditional republicans such as [[Seán Mac Stíofáin]] wanted to increase recruitment and rebuild the IRA.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|p=23.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|White|2017|p=45.}}</ref>

Following partition Northern Ireland became a [[Dominant-party system|''de facto'' one-party state]] governed by the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], in which Catholics viewed themselves as [[second-class citizen]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Shanahan|2008|p=12.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Dillon|1990|p=xxxvi.}}</ref> [[Protestant]]s were given preference in jobs and housing, and [[Local government in Northern Ireland|local government constituencies]] were [[gerrymandered]] in places such as [[Derry]].<ref name="tayloruvf">{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|pp=29–31.}}</ref> Policing was carried out by the armed [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) and the [[Ulster Special Constabulary|B-Specials]], both of which were almost exclusively Protestant.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|p=19.}}</ref> In the mid-1960s tension between the Catholic and Protestant communities was increasing.<ref name="tayloruvf"/> In 1966 Ireland celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising, prompting fears of a renewed IRA campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|p=27.}}</ref> Feeling under threat, Protestants formed the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF), which killed three people in May 1966, two of them Catholic men.<ref name="tayloruvf"/> In January 1967 the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA) was formed by a diverse group of people, including IRA members and liberal [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]].<ref name="whitecr">{{harvnb|White|2017|pp=47–48.}}</ref> Civil rights marches by NICRA and a similar organisation, [[People's Democracy (Ireland)|People's Democracy]], protesting against discrimination were met by [[counter-protest]]s and violent clashes with [[Ulster loyalist|loyalists]], including the [[Ulster Protestant Volunteers]] led by [[Ian Paisley]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|pp=39–43.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|White|2017|p=50.}}</ref>

Protestant marches celebrating [[The Twelfth]] in July 1969 led to riots and violent clashes in [[Belfast]], Derry and elsewhere.<ref>{{harvnb|Munck|1992|p=224.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|p=47.}}</ref> The following month a three-day riot began in the [[Bogside]] area of Derry, following a march by the Protestant [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]].<ref name="taylorbogside">{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|pp=49–50.}}</ref> The [[Battle of the Bogside]] caused Catholics in Belfast to riot in [[solidarity]] with the Bogsiders and to try to prevent RUC reinforcements being sent to Derry, sparking retaliation by Protestant mobs.<ref>{{harvnb|Shanahan|2008|p=13.}}</ref> The subsequent [[arson attack]]s, damage to property and intimidation forced 1,505 Catholic families and 315 Protestant families to leave their homes in Belfast in the [[Northern Ireland riots of August 1969]], with over 200 Catholic homes being destroyed or requiring major repairs.<ref>{{harvnb|Mallie|Bishop|1988|p=117.}}</ref> A number of people were killed on both sides, some by the police, and the British Army were [[Operation Banner|deployed to Northern Ireland]].<ref name="taylor1969"/> The IRA had been poorly armed and failed to properly defend Catholic areas from Protestant attacks,<ref>{{harvnb|Mallie|Bishop|1988|pp=108–112.}}</ref> which had been considered one of its roles since the 1920s.<ref>{{harvnb|English|2003|p=67.}}</ref> Veteran republicans were critical of Cathal Goulding and the IRA's Dublin leadership which, for political reasons, had refused to prepare for aggressive action in advance of the violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|p=60.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mallie|Bishop|1988|pp=93–94.}}</ref> On 24 August a group including [[Joe Cahill]], [[Seamus Twomey]], [[Dáithí Ó Conaill]], [[Billy McKee]], and [[Jimmy Steele (republican)|Jimmy Steele]] came together in Belfast and decided to remove the pro-Goulding Belfast leadership of [[Billy McMillen]] and [[Jim Sullivan (Irish republican)|Jim Sullivan]] and turn back to traditional militant republicanism.<ref name="mb125">{{harvnb|Mallie|Bishop|1988|p=125.}}</ref> On 22 September Twomey, McKee, and Steele were among sixteen armed IRA men who confronted the Belfast leadership over the failure to adequately defend Catholic areas.<ref name="mb125"/> A compromise was agreed where McMillen stayed in command, but he was not to have any communication with the IRA's Dublin based leadership.<ref name="mb125"/>

Following the convention the traditionalists canvassed support throughout Ireland, with IRA director of intelligence Seán Mac Stíofáin meeting the disaffected members of the IRA in Belfast.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|p=65.}}</ref> Shortly after, the traditionalists held a convention which elected a [[IRA Army Council|"Provisional" Army Council]], composed of Seán Mac Stíofáin, [[Ruairí Ó Brádaigh]], Paddy Mulcahy, Sean Tracey, [[Leo Martin (Irish republican)|Leo Martin]], Dáithí Ó Conaill, and Joe Cahill.<ref name="mallie137">{{harvnb|Mallie|Bishop|1988|p=137.}}</ref> The term provisional was chosen to mirror the 1916 [[Provisional Government of the Irish Republic]],<ref name="white1969gac"/> and also to designate it as temporary pending [[ratification]] by a further IRA convention.{{refn|group=n|Following a convention in September 1970 the "Provisional" Army Council announced that the provisional period had finished, but the name stuck.<ref name="mallie137"/>}}<ref name="mallie137"/><ref>{{harvnb|White|1993|p=52.}}</ref> Nine out of thirteen IRA units in Belfast sided with the "Provisional" Army Council in December 1969, roughly 120 activists and 500 supporters.<ref>{{harvnb|Mallie|Bishop|1988|p=141.}}</ref> The Provisional IRA issued their first public statement on 28 December 1969,<ref name=allegiance/> stating:

<blockquote>We declare our allegiance to the 32 county Irish republic, proclaimed at Easter 1916, established by the first Dáil Éireann in 1919, overthrown by force of arms in 1922 and suppressed to this day by the existing British-imposed six-county and twenty-six-county partition states{{nbsp}}...

The political party Sinn Féin split along the same lines on 11 January 1970 in Dublin, when a third of the delegates walked out of the [[ard fheis]] in protest at the party leadership's attempt to force through the ending of abstentionism, despite its failure to achieve a two-thirds majority vote of delegates required to change the policy.{{refn|group=n|When the resolution failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority to change Sinn Féin policy the leadership announced a resolution recognising the "Official" Army Council, which would only require a [[majority|simple majority]] vote to pass.<ref name="taylorsplit"/> At this point [[Seán Mac Stíofáin]] led the walkout after declaring allegiance to the "Provisional" Army Council.<ref name="taylorsplit"/>}}<ref name="taylorsplit"/> The delegates that walked out reconvened in Kevin Barry Hall in [[Parnell Square]], where Seán Mac Stíofáin, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Paddy Mulcahy from the "Provisional" Army Council were elected to the Caretaker Executive of "Provisional" Sinn Féin.{{refn|group=n|The provisional period for "Provisional" Sinn Féin ended at an ard fheis in October 1970, when the Caretaker Executive was dissolved and an [[Ard Chomhairle]] was elected, with Ruairí Ó Brádaigh becoming [[president of Sinn Féin]].<ref>{{harvnb|White|2017|pp=78–79.}}</ref> [[Tomás Mac Giolla]], president of the pre-split Sinn Féin since 1962,<ref>{{harvnb|Feeney|2002|p=219.}}</ref> continued as president of [[Official Sinn Féin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hanley|Millar|2010|p=482.}}</ref>}}<ref>{{harvnb|White|2017|p=67.}}</ref> Despite the declared support of that faction of Sinn Féin, the early Provisional IRA avoided political activity, instead relying on [[physical force republicanism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|pp=104–105.}}</ref> £100,000 was donated by the [[Fianna Fáil]]-led [[Irish government]] in 1969 to "defence committees" in Catholic areas, some of which ended up in the hands of the IRA.<ref name="armstrial"/><ref>{{harvnb|Moloney|2007|p=265.}}</ref> This resulted in the 1970 [[Arms Crisis]] where criminal charges were pursued against two former government ministers and others including [[John Kelly (Sinn Féin politician)|John Kelly]], an IRA [[Volunteer (Irish republican)|volunteer]] from Belfast.<ref name="armstrial">{{harvnb|English|2003|p=119.}}</ref> The Provisional IRA maintained the principles of the pre-1969 IRA, considering both British rule in Northern Ireland and the government of the [[Republic of Ireland]] to be illegitimate, and the Army Council to be the [[provisional government]] of the all-island [[Irish Republic]].<ref>{{harvnb|White|2017|p=66.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|English|2003|p=107.}}</ref> This belief was based on a [[Irish republican legitimatism|series of perceived political inheritances]] which constructed a legal continuity from the [[Second Dáil]].<ref name="obrien104"/> The IRA recruited many young nationalists from Northern Ireland who had not been involved in the IRA before, but had been radicalised by the violence that broke out in 1969.<ref>{{harvnb|Mallie|Bishop|1988|pp=151–152.}}</ref><ref name="moloney80">{{harvnb|Moloney|2007|p=80.}}</ref> These people became known as "sixty niners", having joined after 1969.{{refn|group=n|The IRA also used "forties men" for volunteers such as [[Joe Cahill]] who fought in the [[Northern campaign (Irish Republican Army)|Northern campaign]],<ref>{{harvnb|Coogan|2000|p=366.}}</ref> and "fifties men" for volunteers who fought in the [[Border campaign (Irish Republican Army)|Border campaign]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bowyer Bell|1990|p=16.}}</ref>}}<ref name="moloney80"/> The IRA adopted the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] as the symbol of the Irish republican rebirth in 1969, one of its slogans was "out of the ashes rose the Provisionals", representing the IRA's resurrection from the ashes of burnt-out Catholic areas of Belfast.<ref name="phoenix"/><ref>{{harvnb|Nordstrom|Martin|1992|p=199.}}</ref>

Following the end of the ceasefire, the British government introduced a new three-part strategy to deal with the Troubles; the parts became known as [[Ulsterisation]], normalisation, and criminalisation.<ref name="taylor202">{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|p=202.}}</ref> Ulsterisation involved increasing the role of the locally recruited RUC and [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR), in order to try to contain the conflict inside Northern Ireland and reduce the number of [[regular army]] soldiers being killed.<ref name="taylor202"/><ref name="white124">{{harvnb|White|2017|p=124.}}</ref> Normalisation involved the ending of internment without trial and [[Special Category Status]], the latter had been introduced in 1972 following a hunger strike led by Billy McKee.<ref name="white124"/><ref>{{harvnb|English|2003|p=193.}}</ref> Criminalisation was designed to alter public perception of the Troubles, from an insurgency requiring a military solution to a criminal problem requiring a law enforcement solution.<ref name="taylor202"/><ref>{{harvnb|Shanahan|2008|p=225.}}</ref> As result of the withdrawal of Special Category Status, in September 1976 IRA prisoner [[Kieran Nugent]] began the [[blanket protest]] in the [[Maze Prison]], when hundreds of prisoners refused to wear prison uniforms.<ref>{{harvnb|English|2003|p=190.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|pp=203–204.}}</ref>

# A war of attrition against enemy personnel [British Army] which is aimed at causing as many casualties and deaths as possible so as to create a demand from their [the British] people at home for their withdrawal.
# A bombing campaign aimed at making the enemy's financial interests in our country unprofitable while at the same time curbing long-term investment in our country.
# To make the Six Counties{{nbsp}}... ungovernable except by colonial military rule.
# To sustain the war and gain support for its ends by National and International propaganda and publicity campaigns.
# By defending the war of liberation by punishing criminals, [[Collaborationism|collaborators]] and [[informant|informers]].<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|1999|p=23.}}</ref>

Having compared the weapons decommissioned with the British and Irish security forces' estimates of the IRA's arsenal, and because of the IRA's full involvement in the process of decommissioning the weapons, the IICD arrived at their conclusion that all IRA weaponry has been decommissioned.{{refn|group=n|In 1992 [[Colonel Gaddafi]] is understood to have given the British government a detailed inventory of weapons he supplied to the IRA.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyne|2006|pp=391–393.}}</ref>}}<ref>{{harvnb|Boyne|2006|p=412.}}</ref> The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, [[Peter Hain]], said he accepted the conclusion of the IICD.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyne|2006|pp=412–413.}}</ref> Since then, there have been occasional claims in the media that the IRA had not decommissioned all of its weaponry.<ref name="boyne414">{{harvnb|Boyne|2006|p=414.}}</ref> In response to such claims, the [[Independent Monitoring Commission]] (IMC) stated in its tenth report that the IRA had decommissioned all weaponry under its control.<ref name="boyne414"/> It said that if any weapons had been kept, they would have been kept by individuals and against IRA orders.{{refn|group=n|General de Chastelain has also stated weapons might have been lost due to a person responsible for them having died.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyne|2006|p=424.}}</ref> [[Michael McKevitt]], the IRA's quartermaster-general who left to form the [[Real IRA]], is known to have taken [[materiel]] from IRA arms dumps.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyne|2006|p=423.}}</ref>}}<ref name="boyne414"/>

The oldest dissident group is the [[Continuity IRA]], which formed in 1986 following a split in the republican movement, over the decision to allow members, if elected, to take seats in [[Dáil Éireann]].<ref name="horgan1986">{{harvnb|Horgan|2013|p=22.}}</ref> This group was inactive for several years while acquiring weapons and finance,<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|pp=361–362.}}</ref> their first attack was in 1994 during the Provisional IRA's first ceasefire.<ref>{{harvnb|Horgan|2013|p=51.}}</ref> The Real IRA was formed in November 1997 when senior Provisional IRA members, including quartermaster-general [[Michael McKevitt]], resigned over acceptance of the [[Mitchell Principles]].<ref>{{harvnb|White|2017|p=297.}}</ref> The Real IRA is best known for the 1998 [[Omagh bombing]] which killed 29 civilians, and the 2009 [[Massereene Barracks shooting]] which killed two British soldiers.<ref>{{harvnb|Horgan|2013|p=28.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|White|2017|p=309.}}</ref> In 2005/6 some Provisional IRA members defected and formed [[Óglaigh na hÉireann (Real IRA splinter group)|Óglaigh na hÉireann]], which became active in 2009.<ref name="horganonh">{{harvnb|Horgan|2013|p=36.}}</ref> This group also included former members of the Irish National Liberation Army and a faction that splintered from the Real IRA.<ref name="horganonh"/> In 2011 a group calling itself "the IRA" claimed responsibility for the [[murder of Ronan Kerr]], a Catholic member of the PSNI.<ref name="horganira">{{harvnb|Horgan|2013|pp=37–38.}}</ref> The group was believed to have formed in 2008, and included former senior Provisional IRA members unhappy at Sinn Féin's direction and the peace process.<ref name="horganira"/> Also in 2008, [[Republican Action Against Drugs]] (RAAD) was formed in Derry.<ref name="horganraad">{{harvnb|Horgan|2013|p=39.}}</ref> This [[vigilante]] group's membership included former Provisional IRA members and members of other republican groups.<ref name="horganraad"/> RAAD, "the IRA", and some smaller groups merged with the Real IRA in 2012 to form the [[New IRA]].<ref>{{harvnb|White|2017|p=382.}}</ref>
