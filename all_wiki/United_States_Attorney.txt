There are 93 U.S. Attorney offices located throughout the United States, [[Puerto Rico]], the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Guam]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. One U.S. Attorney is assigned to each of the [[United States federal judicial district|judicial districts]], with the exception of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands where [[United States Attorney for the Districts of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands|a single U.S. Attorney]] serves both districts. Each U.S. Attorney is the chief federal law enforcement officer within his or her particular jurisdiction, acting under the guidance of the ''[[United States Attorneys' Manual]]''.<ref>

An [[Assistant United States Attorney]] (AUSA), or federal prosecutor, is a public official who represents the federal government on behalf of the U.S. Attorney (USA) in criminal prosecutions, and in certain civil cases as either the plaintiff or the defendant. In carrying out their duties as prosecutors, AUSAs have the authority to investigate persons, issue subpoenas, file formal criminal charges, plea bargain with defendants, and grant immunity to witnesses and accused criminals.<ref>[http://www.americanbar.org/publications/criminal_justice_section_archive/crimjust_standards_pinvestigate.html] Standards on Prosecutorial Investigations</ref>

U.S. Attorneys and their offices are part of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. U.S. Attorneys receive oversight, supervision, and administrative support services through the Justice Department's [[Executive Office for United States Attorneys]]. Selected U.S. Attorneys participate in the [[Attorney General's Advisory Committee of United States Attorneys]].

==History and statutory authority==
The Office of the United States Attorney was created by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], along with the office of [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] and the [[United States Marshals Service]]. The same act also specified the structure of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and established inferior courts making up the [[United States federal courts|United States Federal Judiciary]],  including  a district court system.  Thus, the office of U.S. Attorney  is older than the Department of Justice.  The Judiciary Act of 1789  provided for the appointment in each judicial district of a "Person learned in the law to act as attorney for the United States...whose duty it shall be to prosecute in each district all delinquents for crimes and offenses cognizable under the authority of the United States, and all civil actions in which the United States shall be concerned..."
Prior to the existence of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorneys were independent of the Attorney General, and did not come under the AG's supervision and authority until 1870, with the creation of the Department of Justice.<ref name = 'Sisk-book-Litigation With the Federal Government (2nd Edition)'>

==Appointment==
The U.S. Attorney is appointed by the [[President of the United States]]<ref>{{usc|28|541}}(a).</ref> for a term of four years,<ref>{{usc|28|541}}(b).</ref> with appointments subject to [[United States Senate#Appointments|confirmation]] by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].  A U.S. Attorney continues in office, beyond the appointed term, until a successor is appointed and qualified.<ref>{{USC|28|541}}(b)</ref>  By law, each United States attorney is subject to removal by the President.<ref>{{usc|28|541}}(c).</ref> The [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] has had the authority since 1986 to appoint interim U.S. Attorneys to fill a vacancy.

===United States Attorneys controversy===
{{Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy small}}
{{main|Dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy}}
The governing statute, {{USC|28|546}} provided, up until March 9, 2006:
<blockquote>
 (c) A person appointed as United States attorney under this section may serve until the earlier of—
:(1) the qualification of a United States attorney for such district appointed by the President under section 541 of this title; or
:(2) the expiration of 120 days after appointment by the Attorney General under this section.
(d) If an appointment expires under subsection (c)(2), the district court for such district may appoint a United States attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled. The order of appointment by the court shall be filed with the clerk of the court.
</blockquote>
On March 9, 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the [[Patriot Act#Reauthorizations|USA PATRIOT and Terrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2005]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-109publ177/pdf/PLAW-109publ177.pdf#page=56 |title=Pub. L. 109–177, title V, § 502 |publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office |accessdate=June 20, 2020}}</ref> which amended Section 546 by striking subsections (c) and (d) and inserting the following new subsection:
<blockquote>
 (c) A person appointed as United States attorney under this section may serve until the qualification of a United States Attorney for such district appointed by the President under section 541 of this title.
</blockquote>
This, in effect, extinguished the 120-day limit on interim U.S. Attorneys, and their appointment had an indefinite term. If the president failed to put forward any nominee to the Senate, then the Senate confirmation process was avoided, as the Attorney General-appointed interim U.S. Attorney could continue in office without limit or further action.  Related to the [[dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy]], in March 2007 the Senate and the House voted to overturn the amendments of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] to the interim appointment statute. The bill was signed by  President George W. Bush, and became law in June 2007.<ref>

===History of interim U.S. Attorney appointments===
Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D, California), summarized the history of interim United States Attorney appointments, on March 19, 2007 in the Senate.<ref>''Congressional Record'', March 19, 2007, {{USCongRec|2007|S3240}} -S3241)</ref>
{{Quote|When first looking into this issue, I found that the statutes had given the courts the authority to appoint an interim U.S. attorney and that this dated back as far as the Civil War.  Specifically, the authority was first vested with the circuit courts in March 1863.

Then, in 1898, a House of Representatives report explained that while Congress believed it was important to have the courts appoint an interim U.S. attorney:

"There was a problem relying on circuit courts since the circuit justice is not always to be found in the circuit and time is wasted in ascertaining his whereabouts."

Therefore, at that time, the interim appointment authority was switched to the district courts; that is, in 1898 it was switched to the district courts.

Thus, for almost 100 years, the district courts were in charge of appointing interim U.S. attorneys, and they did so with virtually no problems. This structure was left undisturbed until 1986 when the statute was changed during the Reagan administration.  In a bill that was introduced by Senator Strom Thurmond, the statute was changed to give the appointment authority to the Attorney General, but even then it was restricted and the Attorney General had a 120-day time limit.  After that time, if a nominee was not confirmed, the district courts would appoint an interim U.S. attorney.  The adoption of this language was part of a larger package that was billed as technical amendments to criminal law, and thus there was no recorded debate in either the House or the Senate and both Chambers passed the bill by voice vote.

Then, 20 years later, in March 2006 – again without much debate and again as a part of a larger package – a statutory change was inserted into the PATRIOT Act reauthorization. This time, the Executive's power was expanded even further, giving the Attorney General the authority to appoint an interim replacement indefinitely and without Senate confirmation.}}

==Role of U.S. Attorneys==
The U.S. Attorney is both the primary representative and the administrative head of the ''Office of the U.S. Attorney'' for the district. The U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) is the chief prosecutor for the United States in [[criminal law]] cases, and represents the United States in [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] cases as either the defendant or plaintiff, as appropriate.<ref>see generally {{usc|28|547}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title1/2mdoj.htm#1-2.500 |title=US Attorneys' Manual. Title 1, section 1-2.500 |publisher=usdoj.gov}}</ref>  However, they are not the only one that can represent the United States in Court.  In certain circumstances, using an action called a ''[[qui tam]]'', any U.S. citizen, provided they are represented by an attorney, can represent the interests of the United States, and share in penalties assessed against guilty parties.

The [[U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia]] has the additional responsibility of prosecuting local criminal cases in the [[Superior Court of the District of Columbia]], the equivalent of a municipal court for the national capital. The Superior Court is a federal Article I court.<ref>http://www.judgepedia.org/index.php/William_Roshko/</ref>

==Executive Office for United States Attorneys==
<!-- note: many outside articles link to this section ** don't change this section title ** without doing a search for those incoming links -->

The [[Executive Office for United States Attorneys|Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA)]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/jm/title-3-eousa|title=Justice Manual'', Title 3|publisher=justice.gov}}</ref> provides the administrative support for the 93 United States Attorneys (encompassing 94 United States Attorneys' offices, as the Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands has a single U.S. Attorney for both districts), including:
* General executive assistance and direction,
* Policy development,
* Administrative management direction and oversight,
* Operational support,
* Coordination with other components of the [[United States Department of Justice]] and other federal agencies.

These responsibilities include certain legal, budgetary, administrative, and personnel services, as well as legal education.

The EOUSA was created on April 6, 1953, by Attorney General Order No. 8-53 to provide for close liaison between the Department of Justice in Washington, DC, and the 93 U.S. attorneys located throughout the 50 states, the District of Columbia, [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]].  It was organized by [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judge]] [[James R. Browning]], who also served as its first chief.
