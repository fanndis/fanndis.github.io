'''Michaëlle Jean'''  ({{IPA-fr|mika.ɛl ʒɑ̃}}; born September 6, 1957) is a Canadian stateswoman and former journalist who was the [[Governor General of Canada]] from 2005 to 2010, the [[List of Governors General of Canada#Governors General of Canada, 1867–present|27th]] since [[Canadian Confederation]]. She is the first Haitian Canadian to hold this office.

Jean was the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie#Executive Secretariat (Secretaries-General)|third Secretary-General of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] from 2015 until 2019. She was the first woman to hold the position and held the position until the end of 2018. 

Jean was a [[refugee]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/3e1eaa6d4.html |title=Jean, Michaëlle |publisher=The UN Refugee Agency |access-date=June 11, 2010}}</ref> from Haiti—coming to Canada in 1968—and was raised in the town of [[Thetford Mines]], [[Quebec]]. After receiving a number of university degrees, Jean worked as a journalist and broadcaster for [[Radio-Canada]] and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC), as well as undertaking charity work, mostly in the field of assisting victims of [[domestic violence]]. In 2005, she was appointed governor general by Queen [[Elizabeth II]], on the recommendation of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]], to replace [[Adrienne Clarkson]] as [[vicereine]] and she occupied the post until succeeded by [[David Johnston]] in 2010. Early in her tenure, comments of hers recorded in some of the film works by her husband, [[Jean-Daniel Lafond]], were construed as supporting [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec sovereignty]] and her holding of [[dual citizenship]] caused doubt about her loyalties. But Jean denied separatist leanings, renounced her citizenship of France (acquired through her marriage), and eventually became a respected vicereine noted for her attention to the Canadian Forces, Aboriginal Canadians, and the arts, especially youth involvement in them. In 2010, Jean was appointed to a four-year term as the [[Diplomatic rank#Special envoy|Special Envoy for Haiti]] for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/micha%C3%ABlle-jean-begins-un-job-1.905850 |title=Michaëlle Jean begins UN job – CBC News |access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Chiostro Unicatt.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore|Catholic University of Milan]], where Jean studied languages and literature]]

Jean received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Italian and [[Spanish language|Hispanic languages]] and literature from the [[University of Montreal]], and, from 1984 to 1986, taught Italian Studies there, while completing her [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[comparative literature]]. She then went on with language and literature studies at the [[University of Florence]], the [[University of Perugia]], and the [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore|Catholic University of Milan]]. Besides French and English, Jean is fluent in Spanish, Italian, and [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]], and can read Portuguese.<ref name=CBC1 /><ref name="rock">{{Cite news |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/michaelle-jean-steps-down-as-university-of-ottawa-chancellor |title=Michaëlle Jean steps down as University of Ottawa chancellor |date=April 14, 2015 |work=Ottawa Citizen |access-date=July 12, 2015}}</ref>

Concurrent with her studies between 1979 and 1987, Jean coordinated a study on spousal abuse and worked at a [[women's shelter]],<ref name=CE /> which paved the way for her establishment of a network of shelters for women and children across Canada. She also involved herself in organizations dedicated to assisting immigrants to Canada obtain the entry they desired, and later worked for [[Human Resources and Skills Development Canada|Employment and Immigration Canada]] and at the ''Conseil des Communautés culturelles du Québec'', where Jean began writing about the experiences of immigrant women.<ref name=CBC1 /> She married French-born, Canadian [[filmmaker]] [[Jean-Daniel Lafond]], and the couple adopted as their daughter Marie-Éden, an [[orphan]]ed child from [[Jacmel]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/haiti/governor-general-shares-grief-with-bc-haitians/article1463457/ |title=Governor-General shares grief with B.C.

== Journalism, broadcasting, and film careers ==
Jean became a reporter, filmmaker, and broadcaster for [[Television de Radio-Canada|Radio-Canada]] in 1988,<ref name=GGJean /><ref name=CBC1 /> hosting news and affairs programmes such as ''Actuel'', ''Montréal ce soir'', ''Virages'', and ''[[Le Point (TV series)|Le Point]]''; she was the first person of Caribbean descent to be seen on French television news in Canada.<ref name=CE /> She then moved in 1995 to ''[[Réseau de l'information]]'' (RDI), Radio-Canada's all-news channel, in order to anchor a number of programmes, ''Le Monde ce soir'', ''l'Édition québécoise'', ''Horizons francophones'', ''Les Grands reportages'', ''Le Journal RDI'', and ''RDI à l'écoute'', for example. Four years later, she was asked by CBC's English language all-news channel, [[CBC Newsworld]], to host ''[[The Passionate Eye]]'' and ''[[Rough Cuts (TV series)|Rough Cuts]]'', which both broadcast the best in Canadian and foreign documentary films. By 2004, Jean was hosting her own show, ''Michaëlle'', while continuing to anchor RDI's ''[[Grands reportages]]'', as well as acting occasionally as anchor of ''[[Le Téléjournal]]''.<ref name=CBC1 />

Over the same period, Jean made several films with her husband, including the award-winning ''Haïti dans tous nos rêves'' ("Haiti in All Our Dreams"),<ref name=GGJean /> in which she meets her uncle, the poet and essayist [[René Depestre]], who fled from the Duvalier dictatorship into exile in France and wrote about his dreams for Haiti, and tells him Haiti awaits his return. She similarly produced and hosted news and documentary programming for television on both the English and French services of the CBC.<ref name=CBC1 />

== Governor General of Canada ==
Jean was Canada's first governor general of Caribbean origin; the third woman (after [[Jeanne Sauvé]] and [[Adrienne Clarkson]]); the fourth youngest (after [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|the Marquess of Lorne]], who was 33 years old in 1878; [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|the Marquess of Lansdowne]], who was 38 years old in 1883; and [[Edward Schreyer]], who was 43 years old in 1979); the fourth former journalist (after Sauvé, [[Roméo LeBlanc]] and Clarkson); and the second after Clarkson to not only have neither a political nor military background, but also to be a [[visible minority]], to break the tradition of Canadian-born governors general, and to be in an [[interracial marriage]]. Jean was also the first representative of [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen]] [[Elizabeth II]] to have been born during the latter's reign, and her appointment saw the first child living in [[Rideau Hall]], the official residence, since Schreyer and his young family lived there in the early 1980s.

=== As governor general-designate ===
On August 4, 2005, it was announced from the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|Office of the Prime Minister of Canada]] that Queen Elizabeth II had approved [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]]'s choice of Jean to succeed Adrienne Clarkson as the Queen's representative. At the time, Martin said of Jean that she "is a woman of talent and achievement. Her personal story is nothing short of extraordinary. And extraordinary is precisely what we seek in a governor generalship—who after all must represent all of Canada to all Canadians and to the rest of the world as well."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news.asp?id=556 |title=Announcement by Paul Martin of Michaëlle Jean's appointment |last=Office of the Prime Minister |date=August 4, 2005 |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211085728/http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/news.asp?id=556 |archive-date=December 11, 2005 |access-date=August 8, 2005}}</ref> Almost immediately, there was speculation that Martin had been influenced by the political climate in [[Ottawa]] at the time, leading the Prime Minister to deny that rejuvenated popularity for [[Liberal Party of Canada|his party]] in Quebec was a motivating factor in his decision.

From [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition]], the upcoming appointment was met with mostly favourable comments,{{#tag:ref|[[Stephen Harper]], then the [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition]] as head of the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]], offered his congratulations and said that Jean's life story "serves as a great example to many Canadians.

However, by August 11, 2005, reports emerged of a forthcoming piece by René Boulanger for the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec sovereigntist]] publication ''[[Le Québécois]]'' that would reveal Jean and her husband's support for Quebec independence, citing Lafond's associations with former members of the [[terrorist]] organization, the ''[[Front de libération du Québec]]'' (FLQ),<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050811/LAFOND11/National/Idx |title=Rideau Hall pick disappoints separatist hard-liners |last=Peritz |first=Ingrid |date=August 11, 2005 |work=The Globe and Mail |access-date=August 11, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050813002909/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050811/LAFOND11/National/Idx |archive-date=August 13, 2005}}</ref> specifically [[Jacques Rose]]. Though Boulanger admitted that he was motivated to incite a rejection of Jean by Anglophone Canadians, Gilles Rhéaume, former president of the [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society]], called on the Governor General-Designate to reveal how she voted in Quebec's [[1995 Quebec independence referendum|1995 referendum on independence]],<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/separatist-says-come-clean-jean/article20425086/ |title=Separatist says 'Come clean, Jean' |last=Wyatt |first=Nelson |date=August 11, 2005 |work=The Globe and Mail |access-date=November 3, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209175313/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/separatist-says-come-clean-jean/article20425086/ |archive-date=February 9, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1123796154319_119205354/?hub=Canada |title=GG-designate challenged on 1995 referendum vote |last=Canadian Press |date=August 11, 2005 |access-date=August 11, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050911081144/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1123796154319_119205354/?hub=Canada |archive-date=September 11, 2005 |publisher=CTV}}</ref> and [[Member of Parliament#Canada|Members of Parliament]], as well as some [[Premier (Canada)|provincial premiers]], demanded that Jean and her husband clarify where their sympathies lay.<ref name="CBCPremiers">{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/08/12/jean-sovereignty050812.html |title=New governor general must clarify sovereignty position, premiers say |date=August 12, 2005 |access-date=August 12, 2005 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> Then, four days after the Prime Minister publicly explained that Jean and her spouse had both undergone thorough [[background check]]s by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]],<ref name=CBCPremiers /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/martin-defends-viceregal-pair/article4119954/ |title=Martin defends viceregal pair |last=LeBlanc |first=Daniel |date=August 13, 2005 |work=The Globe and Mail |access-date=November 3, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107054012/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/martin-defends-viceregal-pair/article4119954/ |archive-date=January 7, 2016}}</ref> there came to light, on August 17, the existence of a documentary in which Jean had been filmed with several hard-line Quebec separatists, all toasting "to independence" after Jean stated: "Independence can't be given, it must be taken."

That same day, Jean responded with a public statement, saying "I wish to tell you unequivocally that both my husband and I are proud to be Canadian and that we have the greatest respect for the institutions of our country. We are fully committed to Canada. I would not have accepted this position otherwise... [We] have never belonged to a political party or the separatist movement," and went on to say that in the documented footage she had been speaking about Haiti, and not Quebec. Martin added on his earlier comments: "There is no doubt in my mind that her devotion to Canada is longstanding and resolute,"<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Statement by Paul Martin on the Governor General-Designate |date=August 17, 2005 |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister |url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news.asp?id=564 |access-date=August 17, 2005 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080610212700/http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=564 |archive-date=June 10, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> though some critics continued to argue that Jean's response had been too vague. By late August, polls showed that there had been a 20% drop in support for the recommendation of Jean as the next governor general, in response to which the Haitian community voiced their support for Jean, even holding special church services in her honour.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/haitian-community-holds-special-church-service-for-the-governor-general-designate-1.568043 |title=Haitian community holds special church service for the governor general-designate |date=August 27, 2005 |access-date=November 3, 2015 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> Jean reaffirmed in late 2010 that the rumours of her separatist sympathies were untrue and revealed that she had been upset by those journalists who she saw as capitalizing on sensationalism, rather than seeking accuracy through investigation, but she had been advised repeatedly not to respond.<ref name="Wherry">{{Cite journal |last=Wherry |first=Aaron |date=October 3, 2010 |title=Michaëlle Jean in conversation |url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/10/03/michaelle-jean-in-conversation/ |url-status=live |journal=Maclean's |location=Toronto |issue=October 2010 |issn=0024-9262 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020194315/http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/10/03/michaelle-jean-in-conversation/ |archive-date=October 20, 2010 |access-date=October 21, 2010}}</ref>

The Queen held [[Audience (meeting)|audience]] with Jean and her family on September 6, 2005, at [[Balmoral Castle]]. Though this type of meeting with a governor general-designate was standard, Jean's was unique in that the presence of her young daughter marked the first time in Elizabeth's reign that her designated viceroy-to-be had brought a child to an audience, which caused some protocol issues.<ref name="StarDelacourt">{{Citation |last=Delacourt |first=Susan |title=When the Queen is your boss |date=May 25, 2012 |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1193874--when-the-queen-is-your-boss |work=Toronto Star |access-date=May 27, 2012}}</ref> The weekend was informal; for one dinner, coincidentally on the eve of Jean's birthday, the Queen drove Jean and her family to a cottage on the Balmoral estate, where they were joined by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]], who, along with the Queen, performed the cooking and washing up.

Upon her return to Canada, Jean yet again became a target when the subject of her [[dual citizenship]] was raised, in particular the [[French nationality law|French variety]] she had obtained through her marriage to the French-born Lafond. A section of the [[Napoleonic code|French civil code]] forbade French citizens from holding government or military positions in other countries,{{#tag:ref|Article 23-8 of the [[Napoleonic code]] allows the French government to ask French citizens to leave the foreign service or lose French nationality in 15 days to two months.|group=n|name=Citizen}} yet Jean, as governor general, would hold a governmental position as the representative of Canada's [[head of state]], and, as such, would have a military role carrying out the duties of [[Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces]], as constitutionally vested in the monarch.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ca_1867.html |title=Constitution Act, 1867 |last=Victoria |publisher=Queen's Printer |series=III.15 |location=Westminster |publication-date=March 29, 1867 |author-link=Victoria of the United Kingdom |access-date=February 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203024121/http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ca_1867.html |archive-date=February 3, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> The French embassy in Ottawa stated that there was "no question" that the law would not be enforced in Jean's case, but, on September 25, two days before her swearing-in, Jean made it public that she had renounced her French citizenship "[in] light of the responsibilities related to the function of Governor General of Canada and Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces" and "France acceded to my request by decree on September 23, 2005."<ref name="CBCForces">{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-governor-general-to-give-up-french-citizenship-1.543621 |title=New governor general to give up French citizenship |date=September 25, 2005 |access-date=November 3, 2015 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000447553&dateTexte= |title=Décret du 23 septembre 2005 portant libération des liens d'allégeance à l'égard de la France |date=September 24, 2005 |publisher=Legifrance |access-date=May 25, 2013 |journal=Journal Officiel de la République Française}}</ref>

At her investiture ceremony in the [[Senate of Canada|Senate chamber]] on September 27, 2005, Jean declared in a speech described as "moving" that "the time of the [[Two Solitudes (Canadian society)|Two Solitudes]] that for too long described the character of this country is past," and called for the protection of the environment, the shielding of culture against [[globalization]], and an end to the marginalization of young people. According to one media account, "the pomp and circumstance of Canada's most significant state function were blended with humour, passion and even tears."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/national/features/governor_general/story.html?id=78549c49-781f-43c0-908d-20f24db2ca5a |title=Passion and Tears: Jean Sworn In |last=Thompson |first=Elizabeth |date=September 28, 2005 |work=The Gazette |access-date=September 28, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060404075846/http://www.canada.com/national/features/governor_general/story.html?id=78549c49-781f-43c0-908d-20f24db2ca5a |archive-date=April 4, 2006}}</ref> while ''The Globe and Mail'' columnist [[John Ibbitson]] reflected the general captivation with the new governor general in the following way:

Echoing her inaugural speech, the motto on the personal [[coat of arms]] created for Jean upon taking office as governor general was ''BRISER LES SOLITUDES'', which translates into "breaking down solitudes". One of her first acts as vicereine was then to launch an [[online]] chat with Canadians, as part of the larger project of creating within the Governor General's [[domain name]] a [[website]] dubbed "Citizen Voices: Breaking Down Solitudes", where users could engage each other in discussion forums and prominent individuals could post blog entries. The focus extended beyond simply the relationship between the traditional Two Solitudes of [[Francophone]]s and [[English Canadian|Anglophones]] in Canada to include relations between peoples of all racial, linguistic, cultural, and gender groups.

Over the first two years of her mandate, Jean embarked on the traditional viceregal tours of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canada's provinces and territories]]. In [[British Columbia]], Jean presented the [[Grey Cup]] at the [[93rd Grey Cup|93rd Canadian Football League championship game]]; in [[Iqaluit]], [[Nunavut]], she opened the Toonik Tyme Festival, where she donated eighty books in [[Inuktitut]], French, and English to the Centennial Library in commemoration of Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday;<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jean |first=Michaëlle |date=April 17, 2006 |title=Her Excellency the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean Speech on the Occasion of the Opening Ceremony of the Toonik Tyme Festival |url=http://archive.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=4728 |publisher=Government House |access-date=April 17, 2006}}</ref> and, on May 4, 2006, she became the first governor general to address the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Alberta legislature]]. During these tours, Jean also focused strongly on the plight of female victims of violence, meeting with representatives of women's organisations, such as when, in 2007, she participated in a historic private discussion with aboriginal women chiefs and elders at [[Government House (Saskatchewan)|Saskatchewan's Government House]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070516/jean_violence_070516/20070516?hub=Canada |title=GG encourages dialogue to end domestic violence |last=Canadian Press |date=May 16, 2007 |access-date=May 16, 2007 |publisher=CTV}}</ref> In contrast to her low approval ratings prior to her appointment, crowds were large and welcoming wherever Jean went.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/manitoba/story/mb_gg20051018.html |title=Hundreds greet new Governor General |date=October 18, 2005 |access-date=October 18, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211123935/http://www.cbc.ca/manitoba/story/mb_gg20051018.html |archive-date=February 11, 2007 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> Only as her convoy arrived at the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]] for her first [[Remembrance Day#Canada|Remembrance Day]] ceremony, on November 11, 2005, were Jean and Lafond greeted with disapproval from an audience, when veterans turned their backs on the Governor General and her consort to show contempt for two people the veterans felt had worked to break up the country they had fought to defend.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051111/Remembrance_Day_051111 |title=Canadians honour war dead in solemn ceremony |date=November 11, 2005 |access-date=November 11, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124173208/http://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051111/Remembrance_Day_051111 |archive-date=November 24, 2005 |publisher=CTV}}</ref>

Jean embraced her role as acting commander-in-chief, one of her first international duties being a trip, from October 29–30, 2005, to France for the 90th anniversary of the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], just after which she returned to Canada for the arrival at [[Trenton, Ontario]], of the bodies of six Canadian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Jean made on March 8, 2007, her first visit to [[Canadian Forces|Canadian troops]] taking part in the [[Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan|offensive in Afghanistan]]; she had earlier expressed her desire to go, but Harper advised against such a trip on the grounds of security concerns, the relevance of which were demonstrated when two attacks were made against Canadian soldiers on the same day the Governor General landed in Kabul.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/03/08/gg_visits_canadian_troops.html |title=GG visits Canadian troops |last=Canadian Press |date=March 8, 2007 |work=Toronto Star |access-date=March 15, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312010554/http://www.thestar.com/News/article/189686 |archive-date=March 12, 2007}}</ref> Jean had the arrival timed specifically for [[International Women's Day]], stating: "the women of Afghanistan may face the most unbearable conditions, but they never stop fighting for survival.

==== "Loose cannon" accusation ====
There was, by early 2007, some perception that Jean's schedule was seemingly thinner than that of her predecessors; an initial explanation of fatigue was further detailed by the [[Secretary to the Governor General of Canada|Secretary to the Governor General]] as [[thyroid]] problems, and that the vicereine's doctor had advised rest after Jean's previously hectic diary.<ref name="Thyroid">{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/04/26/jean-govgeneral.html?ref=rss |title=Thyroid problem forced Governor General to miss work: office |date=April 26, 2007 |access-date=April 26, 2007 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> At the same time, some in the Ottawa Press Gallery opined that Jean had on a few occasions in the previous year overstepped the boundaries of an office that was expected to remain non-partisan; journalist [[Chantal Hébert]] said that the Governor General had "been wading uncommonly deep in political territory over the past few months", citing Jean's criticism of Quebec sovereigntists and her expressed support for [[Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan|the mission of Canadian troops]] in Afghanistan.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1159307412136&call_pageid=968256290204&col=968350116795 |title=Will Jean thwart election call?; |last=Hébert |first=Chantal |date=September 27, 2006 |work=Toronto Star |access-date=September 28, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929165425/http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar%2FLayout%2FArticle_Type1&c=Article&cid=1159307412136&call_pageid=968256290204&col=968350116795 |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |author-link=Chantal Hébert}}</ref> Further, [[Michael Valpy]] penned a piece in ''The Globe and Mail'' critiquing Jean for inviting who Valpy described as "potentially politically charged individuals" to post on her Citizen Voices website.<ref name="Valpy">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/your-biggest-problem-is-rideau-hall-top-bureaucrat-warned-harper/article683952/ |title='Your biggest problem is Rideau Hall,' top bureaucrat warned Harper |last=Valpy |first=Michael |date=April 24, 2007 |work=The Globe and Mail |access-date=November 3, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107054012/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/your-biggest-problem-is-rideau-hall-top-bureaucrat-warned-harper/article683952/ |archive-date=January 7, 2016 |author-link=Michael Valpy}}</ref> Jean had also made, at the [[Roast (comedy)|roast]]-like annual National Press Gallery dinner, satirical remarks about [[Parti Québécois]] leadership candidate [[André Boisclair]]'s admitted [[cocaine]] use and,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/governor-general-criticized-by-sister-over-boisclair-jokes-1.518973 |title=Governor General criticized by sister over Boisclair jokes |date=November 6, 2005 |access-date=November 3, 2015 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> in a September 18, 2006 interview regarding a proposed subsidy for Canadians to travel domestically, she commented that Quebecers "are sometimes very disconnected from the rest of Canada" and that their isolation affected Canada's unity.

Further, the content of a speech by Jean to mark the 25th anniversary of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] was regarded as thinly veiled criticism of her [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]]'s decision to end the [[Court Challenges Program of Canada|Court Challenges Program]] and,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/her-charter-gaffe/article1326049/ |title=Her Charter gaffe |last=Editorial |date=April 19, 2007 |work=The Globe and Mail |access-date=November 3, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107054012/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/her-charter-gaffe/article1326049/ |archive-date=January 7, 2016}}</ref> into 2007, it was reported that Jean's staff at [[Rideau Hall]] had been systematically removing royal portraits from the walls of the residence. All of this prompted Valpy to reveal that, early in his time as prime minister, [[Stephen Harper]] was told by [[Alex Himelfarb]], then the [[Clerk of the Privy Council (Canada)|Clerk of the Privy Council]]: "Prime Minister, your biggest problem is in Rideau Hall," meaning Jean and her potential to be a "loose cannon".<ref name=Valpy />

Jean carried out the regular ceremonial duties of state, such as dedicating the new [[Royal Ontario Museum#Third expansion|Michael Lee-Chin Crystal]] at the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] on June 1, 2007 (following in the footsteps of her predecessor, [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], the governor general who opened the first expansion of the museum in 1914),<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/220522 |title=Inside the ROM crystal |last=Canadian Press |date=June 1, 2007 |work=Toronto Star |access-date=February 26, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319113057/http://www.thestar.com/article/220522 |archive-date=March 19, 2009}}</ref> and undertaking a state visit to Brazil, from July 6–15, 2007.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Governor General to visit Salvador, Brasilia, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro as part of State Visit to Brazil |date=June 27, 2007 |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=12516 |access-date=November 2, 2009}}</ref>

==== Parliamentary prorogation ====
In late 2008, the Governor General had to return to Canada in the midst of a state visit in Europe to contend with [[2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute|a parliamentary dispute]], as a [[Coalition government|coalition]] of three opposition parties in [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] threatened to rescind their [[Confidence (politics)|confidence]] in the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] under the leadership of Stephen Harper and subsequently form the government.

The shell in a broken chain refers to Albert Mangonès' sculpture in [[Port-au-Prince]], ''[[Le Marron Inconnu]]'', which depicts an escaped slave blowing a sea shell to call to arms his fellow enslaved people; this symbolises Jean's ancestors' escape from slavery. The two Simbis are water spirits in [[Culture of Haiti|Haitian culture]], who, by legend, calm rough seas and give wisdom; they stand in before a rocky terrain upon which are rooted a palm tree—a Haitian symbol of peace—and a pine tree—representative of the natural riches of Canada.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=929&ProjectElementID=3456 |title=The Public Register of Arms, Flags, and Badges of Canada > Michaëlle Jean |last=Canadian Heraldic Authority |date=September 20, 2005 |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |access-date=November 3, 2015}}</ref>
