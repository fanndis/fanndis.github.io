Pironkova's style of play has drawn comparisons with such players as [[Justine Henin]].

Pironkova thought of her movement on the grass courts as her best among all the surfaces. She also ascribed the optimum ball bounce on the grass as it is "probably just perfect for [my] timing". Having been praised for her range of shots and strokeplay, Pironkova said that she developed a spontaneous approach towards her shot selection and overall game as she matured.<ref name="matt"/>
