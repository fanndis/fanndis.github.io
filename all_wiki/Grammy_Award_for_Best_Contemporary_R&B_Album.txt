The '''Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album''' was an honor presented at the [[Grammy Award]]s, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards,<ref name=Grammy>{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=January 6, 2011}}</ref> to recording artists for quality works on albums in the [[contemporary R&B]] music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position".<ref name=Overview>{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/ |title=Overview |accessdate=January 11, 2011 |publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103173212/http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/ |archivedate=January 3, 2011 }}</ref>

The award for Best Contemporary R&B Album, which recognizes [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] albums with more contemporary musical stylings, was first presented to [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]] at the [[45th Grammy Awards]] in 2003 for her [[Ashanti (album)|self-titled debut album]]. Prior to the creation of this category, contemporary R&B albums were eligible for the more general category [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Album|Best R&B Album]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/feature/the-45th-annual-grammy-awards-winner-predictions/160|title=The 45th Annual Grammy Awards: Winner Predictions |date=January 21, 2003|first=Sal|last=Cinquemani|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|accessdate=February 12, 2011}}</ref> According to the category description guide for the [[52nd Grammy Awards]], the award is reserved for albums "containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded contemporary R&B vocal tracks" which may also "incorporate production elements found in rap music".<ref name=52nd>{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/PDFs/Recording_Academy/52guide.pdf |title=52nd OEP Category Description Guide |accessdate=February 12, 2011 |page=2 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027172820/http://www.grammy.com/PDFs/Recording_Academy/52guide.pdf |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}</ref> Award recipients included the [[Record producer|producers]], [[Audio engineering|engineers]], and/or [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixers]] associated with the nominated work in addition to the recording artists.

[[Beyoncé]] holds the record for the most wins, with three (all of her first three solo albums have earned her the award). [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] is the only other artist to receive the award more than once. The award has been presented to artists from the United States each year to date. Beyoncé and [[Ne-Yo]] share the record for the most nominations, with three each. In addition, Beyoncé earned a nomination as a member of the group [[Destiny's Child]] for the album ''[[Destiny Fulfilled]]''. [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]], [[Janet Jackson]] and [[R. Kelly]] share the record for the most nominations without a win, with two each.

From 2012, this category was discontinued as part of a major overhaul of the Grammy Award categories. Recordings in this category were shifted back to the [[Best R&B Album]] category.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/category-list |title=Full Category List|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |year=2011 |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}</ref>
