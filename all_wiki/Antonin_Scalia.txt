He was described as the intellectual anchor for the [[originalist]] and [[textualist]] position in the Court's conservative wing. For catalyzing an originalist and textualist movement in American law, he has been described as one of the most influential jurists of the twentieth century,<ref name=":0" /> and one of the most important justices in the Supreme Court's history.<ref name=":1" /> Scalia was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2018, and the [[Antonin Scalia Law School]] at [[George Mason University]] was named in his honor.

Scalia was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. A devout [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], he received his undergraduate degree from [[Georgetown University]]. He then obtained his law degree from [[Harvard Law School]] and spent six years in a [[Cleveland]] law firm before becoming a law professor at the [[University of Virginia]]. In the early 1970s, he served in the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon]] and [[Presidency of Gerald Ford|Ford]] administrations, eventually becoming an [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]]. He spent most of the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter]] years teaching at the [[University of Chicago]], where he became one of the first faculty advisers of the fledgling [[Federalist Society]]. In 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] appointed Scalia as a judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]]. In 1986, he was appointed to the Supreme Court by Reagan and was unanimously confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]], becoming the Court's first [[Italian Americans|Italian-American]] justice.

Scalia espoused a conservative jurisprudence and ideology, advocating [[textualism]] in [[statutory interpretation]] and [[originalism]] in [[constitutional interpretation]]. He peppered his colleagues with "Ninograms" (memos named for his nickname, "Nino") which sought to persuade them to agree with his point of view. He was a strong defender of the powers of the executive branch. He believed that [[Constitution of the United States|the Constitution]] permitted the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]] and did not guarantee the right to [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]] or [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]. Furthermore, Scalia viewed [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] and other policies that afforded special protected status to [[minority groups]] as unconstitutional. These positions earned him a reputation as one of the most conservative justices on the Court. He filed separate opinions in many cases, often castigating the Court's majority using scathing language. Scalia's most significant opinions include his lone dissent in ''[[Morrison v. Olson]]'' (arguing against the constitutionality of an [[Independent Counsel Act|Independent-Counsel law]]), his majority opinion in ''[[Crawford v. Washington]]'' (defining a criminal defendant's [[Confrontation Clause|confrontation right]] under the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|6th Amendment]]), and his majority opinion in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' (holding that the [[2nd Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution guarantees a right to individual handgun ownership).

==Early life and education==
Antonin Scalia was born on March 11, 1936, in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], and was an only child.<ref name="maninthenews">{{Citation |last=Molotski |first=Irwin |title=The Supreme Court: Man in the News; Judge with tenacity and charm: Antonin Scalia |periodical=The New York Times |date=June 18, 1986 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/us/the-supreme-court-man-in-the-news-judge-with-tenacity-and-charm-antonin-scalia.html |access-date=January 12, 2010}}</ref> His father, Salvatore Eugene Scalia (1903–1986), an Italian immigrant from [[Sommatino]], [[Sicily]], graduated from [[Rutgers University]] and was a graduate student at [[Columbia University]] and clerk at the time of his son's birth.<ref name="rents">{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=11–15}}</ref> The elder Scalia would become a professor of [[Romance language]]s at [[Brooklyn College]], where he was an adherent to the [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] [[New Criticism]] school of literary theory.<ref>{{Citation |last=Talbot |first=Margaret |author-link=Margaret Talbot |title=Supreme confidence: The jurisprudence of Antonin Scalia |periodical=The New Yorker |date=March 28, 2005 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/03/28/supreme-confidence |access-date=February 15, 2016}}</ref> His mother, Catherine Louise ([[née]] Panaro) Scalia (1905–1985), was born in Trenton to Italian immigrant parents and worked as an elementary school teacher.<ref name="rents" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/08/us/antonin-scalia-fast-facts/ |title=Antonin Scalia Fast Facts |date=March 8, 2013 |publisher=CNN}}</ref>

In 1939, Scalia and his family moved to [[Elmhurst, Queens]], where he attended P.S.&nbsp;13 Clement&nbsp;C. Moore School.{{sfn|Murphy|2014|p=10}}<ref>{{cite news | last=Barker | first=Kim | title=In Queens, Antonin Scalia Took Pride in Melting Pot and Confrontation | website=The New York Times | date=February 14, 2016 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/15/nyregion/in-queens-antonin-scalia-took-pride-in-melting-pot-and-confrontation.html | access-date=February 15, 2016}}</ref> After completing [[eighth grade]] in public school,{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|pp=17–19}} he obtained an academic scholarship to [[Xavier High School (New York City)|Xavier High School]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] military school in [[Manhattan]],{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|p=21}} where he graduated first in the class of 1953 and served as [[valedictorian]].<ref name="washpostbio">{{Citation |last=Marcus |first=Ruth |author-link=Ruth Marcus (journalist) |title=Scalia tenacious after staking out a position |periodical=The Washington Post |date=June 22, 1986 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/22/AR2007082200970.html |access-date=January 12, 2010}}</ref> He later stated that he spent much of his time on schoolwork and admitted, "I was never cool".<ref name="sixty" /> While a youth, he was also active as a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] and was part of the Scouts' national honor society, the [[Order of the Arrow]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wendell|first1=Bryan|title=Before he served on the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia was a Boy Scout|url=http://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2016/02/16/before-he-served-on-the-supreme-court-antonin-scalia-was-a-boy-scout/|access-date=February 18, 2016|date=February 16, 2016}}</ref>

Classmate and future New York State official William Stern remembered Scalia in his high school days: "This kid was a conservative when he was 17&nbsp;years old. An archconservative Catholic. He could have been a member of the [[Roman Curia|Curia]]. He was the top student in the class. He was brilliant, way above everybody else."<ref name="maninthenews" />{{sfn|Staab|2006|pp=3}}

In 1953, Scalia enrolled at [[Georgetown College (Georgetown University)|Georgetown University]], where he graduated valedictorian and {{lang|la|[[summa cum laude]]}} in 1957 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in history. While in college, he was a champion collegiate debater in Georgetown's [[Philodemic Society]] and a critically praised thespian.{{sfn|Murphy|2014|pp=22–27}} He took his junior year abroad at the [[University of Fribourg]], Switzerland.<ref name="maninthenews" /> Scalia studied law at [[Harvard Law School]], where he was a Notes Editor for the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''.<ref name="hlrecord">{{citation |title=Scalia Speaks in Ames, Scolds Aggressive Student |newspaper=Harvard Law Record |date=December 7, 2006 |url=http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2006/12/07/News/Scalia.Speaks.In.Ames.Scolds.Aggressive.Student-2528117.shtml?sourcedomain=www.hlrecord.org&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com |access-date=January 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410232937/http://www.hlrecord.org/2.4463/scalia-speaks-in-ames-scolds-aggressive-student-1.578356 |archive-date=April 10, 2010}}</ref> He graduated {{lang|la|[[magna cum laude]]}} in 1960, becoming a Sheldon Fellow of [[Harvard University]].

==Early legal career (1961–1982)==
Scalia began his legal career at the international law firm Jones, Day, Cockley and Reavis (now [[Jones Day]]) in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], where he worked from 1961 to 1967.<ref name="hlrecord" /> He was highly regarded at the law firm and would most likely have been made a partner but later said he had long intended to teach. He became a professor of law at the [[University of Virginia School of Law]] in 1967, moving his family to [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]].<ref name="canteach">{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=37–38}}.</ref>

After four years in Charlottesville, Scalia entered public service in 1971. President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed him general counsel for the [[Office of Telecommunications Policy]], where one of his principal assignments was to formulate federal policy for the growth of cable television. From 1972 to 1974, he was chairman of the [[Administrative Conference of the United States]], a small [[independent agency]] that sought to improve the functioning of the federal bureaucracy.<ref name="pbs" /> In mid-1974, Nixon nominated him as [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] for the [[Office of Legal Counsel]].<ref name="pbs" /> After Nixon's resignation, the nomination was continued by President [[Gerald Ford]], and Scalia was confirmed by the Senate on August 22, 1974.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|p=40}}

In the aftermath of [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]], the Ford administration was engaged in a number of conflicts with Congress. Scalia repeatedly testified before congressional committees, defending Ford administration assertions of [[executive privilege]] regarding its refusal to turn over documents.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|pp=49–53}} Within the administration, Scalia advocated a presidential veto for a bill to amend the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], which would greatly increase the act's scope. Scalia's view prevailed, and Ford vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode it.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|pp=45–47}} In early 1976, Scalia argued his only case before the Supreme Court, ''Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba''. Scalia, on behalf of the US government, argued in support of Dunhill, and that position was successful.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|pp=63, 374}}
Following Ford's defeat by President [[Jimmy Carter]], Scalia worked for several months at the [[American Enterprise Institute]].{{sfn|Staab|2006|pp=13–14}}

He then returned to academia, taking up residence at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] from 1977 to 1982,<ref name="chic" /> though he spent one year as a [[visiting professor]] at [[Stanford Law School]].{{sfn|Staab|2006|p=19}} During Scalia's time at Chicago, [[Peter H. Russell]] hired him on behalf of the Canadian government to write a report on how the United States was able to limit the activities of its secret services for the [[Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP|McDonald Commission]], which was investigating abuses by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]. The report—finished in 1979—encouraged the commission to recommend that a balance be struck between civil liberties and the essentially unchecked activities of the RCMP.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/antonin-scalia-the-untold-story/article33614417/|title=The untold story of how a young Antonin Scalia's 'gift to Canada' shaped our spy services|last=Fine|first=Sean|date=January 13, 2017|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date=January 13, 2017}}</ref> In 1981, he became the first faculty adviser for the University of Chicago's chapter of the newly founded [[Federalist Society]].<ref name="chic">{{Citation |last=Shipp |first=E.

==U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (1982–1986)==
[[File:President Ronald Reagan and Judge Antonin Scalia confer in the Oval Office, July 7, 1986.jpg|right|alt=An elderly man in a beige suit is turned profile to the camera and is talking to Scalia, who has his hands folded in front of him as both men stand before an ornate desk.|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] and his Supreme Court nominee Scalia in the [[Oval Office]], July 7, 1986]]
When [[Ronald Reagan]] was elected president in November 1980, Scalia hoped for a major position in the new administration. He was interviewed for the position of [[Solicitor General of the United States]], but the position went to [[Rex E. Lee]], to Scalia's great disappointment.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|pp=73–74}} Scalia was offered a seat on the Chicago-based [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] in early 1982 but declined it, hoping to be appointed to the highly influential [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] (D.C. Circuit). Later that year, Reagan offered Scalia a seat on the D.C. Circuit, which Scalia accepted.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|p=80}} He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 5, 1982, and was sworn in on August 17, 1982.

On the D.C. Circuit, Scalia built a conservative record while winning applause in legal circles for powerful, witty legal writing, which was often critical of the Supreme Court precedents he felt bound as a lower-court judge to follow. Scalia's opinions drew the attention of Reagan administration officials, who, according to ''The New York Times'', "liked virtually everything they saw and&nbsp;... listed him as a leading Supreme Court prospect".<ref>{{Citation |last=Taylor |first=Stuart |author-link=Stuart Taylor, Jr. |title=Scalia's views, stylishly expressed, line up with Reagan's |periodical=The New York Times |date=June 19, 1986 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/us/scalia-s-views-stylishly-expressed-line-up-with-reagan-s.html |access-date=January 13, 2010 }}</ref>

==Supreme Court of the United States (1986–2016)==
In 1986, [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren Burger]] informed the White House of his intent to retire. Reagan first decided to nominate Associate Justice [[William Rehnquist]] to become Chief Justice. That choice meant that Reagan would also have to choose a nominee to fill Rehnquist's seat as associate justice.<ref name="nosmoke" /> Attorney General [[Edwin Meese]], who advised Reagan on the choice, seriously considered only Scalia and [[Robert Bork]], a fellow judge on the DC Court of Appeals.{{sfn|Toobin|2008|p=21}} Feeling that this might well be Reagan's last opportunity to pick a Supreme Court justice, the president and his advisers chose Scalia over Bork. Many factors influenced the decision. Reagan wanted to appoint the first Italian-American justice.<ref>{{citation |last=Wallison |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Wallison |contribution=Of loyalty, leaks, and the White House staff |editor-last=Wallison |editor-first=Peter |editor-link=Peter Wallison |title=Ronald Reagan: the power of conviction and the success of his Presidency |publisher=Basic Books |year=2004 |page=151 |isbn=9780813390475 |postscript=.}}</ref> In addition, Scalia was ten years younger and would likely serve longer on the Court.<ref name="nosmoke" /> Scalia also had the advantage of not having Bork's "paper trail";{{sfn|Staab|2006|p=24}} the elder judge had written controversial articles about individual rights.<ref>{{Citation |last=Biskupic |first=Joan |title=Timing and luck crucial for seat on high court |periodical=USA Today |date=December 22, 2008 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/2008-12-22-court_N.htm |access-date=February 9, 2010}}</ref> Scalia was called to the White House and accepted Reagan's nomination.<ref name="nosmoke">{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=104–09}}. Bork was nominated for the Supreme Court the following year, but his nomination was rejected by the Senate.</ref>

When [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] hearings on Scalia's nomination opened in August 1986, he faced a committee that had just argued divisively over the Rehnquist nomination. Witnesses and Democratic senators contended that before becoming a judge, Rehnquist had engaged in activities designed to discourage minorities from voting. Committee members had little taste for a second battle over Scalia and were in any event reluctant to oppose the first Italian-American Supreme Court nominee.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|pp=100, 109–10}} The judge was not pressed heavily on controversial issues such as abortion or civil rights.<ref>{{Citation |title=Scalia hearings muted |periodical=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] |date=August 5, 1986 <!--|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19860806&id=dF0aAAAAIBAJ&pg=6785,3534231 |access-date=August 9, 2016-->}}</ref> Scalia, who attended the hearing with his wife and nine children seated behind him, found time for a humorous exchange with Democratic Ohio Senator [[Howard Metzenbaum]], whom he had defeated in a tennis match in, as the nominee put it, "a case of my integrity overcoming my judgment".{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|p=109}}

Scalia met no opposition from the committee. The full Senate debated Scalia's nomination only briefly, confirming him 98–0 on September 17, 1986 and thereby making him the first Italian-American Justice. That vote followed Rehnquist's confirmation as Chief Justice by a vote of 65–33 on the same day. Scalia took his seat on September 26, 1986. One committee member, Democratic Delaware Senator [[Joe Biden]], later stated that he regretted not having opposed Scalia "because he was so effective".{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|p=121}}

===Governmental structure and powers===

====Separation of powers====

[[File:Justice Antonin Scalia on Separation of Powers and Checks and Balances.webm|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice Antonin Scalia testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] about [[separation of powers]] and checks and balances of the U.S. Government]]

It was Scalia's view that clear lines of separation among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches follow directly from the Constitution, with no branch allowed to exercise powers granted to another branch.{{sfn|Ring|2004|pp=44–45}} In his early days on the Court, he authored a powerful<!-- word used by source -->—and solitary—dissent in 1988's ''[[Morrison v. Olson]]'', in which the Court's majority upheld the [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Independent Counsel law]]. Scalia's thirty-page draft dissent surprised Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] for its emotional content; Blackmun felt "it could be cut down to ten pages if Scalia omitted the screaming".<ref name="wolf">{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=136–38}}.</ref> Scalia indicated that the law was an unwarranted encroachment on the executive branch by the legislative. He warned, "Frequently an issue of this sort will come before the Court clad, so to speak, in sheep's clothing&nbsp;... But this wolf comes as a wolf".<ref name="wolf" />

The 1989 case of ''[[Mistretta v. United States]]'' challenged the [[United States Sentencing Commission]], an independent body within the judicial branch whose members (some of whom were federal judges) were removable only for good cause. The petitioner argued that the arrangement violated separation of powers and that the [[United States Sentencing Guidelines]] promulgated by the Commission were invalid. Eight justices joined in the majority opinion written by Blackmun, upholding the Guidelines as constitutional.{{sfn|Staab|2006|pp=74–75}} Scalia dissented, stating that the issuance of the Guidelines was a lawmaking function that Congress could not delegate{{sfn|Staab|2006|p=76}} and dubbed the Commission "a sort of junior-varsity Congress".<ref name="wolf" />

In 1996, Congress passed the [[Line Item Veto Act]], which allowed the president to cancel items from an [[appropriations bill]] (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law. The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the [[Presentment Clause]] of the Constitution, which governs what the president is permitted to do with a bill once it has passed both houses of Congress.{{sfn|Staab|2006|pp=78–79}} Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate separation of powers. He argued that authorizing the president to cancel an appropriation was no different from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.{{sfn|Staab|2006|pp=80–82}}

====Detainee cases====
[[File:Obamacourt.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=Nine judges in black robes pose for a photograph with three other men in suits.|The 2009–2010 Court, with President [[Barack Obama]], Vice President [[Joe Biden]] and retiring justice [[David Souter]] with Scalia fourth from right]]
In 2004, in ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'', the Court held that federal courts had [[subject-matter jurisdiction|jurisdiction]] to hear ''[[habeas corpus]]'' petitions brought by detainees at the [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]]. Scalia accused the majority of "spring<nowiki>[ing]</nowiki> a trap on the Executive" by ruling that it could hear cases involving persons at Guantanamo when no federal court had ever ruled that it had the authority to hear cases involving people there.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|pp=328–29}}

Scalia (joined by Justice [[John Paul Stevens]]) also dissented in the 2004 case of ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'', involving [[Yaser Hamdi]], an American citizen detained in the United States on the allegation he was an [[enemy combatant]]. The Court held that although Congress had authorized Hamdi's detention, Fifth Amendment due process guarantees give a citizen held in the United States as an enemy combatant [Hamdi] the right to contest that detention before a neutral decision maker. Scalia opined that the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|AUMF]] (Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists) could not be read to suspend ''habeas corpus'' and that the Court, faced with legislation by Congress that did not grant the president power to detain Hamdi, was trying to "Make Everything Come Out Right".<!-- caps in original -->{{sfn|Rossum|2006|pp=84–85}}

In March 2006, Scalia gave a talk at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. When asked about detainee rights, he responded: "Give me a break&nbsp;... I had a son on that battlefield and they were shooting at my son, and I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy".<ref name="bbc">{{Citation |title=Judge 'rejects Guantanamo rights' |work=BBC News |date=March 27, 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4848834.stm |access-date=January 29, 2010}}</ref> Although Scalia was not referring to any particular individual, the Supreme Court was about to consider the case of [[Salim Ahmed Hamdan]], supposed driver to [[Osama bin Laden]], who was challenging the [[Guantanamo military commission|military commissions]] at Guantanamo Bay.<ref name="bbc" /> A group of retired military officers that supported Hamdan's position asked Scalia to [[recusal|recuse]] himself, or step aside from hearing the case, which he declined to do.<ref>{{Citation |title=U.S. justices cast doubt on tribunal |periodical=The New York Times |date=March 28, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/28/world/americas/28iht-scotus.html |access-date=January 27, 2010 }}</ref> The Court held 5–3 in ''[[Hamdan v.

====Federalism====
In [[federalism]] cases pitting the powers of the federal government against those of the states, Scalia often took the states' positions. In 1997, the Supreme Court considered the case of ''[[Printz v. United States]]'', a challenge to certain provisions of the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]], which required chief law enforcement officers of localities in states to perform certain duties. In ''Printz'', Scalia wrote the Court's majority decision. The Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the provision that imposed those duties as violating the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]], which reserves to the states and to the people those powers not granted to the federal government.{{sfn|Rossum|2006|pp=61–63}} In 2005, Scalia concurred in ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'', which read the [[Commerce Clause]] to hold that Congress could ban the use of [[marijuana]] even when states approve its use for [[medical marijuana|medicinal purposes]]. Scalia opined that the Commerce Clause, together with the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]], permitted the regulation. In addition, Scalia felt that Congress may regulate intrastate activities if doing so is a necessary part of a more general regulation of interstate commerce.<ref>{{citation |url=http://balkin.blogspot.com/2010/12/criticism-of-judge-hudsons-opinion.html |title=''Virginia v.

Scalia rejected the existence of the [[Dormant Commerce Clause|negative Commerce Clause]] doctrine,<ref>{{citation |last=Dorf |first=Michael |title=Is the Dormant Commerce Clause a 'Judicial Fraud'? |url=https://verdict.justia.com/2015/05/20/is-the-dormant-commerce-clause-a-judicial-fraud |publisher=Justia |date=May 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Richard D. |title=Putting the Dormancy Doctrine out of its misery |journal=[[Benjamin N.

Scalia took a broad view of the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]], which bars certain lawsuits against states in the federal courts. In his 1989 dissent in ''[[Pennsylvania]] v. [[Union Gas]] Co.'', Scalia stated that there was no intent on the part of the framers to have the states surrender any [[sovereign immunity]] and that the case that provoked the Eleventh Amendment, ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'', came as a surprise to them. Professor Ralph Rossum, who wrote a survey of Scalia's constitutional views, suggests that the justice's view of the Eleventh Amendment was actually contradictory to the language of the Amendment.{{sfn|Rossum|2006|pp=110–12}}

===Individual rights===

====Abortion====
Scalia argued that there is no constitutional right to abortion and that if the people desire legalized abortion, a law should be passed to accomplish it.<ref name="sixty" /> In his dissenting opinion in the 1992 case of ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', Scalia wrote the following:
{{quote|
The States may, if they wish, permit abortion on demand, but the Constitution does not require them to do so. The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting.<ref>{{Citation |title=Planned Parenthood v. Casey, ''505 U.S. 833, 979 (Scalia, J., dissenting)'' |publisher=United States Supreme Court |via=FindLaw |date=June 29, 1992 |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=505&invol=833 |access-date=January 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107184430/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=505&invol=833 |archive-date=January 7, 2010  |url-status=live}}</ref>
}}

Scalia repeatedly called upon his colleagues to strike down ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. Scalia hoped to find five votes to strike down ''Roe'' in the 1989 case of ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'' but was not successful in doing so. Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] authored the decision of the Court, allowing the abortion regulations at issue in the case to stand but not overriding ''Roe''. Scalia concurred only in part.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|pp=193–95}} Scalia wrote, "Justice O'Connor's assertion, that a 'fundamental rule of judicial restraint' requires us to avoid reconsidering ''Roe'' cannot be taken seriously".{{sfn|Ring|2004|p=108}} He noted, "We can now look forward to at least another Term of carts full of mail from the public, and the streets full of demonstrators".{{sfn|Ring|2004|p=109}}

The Court returned to the issue of abortion in the 2000 case of ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', in which it invalidated a Nebraska statute outlawing [[partial-birth abortion]]. Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] wrote for the Court that the law was unconstitutional because it did not allow an exception for the health of the woman. Scalia dissented, comparing the ''Stenberg'' case to two of the most reviled cases in Supreme Court history: "I am optimistic enough to believe that, one day, ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' will be assigned its rightful place in the history of this Court's jurisprudence beside ''[[Korematsu v. United States|Korematsu]]'' and ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott]]''. The method of killing a human child&nbsp;... proscribed by this statute is so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shudder of revulsion".{{sfn|Ring|2004|pp=137–38}}

In 2007, the Court upheld a federal statute banning partial-birth abortion in ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|pp=202–03}} University of Chicago law professor [[Geoffrey R. Stone]], a former colleague of Scalia's, criticized ''Gonzales'', stating that religion had influenced the outcome because all five justices in the majority were Catholic, whereas the dissenters were Protestant or Jewish.<ref>{{citation |author-link=Geoffrey Stone |last=Stone |first=Geoffrey |date=April 20, 2007 |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/geoffrey-r-stone/our-faithbased-justices_b_46398.html |title=Our Faith-Based Justices |work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}</ref> This angered Scalia to such an extent that he stated he would not speak at the University of Chicago as long as Stone was there.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|pp=203–04}}

====Race, gender, and sexual orientation====
Scalia generally voted to strike down laws that make distinctions by race, gender, or sexual orientation. In 1989, he concurred with the Court's judgment in ''[[City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.]]'', in which the Court applied [[strict scrutiny]] to a city program requiring a certain percentage of contracts to go to minorities, and struck down the program. Scalia did not join the majority opinion, however. He disagreed with O'Connor's opinion, for the Court, that states and localities could institute race-based programs if they identified past discrimination and if the programs were designed to remedy the past racism.{{sfn|Ring|2004|pp=87–88}} Five years later, in ''[[Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña]]'', he concurred in the Court's judgment and in part with the opinion that extended strict scrutiny to federal programs. Scalia noted in that matter his view that government can never have a compelling interest in making up for past discrimination by racial preferences,
{{quote|
To pursue the concept of racial entitlement—even for the most admirable and benign of purposes—is to reinforce and preserve for future mischief the way of thinking that produced race slavery, race privilege and race hatred. In the eyes of government, we are just one race here. It is American.{{sfn|Ring|2004|pp=56–57}}
}}
In the 2003 case of ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', involving racial preferences in the [[University of Michigan|University of Michigan's]] law school, Scalia mocked<!-- so says the source --> the Court majority's finding that the school was entitled to continue using race as a factor in admissions to promote diversity and to increase "cross-racial understanding". Scalia noted,
{{quote|This is not, of course, an "educational benefit" on which students will be graded on their Law School transcript (Works and Plays Well with Others: B+) or tested by the bar examiners (Q: Describe in 500 words or less your cross-racial understanding). For it is a lesson of life rather than law—essentially the same lesson taught to (or rather learned by, for it cannot be "taught" in the usual sense) people three feet shorter and twenty years younger than the full-grown adults at the University of Michigan Law School, in institutions ranging from Boy Scout troops to public-school kindergartens.{{sfn|Rossum|2006|pp=159–60}}}}

Scalia argued that laws that make distinctions between genders should be subjected to [[intermediate scrutiny]], requiring that the gender classification be substantially related to important government objectives.{{sfn|Ring|2004|p=194}} When, in 1996, the Court upheld a suit brought by a woman who wished to enter the [[Virginia Military Institute]] in the case of ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', Scalia filed a lone, lengthy dissent. Scalia said that the Court, in requiring Virginia to show an "extremely persuasive justification" for the single-sex admission policy, had redefined intermediate scrutiny in such a way "that makes it indistinguishable from strict scrutiny".{{sfn|Ring|2004|p=195}}

In one of the final decisions of the Burger Court, the Court ruled in 1986 in ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' that "homosexual sodomy"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0478_0186_ZO.html |title=Bowers v. Hardwick |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |access-date=September 25, 2016}}</ref> was not protected by the [[right of privacy]] and could be criminally prosecuted by the states.{{sfn|Ring|2004|pp=279–80}} In 1995, however, that ruling was effectively gutted by ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', which struck down a Colorado state constitutional amendment, passed by popular vote, that forbade antidiscrimination laws' being extended to sexual orientation.<ref name="as">{{Harvnb|Tushnet|2005|pp=167–69}}.</ref> Scalia dissented from the opinion by Justice Kennedy, believing that ''Bowers'' had protected the right of the states to pass such measures and that the Colorado amendment was not discriminatory but merely prevented homosexuals from gaining favored status under Colorado law.{{sfn|Ring|2004|pp=280–81}} Scalia later said of ''Romer'', "And the Supreme Court said, 'Yes, it is unconstitutional.' On the basis of—I don't know, the Sexual Preference Clause of the Bill of Rights, presumably. And the liberals loved it, and the conservatives gnashed their teeth".{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|p=283. There is no such clause in the Bill of Rights}}

In 2003, ''Bowers'' was formally overruled by ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', from which Scalia dissented. According to [[Mark V. Tushnet]] in his survey of the Rehnquist Court, during the oral argument in the case, Scalia seemed so intent on making the state's argument for it that the Chief Justice intervened.{{sfn|Tushnet|2005|pp=170–72}} According to his biographer, [[Joan Biskupic]], Scalia "ridiculed" the majority in his dissent for being so ready to cast aside ''Bowers'' when many of the same justices had refused to overturn ''Roe'' in ''[[Planned Parenthood]] v. Casey''.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|pp=225–27}} In March 2009, openly gay Congressman [[Barney Frank]] described him as a "homophobe".<ref>{{Citation |title=''"Rep.

In the 2013 case of ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'', which involved a California ballot initiative known as [[Proposition 8]] that amended the California State Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, Scalia voted with the majority to uphold a lower court decision overturning the ban. The decision was based on the appellants' lack of standing to appeal and not on the substantive issue of the constitutionality of Proposition 8.<ref name="slip-opinion">{{cite web | url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-144_8ok0.pdf | title = Hollingsworth v.

Also in 2013, Scalia dissented from the majority opinion in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]''. In ''Windsor'', the Court held Section Three of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) (which--for federal government purposes--defined the terms "marriage" and "spouse" as applicable only to opposite-sex unions) unconstitutional under the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].<ref name="Opinion">''United States v. Windsor'', {{ussc|570||June 26, 2013|docket=12-307}}.

{{quote|This case is about power in several respects. It is about the power of our people to govern themselves, and the power of this Court to pronounce the law. Today's opinion aggrandizes the latter, with the predictable consequence of diminishing the former. We have no power to decide this case. And even if we did, we have no power under the Constitution to invalidate this democratically adopted legislation.}} 

Scalia argued that the judgment effectively characterized opponents of same-sex marriage as "enemies of the human race":<ref>{{cite news|title=Scalia: 'High-Handed' Kennedy Has Declared Us 'Enemies of the Human Race'|author=Tim Grieve |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/domesticpolicy/scalia-high-handed-kennedy-has-declared-us-enemies-of-the-human-race-20130626 |newspaper=National Journal|date=June 26, 2013|access-date=June 26, 2013}}<br/>{{cite magazine|title=Scalia's Blistering Dissent on DOMA|author=Tim Grieve|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/06/scalias-blistering-dissent-on-doma/277245/#comments|magazine=The Atlantic|date=June 26, 2013|access-date=June 26, 2013}}</ref> He argued that the Court's ruling would affect [[Same-sex marriage law in the United States by state|state bans on same-sex marriage]] as well:

Scalia concluded by saying that the Supreme Court "has cheated both sides, robbing the winners of an honest victory, and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair defeat."<ref name="Opinion"/>

In 2015, Scalia dissented from the majority opinion in ''Obergefell v. Hodges'', in which the Court ruled that the fundamental right to marry was guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In his dissent, Scalia stated that the Court's decision effectively robbed the people of "the freedom to govern themselves", noting that a rigorous debate on same-sex marriage had been taking place and that—by deciding the issue nationwide—the democratic process had been halted.<ref>''Obergefell v. Hodges'', No. 14-556, [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 2 (U.S. June 26, 2015) (Scalia, J., dissenting).</ref> Addressing the claimed [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] violation, Scalia asserted that because a same-sex marriage ban would not have been considered unconstitutional at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption, such bans are not unconstitutional in 2015.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 4 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</ref> He claimed there was "no basis" for the Court to strike down legislation that the Fourteenth Amendment did not expressly forbid, and directly attacked the majority opinion for "lacking even a thin veneer of law".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Lastly, Scalia faulted the actual writing in the opinion for "diminish[ing] this Court's reputation for clear thinking and sober analysis" and for "descend[ing] from the disciplined legal reasoning of [[John Marshall]] and [[Joseph Story]] to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie."<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 9, 8 n.22 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</ref>

Scalia believed the [[capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]] to be constitutional.{{sfn|Ring|2004|p=144}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brisbin|first1=Richard|title=Justice Antonin Scalia and the Conservative Revival|date=1998|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801860942|pages=488|url=https://archive.org/details/justiceantoninsc00rich|url-access=registration}}</ref> He dissented in decisions that hold the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to certain groups, such as those who were under the age of 18 at the time of offense. In ''[[Thompson v. Oklahoma]]'' (1988), he dissented from the Court's ruling that the death penalty could not be applied to those aged 15 at the time of the offense, and the following year authored the Court's opinion in ''[[Stanford v. Kentucky]]'', sustaining the death penalty for those who killed at age 16. However, in 2005, the Court overturned ''Stanford'' in ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'', and Scalia again dissented, mocking the majority's claims that a national consensus had emerged against the execution of those who killed while [[underage]], noting that less than half of the states that permitted the death penalty prohibited it for underage killers. He castigated the majority for including in their count states that had abolished the death penalty entirely, stating that doing so was "rather like including old-order Amishmen in a consumer-preference poll on the electric car. Of course they don't like it, but that sheds no light whatever on the point at issue".{{sfn|Rossum|2006|pp=192–93}} In 2002, in ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'', the Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to the mentally retarded. Scalia dissented, stating that it would not have been considered cruel or unusual to execute the mildly mentally retarded at the time of the 1791 adoption of the Bill of Rights and that the Court had failed to show that a national consensus had formed against the practice.{{sfn|Ring|2004|p=148}}

Scalia strongly disfavored the Court's ruling in ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', which held that a confession by an arrested suspect who had not been [[Miranda warnings|advised of his rights]] was inadmissible in court, and he voted to overrule ''Miranda'' in the 2000 case of ''[[Dickerson v. United States]]'' but was in a minority of two with Justice [[Clarence Thomas]]. Calling the ''Miranda'' decision a "milestone of judicial overreaching", Scalia stated that the Court should not fear to correct its mistakes.{{sfn|Toobin|2008|p=146}}

Although, in many areas, Scalia's approach was unfavorable to criminal defendants, he took the side of defendants in matters involving the [[Confrontation Clause]] of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]], which guarantees defendants the right to confront their accusers. In multiple cases, Scalia wrote against laws that allowed alleged victims of child abuse to testify behind screens or by closed-circuit television.{{sfn|Rossum|2006|pp=182–84}} In a 2009 case, Scalia wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts]]'', holding that defendants must have the opportunity to confront lab technicians in drug cases and that a certificate of analysis is not enough to prove a substance was a drug.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|p=354}}

Scalia maintained that every [[Element (criminal law)|element]] of an offense that helps determine the sentence must be either admitted by the defendant or found by a jury under the Sixth Amendment's jury guarantee. In the 2000 case of ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'', Scalia wrote the Court's majority opinion that struck down a state statute that allowed the trial judge to increase the sentence if the judge found the offense was a [[hate crime]]. Scalia found the procedure impermissible because whether it was a hate crime had not been decided by the jury.<ref name="coy" /> In 2004, he wrote for the Court in ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'', striking down Washington state's sentencing guidelines on similar grounds. The dissenters in ''Blakely'' foresaw that Scalia would use the case to attack the federal sentencing guidelines (which he had failed to strike down in ''Mistretta''), and they proved correct, as Scalia led a five-member majority in ''[[United States v. Booker]]'', which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for federal judges to follow (they remained advisory).<ref name="coy">{{Harvnb|Rossum|2006|pp=184–86}}.</ref>

In the 2001 case of ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'', Scalia wrote the Court's opinion in a 5–4 decision that cut across ideological lines.<ref>Scalia was joined by Justices Thomas, Souter, Breyer, and Ginsburg.</ref> That decision found thermal imaging of a home to be an unreasonable search under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. The Court struck down a conviction for marijuana manufacture based on a search warrant issued after such scans were conducted, which showed that the garage was considerably hotter than the rest of the house because of indoor growing lights.<ref>{{Citation |title=''Kyllo v. United States'', 533 U.S. 27 |publisher=United States Supreme Court |via=FindLaw |date=June 11, 2001 |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=533&invol=27 |access-date=January 24, 2010}}</ref> Applying that Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure to arrest, Scalia dissented from the Court's 1991 decision in ''[[County of Riverside v. McLaughlin]]'', allowing a 48-hour delay before a person arrested without a warrant is taken before a magistrate, on the ground that at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, an arrested person was to be taken before a magistrate as quickly as practicable.{{sfn|Rossum|2006|p=175}} In a 1990 [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] case, ''[[R.A.V. v. St. Paul]]'', Scalia wrote the Court's opinion striking down a [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], [[hate speech]] ordinance in a prosecution for burning a cross.{{sfn|Tushnet|2005|pp=140–42}} Scalia noted, "Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding the First Amendment to the fire".{{sfn|Rossum|2006|p=2}}

====Second Amendment====
In 2008, the Court considered a challenge to the gun laws in the [[District of Columbia]]. Scalia wrote the majority opinion in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'', which found an individual right to own a firearm under the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]]. Scalia traced the word "militia", found in the Second Amendment, as it would have been understood at the time of its ratification, stating that it then meant "the body of all citizens".<ref name="second" /> The Court upheld Heller's claim to own a firearm in the District.<ref name="second" />

Scalia's opinion for the ''Heller'' Court was criticized by liberals and applauded by conservatives.<ref name="second2">{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=347–51}}.</ref> Seventh Circuit Judge [[Richard Posner]] disagreed with Scalia's opinion, stating that the Second Amendment "creates no right to the private possession of guns". Posner called Scalia's opinion "faux originalism" and a "historicizing glaze on personal values and policy preferences".<ref>{{Citation |last=Posner |first=Richard |title=In defense of looseness |journal=The New Republic |date=August 27, 2008 |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/62124/defense-looseness |access-date=February 13, 2014}}</ref> In October 2008, Scalia stated that the court's originalists needed to show only that at the time the Second Amendment was ratified, the right to bear arms did not have an exclusively military context and that they were successful in so showing.<ref>{{Citation |last=McArdle |first=Elaine |title=In inaugural Vaughan Lecture, Scalia defends the "methodology of originalism" |publisher=Harvard Law School |date=October 3, 2008 |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/spotlight/constitutional-law/scalia-vaughan-lecture.html |access-date=January 14, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129043832/http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/spotlight/constitutional-law/scalia-vaughan-lecture.html |archive-date=January 29, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

====Litigation and standing====
Following the death of Scalia, Paul Barrett, writing for Bloomberg Businessweek, reported that: "Translating into liberal argot: Scalia changed the rules for who could sue". The issue elevated the recognition of Scalia as a notable influence on establishing and determining the conditions under which cases could be brought to trial and for litigation—and by whom such litigation could take place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-16/how-scalia-kept-the-little-guys-out-of-court|title=How Scalia Kept the Little Guys Out of Court|date=February 16, 2016|via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref> David Rivkin, from the conservative standpoint, said, "He (Scalia) did more to clarify and limit the bounds and scope of judicial power than any Supreme Court Justice in history, particularly in the area of standing and class actions". Scalia indicated his long-held position from the time of his 1983 law review article titled "The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential Element of the Separation of Powers". As summarized by Barrett, "He (Scalia) wrote that courts had misappropriated authority from other branches of government by allowing too many people to sue corporations and government agencies, especially in environmental cases". In a practical sense, Scalia brought to the attention of the Court the authority to restrict "standing" in class action suits in which the litigants may be defined in descriptive terms rather than as well-defined and unambiguous litigants.<ref>Paul Barrett, "Justice for the Big Guys," ''Bloomberg News Weekly'', Feb 15, 2016, p. 13.</ref>

===Other cases===
Scalia concurred in the 1990 case of ''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]'', in which the family of [[Nancy Cruzan|a woman]] in a [[vegetative state]] sought to have her feeding tube removed so she would die, believing that to have been her wish. The Court found for the State of Missouri, requiring [[clear and convincing evidence]] of such a desire. Scalia stated that the Court should have remained away from the dispute and that the issues "are <nowiki>[not]</nowiki> better known to the nine Justices of this Court any better than they are known to nine people picked at random from the Kansas City telephone directory".<ref name="second">{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=135–36}}.</ref>

Scalia joined the majority ''[[per curiam]]'' opinion in the 2000 case of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', which effectively ended recounts of ballots in Florida following the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 US Presidential election]], and also both concurred separately and joined Rehnquist's concurrence.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|p=243}} In 2007, he said of the case, "I and my court owe no apology whatever for ''Bush v. Gore''. We did the right thing. So there!&nbsp;... get over it. It's so old by now".<ref>{{Citation|title=Justice Scalia on the record |publisher=CBS News |date=September 14, 2007 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/04/24/60minutes/main4040290_page3.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody |access-date=January 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205194142/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/04/24/60minutes/main4040290_page3.shtml?tag=contentMain%3BcontentBody |archive-date=February 5, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> During an interview on the [[Charlie Rose (talk show)|''Charlie Rose'' show]], he defended the Court's action:
{{quote|
The decision was not close, it was 7–2 on the principal issue of whether there had been a constitutional violation&nbsp;... But what if it was unconstitutional to have that recount? You're going to let it continue and come to a conclusion? And ''then'' overturn it? The reason to stop it sooner was not, "Ooh, we're worried that it's going to come out the wrong way"...&nbsp; you forget what was going on at the time. We were the laughingstock of the world. The world's greatest democracy that couldn't conduct an election. We didn't know who our next president was going to be. The lengthy transition that has become standard when you change from one president to another could not begin because you didn't know who the new president was going to be. It was becoming a very serious problem. The issue before the United States Supreme Court is: having decided the case, having decided this is unconstitutional, should we nonetheless let the election go on? Or is it time cut it off and let's move on?<ref>{{Citation |title=A Conversation with Justice Antonin Scalia |work=Charlie Rose |date=June 20, 2008 |url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/9141 |access-date=January 31, 2010 |format=video |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705104255/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/9141 |archive-date=July 5, 2009}}</ref>

==Legal philosophy and approach==
===Judicial performance===
During oral argument before the court, Scalia asked more questions and made more comments than any other justice.<ref name="auf">{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=304–05}}.</ref> A 2005 study found that he provoked laughter more often than any of his colleagues did.<ref>{{Citation |last=Liptak |first=Adam |author-link=Adam Liptak |title=So, guy walks up to a bar and Scalia says&nbsp;... |periodical=The New York Times |date=December 31, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/31/politics/31mirth.html |access-date=January 30, 2010}}</ref> His goal during oral arguments was to get across his position to the other justices.<ref name="oral">{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|pp=307–08}}.</ref>
[[University of Kansas]] social psychologist Lawrence Wrightsman wrote that Scalia communicated "a sense of urgency on the bench" and had a style that was "forever forceful".<ref name="auf" /> After Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] joined the Court in 2005, he took to quizzing lawyers in a manner similar to Scalia's; sometimes the two questioned counsel in seeming coordination.<ref name="oral" /> [[Dahlia Lithwick]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' described Scalia's technique as follows:
{{quote|
Scalia doesn't come into oral argument all secretive and sphinxlike, feigning indecision on the nuances of the case before him. He comes in like a medieval knight, girded for battle. He knows what the law is. He knows what the opinion should say. And he uses the hour allocated for argument to bludgeon his brethren into agreement.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lithwick |first=Dahlia |author-link=Dahlia Lithwick |title=Scalia hogs the ball |periodical=Slate |date=January 15, 2003 |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2077031/ |access-date=September 8, 2011}}</ref>
}}

Scalia wrote numerous opinions from the start of his career on the Supreme Court. During his tenure, he wrote more [[concurring opinion]]s than any other justice. Only two justices have written more [[dissenting opinion|dissents]].<ref name="frosh">{{Harvnb|Staab|2006|p=27}}.</ref> According to Kevin Ring, who compiled a book of Scalia's dissenting and concurring opinions: "His opinions are&nbsp;... highly readable. His entertaining writing style can make even the most mundane areas of the law interesting".{{sfn|Ring|2004|p=xi}} Conor Clarke of ''Slate'' comments on Scalia's written opinions, especially his dissents:

{{quote|
His writing style is best described as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.<ref>{{Citation |last=Clarke |first=Conor |title=How Scalia lost his mojo |periodical=Slate |date=July 5, 2006 |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2145069/ |access-date=January 30, 2010}}</ref>
}}

At the Supreme Court, justices meet after the case is briefed and argued and vote on the result. The task of writing the opinion is assigned by the Chief Justice or—if the Chief Justice is in the minority or is not participating—by the senior justice in the majority. After the assignment, the justices generally communicate about a case by sending notes and draft opinions to each other's chambers.{{sfn|Tushnet|2005|pp=64–65}} In the give-and-take of opinion-writing, Scalia did not compromise his views in order to attract five votes for a majority (unlike the late Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]], who would accept less than what he wanted in order to gain a partial victory).{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|p=132}} Scalia attempted to influence his colleagues by sending them "Ninograms"—short memoranda aimed at persuading them of the correctness of his views.<ref name="frosh" /><ref name="Ward">{{Cite journal |last=Ward |first=Artemus |title=Book review: ''The Political Thought of Justice Antonin Scalia: A Hamiltonian of the Supreme Court'' by James B.

In an October 2013 issue of ''New York'' magazine, Scalia revealed that he scanned ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[The Washington Times]],'' obtained most of his news from talk radio, and did not read ''[[The New York Times]]'' or ''[[The Washington Post]].'' He described ''The Washington Post'' as "''shrilly'' liberal".<ref name = "senior">{{citation |last=Senior |first=Jennifer |url=https://nymag.com/news/features/antonin-scalia-2013-10/index3.html |title=In conversation: Antonin Scalia |periodical=New York |date=October 14, 2013 |page=26}}</ref>

===Statutory and constitutional interpretation===
[[File:Rhenswear.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An elderly white haired man in judicial robes swears in a middle-aged man in a suit as several people look on.|Judge and Mrs. Scalia (left) and President Reagan (right) watch as Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] swears [[William Rehnquist]] in as the next Chief Justice, September 26, 1986.]]

Scalia was a [[textualism|textualist]] in [[statutory interpretation]], believing that the ordinary meaning of a statute should govern.<ref>{{Citation |last=Rossum |first=Ralph |title=The textualist jurisprudence of Justice Scalia |publisher=Claremont McKenna College |url=http://www.claremontmckenna.edu/salvatori/publications/RARScalia.asp |access-date=January 14, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125150847/http://www.claremontmckenna.edu/salvatori/publications/RARScalia.asp |archive-date=January 25, 2010}}</ref>
In 1998, Scalia vociferously opposed the idea of a [[living constitution]], or the power of the judiciary to modify the meaning of constitutional provisions to adapt them to changing times.<ref name="sixty" /> Scalia warned that if one accepted that constitutional standards should evolve with a maturing society, "the risk of assessing evolving standards is that it is all too easy to believe that evolution has culminated in one's own views".<ref>{{Citation |title=''Thompson v. Oklahoma'', 487 U.S. 815, 865 (Scalia, J., dissenting) |publisher=United States Supreme Court |via=[[FindLaw]] |date=June 29, 1988 |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=487&page=815 |access-date=January 13, 2010}}</ref> He compared the Constitution to statutes he contended were not understood to change their meaning through time.<ref name="hlrecord" />
Constitutional amendments, such as the 1868 [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], according to Scalia, were to be interpreted based on their meaning at the time of ratification.<ref>{{Citation |last=Greenhouse |first=Linda |author-link=Linda Greenhouse |title=Washington talk: High Court still groping to define due process |periodical=The New York Times |date=May 31, 1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/31/us/washington-talk-high-court-still-groping-to-define-due-process.html |access-date=February 12, 2010}}</ref> Scalia was often asked how that approach justified the result in the 1954 case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', which held that segregated schools were unconstitutional and which relied on the Fourteenth Amendment for the result.<ref>{{Citation |last=Talbot |first=Margaret |author-link=Margaret Talbot |title=Supreme confidence: The jurisprudence of Antonin Scalia |periodical=The New Yorker |date=March 28, 2005 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/03/28/supreme-confidence |access-date=February 12, 2010}}</ref> Scalia responded to this argument in two ways. He noted research by Michael McConell that "persuasively establishes that this was the original understanding of the post Civil War Amendments." However, Scalia continues by arguing that even if non-originalist methods occasionally produce better results than Originalism, "It is in no way remarkable... that taking power from the people and placing it instead with a judicial aristocracy can produce some creditable results that democracy might not achieve. The same can be said of monarchy and totalitarianism. But once a nation has decided that democracy... is the best system of government, the crucial question becomes which theory of textual interpretation is compatible with democracy. Originalism unquestionably is. Non-originalism, by contrast, imposes on society statutory prescriptions that were never democratically adopted. When applied to the Constitution, nonoriginalism limits the democratic process itself, prohibiting... acts... that 'We The People' never, ever, voted to outlaw.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Law-Interpretation-Legal-Texts/dp/031427555X Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts]  pp. 87–88</ref>

In interpreting statutes, Scalia did not look to [[legislative history]]. In the 2006 case of ''[[Zedner v. United States]]'', he joined the majority opinion written by Justice [[Samuel Alito]]—all except one paragraph of the opinion, in which Alito cited legislative history. In a concurring opinion in that case, Scalia noted, "The use of legislative history is illegitimate and ill advised in the interpretation of any statute".<ref>{{Citation |last=Greenhouse |first=Linda |title=Court to weigh race as factor in school rolls |periodical=The New York Times |date=June 6, 2006a |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/06/washington/06scotus.html |access-date=January 13, 2010}}</ref>
His dislike of legislative history may have been a reason that other justices have become more cautious in its use.<ref name="leghist" /> Gregory Maggs wrote in the ''Public Interest Law Review'' in 1995 that by the early 1990s, legislative history was being cited in only about forty percent of Supreme Court cases involving the interpretation of [[statute]]s and that no case of that era used legislative history as an essential reason for the outcome. Maggs suggested,

{{quote|With Justice Scalia breathing down the necks of anyone who peeks into the Congressional Record or Senate reports, the other members of the Court may have concluded that the benefit of citing legislative history does not outweigh its costs. It is likely for this reason that the percentage of cases citing it has decreased dramatically. No one likes an unnecessary fight, especially not one with as formidable an opponent as Justice Scalia.<ref name="leghist">{{Harvnb|Rossum|2006|p=44}}.</ref>}}

Scalia described himself as an [[originalism|originalist]], meaning that he interpreted the [[United States Constitution]] as it would have been understood when it was adopted. According to Scalia in 2008, "It's what did the words mean to the people who ratified the Bill of Rights or who ratified the Constitution".<ref name="sixty">{{Citation |title=Justice Scalia on the record |work=CBS |date=August 24, 2008 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/04/24/60minutes/main4040290.shtml |access-date=January 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104040614/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/04/24/60minutes/main4040290.shtml |archive-date=January 4, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>
In 2006, before [[George W. Bush]] appointees [[John Roberts|Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito|Alito]] had had time to make an impact, Rossum wrote that Scalia had failed to win converts among his conservative colleagues for his use of [[originalism]],{{sfn|Rossum|2006|p=198}} whereas Roberts and Alito, as younger men with an originalist approach, greatly admired Scalia battling for what he believed in.{{sfn|Biskupic|2009|p=275}} Following the appointments of Roberts and Alito, both Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are identified in their judicial temperament as being originalists with Kavanuagh referred to as "a stalwart originalist" in the tradition of Scalia.<ref>Alana Abramson.

In a 2009 public conversation, Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] questioned Scalia, indicating that those who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment did not intend to end school segregation. Scalia called this argument "[[waving the bloody shirt]] of ''Brown''" and indicated that he would have joined [[John Marshall Harlan|first Justice Harlan's]] solitary dissent in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', the 1896 case that ''Brown'' overruled.<ref>{{Citation |last=Liptak |first=Adam |title=Sidebar: From 19th Century view, desegregation is a test |periodical=The New York Times |date=November 9, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/us/10bar.html |access-date=February 12, 2010}}</ref>

Scalia's originalist approach came under attack from critics, who viewed it as "a cover for what they see as Scalia's real intention: to turn back some pivotal court decisions of the 1960s and 70s" reached by the [[Warren Court|Warren]] and Burger Courts.<ref name="sixty" /> [[Ralph Nader]] argued in 2008 that Scalia's originalist philosophy was inconsistent with the justice's acceptance of the [[Corporate personhood debate|extension of certain constitutional rights to corporations]] when at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment's ratification, corporations were not commonly understood to possess constitutional rights.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Nader |first1=Ralph |last2=Weissman |first2=Robert |title=Letter to the Editor: Ralph Nader on Scalia's "originalism" |publisher=Harvard Law Record |date=November 13, 2008 |url=http://hlrecord.org/?p=11026 |access-date=April 29, 2014}}</ref> Nader's view preceded the Court's 2010 decision in ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]''. Scalia, in his concurrence in that case, traced his understanding of the rights of groups of individuals at the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights. His argument was based on the lack of an exception for groups such as corporations in the free speech guarantee in the Bill of Rights and on several examples of corporate political speech from the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights.<ref>{{Citation |title=''Citizens United v.

Scalia [[recusal|recused]] himself from ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'' (2004), a claim brought by atheist [[Michael Newdow]] alleging that recitation of the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] (including the words "under God") in school classrooms violated the rights of his daughter, who he said was also an atheist. Shortly after the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled in Newdow's favor but before the case came before the Supreme Court, Scalia spoke at a [[Knights of Columbus]] event in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], stating that the Ninth Circuit decision was an example of how the courts were trying to excise God from public life. The school district requested that the Supreme Court review the case, and Newdow asked that Scalia recuse himself because of this prior statement, which he did without comment.<ref>{{Citation |last=Greenhouse |first=Linda |title=Justices take case on Pledge of Allegiance's reference to God |periodical=The New York Times |date=October 14, 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/14/national/14CND-SCOTUS.html |access-date=January 29, 2010}}</ref>

Scalia declined to recuse himself from ''[[Cheney v. United States District Court for the District of Columbia]]'' (2005), a case concerning whether Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] could keep secret the membership of an advisory task force on energy policy. Scalia was asked to recuse himself because he had gone on a hunting trip with various persons including Cheney, during which he traveled one way on [[Air Force Two]]. Scalia issued a lengthy [[in-chambers opinion]] refusing to recuse himself, stating that though Cheney was a longtime friend, he was being sued merely in his official capacity and that were justices to step aside in the cases of officials who are parties because of official capacity, the Supreme Court would cease to function. Scalia indicated that it was far from unusual for justices to socialize with other government officials, recalling that the late Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson]] played poker with President [[Harry Truman]] and that Justice [[Byron White]] went skiing with Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Scalia stated that he was never alone with Cheney during the trip, the two had not discussed the case, and the justice had saved no money because he had bought round-trip tickets, the cheapest available.<ref>{{Citation |last=Janofsky |first=Michael |title=Scalia refuses to take himself off Cheney case |periodical=The New York Times |date=March 19, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/19/us/scalia-refusing-to-take-himself-off-cheney-case.html |access-date=January 29, 2010}}</ref> Scalia was part of the 7–2 majority once the case was heard, a decision that generally upheld Cheney's position.<ref>{{Citation |last=Greenhouse |first=Linda |title=Justices' ruling postpones resolution of Cheney case |periodical=The New York Times |date=June 25, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/25/us/justices-ruling-postpones-resolution-of-cheney-case.html |access-date=January 29, 2010}}</ref> Scalia later described his refusal to recuse himself as his "most heroic opinion" because it had exposed him to a great deal of criticism.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scalia Defends Involvement in Cheney Case|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/12/AR2006041201905.html|work=The Washington Post|agency=AP|date=April 13, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Senior|first1=Jennifer|title=In Conversation: Antonin Scalia|url=https://nymag.com/news/features/antonin-scalia-2013-10/index7.html|work=NYMag.com|date=October 6, 2013}}</ref>

===Religious views===
Scalia was a devout [[Roman Catholic]], and his son Paul entered the priesthood. Uncomfortable with the changes brought about following [[Vatican&nbsp;II]], Scalia drove long distances to parishes he felt were more in accord with his beliefs, including parishes that celebrated the [[Tridentine Latin Mass]] in Chicago and Washington,<ref>{{Harvnb|Biskupic|2009|p=185}}.</ref> and one celebrating the Latin version<ref>{{cite web |first=Katie |last=Collins |title=Parish Profile: Great Falls St. Catherine of Siena |url=http://catholicherald.com/stories/Willing-to-say-it-like-it-is,14166 |work=[[Arlington Catholic Herald]] |date=October 27, 2010 |access-date=January 5, 2016}}</ref> of the [[Mass of Paul VI]] at St. Catherine of Siena in [[Great Falls, Virginia]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUEEQy9mKB0C&pg=PA120 |contribution=Mondays are for dead drops |title=The Spy Who Stayed Out in the Cold: The Secret Life of FBI Double Agent Robert Hanssen|first=Adrian|last=Havill|date=November 18, 2002|publisher=Macmillan|via=Google Books|page=120 |isbn=9780312986292 }}</ref> In a 2013 interview with Jennifer Senior for ''New York'' magazine, Scalia was asked whether his beliefs extended to the Devil, and he stated, "Of course! Yeah, he's a real person. Hey, c'mon, that's standard Catholic doctrine! Every Catholic believes that". When asked whether he had seen recent evidence of the Devil, Scalia replied: "You know, it is curious. In the Gospels, the Devil is doing all sorts of things. He's making pigs run off cliffs, he's possessing people and whatnot&nbsp;... What he's doing now is getting people not to believe in him or in God. He's much more successful that way".<ref name="senior"/> In another 2013 interview, Scalia said, "In order for capitalism to work, in order for it to produce a good and stable society, traditional Christian virtues are essential".<ref>{{cite news |last=Slevin |first=Jeremy |url=https://www.msnbc.com/now-alex-wagner/elizabeth-warren-slams-pro-corporate |title=Elizabeth Warren slams "pro-corporate" Supremes |work=[[Now with Alex Wagner|NOW with Alex Wagner]] |publisher=MSNBC |access-date=November 18, 2013 |date=September 11, 2013 }}</ref>

In 2006, upon leaving church, Scalia was asked by a reporter whether being a traditionalist Catholic had caused problems for him, and he responded by asking, "You know what I say to those people?" and with a gesture, cupping his hand under his chin and flicking his fingers out. The gesture, which got captured by a photographer, was initially reported by the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' as obscene. Scalia responded to the reports with a letter to the editor, accusing the news staff of watching too many episodes of ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and stating that the gesture was a strong brush-off. Roger Axtell, an expert on body language, described the gesture as possibly meaning "I've had enough, go away" and noted, "It's a fairly strong gesture".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Brand |first=Madeline |others=Roger Axtell (guest) |title=Justice Scalia's under-the-chin gesture |publisher=NPR |date=March 30, 2006 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5312065 |access-date=November 18, 2013}}</ref> The gesture was parodied by comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] during [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|his performance at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner]] later that year, with the justice in attendance: cameras showed that unlike most of the butts of Colbert's jokes that evening, Scalia was laughing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2140921/nav/tap2|first=Tray|last=Patterson|title=Dinner Theater: Why Stephen Colbert didn't bomb in D.C.|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=May 2, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023003705/http://www.slate.com/id/2140921/nav/tap2 |archive-date=October 23, 2010}}</ref><ref name="colbert20160215">{{cite episode | title=Stephen's Tribute To Antonin Scalia | series=The Late Show with Stephen Colbert | network=CBS | airdate=2016-02-15 | url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/video/9F55BEB7-1D3C-F255-AE28-E7CE078D0C1E/stephen-s-tribute-to-antonin-scalia/}}</ref>

===1996 presidential election===
According to [[John Boehner]], as chairman of the [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference]], he sought to persuade Scalia to run for election as vice president with [[Bob Dole]] in 1996. As related by Boehner, Scalia listened to the proposal and dictated the same reply Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] had once given to a similar query: "The possibility is too remote to comment upon, given my position". Dole did put Scalia on his list of potential running mates but eventually settled on [[Jack Kemp]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Boehner|first1=John|title=The Time I Tried To Persuade Antonin Scalia To Run For Vice President|url=http://opinion.injo.com/2016/02/253148-time-tried-persuade-antonin-scalia-run-vice-president-united-states/|access-date=February 16, 2016|work=Independent Journal|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218211901/http://opinion.injo.com/2016/02/253148-time-tried-persuade-antonin-scalia-run-vice-president-united-states/|archive-date=February 18, 2016}}</ref>

==Personal life==
On September 10, 1960<!--possibly November 10-->, Scalia married Maureen McCarthy at St. Pius X church in [[Yarmouth, Massachusetts]].<ref name=pius/> The two had met on a blind date while he was at Harvard Law School. Maureen was <!--implies she no longer was when they met; is that true? source is clear she was a student at the time--> an undergraduate student at [[Radcliffe College]] when they met; she subsequently<!--to their meeting, or marriage?

Scalia also enjoyed a friendship with fellow Justice [[Elena Kagan]], also considered a member of the court's liberal wing. When Justice [[David Souter]] retired, Scalia told [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]], an adviser to then-President [[Barack Obama]], that he hoped that Obama would nominate Kagan to replace him.

==Legacy==
===Influence===
Writing in the ''American Spectator'', Adam Carrington noted that, "Since his death in February of 2016, Scalia’s influence of course continues through his three decades of judicial opinions. But he still exerts great influence in another, less-discussed way. In 2012, he co-authored the book ''Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts'' with Bryan A. Garner. This work describes numerous “canons,” or rules regarding how to interpret legal documents&nbsp;...  A mere seven years since its publication, Reading Law has been cited in over 1,000 state and federal cases. Just this spring, for instance, Supreme Court justices referenced the work in 10 cases."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spectator.org/reading-law-justice-scalias-other-legacy/|title=Reading Law: Justice Scalia's Other Legacy &#124; The American Spectator &#124; Politics Is Too Important To Be Taken Seriously.|website=The American Spectator}}</ref>

Scalia's promotion of textualism and originalism on the high court led to a shift in the American judiciary's approach to textual interpretation, with greater attention paid to the text itself. The liberal political philosopher [[Ronald Dworkin]] said that because of Scalia, "we are all originalists now." For this reason, he is often described as one of the most influential jurists of the twentieth century.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/what-made-antonin-scalia-great/462837/|title=What Made Antonin Scalia Great|last=Rosen|first=Jeffrey|date=February 15, 2016|work=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=July 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713024756/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/what-made-antonin-scalia-great/462837/|archive-date=July 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Posthumous tributes ===
According to NBC News, tributes to "larger-than-life Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia poured in [from] both sides of the political aisle" following his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tributes-pour-justice-antonin-scalia-towering-figure-n518186|title=Tributes Pour in for Justice Scalia From Both Sides of Aisle|website=NBC News}}</ref> All eight of Scalia's fellow justices released statements honoring him following his death. Justice Clarence Thomas said, "'Justice Scalia was a good man; a wonderful husband who loved his wife and his family; a man of strong faith; a towering intellect; a legal giant; and a dear, dear friend. In every case, he gave it his all to get the broad principles and the small details right. … It is hard to imagine the court without my friend. I will miss him beyond all measure'". Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said:
{{Quote
|text=From our years together at the D.C. Circuit, we were best buddies. We disagreed now and then, but when I wrote for the [Supreme] Court and received a Scalia dissent, the opinion ultimately released was notably better than my initial circulation. Justice Scalia nailed all the weak spots—the "applesauce" and "argle bargle"—and gave me just what I needed to strengthen the majority opinion... It was my great good fortune to have known him as working colleague and treasured friend.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.dailysignal.com/2016/02/16/8-tributes-to-antonin-scalia-from-his-fellow-justices/|title=8 Tributes From Scalia's Colleagues|first=2016 / Leave a|last=comment|date=February 16, 2016|website=The Daily Signal}}</ref>
