Nuclear power has been a topical political issue in recent decades, with continuing debates about when the technology should be phased out. The [[anti-nuclear movement in Germany]] has a long history dating back to the early 1970s, when large demonstrations prevented the construction of a nuclear plant at [[Wyhl]].

Eight of the seventeen operating reactors in Germany were permanently shut down following Fukushima. [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] said the [[nuclear power phase-out]], previously scheduled to go offline as late as 2036, would give Germany a competitive advantage in the [[renewable energy]] era, stating, "As the first big industrialized nation, we can achieve such a transformation toward efficient and renewable energies, with all the opportunities that brings for exports, developing new technologies and jobs".

==History==
[[File:Electricity production in Germany.PNG|thumb|Germany, like most countries in the world, generates the majority of its electricity from traditional fossil fuel sources. Nuclear power was developing as a major source of generation until political pressure stopped its growth in the mid-1980s. Since then no new generating stations have been constructed.]]
[[File:Grüne protests against nuclear energy.jpg|right|thumb|Anti-nuclear protest near [[Deep geological repository|nuclear waste disposal centre]] at [[Gorleben]] in northern Germany on 8 November 2008. The banner reads "Only the risk is certain. Atomic power? No thanks!"]]
[[File:Kk stendal.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the incomplete Stendal NPP reactor building]]

German publications of the 1950s and 1960s contained criticism of some features of nuclear power including its safety. [[Nuclear waste disposal]] was widely recognized as a major problem, with concern publicly expressed as early as 1954. In 1964, one author went so far as to state "that the dangers and costs of the necessary final disposal of nuclear waste could possibly make it necessary to forego the development of nuclear energy".<ref name=wolf>Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 63.</ref>

As in many [[industrialised countries]], nuclear power in Germany was first developed in the late 1950s. Only a few experimental reactors went online before 1960, and [[Kahl Nuclear Power Plant|an experimental nuclear power station]] in [[Kahl am Main]] opened in 1960. All of the German nuclear power plants that opened between 1960 and 1970 had – like otherways in the whole world – a power output of less than 1,000&nbsp;MW and have now all closed down. The first almost fully commercial nuclear power plant started operating in 1969: [[Obrigheim Nuclear Power Plant|Obrigheim]] operated until 2005, where it was shutdown by phaseout decision of the government. The first station with a power output of more than 1000 MW each were the two units of [[Biblis Nuclear Power Plant]] in 1974 and 1976.

A closed nuclear fuel cycle was planned, starting with mining operations in the [[Saarland]] and the [[Schwarzwald]]; uranium ore concentration, fuel rod filling production in [[Hanau]]; and reprocessing of the spent fuel in the never-built [[nuclear reprocessing|nuclear fuel reprocessing plant]] at [[Wackersdorf]]. The radioactive waste was intended to be stored in a [[deep geological repository]], as part of the [[Gorleben]] long-term storage project. Today, there is a "ergebnisoffener" searching process over the whole country for the storage of the irradiated nuclear fuel.

In the early 1960s there was a proposal to build a nuclear power station in West [[Berlin]], but the project was dropped in 1962. Another attempt to site a reactor in a major city was made in 1967, when [[BASF]] planned to build a nuclear power station on its ground at Ludwigshafen, to supply process steam. The project was withdrawn by BASF.<ref name=wolf/>

In 1959, 15 municipal electric companies established the ''Association of Experimental Reactor GmbH'' ('''A'''rbeitsgemeinschaft '''V'''ersuchs'''r'''eaktor, AVR) to demonstrate the feasibility and viability of a gas-cooled, graphite-moderated high temperature reactor ([[Very-high-temperature reactor|HTGR]]).
In the early 1960s, it started the design and construction of [[AVR reactor|AVR]] at the [[Forschungszentrum Jülich|Jülich Research Centre]]. First criticality was attained in 1966, and the AVR was in operation for more than 22 years. Despite the fuel feed and discharge system showed excellent availability, the AVR was shut down for political reasons in 1988. The AVR was designed to breed [[uranium-233]] from [[thorium-232]]. Thorium-232 is over 100 times as abundant in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] as [[uranium-235]].

In 1965, before the AVR started operation, a basic design for a commercial demonstration HTGR reactor using thorium was started, the [[THTR-300]]. The HTGR, rated at 300 MW<sub>e</sub>, synchronized with the grid in 1985. Six months later a fuel pebble became lodged in the reactor core. After repairs, it was restarted and operated from July 1986, reaching full power in September 1986. It operated until September 1988, and was shutdown in September 1989.

By 1992, a group of German and Swiss firms planned to proceed with construction of a HTR-500, a design that made considerable use of the THTR-300 technology. But the by then politically hostile environment halted any effort. The technology is now pursued by the Chinese as the [[Shidao Bay Nuclear Power Plant#HTR-PM|HTR-PM]].

In the early 1970s, large public demonstrations prevented the construction of a [[nuclear plant]] at [[Wyhl]]. The Wyhl protests were an example of a local community challenging the nuclear industry through a strategy of direct action and civil disobedience. Police were accused of using unnecessarily violent means. [[Anti-nuclear]] success at Wyhl inspired nuclear opposition throughout [[Germany]] and elsewhere.<ref name=wrudig>Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, pp. 130–135.</ref>

The [[Rheinsberg Nuclear Power Plant]] was the first (mostly experimental) nuclear power plant in [[East Germany]]. It was of low power and operated from 1966 until 1990. The second to be commissioned, the [[Greifswald Nuclear Power Plant]], was planned to house eight of the Russian 440&nbsp;MW [[VVER|VVER-440]] reactors. The first four went online between 1973 and 1979. Greifswald 5 operated for less than a month before it was closed, the other three were cancelled during different stages of their build-up. In 1990, during the [[German reunification]], all eastern Germany nuclear power plants were closed due to flaws in safety standards. The [[Stendal Nuclear Power Plant]] in East Germany was to be the largest nuclear power station in Germany. After [[German reunification]], and due to concerns about the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] design, construction was stopped and the power station was never completed. In the 1990s the three cooling towers which had been erected were demolished, and the area is an industrial estate today.

In September 2011, [[Siemens]], which had been responsible for constructing all 17 of Germany's existing nuclear power plants, announced that it would exit the [[nuclear sector]] following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]] and the subsequent changes to German energy policy. It will no longer build nuclear power plants anywhere in the world.

=== Nuclear waste liability buyout 2016 ===
{{Main|Nuclear Waste Disposal Fund}}
On 19 October 2016, the German cabinet (''{{lang|de|Bundeskabinett}}'') finalized a deal with nuclear power plant operators E.ON, EnBW, RWE, and Vattenfall over long-term nuclear waste disposal.  Under the agreement, the four operators are freed of responsibility for storing radioactive waste – that responsibility is instead transferred  to the state.  In return, the operators will pay a total of €17.4{{nbsp}}billion into a state-administered fund to finance the interim and final storage of nuclear waste.  They will also pay an additional "risk surcharge" of €6.2{{nbsp}}billion (35.5%) to cover the eventuality that costs exceed current projections and that the interest accrued by the fund is lower than expected.  The operators will be responsible for decommissioning and deconstructing their own nuclear power plants, as well as preparing their radioactive waste for final storage.

Critics, including the [[:de:Bundesverband Erneuerbare Energie|German Renewable Energy Federation]] and [[Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland|BUND]], claim the total of €23.6{{nbsp}}billion would prove insufficient and that future taxpayers will carry the risk.<ref name="wettengel-2016">{{cite news | first = Julian | last = Wettengel | title = German utilities buy out of nuclear waste liability for 23.6 bln euros | date = 19 October 2016 | work = Clean Energy Wire (CLEW) | location = Berlin, Germany | url = https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-utilities-buy-out-nuclear-waste-liability-236-bln-euros | access-date = 21 October 2016}}</ref>

It is due to be enacted in early 2017.

==Role for coal and renewables==
{{Main|Electricity sector in Germany|Renewable energy in Germany|}}

Since nuclear power generated almost a third of the electricity in Germany, many thought that the country would  have to import energy as the nuclear phase-out progressed. At first, Germany was still selling more electricity than it bought, due to its [[renewable energy industry]].<ref name=sustbus>{{cite web |url=http://www.sustainablebusiness.com/index.cfm/go/news.display/id/22978|title=Germany's Shift to Renewables is Paying Off |date=30 September 2011 |work=SustainableBusiness.com  }}</ref> Renewable energy supplied a record 20.8% of Germany’s  electricity in the first half of 2011, from [[wind power]], [[solar power]], biomass and hydro. Germany installed over 7,400 MW of solar in 2010 and another 7,000 MW was added in 2011. Solar and wind capacity is expected to grow by 32% from 2012–2013. Since 2011 the price of electricity has risen by 20%<ref name=cewGermanHouseholds>{{cite web |url=https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/what-german-households-pay-power |title=What German households pay for power |date=1 April 2019 |publisher=Clean Energy Wire}}</ref> and as of 2018 the cost of electricity in Germany is the 10th most expensive compared to other countries in the world.<ref name=woldatl>{{cite web |url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/electricity-rates-around-the-world.html|title=Cost Of Electricity By Country

Germany has combined the phase-out with an initiative for [[renewable energy]] and wants to increase the efficiency of [[fossil energy|fossil power plants]] in an effort to reduce the reliance on coal. According to the former German Minister for the Environment [[Jürgen Trittin]], in 2020, this would cut [[carbon dioxide]] emissions by 40&nbsp;percent compared with 1990&nbsp;levels. Germany has become one of the leaders in the efforts to fulfill the [[Kyoto protocol]]. Critics of the German policy have called it a mistake to abandon nuclear power, claiming the only alternative to nuclear power was coal and abandoning nuclear power was therefore contradictory to the goal of lowering CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.<ref name="BBC-2005">{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4295389.stm |title= Germany split over green energy |date= 25 February 2005 |work=BBC News  |accessdate=19 July 2008}}</ref>

As a result of its efforts and subsidies, Germany has developed advanced non-conventional renewable energy for electricity generation, particularly in [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] and [[wind turbine]] installations. At the same time, Germany continues to rely heavily on coal power, with usage increasing to offset the phase-out of nuclear energy.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-03-21/germany-plans-boom-in-coal-power-plantsbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice |title=Germany Plans Boom in Coal Power Plants |first=Roland |last=Nelles |work=Bloomberg Businessweek  |date=21 March 2007 |accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref>

The German nuclear industry has insisted that its shutdown would cause major damage to the country's industrial base. In 2012, member firms of the Verband der Industriellen Energie- und Kraftwirtschaft (VIK) reported [[power failure]]s of several seconds duration, combined with a rise in frequency fluctuations. These were reportedly caused by network overloads due to the shutdown of nuclear power plants, and an increase in wind power generation.<ref>http://www.aggbusiness.com/articles/business-news/companies-de-energised-by-blackouts-3456/{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> VIK also fear that [[industrial control unit]]s will be damaged by outages.

The cost of replacing Germany's nuclear power generation with renewable energy has been officially estimated by the German [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Germany)|Ministry of Economics]] at about €0.01/[[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] (about €55&nbsp;billion for the next decade), on top of the €13&nbsp;billion per year already devoted to subsidizing renewables. 
However, unofficial estimates of the ministry, and of the [[RWI Essen|Rhenish-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research]] (RWI), German Energy Agency (DENA), Federation of German Consumer Organizations (VZBV), and the government-owned development bank ([[KfW]]), put the cost several times higher, at about €250&nbsp;billion ($340&nbsp;B) over the next decade.<ref>{{cite news

In March 2013, the administrative court for the German state of Hesse ruled that a three-month closure imposed by the government on RWE's Biblis A and B reactors as an immediate response to Fukushima Daiichi accident was illegal.<ref>http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-Court_rules_Biblis_closure_unlawful-2802137.html</ref> The state ministry of the environment acted illegally in March 2011, when an order was issued for the immediate closure of the Biblis units. RWE complied with the decree by shutting Biblis-A immediately, however as the plants were in compliance with the relevant safety requirements, the German government had no legal grounds for shutting them. The court ruled that the closure notice was illegal because RWE had not been given sufficient opportunity to respond to the order.
