'''''The News Tribune''''' is a daily [[newspaper]] in [[Tacoma, Washington]], in the United States.

==History==
The newspaper can trace its origins back to the founding of the weekly ''Tacoma Ledger'' by R.F. Radebaugh in 1880. The next year, H.C. Patrick founded ''The News'', another weekly. Both papers became dailies in 1883. In 1898, Radebaugh and Patrick sold their papers to S.A. Perkins. Radebaugh re-entered the market in 1907 with the debut of the ''Tacoma Tribune''. He exited five years later with the sale of the ''Tribune'' to Frank S. and Elbert H. Baker. The Bakers then purchased ''The News'' and the ''Tacoma Ledger'' in 1918, and all three papers were combined into the ''Tacoma News Tribune and Ledger''.<ref name="McClatchy profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchy.com/146/story/444.html|title=The McClatchy Company Newspapers: The News Tribune|publisher=The McClatchy Company|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref>

In 1948, the paper began operating the [[radio station]]s [[KITZ|KTNT-AM]] and '''KTNT-FM''', and began operating a [[television station]] with the same call letters in 1953. In 1972, KTNT-FM's call letters were changed to '''KNBQ''', which became '''KBSG''' in 1988, and [[KIRO-FM]] in 2008. Two years later, the television station was sold and its call letters changed to [[KSTW]], which is now an owned-and-operated station of The CW.

In 1979, the newspaper adopted the name ''Tacoma News Tribune''. Its parent bought the ''[[Pierce County Herald]]'' in 1983. In 1986, the Tribune Publishing Company's newspaper assets were bought by [[McClatchy Newspapers]].

''The News Tribune'' published as ''The Morning News Tribune'' from April 6, 1987 to October 4, 1993, when "Morning" was dropped from its name.

The newspaper, alongside sister publication ''[[The Olympian]]'', were printed at a plant in Tacoma until February 3, 2019.<ref>{{cite news |date=November 29, 2018 |title=Printing change planned for News Tribune, Olympian |url=https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/business/article222361865.html |work=The News Tribune |accessdate=February 2, 2019}}</ref> Since that time, the two newspapers have been printed at the facilities of ''[[The Columbian]]'' in [[Vancouver, Washington]].<ref>{{cite news |date=November 29, 2018 |title=Printing change planned for News Tribune, Olympian |url=They stopped the presses.
