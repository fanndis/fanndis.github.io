==Terminology==
===Etymology===
The phrase ''coup d'état'' comes from French ''coup d'État'', literally meaning a "state stroke", a "blow against the state". In French, the word ''État'' ({{IPA-fr|eta|lang}}) is capitalized when it denotes a sovereign political entity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://66.46.185.79/bdl/gabarit_bdl.asp?t1=1&id=1285&D=%C9tat |title=Banque de dépannage linguistique – état |publisher=Office québécois de la langue française |accessdate=12 December 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120701102722/http://66.46.185.79/bdl/gabarit_bdl.asp?t1=1&id=1285&D=%C9tat |archive-date=1 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/coup+d'etat |title=coup d'état |access-date=12 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915222433/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/coup+d%27etat |archive-date=15 September 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/coup+d%27etat|title=coup d'etat |website=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/coup-d'%C3%A9tat |title=coup d'état |access-date=12 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106083058/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/coup-d'%C3%A9tat |archive-date=6 November 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coup+d%27%C3%A9tat |title=Definition of COUP D'ÉTAT |website=www.merriam-webster.com}}</ref>

Although the concept of a coup d'état has featured in politics since antiquity, the phrase is of relatively recent coinage;<ref name="ancient_coup">[[Caesar's civil war|Julius Caesar's civil war]], 5 January 49 BC.</ref> the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' identifies it as a French expression meaning a "stroke of state". The phrase did not appear within an English text before the 19th century except when used in translation of a French source, there being no simple phrase in English to convey the contextualized idea of a 'knockout blow to the existing administration within a state'.

One early use within text translated from French was in 1785 in a printed translation of a letter from a French merchant, commenting on an arbitrary decree or ''arrêt'' issued by the French king restricting the import of British wool.<ref>''Norfolk Chronicle'', 13 August 1785: "It is thought here by some, that it is a Coup d'Etat played off as a prelude to a disagreeable after-piece. But I can confidently assure you, that the above-mentioned ''arret'' was promulgated in consequence of innumerable complaints and murmurs which have found their way to the ears of the Sovereign. Our merchants contend, that they experience the greatest difficulties in trading with the English".</ref> What may be its first published use within a text composed in English is an editor's note in the London ''[[The Morning Chronicle|Morning Chronicle]]'', 7 January 1802, reporting the arrest by [[Napoleon]] in France, of [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]], [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]], [[André Masséna|Masséna]], and [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]]: "There was a report in circulation yesterday of a sort of coup d'état having taken place in France, in consequence of some formidable conspiracy against the existing government."

In [[French Revolution|post-Revolutionary France]], the phrase came to be used to describe the various murders by Napoleon's hated secret police, the ''[[Gendarmerie|Gens d'Armes d'Elite]]'', who murdered the [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien|Duke of Enghien]]: "...the actors in torture, the distributors of the poisoning draughts, and the secret executioners of those unfortunate individuals or families, whom Bonaparte's measures of safety require to remove. In what revolutionary tyrants call ''grand[s]'' coups d'état, as butchering, or poisoning, or drowning, ''en masse'', they are exclusively employed."<ref>{{cite news |title=unk|newspaper=[[Kentish Gazette]] |location=Canterbury |date=16 October 1804 |page=2}}</ref>

=== Use of the phrase ===
Clayton Thyne and Jonathan Powell's dataset of coups defines attempted coups as "illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive."<ref name=":0" /> They arrive at this definition by combining common definitions in the existing literature, and removing specificities and ambiguities that exist in many definitions.<ref name=":0" />

In looser usage, as in "intelligence coup" or "boardroom coup", the term simply refers to gaining a sudden advantage on a rival.

=== Putsch ===
Since an unsuccessful coup d'état in 1920, the [[Kapp Putsch]], the [[Helvetism#Swiss expressions loaned into Standard German|Swiss-German]] word ''Putsch'' has also been used in English. Pronounced {{IPA-de|pʊtʃ|}}, and originally coined for the [[Züriputsch]] of 6 September 1839 in Switzerland, putsch denotes the politico-military actions of an unsuccessful minority reactionary coup.<ref>[http://www.dwds.de/?view=1&qu=Putsch Etymology and definition of ''Putsch''] in German</ref><ref name=HistoryZurich>{{cite book |title=Kleine Zürcher Verfassungsgeschichte 1218–2000 |language=de |url=http://www.staatsarchiv.zh.ch/internet/justiz_inneres/sta/de/ueber_uns/veroeffentlichungen/_jcr_content/contentPar/downloadlist_1/downloaditems/download_stark_reduz.spooler.download.1282812455918.pdf/zh_verfassungsgeschichte.pdf |publisher=[[:de:Staatsarchiv des Kantons Zürich|State Archives of the Canton of Zurich]] |location=Zurich |page= 51 |date=13 September 2000}}</ref><ref name=Etymology>{{cite book |author=Pfeifer, Wolfgang |title=Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Deutschen |trans-title=Etymological Dictionary of German |language=de |publisher=[[Akademie Verlag]] |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3050006260 |edition=second |date=31 January 1993|author-link=:de:Wolfgang Pfeifer (Etymologe) }}</ref>

Other recent and notable unsuccessful minority reactionary coups that are often referred to as ''Putsches'' are the 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]] and [[Küstrin Putsch]], the 1961 [[Algiers putsch of 1961|Algiers Putsch]] and the 1991 [[August Putsch]]. Putsch was used as disinformation by [[Hitler]] and other [[Nazi Party|Nazi party]] members to falsely claim that he had to suppress a reactionary coup during the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. Germans still use the term {{lang|de|Röhm-Putsch}} to describe the murders, the term given to it by the Nazi regime, despite its unproven implication that the murders were necessary to prevent a coup. Thus, German authors often use quotation marks or write about the {{lang|de|sogenannter Röhm-Putsch}} ('so-called Röhm Putsch') for emphasis.<ref name="Röhm-Putsch">{{cite web |title=Röhm-Putsch |language=de |publisher=Deutsches Historisches Museum (DHM), German Historical Museum |url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/nazi/innenpolitik/roehm/ |accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>

=== {{lang|es|Pronunciamiento}} ===
{{main|Pronunciamiento}}
{{lang|es|Pronunciamiento}} ("pronouncement") is a term of [[Spain|Spanish]] origin for a special type of {{lang|fr|coup d'état}}. The {{lang|fr|coup d'état}} (called {{lang|es|golpe de estado}} in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) was more common in Spain and South America, while the {{lang|es|pronunciamiento}} was more common in [[Central America]] and [[Mexico]]. The {{lang|es|pronunciamiento}} is the formal explanation for deposing the regnant government, justifying the installation of the new government that was effected with the {{lang|es|golpe de estado}}. A "barracks revolt" or {{lang|es|cuartelazo}} is also a term for military revolt, from the Spanish term {{lang|es|cuartel}} ("quarter" or "barracks"). Specific military garrisons are the sparking factor for a larger military revolt against the government.<ref> Little-Siebold, Todd. "''Cuartelazo''" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 2, p. 305. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref>

One author makes a distinction between a coup and a {{lang|es|pronunciamiento}}. In a coup, it is the military, paramilitary, or opposing political faction that deposes the current government and assumes power; whereas, in the {{lang|es|pronunciamiento}}, the military deposes the existing government and installs a/an (ostensibly) civilian government.<ref name="Luttwak">{{cite book |last=Luttwak |first=Edward |year=1979 |title=Coup d'État: A Practical Handbook |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-17547-1}}</ref>

{{further|List of coups d'état and coup attempts|List of coups d'état and coup attempts by country}}
According to Clayton Thyne and Jonathan Powell's coup dataset, there were 457 coup attempts from 1950 to 2010, of which 227 (49.7%) were successful and 230 (50.3%) were unsuccessful.<ref name=":0" /> They find that coups have "been most common in Africa and the Americas (36.5% and 31.9%, respectively).

A 2016 study categorizes coups into four possible outcomes:<ref name=":2" />
* Failed coup
* No regime change, such as when a leader is illegally shuffled out of power without changing the identity of the group in power or the rules for governing
* Replacement of incumbent [[dictatorship]] with another
* Ousting of the dictatorship followed by democratization (also called "democratic coups")<ref>{{cite book|last=Varol|first=Ozan O.|url=https://smile.amazon.com/Democratic-Coup-d%C3%89tat-Ozan-Varol/dp/019062602X/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=|title=The Democratic Coup d'État|date=7 November 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190626020|via=Amazon}}</ref>

The study also found that about half of all coups—both during and after the Cold War—install new [[Autocracy|autocratic]] regimes.<ref name=":2" /> New dictatorships launched by coups engage in higher levels of repression in the year that follows the coup than existed in the year leading to the coup.<ref name=":2" /> One-third of coups during the Cold War and 10% of post-Cold War coups reshuffled the regime leadership.<ref name=":2" /> Democracies were installed in the wake of 12% of Cold War coups and 40% of post-Cold War coups.<ref name=":2" />

== Predictors ==
A 2003 review of the academic literature found that the following factors were associated with coups:
{{div col}}
* officers' personal grievances
* military organizational grievances
* military popularity
* military attitudinal cohesiveness
* economic decline
* domestic political crisis
* contagion from other regional coups
* external threat
* participation in war
* collusion with a foreign military power
* military's national security doctrine
* officers' political culture
* noninclusive institutions
* colonial legacy
* economic development
* undiversified exports
* officers' class composition
* military size
* strength of civil society
* regime legitimacy and past coups.<ref name=":5" />

A 2017 study found that autocratic leaders whose states were involved in international rivalries over disputed territory were more likely to be overthrown in a coup. The authors of the study provide the following logic for why this is: "Autocratic incumbents invested in spatial rivalries need to strengthen the military in order to compete with a foreign adversary.

A 2020 study found that elections had a two-sided impact on coup attempts, depending on the state of the economy. During periods of economic expansion, elections reduced the likelihood of coup attempts, whereas elections during economic crises increased the likelihood of coup attempts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Krishnarajan|first1=Suthan|last2=Rørbæk|first2=Lasse Lykke|date=2020-01-21|title=The Two-sided Effect of Elections on Coup Attempts|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=64|issue=7–8|language=en|pages=1279–1306|doi=10.1177/0022002719900001|s2cid=212902955|issn=0022-0027}}</ref>

In autocracies, the frequency of coups seems to be affected by the succession rules in place, with monarchies with a fixed succession rule being much less plagued by instability than less institutionalized autocracies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kurrild-Klitgaard|first=Peter|date=2000|title=The constitutional economics of autocratic succession|journal=Public Choice|volume=103|issue=1/2|pages=63–84|doi=10.1023/A:1005078532251|s2cid=154097838|issn=0048-5829}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kurrild-Klitgaard|first=Peter|date=2004|title=Autocratic succession|journal=Encyclopedia of Public Choice|volume=103|pages=358–362|doi=10.1007/978-0-306-47828-4_39|isbn=978-0-306-47828-4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Escribà-Folch|first1=Abel|last2=Böhmelt|first2=Tobias|last3=Pilster|first3=Ulrich|date=2019-04-09|title=Authoritarian regimes and civil–military relations: Explaining counterbalancing in autocracies|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|volume=37|issue=5|language=en|pages=559–579|doi=10.1177/0738894219836285|s2cid=159416397|issn=0738-8942}}</ref>

=== Coup-proofing ===
In what is referred to as "coup-proofing", regimes create structures that make it hard for any small group to seize power. These coup-proofing strategies may include the strategic placing of family, ethnic, and religious groups in the military; creation of an armed force parallel to the regular military; and development of multiple internal security agencies with overlapping jurisdiction that constantly monitor one another.<ref>{{cite web|last=T.|first=Quinlivan, James|date=1 January 2000|title=Coup-Proofing|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/reprints/RP844.html|access-date=20 January 2016|website=www.rand.org}}</ref> Research shows that some coup-proofing strategies reduce the risk of coups occurring.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=Jonathan|date=1 December 2012|title=Determinants of the Attempting and Outcome of Coups d'état|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=56|issue=6|pages=1017–1040|doi=10.1177/0022002712445732|issn=0022-0027|s2cid=54646102}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Braithwaite|first1=Jessica Maves|last2=Sudduth|first2=Jun Koga|date=1 January 2016|title=Military purges and the recurrence of civil conflict|journal=Research & Politics|volume=3|issue=1|page=2053168016630730|doi=10.1177/2053168016630730|issn=2053-1680|doi-access=free}}</ref> However, coup-proofing reduces military effectiveness,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Narang|first1=Vipin|last2=Talmadge|first2=Caitlin|date=31 January 2017|title=Civil-military Pathologies and Defeat in War|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=62|issue=7|pages=1379–1405|doi=10.1177/0022002716684627|s2cid=151897298}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Cameron S.|last2=Fariss|first2=Christopher J.|last3=McMahon|first3=R.

A 2016 study shows that the implementation of [[Order of succession|succession rules]] reduce the occurrence of coup attempts.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal|last1=Frantz|first1=Erica|last2=Stein|first2=Elizabeth A.|date=4 July 2016|title=Countering Coups Leadership Succession Rules in Dictatorships|journal=Comparative Political Studies|volume=50|issue=7|pages=935–962|doi=10.1177/0010414016655538|issn=0010-4140|s2cid=157014887}}</ref> Succession rules are believed to hamper coordination efforts among coup plotters by assuaging elites who have more to gain by patience than by plotting.<ref name=":6" />

According to political scientists Curtis Bell and Jonathan Powell, coup attempts in neighbouring countries lead to greater coup-proofing and coup-related repression in a region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Will Turkey's coup attempt prompt others nearby?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/07/30/will-turkeys-coup-attempt-prompt-others-nearby/|access-date=30 July 2016|website=Washington Post}}</ref> A 2017 study finds that countries' coup-proofing strategies are heavily influenced by other countries with similar histories.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Böhmelt|first1=Tobias|last2=Ruggeri|first2=Andrea|last3=Pilster|first3=Ulrich|date=1 April 2017|title=Counterbalancing, Spatial Dependence, and Peer Group Effects*|url=http://repository.essex.ac.uk/15571/1/Counterbalancing_Spatial_Dependence_and.pdf|journal=Political Science Research and Methods|volume=5|issue=2|pages=221–239|doi=10.1017/psrm.2015.55|issn=2049-8470}}</ref>

A 2018 study in the ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'' found that leaders who survive coup attempts and respond by purging known and potential rivals are likely to have longer tenures as leaders.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Easton|first1=Malcolm R.|last2=Siverson|first2=Randolph M.|date=2018|title=Leader survival and purges after a failed coup d'état|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=55|issue=5|pages=596–608|doi=10.1177/0022343318763713|s2cid=117585945}}</ref> A 2019 study in ''Conflict Management and Peace Science'' found that personalist dictatorships are more likely to take coup-proofing measures than other authoritarian regimes; the authors argue that this is because "personalists are characterized by weak institutions and narrow support bases, a lack of unifying ideologies and informal links to the ruler."

== Impact ==

=== Democracy ===
Research suggests that coups promoting democratization in staunchly authoritarian regimes have become less likely to end democracy over time, and that the positive influence has strengthened since the end of the Cold War.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{cite journal |title=An assessment of the 'democratic' coup theory |journal=African Security Review |date=3 July 2014 |issn=1024-6029 |pages=213–224 |volume=23 |issue=3 |doi=10.1080/10246029.2014.926949 |first=Jonathan M. |last=Powell|s2cid=58937153 }}{{paywall}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Derpanopoulos |first1=George |last2=Frantz |first2=Erica |last3=Geddes |first3=Barbara |last4=Wright |first4=Joseph |date=1 April 2017 |title=Are coups good for democracy?

A 2014 study found that "coups promote democratization, particularly among states that are least likely to democratize otherwise".<ref name=":1">{{cite journal |title=Coup d'état or Coup d'Autocracy? How Coups Impact Democratization, 1950–2008 |journal=Foreign Policy Analysis |date=1 April 2014 |issn=1743-8594 |pages=n/a |doi=10.1111/fpa.12046 |first1=Clayton L. |last1=Thyne |first2=Jonathan M. |last2=Powell}}</ref> The authors argue that coup attempts can have this consequence because leaders of successful coups have incentives to democratize quickly in order to establish political legitimacy and economic growth, while leaders who stay in power after failed coup attempts see it as a sign that they must enact meaningful reforms to remain in power.<ref name=":1" /> A 2014 study found that 40% of post-Cold War coups were successful. The authors argue that this may be due to the incentives created by international pressure.<ref name=":3" /> A 2016 study found that democracies were installed in 12% of Cold War coups and 40% of the post-Cold War coups.<ref name=":2" /> A 2020 study found that coups tended to lead to increases in state repression, not reductions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lachapelle|first=Jean|date=2019-11-21|title=No Easy Way Out: The Effect of Military Coups on State Repression|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1354–1372|doi=10.1086/707309|s2cid=222428308|issn=0022-3816}}</ref>

According to a 2020 study, "external reactions to coups play important roles in whether coup leaders move toward authoritarianism or democratic governance. When supported by external democratic actors, coup leaders have an incentive to push for elections to retain external support and consolidate domestic legitimacy. When condemned, coup leaders are apt to trend toward authoritarianism to assure their survival."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Thyne|first1=Clayton|last2=Hitch|first2=Kendall|date=2020|title=Democratic versus Authoritarian Coups: The Influence of External Actors on States' Postcoup Political Trajectories|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=64|issue=10|pages=1857–1884|doi=10.1177/0022002720935956|s2cid=222111312|issn=0022-0027}}</ref>

According to legal scholar [[Ilya Somin]] a coup to forcibly overthrow democratic government might be sometimes justified.
He wrote:
:There should be a strong presumption against forcibly removing a democratic regime. But that presumption might be overcome if the government in question poses a grave threat to human rights, or is likely to destroy democracy itself by shutting down future political competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/07/18/is-the-overthrow-of-a-democratically-elected-government-ever-justified/|title=Is the overthrow of a democratically elected government ever justified?|website=The Washington Post}}</ref>

=== Repression and counter-coups===
According to Naunihal Singh, author of ''Seizing Power: The Strategic Logic of Military Coups'' (2014), it is "fairly rare" for the prevailing existing government to violently [[purge]] the army after a coup has been foiled. If it starts the mass killing of elements of the army, including officers who were not involved in the coup, this may trigger a "counter-coup" by soldiers who are afraid they will be next. To prevent such a desperate counter-coup that may be more successful than the initial attempt, governments usually resort to firing prominent officers and replacing them with loyalists instead.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/16/12205352/turkey-coup-failed-why |title=Why Turkey's coup failed, according to an expert |author=Zack Beauchamp |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |date=16 July 2016 |accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref>

Some research suggests that increased repression and violence typically follow both successful and unsuccessful coup attempts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/02/22/are-coups-good-for-democracy/|title=Are coups good for democracy? |website=Washington Post |access-date=17 July 2016}}</ref> However, some tentative analysis by political scientist Jay Ulfelder finds no clear pattern of deterioration in human rights practices in wake of failed coups in post-Cold War era.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/dtchimp/status/754304414182019072|title=Jay Ulfelder on Twitter|access-date=17 July 2016|date=2016-07-16}}</ref>

Notable counter-coups include the [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909]], the [[1960 Laotian coups|1960 Laotian counter-coup]], the [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66]], the [[1966 Nigerian counter-coup]], the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|1967 Greek counter-coup]], [[1971 Sudanese counter-coup]], and the [[Coup d'état of December Twelfth]] in [[South Korea]].

A 2017 study finds that the use of state broadcasting by the ''putschist'' regime after [[2012 Malian coup d'état|Mali's 2012 coup]] did not elevate explicit approval for the regime.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleck |first1=Jaimie |last2=Michelitch |first2=Kristin |date=9 May 2017 |title=Capturing the Airwaves, Capturing the Nation?

According to a 2019 study, coup attempts lead to a reduction in physical integrity rights.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Curtice|first1=Travis B|last2=Arnon|first2=Daniel|date=2019-05-14|title=Deterring threats and settling scores: How coups influence respect for physical integrity rights|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|volume=37|issue=6|language=en|pages=655–673|doi=10.1177/0738894219843240|s2cid=182783295|issn=0738-8942}}</ref>

=== International response ===
The international community tends to react adversely to coups by reducing aid and imposing sanctions. A 2015 study finds that "coups against democracies, coups after the Cold War, and coups in states heavily integrated into the international community are all more likely to elicit global reaction."<ref>{{cite journal |title=The International Community's Reaction to Coups |journal=Foreign Policy Analysis |date=1 October 2015 |issn=1743-8594 |pages=363–376 |volume=11 |issue=4 |doi=10.1111/fpa.12043 |first1=Megan |last1=Shannon |first2=Clayton |last2=Thyne |first3=Sarah |last3=Hayden |first4=Amanda |last4=Dugan}}</ref> Another 2015 study shows that coups are the strongest predictor for the imposition of democratic sanctions.<ref name="Soest 17–31">{{cite journal |title=Not all dictators are equal: Coups, fraudulent elections, and the selective targeting of democratic sanctions |journal=Journal of Peace Research |date=1 January 2015 |issn=0022-3433 |pages=17–31 |volume=52 |issue=1 |doi=10.1177/0022343314551081|first1=Christian von |last1=Soest |first2=Michael |last2=Wahman|s2cid=26945588 |url=http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/42736 }}</ref> A third 2015 study finds that Western states react strongest against coups of possible democratic and human rights abuses.<ref name="Soest 17–31" /> A 2016 study shows that the international donor community in the post-Cold War period penalizes coups by reducing foreign aid.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal |title=Coups d'État and Foreign Aid |journal=World Development |date=1 March 2016 |pages=51–68 |volume=79 |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.11.004 |first=Takaaki |last=Masaki}}</ref> The US has been inconsistent in applying aid sanctions against coups both during the Cold War and post-Cold War periods, a likely consequence of its geopolitical interests.<ref name=":4" />

Organizations such as the [[African Union]] (AU) and the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) have adopted anti-coup frameworks. Through the threat of sanctions, the organizations actively try to curb coups. A 2016 study finds that the AU has played a meaningful role in reducing African coups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Powell |first1=Jonathan |last2=Lasley |first2=Trace |last3=Schiel |first3=Rebecca |date=7 January 2016 |title=Combating Coups d'état in Africa, 1950–2014 |journal=Studies in Comparative International Development |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=482–502 |doi=10.1007/s12116-015-9210-6 |s2cid=155591291 |issn=0039-3606}}</ref>

A 2017 study found that negative international responses, especially from powerful actors, have a significant effect in shortening the duration of regimes created in coups.<ref name=":7">{{cite journal |last1=Thyne |first1=Clayton |last2=Powell |first2=Jonathan |last3=Parrott |first3=Sarah |last4=VanMeter |first4=Emily |date=15 January 2017 |title=Even Generals Need Friends |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=62 |issue=7 |pages=1406–1432 |doi=10.1177/0022002716685611|s2cid=151393698 }}</ref>

According to a 2020 study, coups increase the cost of borrowing and increase the likelihood of sovereign default.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Balima|first=Hippolyte Weneyam|date=2020|title=Coups d'état and the cost of debt|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300159|journal=Journal of Comparative Economics|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=509–528|doi=10.1016/j.jce.2020.04.001|issn=0147-5967}}</ref>
