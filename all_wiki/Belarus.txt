Over 70% of Belarus's population of 9.49&nbsp;million resides in urban areas. More than 80% of the population is ethnic [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], with sizable minorities of [[Russians]], [[Poles]] and [[Ukrainians]]. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The [[Constitution of Belarus]] does not declare any official religion, although the primary religion in the country is [[Belarusian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]. The second-most widespread religion, [[Catholic Church in Belarus|Roman Catholicism]], has a much smaller following; nevertheless, Belarus celebrates both the Orthodox and the Catholic dates for Christmas and Easter as [[Public holidays in Belarus|national holidays]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://president.gov.by/special/en/holidays_en/| title=The official Internet portal of the President of the Republic of Belarus. RusPDAVersion for Visually Impaired People}}</ref> 

Belarus has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since its founding; it is also a member of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], [[Collective Security Treaty Organization|CSTO]], [[Eurasian Economic Union|EEU]], and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Belarus has shown no aspirations for joining the [[European Union]] but nevertheless maintains a [[Belarus–European Union relations|bilateral relationship with the Union]], and likewise participates in two EU projects: the [[Eastern Partnership]] and the [[Baku Initiative]].

==Etymology==<!--linked-->
The name ''Belarus'' is closely related with the term ''Belaya Rus{{'}}'', i.e., ''[[White Rus']]''. There are several claims to the origin of the name ''White Rus<nowiki>'</nowiki>''.<ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 2">{{Harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|p=2}}</ref> An ethno-religious theory suggests that the name used to describe the part of old [[Ruthenia]]n lands within the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] that had been populated mostly by [[Slavs]] who had been Christianized early, as opposed to [[Black Ruthenia]], which was predominantly inhabited by pagan [[Balts]].<ref>Аб паходжанні назваў Белая і Чорная Русь (Eng. "About the Origins of the Names of White and Black Ruthenia"), Язэп Юхо (Joseph Juho), 1956.</ref>

An alternative explanation for the name comments on the white clothing worn by the local Slavic population.<ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 2"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Minahan|1998|p=35}}</ref> A third theory suggests that the old Rus' lands that were not conquered by the [[Tatars]] (i.e., Polotsk, Vitebsk and Mogilev) had been referred to as "White Rus{{'"}}.<ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 2"/>

The name ''Rus'' is often conflated with its Latin forms ''Russia'' and ''Ruthenia'', thus Belarus is often referred to as ''White Russia'' or ''White Ruthenia''. The name first appeared in [[Middle High German literature|German]] and [[Medieval Latin literature|Latin]] [[medieval literature]]; the chronicles of [[Jan of Czarnków]] mention the imprisonment of Lithuanian grand duke [[Jogaila]] and his mother at "{{lang|la|Albae Russiae, Poloczk dicto}}" in 1381.<ref name="vauchez">{{Harvnb|Vauchez|Dobson|Lapidge|2001|p=163}}</ref> In some languages the country is often still referred to by a literal translation of "White Russia", including [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans]] (both ''{{lang|nl|Wit-Rusland}}''), and [[German language|German]] (''{{lang|de|Weißrussland}}'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/reisadviezen/inhoud/belarus-wit-rusland|title=Reisadvies Belarus (Wit-Rusland) }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Laenderinformationen/00-SiHi/BelarusSicherheit.html |title=Belarus: Reise- und Sicherheitshinweise |work=Auswärtiges Amt}}</ref> However, here too a gradual shift towards ''Belarus'' may be observed in some countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany.<ref>{{cite web |last1=De Jong |first1=Sjoerd |title=Keus tussen 'Belarus' en 'Wit-Rusland' is niet alleen taalkundig |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/09/12/keus-tussen-belarus-en-wit-rusland-is-niet-alleen-taalkundig-a4011772 |website=NRC |access-date=29 September 2020 |date=12 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Brouwers |first1=Arnout |title=Nederland erkent president Loekasjenko niet, maar EU treft nog geen sancties tegen Belarus |url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/nederland-erkent-president-loekasjenko-niet-maar-eu-treft-nog-geen-sancties-tegen-belarus~b8c78343/ |website=Volkskrant |access-date=29 September 2020 |date=23 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Klein |first1=Oliver |title=Warum Weißrussland plötzlich Belarus heißt |url=https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/weissrussland-bezeichnung-belarus-100.html |website=ZDF Heute |publisher=ZDF |access-date=29 September 2020 |date=11 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Bertolaso |first1=Marco |title=Warum auch wir von "Belarus" sprechen |url=https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/in-eigener-sache-warum-auch-wir-von-belarus-sprechen.2852.de.html?dram:article_id=481918 |website=deutschlandfunk.de |access-date=29 September 2020 |date=7 August 2020}}</ref>

The Latin term "Alba Russia" was used again by [[Pope Pius VI]] in 1783 to recognize the [[Society of Jesus]] there, exclaiming "{{lang|la|Approbo Societatem Jesu in Alba Russia degentem, approbo, approbo}}."<ref>{{Harvnb|de Courson|1879|p=281}}</ref> The first known use of ''White Russia'' to refer to Belarus was in the late-16th century by Englishman Sir [[Jerome Horsey]], who was known for his close contacts with the Russian Royal Court.<ref name="alies">{{cite book |last=Bely |first=Alies |title=The chronicle of the White Russia: an essay on the history of one geographical name |publisher=Encyclopedix |year=2000 |location=Minsk, Belarus |isbn=985-6599-12-1 }}</ref> During the 17th century, the Russian [[tsar]]s used "White Rus" to describe the lands added from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.<ref>{{Harvnb|Plokhy|2001|p=327}}</ref>

The term ''Belorussia'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Белору́ссия}}, the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я, ''Russia'') first rose in the days of the [[Russian Empire]], and the Russian Tsar was usually styled "the Tsar of All the Russias", as ''Russia'' or the ''Russian Empire'' was formed by three parts of Russia—the [[Great Russia|Great]], [[Little Russia|Little]], and [[White Ruthenia|White]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAItI5C_JPUC&q=Belorussia+Russian+Empire&pg=PA116 |title=Where Nation-States Come From: Institutional Change in the Age of Nationalism |author=Philip G.

After the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917, the term "White Russia" caused some confusion, as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Richmond|1995|p=260}}</ref> During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term ''Byelorussia'' was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, ''Byelorussia'' became commonly used in the regions of [[Białystok]] and [[Grodno]] during the interwar period.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ioffe |first=Grigory |title=Understanding Belarus and How Western Foreign Policy Misses the Mark |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc |year=2008 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00B6wxgftH8C&q=west+belarus&pg=PA150 |isbn=978-0-7425-5558-7 }}</ref>

The term ''Byelorussia'' (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus|Supreme Soviet]] of the Byelorussian SSR decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called ''Republic of Belarus'' ({{lang|ru|Республика Беларусь}} spelled in Russian), and that its abridged form should be "Belarus". The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their [[Belarusian language]] forms. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993.<ref name="bynamelaw">{{cite web |url=http://pravo.kulichki.com/zak/year1991/doc47159.htm |title=Law of the Republic of Belarus – About the name of the Republic of Belarus |access-date=6 October 2007 |date=19 September 1991 |publisher=Pravo – Law of the Republic of Belarus |language=ru }}</ref> Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the [[Constitution of Belarus]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ryder|1998|p=183}}</ref>

From 5000 to 2000 BC, [[Bandkeramik]] cultures predominated.

The region that is now Belarus was first settled by [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] tribes in the 3rd century. Around the 5th century, the area was taken over by Slavic tribes. The takeover was partially due to the lack of military coordination of the Balts but the gradual assimilation of the Balts into Slavic culture was peaceful in nature.<ref>{{harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|p=7}}</ref>

In the 9th century the territory of modern Belarus became part of [[Kievan Rus']], a vast East Slavic state ruled by the [[Rurikid]] dynasty.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
{{Further|Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
[[File:Coat of arms of White Russia (Belarus), 1581.jpg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of White Russia, 1581]]
On 2 February 1386, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] were joined in a [[personal union]] through a [[Union of Krewo|marriage of their rulers]].<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=Michael|last=Rowell|first=S.C.|contribution=Baltic Europe|title=The New Cambridge Medieval History (Vol. 6)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|page=710|isbn=0-521-36290-3}}</ref> This union set in motion the developments that eventually resulted in the formation of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], created in 1569 by the [[Union of Lublin]].{{cn|date=November 2020}}

The Lithuanian nobles were forced to go for rapprochement because of the threat coming from [[Muscovy]].
To strengthen the independence in the format of the union, three editions of the [[Statutes of Lithuania]] were issued in the 16th century.
The third Article of the Statute establishes that all lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania will be eternally in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and never enter as a part of other states. It allowed the right to own land within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to only its own families. Anyone from outside the Duchy gaining rights to a property would actually own it only after swearing allegiance to the Grand Duke of Lithuania. These articles were aimed to defend the rights of the nobility of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania nobility against Polish, Prussian and other aristocracy of [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].{{cn|date=November 2020}}

In the years following the union, the process of gradual [[Polonization]] of both Lithuanians and Ruthenians gained steady momentum. In culture and social life, both the [[Polish language]] and [[Catholicism]] became dominant, and in 1696, Polish replaced Ruthenian as the official language—with the Ruthenian language being banned from administrative use.<ref>[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=103&menu=00 "Belarusian": UCLA Language Materials Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222171418/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=103&menu=00 |date=22 December 2015 }}, ucla.edu; accessed 4 March 2016.</ref> However, the Ruthenian peasants continued to speak their own language and remained faithful to the [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church]]. Statutes were initially issued in the [[Ruthenian language]] alone and later also in Polish. Around 1840 the Statutes were banned by the Russian tsar following the [[November Uprising]]. Modern Ukrainian lands used it until 1860s.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

In a [[Russification]] drive in the 1840s, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] prohibited use of the Belarusian language in public schools, campaigned against Belarusian publications and tried to pressure those who had converted to Catholicism under the Poles to reconvert to the Orthodox faith. In 1863, economic and cultural pressure exploded in a [[January Uprising|revolt]], led by [[Konstanty Kalinowski]]. After the failed revolt, the Russian government reintroduced the use of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] to Belarusian in 1864 and no documents in Belarusian were permitted by the Russian government until 1905.<ref>{{cite book|author=D.

The [[Belarusian People's Republic]] was the first attempt to create an independent Belarusian state under name "Belarus". Despite significant efforts the state ceased to exist, primarily because the territory was continually dominated by the [[German Imperial Army]] and the [[Imperial Russian Army]] in [[World War I]], and then the [[Bolshevik]] [[Red Army]]. It existed from only 1918 to 1919 but created prerequisites for the formation of the state idea around the name "Belarus". The choice of the name was probably based on the fact that the educated core of the newly formed government was educated in the tsardom universities, with a corresponding education around the ideology of West-Russianism.<ref name="Jr.Zaprudnik2010">{{cite book|author1=Vitali Silitski, Jr.|author2=Jan Zaprudnik|title=The A to Z of Belarus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQXyAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA308|date=7 April 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4617-3174-0|pages=308–}}</ref>

The [[Republic of Central Lithuania]] was a short-lived political entity, which was the last attempt to restore Lithuania in the historical confederacy state (it was also supposed to create Lithuania Upper and Lithuania Lower). The republic was created in 1920 following [[Żeligowski's Mutiny|the staged rebellion]] of soldiers of the [[1st Lithuanian–Belarusian Division]] of the [[Polish Army]] under [[Lucjan Żeligowski]]. Centered on the historical capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Vilna]] ({{lang-lt|Vilnius}}, {{lang-pl|Wilno}}), for 18 months the entity served as a [[buffer state]] between [[Poland]], upon which it depended, and Lithuania, which claimed the area.<ref name="von Rauch">{{cite book | first=Georg von |last=Rauch |author-link=Georg von Rauch | editor=Gerald Onn | title =The Baltic States: Years of Independence – Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 1917–40 | year =1974 | pages = 100–102 | chapter =The Early Stages of Independence | chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=emBIdi4LPz8C&pg=PA101 |publisher =C.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, under international law, Belarus became the internationally recognized successor state to the Byelorussian SSR, retaining its UN membership.

===Industry===
In 2014 the share of manufacturing in GDP was 37%, more than two thirds of this amount falls on manufacturing industries. The number of people employed in industry is 32.7% of the working population. The growth rate is much lower than for the economy as a whole—about 1.9% in 2014.

After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs. At first, a policy of "Belarusianization" was followed in the newly formed Byelorussian SSR. This policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the majority of prominent Belarusian intellectuals and nationalist advocates were either exiled or killed in Stalinist purges.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tereshkovich|first=Pavel|author2=Robert J.

The last major revival of Belarusian literature occurred in the 1960s with novels published by [[Vasil Bykaŭ]] and [[Uladzimir Karatkievich]]. An influential author who devoted his work to awakening the awareness of the catastrophes the country has suffered, was [[Ales Adamovich]].

[[Music of Belarus|Music in Belarus]] largely comprises a rich tradition of folk and religious music. The country's folk music traditions can be traced back to the times of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In the 19th century, Polish composer [[Stanisław Moniuszko]] composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet [[Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich]] and created the opera ''Sialanka'' (''Peasant Woman''). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet ''[[Nightingale (ballet)|Nightingale]]'' by M. Kroshner was composed during the Soviet era and became the first Belarusian ballet showcased at the National Academic Vialiki Ballet Theatre in Minsk.<ref>{{cite news|first=Crystal|last=Zou|title=Ballets for Christmas|date=11 December 2003|url=http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/1211/wh28-1.html|work=Shanghai Star|access-date=20 December 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225084753/http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/1211/wh28-1.html|archive-date=25 February 2005}}</ref>

After the [[Second World War]], music focused on the hardships of the Belarusian people or on those who took up arms in defense of the homeland. During this period, [[Anatoly Bogatyrev]], creator of the opera ''In Polesye Virgin Forest'', served as the "tutor" of Belarusian composers.<ref name="clasmus">{{cite web|url=http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/music/Belarusian_composers_&_classical_music.htm|title=Classical Music of Belarus|publisher=Belarusguide.com|access-date=29 April 2013}}</ref> The National Academic Theatre of Ballet in Minsk was awarded the [[Prix Benois de la Danse|Benois de la Dance Prize]] in 1996 as the top ballet company in the world.<ref name="clasmus"/> Rock music has become increasingly popular in recent years, though the Belarusian government has attempted to limit the amount of foreign music aired on the radio in favor of traditional Belarusian music.

===Dress===
The traditional Belarusian dress originates from the [[Kievan Rus']] period. Due to the cool climate, clothes were designed to preserve body heat and were usually made from [[flax]] or [[wool]]. They were decorated with ornate patterns influenced by the neighboring cultures: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations. Each region of Belarus has developed specific design patterns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/clothing/index.html|title=Belarusian traditional clothing|publisher=Belarusguide.com|access-date=29 April 2013}}</ref> One ornamental pattern common in early dresses currently decorates the hoist of the [[Flag of Belarus|Belarusian national flag]], adopted in a [[1995 Belarusian referendum|disputed referendum]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fotw.fivestarflags.com/by.html#orn|title=Belarus – Ornament, Flags of the World|publisher=Fotw.fivestarflags.com|access-date=29 April 2013}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
[[File:Potato pancakes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Potato pancake|Draniki]], the national dish]]
[[Belarusian cuisine]] consists mainly of vegetables, meat (particularly pork), and bread. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or [[stewed]]. Typically, Belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals later in the day. [[Wheat]] and [[rye]] breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host traditionally presents an offering of [[bread and salt]] when greeting a guest or visitor.<ref>Canadian Citizenship and Immigration&nbsp;– [http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/belarus/eating.html Cultures Profile Project&nbsp;– Eating the Belarusian Way] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320041709/http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/belarus/eating.html |date=20 March 2007 }} (1998); retrieved 21 March 2007.</ref>
