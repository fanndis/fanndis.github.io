==Background==
Taylor Swift and [[Liz Rose]] wrote "Tim McGraw" during Swift's [[freshman year]] at [[Hendersonville High School (Tennessee)|Hendersonville High School]]. She conceived the idea in the midst of her mathematics class: "I was just sitting there, and I started humming this melody." She then related the melody to a predicament she was encountering at the moment.<ref name="albuminfo">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1546980/when-she-thinks-tim-mcgraw-taylor-swift-savors-payoff.jhtml|title=When She Thinks "Tim McGraw," Taylor Swift Savors Payoff: Hardworking Teen to Open for George Strait Next Year|date=December 1, 2006|first=Edward|last=Morris|work=[[CMT News]]|publisher=[[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]|accessdate=March 11, 2010}}</ref> Swift knew that she and her [[senior (education)|senior]] boyfriend would break up at the end of the year when he left for college. In order to cope with the complicated emotions she was experiencing, Swift wrote the song. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job, writing songs for [[Sony Music|Sony]]/[[ATV Music]], "with the idea and the melody, knowing exactly what she wanted." She desired for the song to capture the sweetness and sadness of loving and losing someone. It was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together, once he departed. "To her surprise, the first thing that came to mind was [her] love of [[Tim McGraw]]'s music."<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Parvis|first=Sarah|title=Taylor Swift|date=15 September 2009|publisher=[[Andrews McMeel Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-7407-8596-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qeCvg-69Zp8C&q=%22that%27s+your+first+single%22+%22swift%22&pg=PA24|accessdate=February 20, 2010}}</ref> Several personal details were listed for the song.

Soon after, [[Scott Borchetta]], [[CEO]] of [[Big Machine Records]], signed Swift to his newly formed label.<ref name="book" /> Early into the album production, in a meeting where Borchetta and Swift discussed potential songs for [[Taylor Swift (album)|Swift's debut album]], she performed "Tim McGraw" for Borchetta on fluke [[ukulele]]. According to Swift, as soon as Borchetta finished listening to the song, he faced Swift and said, "That's your first single." She responded, "Well. That's how that works then."<ref name="book" /> Prior to that event, Swift did not believe that the song was single material.

The video begins with Swift, dressed in a white sundress, as she lies on the grass of a lake-bed and holds a [[transistor radio]]. Suddenly, the setting is switched to Collins as he drives a white and orange 1970 [[Chevrolet C/K|Chevrolet CST-10]]. He then turns his radio on and ceases driving, coming to a complete stop on a road. As Collins facial expressions become more serious, he flashbacks to memories with Swift. Swift and Collins are seen frolicking in a field, lying beside another on the back of Collins' CST-10, staring at the stars together, holding hands as they walk, and [[slow dance|slow dancing]]. When the song is in its final chorus, Collins arrives at a wooden cabin in his pick-up truck. He runs up the staircase to discover an enveloped letter next to the door. He then sits on the staircase, opens the envelope, and reads the letter. The video transcends towards Swift playing an [[acoustic guitar]] as she leans against the wooden cabin. Cut-scenes feature Swift lying on the lake-bed and performing with a guitar next to the wooden cabin. The video concludes with Swift, once again, lying on the initial setting.

The video premiered on July 22, 2006 on [[Great American Country]].<ref name="gacpremiere" /> The video received a nomination for "Number One Streamed Video From a New Artist (Rookie of the Year Award)" at the web-hosted 2006 CMT Online Awards, but lost to [[Lindsey Haun]]'s video for "Broken".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/microsites/cmt-online-awards/2006/nominees/|title=CMT Loaded Awards 2006: Country Music Nominees and Video|work=CMT Online Awards|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> At the [[CMT Music Awards|2007 CMT Music Awards]], the video won the CMT Music Award for "Breakthrough Video of the Year".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/microsites/cmt-music-awards/archives/2007.jhtml|title=CMT Music Awards: Archives: 2007 CMT Music Awards|work=[[CMT Music Awards]]|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=December 17, 2010}}</ref> To date, the video has over 41 million views on YouTube.
