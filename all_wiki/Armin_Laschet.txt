In 2012 he became president of the state party, and he was elected Prime Minister of the state in 2017. He heads the [[Cabinet Laschet]], consisting of his own CDU and the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]].

In November 2015, Laschet visited the [[Zaatari refugee camp]] in Jordan to learn more about the plight of [[Refugees of the Syrian civil war|Syrians]] fleeing the violence in the ongoing [[Syrian civil war]] that erupted in 2011.<ref>Helmut Rehmsen (30 November 2015), [http://www.wdr2.de/aktuell/laschet-in-zaatari-100.html Gespräch mit Armin Laschet über Flüchtlinge in Jordanien: "Die Grenzen sind hier immer schon offen"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212031136/http://www.wdr2.de/aktuell/laschet-in-zaatari-100.html |date=12 December 2015 }} ''[[WDR 2]]''.</ref> Between March 2015 and January 2016, he chaired the Robert Bosch Expert Commission to Consider a Realignment of Refugee Policy, an expert group convened by the [[Robert Bosch Stiftung]].<ref>[http://www.bosch-stiftung.de/content/language2/html/67449.asp Robert Bosch Expert Commission to Consider a Realignment of Refugee Policy] [[Robert Bosch Stiftung]].</ref>

===Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, 2017–present===

Ahead of the [[2021 Christian Democratic Union of Germany leadership election|CDU's leadership election]], Laschet announced in February 2020 that he would run for the position of party chairman and his erstwhile rival [[Jens Spahn]] would stand as his deputy.<ref>Guy Chazan (February 25, 2020), [https://www.ft.com/content/7492a314-57b2-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc Armin Laschet in pole position to head Germany’s CDU] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> Polls subsequently showed voters rated Laschet's management of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] in Germany's most populous state poorly.<ref>Paul Carrel (September 13, 2020), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics/would-be-merkel-successor-laschet-loses-ground-in-local-election-win-idUSKBN2640IW?il=0 Would-be Merkel successor Laschet emboldened by local election win] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

==Political positions==
===European integration===
On European integration, Laschet seeks to strengthen the European Union on issues such as fighting international terrorism and organized crime, as well as energy policy. He also wants to see the [[President of the European Commission]] be elected directly by European voters.<ref>Melanie Amann, Peter Müller, René Pfister and Christoph Schult (25 June 2013), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/german-chancellor-merkel-cools-on-european-integration-a-907339.html Chancellor Merkel Cools on European Integration] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.</ref>

During the European debt crisis, Laschet called for an "open discussion" toward a broad solution to the debt crisis, of which [[Eurobond (eurozone)|Eurobonds]] could be a part.<ref>Jeff Black (16 August 2011), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-08-16/eurobond-support-growing-in-merkel-s-cdu-handelsblatt-reports Eurobond Support Growing in Merkel’s CDU, Handelsblatt Reports] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> He argued that a Greek exit from the [[Eurozone]] could trigger undesirable upheaval in southern Europe: "(An exit) could lead to instability in a NATO member state. Russia is standing ready with billions to help Greece in such a scenario."<ref>Matthias Sobolewski (27 August 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-greece-security-idUSBRE87Q0T120120827 German lawmakers say "Grexit" not just economic risk] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> In October 2011, he signed [[George Soros]]' open letter calling for more [[European Union|Europe]] in the single currency turmoil.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7d85abd2-f353-11e0-b11b-00144feab49a.html#axzz1bmUcohQo |title=As concerned Europeans we urge Eurozone leaders to unite |author= [[George Soros]] and 95 others|date=12 October 2011 |website=ft.com |publisher=[[Financial Times]] |access-date=17 June 2012 }}</ref>

In 2020 alone, Laschet met with [[President of France|President]] [[Emmanuel Macron]] three times. Alongside [[Jens Spahn]], Laschet was invited by Macron of France to attend the 2020 [[Bastille Day]] celebrations in Paris, in a sign of gratitude for their role in helping French citizens during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in France]].<ref>Maximilian Plück (July 14, 2020), [https://rp-online.de/politik/macron-laedt-laschet-und-spahn-zum-nationalfeiertag-ein_aid-52172701 Zeremonie in Paris: Macron lädt Laschet und Spahn zum Nationalfeiertag ein] ''[[Rheinische Post]]''.</ref> In an honour reserved for special guests, Macron invited Laschet into the Elysee gardens.<ref>Andreas Rinke and Paul Carrel (October 5, 2020), [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN26Q0MK State premier Laschet is frontrunner to succeed Merkel: party sources] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

===Social policy===
Laschet was a fierce defender of Chancellor Merkel's liberal migration policies during the [[European migrant crisis]] of 2015.<ref>Guy Chazan (February 25, 2020), [https://www.ft.com/content/7492a314-57b2-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc Armin Laschet in pole position to head Germany’s CDU] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

In 2016, Laschet dismissed proposals for a so-called [[burqa]] ban as a "phony debate" and distraction from more pressing issues. However, his party later adopted this policy as a core issue.<ref>Justin Huggler (19 August 2016), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/19/germany-proposes-burka-ban-for-schools-universities-and-public-w/ Germany proposes burka ban for schools, universities and public workers] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.</ref>

Ahead of a parliamentary vote in June 2017, Laschet expressed his opposition against Germany's introduction of [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Germany|same-sex marriage]].<ref>[https://www.welt.de/regionales/nrw/article166086465/Ehe-ist-eine-Beziehung-zwischen-Mann-und-Frau.html "Ehe ist eine Beziehung zwischen Mann und Frau"] ''[[Die Welt]]'', June 29, 2017.</ref>

In 2018, Laschet, described the [[treehouse]]s protesting the destruction of [[Hambach forest]] as "illegally occupied areas" and stated that [[RWE]] had the right to clear the forest. "The state government is there to ensure that the law that applies is enforced," he said during a talk show on German public broadcaster WDR.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/german-state-set-to-clear-out-hambach-forest-treehouses/a-45469860|title=German state set to clear out Hambach Forest treehouses {{!}} DW {{!}} 13 September 2018|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=13 September 2018}}</ref>

==Controversy==
While still an MEP and following a 2001 visit to the Middle East, Laschet reignited a controversy over EU funding for anti-Semitic [[Textbooks in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|textbooks]] used in Palestinian schools by comparing them to [[Nazi propaganda]], prompting him to urge for more stringent controls over how funds earmarked for [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authorities]] are spent.<ref>David Cronin (25 July 2001), [http://www.politico.eu/article/palestinian-books-remind-me-of-nazis-says-german-mep/ Palestinian books remind me of Nazis, says German MEP] ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref>

In 2004, the [[European Commissioner for Competition]] [[Mario Monti]] publicly rejected claims made by Laschet according to which a ban on German soccer team [[Alemannia Aachen]]’s bid to play important [[UEFA Cup]] matches in neighbouring Holland is a breach of the Union's anti-trust rules.<ref>Peter Chapman (9 June 2004), [http://www.politico.eu/article/monti-backs-uefa-foreign-stadia-rule/ Monti backs UEFA foreign stadia rule] ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref>

In 2018, Laschet cancelled his appearances at the [[Ruhrtriennale]] arts and music festival due to the festival allowing supporters of the [[BDS movement]] to perform.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.jpost.com/International/German-governor-boycotts-anti-Israel-music-festival-affiliated-with-BDS-564403 | title=German governor boycotts anti-Israel music festival affiliated with BDS}}</ref>
