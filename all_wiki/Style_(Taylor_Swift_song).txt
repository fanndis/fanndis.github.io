"'''Style'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] for her fifth studio album, ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014). Swift wrote the song with its producers [[Max Martin]], [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], and [[Ali Payami]]. "Style" was released to radio stations as the album's third single on February 9, 2015, by [[Republic Records]] in partnership with Swift's label at the time, [[Big Machine Records|Big Machine]]. Musically, the song incorporates [[funk]]-[[pop music|pop]], [[pop rock]] and [[synth-pop]]. The lyrics are ambiguous; contemporary publications interpreted the song as being about beauty standards and reflections on past romantic relationships.

The song garnered generally positive reviews from critics, many of whom deemed it the album's highlight. A few commentators found the lyrics [[clich√©]]d and shallow. It earned an [[APRA Awards (Australia)|APRA Music Award]] nomination for International Work of the Year and appeared on year-end lists of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' and ''[[The Village Voice]]''. In the US, "Style" peaked at number six on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming ''1989''{{'}}s third consecutive Hot 100 top-ten single. It received triple platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), which denotes track-equivalent sales of over three million units. "Style" also entered the top ten on charts and received [[List of music recording certifications|multi-platinum certifications]] in Australia and Canada.

Filmmaker [[Kyle Newman]] directed the song's music video featuring actor [[Dominic Sherwood]] as Swift's love interest. Premiering on February 13, 2015, the video featured a darker and more abstract atmosphere compared to those for previous ''1989'' singles "[[Shake It Off]]" and "[[Blank Space]]". Swift included "Style" on regular set lists for two of her world tours: [[The 1989 World Tour]] (2015) and the [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|Reputation Stadium Tour]] (2018).
