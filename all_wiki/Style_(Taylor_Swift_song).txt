"'''Style'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] for her fifth studio album, ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014). Swift wrote the song with its producers [[Max Martin]], [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], and [[Ali Payami]]. "Style" was released to radio stations as the album's third single on February 9, 2015, by [[Republic Records]] in partnership with Swift's label at the time, [[Big Machine Records|Big Machine]]. Musically, the song incorporates [[funk]]-[[pop music|pop]], [[pop rock]] and [[synth-pop]]. The lyrics are ambiguous; contemporary publications interpreted the song as being about beauty standards and reflections on past romantic relationships.

The song garnered generally positive reviews from critics, many of whom deemed it the album's highlight. A few commentators found the lyrics [[cliché]]d and shallow. It earned an [[APRA Awards (Australia)|APRA Music Award]] nomination for International Work of the Year and appeared on year-end lists of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' and ''[[The Village Voice]]''. In the US, "Style" peaked at number six on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming ''1989''{{'}}s third consecutive Hot 100 top-ten single. It received triple platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), which denotes track-equivalent sales of over three million units. "Style" also entered the top ten on charts and received [[List of music recording certifications|multi-platinum certifications]] in Australia and Canada.

Filmmaker [[Kyle Newman]] directed the song's music video featuring actor [[Dominic Sherwood]] as Swift's love interest. Premiering on February 13, 2015, the video featured a darker and more abstract atmosphere compared to those for previous ''1989'' singles "[[Shake It Off]]" and "[[Blank Space]]". Swift included "Style" on regular set lists for two of her world tours: [[The 1989 World Tour]] (2015) and the [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|Reputation Stadium Tour]] (2018).

==Production and release==

Inspired by [[1980s in music|pop music of the 1980s]] and its experimentation with [[synthesizer]]s, [[drum pad]]s, and overlapped vocals, [[Taylor Swift]] decided to move away from the signature [[country music|country]] styles of her previous releases and incorporate a straightforward [[Pop music|pop]] production for her fifth studio album, ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-reveals-five-things-to-expect-on-1989-65750/ |title=Taylor Swift Reveals Five Things to Expect on '1989'| first=Josh|last=Eells| work=[[Rolling Stone]]| date=September 16, 2014| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116173655/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-reveals-five-things-to-expect-on-1989-65750/ | archivedate=November 16, 2018| accessdate=November 16, 2018}}</ref><ref name="medium"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/women-in-music-2014/6363514/billboard-woman-of-the-year-taylor-swift-on-writing-her|title=Billboard Woman of the Year Taylor Swift on Writing Her Own Rules, Not Becoming a Cliche and the Hurdle of Going Pop|first=Alan|last=Light|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=December 5, 2014|access-date=February 27, 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226012450/https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/women-in-music-2014/6363514/billboard-woman-of-the-year-taylor-swift-on-writing-her|archive-date=December 26, 2014}}</ref> The recording process began in mid-2013 concurrently with the start of Swift's headlining [[The Red Tour|world tour]] in support of her fourth studio album ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]''.<ref name="Talbott">{{cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/taylor-swift-talks-next-album-cmas-and-ed-sheeran|title=Taylor Swift talks next album, CMAs and Ed Sheeran|last=Talbott|first=Chris|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=October 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026093555/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/taylor-swift-talks-next-album-cmas-and-ed-sheeran|archive-date=October 26, 2013|access-date=October 26, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Swift announced in February 2014 that she was working again with [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], with whom she had collaborated on three songs for ''Red''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/05/taylor-swift-on-new-album-dating-and-keeping-her-clothes-on/|title=Taylor Swift on new album, dating and keeping her clothes on|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=February 5, 2014|accessdate=April 3, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327204834/http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/05/taylor-swift-on-new-album-dating-and-keeping-her-clothes-on/|archive-date=March 27, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The two produced seven of the thirteen tracks for the album's standard edition; Martin also served as [[executive producer]] with Swift.<ref name="notes"/>
