The post of '''Minister for Women and Equalities''' (formerly, Minister for Women, and Minister for Women and Equality) is a ministerial position in the United Kingdom which leads the [[Government Equalities Office]]. This an independent department within the wider [[Cabinet Office]] that has responsibility for addressing all forms of discrimination, with particular emphasis on [[gender inequality]]. Prior to April 2019, the Minister was based at the [[Home Office]], [[DFID]] and [[DfE]]. Its counterpart in the shadow cabinet is the [[Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities]].

==History==
The position of Minister for Women was created by [[Tony Blair]] when he became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] as a means of prioritising women's issues across government. Prior to that, there had been an equality unit in the [[Cabinet Office]] and a [[United Kingdom cabinet committee|Cabinet committee]], which were continued under the leadership of the new minister.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/harman-heads-team-to-put-womens-issues-first-1254053.html |title=Harman heads team to put women's issues first |work=The Independent |first=Fran |last=Abrams |date=4 June 1997 |accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref> When [[Gordon Brown]] succeeded Blair, he created the post of Minister for Women and Equality to handle a wider range of equalities issues. The first Minister for Women and, ten years later, the first Minister for Women and Equality was [[Harriet Harman]]. On 12 October 2007<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/20072914.htm|title=The Transfer of Functions (Equality) Order 2007|date=2007|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref> a new department, the [[Government Equalities Office]] was created to support the minister. When [[David Cameron]] became prime minister, he gave the position its current name without a change in its responsibilities. Since its creation, the position has always been held by a minister sitting in Cabinet by virtue of another office (i.e., a Secretary of State or Leader of one of the Houses of Parliament).

[[Justine Greening]] replaced [[Nicky Morgan]] as both [[Secretary of State for Education]] and Minister for Women and Equalities when [[Theresa May]] was appointed Prime Minister on 13 July 2016. Morgan initially held the title of Minister for Women after the resignation of [[Maria Miller]] in April 2014, in conjunction with being [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]], whilst the Equalities brief was given to [[Sajid Javid]] who had replaced Miller as [[Secretary of State for Culture]]. While the Women and Equalities briefs were recombined in July 2014, the responsibility for marriage equality was assigned to [[Nick Boles]], who held the title of Minister of State for Skills, Enterprise and Equalities and had a base in both the Education and Business departments. Both splits in responsibilities were due to Nicky Morgan having voted against the legalisation of gay marriage.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/15/equalities-minister-voted-against-gay-marriage-nicky-morgan|title=Nicky Morgan's gay-marriage stance causes equalities role confusion... again|publisher=The Guardian|first=Rowena|last=Mason|date=15 July 2014|accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref>

[[Christopher James, 5th Baron Northbourne|Lord Northbourne]] has called for the creation of a minister to concentrate on issues specific to men.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/3522631.stm|title=FHM: For Him Minister?|publisher=BBC News Online|date=3 March 2004|accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>
