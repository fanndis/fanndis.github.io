'''Americans for the Arts''' is a [[nonprofit]] organization whose primary focus is advancing the [[arts]] in the [[United States]]. With offices in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[New York City]], it has a record of more than 50 years of service. Americans for the Arts is dedicated to representing and serving local communities and creating opportunities for every American to participate in and appreciate all forms of the arts.

Americans for the Arts was founded in 1996 as a result of the merger between the ''National Assembly of Local Arts Agencies'' (NALAA) and the ''American Council for the Arts'' (ACA).

==Goals==
To achieve its mission to serve, advance and lead the network of organizations and individuals who cultivate, promote, sustain and support the arts in America, Americans for the Arts is focused on four primary goals:
* Lead and serve individuals and organizations to help build environments in which the arts and arts education thrive and contribute to more vibrant and creative communities.
* Generate meaningful public and private sector policies and more leaders and resources for the arts and arts education.
* Build individual awareness and appreciation of the value of the arts and arts education.
* Ensure the operational stability of the organization and its ability to creatively respond to opportunities and challenges.

These goals are achieved in partnership with local, state and national arts organizations; government agencies; business leaders; individual philanthropists; educators; and funders throughout the country. In addition, Americans for the Arts produces annual events to heighten visibility for the arts, including the [[National Arts Awards]], which recognize those artists and arts leaders who exhibit exemplary national leadership and whose work demonstrates extraordinary artistic achievement; BCA 10,<ref>[http://www.artsusa.org/information_services/arts_and_business_partnerships/bca/programs/bca_ten/default.asp The BCA 10: Best Companies Supporting the Arts in America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816053218/http://www.artsusa.org/information_services/arts_and_business_partnerships/bca/programs/bca_ten/default.asp |date=August 16, 2011 }}</ref> which recognizes ten U.S. companies for their exceptional commitment to the arts through grants, local partnerships, volunteer programs, matching gifts, sponsorships and board membership; and the Public Leadership in the Arts Awards<ref>[http://www.artsusa.org/news/annual_awards/public_leadership/ Public Leadership in the Arts Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501163155/http://www.artsusa.org/news/annual_awards/public_leadership/ |date=May 1, 2011 }}</ref> (in cooperation with The [[United States Conference of Mayors]]) honoring elected officials in local, state and federal government for their support of the arts.

Through national visibility campaigns and local outreach, Americans for the Arts strives to motivate and mobilize opinion leaders and decision-makers who can ensure the arts thrive in America.
