'''Pride parades''' (also known as '''pride marches''', '''pride events''', and '''pride festivals''') are outdoor events celebrating [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], [[non-binary]] and [[queer]] ([[LGBTQ]]) social and self acceptance, achievements, [[LGBT rights by country or territory|legal rights]], and [[gay pride|pride]]. The events also at times serve as demonstrations for legal rights such as [[same-sex marriage]]. Most pride events occur annually, and many take place around June to commemorate the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]] in [[New York City LGBT Pride March|New York City]], a pivotal moment in modern [[LGBT social movements|LGBTQ social movements]].<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/blog/2011/06/09/pride-parade/ |title=How the Pride Parade Became Tradition |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422105803/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/blog/2011/06/09/pride-parade/ |archive-date=2016-04-22 |accessdate=2017-07-01}}</ref> The parades seek to create community and honor the history of the movement.

In 1970, pride and protest marches were held in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco around the first anniversary of Stonewall.  The events became annual and grew internationally. In 2019, New York and the world celebrated the [[list of largest LGBT events|largest international Pride celebration]] in history: [[Stonewall 50 – WorldPride NYC 2019|Stonewall 50 - WorldPride NYC 2019]], produced by [[Heritage of Pride]] commemorating the 50th anniversary of the [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall Riots]], with five million attending in [[LGBT culture in New York City|Manhattan]] alone.<ref name="Authorities1">[https://abcnews.go.com/US/million-people-crowed-nyc-worldpride-mayor/story?id=64090338] Accessed July 3, 2019.</ref>

In 1965, the [[gay rights]] protest movement was visible at the [[Annual Reminder]] pickets, organized by members of the lesbian group [[Daughters of Bilitis]], and the gay men's group [[Mattachine Society]]. Mattachine members were also involved in demonstrations in support of homosexuals imprisoned in [[Cuba]]n [[labor camp]]s. All of these groups held protests at the [[United Nations]] and the [[White House]], in 1965.<ref name=DB>{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/fidel-castros-horrific-record-on-gay-rights|title=Fidel Castro's Horrific Record on Gay Rights|date=27 November 2016|journal=Daily Beast|last1=Kirchick|first1=James}}</ref> Early on the morning of Saturday, [[Stonewall riots|June 28, 1969, LGBTQ people rioted]] following a [[police raid]] on the [[Stonewall Inn]] in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[Lower Manhattan]], New York City.<ref name="NyTimes">''The New York Times'', June 29, 1969</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/~lbarr2/gws250spring11_files/Page1186.htm|title=Brief History of the Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement in the U.S.|publisher=University of Kentucky|accessdate=July 14, 2018}}</ref> The Stonewall Inn was a [[gay bar]] which catered to an assortment of patrons, but which was popular with the most marginalized people in the gay community: transvestites, [[transgender]] people, [[effeminacy|effeminate young men]], hustlers, and homeless youth.<ref>{{cite book | last=Carter | first=David | title=Stonewall: The rebellion That Sparked the Gay Revolution | edition=First | location=New York | publisher=Macmillan | year=2005 | isbn=0-312-34269-1 | pages=77,257| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kS_mbbirLz4C&q=stonewall+1967+beard&pg=PA77}}</ref>

==First pride marches==

On Saturday, June 27, 1970, Chicago Gay Liberation organized a march<ref name="Chicago Tribune">''Chicago Tribune'', June 28, 1970, p. A3</ref> from [[Washington Square Park, Chicago|Washington Square Park]] ("Bughouse Square") to the [[Chicago Water Tower|Water Tower]] at the intersection of [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan]] and [[Chicago Avenue|Chicago]] avenues, which was the route originally planned, and then many of the participants spontaneously marched on to the [[Richard J. Daley Center#Daley Plaza|Civic Center (now Richard J. Daley) Plaza]].<ref name="CGP1971w">{{cite web|url= http://www.newberry.org/outspoken/exhibit/objectlist_section3.html |title= Outspoken: Chicago's Free Speech Tradition |publisher= Newberry Library |accessdate=2008-09-07}}</ref> The date was chosen because the Stonewall events began on the last Saturday of June and because organizers wanted to reach the maximum number of Michigan Avenue shoppers. Subsequent Chicago parades have been held on the last Sunday of June, coinciding with the date of many similar parades elsewhere.

The West Coast of the United States saw a march in San Francisco on June 27, 1970 and 'Gay-in' on June 28, 1970<ref>{{Cite web|title=Labor of Love: The Birth of San Francisco Pride 1970~1980|url=https://www.glbthistory.org/labor-of-love|url-status=dead|website=GBLT Historical Society|access-date=July 21, 2020|archive-date=July 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200722063420/https://www.glbthistory.org/labor-of-love}}</ref> and a march in Los Angeles on June 28, 1970.<ref name="SFChron">''The San Francisco Chronicle'', June 29, 1970</ref><ref name="CanPress">"As of early 1970, Neil Briggs became the vice-chairman of the LGBTQ Association", CanPress, February 28, 1970. http://www.pridetoronto.com/about/volunteer-comittees-cordinators/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702034214/http://www.pridetoronto.com/about/volunteer-comittees-cordinators/ |date=July 2, 2017 }}</ref> In Los Angeles, [[Morris Kight]] (Gay Liberation Front LA founder), [[Troy Perry|Reverend Troy Perry]] (Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches founder) and Reverend Bob Humphries (United States Mission founder) gathered to plan a commemoration. They settled on a parade down Hollywood Boulevard. But securing a permit from the city was no easy task. They named their organization Christopher Street West, "as ambiguous as we could be."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dudley Clendinen|first1=Adam Nagourney|title=Out For Good: The Struggle to Build a Gay Rights Movement in America|date=2013|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781476740713|page=58}}</ref> But Rev.

After the American Civil Liberties Union stepped in, the commission dropped all its requirements but a $1,500 fee for police service. That, too, was dismissed when the California Superior Court ordered the police to provide protection as they would for any other group. The eleventh hour California Supreme Court decision ordered the police commissioner to issue a parade permit citing the “constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression.” From the beginning, L.A. parade organizers and participants knew there were risks of violence. Kight received death threats right up to the morning of the parade. Unlike later editions, the first gay parade was very quiet. The marchers convened on McCadden Place in [[Hollywood]], marched north and turned east onto Hollywood Boulevard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gay Pride 1973|url=http://morriskight.blogspot.com/2012/10/gay-pride-1973.html |website=morriskight.blogspot.com}}</ref> ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' reported "Over 1,000 homosexuals and their friends staged, not just a protest march, but a full-blown parade down world-famous Hollywood Boulevard."<ref>{{cite news|title=#TBT: What Gay Pride Looked Like in 1970|url=http://www.advocate.com/pride/2014/06/05/tbt-what-gay-pride-looked-1970|publisher=The Advocate|date=June 5, 2014}}</ref>

On Sunday, June 28, 1970, at around noon, in New York gay [[activism|activist]] groups held their own pride parade, known as the [[Christopher Street|Christopher Street Liberation Day]], to recall the events of Stonewall one year earlier. On November 2, 1969, [[Craig Rodwell]], his partner Fred Sargeant, [[Ellen Broidy]], and Linda Rhodes proposed the first gay pride parade to be held in New York City by way of a resolution at the [[Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations]] (ERCHO) meeting in [[Philadelphia]].<ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-22/news/1970-a-first-person-account-of-the-first-gay-pride-march// Sargeant, Fred.

The first marches were both serious and fun, and served to inspire the widening activist movement; they were repeated in the following years, and more and more annual marches started up in other cities throughout the world. In [[Atlanta]] and New York City the marches were called ''Gay Liberation Marches'', and the day of celebration was called "Gay Liberation Day"; in Los Angeles and San Francisco they became known as 'Gay Freedom Marches' and the day was called "Gay Freedom Day". As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem [[heteronormative]] and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this [[queer culture]] into the space. The marches spread internationally, including to [[Pride in London|London]] where the first "gay pride rally" took place on 1 July 1972, the date chosen deliberately to mark the three-year anniversary of the [[Stonewall riots]].

In the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement. Activists of a less radical nature began taking over the march committees in different cities,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kolher|first1=Will|title=June 28, 1970 – From Liberation to Pride: The 45th Anniversary of the Christopher Street Liberation Day March – Rare Video|url=http://www.back2stonewall.com/2015/06/june-28-1970-liberation-pride-45th-anniversary-christopher-street-liberation-day-march-rare-video.html|accessdate=December 11, 2017|publisher=back2stonewall.com|date=June 28, 2015}}</ref> and they dropped "Gay Liberation" and "Gay Freedom" from the names, replacing them with "Gay Pride".

==Description==
[[File:Gay parade.jpg|thumb|Gay Pride Parade in New York City, 2008]]
Many parades still have at least some of the original political or [[activism|activist]] character, especially in less accepting settings. The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even [[Mardi Gras]]-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, [[drag queen]]s and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es, [[United Church of Christ]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] Churches, [[PFLAG]], and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.

Even the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of [[AIDS]] and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and [[corporate sponsorship|corporate sponsors]] and promoted as major [[tourist attraction]]s for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.

Though the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people, and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named ''Gay'', the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary for Sylvia Rae Rivera|url=http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|publisher=Sylvia's Place|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113130/http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|archive-date=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gender.org/remember/people/marshajohnson.html |title=Marsha P.

By the late 1970s and early 1980s, as many of the actual participants had grown older, moved on to other issues, or died, this passage of time led to misunderstandings as to who had actually participated in the Stonewall riots, who had actually organized the subsequent demonstrations, marches and memorials, and who had been members of early activist organizations such as Gay Liberation Front and Gay Activists Alliance. The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events.<ref>[http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html New York Area Bisexual Network: A Brief History of NYC's Bisexual Community]. Nyabn.org (July 12, 2001). Retrieved on 2011-07-10.</ref> Changing first to ''Lesbian and Gay'', today most are called ''Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender'' (LGBT) or simply "Pride".

The main parade, which is also partly funded by the city's municipality, was one of the largest ever to take place in Israel, with approximately 200,000 participants. The first [[Tel Aviv Pride|Pride parade in Tel Aviv]] took place in 1993.

On June 30, 2005, the fourth annual Pride march of [[Jerusalem]] took place. The Jerusalem parade has been met with resistance due to the high presence of religious bodies in the city. It had originally been prohibited by a municipal ban which was canceled by the court. Many of the religious leaders of Jerusalem's [[Muslim]], [[Jewish]], and [[Christians|Christian]] communities had arrived to a rare consensus asking the municipal government to cancel the permit of the paraders.

Another parade, this time billed as an international event, was scheduled to take place in the summer of 2005, but was postponed to 2006 due to the stress on police forces during the summer of [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan]]. In 2006, it was again postponed due to the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict|Israel-Hezbollah war]]. It was scheduled to take place in Jerusalem on November 10, 2006, and caused a wave of protests by [[Haredi]] Jews around central Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=114609 |title=9 Protesters Detained at Anti-Gay Pride Demonstration |publisher=[[Arutz 7]] |date=November 1, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The [[Israeli Police|Israel National Police]] had filed a petition to cancel the parade due to foreseen strong opposition.

June 21, 2007, the [[Jerusalem Open House]] organization succeeded in staging a parade in central Jerusalem after police allocated thousands of personnel to secure the general area. The rally planned afterwards was canceled due to an unrelated national fire brigade strike which prevented proper permits from being issued. The parade was postponed once more in 2014, as a result of [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|Protective Edge]] Operation.

{{See also|LGBT rights in the Philippines}}
On June 26, 1994, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, Progressive Organization of Gays in the Philippines (ProGay Philippines) and Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) Manila organized the first LGBT Pride March in Philippines, marching from EDSA corner Quezon Avenue to Quezon City Memorial Circle ([[Quezon City]], Metro Manila, Philippines) and highlighting broad social issues. At Quezon City Memorial Circle, a program was held with a Queer Pride Mass and solidarity remarks from various organizations and individuals.

In 1995 MCC, ProGay Philippines and other organizations held internal celebrations. In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reachout AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. In 1998, the year of the centennial commemoration of the Republic of the Philippines, a Gay and Lesbian Pride March was incorporated in the mammoth "citizens' parade" which was part of the official centennial celebration. That parade culminated in "marching by" the President of the Philippines, His Excellency Joseph Estrada, at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta Park in Manila.

In 1999, Task Force Pride Philippines (TFP), a network of LGBT and LGBT-friendly groups and individuals seeking to promote positive visibility for the LGBT community was born. Since then, TFP has been organizing the annual Metro Manila Pride March. In 2003, a decision was made to move the Pride March from June to the December Human Rights Week to coincide with related human rights activities such as World AIDS Day (December 1), Philippine National Lesbian Day (December 8), and International Human Rights Day (December 10).

On December 10, 2005, the First LGBT Freedom March, with the theme "CPR: Celebrating Pride and Rights" was held along the streets of España and Quiapo in Manila, Philippines. Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.
On December 6, 2014, Philippines will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Metro Manila Pride March with the theme: Come Out For Love ''Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin'' (Come Out For Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.

The 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on 25 July. The turnout of the event was an estimated number of 2,000 participants.<ref>{{cite web |last1=De La Cruz |first1=Christa |title=Pride March 2015: Filipino LGBTQs Make History in Luneta |url=http://www.choosephilippines.com/do/history-and-culture/3182/pride-march-2015-filipino-lgbtqs-history-luneta/ |website=ChoosePhilippines |accessdate=7 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919184021/http://www.choosephilippines.com/do/history-and-culture/3182/pride-march-2015-filipino-lgbtqs-history-luneta/ |archive-date=September 19, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The following 2016 Metro Manila Pride March was themed Let Love In.

===Europe===
====South-Eastern Europe====
The first South-Eastern European Pride, called ''The Internationale Pride'', was assumed to be a promotion of the human right to freedom of assembly in [[Croatia]] and some Eastern European states, where such rights of the LGBT population are not respected, and a support for organising the first Prides in those communities. Out of all ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states, at that time only [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from June 22–25, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and [[Balkans|Southeastern European]] countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Latvia]] have been organizing Prides. [[Slovakia]] also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from [[Slovenska pospolitost]] (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). [[Republic of Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Albania]] also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. [[Lithuania]] has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from [[Kosovo]], that participated apart from Serbia. It was the first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was [[Zagreb Pride]], which has been held since 2002.

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
The first [[Sarajevo Pride|Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan ''Ima Izać' '' (Coming Out). Around 4000 people, including foreign diplomats, members of the local government and celebrities participated amidst a strong police presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ba.n1info.com/Vijesti/a376875/Bez-ijednog-incidenta-Zavrsena-prva-Bh.-povorka-ponosa-u-Sarajevu.html|title=Bez ijednog incidenta: Završena prva Bh. povorka ponosa u Sarajevu|publisher=N1}}</ref>

====Bulgaria====
Like the other countries from the [[Balkan]]s, Bulgaria's population is very conservative when it comes to issues like [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]]. Although homosexuality was decriminalized in 1968, people with different sexual orientations and identities are still not well accepted in society. In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the [[LGBT]] community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by [[skinhead]]s, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto "Rainbow Friendship" attracted more than 300 participants from [[Bulgaria]] and tourists from [[Greece]] and [[UK|Great Britain]]. There were no disruptions and the parade continued as planned. A third Pride parade took place successfully in 2010, with close to 800 participants and an outdoor concert event.

====Croatia====
{{see also|LGBT rights in Croatia#LGBT prides and other marches}}
First pride parade in Croatia was held on 29 June 2002 in [[Zagreb Pride|Zagreb]] and has been held annually ever since. The attendance has gradually grown from 350 in 2002 to 15.000 in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zagreb-pride.net/hr/povorka-ponosa/povijest-povorke-ponosa-u-zagrebu/|title=Povijest Povorke ponosa u Zagrebu - Zagreb Pride}}</ref> Pride parades are also held in [[Split Pride|Split]] (since 2011) and [[Osijek Pride|Osijek]] (since 2014).

====Denmark====

The [[Copenhagen Pride]] festival is held every year in August. In its current format, it has been held every year since 1996, where Copenhagen hosted EuroPride. Before 1994 the national LGBT association organised demonstration-like freedom marches. Copenhagen Pride is a colourful and festive occasion, combining political issues with concerts, films and a parade. The focal point is the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]] in the city centre. It usually opens on the Wednesday of Pride Week, culminating on the Saturday with a parade and Denmark's Mr Gay contest. In 2017, some 25,000 people took part in the parade with [[float (parade)|floats]] and flags, and about 300,000 were out in the streets to experience it.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kæmpe-optog: 300.000 følger Pride gennem København|url=https://www.avisen.dk/300000-foelger-farverigt-optog-i-hovedstadens-gader_458063.aspx|publisher=avisen.dk |date=19 August 2017|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>

====Germany====
[[File:CSD Berlin 2007 - Partytruck 1.jpg|thumb|[[Berlin Pride]]]]
Both [[Berlin Pride]] and [[Cologne Pride]] claim to be one of the biggest in Europe. The first so-called Gay Freedom Day took place on June 30, 1979, in both cities. Berlin Pride parade is now held every year the last Saturday in July. Cologne Pride celebrates two weeks of supporting cultural programme prior to the parade taking place on Sunday of the first July weekend. An alternative march used to be on the Saturday prior to the Cologne Pride parade, but now takes place a week earlier. Pride parades in Germany are often called [[Christopher Street Day]]s - named after the street where the Stonewall Inn was located.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.europeana.eu/2019/06/symbols-of-pride-the-cultural-heritage-of-lgbtq-activism/|title=Symbols of Pride: the cultural heritage of LGBTQ+ activism|last=Murphy|first=Adrian|website=[[Europeana]] (CC By-SA|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>

====Ireland====
The [[Dublin Pride]] Festival usually takes place in June. The Festival involves the Pride Parade, the route of which is from [[O'Connell Street]] to [[Merrion Square]]. However, the route was changed for the 2017 Parade due to [[Luas Cross City]] works.
The parade attracts thousands of people who line the streets each year. It gained momentum after the [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|2015 Marriage Equality Referendum]].

[[File:Arcilesbica - Striscione al Gay Pride nazionale di Grosseto (2004).jpg|thumb|right|Italian lesbian organisation Arcilesbica at the National Italian Gay Pride march in [[Grosseto]], Italy, in 2004]]

The first public demonstration by gay people in Italy took place in [[Sanremo|San Remo]] on April 5, 1972, and was in protest against the International Congress on Sexual Deviance organized by the Catholic-inspired Italian Center of Sexology. The event was attended by about forty people belonging to various homophile groups, including ones from France, Belgium, Great Britain's Gay Liberation Front, and Italy's activist homosexual rights group ''{{ill|Fuori!|it}}''.<ref name="Barilli-1999">{{cite book |language=it |last1=Rossi Barilli |first1=Gianni |title=Il movimento gay in Italia |trans-title=The Gay Movement in Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2cJ1zT70ucwC |publisher=[[Feltrinelli (publisher)|Feltrinelli]] |location=Milano |year=1999 |isbn=88-07-81559-1 |oclc=801192305 |series=Universale economica}}</ref>{{rp|54–59}}

The first Italian event specifically associated with international celebrations of Gay Pride was the sixth congress of ''Fuori!'' held in [[Turin]] in late June 1978 and included a week of films on gay subjects.<ref name="Barilli-1999"/>{{rp|103}}  Episodes of violence against homosexuals were frequent in Italy, such as in the summer of 1979 when two young gay men were killed in [[Livorno]]. In [[Pisa]] in November of that year, the {{ill|Orfeo Collective|it|Collettivo Omosessuale Orfeo}} organized the first march against anti-gay violence.  Around 500 gay and lesbian participants attended, and this remained the largest gathering of the kind until 1994.<ref name="Barilli-1999"/>{{rp|122–124}}

Later, a system of "national Pride" observances designated one city to hold the official events, starting with Rome in 1994. Starting in 2013, the organization Onda Pride organized additional events, and in 2017 events were organized in 24 cities nationwide under its auspices.

====Latvia====
{{Main|Riga Pride and Friendship Days}}

On July 22, 2005, the first Latvian gay pride march took place in [[Riga]], surrounded by protesters. It had previously been banned by the [[Riga City Council]], and the then-[[Prime Minister of Latvia]], [[Aigars Kalvītis]], opposed the event, stating Riga should "not promote things like that", however a court decision allowed the march to go ahead.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4708617.stm | work=BBC News | title=Latvia gay pride given go-ahead | date=July 22, 2005 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> In 2006, LGBT people in Latvia attempted a Parade but were assaulted by "No Pride" protesters, an incident sparking a storm of international media pressure and protests from the European Parliament at the failure of the Latvian authorities to adequately protect the Parade so that it could proceed.

In 2007, following international pressure, a Pride Parade was held once again in Riga with 4,500 people parading around [[Vērmane Garden]], protected physically from "No Pride" protesters by 1,500 [[State Police (Latvia)|Latvian police]], with ringing the inside and the outside of the iron railings of the park. Two fire crackers were detonated with one being thrown from outside at the end of the festival as participants were moving off to the buses. A man and his son were afterwards arrested by the police.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.lsm.lv/raksts/zinas/latvija/baltijas-praida-2012-gajienu-ar-svilpieniem-sagaida-vairaki-protestetaji.a6934/|title="Baltijas praida 2012" gājienu ar svilpieniem sagaida vairāki protestētāji|date=2012-06-02|website=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]]|language=lv|access-date=2019-05-19}}</ref> This caused some alarm but no injury, although participants did have to run the gauntlet of "No Pride" abuse as they ran to the buses. They were driven to a railway station on the outskirts of Riga, from where they went to a post Pride "relax" at the seaside resort of [[Jūrmala]]. Participants included [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], [[Amnesty International]] observers and random individuals who travelled from abroad to support LGBT Latvians and their friends and families.

In 2008, the Riga Pride was held in the historically potent 11. novembra krastmala (November 11 [[Bank (geography)|Embankment]]) beneath the [[Riga Castle]]. The participants heard speeches from MEPs and a message of support from the [[President of Latvia|Latvian President]]. The embankment was not open and was isolated from the public with some participants having trouble getting past police cordons. About 300 ''No Pride'' protesters gathered on the bridges behind barricades erected by the police who kept Pride participants and the "No Pride" protesters separated. Participants were once more "bused" out but this time a 5-minute journey to central Riga.

In 2009, the annual Baltic Pride was launched, with the first edition being held in Riga with a march. This event and the following ones have been held without serious incidents.

The 2012 Baltic Pride was held on June 2. The parade marched through Tērbatas street from the corner of Ģertrūdes street towards Vērmane Garden, where concerts and a conference were held. The events were attended by the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to Latvia|United States Ambassador to Latvia]] [[Judith G. Garber|Judith Garber]] and the Latvian [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Latvia)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Edgars Rinkēvičs]].<ref name=":1" />

In 2015, Riga hosted the pan-European [[Europride|EuroPride]] event with about 5000 participants engaging in approximately 50 cultural and entertainment events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ir.lv/2015/06/20/eiropraida-riga-piedalijusies-aptuveni-5000-cilveku/|title=Eiropraidā Rīgā piedalījušies aptuveni 5000 cilvēku • IR.lv|date=2015-06-20|website=[[Ir (newspaper)|Ir.lv]]|language=lv-LV|access-date=2019-05-19}}</ref>

====Lithuania====
In 2010 first pride parade - the 2nd [[Baltic Pride]] - in [[Lithuania]] was held in [[Vilnius]]. About 300 foreign guests marched through the streets along the local participants. Law was enforced with nearly a thousand policemen.

The city also hosted the event in 2013 and 2016 gathering around 3 thousand participants each year.

The 2019 Baltic Pride was held on June 4–9 in Vilnius. An estimated 10 thousand people marched through the central part of the city.

====Netherlands====

The [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], a Gay Pride has been held since 1996. The week(end)-long event involves concerts, sports tournaments, street parties and most importantly the Canal Pride, a parade on boats on the canals of Amsterdam. In 2008 three government ministers joined on their own boat, representing the whole cabinet. Mayor of Amsterdam [[Job Cohen]] also joined. About 500,000 visitors were reported. 2008 was also the first year large Dutch international corporations [[ING Group]] and [[TNT NV]] sponsored the event.

The oldest pride parade in Poland, the [[Equality Parade in Warsaw]], has been organized since 2001. In 2005, the parade was forbidden by local authorities (including then-Mayor [[Lech Kaczyński]]) but occurred nevertheless. The ban was later declared a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights ([[Bączkowski and Others v. Poland]]). In 2008, more than 1,800 people joined the march. In 2010 EuroPride took place in Warsaw with approximately 8,000 participants. The last parade in Warsaw, in 2019, drew 80,000 people. Other Polish cities which host pride parades are [[Kraków]], [[Łódź]], [[Poznań]], [[Gdańsk]], [[Toruń]], [[Wrocław]], [[Lublin]], [[Częstochowa]], [[Rzeszów]], [[Opole]], [[Zielona Góra]], [[Konin]], [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Szczecin]], [[Kalisz]], [[Koszalin]], [[Olsztyn]], [[Kielce]], [[Gniezno]], [[Katowice]], [[Białystok]], [[Radomsko]], [[Płock]].

On June 30, 2001, several [[LGBT rights in Serbia|Serbian LGBTQ groups]] attempted to hold the country's first Pride march in [[Belgrade]]. When the participants started to gather in one of the city's principal squares, a huge crowd of opponents attacked the event, injuring several participants and stopping the march. The police were not equipped to suppress riots or protect the Pride marchers. Some of the victims of the attack took refuge in a student cultural centre, where a discussion was to follow the Pride march. Opponents surrounded the building and stopped the forum from happening.

However, due to the heavy public threats of violence made by extreme right organisations, Ministry of Internal Affairs in the morning of September 19 moved the location of the march from the city centre to a space near the [[Palace of Serbia]] therefore effectively banning the original 2009 Belgrade Pride.<ref>

====Slovenia====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
Although first LGBTQ festival in [[Slovenia]] dates to 1984, namely the Ljubljana Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the first pride parade was only organized in 2001 after a gay couple was asked to leave a [[Ljubljana]] café for being homosexual. Ljubljana pride is traditionally supported by the mayor of Ljubljana and left-wing politicians, most notably the Interior minister [[Katarina Kresal]], who joined both the 2009 and 2010 parade. Some individual attacks on activists have occurred.

Madrid Pride Parade, known as ''Fiesta del Orgullo Gay'' (or simply ''Fiesta del Orgullo''), ''Manifestación Estatal del Orgullo LGTB'' and ''Día del Orgullo Gay'' (or simply ''Día del Orgullo''), is held the first Saturday after June 28<ref name="López2015">{{cite book|author=Enrique Ávila López|title=Modern Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjkVCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA399|date=7 December 2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-601-2|pages=399–}}</ref> since 1979.<ref name="Spain decriminalized '79">{{cite news|title=Where is it illegal to be gay?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-25927595|work=BBC|date=February 10, 2014}}</ref>

The event is organised by [[COGAM]] (Madrid GLTB Collective) and [[FELGTB]] (Spanish Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Transsexuals and Bisexuals) and supported by other national and international LGTB groups. The first Gay Pride Parade in Madrid was held in June 1979 nearly four years after the death of Spain's dictator [[Francisco Franco]], with the gradual arrival of democracy and the de-criminalization of homosexuality. Since then, dozens of companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Google]] and [[Schweppes]] and several political parties and trade unions, including [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|PODEMOS]], [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], [[Union, Progress and Democracy]], [[CCOO]] and [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]] have been sponsoring and supporting the parade. Madrid Pride Parade is the biggest gay demonstration in Europe, with more than 1.5 million attendees in 2009, according to the [[Spanish government]].

In 2007, [[Europride]], the European Pride Parade, took place in [[Madrid]]. About 2.5 million people attended more than 300 events over one week in the Spanish capital to celebrate Spain as the country with the most developed LGBT rights in the world. Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district [[Chueca]], the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful. [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]] and [[Seville]] hold also local Pride Parades. In 2008 [[Barcelona]] hosted the [[EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)|Eurogames]].

In 2014, Winter Pride Maspalomas was held for the first time at [[Maspalomas]], [[Gran Canaria, Canary Islands]], one of one Europe's most popular LGTB tourist destinations. Within a few years of its existence, Winter Pride Maspalomas became a major Pride celebration within Spain and Europe. During its 6th edition in November 2019, the Pride Walk LGBT equal rights march had over 18,000 international visitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20191204/472058971346/la-sexta-edicion-del-winter-pride-maspalomas-duplico-los-asistentes.html|title=La sexta edición del Winter Pride Maspalomas duplicó los asistentes|accessdate=2019-12-09|language=es}}</ref>

On June 28, 2020, on the 51st anniversary of the Stonewall riots, the Queer Liberation March Protest in New York City clashed with [[New York Police Department]] officers. Police alleged that this feud started as a result of a participant vandalizing an NYPD vehicle. Participants claimed tensions began when police attempted to arrest one protester, leading to them beginning to arrest other protestors.

The [[São Paulo Gay Pride Parade]] happens in [[Paulista Avenue]], in the city of [[São Paulo]], since 1997. The 2006 parade was named the biggest pride parade of the world at the time by ''[[Guinness World Records]]''; it typically rivals the [[New York City Pride March]] as the largest pride parade in the world.<ref name=NYCWorld'sLargestPrideParade/> In 2010, the city hall of São Paulo invested R$1 million in the parade.

The Pride Parade is heavily supported by the federal government as well as by the Governor of São Paulo, the event counts with a solid security plan, many politicians show up to open the main event and the government not rarely parades with a float with politicians on top of it. In the Pride the city usually receives about 400,000 tourists and moves between R$180 million and R$190 million.

The Pride and its associated events are organized by the ''Associação da Parada do Orgulho de Gays, Lésbicas, Bissexuais e Travestis e Transsexuais'', since its foundation in 1999. The march is the event's main activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities, and the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route. In 2009, 3.2 million people attended the 13th annual Gay Pride Parade.

The second biggest Pride Parade in Brazil is [[Rio de Janeiro]] Gay Pride Parade, numbering about 2 million people, traditionally taking place in [[Zona Sul]] or Rio's most affluent neighborhoods between the city center and the world-famous oceanic beaches, which usually happens in the second part of the year, when it is winter or spring in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], generally characterizing milder weather for Rio de Janeiro (about 15[[Celsius|°C]] in difference), except for occasional stormy cold fronts. The Rio de Janeiro Gay Pride Parade and its associated events are organized by the NGO Arco-Íris ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''rainbow''). The group is one of the founders of the [[Associação Brasileira de Gays, Lésbicas, Bissexuais, Travestis e Transexuais]] (Brazilian Association of Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, Transvestites (this word used as a synonym for transgender persons in Brazil) and Transsexuals). Other Pride Parades which happen in [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]] take place in [[Niterói]], Rio de Janeiro's ex-capital in the times when Rio was the Brazilian capital and a separated [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], and [[Nova Iguaçu]], where about 800,000 persons live and is located in the center of [[Baixada Fluminense]], which compose all northern suburban cities of Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area numbering 3.5 million people.

==Opposition==

There is opposition to pride events both within LGBT and mainstream populations.

Critics, such as [[Gay Shame]], charge the parades with an undue emphasis on sex and [[sexual fetish|fetish-related]] interests, which they see as counterproductive to LGBT interests, and expose the "gay community" to ridicule. LGBT activists{{Who|date=July 2010}} counter that traditional media have played a role in emphasizing the most outlandish and therefore non-representative aspects of the community. This in turn has prompted participants to engage in more flamboyant costumes to gain media coverage.

Various critics have denounced what they view as a ''[[merchandization]]'' of Pride parades.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://blogs.publico.es/shangaylily/2014/07/02/gaypitalismo-orgullo-empresarial/ Gaypitalismo: Orgullo Empresarial.] Público. 2 July 2014</ref><ref>{{in lang|es}} [https://www.diagonalperiodico.net/cuerpo/27129-mercadeo-rosa-para-la-amnesia-del-movimiento.html Mercadeo rosa para la amnesia del movimiento.] Diagonal Periódico. 2 July 2015</ref><ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/06/28/lgbt-night-march-decries-prides-corporate-sponsorship.html LGBT Night March decries Pride’s corporate sponsorship.] The Star. 28 June 2016</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/san-francisco-gay-pride-corporate-orlando-shooting Too straight, white and corporate: why some queer people are skipping SF Pride.] The Guardian. 25 June 2016</ref>

[[Socially conservative|Social conservatives]] are sometimes opposed to such events because they view them to be contrary to public morality. This belief is partly based on certain displays often found in the parades, such as public nudity, [[BDSM]] paraphernalia, and other sexualized features. Within the academic community, there has been criticism that the parades actually set to strengthen homosexual-heterosexual divides and increase essentialist views.
