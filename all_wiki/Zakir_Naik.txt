===Opposition to the partition of India===
Zakir Naik [[opposition to the partition of India|criticized the partition of India and creation of Pakistan]], calling it a tragedy.<ref name="Gupta2016">{{cite web |last1=Gupta |first1=Shekhar |title=Why Zakir Naik is dangerous |url=https://www.rediff.com/news/column/why-zakir-naik-is-dangerous/20160718.htm |publisher=[[Rediff]] |accessdate=29 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Naik holds that those who advocated the creation of Pakistan out of the northwestern provinces of colonial India were "not even practising Muslims".<ref name="Gupta2016"/>

===Music===
Naik equates music with alcohol and says that both are intoxicating in nature. He has condemned dancing and singing because he claims they are prohibited in Islam.<ref name="hp10" />

===Punishment for stealing===
Naik said that guilty people must be punished and accepts [[Hudud|chopping off hands]] for stealing. He has also recommended that the United States implements this logic in order to reduce criminality.<ref name="hp10" />

===Biological evolution===
Dismissing [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] ''[[Theory of Evolution]]'',<ref name="hp10" /> Naik said that the [[evolution as fact and theory|theory]] of [[evidence of common descent|evolution]] is "only a hypothesis, and an unproven conjecture at best".<ref>

Naik argues, "What Darwin said was only a 'theory'. There is no book saying 'the Fact of Evolution' – All the books say ''Theory of Evolution''." He further added, "There is not a single statement in the Qur'an, which Science has proved wrong yet. Hypothesis go against the Qur'an – theories go against the Qur'an. There is not a single scientific fact, which is mentioned in the Holy Qur'an which goes against established science – It may go against theory."<ref name="hp10" />

===Criticism of media===
Naik has called the [[mass media|media]] "the most important tool rather the most dangerous weapon in the world, which converts black into white and a villain into a hero". He suggested that, "We should use the same media to remove the misconceptions, misquotations, misinterpretations, and misrepresentations about Islam."<ref name="Khaleej"/> He claimed, [[western power]]s and [[western media|media]] play a double-standard strategy, who describe Muslims as [[extremist]]s and [[fundamentalist]]s to defame Islam.<ref name="Khaleej"/><ref name="Gambia3"/> He said, "The maximum damage done to the image of Islam today is by the international media which is bombarding misconceptions about it day and night using an array of strategies. International media, be it print, audio, video, or online, use a number of strategies to malign Islam by first picking up the black sheep of the Muslim community, and portraying them as though they are exemplary Muslims." Naik also claimed the "third and fourth" strategy by international media is "to pick a word from [[Quran]] or [[sunnah]] and mistranslate it" and "to malign Islam by saying something that does not belong to it".<ref name="Khaleej"/>

Naik also said, "If a Muslim woman wears [[hijab]] or veil it is labeled as women subjugation, but if a [[nun]] does to the same it turns into a sign of respect and modesty. A 50-year-old Muslim marrying a 16-year-old girl (willingly) is a headline, but a 50-year-old non-Muslim raping a six-year-old girl appears as brief news or filler. They say Islam does not give [[Women's rights|rights to women]], and is an illogical [[religion]]. They portray Islam as the problem of humanity though it is the solution to all man's problems. The same applies to the misinterpreted words 'fundamentalist' and 'extremist' which are basically western words.<ref name="Gambia3"/> A true Muslim must be an extremist in the correct direction, by being extremely kind, loving, tolerant, honest and just. While [[Indian people|Indians]] were [[Indian independence movement|fighting for their freedom]], the [[British government]] was labelling them as terrorists; same activity, same people, but two different labels. The same happened with Muslims who are labelled as terrorists in media, so we should look into backgrounds and reasons for an activity before labelling people." <ref name="Khaleej"/>

He criticizes the portrayal of Muslims in films saying, "Hundreds of movies were made in [[Hollywood]] to malign the image of Islam that a non-Muslim gets scared when he heard a Muslim saying '[[Allah Akbar]]', thinking that he is going to kill him. If anyone really wants to know how good Islam is, he or she has to study its authentic sources; the glorious [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] rather than looking to its followers ([[Muslim]]s) as is the case with a motorist whose reckless driving should be blamed for an accident rather than the latest [[Mercedes (marque)|Mercedes car]] he was driving. The best exemplary Muslim is the last and final messenger prophet [[Muhammad]], peace be upon him." He also criticized media for "pick(ing) up Muslims who criticised Islam like [[Salman Rushdie]], and giv(ing) them awards", saying, "If a Muslim does something great, they may give him credit but ignore his religion or change his Muslim name like the Aristotle of the East, [[Avicenna]], whose real name was "Ali Ibn Sina"."<ref name="Khaleej"/>

=== Gender and sexuality ===

====Women's rights====
Naik states that it is permissible to [[Islam and domestic violence|beat one's wife]] "gently". He argues that "as far as the family is concerned, a man is the leader. So, he has the right", but he should beat his wife "lightly".<ref name="hp10" />

====Homosexuality====
Naik referred to the [[LGBT]] community as "patients suffering from sinful [[Mental disorder|mental problems]]" and said that "It's because they watch [[pornographic movies]]. The TV channels are to be blamed".<ref name="hp10" /> "According to ''[[Hadith of the Quran and Sunnah|Quran and Sunnah]]''",<ref name="indiatoday">

==== Masturbation ====
Based on the reasoning of [[Ibn Hazm]] and [[Ibn Abbas]], as well as his own arguments addressing the literary interpretation of relevant Qur'anic passages and the hadith, Naik concludes that masturbation is [[makruh]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Naik|first=Zakir|date=2020-11-23|title=Masturbation is not Haraam or Sinful but Makrooh and Discouraged in Islam — Dr Zakir Naik|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDFxGu47Zu0|website=[[Youtube]]}}</ref>

=== Other religions ===

====Apostasy====
Naik believes that Muslims who [[apostasy in Islam|convert from Islam]] should not necessarily receive death sentences, but that under Islamic law those who leave Islam<ref name="hp10" /> and then "propagate the non-Islamic faith and speak against Islam" should be put to death.<ref name="apostat4">

====Propagation of other faiths in Islamic states====
While he appreciates that people of other religions allow Muslims to freely propagate Islam in their country, Naik preaches that the dissemination of other religions within an Islamic state must be forbidden because he believes that other faiths are incorrect, so their propagation is as wrong as it would be for an arithmetic teacher to teach that 2+2=3 or 6 instead of 2+2=4.<ref name="hp10" />

Likewise, Naik argues, "regarding building of churches or temples, how can we (Muslims) allow this when their religion is wrong and when their worshiping is wrong?"<ref>

Naik criticises the activities of [[Christian mission]]aries in the [[Muslim world]] saying, "the missionaries write verses of the bible in Arabic calligraphy, such as 'God is love' to catch fish with the Muslims. We in Peace TV, for example, do not use such deceit."<ref name="Khaleej"/>

===Jihad===
In a lecture given in [[University of the Gambia]],<ref name="Gambia2"/><ref name="Gambia4"/><ref name="Gambia3"/> Zakir strongly condemned the atrocities around the world in the name of [[Jihad]], where innocent people lost their lives, saying "Jihad is misunderstood by both Muslims and non-Muslims, Jihad means to strive and struggle to make society better, the best form of Jihad is to strive and struggle against non-Muslims, using the teachings of the Quran; the Prophet Peace Be Upon Him and the Almighty Allah, Islam means peace."<ref name="Gambia3"/> According to Naik, the killing of any innocent person, either Muslim or not is prohibited by Islam, while condemning the [[double-standard]], played by the western powers and media who describes Muslims as extremists and fundamentalists. He said in unequivocal term that, even in Islamic Jihad, there are laid down rules and regulations as when and how to kill a person, which he noted, totally contradicts what is currently happening around the world, by some groups who claim to fight for Jihad.<ref name="Gambia3">

</ref>

In another lecture given in [[Al-Khawaneej]], [[Dubai]], Naik stated that the most mistranslated and misunderstood word about Islam by non-Muslims and even some Muslims is "Jihad", which, he said, has nothing to do with the phrase "[[holy war]]" that is never actually used in the [[Quran]] or [[sunnah]] and was first used by the [[crusades|crusaders]] who killed millions in the name of [[Christianity]]. He added the word "Jihad" actually means to strive or struggle against one's own evil inclinations, to make the society better, in self-defense on a battlefield, and against oppression.<ref name="Khaleej"/>

====11 September attacks and Osama bin Laden====
In a lecture delivered on 31 July 2008 on Peace TV, Naik commented on the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of 11 September]]: "it is a blatant, open secret that this attack on the Twin Towers was done by [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] himself".<ref name="Bush11Sep">

===Terrorism, killings and suicide bombing===
Later in 2010, Naik said that he had been quoted out of context regarding the remarks on terrorism. "As far as terrorist is concerned", he said, "I tell the Muslims that every Muslim should be a terrorist... What is the meaning of the word terrorist? Terrorist by definition means a person who terrorises. So in this context every Muslim should be a terrorist to each and every anti-social element. I'm aware that terrorist is more commonly used for a person who terrorises innocent human beings.

Naik stated that [[Hitler]], "who was not a Muslim, is the biggest terrorist in the world as he incinerated four to six million Jews."<ref name="Khaleej"/>

When asked about his views on killings, Naik said "the [[Quran]] says so – if anyone kills an innocent human being, [[Muslim]] or non-Muslim, it is as though he has killed the whole [[Humanity (virtue)|humanity]], So how can any Muslim kill innocent human beings?"<ref name="Gambia3"/><ref name="ISIS"/> It was only permissible, he said, to kill a person who "has killed someone else ... or created corruption in the land."<ref name="wpzn" /> He also criticized the media for "picking up verses of the Quran or hadiths and quoting them out of context to mislabel Islam as a religion that promotes violence and killing".<ref name="Khaleej"/> He said that "critics of Islam quotes Verse 5/9 which reads: 'Wherever you find a non-Muslim, kill him' out of context to malign Islam though it was an order in a battlefield, and Islam always promotes peace as better option during war."<ref name="Khaleej"/>

In a press conference via [[Skype]], when Naik was asked for his opinion on [[suicide bombings]] he replied affirmatively, saying it was permitted in Islam and said "it is [[haram]] if innocent people are being killed.

=== Allegations of promoting terrorism ===
Several researchers have investigated the link between Naik and terrorism. Author [[Praveen Swami]] considers Naik to be a part of the ideological infrastructure created to feed "Tempered Jihad", which he defines as Jihad calibrated to advance Islamist political objectives.<ref name="ps"/> Swami argued that some of Naik's teachings are similar to those of organizations advocating violence, although Naik himself emphatically rejects terrorism.<ref name="lashkar">

</ref> According to Swami, Naik's IRF has proved to be a "magnet" for figures linked to the [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]], while his message has mesmerised violent Islamists, and his works "help make sense of the motivations of Indian recruits to the ''jihad''".<ref name="ps"/>

In 2008, an Islamic scholar in [[Lucknow]], shahar qazi Mufti Abul Irfan Mian Firangi Mahali, issued a [[fatwa]] against Naik, claiming that he supported [[Osama bin Laden]], and that his teachings were un-Islamic. Naik claims his speeches were being taken out of context.<ref>

In 2007, reports claimed that [[Darul Uloom]] {{which|date=April 2020}} considered him a self-styled preacher unattached to any of the four orthodox Sunni Islamic schools of jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]) and therefore has issued many [[fatwa]]s against Zakir Naik, rejecting him as being amongst the ghair muqallidin (a term used in Islam to describe someone who does not relate with the four [[madhabs]] viz. [[Hanafi]], [[Hanbali]], [[Shafi'i|Sha'afi]] and [[Maliki]]) thereby appealing towards Muslims to avoid listening to his sermons.<ref name=HT3>

=== Hostility towards non-Muslims and other Muslims ===
''[[The Times of India]]'' published a profile of Naik entitled "The controversial preacher" after he was banned from the United Kingdom. According to ''The Times'', "the fact is that barring the band of Muslims whose bruised egos Naik suitably massages through his Islam supremacist talks, most rational Muslims and non-Muslims find his brand of Islam a travesty of the faith". ''The Times'' also claimed that "the Wahabi-[[Salafi movement|Salafist]] brand of Islam, bankrolled by petro-rich Saudi Arabia and propagated by preachers like Naik, does not appreciate the idea of pluralism." The article quotes Muslim scholar [[Wahiduddin Khan]]: "Dawah, which Naik also claims to be engaged in, is to make people aware of the creation plan of God, not to peddle some provocative, dubious ideas as Naik does." He adds: "The wave of Islamophobia in the aftermath of 9/11 and the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan have only added to the Muslims' sense of injury. In such a situation, when a debater like Zakir Naik, in eloquent English, takes on preachers of other faiths and defeats them during debates, the Muslims' chests puff with pride. A community nursing a huge sense of betrayal and injustice naturally lionises anyone who gives it a sense of pride. Never mind if it's false pride."<ref>

In ''[[Firstpost]]'', reporter Sreemoy Talukdar wrote, "The smooth-talking [[televangelism|televangelist]]'s regressive and problematic teachings, thoroughly dissected and discussed threadbare, strike at the pluralist cultural component of our existence and promotes a version of Islam that is dreary and incompatible with the modern world."<ref name="FP">

=== Stance towards homosexuals, apostates and women ===
In ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', [[Sadanand Dhume]] criticised Naik for recommending the death penalty for homosexuals and for apostasy from the faith.<ref name="wsj1">

</ref> He also criticised him for calling for India to be ruled by Shariah law. He added that, according to Naik, Jews "control America" and are the "strongest in enmity to Muslims." He maintained that Naik supports a ban on the construction of non-Muslim places of worship in Muslim lands as well as the Taliban's bombing of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]]. Dhume argues that people reportedly drawn to Naik's message include Najibullah Zazi, the Afghan-American arrested for planning suicide attacks on the New York subway; Rahil Sheikh, accused of involvement in [[2006 Mumbai train bombings|a series of train bombings in Mumbai in 2006]]; and [[Kafeel Ahmed]], the Bangalore man fatally injured in a [[2007 Glasgow International Airport attack|failed suicide attack on Glasgow airport in 2007]]. He also stated that "unless Indians find the ability to criticise such a radical Islamic preacher as robustly as they would a Hindu equivalent, the ideal of Indian secularism would remain deeply flawed."<ref name="wsj1"/>

Bangladeshi author [[Taslima Nasreen]] described Naik as "dangerous" because he "promotes 7th century Quranic texts on [[Sexual slavery in Islam|sex slaves]], [[polygamy]] and [[Islam and domestic violence|wife beating]] in 21st century". She said in a series of tweets that, "I listened to Zakir Naik's speeches. He cites Quranic texts and tries to justify. He's dangerous because it's dangerous to spread 7th century texts in the 21st century".<ref name="Nasreen">

=== 2019 Malaysian Chinese and Hindus controversy ===
During a lecture Zakir Naik held on 8 August 2019 in [[Kota Bharu]], [[Kelantan|Kelantan state]], Malaysia, he said that [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese people living in Malaysia]] are "old guests" who should return to China, suggesting they needed to be forcibly deported out of the country. In the same lecture, he also claimed that [[Hinduism in Malaysia|Hindus living in Malaysia]] had "100 times more rights" than the [[Islam in India|Muslim minority in India]], and were more loyal to Indian PM [[Narendra Modi]] than to Malaysian PM [[Mahathir Mohamad]]. These comments sparked outrage across Malaysian society, being criticised as inciting racial and religious hatred and disrupting the peace and harmony between communities. By 15 August, four government ministers called for revocation of Zakir Naik's permanent residency and for him to be extradited to India.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/outrage-malaysia-zakir-naik-suggests-chinese-expulsion-190814230715236.html |title=Outrage in Malaysia as Zakir Naik suggests Chinese expulsion |author=Amy Chew |work=Aljazeera |date=15 August 2019 |accessdate=19 August 2019 }}</ref> Citizens lodged a total of 115 police complaints against Naik.<ref name="Soo Wern Jun"/>

On 16 August, Naik was questioned for about seven hours by the [[Royal Malaysia Police]] at Bukit Aman in Kuala Lumpur about his controversial statements, while PM Mahathir said that "If he is found to be doing detrimental things to the country, it will be necessary for us to take away his permanent resident status. And that case, of course, we may need to take action to prevent him from making such provocative speeches, which attempt to pit the different races against each other," adding that a public apology by Naik may not be "enough to assuage the anger of many people".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/08/16/zakir039s-pr-status-to-be-decided-after-police-probe-says-dr-m |title=Zakir's PR status to be decided after police probe, says Dr M |author=Mazwin Nik Anis |work=The Star |date=16 August 2019 |accessdate=19 August 2019 }}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Sarawak]], the largest state of Malaysia, banned Zakir Naik from entering the state on 15 August,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/08/15/sarawak-bans-zakir-naik-from-entering-the-state |title=Sarawak bans Zakir Naik from entering the state |author=Andy Chua |work=The Star |date=15 August 2019 |accessdate=19 August 2019 }}</ref> while the state of [[Perlis]] barred him henceforth from speaking at public events on 16 August,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/islamic-preacher-zakir-naik-perlis-police-ban-11815304 |title=Controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik barred from speaking in Perlis by Malaysian police |work=Channel News Asia |date=16 August 2019 |accessdate=19 August 2019 }}</ref> followed by the state of [[Kedah]] on 17 August; Naik was scheduled to speak in both states.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/08/18/kedah-is-second-state-to-ban-zakir-naik-from-speaking-publicly |title=Kedah is second state to ban Zakir Naik from speaking publicly |author=Arnold Loh |work=The Star |publisher=17 August 2019 |accessdate=19 August 2019 }}</ref> By 20 August, [[Sabah]], [[Malacca]], [[Penang]] and [[Selangor]] had joined the other three states in prohibiting Naik from speaking in public, thus barring him in 7 out of 13 Malaysian states. After another 10 hour-round of police hearings on 19 August, ''[[Free Malaysia Today]]'' reported that on 20 August the police had imposed a nationwide speaking ban on Zakir Naik,<ref name="FMT20Aug">{{Cite news |url=https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/08/20/naik-effectively-banned-from-speaking-nationwide/ |title=Naik effectively banned from speaking nationwide |work=[[Free Malaysia Today]] |date=20 August 2019 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> which the police confirmed to the ''[[Malay Mail]]''.<ref name="Malaysiaban" />

By 19 August, Zakir Naik had had his lawyers file legal complaints against five Malaysian politicians for 'defamation', claiming that they had taken his statements out of context and thus unduly damaged his reputation.<ref name="Soo Wern Jun">{{Cite news |url=https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/08/19/dr-zakir-naik-serves-four-more-with-notices-of-demand/1782100 |title=Dr Zakir Naik serves four more with legal notices of demand |author=Soo Wern Jun |work=Malay Mail |date=19 August 2019 |accessdate=19 August 2019 }}</ref> The next day he maintained that his statements had been taken out of context, but expressed 'heartfelt apologies for this misunderstanding', as it 'was never my intention to upset any individual or community.'<ref name="FMT20Aug"/> The Indian PM Modi had criticized Naik's comments during a dialogue with Mahathir at the [[Eastern Economic Forum]] in September.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-did-not-ask-for-zakir-naiks-extradition-claims-malaysian-pm-2102176 |title=PM Modi Did Not Ask For Zakir Naik's Extradition, Claims Malaysian PM |author=Soo Wern Jun |work=NDTV }}</ref>

In 13 May 2020, Modi government sent formal request to [[Malaysia]] for Zakir Naik's extradition.<ref>{{cite news |title=India sends formal request to Malaysia for Zakir Naik extradition - Times of India |url=https://m.timesofindia.com/india/india-sends-formal-request-to-malaysia-for-zakir-naik-extradition/amp_articleshow/75739442.cms |accessdate=31 May 2020 |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=14 May 2020 |language=en}}</ref>
