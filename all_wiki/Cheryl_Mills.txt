==White House counsel==
After serving as Deputy General Counsel of the Clinton/Gore Transition Planning Foundation after Clinton's 1992 election, she served as Associate Counsel to the President in the White House<ref name="nyu-bio"/> from 1993 on.<ref name="sff">{{cite web|url=http://www.seeforever.org/SF/board.html |title=See Forever Board of Directors |publisher=[[See Forever Foundation]] |accessdate=2008-01-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402233524/http://www.seeforever.org/SF/board.html |archivedate=2008-04-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Until the impeachment, she was little known to the public,<ref name="wapo">{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/defense.htm | title=Defense Who's Who | work=The Washington Post | date=January 19, 1999 | accessdate=2008-01-01}}</ref> although she did rise to public attention when a burglar reportedly broke into her car and stole documents relating to the handling of the late [[Vincent Foster]]'s papers related to the [[Whitewater controversy]], as well as the 1993 federal raid on the [[Branch Davidian]] compound in [[Waco]].<ref>https://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-15/news/mn-24214_1_white-house</ref>

During the impeachment trial, the [[BBC]] reported that she was "widely regarded as the shining star of the defense team, and gave an effective presentation on President Clinton's behalf on the second day of defense arguments."<ref name="bbc"/> Other media outlets also viewed her work quite favorably.<ref name="mrc">{{cite news | url=http://www.mediaresearch.org/realitycheck/1999/fax19990128.asp | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021125153412/http://www.mediaresearch.org/realitycheck/1999/fax19990128.asp | url-status=dead | archive-date=2002-11-25 | title=Cheryl Mills: Liar, Obstructor...Heroine? | author=Tim Graham | publisher=[[Media Research Center]] | date=1999-01-28 | accessdate=2008-01-01 }}</ref> Her presentation to the Senate focused on refuting the obstruction of justice charge and the House Managers' claim that failure to convict the President would damage the rule of law.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/clinton_under_fire/profiles/259798.stm | title=President Clinton's best defence | publisher=BBC News | date=1999-02-10 | accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref>  Her summation became known for its endorsement of Clinton's record with respect towards women and minorities;<ref name="nyt080999"/> she said, "I stand here before you today because President Bill Clinton believed I could stand here for him ...

After Clinton was acquitted, Mills was offered the [[White House Counsel]] position when [[Charles Ruff]] stepped down, but she declined.<ref name="nyt080999">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/09/us/chief-lawyer-for-white-house-heads-back-to-private-practice.html | title= Chief Lawyer for White House Heads Back to Private Practice | author=Katherine Q.

==Post-White House career==
After leaving the Clinton administration, Mills took a break from the practice of law. From 1999 to 2001, she served as Senior Vice President for Corporate Policy and Public Programming at [[Oxygen Media]].<ref name="nyu-bio"/>

By 2002, she was working for [[New York University]] (NYU).<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/01/nyregion/bulletin-board-cabinet-s-new-look-at-nyu.html | title=Cabinet's New Look at N.Y.U. | author=Karen W.

Helderman - [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/while-at-state-clinton-chief-of-staff-held-job-negotiating-with-abu-dhabi/2015/10/12/e847b3be-6863-11e5-8325-a42b5a459b1e_story.html "While at State, Clinton chief of staff held job negotiating with Abu Dhabi"], ''Washington Post'', October 12, 2015. Retrieved 2015-10-13</ref> She worked for no pay in those first months at the State Department, and was officially designated as a "temporary expert-consultant", which allowed her to continue receiving outside income while serving as Clinton's Chief of Staff. On her financial disclosure forms, she reported $198,000 in income from NYU in 2009, during the period her university work overlapped with her time at the State Department, and that she collected an additional $330,000 in vacation and severance payments when she left the university’s payroll in May 2009.<ref name=WP1012/> Additionally, Mills remained on the [[Clinton Foundation]]’s unpaid board for a short time after joining the State Department. Another Clinton aide, [[Huma Abedin]], spent her final six months employed as Clinton’s deputy chief of staff in 2012, while also simultaneously employed by the Clinton Foundation.<ref name=WP1012/> As has Abedin's, Mills’ employment arrangement has raised questions regarding potential conflicts of interest, in Mills' case about how one of the State Department’s top employees set boundaries between her public role and a private job that involved work on a project funded by a foreign government.<ref name=WP1012/> Under Federal ethics laws, employees are prohibited from participating in matters that would have any direct and predictable effect on themselves or an outside employer. Mills told the ''Washington Post'' that she did not “recall any issues” at the State Department that would have required her recusing herself, and said she would have consulted with the ethics office if such an issue had come up. [[Nick Merrill]], a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, declined to comment.<ref name=WP1012/>

==Department of State==
Mills served as the Counselor and Chief of Staff to Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] beginning in January 2009.<ref name="Gucci and Elle Honor Women in Washington Power List">{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/eye/parties/gucci-and-elle-honor-women-in-washington-power-list-7617841?src=nl/wkEye/20140328 | title=Gucci and Elle Honor Women in Washington Power List | publisher=WWD | date=26 March 2014 | accessdate=28 March 2014 | author=Watters, Susan}}</ref> In her capacity as Counselor, she was a principal officer who served the Secretary as a special adviser on major foreign policy challenges.<ref name="state-bio"/>  As Chief of Staff, Mills managed the Department's staff, providing support to the Secretary in administering operations of the Department. Several months after her appointment, former White House Press Secretary [[Joe Lockhart]] noted in an interview: “I think Secretary Clinton wants to know you’re a team player, but she wants to hear it straight and she gets exactly that from Cheryl.”<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0409/21584.html| title=Gatekeeper: Cheryl Mills | author=Amie Parnes | publisher=[[Politico]] | date=2009-04-24 | accessdate=2011-06-17}}</ref>

In summer 2016, CNN reported on another ethical question pertaining to Mills' relationship with the [[Clinton Foundation]] during her tenure at the State Department: In 2012 Mills had traveled to New York City in order to assist the foundation by conducting interviews in a high-level candidate search.<ref name="CNN-Griffin">Griffin, Drew, and David Fitzpatrick (August&nbsp;11, 2016).

===Attorney-client privilege===

On June 18, 2018 U.S. Senators posed questions regarding Miss Mills and her colleague [[Heather Samuelson]] within the unprecedented relationships between her government duties and her private practice in light of possible scenario of obstruction of justice to [[Michael E.

It is one of the reasons why this program is such an important one."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.wbur.org/npr/137135049/clintons-africa-tour-underscores-the-power-of-women| title= Clinton's Africa Tour Underscores The Power Of Women | author=Weekend Edition | publisher=[[NPR]] | date=2011-06-12 | accessdate=2011-06-17}}</ref>
