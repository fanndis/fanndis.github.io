"'''New Romantics'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] for the deluxe edition of her fifth studio album, ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014). It was written by Swift and its producers, [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]]. The song's title is a reference to the [[New Romantic|cultural movement]] of the 1970s and 1980s, of which the [[new wave music|new wave]] musical styles influenced the song's [[synth-pop]] production. The lyrics find Swift reigniting her hopes and energy after having endured emotional hardships. "New Romantics" was released as a [[promotional single]] through [[Big Machine Records]] on March 3, 2015, and was released to US radio stations by [[Republic Records]] in partnership with Big Machine as ''1989''{{'s}} seventh and final single on February 23, 2016. The song's music video, a compilation of footage from [[the 1989 World Tour]], was released in April 2016.

The single peaked at number 46 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and entered the top 40 on record charts in Australia, Belgian [[Flanders]], Lebanon, and Scotland. It received [[Music recording certification|gold certifications]] in Australia and the US. Various critics lamented that the song did not make the cut of ''1989''{{'s}} standard edition; they hailed the song's energetic and lively atmosphere, ranking "New Romantics" among Swift's best songs of her career. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 2019 included the track on their list of the 100 best songs of the 2010s decade. Some others were not as impressed, deeming the song forgettable.

==Production==
Inspired by 1980s [[synth-pop]], singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] moved away for the [[country music|country]]-styled music of her previous releases to employ a straightforward [[pop music|pop]] production for her fifth studio album, ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-reveals-five-things-to-expect-on-1989-65750/ |title=Taylor Swift Reveals Five Things to Expect on '1989'| first=Josh|last=Eells| work=[[Rolling Stone]]| date=September 16, 2014| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116173655/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-reveals-five-things-to-expect-on-1989-65750/ | archivedate=November 16, 2018| accessdate=November 16, 2018}}</ref> To this end, she cut ties with former longtime producers in favor of prominent mainstream pop producers, including Swedish hitmakers [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]]; Swift also recruited Martin as co-[[executive producer]].{{sfn|McNutt|2020|p=78}} Martin and Shellback produced seven out of 13 tracks on the album's standard edition,{{sfn|McNutt|2020|p=78}} and two out of three bonus tracks on the deluxe edition, including "New Romantics".<ref name="notes"/> Swift and the two producers also served as songwriters.<ref name="notes"/> The track was recorded by Michael Ilbert at [[MXM Studios]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, and Sam Holland at [[Conway Recording Studios]] in Los Angeles.<ref name="notes"/> It was [[audio mastering|mastered]] by [[Tom Coyne (music engineer)|Tom Coyne]] at Sterling Sound studio in New York City.<ref name="notes"/>

The lyrics are about Swift reigniting her hopes and energy after the heartbreak she had endured. In the views of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' reviewer Vrinda Jagota, "New Romantics" is where Swift brushes off the pain "into a night of uninhibited [[hedonism]]", representing her departure from "slow-burning heartache" on her previous songs towards a more positive, laid-back attitude.<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-1989/|title=Taylor Swift: 1989|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|first=Vrinda|last=Jagota|date=August 19, 2019|accessdate=September 20, 2019}}</ref> The lyrics "Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly / We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet" find Swift celebrating the joys of youth, a theme that Emily Yahr from ''[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]'' compared to Swift's previous single "[[22 (Taylor Swift song)|22]]" (2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/music/98540124/taylor-swift-if-you-think-she-only-sings-about-her-exes-youre-wrong|title=Taylor Swift: If you think she only sings about her exes, you're wrong|first=Emily|last=Yahr|work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|date=November 6, 2017|accessdate=August 26, 2020}}</ref> ''Slate'' critic [[Carl Wilson (writer)|Carl Wilson]] described the song as ''1989''{{'s}} representation of Swift's new attitude towards romance.

Upon the release of ''1989'', Corey Baesley from ''PopMatters'' deemed "New Romantics" and the other two deluxe edition bonus tracks more "compositionally daring" than the standard edition.
