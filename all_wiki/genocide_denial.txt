'''Genocide denial''' is the attempt to deny or minimize the scale and severity of an incidence of [[genocide]]. Denial is an integral part of genocide<ref name="jgr"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Huttenbach |first1=Henry R. |title=Studies in Comparative Genocide |date=1999 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |isbn=978-1-349-27348-5 |pages=216–229 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-27348-5_12 |language=en |chapter=The Psychology and Politics of Genocide Denial: a Comparison of Four Case Studies}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Herf |first=Jeffrey |author-link1=Jeffrey Herf|title-link=The Jewish Enemy |title=The Jewish Enemy: Nazi Propaganda during the World War II and the Holocaust |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-674038-59-2|p=127 }}</ref> and includes secret planning of genocide, propaganda while the genocide is ongoing,<ref name="jgr"/> and [[destruction of evidence]] of mass killings.

The distinction between respectable academic historians and those of illegitimate [[historical negationists]], including genocide deniers, rests on the techniques used to write such histories. Illegitimate revisionists rewrite history to support an agenda, often political, using falsification and [[fallacy|rhetorical fallacies]] to obtain their results.
==Analysis==
According to [[Taner Akçam]], "the practice of “denialism” in regard to mass atrocities is usually thought of as a simple denial of the facts, but this is not true. Rather, it is in that nebulous territory between facts and truth where such denialism germinates."<ref name="Killing Orders">{{cite book |last1=Akçam |first1=Taner|author-link=Taner Akçam|title-link=Killing Orders |title=Killing Orders: Talat Pasha’s Telegrams and the Armenian Genocide |date=2018 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-69787-1 |pages=1–2 |language=en}}</ref>

The [[European Commission]] proposed a European Union–wide anti-racism law in 2001, which included an offense of genocide denial, but European Union states failed to agree on the balance between prohibiting racism and freedom of expression. After six years of wrangling a watered down compromise was reached in 2007 giving states freedom to implement the legislation as they saw fit.<ref name=EthanMcNern>Ethan McNern.

== Effects ==
{{tone|date=February 2020}}
Genocide denial has an immense impact on both victim and perpetrator groups. The denial not only affects the relations and the possible reconciliation between victim and perpetrator, but it also affects the identity of the respective group, impacting at large the society they live in. While confrontation of the committed atrocities can be a tough process in which the victim feels humiliated anew by reliving the past,<ref name="Margalit">{{cite book | last= Margalit | first= Avishai | title= The Ethics of Memory | url=https://archive.org/details/ethicsofmemory00avis | url-access= registration | year=2002|publisher= Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-00941-X}}{{rp|61–64}}</ref> it still has a benign therapeutic effect, helping the society to come to the terms with the past.<ref name="Amstutz">{{cite book | last= Amstutz | first=Mark R. | title= The Healing of Nations: The Promise and Limits of Political Forgiveness | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gTFnh2GuD8EC | year=2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |isbn=0-7425-3580-0}}{{rp|24}}</ref> From a therapeutic point of view, letting the victim confront the past atrocity and its related painful memories is one way to reach a closure and to understand that the harm has occurred in the past.<ref name="Colvin">{{cite book | last= Colvin | first= Christopher J. | chapter= The Healing of Nations: The Promise and Limits of Political Forgiveness | editor-first1= Katherine | editor-last1=Hodgkin | editor-first2= Susannah | editor-last2= Radstone | title = Contested pasts: The politics of memory | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0VkXJT_zXoC | year=2003 | publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-28647-6}}{{rp|156}}</ref> By acknowledging the past errors, the relating memories are co-processed, "sometimes resulting in the narrator feeling a little better and the listener a little worse."<ref name="Adler">{{cite book | editor-last1=Adler | editor-first1=Nanci | editor-last2= Leydesdorff | editor-first2=Selma | editor-last3= Chamberlain | editor-first3=Mary | editor-last4= Neyzi | editor-first4=Leyla | title= Memories of Mass Repression: Narrating Life Stories in the Aftermath of Atrocity | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hTYrDwAAQBAJ | year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-4128-0853-8}}{{rp|xii}}</ref> This also helps the memories to enter the shared narrative of the society, thereby becoming a common ground on which the society can build its future on.<ref name="Avedian2018">{{cite book | last=Avedian | first=Vahagn | title=Knowledge and Acknowledgement in the Politics of Memory of the Armenian Genocide | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tv7iuQEACAAJ | year=2018 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-1-13-831885-4}}{{rp|45}}</ref> Denying recognition will have a negative effect, further victimizing the victim which will feel not only wronged by the perpetrator but also by being denied recognition of the occurred wrongdoing. This implies that the denial also has a pivotal role in shaping the norms of a society since the omission of any committed errors, and thereby the lack of condemnation and punishment of the committed wrongs, risks normalizing similar actions, rising the society's tolerance for future occurrences of similar errors.<ref name="Avedian2018" />{{rp|110}} Scholars exemplify the latter aspect in the case of Republic of Turkey and how the Turkish state's [[Armenian Genocide denial]] has had far-reaching effects on the Turkish society throughout its history in regard to both ethnic minorities, especially the Kurds, but political opposition in general.<ref name="Avedian2018" />{{rp|48}} The denial also affects the self-image of the perpetrator by omitting the "righteous" individuals among its own ranks. This lack of differentiation between "we" (the righteous") and "them" (the wrongful "other") could result in a rather homogeneous perception of the nation in question, thus making the victim (but also third parties) to project the perpetrating role onto the entire society/nation, aggravating the prospects of future reconciliation.<ref name="Avedian2018" />{{rp|24}}

Bhargava notes that "[m]ost calls to forget disguise the attempt to prevent victims from publicly remembering in the fear that 'there is a dragon living on the patio and we better not provoke it.'"<ref name="Bhargava">{{cite book | last= Bhargava | first= Rajeev | chapter= Restoring Decency to Barbaric Societies | editor-first1= Robert I. | editor-last1= Rotberg | editor-first2= Dennis F. | editor-last2= Thompson| title = Truth v.

The fear of physical suffering in the future feeds on the remembrance of past acts of repression. Such thinking encourages passivity and obedience in victims, and this in turn serves the interest of the powerful. But such remembrance can cut both ways. If memory of suffering is kept alive, reprisal may occur at future, inopportune moments."<ref name="Bhargava" />{{rp|52}} In the Armenian case, one could point to the committed terrorist acts during 1970s and 1980s (e.g. [[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia|ASALA]] and [[Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide|JCAG]] as a direct result of the Turkish state denial of the genocide).<ref name="Avedian2018" />{{rp|110}}

However, political contingencies could in certain cases necessitate some degree of denial (or at least holding back the entire truth) in order to promote a recovery and re-building a society. This approach is especially conspicuous in post-conflict societies where the prevailing power constellation might require a political trade-off in regard to past committed wrongs. This aspect was true in post-Apartheid South Africa where the perpetrating group was still in possession of power (judicial, police, army), risking political instability if they were put on trial and risked punishment.<ref name="Gutman">{{cite book | last1= Gutman| first1= Amy | last2 = Thompson | first2 = Dennis F. | chapter= The Moral Foundations of Truth Commissions | editor-first1= Robert I. | editor-last1= Rotberg | editor-first2= Dennis F. | editor-last2= Thompson| title = Truth v.

However, the society at large and the victims in particular will perceive this kind of tradeoffs as "morally suspect,"<ref name="Rotberg">{{cite book | last1= Rotberg| first1= Robert I. |  chapter= Truth Commissions and the Provision of Truth, Justice, and Reconciliations | editor-first1= Robert I. | editor-last1= Rotberg | editor-first2= Dennis F. | editor-last2= Thompson| title = Truth v.

Thus, a common refrain in regard to the Final Report (1998) by South Africa's [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] was "We've heard the truth. There is even talk about reconciliation. But where's the justice?"<ref name="Bevernage">{{cite book | last= Bevernage | first=Berber | title= History, Memory, and State-Sponsored Violence: Time and Justice | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6TJnja5XToC | year=2012 | publisher=Routledge |isbn= 978-0-415-88340-5}}{{rp|47–48}}</ref>

The denial has thereby a direct negative impact on the development of a society, often by undermining its laws and the issue of justice, but also the level of democracy itself.<ref name="Avedian2018" />{{rp|33–38}} If democracy is meant to be built on the rule of law and justice, upheld and safeguarded by state institutions, then surely the omission of legal consequences and justice would potentially undermine the democracy.<ref name="Jelin">{{cite book | last1= Jelin| first1= Elizabeth| last2 = Kaufman| first2 = Susana G. | chapter= Layers of Memories: Twenty Years After in Argentina | editor-first1= David E. | editor-last1= Lorey | editor-first2= William H. | editor-last2= Beezley | title = Genocide, Collective Violence, and Popular Memory: The Politics of Remembrance in the Twentieth Century | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MKPBEx5DbiMC | year=2000|publisher= SR Books |isbn=0-8420-2982-6}}{{rp|36}}</ref> What is more dangerous from a historical point of view is that such a default would imply the subsequent loss of the meaning of these events to future generations, a loss which is resembled to "losing a moral compass."<ref name="DeBrito">{{cite book | last1= De Brito | first1= Alexandra Barahona | last2 = Enriquez | first2 = Carmen Gonzalez |last3 = Aguilar| first3 = Paloma | chapter= Introduction | editor-last1= De Brito | editor-first1= Alexandra Barahona | editor-last2 = Enriquez | editor-first2 = Carmen Gonzalez | editor-last3 = Aguilar| editor-first3 = Paloma | title = Genocide, Collective Violence, and Popular Memory: The Politics of Remembrance in the Twentieth Century | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BByTH0r588C | year=2001 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-924090-6}}{{rp|25}}</ref> The society becomes susceptible to similar wrongdoings in the absence of proper handling of preceding occasions.<ref name="Adler2">{{cite book | last1= Adler | first1= Nanci | chapter= Conclusion | editor-last1= De Brito | editor-first1= Alexandra Barahona | editor-last2 = Enriquez | editor-first2 = Carmen Gonzalez | editor-last3 = Aguilar| editor-first3 = Paloma | title = Genocide, Collective Violence, and Popular Memory: The Politics of Remembrance in the Twentieth Century | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BByTH0r588C | year=2001 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-924090-6}}{{rp|311}}</ref> Nonetheless, denial, especially immediately after the committed wrongdoings, is rather the rule than the exception and naturally almost exclusively done by the perpetrator in order to escape responsibility. In some cases, e.g. the [[Armenian Genocide]], this denial is done explicitly, while in some other cases, e.g. in the case of the "[[Comfort women]]" and the role of the Japanese State, the denial is more implicit. The latter was evident in how an overwhelmingly majority of the surviving victims refused to accept a monetary compensation since the Japanese government still refused to admit its own responsibility (the monetary compensation was paid through a private fund rather than by the state, a decision perceived by the victims about state's refusal to assume any direct responsibility).<ref name="Minow">{{cite book | last=Mionw | first=Martha | title= Between Vengeance and Forgiveness: Facing History After Genocide and Mass Violence | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MRQCwAAQBAJ | year=1998 | publisher= Beacon Press, cop. |isbn= 0-8070-4506-3 }}{{rp|105}}</ref>
