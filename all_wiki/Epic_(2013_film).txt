The film features the voices of [[Colin Farrell]], [[Josh Hutcherson]], [[Amanda Seyfried]], [[Christoph Waltz]], [[Aziz Ansari]], [[Chris O'Dowd]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], [[Jason Sudeikis]], [[Steven Tyler]], and [[Beyoncé|Beyoncé Knowles]].

''Epic'' was released on May 24, 2013, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It received generally mixed reviews from critics and grossed $268 million against its $93 million budget.

==Plot==
Seventeen-year-old Mary Katherine, or M.K., moves in with her eccentric [[scientist]] father Professor Bomba, who has been searching for tiny humanoid soldiers called Leafmen. They protect the forest that Bomba lives near from wicked creatures called Boggans and their malevolent leader Mandrake. An independent young soldier named Nod decides to quit, much to the ire of the no-nonsense Leafmen leader Ronin.

The fairy queen of the forest, Queen Tara, must choose an heir to her throne and goes out to a field of leaf pods on board her flying barge and escorted by the Royal guards, arriving at the field guarded by a laid-back [[slug]] named Mub and a wannabe Leafman [[snail]] named Grub. Immediately after she chooses a pod, the Boggans attack. Tara flees the area with the pod, and though flying Leafmen bodyguards do their best to protect her, they are soon overwhelmed by the sheer number of Boggans. Unable to reach the barge and the safety of the Guards, while being chased, Ronin arrives for her and the pair fly off on his [[hummingbird]] mount. They are then attacked by Mandrake and his son Dagda. Dagda is killed by Ronin, but the former shoots Tara beforehand.

Meanwhile, M.K. decides to leave after having an argument with Bomba about his research. Before she can leave, Bomba's dog Ozzy runs into the woods. While looking for Ozzy, M.K. sees Tara falling. Dying, Tara gives her the pod and uses her magic to shrink her. She tells M.K. to take the pod to Nim Galuu, a [[glowworm]] wizard, before she dies, and M.K. joins Ronin and the Leafmen, along with Mub and Grub. Ronin discovers that Nod has entered a race against other creatures and bugs on [[bird]]s. Nod goes back on a deal with a short-tempered [[American toad|toad]] [[gangster]] named Bufo to [[Match fixing|throw the race]]. Before Bufo and his two henchmen can feed Nod to a snake, Ronin intervenes and orders them to leave. A reluctant Nod joins him, M.K., Mub, and Grub after hearing about Queen Tara's death, which Bufo overhears.

Ronin, Nod, M.K., Mub, and Grub eventually track down Nim Galuu. He then leads them down to the scroll library, where M.K. discovers Tara's brief message before shrinking her, and a message that will get her back to normal size. When Ronin leaves, Nod takes M.K. on a [[deer]] ride and they begin to fall in love. Meanwhile, Mandrake has had the Boggans bring Bufo to him, finding out the location of the pod. Mandrake goes to Nim Galuu's place to steal the pod, which, if it blooms in darkness, will help Mandrake destroy the forest. He takes the pod and kidnaps Mub and Grub. Ronin scolds Nod for not being there to protect the pod. To get into Boggan territory undiscovered, M.K., Nod, and Ronin set out to Bomba's house to get some disguises, where M.K. learns that the Leafmen have deliberately been leading Bomba off their trail. Bomba sees that he has visitors and captures M.K., fainting when he sees her. M.K. marks the location of Moonhaven on a map Bomba has made of the forest before rejoining Nod and Ronin.

When they reach the Boggan land Ronin distracts the Boggans while M.K. and Nod rescue Mub, Grub, and the pod. Mandrake discovers them and orders the Boggans to stop them. M.K., Nod, Mub, and Grub escape alive, but Ronin sacrifices himself to ensure their escape. Before the [[full moon]] can sprout the pod at Moonhaven, Mandrake's [[bat]]s block the light, causing the pod to begin sprouting in darkness. The Leafmen set out to fight the Boggans; M.K. tries to get help from her father by visiting his various cameras he had set in the forest. However, upon regaining consciousness, Bomba believes that he didn't really see M.K. and that he has been insane all these years, and shuts down all his cameras. He changes his mind when he sees the red push-pin that M.K. had put on his map.

Bomba is overjoyed to see that he has been right and he follows M.K. to Moonhaven. M.K. uses Bomba's [[iPod]] to make bat sounds, luring Mandrake's bats away. Meanwhile, Mub and Nim Galuu try to stop Mandrake from reaching the pod, but are unsuccessful. Just then, Ronin appears, bearing scars and bruises from the Boggans. Mandrake manages to outdo him, but is defended by Nod, who finally realizes the importance of teamwork. Before Mandrake can obtain his victory, the pod blooms in moonlight, defeating the Boggans, and sealing Mandrake into the burl of a nearby tree.

The chosen heir is the flower child who helped save Tara earlier in the film. Grub becomes a Leafman, Nod and Ronin reconcile, and Nod and M.K. kiss before M.K. is returned to her original size.

After reuniting with Bomba and becoming his assistant, the human family still keeps regular contact with their small friends as they continue the research of their world.

==Production==
In 2006, it was reported that Chris Wedge would be directing an animated feature film based on [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]]'s book, ''The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs'' for Fox Animation. Joyce, who had already collaborated with Wedge as a designer and producer on the 2005 film ''[[Robots (2005 film)|Robots]]'', was set to produce the film.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ball |first=Ryan |title=Fox Falls for Joyce's Leaf Men |url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/fox-falls-for-joyces-leaf-men |accessdate=June 4, 2012 |newspaper=Animation Magazine |date=August 23, 2006}}</ref> At one point, Wedge got permission to find a new home for the film and turned to [[Pixar]], led by [[John Lasseter]], a close friend that Wedge knew from working on ''[[Tron]]''. When Pixar tried to close the rights for the film and start development, Fox changed their mind, and the film returned to Fox. The film was officially greenlit in 2009, under the title ''Leaf Men''.<ref name="Variety1" /> In May 2012, Fox announced the final title for the film (''Epic'') 3D-CGI its first cast details, and a plot.<ref name="Deadline1" /> According to Wedge, he was not satisfied with the renaming, which was decided by the marketing department. He also expressed dissatisfaction with subtitles given to the film in some non-English countries, including the French subtitle, ''The Battle of the Secret Kingdom''.<ref>{{cite web|title=(INTERVIEW) A PROPOS D’EPIC AVEC CHRIS WEDGE|url=http://www.focusonanimation.com/interview-propos-depic-chris-wedge-18393/|accessdate=October 8, 2013|publisher=Focus on Animation|date=October 8, 2013|author=Nbu|language=French}}</ref>

Although the film is based on and borrows many characters from Joyce's book, its plot has been significantly changed. Wedge explained: "[W]hile Bill wrote a wonderful book, it is a quaint story. We wanted to make a gigantic action-adventure movie." To address online speculations about whether the film is similar to other films, like ''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]]'' or ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', Wedge said: "I hate to associate it with other movies. It is adventure on the scale of ''[[Star Wars]]''. And it does immerse the audience completely in a world like ''Avatar''. But it has its own personality."<ref name="USATodaySneak" />

==Release==
The film was released publicly on May 16, 2013, in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Germany, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web|author=EpicINTL Release Dates in Facebook |url=https://www.facebook.com/EpicTheMovie/app_151503908244383 |title=Epic - INTL Release Dates |publisher=Facebook |date=|accessdate=May 23, 2013}}</ref> The film was theatrically released in the United States on May 24, 2013.<ref name="USATodaySneak" />

===Critical reception===
''Epic'' received generally mixed reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 65% approval rating based on 127 reviews, with an average score of 5.85/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "Though its narrative themes are all too familiar, ''Epic'' is beautifully animated and crafted with just enough flair to make for solid family entertainment."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/epic_2013/ |title=Epic (2013)|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=August 20, 2012 |accessdate=December 24, 2019}}</ref> Another review aggregation website, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized]] rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 52 out of 100 based on 30 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/epic-2013 |title=Epic Reviews |publisher=CBS Interactive | work = Metacritic |date=|accessdate=May 23, 2013}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an "A" grade on an A+-to-F scale, while specifically child audiences gave it an "A+" grade. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-report-fast-6-558677|title=Box Office Report: 'Fast 6' Earns $122 Million-Plus, Runs 'Hangover III' Off Course|work=The Hollywood Reporter|last=McClintock |first=Pamela|date=May 27, 2013|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref>

Stephan Lee of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a B+, saying "The story lacks the specialness of a [[Pixar]] movie—it retreads the same eco-battle archetypes as ''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest|FernGully]]'' and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]—''but it's a perfectly appealing explosion of color for a lazy summer day."<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Stephan |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20687762,00.html |title=Epic Movie Review Review |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=May 22, 2013 |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}</ref> Michael Rechtshaffen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a mixed review, saying "Where the animated film comes up short is on the inspiration front—despite the intriguing terrain, its stock inhabitants lack the sort of unique personality traits that would prevent them from feeling overly familiar."<ref>{{cite news |last=Rechtshaffen |first=Michael |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/epic/review/525671 |title=Epic Review |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}</ref> Michael Phillips of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film two stars, saying "It's difficult to keep its story and characters, or even its visual design, in your mind's eye, in part because the five credited screenwriters overload the narrative with incident and threatening complication."<ref>{{cite news|last=Phillips |first=Michael |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-epic-movie-review-20130523,0,1430441.column |title='Epic' can't see the forest for the plot |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 23, 2013 |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}</ref> Kyle Smith of the ''[[New York Post]]'' gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, saying "It’s not that the plot of ''Epic'' is complex; it’s just untidy.
