'''Google Search''',  or simply '''Google''', is a [[web search engine]] developed by [[Google|Google LLC]]. It is the most used search engine on the [[World Wide Web]] across all platforms, with 92.62% market share as of June 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share|title=Search Engine Market Share Worldwide {{!}} StatCounter Global Stats|website=StatCounter Global Stats|access-date=July 8, 2019}}</ref> handling more than 5.4 billion searches each day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/|title=Google Search Statistics - Internet Live Stats|website=www.internetlivestats.com|language=en|access-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref>

The order of search results returned by Google is based, in part, on a priority rank system called "[[PageRank]]". Google Search also provides many different options for customized search, using symbols to include, exclude, specify or require certain search behavior, and offers specialized interactive experiences, such as flight status and package tracking, weather forecasts, currency, unit, and time conversions, word definitions, and more.

The main purpose of Google Search is to search for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers, as opposed to other data, such as [[Image search|images]] or [[Database search engine|data contained in databases]]. It was originally developed in 1997 by [[Larry Page]], [[Sergey Brin]], and [[Willow Garage|Scott Hassan]].<ref name="vanityfair">{{cite web |last1=Fisher |first1=Adam |title=Brin, Page, and Mayer on the Accidental Birth of the Company that Changed Everything |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/valley-of-genius-excerpt-google |website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=July 10, 2018 |access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=McHugh |first1=Josh |title=Google vs. Evil |url=https://www.wired.com/2003/01/google-10/ |access-date=August 24, 2019 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=January 1, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=D'Onfro |first1=Jillian |title=How a billionaire who wrote Google's original code created a robot revolution |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/a-look-back-at-willow-garage-2016-2 |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=February 13, 2016}}</ref> In June 2011, Google introduced "[[Google Voice Search]]" to search for spoken, rather than typed, words.<ref name="Official announcement">Google (Tue June 14, 2011) [https://www.google.com/insidesearch/press.html#blog Official announcement]</ref> In May 2012, Google introduced a [[Knowledge Graph]] [[semantic search]] feature in the U.S.

=== "Caffeine" search architecture upgrade ===
In August 2009, Google invited web developers to test a new search architecture, codenamed "Caffeine", and give their feedback. The new architecture provided no visual differences in the user interface, but added significant speed improvements and a new "under-the-hood" indexing infrastructure. The move was interpreted in some quarters as a response to [[Microsoft]]'s recent release of an upgraded version of its own search service, renamed [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], as well as the launch of [[Wolfram Alpha]], a new search engine based on "computational knowledge".<ref>{{cite news |first=Emma |last=Barnett |title=Google reveals caffeine: a new faster search engine |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/6009176/Google-reveals-caffeine-a-new-faster-search-engine.html |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=August 11, 2009 |access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Vanessa |last=Fox |title=Google Caffeine: Google's New Search Engine Index |url=https://searchengineland.com/caffeine-googles-new-search-index-23823 |website=[[Search Engine Land]] |date=August 10, 2009 |access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref> Google announced completion of "Caffeine" on June 8, 2010, claiming 50% fresher results due to continuous updating of its index.<ref>{{cite web |first=Vanessa |last=Fox |title=Google's New Indexing Infrastructure "Caffeine" Now Live |url=https://searchengineland.com/googles-new-indexing-infrastructure-caffeine-now-live-43891 |website=[[Search Engine Land]] |date=June 8, 2010 |access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref>

With "Caffeine", Google moved its back-end indexing system away from [[MapReduce]] and onto [[Bigtable]], the company's distributed database platform.<ref>{{cite web |first=Cade |last=Metz |title=Google search index splits with MapReduce |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/09/google_caffeine_explained |website=[[The Register]] |publisher=Situation Publishing |date=September 9, 2010 |access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Cade |last=Metz |title=Google Caffeine: What it really is |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/14/google_caffeine_truth/ |website=[[The Register]] |publisher=Situation Publishing |date=August 14, 2009 |access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref>

=== "Medic" search algorithm update ===
In August 2018, [[Danny Sullivan (technologist)|Danny Sullivan]] from Google announced a broad core algorithm update. As per current analysis done by the industry leaders Search Engine Watch and Search Engine Land, the update was to drop down the medical and health-related websites that were not user friendly and were not providing good user experience. This is why the industry experts named it "Medic".<ref>{{cite web |first=Barry |last=Schwartz |title=Google's Aug. 1 core algorithm update: Who did it impact, and how much |url=https://searchengineland.com/googles-august-first-core-algorithm-update-who-did-it-impact-and-how-much-303538 |website=[[Search Engine Land]] |date=August 9, 2018}}</ref>

Google reserves very high standards for YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) pages. This is because misinformation can affect users financially, physically, or emotionally. Therefore, the update targeted particularly those YMYL pages that have low-quality content and misinformation. This resulted in the algorithm targeting health and medical-related websites more than others. However, many other websites from other industries were also negatively affected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seroundtable.com/google-medic-update-26177.html|title=Google Medic Update: Google's Core Search Update Had Big Impact On Health/Medical Sites|website=seroundtable.com|access-date=March 11, 2019}}</ref>

Google Search consists of a series of [[Website localization|localized websites]]. The largest of those, the [https://www.google.com/?safe=active&ssui=on google.com site], is the top most-visited website in the world.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.alexa.com/topsites |title=Top 500|publisher=[[Alexa Internet]]}}</ref> Some of its features include a definition link for most searches including dictionary words, the number of results you got on your search, links to other searches (e.g. for words that Google believes to be misspelled, it provides a link to the search results using its proposed spelling), and many more.

* <code>OR</code> – Search for webpages containing one of two similar queries, such as ''marathon OR race''
* <code>-</code> (minus sign) – Exclude a word or a phrase, such as ''"apple -tree"'' searches where word ''"tree"'' is not used
* <code>""</code> – Force inclusion of a word or a phrase, such as ''"tallest building"''
* <code>*</code> – Placeholder symbol allowing for any substitute words in the context of the query, such as ''"largest * in the world"''
* <code>..</code> – Search within a range of numbers, such as ''"camera $50..$100"''
* <code>site:</code> – Search within a specific website, such as ''"site:[[YouTube|youtube.com]]"''
* <code>define:</code> – See a definition of a word, such as ''"define:phrase"''
* <code>stocks:</code> – See the stock price of investments, such as ''"stocks:googl"''
* <code>related:</code> – Find webpages related to specific [[URL]] addresses, such as ''"related:www.wikipedia.org"''
* <code>cache:</code> – Highlights the search-words within the cached pages, such as ''"cache:www.google.com xxx"'' shows cached content with word "xxx" highlighted.
* <code>@</code> – Search for a specific word on social media networks, such as ''"@[[twitter]]"''

==== Query expansion ====
Google applies [[query expansion]] to submitted search queries, using techniques to deliver results that it considers "smarter" than the query users actually submitted. This technique involves several steps, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.searchenginejournal.com/what-is-google-query-expansion-cases-and-examples/7924/|title=What is Google Query Expansion?

* Word [[stemming]] – Certain words can be reduced so other, similar terms, are also found in results, such as ''"translator"'' can also search for ''"translation"''
* Acronyms – Searching for abbreviations can also return results about the name in its full length, such as ''"[[NATO]]"'' can show results for ''"North Atlantic Treaty Organization"''
* Misspellings – Google will often suggest correct spellings for misspelled words
* Synonyms – In most cases where a word is incorrectly used in a phrase or sentence, Google search will show results based on the correct synonym
* Translations – The search engine can, in some instances, suggest results for specific words in a different language
* Ignoring words – In some search queries containing extraneous or insignificant words, Google search will simply drop those specific words from the query

=== "I'm Feeling Lucky" ===
{{redirect|I'm Feeling Lucky|the 2011 book by Douglas Edwards|I'm Feeling Lucky (book)}}

Google's homepage includes a button labeled "I'm Feeling Lucky". This feature originally allowed users to type in their search query, click the button and be taken directly to the first result, bypassing the search results page. With the 2010 announcement of [[#Instant search|Google Instant]], an automatic feature that immediately displays relevant results as users are typing in their query, the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button disappears, requiring that users opt-out of Instant results through search settings to keep using the "I'm Feeling Lucky" functionality.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lifewire.com/im-feeling-lucky-button-1616813|title=How to Use Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky" Button|last=Karch|first=Marziah|date=November 25, 2017|website=[[Lifewire]]|publisher=[[Dotdash]]|access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref> In 2012, "I'm Feeling Lucky" was changed to serve as an advertisement for Google services; users hover their computer mouse over the button, it spins and shows an emotion ("I'm Feeling Puzzled" or "I'm Feeling Trendy", for instance), and, when clicked, takes users to a Google service related to that emotion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/261363/google_changes_im_feeling_lucky_button.html|title=Google Changes 'I'm Feeling Lucky' Button|last=Paul|first=Ian|date=August 24, 2012|website=[[PC World]]|publisher=[[International Data Group]]|access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref>

Tom Chavez of "Rapt", a firm helping to determine a website's advertising worth, estimated in 2007 that Google lost $110 million in revenue per year due to use of the button, which bypasses the advertisements found on the search results page.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marketplace.org/2007/11/19/world/are-you-feeling-lucky-google|title=Are you feeling lucky?

== Search results ==

=== Universal search ===
"Universal search" was launched by Google on May 16, 2007 as an idea that merged the results from different kinds of search types into one. Prior to Universal search, a standard Google search would consist of links only to websites. Universal search, however, incorporates a wide variety of sources, including websites, news, pictures, maps, blogs, videos, and more, all shown on the same search results page.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2007/05/16/googles-move-to-universal-search/|title=Google's move to "universal search"|last=Marshall|first=Matt|date=May 16, 2007|website=[[VentureBeat]]|access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://searchengineland.com/google-20-google-universal-search-11232|title=Google Launches "Universal Search" & Blended Results|last=Sullivan|first=Danny|date=May 16, 2007|website=[[Search Engine Land]]|access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref> [[Marissa Mayer]], then-vice president of search products and user experience, described the goal of Universal search as "we're attempting to break down the walls that traditionally separated our various search properties and integrate the vast amounts of information available into one simple set of search results.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://googleblog.blogspot.no/2007/05/universal-search-best-answer-is-still.html|title=Universal search: The best answer is still the best answer|last=Mayer|first=Marissa|author-link=Marissa Mayer|date=May 16, 2007|website=Official Google Blog|access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref>

In June 2017, Google expanded its search results to cover available job listings. The data is aggregated from various major job boards and collected by analyzing company homepages. Initially only available in English, the feature aims to simplify finding jobs suitable for each user.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/google-launches-its-ai-powered-jobs-search-engine/|title=Google launches its AI-powered jobs search engine|last=Lardinois|first=Frederic|date=June 20, 2017|website=[[TechCrunch]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|access-date=June 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-for-jobs-is-ready-to-help-your-employment-search/|title=Google for Jobs is ready to help your employment search|last=Gebhart|first=Andrew|date=June 20, 2017|website=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|access-date=June 22, 2017}}</ref>

=== Rich snippets ===
In May 2009, Google announced that they would be parsing website [[microformat]]s to populate search result pages with "Rich snippets". Such snippets include additional details about results, such as displaying reviews for restaurants and social media accounts for individuals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://searchengineland.com/google-search-now-supports-microformats-and-adds-rich-snippets-to-search-results-19055|title=Google Search Now Supports Microformats and Adds "Rich Snippets" to Search Results|last=Fox|first=Vanessa|date=May 12, 2009|website=[[Search Engine Land]]|access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref>

In May 2016, Google expanded on the "Rich snippets" format to offer "Rich cards", which, similarly to snippets, display more information about results, but shows them at the top of the mobile website in a swipeable carousel-like format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://searchengineland.com/google-launches-rich-cards-movies-recipe-websites-249771|title=Google launches rich cards for movie and recipe websites|last=Schwartz|first=Barry|date=May 17, 2016|website=[[Search Engine Land]]|access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref> Originally limited to movie and recipe websites in the United States only, the feature expanded to all countries globally in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://searchengineland.com/google-expands-rich-cards-worldwide-272178|title=Google quietly expands rich cards worldwide|last=Schwartz|first=Barry|date=March 29, 2017|website=[[Search Engine Land]]|access-date=December 9, 2017}}</ref>

Now the web publishers can have greater control over the rich snippets. Preview settings from these meta tags will become effective in mid-to-late October 2019 and may take about a week for the global rollout to complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z6eZNXhRSc|title=Featured Snippets Google SEO Update|last=Zone|first=Ganpati|date=October 3, 2019|website=[[Ganpati Zone]]}}</ref>

Google Search has been accused of using a so-called zero-click search to prevent a large part of the traffic leaving its page to third-party publishers. As a result, 71% of searches end on the Google search page. In case of one specific query out of 890'000 searches on Google, only 30'000 resulted in the user clicking on the results website.<ref>{{Cite web|title=How Wikipedia Lost 3 Billion Organic Search Visits To Google in 2019 {{!}} Hacker Noon|url=https://hackernoon.com/how-wikipedia-lost-3-billion-organic-search-visits-to-google-in-2019-qz6630u6|access-date=2020-06-10|website=hackernoon.com}}</ref>

The Google feed is a personalized stream of articles, videos, and other news-related content. The feed contains a "mix of cards" which show topics of interest based on users' interactions with Google, or topics they choose to follow directly.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://mashable.com/2017/07/19/google-search-feed/|title=Google is using your entire search history to create a personalized news feed|last=Bell|first=Karissa|work=Mashable|access-date=May 22, 2018}}</ref> Cards include, "links to news stories, YouTube videos, sports scores, recipes, and other content based on what [Google] determined you're most likely to be interested in at that particular moment."<ref name=":0" /> Users can also tell Google they're not interested in certain topics to avoid seeing future updates.

== Ranking of results ==

=== PageRank ===
{{Main|PageRank}}

Google's rise was largely due to a patented [[algorithm]] called [[PageRank]] which helps rank web pages that match a given search string.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brin|first1=S.|last2=Page|first2=L.|author-link2=Larry Page|year=1998|title=The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine|url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf|journal=Computer Networks and ISDN Systems|volume=30|issue=1–7|pages=107–117|citeseerx=10.1.1.115.5930|doi=10.1016/S0169-7552(98)00110-X|issn=0169-7552|author-link1=Sergey Brin}}</ref> When Google was a Stanford research project, it was nicknamed [[BackRub]] because the technology checks [[backlinks]] to determine a site's importance. Other keyword-based methods to rank search results, used by many search engines that were once more popular than Google, would check how often the search terms occurred in a page, or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page. The PageRank algorithm instead analyzes human-generated [[hyperlink|links]] assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are also important. The algorithm computes a [[recursion|recursive]] score for pages, based on the weighted sum of other pages linking to them. PageRank is thought to [[correlation|correlate]] well with human concepts of importance. In addition to PageRank, Google, over the years, has added many other secret criteria for determining the ranking of resulting pages. This is reported to comprise over 250 different indicators,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html|title=Corporate Information: Technology Overview|access-date=November 15, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Levy|first=Steven|date=February 22, 2010|title=Exclusive: How Google's Algorithm Rules the Web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/02/ff_google_algorithm/|journal=Wired|publisher=Wired.com|volume=17|issue=12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416062117/http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/02/ff_google_algorithm/|archive-date=April 16, 2011}}</ref> the specifics of which are kept secret to avoid difficulties created by scammers and help Google maintain an edge over its competitors globally.

PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for [[RankDex]], developed by [[Robin Li]] in 1996. Larry Page's patent for PageRank filed in 1998 includes a citation to Li's earlier patent. Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine [[Baidu]] in 2000.<ref>[http://www.rankdex.com/about.html "About: RankDex"] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120120002301/http://www.rankdex.com/about.html |date= January 20, 2012}}, ''[[RankDex]]''</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Altucher |first1=James |title=10 Unusual Things About Google |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesaltucher/2011/03/18/10-unusual-things-about-google-also-the-worst-vc-decision-i-ever-made/ |date=March 18, 2011 |website=[[Forbes]] |access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = Method for node ranking in a linked database |url = https://www.google.com/patents/US6285999 |publisher = Google Patents |access-date = October 19, 2015 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151015185034/http://www.google.com/patents/US6285999 |archive-date = October 15, 2015}}</ref>

In a potential hint of Google's future direction of their Search algorithm, Google's then chief executive [[Eric Schmidt]], said in a 2007 interview with the ''Financial Times'': "The goal is to enable Google users to be able to ask the question such as 'What shall I do tomorrow?' and 'What job shall I take?'".<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/c3e49548-088e-11dc-b11e-000b5df10621,dwp_uuid=e8477cc4-c820-11db-b0dc-000b5df10621.html Google's goal: to organize your daily life] Financial Times</ref> Schmidt reaffirmed this during a 2010 interview with the Wall Street Journal: "I actually think most people don't want Google to answer their questions, they want Google to tell them what they should be doing next."<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704901104575423294099527212 Google and the Search for the Future] Wall Street Journal</ref>

In 2013 the [[European Commission]] found that Google Search favored Google's own products, instead of the best result for consumers' needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c308b656-a124-11e2-bae1-00144feabdc0.html|title=Google favours 'in-house' search results|last1=Barker|first1=Alex|last2=McCarthy|first2=Bede|date=April 9, 2013|website=www.ft.com|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|access-date=January 26, 2014}}</ref> In February 2015 Google announced a major change to its mobile search [[algorithm]] which would favor mobile friendly over other [[websites]]. Nearly 60% of Google [[online traffic|searches]] come from mobile phones. Google says it wants users to have access to premium quality [[websites]]. Those websites which lack a mobile-friendly [[Interface (computing)|interface]] would be ranked lower and it is expected that this update will cause a shake-up of [[Page rank|ranks]]. Businesses who fail to update their [[websites]] accordingly could see a dip in their regular websites traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/google-mobilegeddon-2015-4|title=Google is making a giant change this week that could crush millions of small businesses|last=D'Onfro|first=Jillian|date=April 19, 2015|website=Business Insider}}</ref>

=== Google optimization ===
{{Main|Search engine optimization}}

Because Google is the most popular [[Web search engine|search engine]], many [[webmaster]]s attempt to influence their website's Google rankings. An industry of consultants has arisen to help websites increase their rankings on Google and other search engines. This field, called [[search engine optimization]], attempts to discern patterns in search engine listings, and then develop a methodology for improving rankings to draw more searchers to their clients' sites. Search engine optimization encompasses both "on page" factors (like body copy, title elements, H1 heading elements and image [[alt attribute]] values) and Off Page Optimization factors (like [[anchor text]] and PageRank). The general idea is to affect Google's relevance algorithm by incorporating the keywords being targeted in various places "on page", in particular the title element and the body copy (note: the higher up in the page, presumably the better its keyword prominence and thus the ranking). Too many occurrences of the keyword, however, cause the page to look suspect to Google's spam checking algorithms. Google has published guidelines for website owners who would like to raise their rankings when using legitimate optimization consultants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/webmasters/guidelines.html|title=Google Webmaster Guidelines|access-date=November 15, 2009}}</ref> It has been hypothesized, and, allegedly, is the opinion of the owner of one business about which there have been numerous complaints, that negative publicity, for example, numerous consumer complaints, may serve as well to elevate page rank on Google Search as favorable comments.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/business/28borker.html|title=A Bully Finds a Pulpit on the Web|last=Segal|first=David|date=November 26, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=November 27, 2010}}</ref> The particular problem addressed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' article, which involved [[DecorMyEyes]], was addressed shortly thereafter by an undisclosed fix in the Google algorithm. According to Google, it was not the frequently published consumer complaints about DecorMyEyes which resulted in the high ranking but mentions on news websites of events which affected the firm such as legal actions against it. [[Google Search Console]] helps to check for websites that use duplicate or copyright content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/being-bad-to-your-customers-is-bad-for.html|title=Blogspot.com|publisher=Googleblog.blogspot.com|access-date=August 4, 2012}}</ref>

=== "Hummingbird" search algorithm upgrade ===
{{Main|Google Hummingbird}}
In 2013, Google significantly upgraded its search algorithm with "Hummingbird".

On certain occasions, the [[Google logo|logo]] on Google's webpage will change to a special version, known as a "Google Doodle".

With Google Instant, we estimate that we'll save our users 11 hours with each passing second!"<ref>{{cite web |first=Marissa |last=Mayer |author-link=Marissa Mayer |title=Search: now faster than the speed of type |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.no/2010/09/search-now-faster-than-speed-of-type.html |website=Official Google Blog |date=September 8, 2010 |access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref> Matt Van Wagner of ''[[Search Engine Land]]'' wrote that "Personally, I kind of like Google Instant and I think it represents a natural evolution in the way search works", and also praised Google's efforts in [[public relations]], writing that "With just a press conference and a few well-placed interviews, Google has parlayed this relatively minor speed improvement into an attention-grabbing front-page news story".<ref>{{cite web |first=Matt Van |last=Wagner |title=How Google Saved $100 Million By Launching Google Instant |url=https://searchengineland.com/how-google-saved-100-million-by-launching-google-instant-51270 |website=[[Search Engine Land]] |date=September 20, 2010 |access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref> The upgrade also became notable for the company switching Google Search's underlying technology from [[HTML]] to [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Gomes |title=Google Instant, behind the scenes |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.no/2010/09/google-instant-behind-scenes.html |website=Official Google Blog |date=September 9, 2010 |access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>

The publication ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]]'' compiled a list of words that Google Instant did not show suggested results for, with a Google spokesperson giving the following statement to ''[[Mashable]]'':<ref>{{cite web |first=Samuel |last=Axon |title=Which Words Does Google Instant Blacklist? |url=http://mashable.com/2010/09/28/google-instant-blacklist/ |website=[[Mashable]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=September 28, 2010 |access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>

{{quote|There are several reasons you may not be seeing search queries for a particular topic. Among other things, we apply a narrow set of removal policies for pornography, violence, and hate speech. It's important to note that removing queries from Autocomplete is a hard problem, and not as simple as blacklisting particular terms and phrases.

In search, we get more than one billion searches each day. Because of this, we take an algorithmic approach to removals, and just like our search algorithms, these are imperfect. We will continue to work to improve our approach to removals in Autocomplete, and are listening carefully to feedback from our users.

Our algorithms look not only at specific words, but compound queries based on those words, and across all languages. So, for example, if there's a bad word in Russian, we may remove a compound word including the transliteration of the Russian word into English. We also look at the search results themselves for given queries. So, for example, if the results for a particular query seem pornographic, our algorithms may remove that query from Autocomplete, even if the query itself wouldn't otherwise violate our policies. This system is neither perfect nor instantaneous, and we will continue to work to make it better.}}

''[[PC Magazine]]'' discussed the inconsistency in how some forms of the same topic are allowed; for instance, "lesbian" was blocked, while "gay" was not, and "cocaine" was blocked, while "crack" and "heroin" were not. The report further stated that seemingly normal words were also blocked due to pornographic innuendos, most notably "scat", likely due to having two completely separate contextual meanings, one for music and one for a sexual practice.<ref>{{cite web |first=Leslie |last=Horn |title=Google Instant Blacklist: Which Words Are Blocked? |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2369908,00.asp |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=September 29, 2010 |access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>

Google Real-Time Search was a feature of Google Search in which search results also sometimes included [[Real-time computing|real-time]] information from sources such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[blog]]s, and news websites.<ref name="mashablelaunch">[http://mashable.com/2009/12/07/google-real-time-search/ "Google launches Real-Time Search"].

[[Hashtag]] search links were also supported, as were "promoted" tweets hosted by Twitter (located persistently on top of the river) and thumbnails of retweeted image or video links.

In January 2011, geolocation links of posts were made available alongside results in Real-Time Search. In addition, posts containing syndicated or attached shortened links were made searchable by the ''link:'' query option. In July 2011 Real-Time Search became inaccessible, with the Real-Time link in the Google sidebar disappearing and a custom 404 error page generated by Google returned at its former URL.

== Privacy ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
{{Main|Privacy concerns regarding Google}}
Searches made by search engines, including Google, leave traces. This raises concerns about privacy. In principle, if details of a user's searches are found, those with access to the information—principally state agencies responsible for law enforcement and similar matters—can make deductions about the user's activities. This has been used for the detection and prosecution of lawbreakers; for example a murderer was found and convicted after searching for terms such as "tips with killing with a baseball bat".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/once-again-a-google-murder-case-13241|title=Once Again, A Google Murder Case, Jan 29, 2008|date=January 29, 2008|publisher=Search Engine Land|access-date=August 4, 2012}}</ref>

A search may leave traces both on a computer used to make the search, and in records kept by the search provider. When using a search engine through a browser program on a computer, search terms and other information may be stored on the computer by default, unless the browser is set not to do this, or they are erased. Saved terms may be discovered on forensic analysis of the computer. An [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP) or search engine provider (e.g., Google) may store records which relate search terms to an [[IP address]] and a time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-anonymizing-search-records-to-protect-privacy-10736|title=Google Anonymizing Search Records To Protect Privacy, March 14, 2007|date=March 14, 2007|publisher=Search Engine Land|access-date=August 4, 2012}}</ref> Whether such logs are kept, and access to them by law enforcement agencies, is subject to legislation in different jurisdictions and working practices; the law may mandate, prohibit, or say nothing about logging of various types of information. Some search engines, located in jurisdictions where it is not illegal, make a feature of not storing user search information.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://duckduckgo.com/|title=DuckDuckGo|work=duckduckgo.com|access-date=June 28, 2016}}</ref>

The keywords suggested by the [[Autocomplete]] feature show a population of users' research which is made possible by an [[identity management system]]. Volumes of personal data are collected via [[Eddystone (Google)|Eddystone]] [[web beacons|web]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/proximity|proximity]] beacons.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Google has been criticized for placing long-term [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] on users' machines to store these preferences, a tactic which also enables them to track a user's search terms and retain the data for more than a year.<ref name="ac">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-history-search-tracking-data-how-to-delete|title=Google tracks everything you do: here's how to delete it|author=Caddy, Becca|date=March 20, 2017|newspaper=Wired|access-date=March 20, 2017|agency=blogspot}}</ref>

In November 2013, Google started testing yellow labels for advertisements displayed in search results, to improve user experience.

On December 15, 2016, Google rolled out a new desktop search interface that mimics their modular mobile user interface.

In addition to its tool for searching [[webpage|web pages]], Google also provides services for searching [[raster graphics|images]], [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]]s, news websites, videos ('''Google Videos'''), searching by locality, maps, and items for sale online. '''Google Videos''' allows searching the [[World Wide Web]] for video clips.<ref name=":0g">{{Cite web|url=https://searchengineland.com/lets-celebrate-googles-biggest-failures-48165|title=Let's Celebrate Google's Biggest Failures!|last=Sullivan|first=Danny|date=August 5, 2010|website=Search Engine Land|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190405045443/https://searchengineland.com/lets-celebrate-googles-biggest-failures-48165|archive-date=April 5, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=April 5, 2019}}</ref> The service evolved from [[Google Video]], Google's discontinued video hosting service that also allowed to search the web for video clips.<ref name=":0g" />

There are also products available from Google that are not directly search-related. [[Gmail]], for example, is a [[webmail]] application, but still includes search features; [[Google Browser Sync]] does not offer any search facilities, although it aims to organize your browsing time.

Also Google starts many new beta products, like Google Social Search or [[Google Image Swirl]].

In 2009, Google claimed that a search query requires altogether about 1 [[Joule|kJ]] or 0.0003 [[Kilowatt hours|kW·h]],<ref>[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/powering-google-search.html Blogspot.com], Powering a Google search</ref> which is enough to raise the temperature of one liter of water by 0.24&nbsp;°C.

Google flags search results with the message "This site may harm your computer" if the site is known to install malicious software in the background or otherwise surreptitiously. For approximately 40 minutes on January 31, 2009, all search results were mistakenly classified as [[malware]] and could therefore not be clicked; instead a warning message was displayed and the user was required to enter the requested URL manually.

=== Possible misuse of search results ===
In 2007, a group of researchers observed a tendency for users to rely on Google Search exclusively for finding information, writing that "With the Google interface the user gets the impression that the search results imply a kind of totality. ... In fact, one only sees a small part of what one could see if one also integrates other research tools."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iicm.tugraz.at/iicm_papers/dangers_google.pdf|title=Report on dangers and opportunities posed by large search engines, particularly Google|last1=Maurer|first1=H.|last2=Balke|first2=Tilo|date=September 30, 2007|website=[[Graz University of Technology]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229105054/http://www.iicm.tugraz.at/iicm_papers/dangers_google.pdf|archive-date=December 29, 2009|access-date=June 13, 2017|last3=Kappe|first3=Frank|last4=Kulathuramaiyer|first4=Narayanan|last5=Weber|first5=Stefan|last6=Zaka|first6=Bilal}}</ref>

In 2011, Google Search query results have been shown by Internet activist [[Eli Pariser]] to be tailored to users, effectively isolating users in what he defined as a [[filter bubble]].

In 2012, the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] fined Google [[US$]]22.5 million for violating their agreement not to violate the privacy of users of Apple's [[Safari (web browser)|Safari web browser]].<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com//news/americas/2012/08/201289172541616218.html "Google fined over Safari privacy violation."] ''Al Jazeera'', August 10, 2012.</ref> The FTC was also continuing to investigate if Google's favoring of their own services in their search results violated antitrust regulations.<ref>Bailey, Brandon.

=== Big Data and human bias ===
Google [[Web search engine|search engine]] robots are programmed to use [[algorithm]]s that understand and predict human [[behavior]]. The book, ''Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code''<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code|last=Benjamin|first=Ruha|publisher=Polity Press|year=2019|isbn=9781509526437|location=65 Bridge Street Cambridge CB2 1UR, UK|pages=94–95}}</ref> by [[Ruha Benjamin]] talks about human [[bias]] as a behavior that the google search engine can recognize. In 2016, some users google searched "three Black teenagers" and images of criminal [[Mug shot|mugshots]] of young African American teenagers came up. Then, the users searched "three White teenagers" and were presented with photos of smiling, happy teenagers. They also searched for "three Asian teenagers", and very revealing photos of Asian girls and women appeared. Benjamin concluded that these results reflect human [[prejudice]] and views on different [[ethnic group]]s. A group of analysts explained the concept of a [[Racism|racist]] computer program: "The idea here is that computers, unlike people, can't be racist but we're increasingly learning that they do in fact take after their makers...Some experts believe that this problem might stem from the hidden biases in the massive piles of [[data]] that the algorithms process as they learn to recognize patterns...reproducing our worst values".<ref name=":1" />

== Trademark ==
As people talk about "googling" rather than searching, the company has taken some steps to defend its trademark, in an effort to prevent it from becoming a [[generic trademark]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3006486.stm|title=Google calls in the 'language police'|last=Duffy|first=Jonathan|date=June 20, 2003|work=BBC News|access-date=April 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/google-it-search-engine-s-trademark-may-be-verb-it-s-not-generic|title="Google It": The Search Engine's Trademark May Be a Verb, But It's Not Generic|last1=Ash|first1=Karen Artz|last2=Danow|first2=Bret J.|website=The National Law Review|access-date=April 10, 2019}}</ref> This has led to lawsuits, threats of lawsuits, and the use of euphemisms, such as calling Google Search a '''famous web search engine'''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=5 June 2013|title=Feedback: Weight in dollars squared|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21829202-500-feedback-weight-in-dollars-squared/|access-date=2020-11-08|website=New Scientist|language=en-US}}</ref>
