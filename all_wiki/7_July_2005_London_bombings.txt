The '''7 July 2005 London bombings''', often referred to as '''7/7''', were a series of coordinated [[Islamic terrorism|Islamist]] [[suicide attack]]s in [[London]], England, that targeted commuters travelling on [[Transport in London|the city's public transport system]] during the morning rush hour.

Four terrorists separately detonated three homemade bombs in quick succession aboard [[London Underground]] trains across the city and, later, a fourth on a double-decker bus in [[Tavistock Square]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/7-7-anniversary-uk-s-risk-of-terror-attack-higher-now-than-days-of-london-bombings-1-7341303|title=7/7 Anniversary: UK's Risk of Terror Attack Higher Now than Days of London Bombings'|newspaper=Yorkshire Post|date=4 July 2015}}</ref> The train bombings occurred on the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle line]] near {{lus|Aldgate}} and at [[Edgware Road tube station (Circle, District and Hammersmith & City lines)|Edgware Road]], and on the [[Piccadilly line]] near {{lus|Russell Square}}.

Apart from the bombers, 52 UK residents of 18 different nationalities were killed and more than 700 were injured in the attacks, making it the UK's deadliest terrorist incident since the 1988 bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] near [[Lockerbie]], Scotland, and England's deadliest since [[World War II]], as well as the country's first Islamist suicide attack.

The explosions were caused by [[acetone peroxide|triacetone triperoxide]] [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] packed into [[backpack]]s. The bombings were followed two weeks later by [[21 July 2005 London bombings|a series of attempted attacks]] that failed to cause injury or damage.

{{Further information|Timeline of the 2005 London bombings}}
{{see also|Attacks on the London Underground}}

At 8:49&nbsp;am, on Thursday 7 July 2005, three bombs were detonated on board London Underground trains within 50 seconds of each other:

# The first bomb exploded on a six-car [[London Underground C69 and C77 Stock]] [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle line]] sub-surface train, number 204, travelling eastbound between [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]] and [[Aldgate tube station|Aldgate]]. The train had left [[King's Cross St Pancras tube station|King's Cross St Pancras]] about eight minutes earlier. At the time of the explosion, the train's third car was approximately 100 yards (90&nbsp;m) along the tunnel from Liverpool Street. The parallel track of the [[Hammersmith & City line]] between Liverpool Street and [[Aldgate East tube station|Aldgate East]] was also damaged in the blast.
# The second bomb exploded in the second car of another six-car London Underground C69 and C77 Stock Circle line sub-surface train, number 216, which had just left platform 4 at [[Edgware Road tube station (Circle, District and Hammersmith & City lines)|Edgware Road]] and was travelling westbound towards [[Paddington tube station (Bakerloo, Circle and District lines)|Paddington]]. The train had left King's Cross St Pancras about eight minutes previously. There were several other trains nearby at the time of the explosion; an eastbound Circle line train (arriving at platform 3 at Edgware Road from Paddington) was passing next to the bombed train and was damaged,<ref name="lucky-driver">{{cite news |title=I'm lucky to be here, says driver |date=11 July 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4671767.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110184312/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4671767.stm|archivedate=10 November 2006 |url-status=live |accessdate=12 November 2006}}</ref> as was a wall that later collapsed. Two other trains were at Edgware Road: an unidentified train on platform 2 and a southbound Hammersmith & City line service that had just arrived at platform 1.
# A third bomb was detonated on a 6-car [[London Underground 1973 Stock]] [[Piccadilly line]] deep-level Underground train, number 311, travelling southbound from King's Cross St Pancras to [[Russell Square tube station|Russell Square]]. The device exploded approximately one minute after the service departed King's Cross, by which time it had travelled about 500 yards (450&nbsp;m). The explosion occurred at the rear of the first car of the train—number 166—causing severe damage to the rear of that car as well as the front of the second one.<ref name="north-diary">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4670099.stm|title=Coming together as a city|accessdate=12 November 2006|date=15 July 2005|last=North|first=Rachel|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The surrounding tunnel also sustained damage.

It was originally thought that there had been six, rather than three, explosions on the Underground network. The bus bombing brought the reported total to seven; this was clarified later in the day. The erroneous reporting can be attributed to the fact that the blasts occurred on trains that were between stations, causing wounded passengers to emerge from both stations, giving the impression that there was an incident at each. Police also revised the timings of the tube blasts: initial reports had indicated that they occurred during a period of almost half an hour. This was due to initial confusion at London Underground (LU), where the explosions were originally believed to have been caused by [[Voltage spike|power surges]]. An early report, made in the minutes after the explosions, involved a person under a train, while another described a derailment (both of which did occur, but only as a result of the explosions). A [[Code amber alert (London Underground)|code amber alert]] was declared by LU at 09:19, and LU began to cease the network's operations, ordering trains to continue only to the next station and suspending all services.<ref name="tube-log">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4674469.stm|title=Tube log shows initial confusion|accessdate=12 November 2006|date=12 July 2005|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

[[File:Trapped underground.jpg|thumb|right|Passengers awaiting evacuation from a bombed train between [[King's Cross St Pancras tube station|King's Cross]] and [[Russell Square tube station|Russell Square]]]]
The effects of the explosions varied due to the differing characteristics of the tunnels in which each occurred:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/london_blasts/what_happened/html/russell_sq.stm|title=Indepth London Attacks|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref>
* The Circle line is a "[[cut and cover]]" sub-surface<!--this is the term of art used on London Underground for this type of tunnel--> tunnel, about 7&nbsp;m (21&nbsp;ft) deep. As the tunnel contains two parallel tracks, it is relatively wide. The two explosions on the Circle line were probably able to vent their force into the tunnel, reducing their destructive force.
* The Piccadilly line is a deep-level tunnel, up to 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) below the surface and with narrow (3.56&nbsp;m, or 11&nbsp;ft&nbsp;{{frac|8|1|4}}&nbsp;in) single-track tubes and just 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in) clearances. This confined space reflected the blast force, concentrating its effect.

===Tavistock Square bus===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2020}}
Almost one hour after the attacks on the London Underground, a fourth bomb was detonated on the top deck of a [[London Buses route 30|number 30]] [[double-decker bus]], a [[Dennis Trident 2]] (fleet number 17758, registration LX03&nbsp;BUF, two years in service at the time) operated by [[Stagecoach London]] and travelling its route from [[Marble Arch]] to [[Hackney Wick]].

Earlier, the bus had passed through the [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross area]] as it travelled from Hackney Wick to Marble Arch. At its final destination, the bus turned around and started the return route to Hackney Wick. The bus left Marble Arch at 9&nbsp;am and arrived at [[Euston bus station]] at 9:35&nbsp;am, where crowds of people had been evacuated from the tube and boarded buses as an alternate method of transport.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/london_bombing/timeline050707.html|title=London Blasts Timeline|access-date=June 30, 2020|newspaper=CBC News|date=July 22, 2005}}</ref>

[[File:7 July London bombings locations.png|right|thumb|Locations of the bombings on a Central London tube map]]
The explosion at 9:47&nbsp;am in Tavistock Square ripped off the roof and destroyed the rear portion of the bus. The blast took place near BMA House, the headquarters of the [[British Medical Association]], on [[Upper Woburn Place]]. A number of doctors and medical staff in or near that building were able to provide immediate emergency assistance.<ref>{{cite news|title=In a Day of Awfulness, We Were Lucky to Do Some Good|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-33363949|accessdate=30 June 2020|work=BBC News|date=7 July 2015}}</ref>

Witnesses reported seeing "papers and half a bus flying through the air".<ref>{{cite news|title=Bus 'Ripped Apart' in Explosion|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4659387.stm|accessdate=30 June 2020|work=BBC News|date=7 July 2005}}</ref> [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' later reported that two injured bus passengers said that they saw a man exploding in the bus.<ref name="campbell-laville">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/13/july7.uksecurity6|title=British suicide bombers carried out London attacks, say police|first1=Duncan|last1=Campbell|first2=Sandra|last2=Laville|accessdate=15 November 2006|date=13 July 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|authorlink=Duncan Campbell (The Guardian)}}</ref>

The location of the bomb inside the bus meant the front of the vehicle remained mostly intact. Most of the passengers at the front of the top deck survived, as did those near the front of the lower deck, including the driver, but those at the rear of the bus suffered more serious injuries, with several individuals being blown from the bus. The extent of the damage caused to the victims' bodies resulted in a lengthy delay in announcing the death toll from the bombing while the police determined how many bodies were present and whether the bomber was one of them. Several passers-by were also injured by the explosion and surrounding buildings were damaged by debris.<ref>{{cite news|title=In a Day of Awfulness, We Were Lucky to Do Some Good|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-33363949|accessdate=30 June 2020|work=BBC News|date=7 July 2015}}</ref>

The bombed bus was subsequently covered with tarpaulin and removed by low-loader for forensic examination at a secure [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] site. The vehicle was ultimately returned to Stagecoach and scrapped thereafter on 15 October 2009. A replacement bus, a new [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400]] (fleet number 18500, which has been changed since to 19000, registration LX55&nbsp;HGC), was named "[[Spirit of London]]". In October 2012, the "Spirit of London" bus was set alight in an arson attack.<ref name=bbcarson>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20014969|title=Suspected arson on 7/7 tribute bus 'Spirit of London'|publisher=BBC News|date=20 October 2012|accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref> It was repaired and refurbished at a cost of £60,000 and re-entered service in April 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stagecoach.com/media/news-releases/2013/2013-23-04-spirit-of-london-relaunch.aspx|title=Stagecoach relaunches 'Spirit of London' bus following arson attack – Stagecoach Group|publisher=stagecoach.com}}</ref> Two 14-year-old girls were charged for the attack.<ref name=bbcarson/>

The 52 victims were of diverse backgrounds; among them were several foreign-born British nationals and foreign exchange students. The majority of the victims lived in or near London. Because of train delays before the attacks and subsequent transport problems caused by them, several victims died aboard trains and buses they would not normally have taken. Their ages ranged from 20 to 60 years old, with an average age of 34.

All of the victims were UK residents; 32 of them were British. One victim each came from Afghanistan, France, Ghana, Grenada, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, Mauritius, New Zealand, Nigeria, Romania, Sri Lanka, and Turkey. Three victims were Polish nationals, while one victim was a [[Vietnamese Australians|Vietnamese born Australian]] and one held dual [[Vietnamese Americans|American-Vietnamese]] citizenship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/77-bombings-london-anniversary-live-the-52-victims-of-the-london-terror-attacks-remembered-10369569.html|title=The 52 victims of the 7/7 bombings remembered|date=6 July 2015|language=en-GB|access-date=25 August 2016}}</ref>

Seven of the victims were killed at Aldgate, six at Edgware Road, 26 at King's Cross and 13 at Tavistock Square.

Retrieved 3 December 2006.</ref>]]

The four suicide bombers were later identified as:
* '''[[Mohammad Sidique Khan]]:''' aged 30. Khan detonated his bomb just after leaving Edgware Road tube station on a train travelling toward Paddington, at 8:50&nbsp;am. He lived in [[Beeston, Leeds|Beeston]], Leeds, with his wife and young child, where he worked as a learning mentor at a primary school. The blast killed seven people, including Khan himself.
* '''[[Shehzad Tanweer]]:''' aged 22. He detonated a bomb aboard a train travelling between Liverpool Street station and Aldgate tube station, at 8:50&nbsp;am. He lived in Leeds with his mother and father, working in a fish and chip shop. Eight people, including Tanweer, were killed by the explosion.
* '''[[Germaine Lindsay]]:''' aged 19. He detonated his device on a train travelling between King's Cross and Russell Square tube stations, at 8:50&nbsp;am. He lived in [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire, with his pregnant wife and young son. The blast killed 27 people, including Lindsay himself.
* '''[[Hasib Hussain]]:''' the youngest of the four at 18, Hussain detonated his bomb on the top deck of a double-decker bus at 9:47&nbsp;am. He lived in Leeds with his brother and sister-in-law. 14 people, including Hussain, died in the explosion in Tavistock Square.

Three of the bombers were British-born sons of [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani immigrants]]; Lindsay was a [[conversion to Islam|convert]] born in [[British Jamaican|Jamaica]].

[[Charles Clarke]], [[Home Secretary]] when the attacks occurred, described the bombers as "[[cleanskin (security)|cleanskins]]", a term describing them as previously unknown to authorities until they carried out their attacks.<ref name="TheTimes-2007-05-06">

===Videotaped statements===
Two of the bombers made videotapes describing their reasons for becoming what they called "soldiers". In a videotape broadcast by [[Al Jazeera]] on 1 September 2005, Mohammad Sidique Khan, described his motivation. The tape had been edited and mentioned [[al-Qaeda]] members [[Osama Bin Laden]], [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] and [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], describing them as "today's heroes". Khan's tape said:<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4206800.stm London bomber: Text in full], BBC, 1 September 2005. Retrieved 14 October 2010.</ref>
{{quote|I and thousands like me are forsaking everything for what we believe. Our drive and motivation doesn't come from tangible commodities that this world has to offer. Our religion is [[Islam]], obedience to the one true God and following the footsteps of the final prophet messenger. Your democratically-elected governments continuously perpetuate atrocities against my people all over the world. And your support of them makes you directly responsible, just as I am directly responsible for protecting and avenging my Muslim brothers and sisters. Until we feel security you will be our targets and until you stop the bombing, gassing, imprisonment and torture of my people we will not stop this fight. We are at war and I am a soldier. Now you too will taste the reality of this situation.}}

The tape continued:
{{quote|...I myself, I myself, I make [[dua]] (pray) to [[Allah]] ... to raise me amongst those whom I love like the [[Prophets in Islam|prophets]], the messengers, the martyrs and today's heroes like our beloved Sheikh Osama Bin Laden, Dr Ayman al-Zawahri and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and all the other brothers and sisters that are fighting in the ... of this cause.}}

On 6 July 2006, a videotaped statement by Shehzad Tanweer was broadcast by [[Al-Jazeera]]. In the video, which may have been edited<ref name="guardvideo">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/06/july7.uksecurity1|title=Video of London bomber released|work=The Guardian|date=8 July 2006}}</ref> to include remarks by al-Zawahiri, Tanweer said:<ref>{{cite book | title=The Globalization of Martyrdom: Al Qaeda, Salafi Jihad, and the Diffusion of Suicide Attacks | publisher=JHU Press | author=Moghadam, Assaf | year=2011 | pages=199 | isbn=978-1421401447 | chapter=The United Kingdom and the 77 Bombings | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMeqBfA9-RUC&pg=PA199}}</ref>
{{quote|What you have witnessed now is only the beginning of a string of attacks that will continue and become stronger until you pull your forces out of Afghanistan and Iraq. And until you stop your financial and military support to America and Israel.}}

Tanweer argued that the non-Muslims of Britain deserve such attacks because they voted for a government which "continues to oppress our mothers, children, brothers and sisters in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], Afghanistan, Iraq and [[Chechnya]]."<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article683824.ece Video of London suicide bomber released], ''The Times'', 6 July 2006.

==Effects and response==

[[File:Blair G8 July7th05.jpg|thumb|[[Tony Blair]] announces the attack at the [[31st G8 summit]] in Scotland]]

===Initial reports===
Initial reports suggested that a power surge on the Underground power grid had caused explosions in power circuits. This was later ruled out by power suppliers [[National Grid plc|National Grid]]. Commentators suggested that the explanation had been made because of bomb damage to power lines along the tracks; the rapid series of power failures caused by the explosions (or power being ended by means of switches at the locations to permit evacuation) looked similar, from the point of view of a control room operator, to a cascading series of circuit breaker operations that would result from a major power surge. A couple of hours after the bombings, Home Secretary Charles Clarke confirmed the incidents were terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Incidents in London|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050707/debtext/50707-11.htm#column_465|publisher=[[United Kingdom Parliament]]|accessdate=30 July 2008}}</ref>

===Security alerts===
Although there were security alerts at many locations throughout the United Kingdom, no terrorist incidents occurred outside central London. Suspicious packages were destroyed in controlled explosions in [[Edinburgh]], [[Brighton]], [[Coventry]], [[Southampton]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Darlington]] and [[Nottingham]]. Security across the country was increased to the [[UK Threat Levels|highest alert level]].

''[[The Times]]'' reported on 17 July 2005 that police sniper units were following as many as a dozen al-Qaeda suspects in Britain. The covert armed teams were ordered to shoot to kill if surveillance suggested that a terror suspect was carrying a bomb and he refused to surrender if challenged. A member of the Metropolitan Police's [[Specialist Firearms Command]] said: "These units are trained to deal with any eventuality. Since the London bombs they have been deployed to look at certain people."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1697326,00.html |title=Police snipers track al-Qaeda suspects |work=The Times |date=17 July 2005 |accessdate=3 December 2006 |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022182920/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C2087-1697326%2C00.html |archivedate=22 October 2006 |first=Leo |last=Lewis }}</ref>

===Transport and telecoms disruption===
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2019}}
[[Vodafone]] reported that its mobile telephone network reached capacity at about 10&nbsp;am on the day of the bombings, and it was forced to initiate emergency procedures to prioritise emergency calls ([[ACCOLC]], the 'access overload control'). Other [[cellular network|mobile phone networks]] also reported failures, causing for example [[BBC Radio London]] reporters to use landline phones{{cn|date=July 2019}} and [[Sky News]] to use the station ticker for displaying messages from persons trying to contact their relatives{{cn|date=July 2019}}. The [[BBC]] speculated that the telephone system was shut down by security services to prevent the possibility of mobile phones being used to trigger bombs. Although this option was considered, it became clear later that the intermittent unavailability of both mobile and landline telephone systems was due only to excessive usage. ACCOLC was activated only in a {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} radius around Aldgate Tube Station because key emergency personnel did not have ACCOLC-enabled mobile phones.<ref>{{cite web|last=McCue|first=Andy|title=7/7 bomb rescue efforts hampered by communication failings|url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/networking/2006/06/05/77-bomb-rescue-efforts-hampered-by-communication-failings-39273086/|publisher=ZDNet UK|accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref> The communications failures during the emergency sparked discussions to improve London's [[emergency communication system|emergency communications system]].<ref>{{cite web|title=London Assembly 7 July Review Committee, follow-up re port |url=http://legacy.london.gov.uk/assembly/reports/7july/follow-up-report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107004751/http://legacy.london.gov.uk/assembly/reports/7july/follow-up-report.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 January 2012 |publisher=London Assembly |accessdate=18 April 2012 }}</ref>

For most of the day, central London's public transport system was largely out of service following the complete closure of the Underground, the closure of the Zone 1 [[List of bus routes in London|bus network]], and the evacuation of incident sites such as Russell Square. Bus services restarted at 4&nbsp;pm on 7 July, and most mainline railway stations resumed service soon afterward. [[River Thames|River]] vessels were pressed into service to provide a free alternative to overcrowded trains and buses. Local lifeboats were required to act as safety boats, including the Sheerness lifeboat from the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in Kent. Thousands of people chose to walk home or to the nearest Zone 2 bus or railway station. Most of the Underground, apart from the stations affected by the bombs, resumed service the next morning, though some commuters chose to stay at home. Affected stretches were also closed for police investigations.

Much of the King's Cross railway station was also closed, with the ticket hall and waiting area being used as a makeshift hospital to treat casualties. Although the station reopened later during the day, only suburban rail services were able to use it, with [[Great North Eastern Railway]] trains terminating at [[Peterborough railway station|Peterborough]] (the service was fully restored on 9 July). King's Cross St Pancras tube station remained available only to [[Metropolitan line]] services to facilitate the ongoing recovery and investigation for a week, though [[Victoria line]] services were restored on 15 July and the [[Northern line]] on 18 July. All of the damaged trains were removed in stages. [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras station]], located next to King's Cross, was shut on the afternoon of the attacks, with all [[Midland Mainline]] trains terminating at [[Leicester railway station|Leicester]], causing disruption to services to [[Sheffield]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Derby]].

[[File:Caledonian Road tube station closed.jpg|left|thumb|Underground stations, including [[Caledonian Road tube station|Caledonian Road]] (pictured), were closed across London]]
On 25 July, the Hammersmith & City line was reopened from Baker Street to Barking after the affected train was cleared at Aldgate, together with the stretch from Moorgate to Aldgate of the Metropolitan Line. The Hammersmith to Paddington part of the Hammersmith & City line was a shuttle service after the bombings. On 29 July, the District line was reopened from High Street Kensington to Edgware Road, after the affected train was cleared.

On 2 August the Hammersmith & City line resumed normal service; the Circle line was still suspended, though all Circle line stations are also served by other lines. The Piccadilly line service resumed on 4 August after the affected train was cleared on 16 July, and enhanced maintenance work was done. On 4 August, the Circle line was reopened again.

===Economic effect===
[[File:Headlines london bombing 7 july 2005 Waterloo station.JPG|thumb|Headlines outside [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]]]]

There were limited reactions to the attack in the [[world economy]] as measured by [[financial market]] and [[exchange rate]] activity. The value of the [[Pound sterling|British pound]] decreased 0.89 cents to a 19-month low against the US dollar. The [[FTSE 100 Index]] fell by about 200 points during the two hours after the first attack. This was its greatest decrease since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], and it triggered the [[London Stock Exchange]]'s 'Special Measures', restricting [[panic selling]] and aimed at ensuring market stability. By the time the market closed it had recovered to only 71.3 points (1.36%) down on the previous day's three-year closing high. Markets in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain also closed about 1% down on the day.

US market indexes increased slightly, partly because the dollar index increased sharply against the pound and the euro. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] gained 31.61 to 10,302.29. The [[Nasdaq|NASDAQ Composite Index]] increased 7.01 to 2075.66. The [[S&P 500]] increased 2.93 points to 1197.87 after decreasing as much as 1%. Every benchmark value gained 0.3%.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=aflPCIrU37Ns&refer=us|title=U.S. Stocks Rise, Erasing Losses on London Bombings; Gap Rises|first=Dune|last=Lawrence|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=7 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006}}</ref>

The market values increased again on 8 July as it became clear that the damage caused by the bombings was not as great as thought initially. By end of trading the market had recovered fully to above its level at start of trading on 7 July. Insurers in the UK tend to [[reinsurance|reinsure]] their terrorist liabilities in excess of the first £75,000,000 with [[Pool Re]], a mutual insurer established by the government with major insurers. Pool Re has substantial reserves and newspaper reports indicated that claims would easily be funded.

On 9 July, the [[Bank of England]], [[HM Treasury]] and the [[Financial Services Authority]] revealed that they had instigated contingency plans immediately after the attacks to ensure that the UK financial markets could keep trading. This involved the activation of a "secret chatroom" on the British government's Financial Sector Continuity website, which allowed the institutions to communicate with the country's banks and market dealers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4666225.stm|title=Banks talked via secret chatroom|publisher=BBC News|date=8 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006}}</ref>

===Media response===
[[File:Kings Cross press gazebo 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[News program|TV news]] tent at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]]]]
Continuous news coverage of the attacks was broadcast throughout 7 July, by both [[BBC One]] and [[ITV1]], uninterrupted until 7&nbsp;p.m. [[Sky News]] did not broadcast any advertisements for 24 hours. [[ITN]] confirmed later that its coverage on ITV1 was its longest uninterrupted on-air broadcast of its 50-year history. Television coverage was notable for the use of mobile telephone footage sent in by members of the public and live pictures from traffic [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras.

The [[BBC Online]] website recorded an all-time [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] peak of 11&nbsp;[[gigabit|Gb]]/s at midday on 7 July. [[BBC News]] received some 1&nbsp;billion total accesses throughout the course of the day (including all images, text and HTML), serving some 5.5 [[terabyte]]s of data. At peak times during the day there were 40,000-page requests per second for the BBC News website. The previous day's announcement of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] being awarded to London resulted in up to 5&nbsp;[[gigabit|Gb]]/s. The previous all time maximum for the website followed the announcement of the [[Trial of Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson verdict]], which used 7.2&nbsp;[[gigabit|Gb]]/s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/feedback/07July_Statistics.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703070502/http://www.bbc.co.uk/feedback/07July_Statistics.shtml|archivedate=3 July 2007|title=Statistics on BBC Webservers 7&nbsp;July&nbsp;2005|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 December 2006}}</ref>

On 12 July it was reported that the [[British National Party]] released leaflets showing images of the 'No. 30 bus' after it was destroyed. The slogan, "Maybe now it's time to start listening to the BNP" was printed beside the photo. Home Secretary Charles Clarke described it as an attempt by the BNP to "cynically exploit the current tragic events in London to further their spread of hatred".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4674675.stm|title=Politics BNP campaign uses bus bomb photo|publisher=BBC News|date=12 July 2005|accessdate=17 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026023429/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4674675.stm|archivedate=26 October 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Some media outside the UK complained that successive British governments had been unduly tolerant towards radical [[Islamist]] militants, so long as they were involved in activities outside the UK.<ref name=NYTJuly8>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/international/europe/10qaeda.html?ei=5090&en=03dee04dd2987f2b&ex=1278648000&partner=rssuserland&pagewanted=all|title=For a Decade, London Thrived as a Busy Crossroads of Terror|first1=Elaine|last1=Sciolino|first2=Don|last2=van Natta, Jr.|work=The New York Times|date=10 July 2005|accessdate=8 July 2008}}</ref> Britain's alleged reluctance to extradite or prosecute terrorist suspects resulted in London being dubbed ''[[Londonistan]]'' by the columnist [[Melanie Phillips]].<ref>Philips, Melanie.

===Claims of responsibility===
Even before the identity of the bombers became known, former Metropolitan Police commissioner [[John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington|Lord Stevens]] said he believed they were almost certainly born or based in Britain, and would not "fit the caricature al-Qaeda fanatic from some backward village in Algeria or Afghanistan".<ref>{{cite news|title=Police appeal for bombing footage|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4668675.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=10 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123232831/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4668675.stm|archivedate=23 November 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref> The attacks would have required extensive preparation and prior reconnaissance efforts, and a familiarity with bomb-making and the London transport network as well as access to significant amounts of bomb-making equipment and chemicals.

Some newspaper editorials in Iran blamed the bombing on British or American authorities seeking to further justify the [[War on Terror]], and claimed that the plan that included the bombings also involved increasing harassment of [[Islam in Europe|Muslims in Europe]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Iran press blames West for blasts|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4672037.stm |publisher=BBC News| date=11 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006|first=Frances|last=Harrison|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120083318/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4672037.stm| archivedate=20 November 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On 13 August 2005, quoting police and [[MI5]] sources, ''The Independent'' reported that the bombers acted independently of an al-Qaeda terror mastermind some place abroad.<ref>{{cite news|title=London bombings: the truth emerges|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/london-bombings-the-truth-emerges-502660.html|first=Jason|last=Bennetto|author2=Ian Herbert|work=The Independent|date=13 August 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006}}</ref>

On 1 September it was reported that al-Qaeda officially claimed responsibility for the attacks in a videotape broadcast by the Arab television network Al Jazeera. However, an official inquiry by the British government reported that the tape claiming responsibility had been edited after the attacks, and that the bombers did not have direct assistance from al-Qaeda.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/apr/09/july7.uksecurity |title=Leak reveals official story of London bombings UK news The Observer|work=Guardian|date=9 April 2006|accessdate=17 October 2009|first=Mark|last=Townsend}}</ref> Zabi uk-Taifi, an al-Qaeda commander arrested in Pakistan in January 2009, may have had connections to the bombings, according to Pakistani intelligence sources.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/4313740/Al-Qaeda-commander-linked-to-2005-London-bombings-led-attacks-on-Nato-convoys.html|title=Al-Qaeda commander linked to 2005 London bombings led attacks on Nato convoys|work=The Telegraph|date=22 January 2009|accessdate=5 February 2009|first1=Dean|last1=Nelson|first2=Emal|last2=Khan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130034450/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/4313740/Al-Qaeda-commander-linked-to-2005-London-bombings-led-attacks-on-Nato-convoys.html|archivedate=30 January 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> More recently, documents found by German authorities on a terrorist suspect arrested in Berlin in May 2011 have suggested that [[Rashid Rauf]], a British al Qaeda operative, played a key role in planning the attacks.<ref>Robertson, Nic Cruickshank, Paul and Lister, Tim (30 April 2012) [http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/30/world/al-qaeda-documents-london-bombings/?c=&page=0 "Documents give new details on al Qaeda's London bombings"] CNN.com</ref>

====Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades====
A second claim of responsibility was posted on the Internet by another al-Qaeda-linked group, [[Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades]]. The group had, however, previously falsely claimed responsibility for events that were the result of technical problems, such as the [[2003 London blackout]] and the US [[Northeast blackout of 2003]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Tube blasts 'almost simultaneous'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/09/july7.uksecurity12|first=Chris|last=Johnston|work=The Guardian|date=9 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006|location=London}}</ref>

===Conspiracy theories===
[[File:Russell square police road.JPG|thumb|right|Police cordon off [[Russell Square]] on 7 July 2005.]]
A survey of 500 British Muslims undertaken by [[Channel 4 News]] in 2007 found that 24% believed the four bombers blamed for the attacks did not perform them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/religion/survey+government+hasnt+told+truth+about+77/545847|title=Survey: 'government hasn't told truth about 7/7'|last=Soni|first=Darshna|date=4 June 2007|publisher=Channel 4 News|accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref>

There have been various [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] proposed about the bombings, including the suggestion that the bombers were '[[wikt:patsy|patsies]]', based on claims about timings of the trains and the train from Luton, supposed explosions underneath the carriages, and allegations of the faking of the one time-stamped and dated photograph of the bombers at Luton station.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jun/27/july7.uksecurity|title=Seeing isn't believing|last=Honingsbaum|first=Mark|date=27 June 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/law_order/77+the+conspiracy+theories/545762|title=7/7: the conspiracy theories|last=Soni|first=Darshna|date=4 June 2007|work=Channel 4 News|accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref> Claims made by one theorist in the Internet video ''[[7/7 Ripple Effect]]'' were examined by the BBC documentary series ''[[The Conspiracy Files]]'', in an episode titled "7/7" first broadcast on 30 June 2009, which debunked many of the video's claims.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8124687.stm|title=Unmasking the mysterious 7/7 conspiracy theorist|date=30 June 2009|work=BBC News Magazine|accessdate=12 August 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706155726/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8124687.stm|archivedate=6 July 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On the day of the bombings [[Peter Power (crisis management specialist)|Peter Power]] of Visor Consultants gave interviews on BBC Radio 5 Live and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] saying that he was working on a crisis management simulation drill, in the [[City of London]], "based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations where it happened this morning", when he heard that an attack was going on in real life. He described this as a coincidence. He also gave an interview to the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' where he spoke of "an exercise involving mock broadcasts when it happened for real".<ref>Manchester Evening News "King's Cross Man's Crisis Course", 8 July 2005</ref> After a few days he dismissed it as a "spooky coincidence" on Canadian TV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/uk/coincidence+of+bomb+exercises/109010 |title=BBC4 ''Coincidence of bomb exercises?'' 17 July 2005 |accessdate=14 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514120704/http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/uk/coincidence%2Bof%2Bbomb%2Bexercises/109010 |archivedate=14 May 2007  }}</ref>

Initially, there was much confused information from police sources as to the origin, method, and even timings of the explosions. Forensic examiners had thought initially that military-grade [[plastic explosives]] were used, and, as the blasts were thought to have been simultaneous, that synchronised timed detonators were employed. This hypothesis changed as more information became available. Home-made organic peroxide-based devices were used, according to a May 2006 report from the British government's [[Intelligence and Security Committee]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/11_05_06_isc_london_attacks_report.pdf|title=Report into the London Terrorist Attacks on 7&nbsp;July 2005|author=Intelligence and Security Committee|date=May 2006|page=11|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> The explosive was [[acetone peroxide|triacetone triperoxide]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7682-explosives-linked-to-london-bombings-identified/|title=Explosives linked to London bombings identified|last=Vince|first=Gaia|date=15 July 2005|website=New Scientist|language=en-US}}</ref>

56 people, including the four suicide bombers, were killed by the attacks<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4668245.stm|title=List of the bomb blast victims|accessdate=7 July 2007|date=20 July 2005|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> and about 700 were injured, of whom about 100 were hospitalised for at least one night. The incident was the deadliest single act of terrorism in the United Kingdom since the 1988 bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]], which crashed on Lockerbie and killed 270 people, and the deadliest bombing in London since the Second World War.<ref>{{cite web|title=London Bomb Rescuers Were Hindered by Communications|author=Brian Lysaght and Alex Morales|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aZjIrmdLQ9zo&refer=europe|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=5 June 2006|accessdate =5 August 2012}}</ref>

Police examined about 2,500 items of CCTV footage and [[forensic evidence]] from the scenes of the attacks. The bombs were probably placed on the floors of the trains and bus. Investigators identified four men whom they alleged had been the suicide bombers. This made the bombings the first ever suicide attack in the British Isles.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Eggen|author2=Scott Wilson|title=Suicide Bombs Potent Tools of Terrorists|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/16/AR2005071601363.html|work=The Washington Post|date=17 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006}}</ref>

[[Vincent Cannistraro]], former head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s anti-terrorism centre, told ''The Guardian'' that "two unexploded bombs" were recovered as well as "mechanical timing devices"; this claim was explicitly rejected by London's Metropolitan Police Service.<ref>{{cite news|first=Hugh |last=Muir |author2=Rosie Cowan |title=Four bombs in 50 minutes – Britain suffers its worst-ever terror attack |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1523819,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217222740/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0%2C%2C1523819%2C00.html |archivedate=17 December 2007 |work=The Guardian |date=8 July 2005 |accessdate=3 December 2006 |location=London |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Police raids===
[[West Yorkshire Police]] raided six properties in the Leeds area on 12 July: two houses in Beeston, two in [[Thornhill, West Yorkshire|Thornhill]], one in [[Holbeck]] and one in Alexandra Grove in [[Hyde Park, Leeds]]. One man was arrested. Officers also raided a residential property on Northern Road in the Buckinghamshire town of [[Aylesbury]] on 13 July.

The police service say a significant amount of explosive material was found in the Leeds raids and a [[controlled explosion]] was carried out at one of the properties. Explosives were also found in the vehicle associated with one of the bombers, Shehzad Tanweer, at Luton railway station and subjected to controlled explosion.<ref name="campbell-laville"/><ref>{{cite news|title=London bombers 'were all British'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4676577.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=12 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=One London bomber died in blast|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4674463.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=12 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216200353/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4674463.stm|archivedate=16 December 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The suicide bomb plot hatched in Yorkshire|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-suicide-bomb-plot-hatched-in-yorkshire-498616.html|first=Jason|last=Bennetto|author2=Ian Herbert|work=The Independent|date=13 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006|location=London}}</ref>

===Luton cell===
There was speculation about a possible association between the bombers and another alleged Islamist cell in [[Luton]] which was ended during August 2004. The Luton group was uncovered after [[Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan]] was arrested in [[Lahore]], Pakistan. His laptop computer was said to contain plans for tube attacks in London, as well as attacks on financial buildings in New York City and Washington, D.C. The group was subject to surveillance but on 2 August 2004  ''[[The New York Times]]'' published Khan's name, citing Pakistani sources. The news leak forced police in Britain and Canada to make arrests before their investigations were complete. The US government later said they had given the name to some journalists as "[[Journalism sourcing|background information]]", for which [[Tom Ridge]], the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security]], apologised.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

When the Luton cell was ended, one of the London bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan (no known relation), was scrutinised briefly by MI5 who determined that he was not a likely threat and he was not surveilled.<ref>{{cite news|title=MI5 judged bomber 'no threat'|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1697562,00.html|work=The Times|first=David|last=Leppard|date=17 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006|location=London}}</ref>

===March 2007 arrests===
On 22 March 2007, three men were arrested in connection with the bombings. Two were arrested at 1&nbsp;pm at [[Manchester Airport]], attempting to board a flight bound for Pakistan that afternoon. They were apprehended by undercover officers who had been following the men as part of a surveillance operation. They had not intended to arrest the men that day, but believed they could not risk letting the suspects leave the country. A third man was arrested in the Beeston area of Leeds at an address on the street where one of the suicide bombers had lived before the attacks.<ref>{{cite news|title=Three held over 7&nbsp;July&nbsp;bombings|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6481495.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=22 March 2007|accessdate=1 January 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111135603/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6481495.stm|archivedate=11 January 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===May 2007 arrests===
On 9 May 2007 police made four further arrests, three in [[Yorkshire]] and one in [[Selly Oak]], Birmingham. The widow of the presumed ringleader Mohammed Sidique Khan, was among those arrested for "commissioning, preparing or instigating acts of terrorism".<ref name="ringleader">{{cite news|title=Police quiz 7&nbsp;July&nbsp;bomber's widow|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6637917.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=9 May 2007|accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref>

Three of those arrested, including Khan's widow, were released on 15 May.<ref name="ringleader"/> The fourth, Khalid Khaliq, an unemployed single father of three, was charged on 17 July 2007 with possessing an al-Qaeda training manual, but the charge was not related to the 2005 London attacks. Conviction for possession of a document containing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism carried a maximum ten-year jail sentence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6675165.stm|title=UK Man bailed over 'al-Qaeda manual'|publisher=BBC News|date=21 May 2007|accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref>

===Deportation of Abdullah el-Faisal===
[[Abdullah el-Faisal]] was deported to Jamaica, his country of origin, from Britain on 25 May 2006 after reaching the parole date in his prison sentence. He was found guilty of three charges of soliciting the murder of Jews, Americans and Hindus and two charges of using threatening words to incite racial hatred in 2003 and, despite an appeal, was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. In 2006 [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]] alleged to MPs that el-Faisal had influenced Jamaican-born Briton Germaine Lindsay into participating in the 7/7 bombings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6691701.stm|title=UK Race hate cleric Faisal deported|publisher=BBC News|date=25 May 2007|accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/3494905.stm|title=England London , 'Hate preacher' loses his appeal|publisher=BBC News|date=17 February 2004|accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref>

===Investigation of Mohammad Sidique Khan===
''The Guardian'' reported on 3 May 2007 that police had investigated Mohammad Sidique Khan twice during 2005. The newspaper said it "learned that on 27 January 2005, police took a statement from the manager of a garage in Leeds which had loaned Khan a courtesy car while his vehicle was being repaired." It also said that "on the afternoon of 3 February an officer from [[Scotland Yard]]'s anti-terrorism branch carried out inquiries with the company which had insured a car in which Khan was seen driving almost a year earlier". Nothing about these inquiries appeared in the report by Parliament's intelligence and security committee after it investigated the 7 July attacks. Scotland Yard described the 2005 inquiries as "routine", while security sources said they were related to the fertiliser bomb plot.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Reports of warnings===
While no warnings before 7 July bombings have been documented officially or acknowledged, the following are sometimes quoted as indications either of the events to come or of some foreknowledge.
* One of the London bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan, was briefly scrutinised by MI5 who determined that he was not a likely threat and he was not put under surveillance.<ref name=NOTHREAT>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1697562,00.html MI5 judged bomber "no threat"] ''The Times''</ref>
* Some news stories, current a few hours after the attacks, questioned the British government's contention that there had not been any warning or prior intelligence. It was reported by [[CBS News]] that a senior Israeli official said that British police told the [[Embassy of Israel, London|Israeli embassy in London]] minutes before the explosions that they had received warnings of possible terror attacks in the UK capital. An AP report used by a number of news sites, including ''[[The Guardian]]'', attributed the initial report of a warning to an Israeli "Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity", but added Foreign Minister [[Silvan Shalom]]'s later denial on [[Israel Defense Forces Radio]]: "There was no early information about terrorist attacks." A similar report on the site of right-wing Israeli paper ''Israel National News/Arutz Sheva'' attributed the story to "Army Radio quoting unconfirmed reliable sources."<ref name=REPORT>[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/85346 Report: Israel was warned ahead of first blast] Arutz Sheva – {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050721080055/http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=85346 |date=21 July 2005 }}</ref> Although the report has been retracted, the original stories are still circulated as a result of their presence on the news websites' archives.
* In an interview with the Portuguese newspaper ''[[Público (Portugal)|Público]]'' a month after the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], Syrian-born cleric [[Omar Bakri Muhammad]] warned that "a very well-organised" London-based group which he called "al-Qaeda Europe" was "on the verge of launching a big operation."<ref name=BAKRI>{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=43819&version=1&template_id=57&parent_id=56 |title=Islamic leader had warned of attack |work=Gulf Times |accessdate=17 October 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090903203004/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=43819&version=1&template_id=57&parent_id=56| archivedate= 3 September 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref> In December 2004, Bakri vowed that, if Western governments did not change their policies, Muslims would give them "a 9/11, day after day after day."<ref name=NYTJuly8/>
* According to a 17 November 2004 post on the ''[[Newsweek]]'' website, US authorities in 2004 had evidence that terrorists were planning a possible attack in London. In addition, the article stated that, "fears of terror attacks have prompted FBI agents based in the [[Embassy of the United States, London|U.S. embassy in London]] to avoid travelling on London's popular underground railway (or tube) system."<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/38176 Terror Watch: The Real Target? – Newsweek National News – MSNBC.com] at www.msnbc.msn.com – {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041118164900/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6514619/site/newsweek/ |date=18 November 2004 }}</ref>
* In an interview published by the German magazine ''[[Bild|Bild am Sonntag]]'' dated 10 July 2005, [[Meir Dagan]], director of the Israeli intelligence agency [[Mossad]], said that the agency's office in London was alerted to the impending attack at 8:43&nbsp;am, six minutes before the first bomb detonated. The warning of a possible attack was a result of an investigation into an earlier terrorist bombing in [[Tel Aviv]], which may have been related to the London bombings.<ref>at web.israelinsider.com</ref>

===Anwar al-Awlaki===
''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that radical imam [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] had inspired the bombers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6630555/Fort-Hood-shooting-radical-Islamic-preacher-also-inspired-July-7-bombers.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Fort Hood shooting: radical Islamic preacher also inspired July&nbsp;7 bombers|first1=Philip|last1=Sherwell|first2=Duncan|last2=Gardham|date=23 November 2009}}</ref> The bombers transcribed lectures of al-Awlaki while plotting the bombings. His materials were found in the possession of accused accomplices of the suicide bombers. Al-Awlaki was killed by a US drone attack in 2011.

===Independent inquest===
In 2006, the government refused to hold a public inquiry, stating that "it would be a ludicrous diversion". Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] said an independent inquiry would "undermine support" for MI5, while the leader of the opposition, [[David Cameron]], said only a full inquiry would "get to the truth".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/03/july7.topstories3|title=7/7 leader: more evidence reveals what police knew|work=The Guardian|date=3 May 2007|accessdate=17 October 2009|location=London|first1=Helen|last1=Carter|first2=Vikram|last2=Dodd|first3=Ian|last3=Cobain}}</ref> In reaction to revelations about the extent of security service investigations into the bombers prior to the attack, the [[Shadow Home Secretary]], [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], said: "It is becoming more and more clear that the story presented to the public and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is at odds with the facts."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/03/july7.topstories3|title=7/7 leader: more evidence reveals what police knew|first=Vikram|last=Dodd|work=The Guardian|date=3 May 2007|accessdate=20 December 2007|location=London}}</ref> 

The decision to not hold an independent public inquest was later reversed and in October 2010 an independent coroner's inquest of the bombings began.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://7julyinquests.independent.gov.uk/ |title=Coroner's Inquest into the London bombings of 7 July 2005 |publisher=7julyinquests.independent.gov.uk|accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> [[Heather Hallett|Lady Justice Hallett]] was appointed to hear the inquest, which would consider how each victim died and whether MI5, if it had worked better, could have prevented the attack, and also the emergency service response.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11511461|title=7/7 bombs acts of 'merciless savagery', inquests told|publisher=BBC News|date=11 October 2010|accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref>

After seven months of evidence and deliberation, the verdict of the inquiry was released and read in the Houses of Parliament on 9 May 2011. It determined that the 52 victims had been unlawfully killed; their deaths could not have been prevented, and they would probably have died "whatever time the emergency services reached and rescued them". Hallett concluded that MI5 had not made every possible improvement since the attacks but that it was not "right or fair" to say more attention should have been paid to ringleader Mohammad Sidique Khan prior to 7 July. She also decided that there should be no public inquiry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/about-us/parliamentary-business/written-ministerial-statement/77-inquest-wms/|title=7/7 inquest – WMS|publisher=Home Office|date=9 May 2011|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13308371|publisher=BBC News|title=7/7 inquests: Emergency delays 'did not cause deaths'|date=6 May 2011}}</ref>

The report provided nine recommendations to various bodies:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2011/may/06/7-7-inquest-verdict-live-coverage?commentpage=last#block-29|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Paul|last=Owen|title=7/7 inquest verdict – Friday 6&nbsp;May&nbsp;2011|date=6 May 2011}}</ref>
# With reference to a photograph of Khan and Shehzad Tanweer which was so badly cropped by MI5 that the pair was virtually unrecognisable to the US authorities asked to review it, the inquiry recommended that procedures be improved so that humans asked to view photographs are shown them in best possible quality.
# In relation to the suggestion that MI5 failed to realise the suspects were important quickly enough, the inquiry recommended that MI5 improves the way it records decisions relating to suspect assessment.
# The inquiry recommended that 'major incident' training for all frontline staff, especially those working on the Underground, is reviewed.
# With regards to the facts that London Underground (LU) is unable to declare a 'major incident' itself and that LU was not invited to an emergency meeting at Scotland Yard at 10:30&nbsp;am on the morning of the bombings, the inquiry recommends that the way [[Transport for London]] (TfL) and the London [[Urban resilience|resilience]] team are alerted to major incidents and the way the emergency services are informed is reviewed.
# Regarding the confusion on 7 July 2005 over the emergency rendezvous point, it was recommended that a common initial rendezvous point is permanently staffed and advised to emergency services;
# In response to the evidence that some firefighters refused to walk on the tracks at Aldgate to reach the bombed train because they had not received confirmation that the electric current had been switched off, the inquiry recommended a review into how emergency workers confirm whether the current is off after a major incident.
# A recommendation was made that TfL reviewed the provision of stretchers and [[first aid]] equipment at Underground stations.
# Training of London Ambulance Service (LAS) staff of "multi-casualty triage" should be reviewed, following concerns in the inquest that some casualties were not actually treated by paramedics who had triaged them.
# A final recommendation was made to the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], the [[Mayor of London]] and the London resilience team to review the capability and funding of emergency medical care in the city.

===Alleged newspaper phone hacking===
It was reported in July 2011 that relatives of some of the victims of the bombings may have had their telephones accessed by the ''[[News of the World]]'' in the aftermath of the attacks. The revelations added to an existing [[News International phone hacking scandal|controversy over phone hacking]] by the tabloid newspaper.

The fathers of two victims, one in the Edgware Road blast and another at Russell Square, told the BBC that police officers investigating the alleged hacking had warned them that their contact details were found on a target list, while a former firefighter who helped injured passengers escape from Edgware Road also said he had been contacted by police who were looking into the hacking allegations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14040841|publisher=BBC News|title=News of the World 'hacked 7/7 family phones'|date=6 July 2011}}</ref> A number of survivors from the bombed trains also revealed that police had warned them their phones may have been accessed and their messages intercepted, and in some cases officers advised them to change security codes and [[Personal identification number|PINs]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hutchinson |first=Lisa |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle-news/2011/07/07/tyneside-7-7-bombings-survivor-lisa-french-has-been-contacted-by-detectives-investigating-news-of-the-world-phone-hacking-scandal-72703-29009171/ |title=Tyneside 7/7 bombings survivor Lisa French has been contacted by detectives investigating News of the World phone hacking scandal. |publisher=ChronicleLive |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate=16 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201141110/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle-news/2011/07/07/tyneside-7-7-bombings-survivor-lisa-french-has-been-contacted-by-detectives-investigating-news-of-the-world-phone-hacking-scandal-72703-29009171/ |archivedate=1 February 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/london_bombing_survivor_threatens_to_sue_over_hacking_1_956554|title=London bombing survivor threatens to sue over hacking|work=Kent News|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=16 September 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812034940/http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/london_bombing_survivor_threatens_to_sue_over_hacking_1_956554|archivedate=12 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Susan Ryan|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/warnings-of-potential-irish-victims-of-notw-phone-hacking-172128-Jul2011/|title=Warnings of potential Irish victims of NOTW phone hacking|publisher=Thejournal.ie|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>

Since the bombings, the United Kingdom and other nations have honoured the victims in several ways. Most of these memorials have included moments of silence, candlelit vigils, and the laying of flowers at the attack sites. Foreign leaders have also remembered the dead by ordering their flags to be flown at [[half-mast]], signing books of condolences at embassies of the UK, and issuing messages of support and condolences to the British people.
