== History ==
===Founding===
The idea of creating a taxi-booking mobile app for Southeast Asia, similar to those being pioneered in the US, first came from Anthony Tan ({{lang|zh-hans|陈炳耀}}, ''Chen Bingyao'')<ref>凤凰网：彭博2017全球50大最具影响力人物：刘炽平、孙正义上榜  </ref> while he was at [[Harvard Business School]]. Motivated to make taxi rides safer in Malaysia, Tan launched the "My Teksi" app in Malaysia in 2012 together with [[Tan Hooi Ling]], another Harvard graduate. MyTeksi was started with an initial grant of US$25,000 from Harvard Business School and Anthony Tan's personal capital.<ref name= "Anthony HBS">{{cite web|title=Anthony Tan – MBA 2011|url=https://entrepreneurship.hbs.edu/founders/Pages/profile.aspx?num=195|publisher=Havard Business School|access-date=11 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111220026/https://entrepreneurship.hbs.edu/founders/Pages/profile.aspx?num=195|archive-date=11 January 2018}}</ref><ref name="e27 Anthony Tan">{{cite web|url=http://e27.co/first-venture-11-says-anthony-tan-traded-comics/|title=My first venture was at 11, says Anthony Tan, who traded comics then|last=Kumar|first=Dhaleta Surender|publisher=e27|date=11 February 2014|access-date=20 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Bloomberg 2014"/><ref name="StraitsTimes2014">{{cite web|last=Cheong|first=Kash|url=http://www.straitstimes.com:80/digital-life/more-digital-life-stories/story/grabtaxi-currently-the-most-prominent-third-party-taxi-|title=GrabTaxi: Currently the most prominent third-party taxi app in the region|publisher=The Straits Times|date=30 April 2014|access-date=17 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208052128/http://www.straitstimes.com/digital-life/more-digital-life-stories/story/grabtaxi-currently-the-most-prominent-third-party-taxi-|archive-date=8 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2014, Grab moved its company headquarters from Malaysia to Singapore.<ref name="Susan March2018" />

In February 2020, Grab launched GrabCare for healthcare workers in Singapore, starting with 24-hour services to [[Tan Tock Seng Hospital]] and [[National Centre for Infectious Diseases]]. This came after reports of increased discrimination due to the [[COVID-19]] situation, making it difficult for healthcare workers to get rides. The service will eventually be expanded to other Singapore hospitals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Grab to pilot service offering round-the-clock rides home for healthcare professionals |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/grabcare-wuhan-virus-coronavirus-covid-19-pilot-grab-12427022 |website=CNA |access-date=16 February 2020 |date=12 February 2020}}</ref> Grab also expanded its GrabMart (daily essentials delivery) and GrabAssistant (on-demand concierge) services to more cities and countries to meet increased demand for online food and grocery deliveries.

In the Philippines, GrabCar was fully legalised after being accredited as a Transportation Network Company (TNC) by the [[Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (Philippines)|Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board]] (LTFRB) in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/startups/grabcar-fully-legalised-as-a-transport-company-in-the-philippines|title=GrabCar fully legalised as a transport company in the Philippines|publisher=Digital News Asia|date=7 July 2015|access-date=8 July 2015}}</ref> The following year, Malaysia approved plans that legitimised Grab and Uber services, as well as to transform their taxi industry. On 4 April 2017, the [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian government]] tabled amendments to existing transport laws that would regulate transport application services and protect drivers from harassment. Through the amendment, Grab and Uber vehicles were classified as public service vehicles as part of the move to legalise both services in its efforts to transform the country's public transport services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/uber-grab-rides-could-be-legalised-soon-malaysia|title=Bills to legalise Grab, Uber tabled in Malaysian Parliament|publisher=Today Online|date=4 April 2017|access-date=5 April 2017}}</ref> The amendments were passed by the [[Parliament of Malaysia]] on 28 July 2017, which directly legalised both services to operate in the country.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lim|first=Shawn|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/07/28/malaysias-parliament-passes-laws-legalise-uber-and-grab|title=Malaysia's parliament passes laws to legalise Uber and Grab|publisher=The Drum|date=28 July 2017|access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref> In Singapore, similar laws that legalised the service were passed in February 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-s-uber-grab-drivers-now-need-to-be-licensed-7621922|title=Singapore's Uber, Grab drivers now need to be licensed|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=7 February 2017|access-date=7 February 2017}}</ref> Since its foundation, GrabTaxi received majority votes in an online poll conducted by Singapore's ''Straits Times'' as the taxi app of choice.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kok|first=Lee Min|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/grabtaxi-comfortdelgro-flagged-as-most-popular-straits-times-online-poll|title=GrabTaxi, ComfortDelgro flagged as most popular: Straits Times online poll|publisher=The Straits Times|date=17 December 2014|access-date=20 March 2015}}</ref>

== Regulation ==
Recent regulatory issues have arisen for third-party booking apps like GrabTaxi, but there seems to have been few issues surrounding the company in the 6 markets that they are in. The tech company has also received the support of the Malaysian Public Land Transport Commission (SPAD) when the government department introduced the use of technology using the GrabTaxi applications to enhance efficiency of taxi drivers in Malaysia. The company is working with the government department to improve the image of taxi drivers in the city.<ref>{{cite web|last=Darlyne Chow|first=Melissa|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/2015/09/myteksi-app-drive-penang-tourism|title=MyTeksi app to drive Penang tourism|publisher=New Straits Times|date=14 September 2014|access-date=20 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Carvalho|first=Martin|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/10/21/MyTeksi-calls-for-level-playing-field-to-compete-with-Uber/|title=Myteksi calls for 'level playing field' to compete with Uber|publisher=The Star (Malaysia)|date=21 October 2014|access-date=20 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2012/12/12/spad-introduces-myteksi-taximonger-apps-to-enhance-efficiency-of-cabbies-of-cabbies/|title=SPAD introduces MyTeksi, TaxiMonger apps to enhance efficiency of cabbies of cabbies|work=Bernama|publisher=The Borneo Post|date=12 December 2012|access-date=20 March 2015}}</ref>

In the Philippines, GrabBike has temporarily stopped operations following LTFRB order. LTFRB and GrabBike Inc. met to discuss the transport agency's warning for the motorcycle taxi service to stop its operations as it is not included in Grab's, or any other transportation Network Company's (TNC), accreditation to offer bikes as a public mode of transportation that can be booked through a digital platform. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) has yet to create guidelines regarding the use of bikes and motorcycles as a public mode of transportation, until then, GrabBike will not be able to operate. TNC's non-compliance with the directive "shall be dealt with severely", said LTFRB.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tan|first=Lara|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/02/05/GrabBike-temporarily-stops-operations-LTFRB-DOTC.html|title=GrabBike temporarily stops operations following LTFRB order|publisher=CNN Philippines|date=5 February 2016|access-date=6 February 2016}}</ref>

In May 2016, the Directorate for Roads of Vietnam (DRVN) suggested that both Grab and Uber taxis should have signs on their cars to differentiate them from conventional taxis, a suggestion that sparked a wave of protest from many local taxi companies. Most taxi operators claimed the change would amount to legal recognition of the services as local taxis face many constraints from the government such as limitations on the number of vehicles, bans on using several streets, paying more tax and higher operation costs while both Grab and Uber were excluded from such requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/economy/296503/uber-and-grabtaxi-to-be-recognised.html|title=Uber and GrabTaxi to be recognised|publisher=Việt Nam News|date=10 May 2016|access-date=11 May 2016}}</ref> In response, the Vietnamese [[Ministry of Transport (Vietnam)|Ministry of Transport]] set to review the legal status of both Grab and Uber to ensure a fair business environment for firms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.qdnd.vn/economy/news/vietnam-to-review-uber-grab-legal-status-488150|title=Vietnam to review Uber, Grab legal status|work=Vietnam News Agency|publisher=People's Army Website|date=25 December 2017|access-date=26 December 2017}}</ref> A draft of a new circular was submitted in early 2018 that includes regulations for passenger transport (by car) through software which directly focusing on those applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/business/193432/uber--grab-under-tighter-supervision.html|title=Uber, Grab under tighter supervision|work=Vietnam News Agency|publisher=Vietnam Net|date=8 January 2018|access-date=9 January 2018}}</ref>

In February 2017, [[Land Transport Authority]] (LTA) in Singapore ruled that private hire cars who used Uber or Grab service are not exempted from child seat requirement. For safety reasons, all vehicles in Singapore must have booster seats or child restraints for passengers under 1.35m in height.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yew Chin|first=Leow|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=3&id=bcfb0de5-1ea0-49bc-bcc2-2d5639044174|title=Private Hire Cars Not Exempt from Child Seat Requirement|publisher=Land Transport Authority (Singapore)|date=10 February 2017|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref>

Since 1 July 2017, the LTA has required GrabCar, JustGrab and GrabHitch to have Private Hire Vehicle's Vocational Licence (PDVL). This follows after LTA introduced a new regulation for private hire cars called Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence (PDVL) which took effect in July 2017.<ref name="applications"/> This is to ensure that commuter's interest is better protected in particular safety.<ref name="new regulations"/>
