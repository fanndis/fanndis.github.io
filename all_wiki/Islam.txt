Islam was historically itself called [[Mohammedan|''Mohammedanism'']] in the [[English-speaking world]]. This term has fallen out of use and is sometimes said to be [[Religious offense|offensive]], as it suggests that a human being, rather than God, is central to Muslims' religion, parallel to [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in [[Buddhism]].<ref>Wilson, Kenneth G. ''The Columbia Guide to Standard American English''. {{ISBN|0231069898}}. p. 291: "Muhammadan and Mohammedan are based on the name of the prophet Mohammed, and both are considered offensive."</ref> Some authors, however, continue to use the term ''Mohammedanism'' as a [[wiktionary:technical term|technical term]] for the religious system as opposed to the [[Theology|theological]] concept of Islam that exists within that system.

=== Usage of ''Islamic'' ===
According to ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'', the word ''Islamic'' denotes belonging or relating to Islam.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Islamic definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/islamic|access-date=2020-10-21|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en}}</ref> According to [[Michael Muhammad Knight|M.M. Knight]], he would not prefer to assume any distinction between "Islam as 'a lived tradition' on the ground and Islam as 'an abstracted ideal' that floats above human cultures".  According to Knight, If there would not exist any chance to access  "Islam", apart from what human beings do with it, then an idea or practice becomes "Islamic" by people identifying it as such, or else the term ''Islamic'' imposes an unrequired claim of normativity, and hence when one does not speak for real Islam it is preferable to use the term ''[[Muslims|Muslim]]'' instead of the term ''Islamic''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Knight|first=Michael Muhammad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ih13CgAAQBAJ&q=Magic+In+Islam|title=Magic In Islam|date=2016-05-24|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-101-98349-2|pages=24|language=en}}</ref>

==Articles of faith==
{{Main|Aqidah|Iman (Islam)|l2 = Iman}}
[[Faith]] ([[Iman (Islam)|''iman'']]) in the Islamic [[creed]] ([[aqidah|''aqidah'']]) is often represented as the [[Iman (concept)#The six articles of the Islamic faith|six articles of faith]], notably mentioned in the [[Hadith of Gabriel]]. Belief in these articles is necessary and obligatory upon all Muslims.

===Angels===

Belief in [[angel]]s is fundamental to Islam. The Quranic word for angel ({{lang-ar|ملك}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|malak}}'') derives either from ''Malaka'', meaning "he controlled", due to their power to govern different affairs assigned to them,<ref>Ali, Syed Anwer. [1984] 2010. ''Qurʼan, the Fundamental Law of Human Life: Surat ul-Faateha to Surat-ul-Baqarah (sections 1–21).'' Syed Publications. p. 121.</ref> or from the root ''’-l-k'', ''l-’-k'' or ''m-l-k'' with the broad meaning of a 'messenger', just as its counterpart in [[Hebrew]] (''malʾákh''). Unlike the Hebrew word, however, the term is exclusively used for heavenly spirits of the divine world, as opposed to human messengers. The Quran refers to both angelic and human messengers as ''rasul'' instead.<ref>Burge, Stephan R. 2011. ''"''The Angels in Sūrat al-Malāʾika: Exegeses of Q. 35:1." ''[[Journal of Qur'anic Studies]]'' 10(1):50–70.</ref>

The Quran is the principal source for the Islamic concept of angels.<ref name=":6">Burge, Stephen. 2015. ''Angels in Islam: Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti's al-Haba'ik fi akhbar al-mala'ik''.

[[File:Medieval Persian manuscript Muhammad leads Abraham Moses Jesus.jpg|thumb|A Persian miniature depicts [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] leading [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]], [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] and other prophets in prayer.]]

Muslims identify the 'prophets' ([[Arabic]]: {{lang-ar|أنبياء|label=none|translit=anbiyāʾ}}) as those humans chosen by God at different times in the past, to convey his messages (warnings and glad tidings), teachings (way of personal life) and legislation (public life) to people while being in contact with God mostly through revelation.<ref group="lower-roman">{{Cite Quran|4|164|expand=yes|style=nosup}}; {{Cite Quran|16|36|expand=yes|style=nosup}}; {{Cite Quran|66|1|expand=yes|style=nosup}}</ref> According to the Quran, the prophets were instructed by God to bring the "will of God" to the peoples of the nations. Muslims believe that prophets are human and not divine, though some are able to perform miracles to prove their claim. [[Schools of Islamic theology|Islamic theology]] says that all of God's messengers preached the message of Islam—submission to the will of God. The Quran mentions the names of numerous figures considered [[prophets in Islam]], including [[Adam in Islam|Adam]], [[Noah in Islam|Noah]], [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]], [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], among others.<ref name=":5" />

Muslims believe that God finally sent Muhammad as the last law-bearing prophet (''[[Seal of the prophets]]'') to convey the divine message to the whole world (to sum up and to finalize the word of God). In Islam, the "normative" example of Muhammad's life is called the ''[[sunnah]]'' (literally 'trodden path'). Muslims are encouraged to emulate Muhammad's actions in their daily lives and the sunnah is seen as crucial to guiding interpretation of the Quran.<ref>* ''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World'' (2003), p. 666* {{Cite encyclopedia|title=Hadith|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online|author=J.

[[Hadith qudsi|Hadith Qudsi]] is a sub-category of hadith, regarded as verbatim words of God quoted by Muhammad that are not part of the Quran. A hadith involves two elements: a chain of narrators, called [[Hadith studies#Traditional importance of the sanad|''sanad'']], and the actual wording, called ''[[Hadith studies|matn]]''. Hadiths can be classified, by studying the narration as: 'authentic' or 'correct' ({{lang-ar|صَحِيْح|links=no|translit=[[Hadith terminology#Ṣaḥīḥ|ṣaḥīḥ]]|label=none}}); 'good', ''[[Hasan (hadith)|hasan]]'' ({{lang-ar|حَسَن|links=no|label=none|translit=[[Hadith terminology#Ḥasan|ḥasan]]}}); or 'weak' ({{lang-ar|ضَعِيْف|label=none|translit=[[Hadith terminology#Ḍaʻīf|ḍaʻīf]]}}), among others.

===Resurrection and judgment===
{{Main|Islamic eschatology}}

Belief in the "Day of Resurrection" or ''[[Qiyamah|Yawm al-Qiyāmah]]'' ({{lang-ar|يوم القيامة}}), is also crucial for Muslims. It is believed that the time of ''Qiyāmah'' is preordained by God but unknown to man. The trials and [[Great Tribulation|tribulations]] preceding and during the ''Qiyāmah'' are described in the Quran and the hadith, as well as in the commentaries of [[Ulama|scholars]]. The Quran emphasizes [[Resurrection of the dead|bodily resurrection]], a break from the [[pre-Islamic Arabia]]n understanding of death.<ref>* Glassé, Cyril. 2003. "Resurrection."

On Yawm al-Qiyāmah, Muslims believe all humankind will be judged by their good and bad deeds and consigned to ''[[Jannah]]'' (paradise) or ''[[Jahannam]]'' (hell). The Qurʼan in Surat al-Zalzalah describes this as: "So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it. And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it." The Qurʼan [[Islamic views of sin|lists several sins]] that can condemn a person to [[hell]], such as [[Kafir|disbelief]] in God ({{lang-ar|كفر|translit=kufr|label=none}}), and dishonesty. However, the Qurʼan makes it clear that God will forgive the [[Islamic views on sin|sins]] of those who repent if he so wills. Good deeds, such as charity, prayer, and compassion towards animals,<ref>Masri, Basheer Ahmad. ''Animals in Islam.'' p. 27.</ref><ref>Esposito, John L. 2011.

The five daily ritual prayers are called [[Salah|''ṣalāh'']] or ''ṣalāt'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: [[Wikt:صلاة|صلاة]]). Salat is intended to focus the mind on God, and is seen as a personal communication with him that expresses gratitude and [[worship]]. Performing prayers five times a day is compulsory but flexibility in the timing specifics is allowed depending on circumstances. The prayers are recited in the [[Arabic language]], and consist of verses from the Quran.<ref>*{{Harvtxt|Esposito|2002b|pp=18, 19}}

{{see also|Fasting in Islam}}
Fasting ([[Arabic]]: {{lang-ar|صوم‎|translit=ṣawm|label=none}}) from food and drink, among other things, must be performed from dawn to after sunset during the month of [[Ramadan]]. The fast is to encourage a feeling of nearness to God, and during it Muslims should express their gratitude for and dependence on him, atone for their past sins, develop self-control and restraint and think of the needy. ''Sawm'' is not obligatory for several groups for whom it would constitute an undue burden.

Every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it must make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in his or her lifetime. Rituals of the Hajj include: spending a day and a night in the tents in the desert plain of Mina, then a day in the desert plain of Arafat praying and worshiping God, following the footsteps of Abraham; then spending a night out in the open, sleeping on the desert sand in the desert plain of Muzdalifah; then moving to Jamarat, symbolically [[Stoning of the Devil|stoning the Devil]] recounting Abraham's actions;<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davids|first1=Abu Muneer Ismail|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=4xIijTTxX9UC|page=279}}|title=Getting the Best Out of Hajj By Abu Muneer Ismail Davids|year=2006|isbn=9789960980300|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=F.E.|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=HYJ2c9E9IM8C|page=19}}|title=Islam: A Guide for Jews and Christians|date=2009|isbn=978-1400825486|page=20|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Alhuseini|first=Sayed / Farouq M.|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=kz41FZmUivcC|page=61}}|title=Islam and the Glorious Ka'abah: none|date=2012|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-1-4697-8590-5|pages=61–}}</ref> then going to Mecca and walking seven times around the [[Kaaba]] which Muslims believe was built as a place of worship by Abraham; then walking seven times between [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Mount Safa]] and [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Mount Marwah]] recounting the steps of Abraham's wife, [[Hagar]], while she was looking for water for her son [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]] in the desert before Mecca developed into a settlement.<ref>*{{Harvtxt|Goldschmidt|2005|p=48}}

===Scholars===
[[File:Карло Боссоли. Татарская школа для детей (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|232px|[[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] Muslim students (1856)]]
{{Main|Ulama}}

Islam, like Judaism, has no clergy in the [[sacerdotalism|sacredotal]] sense, such as priests who mediate between God and people. However, there are many terms in Islam to refer to religiously sanctioned positions of Islam. In the broadest sense, the term ''[[Ulama|ulema]]'' ({{lang-ar| علماء}}) is used to describe the body of Muslim scholars who have completed several years of training and study of [[Islamic studies|Islamic sciences]]. A jurist who interprets Islamic law is called a ''[[mufti]]'' ({{lang-ar|مفتي|label=none}}) and often issues legal opinions, called [[fatwa]]s. A scholar of jurisprudence is called a ''[[faqih]]'' ({{lang-ar|فقيه‎|label=none}}). Someone who studies the science of hadith is called a ''[[muhaddith]]''. A [[qadi]] is a judge in an Islamic court. [[Honorific]] titles given to scholars include [[sheikh]], [[mullah]], and [[Mawlawi (Islamic title)|mawlawi]]. [[Imam]] ({{lang-ar|إمام‎|label=none}}) is a leadership position, often used in the context of conducting Islamic worship services.

===Schools of jurisprudence===
[[File:Madhhab Map3.png|thumb|right|257px|Islamic [[madh'hab|schools of law]] in the [[Muslim world]]]]
{{Main|Madhhab}}
A school of jurisprudence is referred to as a ''[[madhhab]]'' ({{lang-ar|مذهب}}). The four major Sunni schools are the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] madhahs while the three major Shia schools are the [[Ja'fari]], [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] and [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] madhahib. Each differ in their methodology, called ''[[Usul al-fiqh]]'' ('principles of jurisprudence'). The following of decisions by a religious expert without necessarily examining the decision's reasoning is called ''[[taqlid]]''. The term ''[[Salafi movement|ghair muqallid]]'' literally refers to those who do not use taqlid and by extension do not have a [[madhab|''madhhab'']].<ref>Bharathi, K. S. 1998. ''Encyclopedeia of Eminent Thinkers''. p. 38.</ref> The practice of an individual interpreting law with independent reasoning is called ''[[ijtihad]]''.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Weiss|2002|pp=3,161}}</ref>

=== Economics ===

To reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, [[Islamic economic jurisprudence]] encourages trade,<ref>*''International Business Success in a Strange Cultural Environment'' By Mamarinta P. Mababaya p. 203

''Financial Regulation in Crisis?: The Role of Law and the Failure of Northern Rock''. p. 97.</ref> Therefore, wealth is taxed through [[Zakat]], but trade is not taxed.

Profit sharing and venture capital where the lender is also exposed to risk is acceptable.<ref>*[[Ibn Majah]], ''[[Sunan ibn Majah]]'' III, hadith 2289

The taking of land belonging to others is also prohibited. The prohibition of [[usury]] and the revival of interest-based economies has resulted in the development of [[Islamic banking]]. During the time of Muhammad, any money that went to the state, was immediately used to help the poor. Then, in AD 634, [[Umar]] formally established the welfare state [[Bayt al-mal|Bayt al-Mal]] ("House of Wealth"), which was for the Muslim and Non-Muslim poor, needy, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. The Bayt al-Maal ran for hundreds of years under the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in the 7th century, continuing through the [[Umayyad]] period, and well into the [[Abbasid]] era. Umar also introduced [[child support]] and [[pension]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Muhammad |last=Al-Buraey|title=Administrative Development: An Islamic Perspective|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=HJE9AAAAIAAJ|page=254}}|year=1985|publisher=KPI|isbn=978-0-7103-0333-2|pages=254–}}</ref><ref>Quddus, Syed Abdul.

[[Sufism]] ([[Arabic]]: {{lang-ar|تصوف|translit=tasawwuf|label=none}}), is a [[mystical]]-[[ascetic]] approach to Islam that seeks to find a direct [[Divine presence|personal experience of God]]. It is not a sect of Islam and its adherents belong to the various Muslim denominations. Classical Sufi scholars defined ''Tasawwuf'' as "a science whose objective is the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God", through "intuitive and emotional faculties" that one must be trained to use.<ref>* {{Harvtxt|Esposito|2003|p=302}}

Religiosity of early Sufi ascetics, such as [[Hasan al-Basri]], emphasized fear to fail God's expectations of obedience, in contrast to later and more prominent Sufis, such as [[Mansur Al-Hallaj]] and [[Jalaluddin Rumi]], whose religiosity is based on love towards God.

Many practices fall in the category of ''adab'', or Islamic etiquette. This includes greeting others with "''[[As-Salamu Alaykum|as-salamu 'alaykum]]''" ('peace be unto you'), saying ''[[Basmala|bismillah]]'' ('in [[Names of God|the name of God]]') before meals, and using only the right hand for eating and drinking. [[Islamic hygienical jurisprudence|Islamic hygienic]] practices mainly fall into the category of personal cleanliness and health. [[Khitan (circumcision)|Circumcision of male offspring]] is also practiced in Islam. [[Islamic funeral|Islamic burial rituals]] include saying the ''[[Salat al-Janazah]]'' ("funeral prayer") over the bathed and enshrouded dead body, and burying it in a [[Grave (burial)|grave]]. Muslims are restricted in their diet. Prohibited foods include pork products, blood, [[carrion]], and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. All meat must come from a [[herbivorous]] animal slaughtered in the name of God by a Muslim, Jew, or Christian, with the exception of game that one has hunted or fished for oneself. Food permissible for Muslims is known as [[halal]] food.<ref>* {{Cite quran|5|5|style=ref}}

During this time, [[Muhammad in Mecca|Muhammad, while in Mecca]], preached to the people, imploring them to abandon [[polytheism]] and to worship one God. Although some converted to Islam, the leading Meccan authorities persecuted Muhammad and his followers. This resulted in the [[Migration to Abyssinia]] of some Muslims (to the [[Aksumite Empire]]). Many early converts to Islam were the poor, foreigners and former slaves like [[Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi]] who was black. The Meccan élite felt that Muhammad was destabilising their social order by preaching about one God and about racial equality, and that in the process he inculcated dangerous ideas into the heads of the poor and of the slaves.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ali |last=Ünal|title=The Qurʼan with Annotated Interpretation in Modern English|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=DyuqdDIjaswC|page=1323}}|year=2006|publisher=Tughra Books|isbn=978-1-59784-000-2|pages=1323–}}</ref><ref>''"''Slaves and Slavery."

After 12 years of the [[persecution of Muslims by the Meccans]] and the [[Meccan boycott of the Hashemites]], Muhammad's relatives, Muhammad and the Muslims performed the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]'' ('emigration')  in AD 622 to the city of ''Yathrib'' (current-day [[Medina]]). There, with the Medinan converts (the ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'') and the Meccan migrants (the ''[[Muhajirun]]''), [[Muhammad in Medina]] established his [[Theocracy|political and religious authority]]. The [[Constitution of Medina]] was formulated, instituting a number of rights and responsibilities for the Muslim, Jewish, Christian and pagan communities of Medina, bringing them within the fold of one community—the [[Ummah]].<ref>Serjeant (1978), p. 4.</ref><ref group="upper-alpha">Watt. ''Muhammad at Medina''. pp. 227–28 Watt argues that the initial agreement came about shortly after the hijra and that the document was amended at a later date—specifically after the battle of Badr (AH [anno hijra] 2, = AD 624). Serjeant argues that the constitution is in fact 8 different treaties which can be dated according to events as they transpired in Medina, with the first treaty written shortly after Muhammad's arrival.

All the tribes signed the agreement to defend Medina from all external threats and to live in harmony amongst themselves. Within a few years, two battles took place against the Meccan forces: first, the [[Battle of Badr]] in 624—a Muslim victory, and then a year later, when the Meccans returned to Medina, the [[Battle of Uhud]], which ended inconclusively.

The Arab tribes in the rest of Arabia then formed a confederation and during the [[Battle of the Trench]] (March–April 627) besieged Medina, intent on finishing off Islam. In 628, the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]] was signed between Mecca and the Muslims and was broken by Mecca two years later. After the signing of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah many more people converted to Islam. At the same time, Meccan trade routes were cut off as Muhammad brought surrounding desert tribes under his control.<ref>*{{Harvtxt|Peters|2003|pp=78–79, 194}}

The earliest three generations of Muslims are known as the [[Salaf]], with the companions of Muhammad being known as the [[Sahaba]]. Many of them, such as the largest narrator of hadith [[Abu Hureyrah]], recorded and compiled what would constitute the [[sunnah]].

When Umar was assassinated by Persians in 644, [[the election of Uthman]] as successor was met with increasing opposition. The standard copies of the Quran were also distributed throughout the Islamic State. In 656, Uthman was also killed, and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|Ali]] assumed the position of caliph. This led to the [[First Fitna|first civil war]] (the "First Fitna") over who should be caliph. Ali was assassinated by [[Kharijites]] in 661. To avoid further fighting, the new caliph [[Hasan ibn Ali]] signed a [[Hasan–Muawiya treaty|peace treaty]], abdicating to [[Muawiyah I|Mu'awiyah]], beginning the [[Umayyad dynasty]], in return that he not name his own successor.<ref>{{harvtxt|Holt|1977a|pp=67–72}}</ref> These disputes over religious and political leadership would give rise to schism in the Muslim community. The majority accepted the legitimacy of the first four leaders and became known as Sunnis. A minority disagreed, and believed that only Ali and some of his descendants should rule; they became known as the Shia.<ref>Waines (2003) p. 46</ref> Mu'awiyah appointed his son, [[Yazid I]], as successor and after Mu'awiyah's death in 680, the "[[Second Fitna]]" broke out, where [[Husayn ibn Ali]] was killed at the [[Battle of Karbala]], a significant event in Shia Islam.

The descendants of Muhammad's uncle [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]] rallied discontented non-Arab converts (''[[mawali]]''), poor Arabs, and some Shi'a against the Umayyads and overthrew them, inaugurating the [[Abbasid|Abbasid dynasty]] in 750.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2002|p=56}}; {{Harvtxt|Lewis|1993|pp=71–83}}</ref>

Two [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] tribes, the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Karahanids]] and the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]], converted to Islam during the 10th century.

=== Modern era (18th – 20th centuries) ===
[[File:Portrait Caliph Abdulmecid II.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abdülmecid II]] was the last Caliph of Islam from the [[Ottoman dynasty]].]]

The Muslim world was generally in political decline starting the 1800s, especially relative to the non-Muslim European powers. This decline was evident culturally; while [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]] founded an observatory in [[Istanbul]] and the Jai Singh Observatory was built in the 18th century, there was not a single Muslim-majority country with a major observatory by the twentieth century.<ref>Ahmed, Imad-ad-Dean.

During the 18th century [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] founded a military movement opposing the [[Ottoman Sultanate]] as an illegitimate rule, advising his fellows to return to the principles of Islam based on the theology of [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]].<ref>Donald Quataert ''The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922'' Cambridge University Press 2005 {{ISBN|9780521839105}} p. 50</ref><ref name="ReferenceE">Ga ́bor A ́goston, Bruce Alan Masters ''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire'' Infobase Publishing 2010 {{ISBN|9781438110257}} p. 260</ref> He was deeply influenced by the works of Ibn Taymiyya and [[Ibn al-Qayyim]] and condemned many traditional Islamic practices, such as visiting the [[Muhammad|grave of Muhammad]] or [[Wali|Saints]], as sin.<ref name="ReferenceE" /> During this period he formed an alliance with the [[House of Saud|Saud family]], who founded the [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi sect]]. This revival movement allegedly seeks to uphold monotheism and purify Islam of what they see as later [[bidah|innovations]].

At the end of the 19th century, Muslim luminaries such as [[Muhammad Abduh]], [[Rashid Rida]] and [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]] sought to reconcile Islam with social and intellectual ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] by purging Islam from alleged alterations and adhering to the basic tenets held during the [[Rashidun]] era.<ref name="ReferenceF">Henri Lauzière ''The Making of Salafism: Islamic Reform in the Twentieth Century'' Columbia University Press 2015 {{ISBN|9780231540179}}</ref> Due to their adherence to the ''[[Salaf]]s'' they called themselves ''Salafiyya''.<ref name="ReferenceG">Robert Rabil ''Salafism in Lebanon: From Apoliticism to Transnational Jihadism'' Georgetown University Press 2014 {{ISBN|9781626161184}} chapter: "Doctrine"</ref><ref name="ReferenceF" /> However, they differ from the Salafi movement flourishing in the second half of the 20th century, which is rooted in the Wahhabi movement. Instead, they are also often called [[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernists]]. They rejected the [[Sunni schools of law]] and allowed [[Ijtihad]].<ref name="ReferenceG" />

Sunnis believe that the first four [[caliph]]s were the rightful successors to Muhammad; since God did not specify any particular leaders to succeed him and those leaders were elected. Further authorities regarding Sunnis believe that anyone who is righteous and just could be a caliph as long they act according to the teachings of Islam, the example of Muhammad. Alternatively, Sunnis commonly accept the companions of Muhammad as reliable for interpretating Islamic affairs.<ref>Coeli Fitzpatrick Ph.D., ''Adam Hani Walker Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God'' [2 volumes] ABC-CLIO, 25.04.2014 {{ISBN|9781610691789}} p. 106–107</ref>

The Sunnis follow the Quran and the Hadith, which are recorded in Sunni traditions known as [[Al-Kutub Al-Sittah]] (six major books). For legal matters derived from the Quran or the Hadith, many follow four sunni [[madhhab]]s: [[Hanafi]], [[Hanbali]], [[Maliki]] and [[Shafi'i]].

[[Schools of Islamic theology|Sunni schools of theology]] encompass [[Ashʿari|Asha]]rism founded by [[Al-Ashʿarī]] (c. 874–936), [[Maturidi]] by [[Abu Mansur al-Maturidi]] (853–944 CE) and [[Traditionalist theology (Islam)|traditionalist theology]] under the leadership of [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] (780–855 CE). Traditionalist theology is characterized by its adherence to a literal understanding of the Quran and the Sunnah, the belief in the Quran to be uncreated and eternal, and opposes reason ([[kalam]]) in religious and ethical matters.<ref>Hadi Enayat ''Islam and Secularism in Post-Colonial Thought: A Cartography of Asadian Genealogies'' Springer, 30.06.2017 {{ISBN|9783319526119}} p.48</ref> On the other hand, Maturidism asserts, scripture is not needed for basic ethics and that ''good'' and ''evil'' can be understood by reason alone.<ref>Rico Isaacs, Alessandro Frigerio ''Theorizing Central Asian Politics: The State, Ideology and Power'' Springer, 2018 {{ISBN|9783319973555}} p. 108</ref> Maturidi's doctrine, based on Hanafi law, asserted man's capacity and will alongside the supremacy of God in man's acts, providing a doctrinal framework for more flexibility, adaptability and syncretism.

In the 18th century, [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] led a [[Salafism|Salafi]] movement, referred by outsiders as [[Wahhabism]], in modern-day [[Saudi Arabia]]. Originally shaped by [[Hanbali]]sm, many modern followers departed from any of the established four schools of law Hanafi, Shafi, Maliki, and Hanbali.<ref>Richard Gauvain ''Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God Routledge'' 2013 {{ISBN|9780710313560}} page 8</ref> Similarly, [[Ahl al-Hadith]] is a movement that deemphasized sources of jurisprudence outside the Quran and Hadith, such as informed opinion (ra'y).

While the Sunnis believe that a Caliph should be elected by the community, Shia's believe that Muhammad appointed his son-in-law, [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], as his successor and only certain descendants of Ali could hold positions of power. As a result, they believe that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] was the first ''Imam'' (leader), rejecting the legitimacy of the previous Muslim caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]]. Other points of contention include certain practices viewed as [[Bid‘ah|innovating]] the religion, such as the mourning practice of [[tatbir]], and the cursing of figures revered by Sunnis. However, [[Jafar al-Sadiq]] himself disapproved of people who disapproved of his great-grandfather [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Zayd ibn Ali]] revered Abu Bakr and [[Umar]].<ref name="Tabarī, Carole Hillenbrand 1989, p37">''The waning of the Umayyad caliphate'' by Tabarī, Carole Hillenbrand, 1989, pp. 37–38</ref><ref name="Religion Vol 1987, p243">''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' Vol.16, Mircea Eliade, Charles J.

Shia Islam has several branches, the most prominent being the [[Twelvers]] (the largest branch), [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidis]] and [[Ismaili]]s. Different branches accept different descendants of Ali as Imams. After the death of Imam [[Jafar al-Sadiq]] who is considered the sixth Imam by the [[Twelvers]] and the [[Ismaili]]'s, the Ismailis recognized his son Isma'il ibn Jafar as his successor whereas the Twelver Shia's followed his other son [[Musa al-Kadhim]] as the seventh Imam. The [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydis]] consider [[Zayd ibn Ali]], the uncle of Imam [[Jafar al-Sadiq]], as their fifth Imam, and follow a different line of succession after him.

==Culture==
{{Main|Islamic culture}}
The term "[[Islamic culture]]" could be used to mean aspects of culture that pertain to the religion, such as [[festivals]] and dress code. It is also controversially used to denote the cultural aspects of traditionally [[Muslim]] people.<ref>{{cite news|last=Melikian|first=Souren|date=4 November 2011|title='Islamic' Culture: A Groundless Myth|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/05/arts/05iht-rartmelikian05.html|url-access=subscription|accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref> Finally, "Islamic civilization" may also refer to the aspects of the synthesized culture of the early Caliphates, including that of non-Muslims,<ref>{{Harvtxt|Esposito|2010|p=56}}</ref> sometimes referred to as "[[wikt:Islamicate|Islamicate]]".

===Architecture===
{{Main|Islamic architecture}}
Perhaps the most important expression of Islamic architecture is that of the mosque.<ref name=":5" /> Varying cultures have an effect on mosque architecture. For example, North African and Spanish Islamic architecture such as the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] contain [[marble]] and [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] columns from Roman and Byzantine buildings,<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Isichei|first1=Elizabeth Allo|url={{Google books|LgnhYDozENgC|page=PA175|keywords=mosque%20kairouan%20roman columns|text=mosque+kairouan+roman+columns|plainurl=yes}}|title=A history of African societies to 1870|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-521-45599-2|location=Cambridge|pages=175|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref> while [[mosques in Indonesia]] often have multi-tiered roofs from local [[Java]]nese styles.

===Art===
{{Main|Islamic art}}
{{see also|Ottoman miniature|Safavid art|Mughal painting}}
[[Islamic art]] encompasses the [[visual arts]] produced from the 7th century onwards by people (not necessarily [[Muslim]]) who lived within the territory that was inhabited by Muslim populations.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ettinghausen, Richard, Oleg Grabar, and Marilyn Jenkins-Madina|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780300088670/page/3|title=Islamic Art and Architecture 650-1250|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-300-08869-8|edition=2nd|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780300088670/page/3 3]}}</ref> It includes fields as varied as architecture, [[calligraphy]], painting, and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]], among others.

While not condemned in the Quran, making images of human beings and animals is frowned on in many Islamic cultures and connected with [[Aniconism in Islam|laws against idolatry]] common to all Abrahamic religions, as [[Abdullah ibn Masud|Abdullaah ibn Mas'ood]] reported that Muhammad said, "Those who will be most severely punished by Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be the image-makers" (reported by [[Sahih al-Bukhari|al-Bukhaari]]).<ref group="lower-roman">{{Cite Quran|48|10|s=ns|expand=yes}}</ref> However, this rule has been interpreted in different ways by different scholars and in different historical periods, and there are examples of paintings of both animals and humans in [[Mughal painting|Mughal]], [[Persian art|Persian]], and [[Turkish art]]. The existence of this [[Aniconism in Islam|aversion to creating images of animate beings]] has been used to explain the prevalence of [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[tessellation]], and pattern as key aspects of Islamic artistic culture.<ref>{{cite book| publisher=Oxford University Press | title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Science, and Technology in Islam | author1=Salim Ayduz | author2= Ibrahim Kalin | author3=Caner Dagli| date=2014 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=or-6BwAAQBAJ&q=islamic+art+idolatry+geometry&pg=PA263 | quote=Figural representation is virtually unused in Islamic art because of Islam's strong antagonism of idolatry. It was important for Muslim scholars and artists to find a style of art that represented the Islamic ideals of unity (''tawhid'') and order without figural representation.  Geometric patterns perfectly suited this goal.| isbn=9780199812578 }}</ref>

Criticism of Islam has existed since Islam's formative stages. Early criticism came from Christian authors, many of whom viewed Islam as a Christian [[heresy]] or a form of [[idolatry]], often explaining it in apocalyptic terms.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Fahlbusch, Erwin|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=yaecVMhMWaEC|page=759}}|title=The Encyclopedia of Christianity|publisher=Wm.

Islamic salvation optimism and its carnality were criticized by Christian writers.{{cn|date=September 2020}} Islam's sensual descriptions of paradise led many Christians to conclude that Islam was not a spiritual religion.{{cn|date=September 2020}} Although sensual pleasure was also present in early Christianity, as seen in the writings of [[Irenaeus]], the doctrines of the former [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] [[Augustine of Hippo]] led to the broad repudiation of bodily pleasure in both life and the afterlife.{{cn|date=September 2020}} [[Ali ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari]] defended the Quranic description of paradise by asserting that the Bible also implies such ideas, such as drinking wine in [[Gospel of Matthew]].{{cn|date=September 2020}}
