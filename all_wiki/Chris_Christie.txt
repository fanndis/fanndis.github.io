'''Christopher James Christie''' (born September 6, 1962) is an American politician, political commentator, [[lobbying in the United States|lobbyist]] and former [[United States attorney|federal prosecutor]] who served as the 55th [[Governor of New Jersey]] from 2010 to 2018.

Christie was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]] and raised in [[Livingston, New Jersey]]. After graduating in 1984 from the [[University of Delaware]], he earned a [[juris doctor|J.D.]] at [[Seton Hall University School of Law]]. A Republican, Christie was elected [[Board of chosen freeholders|county freeholder]] (legislator) for [[Morris County, New Jersey]], serving from 1995 to 1998. By 2002, he had campaigned for [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]]; the latter appointed him [[United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey|U.S. Attorney for New Jersey]], a position he held from 2002 to 2008.

Christie won the 2009 Republican primary for [[Governor of New Jersey]] and defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Jon Corzine]] in the [[2009 New Jersey gubernatorial election|general election]]. In his first term, he was credited with cutting spending, capping property tax growth, and engaging in recovery efforts after [[Hurricane Sandy]]. He was re-elected by a wide margin in [[2013 New Jersey gubernatorial election|2013]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mindock|first1=Clark|title=Chris Christie Sandy Recovery: As Presidential Campaign Falters, New Jersey Governor Slammed For Hurricane Response|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/chris-christie-sandy-recovery-presidential-campaign-falters-new-jersey-governor-2037230|accessdate=January 26, 2017|work=International Business Times|date=August 8, 2015}}</ref> During his second term as governor, Christie's standing was damaged by the [[Fort Lee lane closure scandal]]. After that time, he ranked among the least popular governors in the United States.

Christie chaired the [[Republican Governors Association]] during the 2014 election cycle. On June 30, 2015, he announced [[Chris Christie presidential campaign, 2016|his candidacy]] for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican nomination]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]]. He suspended his candidacy on February 10, 2016. Later, he endorsed eventual winner [[Donald Trump]] and was named head of Trump's [[Planned presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition planning team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/26/politics/chris-christie-endorses-donald-trump/index.html|title=Chris Christie endorses Donald Trump |author1=[[Jeremy Diamond (journalist)|Jeremy Diamond]] |author2=Jake Tapper |author3=Phil Mattingly |author4=Stephen Collinson |date=February 26, 2016|work=CNN|accessdate=February 27, 2016}}</ref> Christie left office in 2018 at the conclusion of his second term as Governor of New Jersey, and registered as a lobbyist in June 2020.<ref name=meyercancryn/>

== Law practice and local politics ==

=== Lawyer ===
In 1987, Christie joined the law firm of Dughi, Hewit & Palatucci of [[Cranford, New Jersey]].<ref name=facts>"[http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/17/us/chris-christie-fast-facts Here's a look at the life of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie]", [[CNN]] (February 17, 2013).</ref> In 1993, he was named a partner in the firm.<ref name=facts /> Christie specialized in [[securities]] law, [[appellate]] practice, election law, and government affairs. He is a member of the [[American Bar Association]] and the New Jersey State Bar Association and was a member of the Election Law Committee of the New Jersey State Bar Association. From 1999 to 2001, Christie was registered statehouse [[lobbyist]] for Dughi and Hewit.<ref>{{cite news | last = Rispoli | first = Michael | title = Gov.

=== Morris County Freeholder ===
Christie volunteered for President [[George H. W. Bush]]'s [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 re-election campaign]] in New Jersey, and became close to Bush's state director, [[Bill Palatucci]]. Following the campaign, Christie decided to run for office, and moved to [[Mendham Township, New Jersey|Mendham Township]]. In 1993, Christie launched a primary challenge against the [[New Jersey Senate]] Majority Leader, [[John H. Dorsey]]. However, Christie's campaign ended after Dorsey successfully challenged the validity of Christie's [[petition#Modern use|petition]] to appear on the ballot.<ref name=Lizza />

In 1994, Christie was elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the [[Board of Chosen Freeholders]], or legislators, for [[Morris County, New Jersey]], after he and a running mate defeated incumbent freeholders in the party primary. Following the election, the defeated incumbents filed a [[defamation]] lawsuit against Christie based on statements made during the primary campaign.<ref name="nuzzi-politico">{{cite web|last=Nuzzi|first=Olivia|title=Portrait of the Governor as a Young Man|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/02/portrait-of-the-governor-as-a-young-man-chris-christie-103502_Page3.html|publisher=Politico|accessdate=February 19, 2014}}</ref> Christie had incorrectly stated that the incumbents were under "investigation" for violating certain local laws. The lawsuit was settled out of court, with Christie acknowledging that the prosecutor had actually convened an "inquiry" instead of an "investigation", and apologizing for the error, which he said was unintentional.<ref name="Christie's 1st political foray">Symons, Michael and Ingle, Bob.

As freeholder, Christie required the county government to obtain three quotes from qualified firms for all contracts. He led a successful effort to bar county officials from accepting gifts from people and firms doing business with the county. He voted to raise the county's open space tax for land preservation; however, county taxes on the whole were decreased by 6.6% during his tenure. He successfully pushed for the dismissal of an architect hired to design a new jail, saying that the architect was costing taxpayers too much money. The architect then sued Christie for defamation over remarks he made about the dismissal, eventually dropping the suit without explanation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Heininger|first=Claire|title=GOP candidate Chris Christie launched political career as Morris County freeholder|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=May 11, 2009|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/05/gop_candidate_chris_christie_l.html|accessdate=August 25, 2009}}</ref><ref>Symons, Michael and Ingle, Bob.

In 1995, Christie announced a bid for a seat in the [[New Jersey General Assembly]]; he and attorney [[Rick Merkt]] ran as a ticket against incumbent Assemblyman [[Anthony Bucco]] and attorney [[Michael Patrick Carroll]] in the Republican primary. Christie ran as a pro-choice candidate and supporter of the ban on [[assault weapons]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Nuzzi|first=Olivia|title=Portrait of the Governor as a young man|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/02/portrait-of-the-governor-as-a-young-man-chris-christie-103502_Page3.html|publisher=Politico}}</ref> Bucco and Carroll, the establishment candidates, defeated the up-and-comers by a wide margin. After this loss, Christie's bid for re-nomination to the freeholder board was unlikely, as unhappy Republicans recruited John J. Murphy to run against Christie in 1997. Murphy defeated Christie in the primary.<ref name="political career">{{cite news|last=Pizarrom|first=Max|title=A political career in three parts: Chris Christie, the freeholder|publisher=[[Politicker Network|PolitickerNJ.com]]|date=December 29, 2008|url=http://www.politickernj.com/max/26275/political-career-three-parts-chris-christie-freeholder|accessdate=August 25, 2009}}</ref> Murphy, who had falsely accused Christie of having the county pay his legal bills in the architect's lawsuit, was sued by Christie after the election.

=== Lobbyist ===
When Christie's part-time position as a Chosen Freeholder lapsed, he returned full attention to his law firm Dughi, Hewit & Palatucci. Alongside fellow partner and later, gubernatorial campaign fundraiser Bill Palatucci, Christie's firm opened an office in the state capital, [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], devoted mainly to lobbying.<ref>Symons, Michael and Ingle, Bob.

=== Appointment ===
On December 7, 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] appointed Christie the [[U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/12/20011207-9.html|title=Nominations|date=December 7, 2001|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}</ref> During a Republican presidential debate in August 2015, Christie falsely claimed he had been appointed by President Bush on September 10, 2001 and that the [[9/11 attacks]] occurred in his state the next day. Some members of the New Jersey Bar professed disappointment at Christie's lack of experience. At the time, he had never practiced in a federal courtroom before, and had little experience in criminal law. Christie received the overwhelming support of the Republican Party in New Jersey. A spokesperson for Acting Governor Donald DiFrancesco, who selected nominees for the position, said that he received hundreds of letters of support for Christie "from everyone from the Assembly speaker down to the county level, close to every member of the Legislature and every county chairman." Christie was also a top fundraiser for Bush's [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000|2000 presidential campaign]]. He helped raise $350,000 for Bush, qualifying him as a "Pioneer", and also donated to DiFrancesco.<ref>{{Citation|last=Mansnerus|first=Laura|title=New Jersey G.O.P. and Legal Elite Differ on U.S. Attorney|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=August 26, 2001|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/26/nyregion/new-jersey-gop-and-legal-elite-differ-on-us-attorney.html|accessdate=March 25, 2009}}</ref><ref name=NewRepublic>{{cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/116601/chris-christies-rise-and-fall|title=Chris Christie's Rise and Fall|last=MacGillis|first=Alec|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=February 12, 2014}}</ref> Democrats seized upon the role played by Bush's political adviser, [[Karl Rove]], after Christie's law partner, William Palatucci, a Republican political consultant and Bush supporter, boasted that he had selected a United States attorney by forwarding Christie's résumé to Rove.<ref>{{Citation|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David D.|last2=Rutenberg|first2=Jim|title=E-Mail Shows Rove's Role in Fate of Prosecutors|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/washington/29rove.html|accessdate=August 26, 2009}}</ref> According to New Jersey's senior Senator, [[Bob Torricelli]], Christie promised to appoint a "professional" with federal courtroom experience as deputy if confirmed. By Senate tradition, if a state's senior Senator opposes the nomination of a U.S. Attorney, the nomination is effectively dead, but Christie's promise was enough for Torricelli to give the nomination his blessing.<ref name=NewRepublic /> He was unanimously confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on December 20, 2001, and sworn into office on January 17, 2002.

The brother of Christie's uncle (his aunt's second husband), [[Tino Fiumara]], was an [[organized crime]] figure; according to Christie, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] presumably knew that when they conducted his background check.<ref name=fiumaralink>{{cite news|first1=David M.|last1=Halbfinger|first2=David|last2=Kocieniewski|title=For Christie, Family Tie No Candidate Can Relish|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 23, 2009|accessdate=October 17, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/nyregion/24christie.html}}</ref> Later, Christie recused himself from the case and commented about what he had learned growing up with such a relative: "It just told me that you make bad decisions in life and you wind up paying a price."<ref name=fiumaralink />

Christie negotiated seven deal [[deferred prosecution]] agreements (DPAs) during his tenure, some of which were controversial.<ref name=Barkow>Barkow, Anthony and [[Rachel Barkow]].

===== Tax credits and incentives =====
On September 18, 2013, Christie signed legislation to overhaul the state's business tax incentive programs. The legislation reduced the number of tax incentive programs from five to two, raised the caps on tax credits, and allowed smaller companies to qualify. It also increased the credits available for businesses in [[South Jersey]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Chris Christie Signs New Jersey Tax Incentives Bill|author=Heather Haddon|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/18/chris-christie-signs-new-jersey-tax-incentives-bill|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=September 18, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref>

===== Public employee pensions =====
In March 2010, Christie signed into law three state pension reform bills, which had passed with bipartisan support. The laws decreased pension benefits for future hires and required public employees to contribute 1.5 percent of their salaries toward their health care. The laws prompted a lawsuit by the police and firefighters' unions.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Megerian| first = Chris | title = N.J. police, firefighter unions sue to stop pension reform laws| newspaper = [[The Star-Ledger]] | date = April 23, 2010| url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/04/nj_police_firefighter_unions_s.html| accessdate = March 5, 2011}}</ref> In his campaign for governor, Christie opposed any change in pension benefits for firefighters and law enforcement officers, including "current officers, future officers or retirees".

The deal raised public employees' pension contributions, mandated the state to make annual payments into the system, increased public employee contributions toward health insurance premiums, and ended collective bargaining for health benefits. The reform is projected to save the state $120&nbsp;billion over 30 years.<ref>{{cite news|title=Christie wins on pension, health benefits reform|author=Mark Impomeni|url=http://www.humanevents.com/2011/06/22/christie-wins-on-pension-health-benefits-reform|work=Human Events|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=August 4, 2013}}</ref>

In June 2013, Christie signed a $33&nbsp;billion state budget that makes a record $1.7&nbsp;billion payment to the state's pension fund and also increases school funding by almost $100&nbsp;million. The budget resulted from negotiations between Christie and Democratic leaders in the state legislature and was the first that Christie has signed as passed, without vetoing any of its provisions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Christie signs bipartisan budget, but vetoes 8 Democratic bills|author=Salvador Rizzo|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/06/gov_christie_signs_2013_nj_budget.html|work=The Star-Ledger|date=June 28, 2013}}</ref>

In May 2014, Christie cut the contributions to New Jersey public workers' pension funds for a 14-month period by nearly $2.5&nbsp;billion to deal with a revenue shortfall in the state budget of $2.75&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/05/20/chris-christie-new-jersey-pension-payments/9333971/ |title=Gov.

Christie cited the state constitution's requirement to have a balanced budget for his decision to cut payments to pensions for state workers, and follows Christie's changes to the state's pension formula earlier in 2014 to save $900&nbsp;million through the end of his term.<ref>{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Zeke|title=Christie Cuts Pension Payments as Fiscal Record Shows Cracks|url=http://time.com/106570/christie-cuts-pension-payments-as-fiscal-record-shows-cracks/|work=Times|accessdate=May 23, 2014|date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>

==== Education ====
Perhaps the most controversial school policy kept alive during Christie's reign as governor of New Jersey was state control of school districts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/14/05/12/explainer-state-control-of-local-school-districts-comes-under-fire-in-third-decade/|accessdate=September 9, 2017|title=STATE CONTROL OF LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS COMES UNDER FIRE IN THIRD DECADE}}</ref> These school districts contained relatively high numbers of underachieving students, people of color, people who are poor, and people who belonged to the Democratic political party, which was in opposition to Christie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nj.gov/education/archive/abbotts/sosd/archive/streport.htm|title=Report to the Commissioner: Working Group on State Takeover|accessdate=September 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/25/camden-schools-takeover/2017259/|title=N.J. governor announces takeover of Camden schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=September 9, 2017}}</ref> In Newark, Christie hired Chris Cerf to replace Cami Anderson to be the state-appointed authority over the school district<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobbraunsledger.com/scrap-the-newark-education-success-board-it-will-only-impede-local-control/|accessdate=September 9, 2017|title=Scrap the "Newark Educational Success Board"–it will only impede local control}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobbraunsledger.com/christie-and-cami-have-stolen-more-than-money-from-newark/|title=Christie and Cami have stolen more than money from Newark|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=September 9, 2017}}</ref> Under Christie, Cerf took the politically unpopular move to overrule the democratically elected school board in Newark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobbraunsledger.com/the-newark-board-defies-cerf-cerf-politely-defies-the-newark-board-christie-is-still-the-decider/|title=The Newark board defies Cerf.

Another political scandal implicating Christie has been the under-funding of school districts. Reports found that Christie's state government did not follow the School Funding Reform Act and illegally withheld funds from districts throughout New Jersey. A 2017 school funding proposal by Christie was described by education researchers as "one of the least equitable in the country"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://njedpolicy.wordpress.com/2016/06/30/how-fair-is-the-fairness-formula-for-new-jersey-school-children-taxpayers/|title=How Fair is the "Fairness Formula" for New Jersey School Children & Taxpayers?|publisher=New Jersey Education Policy Forum|date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=December 8, 2018}}</ref> During Christie's governorship, State Commissioner of Education Chris Cerf came to the defense of the policies that the NJ Supreme Court declared unconstitutional,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/cerf_defends_christies_propose.html|title=Cerf defends Christie's proposed changes to school funding formula|publisher=[[NJ.com]]|last=Calefati|first=Jessica|date=March 29, 2012|accessdate=December 8, 2018}}</ref> which contradicted basic education research.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://schoolfinance101.wordpress.com/2017/09/09/realty-check-trends-in-school-finance/|title=Realty Check: Trends in School Finance|publisher=School Finance 101|last=Baker|first=Bruce|date=September 9, 2017|accessdate=December 8, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/StealthInequities.pdf|title=The Stealth Inequities of School Funding|publisher=[[American Progress (newspaper)|American Progress]]|date=September 2012|last=Baker|first=Bruce|accessdate=December 8, 2018}}</ref>

Christie, whose own children attend [[Catholic school|Catholic parochial school]], is a strong supporter of the state granting [[tax credits]] to parents who send their children to [[Private school|private]] and [[parochial school]]s.<ref>{{cite news | last = Wiener | first = Robert | title = Christie holds meeting with Orthodox leaders: Republican hopeful offers support for school funding plans | newspaper = New Jersey Jewish News | date = August 6, 2009 | url = http://www.njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/080609/njChristieHoldsMeetings.html | access-date = May 24, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150112152540/http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/080609/njChristieHoldsMeetings.html | archive-date = January 12, 2015 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

On August 25, 2010, the U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]] announced $400&nbsp;million in federal [[Race to the Top]] education grants to New Jersey would not be funded due to a clerical error in the state's application made by an unidentified mid-level state official. Christie responded by saying that the [[Obama administration]] bureaucracy had overstepped its authority and that the error lay in an administration failure to communicate with the New Jersey government.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Friedman|first=Matt|date=August 25, 2010|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/08/gov_christie_blames_washington.html|title=Gov.

Schundler maintained that he told Christie the truth and that Christie was misstating what actually occurred.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Katz|first=Matt|date=August 28, 2010|url=http://articles.philly.com/2010-08-28/news/24999092_1_christie-top-schools-official-million-mistake|title=Christie fires education chief Schundler after U.S. aid mistake|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}</ref>

In January 2011, the Christie administration approved 23 new charter schools, including the state's first independent school for children with autism. The approvals increased the number of charter schools in the state to 96.<ref>{{cite news|title=Christie Expands Number of Charter Schools in New Jersey|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/01/19/christie-expands-number-charter-schools-new-jersey|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=January 19, 2011}}</ref>

On August 6, 2012, Christie signed a law reforming the tenure system for New Jersey public school teachers. Under the new law, teachers will be required to work four years, instead of three, in order to earn tenure. Additionally, teachers will need to earn positive ratings two years in a row before tenure can be awarded. Tenured teachers with poor ratings for two consecutive years will be eligible for dismissal. Finally the law limits the hearing process for appeals related to dismissal of tenured teachers to 105 days.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Jersey Gov Chris Christie gets tough on teacher tenure|author=Rachel Monahan|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/new-jersey-gov-chris-christie-tough-teacher-tenure-new-law-requires-educators-work-years-reach-status-article-1.1130359|location=New York|work=Daily News|date=August 6, 2012}}</ref>

On March 6, 2013, the Christie administration released proposed regulations to overhaul the process of evaluating public school teachers in New Jersey. Under the proposal, a percentage of teachers' evaluations would be based on student growth on state tests or based on student achievement goals set with principals.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Leslie Brody|date=March 6, 2013|title=Christie administration reveals details of teacher evaluation proposal|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/Christie_administration_unveils_details_of_teacher_evaluation_proposal.html|publisher=NorthJersey.com |accessdate=August 19, 2013}}</ref>

In September 2014, Christie signed a partnership with Mexico on a higher education project to foster economic cooperation. The program will focus on research ventures, cross-border fellowships, student and teacher exchanges and conferences—among other educational opportunities.<ref>{{cite web | last1=Colvin | first1=Jil | url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2014/09/04/christie-continues-mexico-trade-mission | title=Christie signs partnership with Mexico on higher education projects, won't discuss immigration | website=US News | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=September 9, 2014}}</ref>

==== Energy and environment ====
Christie has stated that he believes that the [[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]] is too big and is "killing business" with permit delays and indiscriminate fines. He announced that, if elected, the agency would be his first target for government reduction: he would reduce its workforce and strip it of its fish and wildlife oversight.<ref name="DEP cuts">{{cite news |last = Rispoli| first=Michael| title = GOP candidate Chris Christie calls for cuts to N.J.

Christie has stated that he intends to simultaneously spur growth in the state's manufacturing sector and increase New Jersey's capability to produce [[alternative energy]]. He has proposed a list of policy measures to achieve this, including giving tax credits to businesses that build new [[wind power|wind energy]] and manufacturing facilities, changing land use rules to allow solar energy on [[Farmland preservation|permanently preserved farmland]], installing [[Photovoltaic power station|solar farms]] on closed landfills, setting up a consolidated energy promotion program, and following a five-to-one production to non-production job ratio in the creation of new energy jobs.<ref name="Energy as Industry">{{cite web| authorlink = Chris Christie for Governor, Inc| title = Energy as Industry| publisher = Chris Christie for Governor, Inc| url = http://www.christiefornj.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=180&Itemid=50| accessdate = July 14, 2009}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=Artix Kreiger 2 |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In August 2010, legislation to encourage the development of [[wind power in New Jersey]] was signed by Christie at the [[Port of Paulsboro]].

===== Hydraulic fracturing =====
Christie has rejected permanent bans on [[hydraulic fracturing]] (fracking) in New Jersey and vetoed measures that would ban the process and disposal of hydraulic fracturing waste in the State. New Jersey has few proven shale reserves and the process is not practiced there. Christie argued that the vetoed Senate Bill (S253) was premature because of an ongoing study to be completed in 2014 and would discriminate against other states, a violation of the [[Dormant Commerce Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution.<ref name="PCT01102012">{{cite news|first= Malewitz|last=Jim|date=September 24, 2012|title=In New Jersey, Christie Vetoes Anti-Fracking Bill|url=http://www.pewstates.org/projects/stateline/headlines/in-new-jersey-christie-vetoes-anti-fracking-bill-85899418995|work=Stateline|publisher=The Pew Charitable Trusts|accessdate= November 13, 2013}}</ref> Supporters of legislation have said that [[Hydraulic fracturing#Flowback|hydraulic fracturing waste]] from Pennsylvania makes its way into New Jersey for treatment, although how much is not clear.

===== Exxon Mobil environmental contamination lawsuit =====
{{Main|Exxon Mobil-New Jersey Environmental Contamination Settlement}}
Christie's settled a lawsuit with [[Exxon Mobil]] by allowing the corporation to pay $225 million in damages for environmental contamination at two sites, less than 3% of the $8.9 billion that the state's lawyers had sought, and extended the compensation to cover other damages not named in the original lawsuit.<ref name="ExxonSettlement">{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/03/state_announces_settlement_in_controversial_exxon.html|title=State announces settlement in controversial Exxon Mobil pollution case|last=Sullivan|first=S.P.|work=The Star-Ledger|date=March 5, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> The settlement was slammed by environmental advocates.

In June 2013, Christie vetoed S1921, an animal welfare bill introduced by the [[Humane Society of the United States]] to prohibit the use of [[gestation crates]] on pregnant pigs in the state.

Christie emphasizes the need to secure the border, and believes it is premature to discuss legalization of people who came to the United States unlawfully.<ref>Massie, Christopher.

In neither house was the bill passed by a veto-proof majority. Governor Christie vetoed the bill the next day and called for a constitutional amendment for same-sex marriage to be presented to the voters as a ballot referendum.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/18/nyregion/christie-vetoes-gay-marriage-bill.html |title=Christie Vetoes Gay Marriage Bill |date= February 17, 2012 |accessdate=March 30, 2014 |author=Kate Zernike}}</ref> He also called for creation of an [[ombudsman]] (public advocate) to ensure compliance with the state's existing [[Recognition of same-sex unions in New Jersey|civil union]] law.<ref>{{Cite news|title=N.J.

Christie's veto was overturned in a court decision in the ''[[Same-sex marriage in New Jersey#Garden State Equality v. Dow|Garden State Equality v.

Following the decision, the Christie administration immediately asked the state Supreme Court to grant a [[Stay of proceedings|stay]] of the decision pending appeal, which was denied on October 18, 2013, in a 7–0 decision of the court which stated that it could "find no public interest in depriving a group of New Jersey residents of their constitutional right to equal protection while the appeals process unfolds".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/NJ_Supreme_Court_declines_to_issue_stay_in_gay_marriage_ruling.html|title=NJ Supreme Court won't delay gay marriage|publisher=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref> Three days later Christie withdrew the state's appeal.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/10/21/christie-drops-appeal-of-gay-marriage-ruling/|title = Christie drops appeal of gay marriage ruling|work = The Washington Post|date = October 21, 2013|accessdate = October 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Koenig|first=Bryan|title=Christie drops challenge to same-sex marriages|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/21/christie-drops-challenge-to-same-sex-marriages/?hpt=po_c2|publisher=CNN|date=October 21, 2013|accessdate=October 21, 2013}}</ref>

During his administration's eight years, the governor's office spent more than $1 million fighting [[Open Public Records Act|New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA)]] requests. On his way out, the governor, in an official letter to the State Archives, dictated how his office's records be handled. This came to light in May 2018, as the State Archives' release of electronic records relating to business by Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, were denied by his personal lawyer; Kushner's real estate company received $33 million in state tax breaks.<ref name="Christie limits State Archives records release">{{cite web |last1=Perez |first1=Andrew |title=Chris Christie blocks release of his office's emails with Jared Kushner's company |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40577859/chris-christie-blocks-release-of-his-offices-emails-with-jared-kushners-company |website=Fast Company |access-date=May 31, 2018 |date=May 25, 2018}}</ref> Open records experts challenged Christie's "disturbing" actions.<ref name="May 2018 The Hill open records blocked">{{cite web |last1=Bowden |first1=John |title=Christie blocks release of correspondence with Kushner Companies |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/389415-christie-lawyer-blocking-release-of-correspondence-with-kushner |website=TheHill |access-date=May 31, 2018 |language=en |date=May 25, 2018}}</ref>

===2012 presidential election===
There was ongoing speculation that Christie would attempt a run for [[President of the United States]] in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] by competing in the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2012|Republican primaries]]. In September 2011, a number of press stories cited unnamed sources indicating Christie was reconsidering his decision to stay out of the race. An Associated Press story dated September 30 indicated a decision on whether he would run for president in 2012 would be made "soon".<ref>{{Cite news |title=AP Sources: Christie Soon to Decide on Primary Run |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/apnewsbreak-christie-decide-2012-bid-14643134 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20160208055545/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Election |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 8, 2016 |date=September 30, 2011 |first=Beth |last=DeFalco |publisher=[[ABC News]] |agency=Associated Press |access-date=October 1, 2011  }}</ref> In a late September speech at the [[Reagan Library]], he had again said he was not a candidate for president, but the speech also coincided with his "reconsideration" of the negative decision.

===2020 presidential election===
In 2020, Christie offered to help Trump win re-election. One of his roles was helping the president to prepare for his first debate with challenger [[Joe Biden]] on September 29, 2020. He visited the White House repeatedly during the four days preceding the debate. He said the prep sessions involved five or six people in total, none of whom wore facial coverings despite the ongoing [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. He added that he tested negative for the virus each time he entered the White House and saw no-one exhibiting symptoms.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/02/chris-christie-no-masks-at-debate-prep-before-trump-positive-covid-test/5892760002/|title='No one was wearing masks' during debate prep, Chris Christie says after president contracts coronavirus|last=Cummings|first=William|date=October 2, 2020|work=USA Today|accessdate=9 October 2020}}</ref> On October 3 he tested positive and was hospitalized, calling it a precautionary measure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/03/chris-christie-tests-positive-for-coronavirus.html|title=Chris Christie tests positive for coronavirus, checks into hospital as precautionary measure|last=Newburger|first=Emma|date=October 3, 2020|work=CNBC|accessdate=9 October 2020}}</ref> He was released from the hospital on October 10.<ref name = released>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chris-christie-released-hospital-testing-positive-covid-19-morristown-medical-center/|title=Former NJ Governor Chris Christie Released From Hospital After Positive COVID Test|date=October 10, 2020|work=CBS News|accessdate=11 October 2020}}</ref>

== Opioid epidemic efforts ==
In March 2017, Trump picked Christie to chair the [[Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission]], an advisory committee on the [[opioid epidemic in the United States]].<ref>Jen Christensen, [http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/29/health/christie-opioid-trump-appointment/index.html Christie will advise Trump panel on opioid addiction], CNN (March 29, 2017).</ref><ref>Katelyn Newman, [https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-06-16/commission-on-combating-drug-addiction-and-opioid-crisis-holds-first-meeting Opioid Commission Holds First Meeting], ''U.S. News & World Report'' (June 16, 2017).</ref>

In May 2020, Christie stated that measures taken during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]] should be lifted for economic reasons.
