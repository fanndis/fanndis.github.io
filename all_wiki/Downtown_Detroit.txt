'''Downtown Detroit''' is the [[central business district]] and a [[Neighborhoods in Detroit|residential]] area of the city of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], United States. Locally, downtown tends to refer to the 1.4 square mile region bordered by [[M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10]] (Lodge Freeway) to the west, [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate 75]] (I-75, Fisher Freeway) to the north, [[Interstate 375 (Michigan)|I-375]] (Chrysler Freeway) to the east, and the [[Detroit River]] to the south. Although, it may also refer to the Greater Downtown area, a 7.2 square mile<ref>https://detroitsevenpointtwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/7.2SQ_MI_Book_FINAL_LoRes.pdf</ref> region that includes surrounding neighborhoods such as [[Midtown Detroit|Midtown]], [[Corktown, Detroit|Corktown]], Rivertown, and [[Woodbridge, Detroit|Woodbridge]].

The city's main thoroughfare [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|M-1]] (Woodward Avenue) links Downtown to [[Midtown Detroit|Midtown]], [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]], and the [[North End, Detroit|North End]].

Downtown contains a lot of [[Architecture of metropolitan Detroit|historic architecture]], including prominent skyscrapers, ranging from the [[Renaissance Center]], the [[Penobscot Building]], [[One Detroit Center]], and the [[Guardian Building]]. Historic churches, [[Theatre in Detroit|theatres]], and commercial buildings anchor the various downtown districts. Downtown has a number of parks including those linked by a promenade along the [[Detroit International Riverfront|International Riverfront]]. Its central square is [[Campus Martius Park]].

==History==
Following the Detroit fire of 1805, the design for the downtown area was left open to a new vision. [[Augustus B. Woodward]] proposed a radial design<ref>Sugrue, Thomas. ''The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar''. Princeton University Press, 1996</ref> for the post-fire city, where major streets such as [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward]], Washington, and Madison Avenue would spiral off [[Grand Circus Park Historic District|Grand Circus Park]]. [[File:Old map 1807 plan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Augustus Woodward's radial design plan]] The downtown streets still loosely follow Woodward’s original design. Business in Detroit boomed along with its growing automobile industry, leading to an increase in downtown’s population and wealth. Much of the downtown area’s architecture was built during this boom, in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and still attracts the attention of architects. Several buildings were built by the famous [[Minoru Yamasaki]] (most well-known for designing the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|twin towers]] in New York City), including the [[McGregor Memorial Conference Center]] and [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch Building]].

The area where [[Interstate 375 (Michigan)|I-375]] is lies on the historic site of [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Black Bottom]] and Paradise Valley. Black Bottom was one of the city’s major African American communities, historically named by French colonial settlers for its rich soil.<ref>https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/black-bottom-neighborhood</ref> Paradise Valley was the business and entertainment district of Black Bottom, best known for its [[Orchestra Hall (Detroit)|Paradise Theatre]] and Hotel Gotham, where prominent jazz figures such as [[Duke Ellington]], [[Billie Holiday]], and [[Louis Armstrong]] performed and stayed respectively. Both neighborhoods were demolished to build I-375, and have since been replaced with [[Lafayette Park, Detroit|Lafayette Park]].

==Redevelopment==

Downtown was once notorious for its abandonment, vacant buildings, and disinvestment, especially once the city filed for [[Detroit bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] in 2013. The effects of such can still be seen today the further one travels outside of the downtown area. [[File:RenCen.JPG|thumb|150px|left|The [[Renaissance Center]] along the [[Detroit International Riverfront|International Riverfront]]]]However, in recent years, the downtown area has seen tremendous growth and redevelopment.

Since 2000 a number of major [[construction]] projects have been completed including the new [[Compuware World Headquarters|Compuware Headquarters]] at [[Campus Martius Park]] and two new stadiums: [[Comerica Park]] and [[Ford Field]]. [[General Motors]] moved their headquarters into the [[Renaissance Center]], and the [[Detroit Lions]] have relocated from [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] to Downtown Detroit. High-profile events like the 2005 [[MLB All-Star Game]], [[Super Bowl XL]], and the [[2006 World Series|2006]] and [[2012 World Series]] have taken place in downtown, generating income for local businesses and spurring more growth.<ref>[http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061106/NEWS05/611060337/-1/BUSINESS07 Detroit Free Press (2006-11-06)]</ref> As a result, new residents are moving into Detroit in the assortment of new lofts that are opening. An example of these trends is the [[Westin Book-Cadillac Hotel]]. In 2006, the Cleveland-based Ferchill Group began the $180 million redevelopment of the historic Book Cadlliac Hotel at the corner of Washington Blvd. and Michigan Avenue. The project, which has been hailed by preservationists houses a 455-room Westin Hotel, 67 high-end condominiums, and two to three restaurants, and some miscellaneous retail serving hotel and conference center guests. [[DTE Energy Headquarters]] features an urban oasis of parks, walkways, and a reflecting pool.<ref name=DTE>[http://www.downtowndetroit.org/ddp/newsroom/detroit_news_july_4_2007.htm July 4, 2007 Detroit News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928034741/http://www.downtowndetroit.org/ddp/newsroom/detroit_news_july_4_2007.htm |date=September 28, 2007 }} ''Downtown Detroit Partnership''</ref>

{{clear}}

Throughout the late 2010s, a large amount of business and investment have continued to enter the city and transform it. As of 2019, businesses such as [[Shinola (retail company)|Shinola]], [[Google]], [[Moosejaw]], and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] occupy the once-vacant street fronts. Investments such as new bike lanes, the [[Little Caesars Arena]] and [[QLine]] have been successful in attracting newcomers to the city. Downtown’s transformation in recent years has also perpetuated the discussion of [[gentrification]] within the city. The downtown area is notably wealthier than other parts of the city, and has attracted a new demographic of white, middle class tourists and residents, physically and culturally displacing the black residents of the inner city. The ever-increasing lack of affordable housing and venues for locals have further contributed to this displacement.<ref>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/problem-with-rebuilding-detroit-michigan-ford-gentrification-cities_n_5ae31cffe4b02baed1b991c9</ref> It is an ongoing debate whether or not this redevelopment is good for the downtown area and Detroit as a whole.
