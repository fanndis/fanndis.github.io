'''Research and development''' ('''R&D''', '''R+D'''), known in [[Europe]] as '''research and technological development''' ('''RTD'''), is the set of innovative activities undertaken by corporations or governments in developing new services or products and improving existing ones.<ref name="investopedia">{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp|title=Research And Development – R&D|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2003-11-25|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Research]] and development constitutes the first stage of development of a potential new service or the production process.

R&D activities differ from institution to institution, with two primary models<ref name="investopedia"/> of an R&D department either staffed by [[engineers]] and tasked with directly [[new product development|developing new products]], or staffed with [[applied science|industrial scientists]] and tasked with [[applied research]] in scientific or technological fields, which may facilitate future product development. R&D differs from the vast majority of corporate activities in that it is not intended to yield immediate profit, and generally carries greater risk and an uncertain [[return on investment]]. However R&D is crucial for acquiring larger shares of the market through the marketisation of new products.<ref name="investopedia"/>

==Background==
New product design and development is often a crucial factor in the survival of a company. In a global industrial landscape that is changing fast, firms must continually revise their design and range of products. This is necessary as well due to the fierce competition and the evolving preferences of consumers. Without an R&D program, a firm must rely on [[strategic alliance]]s, [[acquisitions]], and networks to tap into the innovations of others.

A system driven by [[marketing]] is one that puts the customer needs first, and produces goods that are known to sell.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1998/11/business-marketing-understand-what-customers-value|title=Business Marketing: Understand What Customers Value|last1=Anderson|first1=James C.|date=1998-11-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2019-02-06|last2=Narus|first2=James A.|issue=November-December 1998|issn=0017-8012}}</ref> [[Market research]] is carried out, which establishes the needs of consumers and the potential [[niche market]] of a new product. If the development is technology driven, R&D is directed toward developing products to meet the unmet needs.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

In general, research and development activities are conducted by specialized units or centers belonging to a company, or can be [[out-sourced]] to a contract research organization, [[universities]], or [[sovereign state|state]] agencies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hackernoon.com/how-remote-randd-helps-accelerate-the-pace-of-innovation-wi3w381f|title=How Remote R&D Helps Accelerate the Pace of Innovation
|last=HackerNoon|website=HackerNoon|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref> In the context of [[commerce]], "research and development" normally refers to future-oriented, longer-term activities in [[science]] or [[technology]], using similar techniques to scientific research but directed toward desired outcomes and with broad forecasts of commercial yield.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chartsbin.com/view/41854|title=Research and Development Employees by Country|last=ChartsBin|website=ChartsBin|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref>

[[Statistics]] on organizations devoted to "R&D" may express the state of an [[Industry (economics)|industry]], the degree of [[competition]] or the lure of [[scientific progress|progress]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fax-DwAAQBAJ&q=Statistics+on+organizations+devoted+to+%22R&pg=PT659|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|date=2018-09-03|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498723459|language=en}}</ref> Some common measures include: [[budget]]s, numbers of [[patent]]s or on rates of peer-reviewed [[publication]]s. Bank ratios are one of the best measures, because they are continuously maintained, public and reflect risk.

In the United States, a typical ratio of research and development for an industrial company is about 3.5% of revenues; this measure is called "[[R&D intensity]]".{{cn|date=March 2017}} A [[high technology]] company, such as a computer manufacturer, might spend 7% or a [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] such as [[Merck & Co.]] 14.1% or [[Novartis]] 15.1%. Anything over 15% is remarkable, and usually gains a reputation for being a high technology company such as  engineering company [[Ericsson]] 24.9%, or [[biotech]] company [[Allergan]], which tops the spending table with 43.4% investment.<ref name="fn_2"> All figures [http://www.innovation.gov.uk/rd_scoreboard/ UK R&D Scoreboard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027005836/http://www.innovation.gov.uk/rd_scoreboard/ |date=2005-10-27 }} {{As of|2006|lc=on}}.</ref> Such companies are often seen as [[credit risk]]s because their spending ratios are so unusual.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

Generally such firms prosper only in markets whose customers have extreme high technology needs, like certain prescription drugs or special chemicals, [[scientific instrument]]s, and [[safety-critical system]]s in medicine, [[aeronautics]] or [[military weapons]]. {{cn|date=March 2017}}The extreme needs justify the high risk of failure and consequently high gross margins from 60% to 90% of revenues.{{cn|date=March 2017}} That is, [[gross profit]]s will be as much as 90% of the sales cost, with manufacturing costing only 10% of the product price, because so many individual projects yield no exploitable product. Most industrial companies get 40% revenues only.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

On a technical level, high tech organizations explore ways to re-purpose and repackage advanced technologies as a way of [[amortizing loan|amortizing]] the high overhead.{{cn|date=March 2017}} They often reuse advanced manufacturing processes, expensive safety certifications, specialized embedded software, computer-aided design software, electronic designs and mechanical subsystems.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

Research from 2000 has shown that firms with a persistent R&D strategy outperform those with an irregular or no R&D investment program.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0MGICwAAQBAJ&q=Research+from+2000+has+shown+that+firms+with+a+persistent+R&pg=PA286|title=The SAGE Handbook of Research Management|last1=Dingwall|first1=Robert|last2=McDonnell|first2=Mary Byrne|date=2015-06-26|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781473914452|language=en}}</ref>

Research and development are very difficult to manage, since the defining feature of research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result. As a result, "higher R&D spending does not guarantee more creativity, higher profit or a greater market share".<ref>{{cite web|title=Aerospace and Defense: Inventing and Selling the Next Generation|url=http://csis.org/files/publication/090520_diig_aerospace.pdf|website=Center for Strategic and International Studies|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies, International Security Program|access-date=6 August 2017|pages=1|language=en|date=December 5, 2009}}</ref> Research is the most risky financing area because both the development of an invention and its successful realization carries uncertainty including the profitability of the invention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://investor-partner.co.uk/business-dictionary/42/invention-finance |title=Investor-partner business partner finder Business dictionary}}</ref> One way entrepreneurs can reduce these uncertainties is to buy the licence for a franchise, so that the [[know-how]] is already incorporated in the licence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://investor-partner.co.uk/business-dictionary/41/know-how-finance |title=Investor-partner business partner finder Business dictionary}}</ref>

===Benefit by sector===
In general, it has been found that there is a positive [[correlation]] between the research and development and firm productivity across all sectors, but that this positive correlation is much stronger in high-tech firms than in low-tech firms.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ortega-Argiles |first1=Raquel |last2=Potters |first2=Lesley |last3=Vivarelli |first3=Marco |date=2011 |title=R&D and productivity: testing sectoral peculiarities using micro data |journal=Empirical Economics |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=817–839 |doi= 10.1007/s00181-010-0406-3|hdl=10419/35059 |s2cid=59130979 |hdl-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ortega-Argiles|first1=Raquel|last2=Piva|first2=Mariacristina|last3=Vivarelli|first3=Marco|author-link3=Marco Vivarelli|date=2011|title=Productivity Gains from R&D Investment: Are High-Tech Sectors Still Ahead?|journal=IZA Discussion Papers|publisher=IZA|issue=5975|pages=1–22}}</ref> In research done by Francesco Crespi and Cristiano Antonelli, high-tech firms were found to have "virtuous" [[Matthew effect]]s while low-tech firms experienced "vicious" Matthew effects, meaning that high-tech firms were awarded subsidies on merit while low-tech firms most often were given subsidies based on name recognition, even if not put to good use.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crespi |first1=Francesco |last2=Antonelli |first2=Cristiano |date=2011 |title=Matthew Effects and R&D Subsidies: Knowledge Cumulability in High-Tech and Low-Tech Industries |journal=Working Papers |publisher=Università degli Studi Roma Tre |issue=140 |pages=1–24 }}</ref>  While the strength of the correlation between R&D spending and productivity in low-tech industries is less than in high-tech industries, studies have been done showing non-trivial carryover effects to other parts of the marketplace by low-tech R&D.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mendonca |first=Sandro |date=2009 |title=Brave Old World: Accounting for 'High-Tech' Knowledge in 'Low-Tech' Industries |journal=Research Policy |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=470–482 |doi= 10.1016/j.respol.2008.10.018}}</ref>

===Risks===
Business R&D is risky for at least two reasons. The first source of risks comes from R&D nature, where R&D project could fail without residual values. The second source of risks comes from takeover risks, which means R&D is appealing to bidders because they could gain technologies from acquisition targets.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bena |first1=Jan |last2=Kai |first2=Li |date=2014|title=Corporate innovations and mergers and acquisitions.|journal=The Journal of Finance |volume=69 |issue=5|pages=1923–1960|doi=10.1111/jofi.12059 |hdl=10.1111/jofi.12059 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> Therefore, firms may gain R&D profit that co-moves with takeover waves, causing risks to the company which engages in R&D activity.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.2308/accr-51270|title=The R&D Premium and Takeover Risk|journal=The Accounting Review|volume=91|issue=3|pages=955–971|year=2016|last1=Lin|first1=Ji-Chai|last2=Wang|first2=Yanzhi (Andrew)}}</ref>

===Global===
[[Global R&D management]] is the discipline of designing and leading R&D processes globally, across cultural and lingual settings, and the transfer of knowledge across international corporate networks.<ref>Chiesa, V. (2001). R&D Strategy and Organisation, Imperial College Press</ref>
