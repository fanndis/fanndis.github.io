'''Notes'''

* <sup>1</sup> <small>The first [[WTA Premier tournaments|Premier 5]] event of the year has switched back and forth between the [[Dubai Tennis Championships]] and the [[Qatar Ladies Open|Qatar Open]] since 2009. Dubai was classified as a Premier 5 event from 2009 to 2011 before being succeeded by Doha for the 2012–2014 period. In 2015, Dubai regained its Premier 5 status while Doha was demoted to Premier status. The two tournaments have since alternated status every year.</small>
