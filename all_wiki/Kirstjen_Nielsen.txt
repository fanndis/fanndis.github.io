On June 20, 2018, after repeatedly arguing that the administration could not sign an executive order to end family separations, she was present at Trump's signing of an executive order ending his "zero-tolerance" policy of separating of children from families.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opb.org/news/article/npr-speaker-ryan-plans-immigration-votes-amid-doubts-that-bills-can-pass/|title=Trump Signs Order To End His Family Separations Policy|last=Long|first=Jill Colvin and Colleeen|website=opb.org|access-date=June 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620191608/https://www.opb.org/news/article/npr-speaker-ryan-plans-immigration-votes-amid-doubts-that-bills-can-pass/|archive-date=June 20, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=":8" /> Sources told ''Politico'' that Nielsen had privately pushed for this executive order behind the scenes while at the same time saying publicly that the executive order could not be created.<ref name=":8" />

In September 2018, ''[[The Intercept]]'' reported that Nielsen had previously personally authorized the family separation policy after receiving an April 23, 2018, memo by the heads of three federal immigration agencies (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement) recommending the family separation policy for the express purpose of deterring migration. At the time of the report, Nielsen had avoided attributing deterrence as the purpose of the policy.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Currier |first1=Cora |title=Prosecuting parents — and separating families — was meant to deter migration, signed memo confirms |url=https://theintercept.com/2018/09/25/family-separation-border-crossings-zero-tolerance/ |website=[[The Intercept]] |accessdate=April 8, 2019 |archive-date=November 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114230006/https://theintercept.com/2018/09/25/family-separation-border-crossings-zero-tolerance/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2019, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) wrote in a letter to FBI director Christopher A.

==== Border incidents ====
During Nielsen's tenure, several incidents at the U.S.–Mexico border between law enforcement and migrants seeking passage attracted international attention and prompted criticism of the Trump administration's approach towards enforcement.

===== Border agents' use of tear gas =====
On Sunday, November 25, 2018, there was an incident at the [[San Ysidro Port of Entry]] between California and Mexico. Groups of [[Central American migrant caravans]] tried to forcibly cross the border into the United States. Some of them threw rocks at [[United States Border Patrol|U.S. Border Patrol]] agents, who responded by firing tear gas into the crowd which included families with small children.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-border-patrol-uses-tear-gas-to-disperse-migrant-caravan-1543244902|title=U.S. Border Patrol Uses Tear Gas to Disperse Migrant Caravan|last1=Montes|first1=Juan|last2=Perez|first2=Santiago|date=November 26, 2018|website=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=December 30, 2018|last3=Whelan|first3=Robbie|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114230023/https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-border-patrol-uses-tear-gas-to-disperse-migrant-caravan-1543244902|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/26/18112474/tear-gas-border-patrol-caravan-rocks|title=How a march at the US-Mexico border descended into tear gas and chaos|last=Lind|first=Dara|date=November 26, 2018|website=Vox|access-date=December 30, 2018|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114230025/https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/26/18112474/tear-gas-border-patrol-caravan-rocks|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/world/americas/tijuana-mexico-border.html|title=Migrants in Tijuana Run to U.S. Border, but Fall Back in Face of Tear Gas|last1=Averbuch|first1=Maya|date=November 25, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 30, 2018|last2=Malkin|first2=Elisabeth|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114230007/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/world/americas/tijuana-mexico-border.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The use of tear gas in this situation was strongly criticized.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/world/americas/tear-gas-border.html|title=Border Agents Shot Tear Gas into Mexico.
