A Congressional bipartisan report in December 2008<ref name="bipartisan-report-2008"/> established that:

<blockquote>harsh interrogation techniques used by the CIA and the U.S. military were directly adapted from the training techniques used to prepare special forces personnel to resist interrogation by enemies that torture and abuse prisoners.

These include:

#[[Waterboarding]]: The prisoner is bound to a [[Trendelenburg position|declined board]], feet raised and head slightly below the feet. Material is wrapped over the prisoner's face and water is poured over them, [[asphyxiating]] the prisoner.
#[[Hypothermia#Water|Hypothermia]]: The prisoner is left to stand naked in a cell kept near {{convert|50|F}}, while being regularly doused with cold water in order to increase the rate at which heat is lost from the body.
#[[Stress positions]]: Prisoners are forced to stand, handcuffed and with their feet shackled to an eye bolt in the floor (and/or wall), for more than 40 hours, causing the prisoners' weight to be placed on just one or two muscles. This creates an intense amount of pressure on the legs, leading first to pain and then muscle failure.
#Abdomen strikes: A hard, open-handed slap is dealt to the prisoner's [[abdomen]]. Doctors consulted over the matter advised against using a punch, which could cause lasting internal damage.
#[[Slapping (strike)|Insult slap]]: An open-handed slap is delivered to the prisoner's face, aimed at causing pain and triggering fear.
#Shaking: The interrogator forcefully grabs the front of the prisoner's shirt and shakes him or her.
In December 2007, CIA director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] stated that "of about 100 prisoners held to date in the CIA program, the enhanced techniques were used on about 30, and waterboarding used on just three.".<ref name="Hayden">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/07/washington/07interrogate.html |title=Lawmakers Back Limits on Interrogation Tactics |first=Scott |last=Shane |author-link=Scott Shane |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 7, 2007 |accessdate=July 29, 2018 }}</ref><ref name="Hayden on videotapes">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/18/AR2008011803347.html |title=Lawyers for Detainee Refer In Filing to More CIA Tapes |first=Carol D. |last=Leonnig |author-link=Carol D.

{{Main|Defense Intelligence Agency}}

In 2003, the Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]]'s "Working Group" on interrogations requested that the DIA come up with prisoner interrogation techniques for the group's consideration. According to the 2008 [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee]] report on the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody, the DIA began drawing up the list of techniques with the help of its civilian employee, a former Guantanamo Interrogation Control Element (ICE) Chief David Becker. Becker claimed that the Working Group members were particularly interested in aggressive methods and that he "was encouraged to talk about techniques that inflict pain."<ref name="scasreport">{{cite report |work=[[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services]] |url=http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf |title=Inquiry into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021194943/http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf |archive-date=October 21, 2013 |date=November 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=July 30, 2018 }}</ref>{{rp|111}}

It is unknown to what extent the agency's recommendations were used or for how long, but according to the same Senate report, the list drawn up by DIA included the use of "drugs such as sodium pentothal and demerol", humiliating treatment using female interrogators and sleep deprivation. Becker claimed that he recommended the use of drugs due to rumors that another intelligence agency, name of which was redacted in the Senate report, had successfully used them in the past.<ref name="scasreport" />{{rp|112}} According to the analysis of the [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Office of Defense Inspector General]], the DIA's cited justification for the use of drugs was to "[relax] detainee to cooperative state" and that mind-altering substances were not used.<ref>{{cite report |work=[[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Deputy Inspector General for Intelligence]] |url=http://www.dodig.mil/FOIA/ERR/09-INTEL-13_Redacted.pdf |title=Investigation of Allegations of the Use of Mind-Altering Drugs to Facilitate Interrogations of Detainees |date=September 23, 2009 |page=10 |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222051033/http://www.dodig.mil/FOIA/ERR/09-INTEL-13_Redacted.pdf }}</ref>

Some more lurid revelations of DIA's alleged harsh interrogations came from [[FBI]] officers, who conducted their own screenings of detainees in [[Guantanamo]] along with other agencies. According to one account, the interrogators of what was then DIA's Defense HUMINT Service (currently the [[Defense Clandestine Service]]), forced subjects to watch [[gay porn]], draped them with the [[Flag of Israel|Israeli Flag]] and interrogated them in rooms lit by [[strobe light]]s for 16–18 hours, all the while telling prisoners that they were from the FBI.<ref name="aclu.org">{{cite web |work=[[American Civil Liberties Union]] |url=https://www.aclu.org/files/projects/foiasearch/pdf/DOJFBI003584.pdf |title=Email &#91;parties redacted&#93; re: GTMO |date=2004 }}</ref><ref name="LAT-Miller">{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-feb-24-na-abuse24-story.html |title=E-Mails Show FBI Agents Fretted About Prisoner Abuse |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 24, 2006 |first=Greg |last=Miller |accessdate=July 30, 2018 }}</ref>

The real FBI operative was concerned that DIA's harsh methods and impersonation of FBI agents would complicate the Bureau's ability to do its job properly, saying "The next time a real Agent tries to talk to that guy, you can imagine the result."<ref name="aclu.org"/> A subsequent military inquiry countered FBI's allegations by saying that the prisoner treatment was degrading but not inhuman, without addressing the allegation of DIA staff regularly impersonating FBI officers - usually a [[felony]] offense.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Neil |author-link=Neil Lewis (journalist) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/14/politics/14gitmo.html |title=Report Discredits F.B.I.

Similar activities are thought to have transpired at the hands of DIA operatives in [[Bagram]], where as recently as 2010 the organization ran the so-called "[[Black jail]]". According to a report published by [[The Atlantic]], the jail was manned by DIA's [[DCHC]] staff, who were accused of beating and sexually humiliating high-value targets held at the site.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ambinder |first=Marc |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/05/inside-the-secret-interrogation-facility-at-bagram/56678/ |title=Inside the Secret Interrogation Facility at Bagram |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2018 }}</ref> The detention center outlived the black sites ran by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], with the DIA allegedly continuing to use "restricted" interrogation methods in the facility under a secret authorization.

In November 2006, former [[U.S. Army]] [[Brigadier General]] [[Janis Karpinski]], in charge of [[Abu Ghraib prison]] until early 2004, told Spain's ''[[El País]]'' newspaper she had seen a letter signed by [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] that allowed contractors employed by the U.S. to use techniques such as [[sleep deprivation]] during interrogation.'" The methods consisted of making prisoners stand for long periods, sleep deprivation ... playing music at full volume, having to sit uncomfortably ... Rumsfeld authorized these specific techniques." She said that this was contrary to the [[Geneva Conventions]] and quoted the Geneva Convention as saying, "Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind." According to Karpinski, the handwritten signature was above his printed name and in the same handwriting in the margin was written, "Make sure this is accomplished."<ref>{{cite news |first=Diane |last=Bartz |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-rumsfeld/rumsfeld-okayed-abuses-says-former-u-s-general-idUSL2572641320061125 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=January 20, 2007 |title=Rumsfeld okayed abuses says former U.S. general |accessdate=July 27, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Samira |last=Simone |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/US/04/22/us.torture.karpinski/index.html |work=[[CNN]] |date=April 22, 2009 |title=Abu Ghraib head finds vindication in newly released memos |accessdate=July 27, 2018 }}</ref>

In 2006, senior [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] agents with the [[Criminal Investigation Task Force]] told [[MSNBC.com]] that they began to complain in 2002 inside the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] that the interrogation tactics used in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] by a separate team of [[military intelligence]] investigators were unproductive, not likely to produce reliable information, and probably illegal. Unable to get satisfaction from the army commanders running the detainee camp, they took their concerns to [[David Brant]], director of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] (NCIS), who alerted Navy General Counsel [[Alberto J.

General Counsel Mora and Navy Judge Advocate General [[Michael Lohr]] believed the detainee treatment to be unlawful, and campaigned among other top lawyers and officials in the Defense Department to investigate, and to provide clear standards prohibiting coercive interrogation tactics.<ref name="newyorker.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/memorandum-navy-general-counsel-alberto-j-mora-navy-inspector-general-july-7-2004 |title=Memorandum for Inspector General, Department of the Navy.

The working group's final report was signed and delivered to Guantánamo without the knowledge of Mora and the others who had opposed its content.

=====2015 review=====
On request by the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Susan Rice]] in 2015, the CIA compiled a summary of key intelligence, which according to their records had been collected after the application of (unspecified) interrogation techniques. The memorandum lists intelligence related to the following topics: The Karachi Plot, The Heathrow Plot, The "Second Wave", The Guraba Cell, Issa al-Hindi, Abu Talha al-Pakistani, [[Riduan Isamuddin|Hambali's Capture]], Jafaar al-Tayyar, [[Dirty bomb#Possibility of terrorist groups using dirty bombs|Dirty Bomb Plot]], [[Shoe bomber]], and Sh(a)kai (Pakistan).

===International Committee of the Red Cross report===
On March 15, 2009, [[Mark Danner]] provided a report in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' (with an abridged version in ''The New York Times'') describing and commenting on the contents of a report by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC), ''Report on the Treatment of Fourteen "High Value Detainees" in CIA Custody'' (43&nbsp;pp., February 2007). ''Report...'' is a record of interviews with [[black site]] detainees, conducted between October 6 and 11 and December 4 and 14, 2006, after their transfer to Guantánamo.<ref name="ICRC report">{{cite news |url=http://www.nybooks.com/icrc-report.pdf |title=ICRC Report on the Treatment of Fourteen "High Value Detainees" in CIA Custody |work=International Committee of the Red Cross, Regional Delegation for United States and Canada |date=February 14, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22530 |title=US Torture: Voices from the Black Sites |first=Mark |last=Danner |work=[[New York Review of Books]] |date=April 9, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/opinion/15danner.html |title=Tales from Torture's Dark World |first=Mark |last=Danner |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 15, 2009}}</ref> (According to Danner, the report was marked "confidential" and was not previously made public before being made available to him.)

Danner provides excerpts of interviews with detainees, including Abu Zubaydah, [[Walid bin Attash]], and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. According to Danner, the report contains sections on "methods of ill-treatment" including suffocation by water, prolonged stress standing, beatings by use of a collar, beating and kicking, confinement in a box, prolonged nudity, sleep deprivation and use of loud music, exposure to cold temperature/cold water, prolonged use of handcuffs and shackles, threats, forced shaving, and deprivation/restricted provision of solid food. Danner quotes the ICRC report as saying that, "in many cases, the ill-treatment to which they were subjected while held in the CIA program, either singly or in combination, constituted torture. In addition, many other elements of the ill-treatment, either singly or in combination, constituted cruel, [[inhuman or degrading treatment]]."<ref name="ICRC report"/>

A heavily redacted version of the November 8, 2006 meeting was released by the CIA on June 10, 2016. The report tells that the ICRC finds the detainees stories "largely credible, having put much stock in the fact that the story each detainee told about his transfer, treatment and conditions of confinement was basically consistent, even though they had been incommunicado with each other throughout their detention by us [the CIA]." <ref>{{cite report |author=John A Rizzo |editor= CIA|date=November 9, 2006 |title=November 8, 2006 meeting with ICRC reps |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/6552081 |docket=F-2015-02400 |access-date=June 15, 2016 }}</ref>

===Comparison to the Gestapo interrogation method called 'Verschärfte Vernehmung'===
''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' writer [[Andrew Sullivan]] has pointed out similarities between the [[Gestapo]] interrogation method called 'Verschärfte Vernehmung' and what the US called "enhanced interrogation".<ref name = "Verschärfte Vernehmung">{{cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Sullivan |url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/05/verschfte_verne.html |title=Verschärfte Vernehmung |work=[[The Atlantic Monthly]] |date=May 29, 2007 |accessdate=June 1, 2018}}</ref> He asserts the first use of a term comparable to "enhanced interrogation" was a 1937 memo by Gestapo Chief [[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]] coining the phrase "Verschärfte Vernehmung", German for "sharpened questioning", "intensified" or "enhanced interrogation" to describe subjection to extreme cold, sleep deprivation, suspension in stress positions, and deliberate exhaustion among other techniques.<ref name="Verschärfte Vernehmung"/> Sullivan reports that in 1948 Norway prosecuted German officials for what trial documents termed "Verschärfte Vernehmung" including subjection to cold water, and repeated beatings.<ref name="Verschärfte Vernehmung"/> Sullivan concludes:

<blockquote>The very phrase used by the president to describe torture-that-isn't-somehow-torture{{snd}}"enhanced interrogation techniques"{{snd}}is a term originally coined by the Nazis. The techniques are indistinguishable. The methods were clearly understood in 1948 as war-crimes. The punishment for them was death.<ref name="Verschärfte Vernehmung"/></blockquote>

===Effect on United States reputation===
Historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] in assessing the effect of the Bush torture program on the reputation of the United States in the world stated that the damage to U.S. reputation had been incalculable.

==Investigation and calls for prosecution==
===Request for special counsel probe===
On June 8, 2008, fifty-six House Democrats asked for an independent investigation, raising the possibility that authorising these techniques may constitute a crime by Bush administration officials. The congressmen involved in calling for such an investigation included [[John Conyers]], [[Jan Schakowsky]], and [[Jerrold Nadler]].<ref name="Probe">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/07/AR2008060701194.html |title=Lawmakers Urge Special Counsel Probe of Harsh Interrogation Tactics |first=Joby |last=Warrick |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 8, 2008 |accessdate=July 24, 2018 }}</ref>

The letter was addressed to [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Michael B. Mukasey]] observing that:

<blockquote>information indicates that the Bush administration may have systematically implemented, from the top down, detainee interrogation policies that constitute torture or otherwise violate the law. ... Because these apparent 'enhanced interrogation techniques' were used under cover of Justice Department legal opinions, the need for an outside special prosecutor is obvious.<ref name="Probe"/></blockquote>

According to ''The Washington Post'' the request was denied because Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey felt that "officials acted in 'good faith' when they sought legal opinions, and that the lawyers who provided them used their best judgment."<ref name="Carrie Johnson">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/10/AR2008071002749.html |title=Mukasey Rejects Inquiry |first=Carrie |last=Johnson |work=The Washington Post |date=July 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 24, 2020 }}</ref> The article also reported that "[h]e warned that criminalizing the process could cause policymakers to second-guess themselves and 'harm our national security well into the future.'"<ref name="Carrie Johnson"/>

===Binyam Mohamed case===
On February 4, 2009, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] of [[England and Wales]] ruled that evidence of possible torture in the case of [[Binyam Mohamed]], an Ethiopian-born British resident who was held in Guantanamo Bay until 2009, could not be disclosed to the public:

<blockquote>as a result of a statement by [[David Miliband]], the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], that if the evidence was disclosed the US would stop sharing intelligence with Britain. That would directly threaten the UK's national security, Miliband had told the court.<ref name="Preventing international investigation">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/04/guantanamo-torture/print |title=US threats mean evidence of British resident's Guantánamo torture must stay secret, judges rule Tory MP David Davis demands urgent Commons statement on MI5 role in Binyam Mohamed case |first=Richard |last=Norton-Taylor |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 4, 2009 |accessdate=January 24, 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://harpers.org/archive/2009/02/hbc-90004343 |title=Bush Administration Threatened Britain Over Torture Disclosures |first=Scott |last=Horton |work=[[Harper's Magazine]] |date= February 4, 2009 |accessdate=January 24, 2020 }}</ref></blockquote>

The judges said they found it "difficult to conceive" the rationale for the US's objections to releasing the information, which contained "no disclosure of sensitive intelligence matters". Adding, "we did not consider that a democracy governed by the rule of law would expect a court in another democracy to suppress a summary of the evidence contained in reports by its own officials".<ref name="Preventing international investigation"/>

Responding to the ruling, [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], the Conservative MP and former [[Shadow Home Secretary]], commented:

<blockquote>The ruling implies that torture has taken place in the <nowiki>[Binyam]</nowiki> Mohamed case, that British agencies may have been complicit, and further, that the United States government has threatened our high court that if it releases this information the US government will withdraw its intelligence cooperation with the United Kingdom.<ref name="Preventing international investigation"/></blockquote>

The High Court judges also stated in 2009, that a criminal investigation, by the UK's [[Law Officers of the Crown|Attorney General]], into possible torture had begun.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7870049.stm |title=Ministers face torture pressure |work=[[BBC News]] |date=February 4, 2009 |accessdate=August 5, 2018 }}</ref>

In February 2010, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|UK Court of Appeal]] ruled that material held by the UK Foreign Secretary must be made public.

The Bush administration told the CIA in 2002 that its interrogators working abroad would not violate US prohibitions against torture unless they "have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering", according to a previously secret [[US Justice Department]] memo released on July 24, 2008. The interrogator's "good faith" and "honest belief" that the interrogation will not cause such suffering protects the interrogator, the memo adds. "Because specific intent is an element of the offense, the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture", [[Jay Bybee]], then the [[Assistant Attorney General]], wrote in the memo, dated August 1, 2002, addressed to the CIA acting General Counsel [[John A. Rizzo]]. The initial release of 18-page memo was heavily redacted, with 10 of its 18 pages completely blacked out and only a few paragraphs visible on the others.

Another memo released on the same day advises that "the [[waterboarding|waterboard]]", does "not violate the Torture Statute." It also cites a number of warnings against torture, including statements by President Bush and a then-new Supreme Court ruling "which raises possible concerns about future US [[judicial review]] of the [interrogation] Program."

A third memo instructs interrogators to keep records of sessions in which "enhanced interrogation techniques" are used. The memo is signed by then-CIA director [[George Tenet]] and dated January 28, 2003.

The memos were made public by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], which obtained the three CIA-related documents under [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/24/cia.torture/index.html |title=Previously secret torture memo released |work=[[CNN]] |date=July 24, 2008 |accessdate=July 24, 2018 }}</ref> They were among nearly 140,000 formerly classified documents from the Department of Defense, the Justice Department, and the CIA that provide details on the treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody in the "War on Terror" gathered by the ACLU.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2012/04/george-w-bush-and-torture-americas-highest-officials-are-responsible-for-the-enhanced-interrogation-of-prisoners.html |title=How America Came To Torture Its Prisoners |date=April 20, 2012 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |author=Larry Siems}}</ref>

Following the release of the CIA documents, [[Philip Zelikow]], a former State Department lawyer and adviser to then-Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], said that in 2005, he had written a legal memo objecting to torture. In it he argued that it was unlikely that "any federal court would agree (that the approval of harsh interrogation techniques) ... was a reasonable interpretation of the Constitution." He claimed that the Bush Administration had ordered all copies of his legal memo be collected and destroyed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103396848 |title=Was Critical Note Muzzled By Bush White House? |work=[[NPR]] |date=April 23, 2009 |accessdate=July 24, 2018 |first=Scott |last=Neuman}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/04/21/the-olc-torture-memos-thoughts-from-a-dissenter/ |author-link=Philip Zelikow |first=Philip |last=Zelikow |title=The OLC "torture memos": thoughts from a dissenter |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=April 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 24, 2018 }}</ref>

On March 8, 2008, President Bush vetoed this bill.

<blockquote>Because the danger remains, we need to ensure our intelligence officials have all the tools they need to stop the terrorists", Bush said in his weekly radio address. "The bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the war on terror{{snd}}the CIA program to detain and question key terrorist leaders and operatives." Bush said that the methods used by the military are designed for interrogating "lawful combatants captured on the battlefield", not the "hardened terrorists" normally questioned by the CIA. "If we were to shut down this program and restrict the CIA to methods in the Field Manual, we could lose vital information from senior al Qaida terrorists, and that could cost American lives", Bush said.</blockquote>

[[Massachusetts]] senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] described Bush's veto as "one of the most shameful acts of his presidency". He said, "Unless Congress overrides the veto, it will go down in history as a flagrant insult to the rule of law and a serious stain on the good name of America in the eyes of the world."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/08/bush.torture.ap/index.html|title=Bush vetoes bill banning waterboarding}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN0736443620080308?sp=true|title=Bush vetoes bill outlawing CIA waterboarding|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|website=reuters.com|date=March 8, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/03/20080308.html |title=President's Radio Address |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311185628/http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/03/20080308.html |archive-date=March 11, 2008 |work=[[whitehouse.gov]] |date=March 8, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311020720/http://voanews.com/english/2008-03-08-voa10.cfm |archive-date=March 11, 2008 |url=http://voanews.com/english/2008-03-08-voa10.cfm |title=President Bush Vetoes Waterboarding Ban |accessdate=July 24, 2018 |first=Scott |last=Stearns }}</ref>

According to [[Jane Mayer]], during the transition period for then President-elect [[Barack Obama]], his legal, intelligence, and national-security advisers had met at the CIA's headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]] to discuss "whether a ban on brutal interrogation practices would hurt their ability to gather intelligence", and among the consulted experts:
