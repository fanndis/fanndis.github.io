Packed cars, buses, airplanes, and trains commuted protesters to the march. The large crowds enabled Washington's Subway to break 1,000,000 passengers for only the second time in its history. The 1,001,613 trips are the second busiest day, the highest counted total (as the highest, from Obama's First Inauguration is only an estimate) and the highest single-day ridership for a weekend day breaking the previous record of 825,437 trips set during the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]].

Ferrera stated, "If we – the millions of Americans who believe in common decency, in the greater good, in justice for all – if we fall into the trap by separating ourselves by our causes and our labels, then we will weaken our fight and we will lose.

Johansson called for long-term change: "Once the heaviness [of the election] began to subside, an opportunity has presented itself to make real long-term change, not just for future Americans, but in the way we view our responsibility to get involved with and stay active in our communities.

The youngest presenter at the Washington D.C. march, 6-year-old [[Sophie Cruz]], said, "Let us fight with love, faith, and courage so that our families will not be destroyed," and ended her speech saying, "I also want to tell the children not to be afraid, because we are not alone.

While the march aims to create a [[social movement]], [[Marcia Chatelain]] of [[Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching, & Service|Georgetown University's Center for Social Justice]] commented that its success will depend on the marchers' ability to maintain momentum in the following weeks. "One of the goals of any type of march or any type of visible sign of solidarity is to get inspired, to inspire people to do more. And the question is, at the march, what kind of organizational structures or movements will also be present to help people know how to channel their energy for the next day and for the long haul?"<ref name=":0"/> Historian [[Michael Kazin]] also commented on the importance of a long-term strategy: "All successful movements in American history have both inside and outside strategy.
