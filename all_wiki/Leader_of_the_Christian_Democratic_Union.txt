Reports at the time suggested that he joined the party when he became chairman, although his membership was backdated by three years. However, reports in 2007 suggested that Erhard never actually joined the CDU. The [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]], which holds the party archives, reported that the question could "not be answered conclusively."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kellerhoff|first1=Sven Felix|title=Der Kanzler, der nie Mitglied seiner Partei war|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article834316/Der-Kanzler-der-nie-Mitglied-seiner-Partei-war.html|newspaper=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=25 April 2018|date=25 April 2007}}</ref>}}
