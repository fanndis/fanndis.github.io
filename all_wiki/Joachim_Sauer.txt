'''Joachim Sauer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈjoːaxɪm ˈzaʊ̯ɐ}}, born 19 April 1949) is a German [[quantum chemistry|quantum chemist]] and professor emeritus of [[physical chemistry|physical]] and [[theoretical chemistry]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. He is the husband of the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|chancellor of Germany]], [[Angela Merkel]]. He is one of the seven members of the board of trustees of the [[Friede Springer]] Foundation, together with former German president [[Horst Köhler]] and others.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.friedespringerstiftung.de | title=Friede Springer Stiftung}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chemie.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/quantenchemie/Group/js-1|title=Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.

== Education and early life ==
[[File:Joachim Sauer.jpg|thumb|Sauer in 2009|right]]

Joachim Sauer was born in [[Hosena]], a small town in the marshy [[Lower Lusatia|Lusatian]] countryside between [[Dresden]] and [[Cottbus]]. He grew up with his twin sister and an elder brother.  His father, Richard Sauer, had trained as a confectioner, but worked as an insurance representative. Sauer excelled at school and it quickly became clear that he had both the ability and the ambition to achieve more than this in his own life.<ref name=JSlautMH>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45168927.html |title=Das Phantom|magazine=Joachim Sauer ist der erste Kanzleringatte Deutschlands.

Zur Person von Joachim Sauer|url =https://www.bunte.de/starprofile/joachim-sauer.html|publisher=BUNTE Entertainment Verlag GmbH, München|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>

== Career and research ==
Sauer studied chemistry from 1967 to 1972 at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] and was awarded a [[doctorate]] in chemistry in 1974. He continued to do research there until 1977, when he joined the Academy of Sciences, Central Institute of Physical Chemistry in Berlin, one of the leading scientific institutes of the former [[East Germany|GDR]] (East Germany)

For a brief time during and after the [[German reunification]] (1990–1991) he was the deputy technical director (catalysis and sorption) for BIOSYM Technologies, San Diego/USA (now [[BIOVIA]]). He remained an advisor for BIOSYM until 2002.

In 1992, he joined the [[Max Planck Society]] as head of the Quantum Chemistry Group in Berlin. In 1993, he became full professor of physical and theoretical chemistry at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. He retired from his chair in October 2017 and was succeeded by Martin Schütz, who died the following year. Sauer remains affiliated with the university as a senior research fellow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/wissen/interview-mit-joachim-sauer-nobelpreise-sind-nicht-alles-29338036|title=Interview mit Joachim Sauer: Nobelpreise sind nicht alles|first1=Juliane|last1=Meißner|first2=Torsten|last2=Harmsen|date=23 December 2017|website=Berliner Zeitung}}</ref>

He is an active research scientist in quantum chemistry and computational chemistry. His computational studies have allowed for a better understanding of the structures and activities of some [[catalysts]] such as [[zeolites]], specifically their acid sites,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sauer, J|first=Haase, F|title=Interaction of Methanol With Bronsted Acid Sites Of Zeolite Catalysts - An Ab-Initio Study|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=5 Apr 1995|volume=117|issue=13|pages=3780–3789|doi=10.1021/Ja00118A014}}</ref>  as well as the interpretation of solid state [[NMR]] spectra of nucleus Si-29, and quadrupolar nuclei such as Na-23,<ref name=Koller-1994>{{cite journal|author=Koller, H.|author2=Engelhardt, G. |author3=Kentgens, A.P.M. |author4=Sauer, J. |title=Na-23 Nmr-Spectroscopy of Solids - Interpretation of Quadrupole Interaction Parameters and Chemical-Shifts|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry|date=1994|volume=98|issue=6|pages=1544–1551|doi=10.1021/j100057a004}}</ref>  Al-27 and O-17.<ref name=Bull-1998>{{cite journal|last=Bull Lucy, M.|first=Dupree, R. |author2=Cheetham, AK |author3=Anupold, T |author4=Reinhold, A |author5=Samoson, A |author6=Sauer, J |author7=Bussemer, B |author8=Lee, Y |author9=Gann, S |author10=Shore, J |author11=Pines, A|title=A high-resolution(17)O NMR study of siliceous zeolite faujasite|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date= 1998|volume=120|issue=14|pages=3510–3511|doi=10.1021/ja9743001}}</ref><ref name=Bull-2000>{{cite journal|last=Bull, Lucy M|first=Dupree, R|author2=Bussemer, B |author3=Anupold, T |author4=Reinhold, A |author5=Samoson, A |author6=Sauer, J |author7= Cheetham, AK |title=A high-resolution O-17 and Si-29 NMR study of zeolite siliceous ferrierite and ab initio calculations of NMR parameters|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=2000|volume=122|issue=20|pages=4948–4958|doi=10.1021/ja993339y}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
From his previous marriage to a fellow chemist, Sauer has two sons: Daniel and Adrian. On 30 December 1998, he married [[Angela Merkel]] (herself a doctor of physics who had once worked in quantum chemistry research) who later became the chairwoman of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]]. When Merkel became the first female [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|chancellor of Germany]] on 22 November 2005, Sauer became the first second gentleman of Germany.

Because of his wife's political career, Sauer has received far more media attention than is usual for a research scientist. On several occasions he has stated that he is not fond of this publicity.

During the 2005 election campaign Joachim Sauer kept a very low profile, declining to give any interviews not related to his scientific work. He attended the [[Bayreuth Festival]], an opera festival and a highly visible social event in Germany, with his wife.<ref name=Phantom>{{cite news | first=David | last=Crossland | title=Merkel's Phantom of the Opera | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,386384,00.html | newspaper=[[Der Spiegel#Spiegel Online|Spiegel Online]] | date=2005-11-22 | accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> Sauer is known as a great lover of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] music.

Even during his wife's election in the [[Bundestag]], her [[inauguration]], and later her taking the oath of office, Sauer was not present but reportedly briefly followed the event on TV from his university chemistry lab.<ref name=QuantumLeap>{{cite news | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | title=The Professor's Quantum Leap | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/07/AR2007060702139.html | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=2007-06-08 | accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref>
