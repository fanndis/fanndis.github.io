==History and profile==
The founding meeting for ''Vårt Land'' was summoned on 28 September 1944, but the first edition was not published until 31 August 1945, with Bjarne Høye as the general editor and John Nome responsible for "spiritual and church-related matters."  The newspaper was initially published as a section in ''[[Morgenbladet]]'', was subsequently issued as a standalone broadsheet paper, and in 1968 went to a tabloid format. It is owned by Mentor Medier (former [[Mediehuset Vårt Land]]), which also owns several related media properties. ''Vårt Land'' includes editorial material written in both [[Bokmål]] and [[Nynorsk]]. The offices of the newspaper have moved many times. In 1983 the newspaper moved its offices to Tveita in Oslo and it was one of the first Norwegian newspapers to use digital technology daily. It is now based in downtown Oslo.

The acting chief editor is Alf Gjøsund. ''Vårt Land'' has been published on the internet since 1996. Today, ''Vårt Land'' is not only a newspaper, but a part of a media house called Mentor Medier (former Mediehuset Vårt Land).

''Vårt Land'' is an opinion paper.<ref name=sigurd/> It has a moderate [[Christianity|Christian]] stance in religious matters and a [[social-liberal]] leaning in political matters.<ref name=sigurd>{{cite journal|author=Sigurd Allern|title=Journalistic and Commercial News Values.
