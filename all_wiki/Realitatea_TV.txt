== History ==

Realitatea TV started broadcasting in 2001, as a general-profile TV station. However, it began broadcasting hourly newscasts and soon changed its format, becoming the first news television in [[Romania]]. Prigoană brought [[Ion Cristoiu]] to supervise the channel and rise its audience.

In 2004 [[Silviu Prigoană]] sold the network to an Italian company that later sold it to [[Petrom]], which subsequently lost it to [[Sorin Ovidiu Vântu]], sometime in 2006. Vântu was occasionally accused of using his television to manipulate public opinion against President [[Traian Băsescu|Băsescu]] and his party. After the channel went into insolvency in 2011, Vântu sold it to businessman [[Elan Schwarzenberg]], while the management of the media group was under the control of [[Sebastian Ghiță]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://economie.hotnews.ro/stiri-media_publicitate-8570052-impactnews-sustine-sorin-ovidiu-vantu-anunta-luni-predarea-trustului-realitatea-catavencu-lui-elan-schwartzenberg-sebastian-ghita-nu-cunosc-notiunea-predare.htm|title=Elan Schwartzenberg a confirmat ca a cumparat 92% din trustul Realitatea * Sebastian Ghita: "Am resursele financiare si energia psihica sa duc acest contract pana la capat indiferent de cine este proprietar"|date=2011-04-30|website=Hotnews.ro}}</ref>
