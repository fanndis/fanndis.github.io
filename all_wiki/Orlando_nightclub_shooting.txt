On {{nowrap|June 12}}, 2016, [[Omar Mateen]], a 29-year-old, killed 49 people and wounded 53 more in a [[mass shooting]] inside [[Pulse nightclub|Pulse]], a [[gay bar|gay nightclub]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], United States. Orlando Police officers shot and killed him after a three-hour standoff.

In a [[9-1-1]] call made shortly after the shooting began, Mateen [[Bay'ah|swore allegiance]] to the leader of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], and said the U.S. killing of [[Abu Waheeb]] in Iraq the previous month “triggered” the shooting. He later told a negotiator he was “out here right now” because of the American-led interventions [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|in Iraq]] and [[American-led intervention in Syria|in Syria]] and that the negotiator should tell the United States to stop the bombing. The incident was deemed a [[terrorist attack]] by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigators.

Pulse was hosting a “Latin Night”, and most of the victims were [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]]. It is the deadliest incident in the [[history of violence against LGBT people in the United States]] and the deadliest terrorist attack in the U.S. since the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. At the time, it was the deadliest [[mass shootings in the United States|mass shooting]] by a single gunman in U.S. history; this would be surpassed the following year by the 2017 [[Las Vegas shooting]].

After the shooting, the psychologist who reportedly evaluated and cleared Mateen for his firearms license in 2007 by G4S records denied ever meeting him or having lived in Florida at the time, and said she had stopped her practice in Florida since January 2006. G4S admitted Mateen's form had a "clerical error" and clarified that he had instead been cleared by another psychologist from the same firm that bought the wrongly-named doctor's practice. This doctor had not interviewed Mateen, but evaluated the results of a standard test used in the screening he undertook before being hired.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ovalle |first=David |date=June 17, 2016 |title='Clerical error' on Orlando killer's psychological eval named wrong doctor |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article84490302.html |work=The Miami Herald |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619144733/http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article84490302.html |archivedate=June 19, 2016}}</ref> G4S was subsequently fined for lapses in its psychological testing program (see [[#Aftermath|below]]).

In 2009, Mateen married his first wife, who left him after a few months; the couple's divorce became final in 2011.

Mateen became a [[person of interest]] to the FBI in May 2013 and July 2014.

According to new documents released on {{nowrap|July 18}}, Mateen said that he made these comments in response to "a lot of harassment" and frequent derogatory epithets made by St. Lucie County Sheriff's deputies and his G4S coworkers, who taunted and made jokes about him being a possible Muslim extremist.<ref name="New2013MateenTaunts">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line--> |title=Docs: Pulse gunman Omar Mateen taunted at job for being Muslim |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/docs-pulse-gunman-omar-mateen-taunted-at-job-for-being-muslim/ |work=CBS News |date=July 18, 2016 |access-date=July 20, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719134521/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/docs-pulse-gunman-omar-mateen-taunted-at-job-for-being-muslim/ |archivedate=July 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name="YahooNoGoPostal">{{cite news |last=Walsh |first=Michael |date=July 19, 2016 |title=FBI did not think Orlando shooter Omar Mateen would 'go postal' in 2013 |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/fbi-did-not-think-orlando-shooter-omar-mateen-would-go-postal-in-2013-170929145.html |work=Yahoo!

A little over a month after the shooting, the FBI provided more details about its May 2013–March 2014 investigation into Mateen, which was closed after a veteran FBI agent assigned to the case and his supervisor concluded that "there was just nothing there" and removed his name from the Terrorist Watchlist. Mateen was interviewed twice during the investigation, and had provided a written statement in which he confessed that he had previously lied to FBI investigators. During the investigation, the FBI had tracked his daily routine using unmarked vehicles, closely examined his phone records, and used two informants to secretly record his face-to-face conversations. The FBI Director said that they could have taken more initiative in gaining access to his social media accounts in 2013, but noted that back then such checks were not yet "part of [their] investigative DNA". However, it would not have mattered, as the analysis of Mateen's computer after the shooting showed that his social media accounts, including Facebook, had no ties to any terrorist groups, and that he did not post any "radical statements" until the early morning of the shooting. The FBI in 2013 also did not have the [[probable cause]] needed to obtain a search warrant in order to secretly listen to his phone calls or probe into Mateen's computer.<ref name="PastFBI2013">{{cite news |last=Wilber |first=Del Quentin |date=July 14, 2016 |title=The FBI investigated the Orlando mass shooter for 10 months — and found nothing.

===Progress===
In July 2016, law enforcement officials reported that the FBI—after conducting "interviews and an examination of his computer and other electronic media"—has not found any evidence that Mateen targeted Pulse because the nightclub was a venue for gays or whether the attack was motivated by homophobia. According to witnesses, he did not make any homophobic comments during the shooting. Also, nothing has been found that confirms the speculation that he was gay and used gay dating apps; however, the FBI "has found evidence that Mateen was cheating on his wife with other women". Officials noted that "there is nothing to suggest that he attempted to cover up his tracks by deleting files".

At the request of John Mina, the Orlando chief of police, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Community Oriented Policing Services]] (COPS) conducted a third-party "after-action assessment" of the Orlando Police Department's response to the shooting and its overall preparedness.<ref>{{cite news |last=Harris |first=David |date=July 9, 2016 |title=Chief Mina asks for DOJ's help to find group to conduct review into Pulse shooting |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/pulse-orlando-nightclub-shooting/os-pulse-shooting-mina-interview-20160708-story.html |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |access-date=July 11, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710152354/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/pulse-orlando-nightclub-shooting/os-pulse-shooting-mina-interview-20160708-story.html |archivedate=July 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Helsel |first=Phil |date=July 17, 2016 |title=Justice Department to Review Police Response to Pulse Nightclub Shooting |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/orlando-nightclub-massacre/justice-department-review-police-response-pulse-nightclub-shooting-n611031 |publisher=NBC News |access-date=July 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717055452/http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/orlando-nightclub-massacre/justice-department-review-police-response-pulse-nightclub-shooting-n611031 |archivedate=July 17, 2016}}</ref> COPS commissioned the [[Police Foundation]] to prepare the report, which was released in December 2017.

However, as the incident became more complex and prolonged, transitioning from a barricaded suspect with hostages to an act of terrorism, the OPD's operational tactics and strategies were challenged by the increasing threat posed by the suspect's claim of improvised explosive devices inside the club and in vehicles surrounding the club."<ref name=Lotan/> The report authors noted that they lacked access to FBI reports and other data about the crime scene and shooter, and did not have information about "potential law enforcement friendly fire."<ref name=Lotan/>

In April 2017, the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' obtained a copy of a 78-page presentation given by Mina to some ten police groups located around the world, which discussed the OPD's response to the attack and what it has learned. The presentation offered a comprehensive timeline of the attack and included diagrams and still photos from [[body camera]] footage showing officers in their initial confrontation with Mateen. According to the presentation, 500 interviews were conducted, 1,600 leads were followed up on, more than 950 pieces of evidence were collected, and more than 300 people were subpoenaed.<ref name=orlandosentinel1/>
