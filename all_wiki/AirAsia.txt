==History==
AirAsia was established in 1993 and began operations on 18 November 1996. It was founded by a [[Government of Malaysia|government]]-owned conglomerate, [[DRB-HICOM]]. On 8 September 2001, the heavily indebted airline was bought by former [[Time Warner]] executive [[Tony Fernandes]] and [[Kamarudin Meranun]]'s<ref>{{cite news|title=Datuk Kamarudin Meranun|url=https://newsroom.airasia.com/leadership/2018/3/28/datuk-kamarudin-meranun|accessdate=19 April 2019|work=newsroom.airasia.com|date=28 March 2018}}</ref> company Tune Air Sdn Bhd for the token sum of one [[Malaysian ringgit|ringgit]] (about US$0.26 at the time) with US$11 million (MYR 40 million) worth of debts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tony Fernandes|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2004-07-11/tony-fernandes|accessdate=29 December 2014|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=11 July 2004}}</ref> The partners turned the company around, producing a profit in 2002 and launching new routes from its hub in [[Kuala Lumpur]], undercutting former monopoly operator [[Malaysia Airlines]] with promotional fares as low as [[Malaysian ringgit|MYR]] 1 ([[United States dollar|US]]$0.27). In 2003, AirAsia opened a second hub at [[Senai International Airport]] in [[Johor Bahru]] and launched its first international flight to [[Bangkok]].

AirAsia subsequently started its [[Thai AirAsia]] affiliate and began flights to [[Singapore]] and [[Indonesia]]. Flights to [[Macau]] started in June 2004, and flights to mainland China ([[Xiamen]]) and the Philippines ([[Manila]]) in April 2005. Flights to [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]] followed in 2005 and to [[Brunei]] and [[Myanmar]] in 2006, the latter by Thai AirAsia. In August 2006, AirAsia took over Malaysia Airlines's Rural Air Service routes in [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]], operating under the [[FlyAsianXpress]] brand. The routes were returned to [[MASwings]] a year later, citing commercial reasons.

At the end of 2006, Fernandes unveiled a five-year plan to further enhance AirAsia's presence in Asia.<ref>{{Cite news |work=The Star |location =Kuala Lumpur |title=AirAsia embarks on 2nd chapter |author=Leong Hung Yee |date=27 December 2006 |url=http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/12/27/business/16419327&sec=business}}</ref> Under the plan, AirAsia proposed enhancing its route network by connecting all of its existing destinations throughout the region and expanding further into Vietnam, Indonesia, Southern China (Kunming, Xiamen, Shenzhen) and India. Through its sister companies, Thai AirAsia and Indonesia AirAsia, the plan called for a focus on developing its hub in [[Bangkok]] and [[Jakarta]]. With increased frequency and the addition of new routes, AirAsia increased passenger volume to 13.9 million in its 2007 fiscal year.<ref>{{Cite news |work=AirAsia|title=AirAsia's 2007 Annual Report|author=AirAsia Group |url=http://www.airasia.com/iwov-resources/my/common/pdf/AirAsia/IR/annual-report-corporate-2007.pdf}}</ref>

On 27 September 2008, the company announced 106 new routes to be added to its list of 60. The number of old routes discontinued has not been disclosed.

In August 2011, AirAsia agreed to form an alliance with [[Malaysia Airlines]] by means of a share swap.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/seasia/major-overhaul-of-malaysias-airline-sector/458384 |title=Major Overhaul of Malaysia's Airline Sector |work=Jakarta Globe |author=Lopez, Leslie |date=10 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928002539/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/seasia/major-overhaul-of-malaysias-airline-sector/458384 |archivedate=28 September 2012 }}</ref> The alliance was struck down by the Malaysian government, in effect voiding the agreement of both airlines.

By early 2013, AirAsia's profits increased by 168% on a year-over-year basis compared to the same period in 2012. For the quarter ending 31 December 2012, the airline's net profit stood at 350.65 million ringgit (US$114.08 million). Despite a 1% rise in the average fuel price, the airline recorded profits of 1.88 billion ringgit for its full 2012 fiscal year.<ref name="MEGA PROFIT 2012">{{cite web|title=AirAsia profit soars, bullish on outlook|url=http://business.inquirer.net/109731/airasia-profit-soars-bullish-on-outlook|publisher=Inquirer|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>
