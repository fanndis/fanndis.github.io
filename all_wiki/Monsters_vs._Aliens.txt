==Plot==
In [[Modesto, California]], Susan Murphy is going to be married to news weatherman, Derek Dietl. Just before the ceremony, she is struck by a meteorite and its energy causes her to glow green and grow to an enormous size with her hair turning white during the wedding. A U.S. military detachment tranquilizes and captures her. She awakens in a top-secret [[Area 51|government facility]] that houses monsters of which the public are ignorant of, where she meets General W.R. Monger, the [[U.S. Army|Army]] officer in charge of the facility and her fellow monster inmates: Dr. Cockroach [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], a [[scientist]] who became half-human, half-cockroach after an experiment gone wrong; B.O.B. (Benzoate Ostylezene Bicarbonate), a brainless and living mass of blue goo that is a result of a food flavoring mutation; Insectosaurus, a massive bug mutated by nuclear radiation standing 350 feet in height; and the Missing Link, a prehistoric 20,000-year-old fish-ape hybrid who was thawed from deep ice by scientists. Susan, herself renamed to "Ginormica", is forbidden any contact with her friends and family, leaving her feeling increasingly isolated and lonely.

On a mysterious spaceship in deep space, an alien overlord named Gallaxhar is alerted to the presence of quantonium, a powerful energy source on Earth, and he sends a robotic probe to retrieve it. The probe later lands on Earth, where the [[President of the United States]] attempts to make [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] by playing "[[Axel F]]" for it, but the probe goes on a destructive rampage, heading straight for [[San Francisco]] after US Armed Forces are unable to destroy it; Monger convinces the President to grant the monsters: Ginormica, B.O.B, Cockroach, Link and Insectosaurus their freedom if they can stop the probe. In San Francisco, the robot detects the quantonium radiating through Ginormica's body and tries to take it from her, putting many lives at risk. At the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], Insectosaurus, Link, Cockroach, B.O.B, and Ginormica manage to destroy the probe by using bits from the bridge itself.

Gallaxhar sets a course for Earth to obtain the quantonium in person while the now-free Ginormica returns home with her new friends and reunites with her family. However, Cockroach, Link, B.O.B, and Insectosaurus alienate themselves from Ginormica's family due to their inexperience with the real world, while Derek breaks off his engagement with Ginormica by claiming that he cannot marry someone who would overshadow him and his career. Initially heartbroken by this breakup, Ginormica finally realizes that her life as a monster was even better than she thought and promises to Cockroach, Link, and B.O.B to never ''underestimate'' herself again. Suddenly, Ginormica is pulled into Gallaxhar's spaceship; Insectosaurus tries to save her, but he is shot down by the ship's plasma cannons, seemingly killing him.

On board the ship, upon learning Gallaxhar was the one who caused danger in her town, Ginormica furiously breaks free from her prison cell and chases down Gallaxhar, only to be trapped by a machine that extracts the quantonium from her body, shrinking her back to her normal size. Gallaxhar then uses the extracted quantonium to create [[cloning|clones]] of himself in order to launch a full-scale invasion of Earth. Monger manages to get B.O.B, Link and Cockroach on board the ship, where they rescue Ginormica and make their way to the main power core where Cockroach sets the ship to self-destruct to prevent the invasion. All but Ginormica are trapped as the blast doors close and she personally confronts Gallaxhar on the bridge. With time running out, she sends the ball of stored quantonium down on herself, restoring her monstrous size and strength. After rescuing her friends, they flee the ship and are rescued by Monger and Insectosaurus, who has morphed into a giant [[butterfly]]. The ship then self-destructs, killing Gallaxhar and his army.

Returning to Modesto, Ginormica, B.O.B, Link, Cockroach and Insectosaurus receive a hero's welcome. Hoping to take advantage of Ginormica's fame for his own career, Derek tries to get back together with her, but she rejects him with a big humiliation caught on camera. Monger then arrives to inform the monsters that a new monstrous [[snail]] called "Escargantua" is slowly making its way to [[Paris]], resulting in the monsters taking off to confront the new menace.

===Aliens===
* [[Rainn Wilson]] as Gallaxhar: An evil alien overlord intent on collecting quantonium – the substance that transformed Susan into Ginormica – to give his cloning machine enough power to generate an army of clones of himself to conquer Earth. He is served by gigantic robot probes. He claims to have suffered several traumas in his youth, driving him to destroy his own homeworld, and plans to make a new one on Earth. 
* [[Amy Poehler]] as Gallaxhar's computer.

* [[Stephen Colbert]] as President Hathaway: The impulsive and rather dimwitted [[President of the United States]]. Not wanting to be remembered as "the President in office when the world came to an end", he agrees with General Monger's "monsters vs aliens" plan when the U.S. Military is unable to defeat the robot probe sent by Gallaxhar.
* [[Paul Rudd]] as Derek Dietl: A local weatherman and Susan's ex-fiancé. He jumps at whatever opportunity he has to boost his career, which causes him to place his job (and himself) before his relationship with Susan, canceling their plans to have a romantic [[honeymoon]] in Paris to land an [[anchorman]] job in [[Fresno, California|Fresno]].
* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Carl Murphy: Susan's overemotional father.
* [[Julie White]] as Wendy Murphy: Susan's loving mother.

==Production==
The film started as an adaptation of a horror comic book, ''Rex Havoc'',<ref name=VarietyDWGrooming /> in which a monster hunter Rex and his team of experts called "Ass-Kickers of the Fantastic" fight against ghouls, ghosts and other creatures.<ref name=JobloRexDream>{{cite web|last=Torfe|first=Pat|title=Rex Havoc's a Dream|url=https://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/rex-havocs-a-dream|publisher=Joblo|accessdate=March 2, 2014|date=September 2, 2005}}</ref> The earliest development goes back to 2002, when DreamWorks first filed for a ''Rex Havoc'' trademark.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rex Havoc|url=http://www.trademarkia.com/rex-havoc-76410702.html|publisher=Trademarkia|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}</ref> In a plot synopsis revealed in 2005, Rex was to assemble a team of monsters, including Ick!, Dr. Cockroach, the 50,000 Pound Woman and Insectosaurus, to fight aliens for disrupting cable TV service.<ref name=VarietyDWGrooming>{{cite news|last=LaPorte|first=Nicole|title=DreamWorks grooming toons|url=https://variety.com/2005/digital/news/dreamworks-grooming-toons-1117929396/|accessdate=March 2, 2014|newspaper=Variety|date=September 20, 2005}}</ref> In the following years, the film's story diverged away from the original ''Rex Havoc'', with directors [[Conrad Vernon]] and [[Rob Letterman]] finally creating the storyline from scratch.<ref>{{cite web|last=Guillen|first=Michael|title=MONSTERS vs. ALIENS—Jeffrey Katzenberg Presentation|url=http://theeveningclass.blogspot.com/2009/02/monsters-vs-aliensjeffrey-katzenberg.html|publisher=The Evening Class|accessdate=March 2, 2014|date=February 9, 2009}}</ref>

Production designer David James stated that the film is "a return to what made us nerds in the first place," getting classic movie monsters and relaunching them in a contemporary setting. Director [[Conrad Vernon]] added that he found it would be a great idea to take hideous monsters and giving them personalities and satirizing the archetypes.<ref name=MvADVD /> Each of the five monsters has traits traceable to sci-fi/horror B movies from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, although none is a mere copy of an older character.<ref name=NYTInspired>{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=The Monsters That Inspired ‘Monsters vs. Aliens’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/movies/22sbar.html|accessdate=October 26, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 19, 2009}}</ref> Susan, who grows to be 49 feet 11 inches tall, was inspired by ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]''. Dr. Cockroach represents ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]'' and ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'', while B.O.B. is an amalgam of slithering and slimy characters that were featured in the films, including ''[[The Blob]]'' and ''[[The Trollenberg Terror|The Crawling Eye]]''. Insectosaurus, a 350-foot-tall monster, is a nod to the 1961 Kaiju film ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]''. According to Vernon, the Missing Link has no direct inspiration. He "just represents anything prehistoric that comes back to life and terrorizes people."<ref name=NYTInspired /> For the San Francisco sequence, the producers researched many films and photographs for an accurate depiction of the city, and filmed animator Line Andersen, who had a similar body type to Ginormica&mdash;tall, thin, and athletic-looking&mdash;walking alongside a scale model of San Francisco, to capture better how a person not comfortable with being too big with an environment would walk around it.<ref name=MvADVD>"Modern Movie Monster-Making", ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' DVD</ref>

Ed Leonard, CTO of DreamWorks Animation, says it took approximately 45.6 million computing hours to make ''Monsters vs. Aliens'', more than eight times as many as the original ''[[Shrek]]''. Several hundred [[Hewlett-Packard]] xw8600 workstations were used, along with a '[[render farm]]' of HP ProLiant [[blade server]]s with over 9,000 server processor cores, to process the animation sequence. Animators used 120 [[terabytes]] of data to complete the film. They used 6 TB for an explosion scene.<ref>{{cite news |first=Theo |last=Boshoff |title=Monsters, aliens come alive|url=http://www.itweb.co.za/sections/computing/2009/0903311157.asp |work=ITWeb |date=March 31, 2009 }}</ref>

Starting with ''Monsters vs. Aliens'', all feature films released by DreamWorks Animation were produced in a [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] 3D format, using [[Intel]]'s [[InTru3D]] technology.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Intel, Dreamworks Animation Form Strategic Alliance to Revolutionize 3-D Filmmaking Technology |publisher=Intel |date=July 8, 2008 |url=http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2008/20080708corp.htm |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref> 2D, [[RealD 3D]], [[IMAX 3D]], and [[4DX]] versions were released.

==Release==
===Marketing===
To promote the 3D technology that is used in ''Monsters vs. Aliens'', DreamWorks ran a 3D trailer before halftime in the U.S. broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLIII]] on February 1, 2009. Due to the limitations of current television technology, [[Stereoscopy#ColorCode 3-D|ColorCode 3-D]] glasses were distributed at [[SoBe]] stands at major national grocers. The Monsters, except Ginormica and Insectosaurus, also appeared in a 3D SoBe commercial airing after the trailer. [[Bank of America]] gave away vouchers which covered the cost of an upgrade to a 3D theatrical viewing of the film for its customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/whaaat-bailed-out-bank-of-america-paying-for-consumers-to-see-hollywood-toon/|title= Bailed Out Bank Of America Paying Consumers To See Hollywood Film|work=Deadline Hollywood Daily|author=Finke, Nikki|date=Mar 19, 2009}}</ref>

Beside the main film, the ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' franchise also includes a [[Monsters vs. Aliens (video game)|video game]], a [[short film]] titled ''[[B.O.B.'s Big Break]]'' and two [[television special]]s titled ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space]]'' and ''[[Night of the Living Carrots]]'', respectively. A [[Monsters vs. Aliens (TV series)|television series]] based on the film also started airing on [[Nickelodeon]] on March 23, 2013, which was cancelled after one season due to low ratings, poor reviews and the network's desire to refocus on making the more "Nickish" shows.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schooley|first=Bob|title=Ratings, desire of Nick to get back to the more "Nickish" shows.|url=https://twitter.com/bob_schooley/status/435230104319295490|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=June 6, 2014|date=February 16, 2014}}</ref>

===Cancelled sequel===
Despite its success in the United States market, DreamWorks Animation's CEO, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] said in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that a sequel would never be made due to the film's weak performance in some key international markets (most notably [[France]] and [[Japan]]). Katzenberg explained: "There was enough of a consensus from our distribution and marketing folks in certain parts of the world that 'doing a sequel' would be pushing a boulder up a hill."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2009/10/dreamworks-animation-records-earnings-drop-does-better-than-wall-street-expects.html|title=DreamWorks Animation's profit drops; no sequel for 'Monsters vs. Aliens'|date=2009-10-27|website=LA Times Blogs – Company Town|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-17}}</ref> In April 2011, DreamWorks Animation's CEO, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], commented that the studio did not have plans to produce future movie-genre parodies like ''[[Shark Tale]]'', ''Monsters vs. Aliens'', and ''[[Megamind]]'', saying that these films "all shared an approach and tone and idea of parody, and did not travel well internationally. We don't have anything like that coming on our schedule now."<ref>{{cite news|last=Lieberman|first=David|title=DreamWorks Animation Pins Hopes On ‘Kung Fu Panda 2′ After 1Q Earnings Fall Short|url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/04/dreamworks-pins-hopes-on-kung-fu-panda-2-after-first-quarter-earnings-fall-short/|accessdate=September 17, 2012|newspaper=Deadline|date=April 26, 2011}}</ref>
