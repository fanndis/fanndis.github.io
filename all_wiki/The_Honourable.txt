==International diplomacy==
In international diplomatic relations, representatives of foreign states are often addressed as "The Honourable". Deputy chiefs of mission, [[chargés d'affaires]], consuls-general and consuls are always given the style. All heads of consular posts, whether they are honorary or career postholders, are accorded the title according to the State Department of the United States.<ref>This is referenced in the Los Angeles Country Protocol Register: "Following the practice of the U.S. Department of State Office of Protocol, all heads of post are accorded the courtesy title of “The Honorable” before their names." http://ceo.lacounty.gov/pdf/LosAngelesConsularCorpsRoster.pdf It is worth noting that Los Angeles has the highest density of consulates and consulates-general of any city in the world. Furthermore, for example, http://phoenix.gov/ECONDEV/consulat.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822223246/http://phoenix.gov/ECONDEV/consulat.html |date=22 August 2011 }} or http://www.oakgov.com/globaloakland/oakland_county/consulates.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822135856/http://www.oakgov.com/globaloakland/oakland_county/consulates.html |date=22 August 2010 }} An authoritative source can be found at http://www.bmeia.gv.at/index.php?id=68719&L=1 where the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists all Honorary Consuls with the style of "The Hon."</ref> However, ambassadors and [[high commissioner]]s are never given the style, with the title "[[Your Excellency]]" being used.

===Europe===
====Germany====
A rough equivalent of "The Honourable" would be ''[[Hochwohlgeboren]]'' ("High Well-born"), which was used until 1918 for all members of properly noble families not having any higher style. Its application to bourgeois dignitaries became common in the 19th century, though it has faded since and was always of doubtful correctness.

A literal equivalent of "The Honourable", ''Ehrwürdig'' or ''Ehrwürden'', is used for [[Catholic]] [[clergy]] and [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]]{{mdash}}with the exceptions of priests and abbesses, who are ''Hochwürden'' ([[Reverend]]). A subdeacon is "Very Honourable" (''Wohlehrwürden''); a deacon is "Right Honourable" (''Hochehrwürden'').

Former and current Heads of Government or President of the Generalitat are given the name of ''Molt Honorable'' ("Right Honorable"). This also applies to former and current heads of government of the Autonomous Communities of [[Valencia]] and [[Balearic Islands]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Llista de tractaments protocol·laris [in catalan]|url=http://www.upf.edu/daupf/5ap1/512ex.htm|publisher=Universitat Pompeu Fabra|access-date=9 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110228/http://www.upf.edu/daupf/5ap1/512ex.htm|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====United Kingdom====
=====Entitlement=====
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
In the United Kingdom, all sons and daughters of [[viscount]]s and [[baron]]s (including the holders of [[life peerage]]s) and the younger sons of [[earl]]s are styled with this prefix. (The daughters and younger sons of [[duke]]s and [[marquess]]es and the daughters of [[earl]]s have the higher style of ''Lord'' or ''Lady'' before their first names, and the eldest sons of dukes, marquesses and earls are known by one of their father's or mother's subsidiary titles). The style is only a [[courtesy title|courtesy]], however, and on legal documents they may be described as, for instance, ''John Smith, Esq., commonly called The Honourable John Smith''. As the wives of sons of peers share the styles of their husbands, the wives of the sons of viscounts and barons and the younger sons of earls are styled, for example, ''The Hon. Mrs John Smith''. Likewise, the married daughters of viscounts and barons, whose husbands hold no higher title or dignity, are styled, for example, ''The Hon. Mrs Smith''.

In 1912, King [[George V]] granted [[Maid of honour|maids of honour]] (royal attendants) the style of ''the honourable'' for life, with precedence next after daughters of barons.<ref>{{London Gazette|nolink=y|issue=28661|page=8201|date=8 November 1912}}</ref>

''The honourable'' is also customarily used as a form of address for most foreign nobility that is not formally recognised by the sovereign (e.g. ambassadors) when in the UK.

Some people are entitled to the prefix by virtue of their offices. Rules exist that allow certain individuals to keep the prefix ''The Honourable'' even after retirement.
* Judges of the [[High Court of England and Wales|High Court]] and other superior courts in the Commonwealth (if the judge is a [[knight]], the style ''Sir John Smith'' is used socially instead of ''The Honourable Mr Justice Smith''.); and
* Members of Commonwealth [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|executive]] and [[Legislative Council|legislative council]]s (or [[senate]]s) where the legislature is [[bicameral]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Several corporate entities have been awarded the style by [[royal warrant (document)|royal warrant]], for example:
* [[Honourable East India Company|The Honourable East India Company]];
* The [[Honourable Artillery Company]];
* The Honourable Society of the [[Inner Temple]] (along with the other [[Inns of Court]])
* The [[Honourable Company of Master Mariners]]
* The [[Honourable Company of Air Pilots]]

=====Usage=====
The style ''The Honourable'' is usually used in addressing envelopes (where it is usually abbreviated to ''The Hon.'') and formally elsewhere, in which case ''Mr'' or ''[[Esquire]]'' are omitted. In speech, however, The Honourable John Smith is usually referred to simply as Mr John Smith.

In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], as in other traditionally lower houses of Parliament and other legislatures, members must as a minimum refer to each other as ''the honourable member'' or ''my honourable friend'' out of courtesy, but they are not entitled to the style in writing. It was previously the case that members who were 'senior' [[barrister]]s may be called ''the honourable and learnèd member''; serving or ex-serving members of the military ''the honourable and gallant member''; and ordained clergy in the House ''the honourable and reverend member''. However, this was abolished in 2010 following a recommendation of the Modernisation Committee.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g07.pdf}}</ref> When anyone is entitled to the prefix ''[[The Right Honourable]]'' this is used instead of ''the honourable''.

In the [[Falkland Islands]], the [[style (manner of address)|style]] ''the honourable'' is given to any serving or former [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|members]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Assembly]] or [[Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Council]].

In the [[Isle of Man]], the [[style (manner of address)|style]] ''the honourable'' (often abbreviated to ''Hon.'') is used to refer to a [[Council of Ministers of the Isle of Man|minister]] while holding office.

===North America===
====Canada====
{{Further|Style (manner of address)}}
In Canada, while not enshrined in any legislation, the style of address in common use has some individuals referred to as ''The Honourable'' ({{lang-fr|link=no|l'honorable}}). Those who have the honorific for life include:<ref name="HEritage-styles">{{cite web|title=Titles|url=http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1452017684393|website=Canadian Heritage|publisher=Government of Canada|access-date=28 February 2016}}</ref><ref name="PWGSC-styles">{{cite web|title=lieutenant-governor, Lt.-Gov., His/Her Honour, Honourable|url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2guides/guides/wrtps/index-eng.html?lang=eng&lettr=indx_catlog_l&page=9U_I-yqmZDBY.html|website=Public Works and Government Services Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|access-date=28 February 2016}}</ref><ref name="GC-CA-Table-Of-Titles">{{cite web|title=Table of Titles to be used in Canada|url=http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1452187406810/1453733836056|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|access-date=28 February 2016}}</ref>
* [[Senate of Canada|Senators]]

The Governor General may grant permission to retain the title after they cease to hold office. Persons eligible to retain the title include the Speaker of the House of Commons (if not made a privy councillor already), territorial commissioners, and judges of certain courts.

It is usual for speakers of the House of Commons to be made privy councillors, in which case they keep the style for life. Also, provincial [[premier]]s and federal opposition leaders are sometimes made privy councillors.

Members of the [[House of Commons of Canada]] and of provincial legislatures refer to each other during proceedings of the house as "honourable members" (or {{lang|fr|l'honorable député}}) but are not permitted by the social custom to have ''the Honourable'' as a prefix in front of their name unless they are privy councillors.<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/prtcl/address2-eng.cfm Canadian Heritage – Styles of address – Federal dignitaries]</ref>

Current and former [[Governor General of Canada|governors general]], [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime ministers]], [[Chief Justice of Canada|chief justices]] and certain other eminent persons generally use the style ''[[the Right Honourable]]'' for life (or {{lang|fr|le/la très honorable}} in French). Originally, this is subject to being summoned to the British Privy Council. Several early prime ministers were not summoned to the British Privy Council and hence were styled "The Honourable", these were [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]], Sir [[John Abbott]] and Sir [[Mackenzie Bowell]].

Since 2009, former members of the [[Executive Council of Nova Scotia]] retain "The Honourable" for life.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} By contrast, since 1968, members of the [[Executive Council of Quebec]] have not used the title "The Honourable".

Persons made a [[Barbadian national heroes|National Hero]] of Barbados are styled "The Right Excellent".

=====Jamaica=====
In [[Jamaica]], those awarded the [[Order of Jamaica]] (considered Jamaica's equivalent to a British [[knighthood]]) are styled "The Honourable".

=====Puerto Rico=====
In [[Puerto Rico]], much like the continental United States, the term "Honorable" (in Spanish) is used, but not required by law, to address Puerto Rican governors as well as city mayors, members of state and municipal legislatures, judges and property registrars, as well as when formally addressing the President of the United States, of which Puerto Rico is a territory.

====United States====
In the [[United States]], the prefix ''the Honorable'' has been used to formally address various officials at the federal and state levels, but it is most commonly used for the President-elect, [[Governor (United States)|governors]],  judges, and members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] when formally addressing them.<ref name=HickeyHowToUse/> In the United States, the title may be conferred pursuant to federal government service, according to federal rules, or by state government service, where the rules may be different. Modifiers such as ''the Right Honorable'' or ''the Most Honorable'' are not used. The "t" in "the" is not capitalized in the middle of a sentence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.formsofaddress.info/Honorables.html#146|title=How to Use "The Honorable"|website=www.formsofaddress.info}}</ref>

Members of the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House staff]] at the rank of special assistant, deputy assistant, assistant to the president, and [[Counselor to the President]] are accorded the title. Officials nominated to high office but not yet confirmed (e.g., commissioner-designate) and interim or acting officials are generally not accorded the title "the Honorable," except for Cabinet-level officials.<ref name=HickeyHowToUse>Robert Hickey, [https://www.formsofaddress.info/honorable/#325 How to Use the Honorable] (citing Mary Mel French, ''United States Protocol: The Guide to Official Diplomatic Etiquette'').</ref>

Opinions vary on whether the term "the Honorable" is accorded for life.<ref name="Mewborn"/> According to the protocols of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], all persons who have been in a position that entitled them to "The Honorable" continue to retain that honorific title even after they leave that position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/cpr/c18027.htm|title=Protocol Frequently Asked Questions|website=2009-2017.state.gov}}</ref> However, The State Department is not an authority on state and local officials such as mayors, members of state legislatures, and high state officials.

Both Current and Former, As The Honorable" [http://www.formsofaddress.info/Honorables.html online]</ref>

American protocol expert Robert Hickey says, "The courtesy title The Honorable is used when addressing or listing the name of a living person. When the name of a deceased person is listed it is just (Full Name) + Office Held."<ref>See [http://www.formsofaddress.info/Honorables.html#026 Robert Hickey, "How to Address U.S. Officials, Both Current and Former, As The Honorable"]</ref> The 2016 Bloomsbury guide to titles and forms of address states that the title 'honorable' in this context is "held for life or during tenure of office."<ref>{{cite book|author=Bloomsbury Publishing|title=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10jOCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA127|year=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|page=127}}</ref> ''The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage'' by Allan M.

In the [[Commonwealth of Kentucky]], commissioned [[Kentucky colonel]]s are considered honorary [[aides-de-camp]] to the [[Governor of Kentucky|Governor]] and members of his/her staff. As such, they are entitled to the style of ''Honorable'' as indicated on their commission certificates. The [[Commission (document)|commission]] and [[letters patent]] granted by the governor and [[Secretary of State of Kentucky|secretary of state]] bestowing the title of Kentucky colonel refers to the honoree as "Honorable First Name Last Name." However, this style is rarely used with most Kentucky colonels preferring to be referred to and addressed as [[colonel]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The style ''The Honorable'' is used on envelopes when referring to an individual in the third person. It is never used to refer to oneself.<ref name="Hickey">Robert Hickey, [http://www.formsofaddress.info/Honorables.html How to Use "the Honorable"].</ref>

A spouse of someone with the style of ''The Honorable'' receives no additional style, unless personally entitled to the style in his or her own right by virtue of holding, or having held, one of the offices mentioned above.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
In Australia, the style is generally used for an administrator of a territory, government ministers, members of most state [[legislative council]]s ([[upper house]]s), and judges of [[superior court]]s.

=====Governors=====
In May 2013, the style was given approval by the Queen to be granted to the [[Governor-General of Australia]], both retrospectively and for current and future holders of the office,<ref name=hongg>[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013G00681 "The title 'the Honourable' for Governors-General"], ''Australian Government Special Gazette'' C2013G00681, 8 May 2013.</ref> to be used in the form "His/Her Excellency the Honourable" while holding office and as "the Honourable" in retirement.

As of December 2014, the practice of appointing the vice-regal office holder, as well as former living, the style ''The Honourable'' for life has been also adopted for the state governors of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, Victoria and Tasmania (where it only applied to the current governor and future governors) as well as the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=====Government ministers=====
In Australia, all ministers in Commonwealth and state governments and the government of the [[Northern Territory]] are entitled to be styled ''the Honourable''. The [[Australian Capital Territory]] does not have an [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|executive council]] and so its ministers are not entitled to the style. In Victoria, the style is granted for life, so it is customary for former ministers to retain the title after leaving office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/about/people-in-parliament/addressing-members |title=Parliament of Victoria - Addressing Members |publisher=Parliament.vic.gov.au |date=8 March 2013 |access-date=4 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Pitson |editor1-first=John |publication-date=1978 |title=Style Manual for authors, editors and printers of Australian Government publications|location=Canberra |publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|page=349 }}</ref> In New South Wales, Queensland,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/global/faqs/education |title=Frequently asked questions - Education - Queensland Parliament |publisher=Parliament.qld.gov.au |access-date=4 September 2013}}</ref> South Australia and Tasmania the [[premier]]s can advise the [[Queen of Australia]] to grant former ministers the style for life. In the Northern Territory, the [[chief minister]] can request the administrator to make a recommendation to the governor-general who in turn makes a recommendation to the Queen. A minimum five years' service as a member of the executive council and/or as a presiding officer is a prerequisite. In Western Australia, conditional on royal assent, the title may become permanent after three years' service in the ministry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/WebCMS/webcms.nsf/content/members-addressing-a-member |title=Parliament of WA - Addressing a Member |publisher=Parliament.wa.gov.au |access-date=4 September 2013}}</ref> All such awards are published in the ''Commonwealth Government Gazette''. The presiding officers of the parliaments of the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory are also styled ''the Honourable'', but normally only during their tenure of office. Special permission is sometimes given for a former presiding officer to retain the style after leaving office, as is the case in the Northern Territory.

=====Members of Parliament=====
The style "Honourable" is not acquired through membership of either the House of Representatives or the Senate (see [[Parliament of Australia]]). A member or senator may have the style if they have acquired it separately, e.g. by being a current or former minister. During proceedings within the chambers, forms such as "the honourable Member for ...", "the honourable the Leader of the Opposition", or "My honourable colleague" are used. This is a parliamentary courtesy and does not imply any right to the style.

Traditionally, members of the [[legislative council]]s of the states have been styled ''the Honourable'' for the duration of their terms. That practice is still followed in [[New South Wales Legislative Council|New South Wales]], [[Western Australian Legislative Council|Western Australia]], [[South Australian Legislative Council|South Australia]] and [[Tasmanian Legislative Council|Tasmania]]. In [[Victorian Legislative Council|Victoria]], the practice was abolished in 2003. In New South Wales, [[Greens New South Wales|Greens NSW]] members of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]], who are eligible for ''the Honourable'' style, have refrained from using it, deeming it to be "outdated" and a "colonial trapping".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://greensmps.org.au/articles/greens-put-honourable-title-historys-dustbin|title=Greens put "Honourable" title in history's dustbin|publisher=Lee Rhiannon|website=Greens|date=3 April 2011|access-date=21 October 2019}}</ref>

=====Judges=====
