'''Lampung''' is a [[provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[Indonesia]]. It is located on the southern tip of the island of [[Sumatra]]. It has a short border with the province of [[Bengkulu]] to the northwest, and a longer border with the province of [[South Sumatra]] to the north. It is the original home of the [[Lampung people]], who speak [[Lampung language|their own language]], and possess [[Lampung language#Writing system|their own written script]]. Its capital is [[Bandar Lampung]].

The province covers a land area of 35,376 sq.km and had a population of 7,608,405 at the 2010 Census and 8,109,601 at the 2015 Census; the latest official estimate (as at mid 2019) was 8,457,600, with three-quarters of that being descendants of [[Java (island)|Javanese]], [[Madura|Madurese]], and [[Bali]]nese migrants. These migrants came from more densely populated islands, in search of available land, as well as being part of the national government's [[transmigration program|Indonesian transmigration program]], of which Lampung was one of the earliest and most significant transmigration destinations.

On 10 May 2005, a 6.4 magnitude [[earthquake]] struck the province. In 1883, the volcano of [[Krakatoa]], located on an island in the Sunda Strait, separating the islands of Sumatra and [[Java]], suffered one of the most [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|violent volcanic eruptions]] in recorded history, with disastrous consequences for the area and elsewhere, including estimates of human fatalities in the tens of thousands, and worldwide temperature and other weather effects for years.

==History==
In the 7th century, word spread throughout China of a region located in the far south (Namphang) known as "Tolang Pohwang". ("To" meaning 'people' in [[Lampung language|Lampungese]] while "Lang Pohwang" was the then-popular name for the region that is now Lampung). It is possible that Lampung was part of the Kingdom of [[Srivijaya]], with its regional capital in [[Jambi]], which controlled most of [[Southeast Asia]] until the 11th century. The Srivijayans came to Lampung in search of gold and amber, two of the province's natural resources.

This history is substantiated by both unearthed relics and the discovery of the Palas Pasemah inscriptions and the Batu Bedil inscriptions in the Tenggamus region that trace back to Srivijayan times and civilization.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Other, smaller kingdoms like Tulang Bawang (name still extant as a [[Tulang Bawang Regency|regency]] in the province) and Skala Brak also existed during the 7th to 8th centuries CE. The former was centered around the [[Tulang Bawang River]], hence the name.

The entry of the [[Banten Sultanate]] in Lampung in the 16th century marked the beginning of the spread of [[Islam]] in the region. Lampung is known for pepper which at that time was in high demand. At that time, the Dutch began pressing for control of the region.<ref>Changes of Regime And Social Dynamics in West Java: Society, State And the Outer World of Banten, 1750-1830</ref> In the 1930s Lampung still accounted for 30% of the world's pepper production.<ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Safitri |first=Myrna Asnawati |title=Forest tenure in Indonesia: the socio-legal challenges of securing communities' rights |date=2010 |degree=PhD |publisher=Leiden University |chapter-url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/16242/06.pdf?sequence=12 |chapter=9. Social forest in Langkawana: from license to supervision }}</ref>

The control of pepper production exercised by the [[Banten Sultanate]] made Lampung one of the most prosperous harbors in the archipelago. Similarly, pepper plants also attracted migrants from Europe as employees of trading companies. It was in 1610 that the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a trading post in [[Banten]] and later in the 17th century began the forceful pepper cultivation in Lampung to increase its already existing production.<ref>Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor, Volume 1</ref> The area was part of the Banten Sultanate until it was annexed by the Dutch in 1752, when it became known as the ''Residentie Lampoengse Districten''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hubert-herald.nl/IndoLampung.htm |title=Lampung Arms |website=www.hubert-herald.nl |access-date=24 July 2016}}</ref> It became part of the [[Dutch East Indies]].

Under Dutch rule, transmigration programs were implemented. This program involved the migration of people from Java to Lampung. It was quite well-received and many residents of Java moved to the transmigration sites located in the eastern region of Lampung.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The program was expanded after [[Indonesia]]n independence in the 1960s. Natives of Java brought cultural devices to Lampung, such as the [[gamelan]] and [[wayang]]. Islanders of Bali {{When|date=June 2018}} also came to Lampung to follow the transmigration program. The presence of migrants from other regions in Lampung has made this region culturally diverse. Ethnic diversity has become a tourist attraction in itself, with the added potential of nature and cultural tourism. Numerous art studios in the area act as a preserver of indigenous art and culture.

==Geography==
[[File:Uprising-mt anak krakatau.jpg|thumb|[[Anak Krakatau]]]]
Lampung Province has an area of {{convert|35,376.50|km2|abbr=on}} and is located between the latitudes of 105°45'-103°48 'E and 3°45'-6°45'S.

==Agriculture==
[[File:Coffee beans robusta.jpg|thumb|Robusta coffee beans, a type of coffee bean produced in Lampung]]
Major crops in the region include robusta [[coffee bean]]s, [[cocoa bean]]s, [[coconut]]s and [[clove]]s. This has resulted in a thriving agricultural sector with companies like [[Nestlé]] procuring coffee beans from the region. This agriculture has included illegal growing in [[Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Leow |first=Claire |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/18/bloomberg/bxnestle.php |title=Nestlé to scrutinize Indonesia coffee amid wildlife-endangerment fears |date=19 January 2007 |work=International Herald Tribune |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070122045500/http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/18/bloomberg/bxnestle.php |archive-date=22 January 2007}}</ref> In addition, [[nata de coco]] is also manufactured in the region by domestic companies like Wong Coco.

Until the 1920s, Lampung had a rich and varied [[weaving]] tradition. Lampung weaving used a supplementary [[weft]] technique which enabled colored silk or cotton threads to be superimposed on a plainer cotton background. The most prominent Lampung textile was the [[Palepai, Sumatran ships cloth|Palepai]], ownership of which was restricted to the Lampung aristocracy of the Kalianda Bay area.<ref name="Dallas"/> There were two types of smaller clothes, known as ''tatibin'' and ''tampan'', which could be owned and used by all levels of Lampungese society. Weaving technologies were spread throughout Lampung. High-quality weavings were produced by the Paminggir, Krui, Abung and Pesisir peoples. Production was particularly prolific among the people of the Kalianda Bay area in the south and the Krui aristocracy in the north.

Lampung textiles, ''Palepai'', ''tatebin'' and ''tampan'' were called 'ship cloths' because ships are a common motif.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gittinger|first=Mattiebelle|year=1979|title=Splendid Symbols: Textiles and Tradition in Indonesia|publisher=[[The Textile Museum]]|location=Washington DC|lccn=79-50373|oclc=5100926|page=157}}</ref> The ship motif represents the transition from one realm of life to the next, for instance from boyhood to manhood or from being single to married, and also represents the final transition to the afterlife.<ref name="Dallas">{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasmuseumofart.org/Dallas_Museum_of_Art/View/Collections/Pacific_Islands/ID_011092 |access-date=26 September 2007 |title=Ceremonial Hanging (palepai) |work=Pacific Islands art |publisher=Dallas Museum of Art |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004055100/http://www.dallasmuseumofart.org/Dallas_Museum_of_Art/View/Collections/Pacific_Islands/ID_011092 |archive-date=4 October 2006 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Traditionally, Lampung textiles were used as part of religious ceremonies such as weddings and [[circumcision]]s. For instance, Palepai cloths were used as long ceremonial wall-hangings behind the bridal party in aristocratic marriages. The smaller, more humble ''tampan'' cloth was exchanged between families at the time of weddings.

Production of fine cloth blossomed in the late nineteenth century as Lampung grew rich on [[Black pepper|pepper]] production, but the devastating eruption of [[Krakatoa]] in 1883 destroyed many weaving villages in the Kalianda area.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gittinger|first=Mattiebelle S.|title=SOUTH SUMATRAN SHIP CLOTHS|year=1979|url=http://www.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/articles/nb74_shp.pdf|page=15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203180430/http://www.cs.arizona.edu:80/patterns/weaving/articles/nb74_shp.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 3, 2016}}</ref>{{verification failed|date=October 2020}} By the 1920s the increasing importance of Islam and the collapse of the pepper trade brought production to a halt.<ref>Sudha Rajagopalan; Navigating Culture: Trade and Transformation in the Island State.

==Tourism==
Although tourism is not Lampung Province's main source of income, the administration has attempted to boost tourism through ''Flamboyant Tanjung Setia.'' This event seeks to draw tourists to [[West Lampung Regency|Tanjung Setia Beach]], which has a natural panoramic view and challenging waves for surfing. Another tourist attraction is the [[Way Kambas National Park]], which is popular with local tourists. In 2010, four-hundred thousand tourists visited Lampung Province, including ten thousand foreign tourists mainly from Australia and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waspada.co.id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=201852:lampung-making-effort-to-attract-tourists&catid=30:english-news&Itemid=101|title=Waspada Online – Pusat Berita dan Informasi Medan Sumut Aceh|publisher=Waspada.co.id|access-date=24 July 2016}}</ref>

Way Kambas National Park is a national park and elephant sanctuary in the district of Labuhan Ratu, East Lampung. In addition to Way Kambas, another elephant school (Elephant Training Centre) can also be found in Minas, [[Riau]]. The number of [[Sumatran elephant]]s (''Elephas maximus sumatranus'') living in the region has decreased. Way Kambas National Park was established in 1985 as the first elephant school in Indonesia and is expected to become a center for elephant conservation in taming, training, breeding and conservation. Until now, this PKG has trained about three hundred elephants that have been deployed to other parts of the country.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}
