==Tennis coaching==
[[File:Serena Williams embraces Venus Williams as Father looks on.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|Richard Williams seen with his daughters shortly after Serena Williams' victory in the 2012 Wimbledon Championships]]
He took tennis lessons from a man known as "Old Whiskey" and decided his future daughters would be tennis professionals when he saw [[Virginia Ruzici]] playing on television.<ref name="Edmondson"/> Williams says that he wrote up a 78-page plan, and started giving lessons to Venus and Serena when they were four and a half, and began taking them to the public tennis courts. (He now says he feels like he took them too early, and six is a better age.)<ref name=NYer/> Soon he got them into Shreveport tennis tournaments. In 1995, Williams pulled them out of a tennis academy, and coached them himself.<ref>Edmondson (2005), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eKK771yLaHkC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=%22richard+williams%22+coached+serena+1995&source=bl&ots=W9XMP7xy9z&sig=rElZyShLgmNHiJ-fwSc4Ts_wWfo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWwp29r-jNAhXoJcAKHUl2DjcQ6AEIVzAM#v=onepage&q=%22richard%20williams%22%20coached%20serena%201995&f=false p. 47.]</ref>

Serena won the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 1999; Venus beat [[Lindsay Davenport]] to win the [[2000 Wimbledon]] title. After that victory, Richard shouted "[[Straight Outta Compton]]!" (in reference to a song by [[N.W.A]] based in Compton, California, the same area in Los Angeles where the family once resided).<ref name = stage>{{cite news| first= Richard |last= Jago| url= https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jul/04/venus-serena-williams-wimbledon-womens-final |title= Richard Williams leaves Venus and Serena to take centre stage| work= [[The Guardian]]| date= July 4, 2009 | accessdate= September 6, 2019}}</ref> He jumped over the NBC broadcasting booth, catching [[Chris Evert]] by surprise and performing a triumphant dance. Evert said that the broadcasters "thought the roof was coming down".<ref name = stage />

==Personal life==
Williams has been married multiple times. After moving to California, he met Betty Johnson. They married in 1965 and had five children (three sons and two daughters) before divorcing in 1973:<ref name= "Edmondson" /> Sabrina, Richard III, Ronner, Reluss, and Reneeka, who were also raised with maternal half-sister Katrina.<ref>https://pagesix.com/2020/01/10/serena-and-venus-half-sister-calls-dad-a-sperm-donor-who-abandoned-first-family</ref>

In 1979, he met [[Oracene Price|Oracene "Brandy" Price]], who had three daughters by her deceased husband. They married in 1980. Williams and Price had two biological daughters, Venus (born June 17, 1980) and Serena (born September 26, 1981). The family resided in Compton, California. Richard and Oracene divorced in 2002.

Later in his daughters' careers, he took a less visible role, turning to other interests such as photography. He raised public interest again after his divorce from Oracene Price and appearances with new girlfriend Lakeisha Juanita Graham who was a grocery store owner<ref name= "second wife">{{cite news| url= https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/local/new-father-venus-serena-williams-seeks-divorce-from-second-wife/YslsBw624dv7nvm4vr5J8O/ | work= [[The Palm Beach Post]]| title= NEW: Father of Venus, Serena Williams seeks divorce from second wife | first= Eliot| last= Kleinberg| date= June 15, 2017| access-date= September 6, 2019}}</ref> and is a year older than Venus.<ref name=NYer/> Richard and Lakeisha were married in 2010 and divorced in 2017.<ref name= interpret /><ref name= "second wife"/> Their son Dylan was born in 2012.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2012/10/williams-sisters-have-new-little-brother/39895/ |title= Williams Sisters Have New Little Brother| website= Tennis.com| first= Matt| last= Cronin| date= October 24, 2012| access-date= September 6, 2019}}</ref>
