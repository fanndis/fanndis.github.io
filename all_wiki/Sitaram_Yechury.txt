===Role in Rajya Sabha===
Yechury was elected to [[Rajya Sabha]] from [[West Bengal]] in July 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/08/23/stories/2005082306871200.htm|title=The Hindu : National : Yechury, Brinda Karat take oath|work=hindu.com|date=23 August 2005}}</ref> He is known for bringing several popular issues to the notice of parliament and for raising questions on important issues. On blaming by the ruling party for frequent disruptions in parliament, he said that government cannot escape from its responsibility by blaming the opposition for frequent disruptions. He justifies disruptions in parliament by calling it a legitimate process in a democracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-01-08/news/57838285_1_parliament-disruptions-sitaram-yechury-opposition-parties|title=Government can't blame Opposition for bedlam in Parliament: Sitaram Yechury|work=timesofindia-economictimes}}</ref>

During the negotiations for the [[Indo-US Nuclear Pact]], Yechury listed in the Rajya Sabha all the conditions that the CPM required of the agreement. After the [[Manmohan Singh]] government satisfied all the conditions, he was overruled by [[Prakash Karat]], who claimed that the agreement still violated the CPM's idea of "independent foreign policy". It is said that this left Yechury "displeased and helpless".<ref>{{cite book |last=Baru |first=Sanjaya |authorlink=Sanjaya Baru |title=The Accidental Prime Minister: The Making and Unmaking of Manmohan Singh |publisher=Penguin India |year=2014 |isbn=9789351186380 |pp=226–227|title-link=The Accidental Prime Minister }}</ref>

On 3 March 2015 during parliament session, Yechury moved an amendment to President [[Pranab Mukherjee]]'s address on the inaugural day of Parliament's budget session, which was passed by division of votes in [[Rajya Sabha]] which brought huge embarrassment to the Modi government. Parliamentary affairs minister [[Venkiah Naidu]] stated that Yechury's concern had been noted and requested him to not go ahead with the amendment as this was not a convention. Yechury said normally he would accept such a request, but he was pressing for the amendment as the government left no choice as even after 14 hours of debate, opposition was denied opportunity to seek clarification on the Prime Minister’s reply. This was the fourth time in Rajya Sabha’s history that an amendment moved by the opposition to the motion of thanks to the President’s address had been passed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/opposition-gets-amendment-passed-in-rajya-sabha-embarrassing-government/article6955737.ece|title=Opposition gets amendment passed in Rajya Sabha embarrassing government|date=2015-03-03|work=The Hindu|access-date=2020-02-18|issn=0971-751X}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/president-speech-rajya-sabha-amends-modi-government/1/422077.html|title=Embarrassment for Modi: Rajya Sabha amends note on President's speech|work=intoday.in}}</ref>

===Views on United States===
Yechury is a staunch critic of US foreign policy. He also criticised the visit of the US president [[Barack Obama]] on [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]].<ref name=Zeenews>{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/yechury-criticises-govt-for-inviting-obama-on-republic-day_1530033.html|title=Yechury criticises govt for inviting Obama on Republic Day|work=Zee News|date=14 January 2015}}</ref>

While blaming the US for rise of Islamic fundamentalism he said, "US military interventions in West Asia have created a situation of complete uncertainty.
