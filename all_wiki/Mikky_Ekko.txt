==Early life==
Born John Stephen Sudduth in [[Louisiana]], Mikky Ekko had a restless childhood as the son of a preacher, moving around America's deep south.  Having settled briefly in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], and absorbed as much gospel as he could, he relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, and started playing in bands.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/nov/01/mikky-ekko-pull-me-down|title=New music: Mikky Ekko – Pull Me Down|date=November 1, 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=November 1, 2012|location=London}}</ref> Ekko began working as a songwriter for other artists, but realized that he wanted to be a singer himself. He released his first [[Extended play|EP]] ''Strange Fruit'' (produced by Tim Lauer) on February 15, 2009 containing the first songs he'd written by himself, most of them [[a cappella]]. Ekko says of Nashville:<ref name="Jango">{{cite news|url=http://www.jango.com/music/Mikky+Ekko/_full_bio?l=0|title=Mikky Ekko / Biography|date=December 16, 2012|work=Jango}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.gigwise.com/news/77486/in-demand-mikky-ekko|title=IN DEMAND: MIKKY EKKO|work=Gigwise|accessdate=November 6, 2012}}</ref>  "fortunate to be in a city that's so loving and hospitable." From September 2009, he toured with the Nashville-based collective group [[Ten Out of Tenn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2009/07/ten-out-of-tenn-returns-with-new-lineup/|title=Ten Out of Tenn Return With New Lineup|publisher=American Songwriter|date=July 20, 2009}}</ref>

==Career==
===2008–12: Career beginnings===
In 2009 he partnered with producer Tim Lauer and engineer Dan Hansen to record an a cappella version of "Sedated". That led to his first EP ''Strange Fruit'' which released February 15, 2009.

They worked together to develop the character and sound of Mikky Ekko which led to growing attention in the music business.

"Who Are You, Really?", one of the tracks from ''Reds'', caught the attention of experimental [[hip-hop]] producer [[Clams Casino (musician)|Clams Casino]], who had worked with [[ASAP Rocky]], [[Lil B]] and [[The Weeknd]].<ref name="Guardian"/> It was featured in no less than six TV series episodes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tunefind.com/artist/mikky-ekko|title=Mikki Ekko music on TuneFind|publisher=TuneFind|date=August 14, 2015}}</ref> (Teen Wolf, Ringer, Pretty Little Liars, True Blood, The Blacklist and Reign).
