'''Microsoft Publisher''' is a [[desktop publishing]] application from [[Microsoft]], differing from [[Microsoft Word]] in that the emphasis is placed on page layout and design rather than text composition and proofing.

==Overview==
Publisher is included in higher-end editions of [[Microsoft Office]], reflecting Microsoft's emphasis on the application as an easy-to-use and less expensive alternative to the "heavyweights" with a focus on the small-business market, where firms do not have dedicated design professionals available to make marketing materials and other documents.<ref name= "DTP" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/review/software_and_services/microsoft/office_publisher_07/221175?pf=1 |title=Office Publisher 07 |work=[[PC World]] Australia|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |accessdate=2012-02-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728230637/http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/review/software_and_services/microsoft/office_publisher_07/221175?pf=1 |archivedate=2012-07-28 }}.</ref> However, it has a relatively small share of the desktop publishing market, which is dominated by [[Adobe InDesign]] and formerly by [[QuarkXPress]].<ref name="DTP">{{cite web|url=http://webserver.computoredge.com/editorial/2530/coverprint.htm |title=Desktop Publishing Software 2007 Style |publisher=Computor edge |date=2007-07-27 |accessdate=2012-02-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902044812/http://webserver.computoredge.com/editorial/2530/coverprint.htm |archivedate=2011-09-02 }}</ref>

While most Microsoft Office apps adopted [[ribbon (computing)|ribbons]] for their user interface starting with [[Microsoft Office 2007]], Publisher retained its [[toolbar]]s and did not adopt ribbons until [[Microsoft Office 2010]].<ref name="Office2010UI">{{cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee523661%28v=office.14%29.aspx |title=User interface differences in Office 2010 vs earlier versions |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]] |accessdate=April 22, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412134507/https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee523661(v=office.14).aspx |archivedate=April 12, 2016 }}</ref>

==Compatibility==
[[LibreOffice]] has supported Publisher's [[Proprietary format|proprietary file format]] (.pub) since February 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/4.0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518033343/https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/4.0 |archivedate=2017-05-18 }}</ref> [[Corel Draw]] X4 features read-only support. 

Publisher supports numerous other file formats, including the [[Enhanced Metafile]] (EMF) format, which is supported on Windows platforms. The Microsoft Publisher [[trial version]] can be used to view .pub files beyond the trial period.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/publisher/HA102339061033.aspx | title=Where is the Publisher viewer? | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=November 7, 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316160043/http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/publisher/HA102339061033.aspx | archivedate=March 16, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/where-is-the-publisher-viewer-a5a05230-654f-420e-8aa3-3b50f645c359 | title=Where is the Publisher viewer? | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=March 9, 2020 }}</ref>

[[Adobe PageMaker]] also saved files with a .pub extension, but the two file formats were unrelated and incompatible.
