The '''February 1974 United Kingdom general election''' was held on Thursday, 28 February 1974. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led by Leader of the Opposition and former Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], gained 14 seats (301 total), but was seventeen short of an overall majority. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by incumbent Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], lost 28 seats; but achieved a higher share of the vote than Labour. This resulted in a [[hung parliament]], the first since [[1929 UK general election|1929]]. Heath resigned when he refused to a key term of a possible coalition, and Wilson became Prime Minister for a second time, his first under a minority government. Because Labour was unable to form a majority coalition with another party, Wilson called another early election [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|in September]], which was held in October and resulted in a Labour majority. This was also the first general election to be held with the United Kingdom as a member state of the [[European Communities]] (EC) — widely known as the "Common Market".

This election saw [[Northern Ireland]] diverging heavily from the rest of the United Kingdom, with all twelve candidates elected being from local parties (eleven of them representing unionist parties), following the decision of the [[Ulster Unionists]] to withdraw support from the Conservative Party in protest over the [[Sunningdale Agreement]]. The [[Scottish National Party]] achieved significant success at this election, having increased its share of the popular vote in Scotland from 11% to 22%, and the number of SNP MPs rose from one to 7. [[Plaid Cymru]] also succeeded for the first time in getting candidates elected at a general election in [[Wales]] (it had previously won [[1966 Carmarthen by-election|a by-election in 1966]]).

Although Heath's incumbent Conservative government polled the most votes by a small margin, the Conservatives were overtaken in terms of seats by Wilson's Labour Party, due to a more efficiently-distributed Labour vote and the decision by Ulster Unionist MPs not to take the Conservative [[whip (politics)|whip]].

Both Labour and Conservative lost a considerable share of the popular vote, largely to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] under [[Jeremy Thorpe]]'s leadership, which polled two-and-a-half times its last share of the vote. However, even with over 6,000,000 votes, only fourteen Liberal MPs were elected. There had been some media projections that the Liberals could take twice as many seats.<ref name="BBC Feb '74 Election coverage">{{YouTube |id=_cB6ZxZBcqU |title=BBC Feb '74 Election coverage}}, {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cB6ZxZBcqU |title=Archived copy|access-date=2 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401212030/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cB6ZxZBcqU |archive-date=1 April 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Heath did not resign immediately as Prime Minister. Assuming that Northern Ireland's Unionist MPs could be persuaded to support a Conservative government on confidence matters over one led by Wilson, he entered into negotiations with Thorpe to form a [[coalition government]]. Thorpe, never enthusiastic about supporting the Conservatives, demanded major electoral reforms in exchange for such an agreement. Unwilling to accept such terms, Heath resigned and Wilson returned for his second stint as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].

The election night was covered live on the BBC, and was presented by [[Alastair Burnet]], [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]], [[Robert McKenzie (psephologist)|Robert McKenzie]] and [[Robin Day]].<ref name="BBC Feb '74 Election coverage"/><ref name="bbc-programmes-page">{{citation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00r2f6p |title=Part 1, Election 74 |publisher=BBC Parliament |accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>

Prominent members of Parliament who retired or were defeated at this election included: [[Gordon Campbell (British politician)|Gordon Campbell]], [[Bernadette McAliskey]], [[Enoch Powell]], [[Richard Crossman]], [[Tom Driberg]] and [[Patrick Gordon Walker]]. It was the first of two [[United Kingdom general elections]] held that year, the first to take place after the [[Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities|United Kingdom became a member]] of the [[European Communities]] on 1 January 1973 and the first since [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]] [[hung parliament|not to produce an overall majority]] in the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] for the poll-topping party. This was also the first year in which two general elections were held in the same year since 1910.

==Campaign==
On Thursday 7 February, it was announced that Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] had asked [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]], who was in [[New Zealand]] for the [[1974 British Commonwealth Games]] at the time, to dissolve Parliament, in order for a general election to take place on 28 February. The severe economic circumstances in which the election was held prompted both ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' to characterise it as a "crisis election."{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}}

On 10 February, the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], as expected, went on strike; however, it was more of a low-key affair than the high-profile [[UK miners' strike (1972)|clashes of 1972]], with no violence and only six men on each picket line. [[Jim Prior]] later wrote that the miners had been "as quiet and well-behaved as mice."{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}} The [[three-day week]] continued throughout the election; however, Heath did allow the late-night television curfew to be lifted to allow more coverage of the campaign. The low profile of the miners' strike allowed worries over inflation to dominate the election. On 15 February, it was announced that the [[Retail Price Index]] showed a 20% increase in prices over the previous year.{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}}

On 21 February, the Pay Board released a report on miners' pay, which unexpectedly revealed that they were paid less in comparison with other manufacturing workers, contrary to the claims of the [[National Coal Board]]. This came as a severe blow to the Conservative position, and led to accusations that the National Coal Board did not understand its own pay system and the strike was unnecessary.{{sfn|Taylor|1984|page=258}} Four days later there was further bad news for Heath and his party, with the latest trade figures showing that the [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] deficit for the previous month had been £383,000,000 —the worst in recorded history. Heath claimed the figures confirmed "the gravity of the situation" and the need for a new mandate, prompting [[Roy Jenkins]] to quip: "He [Heath] presumably thinks a still worse result would have given him a still stronger claim."{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}}

One of the most unexpected and explosive events of the campaign was when the outspoken Conservative MP [[Enoch Powell]], who had already announced that he could not stand for re-election on the Conservative manifesto, urged people to vote against Heath, because of the latter's policy toward the [[European Communities]]. In a speech in [[Birmingham]] on 23 February 1974, Powell claimed the main issue in the campaign was whether Britain was to "remain a democratic nation&nbsp;... or whether it will become one province in a new Europe super-state"; he said it was people's "national duty" to oppose those who had deprived Parliament of "its sole right to make the laws and impose the taxes of the country."{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}} This speech prompted ''The Sun'' to run the headline "Enoch puts the boot in." A few days later he said he hoped for victory by "the party which is committed to a fundamental renegotiation of the [[Treaty of Brussels]] and to submitting to the British People&nbsp;... the outcome of that renegotiation." These were the explicit manifesto promises of the Labour Party.{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}}

A further unforeseen blow to the Conservative's campaign came on 26 February when [[Campbell Adamson]], Director-General of the [[Confederation of British Industry]] (CBI), was reported to have called for the repeal of the Heath Government's [[Industrial Relations Act 1971|Industrial Relations Act]], saying that it had "sullied every relationship between employers and unions at national level." Adamson had been closely involved with the Downing Street talks over the mining dispute. Although Heath emphasised that Adamson was voicing a personal opinion and that his views did not express the official position of the CBI, after the election he would acknowledge that this intervention had a negative impact on the Conservative campaign.<ref name="ClarkTimesGuideFeb74">{{cite book |first1=George |last1=Clark |title=The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1974 |date=1974 |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited |location=London |isbn=0-7230-0115-4 |page=28 |chapter=The 'Inevitable' Election}}</ref> Labour meanwhile cited Adamson's comments as proving the need "for everything they (had)... been urging on the Government."<ref name="GH27021974">{{cite news |title=Drop industry Act, urges CBI chief |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19740227&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |accessdate=7 February 2019 |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=27 February 1974 |page=1}}</ref>

===Conservative campaign===
Heath addressed the country on television on the evening of 7 February, and asked: 
{{quote|Do you want a strong Government which has clear authority for the future to take decisions which will be needed? Do you want Parliament and the elected Government to continue to fight strenuously against inflation? Or do you want them to abandon the struggle against rising prices under pressure from one particularly powerful group of workers&nbsp;... This time of strife has got to stop. Only you can stop it. It's time for you to speak—with your vote. It's time for your voice to be heard—the voice of the moderate and reasonable people of Britain: the voice of the majority. It's time for you to say to the extremists, the militants, and the plain and simply misguided: we've had enough. There's a lot to be done. For heaven's sake, let's get on with it.{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}}
}}
The Conservative campaign was, thus, encapsulated by the now-famous phrase "Who governs Britain?"

The party's manifesto, which was largely written by the future Chancellor [[Nigel Lawson]], was entitled ''Firm Action for a Fair Britain'', and was characterised by what historian [[Dominic Sandbrook]] has called "strident rhetoric."{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}} It claimed the Labour opposition had been taken over by "a small group of power-hungry trade union leaders", who were "committed to a left-wing programme more dangerous and more extreme than ever before in its history." It went on to assert that a Labour victory would be a "major national disaster." Sandbrook has criticised that Conservative manifesto as "very vague and woolly", and lacking in "detailed policies or [a] sense of direction."{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}}

Edward Heath played a dominant and crucial role in the campaign. In public he appeared calm and in control; David Watt, in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', called him "statesmanlike" and "relaxed." In his party's final broadcast of the campaign he said: "I'll do all that I can for this country&nbsp;... We've started a job together. With your will, we shall go on and finish the job."{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}}

One Conservative party political broadcast attracted controversy for its ferocity. In the film the narrator warned that Labour would confiscate "your bank account, your mortgage and your wage packet", while pictures of [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] dissolved into those of [[Michael Foot]] and [[Tony Benn]]. It went on to allege that Labour would not have to move much further to the left before "you could find yourself not even owning your own home."{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}} Wilson was reportedly furious, and [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]], the Secretary of State for Energy, made a formal apology.{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}}

===Labour campaign===
The Labour manifesto, ''Let us work together'', consisted of ten pages only - the shortest since [[1955 general election (UK)|1955]]. It had been greatly influenced by the economist [[Stuart Holland]] and Shadow Industry Secretary Tony Benn. In it, Labour promised "a fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people and their families." It advocated planning agreements with industry and the creation of a [[National Enterprise Board]]. This section attracted criticism from some figures within the party. For example, [[Tony Crosland]] privately called the programme "half-baked" and "idiotic." The manifesto also committed the party to renegotiating the terms of Britain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]] and to holding a national referendum on the issue.{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}}

The Labour campaign presented the party's leadership as competent negotiators who would restore peace with the unions. Unlike in previous elections, Wilson took something of a back seat, allowing James Callaghan, [[Denis Healey]] and [[Shirley Williams]] to play equal, if not greater, roles in the campaign. In their final broadcast of the campaign a series of leading figures claimed Labour could put Britain "on the road to recovery." In the film, Wilson asserted: "Trades unionists are people. Employers are people. We can't go on setting one against the other except at the cost of damage to the nation itself."{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}}

===Liberal campaign===
The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] had undergone a revival under the leadership of [[Jeremy Thorpe]], winning a string of by-elections in 1972 and 1973. It had begun to appeal to disaffected Conservative voters, and continued to do so throughout the campaign. Thorpe came across as young and charismatic, often attempting to appear above the two-party fray. Their manifesto ''You can Change the Face of Britain'' promised voting reform and devolution, although Sandbrook has described their economic policy as "impossibly vague."{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}}

=== Position of the press ===
Historian Dominic Sandbrook describes the "level of partisanship" amongst the national newspapers during the election as "unprecedented" in post-war Britain, with most of the media prejudiced in favor of Heath and the Conservatives. The ''Daily Mirror'' was one of the few national newspapers to support Labour, with many others urging their readers to re-elect Heath. In the right-wing media, there was fierce condemnation of Wilson and his party. ''The Sun'', which had supported Labour in 1970, claimed a Labour victory would result in "galloping inflation", while an editorial in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said a Labour government would be "complete ruin public and private", and condemned what it saw as Wilson's "craven subservience to trade union power." The ''[[Evening Standard]]'' published a piece by [[Kingsley Amis]] calling Labour politician Tony Benn, who was to be appointed [[Secretary of State for Industry]] after the election, "the most dangerous man in Britain", while in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' cartoonist Cummings depicted miners' leader [[Joe Gormley (trade unionist)|Joe Gormley]], Wilson and other Labour figures as French revolutionaries [[Guillotine|guillotining]] Heath. ''[[The Guardian]]'', in contrast, chose not to openly support any party. Its columnist [[Peter Jenkins (journalist)|Peter Jenkins]] claimed the last ten years had proved that "neither party" had the ability to deal with the country's problems.{{sfn|Sandbrook|2010|pages=611–645}}

==Economic background==
It was the first general election in the United Kingdom to be held during an economic crisis since the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]], which had been held in the depths of the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge74feb.shtml|title=28 February 1974 |work=BBC Politics 97 |access-date=2 June 2018}}</ref>

==Opinion polls==
Throughout the campaign 25 of the 26 opinion polls had a Conservative lead, at one point even by 9%. Of the six polls on Election Day (28 February), two had a 2% lead, two a 4% lead, one a 3% lead and one a 5% lead.{{sfn|Butler|Kavanagh|1974|page=95}}

==Timeline==
As the Queen was in New Zealand on 7 February, the Prime Minister notified her of his intentions via telegram rather than by the usual protocol of visiting [[Buckingham Palace]]. The key dates were as follows:

This election was fought on new constituency boundaries with five more seats added to the 630 used in 1970. This led to many seats changing hands on the new notional boundaries. [[Notional election results]] from the 1970 general election were calculated on behalf of the BBC by [[Michael Steed]], for the purposes of comparing constituency results for those of February 1974.

For the first time since [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]], the two largest political parties had received less than a combined share of 80% of the vote, and the Liberals had also won more than 10% of the vote.
