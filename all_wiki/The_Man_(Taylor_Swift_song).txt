The song was serviced to US [[Hot adult contemporary|adult contemporary]] and [[Contemporary hit radio|pop]] radio formats on January 27 and 28, 2020, as the fourth and final single from the album''.'' As the fourth track on ''Lover'', Swift wrote and produced the song with [[Joel Little]]. "The Man" is a [[synth-pop]] and [[electropop]] song with flashy harmonies, murky synths and rumbling beats. Over an uptempo production, Swift imagines the media's treatment of her if she were a man. The song received a positive reception from critics, who praised its [[feminism|feminist]] message.

"The Man" peaked at number 23 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the fourth consecutive single from ''Lover'' to peak inside the top-forty of the chart. It entered the top-forty in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Slovakia and the United Kingdom.

An official music video for "The Man" was released on February 27, 2020, directed by Swift herself, marking her solo directorial debut. The [[Satire|satirical]] video sees Swift in her theoretical male [[Alter ego|alter-ego]] named "Tyler Swift", voiced by [[Dwayne Johnson]], presenting several prevalent examples of [[Sexism|sexist]] double standards in society, including [[Sexual objectification|objectification]], [[Sexualization|sexualization of women]], [[toxic masculinity]] and [[patriarchy]].

Brittany Hodak of ''[[Forbes]]'', praised the song as "the most important song she's [Swift has] ever written". She also stated that the song is "a brilliant portrayal of the subtle and not-so-subtle sexism women face every day".<ref name=":6" /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s Raisa Bruner labeled the song as "a bombastic, empowering bop" that is "an anthem for anyone who's felt blocked by [[Double standard#Examples and common issues|sexist double standards]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://time.com/5651207/taylor-swift-lover-songs-explained/|title=Let's Discuss the Lyrics to Every Song on Taylor Swift's Lover|last=Bruner|first=Raisa|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 24, 2019|access-date=November 21, 2019|archive-date=June 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609233017/https://time.com/5651207/taylor-swift-lover-songs-explained/|url-status=live}}</ref> Comparing the song to Swift's 2017 album, [[Rob Sheffield]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described "The Man" as "a righteous [[Feminism|feminist]] bombshell ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' could have used".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-lover-album-rob-sheffield-875724/|title=Why 'Lover' Is the Ultimate Taylor Swift Album|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 23, 2019|access-date=November 21, 2019|archive-date=August 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824114452/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-lover-album-rob-sheffield-875724/|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''{{'}}s Carl Wilson opined that the song "widens the lens and makes a more convincing case for her [Swift's] grievances than on any beefing track she's ever written".

She stated that the entire preparation for the music video—including planning meetings, creating mood boards, scouting locations, and costume and set design—took several months. She also confirmed that there would be many of her trademark "[[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]]" in the video.

=== Synopsis and analysis ===
The [[Satire|satirical]] music video explores Swift's life as her theoretical male counterpart, an [[Alter ego|alter-ego]] named "Tyler Swift". The video presents numerous prevalent examples of double standards in society, and comments on the [[Sexual objectification|objectification]] and [[Sexualization|sexualization of women]], [[toxic masculinity]], [[patriarchy]], as well as performative allyship. Throughout the video, the male version of Swift is seen rudely inconveniencing the people around him, leading a luxurious and promiscuous lifestyle, [[manspreading]], receiving praise for the bare minimum, and throwing [[tantrum]]s without consequences. It contains visual references to ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' (2013), a film involving the lyrically name-checked actor DiCaprio and cinematographer Prieto, and tennis player [[Serena Williams]]' match controversy with a chair umpire at the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open Championships]].<ref name=":1" />

[[File:Tyler Swift manspreading.jpeg|thumb|left|Swift's male alter-ego, Tyler Swift (''middle''), [[manspreading]] on a metro train.|250x250px]]

The video has several easter eggs alluding to Swift's other work, including ''[[Speak Now]]'', ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'', ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' and ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' graffiti on a wall. ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' is written backwards, while the title of her [[Taylor Swift (album)|eponymous debut album]] appears in a sign saying "Missing: If Found Return to Taylor Swift". The "missing" sign, along with another wordless sign that appears to ban riding [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]], references her battle with [[Scooter Braun]] and [[Big Machine Records]] over the ownership of the master recordings of her first six studio albums. ''Lover'', the first album that Swift completely owns herself, is absent, but the word "karma" is written twice on the wall, a possible reference to Swift's plan to re-record her previous works thus lowering the value of the originals. The camera subsequently pans over a "Mr. Americana" poster for a film starring Tyler Swift, directed by Larry Wilson, and premiering at the 2020 Mandance Festival, a [[word play]] on Swift's [[Netflix]] documentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'' directed by [[Lana Wilson]], which debuted at the [[2020 Sundance Film Festival]]. Swift's alter-ego runs down a hallway giving high-fives to nineteen disembodied hands, alluding to double standards behind the [[walk of shame]] that women are often forced to take after a sexual encounter. The hands are said to be a reference to the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th amendment of the United States constitution]], which granted women the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|right to vote]] in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/taylor-swift-the-man-music-video-hidden-details|title=Taylor Swift Just Unveiled Her Self-Directed Music Video For "The Man" And It's Full Of Hidden Details|last=Bate|first=Ellie|website=BuzzFeed|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28|archive-date=February 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228152349/https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/taylor-swift-the-man-music-video-hidden-details|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the final scene, Swift herself appears as the video's director to instruct her male alter-ego to be both "sexier" and "more likeable" in the next take—a subtle dig at the entertainment industry's blatant objectification of and sexist treatment toward women. Ending on messages of female empowerment, Swift then turns to praise Loren Gray for her acting performance as a tennis [[ball boy|ball girl]], despite her role consisting of nothing more than an [[eye-rolling|eye roll]]. The end credits list Swift as the director, writer, owner and star of the music video, Johnson as the voice of "The Man", and shows photos of Swift's transformation process into the male lead of the video. It ends with a [[disclaimer]] stating "No men were harmed in the making of this video".<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/taylor-swift-the-man-music-video-dwayne-johnson-watch.html|title=Taylor Swift Is an Independent Woman Who Didn't Need a Man for 'The Man' Video|last=Haylock|first=Zoe|date=2020-02-27|website=Vulture|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-27|archive-date=February 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227135754/https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/taylor-swift-the-man-music-video-dwayne-johnson-watch.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Critical reception ===
"The Man" music video received critical acclaim upon release, with many commentators complimenting the video's concept, and praising Swift's "unrecognizable" and "award worthy" transformation into the male alter-ego.

Bryan Rolli of ''[[Forbes]]'', highlighted that the video is characterized by an "exaggerated and [[cartoon]]ish" attitude "in a [[Self-awareness|self-aware]] way", typical of Swift's "most memorable videos". He further expanded that "obviously, not every man acts like her [Swift's] character; that's not the point. The point is to make a caricature of the buffoonish men who feel the need to criticize successful women like Swift for merely existing and dissect every public decision they make, whereas their male counterparts would receive praise for the same actions".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2020/02/28/taylor-swifts-the-man-is-the-single-and-video-lover-deserved/|title=Taylor Swift's 'The Man' Is The Single (And Video) 'Lover' Deserved|last=Rolli|first=Bryan|website=Forbes|language=en|date=February 28, 2020|access-date=February 29, 2020|archive-date=February 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228222451/https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2020/02/28/taylor-swifts-the-man-is-the-single-and-video-lover-deserved/|url-status=live}}</ref> Avery Blank, also writing for ''Forbes'', opined that the video is a "reminder that women continue to face challenges when it comes to owning their ideas and maintaining control over their own careers" and that the society "expects women to be team players and not worry about getting credit for their work". She further added that the video makes it clear to viewers that Swift "will not let people mess with her".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/averyblank/2020/03/02/taylor-swift-shows-how-women-can-take-ownership-of-their-work/|title=Taylor Swift Shows How Women Can Take Ownership Of Their Work|last=Blank|first=Avery|website=Forbes|language=en|date=March 2, 2020|access-date=March 2, 2020|archive-date=March 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302145811/https://www.forbes.com/sites/averyblank/2020/03/02/taylor-swift-shows-how-women-can-take-ownership-of-their-work/|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]''<nowiki/>'s Chloe Laws wrote that the "empowering" video "calls out [[sexism]] and the industry's double standards", which is "a small part of the bigger journey she's [Swift is] embarked on lately", by "refusing to let someone else control her narrative".<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/taylor-swift-the-man-video|title=Taylor Swift's 'The Man' calls out sexism and the industry's double standards and it's the empowering video we need RN|last=Laws|first=Chloe|website=Glamour UK|date=February 27, 2020|access-date=February 27, 2020}}</ref> ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]''{{'s}} Constance Grady opined that Swift is "one of our great pop storytellers", proved by the video that becomes "the climax of her quest to own her voice".<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/2/27/21155844/taylor-swift-the-man-video|title=Taylor Swift's "The Man" video is the climax of her quest to own her voice|last=Grady|first=Constance|date=February 27, 2020|website=Vox|language=en|access-date=February 27, 2020|archive-date=February 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227163649/https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/2/27/21155844/taylor-swift-the-man-video|url-status=live}}</ref>

They added that Swift takes aim at "the cultural norms that allow, and at times even encourage, men to develop overinflated egos".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/02/28/the-man-taylor-swift/|title=What Taylor Swift wants you to see in 'The Man,' her gender-bending takedown of the patriarchy|last1=Shepherd|first1=Katie|last2=Chiu|first2=Allyson|date=February 28, 2020|website=The Washington Post|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=February 29, 2020|archive-date=February 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228225529/https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/02/28/the-man-taylor-swift/}}</ref> ''[[Fast Company]]'''s Starr Rocque stated that Swift "examines the ridiculousness of [[gender role]]s and weaves that into a [[Satire|satirical]] spin on her own personal experiences and observations", adding that Swift "catches a lot of flack, but she's a fighter and always true to her brand of [[Women's empowerment|female empowerment]]".<ref name=":5" />

==Lyric video==
An [[Animation|animated]] lyric video for the song was released on February 7, 2020, exploring visual themes of women empowerment, feminism and [[occupational sexism|workplace sexism]].

[[File:Impossible staircase.svg|right|thumb|[[Penrose stairs]] are incorporated into the lyric video to portray the never-ending difficulties faced by women in the [[Corporation|corporate]] world.|alt=A staircase in a square format. The stairs make four 90-degree turns in each corner, so they are in the format of a continuous loop.]]

The video depicts a [[power dressing|power suit]]-wearing woman, the only female figure in a maze-like city full of taller and larger [[corporatism|corporate]] male drones, as she tries to navigate through [[Penrose stairs|staircases that lead to nowhere]]. She is forced to run past the sauntering men to avoid getting trampled. When the woman finally reaches the top of a building, symbolizing her climb up the corporate ladder, the male drones push her off and leave her to freefall to death; thankfully, she is caught by another, benevolent, giant woman and shown to a place where all the women walk together in solidarity towards the city. The ending of the video implies that the true key to success for women is to lift each other up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/taylor-swift-confronts-sexism-animated-182931790.html|title=Taylor Swift Confronts Sexism in Animated 'The Man' Lyric Video|website=news.yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-08|archive-date=February 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227232521/https://news.yahoo.com/taylor-swift-confronts-sexism-animated-182931790.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-the-man-lyric-video-949495/|title=Taylor Swift Confronts Sexism in Animated 'The Man' Lyric Video|last=Shaffer|first=Claire|date=February 7, 2020|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=February 9, 2020|archive-date=February 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208142654/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-the-man-lyric-video-949495/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/p/taylor-swifts-the-man-lyric-video-takes-on-workplace-sexism-21787166|title=Taylor Swift's "The Man" Lyric Video Takes On Workplace Sexism|last=Garrison|first=Cianna|date=February 8, 2020|magazine=[[Elite Daily]]|access-date=February 9, 2020|archive-date=February 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200209140738/https://www.elitedaily.com/p/taylor-swifts-the-man-lyric-video-takes-on-workplace-sexism-21787166|url-status=live}}</ref>

Truss stated: "And so that, in the words of the brilliant Taylor Swift in her new song, 'women are left running as fast as they can, wondering if they'd get there quicker if they were a man'."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insider.com/british-politician-quotes-taylor-swift-on-international-womens-day-2020-3|title=A British politician quoted Taylor Swift's 'The Man' during an International Women's Day debate in Parliament|last=Peppin|first=Hayley|website=Insider|language=en|date=March 9, 2020|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>

American journalist [[Jody Rosen]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', listed "The Man" as one of the "25 songs that matter now". Describing Swift as "pop's best humblebraggart", Rosen termed "The Man" as a "sly [[protest song]]", explaining that Swift "has been pop's top bellyacher, turning a now-familiar set of grievances into great songs". He added that Swift "channels that indignation into a broader protest against the sexism and skepticism that all women face". Rosen also opined that the song's "most hard-hitting line is a plaintive rhetorical question that calls to mind a [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]] slogan: [[Believe women|#BelieveWomen]]".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rosen|first=Jody|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/magazine/best-songs.html|title=25 Songs That Matter Now|date=March 12, 2020|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=March 16, 2020|url-status=live|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=March 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200315234143/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/magazine/best-songs.html}}</ref> Naming "The Man" as the "most important" song Swift has ever written, Brittany Hodak of ''[[Forbes]]'', commended that "the magic of "The Man" is not just that it captures a complex (and often misunderstood) issue so brilliantly and simply, but also that it conveys to Swift's female fans that even she isn't above the BS that so many of us are regularly subjected to". Hodak concluded that she is "hopeful that Swift’s spotlight on the issue will spark a national conversation about [[sexism]], [[Power (social and political)|power]], and equality".<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brittanyhodak/2019/08/23/lover-offers-the-most-important-song-taylor-swift-has-ever-written/|title=Why 'Lover' Track 'The Man' Is The Most Important Song Taylor Swift Has Ever Written|last=Hodak|first=Brittany|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04|archive-date=November 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110124911/https://www.forbes.com/sites/brittanyhodak/2019/08/23/lover-offers-the-most-important-song-taylor-swift-has-ever-written/|url-status=live}}</ref>
