Present-day Springfield was settled by European Americans in the late 1810s, around the time Illinois became a state. The most famous historic resident was [[Abraham Lincoln]], who lived in Springfield from 1837 until 1861, when he went to the [[White House]] as [[President of the United States]]. Major tourist attractions include multiple sites connected with Lincoln including the [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum]], [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site]], [[Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices State Historic Site]], and the [[Lincoln Tomb]] at [[Oak Ridge Cemetery]].

The city lies in a valley and plain near the [[Sangamon River]]. [[Lake Springfield]], a large artificial lake owned by the [[City Water, Light & Power]] company (CWLP), supplies the city with recreation and drinking water. Weather is fairly typical for middle latitude locations, with four distinct seasons, including, hot summers and cold winters. Spring and summer weather is like that of most midwestern cities; severe thunderstorms may occur. Tornadoes hit the Springfield area in 1957 and [[March 2006 tornado outbreak sequence|2006]].

The city has a [[Mayor–council government|mayor–council]] form of government and governs the [[#Township|Capital Township]].  The [[Government of Illinois|government of the state of Illinois]] is based in Springfield. State government institutions include the [[Illinois General Assembly]], the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] and the Office of the [[Governor of Illinois]]. There are three public and three private high schools in Springfield. [[Public school (government funded)|Public schools]] in Springfield are operated by District No. 186. Springfield's economy is dominated by government jobs, plus the related lobbyists and firms that deal with the state and county governments and justice system, and health care and medicine.

==History==
<!-- {{Main|History of Springfield, Illinois}} -->
Springfield was originally named "Calhoun,” after Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] of [[South Carolina]].<ref name="Callhoun">[http://www.usacitiesonline.com/ilcountyspringfield.htm#history Springfield history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103004432/http://www.usacitiesonline.com/ilcountyspringfield.htm#history |date=2007-01-03 }} Retrieved on February 21, 2007</ref> The land that Springfield now occupies was settled first by trappers and [[fur traders]] who came to the [[Sangamon River]] in 1818.<ref name="Quincynet.com">{{citation <!--EXISTING REFERENCE--> |url=http://www.quincynet.com/daytrips/springfieldNOlincoln/index.htm |title=Springfield, Illinois |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401190814/http://www.quincynet.com/daytrips/springfieldNOlincoln/index.htm |archive-date=2012-04-01 |access-date=2017-03-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The first cabin was built in 1820, by John Kelly. It was located at what is now the northwest corner of Second Street and Jefferson Street. In 1821, Calhoun was designated as the county seat of Sangamon County due to fertile soil and trading opportunities.

Settlers from [[Kentucky]], [[Virginia]], and [[North Carolina]] came to the developing city.<ref name="Quincynet.com" /> By 1832, Senator Calhoun had fallen out of the favor with the public and the town renamed itself as Springfield.<ref name="Visit Springfield">{{citation <!--EXISTING REFERENCE--> |url=http://www.visit-springfieldillinois.com/About/Sketch.asp |title= A Brief Sketch of Springfield, Illinois |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305143316/http://www.visit-springfieldillinois.com/About/Sketch.asp|archive-date=2012-03-05 |access-date=2017-03-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  According to local history, the name was suggested by the wife of John Kelly, after Spring Creek, which ran through the area known as "Kelly's Field".<ref>John C.

[[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]] was the first capital of the Illinois Territory from its organization in 1809, continuing through statehood in 1818, and through the first year as a state in 1819. [[Vandalia, Illinois|Vandalia]] was the second state capital of Illinois from 1819 to 1839. Springfield became the third and current capital of Illinois in 1839. The designation was largely due to the efforts of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his associates; nicknamed the "Long Nine" for their combined height of {{convert|54|ft|m}}.<ref name="Quincynet.com" /><ref name="Visit Springfield" />

The [[Potawatomi Trail of Death]] passed through here in 1838, as the Native Americans were forced west to Indian Territory by the government's [[Indian Removal]] policy.

===Lincoln===

====Lincoln and politics====
Lincoln arrived in the Springfield area when he was a young man in 1831, though he did not live in the city until 1837.<ref name=amer/> He spent the ensuing six years in [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem]], where he began his legal studies, joined the [[state militia]] and was elected to the [[Illinois General Assembly]]. In 1837 Lincoln moved to Springfield and spent the next 24 years as a lawyer and politician. Lincoln delivered his [[Abraham Lincoln's Lyceum address|Lyceum address]] in Springfield. His farewell speech when he left for Washington is a classic in American oratory.<ref name=amer>{{Cite journal|title=Springfield, Illinois|journal=American History|volume=32 |issue=4|page=60|date=September–October 1997|url=http://www.ulib.niu.edu:4513/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=9710070017&site=ehost-live| issn =1076-8866}}, Academic Search Premier, ([[EBSCO]]). {{dead link|date=March 2017}}</ref>

Winkle (1998) examines the historiography concerning the development of the [[Second Party System]] (Whigs versus Democrats) and applies these ideas to the study of Springfield, a strong Whig enclave in a Democratic region. He chiefly studied poll books for presidential years. The rise of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] took place in 1836 in opposition to the presidential candidacy of [[Martin Van Buren]] and was consolidated in 1840. Springfield Whigs tend to validate several expectations of party characteristics as they were largely native-born, either in New England or Kentucky, professional or agricultural in occupation, and devoted to partisan organization. Abraham Lincoln's career reflects the Whigs' political rise, but by the 1840s, Springfield began to be dominated by Democratic politicians. Waves of new European immigrants changed the city's demographics and became aligned with the Democrats. By the 1860 presidential election, Lincoln was barely able to win his home city.<ref>Winkle, (1998)</ref>

====Population====
Winkle (1992) examines the impact of migration on political participation in Springfield during the 1850s. Widespread migration in the 19th-century United States produced frequent population turnover within Midwestern communities, which influenced patterns of voter turnout and office-holding. Examination of the manuscript census, poll books, and office-holding records reveals the effects of migration on the behavior and voting patterns of 8,000 participants in 10 elections in Springfield. Most voters were short-term residents who participated in only one or two elections during the 1850s. Fewer than 1% of all voters participated in all 10 elections. Instead of producing political instability, however, rapid turnover enhanced the influence of the more stable residents. Migration was selective by age, occupation, wealth, and birthplace. Longer-term or persistent voters, as he terms them, tended to be wealthier, more highly skilled, more often native-born, and socially more stable than non-persisters. Officeholders were particularly persistent and socially and economically advantaged. Persisters represented a small "core community" of economically successful, socially homogeneous, and politically active voters and officeholders who controlled local political affairs, while most residents moved in and out of the city. Members of a tightly knit and exclusive "core community", exemplified by Abraham Lincoln, blunted the potentially disruptive impact of migration on local communities.<ref>Kenneth J. Winkle, "The Voters of Lincoln's Springfield: Migration and Political Participation in an Antebellum City." ''Journal of Social History'' 1992 25(3): 595–611. {{ISSN|0022-4529}} Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]</ref>

====Business====
The case of John Williams illustrates the important role of the merchant banker in the economic development of central Illinois before the Civil War. Williams began his career as a clerk in frontier stores and saved to begin his own business. Later, in addition to operating retail and wholesale stores, he acted as a local banker and then organized a national bank in Springfield. He was active in railroad promotion and as an agent for farm machinery.<ref>Robert E., Coleberd, Jr. "John Williams: a Merchant Banker in Springfield, Illinois." ''Agricultural History'' 1968 42(3): 259–265. {{ISSN|0002-1482}}</ref>

====Religion====
During the mid-19th century, the spiritual needs of German [[Lutherans]] in the Midwest were not being tended. As a result of the efforts of such missionaries as Friedrich Wyneken, Wilhelm Loehe, and Wilhelm Sihler, additional Lutheran ministers were sent to the Midwest, Lutheran schools were opened, and [[Concordia Theological Seminary]] was founded in [[Ft. Wayne, Indiana]] in 1846. The seminary moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in 1869, and then to Springfield in 1874. During the last half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] succeeded in serving the spiritual needs of Midwestern congregations by establishing additional seminaries from ministers trained at Concordia, and by developing a viable synodical tradition.<ref>Roger Howard Dallmann, "Springfield Seminary." ''Concordia Historical Institute Quarterly'' 1977 50(3): 106–130. {{ISSN|0010-5260}}</ref>

===Civil War to 1900===

[[File:Gfp-illinois-springfield-capitol-and-sky.jpg|thumb|Present Capitol building, built c. 1868–1888]]

Springfield became a major center of activity during the American Civil War. Illinois regiments trained there, the first ones under [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. He led his soldiers to a remarkable series of victories in 1861–62. The city was a political and financial center of Union support. New industries, businesses, and railroads were constructed to help support the war effort.<ref name="Visit Springfield" />  The war's first official death was a Springfield resident, Colonel [[Elmer E. Ellsworth]].

Camp Butler, located seven miles (11&nbsp;km) northeast of Springfield, Illinois, opened in August 1861 as a training camp for Illinois soldiers. It also served as a camp for Confederate prisoners of war through 1865. In the beginning, Springfield residents visited the camp to take part in the excitement of a military venture, but many reacted sympathetically to mortally wounded and ill prisoners. While the city's businesses prospered from camp traffic, drunken behavior and rowdiness on the part of the soldiers stationed there strained relations as neither civil nor military authorities proved able to control disorderly outbreaks.<ref>Camilla A. Quinn, "Soldiers on Our Streets: the Effects of a Civil War Military Camp on the Springfield Community." ''Illinois Historical Journal'' 1993 86(4): 245–256. {{ISSN|0748-8149}}</ref>

After the war ended in 1865, Springfield became a major hub in the Illinois railroad system. It was a center of government and farming, and by 1900 was invested in coal mining and processing.<ref name="Visit Springfield" />

===20th century===

====Utopia====
Local poet [[Vachel Lindsay]]'s notions of utopia were expressed in his only novel, ''The Golden Book of Springfield'' (1920), which draws on ideas of [[Social anarchism|anarchistic socialism]] in projecting the progress of Lindsay's hometown toward utopia.<ref>Ron Sakolsky, "Utopia at Your Doorstep: Vachel Lindsay's Golden Book of Springfield." ''Utopian Studies'' 2001 12(2): 53–64. {{ISSN|1045-991X}} Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]</ref>

The [[Dana–Thomas House]] is a [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] design built in 1902–03. Wright began work on the house in 1902. Commissioned by Susan Lawrence Dana, a local patron of the arts and public benefactor, Wright designed a house to harmonize with the owner's devotion to the performance of music. Coordinating art glass designs for 250&nbsp;windows, doors, and panels as well as over 200 light fixtures, Wright enlisted Oak Park artisans. The house is a radical departure from [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] architectural traditions. Covering {{convert|12000|sqft|m2}}, the house contained vaulted ceilings and 16 major spaces. As the nation was changing, so Wright intended this structure to reflect the changes. Creating an organic and natural atmosphere, Wright saw himself as an "architect of democracy" and intended his work to be a monument to America's social landscape.<ref name="Hallmark"/>

It is the only historic site later acquired by the state exclusively because of its architectural merit. The structure was opened to the public as a museum house in September 1990; tours are available, 9:00&nbsp;a.m.–4:00&nbsp;p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays.<ref name="Hallmark">Donald P.

====1908 race riot====
{{main|Springfield race riot of 1908}}
Sparked by the alleged rape of a white woman by a black man and the murder of a white engineer, supposedly also by a black man, in Springfield, and reportedly angered by the high degree of corruption in the city, rioting broke out on August 14, 1908, and continued for three days in a period of violence known as the [[Springfield race riot of 1908|Springfield race riot]]. Gangs of white youth and blue-collar workers attacked the predominantly black areas of the city known as the Levee district, where most black businesses were located, and the Badlands, where many black residences stood. Two blacks were lynched and four whites were killed by gunfire when black property-owners sought to defend their homes and businesses. The riot ended when the governor sent in more than 3,700 militiamen to patrol the city, but isolated incidents of white violence against blacks continued in Springfield into September.<ref>Chicago Commission on Race Relations (1919); Crouthamel (1960); Senechal (1990)</ref>

==Cityscape==
Springfield proper is greatly based on a grid street system, with numbered streets starting with the longitudinal First Street (which leads to the Illinois State Capitol) and leading to 32nd Street in the far eastern part of the city. Previously, the city had four distinct boundary streets: North, South, East, and West Grand Avenues. Since expansion, West Grand Avenue became MacArthur Boulevard and East Grand became 19th Street on the north side and 18th Street on the south side. 18th Street has since been renamed after [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] <ref>https://sangamoncountyhistory.org/wp/?p=2166</ref> North and South Grand Avenues (which run east–west) have remained important corridors in the city. At South Grand Avenue and Eleventh Street, the old "South Town District" lies, with the City of Springfield undertaking a significant redevelopment project there.

Latitudinal streets range from names of presidents in the downtown area to names of notable people in Springfield and Illinois to names of institutions of higher education, especially in the Harvard Park neighborhood.

Springfield has at least twenty separately designated [[neighborhood]]s, though not all are incorporated with associations. They include: Benedictine District, Bunn Park, the Cabbage Patch, Downtown, Eastsview, Enos Park, Glen Aire, Harvard Park, Hawthorne Place, Historic West Side, Laketown, Lincoln Park, Mather and Wells, Medical District, Near South, Northgate, Oak Ridge, Old Aristocracy Hill, Pillsbury District, Shalom, Springfield Lakeshore, [[Toronto, Illinois|Toronto]], Twin Lakes, UIS Campus, Victoria Lake, Vinegar Hill, and Westchester neighborhoods.<ref name=neigh>[http://www.springfield.il.us/Oped/neighborhoods.htm Neighborhood Associations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212190831/http://www.springfield.il.us/Oped/neighborhoods.htm |date=2007-02-12 }}, Office of Planning & Economic Development, City of Springfield.

Historically, Springfield has been home to a number of [[minor league baseball]] franchises, the latest club, the college-prep [[Springfield Sliders]], arriving in the city in 2008. In the 1948 baseball season, Springfield was also home to an [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] team, the [[Springfield Sallies]], but the team's lackluster performance led them to be folded in with the [[Chicago Colleens]] as rookie development teams the following year.

The city was the home of the [[Springfield Stallions]], an [[Indoor American football|indoor football]] team who played at the [[Prairie Capital Convention Center]] in 2007. Today, the city is host to the [[Springfield Jr. Blues]], a North American Hockey League team that plays at the Nelson Recreation Center. The city is also a host to several Semi Pro Football Teams. The oldest organization is the Capital City Outlaws, which was established in 1992. The Outlaws which played 11 man football, most recently in The Midwest Football League until 2004, switched to an 8-man Semi Pro Football League (8FL) in 2004. The Sangamon County Seminoles became an expansion team in the 8FL in 2008. A newly formed team in 2010, the Springfield Foxes, play in the Mid States Football League (MSFL) (11 man). The Foxes were league runners-up in the MSFL League Championship in 2012.

{{Asof|2020}} none of the major constitutional officers in Illinois designated Springfield as their primary residence; most cabinet officers and all major constitutional officers instead primarily do their business in Chicago. A former director of the [[Southern Illinois University]] Paul Simon Institute for Public Affairs, Mike Lawrence, stated that many of the elected officials in Illinois "spend so little time in Springfield".<ref name=INN/> In 2012 ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' columnist Pat Gauen argued that  "in the reality of Illinois politics, [Springfield] shares [[de facto]] capital status with Chicago." Gauen noted that several elected officials such as the [[Governor of Illinois|Governor]], as well as the [[Attorney General of Illinois|Attorney General]], Speaker of the [[Illinois House of Representatives|House]], the minority leader of the House, President of the [[Illinois Senate|Senate]], the minority leader of the Senate, the Comptroller, and the Treasurer, all live in the [[Chicago area]]. According to Gauen, "Everybody who's anybody in Illinois government has an office in Chicago"; most state officials work from the [[James R. Thompson Center]] in the Chicago Loop. He added that at one point in 2011, Governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] only spent 68 days and 40 nights in Springfield as per his official schedule.<ref name=Gauen/> [[University of Illinois]] researcher and former member of the Illinois legislature [[Jim Nowlan]] stated "It's almost like Chicago is becoming the shadow capital of Illinois" and that "Springfield is almost become a hinterland outpost."<ref name=INN/> Lawrence criticized the fact that state officials spent little time in Springfield since it estranged them from and devalued Illinois state employees based in that city.<ref name=INN/>

According to Gauen, "Illinois seems rather unlikely to move its official capital to Chicago".<ref name=Gauen/>

===Township===
[[File:Map highlighting Capital Township, Sangamon County, Illinois.svg|thumb|right|Outline of the Township area and the City of Springfield in Sangamon County]]
The Capital Township formed from [[Springfield Township, Sangamon County, Illinois|Springfield Township]] on July 1, 1877, and was established and named by the Sangamon County Board on March 6, 1878.  The limits of the township and City of Springfield were made co-extensive on February 17, 1892, but are no longer so with subsequent annexation by the City of Springfield. There are three functions of this township: assessing property, collection first property tax payment, and assisting residents that live in the township. One thing that makes the Capital township unique is that the township never has to raise taxes for road work, since the roads are maintained by the Springfield Department of Public Works.<ref name="Capital Township">[http://captwnshp.co.sangamon.il.us Capital Township] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208115712/http://captwnshp.co.sangamon.il.us/ |date=2007-02-08 }}, Official site.
