The '''2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference''', also known as '''COP25''', is the 25th [[United Nations Climate Change conference]]. It was held in [[Madrid]], Spain, from 2 to 13 December 2019 under the presidency of the Chilean government. The conference incorporated the 25th [[Conference of the parties|Conference of the Parties]] to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), the 15th meeting of the parties to the [[Kyoto Protocol]] ('''CMP15'''), and the second meeting of the parties to the [[Paris Agreement]] ('''CMA2''').

==Prelude==
The conference was planned to be held in Brazil in November 2019, but a year before the planned start, newly-elected President [[Jair Bolsonaro]] withdrew the offer to host the event, citing economic reasons.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/world/americas/brazil-climate-meeting.html |title=Brazil Backs Out of Hosting 2019 Climate Change Meeting |work=[[New York Times]] |language=en |author-first1=Ernesto |author-last1=Londoño |author-first2=Lisa |author-last2=Friedman |date=28 November 2018 |access-date=16 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815122154/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/world/americas/brazil-climate-meeting.html |archive-date=15 August 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Then Chile stepped up and became the new host, but [[2019 Chilean protests|social unrest]] in the lead-up to the meeting forced it late October 2019 to withdraw from hosting.<ref>{{cite news |author-last1=Londoño |author-first1=Ernesto |author-last2=Sengupta |author-first2=Somini |date=30 October 2019 |title=Chile, Rocked by Unrest, Withdraws From Hosting Climate and Trade Summits |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/world/americas/chile-cop25-apec.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=1 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031171248/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/world/americas/chile-cop25-apec.html |archive-date=31 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Then by mutual agreement between the UN, Chile, and Spain, the latter became the new host.<ref>{{cite news |author-last=Sengupta |author-first=Somini |date=31 October 2019 |title=Spain Agrees to Host Key Climate Talks After Chile Pulls Out |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/climate/spain-chile-cop25-climate-meeting.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031220450/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/climate/spain-chile-cop25-climate-meeting.html |archive-date=31 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Various climate activists had set out from Europe to South America by sailboat, before the decision had been taken to relocate COP25 to Madrid. In mid-November, some of these activists joined an alternative conference, the "Forest COP", near the centre of the [[Amazon jungle]], in [[Terra do Meio Ecological Station|Terra do Meio]]. The event was attended by indigenous leaders, scientists and academics such as [[Eduardo Góes Neves]], and activists such as [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]]. After the Forest COP, a follow-on event, "''Amazônia Centro do Mundo''" (Amazon: The Centre of the World) took place on 17 November in nearby [[Altamira, Pará|Altamira]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/15/a-journey-to-the-centre-of-the-amazon-in-radical-bid-to-solve-climate-crisis |title=Activists hold climate conference deep in the Amazon rainforest |work=[[The Guardian]] |author-first=Jonathan |author-last=Watts |author-link=Jonathan Watts |date=15 November 2019 |access-date=18 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/17/amazon-rain-forest-protest-climate-crisis |title=The Amazon: on the frontline of a global battle to tackle the climate crisis |work=[[The Guardian]] |author-first=Jonathan |author-last=Watts |author-link=Jonathan Watts |date=17 November 2019 |access-date=18 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/11/15/opinion/1573820553_621324.html |title=Amazônia Centro do Mundo |work=[[El País]] |author-first=Eliane |author-last=Brum |date=15 November 2019 |access-date=18 November 2019}}</ref>

==Event planning==
In November, [[Teresa Ribera]], the Spanish [[Ministry for the Ecological Transition|Minister for the Ecological Transition]], announced the conference would be held at the [[IFEMA]] facilities in Madrid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://cadenaser.com/programa/2019/11/01/hora_25/1572639592_285846.html |publisher=[[Cadena SER]] |date=1 November 2019 |title=Teresa Ribera desvela que IFEMA es el lugar elegido para la Cumbre del Clima |website=cadenaser.com}}</ref> The Spanish government divided the COP25 into two zones, one blue and one green.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/cambio-climatico/temas/cop25/ |publisher=[[Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica]] |title=25ª Conferencia de las Partes de la Convención Marco de Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático (COP25)}}</ref> The blue zone hosted sessions for negotiation between the parties of the COP. This included the 15th session of the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol and the 2nd session of the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement. The blue zone also hosted events and activities run by [[NGO]] actors and side events organized by states other than Spain. The green zone was dedicated to civil society initiatives aiming to promote social participation. This area was divided into three thematic sub-zones: one involving youth events, the second designated to indigenous peoples, and the third focused on science and innovation. The green zone was intended to be an open-dialogue pavilion for all types of civil actors, ranging from NGOs to businesses, academia and sponsors.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ambientum.com/ambientum/cambio-climatico/quieres-participar-en-la-zona-verde-de-la-cop25.asp |publisher=Ambientum |title=¿Quieres participar en la Zona Verde de la COP25? |access-date=28 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202222056/https://www.ambientum.com/ambientum/cambio-climatico/quieres-participar-en-la-zona-verde-de-la-cop25.asp |archive-date=2 December 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Participants==
Harjeet Singh, of environmental group ActionAid International, said that moving the summit from Chile to Spain with only four weeks' notice presented "real barriers to participation" for delegates from the southern hemisphere.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/03/greta-thunberg-asks-for-lift-back-across-atlantic-as-climate-meeting-shifts-to-madrid |title=Greta Thunberg asks for lift back across Atlantic as climate meeting shifts to Madrid |author=<!-- staff writer --> |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=3 November 2019 |access-date=3 November 2019}}</ref>

In August 2019, youth climate change activist [[Greta Thunberg]] and her father [[Svante Thunberg|Svante]] sailed from [[Plymouth, England]] across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Americas]] in sailboat ''[[Malizia II]]'' to participate in the [[2019 UN Climate Action Summit|UN Climate Action Summit]] in [[New York City]] in September. At that time it was not clear how she was going to return to Europe, but she was planning to go on to Chile for the conference.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/greta-thunberg-sailing-boat-climate-change-un-summits-new-york-santiago-a9058541.html |title=Greta Thunberg sets sail from UK on two-week journey aboard high-tech yacht to reach climate summits |publisher=Independent |language=en |author-first=Zoe |author-last=Tidman |date=14 August 2019 |access-date=16 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815165323/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/greta-thunberg-sailing-boat-climate-change-un-summits-new-york-santiago-a9058541.html |archive-date=15 August 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> 
With the move of the conference to Madrid, the need to return to Europe became more urgent. Teresa Ribera, as Spain's environment minister, offered her help in finding a way to travel to the conference.<ref>{{cite news |author-last=Rosan |author-first=Olivia |title=It's Official: Madrid Will Host COP25 |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/madrid-host-cop25-chile-2641211571.html |access-date=5 November 2019 |agency=Ecowatch |date=4 November 2019}}</ref> Riley Whitelum and his wife, Elayna Carausu, two Australians who had been sailing around the world aboard their {{convert|48|ft|m|adj=on}} catamaran, ''[[Sailing La Vagabonde|La Vagabonde]]'', took Thunberg  back across the Atlantic. On 13 November 2019, Thunberg set sail from [[Hampton, VA|Hampton]], Virginia for Lisbon, Portugal.

Speaker of the US House of Representatives [[Nancy Pelosi]] led a 15-member Congressional delegation to the talks to demonstrate continued U.S. support for the negotiations, despite the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration's]] decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/02/pelosi-to-climate-conference-were-still-in-paris-agreement-074756 |title=Pelosi to climate conference: 'We're still in' Paris agreement |author-last=Wolff |author-first=Eric |website=POLITICO |language=en |access-date=16 December 2019}}</ref>

Ecuadorian environmental activist [[Helena Gualinga]] participated. She spoke about her concern on the Ecuadorian government authorizing oil extraction in indigenous land. She said: "Our country's government is still granting our territories to the corporations responsible of climate change. This is criminal." She criticized the Ecuadorian government for claiming interest in protecting the Amazon during the conference instead of attending indigenous Amazon women's demands brought to the government during the [[2019 Ecuadorian protests]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.elcomercio.com/tendencias/helena-gualinga-sarayaku-ecuador-cop25.html|title=La adolescente Helena Gualinga, activista del pueblo Sarayaku, arremetió contra el Gobierno de Ecuador en la COP25 de Madrid|date=11 December 2019|website=El Comercio|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212103032/https://www.elcomercio.com/tendencias/helena-gualinga-sarayaku-ecuador-cop25.html|archive-date=12 December 2019|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref> She also expressed her disappointment towards world leaders' lack of interest to discuss topics brought by indigenous peoples to the conference.<ref name=":2" />

The last part of the Paris regime that remains to be resolved is ''Article 6'', which describes rules for a [[carbon market]] and other forms of international cooperation. In the [[COP24]] conference no agreement could be reached on this topic. Several politically difficult decisions have to be made for this article. Negative emissions could be traded under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to offset emissions by developed countries, but many of these negative emission projects would have happened anyway without the extra incentive from the Kyoto Protocol, so that this mechanism was described as 'hot air'. International trading of carbon can make overall [[Climate change mitigation|emission cuts]] cheaper. If negotiations about this fail, it will come up again in 2020's COP26<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-q-and-a-how-article-6-carbon-markets-could-make-or-break-the-paris-agreement |title=In-depth Q&A: How 'Article 6' carbon markets could 'make or break' the Paris Agreement |author-last1=Evans |author-first1=Simon |author-last2=Gabbattis |author-first2=Josh |date=29 November 2019 |website=Carbon Brief |language=en |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> (postponed to 2021).<ref name="govuk-newdates">{{cite web|date=28 May 2020|title=New dates agreed for COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-dates-agreed-for-cop26-united-nations-climate-change-conference|website=gov.uk}}</ref>

According to scientists, talks focused on some of the rules for implementing the 2015 Paris agreement, but the overriding issue of how fast the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions has received little official attention. Urgent UN talks on tackling the climate emergency are still not addressing the true scale of the crisis, one of the world’s leading climate scientists has warned.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/08/un-climate-talks-are-failing-to-see-urgency-of-crisis-says-scientist UN climate talks failing to address urgency of crisis, says top scientist] [[The Guardian]], 2019-12-08</ref>

On the other side, the [[European Union]] reached an agreement about The [[European Green Deal]] that should lower its emissions to zero by 2050.<ref>{{cite news |author-last=Davidson |author-first=Jordan |title=COP25 Ends With a Whimper: A Few Takeaways |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/cop25-results-failure-2641606525.html |access-date=18 December 2019 |agency=Ecowatch |date=2019-12-16}}</ref> Also, many commitments were made by countries, cities, businesses and international coalitions.
