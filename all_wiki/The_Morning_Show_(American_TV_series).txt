 |ShortSummary    = ''The Morning Show'', a popular news and talk morning television show, is thrown into chaos when co-anchor Mitch Kessler is fired amid allegations of sexual harassment. Fellow anchor Alex Levy grows furious at Mitch and the network for keeping her in the dark and later meets with Mitch, who reveals the network plans on replacing her. Elsewhere, conservative reporter Bradley Jackson becomes a viral sensation after a video of her angrily fact-checking a coal mine protester is posted on social media. Bradley quits following a confrontation with her boss and, after an argument with her family, is asked to appear on ''The Morning Show'' for an interview. Alex, who is skeptical about Bradley's claim that she was unaware of being filmed, presses her during the interview, which Bradley manages to get through. Network head Cory Ellison later calls Bradley and asks to meet her so they can discuss her future.

 |ShortSummary    = Cory arranges a meeting for Bradley with the show's executive producer, Chip Black. His dismissive manner sets Bradley off, leaving her sure she has ruined her chances. In the middle of contract negotiations and knowing the network needs her to stabilize the show after Mitch's departure, Alex tries to leverage the situation to get all of her demands, including co-host approval. Cory invites an unwitting Bradley to an event honoring Alex, and seats the women next to each other. Cory scoffs at Alex's demand for co-host approval, and calls her bluff when she threatens to leave the show. During her speech, Alex announces a shocked Bradley as her new co-host.

 |ShortSummary    = The staff of ''The Morning Show'' are in turmoil over the announcement. Alex has told the press that Bradley will debut the following Monday, so as the team prepares to work all weekend to prep her, Alex arrives to assert some control over the proceedings. Meanwhile, a frustrated Bradley has not even decided if she will accept the job. Mia Jordan asks Chip to make her Bradley's producer, and announces herself in the position before he has offered it to her. Forced to go along with Alex's announcement or lose face, network head Fred Micklen is furious, but Cory sees Bradley as an opportunity to reinvent the show and eventually be rid of Alex. Bradley is unhappy with her initial wardrobe and camera tests, so she challenges the copy Mia is providing her, and dispenses with the clothing chosen for her by Alex. Fred summons Alex to browbeat her in front of a room of network executives, but she informs him that he lost power over the show long ago, and from now on they will be doing things her way.

 |ShortSummary    = Bradley makes her debut on ''The Morning Show'' but, chafing at the scripted persona the show has given her, ends up mentioning her personal struggles as a teen, including having an abortion. This revelation incites controversy and infuriates Fred, but it also galvanizes the younger, pro-choice audience. Alex is convinced to give Bradley the interview with one of Mitch's accusers, but Bradley goes off script and the accuser reveals more than the producers had planned. Meanwhile, an investigation is launched by human resources into Mitch's conduct, with most of the crew offering their support to Mitch and denying knowledge of his sexual misconduct. Alex begins to experience some professional jealousy as America embraces Bradley and ratings rise.

Bradley tries to bond with her coworkers by going out to celebrate Claire's birthday at a bar only for the night to get heated as talk eventually turns to Mitch, and Bradley receives a call from her estranged father.

After an inappropriate remark about Mia leads to a member of the production team being fired by Chip, Mia has a meltdown and confirms to the entire studio that she was involved with Mitch.

Aware that moves are being made behind the scenes to expose his allowance of sexual misconduct, Fred grants Alex co-host approval in order to gain her support in firing Chip. Chip explains the interview plan to his assistant, Rena, and gets her to agree to smuggle Mitch into ''The Morning Show'' to do the interview live and on air, letting her know that he has been fired and that they need to act soon. Claire, trying to make amends with Hannah, shows up at her apartment and discovers that Hannah is dead from an overdose. News of her death shocks everyone, resulting in Bradley calling off the interview and a fight between Chip and Mitch. While on air, Alex snaps and along with Bradley, exposes Fred and UBA for their knowledge of sexual misconduct and the creation of a toxic culture.

==Reception==
The review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 61% approval rating, based on 104 reviews, with an average rating of 5.78/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Flashy, but somewhat frivolous, ''The Morning Show'' often feels more like a vanity project than the hard-hitting drama it aspires to be—but there is pleasure to be had in watching Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon give it their all." Audiences on Rotten Tomatoes however, by contrast, rated the first season of the series at 93%.<ref>{{Cite web |title= The Morning Show: Season 1 (2019) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_morning_show/s01 |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= September 7, 2020 |archive-date= August 20, 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200820235838/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_morning_show/s01 |url-status= live }}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 61 out of 100 based on reviews from 37 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{Cite web |title= The Morning Show: Season 1 |url= https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show |website= [[Metacritic]] |access-date= December 23, 2019 |archive-date= November 8, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191108215345/https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-morning-show |url-status= live }}</ref>

[[Richard Roeper]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave a positive review and wrote: "''The Morning Show'' doesn't have the cinematic gravitas of the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[The Loudest Voice]]'' or the [[Aaron Sorkin]] poetry of [[HBO]]'s ''[[The Newsroom (American TV series)|The Newsroom]]''. It's more along the lines of the solid but underachieving ''[[Sports Night]]'' TV series from the late 1990s."<ref>{{cite web |date= October 29, 2019 |last= Roeper |first= Richard |author-link= Richard Roeper |title= Sex scandal a wakeup call for news team on AppleTV+'s solid, starry new series ''The Morning Show'' |url= https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/10/29/20938259/morning-show-review-appletv-apple-tv-plus-streaming-for-all-mankind-dickinson-jennifer-aniston |website= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date= November 24, 2019 |archive-date= November 30, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191130091745/https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/10/29/20938259/morning-show-review-appletv-apple-tv-plus-streaming-for-all-mankind-dickinson-jennifer-aniston |url-status= live }}</ref>
