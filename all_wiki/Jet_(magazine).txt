==History==
=== Early history ===
The first issue of ''Jet'' magazine was published on November 1, 1951 by John H. Johnson in Chicago, Illinois.<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA50|title=From Negro Digest to Ebony, Jet and EM|date=November 1992|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|pages=50–55}}</ref> Johnson called his magazine ''Jet'' because he wanted the name to symbolize "Black and speed". In Jet’s first issue, Johnson wrote, "In the world today everything is moving along at a faster clip. There is more news and far less time to read it."<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Company19512">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEMDAAAAMBAJ|title=Jet|journal=Jet : 2004|date=November 1, 1951|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=67|issn=0021-5996|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}</ref> Jet's goal was to provide "news coverage on happenings among Negroes all over the U.S.—in entertainment, politics, sports, social events as well as features on unusual personalities, places and events."<ref name="Company19512" /> [[Redd Foxx]] called the magazine "the Negro bible".<ref name="Finkelman20092">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gbQHxb_P0QC&pg=RA2-PA25|title=Encyclopedia of African American History|author=Paul Finkelman|date=February 12, 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516779-5|page=25|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}</ref>

=== 1952–2014 ===
''Jet'' became nationally known in 1955 for its shocking and graphic coverage of the murder of [[Emmett Till]]. Its popularity was enhanced by its continuing coverage of the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement.<ref name="Finkelman20092" /> The publication of Till's brutalized corpse on the cover of the issue inspired the black community to address racial violence, catalyzing the Civil Rights Movement. The Johnson Publishing Company's campaign for economic, political and social justice influenced its inclusion of progressive views.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Patton |first=June O. |title=Remembering John H.

==== Changes in ownership ====
In June 2016, after 71 years, ''Jet'' and its sister publication ''[[Ebony_(magazine)|Ebony]]'' were sold by Johnson Publishing to Clear View Group, an Austin, Texas-based private equity firm, for an undisclosed amount but the sale did not include the photo archives.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-ebony-sold-0615-biz-20160614-story.html|title=Johnson Publishing sells Ebony, Jet magazines to Texas firm|last=Channick|first=Robert|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en-US}}</ref> In July 2019, three months after Johnson Publishing filed for Chapter 7 [[Bankruptcy]] liquidation, it sold its historic ''Jet'' and ''Ebony'' photo archives to a consortium of foundations to be made available to the public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ebony-and-jet-magazine-photo-archive/|title=Rare look inside the Ebony and Jet magazine photo archive that just sold for $30M|date=July 26, 2019|website=CBS News|language=en|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref><ref name="a&o2">{{cite web|url=https://www.artandobject.com/shorts/foundations-unite-save-ebony-magazine-archives?|title=Foundations Unite to Save Ebony Magazine Archives|last1=Noyes|first1=Chandra|date=29 July 2019|website=artandobject.com|publisher=Journalistic, Inc.|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref>

==Content==
''Jet'' coverage includes: fashion and beauty tips, entertainment news, dating advice, political coverage, health tips, and diet guides, in addition to covering events such as fashion shows. The cover photo usually corresponds to the focus of the main story. Some examples of cover stories might be a celebrity's wedding, Mother's Day, or a recognition of the achievements of a notable African American. Many issues are given coverage to show the African-American community that if they want to reach a goal, they have to be willing to work for it. ''Jet'' also claims to give young female adults confidence and strength because the women featured therein are strong and successful without the help of a man. Since 1952, ''Jet'' has had a full-page feature called "Beauty of the Week". This feature includes a photograph of an African-American woman in a swimsuit (either one-piece or two-piece, but never nude), along with her name, place of residence, profession, hobbies, and interests. Many of the women are not professional models and submit their photographs for the magazine's consideration. The purpose of the feature is to promote the beauty of African-American women. Similar to [[Essence (magazine)|''Essence'']], ''Jet''  routinely deplores racism in mainstream media, especially its negative depictions of black men and women. However, Hazell and Clarke report that between 2003-4, ''Jet'' and ''Essence'' themselves ran advertising that was pervaded with racism and white supremacy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hazell |first1=Vanessa |last2=Clarke |first2=Juanne |title=Race and Gender in the Media: A Content Analysis of Advertisements in Two Mainstream Black Magazines |journal=Journal of Black Studies |date=2008 |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=5–21 |jstor=40282545}}</ref> In fact, ''Jet'' has published colorist advertisements in the past. An advertisement for Nadinola, a bleaching cream, appeared in an issue published in 1955. It depicts a light-skinned woman as the center of men's attention<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shepard |first=Jazmyn |title=Jet Magazine: Celebrating Black Female Beauty |journal=XULAneXUS |volume=16 |issue=2 |year=2019 |url=https://digitalcommons.xula.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1130&context=xulanexus}}</ref>
