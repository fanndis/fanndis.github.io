{{2000 Summer Olympics}}

The '''2000 Summer Olympics''' (officially known as the '''Games of the XXVII Olympiad''' and commonly known as '''Sydney 2000''', the '''Millennium Olympic Games''' or the '''Games of the New Millennium''') was an international [[multi-sport event]] held from 15&nbsp;September to 1&nbsp;October 2000 in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was the second time the [[Summer Olympics]] were held in Australia, and in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the first being in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], in [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]]. The United States topped the medal table, followed by Russia and China. 

==Host city selection==
{{main|Bids for the 2000 Summer Olympics}}

Sydney won the right to host the Games on 24 September 1993, after being selected over [[Beijing]], [[Berlin]], [[Istanbul]] and [[Manchester]] in four rounds of voting, at the 101st [[IOC Session]] in [[Monte Carlo]], Monaco. The Australian city of [[Melbourne]] had lost out to [[Atlanta]] for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] four years earlier.<ref>[http://www.aldaver.com/votes.html IOC Vote History]</ref> Beijing lost its bid to host the games to Sydney in 1993, but was later awarded the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in July 2001 after Sydney hosted the previous year, and it would eventually be awarded the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] twenty-two years later in 2015. Although it is unknown as to why members of the International Olympic Committee voted for Sydney over Beijing in 1993, it appears that an important role was played by Human Rights Watch's campaign to "stop Beijing" because of China's human rights record. Many in China were angry at what they saw as U.S.-led interference in the vote, and the outcome contributed to rising anti-Western sentiment in China and tensions in Sino-American relations.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0022009416667791|title = Harnessing Human Rights to the Olympic Games: Human Rights Watch and the 1993 'Stop Beijing' Campaign| journal=Journal of Contemporary History| volume=53| issue=2| pages=415–438|year = 2018|last1 = Keys|first1 = Barbara| url=http://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/11343/217038/5/Keys%20Human%20Rights%20JCH%20author%20version.pdf|hdl = 11343/217038}}</ref>

==Costs==
The ''Oxford Olympics Study 2016'' estimates the outturn cost of the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics at US$5 billion in 2015-dollars and cost overrun at 90% in real terms.<ref>{{Cite book|ssrn=2804554|title=The Oxford Olympics Study 2016: Cost and Cost Overrun at the Games|last=Flyvbjerg|first=Bent|last2=Stewart|first2=Allison|last3=Budzier|first3=Alexander|publisher=Saïd Business School Working Papers (Oxford: University of Oxford)|year=2016|location=Oxford|pages=9, 13}}</ref> This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) ''operational costs'' incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) ''direct capital costs'' incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are ''not'' included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The cost for Sydney 2000 compares with a cost of US$4.6 billion for Rio 2016, US$40–44 billion for Beijing 2008 and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014, the most expensive Olympics in history. Average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion, average cost overrun is 176%.

In 2000, the [[Auditor-General of New South Wales]] reported that the Sydney Games cost [[Australian dollar|A$]]6.6&nbsp;billion, with a net cost to the public between A$1.7 and A$2.4&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liebreich.com/LDC/HTML/Olympics/London/Sydney.html |title=Sydney 2000&nbsp;– Auditor Slams Costs |website=liebreich.com |date=23 April 2003 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050207142926/http://www.liebreich.com/LDC/HTML/Olympics/London/Sydney.html |archivedate = 7 February 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.audit.nsw.gov.au/agrep02v2/costofolympicgames.pdf |title=Cost of the Olympic and Paralympic Games |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050620055157/http://www.audit.nsw.gov.au/agrep02v2/costofolympicgames.pdf |archivedate=20 June 2005 |pages=10–11 |quote=Olympic Co-ordination Authority ...

It has been estimated that the economic impact of the 2000 Olympics was that A$2.1&nbsp;billion has been shaved from public consumption. Economic growth was not stimulated to a net benefit and in the years after 2000, foreign tourism to NSW grew by less than tourism to Australia as a whole. A "multiplier" effect on broader economic development is not realised, as a simple "multiplier" analysis fails to capture is that resources have to be redirected from elsewhere: the building of a stadium is at the expense of other public works such as extensions to hospitals. Building sporting venues does not add to the aggregate stock of productive capital in the years following the Games: "Equestrian centres, softball compounds and man-made rapids are not particularly useful beyond their immediate function."<ref>{{cite news| url = http://business.smh.com.au/no-medals-for-economic-benefits-of-the-games/20080411-25ks.html| title = No medals for economic benefits of the Games| last = Saulwick| first = Jacob| date = 12 April 2008| accessdate = 16 April 2008| work = Business Day| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516200545/http://business.smh.com.au/no-medals-for-economic-benefits-of-the-games/20080411-25ks.html| archivedate = 16 May 2008| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}  The article is based largely on a recent study by James Giesecke and John Madden from the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University.</ref>
In the years after the games, infrastructure issues have been of growing concern to citizens, especially those in the western suburbs of Sydney. Proposed rail links to Sydney's west have been estimated to cost in the same order of magnitude as the public expenditure on the games. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Chronological summary of the 2000 Summer Olympics==
===Preliminary matches&nbsp;– from 13 September===
Although the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony was not scheduled until 15 September, the [[Association football|football]] competitions began with preliminary matches on 13 September. Among the pre-ceremony fixtures, host nation Australia lost 1–0 to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], which was the main stadium for the [[1956 Melbourne Olympics]].

===Day 1–15 September===
====Cultural display highlights====
{{See also|2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony}}
[[File:2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony 1.JPEG|thumb|right|The [[2000 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony]] at [[Stadium Australia]], on 15 September 2000.]]
The opening ceremony began with a tribute to the Australian pastoral heritage of the [[Stockman (Australia)|Australian stockmen]] and the importance of the [[Australian Stock Horse|stock horse]] in Australia's heritage. It was produced and filmed by the Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation and the home nation broadcaster [[Seven Network|Channel 7]].<ref>Commentary on the official DVD of the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics</ref> This was introduced by lone rider [[Steve Jefferys]] and his rearing [[Australian Stock Horse]] ''Ammo''. At the cracking of Jefferys' [[stock whip|stockwhip]], a further 120 riders entered the stadium, their stock horses performing intricate steps, including forming the five [[Olympic Rings]], to a special Olympics version of the theme, which [[Bruce Rowland]] had previously composed for the 1982 film ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]''.

The [[Advance Australia Fair|Australian National Anthem]] was sung, the first verse by [[Human Nature (band)|Human Nature]] and the second by [[Julie Anthony (singer)|Julie Anthony]].

The ceremony continued, showing many aspects of the land and its people: the affinity of the mainly coastal-dwelling Australians with the sea that surrounds the "Island Continent". The [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] occupation of the land, the coming of the [[First Fleet]], the continued immigration from many nations and the rural industry on which the economy of the nation was built, including a display representing the harshness of rural life based on the paintings of Sir [[Sidney Nolan]]. Two memorable scenes were the representation of the "Heart" of the country by 200 [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] women from [[Central Australia]] who danced up "the mighty spirit of God to protect the Games" and the overwhelmingly noisy representation of the [[construction industry]] by hundreds of tap-dancing teenagers.

Because Bibi Salisachs (the wife of IOC President [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]]) was seriously ill and unable to accompany her husband to the Olympics, [[Dawn Fraser]], former Australian Olympic Champion swimmer and member of the [[Parliament of New South Wales]], accompanied Samaranch during the Australian cultural display, explaining to him some of the cultural references that are unfamiliar to non-Australians.

====Formal presentation====
A record 199 nations entered the stadium, with a record 80 of them winning at least one medal. The only missing [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] member was [[Afghanistan]], who was banned due to the extremist rule of the [[Taliban]]'s oppression of women and its prohibition of sports.<ref>[https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/flash-from-the-past-afghans-shattered-2000-olympic-dreams-amended/] Afghanistan-Analysts. Retrieved on 19 April 2015.</ref> The ceremony featured a unified entrance by the athletes of [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]],{{efn|The national teams of [[North Korea at the 2004 Summer Olympics|North Korea]] and [[South Korea at the 2004 Summer Olympics|South Korea]] competed separately in the Olympic events, even though they marched together as a [[Korea Team|unified Korean team]] in the opening ceremony.}} using a specially designed [[Unification Flag|unification flag]]: a white background flag with a blue map of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. Four athletes from [[East Timor]] also marched in the parade of nations as [[Individual Olympic Athletes]] and marched directly before the Host country. Although the country-to-be had no National Olympic Committee then, they were allowed to compete under the [[Olympic Flag]] with country code [[Individual Olympic Athletes at the 2000 Summer Olympics|IOA]]. The [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[William Deane|Sir William Deane]], opened the games.

The [[Olympic Flag]] was carried around the arena by eight former Australian Olympic champions: [[Bill Roycroft]], [[Murray Rose]], [[Liane Tooth]], [[Gillian Rolton]], [[Marjorie Jackson]], [[Lorraine Crapp]], [[Michael Wenden]] and [[Nick Green (rower)|Nick Green]]. During the raising of the Olympics Flag, the [[Olympic Hymn]] was sung by the Millennium Choir of the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia]] in Greek. Following this, [[Tina Arena]] sang a purpose-written pop song, ''The Flame''.<ref>[http://entertainment.time.com/2012/07/30/11-olympic-theme-songs-dissected/slide/tina-arena-flame-sydney-2000/ 11 Olympic Theme Songs, Dissected]. ''Time'' (26 July 2012). Retrieved 3 May 2014.</ref>

The opening ceremony concluded with the lighting of the [[Olympic Flame]], which was brought into the stadium by former Australian Olympic champion [[Herb Elliott]]. Then, celebrating 100 years of women's participation in the Olympic Games, former Australian women Olympic medalists [[Betty Cuthbert]] and [[Raelene Boyle]], [[Dawn Fraser]], [[Shirley Strickland]] (later Shirley Strickland de la Hunty), [[Shane Gould]] and [[Debbie Flintoff-King]] brought the torch through the stadium, handing it over to [[Cathy Freeman]], who lit the flame in the [[Olympic cauldron|cauldron]] within a circle of fire. The planned spectacular climax to the ceremony was delayed by the technical glitch of a computer switch which malfunctioned, causing the sequence to shut down by giving a false reading. This meant that the Olympic flame was suspended in mid-air for about four minutes, rather than immediately rising up a water-covered ramp to the top of the stadium. When the cause of the problem was discovered, the program was overridden and the cauldron continued its course, and the ceremony concluded with a spectacular fireworks display.<ref>Information given by [[Ric Birch]], Director of Ceremonies, during an interview at the end of the official DVD of the 2000 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony</ref>

===Day 2–16 September===
[[File:2000 Olympics first medals.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Gold medallist [[Nancy Johnson (sport shooter)|Nancy Johnson]] (centre) of the U.S., raises her hands with silver medallist Cho-Hyun Kang (left), of South Korea, and bronze winner [[Gao Jing]] (right), of China, during the first medal ceremony of the 2000 Olympic Games.]]

The first medals of the Games were awarded in the women's 10 metre [[air rifle]] competition, which was won by [[Nancy Johnson (sport shooter)|Nancy Johnson]] of the United States.

The [[Triathlon]] made its Olympic debut with the women's race. Set in the surroundings of the [[Sydney Opera House]], [[Brigitte McMahon]] representing Switzerland swam, cycled and ran to the first gold medal in the sport, beating the favoured home athletes such as Michelie Jones who won silver. McMahon only passed Jones in sight of the finish line.

The first star of the Games was 17-year-old Australian [[Ian Thorpe]], who first set a new world record in the 400-metre freestyle final before competing in an exciting 4 × 100 m freestyle final. Swimming the last leg, Thorpe passed the leading American team and arrived in a new world record time, two tenths of a second ahead of the Americans. In the same event for women, the Americans also broke the world record, finishing ahead of the Netherlands and Sweden.

Samaranch had to leave for home, as his wife was severely ill. Upon arrival, his wife had already died. Samaranch returned to Sydney four days later. The Olympic flag was flown at half-staff during the period as a sign of respect to Samaranch's wife.

===Day 3–17 September===
Canadian [[Simon Whitfield]] sprinted away in the last 100 metres of the men's triathlon, becoming the inaugural winner in the event.

On the cycling track, [[Robert Bartko]] beat fellow German [[Jens Lehmann (cyclist)|Jens Lehmann]] in the individual pursuit, setting a new Olympic Record. [[Leontien Zijlaard-van Moorsel]] set a world record in the semi-finals the same event for women.

In the swimming pool, American [[Tom Dolan]] beat the world record in the 400-metre [[Medley swimming|medley]], successfully defending the title he won in [[Atlanta]] four years prior. Dutchwoman [[Inge de Bruijn]] also clocked a new world record, beating her own time in the 100 m butterfly final to win by more than a second.

===Day 4–18 September===
The main event for the Australians on the fourth day of the Games was the 200 m freestyle. Dutchman [[Pieter van den Hoogenband]] had broken the world record in the semi-finals, taking it from the new Australian hero [[Ian Thorpe]], who came close to the world record in his semi-final heat. As the final race finished, Van den Hoogenband's time was exactly the same as in the semi-finals, finishing ahead of Thorpe by half a second.

China won the [[gold medal]] in the men's team all-around gymnastics competition, after being the runner-up in the previous two Olympics. The other medals were taken by [[Ukraine]] and Russia, respectively.

Zijlaard-van Moorsel lived up to the expectations set by her world record in cycling in the semis by winning the gold medal.

===Day 7–21 September===
Controversy erupted at the Women's Gymnastics All-Around final, when gymnast after gymnast fell on the vault. Some gymnasts were physically injured, and all were shaken, but nothing was done to try to discover the reason most gymnasts were having severe problems. Finally, in the middle of the third round (out of four), it was determined that the vault horse had been set 5&nbsp;cm too low&nbsp;– enough of a difference to throw off the impeccable timing of many of these world-class athletes. While athletes were allowed to vault again, the remedy did not fully repair injuries and shaken confidence. The medals were eventually all won by Romanian gymnasts, with [[Andreea Raducan]] becoming the first athlete from her country to win the title since [[Nadia Comaneci]] in 1976. Teammates [[Simona Amanar]] and [[Maria Olaru]] took silver and bronze, respectively. This result also marked the first sweep of the event since the Soviet Union's in 1960.

===Day 9–23 September===
By rowing in the winning coxless four, [[Steve Redgrave]] of Great Britain became a member of a select group who had won gold medals at five consecutive Olympics.

The swimming 4 x 100-metre medley relay of B.J. Bedford, [[Megan Quann]] (Jendrick), [[Jenny Thompson]] and [[Dara Torres]] became the first women's relay under 4-minutes, swimming 3:58 and setting a world record, claiming the gold medal for the United States.

===Day 10–24 September===
[[Rulon Gardner]], never an [[NCAA]] champion or a world medalist, beat [[Alexander Karelin]] of Russia to win gold in the super heavyweight class, [[Greco-Roman wrestling]]. Karelin had won gold in [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul]], [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona]] and [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta]]. Before this fight he had never lost in international competition, had been unbeaten in all competitions in 13 years, and had not surrendered a point in a decade.

===Day 11–25 September===
[[File:Cathy400 mediafrenzy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Cathy Freeman]] after the 400-metre final]]
Australian [[Cathy Freeman]] won the 400-metre final in front of a jubilant Sydney crowd at the [[Stadium Australia|Olympic Stadium]], ahead of [[Lorraine Fenton|Lorraine Graham]] of Jamaica and [[Katharine Merry]] of Great Britain. Freeman's win made her the first competitor in Olympic Games history to light the [[Olympic Flame]] and then go on to win a [[Gold Medal]]. The attendance at the stadium was 112,524 – the largest attendance for any sport in Olympic Games history.

In a men's basketball pool match between the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States]] and [[France national basketball team|France]], the USA's [[Vince Carter]] made one of the most famous [[slam dunk|dunks]] in basketball history. After getting the ball off a steal, the 6'6"/1.98 m Carter drove to the basket, with 7'2"/2.18 m centre [[Frédéric Weis]] in his way. Carter jumped, spread his legs in midair, scraped Weis' head on the way up, and dunked. The French media dubbed the feat ''le dunk de la mort'' ("the dunk of death").

===Day 14–28 September===
The [[Canadian flag]] at athletes' village is lowered to half-staff as Canadian athletes pay tribute to former prime minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] after hearing of his [[Death and state funeral of Pierre Trudeau|death]] in Montreal (Because of the time difference, it was 29 September in Sydney when Trudeau died). The Canadian flag flew at half-staff for the remainder of the Olympics, on orders from both IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister [[Lloyd Axworthy]], as the state funeral did not take place until 3 October.

===Day 16–30 September===
[[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] won a historic gold medal over [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the Men's Olympic [[association football|Football]] Final at the Olympic Stadium. The game went to a penalty shootout, which was won by Cameroon 5–3.<ref>{{cite web | title = Patrick Mboma|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/pastgames/halloffame/m/n214045822.shtml  | accessdate =9 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517151346/http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/pastgames/halloffame/m/n214045822.shtml |archivedate=17 May 2013}}</ref>

===Day 17–1 October===
{{See also|2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony}}
[[File:Fireworks, Sydney Harbour Bridge, 2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|Olympic colours on the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]].]]
The last event of the games was the Men's Marathon, contested on a course that started in North Sydney. The event was won by [[Ethiopia]]n [[Gezahegne Abera]], with Kenyan [[Erick Wainaina]] second, and [[Tesfaye Tola]], also of Ethiopia, third. It was the first time since the 1968 Olympics that an Ethiopian won the gold medal in this event.

The closing ceremony commenced with [[Christine Anu]] performing her version of the [[Warumpi Band]]'s song "[[My Island Home]]", with several [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] dancers atop the Geodome Stage in the middle of the stadium, around which several hundred umbrella and lampbox kids created an image of Aboriginal dreamtime. The Geodome Stage was used throughout the ceremony, which was a flat stage mechanically raised into the shape of a [[Geode]].

IOC President [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] declared at the Closing Ceremony,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/02/sports/sydney-2000-closing-ceremony-a-fond-farewell-from-australia.html|title=Sydney 2000: Closing Ceremony; A fond farewell from Australia|date=2 October 2000|first=Jere|last=Longman|newspaper=New York Times| accessdate=12 May 2010 }}</ref>
{{quote|"I am proud and happy to proclaim that you have presented to the world the best Olympic Games ever."}}
Subsequent Summer Olympics held in [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]], [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|London]] have been described by Samaranch's successor [[Jacques Rogge]] as "unforgettable, dream Games", "truly exceptional" and "happy and glorious games" respectively&nbsp;– the practice of declaring games the "best ever" having been retired after the 2000 Games.

The [[Olympic Hymn]] was sung by soprano [[Yvonne Kenny]]. The ceremony also featured performing artists such as [[Jimmy Barnes]], [[INXS]], [[Midnight Oil]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Slim Dusty]], [[Christine Anu]], [[Nikki Webster]], [[John Paul Young]], [[Men at Work]], [[Vanessa Amorosi]], [[Tommy Emmanuel]], and [[Savage Garden]].

The Games were then handed over to their modern birthplace [[Athens]], which succeeded Sydney as the summer Olympic host city. Two Greek flags were raised; one to honour the birthplace of the Olympics, and the other to honour Athens. The ceremony concluded with a huge [[fireworks]] display on [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]], which itself concluded with a very low flyover of Stadium Australia by an [[General Dynamics F-111C|RAAF F-111C]], performing a [[Dump and burn|dump-and-burn]] manoeuvre synchronised with the extinction of the [[Olympic Flame]]. This created the appearance of the flame being carried away into the sky, flying in a northeasterly direction out across Sydney Harbour and ultimately towards Athens in a symbolic handover.

In honour of her gold medal win during the games, [[Cathy Freeman]] represented [[Oceania]] in carrying the Olympic flag, joining Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] (Africa), [[John Glenn]] (The Americas), [[Kazuyoshi Funaki]] (Asia), [[Lech Wałęsa]] (Europe), [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] (Environment), [[Jean-Claude Killy]] (Sport), and [[Steven Spielberg]] (Culture) when it was raised again, at the [[2002 Winter Olympics|XIX Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Salt Lake City]]; the opening ceremony there took place on 8 February 2002.

Although demonstration sports were abolished following the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], the Sydney Olympics featured [[Wheelchair Racing at the 2000 Summer Olympics|wheelchair racing]] as exhibition events on the athletics schedule.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reflections on the Olympic Wheelchair Racing Exhibition Races |url=http://www.ncpad.org/yourwrites/fact_sheet.php?sheet=267 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613075038/http://ncpad.org/yourwrites/fact_sheet.php?sheet=267 |archivedate=13 June 2010 |url-status=live |accessdate=15 June 2009  }}</ref>

Special [[quarantine]] conditions were introduced to allow entry of horses into Australia to participate in equestrian events,<ref>{{cite web|title=Strict quarantine conditions for overseas horses competing in the Sydney 2000 Games|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/about/media-centre/dept-releases/1999/strict_quarantine_conditions_for_overseas_horses_competing_in_the_sydney_2000_games|publisher=Department of Agriculture|accessdate=23 December 2014|date=26 November 1999 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507085950/http://www.agriculture.gov.au/about/media-centre/dept-releases/1999/strict_quarantine_conditions_for_overseas_horses_competing_in_the_sydney_2000_games |archivedate=7 May 2015}}</ref> avoiding the need for such events to take place elsewhere as had happened at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in Melbourne.

==Participating National Olympic Committees==
[[File:2000 Summer Olympic games countries.svg|thumb|Participating countries]]
[[File:2000 Summer olympics team numbers.gif|thumb|Number of athletes]]

199 [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs), participated in the Sydney Games, two more than in the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. In addition, there were four [[Timor-Leste|Timorese]] [[Individual Olympic Athletes at the 2000 Summer Olympics]]. [[Eritrea at the 2000 Summer Olympics|Eritrea]], [[Federated States of Micronesia at the 2000 Summer Olympics|Federated States of Micronesia]] and [[Palau at the 2000 Summer Olympics|Palau]] made their Olympic debut this year.

Afghanistan was the only 1996 participant and the only existing NOC that did not participate in the 2000 Olympics, having been banned due to the extremist rule of the Taliban's oppression of women and its prohibition of sports; later, also destroyed was the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] in [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban's totalitarian rule in Afghanistan]] (present-day [[Afghanistan]]), from the orders by the [[Mullah]] [[Mohammed Omar]].

==Organisation==
[[File:SOCOG org structure 1998.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|SOCOG organisational structure circa 1998&nbsp;– five groups and 33 divisions reporting to the CEO are organised primarily along functional lines with only a limited number of divisions (e.g. Interstate Football and Villages) anticipating a venue focussed design.]]
[[File:SOCOG org structure 1999.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|SOCOG organisational structure circa 1999&nbsp;– functional divisions and precinct/venue streams are organised in a matrix structure linked to the Main Operations Centre (MOC). Some functions such as Project Management (in the Games Coordination group) continue to exist largely outside this matrix structure.]]

===Organisations responsible for the Olympics===
A number of quasi-government bodies were responsible for the construction, organisation and execution of the Sydney Games. These included:
*the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), primarily responsible for the staging of the Games
*Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA), primarily responsible for construction and oversight
*Olympic Roads & Transport Authority (ORTA)
*[[Olympic Security Command Centre]] (OSCC)
*Olympic Intelligence Centre (OIC)
*[[Joint Task Force Gold|JTF Gold]] the [[Australian Defence Force]] Joint Taskforce Gold
*Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation (nominally part of SOCOG)
*[[IBM]], provider of technology and the Technical Command Centre
*[[Telstra]], provider of telecommunications
*[[Great Big Events]], event management and marketing

These organisations worked closely together and with other bodies such as:
*the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC)
*the [[Australian Olympic Committee]] (AOC)
*the other 197 [[National Olympic Committees]] (NOCs)
*the 33 [[List of International Sport Federations|International Sports Federations]] (IFs)
*all three levels of Australian government (federal, state and local)
*dozens of official sponsor and hundreds of official supplier companies

These bodies are often collectively referred to as the "Olympic Family".

===Organisation of the Paralympics===
The organisation of the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]] was the responsibility of the [[Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee]] (SPOC). However, much of the planning and operation of the Paralympic Games was outsourced to SOCOG such that most operational programmes planned both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

===Other Olympic events===
Organisation of the Games included not only the actual sporting events, but also the management (and sometimes construction) of the sporting venues and surrounding precincts, the organisation of the [[Sydney Olympic Arts Festival]], and the [[2000 Summer Olympics torch relay|Olympic torch relay]], which began in Greece and travelled to Australia via numerous Oceania island nations.

===Phases of the Olympic project===
The staging of the Olympics were treated as a project on a vast scale, broken into several broad phases:
*1993 to 1996&nbsp;– positioning
*1997&nbsp;– going operational
*1998&nbsp;– procurement/venuisation
*1999&nbsp;– testing/refinement
*2000&nbsp;– implementation
*2001&nbsp;– post implementation and wind-down

===SOCOG organisational design===
The internal organisation of SOCOG evolved over the phases of the project and changed, sometimes radically, several times.

In late 1998, the design was principally functional. The top two tiers below the CEO [[Sandy Hollway]] consisted of five groups (managed by Group General Managers and the Deputy CEO) and twenty divisions (managed by divisional General Managers), which in turn were further broken up into programmes and sub-programmes or projects.

In 1999, functional areas (FAs) broke up into geographic precinct and venue teams (managed by Precinct Managers and Venue Managers) with functional area staff reporting to both the FA manager and the venue manager. SOCOG moved to a matrix structure. The Interstate Football division extant in 1998 was the first of these geographically based venue teams.

===Volunteer program===
The origins of the volunteer program for Sydney 2000 dates back to the bid, as early as 1992.

On 17 December 1992, a group of Sydney citizens interested in the prospect of hosting the 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games gathered for a meeting at Sports House at [[Wentworth Park]] in Sydney.

In the period leading up to 1999, after Sydney had won the bid, the small group of volunteers grew from approximately 42 to around 500. These volunteers became known as Pioneer Volunteers. The Pioneer Volunteer program was managed internally by SOCOG's Volunteer Services Department in consultation with prominent peak groups like The Centre for Volunteering (Volunteering and [[TAFE]]. Some of the Pioneer Volunteers still meet every four months, an unseen legacy of the games which brought together a community spirit not seen before.

During the Olympic games, tens of thousands of volunteers (the official figure placed at 46,967)<ref>{{cite web|title=Sydney 2000 International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529060201/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=2000 |archivedate=29 May 2009 |url-status=live |accessdate=8 July 2009 }}</ref> helped everywhere at the Olympic venues and elsewhere in the city.

==Marketing==
===Official logo===
The [[Bids for the 2000 Summer Olympics|bid]] logo, created by architect and designer [[Michael Bryce]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/queensland/stories/s1485261.htm |publisher=ABC Queensland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101115135/http://www.abc.net.au/queensland/stories/s1485261.htm |archivedate=1 November 2007 |title=Architect Michael Bryce |date=19 October 2005}}</ref> featured a colourful, stylised image of the [[Sydney Opera House]].

The official logo, also referred to as the "Millennium Man",<ref name="Millennium Man">{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Leanne|title=The Sydney 2000 Olympic Games Bid: Marketing Indigenous Australia for the Millennium Games|journal=The International Journal of the History of Sport|date=9 June 2011|volume=28|issue=10|page=1455|doi=10.1080/09523367.2011.578341|url=https://www.academia.edu/4678375|accessdate=17 August 2014|ref=Millennium Man}}</ref> took the image of the bid logo and combined it with a stylised image of a runner to form a torchbearer in motion, formed by two small yellow boomerangs for arms and a larger red boomerang for legs. The Olympic torch is represented through a blue smoke trail, which draws the iconic peaks of the Sydney Opera House.

The design process of the official logo, as well as all other aspects of the Olympic Games' visual design identity, was awarded to [[Melbourne]] design studio FHA Image Design.<ref name="Desktop Mag">{{cite web|last=Desktop|title=Top Ten Australian Logos – 8th &#124; Desktop|url=http://desktopmag.com.au/features/top-ten-australian-logos-8/|website=Desktop &#124; The Culture of Design|publisher=Desktop Magazine|accessdate=26 November 2014|ref=Desktop Mag|date=27 September 2012}}</ref> The Sydney Olympics brand identity project officially commenced in 1993.

===The Mascots===
{{main|Olly, Syd and Millie}}
The official [[mascot]]s chosen for the 2000 Summer Olympics were Syd the [[platypus]], Millie the [[echidna]], and Olly the [[kookaburra]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/10/74/article211987410.shtml|title=Syd, Olly and Millie – mascots of the 2000 Olympic Summer Games|publisher=Beijing2008|date=5 August 2004|accessdate=25 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517163244/http://en.beijing2008.cn/10/74/article211987410.shtml |archivedate=17 May 2013}}</ref> designed by Matthew Hattan and [[Jozef Szekeres]] and named by Philip Sheldon of agency Weekes Morris Osborn in response to the original SOCOG recommendation of Murray, Margery and Dawn after famous Australian athletes.

There was also [[Fatso the Fat-Arsed Wombat]], an unofficial mascot popularised by comedy team [[Roy and HG|Roy Slaven and HG Nelson]] on the TV series ''[[The Dream with Roy and HG]]''.
