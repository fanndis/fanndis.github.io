'''Gun Owners of America''' ('''GOA''') is a [[gun rights]] organization in the United States with over 100,000 members. It makes efforts to differentiate itself from the larger [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) and has publicly criticized the NRA on multiple occasions for what it considers to be compromising on gun rights. 

The GOA has often opposed the NRA in its endorsements and ratings of politicians and candidates. For instance, the GOA was outspoken in opposing [[John McCain]]'s 2008 presidential bid, describing his gun-rights voting record as "abysmal, wretched, and pathetic"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gunowners.org/mccaintb/|title=GOA’s Take on John McCain &#124; Gun Owners of America|website=gunowners.org|accessdate=Mar 31, 2020}}</ref> and giving him an F− grade on [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] issues since 2004, while the NRA (through its [[Political Action Committee|PAC]], the NRA-PVF) gave him a C+.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?sig_id=003284M|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022141950/http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?sig_id=003284M|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 22, 2004|title=Project Vote Smart - National Rifle Association Ratings|date=Oct 22, 2004|accessdate=Mar 31, 2020}}</ref>  The GOA took issue with the NRA over the 2007 NICS Improvement Act.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The GOA has been described by [[United States Congress|Congressman]] [[Ron Paul]] as "The only no-compromise gun lobby in Washington." This quote from Paul has long been displayed prominently on the home page of the Gun Owners of America website, and Paul was the only [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential candidate]] to receive an A+ grade from Gun Owners of America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gunowners.org/110hrat.htm |title=GOA House Ratings For The 110th Congress|publisher=Gunowners.org |access-date=2008-05-06 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216183830/http://www.gunowners.org/110hrat.htm |archive-date = February 16, 2008}}</ref>

==History==
Gun Owners of America was founded in 1975 by the NRA board member and [[California]] state senator [[H. L. Richardson]] when legislation to ban all handguns was introduced in California.<ref name="hlrichardson-GOA">{{cite web|url=https://gunowners.org/hlrichardson.htm |title=H.L. "Bill" Richardson - GOA|publisher=Gunowners.org |accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> Richardson was the chairman of Gun Owners of America until his death in 2020. Richardson also founded Gun Owners of California, which deals specifically with gun ownership rights in California.<ref name="Who Is GOA">{{cite web|url=http://www.gunowners.org/protect.htm |title=Who Is GOA |accessdate=2008-11-20}}</ref> GOA's current [[executive director]] as of 2018 is Erich Pratt, son of the previous director [[Larry Pratt]], who also hosts GOA's audio webcast, Live Fire.

==Goals==
Gun Owners of America is a [[501(c)(4)]] [[nonprofit organization]] whose main goal is to preserve and defend the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]]. Gun Owners of America  sees the right to bear arms as a fundamental freedom issue. GOA's stance is to "never compromise" and not to accept the status quo.<ref name="Who Is GOA"/> According to Gun Owners of America 's official website, its board contends that Americans have lost some of their gun rights, and GOA strives to get them back. For 30 years, Gun Owners of America has been building a nationwide network of lawyers to aid in challenging gun control legislation in the courts. Gun Owners of America has been involved in legal proceedings in almost every state in the hopes of maintaining and advancing pro-gun legislation and rights.<ref name="Who Is GOA"/>

==Branches==
By its own account, Gun Owners of America spent over $1.75 million [[lobbying in the United States|lobbying]] [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] in 2004, and over $18 million between 1998 and 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/lobby/profile.aspx?act=clients&year=2003&cl=L001810 |title=Gun Owners of America on LobbyWatch |accessdate=2008-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210185208/http://www.publicintegrity.org/lobby/profile.aspx?act=clients&year=2003&cl=L001810 |archivedate=December 10, 2007 }}</ref> Gun Owners of America's Federal [[Political Action Committee]] is "Gun Owners of America Inc. Political Victory Fund" (C00278101).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/com_detail/C00278101/|title=FEC Disclosure Report on GOA|publisher=Query.nictusa.com|accessdate=2008-05-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203234105/http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/com_detail/C00278101/|archivedate=2008-12-03}}</ref> It raises funds to support the election of pro-gun candidates at all levels of government.

Gun Owners Foundation is an educational nonprofit foundation. It acts as the research arm for GOA. Its main objective is to hold seminars around the country to inform the public, media outlets, and various government officials on Second Amendment issues.<ref name="Who Is GOA"/> The Gun Owners Foundation around 2008 began a new campaign by creating [[Public Service Announcements]] to promote what it calls "PROPER Gun Safety". According to Gun Owners Foundation, its campaign objective is "to generate public awareness of the dangers of not having a gun ready for protection and to encourage gun owners not to lock up their best means of self-defense".<ref name="gunowners.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.gunowners.com/psatext.htm |title=GOF Public Service Announcements Promoting PROPER Gun Safety |publisher=Gunowners.org |accessdate=2008-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002161757/http://www.gunowners.com/psatext.htm |archivedate=2008-10-02 }}</ref> The public service announcements focus mainly on trying to persuade their target audience, American adults in gun owning households, to not lock up fire arms, but instead to keep them ready and accessible. According to the public service announcements:

* Guns are used 2.5 million times a year in self-defense. Citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year—or about 6,850 times a day. As a result, each year firearms are used over 60 times more often to protect lives than to take lives.
* Locking up firearms can cost lives during a life-threatening situation.
* Guns are the "great equalizer" for women. As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse.
* Gun owners are a good form of crime control. Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606).<ref name="gunowners.com"/>

==Recent campaigns==
Gun Owners of America publicly denounced then-President-elect [[Barack Obama]], stating that "Based on his voting record in the Illinois state senate and in the U.S. Senate, President-elect Barack Obama will be the most anti–Second Amendment president in the history of America."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gunowners.org/a110508.htm |title=Gun Rights in Peril|publisher=Gunowners.org |accessdate=2008-11-19}}</ref> Gun Owners of America was worried that with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] majority in the [[111th United States Congress|111th]] [[United States Congress|Congress]], having Obama alongside Democratic leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] and Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] (both rated F− by the GOA<ref>[http://gunowners.org/111hrat.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031142902/http://gunowners.org/111hrat.htm |date=October 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>[http://gunowners.org/111thsrat.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031165211/http://gunowners.org/111thsrat.htm |date=October 31, 2010 }}</ref>), will mean Second Amendment–protected rights could be affected. Gun Owners of America concerns about the Obama administration and current Congress include:

Gun Owners of America failed in its battle against New York Senator [[Chuck Schumer]]'s NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. The group claimed the bill ([[The School Safety And Law Enforcement Improvement Act#Title II: The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007|HR 2640]] and S 2084) would give authorities—including courts, psychiatrists, and in some cases psychologists—the ability to revoke the Second Amendment rights of veterans who had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Gun Owners of America contended that this would be an infringement on the rights of veterans with mental disorders.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==GOA victories==
On June 6, 1995, Gun Owners of America helped in lobbying the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to vote against the Moran Amendment, by a vote of 278 to 149. The amendment would have banned .50 caliber weapons from being licensed for export.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gunowners.org/activism.htm |title=Fifty Caliber Ban|publisher=Gunowners.org |accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref>

On July 13, 2006, Senator [[David Vitter]] saw an 84–16 vote for his amendment prohibiting the use of federal money for federal agents to confiscate weapons during a declared state of emergency. This bill was passed less than a year after the devastation in Vitter's home state from [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gunowners.org/activism.htm |title=No Gun Confiscation During Emergencies|publisher=Gunowners.org |accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref>

On June 27, 2007, the Pence Amendment passed. The bill, named after then-Representative [[Mike Pence]], was passed by a vote of 309–115. According to Gun Owners of America, the amendment blocked the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s ability to use the Fairness Doctrine to limit the free speech allowed by organizations like Gun Owners of America over the airwaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gunowners.org/activism.htm |title=Vetoing the Unfairness Doctrine|publisher=Gunowners.org |accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref>

On August 9, 2007, Gun Owners of America supported Vitter's work in pushing through a bill stating that no U.S. funds can be used by the [[United Nations]] or any group affiliated with the United Nations to restrict or tax Second Amendment rights. If they attempt to do so, the U.S. can withdraw their funds from the organization. This bill, HR-2764, also known as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, passed by an 81–10 vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gunowners.org/activism.htm |title=No Funds for Anti-gun UN|publisher=Gunowners.org |accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref>

On February 25, 2008, Senator [[Jim DeMint]] amended bill S-1200, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. The act stated that the funds were to be used for "violence prevention". Once the funds were attempted to be used for gun buybacks, DeMint pushed through an amendment to the act stating that the money cannot be used for any anti-gun programs. DeMint's amendment passed by a margin of 78–11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gunowners.org/activism.htm |title=No Funds for Gun Control|publisher=Gunowners.org |accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref>
