The [[geography of Ireland]] comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with [[Rivers of Ireland|several navigable rivers]] extending inland. Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature. Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the [[Middle Ages]].

The island was Christianised from the 5th century onward. Following the 12th century [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Anglo-Norman invasion]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th–17th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1801, Ireland became [[Countries of the United Kingdom|a part of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. A [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much [[The Troubles|civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s]]. This subsided following [[Good Friday Agreement|a political agreement]] in 1998. In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the [[European Economic Community]] while the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland, as part of it, did the same.

[[Irish culture]] has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of [[Irish literature|literature]]. Alongside mainstream [[Western culture]], a strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed through [[Gaelic games]], [[Irish music]] and the [[Irish language]]. The island's culture shares many features with that of Great Britain, including the [[English language]], and sports such as [[association football]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[horse racing]], and [[golf]].

==Etymology==
The names ''Ireland'' and {{lang|ga|Éire}} derive from [[Old Irish]] ''[[Ériu]]'', a goddess in [[Irish mythology]] first recorded in the ninth century. The etymology of Ériu is disputed but may derive from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root *''{{PIE|h2uer}}'', referring to flowing water.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Ní Mhurchú |first1=Síle |editor1-last=Echard |editor1-first=Sian |editor2-last=Rouse |editor2-first=Robert |title=Ériu|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature in Britain, 4 Volume Set |date=2017 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9781118396988 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXoqDwAAQBAJ&q=Eriu+etymology&pg=PA750|location=Chichester |language=en|page=750}}</ref>

During the [[last glacial period]], and until about 10,000 BC, most of Ireland was periodically covered in ice. [[Sea levels]] were lower and Ireland, like Great Britain, formed part of continental Europe. By 16,000 BC, rising sea levels caused by ice melting caused Ireland to become separated from Great Britain.<ref name=drowning>Edwards, Robin & al.

Some time before 4000&nbsp;BC, [[Neolithic]] settlers introduced cereal [[cultivar]]s, domesticated animals such as cattle and sheep, large timber buildings, and stone monuments.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cooney |first1=Gabriel |title=Landscapes of Neolithic Ireland |date=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0415169776}}</ref> The earliest evidence for farming in Ireland or Great Britain is from [[Ferriter's Cove]], [[County Kerry]], where a flint knife, cattle bones and a sheep's tooth were [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon-dated]] to c.&nbsp;4350&nbsp;BC.<ref name="Ireland's DNA">{{cite web |title=Prehistoric Genocide in Ireland? |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mace-lab/genetic-ancestry/guff_documents/Genocide_in_Ireland.pdf |website=Ireland's DNA |access-date=27 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411233025/https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mace-lab/genetic-ancestry/guff_documents/Genocide_in_Ireland.pdf |archive-date=11 April 2019}}</ref> Field systems were developed in different parts of Ireland, including at the {{lang|ga|[[Céide Fields]]}}, that has been preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present-day [[Tyrawley]].

The [[Bronze Age]]&nbsp;began around 2500 BC, with technology changing people's everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the [[wheel]]; harnessing [[oxen]]; [[weaving|weaving textiles]]; brewing [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]; and skilful [[metalworking]], which produced new weapons and tools, along with fine [[gold]] decoration and jewellery, such as [[brooch]]es and [[torc]]s. 

====Emergence of Celtic Ireland====
How and when the island became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. The most recent genetic research strongly associates the spread of Indo-European languages (including Celtic) through Western Europe with a people bringing a composite [[Beaker culture]], with its arrival in Britain and Ireland dated to around the middle of the third millennium&nbsp;BC.<ref name="Reich 2018 115">{{cite book |last=Reich |first=David |title=Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past |year=2018 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-882125-0 |page=115}}</ref> According to [[John T. Koch]] and others, Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-network culture called the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]] that also included Britain, western France and Iberia, and that this is where [[Celtic languages]] developed.<ref name="Koch">{{cite web |url=http://www.wales.ac.uk/Resources/Documents/Research/ODonnell.pdf |title=O'Donnell Lecture 2008 Appendix}}</ref><ref name="Koch2009">{{cite journal |last=Koch |first=John |title=Tartessian: Celtic from the Southwest at the Dawn of History |journal=Palaeohispanica |volume=9 (Acta Palaeohispanica X) |date=2009 |pages=339–351 |url= http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/29/54/26koch.pdf |issn=1578-5386 |access-date=17 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book <!--Not in reference |last=Cunliffe, Karl, Guerra, McEvoy, Bradley; Oppenheimer, Rrvik, Isaac, Parsons, Koch, Freeman and Wodtko--> |editor1=John T.

The long-standing traditional view is that the Celtic language, [[Ogham]] script and culture were brought to Ireland by waves of invading or migrating [[Celts]] from mainland Europe. This theory draws on the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'', a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland, along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artifacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The [[Priteni]] were said to be the first, followed by the [[Belgae]] from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, Laighin tribes from Armorica (present-day Brittany) were said to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] ([[Gaels]]) were said to have reached Ireland from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul.<ref>''The Celts: A History'', by Dáithí Ó hÓgáin</ref> It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the Belgae people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the sixth century BC. They were said to have given their name to the island.<ref>Early Peoples of Britain and Ireland: A-G Christopher Allen Snyder</ref><ref>"A History of Ireland: From the Earliest Times to 1922" By Edmund Curtis</ref>

The theory was advanced in part because of lack of archaeological evidence for large-scale Celtic [[immigration]], though it is accepted that such movements are notoriously difficult to identify. Historical linguists are skeptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of Celtic language, with some saying that an assumed processional view of Celtic linguistic formation is 'an especially hazardous exercise'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Waddell |first=John |title=Ireland in the Bronze Age |publisher=Irish Government Stationery Office |date=April 1995 |location=Dublin |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celts.pdf |archive-date=19 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319230912/http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celts.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Waddell |first=John |title=The Question of the Celticization of Ireland |publisher=Emania |date=September 1992 |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celticization_of_ire.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721151900/http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celticization_of_ire.pdf |archive-date=21 July 2015}}</ref> Genetic lineage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to Ireland has led to findings that showed no significant differences in [[mitochondrial DNA]] between Ireland and large areas of continental Europe, in contrast to parts of the Y-chromosome pattern. When taking both into account, a study concluded that modern Celtic speakers in Ireland could be thought of as European "Atlantic Celts" showing a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone from northern Iberia to western Scandinavia rather than substantially central European.<ref>{{cite journal |pmc=1182057 |title=The Longue Durée of Genetic Ancestry: Multiple Genetic Marker Systems and Celtic Origins on the Atlantic Facade of Europe |pmid=15309688 |doi=10.1086/424697 |volume=75 |issue=4 |date=October 2004 |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |pages=693–702 |last1=McEvoy |first1=B. |last2=Richards |first2=M. |last3=Forster |first3=P. |last4=Bradley |first4=D.G.}}</ref>

In 2012, research showed that occurrence of genetic markers for the earliest farmers was almost eliminated by Beaker-culture immigrants: they carried what was then a new Y-chromosome R1b marker, believed to have originated in Iberia about 2500 BC. The prevalence amongst modern Irish men of this mutation is a remarkable 84%, the highest in the world, and closely matched in other populations along the Atlantic fringes down to Spain. A similar genetic replacement happened with lineages in mitochondrial DNA.<ref name="Ireland's DNA"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Hay |first1=Maciamo |title=Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA) |url=http://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_R1b_Y-DNA.shtml |website=Eupedia |access-date=1 August 2015}}</ref> This conclusion is supported by recent research carried out by the geneticist [[David Reich (geneticist)|David Reich]], who says: “British and Irish skeletons from the Bronze Age that followed the Beaker period had at most 10 percent ancestry from the first farmers of these islands, with other 90 percent from people like those associated with the Bell Beaker culture in the Netherlands.” He suggests that it was Beaker users who introduced an Indo-European language, represented here by Celtic (i.e. a new language and culture introduced directly by migration and genetic replacement).<ref name="Reich 2018 115"/>

The earliest written records of Ireland come from classical [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] geographers. [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' refers to Ireland as ''Mikra Brettania'' ("Little Britain"), in contrast to the larger island, which he called ''Megale Brettania'' ("Great Britain").<ref>{{cite book |last=Freeman |first=Philip |title=Ireland and the classical world |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] |date=2001 |location=Austin, Texas |page=65 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSHhfOM-5AEC&pg=PA65 |isbn=978-0-292-72518-8}}</ref> In his later work, ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', Ptolemy refers to Ireland as ''[[Hibernia|Iouernia]]'' and to Great Britain as ''Albion''. These 'new' names were likely to have been the local names for the islands at the time.

Meath and notes on the coins and related finds'', pp. 35–55. Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, volume 77, section C</ref>

Ireland continued as a patchwork of rival kingdoms; however, beginning in the 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a [[High King of Ireland]]. [[Medieval Irish literature]] portrays an almost unbroken sequence of high kings stretching back thousands of years, but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.<ref name="DOC">{{lang|ga|[[Dáibhí Ó Cróinín]]}}, "Ireland, 400–800", in {{lang|ga|Dáibhí Ó Cróinín}} (ed.), ''A New History of Ireland 1: Prehistoric and Early Ireland'', Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 182–234.</ref>

On 1 May 1169, an expedition of [[Wales|Cambro]]-[[Norman people|Norman]] knights, with an army of about 600 men, landed at [[Bannow|Bannow Strand]] in present-day [[County Wexford]]. It was led by [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]], known as 'Strongbow' owing to his prowess as an archer.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chrisafis |first=Angelique |title=Scion of traitors and warlords: Why Bush is coy about his Irish links |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 January 2005 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jan/27/usa.angeliquechrisafis |access-date=8 November 2008 |location=London}}</ref> The invasion, which coincided with a period of renewed Norman expansion, was at the invitation of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada|Dermot Mac Murrough]], [[Kings of Leinster|King of Leinster]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Previté-Orton |title=The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1975 |page=[https://archive.org/details/shortercambridge0000prev/page/810 810] |isbn=978-0-521-09977-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/shortercambridge0000prev/page/810 }}</ref>

In 1166, Mac Murrough had fled to [[Anjou]], France, following a war involving [[Tighearnán Ua Ruairc]], of [[Breifne]], and sought the assistance of the [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] King [[King Henry II of England|Henry II]], in recapturing his kingdom. In 1171, Henry arrived in Ireland in order to review the general progress of the expedition. He wanted to re-exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control. Henry successfully re-imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro-Norman warlords and persuaded many of the Irish kings to accept him as their overlord, an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 [[Treaty of Windsor 1175|Treaty of Windsor]].

The invasion was legitimised by the provisions of the [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', issued by an Englishman, [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]], in 1155. The bull encouraged Henry to take control in Ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the [[Celtic Church|Irish Church]] and its integration into the Roman Church system.<ref name="Curtis 2002 49">{{Cite book |last=Curtis |first=Edmund |title=A History of Ireland from Earliest Times to 1922 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |date=2002 |page=49 |isbn=978-0-415-27949-9}}</ref> Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the [[Synod of Kells]] in 1152.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Ruth |last1=Edwards |display-authors=etal |title=An Atlas of Irish History |publisher=Routledge |date=2005 |page=106 |isbn=978-0-415-33952-0}}</ref> There has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of ''Laudabiliter'',<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last={{lang|ga|Ó Clabaigh}} |first=Colmán N. |date=2005 |title=Papacy |editor=Seán Duffy |encyclopedia=Medieval Ireland.

In 1172, Pope [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]] further encouraged Henry to advance the integration of the Irish Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution. This church levy, called [[Peter's Pence]], is extant in Ireland as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry accepted the title of [[Lord of Ireland]] which Henry conferred on his younger son, [[John Lackland]], in 1185. This defined the Irish state as the [[Lordship of Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} When Henry's successor died unexpectedly in 1199, [[John of England|John]] inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland.

Over the century that followed, Norman feudal law gradually replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law so that by the late 13th century the [[Hiberno-Norman|Norman-Irish]] had established a feudal system throughout much of Ireland. Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of the [[Magna Carta]] (the [[Great Charter of Ireland]]), substituting ''Dublin'' for ''London'' and the ''Irish Church'' for, the English church at the time, the ''Catholic Church'', was published in 1216 and the [[Parliament of Ireland]] was founded in 1297.

From the mid-14th century, after the [[Black Death]], Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the [[Parliament of Ireland#Middle Ages|Irish parliament]] passed the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/irish.pdf |title=The Great Irish Famine: Laws that Isolated and Impoverished the Irish |publisher=New Jersey Commission on Holocaust Education |date=1998 |website=Irish Famine Curriculum Committee |access-date=9 September 2011}}</ref>

By the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared, and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was dominant again. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as [[The Pale]], and under the provisions of [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] of 1494, the Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the [[English Privy Council]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pack |first=Mark |title=Charles James Fox, the Repeal of Poynings Law, and the Act of Union: 1782–1801 |journal=Journal of Liberal History |volume=33 |date=2001 |page=6 |url= http://www.markpack.org.uk/1288/charles-james-fox-the-repeal-of-poynings-law-and-the-act-of-union/ |access-date=23 March 2015}}</ref>

The title of [[King of Ireland]] was re-created in 1542 by [[Henry VIII]], the then [[King of England]], of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. English rule was reinforced and expanded in Ireland during the latter part of the 16th century, leading to the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]]. A near-complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century, following the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] and the [[Flight of the Earls]].

This control was consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century, including the English and Scottish colonisation in the [[Plantations of Ireland]], the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]]. Irish losses during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (which, in Ireland, included the [[Irish Confederacy]] and the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]) are estimated to include 20,000 battlefield casualties. 200,000 civilians are estimated to have died as a result of a combination of war-related famine, displacement, guerrilla activity and pestilence throughout the war.

The religious struggles of the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After the passing of [[Test Act#1672 Act|the Test Act 1672]], and the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] over the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. Under the emerging [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed in 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Laws in Ireland for the Suppression of Popery |publisher=University of Minnesota Law School |url= http://library.law.umn.edu/irishlaw/offices.html |access-date=23 January 2009}}</ref> The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].

The "[[Irish Famine (1740–1741)#Cause|Great Frost]]" struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741, after a decade of relatively mild winters.

In the aftermath of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared in the latter part of this century and the [[Georgian architecture|architectural legacy of Georgian]] Ireland was built. In 1782, [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.

===Union with Great Britain===

In 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the [[Society of United Irishmen]], with the aim of creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] to create a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref name="Ward 1994 28">{{cite book |last=Ward |first=Alan J. |title=The Irish Constitutional Tradition: Responsible Government and Modern Ireland, 1782–1992 |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |date=1994 |location=Washington, DC |page=28 |isbn=978-0-8132-0784-1}}</ref>

The passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799. According to contemporary documents and historical analysis, this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery, with funding provided by the British Secret Service Office, and the awarding of peerages, places and honours to secure votes.<ref name="Ward 1994 28"/> Thus, the parliament in Ireland was abolished and replaced by a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|united parliament at Westminster]] in [[London]], though resistance remained, as evidenced by [[Robert Emmet]]'s failed [[Irish Rebellion of 1803]].

Aside from the development of the [[linen]] industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the [[industrial revolution]], partly because it lacked coal and iron resources<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/ireland/AD1750-1900 |title=Ireland AD 1750–1900 The Industrial Age |website=WorldTimelines.org.uk |publisher=The British Museum |access-date=28 March 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101226180112/http://worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/ireland/AD1750-1900 |archive-date=26 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LamjgLbhTvwC&q=ireland+failed+to+industrialize+due+to+lack+of+coal+and+iron&pg=PA314 |first=Cormac |last=O'Grada |title=Ireland: A New Economic History, 1780–1939 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1994 |pages=314–330 |isbn=978-0-19-820598-2}}</ref> and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England,<ref>{{cite book |title=Culture and Capitalism in Contemporary Ireland |first1=Paul |last1=Keating |first2=Derry |last2=Desmond |publisher=Avebury Press |location=Hampshire, UK |date=1993 |isbn=978-1-85628-362-5 |page=119}}</ref> which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.<ref>{{cite journal |first=John |last=Jacobsen |title=Chasing Progress in the Irish Republic |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1994 |page=47}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Joel |last=Mokyr |title=Why Ireland Starved: A Quantitative and Analytical History of the Irish Economy, 1800–1850 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |location=Oxon |date=1983 |page=152}}</ref>

The 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of modern [[Irish nationalism]], primarily among the Roman Catholic population. The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was [[Daniel O'Connell]]. He was elected as Member of Parliament for [[Ennis (UK Parliament constituency)|Ennis]] in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat [[The Test Act|as a Roman Catholic]]. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Steering the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill]] through Parliament, aided by future prime minister [[Robert Peel]], Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George's father]] had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]], to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing [[Catholic Emancipation]] to be in conflict with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].

Daniel O'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or "[[Irish Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]]". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=376–400 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}</ref> After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914.

Their formation was followed in 1914 by the establishment of the [[Irish Volunteers]], whose aim was to ensure that the [[Third Home Rule Act|Home Rule Bill]] was passed. The Act was passed but with the "temporary" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster that would become Northern Ireland. Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the [[World War I|First World War]]. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under [[John Redmond]], took the name [[National Volunteers]] and supported [[Ireland and World War I|Irish involvement]] in the war. A minority, approximately 13,000, retained the Irish Volunteers' name and opposed Ireland's involvement in the war.<ref name="Kee 1972 478–530"/>

The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels. Support for [[Physical force Irish republicanism|Irish republicanism increased]] further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]].<ref name="autogenerated34">{{cite journal |last=Morough |first=Michael |title=History Review |date=December 2000 |pages=34–36}}</ref>

The pro-independence republican party, [[Sinn Féin]], received overwhelming endorsement in the [[1918 Irish general election|general election of 1918]], and in 1919 proclaimed an [[Irish Republic]], setting up its own parliament ({{lang|ga|[[First Dáil|Dáil Éireann]]}}) and government. Simultaneously the Volunteers, which became known as the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), launched a [[Irish War of Independence|three-year guerrilla war]], which ended in a truce in July 1921 (although violence continued until June 1922, mostly in Northern Ireland).<ref name="autogenerated34" />

===Partition===
{{Main|Partition of Ireland}}

In December 1921, the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] was concluded between the British government and representatives of the [[Second Dáil]]. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed [[Northern Ireland]] to remain within the United Kingdom, which (as expected) it immediately exercised. Additionally, Members of the [[Third Dáil|Free State Parliament]] were required to swear [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State]] and make a statement of faithfulness to the King.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=719–748 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}</ref> Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent [[Irish Civil War]] between the new government of the [[Irish Free State]] and those opposed to the treaty, led by [[Éamon de Valera]]. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gwynn |first=Stephen |title=Ireland Since the Treaty |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=12 |issue=2 |date=January 1934 |page=322 |doi=10.2307/20030588|jstor=20030588}}</ref>

====Independence====

[[File:Anglo-Irish Treaty Griffith annotated2.gif|thumb|Annotated page from the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] that established the [[Irish Free State]] and independence for 26 out of 32 [[Counties of Ireland|Irish counties]]]]
During its first decade, the newly formed [[Irish Free State]] was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera achieved power, he took advantage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] and [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|political circumstances]] to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted.<ref name="autogenerated34"/> This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the [[Republic of Ireland]].

[[Irish neutrality|The state was neutral]] during [[The Emergency (Ireland)|World War II]], but offered [[Irish neutrality during World War II|clandestine assistance to the Allies]], particularly in the potential defence of Northern Ireland.

The [[Abwehr|German intelligence]] was also active in Ireland.<ref name="autogenerated695">Hull, Mark: "The Irish Interlude: German Intelligence in Ireland, 1939–1943", ''Journal of Military History'', Vol. 66, No. 3 (July 2002), pp. 695–717</ref> Its operations ended in September 1941 when [[Garda Síochána|police]] made arrests based on surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Dublin. To the authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men at the start of the war, and with limited supplies of modern weapons, the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict.<ref name="autogenerated695"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Joseph T. |title=Ireland in the War Years 1939–1945 |publisher=International Scholars Publishers |date=2002 |location=San Francisco |page=190 |isbn=978-1-57309-185-5}}</ref>

Large-scale emigration marked most of the post-WWII period (particularly during the 1950s and 1980s), but beginning in 1987 the economy improved, and the 1990s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth. This period of growth became known as the [[Celtic Tiger]].<ref name=clancy3>{{cite book|last1=Clancy |first1=Patrick |first2=Sheelagh |last2=Drudy |first3=Kathleen |last3=Lynch |first4=Liam |last4=O'Dowd |title=Irish Society: Sociological Perspectives |pages=[https://archive.org/details/irishsociety00patr/page/68 68–70] |publisher=Institute of Public Administration |date=1997 |isbn=978-1-872002-87-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/irishsociety00patr/page/68 }}</ref> The Republic's real GDP grew by an average of 9.6% per annum between 1995 and 1999,<ref>{{cite book |first=Doris |last=Schmied |title=Winning and Losing: the Changing Geography of Europe's Rural Areas |publisher=Ashgate |location=Chippenham, UK |date=2005 |page=234 |isbn=978-0-7546-4101-8}}</ref> in which year the Republic joined the [[euro]].

F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]]  argues the cause was a combination of a new sense of initiative and the entry of American corporations. He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals, the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the [[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]. In addition [[European Union]] membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy.<ref>R. F. Foster, ''Luck and the Irish: A Brief History of Change 1970-2000'' (2007), pp 7-36.</ref>

Modernisation brought secularisation in its wake. The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: Irish feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion, and divorce undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the pedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.<ref>Foster, ''Luck and the Irish'' pp 37-66.</ref>

The [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial crisis]] that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom. GDP fell by 3% in 2008 and by 7.1% in 2009, the worst year since records began (although earnings by foreign-owned businesses continued to grow).<ref>{{cite news |first=Shawn |last=Pogatchnik |title=Ireland's Economy Suffered Record Slump in 2009 |work=[[Business Week]] |date=25 March 2010 |access-date=6 April 2010 |url= http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9ELOCOG1.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150208020158/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9ELOCOG1.htm |archive-date=8 February 2015}}</ref> The state has since experienced deep recession, with unemployment, which doubled during 2009, remaining above 14% in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |title=Measuring Ireland's Progress 2011 |website=CSO.ie |publisher=[[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] |date=October 2012 |page=36 |url= http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/otherreleases/2011/measuringirelandsprogress2011.pdf |issn=1649-6728 |access-date=30 August 2015}}</ref>

====Northern Ireland====
{{Main|History of Northern Ireland|Economy of Northern Ireland}}
Northern Ireland resulted from the division of the United Kingdom by the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]], and until 1972 was a self-governing jurisdiction within the United Kingdom with its own parliament and prime minister. Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War, and [[Belfast Blitz|Belfast suffered four bombing raids]] in 1941. [[Conscription]] was not extended to Northern Ireland, and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the south.

[[File:Carson signing Solemn League and Covenant.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Carson]] signing the [[Ulster Covenant|Solemn League and Covenant]] in 1912, declaring opposition to [[Irish Home Rule bills|Home Rule]] "using all means which may be found necessary"]]

Although Northern Ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war, in decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter-communal violence. Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along [[sectarian]] lines, meaning that the government of Northern Ireland (elected by [[Plurality electoral system|"first-past-the-post"]] from 1929) was controlled by the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as [[gerrymandering]] and discrimination in housing and employment.<ref name=whyte>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |chapter=How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921–1968? |last=Whyte |first=John |editor-first1=Tom |editor-last1=Gallagher |editor-first2=James |editor-last2=O'Connell |title=Contemporary Irish Studies |isbn=0-7190-0919-7 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |via=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] |year=1983 |access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cmd380.htm |title=Fair Employment in Northern Ireland |isbn=0-10-103802-X |year= 1988 |access-date=23 October 2008 |author=Northern Ireland Office |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |via=Conflict Archive on the Internet|author-link=Northern Ireland Office }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/nicra/nicra78.htm |title='We Shall Overcome' ...

In the late 1960s, nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass civil rights protests, which were often confronted by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] counter-protests.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Taylor |first=Peter |date=1997 |title=Provos: The IRA and {{lang|ga|Sinn Féin}} |pages=33–56 |location=London |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-0-7475-3392-4}}</ref> The government's reaction to confrontations was seen to be one-sided and heavy-handed in favour of unionists.

In 1969, the [[paramilitary]] [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]], which favoured the creation of a [[united Ireland]], emerged from a split in the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] and began a campaign against what it called the "British occupation of the six counties".{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Other groups, on both the unionist side and the nationalist side, participated in violence and a period known as [[the Troubles]] began. Over 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/467904.stm |title=Turning the pages on lost lives |work=BBC News Online |access-date=4 January 2010 |date=8 October 1999}}</ref> Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the British government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]]. There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.

The substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional [[Northern Ireland Executive|Executive]] drawn from the major parties in a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]] drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning|independent commission]] supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/decommission/iicd190106.pdf |first1=Tauno |last1=Nieminen |first2=John |last2=de Chastelain |author3=Andrew D. Sens |title=Independent International Commission on Decommissioning |access-date=15 October 2008}}</ref>

The Assembly and power-sharing Executive were suspended several times but were restored again in 2007. In that year the British government officially ended its military support of the police in Northern Ireland ([[Operation Banner]]) and began withdrawing troops.
On 27 June 2012, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister and former IRA commander, [[Martin McGuinness]], shook hands with Queen Elizabeth II in Belfast, symbolising reconciliation between the two sides.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Ireland}}
[[File:Map of Ireland's capitals.png|thumb|upright|Political entities on the island of Ireland]]
The island is divided between the Republic of Ireland, an independent [[Sovereign state|state]], and Northern Ireland (a constituent country of the [[United Kingdom]]). They share an [[Irish border|open border]] and both are part of the [[Common Travel Area]].

The Republic of Ireland is a member of the [[European Union]] while the United Kingdom is a former member, having both acceded to its precursor entity, the European Economic Community [EEC], in 1973, and as a consequence there is [[internal market|free movement of people, goods, services and capital]] across the border.

===Republic of Ireland===
[[File:Áras an Uachtaráin 2010.jpg|thumb|{{lang|ga|[[Áras an Uachtaráin]]}}, the official residence of the [[President of Ireland]]]]
The [[Republic of Ireland]] is a [[parliamentary democracy]] based on the British model, with a [[Constitution of Ireland|written constitution]] and a popularly elected president who has mostly ceremonial powers. The [[Government of Ireland|government]] is headed by a prime minister, the [[Taoiseach]], who is appointed by the [[President of Ireland|President]] on the nomination of the lower house of parliament, the [[Dáil Éireann|''Dáil'']]. Members of the government are chosen from both the {{lang|ga|Dáil}} and the upper house of parliament, the [[Seanad Éireann|''Seanad'']]. Its capital is [[Dublin]].

The republic today ranks amongst the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of [[GDP per capita]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Country Comparison: GDP&nbsp;– per capita (PPP) |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html?countryName=Ireland&countryCode=ei&regionCode=eur&rank=27#ei |website=World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |access-date=29 August 2011}}</ref> and in 2015 was ranked the sixth most developed nation in the world by the United Nations' [[Human Development Index]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2015_human_development_report.pdf |page=47 |title=Human Development Report 2015: Table A1.1 |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) |date=2015 |website=Human Development Index and its components |access-date=30 November 2016}}</ref> A period of rapid economic expansion from 1995 onwards became known as the [[Celtic Tiger]] period, was brought to an end in 2008 with an unprecedented [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial crisis]] and an economic depression in 2009.

===Northern Ireland===
[[File:StormontCarson.jpg|thumb|[[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]], in [[Stormont Estate]], seat of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]]]
[[Northern Ireland]] is a part of the [[United Kingdom]] with a local [[Northern Ireland Executive|executive]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|assembly]] which exercise devolved powers. The executive is jointly headed by the first and deputy first minister, with the ministries being allocated in proportion with each party's representation in the assembly. Its capital is [[Belfast]].

Ultimately political power is held by the [[UK government]], from which Northern Ireland has gone through intermittent periods of direct rule during which devolved powers have been suspended. Northern Ireland elects 18 of the UK [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]' 650 MPs. The [[Northern Ireland Secretary]] is a cabinet-level post in the British government.

Along with [[England and Wales]] and with Scotland, Northern Ireland forms one of the three separate legal jurisdictions of the UK, all of which share the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] as their court of final appeal.

===All-island institutions===
As part of the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish governments agreed on the creation of all-island institutions and areas of cooperation. The [[North/South Ministerial Council]] is an institution through which ministers from the Government of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive agree all-island policies. At least six of these policy areas must have an associated all-island "implementation bodies," and at least six others must be implemented separately in each jurisdiction. The implementation bodies are: [[Waterways Ireland]], the [[Food Safety Promotion Board]], [[InterTradeIreland]], the [[Special European Union Programmes Body]], [[the North/South Language Body]] and the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights|Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission]].

The [[British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] provides for co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on all matters of mutual interest, especially Northern Ireland. In light of the Republic's particular interest in the governance of Northern Ireland, "regular and frequent" meetings co-chaired by the ROI Minister for Foreign Affairs and the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, dealing with non-devolved matters to do with Northern Ireland and non-devolved [[all-Ireland]] issues, are required to take place under the establishing treaty.

The [[North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association]] is a joint parliamentary forum for the island of Ireland. It has no formal powers but operates as a forum for discussing matters of common concern between the respective legislatures.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Republic of Ireland|Economy of Northern Ireland}}
{{See also|International Financial Services Centre}}
Despite the two jurisdictions using two distinct currencies (the [[euro]] and [[pound sterling]]), a growing amount of commercial activity is carried out on an all-Ireland basis. This has been facilitated by the two jurisdictions' shared membership of the European Union, and there have been calls from members of the business community and policymakers for the creation of an "all-Ireland economy" to take advantage of [[economies of scale]] and boost competitiveness.<ref>{{cite web |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081028204341/http://www.forfas.ie/ncc/reports/ncc_ndp_submission/ncc061114_ndp_submission_dept_finance_webopt.pdf |archive-date=28 October 2008 |url= http://www.forfas.ie/ncc/reports/ncc_ndp_submission/ncc061114_ndp_submission_dept_finance_webopt.pdf |date=2006 |title=National Competitiveness Council Submission on the National Development Plan 2007–2013 |publisher=National Competitiveness Council |url-status=dead |access-date=28 October 2016}}</ref>

Ireland has an ancient industry based on [[peat]] (known locally as "turf") as a source of energy for home fires. A form of [[biomass]] energy, this source of heat is still widely used in [[rural]] areas. However, because of the ecological importance of peatlands in storing carbon and their rarity, the EU is attempting to protect this habitat by fining Ireland for digging up peat. In cities, heat is generally supplied by [[natural gas]] or [[heating oil]], although some urban suppliers distribute sods of turf as "smokeless fuel" for domestic use.

The island operates as a single market for electricity.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sem-o.com/AboutSEMO/Pages/default.aspx |title= About SEMO: The Single Electricity Market |publisher= Single Electricity Market Operator (SEMO) |access-date= 13 January 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101130095246/http://www.sem-o.com/AboutSEMO/Pages/default.aspx |archive-date= 30 November 2010 |url-status= dead }}</ref> For much of their existence, electricity networks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post-partition.

The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying [[Northern Ireland Electricity]] with enough power. In the Republic of Ireland, the [[ESB Group|ESB]] has failed to modernise its power stations, and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. [[EirGrid]] has started building a [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW,<ref>{{cite web |title= Interconnection: East-West Interconnector |publisher= [[EirGrid]] |url= http://www.eirgridgroup.com/customer-and-industry/interconnection/ |access-date= 19 September 2016}}</ref> about 10% of Ireland's peak demand.

{{Main|Geography of Ireland}}
[[File:Ireland physical large.png|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Physical features of Ireland]]

Ireland is located in the [[North-West Europe|north-west of Europe]], between latitudes [[51st parallel north|51°]] and [[56th parallel north|56° N]], and longitudes [[11th meridian west|11°]] and [[5th meridian west|5° W]].

As [[British Isles naming dispute|the term British Isles is controversial]] in relation to Ireland, the alternate term ''Britain and Ireland'' is often used as a neutral term for the islands.

A ring of coastal mountains surround low plains at the centre of the island.

=== Geology ===
The island consists of varied [[geologic province|geological provinces]]. In the west, around County Galway and [[County Donegal]], is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of [[Caledonides|Caledonide]] affinity, similar to the [[Scottish Highlands]]. Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to [[Longford]] and south to [[Navan]] is a province of [[Ordovician]] and [[Silurian]] rocks, with similarities to the [[Southern Uplands]] province of Scotland.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Ireland}}

The island's lush vegetation, a product of its mild climate and frequent rainfall, earns it the sobriquet ''the Emerald Isle''. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable [[oceanic climate]] with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is [[Temperate climate|temperate]], avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.<ref name="MEclimate">{{cite web |title=Climate of Ireland |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met Éireann}}|url= http://www.met.ie/climate/climate-of-ireland.asp |access-date=11 November 2008}}</ref> This is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the southwestern Atlantic.

Precipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas.<ref name="MErainfall">{{cite web |title=Rainfall |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met Éireann}} |url= http://www.met.ie/climate/rainfall.asp |access-date=5 November 2008}}</ref> [[Munster]], in the south, records the least snow whereas [[Ulster]], in the north, records the most.

Inland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter. Usually around 40 days of the year are below freezing {{nowrap|0&nbsp;°C}} {{nowrap|(32&nbsp;°F)}} at inland [[weather station]]s, compared to 10 days at coastal stations. Ireland is sometimes affected by heatwaves, most recently in 1995, [[2003 European heat wave|2003]], [[2006 European heat wave#Ireland|2006]], 2013 and [[2018 British Isles heat wave|2018]]. In common with the rest of Europe, Ireland experienced unusually cold weather during [[Winter of 2010–11 in Great Britain and Ireland|the winter of 2010-11]]. Temperatures fell as low as −17.2&nbsp;°C (1&nbsp;°F) in County Mayo on 20 December<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/subzero-temperatures-make-2010-a-recordbreaking-year-26609480.html |title=Sub-zero temperatures make 2010 a record-breaking year |first=Kevin |last=Keane |work=[[Irish Independent]] |date=28 December 2010 |access-date=21 July 2011}}</ref> and up to a metre (3&nbsp;ft) of snow fell in mountainous areas.

Because Ireland became isolated from [[mainland Europe]] by rising sea levels before the [[Last Glacial Period|last ice age]] had completely finished, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain or mainland Europe. There are [[List of mammals of Ireland|55 mammal species]] in Ireland, and of them only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland.<ref name="Costello, M.J 93" >Costello, M.J. and Kelly, K.S., 1993 ''Biogeography of Ireland: past, present and future'' Irish Biogeographic Society Occasional Publications Number 2</ref> Some species, such as, the [[red fox]], [[European hedgehog|hedgehog]] and [[European badger|badger]], are very common, whereas others, like the [[Mountain hare|Irish hare]], [[red deer]] and [[pine marten]] are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the [[barn swallow]].

Several different habitat types are found in Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]], [[conifer]] plantations, [[peat]] bogs and a variety of coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves,<ref name="www2000">{{cite web |title=Land cover and land use |website=Environmental Assessment |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency [Ireland] |location=Wexford |date=2011 |url= http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/assessment/land/ |access-date=15 August 2011}}</ref> particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no large [[apex predator]]s in Ireland other than humans and dogs, such populations of animals as semi-wild deer that cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual [[culling]].

There are no snakes in Ireland, and only one species of reptile (the [[Viviparous lizard|common lizard]]) is native to the island.

Because of its mild climate, many species, including [[subtropics|sub-tropical]] species such as [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], are grown in Ireland. [[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. The island can be subdivided into two [[ecoregion]]s: the Celtic broadleaf forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests.

===Impact of agriculture===
[[File:Pasture at the Viewpoint - geograph.org.uk - 15065.jpg|thumb|[[Bantry]], [[County Cork]]]]
The long history of agricultural production, coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and runoff from contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes, has placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.clarecoco.ie/water-waste-environment/biodiversity/ |title=Biodiversity |publisher=Clare County Council |access-date=26 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.belfasthills.org/minisite/adult_version/draftottersapmar07-2.pdf |title=Otter Lutra Lutra |website=Northern Ireland Species Action Plan |publisher=Environment and Heritage Service |date=2007 |access-date=1 January 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110205005310/http://www.belfasthills.org/minisite/adult_version/draftottersapmar07-2.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 February 2011}}</ref> A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.<ref name="cap_reforms">{{cite web |title=CAP Reform – A Long-term Perspective for Sustainable Agriculture |website=Agriculture and Rural Development |publisher=European Commission |url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm |access-date=30 July 2007}}</ref> 32% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.ie/irelandsenvironment/climate/|title=Climate Change Causes|date=2014|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)]]|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref>

Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by [[Deer of Ireland|deer]] and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Dick |last=Roche |author-link=Dick Roche |title=National Parks |publisher={{lang|ga|[[Seanad Éireann]]}} |url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0185/S.0185.200611080008.html |volume=185 |date=8 November 2006 |access-date=30 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091047/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0185/S.0185.200611080008.html |archive-date=11 May 2011  }} {{lang|ga|[[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]]}} Debate involving Former Minister for Environment Heritage and Local Government</ref>

People have lived in Ireland for over 9,000 years. Early historical and genealogical records note the existence of major groups such as the {{lang|ga|[[Cruthin]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Corcu Loígde]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Dál Riata]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Dáirine]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Deirgtine]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Delbhna]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Érainn]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Laigin]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Ulaid]]}}. Later major groups included the {{lang|ga|[[Connachta]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Ciannachta]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Eóganachta]]}}. Smaller groups included the {{lang|ga|aithechthúatha}} (see {{lang|ga|[[Attacotti]]}}), {{lang|ga|[[Cálraighe]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Cíarraige]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Conmaicne]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Dartraighe]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Déisi]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Éile]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Fir Bolg]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Fortuatha]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Gailenga]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Gamanraige]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Mairtine]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Múscraige]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Partraige]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Soghain]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Uaithni]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Uí Maine]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Uí Liatháin]]}}. Many survived into late medieval times, others vanished as they became politically unimportant. Over the past 1,200 years, [[Vikings]], [[Normans]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Flemings]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[English people|English]], [[Africans]], [[Eastern Europeans]] and [[South Americans]] have all added to the population and have had significant influences on Irish culture.

The population of Ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid-19th century, interrupted briefly by the [[Irish Famine (1740–41)|Famine of 1740–41]], which killed roughly two fifths of the island's population. The population rebounded and multiplied over the next century, but the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century, the population was reduced by over half, at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.

Ireland's largest religious group is [[Christianity]]. The largest denomination is [[Roman Catholicism]], representing over 73% for the island (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland). Most of the rest of the population adhere to one of the various [[Protestant]] denominations (about 48% of Northern Ireland).<ref name="niprotestants">{{Cite news |last=McKittrick |first=David |title=Census Reveals Northern Ireland's Protestant Population is at Record Low |work=[[The Independent]] |date=19 December 2002 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/census-reveals-northern-irelands-protestant-population-is-at-record-low-611500.html |access-date=30 December 2009 |location=London |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110624101635/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/census-reveals-northern-irelands-protestant-population-is-at-record-low-611500.html |archive-date=24 June 2011}}</ref> The largest is the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]].

===Divisions and settlements===
{{Further|Provinces of Ireland|Counties of Ireland|City status in Ireland}}
{{Provinces of Ireland-200px wide}}
Traditionally, Ireland is subdivided into [[Provinces of Ireland|four provinces]]: [[Connacht]] (west), [[Leinster]] (east), [[Munster]] (south), and [[Ulster]] (north). In a system that developed between the 13th and 17th centuries,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Crawford |first=John |title=Anglicizing the Government of Ireland: The Irish Privy Council and the Expansion of Tudor Rule 1556–1578 |publisher=Irish Academic Press |date=1993 |isbn=978-0-7165-2498-4}}</ref> Ireland has [[Counties of Ireland|32 traditional counties]]. Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland, and [[Counties of Northern Ireland|six are in Northern Ireland]]. The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland are all in the province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total). As such, ''Ulster'' is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous.

In the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government. Counties [[County Dublin|Dublin]], [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Limerick|Limerick]], [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Waterford|Waterford]] and [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example, postal addresses and by the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]]. Counties in Northern Ireland are [[Local government in Northern Ireland|no longer used]] for local governmental purposes,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gazetteer.co.uk/section1.htm |title=The Gazetteer of British Place Names: Main features of the Gazetteer |website=Gazetteer of British Place Names |publisher=Association of British Counties |access-date=23 January 2010}}</ref> but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/destinationNI/ |title=NI by County |website=Discover Northern Ireland |publisher=Northern Ireland Tourist Board |access-date=15 October 2010}}</ref>

City status in Ireland is decided by [[legislation|legislative]] or [[royal charter]]. [[Dublin]], with over 1 million residents in the [[Greater Dublin Area]], is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern Ireland. City status does not directly equate with population size. For example, [[Armagh]], with 14,590 is the seat of the [[Church of Ireland]] and the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Primate of All Ireland]] and was re-granted [[City status in the United Kingdom#Northern Ireland|city status]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1994 (having lost that status in [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840|local government reforms of 1840]]). In the Republic of Ireland, [[Kilkenny]], seat of the [[Butler dynasty]], while no longer a city for administrative purposes (since the 2001 [[Local Government Act 2001|Local Government Act]]), is entitled by law to continue to use the description.

===Migration===

The population of Ireland collapsed dramatically during the second half of the 19th century. A population of over 8 million in 1841 was reduced to slightly more than 4 million by 1921. In part, the fall in population was caused by death from the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1845 to 1852, which took about 1 million lives. However, by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the 21st century.

Emigration from Ireland in the 19th century contributed to the populations of England, the United States, Canada and Australia, in all of which a large [[Irish diaspora]] lives. {{As of|2006}}, 4.3 million Canadians, or 14% of the population, were of Irish descent,<ref>"[http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo=PR&Code=01&Table=2&Data=Count&StartRec=1&Sort=3&Display=All&CSDFilter=5000 Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories – 20% sample data]".

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Ireland}}
[[File:Irish speakers in 2011.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Proportion of respondents who said they could speak Irish in the Ireland census in 2011 or the Northern Ireland census in 2011]]
The two official languages of the Republic of Ireland are Irish and English. Each language has produced noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the [[Iron Age]]. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx Language|Manx]] languages respectively.

The Irish language has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into [[Old Irish]] from the 6th to 10th century, [[Middle Irish]] from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[Anglo-Norman language|French]] and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.

The [[Gaelic Revival]] of the early 20th century has had a long-term influence.

Traditional rural Irish-speaking areas, known collectively as the {{lang|ga|[[Gaeltacht]]}}, are in linguistic decline. The main {{lang|ga|Gaeltacht}} areas are in the west, south-west and north-west. They are to be found in Donegal, Mayo, Galway, western Cork and Kerry with smaller {{lang|ga|Gaeltacht}} areas near [[Dungarvan]] in Waterford, [[Navan]] in Meath.<ref>{{cite web |title=Where are Ireland's Gaeltacht areas? |website=FAQ |publisher={{lang|ga|[[Údarás na Gaeltachta]]}} |date=2015 |url= http://www.udaras.ie/en/faoin-laithrean-seo/ceisteanna-coitianta |access-date=9 September 2015}}</ref>

[[Hiberno-English|English in Ireland]] was first introduced during the Norman invasion. It was spoken by a few peasants and merchants brought over from England, and was largely replaced by Irish before the Tudor conquest of Ireland. It was introduced as the official language with the Tudor and Cromwellian conquests. The Ulster plantations gave it a permanent foothold in Ulster, and it remained the official and upper-class language elsewhere, the Irish-speaking chieftains and nobility having been deposed. Language shift during the 19th century replaced Irish with English as the first language for a vast majority of the population.<ref>{{cite book |last=Spolsky |first=Bernard |title=Language policy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2004 |page=191 |isbn=978-0521011754}}</ref>

Less than 10% of the population of the Republic of Ireland today speak Irish regularly outside of the education system<ref>{{cite web |title=Table 15: Irish speakers aged 3 years and over in each Province, County and City, classified by frequency of speaking Irish, 2006 |website=Census 2006 |volume=Volume 9 – Irish Language |publisher=Central Statistics Office |url=http://beyond2020.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=75639 |access-date=9 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227165829/http://beyond2020.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=75639 |archive-date=27 February 2009  }}</ref> and 38% of those over 15 years are classified as "Irish speakers".

Ireland's culture comprises elements of the culture of ancient peoples, later immigrant and broadcast cultural influences (chiefly [[Gaels|Gaelic culture]], [[Anglicisation]], [[Americanisation]] and aspects of broader [[European culture]]). In broad terms, Ireland is regarded as one of the [[Celtic nations]] of Europe, alongside Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, [[Isle of Man]] and [[Brittany]]. This combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed ''Irish [[Interlace (visual arts)|interlace]]'' or ''[[Celtic knot]]work.'' These can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works. The style is still popular today in jewellery and graphic art,<ref name="BBC 1">{{cite news |title=Tionchar na gCeilteach |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/irish/articles/view/720/english/ |access-date=23 January 2010 |date=23 May 2009 |work=BBC News Online}}</ref> as is the distinctive style of [[traditional Irish music]] and dance, and has become indicative of modern "Celtic" culture in general.

[[Religion in Ireland|Religion]] has played a significant role in the cultural life of the island since ancient times (and since the 17th century [[Plantations of Ireland|plantations]], has been the focus of political identity and divisions on the island). Ireland's pre-Christian heritage fused with the [[Celtic Church]] following the missions of [[Saint Patrick]] in the 5th century. The [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]s, begun by the Irish monk Saint [[Columba]], spread the [[Celtic Christianity|Irish vision of Christianity]] to [[pagan]] [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]] and the [[Frankish Empire]]. These missions brought written language to an illiterate population of Europe during the Dark Ages that followed the [[fall of Rome]], earning Ireland the sobriquet, "the island of saints and scholars".

Since the 20th century [[Irish pub]]s worldwide have become outposts of Irish culture, especially those with a full range of cultural and gastronomic offerings.

The Republic of Ireland's national theatre is the [[Abbey Theatre]], which was founded in 1904, and the national Irish-language theatre is {{lang|ga|[[An Taibhdhearc]]}}, which was established in 1928 in [[Galway]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Stair na Taibhdheirce |publisher={{lang|ga|An Taibhdheirce}} |date=2014 |url= http://antaibhdhearc.com/theatre-info/fuinn/ |access-date= 28 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=An Taibhdhearc |publisher=Fodor's |url= http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/ireland/county-clare-galway-and-the-aran-islands |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141002060446/http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/ireland/county-clare-galway-and-the-aran-islands/ |archive-date=2 October 2014}}</ref> Playwrights such as [[Seán O'Casey]], [[Brian Friel]], [[Sebastian Barry]], [[Conor McPherson]] and [[Billy Roche]] are internationally renowned.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Houston |first=Eugenie |title=Working and Living in Ireland |publisher=Working and Living Publications |date=2001 |isbn=978-0-9536896-8-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/workinglivingini00euge/page/253 253] |url=https://archive.org/details/workinglivingini00euge/page/253 }}</ref>

====Literature====
Ireland has made a large contribution to world literature in all its branches, both in Irish and English. Poetry in Irish is among the oldest [[vernacular literature|vernacular poetry]] in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.
Irish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on. Prominent names from the medieval period and later include {{lang|ga|[[Gofraidh Fionn Ó Dálaigh]]}} (fourteenth century), {{lang|ga|[[Dáibhí Ó Bruadair]]}} (seventeenth century) and [[Aogán Ó Rathaille]] (eighteenth century). {{lang|ga|[[Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill]]}} (c. 1743 – c. 1800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition. The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English. By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the [[Gaelic revival]], which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish. This was to produce a number of notable writers, including {{lang|ga|[[Máirtín Ó Cadhain]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Máire Mhac an tSaoi]]}} and others. Irish-language publishers such as {{lang|ga|[[Coiscéim]]}} and {{lang|ga|[[Cló Iar-Chonnacht]]}} continue to produce scores of titles every year.

In English, [[Jonathan Swift]], often called the foremost [[satirist]] in the English language, gained fame for works such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[A Modest Proposal]]''. Other notable 18th-century writers of Irish origin included [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], though they spent most of their lives in England. The Anglo-Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as [[Charles Kickham]], [[William Carleton]], and (in collaboration) [[Edith Somerville]] and [[Violet Florence Martin]]. The playwright and poet [[Oscar Wilde]], noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.

In the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]: [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Although not a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[James Joyce]] is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce's 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is considered one of the most important works of [[Modernist literature]] and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as "[[Bloomsday]]".<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Bloomsday? |publisher=James Joyce Centre |url= http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140916080551/http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |archive-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> A comparable writer in Irish is {{lang|ga|[[Máirtín Ó Cadhain]]}}, whose novel {{lang|ga|[[Cré na Cille]]}} is regarded as a modernist masterpiece and has been translated into several languages.

Modern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage<ref>{{Cite book |first=Andrew |last=Higgins Wyndham |title=Re-imagining Ireland |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |date=2006}}</ref> through English-language writers such as [[John McGahern]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] and Irish-language writers such as {{lang|ga|[[Máirtín Ó Direáin]]}} and others from the {{lang|ga|[[Gaeltacht]]}}.

====Music====
Music has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times.<ref>O'Dwyer, Simon: ''Prehistoric Music in Ireland'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus Publishing, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3129-3}}.</ref> Although in the early Middle Ages the church was "quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe",<ref>Brannon, Patrick V.: "Medieval Ireland: Music in Cathedral, Church and Cloister", in: ''Early Music'' 28.2 (May 2000), p. 193.</ref> there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as [[Gregorian chant]]. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (''goltraige''), laughing music (''geantraige'') and sleeping music (''suantraige'').<ref>Buckley, Ann: "Medieval Ireland, Music in", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', ed. by [[Harry White (musicologist)|Harry White]] and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-906359-78-2}}, p. 659.</ref> Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various [[string instrument]]s) was transmitted orally, but the [[Irish harp]], in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as [[Dublin Castle]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known [[List of Irish classical composers|Irish composers]] of this time belong to emigrants.

Irish [[folk music|traditional music]] and [[dance]] has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music had fallen out of favour, especially in urban areas.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Geraghty |first=Des |title=Luke Kelly: A Memoir |publisher=Basement Press |date=1994 |pages=26–30 |isbn=978-1-85594-090-1}}</ref> However during the 1960s, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as [[The Dubliners]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Wolfe Tones]], the [[Clancy Brothers]], [[Sweeney's Men]] and individuals like {{lang|ga|[[Seán Ó Riada]]}} and [[Christy Moore]]. Groups and musicians including [[Horslips]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary [[rock music]] and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like [[Enya]], [[The Saw Doctors]], [[The Corrs]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[The Cranberries]] and [[The Pogues]] among others.

====Art====
The earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as [[Newgrange]]<ref>{{Cite book |last1=O'Kelly |first1=Michael J. |last2=O'Kelly |first2=Claire |title=Newgrange: Archaeology Art and Legend |publisher=Thames and Hudson |date=1982 |location=London |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bGiMHQAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-500-27371-5}}</ref> and is traced through [[Bronze Age]] artefacts and the religious carvings and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the medieval period. During the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, a strong tradition of painting emerged, including such figures as [[John Butler Yeats]], [[William Orpen]], [[Jack Yeats]] and [[Louis le Brocquy]]. Contemporary Irish visual artists of note include [[Sean Scully]], [[Kevin Abosch]], and [[Alice Maher]].

===Science===
[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Boyle]] formulated Boyle's Law.]]
The Irish philosopher and theologian [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] was considered one of the leading intellectuals of the early Middle Ages. Sir [[Ernest Henry Shackleton]], an Irish explorer, was one of the principal figures of Antarctic exploration. He, along with his expedition, made the first ascent of [[Mount Erebus]] and the discovery of the approximate location of the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. [[Robert Boyle]] was a 17th-century natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, inventor and early [[gentleman scientist]]. He is largely regarded as one of the founders of modern chemistry and is best known for the formulation of [[Boyle's law]].<ref name="ucc boyle boi">{{cite web |last=Reville |first=William |title=Ireland's Scientific Heritage |website=Understanding Science: Famous Irish Scientists |publisher=[[University College Cork]], Faculty of Science |date=14 December 2000 |url= http://undersci.ucc.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2014/11/Robert_Boyle.pdf |access-date=30 August 2015}}</ref>

19th-century physicist, [[John Tyndall]], discovered the [[Tyndall effect]]. [[Father Nicholas Joseph Callan]], Professor of Natural Philosophy in [[Maynooth College]], is best known for his invention of the [[induction coil]], [[transformer]] and he discovered an early method of [[galvanisation]] in the 19th century.

Other notable Irish [[physicists]] include [[Ernest Walton]], winner of the 1951 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. With [[Sir John Douglas Cockcroft]], he was the first to split the nucleus of the atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of [[wave equation]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1951/press.html?print=1 |title=Nobel Prize in Physics 1951 – Presentation Speech |first=Professor I. |last=Waller |website=NobelPrize.org |publisher=Alfred Nobel Memorial Foundation |date=1951 |access-date=4 April 2012}}</ref> William Thomson, or [[Lord Kelvin]], is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the [[kelvin]], is named after.

[[George Johnstone Stoney]] introduced the term ''[[electron]]'' in 1891. [[John Stewart Bell]] was the originator of [[Bell's Theorem]] and a paper concerning the discovery of the [[Chiral anomaly|Bell-Jackiw-Adler anomaly]] and was nominated for a Nobel prize.<ref>{{cite news |title=John Bell: Belfast street named after physicist who proved Einstein wrong |work=BBC News Online |date=19 February 2015 |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-31536765 |access-date=30 August 2015}}</ref> The astronomer [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], from [[Lurgan]], [[County Armagh]], discovered pulsars in 1967. Notable mathematicians include Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]], famous for work in [[Hamiltonian mechanics|classical mechanics]] and the invention of [[quaternions]]. [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]]'s contribution of the [[Edgeworth Box]] remains influential in neo-classical microeconomic theory to this day; while [[Richard Cantillon]] inspired [[Adam Smith]], among others. [[John B. Cosgrave]] was a specialist in [[number theory]] and discovered a 2000-digit [[prime number]] in 1999 and a record composite [[Fermat number]] in 2003. [[John Lighton Synge]] made progress in different fields of science, including mechanics and geometrical methods in general relativity. He had mathematician [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]] as one of his students. [[Kathleen Lonsdale]], born in Ireland and most known for her work with [[X-ray crystallography|crystallography]], became the first female president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.science.ie/features/archived-feature-articles/five-irish-scientists.html |title=Five Irish Scientists Who Put Chemistry on the Map |work=Science.ie |publisher=Science Foundation Ireland |access-date=24 November 2016}}</ref>

Ireland has nine universities, seven in the Republic of Ireland and two in Northern Ireland, including [[Trinity College, Dublin]] and the [[University College Dublin]], as well as numerous third-level colleges and institutes and a branch of the Open University, the [[Open University in Ireland]].

The island fields a single international team in most sports. One notable exception to this is association football, although both associations continued to field international teams under the name "Ireland" until the 1950s. The sport is also the most notable exception where the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] field separate international teams. Northern Ireland has produced two World Snooker Champions.

[[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic handball|handball]] are the best-known of the Irish traditional sports, collectively known as [[Gaelic games]]. Gaelic games are governed by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA), with the exception of ladies' Gaelic football and camogie (women's variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations. The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at the 82,500<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.crokepark.ie/ |title=Croke Park. Not just a venue. A destination |publisher=Croke Park Stadium / Gaelic Athletic Association |access-date=3 October 2007}}</ref> capacity [[Croke Park]] in north Dublin. Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]]. During the redevelopment of the [[Lansdowne Road|Lansdowne Road stadium]] in 2007–2010, international rugby and soccer were played there.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/05/AR2007020501459.html |title=For First Time, Croke Park Is Ireland's Common Ground |date=6 February 2007 |access-date=14 August 2008 |work=The Washington Post |first=Michael |last=Moynihan}}</ref> All GAA players, even at the highest level, are amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.

The [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA) was originally the governing body for soccer across the island. The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with [[Cliftonville F.C.]] in Belfast being Ireland's oldest club. It was most popular, especially in its first decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an [[Irish Cup]] semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast,<ref>{{cite web |title=FAI History: 1921–1930 |publisher=Football Association of Ireland |date=5 June 2009 |url= http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=222&Itemid=226 |access-date=30 December 2009}}</ref> Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association is known as the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the [[Home Nations]]' associations, the FAI was recognised by [[FIFA]] in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against [[Italy national football team|Italy]]). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as ''Ireland''.

[[File:Paul O'Connell Ireland Rugby.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul O'Connell]] reaching for the ball during a [[Line-out (rugby union)|line out]] against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] in 2007.]]
In 1950, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in 1953, directed that the FAI's team be known only as "[[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]" and that the IFA's team be known as "[[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]" (with certain exceptions). Northern Ireland qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] finals in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] (reaching the quarter-finals), [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]]. The Republic qualified for the World Cup finals in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] (reaching the quarter-finals), [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and the European Championship in [[UEFA Euro 1988|1988]], [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]]. Across Ireland, there is significant interest in the [[Premier League|English]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Scottish Premier League|Scottish]] soccer leagues.

Ireland fields a single [[Ireland national rugby union team|national rugby team]] and a single association, the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]], governs the sport across the island. The Irish rugby team have played in every [[Rugby World Cup]], making the quarter-finals in six of them. Ireland also hosted games during the [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] and the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]]s (including a quarter-final). There are four professional Irish teams; all four play in the [[Pro14]] and at least three compete for the [[Heineken Cup]]. Irish rugby has become increasingly competitive at both the international and provincial levels since the sport went professional in 1994.

In addition to this, the Irish International side has had increased success in the [[Six Nations Championship]] against the other European elite sides. This success, including [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crowns]] in 2004, 2006 and 2007, culminated with a clean sweep of victories, known as a [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]], in 2009 and 2018.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/17274833 |title=Six Nations roll of honour |work=BBC News Online |date=2014 |access-date=28 May 2014}}</ref>

Irish athletics has seen a heightened success rate since the year 2000, with [[Sonia O'Sullivan]] winning two medals at 5,000 metres on the track; gold at the 1995 [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] and silver at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]]. [[Gillian O'Sullivan]] won silver in the 20k walk at the 2003 World Championships, while sprint hurdler [[Derval O'Rourke]] won gold at the 2006 World Indoor Championship in [[Moscow]]. Olive Loughnane won a silver medal in the 20k walk in the World Athletics Championships in Berlin in 2009.

Ireland has won more medals in boxing than in any other Olympic sport. Boxing is governed by the [[Irish Athletic Boxing Association]].

====Recreation====
The west coast of Ireland, [[Lahinch]] and [[Donegal Bay]] in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, [[Bundoran]] has hosted European championship surfing. [[Scuba diving]] is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks along the coast of Ireland, with some of the best [[wreck dives]] being in [[Malin Head]] and off the [[County Cork]] coast.<ref>{{cite news |last=McDaid |first=Brendan |url= http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/shipwrecks-ahoy-in-area-28256564.html |title=Shipwrecks ahoy in area |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=9 June 2004 |access-date=27 March 2010}}</ref>

With thousands of lakes, over {{convert|14000|km|mi|-2}} of fish-bearing rivers and over {{convert|3700|km|mi|-1}} of coastline, Ireland is a popular [[angling]] destination. The temperate Irish climate is suited to sport angling. While [[salmon]] and [[trout]] fishing remain popular with anglers, salmon fishing in particular received a boost in 2006 with the closing of the salmon [[driftnet]] fishery. [[Coarse fishing]] continues to increase its profile. Sea angling is developed with many beaches mapped and signposted,<ref>{{cite web |title=Fishing in Ireland |publisher=Central and Regional Fisheries Boards |url= http://www.fishinginireland.info |access-date=26 March 2010}}</ref> and the range of sea angling species is around 80.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sea Fishing in Ireland |publisher=Central and Regional Fisheries Boards |url= http://www.fishinginireland.info/sea |access-date=26 March 2010}}</ref>

===Food and drink===
{{main|Irish cuisine}}
[[File:Cheese 61 bg 080106.jpg|thumb|[[Gubbeen cheese]], an example of the resurgence in Irish cheese making]]
Food and cuisine in Ireland takes its influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing.<ref name="food_companion" >{{cite book |first1=Alan |last1=Davidson |first2=Tom |last2=Jaine |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2006 |pages=407–408 |isbn=978-0-19-280681-9}}</ref> Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.<ref name="food_companion" />

For this reason, pork and [[white meat]] were more common than beef, and thick fatty strips of salted [[bacon]] (known as rashers) and the eating of salted butter (i.e. a dairy product rather than beef itself) have been a central feature of the diet in Ireland since the Middle Ages.<ref name="food_companion" /> The practice of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter (not unlike the practice of the [[Maasai people|Maasai]]) was common<ref>{{cite journal |title=The History and Social Influence of the Potato |first1=Redcliffe Nathan |last1=Salaman |first2=William Glynn |last2=Burton |first3=John Gregory |last3=Hawkes |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1985 |pages=218–219}}</ref> and [[black pudding]], made from blood, grain (usually barley) and seasoning, remains a breakfast staple in Ireland. All of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the "[[breakfast roll]]".

The introduction of the [[potato]] in the second half of the 16th century heavily influenced cuisine thereafter. Great poverty encouraged a subsistence approach to food, and by the mid-19th century the vast majority of the population sufficed with a diet of potatoes and milk.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Garrow |first=John |title=Feast and Famine: a History of Food and Nutrition in Ireland 1500–1920 |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=160–161 |date=March 2002 |issn=1758-1095 |pmc=1279494 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.3.160}}</ref> A typical family, consisting of a man, a woman and four children, would eat {{convert|18|st|kg}} of potatoes per week.<ref name="food_companion" /> Consequently, dishes that are considered as national dishes represent a fundamental simplicity to cooking, such as the [[Irish stew]], [[bacon and cabbage]], [[boxty]], a type of potato pancake, or [[colcannon]], a dish of [[mashed potatoes]] and [[kale]] or [[cabbage]].<ref name="food_companion" />

Since the last quarter of the 20th century, with a re-emergence of wealth in Ireland, a "New Irish Cuisine" based on traditional ingredients incorporating international influences<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ireland for Dummies |first=Elizabeth |last=Albertson |publisher=Wiley Publishing |location=Hoboken |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-470-10572-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/irelandfordummie0000albe_o4j8/page/34 34] |url=https://archive.org/details/irelandfordummie0000albe_o4j8/page/34 }}</ref> has emerged.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ireland |first=Fionn |last=Davenport |publisher=Lonely Planet |location=London |date=2008 |isbn=978-1-74104-696-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/ireland8th00dave/page/65 65] |url=https://archive.org/details/ireland8th00dave/page/65 }}</ref> This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish (especially salmon, trout, [[oyster]]s, [[mussel]]s and other shellfish), as well as traditional soda breads and the wide range of hand-made [[List of Irish cheeses|cheeses]] that are now being produced across the country. An example of this new cuisine is "Dublin Lawyer": lobster cooked in whiskey and cream.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dublin |first1=Fionn |last1=Davenport |last2=Smith |first2=Jonathan |publisher=Lonely Planet |location=London |date=2006 |isbn=978-1-74104-710-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetdub000fion/page/15 15] |url=https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetdub000fion/page/15 }}</ref> The potato remains however a fundamental feature of this cuisine and the Irish remain the highest per capita<ref name="food_companion" /> consumers of potatoes in Europe. Traditional regional foods can be found throughout the country, for example [[coddle]] in Dublin or [[drisheen]] in Cork, both a type of sausage, or [[blaa]], a doughy white bread particular to [[Waterford]].

Ireland once dominated the world's market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world's whiskey at the start of the 20th century.

[[Irish whiskey]], as researched in 2009 by the [[CNBC]] American broadcaster, remains popular domestically and has grown in international sales steadily over a few decades.<ref name="not_luck">{{Cite news |title=Irish Whiskey's Growth Not Just About Luck| date=19 March 2009 |first=Christina |last=Berk |url= https://www.cnbc.com/id/29636538 |publisher=CNBC |access-date=4 April 2010}}</ref> Typically CNBC states Irish whiskey is not as smoky as a [[Scotch whisky]], but not as sweet as [[American whiskey|American]] or [[Canadian whiskey|Canadian]] whiskies.<ref name="not_luck"/> Whiskey forms the basis of traditional [[Irish Cream|cream liqueurs]], such as [[Baileys Irish Cream|Baileys]], and the "[[Irish coffee]]" (a [[cocktail]] of coffee and whiskey reputedly invented at [[Foynes|Foynes flying-boat station]]) is probably the best-known Irish cocktail.

[[Porter (beer)|Stout]], a kind of [[porter beer]], particularly [[Guinness]], is typically associated with Ireland, although historically it was more closely associated with [[London]]. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to [[lager]].
