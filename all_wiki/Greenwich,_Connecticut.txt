Greenwich is a principal community of the [[Greater Bridgeport|Bridgeport–Stamford–Norwalk–Danbury metropolitan statistical area]], which comprises all of Fairfield County.

Greenwich is the southernmost and westernmost municipality in Connecticut as well as in the six-state region of [[New England]]. The town is named after [[Greenwich]], a [[List of place names with royal patronage in the United Kingdom|royal borough]] of [[London]] in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web | title =Greenwich History | publisher =The US Gen Web Project | url =http://www.ctgenweb.org/county/cofairfield/pages/greenwich/greenwich_hstry.htm| access-date =8 March 2013 }}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Greenwich, Connecticut}}
The town of Greenwich was settled in 1640.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Connecticut Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoEyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA332|year=1903|publisher=Connecticut Magazine Company|page=332}}</ref> One of the founders was [[Elizabeth Fones Winthrop]], daughter-in-law of [[John Winthrop]], founder and governor of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. What is now called Greenwich Point was known for much of the area's early history as "Elizabeth's Neck" in recognition of Elizabeth Fones and their 1640 purchase of the Point and much of the area now known as [[Old Greenwich]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.friendsofgreenwichpoint.org/page2.php |title=Greenwich Point History |publisher=friendsofgreenwichpoint.org |date=1944-12-13 |access-date=2012-11-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117040932/http://www.friendsofgreenwichpoint.org/page2.php |archive-date=2012-11-17 }}</ref> Greenwich was declared a township by the [[Connecticut General Assembly]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] on May 11, 1665.<ref name="ctgenweb.org">[http://www.ctgenweb.org/county/cofairfield/pages/greenwich/greenwich_hstry.htm] Greenwich history page at Connecticut GenWeb site.</ref>

During the [[American Revolution]], General [[Israel Putnam]] made a daring escape from the British on February 26, 1779 in Greenwich. Although British forces pillaged the town, Putnam was able to warn [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]].<ref name="ctgenweb.org"/>

In 1974, [[Gulliver's nightclub fire|Gulliver's Restaurant and Bar]], on the border of Greenwich and [[Port Chester, New York|Port Chester]], burned, killing 24 young people.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/01/nyregion/25-years-later-disco-fire-haunts-its-survivors.html</ref>

In 1983, the [[Mianus River Bridge]], which carries traffic on [[Interstate 95]] over an estuary, collapsed, resulting in the death of three people.<ref>{{cite news|title= I-95 Bridge Collapse Sends Cars Into River |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/28/nyregion/i-95-bridge-collapse-sends-cars-into-river.html |quote= At least two tractor-trailer trucks and two passenger cars went into the Mianus River early this morning when a Connecticut Turnpike bridge over it collapsed, the Connecticut state police said. |newspaper=New York Times |date=June 29, 1983 |access-date=2010-03-10}}</ref>

For many years, Greenwich Point (locally termed "Tod's Point"), was open only to town residents and their guests. However, a lawyer sued, saying his rights to [[freedom of assembly]] were threatened because he was not allowed to go there. The lower courts disagreed, but the [[Connecticut Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Connecticut]] agreed, and Greenwich was forced to amend its beach access policy to all four beaches in 2001. These beaches include Greenwich Point Park, Island Beach, Great Captain Island, and Byram Park.<ref name="Commission on Official Legal Publications, Judicial Branch, State of Connecticut.">[http://www.jud.ct.gov/external/supapp/Cases/AROcr/257cr116.pdf] Leydon v. Greenwich, 257 Conn. 318, 777 A.2d 552 (2001).</ref>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]] in 2000, the town had a total area of {{convert|67.2|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|47.8|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|19.4|sqmi}}, or 28.88%, is water. In terms of area, Greenwich is twice the size of [[Manhattan]]. The town is bordered to the West by Port Chester, New York, Rye Brook, New York, and White Plains, New York. To the North it is bordered by Armonk, New York, and Banksville, New York. To the South it is bordered by the Long Island Sound. To the East it is bordered by Stamford, Connecticut.

===Neighborhoods and sections===
The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes seven [[Census-designated place|CDPs]] within the town: [[Byram, Connecticut|Byram]], [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]], [[Glenville, Connecticut|Glenville]], [[Old Greenwich, Connecticut|Old Greenwich]], [[Pemberwick, Connecticut|Pemberwick]], [[Riverside, Connecticut|Riverside]], and the [[Greenwich (CDP), Connecticut|Greenwich CDP]] covering the historic municipal center of the town. The [[United States Postal Service|USPS]] lists separate zip codes for Greenwich, Cos Cob, Old Greenwich, and Riverside. Additionally, Greenwich is often further divided into several smaller, unofficial neighborhoods.

The [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latin American]] population is concentrated in the southwestern corner of the town.<ref name=NYT72013 /><ref name=NYT71913 /> In 2011, numerous neighborhoods were voted by the ''[[Business Insider]]'' as being the richest neighborhoods in America.<ref name="BinsiderRichest">{{cite news | last =Johnson | first =Robert | title =The 25 Richest Neighborhoods In America | newspaper =The Business Insider| date =2 June 2011| url =http://www.businessinsider.com/richest-neighborhoods-in-america-2011-5?op=1| access-date =8 March 2013 }}</ref>

===Islands===
[[Calf Island (Connecticut)|Calf Island]] is a {{convert|29|acre|m2|adj=on}} island about {{convert|3000|ft|m}} from the [[Byram, Connecticut|Byram]] shore in Greenwich.<ref name=dinan>"Upgrades make Calf Island more attractive to visitors", by Michael Dinan, "Greenwich Time", and "The Advocate" of Stamford, August 15, 2006, page 4, "The Advocate"</ref>

More than half of the island (on the west side) is a bird sanctuary off-limits to members of the public without permission to visit. As of 2006 the island is available for overnight stays for those with permits, otherwise the east side is open from dawn till dusk.<ref name=dinan/>

[[Great Captain Island]] is also off the coast of Greenwich, and is the southernmost point in Connecticut. There is a [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] lighthouse on this island, as well as a designated area as a bird sanctuary. The lighthouse is a [[skeletal tower]].

Island Beach or "Little Captain Island" once was the venue for the town's annual Island Beach Day. Ventriloquist [[Paul Winchell]] and his dummy, Jerry Mahoney, once came for a show, and on another occasion the [[Connecticut Military Department|Connecticut National Guard]] let adults and children fire machine guns into the water, according to an article in the ''Greenwich Time''.<ref name=island>"Crew member passes on stories about island", by Michael Dinan, an article in the ''Greenwich Time'' August 7, 2006.  When the public first began visiting this island, a casino existed here.</ref>

Island Beach has changed over the decades. The bathhouse once on the island's eastern shore is gone, and erosion is slowly eating away at the beaches themselves.<ref name=island/>

===Climate===
Greenwich experiences a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa''); however, it is quite close to a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''). During winter storms, it is common for the area north of the [[Merritt Parkway]] to receive significantly heavier snowfall than the area closer to the coast, due to the moderating influence of [[Long Island Sound]].

The town of Greenwich is one political and taxing body, but consists of several distinct sections or neighborhoods, such as [[Banksville, Connecticut|Banksville]], [[Byram, Connecticut|Byram]], [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]], [[Glenville, Connecticut|Glenville]], [[Mianus (neighborhood)|Mianus]], [[Old Greenwich, Connecticut|Old Greenwich]], [[Riverside, Connecticut|Riverside]] and [[Greenwich (CDP), Connecticut|Greenwich]] (sometimes referred to as central, or downtown, Greenwich). Of these neighborhoods, three (Cos Cob, Old Greenwich, and Riverside) have separate postal names and [[ZIP codes]].<ref name="LOWV">{{cite web|title=A Guide To Greenwich Government |publisher=League of Women Voters Greenwich |url=http://www.lwvg.org/guidetogreenwichgovernment.pdff |access-date=8 March 2013 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

The town has three [[Board of selectmen|selectmen]] and a [[Town meeting|Representative Town Meeting]] (RTM). The RTM must approve all budgets, and consists of 230 elected representatives. RTM members are not paid.  The three selectmen are elected on a town-wide basis, although each person can only vote for two members. This assures that there will almost always be one [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] and two [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] or two Democrats and one Republican. While voter registration is skewed in the Republicans' favor, they do not have a lock on the First Selectman's chair, and Democrats have held the seat recently. Many of the other town committees have equal representation between Democrats and Republicans, regardless of the vote breakdown, since each individual can only vote for half as many seats as are available.<ref name="LOWV"/>

[[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate 95]] goes through the southern end of town, and there are four exits from I-95 in Greenwich, exits 2 through 5. The [[Boston Post Road]] (also known as East or West Putnam Avenue or simply [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|Route 1]]) also goes through town, as does the [[Merritt Parkway]], although the Merritt Parkway is a considerable distance from the downtown area. [[Interstate 684]] passes through Greenwich, but cannot be entered or exited there, and the nearest interchange is at the Westchester County Airport in [[New York State]].

[[Westchester County Airport]] is the closest commercial airport to Greenwich. It takes approximately 15 minutes to drive from the town's center. This is followed by [[LaGuardia Airport]] in Queens, New York, a 35-minute drive approximately. [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[Queens|Queens, New York]], is the closest international airport, a one-hour drive approximately. [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] in New Jersey is also easily accessible from Greenwich, taking approximately one hour to drive to.

According to the DataHaven Community Wellbeing Survey, a statewide program funded by various agencies and philanthropies, 4% of adults in Greenwich are "transportation insecure," meaning that they have had to stay at home during the past year due to a lack of adequate transportation. The comparable rate for all adults statewide is 13%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Greenwich Town Profile|url=http://ctdatahaven.org/profiles/greenwich|website=DataHaven|publisher=DataHaven|access-date=8 December 2015}}</ref>
