'''Murupara''' is a town located in the [[Whakatane District]] and [[Bay of Plenty Region]] of New Zealand's [[North Island]]. The town is situated in an isolated part of the region between the [[Kaingaroa Forest]] and [[Te Urewera National Park]], on the banks of the [[Rangitaiki River]], 65 kilometres southeast of [[Rotorua]].

It is located on [[New Zealand State Highway 38|SH38]] and is the terminus of the [[Murupara Branch|Murupara Railway Branch]]. The town's principal industries are all related to [[forestry]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.jasons.co.nz/murupara|title=Murupara Travel Guide |publisher=[[Jasons Travel Media]]}}</ref>

Murupara is in the ''[[rohe]]'' (tribal area) of the [[Ngāti Manawa]] iwi.<ref name="tkmentry" />

The [[Māori language]] name {{lang|mi|Murupara}} means "to wipe off mud".<ref>{{cite book|title=Discover New Zealand:A Wises Guide|edition=9th|year=1994|page=116}}</ref>

==History and culture==

===History===

Murupara was previously a staging post on the road between Rotorua and [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]]. In the early 1900s, the planting of exotic trees began on the surrounding scrubland. This area is now known as the Kaingaroa Forest, with 1,400 square kilometres of planted pines. As the main service centre for the many forestry workers and their families, Murupara grew to a population of over 3,000. Recent changes to the forestry contracting system have brought about a decrease in the number of permanent residents.

The settlements of [[Galatea, New Zealand|Galatea]], Horomanga, Kopuriki, Aniwhenua, [[Waiohau]] and Murupara lie between the boundary of the Kaingaroa Forest, the popular [[Te Urewera]] and [[Whirinaki Te Pua-a-Tāne Conservation Park]]. Earlier history is also evident around Murupara. In a rock shelter approximately eight kilometres west of the town centre are a number of ancient cave drawings.

Murupara was regarded as being a "gang town" but local iwi have placed a {{lang|mi|[[rāhui]]}} (ban) on gang patches from being worn at the local [[marae]] and school.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rotoruadailypost.co.nz/news/big-push-for-ban-on-gang-patches/1012135/ |title=Big push for ban on gang patches|work=The Daily Post|author=Katee Shanks and Greg Taipari|date=20 November 2009}}</ref><ref name="davison">{{cite news |last1=Davison |first1=Isaac |title=School backs ban on gang regalia |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10847517 |agency=[[New Zealand Herald]] |publisher=[[APN New Zealand]] |date=15 November 2012}}</ref>
