==History==

The Playskool Institute was established by Lucille King in 1928 as a division of the John Schroeder Lumber Company in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].<ref>http://www.hasbro.com/playskool/en_US/about.cfm</ref> King, an employee at the company, developed wooden toys to use as teaching aids for children in the classroom.  In 1935, the Playskool Institute became a division of Thorncraft, Inc., and established offices in Chicago, Illinois.  In 1938, Playskool was purchased by the Joseph Lumber Company, where Manuel Fink was placed in charge of operations.  In 1940, Fink, along with Robert Meythaler, bought Playskool and established the Playskool Manufacturing Company.<ref name="Playskool History">{{cite web
