==Plot==
An animated folk tale narrated by Kofi Novia introduces the origins of Guava Island and the music played by Deni Maroon, a local celebrity who lives with Kofi. She wakes up to Deni playing a tune on his guitar. He rushes out of their house and is greeted by many passersby on the street on his way to work; Deni is holding a music festival that the whole town is looking forward to. He is mugged by a group of kids he knows and he convinces them not to rob him by promising them seats up front at the festival.

Kofi works in a factory as a seamstress with Yara while Deni works for Red Cargo, owned by a despotic business magnate named Red who employs most of the people on the island. While at work, an employee details what he would do if he were able to emigrate to [[United States|America]], which Deni dismisses as ignorant ("[[This Is America (song)|This Is America]]"). Deni is kidnapped and taken to Red's office. Red bribes Deni into canceling his festival so that it will not interrupt productivity the next day. When Deni questions his power, Red destroys his guitar.

He returns to Kofi, who asks him about his injury and his guitar's absence. Deni brushes off her inquiry, instead serenading her with the song he had promised to write since they were children ("[[Summertime Magic]]"). Deni suddenly has to go. Later at work, Kofi tells Yara that she is reluctant to tell Deni that she is pregnant because of his free-spirited lifestyle.

Inspired by two children, Zoila and Mapi ("Time"), Deni performs on the radio again and announces that he will be at the festival ("[[Feels Like Summer (Childish Gambino song)|Feels Like Summer]]"). Kofi is ambushed by Red while both look for Deni; Red asks Kofi to tell him to [[break a leg]]. Deni starts the festival late and performs a song dedicated to Zoila and Mapi ("Saturday"). Kofi spots a masked gunman just before he opens fire on the stage. Deni escapes into an alleyway, but the gunman finds and assassinates him.<!--Note:The film's intertitle described him as assassin, stop changing the dictation.-->

Red is pleased, but then he discovers that all of his employees have left work to attend a joyous blue-themed memorial for Deni ("Die with You"); Kofi tells Red that they all finally "got their day". In an epilogue, Kofi starts telling her child a story about how dreams come true.

Peter Debruge of ''Variety magazine'' writes "the film serves as a shorter, tighter ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'', a self-mythologizing origin story from the artist formerly known as Childish Gambino, reintroduced here as Deni Maroon." Debruge expresses disappointment that film features less music than expected and that Rihanna does not sing. He praises the film as it "Plugs squarely into the zeitgeist, answering conflict with a call for love."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/guava-island-review-childish-gambino-donald-glover-1203188924/|title=Film Review: Childish Gambino’s ‘Guava Island’|first1=Peter|last1=Debruge|date=April 13, 2019|accessdate=November 16, 2019}}</ref>

In [[Rolling Stone]], ''Guava Island'' screenwriter Stephen Glover, Donald's brother, notes a relationship of the plot and themes to the life and recent death of American rapper [[Nipsey Hussle]]. He also discusses the "idea of capitalism in America and how it’s left people out over the years. But at the same time, it has the power to empower you if you can wield it. The idea of capitalism and the relation that black people especially have to capitalism is something that’s interesting to us."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-47925954|title=Guava Island: Fans respond to Donald Glover and Rihanna's new film|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/donald-glover-collaborators-wrote-made-guava-island-822135/|title=How Donald Glover and His Team of Collaborators Wrote, Then Made, 'Guava Island'|work=Rolling Stone|quote=This conception of America, as a broken, cruel system that breaks as often as it makes, is something the Royalty crew is increasingly interested in exploring. Stephen articulates why that theme has become the guiding force for the group’s recent work. "I think it’s something that we as a crew, Royalty, talk about a lot. I think a lot of people, like Nipsey Hussle, it’s this idea of capitalism in America and how it’s left people out over the years. But at the same time, it has the power to empower you if you can wield it. The idea of capitalism and the relation that black people especially have to capitalism is something that’s interesting to us."}}</ref>
