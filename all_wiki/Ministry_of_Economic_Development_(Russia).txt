==History==
[[Andrei Nechayev]] was the first minister in 1992.  He was fired in 1993.  [[Andrei Shapovalyants]] replaced him.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/post-is-filled/218974.html|title = Post is Filled|last = Winestock|first = Geoff|date = March 30, 1993|work = The Moscow Times|accessdate = August 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name="OrttungLussier2000">{{cite book|last1=Orttung|first1=Robert W.|last2=Lussier|first2=Danielle N.|last3=Paretskaya|first3=Anna|title=The Republics and Regions of the Russian Federation: A Guide to Politics, Policies, and Leaders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VroABgoe4-EC&pg=PA545|date=1 January 2000|publisher=M.E.
