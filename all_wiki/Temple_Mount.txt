==Terminology==
The concept of the "Temple Mount" gained prominence in the first century CE, after the destruction of the Second Temple.{{sfn|Eliav|2008|p=64|ps=: "Surprisingly, it was only in the aftermath of the Second Temple’s destruction, when Jerusalem lost its own role as a political and religious center, that the Temple Mount gained prominence."}} Although the term "Temple Mount" was first used in the [[Book of Micah]] (4:1) – literally as "Mount of the House" – it was not used again until approximately one thousand years later.{{sfn|Eliav|2008|p=50-51|ps=: "The pair of words ‘‘Temple Mount’’ also debuted in the works of the prophets. The ‘‘copyright’’ for this name is reserved to the prophet Micah, who incorporated it into his famous admonitory prophecy: ‘‘Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest’’ (Micah 3:12). It is quite doubtful, however, that the book of Micah preserved a concrete name that was actually used in the day-to-day lexicon of the prophet’s generation. A close-reading of this passage shows that the phrase ‘‘Mountain of the House’’ is a literary variation of a longer term, the ‘‘mountain of the House of the Lord’’ (three words in Hebrew), which appears in verse 4:1. The author places the complete term in the middle and ‘‘plays’’ with its constituent parts (both pieces come out to two words in Hebrew) in the previous and subsequent verses (3:12; 4:2). In verse 4:1 the name Lord is deleted, leaving the term ‘‘Mount of the House,’’ or Temple Mount. This, then, is not a case of terms taken from the vocabulary of daily life but rather variations characteristic of the common literary diction used by the prophets. Furthermore, nearly one thousand years will pass from the alleged time of Micah until the specific term ‘‘Temple Mount’’ reappears in the Mishnah. In the interim, the term ‘‘Temple Mount’’ is not used in even one of the numerous existing sources, except in works quoting and using the entire phrase from Micah. This is conclusive evidence that the name ‘‘Temple Mount’’ was not used in earlier periods, even though the image of a mountain as a place for a temple was both known and probably, at least to some degree, widespread."}}{{sfn|Eliav|2008|p=54|ps=: "The name ‘‘Temple Mount’’ appears but once throughout the multitude of available sources (in 1 Maccabees, which will be discussed below). Even there, it operates only as a literary construction, inspired by the biblical verse in Micah. This is a decisive finding, which proves that the term ‘‘Temple Mount’’ was not an integral part of the Second Temple period’s lexicon."}} The term was not used in the [[New Testament]].{{sfn|Eliav|2008|p=56|ps=: "Various passages of the New Testament use the images of the Temple and Jerusalem, whether to express the ‘‘Heavenly Jerusalem’’ or, on occasion, as a label for the actual community. And what of the Temple Mount? The word combination ‘‘Temple’’ and ‘‘Mount’’ is never to be found throughout the entire corpus of the New Testament."}} The term was used next in the [[Middot (Talmud)|Talmud's Tractate Middot]] (1:1–3, 2:1–2), in which the area was described in detail.{{sfn|Eliav|2008|p=59|ps=: "Tractate Middot (1:1–3, 2:1–2) of the Mishnah, one of the earliest texts of this literature, represents the Mount as a recognized territorial constituent within the Temple complex. Its location is clear, its dimensions are defined (‘‘The Temple Mount was five hundred cubits by five hundred cubits’’), and the names of its gates are known (‘‘The Temple Mount had five gates’’)."}} The term was used frequently in Talmudic texts thereafter.{{sfn|Eliav|2008|p=59b}}

==Religious significance==
{{see also|Religious significance of Jerusalem}}
The Temple Mount has historical and religious significance for all three of the major [[Abrahamic religions]]: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. It has particular religious significance for Judaism and Islam, and the competing claims of these faith communities has made it one of the most contested religious sites in the world.
[[File:Temple mount south wall2.jpg|thumb|Wall of the Temple Mount (southeast corner)]]
===Judaism===
{{see also|Temple in Jerusalem}}
The Temple Mount is the holiest site in [[Judaism]], which regards it as the place where [[God in Judaism|God's]] [[Shekhinah|divine presence]] is manifested more than in any other place, and is the place Jews turn towards during prayer. Due to its extreme sanctity, many Jews will not walk on the Mount itself, to avoid unintentionally entering the area where the [[Holy of Holies]] stood, since according to Rabbinical law, some aspect of the divine presence is still present at the site.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> It was from the Holy of Holies that the High Priest communicated directly with God.

According to the rabbinic sages whose debates produced the [[Talmud]], it was from here the world expanded into its present form and where God gathered the dust used to create the first human, [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]].<ref name="Delaney"/> [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] {{bibleverse-nb|2|chronicles|3:1|HE}} refers to the Temple Mount in the time before the construction of the temple as '''Mount Moriah''' ({{lang-he|הַר הַמֹּורִיָּה}}, ''har ham-Môriyyāh''). The "[[Moriah|land of Moriah]]" ({{lang-he|אֶרֶץ הַמֹּרִיָּה}}, ''ʾereṣ ham-Môriyyāh'') is the name given by [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to the location of Abraham's [[binding of Isaac]].<ref name="Delaney">Carol Delaney, ''Abraham on Trial: The Social Legacy of Biblical Myth,'' Princeton University Press 2000 p.120.</ref> Since at least the first century CE, the two sites have been identified with one another in Judaism, this identification being subsequently perpetuated by [[Jewish legend|Jewish]] and [[Christian legend|Christian tradition]]. Modern scholarship tends to regard them as distinct (see [[Moriah]]).

[[File:The rock of the Dome of the Rock Corrected.jpg|thumb|150px|Presumed to be The Foundation Stone, or a large part of it]]
Jewish connection and veneration to the site arguably stems from the fact that it contains the [[Foundation Stone]] which, according to the rabbis of the Talmud, was the spot from where the world was created and expanded into its current form.<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]] [[Yoma]] 54b</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torah.org/features/israelmatters/eye.html#|title=Jerusalem: Eye of the Universe - Torah.org|work=torah.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616185037/http://torah.org/features/israelmatters/eye.html|archive-date=2010-06-16}}</ref> It was subsequently the Holy of Holies of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], the [[Most Holy Place]] in Judaism.<ref name=MeyerMessner/> Jewish tradition names it as the location for a number of important events which occurred in the Bible, including the Binding of Isaac, [[Jacob]]'s dream, and the prayer of Isaac and [[Rebekah]].<ref>[[Toledot]] 25:21</ref> Similarly, when the Bible recounts that King [[David]] purchased a threshing floor owned by [[Araunah]] the [[Jebusite]],<ref>[[2 Samuel]] 24:18–25</ref> tradition locates it as being on this mount. An early Jewish text, the [[Genesis Rabba]], states that this site is one of three about which the nations of the world cannot taunt Israel and say "you have stolen them," since it was purchased "for its full price" by David.<ref>[[Genesis Rabba]] 79.7: "And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent...for a hundred pieces of money." Rav Yudan son of Shimon said: 'This is one of the three places where the non-Jews cannot deceive the Jewish People by saying that they stole it from them, and these are the places: Ma'arat HaMachpela, the Temple and Joseph's burial place. Ma'arat HaMachpela because it is written: 'And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver,' ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], 23:16); the Temple because it is written: 'So David gave to Ornan for the place,' ([[I Chronicles]], 21:26); and Joseph's burial place because it is written: 'And he bought the parcel of ground...Jacob bought Shechem.' (Genesis, 33:19)." See also: [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Kook, Abraham Issac]], ''Moadei Hare'iya'', pp. 413–415.</ref> According to the Bible, David wanted to construct a sanctuary there, but this was left to his son [[Solomon]], who completed the task in c. 950 BCE with the construction of the [[First Temple]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.easyenglish.info/english-learners-bible/1-kings-taw.htm|title=1 Kings - EasyEnglish Bible|work=easyenglish.info}}</ref>

According to Jewish tradition, both Jewish [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temples]] stood at the Temple Mount, though archaeological evidence only exists for the Second Temple.<ref name="BBC - Science & Nature - Horizon">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/solomon_qa.shtml|title=BBC - Science & Nature - Horizon|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> However, the identification of Solomon's Temple with the area of the Temple Mount is widespread. According to the Bible the site should function as the center of all national life—a governmental, judicial and religious center.<ref>Deuteronomy 12:5-26; 14:23-25; 15:20; 16:2-16; 17:8-10; 26: 2; 31: 11; Isaiah 2: 2-5; Obadiah 1:21; Psalms 48</ref> During the [[Second Temple period]] it functioned also as an economic center. According to Jewish tradition and scripture,<ref name="bibleref|2 Chron.|3:1-2|HE"/> the First Temple was built by King Solomon the son of King David in 957 BCE and destroyed by the [[Babylonians]] in 586 BCE. The [[Second Temple|second]] was constructed under the auspices of [[Zerubbabel]] in 516 BCE and destroyed by the [[Roman Empire]] in 70 CE. In the 2nd century, the site was used for a temple to [[Jupiter Capitolinus]].

The Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 and the Dome of the Rock was given to the [[Augustinians]], who turned it into a church, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque became the royal palace of [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] in 1104. The [[Knights Templar]], who believed the Dome of the Rock was the site of the [[Temple of Solomon|Solomon's Temple]], gave it the name "[[Templum Domini]]" and set up their headquarters in the Al-Aqsa Mosque adjacent to the Dome for much of the 12th century.{{citation needed|date= April 2015}}

In Christian art, the [[circumcision of Jesus]] was conventionally depicted as taking place at the Temple, even though European artists until recently had no way of knowing what the Temple looked like and the Gospels do not state that the event took place at the Temple.<ref>Schiller, Gertud.

Though some Christians believe that the Temple will be reconstructed before, or concurrent with, the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus (also see [[dispensationalism]]), pilgrimage to the Temple Mount is not viewed as important in the beliefs and worship of most Christians. The New Testament recounts a story of a Samaritan woman asking Jesus about the appropriate place to worship, Jerusalem or the Samaritan holy place at [[Mount Gerizim]], to which Jesus replies,

<blockquote>Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth. ({{bibleverse||John|4:21-24|ESV}})</blockquote>

This has been construed to mean that Jesus dispensed with physical location for worship, which was a matter rather of spirit and truth.<ref>Andreas J.

A 13th-century claim to an extended region of holiness was made by [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] who asserted: "Al-Masjid al-Aqsa is the name for the whole of the place of worship built by [[Solomon in Islam|Sulaymaan]]" [which, according to western tradition, presents] "the place of worship built by [[Solomon]]" known as [[Solomon's Temple]]. Ibn Taymiyyah had also opposed giving any undue religious honors to mosques (even that of Jerusalem), to approach or rival in any way the perceived Islamic sanctity of the two most holy [[mosque]]s within Islam, [[Masjid al-Haram]] (in Mecca) and [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] (in [[Madina]]).<ref name="ziyaarah">"A Muslim Iconoclast (Ibn Taymiyyeh) on the 'Merits' of Jerusalem and Palestine", by Charles D. Matthews, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', volume 56 (1935), pp. 1–21. [Includes Arabic text of manuscript of Ibn Taymiyya's short work ''Qa'ida fi Ziyarat Bayt-il-Maqdis'' قاعدة في زيارة بيت المقدس]</ref>

Muslims view the site as being one of the earliest and most noteworthy places of worship of [[Islamic concept of God|God]]. For a few years in the early stages of Islam, Muhammad instructed his followers to face the Mount during prayer.

The site is also important as being the site of the "Farthest Mosque" (mentioned in the [[Quran]] as the location of Muhammad's miraculous [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]]) to heaven.:

{{quote|Exalted is He who took His Servant by night from al-Masjid al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque) to al-Masjid al-Aqsa (the Further Mosque), whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him of Our signs. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Seeing.|[[Al-Isra|Quran 17:1]]<ref>[http://www.qurandislam.com/coran/trans/?currSura=17&currAya=1&currTrans=tafsir_en_sahih The Night Journey], Qurandislam</ref>}}

The [[hadith]], a collection of the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, confirm that the location of the Al-Aqsa mosque is indeed in Jerusalem:

{{quote|When the people of Quraish did not believe me (i.e. the story of my Night Journey), I stood up in Al-Hijr and Allah displayed Jerusalem in front of me, and I began describing Jerusalem to them while I was looking at it.|[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]: Volume 5, Book 58, Number 226.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://haditsbukharionline.blogspot.ca/2010/11/merits-of-helpers-in-madinah-ansaar.html|title=Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar) - Hadith Sahih Bukhari|work=haditsbukharionline.blogspot.ca}}</ref>}}

Muslim interpretations of the Quran agree that the Mount is the site of a Temple built by [[Islamic view of Solomon|Sulayman]], considered a prophet in Islam, that was later destroyed.<ref>"The Farthest Mosque must refer to the site of the [[Solomon's Temple]] in Jerusalem on the hill of [[Moriah]], at or near which stands the [[Dome of the Rock]]... it was a sacred place to both Jews and Christians... The chief dates in connection with the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] are: It was finished by [[Solomon]] about 1004 BCE; destroyed by the [[Babylonians]] under [[Nebuchadnezzar]] about 586 BCE; rebuilt under [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]] about 515 BCE; turned into a heathen idol temple by one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s successors, [[Antiochus Epiphanes]], 167 BCE; restored by [[Herod the Great|Herod]], 17 BCE to 29; and completely razed to the ground by the Emperor [[Titus]] in 70. These ups and downs are among the greater signs in religious history." ([[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]], ''Commentary on the Koran'', 2168.)</ref>

After the construction, Muslims believe, the temple was used for the worship of one God by many prophets of Islam, including Jesus.<ref>"The city of Jerusalem was chosen at the command of Allah by Prophet David in the tenth century BCE. After him his son Prophet Solomon built a mosque in Jerusalem according to the revelation that he received from Allah. For several centuries this mosque was used for the worship of Allah by many Prophets and Messengers of Allah. It was destroyed by the Babylonians in the year 586 BCE., but it was soon rebuilt and was rededicated to the worship of Allah in 516 BCE. It continued afterwards for several centuries until the time of Prophet Jesus. After he departed this world, it was destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 CE." (Siddiqi, Dr. Muzammil.

== History ==
{{Main|Archaeological remnants of the Jerusalem Temple}}

=== Israelite period ===
The hill is believed to have been inhabited since the [[4th millennium BCE]]. Assuming colocation with the biblical [[Mount Zion]], its southern section would have been walled at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE, in around 1850 BCE, by [[Canaanites]] who established a settlement there (or in the vicinity) named [[Jerusalem|Jebus]]. Jewish tradition identifies it with Mount Moriah where the [[binding of Isaac]] took place. According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Temple Mount was originally a [[threshing-floor]] owned by [[Araunah]], a [[Jebusite]]. The prophet [[Gad (Bible prophet)|Gad]] suggested the area to King David as a fitting place for the erection of an altar to [[YHWH]], since a destroying angel was standing there when God stopped a great plague in Jerusalem.<ref>II Sam. xxiv. 16 et seq.; I Chron. xxi. 15 et seq.</ref>

David then bought the property from Araunah, for fifty pieces of silver, and erected the altar. YHWH instructed David to build a sanctuary on the site, outside the city walls on the northern edge of the hill. The building was to replace the [[Tabernacle]], and serve as the [[Holy Temple|Temple]] of the Israelites in Jerusalem.<ref name=eastons>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897)|Easton's Bible Dictionary]] |title=Moriah |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/easton/ebd2.html?term=Moriah |access-date=July 14, 2008 }}</ref> The Temple Mount is an important part of [[Biblical archaeology]].

Much of the Mount's early history is synonymous with events pertaining to the Temple itself. After the destruction of Solomon's Temple by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], construction of the [[Second Temple]] began under [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] in around 538 BCE, and was completed in 516 BCE. Evidence of a Hasmonean expansion of the Temple Mount has been recovered by archaeologist [[Leen Ritmeyer]]. Around 19 BCE, [[Herod the Great]] further expanded the Mount and [[Herod's Temple|rebuilt the temple]]. The ambitious project, which involved the employment of 10,000 workers,<ref name=Gonen2003p69>[[#refGonen2003|Gonen (2003)]], p. 69</ref> more than doubled the size of the Temple Mount to approximately {{convert|36|acre|m2}}. Herod leveled the area by cutting away rock on the northwest side and raising the sloping ground to the south. He achieved this by constructing huge buttress walls and vaults, and filling the necessary sections with earth and rubble.<ref name=Negev2005p265>[[#ref Negev2005|Negev (2005)]], p. 265</ref> A [[basilica]], called by [[Josephus]] "the [[Royal Stoa (Jerusalem)|Royal Stoa]]", was constructed on the southern end of the expanded platform, which provided a focus for the city's commercial and legal transactions, and which was provided with separate access to the city below via the [[Robinson's Arch]] overpass.<ref>[[#Mazar1975|Mazar (1975)]], pp. 124-126, 132</ref> In addition to restoration of the Temple, its courtyards and porticoes, Herod also built the [[Antonia Fortress]], abutting the northwestern corner of the Temple Mount, and a rainwater reservoir, [[Birket Israel]], in the northeast. As a result of the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], the fortress was destroyed in 70 CE by [[Titus]], the army commander and son of Roman emperor [[Vespasian]].

=== Middle Roman period ===
[[File:NinthAvStonesWesternWall.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Stone piles (along the western wall, near the southern end) from the walls of the Temple Mount]]
The city of [[Aelia Capitolina]] was built in 130 CE by the Roman emperor [[Hadrian]], and occupied by a [[Roman colony]] on the site of Jerusalem, which was still in ruins from the [[First Jewish Revolt]] in 70 CE. ''Aelia'' came from Hadrian's ''[[Roman naming convention|nomen gentile]]'', ''[[Aelia (gens)|Aelius]]'', while ''Capitolina'' meant that the new city was dedicated to [[Jupiter Capitolinus]], to whom [[Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre#History|a temple was built]] overlapping the site of the former second Jewish temple, the Temple Mount.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Aelia Capitolina|volume=1|page=256}}</ref>

Hadrian had intended the construction of the new city as a gift to the Jews, but since he had constructed a giant statue of himself in front of the Temple of Jupiter and the Temple of Jupiter had a huge statue of Jupiter inside of it, there were on the Temple Mount now two enormous [[Idolatry|graven images]], which Jews considered idolatrous. It was also customary in [[Ancient Roman religion|Roman rites]] to sacrifice a [[pig]] in land purification ceremonies.<ref>Brian J. Incigneri,[https://books.google.com/books?id=aDQCYZs0oOQC&pg=PA192 ''The Gospel to the Romans:the setting and rhetoric of Mark's gospel,''] BRILL 2003 p.192.</ref> In addition to this, Hadrian issued a decree prohibiting the practice of [[circumcision]]. These three factors, the graven images, the sacrifice of pigs before the altar, and the prohibition of circumcision, are thought to have constituted for non-Hellenized Jews a new [[abomination of desolation]], and thus [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar Kochba]] launched the [[Third Jewish Revolt]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} After the Third Jewish Revolt failed, all Jews were forbidden on pain of death from entering the city or the surrounding territory around the city.<ref name="Lester2010">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=i89-9fdNUcAC&pg=PA20|title= An Introduction to Second Temple Judaism: History and Religion of the Jews in the Time of Nehemiah, the Maccabees, Hillel, and Jesus|author= [[Lester L.

Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] promoted the Christianization of Roman society, giving it precedence over pagan cults.<ref>[[Timothy Barnes|Timothy D.

The [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Bordeaux Pilgrim]], who visited Jerusalem in 333–334, during the reign of Emperor Constantine I, wrote that "There are two statues of Hadrian, and, not far from them, a pierced stone to which the Jews come every year and anoint.

{{See also|Jewish revolt against Heraclius|Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628}}

In 610, the [[Sassanid Empire]] drove the [[Byzantine Empire]] out of the Middle East, giving the Jews control of Jerusalem for the first time in centuries. The Jews in Palestine were allowed to set up a vassal state under the Sassanid Empire called the ''Sassanid Jewish Commonwealth'' which lasted for five years. Jewish rabbis ordered the restart of animal sacrifice for the first time since the time of Second Temple and started to reconstruct the Jewish Temple. Shortly before the Byzantines took the area back five years later in 615, the [[Sassanid Empire|Persians]] gave control to the Christian population, who tore down the partially built Jewish Temple edifice and turned it into a garbage dump,<ref>{{cite book|title=Jerusalem Today: What Future for the Peace Process?|first=Ghada|last=Karmi|year=1997|publisher=Garnet & Ithaca Press|isbn=0-86372-226-1|page=116}}</ref> which is what it was when the [[Rashidun]] [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] took the city in 637.

In 691 an octagonal Islamic building topped by a dome was built by the Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] around the rock, for a myriad of political, dynastic and religious reasons, built on local and Quranic traditions articulating the site's holiness, a process in which textual and architectural narratives reinforced one another.<ref>The Dome of the Rock as Palimpsest, Necipoglu, Muqarnas 2008</ref> The shrine became known as the [[Dome of the Rock]] ({{lang|ar|قبة الصخرة}}, ''[[Qubbat]] as-Sakhra'').

The term "Noble Sanctuary" or "Haram al-Sharif", as it was called later by the [[Mamluks]] and [[Ottomans]], refers to the whole area that surrounds that Rock.<ref>Oleg Grabar, [http://www.riifs.org/journal/essy_v2no2_grbar.htm ''The Haram ak-Sharif: An essay in interpretation'', BRIIFS vol. 2 no 2 (Autumn 2000)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004035552/http://www.riifs.org/journal/essy_v2no2_grbar.htm |date=2012-10-04 }}</ref><ref name=MeyerMessner>"Entering the Temple Mount - in Halacha and Jewish History"ת Gedalia Meyer and Henoch Messner, PDF available at [http://hakirah.org/], Vol 10, Summer 2010, Hakirah.</ref>

For Muslims, the importance of the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque makes Jerusalem the [[Holiest sites in Islam (Sunni)|third-holiest city]], after Mecca and [[Medina]]. The mosque and shrine are currently administered by a [[Waqf]] (an Islamic trust). The various inscriptions on the Dome walls and the artistic decorations imply a symbolic eschatological significance of the structure.

=== Crusader and Ayyubid period ===

The Crusader period began in 1099 with the [[First Crusade]]'s capture of Jerusalem. After the city's conquest, the Crusading order known as the [[Knights Templar]] was granted use of the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount. This was probably by [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] and [[Warmund, Patriarch of Jerusalem]] at the [[Council of Nablus]] in January 1120, which gave the Templars a headquarters in the captured [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Selwood|first=Dominic|title=Birth of the Order|url=http://www.dominicselwood.com/birth-of-the-order/|access-date=20 April 2013}}</ref> The Temple Mount had a mystique because it was above what were believed to be the ruins of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]].<ref name=HC>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]], ''Decoding the Past: The Templar Code'', 7 November 2005, video documentary written by Marcy Marzuni.</ref><ref>Barber, ''The New Knighthood'', p. 7.</ref> The Crusaders therefore referred to the Al Aqsa Mosque as Solomon's Temple, and it was from this location that the new Order took the name of "Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon", or "Templar" knights.

In 1187, once he retook Jerusalem, Saladin removed all traces of Christian worship from the Temple Mount, returning the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque to their original purposes. It remained in Muslim hands thereafter, even during the relatively short periods of Crusader rule following the [[Sixth Crusade]].

=== Mamluk period ===
There are several Mamluk buildings on and around the Haram esplanade, such as the late 15th-century [[Madrasa Al-Ashrafiyya|al-Ashrafiyya Madrasa]] and [[Fountain of Qayt Bay|Sabil (fountain) of Qaitbay]]. The Mamluks also raised the level of Jerusalem's Central or Tyropoean Valey bordering the Temple Mount from the west by constructing huge substructures, on which they then built on a large scale. The Mamluk-period substructures and over-ground buildings are thus covering much of the Herodian western wall of the Temple Mount.

=== Ottoman period ===

Following the Ottoman conquest of Palestine in 1516, the Ottoman authorities continued the policy of prohibiting non-Muslims from setting foot on the Temple Mount until the early 19th century, when non-Muslims were again permitted to visit the site.<ref name=MeyerMessner/>

In 1867, a team from the [[Royal Engineers]], led by Lieutenant [[Charles Warren]] and financed by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] (P.E.F.), discovered a series of tunnels near the Temple Mount. Warren secretly{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} excavated some tunnels near the Temple Mount walls and was the first one to document their lower courses. Warren also conducted some small scale excavations inside the Temple Mount, by removing rubble that blocked passages leading from the Double Gate chamber.

=== British Mandatory period ===

=== Israeli period ===
On 7 June 1967, during the [[Six-Day War]], Israeli forces advanced beyond the [[1949 Armistice Agreement Line]] into [[West Bank]] territories, taking control of the [[Old City of Jerusalem]], inclusive of the Temple Mount.

The Chief Rabbi of the Israeli Defense Forces, [[Shlomo Goren]], led the soldiers in religious celebrations on the Temple Mount and at the Western Wall. The Israeli Chief Rabbinate also declared a religious holiday on the anniversary, called "[[Yom Yerushalayim]]" (Jerusalem Day), which became a national holiday to commemorate the [[reunification of Jerusalem]]. Many saw the capture of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount as a miraculous liberation of biblical-messianic proportions.<ref>David S. New,[https://books.google.com/books?id=bso4Rco54isC&pg=PA140 ''Holy War: The Rise of Militant Christian, Jewish and Islamic Fundamentalism,''] McFarland, 2001 pp.140ff.</ref> A few days after the war over 200,000 Jews flocked to the Western Wall in the first mass Jewish pilgrimage near the Mount since the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. Islamic authorities did not disturb Goren when he went to pray on the Mount until, on the [[Tisha B'Av|Ninth Day of Av]], he brought 50 followers and introduced both a [[shofar]], and a portable ark to pray, an innovation which alarmed the Waqf authorities and led to a deterioration of relations between the Muslim authorities and the Israeli government.<ref name="Gonen" /> The then [[List of Prime Ministers of Israel|Prime Minister of Israel]], [[Levi Eshkol]], gave control of access to the Temple Mount to the [[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf]]. The site has since been a flash-point between Israel and local Muslims.

In June 1969 an Australian tried to set fire to Al-Aqsa; on April 11, 1982 a Jew hid in the Dome of the Rock and sprayed gunfire, killing 2 Palestinians and wounding 44; in 1974, 1977 and 1983 groups led by [[Yoel Lerner]] conspired to blow up both the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa; on 26 January 1984 Waqf guards detected members of B'nei Yehuda, a messianic cult of former gangsters turned mystics based in [[Lifta]], trying to infiltrate the area to blow it up.<ref name="Klein" /><ref>Urî Huppert, ''Back to the ghetto: Zionism in retreat,'' Prometheus Books 1988 p.108.</ref><ref>Ofira Seliktar, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-j2sCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT267 ''New Zionism and the Foreign Policy System of Israel,''] Routledge 2015 p.267</ref> On October 8, 1990, Israeli forces patrolling the site blocked worshippers from reaching it. A tear gas canister was set off among the female worshippers, which caused events to escalate. On 12 October 1990 Palestinian Muslims protested violently the intention of some extremist Jews to lay a cornerstone on the site for a New Temple as a prelude to the destruction of the Muslim mosques. The attempt was blocked by Israeli authorities but demonstrators were widely reported as having stoned Jews at the Western Wall.<ref name="Klein">Menachem Klein, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nBnPuy2GxuQC&pg=PA54 ''Jerusalem: The Contested City,''] C.

== Status quo ==
Since 1757 a [[Status quo (Holy Land sites)|status quo has been applied for the ruling of the Holy places in Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&q=sultan+jerusalem+1757+%22status+quo%22&pg=PA209|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|first1=Michael|last1=Dumper|first2=Bruce E.|last2=Stanley|date=1 January 2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576079195|via=Google Books}}</ref>

The situation between Jews and Muslims was confirmed in 1919 and [[Faisal–Weizmann Agreement]] concluded that:

<blockquote>Article V. No regulation nor law shall be made prohibiting or interfering with the free exercise of religion; (...)<br/>Article VI. The Mohammedan Holy Places shall be under Mohammedan control.<ref>[[Enrico Molinaro]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hQaDrfuGw1YC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=%22status+quo%22+religions+jerusalem&source=bl&ots=CGtvz3ff2o&sig=8yrS_Mx4XgCUmQjmQNtN1YMYG4g&hl=fr&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22status%20quo%22%20british%20mandate&f=false The Holy Places of Jerusalem in Middle East Peace Agreements: The Conflict Between Global and State Identities]'', [[Sussex Academic Press]], 2009, p.55.</ref></blockquote>

Following the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the status quo was not respected any more after Jordan took control of the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] and Jews were prohibited from visiting their Holy Places in the city.<ref>{{cite book|title=The real and ideal Jerusalem in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic art|publisher=Center for Jewish Art, Hebrew University of Jerusalem|year=1988|page=247|last=Narkiss|first=Bezalel|isbn=965-391-007-8}}</ref>

=== Under Israeli control ===
A few days after the [[Six-Day War]], on June 17, 1967, a meeting was held at al-Aqsa between Moshe Dayan and Muslim religious authorities of Jerusalem reformulating the ''status quo''.<ref name=Gonen /> Jews were given the right to visit the Temple Mount unobstructed and free of charge if they respected Muslims' religious feelings and acted decently, but they were not allowed to pray. The Western Wall was to remain the Jewish place of prayer. 'Religious sovereignty' was to remain with the Muslims while 'overall sovereignty' became Israeli.<ref name=Gonen>{{cite book|last1=Gonen|first1=Rivka|title=Contested Holiness: Jewish, Muslim, and Christian Perspectives on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem|date=2003|publisher=KTAV |location=Jersey City (N.

Some Jews, led by [[Shlomo Goren]], then the military chief rabbi, had objected as well, claiming the decision handed over the complex to the Muslims, since the Western Wall's holiness is derived from the Mount and symbolizes exile, while praying on the Mount symbolizes freedom and the return of the Jewish people to their homeland.<ref name=Gonen /> The President of the High Court of Justice, [[Aharon Barak]], in response to an appeal in 1976 against police interference with an individual's putative right to prayer on the site, expressed the view that, while Jews had a right to prayer there, it was not absolute but subject to the public interest and the rights of other groups. Israel's courts have considered the issue as one beyond their remit, and, given the delicacy of the matter, under political jurisdiction.<ref name=Gonen/> He wrote:

<blockquote>The basic principle is that every Jew has the right to enter the Temple Mount, to pray there, and to have communion with his maker. This is part of the religious freedom of worship, it is part of the freedom of expression. However, as with every human right, it is not absolute, but a relative right... Indeed, in a case where there is near certainty that injury may be caused to the public interest if a person's rights of religious worship and freedom of expression would be realized, it is possible to limit the rights of the person in order to uphold the public interest.<ref name=Gonen/></blockquote>

Police continued to forbid Jews to pray on the Temple Mount.<ref name=Gonen/> Subsequently, several prime ministers also made attempts to change the status quo, but failed to do so. In October 1986, an agreement between the [[Temple Mount Faithful]], the Supreme Muslim Council and police, which would allow short visits in small groups, was exercised once and never repeated, after 2,000 Muslims armed with stones and bottles attacked the group and stoned worshipers at the Western Wall. During the 1990s, additional attempts were made for Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount, which were stopped by Israeli police.<ref name=Gonen/>

Until 2000, non-Muslim visitors could enter the Dome of the Rock, al-Aqsa Mosque and the Islamic Museum by getting a ticket from the Waqf. That procedure ended when the [[Second Intifada]] erupted. Fifteen years later, negotiation between Israel and Jordan might result in reopening of those sites once again.<ref>{{cite news|title=Report: Israel, Jordan in Talks to Readmit non-Muslim Visitors to Temple Mount Sites|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.663644|newspaper=Haaretz|date=June 30, 2015}}</ref>

In the 2010s, fear arose among Palestinians that Israel planned to change the status quo and permit Jewish prayers or that the al-Aqsa mosque might be damaged or destroyed by Israel. Al-Aqsa was used as a base for attacks on visitors and the police from which stones, firebombs and fireworks were thrown. The Israeli police had never entered al-Aqsa Mosque until November 5, 2014, when dialog with the leaders of the Waqf and the rioters failed. This resulted in imposing strict limitations on entry of visitors to the Temple Mount. Israeli leadership repeatedly stated that the status quo would not change.<ref name=Shragai>{{cite web|author1=[[Nadav Shragai]]|title=The "Status Quo" on the Temple Mount|url=http://jcpa.org/article/status-quo-on-temple-mount/|publisher=JCPA|date=November 13, 2014}}</ref> According to then Jerusalem police commissioner Yohanan Danino, the place is at the center of a "holy war" and "anyone who wants to change the status quo on the Temple Mount should not be allowed up there", citing an "extreme right-wing agenda to change the status quo on the Temple Mount"; Hamas and Islamic Jihad continue to erroneously assert that the Israeli government plans to destroy Al-Aksa Mosque, resulting in chronic terrorist attacks and rioting.<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Its-a-mistake-to-allow-right-wing-MKs-on-Temple-Mount-Police-Chief-Danino-says-382799 It's a mistake to allow right-wing MKs on Temple Mount, Police Chief Danino says]'', [[Jerusalem Post]], 25 November 2014.</ref>

There have been several changes to the status quo: (1) Jewish visits are often prevented or considerably restricted. (2) Jews and other non-Islamic visitors can only visit from Sunday to Thursday, for four hours each day. (3) Visits inside the mosques are not allowed. (4) Jews with religious appearance must visit in groups monitored by Waqf guards and policemen.<ref name=Shragai/>

Many Palestinians believe the status quo is threatened since right-wing Israelis have been challenging it with more force and frequency, asserting a religious right to pray there. Until Israel banned them, members of [[Murabitat]], a group of women, cried 'Allah Akbar' at groups of Jewish visitors to remind them the Temple Mount was still in Muslim hands.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Staton|first1=Bethan|title=The women of al-Aqsa: the compound's self-appointed guardians|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/women-al-aqsa-meet-murabitats-2039073489|website=Middle East Eye}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Israel Bans Two Muslim Activist Groups From Temple Mount|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.675329|newspaper=Haaretz|date=September 9, 2015}}</ref>

An Islamic [[Waqf]] has managed the Temple Mount continuously since the Muslim reconquest of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in 1187. On June 7, 1967, soon after Israel had taken control of the area during the [[Six-Day War]], Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]] assured that "no harm whatsoever shall come to the places sacred to all religions".

== Jewish attitudes towards entering the site ==

Due to religious restrictions on entering the most sacred areas of the Temple Mount (see following section), the [[Western Wall]], a retaining wall for the Temple Mount and remnant of the [[Second Temple]] structure, is considered by some rabbinical authorities to be the holiest accessible site for Jews to pray at. A 2013 [[Knesset]] committee hearing considered allowing Jews to pray at the site, amidst heated debate. [[Arab-Israeli]] MPs were ejected for disrupting the hearing, after shouting at the chairman, calling her a "pyromaniac". Religious Affairs Minister [[Eli Ben-Dahan]] of [[Jewish Home]] said his ministry was seeking legal ways to enable Jews to pray at the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/11/israel-mps-mull-jewish-prayer-at-al-aqsa-site-201311413318362256.html|title=Israel MPs mull Jewish prayer at al-Aqsa site|work=aljazeera.com}}</ref>

=== Jewish religious law concerning entry to the site ===
{{Main|Temple Warning inscription}}

During Temple times, entry to the Mount was limited by a complex set of [[Tumah|purity laws]]. Persons suffering from [[corpse uncleanness]] were not allowed to enter the inner court.<ref>[[Mishnah]], ''[[Keilim|Kelim]]'' [https://archive.org/details/DanbyMishnah/page/n635/mode/1up 1:8] (in [[Herbert Danby|Danby]]'s edition of the Mishnah, p. 606)</ref> Non-Jews were also prohibited from entering the inner court of the Temple.<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[De Bello Judaico]]'' (The Jewish War) [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0148%3Abook%3D5%3Awhiston+chapter%3D5%3Awhiston+section%3D2 5.5.2]</ref> A hewn stone measuring 60 x 90&nbsp;cm. and engraved with Greek uncials was discovered in 1871 near a court on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem in which it outlined this prohibition:

Translation: "Let no foreigner enter within the parapet and the partition which surrounds the Temple precincts. Anyone caught [violating] will be held accountable for his ensuing death." Today, the stone is preserved in [[Museum of Antiquities, Istanbul|Istanbul's Museum of Antiquities]].

[[Maimonides]] wrote that it was only permitted to enter the site to fulfill a religious precept. After the destruction of the Temple there was discussion as to whether the site, bereft of the Temple, still maintained its holiness or not. Jewish codifiers accepted the opinion of Maimonides who ruled that the holiness of the Temple sanctified the site for eternity and consequently the restrictions on entry to the site are still currently in force.<ref name=MeyerMessner/> While secular Jews ascend freely, the question of whether ascending is permitted is a matter of some debate among religious authorities, with a majority holding that it is permitted to ascend to the Temple Mount, but not to step on the site of the inner courtyards of the ancient Temple.<ref name=MeyerMessner/> The question then becomes whether the site can be ascertained accurately.<ref name=MeyerMessner/> A second complex legal debate centers around the precise divine punishment for stepping onto these forbidden spots.

There is debate over whether reports that [[Maimonides]] himself ascended the Mount are reliable.<ref>''Sefer HaCharedim Mitzvat Tshuva'', Chapter 3; Shu"t Minchas Yitzchok, vol. 6</ref> One such report{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} claims that he did so on Thursday, October 21, 1165, during the Crusader period. Some early scholars however, claim that entry onto certain areas of the Mount is permitted. It appears that [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|Radbaz]] also entered the Mount and advised others how to do this. He permits entry from all the gates into the 135×135 cubits of the Women's Courtyard in the east, since the biblical prohibition only applies to the 187×135 cubits of the Temple in the west.<ref>''Shaarei Teshuvah'', [[Orach Chaim]] 561:1; cf. ''Teshuvoth Radbaz'' 691</ref> There are also Christian and Islamic sources which indicate that Jews visited the site,<ref>[[Moshe Sharon]]. "Islam on the Temple Mount" ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' July/August 2006. p. 36–47, 68. "Immediately after its construction, five Jewish families from Jerusalem were employed to clean the Dome of the Rock and to prepare wicks for its lamps"</ref> but these visits may have been made under duress.<ref>The ''[[Yaakov Chaim Sofer|Kaf hachaim]]'' ([[Orach Chaim]] 94:1:4 citing [[Radvaz]] Vol. 2; Ch. 648) mentions a case of a Jew who was forced onto the Temple Mount.</ref>

=== Opinions of contemporary rabbis concerning entry to the site ===
A few hours after the Temple Mount came under Israeli control during the Six-Day War, a message from the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbis of Israel]], [[Isser Yehuda Unterman]] and [[Yitzhak Nissim]] was broadcast, warning that Jews were not permitted to enter the site.<ref name=Inbari22>{{cite book | author = Motti Inbari | title = Jewish Fundamentalism and the Temple Mount | pages=22–24 | publisher = SUNY Press | year = 2009}}</ref> This warning was reiterated by the Council of the Chief Rabbinate a few days later, which issued an explanation written by Rabbi Bezalel Jolti (Zolti) that "Since the sanctity of the site has never ended, it is forbidden to enter the Temple Mount until the Temple is built."<ref name=Inbari22/> The signatures of more than 300 prominent rabbis were later obtained.<ref name=CohenTemple>{{cite journal | author = Yoel Cohen | title = The Political Role of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate in the Temple Mount Question | journal = Jewish Political Studies Review | volume = 11 | number = 1–2 | year = 1999 | pages = 101–126}}</ref>

A major critic of the decision of the Chief Rabbinate was Rabbi Shlomo Goren, the chief rabbi of the IDF.<ref name=Inbari22/> According to General [[Uzi Narkiss]], who led the Israeli force that conquered the Temple Mount, Goren proposed to him that the Dome of the Rock be immediately blown up.<ref name=CohenTemple/> After Narkiss refused, Goren unsuccessfully petitioned the government to close off the Mount to Jews and non-Jews alike.<ref name=CohenTemple/> Later he established his office on the Mount and conducted a series of demonstrations on the Mount in support of the right of Jewish men to enter there.<ref name=Inbari22/> His behavior displeased the government, which restricted his public actions, censored his writings, and in August prevented him from attending the annual Oral Law Conference at which the question of access to the Mount was debated.<ref name=Hassner>{{cite book | author = Ron E. Hassner | title = War on Sacred Grounds | url = https://archive.org/details/waronsacredgroun00hass | url-access = registration | publisher = Cornell University Press | year = 2009 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/waronsacredgroun00hass/page/113 113–133]}}</ref> Although there was considerable opposition, the conference consensus was to confirm the ban on entry to Jews.<ref name=Hassner/> The ruling said "We have been warned, since time immemorial [''lit.'' for generations and generations], against entering the entire area of the Temple Mount and have indeed avoided doing so."<ref name=CohenTemple/><ref name=Hassner/> According to Ron Hassner, the ruling "brilliantly" solved the government's problem of avoiding ethnic conflict, since those Jews who most respected rabbinical authority were those most likely to clash with Muslims on the Mount.<ref name=Hassner/>

Rabbinical consensus in the post-1967 period, held that it is forbidden for Jews to enter any part of the Temple Mount,<ref>Rabbis who support this opinion include: [[Mordechai Eliyahu]], former Sefardi Chief Rabbi of Israel; [[Zalman Baruch Melamed]], rosh yeshiva of the [[Beit El yeshiva]]; [[Eliezer Waldenberg]], former rabbinical judge in the Rabbinical Supreme Court of the State of Israel; [[Avraham Yitzchak Kook]], Chief Rabbi of Palestine ([http://www.kadosh.co.il/mkdsh026.html Mikdash-Build (Vol. I, No. 26)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927090658/http://kadosh.co.il/mkdsh026.html |date=2013-09-27 }}); [[Avigdor Nebenzahl]], Rabbi of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of Jerusalem.</ref> and in January 2005 a declaration was signed confirming the 1967 decision.<ref>These rabbis include: Rabbis [[Yona Metzger]] (Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel); [[Shlomo Amar]] (Sefardi Chief Rabbi of Israel); [[Ovadia Yosef]] (spiritual leader of Sefardi Haredi Judaism and of the [[Shas]] party, and former Sefardi Chief Rabbi of Israel); [[Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron]] (former Sefardi Chief Rabbi of Israel); Shmuel Rabinowitz (rabbi of the [[Western Wall]]); [[Avraham Shapiro]] (former Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel); [[Shlomo Aviner]] ([[rosh yeshiva]] of [[Ateret Cohanim]]); [[Yisrael Meir Lau]] (former Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel and current Chief Rabbi of [[Tel Aviv]]).

However, there is a growing body of [[Modern Orthodox]] and [[Religious Zionism|national religious]] rabbis who encourage visits to certain parts of the Mount, which they believe are permitted according to most medieval rabbinical authorities.<ref name=MeyerMessner/> These rabbis include: Shlomo Goren (former Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel); Chaim David Halevi (former Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv and Yafo); [[Dov Lior]] (Rabbi of [[Kiryat Arba]]); [[Yosef Elboim]]; [[Yisrael Ariel]]; [[She'ar Yashuv Cohen]] (Chief Rabbi of [[Haifa]]); [[Yuval Sherlo]] ([[rosh yeshiva]] of the [[hesder]] yeshiva of [[Petah Tikva]]); [[Meir Kahane]]. One of them, Shlomo Goren, held that it is possible that Jews are even allowed to enter the heart of the Dome of the Rock in time of war, according to Jewish Law of Conquest.<ref name="haaretz">{{cite news | author = Nadav Shragai | title = In the Holy of Holies | newspaper = Haaretz | date = May 26, 2006 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/in-the-holy-of-holies-1.188745}}</ref> These authorities demand an attitude of veneration on the part of Jews ascending the Temple Mount, [[Ritual washing in Judaism|ablution]] in a [[mikveh]] prior to the ascent, and the wearing of non-leather shoes.<ref name=MeyerMessner/> Some rabbinic authorities are now of the opinion that it is imperative for Jews to ascend in order to halt the ongoing process of [[Islamization of the Temple Mount]]. Maimonides, perhaps the greatest codifier of Jewish Law, wrote in ''Laws of the Chosen House ch 7 Law 15'' "One may bring a dead body in to the (lower sanctified areas of the) Temple Mount and there is no need to say that the ritually impure (from the dead) may enter there, because the dead body itself can enter". One who is ritually impure through direct or in-direct contact of the dead cannot walk in the higher sanctified areas. For those who are visibly Jewish, they have no choice, [http://www.templeinstitute.org/birds_eye.htm but to follow this peripheral route] as it has become unofficially part of the status quo on the Mount. Many of these recent opinions rely on archaeological evidence.<ref name=MeyerMessner/>

In December 2013, the two Chief Rabbis of Israel, [[David Lau]] and [[Yitzhak Yosef]], reiterated the ban on Jews entering the Temple Mount.<ref name=DLYY>{{cite news | author = Jeremy Sharon | title = Chief Rabbis reimpose ban on Jews visiting Temple Mount | newspaper = Jerusalem Post | date = December 2, 2013 | url = http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Chief-Rabbis-reimpose-ban-on-Jews-visiting-Temple-Mount-333741}}</ref> They wrote, "In light of [those] neglecting [this ruling], we once again warn that nothing has changed and this strict prohibition remains in effect for the entire area [of the Temple Mount]".<ref name=DLYY/> In November 2014, the Sephardic chief rabbi [[Yitzhak Yosef]], reiterated the point of view held by many rabbinic authorities that Jews should not visit the Mount.<ref name="Itamar" >Itamar Sharon, [http://www.timesofisrael.com/jews-must-stop-going-to-temple-mount-sephardic-chief-rabbi-says/ 'Jews must stop Temple Mount visits, Sephardi chief rabbi says'], ''[[The Times of Israel]]'', 7 November 2014.</ref>
On the occasion of an upsurge in Palestinian knifing attacks on Israelis, associated with fears that Israel was changing the status quo on the Mount, the Haredi newspaper Mishpacha ran a notification in Arabic asking 'their cousins', Palestinians, to stop trying to murder members of their congregation, since they were vehemently opposed to ascending the Mount and consider such visits proscribed by Jewish law.<ref>[http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=768542 'Orthodox Jewish newspaper asks Arabs to avoid killing Haredi Jews,'] [[Ma'an News Agency]] 29 October 2015.</ref>

== Current features ==

=== Dome of the Rock platform ===
A flat platform was built around the peak of the Temple Mount, carrying the [[Dome of the Rock]]; the peak just breaches the floor level of the upper platform within the Dome of the Rock, in the shape of a large [[Sakhrah|limestone outcrop]], which is part of the bedrock. Beneath the surface of this rock there is a cave known as the [[Well of Souls]], originally accessible only by a narrow hole in the rock itself; the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] hacked open an entrance to the cave from the south, by which it can now be entered.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

There is also a smaller domed building on the upper platform, slightly to the east of the Dome of the Rock, known as the [[Dome of the Chain]] — traditionally the location where a chain once rose to heaven.

Several stairways rise to the upper platform from the lower; that at the northwest corner is believed by some archaeologists be part of a much wider monumental staircase, mostly hidden or destroyed, and dating from the Second Temple era.

=== Lower platform ===
[[File:TM washing.JPG|240px|right|thumb|The ''al-Kas'' ablution fountain for Muslim worshippers on the southern portion of the lower platform]]
The lower platform – which constitutes most of the surface of the Temple Mount – has at its southern end the al-Aqsa Mosque, which takes up most of the width of the Mount. Gardens take up the eastern and most of the northern side of the platform; the far north of the platform houses an Islamic school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campsci.com/museum/images/43e.jpg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020718222845/http://campsci.com/museum/images/43e.jpg |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-07-18 |title=Photograph of the northern wall area |accessdate=2018-04-05}}</ref>

The lower platform also houses an [[sebil (fountain)|ablution fountain]] (known as ''al-Kas''), originally supplied with water via a long narrow aqueduct leading from the so-called ''[[Solomon's Pools]]'' near [[Bethlehem]], but now supplied from Jerusalem's water mains.

There are several [[cisterns]] beneath the lower platform, designed to collect rain water as a water supply. These have various forms and structures, seemingly built in different periods, ranging from vaulted chambers built in the gap between the bedrock and the platform, to chambers cut into the bedrock itself. Of these, the most notable are (numbering traditionally follows Wilson's scheme<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campsci.com/museum/images/map.gif |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011214121205/http://campsci.com/museum/images/map.gif |url-status=dead |archive-date=2001-12-14 |title=Wilson's map of the features under the Temple Mount |accessdate=2018-04-05}}</ref>):

* Cistern 5 (located under the south eastern corner of the upper platform) — a long and narrow chamber, with a strange anti-clockwise curved section at its north western corner, and containing within it a doorway currently blocked by earth. The cistern's position and design is such that there has been speculation it had a function connected with the altar of the Second Temple (and possibly of the earlier Temple), or with the ''bronze sea''.

* Cistern 9 (located just south of cistern 8, and directly under the al-Aqsa Mosque) — known as the ''Well of the Leaf'' due to its leaf-shaped plan, also rock hewn.
* Cistern 11 (located east of cistern 9) — a set of vaulted rooms forming a plan shaped like the letter E. Probably the largest cistern, it has the potential to house over 700,000 gallons of water.
* Cistern 16/17 (located at the centre of the far northern end of the Temple Mount). Despite the currently narrow entrances, this cistern (17 and 16 are the same cistern) is a large vaulted chamber, which Warren described as looking like the inside of the cathedral at [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] (which was previously a mosque). Warren believed that it was almost certainly built for some other purpose, and was only adapted into a cistern at a later date; he suggested that it might have been part of a general vault supporting the northern side of the platform, in which case substantially more of the chamber exists than is used for a cistern.

=== Gates ===
{{Main|Gates of the Temple Mount}}
[[File:Hulda gates.jpg|thumb|240px|The eastern set of Hulda gates]]
[[File:RobinsonsArchMay2009.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Robinson's Arch]], situated on the southwestern flank, once supported a staircase that led to the Mount.]]
:'''Sealed gates'''
The retaining walls of the platform contain several gateways, all currently blocked. In the eastern wall is [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|the Golden Gate]], through which legend states the [[Jewish Messiah]] would enter Jerusalem. On the southern face are the [[Hulda Gates]] — the ''triple gate'' (which has three arches) and the ''double gate'' (which has two arches, and is partly obscured by a Crusader building); these were the entrance and exit (respectively) to the Temple Mount from [[Ophel]] (the oldest part of Jerusalem), and the main access to the Mount for ordinary Jews. In the western face, near the southern corner, is the Barclay's Gate – only half visible due to a building (the "house of Abu Sa'ud") on the northern side. Also in the western face, hidden by later construction but visible via the recent [[Western Wall Tunnels]], and only rediscovered by Warren, is [[Warren's Gate]]; the function of these western gates is obscure, but many Jews view Warren's Gate as particularly holy, due to its location due west of the Dome of the Rock. Traditional belief considers the Dome of the Rock to have earlier been the location at which the [[Holy of Holies]] was placed; numerous alternative opinions exist, based on study and calculations, such as those of Tuvia Sagiv.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templemount.org/sagiv2/index.html|title=Determination of the location of the Temple based on the angle of sight of Agrippa II|work=templemount.org}}</ref>

Warren was able to investigate the inside of these gates. Warren's Gate and the Golden Gate simply head towards the centre of the Mount, fairly quickly giving access to the surface by steps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campsci.com/museum/images/38g.jpg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020719154856/http://campsci.com/museum/images/38g.jpg |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-07-19 |title=Photograph of the inside of the Golden Gate |accessdate=2018-04-05}}</ref> Barclay's Gate is similar, but abruptly turns south as it does so; the reason for this is currently unknown. The double and triple gates (the ''Huldah Gates'') are more substantial; heading into the Mount for some distance they each finally have steps rising to the surface just north of the al-Aqsa Mosque.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campsci.com/museum/images/45o.jpg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020719013944/http://campsci.com/museum/images/45o.jpg |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-07-19 |title=image of the double gate passage |accessdate=2018-04-05}}</ref> The passageway for each is vaulted, and has two aisles (in the case of the triple gate, a third aisle exists for a brief distance beyond the gate); the eastern aisle of the double gates and western of the triple gates reach the surface, the other aisles terminating some way before the steps – Warren believed that one aisle of each original passage was extended when the al-Aqsa Mosque blocked the original surface exits.

In the process of investigating Cistern 10, Warren discovered tunnels that lay ''under'' the Triple Gate passageway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campsci.com/museum/images/47a.jpg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020719033733/http://campsci.com/museum/images/47a.jpg |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-07-19 |title=Photograph of one of the chambers ''under'' the Triple Gate passageway |accessdate=2018-04-05}}</ref> These passages lead in erratic directions, some leading beyond the southern edge of the Temple Mount (they are at a depth below the base of the walls); their purpose is currently unknown – as is whether they predate the Temple Mount – a situation not helped by the fact that apart from Warren's expedition no one else is known to have visited them.

Altogether, there are six major sealed gates and a postern, listed here counterclockwise, dating from either the Roman/Herodian, Byzantine, or Early Muslim periods:
* Bab al-Jana'iz/al-Buraq (Gate of the Funerals/of al-Buraq); eastern wall; a hardly noticeable [[postern]], or maybe an improvised gate, a short distance south of the Golden Gate

=== Solomon's Stables/Marwani Mosque ===
East of and joined to the triple gate passageway is a large vaulted area, supporting the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount platform – which is substantially above the bedrock at this point – the vaulted chambers here are popularly referred to as [[Solomon's Stables]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campsci.com/museum/images/46e.jpg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020719023533/http://campsci.com/museum/images/46e.jpg |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-07-19 |title=Photograph of King Solomon's Stables |accessdate=2018-04-05}}</ref> They were used as stables by the Crusaders, but were built by Herod the Great – along with the platform they were built to support.

=== Minarets ===
{{Main|Minarets of the Temple Mount}}
The existing four minarets include three near the [[Western Wall]] and one near the northern wall. The first minaret was constructed on the southwest corner of the Temple Mount in 1278. The second was built in 1297 by order of a [[Mameluk]] king, the third by a governor of Jerusalem in 1329, and the last in 1367.

== Alterations to antiquities and damage to existing structures ==
{{Main|Excavations at the Temple Mount}}
{{see also|Temple Denial|Islamization of the Temple Mount}}
Due to the extreme political sensitivity of the site, no real archaeological excavations have ever been conducted on the Temple Mount itself. Protests commonly occur whenever archaeologists conduct projects near the Mount. This sensitivity has not, however, prevented the Muslim [[Waqf]] from destroying archeological evidence on a number of occasions.<ref>See "The Washington Post, Opinion Columns, July 17, 2000 Protect the Temple Mount by Hershel Shanks</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/123525|title=Policeman Assaulted Trying to Stop Illegal Temple Mount Dig|work=Arutz Sheva}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/0003/newsbriefs/flap.html|title=Jerusalem's Temple Mount Flap - Archaeology Magazine Archive|work=archaeology.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/880761.html|title=Waqf Temple Mount excavation raises archaeologists' protests|date=11 July 2007|work=Haaretz.com}}</ref> Aside from visual observation of surface features, most other archaeological knowledge of the site comes from the 19th-century survey carried out by [[Charles William Wilson|Charles Wilson]] and [[Charles Warren]] and others.

Many Israelis regarded this as a radical change of the status quo, which should not have been undertaken without first consulting the Israeli government. The project was done without attention to the possibility of disturbing historically significant archaeological material, with stone and ancient artifacts treated without regard to their preservation.<ref>Temple Mount destruction stirred archaeologist to action, February 8, 2005 | by Michael McCormack, Baptist Press {{cite web|url=http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID%3D20094 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726151231/http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?Id=20094 |archive-date=2014-07-26 }}</ref>

In October 1999, the Islamic Waqf, and the Islamic Movement conducted an illegal{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} dig which inflicted much archaeological damage. The earth from this operation, which has archeological wealth relevant to Jewish, Christian and Muslim history, was removed by heavy machinery and unceremoniously dumped by trucks into the nearby Kidron Valley. Although the archeological finds in the earth are already not [[in situ]], this soil still contains great archeological potential. No archeological excavation was ever conducted on the Temple Mount, and this soil was the only archeological information that has ever been available to anyone. For this reason Israeli archaeologists Dr. [[Gabriel Barkay]] and [[Zachi Zweig]] established a project sifting all the earth in this dump: the [[Temple Mount Sifting Project]].
Among finds uncovered in rubble removed from the Temple Mount were:
* The imprint of a seal thought to have belonged to a priestly Jewish family mentioned in the Old Testament's Book of Jeremiah.
* More than 4300 coins from various periods. Many of them are from the Jewish revolt that preceded the destruction of the Second Temple by Roman legions in 70 CE emblazoned with the words "Freedom of Zion"
* Arrowheads shot by Babylonian archers 2,500 years ago, and others launched by Roman siege machinery 500 years later.
* Unique floor slabs of the '[[opus sectile]]' technique that were used to pave the Temple Mount courts. This is also mentioned in Josephus accounts and the Babylonian Talmud.

In late 2002, a bulge of about 700&nbsp;mm was reported in the southern retaining wall part of the Temple Mount. A Jordanian team of engineers recommended replacing or resetting most of the stones in the affected area.<ref>Esther Hecht, ''[http://www.archaeology.org/0207/newsbriefs/templemount.html Battle of the Bulge]''</ref> In February 2004, the eastern wall of the Mount was damaged by an earthquake.
