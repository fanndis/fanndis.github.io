'''Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend''' (born July 4, 1951) is an American attorney who was the sixth [[Lieutenant Governor of Maryland]] from 1995 to 2003. She ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Maryland in [[Maryland gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]].

In 2010 Townsend became the chair of the non-profit American Bridge, an organization whose focus is to raise funds for Democratic candidates and causes.<ref name="palin barbs">{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2010/12/kennedys_respon.html?rss_id=Top+Stories |title=Kennedys respond to Palin barbs |first=Michael J. |last=Bailey |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=December 4, 2010}}</ref> She is a member of the prominent political [[Kennedy family]].

==Early life, education, and law career==
She was born in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], the eldest of [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Ethel Kennedy|Ethel Skakel]]'s eleven children. She is the eldest grandchild of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]] and [[Rose Kennedy]]. While she was growing up, it was not assumed that the girls in the politically oriented Kennedy family would run for office.<ref name="just like"/> However, after her uncle President [[John F. Kennedy]] was assassinated, her father wrote her saying, "As the oldest of the next generation you have a particular responsibility. ... Be kind to others and work for your country."<ref name="just like"/> Her family gave her the nicknames "Clean Kathleen", "the Nun", and "the Un-Kennedy".<ref name="just like"/>

Over the summer of 1964, Kennedy won four blue ribbons for her "excellence in horsemanship".<ref name=Oppenheimer380-381 />
On August 29, 1965, the fourteen-year-old Kennedy was somersaulted by her horse while competing at Sea Flash Farms in [[West Barnstable, Massachusetts]]. She was left unconscious and bleeding internally and was rushed to [[Cape Cod Hospital]], located fifteen miles away. Her family was en route to [[Hyannis Port]] at the time of the incident and was not located for another three hours.<ref name=Oppenheimer380-381>{{cite book |last=Oppenheimer |first=Jerry |title=The Other Mrs. Kennedy: An Intimate and Revealing Look at the Hidden Life of Ethel Skakel Kennedy |publisher=Macmillan |date=May 15, 1995 |isbn=978-0-3129-5600-4 |pages=380–381 }}</ref>
She was sixteen when her father was assassinated. The night he was shot at the Ambassador Hotel, Kennedy and her two eldest brothers, Joe and Robert, Jr., were being flown to [[Los Angeles]] aboard one of the jets in the Secret Service's presidential fleet named "the ''Jet Star''".<ref>Oppenheimer, p. 453.</ref> She spent most of her childhood in [[McLean, Virginia]], and attended [[Stone Ridge School]] in nearby [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. She graduated from [[The Putney School]] in [[Vermont]]. She attended [[Radcliffe College]], receiving her [[bachelor's degree]] in history and literature in 1974. She then studied at the [[University of New Mexico School of Law]], receiving her [[Juris Doctor]] degree in 1978.

After graduation, she was admitted to and is a member of the Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maryland [[bar exam|bar associations]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Maryland Lt.

The family moved to [[Maryland]], her husband's home state, in 1984.<ref name="just like">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/time/1999/07/26/kennedy.townsend.html |title=Kathleen Kennedy Townsend: Just like her father? |first=Sally B. |last=Donnelly |date=July 26, 1999 |via=CNN All Politics |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref> In 1986, Townsend became the first Kennedy to lose a [[General election#American usage|general election]] when she ran for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in Maryland's strongly Republican second congressional district, using the name Townsend only.<ref name="just like"/> Incumbent Republican [[Helen Delich Bentley]] defeated her 59% to 41%.

She then went to work for the state government of Maryland, holding numerous posts including assistant [[Attorney General of Maryland|Attorney General]].

==Lieutenant Governor of Maryland==
In 1994, [[Parris Glendening]] was running for [[Governor of Maryland|Governor]] in a highly contested primary against then-Lt. Governor [[Melvin A. Steinberg]] when he selected her as his running mate. Experts did not believe she would be an asset, but her name recognition (she now used the name Kennedy Townsend) and her fund-raising skills, helped him to win.<ref name="just like"/>

[[File:Kathleen Kennedy Townsend giving out awards, 2001, cropped.jpg|180px|thumb|Townsend in 2001]]
In the general election, Glendening and Townsend beat Republican candidate [[Ellen Sauerbrey]] in one of Maryland's closest and most controversial gubernatorial elections. After unofficial results indicated that Sauerbrey had lost the election by a narrow margin, she began making what ''The Washington Post'' called "sensational charges" that the election had been stolen.<ref name="for Sauerbrey">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1998/10/12/for-sauerbrey-past-vs-present/fa2f9231-b205-4ad4-985f-6bd06ab06544/ |title=For Sauerbrey, Past vs. Present |first=Donald P. |last=Baker |date=October 12, 1998 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> Sauerbrey's allegations included ballot box stuffing, 100% voting in one precinct, voting by numerous dead people, and what she called the Kennedy "precedent"—that unproven rumors that John Kennedy had stolen the 1960 Presidential election proved that his niece Townsend had stolen this election.<ref name="for Sauerbrey"/>

The official vote tally declared Glendening the winner by 5,993 votes out of 1.4 million.<ref name="for Sauerbrey"/> Sauerbrey hired an election specialist known for aggressive tactics then filed a lawsuit alleging that 50,000 votes had been cast illegally.<ref name="for Sauerbrey"/> By the time the hearing began in January 1995, however, Sauerbrey had backed away from the fraud charges and her claim centered on sloppy election procedures and 3,600 challenged ballots.<ref name="for Sauerbrey"/> The number of challenged ballots would not have been enough to change the result even if all of them were thrown out. The judge ruled that about 1,800 votes had been cast in [[Baltimore]] by people whose names should have been purged from the rolls, but said that there was no clear and convincing evidence that fraud or procedural errors had affected the outcome.<ref name="for Sauerbrey"/> Sauerbrey dropped the suit three days before Glendening was to be inaugurated, but still maintained her belief that she had won the election.<ref name="for Sauerbrey"/>

Sauerbrey ran against Glendening again in 1998, but this time Glendening and Townsend won by a much wider margin (55% to 44%).

During her tenure as lieutenant governor, Townsend focused on reducing crime and promoting economic development.<ref name="just like"/>

==2002 gubernatorial election==
In the [[2002 Maryland gubernatorial election|Maryland gubernatorial election of 2002]], Townsend faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Bob Ehrlich]] and [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] [[Spear Lancaster]] in the general election.

During the campaign, Townsend was criticized for her choice of running mate, [[Admiral]] [[Charles R. Larson]], a novice politician who had switched parties only a few weeks before. Some also criticized the choice of a white male as unlikely to help minority turnout.<ref name="never shook off">{{cite news |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/bal-te.md.defeat06nov06-story.html |title=Townsend never shook off lightweight label: Drumbeat about lack of leadership qualities dogged her to the end |access-date=February 14, 2009 |last=Nitkin |first=David |date=November 6, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]}}</ref> Ehrlich's running mate was [[Michael Steele]], an [[African-American]] lawyer who had been chairman of the Republican Party of Maryland.

Though Maryland traditionally votes Democratic and had not elected a Republican Governor in almost 40 years, Townsend lost the race, gaining 48% of the vote to Ehrlich's 51% and Lancaster's 1%. Ehrlich became only the seventh Republican governor in state history. In the end, most observers agreed she ran a weak campaign. They specifically cited a lack of planning, claiming that she hastily booked campaign stops in rural areas hostile to her and produced campaign literature of poor printing quality. ''The Baltimore Sun'' said the defeat derailed her political career, at least in the short run.<ref name="never shook off"/>

In December 2010, she was appointed chair of American Bridge, a new non-profit that would raise funds for Democratic candidates and causes, and that was intended to be a Democratic counterpart to right-leaning organizations such as [[American Crossroads]] and [[Crossroads GPS]].<ref name="palin barbs"/> She noted that the Democrats did not have such an organization during the 2010 election cycle, and that Republicans outspent the Democrats by $70 million. "I want to compete dollar to a dollar with the Republicans and I want to beat them", she said.<ref name="hopes new">{{cite news |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2010/12/kathleen-kennedy-townsend-american-bridge-david-brock-2012-group.html |title=Kathleen Kennedy Townsend Hopes New Democratic Fundraising Group Will Avert Another 'Disaster' In 2012 |date=December 2, 2010 |first=Michael |last=Falcone |work=The Note |publisher=[[ABC News]]}}</ref>
