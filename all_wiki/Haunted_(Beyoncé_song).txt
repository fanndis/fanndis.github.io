"'''Haunted'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Beyoncé]] from her fifth studio album, ''[[Beyoncé (album)|Beyoncé]]'' (2013). It was written and produced by Beyoncé herself and [[Boots (musician)|Boots]]. Conceived by the latter following an infuriating meeting with a record label, the song was presented to Beyoncé who decided to record it following similar experiences in the [[music industry]]. The song was inspired by the works of English musician [[Aphex Twin]] and contains a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] [[rapping|rap]].

Musically, it consists of two parts titled "'''Ghost'''" and "'''Haunted'''".It contains a minimalistic sound with keyboards, [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and percussion. Beyoncé raps the [[spoken word]] segment of "Ghost" with robotic and [[Reverberation|reverbed]] vocals. Lyrically, "Haunted" contains sexually explicit and frank lyrics talking about desire. Many [[music journalism|music critics]] compared its sound with various artists and noted different influences and elements explored in its composition. Upon its release, the song was met with positive reviews, with critics praising its experimentalistic sound and the minimalistic approach.

Two accompanying music videos were filmed for both parts of the song and placed separately on the visual album. The clip for "Ghost" was directed by Pierre Debusschere while [[Jonas Åkerlund]] served as the director for the second part, "Haunted". The former visual shows various close-up shots of Beyoncé lip-syncing the lyrics, while the latter features her walking in the corridor of a big [[mansion]] meeting various actors seen inside the rooms. Critics compared the video of "Haunted" and the singer's look with works by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], most notably with her song "[[Justify My Love]]" (1990). The song was performed live during the last European leg of [[The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour]] and at the [[On the Run Tour (Beyoncé and Jay-Z)|On the Run Tour]] in 2014. Beyoncé also performed it at the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards]] as part of a medley consisting of songs from her fifth studio album.

So I went home, it was five in the morning, and I just started typing shit out—everything I hear on the radio isn't inspiring; I'm not inspired by anything I'm doing; these people have no idea what's happening. It was just a stream-of-consciousness. I woke up the next day and realized I needed to do something with that.

"Haunted" was written and produced by [[Beyoncé]] and New York-based musician [[Boots (musician)|Boots]], who was relatively unknown before the release of ''[[Beyoncé (album)|Beyoncé]]'' (2013).<ref name="CoS1">{{cite magazine|accessdate=August 25, 2014|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/12/listen-to-haunted-by-beyonce-producer-boots/|title=Listen to "Haunted" by Beyoncé producer Boots|first=Michelle|last=Geslani|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=December 13, 2013}}</ref><ref name="McCormick">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/cdreviews/10516174/BEYONC-track-by-track-review.html|date=December 13, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2014|title=Beyoncé, track by track review|first=Neil|last=McCormick|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> He was signed to [[Roc Nation]], about six months prior to the album's release and produced 85% of ''Beyoncé'' also having writing credits on four of its tracks.<ref name="CoS1" /><ref name="Verge">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/16/5216964/beyonce-review-the-queen-rethinks-the-throne|title='Beyoncé' review: the queen rethinks the throne|accessdate=August 25, 2014|work=[[The Verge]]|date=December 16, 2013|first=Trent|last=Wolbe}}</ref> During an interview with [[Pitchfork Media]], Boots revealed that "Haunted" was the first song written by him which Beyoncé heard; it was originally titled "I'm Onto You" at that time. Beyoncé liked the song upon hearing it, leaving Boots confused as he felt the song was only showcasing his sad vocals, with a piano recorded on his [[iPhone]] as a voice memo.<ref name="boots" />

He also played her the [[rap]] of [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] of "Ghost" during one of their early meetings inspired by an infuriating meeting with a record label. Beyoncé could immediately connect to the topic as she had also experienced the same things in the record industry when people advised her about the sound of her music. For the music of "Ghost", Boots created a beat from a "dreamlike, hypnotic place" working with guitars and building layers inspired by the work of musician [[Aphex Twin]]. Boots said, "[Aphex Twin's] works like that are more floaty, more without than within, but I made mine grounded in that thumping beat, so you can't get out of that feeling."<ref name="boots" /> He also elaborated about its concept, "It's like that song is leading you by the hand, but you're blindfolded and you don't know where you're going. You're scared and you're not sure what to expect from it, but as the album unfolds, we take the blindfold off and you realize it's a surprise party for you."<ref name="boots" />

Beyoncé also explained the meaning of "Haunted" on her [[iTunes Radio]] channel where she also revealed her admiration for Boots, "The song is really about temptation in this music industry and being exposed to this crazy madness."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/beyonce-explains-songs-titled-album/story?id=21262583|title=Beyonce Explains New Self-Titled Album|publisher=[[ABC News]].

"Haunted" was recorded at [[Jungle City Studios]] and [[Oven Studios]], both located in New York City under the guidance of Boots and Stuart White. It was later [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] by Tony Maserati and White at Mirrorball Studios in North Hollywood. The track was eventually [[Audio mastering|mastered]] by [[Tom Coyne (music engineer)|Tom Coyne]] and Aya Merril in [[Sterling Sound]] in New York City. All instruments were provided by Boots, with additional [[drum programming]] by [[Hit-Boy]].<ref name="AV" />

AbsolutePunk writer Ryan Dennehy remarked in his review that "ethereal echoes" of the singer's voice "elevate it above just a post-[[The Weeknd|Weeknd]], dark update to staid topics".<ref name="punk" /> Philip Matusavage of [[musicOMH]] described the sound of "Ghost" as "sleek ambient" [[dubstep]], adding that it sounded typical for the singer and served as a "Beyoncé manifesto".

==="Haunted"===
====Background====
The music video for "Haunted" was directed by Swedish film and music video director [[Jonas Åkerlund]] and styled by Dagmarette Yen and B. Åkerlend.<ref name="vulture" /> It was shot using four cameras and in a period of two days.<ref name="BTS">{{cite AV media|people=Jonas Åkerlund|year=2014|title=Beyoncé – Behind The Scenes: Jonas Åkerlund|medium=[[Vevo]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxlHynVMENM|access-date=December 8, 2014|format=Video|via=YouTube}}</ref> On November 15, 2013, [[Popjustice]] reported that one of the actors who was featured in the video, J-Hustle, shared a picture on his Twitter account while being on a five-day set for the filming. He added that a song with "a slow vibe" was played in the background during the shooting and that its potential name was "Ghost Haunted".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popjustice.com/thenews/beyonces-apparently-filming-video-slow-song-might-called-haunted/121729/|title=Beyoncé's apparently been filming a video for a slow song that might be called 'Haunted'|publisher=[[Popjustice]]|first=Brad|last=O'Mance|date=November 15, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref> Beyoncé first discussed about the video with Åkerlend during a concert she had in Stockholm in 2013. Having invited him for the performance, the singer played several songs for the director afterwards and the pair went on to exchange several ideas about its concept. During an interview with ''[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]'', Åkerlund talked about the process:<ref name="vulture"/>

<blockquote>
"It was not like a solid plan of 'This is what I think we should do.' It was a pretty long process. And she was traveling and touring, so we had time to bounce ideas back and forth, figure out what the best vision was. And meanwhile, she was shooting all these other videos and I wasn't really involved in what those other ideas were."</blockquote>

He noted that several ideas of the video which were initially conceived were similar with "other videos that people were working on" and also explained that the video contained many sexually explicit scenes and ideas when initially shot. However, he felt that the team managed to balance between the singer's look, her performance and a strong idea along with several other things. Åkerlund further noted that its concept remained largely unchanged as none of the big ideas were excluded.<ref name="vulture">{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/12/beyonce-music-video-director-jonas-akerlund-haunted-superpower.html|title=Director Jonas Åkerlund on 'Haunted,' 'Superpower,' and Beyoncé's Many Virtues|publisher=Vulture.

On December 2, 2014, a behind-the-scenes video consisting of footage from the making of the video for "Haunted" and "Superpower" with commentary by Jonas Åkerlund was released online. In the clip, he explained how both videos were slightly different compared to the singer's previous work as they contained less choreography. He went on saying the video for "Haunted" had a "cinematic" and "surreal" tone inspired by its music, further comparing it with a score for a movie. He concluded that the team had "all the elements to create something special"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2014309/beyonce-superpower-haunted-behind-the-scenes/|title=Beyonce's Director Pushed Her 'Out Of Her Comfort Zone' In These Two Videos |publisher=MTV News.

====Synopsis====
[[File:BeyonceHauntedscreenshot.jpeg|thumbnail|A still from the music video for "Haunted" in which Beyonce is seen walking along a corridor in a mansion. The video's set and the singer's style were compared to that of Madonna in her video "Justify My Love" (1990)]]
The video opens with a three-second film [[countdown]] and proceeds with shots of several empty rooms and televisions in a big [[mansion]]. Most of the scenes were shot at the Villa de Leon. Beyoncé is seen driving a car and eventually arriving at the mansion while a song is played in the background. She enters inside the building with two luggages embellished with the letter "B" and throws her coat on the ground while a servant is seen lighting a cigarette she had previously taken from her hair. He hands her a key and the singer is seen climbing up the stairs. As she arrives in the hallway on the second floor, the song starts playing in the background and Beyoncé starts a journey, looking from room to room as she goes forward in the corridor.

In the various rooms, she meets men wearing vest tops with their faces painted white with black eyes staring at her as she passes down the corridor. Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being surrounded by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains a family of four [[mannequin]]s in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal. A bare African-American is seen dancing and painting herself with a large brush while being almost naked. She is also seen with her legs spread around a TV screen and Beyoncé is seen on it, singing the song. During one scene, Beyoncé performs a dance choreography on a couch along with several other female dancers. Throughout the video, she is seen wearing a tuxedo with a tie, a white fur jacket and platform heels designed by Saint Laurent.<ref name="fashionista">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2013/12/19/fashion/BEYONCE-FASHION-ALBUM-7.html|title=Beyoncé's 'Visual Album' Fashions|work=The New York Times|page=7|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref> The black-and-white jumpsuit she wears is designed by Russian designer [[Ulyana Sergeenko]].<ref name="Russian" /> Her look is further complete with dark make-up around the eyes and red lipstick while her hair is [[Marcelling|marcelled]] and blonde.<ref name="Cochrane" />

====Reception====
Anupa Mistry from ''Spin'' wrote that the location where the video was filmed was filled with "freaks and weirdos" to channel Madonna during the 1990s in a better way.<ref name="Mistry" /> Lauren Cochrane of ''The Guardian'' wrote in her review of the video that it was a "homage" to Madonna with the suit and [[marcel wave]] Beyoncé had.

Whitney Phaneuf writing for the website HitFix felt that the video was a fit for the song's [[Industrial music|industrial]] sound and described the singer's look as "goth-glam". She concluded the scenes are quickly cut throughout the video, "never culminating in a linear narrative and forcing the viewer to fill in the blanks".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hitfix.com/galleries/overlay/beyonces-17-new-music-videos-ranked-from-worst-to-best#15|title=Beyonce's 17 new music videos ranked from worst to be – 3.
