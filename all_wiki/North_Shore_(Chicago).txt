[[File:North Shore (Chicago).svg|thumb|Map of northeastern Illinois showing the North Shore and surrounding areas.]]
The '''North Shore''' consists of many affluent suburbs north of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], bordering the shores of [[Lake Michigan]]. These communities fall within suburban [[Cook County]] and [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake County]]. The North Shore's membership is often a topic of debate, and is sometimes expanded to include other nearby Chicago suburbs which do not border Lake Michigan. However, [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Northbrook, Illinois|Northbrook]], [[Glenview, Illinois|Glenview]], [[Northfield, Illinois|Northfield]], [[Glencoe, Illinois|Glencoe]], [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]], [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]], [[Kenilworth, Illinois|Kenilworth]], [[Lake Bluff, Illinois|Lake Bluff]], [[Lake Forest, Illinois|Lake Forest]], [[Wilmette, Illinois|Wilmette]], and [[Winnetka, Illinois|Winnetka]] are generally considered to be the main constituents of the North Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Discover Chicago's North Shore|url=https://northshorechicago.com/community/|access-date=2020-07-10|website=North Shore Chicago|language=en-US}}</ref>

== History ==
Europeans settled the area sparsely after an 1833 treaty with local [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The region began to be developed into towns following the opening of [[Northwestern University]] in Evanston in 1855 and the founding of [[Lake Forest College]] two years later, and the construction and launch of railroads serving the colleges and their towns.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Electric rail lines were also run from Chicago, parallel to steam commuter lines, and streetcars flourished throughout the suburbs from Evanston on north. The North Shore today is noteworthy for being one of the few remaining agglomerations of [[streetcar suburb]]s in the United States.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

This area became popular with the affluent wanting to escape [[urban area|urban]] life, beginning after the [[Great Chicago Fire]], and grew rapidly before and just after [[World War II]] with a growing Jewish population migrating out of various neighborhoods in Chicago. The major Jewish suburban communities include Evanston, Skokie, Glencoe, Northbrook, and Highland Park. Jews, however, were barred from Kenilworth and Lake Forest. The number of Jews in the north suburbs increased to 40% by the early 1960s.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

In the 1960s, most of the northern suburbs were almost entirely white. One informal 1967 poll suggested that of 2,000 real estate listings, only 38 (around 2%) were open to African-Americans.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Few Homes Found Open to Negro Buyer|date = 15 June 1967|journal = Chicago Tribune}}</ref>

===Origin and definition of term===
[[File:CNSM public timetable 19410209.jpg|thumb|North Shore Line 1941 timetable cover]]

The term North Shore began to come into use in the early 1880s, and by 1889, with the creation of the North Shore Improvement Association, the name was officially established.<ref>{{Cite news
  | last = Grossman
  | first = Ron
  | title = North Shore Lore
  | newspaper = The Chicago Tribune
  | date= June 28, 1988
  }}</ref>

In 1890, Joseph Sears used the term several times in a brochure that was written to promote the newly-forming community of Kenilworth.<ref>{{cite book |title= Kenilworth: The Modern Suburban Home|year= 1890|location= Chicago}}</ref> It is believed{{who|date=July 2018}} to have come into widespread use{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} following the establishment in 1891 of the Waukegan & North Shore Rapid Transit Company, which in 1916 following reorganization was renamed the [[Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad]] ("CNS&M"), popularly known as the North Shore Line.  This railway ran along [[Lake Michigan|Lake Michigan's]] western shore between [[Chicago]] and [[Milwaukee]]. The Shore Line route of the CNS&M until 1955 served, from south to north, the Illinois communities of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Wilmette, Illinois|Wilmette]], [[Kenilworth, Illinois|Kenilworth]], [[Winnetka, Illinois|Winnetka]], [[Glencoe, Illinois|Glencoe]], [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]], Highwood, Fort Sheridan, [[Lake Forest, Illinois|Lake Forest]], [[Lake Bluff, Illinois|Lake Bluff]], [[North Chicago, Illinois|North Chicago]], [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]],  Zion, and [[Winthrop Harbor, Illinois|Winthrop Harbor]] as well as Kenosha, Racine, and Milwaukee (the "KRM") in Wisconsin. After 1924, the Skokie Valley line of the CNS&M opened land further west to the North Shore.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Meanwhile, in 1906, the Sanitary District of Chicago platted the "North Shore Channel" of the sanitary canal from the Chicago River, through Evanston and Wilmette to Lake Michigan.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://pages.ripco.net/~jwn/nssc.html | title = North Shore Sanitary Canal | accessdate = 2010-11-19}}</ref>

While the CNS&M ran from Chicago all the way to Milwaukee, the term "North Shore" today typically refers only to the communities between Lake Bluff and Chicago. Michael Ebner's scholarly ''Creating Chicago's North Shore: A Suburban History'', one of the most thorough studies of the area, covers eight suburbs along the lake:  Evanston, Wilmette, Kenilworth, Winnetka, Glencoe, Highland Park, Lake Forest, and Lake Bluff.<ref>{{cite book |title= Creating Chicago's North Shore|last= Ebner |first= Michael H. |year= 1989|publisher=University of Chicago Press |location= Chicago|isbn=0-226-18205-3 |page= xvii }}</ref> In their ''North Shore Chicago: Houses of the Lakefront Suburbs, 1890-1940'', Cohen and Benjamin include not only those eight suburbs but also "the tiny city of [[Highwood, Illinois|Highwood]]" which is slightly inland, just north of Highland Park.<ref>{{cite book |title= North Shore Chicago: Houses of the Lakefront Suburbs, 1890-1940 |last= Cohen|first= Stuart |author2=Susan Benjamin  |year= 2005|publisher=Acanthus Press |location= New York|isbn=0-926494-26-0 |page= 44 }}</ref>

==Socioeconomics and culture==
[[File:Chicago as seen from NU at Evanston.jpg|thumb|Chicago, as seen from the campus of [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]].]]
Today the North Shore remains one of the most affluent and highly educated areas in the United States. Seven of its communities are in the top [[Income quintiles|quintile]] of [[Household income in the United States|U.S. household income]], and five of those ([[Lake Forest, Illinois|Lake Forest]], [[Glencoe, Illinois|Glencoe]], [[Kenilworth, Illinois|Kenilworth]], [[Winnetka, Illinois|Winnetka]], [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]]) are in the top 5 percent.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

The North Shore is also the home of the [[Ravinia Festival]], a historic outdoor music theater in [[Highland Park, Illinois]]. The Ravinia Festival, originally conceived as a weekend destination on the CNS&M line, is now a popular destination on the [[Metra]] [[Union Pacific/North Line|Union Pacific North Line]] commuter rail, the North Shore Line's former competitor. It hosts many concerts through the year that attract over 600,000 people.<ref>[[Ravinia Festival]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=February 2018}} Highwood became home of the annual Pumpkin Festival which saw thousands of people every year flock to the small town for a week of music, food, community, and the lighting of 32,000 Jack o' Lanterns. The town used to hold the world record for most carved and lit Jack o' Lanterns but lost the title to [[Keene, New Hampshire]].{{fact|date=July 2018}}

The abandoned right-of-way of the North Shore Line still serves Ravinia as the [[Green Bay Trail]], a popular [[rails-to-trails]] bicycle path that begins in Wilmette and runs north all the way to the [[Illinois Beach State Park]] in [[Zion, Illinois|Zion]].{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==The Greater North Shore==
Subsequent to the more general use of the term North Shore for the above suburbs, and the term's association with those towns' desirable{{opinion|date=July 2018}} socioeconomic characteristics, it became common for businesses in numerous nearby inland Chicago suburbs in the Maine, New Trier, Niles, Northfield, and Norwood Townships, as well as in southern Lake County, Illinois, to name themselves "North Shore", and for real estate and other marketers to use the term for non-North Shore communities from time to time. The former ''North Shore'' magazine had special advertising editions not only for Evanston, Winnetka, Lake Forest, and Lake Bluff, but also for Glenview, Northbrook, Barrington, Bannockburn, and Riverwoods.<ref>''North Shore magazine''.
