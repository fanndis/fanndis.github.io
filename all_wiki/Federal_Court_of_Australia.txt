The '''Federal Court of Australia''' is an [[Australia]]n superior court of record which has jurisdiction to deal with most civil disputes governed by federal law (with the exception of family law matters), along with some summary (less serious) criminal matters. Cases are heard at first instance by single Judges. The Court includes an appeal division referred to as the '''Full Court''' comprising three Judges, the only avenue of appeal from which lies to the [[High Court of Australia]]. In the [[Australian court hierarchy]], the Federal Court occupies a position equivalent to the Supreme Courts of each of the states and territories. In relation to the other Courts in the federal stream, it is equal to the [[Family Court of Australia]], and superior to the [[Federal Circuit Court of Australia|Federal Circuit Court]]. It was established in 1976 by the Federal Court of Australia Act.

The Chief Justice of the Federal Court is [[James Allsop]].
