"'''Take Care'''" is the title track from Canadian rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]'s [[Take Care (album)|2011 studio album of the same name]]. The song features guest vocals from [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] singer [[Rihanna]]. The song heavily samples [[Jamie xx]]'s [[We're New Here|remix]] of [[Gil Scott-Heron]]'s [[I'm New Here|version]] of "[[I'll Take Care of You (song)|I'll Take Care of You]]", written by [[Brook Benton]]. "Take Care" was released as the fifth single from the album on February 21, 2012. It is a [[Club music|club]] song about a couple in a relationship acknowledging they have been hurt in their past, but will look after one another.

"Take Care" peaked at number seven on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], while also reaching the top ten in Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. It further peaked at numbers two and eight on the US [[Rap Songs]] and [[Pop Songs]] charts respectively, and charted within the top ten of the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The song's accompanying music video, directed by [[Yoann Lemoine]], depicts simplistic art including Drake and Rihanna's characters in an intimate relationship, with other scenes featuring animals such as a [[bull]], [[black-throated magpie-jay]] and [[tropical fish]], and various outdoor landscapes. The video portrays the ups and downs of a relationship with [[poaching]] and [[wildfire]]s. Critics praised the video for its simple and minimalistic theme.

"Take Care" is a [[club music|club]] song that samples [[Jamie xx]]'s 2011 remix of [[Gil Scott-Heron]]'s cover song "[[I'll Take Care of You (song)|I'll Take Care of You]]", originally recorded by [[Bobby Bland]] in 1959.<ref name="Powers">{{cite web|last=Powers|first=Ann|authorlink=Ann Powers|date=November 8, 2011|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2011/11/07/142105010/follow-the-sample-drakes-take-care-comes-from-the-blues|title=Follow The Sample: Drake's 'Take Care' Comes From The Blues|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=January 20, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DoI8IAWF?url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2011/11/07/142105010/follow-the-sample-drakes-take-care-comes-from-the-blues|archivedate=January 20, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The production of Drake's song was helmed by [[Noah "40" Shebib|40]], reworking Jamie xx's remix.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/take-care-r2295025/credits|title=Take Care – Drake|publisher=AllMusic|at=Credits|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref>
Additionally, Drake makes reference to [[Lesley Gore]]'s 1963 number one single, "[[It's My Party (Lesley Gore song)|It's My Party]]" by re-working the lyrics, ''"It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to, can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to."''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/434917/Drake-take-care/Its-my-birthday-ill-get-high-if-i-want-to|title=Drake – Take Care Lyrics|work=Romi Ezzo, Maboo, Phoenix, Haroj, newtonp01, iamfase, SameOldShawn|publisher=Genius|date=January 2013}}</ref>
The song features guest vocals from [[Rihanna]], marking the second collaboration of the pair, the first being Rihanna's number one single "[[What's My Name?

==Music video==

===Background===
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="They seemed to be super close, and that's what I wanted for the video. They fit together pretty well, so it was just easy.|source=- Director, Yoann Lemoine speaking of Drake and Rihanna.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Rihanna Sneaks A Peek Of Drake's 'Take Care' Video|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1682139/rihanna-drake-take-care-music-video.jhtml|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref>}}
A music video for "Take Care" was first brought to light in late December 2011. Following the release of the videos of Drake's previous videos for "[[Marvins Room]]" and "[[Headlines (Drake song)|Headlines]]", Drake told [[MTV]] News that fans could expect visuals for "Take Care" saying, "It's a project where I think visuals are called for. So we're working on definitely the 'Take Care' video, which we're trying to get shot soon."<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The music video was later filmed in February 2012, over three days. Director, [[Yoann Lemoine]] called the shoot "very minimal" and "mellow". He further revealed, "There's a lot of space in the video, and I wanted the visuals to pay tribute to that. When I listened to the track, I was seeing a landscape, involving animals and massive landscapes. I won't say too much, but it's very surprising that there are very few elements in it. It's very simple but there's this big sense of emptiness in it. It's not narrative at all, and it involves animals." Photos of the video were released to the internet on March 12, 2012, showing a grayscaled Drake and Rihanna consoling as well as close ups of both artists looking emotional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalgrind.com/music/drake-rihanna-take-care-video-behind-the-scenes-photos|title=Drake & Rihanna Stroke Each Other In "Take Care" Video (PHOTOS)|publisher=GlobalGrind|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref> The video was initially set to premiere on March 23, 2012, but was delayed due to editing purposes. Drake spoke of the delay and further commented on the video, saying:

<blockquote>"It had to go through a process – I shot it with a director who's incredible and we were just very specific about it. It's a big record and a lot of footage. It's [a] very artistic very abstract video – something that I wasn't used to. I'm usually used to a very straight forward concept so I'm really excited for people to see it because it's actually just something beautiful to look at. There's actually for once no story necessarily as far as there being a narrative like '[[What's My Name? (Rihanna song)|What's My Name?]]' or '[[We Found Love]]' where there's stories. This is just beautiful imagery."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/drake/news/rihanna-take-care-music-video-premiere/|title=Drake Says He And Rihanna Were 'Very Intimate' On 'Take Care' Music Video – Audio|publisher=[[Capital (radio network)|Capital FM]]|accessdate=2012-03-28}}</ref></blockquote>

Drake announced that the video would be released either on March 28 or March 29, 2012. However, yet again, it did not premiere on any of those dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/drake/news/rihanna-take-care-music-video-premiere/|title=Drake And Rihanna's 'Take Care' Music Video Will Be "Perfect"|date=December 22, 2011|work=Capital FM}}</ref> The video eventually later premiered on April 6, 2012 on [[MTV]] and [[OVO]], and was uploaded to Drake's official [[VEVO]] account on April 23. The video was released simultaneously with Drake's following single, "[[HYFR (Hell Ya Fucking Right)]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordonroad.net/2012/04/05/take-care-hyfr-videos-to-premiere-friday/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406234350/http://wordonroad.net/2012/04/05/take-care-hyfr-videos-to-premiere-friday/|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 6, 2012|title=Take Care & HYFR Videos To Premiere Friday|work=Word On Road}}</ref>

===Synopsis===
Drake explained the concept of the video in an interview, saying: "It's all basically the ups and downs of a relationship but represented in icebergs and fire and animals and just pulsating movement and then you've got me and Rihanna very intimate." This is shown first with a [[bull]] alone, a [[black-throated magpie-jay]] flying through the air, a [[tropical fish]], and a peacefully-presented landscape with snow-covered mountains, all presented calm and relaxed. However, arrows are later shot at the bull to represent [[poaching]], while fire, to represent [[global warming]] and [[wildfire]], destroys the outside landscape. The bird and fish are also shown to be frightened, moving abruptly. The video could also be perceived as [[global warming]] or the effect of human mistreatment, destroying the beauty of nature on its own. The video features a shot of a figure mid-air (Drake himself), with ash falling around him while another scene features a tribal dancer completing a [[back flip]] through the air, among other moves. Rihanna wears a simple tatty cardigan whilst Drake is seen in a T-shirt, to present simplicity. Throughout the video, the pair are seen alone in some scenes, while in others they embrace each other by hugging, and with Drake kissing Rihanna on the forehead towards the end. The video concludes with a shot of smoke from the wildfire slowly dying out.

===Reception===
Following the release of the "Take Care" video, critics praised it, lauding its simplicity. James Montgomery of [[MTV]] praised the video saying, "On Friday, Drake finally premiered his long-in-the-works 'Take Care' clip. And yes, it was worth the wait. Full of massively icy landscapes, achingly tense slow-motion footage, artfully framed animals and, uh, Rihanna, it is basically Drake personified. Morose and masterful, slow-burning and incredibly sexual (even when it's not supposed to be), it exudes both an incredible level of restraint and an over-the-top amount of pomp. It is very serious, very cold, very pained. Nothing much really happens, but at its conclusion, you feel like you've been through an awful lot (maybe a journey through the mind of Damien Hirst?). None of his contemporaries — not even the ever-obtuse [[Kanye West|Kanye]] [West] – make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it." He also titled the clip as "Frozen Planet".<ref>{{cite web|last=Montgomery|first=James|title=Drake And Rihanna's 'Take Care' Video: Frozen Planet|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1682678/drake-rihanna-take-care-music-video.jhtml|publisher=MTV|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref> Becky Bain of ''[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]'' also gave praise to the video and its simplicity, stating the video "floats through eerie and beautiful imagery" and concluded, "Even if you’re not exactly sure what’s going on, it’s a deeply moving clip."<ref>{{cite web|last=Bain|first=Becky|title=Drake Drops Two New Videos: "Take Care" With Rihanna & "HYFR" With Lil Wayne|url=http://idolator.com/6333892/drake-drops-two-new-videos-take-care-with-rihanna-hyfr-with-lil-wayne|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref> David Greenwald of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' commented, "While the minimalist video focuses on Drake and Rihanna singing and embracing, it's full of luxurious slow-motion photography of a number of animals and landscapes, include a fish, a bird and a dusty buffalo."<ref>{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=David|title=Rihanna, Lil Wayne Join Drake on 'Take Care,' 'HYFR' Videos |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/497049/rihanna-lil-wayne-join-drake-on-take-care-hyfr-videos|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
[[File:Rihanna_Diamonds_World_Tour_11,_2013.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The song features guest vocals from [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] recording artist [[Rihanna]]. The pair previously collaborated on Rihanna's number one single, "[[What's My Name? (Rihanna song)|What's My Name?]]" (2010).]]

The song has received universal acclaim from music critics. Rob Markman of [[MTV]] praised the track and described the song saying, "The Jamie xx-produced 'Take Care', with its pounding bass drum and sparse piano melody, tells the story of two lovers ready to leave behind their sketchy pasts in favor of a fruitful relationship together. Drake and Rih's real-life fling (one the rapper addressed on 2010's "[[Fireworks (Drake song)|Fireworks]]") only helps to enhance the song's appeal. Standing as both an endearing duet and a club banger, it's the danceable, Gil-Scott Heron-sampling house build toward the end of the song that truly makes it a standout."<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2011/12/21/drake-promises-video-for-rihanna-featured-take-care-single/|title=Drake Promises Video For Rihanna-Featured Single 'Take Care' |publisher=MTV|accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> David Amidon of [[PopMatters]] praised the collaboration between Drake and Rihanna as well as Rihanna's vocal performance with regard to the lyrical content, writing "Rihanna [delivers] a vocal far, far prettier than one would ever expect from her lips that essentially forgives Drake and promises him friendship for life."<ref>{{cite web|last=Amidon|first=David|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/151227-drake-take-care/|title=Drake: Take Care|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=November 14, 2011|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref>

Greg Kot of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' was critical of the song, as well as Rihanna's inclusion, writing "Even with serial-songstress Rihanna on "Take Care" (is it possible to release a pop-leaning album anymore without a Rihanna cameo?), the tone is muted, loaded with reverb and beats that occasionally drop out completely."<ref name="Kot">{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/turnitup/chi-drake-album-review-take-care-reviewed-20111113,0,928294.column|title=Drake album review; Take Care reviewed|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=November 13, 2011|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> The song was featured on MTV's must-hear pop songs list along with songs by [[Cher Lloyd]] and [[The Wanted]] in 2011.
