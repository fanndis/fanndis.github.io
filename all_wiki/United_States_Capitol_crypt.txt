The '''United States Capitol crypt''' is the large circular room filled with forty neoclassical [[Doric order|Doric]] columns directly beneath the [[United States Capitol rotunda]]. It was built originally to support the rotunda as well as offer an entrance to [[Washington's Tomb (United States Capitol)|Washington's Tomb]]. It currently serves as a museum and a repository for thirteen statues of the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]].

==Origin and construction==
The crypt originated with the initial designs drawn up for the [[United States Capitol]] by [[William Thornton]], which called for a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] to be placed between the two wings of the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aoc.gov/history-us-capitol-building|title=History of the U.S. Capitol Building|website=Architect of the Capitol}}</ref> The room beneath the rotunda was therefore required to support the large space above it. However, construction did not begin on the central part of the Capitol, where the rotunda and the room beneath it were located, until after the [[War of 1812]].

Construction on the Capitol itself began in 1793, when the first American [[President of the United States|President]], [[George Washington]], laid down the [[cornerstone]] to the north wing of the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aoc.gov/history-us-capitol-building|title=History of the U.S. Capitol Building|website=Architect of the Capitol}}</ref> Upon the death of Washington in 1799, the designers of the Capitol went to [[Martha Washington]] and requested permission to build a tomb for her husband in the Capitol. She acquiesced to this request and plans were made to construct the tomb underneath the floor that supported the rotunda. This area was designated the crypt, as it would serve as the entry to the tomb.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Delays wracked the construction efforts of the Capitol's builders, notably the interruption by the War of 1812, when all construction came to a halt. In August 1814, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] captured the city of Washington [[Burning of Washington|and set fire to the Capitol]], nearly destroying the entire building. Thus, when construction recommenced after the war ended in 1815, it was initially to rebuild what had been lost to the fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aoc.gov/history-us-capitol-building|title=History of the U.S. Capitol Building|website=Architect of the Capitol}}</ref>

The central section of the Capitol comprising the rotunda and the crypt was not completed until 1827 under the oversight of [[Architect of the Capitol]] [[Charles Bulfinch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aoc.gov/history-us-capitol-building|title=History of the U.S. Capitol Building|website=Architect of the Capitol}}</ref> However, plans to re-inter Washington in the Capitol fell apart when attempts were made to retrieve his body from [[Mount Vernon]], the President's home, due to restrictions of Washington's [[Will (law)|will]] and refusal of the plantation's then owner, John Washington.<ref>{{cite book |last= Savage |first= Kirk |date= 2009 |title= Monument Wars: Washington, D.C., the National Mall, and the Transformation of the Memorial Landscape|url= https://archive.org/details/monumentwarswash00sava |url-access= limited |page= [https://archive.org/details/monumentwarswash00sava/page/n61 49] |isbn= 9780520271333 }}</ref>

A marble compass was set into the floor of the chamber to mark the point where the [[Quadrants of Washington, D.C.|four quadrants]] of the [[District of Columbia]] meet.<ref name="AoC site on crypt">{{cite web|url=https://www.aoc.gov/capitol-buildings/crypt|title=Crypt|website=Architect of the Capitol}}</ref>

==Past usage==
In the late 1800s and early 1900s the crypt was used for bicycle parking.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leo|first1=Andrea|title=From the Archives: Bike Racks on Capitol Hill|url=https://www.aoc.gov/blog/archives-bike-racks-capitol-hill|website=aoc.gov|accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref>

==Present-day usage==
The crypt serves as the main thoroughfare of the ground floor of the Capitol and is a stop for all Capitol Tours provided through the [[Capitol Visitor Center]].

The crypt also contains the Magna Carta Case, a gold case which held one of the copies of ''[[Magna Carta]]'' when it was on loan to the United States for the Bicentennial celebration.
