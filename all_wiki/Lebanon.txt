In 64 BC, the [[Roman Empire]] conquered the region, and eventually became one of its leading centers of [[Christianity]]. The [[Mount Lebanon]] range saw the emergence of a monastic tradition known as the [[Maronite Church]]. As the [[Arab]] [[Muslim]]s [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquered]] the region, the [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronites]] held onto their religion and [[Religious identity|identity]]. However, a new religious group, the [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]], established themselves in Mount Lebanon as well, generating a religious divide that has lasted for centuries. During the [[Crusades]], the Maronites re-established contact with the [[Roman Catholic|Roman Catholic Church]] and asserted their communion with [[Holy See|Rome]]. These ties have influenced the region into the modern era.

Lebanon was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the 16th century and remained under their rule for the next 400 years. Following the empire's collapse after [[World War I]], the five provinces constituting modern Lebanon came under the [[French Mandate of Lebanon|French Mandate]]. The [[France|French]] expanded the borders of the [[Mount Lebanon Governorate]], which was predominately Maronite and Druze, to include more Muslims. Upon independence in 1943, Lebanon established a unique [[Confessionalism (politics)|confessionalist]] form of government, with the major religious sects [[Consociationalism|apportioned specific political powers]]. President [[Bechara El Khoury]], prime minister [[Riad El-Solh]], and minister of defence [[Emir Majid Arslan II]] are considered the founders of modern Lebanon and national heroes for their role in independence. Lebanon initially enjoyed political and economic stability, which was shattered by the bloody [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975–1990) between various political and sectarian factions. The war partially led to military occupations by [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|Syria]] (1975 to 2005) and [[Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon|Israel]] (1985 to 2000).

The borders of contemporary Lebanon are a product of the Treaty of Sèvres of 1920. Its territory was the core of the Bronze Age Phoenician (Canaanite) city-states. As part of the Levant, it was part of numerous succeeding empires throughout ancient history, including the Egyptian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Achaemenid Persian, Hellenistic, Roman and Sasanid Persian empires.

After the 7th-century Muslim conquest of the Levant, it was part of the Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid Seljuk and Fatimid empires. The crusader state of the County of Tripoli, founded by Raymond IV of Toulouse in 1102, encompassed most of present-day Lebanon, falling to the Mamluk Sultanate in 1289 and finally to the Ottoman Empire in 1516.<ref>{{Cite book|last=stefan|first=winter|title=The Shiites of Lebanon under Ottoman Rule, 1516-1788|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=October 25, 2012|isbn=978-1107411432|location=United Kingdom|pages=0–220}}</ref> With the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, Greater Lebanon fell under French mandate in 1920,<ref>{{Cite web|title=How it all began - A concise history of Lebanon|url=https://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/900/902/Kamal-Salibi/|access-date=2020-10-03|website=almashriq.hiof.no}}</ref> and gained independence under president Bechara El Khoury in 1943.

Evidence dating back to an early settlement in Lebanon was found in [[Byblos]], considered one of the [[oldest continuously inhabited cities]] in the world.<ref name="byblos" /> The evidence dates back to earlier than 5000 BC. Archaeologists discovered remnants of prehistoric huts with crushed limestone floors, primitive weapons, and [[Jar burial|burial jars]] left by the [[Neolithic]] and [[Copper Age|Chalcolithic]] fishing communities who lived on the shore of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] Sea over 7,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://destinationlebanon.gov.lb/eng/Byblos/History.asp |title=Archaeological Virtual Tours: Byblos |publisher=Destinationlebanon.gov.lb |accessdate=14 October 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080223164318/http://destinationlebanon.gov.lb/eng/Byblos/History.asp |archive-date = 23 February 2008}}</ref>

The region that is now Lebanon, as with the rest of Syria and much of [[Anatolia]], became a major center of Christianity in the [[Roman Empire]] during the early spread of the faith. During the late 4th and early 5th century, a hermit named [[Maron]] established a monastic tradition focused on the importance of [[monotheism]] and [[asceticism]], near the Mediterranean mountain range known as [[Mount Lebanon]]. The monks who followed Maron spread his teachings among Lebanese in the region. These Christians came to be known as [[Maronite]]s and moved into the mountains to avoid religious persecution by Roman authorities.<ref>{{cite book | title=From the Holy Mountain: A Journey Among the Christians of the Middle East | author=Dalrymple, William | year=1997 | publisher=Vintage Books (Random House) | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jHGYvr7rkrsC | page=305 | isbn=9780307948922 | access-date=20 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905212200/https://books.google.com/books?id=jHGYvr7rkrsC | archive-date=5 September 2015 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> During the frequent [[Roman-Persian Wars]] that lasted for many centuries, the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]] occupied what is now Lebanon from 619 till 629.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFTHBoRvQbsC&pg=PA338|title=Colonialism|accessdate=25 December 2014|isbn=9781576073353|last1=Page|first1=Melvin Eugene|last2=Sonnenburg|first2=Penny M.|year=2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012124706/https://books.google.com/books?id=qFTHBoRvQbsC&pg=PA338|archive-date=12 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the 7th century the Muslim Arabs [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquered Syria]] establishing a new regime to replace the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. Though Islam and the Arabic language were officially dominant under this new regime, the general populace nonetheless only gradually converted from Christianity and the Syriac language. The Maronite community, in particular, managed to maintain a large degree of autonomy despite the succession of rulers over Lebanon and Syria.

During the 11th century the [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]] religion emerged from a branch of [[Shia Islam]]. The new religion gained followers in the southern portion of Mount Lebanon. The northern portion of Mount Lebanon was ruled by Druze feudal families to the early 14th century which was then brought to an end by the Mamluk invasion. The Maronite population increased gradually in Northern Mount Lebanon and the Druze have remained in Southern Mount Lebanon until the modern era. In the south of Lebanon, [[Jabal Amel]], [[Baalbek]] and the [[Beqaa Valley]] was ruled by Shia feudal families under the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire. Major cities on the coast, [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Beirut]], and others, were directly administered by the Muslim Caliphs and the people became more fully absorbed by the Arab culture.

Following the fall of Roman [[Anatolia]] to the Muslim Turks, the Byzantines put out a call to the Pope in Rome for assistance in the 11th century. The result was a series of wars known as the [[Crusades]] launched by the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]] from Western Europe to reclaim the former Byzantine Christian territories in the Eastern Mediterranean, especially [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (the ''[[Levant]]''). The [[First Crusade]] succeeded in temporarily establishing the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]] as Roman Catholic Christian states along the coast.<ref>{{cite book | author=Hillenbrand, Carole | publisher=Psychology Press | year=2000 | title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives | isbn=978-1-57958-354-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UalnoF5MBHMC | pages=20–21 | access-date=20 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905174853/https://books.google.com/books?id=UalnoF5MBHMC | archive-date=5 September 2015 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> These crusader states made a lasting impact on the region, though their control was limited, and the region returned to full Muslim control after two centuries following the conquest by the Mamluks.

One of the most lasting effects of the Crusades in this region was the contact between the Franks (i.e. the French) and the Maronites. Unlike most other Christian communities in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], who swore allegiance to [[Constantinople]] or other local patriarchs, the Maronites proclaimed allegiance to the Pope in Rome. As such the Franks saw them as Roman Catholic brethren. These initial contacts led to centuries of support for the Maronites from France and Italy, even after the fall of the Crusader states in the region.

In the Middle East, Lebanon seems to offer a corresponding example. When the idea of a Greater Lebanon in 1908 was put forward in a book by Bulus Nujaym, a Lebanese Maronite writing under the pseudonym of M. Jouplain, he suggested that the natural boundaries of Lebanon were exactly the same as drawn in the 1861 and 1863 staff maps of the French military expedition to Syria, maps that added territories on the northern, eastern and southern borders, plus the city of Beirut, to the Mutasarrifiyya of Mount Lebanon. In this case, too, the prior existence of a European military map seems to have created a fact on the ground.}}</ref>]]

During this period Lebanon was divided into several provinces: Northern and Southern Mount Lebanon, Tripoli, Baalbek and Beqaa Valley and [[Jabal Amel]].
In southern Mount Lebanon in 1590, [[Fakhr-al-Din II]] became the successor to [[Mount Lebanon Emirate#Qurqumaz (1544–1585)|Korkmaz]]. He soon established his authority as paramount prince of the Druze in the Shouf area of Mount Lebanon. Eventually, Fakhr-al-Din II was appointed [[Sanjak-bey|Sanjakbey]] (Governor) of several Ottoman sub-provinces, with responsibility for tax-gathering. He extended his control over a substantial part of Mount Lebanon and its coastal area, even building a fort as far inland as [[Palmyra Castle|Palmyra]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Gorton, T.J. |title=Renaissance Emir |publisher=Quartet Books |date=25 April 2013 |isbn=9780704372979 |pages=160–161}}</ref> This over-reaching eventually became too much for Ottoman Sultan [[Murad IV]], who sent a punitive expedition to capture him in 1633.

On the death of the last Maan emir, various members of the Shihab clan ruled Mount Lebanon until 1830.

After the fighting ended in Lebanon, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] visited the area. Under political pressure from both inside and outside Lebanon, de Gaulle recognized the independence of Lebanon. On 26 November 1941, General [[Georges Catroux]] announced that Lebanon would become independent under the authority of the [[Free French]] government. Elections were held in 1943 and on 8 November 1943 the new Lebanese government unilaterally abolished the mandate. The French reacted by imprisoning the new government. In the face of international pressure, the French released the government officials on 22 November 1943. The [[Allies of World War II|allies]] occupied the region until the end of World War II.

Following the end of World War II in Europe the French mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the [[League of Nations]] or its successor the [[United Nations]]. The mandate was ended by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. Article 78 of the UN Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: "The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality."<ref>Mandates, Dependencies and Trusteeship, by H.

With the 1970 [[Black September in Jordan|defeat]] of the [[PLO]] in Jordan, many Palestinian militants relocated to Lebanon, increasing their [[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|armed campaign]] against Israel.

In April 1980 the presence of UNIFIL soldiers in the buffer zone led to the [[At Tiri incident]]. On 17 July 1981, Israeli aircraft bombed multi-story apartment buildings in Beirut that contained offices of PLO associated groups. The Lebanese delegate to the United Nations Security Council claimed that 300 civilians had been killed and 800 wounded. The bombing led to worldwide condemnation, and a temporary embargo on the export of U.S. aircraft to Israel.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Bombing of Beirut|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=11|issue=1|year=1981|pages=218–225|doi=10.1525/jps.1981.11.1.00p0366x}}</ref>
In August 1981, defense minister [[Ariel Sharon]] began to draw up plans to attack PLO military infrastructure in West Beirut, where PLO headquarters and command bunkers were located.<ref>Smith, op. cit., p. 377.</ref>

In 1982, the [[PLO in Lebanon|PLO]] attacks from Lebanon on Israel led to [[1982 Lebanon War|an Israeli invasion]], aiming to support Lebanese forces in driving out the PLO. A [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|multinational force]] of American, French and Italian contingents (joined in 1983 by a British contingent) were deployed in Beirut after [[Siege of Beirut|the Israeli siege of the city]], to supervise the evacuation of the PLO. The civil war re-emerged in September 1982 after the assassination of Lebanese President [[Bashir Gemayel]], an Israeli ally, and subsequent fighting. During this time a number of sectarian massacres occurred, such as in  [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|Sabra and Shatila]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/fisksabra.html |title=Sabra and Chatila Massacres After 19 years, The Truth at Last? |author=Fisk, Robert |work=CounterPunch |date=28 November 2001 |accessdate=1 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817063153/http://www.counterpunch.org/fisksabra.html |archive-date=17 August 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> and in [[War of the camps|several refugee camps]].<ref>''The War of the Camps'', Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 16, No. 1 (Autumn, 1986), pp. 191–194</ref> The multinational force was withdrawn in the spring of 1984, following [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|a devastating bombing attack]] during the previous year.

In September 1988, the Parliament failed to elect a successor to President Gemayel as a result of differences between the Christians, Muslims, and Syrians. The Arab League Summit of May 1989 led to the formation of a Saudi–Moroccan–Algerian committee to solve the crisis. On 16 September 1989 the committee issued a peace plan which was accepted by all. A ceasefire was established, the ports and airports were re-opened and refugees began to return.<ref name=fco-cpl/>

In the same month, the Lebanese Parliament agreed to the [[Taif Agreement]], which included an outline timetable for Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon and a formula for the de-confessionalisation of the Lebanese political system.<ref name=fco-cpl/>The civil war ended at the end of 1990 after sixteen years; it had caused massive loss of human life and property, and devastated the country's economy.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Lebanon}}
[[File:Qadisha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kadisha Valley]], a gorge in northern Lebanon]]

Lebanon is located in Western Asia between latitudes [[33rd parallel north|33°]] and [[35th parallel north|35° N]] and longitudes [[35th meridian east|35°]] and [[37th meridian east|37° E]]. Its land straddles the "northwest of the [[Arabian plate]]".<ref>Egyptian Journal of Geology – Volume 42, Issue 1 – Page 263, 1998</ref>

The country's surface area is {{convert|10452|sqkm}} of which {{convert|10230|sqkm}} is [[land area|land]]. Lebanon has a coastline and border of {{convert|225|km}} on the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the west, a {{convert|375|km}} border shared with [[Syria]] to the north and east and a {{convert|79|km}} long border with [[Israel]] to the south.<ref name="enbr">{{cite book | title=Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan – Middle East: region in transition | publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group | author=Etheredge, Laura S | year=2011| pages=85–159| isbn=978-1-61530-414-1}}</ref> The [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|border]] with the Israeli-occupied [[Golan Heights]] is disputed by Lebanon in a small area called [[Shebaa Farms]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Philps |first=Alan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/lebanon/1343868/Israel%27s-withdrawal-from-Lebanon-given-UN%27s-endorsement.html |title=Israel's Withdrawal from Lebanon Given UN's Endorsement |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 June 2000 |accessdate=17 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222035407/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/lebanon/1343868/Israel%27s-withdrawal-from-Lebanon-given-UN%27s-endorsement.html |archive-date=22 February 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

[[File:Satellite image of Lebanon in March 2002.jpg|thumb|upright|Lebanon from space. Snow cover can be seen on the western [[Lebanon Mountains|Mount Lebanon]] and eastern [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains|Anti-Lebanon]] mountain ranges]]
Lebanon is divided into four distinct [[Physical geography|physiographic]] regions: the coastal plain, the [[Lebanon Mountains|Lebanon mountain]] range, the [[Beqaa valley]] and the [[Anti-Lebanon mountains]].

The narrow and discontinuous [[coastal plain]] stretches from the Syrian border in the north where it widens to form the [[Akkar]] plain to [[Naqoura|Ras al-Naqoura]] at the border with Israel in the south. The fertile coastal plain is formed of marine sediments and river deposited [[alluvium]] alternating with sandy bays and rocky beaches.
The Lebanon mountains rise steeply parallel to the Mediterranean coast and form a ridge of [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]] that runs for most of the country's length. The mountain range varies in width between {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|56|km|0|abbr=on}}; it is carved by narrow and deep gorges. The Lebanon mountains peak at {{convert|3088|m}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] in [[Qurnat as Sawda']] in [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]] and gradually slope to the south before rising again to a height of {{convert|2695|m}} in [[Mount Sannine]]. The Beqaa valley sits between the Lebanon mountains in the west and the Anti-Lebanon range in the east; it is a part of the [[Great Rift Valley]] system. The valley is {{convert|180|km|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|10|to|26|km|0|abbr=on}} wide, its fertile soil is formed by alluvial deposits. The Anti-Lebanon range runs parallel to the Lebanon mountains, its highest peak is in [[Mount Hermon]] at {{convert|2814|m}}.<ref name="enbr"/>

The mountains of Lebanon are drained by [[Intermittent stream|seasonal torrents]] and [[perennial stream|rivers]] foremost of which is the {{convert|145|km}} long [[Litani river|Leontes]] that rises in the Beqaa Valley to the west of [[Baalbek]] and empties into the Mediterranean Sea north of Tyre.<ref name="enbr"/> Lebanon has [[List of rivers of Lebanon|16 rivers]] all of which are [[navigability|non navigable]]; 13 rivers originate from [[Mount Lebanon]] and run through the steep gorges and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the other three arise in the [[Beqaa Valley]].<ref name=MOTE>{{cite web|last=ECODIT|title=National action plan for the reduction of pollution into the mediterranean sea from land based sources|url=http://smap.ew.eea.europa.eu/media_server/files/C/f/NAP_Med.pdf|publisher=Lebanese ministry of the environment|accessdate=31 January 2012|date=October 2005}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Lebanon}}

Lebanon has a moderate [[Mediterranean climate]]. In coastal areas, winters are generally cool and rainy whilst summers are hot and humid. In more elevated areas, temperatures usually drop below freezing during the winter with heavy snow cover that remains until early summer on the higher mountaintops.<ref name="enbr"/><ref>(Bonechi et al.)

As a result of longstanding exploitation, few old cedar trees remain in pockets of forests in Lebanon, but there is an active program to conserve and regenerate the forests. The Lebanese approach has emphasized natural regeneration over planting by creating the right conditions for [[germination]] and growth. The Lebanese state has created several nature reserves that contain cedars, including the [[Al Shouf Cedar Nature Reserve|Shouf Biosphere Reserve]], the Jaj Cedar Reserve, the [[Tannourine]] Reserve, the Ammouaa and Karm Shbat Reserves in the Akkar district, and the Forest of the [[Cedars of God]] near [[Bsharri]].<ref>Talhouk, S.

Beirut and Mount Lebanon have been facing a severe garbage crisis. After the closure of the Bourj Hammoud dump in 1997, the al-Naameh dumpsite was opened by the government in 1998. The al-Naameh dumpsite was planned to contain 2 million tons of waste for a limited period of six years at the most. It was designed to be a temporary solution, while the government would have devised a long-term plan. Sixteen years later al-Naameh was still open and exceeded its capacity by 13 million tons. In July 2015 the residents of the area, already protesting in the recent years, forced the closure of the dumpsite.The inefficiency of the government, as well as the corruption inside of the waste management company Sukleen in charge of managing the garbage in Lebanon, have resulted in piles of garbage blocking streets in Mount Lebanon and Beirut.<ref>{{cite web|last1=chronicle.fanack.com|title=Republic of Rubbish|url=https://chronicle.fanack.com/lebanon/history-past-to-present/republic-of-rubbish/|website=fanack.com|accessdate=12 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903235706/https://chronicle.fanack.com/lebanon/history-past-to-present/republic-of-rubbish/|archive-date=3 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In December 2015, the Lebanese government signed an agreement with Chinook Industrial Mining, part owned by [[Chinook Sciences]], to export over 100,000 tons of untreated waste from  [[Beirut]] and the surrounding area. The waste had accumulated in temporary locations following the government closure of the county's largest land fill site five months earlier. The contract was jointly signed with Howa International which has offices in Holland and Germany. The contract is reported to cost $212 per ton. The waste, which  is compacted and infectious, would have to be sorted and was estimated to be enough to fill 2,000 containers.<ref>[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2015/Dec-28/329219-exportation-plan-was-lebanons-only-option-environment-minister.ashx] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108030730/http://www.dailystar.com.lb//News/Lebanon-News/2015/Dec-28/329219-exportation-plan-was-lebanons-only-option-environment-minister.ashx |date=8 January 2016 }} Exportation plan was Lebanon's only option.

===Law===
There are 18 officially recognized religious groups in Lebanon, each with its own family law legislation and set of religious courts.<ref name="unesco1">{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/SHS/pdf/Women_in_Personal_Status_Laws.pdf |title=Women In Personal Status Laws |accessdate=26 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010052503/http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/SHS/pdf/Women_in_Personal_Status_Laws.pdf |archive-date=10 October 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

The Lebanese legal system is based on the [[Law of France|French system]], and is a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] country, with the exception for matters related to personal status (succession, marriage, divorce, adoption, etc.), which are governed by a separate set of laws designed for each sectarian community. For instance, the Islamic personal status laws are inspired by the [[Sharia]] law.<ref name="globalex"/> For Muslims, these tribunals deal with questions of marriage, divorce, custody, and inheritance and wills. For non-Muslims, personal status jurisdiction is split: the law of inheritance and wills falls under national civil jurisdiction, while Christian and Jewish religious courts are competent for marriage, divorce, and custody. Catholics can additionally appeal before the [[Roman Rota|Vatican Rota court]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mallat.com/articles/T/The%20Lebanese%20Legal%20System.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516171921/http://www.mallat.com/articles/T/The%20Lebanese%20Legal%20System.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 May 2011 |title=The Lebanese Legal System |author=Chibli Mallat |accessdate=17 January 2013 }}</ref>

The Lebanese court system consists of three levels: courts of first instance, courts of appeal, and the court of cassation.

There also is a system of religious courts having jurisdiction over personal status matters within their own communities, with rules on matters such as marriage and inheritance.<ref name="Carnegie">{{Cite journal | publisher = [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] | last = Carnegie Endowment for International Peace | title = Arab Political Systems: Baseline Information and Reforms – Lebanon | accessdate = 4 July 2009 | url = http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/Lebanon_APS.doc | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090725093222/https://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/Lebanon_APS.doc | archive-date = 25 July 2009 | url-status=live | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Lebanon}}

Lebanon concluded negotiations on an association agreement with the European Union in late 2001, and both sides initialed the accord in January 2002. It is included in the European Union's [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] (ENP), which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer. Lebanon also has bilateral trade agreements with several Arab states and is working toward accession to the [[World Trade Organization]].

Lebanon enjoys good relations with virtually all of the other Arab countries (despite historic tensions with Libya and Syria), and hosted an [[Arab League]] Summit in March 2002 for the first time in more than 35 years. Lebanon is a member of the [[Francophonie]] countries and hosted the Francophonie Summit in October 2002 as well as the [[Jeux de la Francophonie]] in [[2009 Jeux de la Francophonie|2009]].

The Syrian crisis has significantly affected Lebanese economic and financial situation. The demographic pressure imposed by the Syrian refugees now living in Lebanon has led to competition in the labour market. As a direct consequence unemployment has doubled in three years, reaching 20% in 2014. A loss of 14% of wages regarding the salary of less-skilled workers has also been registered. The financial constraints were also felt: the poverty rate increased with 170,000 Lebanese falling under the poverty threshold. In the period between 2012 and 2014, the public spending increased by $1 billion and losses amounted to $7.5 billion. Expenditures related only to the Syrian refugees were estimated by the Central Bank of Lebanon as $4.5 billion every year.<ref name="chronicle.fanack.com">{{cite web|last1=Fanack|title=Lebanon: Syrian Refugees Cost the Economy $4.5 Billion Every Year|url=https://chronicle.fanack.com/lebanon/economy/lebanon-syrian-refugees-cost-the-economy-4-5-billion-every-year/|website=Fanack.com|accessdate=14 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714171926/https://chronicle.fanack.com/lebanon/economy/lebanon-syrian-refugees-cost-the-economy-4-5-billion-every-year/|archive-date=14 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The culture of Lebanon reflects the legacy of various civilizations spanning thousands of years. Originally home to the [[Canaan]]ite-[[Phoenicia]]ns, and then subsequently conquered and occupied by the [[Assyria]]ns, the [[Persia]]ns, the [[Greeks]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the Arabs, the [[Fatimids]], the Crusaders, the [[Ottoman Turks]] and most recently the French, Lebanese culture has over the millennia evolved by borrowing from all of these groups. Lebanon's diverse population, composed of different ethnic and religious groups, has further contributed to the country's festivals, musical styles and literature as well as cuisine. Despite the ethnic, linguistic, religious and denominational diversity of the Lebanese, they "share an almost common culture".<ref name="StokesJamie">Stokes, Jamie.

===Holidays and festivals===
{{Main|Public holidays in Lebanon}}Lebanon celebrates national and both [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] and [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]] holidays. Christian holidays are celebrated following both the [[Gregorian Calendar]] and [[Julian Calendar]]. [[Greek Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]] (with the exception of Easter), [[Roman Catholicism in Lebanon|Catholics]], [[Protestantism in Lebanon|Protestants]], and [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkite]] Christians follow the Gregorian Calendar and thus celebrate Christmas on 25 December. Armenian [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Apostolic]] Christians celebrate Christmas on 6 January, as they follow the Julian Calendar. Muslim holidays are followed based on the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslim holidays that are celebrated include Eid al-Fitr (the three-day feast at the end of the Ramadan month), Eid al-Adha (The Feast of the Sacrifice) which is celebrated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and also celebrates Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son to God, the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, and Ashura (the Shiite Day of Mourning). Lebanon's National Holidays include Workers Day, Independence day, and Martyrs Day. Music festivals, often hosted at historical sites, are a customary element of Lebanese culture.<ref name="Festivals">{{Cite book|last=Sheehan|first=Sean|author2=Latif |others=Zawiah|title=Lebanon|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Children's Books|date=30 August 2007|series=Cultures of the World|volume=13|page=123|chapter=Leisure|isbn=978-0-7614-2081-1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cA-RDzlwVVAC&pg=PA123}}</ref> Among the most famous are [[Baalbeck International Festival]], [[Byblos International Festival]], [[Beiteddine Festival|Beiteddine International Festival]], [http://www.jouniehinternationalfestival.com/ Jounieh International Festival], Broumana Festival, [http://www.batrounfestival.org/ Batroun International Festival], [https://www.facebook.com/ehmejfestival/ Ehmej Festival], Dhour Chwer Festival and Tyr Festival.<ref name="Festivals" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Carter|first=Terry|author2=Dunston Lara|others=Humphreys Andrew|title=Syria & Lebanon|publisher=Lonely Planet|date=1 August 2004|edition=2|series=Guidebook Series|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781864503333/page/11 11]|chapter=Getting Started|isbn=978-1-86450-333-3|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EskzgI-229IC&pg=PA11|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781864503333/page/11}}</ref> These festivals are promoted by Lebanon's [[Ministry of Tourism (Lebanon)|Ministry of Tourism]].

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Lebanese cuisine}}

Lebanese cuisine is similar to those of many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], and [[Cyprus]]. The Lebanese national dishes are the [[kibbe]], a meat pie made from finely minced [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] and [[burghul]] (cracked [[wheat]]), and the [[tabbouleh]], a salad made from [[parsley]], [[tomato]]es, and burghul. The national beverage is [[Arak (drink)|arak]], a strong [[anise]]-flavored liquor made from fermented [[grape juice]]. It is usually drunk with water and ice, which turns the clear liquid milky-white, and usually accompanies food. Arak is a strong spirit similar to the Greek ouzo and the Turkish raki. Lebanese restaurant meals begin with a wide array of [[mezze]] - small savoury dishes, such as dips, salads, and pastries. The mezze are typically followed by a selection of grilled [[meat]] or [[fish]]. In general, meals are finished with [[Arabic coffee]] and fresh [[fruit]], though sometimes a selection of traditional sweets will be offered as well. [[M'Juhdara]], a thick stew of [[onions]], [[rice]], and [[lentils]], is sometimes considered poor man's fare and is often eaten around [[Lent]] by people in the Lebanese diaspora. Beirut and its environs contain many restaurants of various national origins. At the same time, [[wine]] is growing in popularity and a number of vineyards currently exist in the [[Bekaa valley]] and elsewhere. [[Beer]] is also highly popular and Lebanon produces a number of local beers, of which [[almaza]] is perhaps the most popular.
