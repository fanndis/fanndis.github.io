A '''gorsedd''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɔr|s|ɛ|ð}}, plural ''gorseddau'') is a community or meeting of modern-day [[bard]]s. The word is of Welsh origin, meaning "throne". It is often spelled '''gorsedh''' in [[Cornwall]] and '''goursez''' in [[Brittany]], reflecting the spellings in the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]] languages, respectively.

When the term is used without qualification, it usually refers to the national Gorsedd of [[Wales]], namely ''[[Gorsedd Cymru]].''<ref>[http://www.gorsedd.org/]</ref> However, other gorseddau exist, such as the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] [[Gorsedh Kernow]],<ref>[http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/ Byrth Gorseth Kernow – The Gorseth of the Bards of Cornwall]</ref> the [[Breton language|Breton]] [[Goursez Vreizh]]<ref>[http://www.gorsedd.com/ Home]</ref> and Gorsedd [[y Wladfa]], in the Welsh Settlement in Patagonia.<ref>E. Wyn James, ‘Identity, Immigration, and Assimilation: The Case of the Welsh Settlement in Patagonia’, Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, 24 (2018), 76-87. ISSN 0959-3632.</ref>

Gorseddau exist to promote literary scholarship and the creation of [[poetry]] and [[music]].<ref>Hanes Gorsedd y Beirdd Geraint & Zonia Bowen; Barddas 1991</ref> As part of this, their most visible activity can be seen at [[Eisteddfod]]au – Welsh language festivals.

==History==
[[Image:PhotoGorsedd.jpg|thumb|250px|Goursez Vreizh (the Gorsedd of [[Brittany]]) in 1906]]
Gorsedd Cymru was originally founded as [[Gorsedd Beirdd Ynys Prydain]] in 1792 by Edward Williams, commonly known as [[Iolo Morganwg]], who also invented much of its ritual, supposedly based on the activities of the ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Druidry]].<ref>[http://www.gorsedd.org/hanes.php Gorsedd y Beridd] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725182049/http://www.gorsedd.org/hanes.php |date=2010-07-25 }} – Hanes (History). Accessed 5 December 2009. Welsh language page only.</ref> Nowadays, much of its ritual has [[Christianity|Christian]] influence, and were given further embellishment in the 1930s by [[Albert Evans-Jones|Cynan]] (later Archdruid 1950–1954 and 1963–1966).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Gorsedd Beirdd Ynys Prydain |editor-last=Koch |editor-first=John T. |encyclopedia=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc. |date=2006 |page=836 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&pg=PA836 |isbn=1-85109-445-8}}</ref> The Gorsedd made its first appearance at an Eisteddfod at the Ivy Bush Inn in Carmarthen in 1819, and its close association with the Festival has remained. It is an association of poets, writers, musicians, artists and individuals who have made a significant and distinguished contribution to Welsh language, literature, and culture. 

The fictitious origin of these ceremonies was established by Professor G.J. Williams in works touching on Iolo Morganwg.<ref>Traddodiad Llenyddol Morgannwg, 1948</ref>

==Symbolism==

The symbol commonly used to represent a Gorsedd is a triple line, the middle line upright and the outer two slanted towards the top of the centre, thus: {{mono|/|\}}.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/bim1/bim1033.htm Barddas of Iolo Morganwg, Vol I – The Sacred Symbol]</ref> This symbol, called "[[awen]]", is often explained as representing the [[sun]].<ref name="gorsethkernow.org.uk">[http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/ceremony.htm Gorseth Kernow – The Gorseth of Cornwall: Ceremonies and Regalia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206205704/http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/ceremony.htm |date=2010-02-06 }}</ref> The word "awen" means "muse" in Welsh.
