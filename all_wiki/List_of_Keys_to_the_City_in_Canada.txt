The '''Key to the City''' is a symbol of the [[Freedom of the City]] presented by a town or city's municipal government to esteemed residents or visitors whom the city wishes to honour. The award, usually an ornamental key, is generally presented by the mayor or some other public figure at an award ceremony. Some cities allow visiting celebrities to request that a key be granted to them, a practice which has resulted in some controversy.<ref name=whosideawasthat />

The local equivalent is the [[Calgary White Hat|White Hat ceremony]], which was begun in the 1950s by Mayor [[Donald Hugh MacKay]]. The first white felt cowboy hat was given to the Mayor of Toronto, [[Hiram E. McCallum]], as thanks for his hosting during the [[36th Grey Cup]] (1948). The honour can be requested through Tourism Calgary; white hatting ceremonies are also conducted for individual tourists and groups by a volunteer corps at the [[Calgary International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yycrunway.ca/News/tabid/91/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/263/YYCs-Iconic-White-Hat-Volunteers-Celebrate-a-Quarter-Century-of-Service.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018072743/http://www.yycrunway.ca/News/tabid/91/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/263/YYCs-Iconic-White-Hat-Volunteers-Celebrate-a-Quarter-Century-of-Service.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 October 2017|title=YYC's Iconic White Hat Volunteers Celebrate a Quarter Century of Service (press release)|date=29 June 2016|accessdate=19 October 2017|publisher=[[Calgary International Airport]]}}</ref> Past recipients include:
