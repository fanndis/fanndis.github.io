In the [[English language]], the word '''''nigger''''' is an [[ethnic slur]] typically directed at [[black people]], especially [[African Americans]].

The word originated in the 18th century as an adaptation of the Spanish word ''[[wikt:negro#Spanish|negro]]'', a descendant of the [[Latin]] adjective ''[[wikt:niger#Latin|niger]]'', which means "black".<ref name="Pilgrim">{{cite web |url=http://www.ferris.edu/news/jimcrow/caricature/ |title=Nigger and Caricatures |accessdate=June 19, 2007 |last=Pilgrim |first=David |date=September 2001}}</ref> It was used derogatorily, and by the mid-20th century, particularly in the United States, its usage by anyone other than a black person had come to be generally seen as [[pejorative]], a [[racist]] insult. Accordingly, it began to disappear from general popular culture. Its inclusion in classic works of literature has sparked modern controversy.

Because the term is considered extremely offensive, it is often referred to by the [[euphemism]] '''''the N-word'''''. However, it remains in use, particularly as the variant ''[[nigga]]'', by African Americans among themselves. The spelling ''nigga'' reflects the pronunciation of ''nigger'' in [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhotic]] dialects of English.

== Etymology and history ==
{{Main|Negro}}
The variants ''neger'' and ''negar'' derive from various European languages' words for 'black', including the Spanish and Portuguese word {{lang|es|negro}} (black) and the now-pejorative French ''nègre'', the 'i' entering the spelling "nigger" from those familiar with Latin. Etymologically, ''negro'', ''noir'', ''nègre'', and ''nigger'' ultimately derive from ''nigrum'', the stem of the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|niger}} ('black'), pronounced {{IPA|[ˈniɡer]}}, with a [[Alveolar trill|trilled]] ''r''. In every [[grammatical case]], [[grammatical gender]], and [[grammatical number]] besides [[nominative case|nominative]] masculine singular, ''nigr-'' is followed by a [[case ending]].<!--Romance language nouns (typically) derive from the accusative case, not the nominative case quoted in English. -->

In its original English-language usage, ''nigger'' (then spelled ''niger'') was a word for a dark-skinned individual. The earliest known published use of the term dates from 1574, in a work alluding to "the Nigers of [[Aethiopia|Aethiop]], bearing witnes."<ref>{{cite book |author=Patricia T.

During the [[North American fur trade#Fur trade in the western United States|fur trade of the early 1800s to the late 1840s in the Western United States]], the word was spelled "niggur," and is often recorded in the literature of the time. [[George Fredrick Ruxton]] used it in his "[[mountain man]]" lexicon, without pejorative [[connotation]]. "Niggur" was evidently similar to the modern use of "[[dude]]" or "guy." This passage from Ruxton's ''Life in the Far West'' illustrates the word in spoken form—the speaker here referring to himself: "Travler, marm, this niggur's no travler; I ar' a trapper, marm, a mountain-man, wagh!"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ruxton |first=George Frederick |title=Life In the Far West |year=1846 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=978-0-8061-1534-4}}</ref> It was not used as a term exclusively for blacks among mountain men during this period, as Indians, Mexicans, and Frenchmen and Anglos alike could be a "niggur."<ref>{{cite web |title=Language of the Rendezvous |url=http://www.coon-n-crockett.org/cnc~glos.htm|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121220150711/http://www.coon-n-crockett.org/cnc~glos.htm |archive-date=December 20, 2012}}</ref> "The noun slipped back and forth from derogatory to endearing."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Coleman |first1=Jon |title=Here Lies Hugh Glass: A Mountain Man, a Bear, and the Rise of the American Nation |url=http://us.macmillan.com/herelieshughglass/jontcoleman |date=2012 |publisher=Macmillan |pages=272 |accessdate=November 21, 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The term "[[colored]]" or "negro" became a respectful alternative. In 1851 the [[Boston Vigilance Committee]], an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist organization]], posted warnings to the ''Colored People of Boston and vicinity''. Writing in 1904, journalist [[Clifton Johnson (author)|Clifton Johnson]] documented the "opprobrious" character of the word ''nigger'', emphasizing that it was chosen in the South precisely because it was more offensive than "colored" or "negro."<ref>{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Clifton |date=October 14, 1904 |title=They Are Only "Niggers" in the South |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84025811/1904-10-14/ed-1/seq-5/ |newspaper=The Seattle Republican |location=Seattle, Wash. |publisher=Republican Pub.

In 2008 Carla Sims, its communications director, said "the term 'colored' is not derogatory, [the NAACP] chose the word 'colored' because it was the most positive description commonly used [in 1909, when the association was founded].

Nineteenth-century literature features usages of "nigger" without racist connotation. [[Mark Twain]], in the autobiographic book ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'' (1883), used the term within quotes, indicating [[reported speech]], but used the term "negro" when writing in his own [[Persona#In literature|narrative persona]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Twain |first=Mark |title=Life on the Mississippi |journal=Academic Medicine : Journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges |publisher=James R.

A style guide to [[British English]] usage, [[H. W. Fowler]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' states in the first edition (1926) that applying the word ''nigger'' to "others than full or partial negroes" is "felt as an insult by the person described, & betrays in the speaker, if not deliberate insolence, at least a very arrogant inhumanity;" but the second edition (1965) states "N. has been described as 'the term that carries with it all the obloquy and contempt and rejection which whites have inflicted on blacks'."

By the late 1960s, the social change brought about by the [[civil rights movement]] had legitimized the [[identity politics|racial identity]] word ''black'' as mainstream American English usage to denote black-skinned Americans of African ancestry. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] had used this word of his slaves in his ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1785), but "black" had not been widely used until the later 20th century. (See [[Black Pride]], and, in the context of worldwide anti-colonialism initiatives, [[Negritude]].)

In the 1980s, the term "[[African American]]" was advanced analogously to the terms "[[German American]]" and "[[Irish American]]," and was adopted by major media outlets. Moreover, as a [[compound word]], ''African American'' resembles the [[vogue word]] ''Afro-American'', an early-1970s popular usage. Some black Americans continue to use the word ''nigger'', often spelled as ''[[nigga]]'' and ''niggah'', without irony, either to neutralize the word's impact or as a sign of solidarity.<ref>Allan, Keith.

Surveys from 2006 showed that the American public widely perceived usage of the term to be wrong or unacceptable, but that nearly half of whites and two-thirds of blacks knew someone personally who referred to blacks by the term.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/25/using-the-n-word-is-more-common-than-you-or-president-obama-may-think/ |title=Using the n-word is more common than you (or President Obama) may think |website=Washington Post |language=en|access-date=August 15, 2018}}</ref> Nearly one-third of whites and two-thirds of blacks said they had personally used the term within the last five years.<ref name=":0" />

The implied racism of the word ''nigger'' has rendered its use [[taboo]]. Magazines and newspapers generally do not use the word but instead print censored versions such as "n*gg*r," "n**ger," "n——" or "the N-word;"<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nigger |title=''Nigger'' Usage Alert |dictionary=[[dictionary.com]] |accessdate=July 23, 2015}}</ref> see [[Nigger#The N-word euphemism|below]].

The use of ''nigger'' in older literature has become controversial because of the word's modern meaning as a racist insult. One of the most enduring controversies has been the word's use in [[Mark Twain]]'s novel ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1885). ''Huckleberry Finn'' was the fifth most challenged book during the 1990s, according to the [[American Library Association]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/banned/frequentlychallenged/challengedbydecade/1990_1999/index.cfm |title=100 most frequently challenged books: 1990–1999 |work=ala.org |date=March 27, 2013}}</ref> The novel is written from the point of view, and largely in the language, of an uneducated white boy, who is drifting down the Mississippi River on a raft with an adult escaped slave, Jim.

In 2011, a new edition published by [[NewSouth Books]] replaced the word "nigger" with "slave" and also removed the word "injun." The change was spearheaded by Twain scholar [[Alan Gribben]] in the hope of "countering the 'pre-emptive censorship'" that results from the book's being removed from school curricula over language concerns.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/05/huckleberry-finn-edition-censors-n-word |title=New Huckleberry Finn edition censors 'n-word' |newspaper=the Guardian|date=January 5, 2011 |last1=Page |first1=Benedicte }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Twain |first=Mark |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1842832_1842838,00.html?iid=moreontime |title='The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' – Removing the N Word from Huck Finn: Top 10 Censored Books |work=TIME |date=January 7, 2011 |accessdate=January 23, 2011}}</ref> The changes sparked outrage from critics [[Elon James]], [[Alexandra Petrie]] and [[Chris Meadows]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2011/0105/The-n-word-gone-from-Huck-Finn-what-would-Mark-Twain-say |title=The 'n'-word gone from Huck Finn – what would Mark Twain say? |author=The Christian Science Monitor |journal=The Christian Science Monitor |date=January 5, 2011}}</ref>

===In the workplace===
In 2018, the head of the media company [[Netflix]], [[Reed Hastings]], fired his chief communications officer for using the word twice during internal discussions about sensitive words.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mele |first1=Christopher |title=Netflix Fires Chief Communications Officer Over Use of Racial Slur |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/business/media/jonathan-friedland-netflix-racial-slur.html |accessdate=June 23, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=June 23, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> In explaining why, Hastings wrote:

:"[The word's use] in popular media like music and film have created some confusion as to whether or not there is ever a time when the use of the N-word is acceptable. For non-Black people, the word should not be spoken as there is almost no context in which it is appropriate or constructive (even when singing a song or reading a script). There is not a way to neutralize the emotion and history behind the word in any context. The use of the phrase 'N-word' was created as a euphemism, and the norm, with the intention of providing an acceptable replacement and moving people away from using the specific word. When a person violates this norm, it creates resentment, intense frustration, and great offense for many."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Landy |first1=Heather |title=Read the Netflix CEO's excellent memo about firing an executive who used the N-word |url=https://work.qz.com/1313072/read-netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-memo-about-the-firing-of-pr-chief-jonathan-friedland-for-using-the-n-word/ |accessdate=June 23, 2018 |work=Quartz at Work |date=June 23, 2018}}</ref>

=== Intra-group versus intergroup usage ===
{{Main|Nigga}}
{{See also|Ingroups and outgroups}}
Black listeners often react to the term differently, depending on whether it is used by white speakers or by black speakers. In the former case, it is regularly understood as insensitive or insulting; in the latter, it may carry notes of in-group disparagement, and is often understood as neutral or affectionate, a possible instance of [[reappropriation]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In the black community, ''nigger'' is often rendered as ''[[nigga]]'', representing the [[arhotic]] pronunciation of the word in [[African-American English]]. This usage has been popularized by the [[rap]] and [[hip-hop]] music cultures and is used as part of an in-group lexicon and speech. It is not necessarily derogatory and is often used to mean ''homie'' or ''friend''.<ref name="usage-alert">{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nigga |title=''Nigga'' Usage Alert |dictionary=[[dictionary.com]] |accessdate=July 23, 2015}}</ref>

Acceptance of intra-group usage of the word ''nigga'' is still debated,<ref name="usage-alert" /> although it has established a foothold amongst younger generations. The [[NAACP]] denounces the use of both "nigga" and "nigger." Mixed-race usage of "nigga" is still considered taboo, particularly if the speaker is white. However, trends indicate that usage of the term in intragroup settings is increasing even amongst white youth, due to the popularity of rap and hip hop culture.<ref name="ENQ">Kevin Aldridge, Richelle Thompson and Earnest Winston.

''The Cincinnati Enquirer'', August 5, 2001.</ref> Linguist Keith Allan rejects the view that nigger is always a slur, arguing that it is also used as a marker of camaraderie and friendship, comparable to the British and Australian term "mate" or the American "buddy".<ref>Allan, Keith.

According to Arthur K. Spears in ''Diverse Issues in Higher Education, 2006'':
{{quote|quote=In many African-American neighborhoods, nigga is simply the most common term used to refer to any male, of any race or ethnicity. Increasingly, the term has been applied to any person, male or female. "Where y'all niggas goin?" is said with no self-consciousness or animosity to a group of women, for the routine purpose of obtaining information. The point: Nigga is evaluatively neutral in terms of its inherent meaning; it may express positive, neutral, or negative attitudes;<ref>{{cite journal |title=Perspectives: A View of the 'N-Word' from Sociolinguistics |url=http://diverseeducation.com/article/6114/ |last=Spears |first=Dr. Arthur K. |journal=Diverse Issues in Higher Education |date=July 12, 2006}}</ref>}}<!-- end of quotation template -->

Kevin Cato, meanwhile, observes:

{{quote|quote=For instance, a show on [[Black Entertainment Television]], a cable network aimed at a black audience, described the word nigger as a "[[term of endearment]]". "In the African American community, the word nigga (not nigger) brings out feelings of pride." (Davis{{nbsp}}1). Here the word evokes a sense of community and oneness among black people. Many teens I interviewed felt that the word had no power when used amongst friends, but when used among white people the word took on a completely different meaning. In fact, comedian Alex Thomas on BET stated, "I still better not hear no white boy say that to me{{nbsp}}... I hear a white boy say that to me, it means 'White boy, you gonna get your ass beat.'"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wrt-intertext.syr.edu/XI/Nigger.html |title=Nigger |publisher=Wrt-intertext.syr.edu |accessdate=January 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517143530/http://wrt-intertext.syr.edu/XI/Nigger.html |archive-date=May 17, 2011}}</ref>}}

Addressing the use of ''nigger'' by black people, philosopher and [[public intellectual]] [[Cornel West]] said in 2007:
{{quote|There's a certain rhythmic seduction to the word. If you speak in a sentence, and you have to say ''cat'', ''companion'', or ''friend'', as opposed to ''nigger'', then the rhythmic presentation is off. That rhythmic language is a form of historical memory for black people{{nbsp}}... When [[Richard Pryor]] came back from Africa, and decided to stop using the word onstage, he would sometimes start to slip up, because he was so used to speaking that way.

==== 2010s: increase in use and controversy ====

A 2018 survey found that while the majority of respondents agreed it was unacceptable for a non-black speaker to use nigger or its derivatives, opinions were nonetheless divided on whether it was acceptable for anyone to use the term in any context, with a small majority believing the term was simply offensive and thus should not be used by anyone in any context.<ref>King, Wyman, Richard Emanuel, Xavier Brown, Niroby Dingle, Vertis Lucas, Anissa Perkins, Ayzia Turner, Destinee Whittington, and Qwa'dryna Witherspoon.

It also is or was a colloquial technical term in industry, mining, and seafaring.

The [[euphemism]] ''the [[wikt:n-word|N-word]]'' became mainstream American English usage during the racially contentious [[O. J. Simpson murder case]] in 1995.

Key prosecution witness Detective [[Mark Fuhrman]], of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] – who denied using racist language on duty – impeached himself with his prolific use of ''nigger'' in tape recordings about his police work. The recordings, by screenplay writer Laura McKinney, were from a 1985 research session wherein the detective assisted her with a screenplay about LAPD policewomen. Fuhrman excused his use of the word saying he used ''nigger'' in the context of his "[[good cop/bad cop|bad cop]]" persona. Media personnel who reported on Fuhrman's testimony substituted ''the N-word'' for ''nigger''.

=== Homophones ===
{{lang|la|Niger}} (Latin for "black") occurs in Latinate [[scientific nomenclature]] and is the [[root word]] for some [[homophone]]s of ''nigger''; sellers of [[niger seed]] (used as bird feed), sometimes use the spelling ''Nyjer'' seed. The classical [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|Latin pronunciation]] {{IPA|/ˈniɡeɾ/}} sounds similar to the English {{IPA|/ˈnɪɡər/}}, occurring in biologic and [[anatomic]] names, such as ''[[Hyoscyamus niger]]'' (black henbane), and even for animals that are in fact not black, such as ''[[Sciurus niger]]'' (fox squirrel).

{{lang|la|Nigra}} is the Latin feminine form of {{lang|la|niger}} (black), used in biologic and anatomic names such as [[substantia nigra]] (black substance).

The word ''niggardly'' (miserly) is etymologically unrelated to ''nigger'', derived from the [[Old Norse]] word {{lang|non|nig}} (stingy) and the [[Middle English]] word {{lang|enm|nigon}}. In the US, this word [[controversies about the word "niggardly"|has been misinterpreted]] as related to ''nigger'' and taken as offensive. In January 1999, David Howard, a white Washington, D.C., city employee, was compelled to resign after using ''niggardly''—in a financial context—while speaking with black colleagues, who took umbrage. After reviewing the misunderstanding, Mayor [[Anthony A. Williams]] offered to reinstate Howard to his former position. Howard refused reinstatement but took a job elsewhere in the mayor's government.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/williams/williams020499.htm |title=D.C.

The [[denotation]]s of ''nigger'' also comprehend non-black/non-white and other disadvantaged people. Some of these terms are self-chosen, to identify with the oppression and resistance of black Americans; others are [[ethnic slur]]s used by outsiders.

[[Jerry Farber]]'s 1967 essay, ''[[The Student as Nigger]]'', used the word as a metaphor for what he saw as the role forced on students. Farber had been, at the time, frequently arrested as a civil rights activist while beginning his career as a literature professor.

In his 1968 autobiography ''[[White Niggers of America]]: The Precocious Autobiography of a Quebec "Terrorist'',''"'' [[Pierre Vallières]], a [[Front de libération du Québec]] leader, refers to the oppression of the [[Québécois (word)|Québécois people]] in North America.

In 1969, in the course of being interviewed by the British magazine ''[[Nova (UK magazine)|Nova]]'', artist [[Yoko Ono]] said "woman is the nigger of the world;" three years later, her husband, [[John Lennon]], published the song [[Woman Is the Nigger of the World|of the same name]]—about the worldwide phenomenon of discrimination against women—which was socially and politically controversial to US sensibilities.

''Sand nigger'', an ethnic slur against Arabs, and ''timber nigger'' and ''prairie nigger'', ethnic slurs against Native Americans, are examples of the racist extension of ''nigger'' upon other non-white peoples.<ref name="Kennedy">{{Cite journal |title=Who Can Say "Nigger"?

In 1978 singer [[Patti Smith]] used the word in "[[Rock N Roll Nigger]]."

In 1979 English singer [[Elvis Costello]] used the phrase ''[[white nigger]]'' in "[[Oliver's Army]]," a song describing the experiences of working-class soldiers in the British military forces on the "murder mile" (Belfast during [[The Troubles]]), where ''white nigger'' was a common [[List of religious slurs#Catholics|British pejorative for Irish Catholics]]. Later, the producers of the British talent show ''[[Stars in Their Eyes]]'' forced a contestant to [[censorship|censor]] one of its lines, changing "all it takes is one itchy trigger – One more widow, one less white nigger" to "one less white figure."

Historian [[Eugene Genovese]], noted for bringing a [[Marxist]] perspective to the study of power, class, and relations between planters and slaves in the South, uses the word pointedly in ''The World the Slaveholders Made'' (1988).
{{quote|quote=For reasons common to the slave condition all slave classes displayed a lack of industrial initiative and produced the famous Lazy Nigger, who under Russian serfdom and elsewhere was white.

=== Other languages ===
Other languages, particularly [[Romance languages]], have words that sound similar to ''nigger'' (are [[homophone]]s), but do not mean the same. Just because the words are [[cognate]], i.e. from the same Latin stem as [[#Etymology and history|explained above]], does not mean they have the same [[denotation]] (dictionary meaning) or [[connotation]] (emotional association). Whether a word is abusive, pejorative, neutral, affectionate, old-fashioned, etc. depends on its cultural context. How a word is used in English does not determine how a similar-sounding word is used in another language. Conversely, many languages have [[ethnic slur]]s that disparage "[[othering|other]]" people, i.e. words that serve a similar function to ''nigger'', but these usually stem from completely different roots.

Some examples of how other languages refer to a black person in a neutral and in a pejorative way include:

* {{lang-de|Neger}} is dated and now considered offensive. {{lang|de|Schwarze/-r}} ('black [person]') or {{lang|de|Farbige/-r}} ("colored [person]") is more neutral.
* {{lang-ht|nèg}} is used for any man in general, regardless of skin color (like ''[[dude]]'' in [[American English]]). Haitian Creole derives predominantly from French.

The first one is the most historically attested and was the most commonly used until the 1960s as an equivalent of the English word [[negro]]. It was gradually felt as offensive during the 1970s and replaced with {{lang|it|nero}} and {{lang|it|di colore}}. {{lang|it|Nero}} was considered a better translation of the English word ''black'', while {{lang|it|di colore}} is a [[calque|loan translation]] of the English word ''colored''.<ref>[http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/it/lingua-italiana/consulenza-linguistica/domande-risposte/nero-negro-colore Accademia della Crusca, ''Nero, negro e di colore'', 12 ottobre 2012 &#91;IT&#93;]</ref>

* In the [[Russian language]], {{lang|ru|негр}} ({{lang|ru-Latn|negr}}) is a common word for black people, an equivalent of ''negro''. {{lang|ru|Негритёнок}} ({{lang|ru-Latn|negrityonok}}) means a negro child. For example, the mystery novel ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' by [[Agatha Christie]], originally called ''Ten Little Niggers'', is known in Russia as {{lang|ru|Десять негритят|italic=yes}} ({{lang|ru-Latn|dyesyt' negrityat}}). In 16th and 17th centuries the word {{lang|ru|мавр}} ('[[moors|moor]]') was used to describe people with dark skin. A word {{lang|ru|чёрный}} ({{lang|ru-Latn|chyornyi}}, 'black') can be used as derogatory word for [[peoples of the Caucasus]] and, less often, black people.
