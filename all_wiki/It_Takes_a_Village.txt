'''''It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us''''' is a book published in 1996 by [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]]. In it, Clinton presents her vision for the children of America. She focuses on the impact individuals and groups outside the family have, for better or worse, on a child's well-being, and advocates a society which meets all of a child's needs.  The book was written with uncredited [[ghostwriter]] Barbara Feinman.

The book was republished as a Tenth Anniversary Edition in 2006 and saw publication as a [[picture book]] in 2017.

==History==
Publishers had approached Clinton since the spring of 1994 with the idea of writing a book, and announcement of the upcoming book came in April 1995 from the publisher she chose, [[Simon & Schuster]].<ref name="nyt-meet"/>
It came in the wake of the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993]], which she had led the effort for and which had suffered its final collapse in September 1994, and the book was seen by some observers as an effort to help reshape Clinton's image.<ref name="nyt-meet"/>  It was not unusual for a First Lady to write a book while still in office, with [[Barbara Bush]]'s children-aimed ''[[Millie's Book]]'' the most recent prior example.<ref name="nyt-meet"/> [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] was the first First Lady to write books while still in office, with the publication of "[[It's Up to the Women]]" in 1933, "[[This Troubled World]]" in 1938, and "[[The Moral Basis of Democracy]]" in 1940, among others.<ref>{{cite web|title=Books by Eleanor Roosevelt|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/abouteleanor/erbooks.cfm|website=The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project|publisher=George Washington University|accessdate=5 May 2018}}</ref> [[Carolyn Reidy]], head of Simon & Schuster's trade books division, said "We have all known that Hillary Rodham Clinton has devoted most of her career to issues of children. But outside of a handful of articles and speeches, her thoughts on these issues have not been available to everyone in an in an easily readable format. I think it will be an inspiring book."<ref name="nyt-meet"/>  The book was originally intended to come out in September 1995, but delays on the part of Clinton resulted in publication being delayed until January 1996.<ref name="nyt011496"/>

It was stated that Clinton would take no payments from the writing other than those to cover expenses, and that royalties from the book's sales would go to charity.<ref name="nyt-meet"/>

In January 1996, Clinton went on a ten-city book tour and made numerous television appearances to promote the book,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/17/style/chronicle-075248.html | title=Chronicle | author=Nadine Brozan | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 17, 1996 | accessdate=July 28, 2007}}</ref> although she was frequently hit with questions about her involvement in the [[Whitewater (controversy)|Whitewater]] and [[Travelgate]] controversies.<ref name="nyt011496">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/18/us/on-book-tour-first-lady-courts-public.html | title= On Book Tour, Mrs. Clinton Defends Herself | first=Doreen | last=Carvajal | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 14, 1996 | accessdate=July 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E5DA1139F934A25752C0A960958260 | title= With Resolve, First Lady Lays Out Defense | author=[[Todd S.

The theme of the book, at least as perceived from its title, aroused immediate opposition within the United States.  A well known instance of this occurred during the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 presidential election]] when, during his acceptance speech at the [[Republican National Convention]], Republican Party nominee [[Bob Dole]] said: "... with all due respect, I am here to tell you, it does not take a village to raise a child. It takes a family to raise a child."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/convention96/floor_speeches/bob_dole.html | title=Bob Dole's Acceptance Speech | publisher=[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|NewsHour]] | date=August 15, 1996 | accessdate=July 28, 2007}}</ref>  Criticism of Clinton's notion would continue to be made by American conservatives such as [[Rush Limbaugh]], [[Andrea Tantaros]], and [[Jonah Goldberg]] through the next two decades.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/06/18/conservatives_hate_it_takes_a_village_hillary_clinton_embraces_it_by_endorsing.html | title=Hillary Clinton Defies Right-Wing Critics, Endorses Universal Pre-K | author=Amanda Marcotte | magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=June 18, 2015}}</ref>

In 1997, Clinton received a [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album]] for her audio recording of the book.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vankin |first=Jonathan |url=http://heavy.com/news/2016/10/why-hillary-clinton-win-grammy-award-bill-clinton-presidents-who-won-barack-obama/ |title=Why Did Hillary Clinton Win a Grammy Award? |date=October 25, 2016 |work=Heavy |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}</ref>

In 2005, Senator [[Rick Santorum]] wrote a rebuttal to the book, ''[[It Takes a Family|It Takes a Family: Conservatism and the Common Good]]''.

==Synopsis==
The book emphasizes the shared responsibility that society has for successfully raising children, by looking at a number of angles as indicated in the chapter titles noted above. Clinton describes herself in the book as a Moderate, which is evidenced by a combination of advocating for government-driven social reforms while also espousing conservative values.

Clinton notes in the book many institutions responsible in some way for raising children, including: direct family, grandparents, neighbors, teachers, ministers, doctors, employers, politicians, nonprofits, faith communities, businesses, and international governmental groups.

Some of the goals and institutions that Clinton advocates for in the book include: the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]], the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]], [[Community policing|Community Policing]], the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]], [[AMBER Alert|Amber Alerts]], immunizations, [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], [[financial regulation]], expanded [[Child tax credit|Child Tax Credits]], [[Minimum wage law#United States|Minimum Wage]] increases, [[Universal health care]], personal responsibility, uniforms in schools, [[Goals 2000|Goals 2000 academic framework]], [[Parents Music Resource Center|music warning labels]], sexual abstinence, [[Levonorgestrel|Plan B contraception]], family planning, and marriage.

==Proverb question==
The book's title is attributed to an African proverb: "[[It takes a village to raise a child]]."  The saying and its attribution as an "African" proverb were in circulation before it was adopted by Clinton as the source for the title of her book. Indeed, the saying previously provided the source for the title of a children's book entitled ''It Takes a Village'' by Jane Cowen-Fletcher, published in 1994.<ref>{{cite book|title = It Takes a Village (Hardcover)|isbn = 978-0590465731|year = 1994|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780590465731}}</ref>

The authenticity of the proverb is debatable as there is no evidence that this precise proverb genuinely originated with any African culture.<ref name="hnet-thread"/> However, numerous proverbs from different cultures across Africa have been noted that convey similar sentiments in different ways.  As one poster on the scholarly list [[H-Net]] wrote,   "While it is interesting to seek provenance in regard to the proverb, 'It takes a village to raise a child,' I think it would be misleading to ascribe its origin to a single source.... Let me give a few examples of African societies with proverbs which translate to 'It takes a village...': In Lunyoro (Banyoro) there is a proverb that says 'Omwana takulila nju emoi,' whose literal translation is 'A child does not grow up only in a single home.' In Kihaya (Bahaya) there is a saying, 'Omwana taba womoi,' which translates as 'A child belongs not to one parent or home.' In Kijita (Wajita) there is a proverb which says 'Omwana ni wa bhone,' meaning regardless of a child's biological parent(s) its upbringing belongs to the community. In Swahili, the proverb 'Asiyefunzwa na mamae hufunzwa na ulimwengu' approximates to the same."<ref name="hnet-thread">From {{cite web | url=http://www.h-net.org/~africa/threads/village.html | title=Proverb: It Takes a Whole Village to Raise a Child | publisher=H-Africa (a member of H-Net's consortium of scholarly lists) | accessdate=December 1, 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610070450/http://www.h-net.org/%7Eafrica/threads/village.html | archivedate=June 10, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> <!-- Clinton still stands behind the title of her book as being taken from an actual African phrase.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} --> 

In 2016, [[NPR]] decided to research the origins of the proverb, and concluded it was unable to pinpoint its origins, but agreed with the H-Net discussion regarding it holding the true spirits of some African cultures.<ref name="npr">{{cite web

And in the end, the answer might be: We just don't know."<ref name="npr"/>

==Ghostwriter controversy==
Clinton has been criticized for not giving credit to a [[ghostwriter]] in connection with ''It Takes a Village''.  The majority of the book was reportedly written by ghostwriter Barbara Feinman.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=833&id=623352003 | newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] | date=June 5, 2003 | author=Tim Cornwell | title=I wanted to wring the President's neck | accessdate=December 2, 2007}}</ref> When the book was first announced in April 1995, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported publisher [[Simon & Schuster]] as saying "The book will actually be written by Barbara Feinman, a journalism professor at Georgetown University in Washington. Ms. Feinman will conduct a series of interviews with Mrs. Clinton, who will help edit the resulting text."<ref name="nyt-meet">{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DD1E31F931A15757C0A963958260 | title= Meet Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Traditional First Lady | author=Mary B. W. Tabor | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 22, 1995 | accessdate=November 2, 2007}}</ref>

Feinman spent seven months on the project and was paid $120,000 for her work.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2003/0707/096.html | magazine=[[Forbes magazine|Forbes]] | title=Under Cover | author=Tomas Kellner | date=July 7, 2003 | accessdate=December 2, 2007}}</ref> Feinman, however, was not mentioned anywhere in the book.  Clinton's acknowledgment section began:  "It takes a village to bring a book into the world, as everyone who has written one knows. Many people have helped me to complete this one, sometimes without even knowing it. They are so numerous that I will not even attempt to acknowledge them individually, for fear that I might leave one out."<ref>''It Takes a Village'', p. 319.</ref>  During her promotional tour for the book, Clinton said, "I actually wrote the book ... I had to write my own book because I want to stand by every word."<ref name="nyt011496"/>  Clinton stated that Feinman assisted in interviews and did some editorial drafting of "connecting paragraphs", while Clinton herself wrote the final manuscript in longhand.<ref name="nyt011496"/>

This led Feinman to complain at the time to ''[[Capitol Style]]'' magazine over the lack of acknowledgement.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/other/1999/9906.ww.html | magazine=[[The Washington Monthly]] | date=June 1999 | volume=31 | issue=6 | author=Susan Threadgill | title=Who's Who | accessdate=December 2, 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610053832/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/other/1999/9906.ww.html | archivedate=June 10, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> 
In 2001, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that "New York literary circles are buzzing with vitriol over Sen. Clinton's refusal, so far, to share credit with any writer who helps on her book."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/wsj/?id=90000397 | newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] Editorial Page | date=April 7, 2001 | author=[[Al Hunt]] | title=A Tale of Two Clintons  | accessdate=December 2, 2007}}</ref>
Later, in a 2002 article for ''[[The Writer's Chronicle]]'',<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.awpwriter.org/magazine/writers/btodd01.htm | author=Barbara Feinman Todd | title=Ghost Writing | magazine=[[The Writer's Chronicle]] | date=September 2002 | accessdate=December 2, 2007}}</ref> Barbara Feinman Todd (now using her married name) related that the project with Clinton had gone smoothly, producing drafts in a [[Round-robin story|round-robin]] style. Feinman agrees that Clinton was involved with the project, but also states that, "Like any first lady, Mrs. Clinton had an extremely hectic schedule and writing a book without assistance would have been logistically impossible." Feinman reiterates that her only objection to the whole process was the lack of any acknowledgement. A 2005 [[Georgetown University]] web page bio for Barbara Feinman Todd states that ''It Takes a Village'' was one of "several high-profile books" that she has "assisted, as editor, writer and researcher."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cpd.georgetown.edu/Faculty/Todd.html  | title=Barbara Feinman Todd, M.A. | publisher=[[Georgetown University]] | date=February 14, 2005 | accessdate=December 2, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050214034918/http://cpd.georgetown.edu/Faculty/Todd.html |archivedate = February 14, 2005}}</ref>  Feinman Todd wrote more about the collaboration in her 2017 memoir ''Pretend I'm Not Here''.<ref>{{cite web

==Tenth anniversary edition==
In 2006, ''It Takes a Village'' was republished as a 10th Anniversary Edition with a new cover design and a new Introduction by the author that reflected on the continued meaning of the book in the [[Internet era]] and following the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]].  It also includes a new Notes section at the end that provides updates for scholarly studies that had been conducted in the intervening ten years.  The role of Feinman remains unmentioned.

Clinton did not shy away from the book's conclusions during her post-First Lady political career.  As part of her [[Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|own presidential campaign during 2007]] she said "I still believe it takes a village to raise a child."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/politics/story/B74DF4EFC84F04E086257326000425CE | title=Democrats embrace League's 10-point plan, promise change | newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] | date=July 28, 2007 | accessdate=July 28, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  And in [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|her second presidential campaign during 2015]] she said "Fundamentally, [Republicans] reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy. It takes an inclusive society. What I once called 'a village' that has a place for everyone."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://time.com/3920332/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch/ | title=Transcript: Read the Full Text of Hillary Clinton's Campaign Launch Speech | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=June 13, 2015}}</ref>

The year 2017 saw public efforts under way to render ''It Takes'' as a [[picture book]], an announcement that was made in February 2017.<ref name="india">{{cite news | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hillary-clintons-it-takes-a-village-repackaged-for-kids/articleshow/57062942.cms | title=Hillary Clinton's 'It Takes a Village' repackaged for kids | agency=[[Press Trust of India]] | newspaper=[[The Times of India]] | date=February 9, 2017 | accessdate=April 21, 2018}}</ref>  It was also announced that [[Marla Frazee]], a two-time winner of the [[Caldecott Medal]], would be the illustrator for the picture book; Frazee said in a statement, "I am deeply honored to help bring Hillary Clinton's life's work and devotion to public service, which has inspired me and millions of others, to children and those who love them."<ref name="india"/>  As with the original book, any net proceeds from the picture book would go to charity.<ref name="india"/>

In fact Clinton had entertained the notion of doing this for a number of years, and worked on it with Frazee during [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|her 2016 presidential election campaign]].<ref name="wapo-picture-book"/>  The result was published on September 12, 2017, also the same day of publication as that for her account of her devastating loss in that election, ''[[What Happened (Clinton book)|What Happened]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/27/hillary-clinton-new-book-what-happened-241024 | title=Hillary Clinton to open up about the 2016 election in new book titled 'What Happened' | first=Diamond Naga | last=Siu | work=[[Politico]] | date=July 27, 2017 | accessdate=July 27, 2017}}</ref><ref name="wapo-picture-book"/>

The book is aimed at [[preschool|preschool-aged children]], although a few messages are more likely understood by adults, and contains some 117 words.<ref name="wapo-picture-book"/>  ''[[The Washington Post]]'' characterized the work thusly: "It captures perfectly Clinton's vision of a multicultural America working toward a constructive goal.

A review of the book in the industry publication ''[[Shelf Awareness]]'' said that the picture book took a somewhat different perspective from the original, focusing more on the actions of children than of adults.<ref name="shelf"/>  The review especially praised the art work, saying that "As with all of her works, Frazee's illustrations explode with life ...
