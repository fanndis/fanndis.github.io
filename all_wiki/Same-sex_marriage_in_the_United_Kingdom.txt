===Legal history===
In [[common law]], a marriage between persons of the same-sex was [[Void (law)|void ''ab initio'']]. In 1680, [[Arabella Hunt]] married "James Howard"; in 1682 the marriage was annulled on the ground that Howard was in fact Amy Poulter, a 'perfect woman in all her parts', and two women could not validly marry.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mendelson|first=Sara H. |title=Hunt, Arabella (1662–1705)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14190|access-date=14 March 2012|series=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|date=Jan 2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref> In 1866, in ''[[Hyde v. Hyde]] and Woodmansee'' (a case of [[polygamy]]), [[James Wilde, 1st Baron Penzance|Lord Penzance]]'s judgment began "Marriage as understood in [[Christendom]] is the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniset.ca/other/ths/LR1PD130.html|title=Hyde v.

In ''Talbot (otherwise Poyntz) v. Talbot'' in 1967, the prohibition was held to extend where one spouse was a [[Sex reassignment therapy|post-operative]] [[transsexual]], with Mr [[Justice Ormerod]] stating "Marriage is a relationship which depends on sex, not on gender".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brent|first=Gail|date=1972–1973|title=Some Legal Problems of the Postoperative Transsexual|journal=Journal of Family Law|volume=12|page=405}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1971/apr/02/grounds-on-which-a-marriage-is-void#column_1829 |title=HC Deb 02 April 1971 vol 814 c.1829 |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=2 April 1971 |access-date=29 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314035427/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1971/apr/02/grounds-on-which-a-marriage-is-void|archive-date=14 March 2016}}</ref> In 1971, the ''[[Nullity of Marriage Act 1971|Nullity of Marriage Act]]'' was passed, explicitly banning marriages between [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] in [[England and Wales]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cretney|first=Stephen|title=Family law in the twentieth century: a history|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|pages=70–71|isbn=0-19-826899-8}}</ref> The parliamentary debates on the 1971 act included discussion on the issue of transsexualism but not homosexuality.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Report on Nullity of Marriage|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/Reports/rNullity.pdf#page=10|series=Law Reform Commission Reports|volume=9|date=October 1984|publisher=[[Law Reform Commission (Ireland)|Law Reform Commission]]|location=Ireland|pages=4–8|chapter=1 (a) Marriages between persons of the same sex|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310025806/http://lawreform.ie/_fileupload/reports/rnullity.pdf#page=10|archive-date=10 March 2016}}</ref>

The 1971 act was later replaced by the ''[[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]]'', which also declared that a marriage was void if the parties were not respectively male and female.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/18/section/11 |title=Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |access-date=4 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107164402/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/18/section/11|archive-date=7 January 2016|at=Section 11(c)}}</ref> Prohibition of same-sex marriages was also included in the marriage legislation of [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

The ''Marriage Act (Scotland) 1977'' had a similar legal impediment, but following the passage of the ''Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014'', the act no longer prohibits marriages if both parties are of the same sex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1977/cukpga_19770015_en_1#pt3-l1g5|title=Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977 (c.15)|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]|access-date=31 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918095332/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/15|archive-date=18 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/2003/413/article/6/made|title=The Marriage (Northern Ireland) Order 2003|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information|access-date=29 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329204011/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/2003/413/article/6/made|archive-date=29 March 2016}}</ref>

On 26 August 2003, Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson, both British university professors, [[Same-sex marriage in British Columbia|legally married]] in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. However, on their return their marriage was not recognised under British law. Under the subsequent ''Civil Partnership Act'', it was instead converted into a civil partnership. The couple sued for recognition of their marriage, arguing that it was legal in the country in which it was executed and met the requirements for recognition of overseas marriages and should thus be treated in the same way as one between opposite-sex couples. They rejected the conversion of their marriage into a civil partnership believing it to be both practically and symbolically a lesser substitute. They were represented by the civil rights group [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]]. The group's legal director James Welch said it was a matter of fairness and equality for the couple's marriage to be recognised and that they "shouldn't have to settle for the second-best option of a civil partnership".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news-and-events/1-press-releases/2005/kitzinger-and-wilkinson.shtml |title=Couple challenge UK stance on Gay Marriage |date=11 August 2005 |publisher=Liberty |access-date=7 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905183605/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news-and-events/1-press-releases/2005/kitzinger-and-wilkinson.shtml |archive-date=5 September 2008}}</ref>

The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] announced its judgement on 31 July 2006, ruling that their union would not be granted marriage status and would continue to be recognised in England and Wales as a civil partnership. The president of the Family Division, Sir [[Mark Potter (judge)|Mark Potter]], gave as his reason that "abiding single sex relationships are in no way inferior, nor does English Law suggest that they are by according them recognition under the name of civil partnership", and that marriage was an "age-old institution" which, he suggested, was by "longstanding definition and acceptance" a relationship between a man and a woman.<ref name="BBCNews5230708">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5230708.stm|title=Lesbians lose legal marriage bid|date=31 July 2006|work=BBC News|access-date=11 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308020049/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5230708.stm|archive-date=8 March 2016}}</ref><ref name="murphy2006">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aPqZcFT_RYz8&refer=home|title=British Lesbians Lose Bid to Validate Their Marriage|last=Murphy|first=Megan|date=31 July 2006|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |access-date=30 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026010254/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aPqZcFT_RYz8&refer=home|archive-date=26 October 2012}}</ref> He agreed with the couple's claim that they were being discriminated against by the ''[[Civil Partnership Act 2004]]'', but considered that "To the extent that by reason of that distinction it discriminates against same-sex partners, such discrimination has a legitimate aim, is reasonable and proportionate, and falls within the margin of appreciation accorded to Convention States."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2006/2022.html|title=Wilkinson v Kitzinger & Ors &#91;2006&#93; EWHC 2022 (Fam) (31 July 2006), paragraph 122|publisher=BAILII|access-date=30 March 2016}}</ref> [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Peter Goldsmith]], as second respondent, sought £25,000 in legal costs from the couple, which the High Court ordered them to pay.<ref name=ukgaynews2006>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/Archive/2006july/3101.htm|title=High Court Judge Endorses the 'Sexual Apartheid' of Same-Sex Marriage Ban|date=31 July 2006|publisher=UK Gay News|access-date=16 September 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305173355/http://ukgaynews.org.uk/archive/2006july/3101.htm|archive-date=5 March 2016}}</ref>

Wilkinson and Kitzinger said they were "deeply disappointed" with the judgement, not just for themselves, but for "lesbian and gay families across the nation".<ref name="murphy2006"/> They said that "denying our marriage does nothing to protect heterosexual marriage, it simply upholds discrimination and inequality" and also said that the ruling insulted [[LGBT]] people and treats their relationships as inferior to heterosexual ones; not worthy of marriage but only of an "expressly different, and entirely separate institution".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1525304/Lesbians-lose-battle-to-have-marriage-recognised.html|title=Lesbians lose battle to have marriage recognised|last=Rozenberg|first=Joshua|date=1 August 2006|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=30 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107164402/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1525304/Lesbians-lose-battle-to-have-marriage-recognised.html |archive-date=7 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equalmarriagerights.org/LGPR_3to11.PDF|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Sue|last2=Kitzinger|first2=Celia |title=Editorial|year=2007|work=Lesbian & Gay Psychology Review, Vol. 8, No. 1|publisher=equalmarriagerights.org|access-date=30 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305111214/http://equalmarriagerights.org/lgpr_3to11.pdf|archive-date=5 March 2016}}</ref> They said, however, that they believed the judgement "won't stand the test of time" and that they looked forward to the day when "there is full equality in marriage".<ref name="BBCNews5230708"/> They had originally announced their intention to appeal the decision but later abandoned it due to lack of funds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2006/10/11/lesbian-couple-drop-marriage-appeal/|title=Lesbian couple drop marriage appeal|last=Shoffman|first=Marc|date=11 October 2006|publisher=[[PinkNews]] |access-date=3 September 2009|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063040/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2006/10/11/lesbian-couple-drop-marriage-appeal/|archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref>

Gay rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]] said that the establishment's aggressive opposition to same-sex marriage and the successful demand of £25,000 from the couple damaged the Government's "gay-friendly credentials".

The first major campaign against same-sex marriage in Britain was Scotland for Marriage established in 2011, followed by the [[Coalition for Marriage]] in England and Wales in 2012. Subsequent campaigns for and against same-sex marriage have been established by a wide variety of organisations, including the [[Coalition for Equal Marriage]] and [[Out4Marriage]], both established in England in 2012. In Northern Ireland, a campaign for full same-sex marriage was established by LGBT rights activist and political campaigner Gary Spedding in June 2012 with the specific goal of challenging social attitudes whilst lobbying the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to enact legislation to update the ''Marriage Order (Northern Ireland) 2003''.

He said, the "best and most universally recognised system of partnership" is civil marriage and, "anything less is second class and discrimination".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2009/05/22/green-party-calls-for-eu-wide-gay-marriage/|title=Green Party calls for EU-wide gay marriage|date=22 May 2009|publisher=PinkNews|access-date=31 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209130847/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2009/05/22/green-party-calls-for-eu-wide-gay-marriage/|archive-date=9 December 2013}}</ref>

===Religious bodies===

Under the law at that time, registrars were not allowed to legally officiate at a marriage between same-sex couples but the Quakers stated that the law did not preclude them from "playing a central role in the celebration and recording of same-sex marriages" and asked the government to change the law so that these marriages would be recognised.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8177536.stm|title=Quakers 'to allow gay marriages'|date=30 July 2009|work=BBC News|access-date=28 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306181037/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8177536.stm|archive-date=6 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/article2100650.ece |title=Quakers back gay marriage and call for reform |last=Gledhill |first=Ruth |date=1 August 2009 |work=[[The Times]] |access-date=7 August 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6gO19SIRp?url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/article2100650.ece |archive-date=30 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In a joint press release in 2012, the Quakers, [[Liberal Judaism (UK)|Liberal Judaism]], and [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|Unitarians]] gave their endorsement to the same-sex marriage consultation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.quaker.org.uk/news/quakers-liberal-judaism-and-unitarians-welcome-equal-marriage-consultation|title=Quakers, Liberal Judaism and Unitarians welcome equal marriage consultation|date=15 March 2012|access-date=5 February 2013|publisher=[[Britain Yearly Meeting]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227182826/http://www.quaker.org.uk/news/quakers-liberal-judaism-and-unitarians-welcome-equal-marriage-consultation|archive-date=27 December 2014}}</ref>

===Public opinion===
{{Same-sex marriage map Europe|align=right|size=300px}}
Opinion polls have shown general support for same-sex marriage among Britons. Attitudes towards homosexuality amongst the British public have become more tolerant over time; according to the [[British Social Attitudes Survey]], in 1983 approximately 50% to 70% of respondents of the three major political parties (Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat) regarded homosexuality as "always wrong" or "mostly wrong" and in 1993 opposition to homosexuality was reported to have slightly increased amongst all parties. However, by 2003 attitudes had become more tolerant, with 25% to 50% of respondents regarding homosexuality as always or mostly wrong and by 2013, only around 20% to 35% of respondents in each party felt the same way. Liberal Democrat respondents tended to be less likely to regard homosexuality as wrong than Labour or Conservative respondents across each survey.<ref>''British Social Attitudes'', [http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-30/personal-relationships/homosexuality.aspx Homosexuality], 2013, ''NatCen''</ref>

On 17 September 2011, at the Liberal Democrat party conference, [[Lynne Featherstone]] announced that Her Majesty's Government would launch a consultation in March 2012 on how to implement equal civil marriage for same-sex couples with the intention of any legislative changes being made by the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|next general election]].<ref name="pinknews1">{{cite web|last=Geen |first=Jessica |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/09/16/government-proposes-introduction-of-full-gay-marriage-after-cameron-intervention/ |title=Government proposes introducing gay marriage after Cameron intervention |work=PinkNews|access-date=29 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060136/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/09/16/government-proposes-introduction-of-full-gay-marriage-after-cameron-intervention/|archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref> The Prime Minister's Office let it be known that [[David Cameron]] had personally intervened in favour of legalising same-sex unions, and on 5 October 2011 the Conservative Party Conference applauded Cameron's support for same-sex marriage in his Leader's Speech.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/clegg-we-will-defy-antigay-marriage-rebellion-6291120.html|title=Clegg: We will defy anti-gay marriage rebellion|work=The Independent|first=Andrew|last= Grice|date=18 January 2012|access-date=31 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330233626/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/clegg-we-will-defy-anti-gay-marriage-rebellion-6291120.html|archive-date=30 March 2016}}</ref>

On 12 March 2012, the Government of the United Kingdom launched the consultation on equal civil marriage in England and Wales. The government proposals were:

* to enable same-sex couples to have a civil marriage i.e., only civil ceremonies in a register office or approved premises (like a hotel);
* to make no changes to religious marriages. This would continue only to be legally possible between a man and a woman;
* to retain civil partnerships for same-sex couples and allow couples already in a civil partnership to convert this into a marriage;
* to continue to permit civil partnership registrations on religious premises as is possible, i.e., on a voluntary basis for faith groups and with no religious content; and
* to allow individuals to be able legally to change their gender without having to end their marriage.

The following political and media organisations expressed their support for same-sex marriage legislation in England and Wales:

* ensuring the legislation states explicitly that no religious organisation, or individual minister, can be compelled to marry same-sex couples or to permit this to happen on their premises;
* providing an 'opt-in' system for religious organisations who wish to conduct marriages for same-sex couples, which also allows individual ministers to continue to refuse to perform same-sex marriage even when their religious organisation opts in;
* amending the ''[[Equality Act 2010]]'' to reflect that no discrimination claims can be brought against religious organisations or individual ministers for refusing to marry a same-sex couple or allowing their premises to be used for this purpose; and
* ensuring that the legislation will not affect the Canon law of the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church in Wales]], i.e., unless Canon law and the same-sex marriage legislation are changed in future, both churches will be legally barred from performing same-sex marriages.<ref name="consultation" />

The UK Government addressed consultation responses about the possibility that the [[European Court of Human Rights]] could force all churches to marry same-sex couples, stating: {{quote|text=Both the case law of the European Court of Human Rights and the rights enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights put the protection of religious belief in this matter beyond doubt. We will draft the legislation to ensure that there is a negligible chance of a successful legal challenge in any domestic court, or the ECtHR that would force any religious organisation to conduct marriages for same-sex couples against their will. Any possible claims would be brought against the Government, rather than an organisation to ensure religious organisations would not have to use their resources to fight any legal challenges.|sign=Equal marriage:

===History===
Legislation to allow for the recognition of same-sex marriages in Northern Ireland has been debated in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Assembly]] five times since 2012. On four of those occasions, only a minority of assembly members voted in favour of same-sex marriage, though the most recent vote on the issue in November 2015 saw a majority of MLAs vote in favour of same-sex marriage.<ref name="november2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/northern-ireland-mlas-vote-yes-for-gay-marriage-but-motion-is-torpedoed-by-dup-veto-34160017.html |title=Northern Ireland MLA's vote 'yes' for gay marriage – but motion is torpedoed by DUP |work=Belfast Telegraph |first=Noel |last=McAdam |date=2 November 2015 |access-date=31 March 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6gPWQKoHk?url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/northern-ireland-mlas-vote-yes-for-gay-marriage-but-motion-is-torpedoed-by-dup-veto-34160017.html |archive-date=31 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On 27 April 2015, the Northern Ireland Assembly voted for the fourth time on the recognition of same-sex marriage. The motion for recognition was introduced by [[Sinn Féin]] and was defeated by a majority of 49 votes to 47; all [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] members in the Assembly voted against it, while all Sinn Féin, [[Green Party in Northern Ireland|Green Party]] and [[NI21]] members voted for it.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/04/27/northern-ireland-assembly-rejects-same-sex-marriage/ |date= 27 April 2015 |title=Northern Ireland Assembly rejects same-sex marriage |access-date=23 May 2015 |work=[[PinkNews]]|first=Naith |last=Payton |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313050841/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/04/27/northern-ireland-assembly-rejects-same-sex-marriage/|archive-date=13 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/assembly-rejects-motion-on-same-sex-marriage-again-1.2190933 |title=Assembly rejects motion on same-sex marriage again |work=[[The Irish Times]]|first=Gerry|last=Moriarty|date=27 April 2015|access-date=27 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102936/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/assembly-rejects-motion-on-same-sex-marriage-again-1.2190933|archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref>

On 1 November 2018, [[royal assent]] was granted to the ''Northern Ireland (Executive Formation and Exercise of Functions) Act 2018'', which contained sections describing Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage and [[abortion]] bans as human rights violations. The law did not legalise same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, but directed the British Government to "issue guidance" to civil servants in Northern Ireland "in relation to the incompatibility of human rights with [the region's laws on the two issues]".

====Legalisation by Westminster (2019)====
In July 2019, McGinn announced his intention to attach an amendment to an upcoming administrative bill relating to Northern Ireland, which would legalise same-sex marriage three months after passage of the bill if the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] remained suspended.

==Religious performance==
Most major religious organisations in the United Kingdom do not perform same-sex marriages in their places of worship. Some smaller Christian denominations such as the [[Dutch Church, Austin Friars|Dutch Church in London]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchchurch.org.uk/page/13/?option=com_content&view=article&id=378%3Ajuli-2010&Itemid=71 |title=Nederlandse Kerk: Gay marriage |publisher=Dutchchurch.org.uk |access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref> [[Quakers]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] do perform same-sex marriages. In addition, [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]] and the [[Movement for Reform Judaism]] perform same-sex marriages, and campaigned in favour of same-sex marriage legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/03/07/reform-judaism-backs-gay-marriage/|title=Reform Judaism backs gay marriage}}</ref>

In May 2016, the Oasis Church Waterloo in London applied for a licence that would allow it to conduct same-sex marriages. Pastor [[Steve Chalke]] said "Oasis Church in Waterloo has reached the decision. It's taken us some time to reach it, that this is something we want to do".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christiantoday.com/article/pastor.steve.chalke.of.oasis.church.applies.for.licence.to.minister.to.same.sex.marriages/85750.htm |title=Pastor Steve Chalke of Oasis Church applies for licence to minister to same-sex marriages |publisher=Christiantoday.com |date=2016-05-11 |access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref>

In June 2016, the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] became the first British province in the [[Anglican Communion]] to take steps to allow same-sex marriages to be performed in their churches. The General Synod voted in favour of a motion to begin discussion amongst the seven dioceses to remove the doctrinal clause which stated that marriage was between a man and a woman. The vote received support from five of seven bishops, 69% of the clergy and 80% of the laity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-36498967|title=Scottish Episcopal Church takes gay marriage step|date=10 June 2016|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> The General Synod formally approved the change to the doctrinal clause in June 2017, removing language stating that marriages could only be between a man and a woman and introducing a new conscience clause which allows clergy to opt out of performing same-sex weddings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/08/scottish-episcopal-church-votes-to-allow-same-sex-weddings|date=8 June 2017|work=Guardian|title=Scottish Episcopal church votes to allow same-sex weddings}}</ref> On 20 July 2017, it was announced that a same-sex wedding was to be held in [[St Mary's Cathedral, Glasgow]], later in the summer.<ref name="Perraudin 2017">{{cite web | last=Perraudin | first=Frances | title=First same-sex marriage at Anglican church in UK to be held this summer | website=the Guardian | date=20 July 2017 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/20/first-same-sex-marriage-anglican-church-uk-glasgow | access-date=27 July 2017}}</ref> On 1 August 2017, a same-sex marriage, which included the [[Eucharist]] as a nuptial mass, was held at the [[Church of St John the Evangelist, Edinburgh]].

In July 2016, the [[United Reformed Church]] voted overwhelmingly to allow its churches to perform same-sex marriages.

The motion was passed by the Church's general assembly by a vote of 345 to 170. The legal questions committee now has two years before it has to report back, with a final vote on the motion expected in 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/19/church-of-scotland-same-sex-marriage-draft-laws|title=Church of Scotland to draft new same-sex marriage laws|work=The Guardian|date=20 May 2018}}</ref>
