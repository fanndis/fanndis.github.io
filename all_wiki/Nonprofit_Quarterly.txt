'''''The Nonprofit Quarterly''''', also known as '''''NPQ''''', is a nonprofit magazine publication which provides research-based articles and resources to educate the [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] sector. The publication focuses on management, [[fundraising]] practices, [[philanthropy]], and governance/board management.

The ''Quarterly'' was originally founded, published and edited by David Garvey<ref>[https://dpp.uconn.edu/person/david-garvey/ David Garvey]</ref> in 1994, as the ''New England Nonprofit Quarterly'', as a regional learning magazine for [[New England]] nonprofit practitioners.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-06-16|title=Our History|url=https://www.tsne.org/our-history|access-date=2020-06-20|website=TSNE MissionWorks|language=en}}</ref> The ''Nonprofit Quarterly'' launched as a national [[Print journalism|print journal]] in the winter of 1999, and now also publishes daily content online.
