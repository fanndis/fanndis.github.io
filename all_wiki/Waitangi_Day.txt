'''Waitangi Day''' ({{lang-mi|Te Rā o Waitangi}}), the [[national day]] of [[New Zealand]], marks the anniversary of the initial signing  – on 6 February 1840 – of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which is regarded as the founding document of the nation. The first Waitangi Day was not celebrated until 1934, and it was made a national [[Public holidays in New Zealand|public holiday]] in 1974.

In present-day New Zealand, the anniversary is observed annually on 6 February and the day is usually recognised as a public holiday (unless the date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, when the Monday that immediately follows becomes the public holiday).<ref name="newshub_ph">{{Cite news |url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/syspages/--headline--.html |title= Extra public holidays voted in |date= 17 April 2013 |work= Newshub |accessdate= 6 February 2018 |language= en}}</ref> Ceremonies take place at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]] and elsewhere to commemorate the signing of the treaty. A variety of events are staged, including parties, [[Māori people|Māori]] [[Hui (Māori assembly)|hui]] (social gatherings), reflections on [[History of New Zealand|New Zealand history]], official awards and citizenship ceremonies. The commemoration has also been the focus of protest by [[Māori protest movement|Māori activists]], and is often marred by controversy.

==History==
[[File:Treaty House at Waitangi Treaty Grounds.jpg|thumb|[[Treaty House]] and grounds at Waitangi, where the treaty was first signed. The first Waitangi Day was celebrated in the grounds on 6 February 1934.]]
The [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was first signed on 6 February 1840 on the grounds of [[James Busby]]'s house—now known as [[Treaty House]]—at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]], in the [[Bay of Islands]]. The treaty was signed by representatives acting on behalf of the British [[The Crown|Crown]] and, initially, about 45 [[Māori people|Māori]] chiefs.<ref name="colenso">{{cite book |title=The Authentic and Genuine History of the Signing of the Treaty of Waitangi |last=Colenso |first=William |authorlink=William Colenso |year=1890 |publisher=By Authority of George Didsbury, Government Printer |location=Wellington |url=http://www.waitangi.com/colenso/colhis1.html |accessdate=1 July 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816123405/http://www.waitangi.com/colenso/colhis1.html |archivedate=16 August 2011  }}</ref> Over the course of the next seven months, copies of the treaty were toured around the country to give other chiefs the opportunity to sign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/treaty-of-waitangi/page-1|accessdate=19 February 2016|title=Creating the Treaty of Waitangi|work=Te Ara – The Encyclopedia of New Zealand}}</ref> The signing had the effect of securing British sovereignty over the islands of New Zealand, which was officially proclaimed on 21 May 1840.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/the-treaty-in-brief|accessdate=10 February 2017|title=The Treaty in brief – Introduction|publisher=New Zealand History – nzhistory.govt.nz}}</ref>

===Previous celebrations===
Prior to 1934, most celebrations of New Zealand's [[Colony of New Zealand|founding as a colony]] were held on 29 January, the date on which [[William Hobson]] arrived in the Bay of Islands to issue the proclamation of his appointment, which had been prepared by colonial office officials in England. Hobson had no draft treaty. From the British perspective the proclamation was the key legal document, "what the treaty said was less important".<ref>Before Hobson.pp 159–260 T. Simpson. Blythswood Press.2015.</ref>

In 1932, [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] [[Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe|Lord Bledisloe]] and his wife purchased and presented to the nation the run-down house of James Busby, where the treaty was initially signed. They subsequently donated {{GBP|500}} to restore the building. The Treaty House and grounds were made a public reserve, which was dedicated on 6 February 1934.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/4b39/bledisloe-charles-bathurst|accessdate=8 February 2017|title=Story: Bledisloe, Charles Bathurst|work=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand}}</ref> This event is considered to be the first Waitangi Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day|accessdate=9 February 2017|title=Waitangi Day – Introduction|publisher=New Zealand History – nzhistory.govt.nz}}</ref>

In 1940, another event was held at the grounds, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the treaty signing. The event was a success and helped raise the profile of the treaty and its day of observance in the national consciousness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day/waitangi-day-1940s-50s|accessdate=8 February 2017|title=Waitangi Day 1940s–1950s|publisher=New Zealand History – nzhistory.govt.nz}}</ref>

===Annual commemorations===
Annual commemorations of the treaty signing began in 1947. The 1947 event was a [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] ceremony centring on a flagpole which the Navy had paid to erect in the grounds. The ceremony was brief and featured no Māori. The following year, a Māori speaker was added to the line-up, and subsequent additions to the ceremony were made nearly every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11583909|accessdate=8 February 2017|title=A brief history of Waitangi Day|date=5 February 2016|work=The New Zealand Herald}}</ref> From 1952, the governor-general attended, and from 1958 the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]] also attended, although not every year. From the mid-1950s, a Māori cultural performance was usually given as part of the ceremony. Many of these early features remain a part of Waitangi Day ceremonies, including a naval salute,<ref name=NZDF>{{Cite press release|title=Navy to Have Large Presence at Waitangi|date=1 February 2018|publisher=New Zealand Defence Force|location=Wellington, New Zealand|url=http://www.nzdf.mil.nz/news/media-releases/2018/20180201-navy-to-have-large-presence-at-waitangi.htm|quote=The first part of the ceremony will be performed by the RNZN Band, while the Royal Guard of Honour marches into position.

A bugler will play Sunset over the evening hymn, during which time the New Zealand White Ensign will be lowered.}}</ref> the Māori cultural performance (now usually a ''[[pōwhiri]]'', a ceremonial welcome), and speeches from a range of Māori and [[Pākehā]] dignitaries.<ref>{{cite news |title=Politicians address iwi, hapū and whānau at the treaty grounds at Waitangi |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/408802/politicians-address-iwi-hapu-and-whanau-at-the-treaty-grounds-at-waitangi |accessdate=27 April 2020 |work=[[RNZ]] |date=4 February 2020 |language=en-nz}}</ref>

===Proposed as public holiday===
The [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] stated in its 1957 election [[manifesto]] that it would make Waitangi Day a public holiday. After winning that year's election, the party said that the country [[Black Budget (New Zealand)|could not afford]] another public holiday. The [[Waitangi Day Act]] of 1960 allowed localities to transfer the holiday from their existing regional public holiday to Waitangi Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/the-1960s/1961-key-events|accessdate=8 February 2017|title=The 1960s – key events|publisher=New Zealand History – nzhistory.govt.nz}}</ref>

In 1963, after a change of government, the passing of the Waitangi Day Amendment Act transferred the holiday observed in [[Northland Region|Northland]] on [[Auckland Anniversary Day]] (the Monday closest to 29 January) to Waitangi Day, 6 February. This made Waitangi Day a holiday in Northland only.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day/waitangi-day-1960s|accessdate=8 February 2017|title=Waitangi Day – Waitangi Day 1960s|publisher=New Zealand History – nzhistory.govt.nz}}</ref>

===Transition to public holiday<!--'New Zealand Day' redirects here-->===
[[File:Waitangi Day 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|Norman Kirk and a Māori boy on Waitangi Day, 1973]]
Waitangi Day became a nationwide public holiday on its observance in 1974 by first undergoing a name change. In 1971 the Labour [[shadow minister]] of [[Minister of Māori Affairs|Māori Affairs]], [[Matiu Rata]], introduced a [[private member's bill]] to make Waitangi Day a national holiday, to be called '''New Zealand Day'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->. This was not passed into law.<ref name="Waitangi Day 1970s">{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day/waitangi-day-1970s|accessdate=9 February 2017|title=Waitangi Day 1970s|publisher=New Zealand History – nzhistory.govt.nz}}</ref>

After the 1972 election of the [[Third Labour Government of New Zealand|third Labour government]] under Prime Minister [[Norman Kirk]], it was announced that from 1974, Waitangi Day would be a national holiday known as New Zealand Day.<ref name=NZoS73>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzonscreen.com/title/new-zealand-day-at-waitangi-1974|title=New Zealand Day at Waitangi {{!}} Television {{!}} NZ On Screen|website=www.nzonscreen.com|language=en|others=NZ On Screen|access-date=20 March 2018}}</ref> The [[New Zealand Day Act]] legislation was passed in 1973.<ref name="Waitangi Day 1970s"/> For Kirk, the change was simply an acceptance that New Zealand was ready to move towards a broader concept of nationhood. Diplomatic posts had for some years marked the day, and it seemed timely in view of the country's increasing role on the international stage that the national day be known as New Zealand Day.<ref name="Waitangi Day 1970s"/> At the 1974 commemorations, the [[Flag of New Zealand]] was flown for the first time at the top of the flagstaff at Waitangi, rather than the [[Union Flag]], and a replica of the flag of the [[United Tribes of New Zealand]] was also flown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day/waitangi-day-1970s|accessdate=12 February 2017|title=Waitangi Day 1970s|publisher=New Zealand History – nzhistory.govt.nz}}</ref>

The election of the [[Third National Government of New Zealand|third National government]] in 1975 led to the day being renamed Waitangi Day because the new prime minister, [[Robert Muldoon]], did not like the name "New Zealand Day" and many Māori felt that it debased the treaty. Another [[Waitangi Day Act]] was passed in 1976 to change the name back to Waitangi Day<ref>Waitangi Day at [http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/node/972 NZhistory.net.nz]</ref> and restore Northland's anniversary day holiday to that of Auckland.

Waitangi Day underwent 'Mondayisation' in legislation enacted in 2013, shifting the public holiday to Monday if 6 February falls on a Saturday or Sunday.<ref name="Extra public holidays voted in">{{cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Extra-public-holidays-voted-in/tabid/1607/articleID/294661/Default.aspx|title=Extra public holidays voted in|date=17 April 2013|work=3 News NZ}}</ref>

At dawn on Waitangi Day, the Royal New Zealand Navy raises the [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand Flag]], [[Union Flag]] and [[White Ensign]] on the flagstaff in the treaty grounds. The ceremonies during the day generally include a church service and cultural displays such as dance and song. Several [[Waka (canoe)|waka]] and a navy ship also re-enact the coming ashore of Governor Hobson to sign the treaty. The day closes with the flags being lowered by the Navy in a traditional ceremony.<ref name="NZ Herald"/>

==Controversy and protest==
[[File:The flag post by the treaty house - Waitangi.jpg|thumb|right|The flagstaff at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]], the focus of significant protest. On the flagstaff is flown, from left, the Flag of the [[United Tribes of New Zealand]]; the Ensign of the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]], and the [[Union Flag]].]]
By 1971, Waitangi and Waitangi Day had become a focus of protest concerning treaty injustices, with [[Ngā Tamatoa]] leading early protests. Activists initially called for greater recognition of the treaty, but by the early 1980s, they were also arguing that it was a fraud and the means by which Pākehā had conned Māori out of their land. Attempts were made by groups, including the Waitangi Action Committee, to halt the commemorations.<ref>Hazlehurst, Kayleen M. (1995), 'Ethnicity, Ideology and Social Drama: The Waitangi Day Incident 1981' in Alisdair Rogers and Steven Vertovec, eds, ''The Urban Context: Ethnicity, Social Networks and Situational Analysis'', Oxford and Washington D.C., p.83; Walker, Ranginui (1990), ''Ka Whawhai Tonu Matou: Struggle without End'', Auckland, p.221.</ref> This led to confrontations between police and protesters, sometimes resulting in dozens of arrests. When the treaty gained greater official recognition in the mid-1980s, emphasis switched back to calls to honour it, and protesters generally returned to the aim of raising awareness of it and what they saw as its neglect by the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11583909|accessdate=11 February 2017|title=A brief history of Waitangi Day – "Not everyone has something to celebrate"|date=5 February 2016|work=NZ Herald}}</ref>

Some New Zealand politicians and commentators, such as [[Paul Holmes (broadcaster)|Paul Holmes]], have felt that Waitangi Day is too controversial to be a national day and have sought to replace it with [[Anzac Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10784735|title=Waitangi Day a complete waste |author=Paul Holmes |author-link=Paul Holmes (broadcaster) |accessdate=13 February 2012|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=11 February 2012}}</ref> Others, for example the [[United Future]] Party's [[Peter Dunne]], have suggested that the name be changed back to New Zealand Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedfuture.org.nz/press/show_item.php?t=0&i=1540|publisher=UnitedFuture|title=United Future press release|date=5 February 2007}}</ref>

===Recent protests===
[[File:Māori protest at Waitangi (February 6, 2006).jpg|thumbnail|left|Māori protestors in 2006]]
Several hundred protesters often gather at Waitangi to reflect long-standing frustrations manifested among Māori since the signing of the treaty. Although not part of government commemorations, Māori-sovereignty activists often fly the [[Tino Rangatiratanga flag]] from the flagstaff. Attempts at vandalism of the flagstaff are often an objective of these protests, carrying on a tradition that dates from the 19th century when [[Hone Heke]] chopped down the British flagstaff in nearby Russell. In 2004, protesters succeeded in flying the Tino Rangatiratanga flag above the other flags on the flagstaff by flying it from the top of a nearby tree.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/253649/2591764.xhtml|title=Maori flag flies over Waitangi|website=TVNZ|access-date=20 March 2018|date=6 February 2004|quote=For the first time ever the Maori sovereignty flag has flown higher than the official New Zealand flag at Waitangi. A young Northland Maori activist climbed a 40-metre [[Araucaria araucana|monkey puzzle tree]] on the Waitangi treaty grounds on Friday afternoon and fixed the black and red {{lang|mi|[[tino rangitiratanga]]}} flag to the top, well above the nearby naval flagstaff. He climbed down to tumultuous applause and a triumphant {{lang|mi|[[haka]]}}.}}</ref>

Because of the level of protest and threats that had previously occurred at Waitangi, Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] did not attend in 2000. The official commemorations were shifted from Waitangi to [[Wellington]] for 2001. Some Māori felt that this was an insult to them and to the treaty. In 2003 and 2004, the anniversary was again officially commemorated at the Treaty House at Waitangi. In 2004, Leader of the Opposition [[Don Brash]] was hit with mud as he entered the marae as a response to his controversial [[Orewa Speech]] that year.<ref name="NZ_Herald_3547561">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/treaty-of-waitangi/news/article.cfm?c_id=350&objectid=3547561 |title=Mud thrown at Brash at marae |date=5 February 2004 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref>

On 5 February 2009, the day before Waitangi Day, as then Prime Minister [[John Key]] was being escorted onto a marae, he was challenged and jostled by Wikitana and John Junior Popata, nephews of then [[Māori Party]] MP [[Hone Harawira]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10555435|title=Elders condemn attack on PM|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=6 February 2009|first=Claire|last=Trevett}}</ref> Both admitted to assault and were sentenced to 100 hours of community service.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10578063">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10578063 |title=Brothers sentenced for assaulting John Key |date=12 June 2009 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref> In 2011, Wikitana and John again heckled Key as he entered the marae.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10704321">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10704321 |title=Harawira proud of nephew's protest |author=Yvonne Tahana |author2=Claire Trevett |name-list-style=amp |date=5 February 2011 |agency=with [[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref> A wet T-shirt thrown at Queen Elizabeth II<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/36/1/59.full.pdf|title=Attacks on the British Royal Family: The Role of Psychotic Illness|author=David V.

In 2016 a nurse protesting against the proposed signing of the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership|TPPA]] trade agreement [[Waitangi dildo incident|threw a rubber dildo]] at [[Steven Joyce]], the MP representing Prime Minister John Key, who had refused to attend, having been denied normal speaking rights. The woman was arrested but later released.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/16/new-zealand-mp-dildo-baggins-cops-sex-toy-in-the-face-and-takes-ribbing-on-the-chin|accessdate=13 February 2017|title=New Zealand MP 'Dildo Baggins' cops sex toy in the face and takes ribbing on the chin|date=16 February 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

In 2018, Prime Minister [[Jacinda Ardern]] visited Waitangi for five days, the longest any prime minister has stayed. [[Titewhai Harawira]], a Māori activist, greeted Ardern and escorted her onto the Treaty grounds holding hands, a significant change from her response to Helen Clark's visit in 1998, which brought Clark to tears. Ardern is also the first female prime minister to be given speaking rights on the marae by Ngāpuhi, who also offered to bury her child's placenta on the tribunal grounds.<ref name="Ainge-Roy">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/06/jacinda-ardern-waitangi-day-changes-new-zealand|title=Jacinda Ardern defuses tensions on New Zealand's sacred Waitangi Day|last=Ainge-Roy|first=Eleanor|date=6 February 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=23 May 2018}}</ref> Ardern was praised for her speech during her visit where she said "one day I want to be able to tell my child that I earned the right to stand here, and only you can tell me when I have done that".<ref name="Ainge-Roy"/> Wally Haumaha, assistant commissioner, told the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' it was the best Waitangi Day commemoration he had attended in over a decade, saying, "I can retire gracefully and know that we saw this day where the government was treated with respect and dignity".<ref name="Ainge-Roy"/>
