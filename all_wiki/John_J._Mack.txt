== Early life and education ==
Mack was born in [[Mooresville, North Carolina]], the son of Alice (née Azouri) and Charles Mack. Mack's father's original family name was Makhoul; he came to the United States from [[Lebanon]] when he was 12 years old, following Mack's grandfather, who had arrived at [[Ellis Island]] in 1909.<ref name=NYTimes-LebaneseAmerican-2006>{{cite news|last1=Thomas Jr.|first1=Landon|title=From Lebanese-American Financiers, Differing Views on the Strife|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/business/worldbusiness/01wall.html|accessdate=12 November 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 August 2006}}</ref>

The family settled in [[North Carolina]]. Mack's father ran a wholesale grocery, clothing, and general merchandise store called John Mack & Son in [[Mooresville, North Carolina]].<ref name=MackandMack-Madeline-2006>{{cite news|title=Madeline Mack (1914-2006)|url=https://mamclothing.com/madelines-influence/|accessdate=13 November 2015|work=Mack and Mack Clothing}}</ref> The business occupied The John Mack Building from 1937 to the 1990s.<ref name=MooresvilleHistoricWalkingTour-pamphlet>{{cite web|title=Mooresville Historic Walking Tour|url=http://68.71.163.9/walkingtour/WalkingTour.pdf|website=Town of Mooresville|accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref> Mack is the youngest of six sons.

In 1968, Mack graduated from [[Duke University]], where he attended on a [[American football|football]] scholarship and majored in history.

== Career ==

=== Morgan Stanley ===
Mack worked at several firms around Wall Street before starting his career at Morgan Stanley in 1972 as a salesman, and has since worked for the company for nearly thirty years.

To stabilize the firm, he forged strategic alliances with China Investment Corporation and Mitsubishi UFJ Group and entered into a joint venture with Smith Barney, forming at the time the world's largest wealth management firm. During the crisis, Mack was advised by U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Hank Paulson]] and the head of the Federal Reserve Bank [[Ben Bernanke]] to sell Morgan Stanley. He has stated that during negotiations he was under considerable pressure from the president of the New York Federal Reserve, [[Tim Geithner]], to sell or merge Morgan Stanley to one of his competitors such as [[JPMorgan Chase|JP Morgan]].<ref name=WSJ-WallStreetDied-2008>{{cite news|last1=Craig|first1=Susanne|last2=McCracken|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Luccetti|first3=Aaron|last4=Kelly|first4=Kate|title=The Weekend That Wall Street Died|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123051066413538349|accessdate=12 November 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=29 December 2008}}</ref> Mack saw this as being contrary to the interests of Morgan Stanley shareholders and employees, similar to the demise of [[Bear Stearns]] in a forced sale to JP Morgan for $2 per share, (the deal was later revised to $10 a share), and insisted on finding other sources of financing instead.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Mack on Saving Morgan Stanley, Inside the Bunker  |publisher=[[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]|date=October 14, 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9sQtmPAYO0 |format= [[Flash Video]] (26:22) |accessdate=May 19, 2010}}</ref>
