The '''American Constitution Society for Law and Policy''' ('''ACS''') is a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[legal]] [[organization]]. The group's stated mission is to "promote the vitality of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and the fundamental values it expresses: individual rights and liberties, genuine equality, access to justice, democracy and the rule of law."<ref name=mission>{{cite web|title=Mission|url=http://www.acslaw.org/about/mission|publisher=American Constitution Society|accessdate=January 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214073646/http://www.acslaw.org/about/mission|archive-date=February 14, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

ACS was created as a counterweight to, and is modeled after, the [[Federalist Society]], and is often described as its progressive counterpart.<ref>Michael McGough, [http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/05226/553199-84.stm Supreme Court nomination battle spotlights legal societies and their divergent views: Newer American Constitution Society modeled on more conservative Federalist Society] (August 14, 2005), ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''.</ref><ref>Jonathan H.

==History==
The American Constitution Society was founded in 2001 by Peter Rubin, a [[Georgetown University Law Center|Georgetown Law School]] professor who served as counsel to [[Al Gore]] in the [[Bush v. Gore|legal battle]] over the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 election]]. The group was originally known as the Madison Society for Law and Policy. The organization was formed as a counterweight to the conservative [[Federalist Society]]. It was founded in order to build a network of progressive lawyers and foster new avenues of progressive legal thought.<ref name=nyt/><ref name=wapo>{{cite news|last1=Fletcher|first1=Michael|title=Legal Organization May Become Influential Beyond Its Dreams|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/06/AR2008120601808.html|accessdate=January 29, 2015|newspaper=Washington Post|date=December 7, 2008}}</ref> ACS received its initial funding from the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]].<ref name=nyt/><ref name=nyt2>{{cite news|last1=Nix Hines|first1=Crystal|title=Young Liberal Law Group Is Expanding|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/01/us/young-liberal-law-group-is-expanding.html|accessdate=January 29, 2015|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 1, 2001|ref=nyt2}}</ref> The [[Democracy Alliance]] lists ACS as a recommended funding recipient.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Prokop|first1=Andrew|title=The Democracy Alliance: How a secretive group of donors helps set the progressive agenda|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/11/24/7274819/democracy-alliance|accessdate=January 29, 2015|publisher=Vox|date=November 24, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Gold|first1=Matea|title=New Koch offensive puts spotlight on Democracy Alliance|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/09/08/new-koch-offensive-puts-spotlight-on-democracy-alliance/|accessdate=January 29, 2015|newspaper=Washington Post|date=September 8, 2014}}</ref>
