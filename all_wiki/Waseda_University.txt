{{nihongo|'''Waseda University'''|早稲田大学|Waseda Daigaku}}, abbreviated as {{nihongo||早大|'''Sōdai'''}}, is a Japanese [[private university|private]] [[research university]] in [[Shinjuku]], [[Tokyo]]. Founded in 1882 as the '''''Tōkyō Senmon Gakkō''''' by [[Ōkuma Shigenobu]], the school was formally renamed Waseda University in 1902.<ref name="Waseda University">{{cite web|title=About Waseda: Founding of the University|url=https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/about/work/history|website=Waseda University|publisher=Waseda University|access-date=6 May 2016}}</ref>

Waseda is organized into thirty-six departments: thirteen undergraduate schools and twenty-three graduate schools. As of May 2016, there were 42,860 undergraduate students and 8,269 graduate students. In addition to a central campus in Shinjuku, the university operates campuses in [[Chūō, Tokyo|Chūō]], [[Nishitōkyō, Tokyo|Nishitōkyō]], [[Tokorozawa, Saitama|Tokorozawa]], [[Honjō, Saitama|Honjō]], and [[Kitakyūshū, Fukuoka|Kitakyūshū]]. Waseda also operates twenty-one research institutes at its main Shinjuku campus. The [[Waseda University Library]] is collectively one of Japan's largest libraries and currently hold some 4.5 million volumes and 46,000 serials.

Waseda consistently ranks among the most academically selective and prestigious universities in [[College and university rankings#Japan|Japanese university rankings]]. It is often ranked alongside [[Keio University]], its rival, as the best private university in Japan. In 2020–2021, Waseda ranked 189th in the ''[[QS World University Rankings]]''. Waseda is among the top type of the select Japanese universities assigned additional funding under the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|MEXT]]'s [[Top Global University Project]] to enhance Japan's global educational competitiveness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uni.international.mext.go.jp/university_list/Index/ |title=Member University List |access-date=2016-07-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821171521/http://www.uni.international.mext.go.jp/university_list/Index/ |archive-date=August 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Waseda has graduated many notable alumni, including seven [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Ministers of Japan]], numerous important figures of Japanese literature, including [[Haruki Murakami]], and many CEOs, including [[Tadashi Yanai]], the CEO of [[UNIQLO]], [[Nobuyuki Idei]], the former CEO of [[Sony]], [[Takeo Fukui]], the former president and CEO of [[Honda]], Norio Sasaki, the former CEO of [[Toshiba]], [[Lee Kun-hee]], the Chairman of [[Samsung Group]], Mikio Sasaki, the former Chairman of [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] and [[Shuntaro Furukawa]], former and current Presidents of [[Nintendo]] respectively.

==History==
[[File:Shigenobu Okuma 5.jpg|thumb|Prince [[Okuma Shigenobu]] (1838-1922), 5th Prime Minister of Japan and founder of the university in 1882]]
Waseda was founded as {{nihongo||東京専門学校|Tōkyō Senmon Gakkō}} on October 21, 1882, by [[samurai]] scholar and [[Meiji period|Meiji]]-era politician and former prime minister [[Ōkuma Shigenobu]]. Before the name 'Waseda' was selected, it was known variously as {{nihongo||早稲田学校|Waseda Gakkō}} or {{nihongo||戸塚学校|Totsuka Gakkō}} after the location of the founder's villa in Waseda Village and the school's location in Totsuka Village respectively. It was renamed {{nihongo|Waseda University|早稲田大学|Waseda-daigaku}} on September 2, 1902, upon acquiring university status. It started as a college with three departments under the old Japanese system of higher education.

In 1882, the university had the department of political science and economics, law, and physical science. Along with these departments, an English language course was established, where the students of all the departments could learn English.<ref>Kimura, pp. 74, 123</ref> Three years later, the department of physical science was closed because it had too few applicants.<ref>Kimura,  pp. 74, 122</ref>

The department of literature was established in 1890,<ref>Okushima and Nakamura (eds.), p.25</ref> the department of education in 1903, the department of commerce in 1904,<ref>Okushima and Nakamura (eds.), p.37</ref> and the department of science and engineering in 1908.<ref>Okushima and Nakamura (eds.), p.42</ref>

Although Waseda formally adopted the term university in its title in 1902<ref name="Waseda University" /> it was not until 1920 that, in common with other Japanese schools and colleges, it received formal government recognition as a university under the terms of the University Establishment Ordinance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digital.archives.go.jp/DAS/meta/MetSearch.cgi?DEF_XSL=default&SUM_KIND=summary_normal&META_KIND=NOFRAME&IS_KIND=detail&IS_SCH=META&IS_STYLE=default&IS_TYPE=meta&DB_ID=G9100001EXTERNAL&GRP_ID=G9100001&IS_START=1&IS_TAG_S1=InD&IS_TMP_S7=c_t_search_3&IS_KEY_S7=SRG+BST+KNM&IS_TAG_S7=c_t&IS_LGC_S7=AND&LIST_TYPE=default&IS_LIST_ON_OF=off&LIST_VIEW=&ON_LYD=on&IS_KEY_S1=%E6%97%A9%E7%A8%B2%E7%94%B0%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E3%80%80%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E4%BB%A4&IS_NUMBER=1&SUM_NUMBER=100&SUM_START=1&IS_LYD_DIV=&LIST_VIEW=&_SHOW_EAD_ID=M0000000000001754283&ON_LYD=on|title=国立公文書館 デジタルアーカイブ|author=独立行政法人国立公文書館 |trans-title=NATIONAL ARCHIVES OF JAPAN|website=国立公文書館 デジタルアーカイブ}}</ref> Thus Waseda became, with [[Keio University]], the first private university in Japan.

[[File:Waseda University students in 1916.jpg|thumb|Waseda University students in 1916]]

Much of the campus was destroyed in the fire bombings of Tokyo during [[World War II]], but the university was rebuilt and reopened by 1949. It has grown to become a comprehensive university with two senior high schools and school of art and architecture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

On June 12, 1950, sixty police raided Waseda University and seized copies of a Communist-inspired open letter to General MacArthur. The open letter to MacArthur was once read at a Communist-sponsored rally a week earlier. The letter demanded a peace treaty for Japan that would include Russia and Communist China, withdrawal of occupation forces, and the release of eight Japanese sent to prison for assaulting five U.S soldiers at a Communist rally. A police official said most Waseda meetings would be banned in the future because "political elements" might try to utilize them. Yuichi Eshima, Vice-Chairman of the Students Autonomy Society, said the police action "stupefied" students and professors, and that "This is worse than the prewar peace preservation measures."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19500612&id=9l8sAAAAIBAJ&pg=5695,4693589&hl=en|title= Tokyo College Raided Sunday|publisher=Herald-Journal |date= Jun 12, 1950}}</ref>

===Academic cap===
Ōkuma had long desired to create an academic cap so distinctive that someone wearing the cap would immediately be identified as a Waseda student.<ref>[http://www.waseda.jp/student/weekly/contents/2007a/125i.html (in Japanese) ''Waseda kaiwai'']</ref> The chief tailor of [[Takashimaya]], Yashichiro, was called upon to design a cap in three days.
Each square cap was stamped on the inside with the student's name, his department, the school seal and the legend, "This certifies that the owner is a student of Waseda". Thus, the cap served as a form of identification, and effectively a status symbol. The cap, with its gold-braided badge, is registered as a trademark.

===125th anniversary===
[[File:Waseda University.jpg|thumb|Waseda University]]
On October 21, 2007, Waseda University celebrated its 125th anniversary. Ōkuma often talked about the "125 years of life" theory: "The lifespan of a human being can be as long as 125 years. He will be able to live out his natural lifespan as long as he takes proper care of his health", because "physiologists say that every animal has the ability to live five times as long as its growth period. Since a man is said to require about 25 years to become fully mature, it follows that he can live up to 125 years of age." This theory propounded by Ōkuma was very popular and often referred to in the media of the time.

In commemorative events relating to Waseda University and Ōkuma, the number 125 is accorded special significance, as it marks an important epoch. The tower of Ōkuma Auditorium, completed on the university's 45th anniversary, is 125 ''[[Shaku (unit of measurement)|shaku]]'', or about 38&nbsp;m high. In 1963, there were also events to mark the 125th anniversary of Ōkuma Shigenobu's birth.

Ōkuma, who twice served as prime minister of Japan, organized his second cabinet when he was 77 and died when he was 83. He said, "I wish I had understood this '125&nbsp;years of life' theory 30&nbsp;years earlier". He did, however, lead a regular life, and lived fairly long compared to other Japanese at the time.

===Controversy===
[[Super Free]] was a registered Waseda University school club organized by Shinichirō Wada, a student at Waseda University who entered in 1994. The club organized parties in order to rape unsuspecting women. The appeal of these parties was the chance to associate with Waseda University students. After Wada was arrested in 2003, the club was disbanded.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/04/1057179156476.html |title=Revealed: the workings of a uni rape club |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=2003-07-05| access-date=2016-08-28}}</ref>

==Facilities==
===Ōkuma Auditorium===
{{main|Ōkuma Auditorium}}
[[File:WASEDA-DAIGAKU.jpg|left|thumb|300px|[[Ōkuma Auditorium]], a contemporary building by architect [[Satō Kōichi (architect)|Satō Kōichi]].]]
[[File:Waseda University Campus.jpg|thumb|Ōkuma Auditorium, Waseda University campus]]

The [[Ōkuma Auditorium]] is three-story main auditorium that seats 1,435, while the secondary auditorium, located underground, can accommodate 382 people. A seven-story high clock tower stands to the left of the auditorium. Important events and lectures hosted by Waseda University are often held in the Ōkuma Auditorium. Club-sponsored plays, lectures and events are held in the auditorium on days when it is not in use by the university. Many of Waseda University's undergraduate and graduate schools hold their entrance and graduation ceremonies at the Okuma Auditorium.

The auditorium opened on October 20, 1927, about five years behind schedule, after the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]]. A Memorial Hall, constructed in 1957, was used as the [[Fencing at the 1964 Summer Olympics|fencing]] venue for the [[1964 Summer Olympics]].<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1964/or1964v1pt1.pdf 1964 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1. Part 1. pp. 127–8.</ref>

In April 1999, the auditorium along with the old library building were officially designated the first and second historical buildings under the newly passed Tokyo Metropolitan Landscape Regulations, which aim to preserve buildings representative of Tokyo's history and culture. The auditorium was designated as one of the [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan]] by the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=早稲田大学大隈記念講堂|url=https://kunishitei.bunka.go.jp/heritage/detail/102/00004220|work=国指定文化財等データベース:各棟情報詳細|access-date=April 11, 2012}}</ref>

===Ōkuma Garden===
[[File:Okuma1.jpg|thumb|x200px|Ōkuma Garden]]
[[Ōkuma Garden]] is located near Ōkuma Auditorium. It is a half-Japanese, half-Western garden of Edo period feudal lord Matsudaira Sanuki's former mansion, redesigned by Shigenobu Ōkuma. After his death, the garden was donated to Waseda University. Now it is a recreation place for students.

===Libraries and museums===
The [[Waseda University Library]], designed by Tachu Naitō, Kenji Imai and Kin'ichi Kiriyama, was completed in 1925. This five-story building, with a total area of {{convert|1195|tsubo|adj=on}} {{nihongo||坪|}}, was used initially as the University Library. The reading room was housed in a separate two-story building, with a [[seating capacity]] of 500. One of the prominent libraries established at the end of the [[Taishō period]], it has been a symbol of Waseda University to this day, along with the Okuma Auditorium and the Theatre Museum.

The Old Library and the administration building were expanded in 1934 and 1955, respectively. After the New Central Library, the Old Library stopped serving as a main library, located where the Abe Stadium used to be, was completed in 1990. It now houses Takata Sanae Memorial Research Library, the University Archives, and Aizu Yaichi Museum. Takata Sanae Memorial Research Library opened in 1994. It is named after former university president Takata Sanae. Historical and cultural materials on Waseda University are exhibited in the University Archives, and the materials related with Ōkuma Shigenobu are exhibited in the Ōkuma Memorial Room at the Archives. Aizu Yaichi Memorial Museum opened in 1998.

In the front hall, visitors are greeted by the masterpiece "Meian", which dates back to 1927. It is painted on the world's largest hand-made washi (Japanese paper), which is 4.45 meters in diameter and weighs about 12 kilograms. It was manufactured by Iwano　Heisaburō, the founder of the Echizen paper works in Imadachi-cho, Fukui prefecture. The masterpiece was painted free of charge by [[Yokoyama Taikan]] and [[Kanzan Shimomura|Shimomura Kanzan]], two artists who represented the modern Japanese style of painting. President Takata Sanae asked them to paint a picture for the Library.

The library possesses a unique collection which survived the [[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II]] unlike many of its counterparts. The collection is an important resource for the study of pre-war Japanese history and literature.

Other museums and libraries on Waseda campuses include:
* Waseda University Library
* [[Waseda University Tsubouchi Memorial Theatre Museum]]
* Aizu Museum
