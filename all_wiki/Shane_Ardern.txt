He was first elected in the [[1998 Taranaki-King Country by-election|Taranaki-King Country by-election of 1998]], which was prompted by the retirement from politics of former [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Jim Bolger]]. He held that seat from 1998 to 2014.<ref name="retirement announced">{{cite news |last1=Fox |first1=Michael |title=Shane Ardern to retire |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9470036/Shane-Ardern-to-retire |accessdate=19 September 2014 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=3 December 2013}}</ref>

Ardern was one of the driving forces behind the legislation that enabled the setting up of dairy giant [[Fonterra]].<ref name="TDN article" /> He gained nationwide recognition in late 2003 when, having driven a tractor up the front steps of [[New Zealand Parliament Buildings|Parliament House]] as part of a protest against a proposed [[agricultural emissions research levy]], nicknamed the "flatulence" or "fart tax", he was investigated by police for dangerous conduct and charged with disorderly conduct.<ref name="retirement announced" /> From 2008 to 2014, he was appointed chairman of the Primary Production Select Committee, a role that he held until his retirement. It was speculated by media and bloggers in late 2013 that Ardern was one of the MPs likely to retire due to the need for caucus rejuvenation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Retirement==

Ardern announced he was stepping down from his seat in December 2013 and that he would remain an MP until the end of the [[50th New Zealand Parliament]].<ref>{{cite news | title= Shane Ardern to Step Down| url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/229711/shane-ardern-mp-to-step-down-at-next-election |publisher=Radio NZ| accessdate= 31 January 2015}}</ref> Since retiring from Parliament, Ardern has returned to his Central North Island farms, having been succeeded in the Taranki-King Country seat by [[Barbara Kuriger]].<ref name="TDN article">{{cite news |last1=O'Dowd |first1=Sue |title=MP: Tractor protest well worth it |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/9570754/MP-Tractor-protest-well-worth-it |accessdate=19 September 2014 |work=[[Taranaki Daily News]] |date=2 January 2014}}</ref> Ardern has also begun advocating again at the grassroots  levels for the Taranaki farming communities that supply [[Fonterra]] having been noted at several post-election forums held by the dairy industry.<ref>{{cite web |title= Fonterra Urged to Grow Globally| url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/dairy/63146784/Fonterra-urged-to-grow-globally| publisher= stuff.co.nz | accessdate= 31 January 2015 }}</ref>
