== Biography ==
===Early life and education===
Gail Currer was born in [[Pretoria]], South Africa. Currer attended the [[University of Cape Town]]<ref name="Forbes2010">{{cite journal |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/gail-kelly|title=The 100 Most Powerful Women: #8 Gail Kelly|date=6 October 2010|accessdate=8 October 2010|journal=Forbes}}</ref> where she undertook an arts degree majoring in history and Latin as well as a Diploma in Education. She married Allan Kelly in December 1977.<ref name="THEAGE1" /><ref name="WESTPAC" />

=== Teacher ===
The couple moved to [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) where she taught Latin at [[Falcon College]] while he served in the [[Rhodesian Security Forces|Rhodesian Army]]. They returned to South Africa where Allan Kelly studied medicine at the [[University of the Witswatersrand]] and Gail Kelly taught at a government high school.<ref name="THEAGE1" />

=== Banking ===
Kelly started work at the [[Nedcor Bank]] in 1980 as a teller but was fast-tracked into an accelerated training program.<ref name="WESTPAC" /> She started an [[MBA]] in 1986 while pregnant with her oldest daughter and graduated with distinction in 1987.<ref name="THEAGE1" /> In 1990, she became head of [[human resources]] at Nedcor (after having given birth to triplets five months earlier). From early 1992 to 1997 she held various other general manager positions at Nedcor, including cards and personal banking.

The Kellys were becoming disillusioned with South Africa in the middle of the 1990s and were looking to move to a different country. In June 1997, she flew to Sydney where she held interviews with four of the major banks and was appointed to a senior position at the [[Commonwealth Bank]] in July 1997.<ref name="THEAGE1" /><ref name="WESTPAC" />

===Career in Australia===
Kelly started work as the General Manager of Strategic Marketing in the Commonwealth Bank in October 1997. By 2002, she was head of the Customer Service Division responsible for running the Commonwealth Bank's extensive branch network.<ref name="WESTPAC">{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/719245/000110465907063344/a07-22245_1ex1.htm|title=Westpac Media Release August 2007 |date=17 August 2007 |accessdate=15 April 2011 |publisher=[[Westpac]] }}</ref>

Her performance at the Commonwealth Bank led her to be recruited as CEO of St. George Bank (after the death of the incumbent CEO from a heart attack). She commenced in January 2002 – at the time, St. George was seen as a possible takeover target (especially after the purchase of [[Colonial State Bank]] by the Commonwealth Bank) but Kelly increased the bank's [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] and achieved much higher levels on [[return on assets]].<ref name="THEAGE1" /> In November 2004, St. George Bank gave Kelly a pay rise and [[evergreen contract|extended her contract indefinitely]] with the capitalisation of the bank having risen by $3&nbsp;billion since the start of her term as CEO. The [[Australian Banking & Finance]] magazine gave her an award for Best Financial Services Executive in 2003 and 2004.<ref name="THEAGE1"/>

Due to her success at St George, there was extensive media speculation in June 2005 that she would return to the Commonwealth Bank as CEO on the retirement of [[David Murray (Australian businessman)|David Murray]] [[Order of Australia|AO]], but Kelly said that she was committed to remaining with St. George. Murray was replaced by [[Ralph Norris]], the former CEO and managing director of [[Air New Zealand]].<ref name="WESTPAC" />

On Friday 17 August 2007, she announced her resignation as CEO of St. George Bank to take up the same position in Westpac from 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.stgeorge.com.au/media_centre/news/news_archive.asp?id=254 |title = Kelly resigns from St.George |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070903184329/http://stgeorge.com.au/media_centre/news/news_archive.asp?id=254 |archive-date = 3 September 2007 }}</ref> She started work as Westpac CEO on 1 February 2008.<ref name="WESTPAC" />

On 12 May 2008 Kelly announced an $18.6 billion merger between Westpac and [[St. George Bank]].<ref name="abc.net.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-05-13/st-george-westpac-agree-on-merger-terms/2434060|title=St George, Westpac agree on merger terms|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=13 May 2008|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> The merger was approved by the [[Federal Court of Australia]] and finalised on 26 May 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/business/story/0,23636,23759042-462,00.html|title=St George and WBC sign merger deal, ''NEWS.com.au''|date=26 May 2008|accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref> The merger resulted in the new combined Westpac Group having 10 million customers, a 25% share of the Australian home loans market and with $108 billion investment funds under its administration.<ref name="abc.net.au"/>

In October 2010, Kelly announced a target to have women occupy 40% of the top 4000 managerial positions at Westpac, a task reported by ''The Australian'' newspaper to have been almost achieved by March 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/companies/westpac-chiefs-new-kind-of-womens-liberation/story-fn91v9q3-1226292626827|title=Westpac chief Gail Kelly's new kind of women's liberation|date=8 March 2012|accessdate=2 May 2013|work=[[The Australian]]}}</ref>

On 13 November 2014, Kelly announced that she would retire as CEO of the Westpac Group on 1 February 2015. Brian Hartzer, the head of Westpac's Australian financial services group, was appointed as her replacement.<ref name="smh"/>

On 1 August 2017, Kelly released her first book, ''Live Lead Learn: My Stories of Life and Leadership'' (Viking, an imprint of Penguin Random House). The book details her experiences of being a high-profile businesswoman and a mother of four.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2017/08/02/be-bold-have-go-gail-kelly-urges-women|title=Be bold, have a go, Gail Kelly urges women|work=[[SBS World News]]|date=2 August 2017|accessdate=9 August 2017}}</ref>
