A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he previously served as the 23rd [[White House Chief of Staff]] from 2009 to 2010, and as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Chicago]] between 2003 and 2009.

Born in Chicago, Emanuel is a graduate of [[Sarah Lawrence College]] and [[Northwestern University]]. Working early in his career in Democratic politics, Emanuel was appointed as director of the finance committee for [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|1992 presidential campaign]]. In 1993, he joined the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], where he served as the assistant to the president for political affairs and as the [[Senior Advisor to the President of the United States|Senior Advisor to the President]] for policy and strategy. Beginning a career in finance, Emanuel worked at the [[investment bank]] [[Wasserstein Perella & Co.]] from 1998 for 2½ years, and served on the board of directors of [[Freddie Mac]]. In 2002, Emanuel ran for the seat in the U.S. House of Representatives vacated by [[Rod Blagojevich]], who resigned to become [[governor of Illinois]]. Emanuel won the first of three terms representing [[Illinois's 5th congressional district]], a seat he held from 2003 to 2009. After the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], President [[Barack Obama]] appointed Emanuel to serve as [[White House Chief of Staff|White House chief of staff]].

In October 2010, Emanuel resigned as chief of staff to run as a candidate in [[2011 Chicago mayoral election|Chicago's 2011 mayoral election]]. Emanuel won with 55% of the vote over five other candidates in the [[non-partisan]] mayoral election, succeeding 22-year incumbent [[Richard M. Daley]]. At his reelection, although Emanuel failed to obtain an absolute majority in the February 2015 mayoral election, he defeated Cook County board commissioner (and later [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]]) [[Jesús "Chuy" García]] in the subsequent run-off election in April. In late 2015, Emanuel's approval rating plunged to "the low 20s"<ref name="Chicago Sun-Times">{{Cite news|title=Mayor Rahm Emanuel fundraising in Washington, D. C.

===Elections===
In 2002, Emanuel pursued the U.S. House seat in the 5th district of Illinois, previously held by [[Rod Blagojevich]], who successfully ran for [[governor of Illinois]]. His strongest opponent in the crowded primary of eight was former Illinois state representative Nancy Kaszak. During the primary, [[Edward Moskal]], president of the [[Polish American Congress]], a [[political action committee]] endorsing Kaszak, called Emanuel a "millionaire [[carpetbagger]]".<ref name="NYT03062002">{{cite news|last=Wilgoren|first=Jodi|title=Ethnic Comments Rattle Race for Congress|work=[[New York Times]]|date=March 6, 2002|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/06/us/ethnic-comments-rattle-race-for-congress.html|accessdate=January 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304185137/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/06/us/ethnic-comments-rattle-race-for-congress.html|archive-date=March 4, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Emanuel won the primary and defeated [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] candidate Mark Augusti in the [[United States House elections, 2002#Illinois|general election]]. Emanuel's inaugural election to the House was the closest he ever had, as he won more than 70% of the vote in all of his re-election bids.

===Tenure===
[[File:Rahm Emanuel at St. Hyacinth Church.jpg|thumb|Rep. Emanuel speaking at [[Basilica of St. Hyacinth|St. Hyacinth Basilica]] in [[Chicago's Polish Village]]]]
Emanuel was elected after the October 2002 [[Iraq resolution|joint resolution]] authorizing the [[Iraq War]], and so did not vote on it. However, in the lead up to the resolution, Emanuel spoke out in support of the war.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

In January 2003, Emanuel was named to the [[House Financial Services Committee]] and sat on the subcommittee that oversaw Freddie Mac. A few months later, Freddie Mac Chief Executive Officer Leland Brendsel was forced out and the committee and subcommittee commenced more than a year of hearings into Freddie Mac. Emanuel skipped every hearing allegedly for reasons of avoiding any appearance of favoritism, impropriety, or conflict of interest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-03-26/news/chi-rahm-emanuel-profit-26-mar26_1_rahm-emanuel-freddie-mac-president-barack-obama|title=Rahm Emanuel's profitable stint at mortgage giant|accessdate=October 18, 2015|first1=Bob|last1=Secter|first2=Andrew|last2=Zajac|date=March 26, 2009|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211021358/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-03-26/news/chi-rahm-emanuel-profit-26-mar26_1_rahm-emanuel-freddie-mac-president-barack-obama|archive-date=December 11, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman===
Emanuel assumed the position of [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] chairman (DCCC) after the death of the previous chair, [[Bob Matsui]]. Emanuel led the Democratic Party's effort to capture the majority in the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections. The documentary ''[[HouseQuake]]'', featuring Emanuel, chronicles those elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/us/politics/22baker.html|title=Emanuel at the Epicenter: Then and Now|newspaper=The New York Times|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=October 21, 2009|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207223839/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/us/politics/22baker.html|archive-date=February 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Emanuel had disagreements over Democratic election strategy with [[Democratic National Committee]] Chairman [[Howard Dean]].

[[File:Rahm Emanuel DNC 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Emanuel speaks during the second day of the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]] ]]

The Democratic Party gained 30 seats in the House in the [[United States House elections, 2006|2006 elections]], and Emanuel received considerable praise for his stewardship of the DCCC, even from Illinois Republican Rep. [[Ray LaHood]], who said, "He legitimately can be called the golden boy of the Democratic Party today. He recruited the right candidates, found the money, and funded them, and provided issues for them. Rahm did what no one else could do in seven cycles."<ref name=WP_Haygood_20061108>{{cite news|last=Haygood|first=Wil|work=Washington Post|date=November 9, 2006|page=C05|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/08/AR2006110802239.html|accessdate=January 3, 2007|title=Democratic 'Golden Boy' Rahm Emanuel, Basking In the Glow of Victory|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830023233/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/08/AR2006110802239.html|archive-date=August 30, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

However, Emanuel also faced some criticism for his failure to support some progressive candidates, as Howard Dean advocated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Justin Coussoule Confirms Obama/Kaine Threw Out Dean's 50 State Strategy And Have Given Him NO Support|date=August 14, 2010|work=Crooks and Liars|url=http://crooksandliars.com/nicole-belle/justin-coussoule-confirms-obamakaine|access-date=February 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708204843/http://crooksandliars.com/nicole-belle/justin-coussoule-confirms-obamakaine|archive-date=July 8, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Emanuel had "aggressively recruited right-leaning candidates, frequently military veterans, including former Republicans". Many of the Representatives that Rahm had recruited, such as [[Heath Shuler]], ended up "[voting] against important Obama administration priorities, like economic stimulus, banking reform, and health care". Howie Klein has suggested that Emanuel's congressional campaign strategy was short-sighted, as it "contributed to the massive G.O.P. majorities we have now, the biggest since the nineteen-twenties" when the Democrats lost control of the House in the 2010 mid-term elections.<ref name="newyorker.com"/>

After Emanuel's election as chairman of the Democratic Caucus (see below), [[Chris Van Hollen]] became committee chair for the 110th Congress.

===Democratic Caucus chairman===
After his role in helping the Democrats win the 2006 elections, Emanuel was believed to be a leading candidate for the position of [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Whip]]. Nancy Pelosi, who became the next [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]], persuaded him not to challenge [[Jim Clyburn]], but instead to succeed Clyburn in the role of [[Democratic Caucus Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic Caucus Chairman]]. In return, Pelosi agreed to assign the caucus chair more responsibilities, including "aspects of strategy and messaging, incumbent retention, policy development, and rapid-response communications".

[[File:Blagojevich medicare.jpg|thumb|Emanuel joins Illinois governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] to advocate changes to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] legislation, September 24, 2003 ]]
;Social issues
Emanuel is generally [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] on [[social issues]]. He has maintained a 100-percent [[pro-choice]] voting record, supports [[LGBT rights]] including [[same-sex marriage]], and is a strong supporter of gun control, rated "F" by the NRA in December 2003.<ref name="on the issues">[http://www.ontheissues.org/IL/Rahm_Emanuel.htm Rahm Emanuel on the Issues] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115215316/http://ontheissues.org/IL/Rahm_Emanuel.htm |date=November 15, 2008 }}, [[On the Issues]], November 14, 2008</ref> He has also strongly supported the banning of numerous rifles based upon "sporting purposes" criteria.<ref name=NewsHour_19980405>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/jan-june98/guns_4-6.html|title=Online Focus: Taking Aim|date=April 6, 1998|work=[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119084624/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/jan-june98/guns_4-6.html|archive-date=January 19, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

During his original 2002 campaign, Emanuel spoke in support of the goal of "to help make health care affordable and available for all Americans".<ref name="newest"/>

In his 2006 book, co-authored with Bruce Reed, ''The Plan: Big Ideas for America'',<ref name=Emanuel-Reed2006>{{cite book|url=http://www.readtheplan.com/|title=The Plan: Big Ideas for Change in America|last1=Emanuel|first1=Rahm|first2=Bruce|last2=Reed|publisher=PublicAffairs Books|year=2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128011544/http://www.readtheplan.com/|archive-date=November 28, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> Emanuel advocated a three-month compulsory universal service program for Americans between the ages of 18 and 25. A similar, expanded version of the initiative was later proposed by Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign.

;Iraq war
During his original 2002 campaign, Emanuel "indicated his support of [[George W. Bush|President Bush]]'s position on [[Iraq]], but said he believed the President needed to better articulate his position to the American people".<ref name="newest"/>

In the 2006 congressional primaries, Emanuel, then head of the Democratic congressional campaign committee, helped organize a run by [[Tammy Duckworth]], an Iraq war veteran with no political experience, against grassroots candidate Christine Cegelis in Illinois' 6th district. Expedited withdrawal from Iraq was a central point of Cegelis' campaign and Duckworth opposed a withdrawal timetable.<ref name=Truthout_Renner_20070906>{{cite web|title=Democratic House Officials Recruited Wealthy Conservatives|first=Matt|last=Renner|date=September 6, 2007|work=[[truthout.org]]|url=http://www.truthout.org/article/special-report-democratic-house-officials-recruited-wealthy-conservatives|access-date=November 12, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114202744/http://www.truthout.org/article/special-report-democratic-house-officials-recruited-wealthy-conservatives|archive-date=November 14, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

;Middle East
In June 2007, Emanuel condemned an outbreak of Palestinian violence in the [[Gaza Strip]] and criticized Arab countries for not applying the same kind of pressure on the Palestinians as they have on [[Israel]]. At a 2003 pro-Israel rally in Chicago, Emanuel told the marchers that Israel was "ready for peace" but would not get there until Palestinians "turn away from the path of terror".<ref name=FoxNews_Ninan_20081105>{{cite news|last1= Ninan|first1= Reena|first2= Judson|last2= Berger|url= http://article.wn.com/view-travelagents/2008/11/06/With_Emanuel_Obama_Could_Be_Sending_Signal_to_Israel/|accessdate= August 31, 2015|title= With Emanuel, Obama Could Be Sending Signal to Israel|agency= Fox News|website= WN.com|publisher= World News Network|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151018235758/http://article.wn.com/view-travelagents/2008/11/06/With_Emanuel_Obama_Could_Be_Sending_Signal_to_Israel/|archive-date= October 18, 2015|url-status= live}}</ref>

==White House Chief of Staff==
Emanuel declared in April 2006 that he would support [[Hillary Clinton]] should she pursue the presidency in 2008. Emanuel remained close to Clinton since leaving the White House, talking strategy with her at least once a month as chairman of the DCCC.<ref name=Fortune_Easton_20061002 /> However, Emanuel's loyalties came into conflict when his home-state Senator, [[Barack Obama]], expressed interest in the race. Asked in January 2007, about his stance on the Democratic presidential nomination, he said: "I'm hiding under the desk.

In a 2009 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Emanuel was characterized as being "perhaps the most influential chief of staff of a generation".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/us/politics/16emanuel.html?hp|work=The New York Times|title=Emanuel Wields Power Freely, and Faces the Risks|first1=Peter|last1=Baker|first2=Jeff|last2=Zeleny|date=August 16, 2009|accessdate=April 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508201248/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/us/politics/16emanuel.html?hp|archive-date=May 8, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

He has a reputation for his no-holds-barred negotiation style that involves "his share of shouting and cursing". Ezekiel Emanuel has written, "The impatient, pushy Emanuel style is so well known that during a recent job interview I was asked, point-blank, whether I had the level-headed temperament the position required. ... . [A]s obvious to our flaws are to others, it's difficult to recognize them in ourselves."<ref name=VF/> At a January 2010 closed-door meeting in the White House with liberal activists, Emanuel called them "fucking retarded" for planning to run TV ads attacking conservative Democrats who didn't support Obama's health-care overhaul.

According to Jonathan Alter's book, [[The Promise: President Obama, Year One|''The Promise'']], Emanuel opposed Barack Obama's plan for a broad health care reform, but Obama overrode him. Emanuel advocated a smaller plan because it could get bi-partisan support. Emanuel wanted to expand coverage for children, and increase the number of single mothers eligible for Medicaid. For that reason, it was dubbed "the Titanic plan", a reference to the priority given to saving women and children during the sinking of the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/05/book_rahm_spent_week_aggressiv.html|title=Book: Rahm "begged" Obama for days not to pursue ambitious health reform|first=Greg|last=Sargent|newspaper=Washington Post|date=May 14, 2010|access-date=June 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229191018/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/05/book_rahm_spent_week_aggressiv.html|archive-date=December 29, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Reportedly, House Speaker Pelosi had to convince Obama on the health care initiative after Emanuel dramatically scaled it back.

As chief of staff, Emanuel would make his staff laugh. During a staff meeting, when [[Chief Technology Officer of the United States|Chief Technology Officer]] [[Aneesh Chopra]] gave uniformly upbeat reports, Emanuel is said to have looked at him and said: "Whatever you're taking, I want some."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/01/nation/la-na-rahm-assess-20101001/2|title=Rahm Emanuel's old-school style was key to new presidency|first=Peter|last=Nicholas|date=October 1, 2010|accessdate=October 22, 2012|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114123131/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/01/nation/la-na-rahm-assess-20101001/2|archive-date=November 14, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Emanuel had a hand in war strategy, political maneuvering, communications and economic policy.

In 2010, Emanuel was reported to have conflicts with other senior members of the president's team and ideological clashes over policy. He was also the focal point of criticism from left-leaning Democrats for the administration's perceived move to the center. By September 2010, with the Democrats anticipating heavy losses in mid-term elections, this was said to precipitate Emanuel's departure as chief of staff.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/us-politics/8035615/Pete-Rouse-to-replace-Rahm-Emanuel-as-White-House-chief-of-staff.html|location=London|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Alex|last=Spillius|title=Pete Rouse to replace Rahm Emanuel as White House chief of staff|date=September 30, 2010|access-date=April 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204120126/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/us-politics/8035615/Pete-Rouse-to-replace-Rahm-Emanuel-as-White-House-chief-of-staff.html|archive-date=February 4, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Emanuel's eligibility for office was challenged on the basis of his lack of residency in Chicago for one year prior to the election. This was the period when Emanuel was in Washington serving as the White House chief of staff. The Board of Elections and the [[Cook County Circuit Court]] affirmed his eligibility. A divided Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court, holding on January 24, 2011, that residency for purposes of a candidate is different from residency for purposes of being a voter.<ref>{{cite court|url= http://www.state.il.us/court/Opinions/AppellateCourt/2011/1stDistrict/January/1110033.pdf|litigants= Maksym & McMahon v.

In the race, Emanuel had a financial advantage over the other candidates.<ref name="local2014"/> He was by far the best-financed candidate, with more than procuring more than triple the campaign funds as the second-best financed candidate ([[Gery Chico]]), and more than twenty-times the third-best financed candidate ([[Carol Moseley Braun]]).<ref name="local2014"/> Emanuel's had his financial advantage from the very start of his candidacy, as he began his campaign with approximately $1.2 million from his congressional campaign fund.<ref name="local2014"/> By December 31, 2010 he had raised more than $10.5 million in additional funds.<ref name="local2014"/> On January 1, 2011 the Illinois Campaign Disclosure Act took effect, limiting individual personal contributions to candidates to $5,000.<ref name="local2014"/> Nevertheless, he continued to raise substantial funds, ultimately having procured a total $15 million over the course of his campaign (including those funds transferred from his congressional campaign committee.<ref name="local2014"/> Emanuel was able to raise so much because he had experience fundraising, had built a Washington connections and a national profile, and his brother Ari had Hollywood connections.<ref name="local2014"/> He had 75 contributors give more than $50,000, twenty-five of which were from out of state.<ref name="local2014"/> Among these high-dollar contributors were [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Donald Trump]], and [[Steve Jobs]].<ref name="local2014"/> Despite having a national fundraising operation, three-quarters of his donations came locally.<ref name="local2014"/> More than $800,000 of his contributions were from financial exchange and trading executives, with his largest single donation being a $200,000 donation from executives of the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]].<ref name="local2014"/>

Other candidates assailed his tenure at Freddie Mac.<ref name="local2014"/>

As the frontrunner, Emanuel had gotten more press coverage than other mayoral candidates. This was furthered by the fact that the challenge to his residency became a dominant headline.<ref name="local2014"/>

Emanuel entered the race with solid backing from North and Northwest Side Democratic Ward Committeemen.<ref name="local2014"/>

Emanuel's advertisements showed portrayed him as having strong roots in the city, and, in telling his biography, emphasized his upbringing on the [[North Shore (Chicago)|North Shore]].<ref name="local2014"/> Contrarily, Emanuel's opponents attempted to characterize him as a [[carpetbagger]], hailing not from the city itself but rather from the North Shore and [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name="local2014"/> Emanuel's advertisements also sought to emphasize his tenures in working in the White House and his tenure as a congressman.<ref name="local2014"/> Emanuel would highlight his relations with presidents Clinton and Obama.<ref name="local2014"/> He also sought to highlight the fact that he had forged connections in Washington during his time in congress, and also had strong business ties.<ref name="local2014"/>

Emanuel had overwhelming support from Jewish and [[LGBT]] voters.<ref name="local2014"/> Emanuel held a lead with independent progressives, including strong support from the [[lakefront liberals]] voting bloc of wealthy white progressives from the city's northern lakefront.<ref name="local2014"/> As the only white candidate in the race, Emanuel was seen as likely to receive unified support from a majority of the white electorate.<ref name="local2014"/> Since the hispanic vote was largely split between two hispanic candidates (Gery Chico and [[Miguel del Valle]]), once Emanuel was able to secure the support of the majority of the black vote, he had secured himself victory.<ref name="local2014"/>

In attracting African American voters to his candidacy, Emanuel was helped by his associations with Presidents Clinton and Obama, both of whom were extremely popular among the African American community.<ref name="local2014"/> After Moseley Braun's support began to crater following a character attack on fellow candidate [[Patricia Van Pelt Watkins]] which backfired, Emanuel was the beneficiary as the, largely African American, voters that abandoned their support of Moseley Braun's candidacy primarily migrated to support his candidacy.<ref name="local2014"/> Once this happened, Emanuel had all but secured himself a first-place finish, and the remaining candidates were left to jockey for second-place in hopes of there being a runoff.<ref name="local2014"/>

Emanuel carried the endorsements of both the city's major daily newspapers, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''.<ref name="local2014"/>

Emanuel's mayoral campaign was the inspiration for a satirical [[Twitter]] account called MayorEmanuel, which received more than 43,000 followers, more popular than Emanuel's actual Twitter account.

In August 2012, a federal lawsuit was filed by eleven Chicago police officers alleging they were removed from the mayoral security detail and replaced with officers who worked on Emanuel's mayoral campaign, in violation of the 1983 Shakman Decree, which bars city officials from making political considerations in the hiring process.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/14528066-418/story.html|work=Chicago Sun-Times|title=Cops file suit over demotion from Mayor Emanuel's security detail|date=August 16, 2012|access-date=August 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619131816/http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/14528066-418/story.html|archive-date=June 19, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

On September 17, 2013, Emanuel's appointed [[Chicago Board of Education]] announced the closing of 50 Chicago public schools, 49 elementary schools and a high school — the largest school closure in Chicago history.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-23/news/chi-chicago-school-closings-20130522_1_chicago-teachers-union-byrd-bennett-one-high-school-program|title=CPS approves largest school closure in Chicago's history|date=May 23, 2013|first1=Noreen S.|last1=Ahmed-Ullah|first2=John|last2=Chase|first3=Bob|last3=Secter|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=January 22, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202210325/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-23/news/chi-chicago-school-closings-20130522_1_chicago-teachers-union-byrd-bennett-one-high-school-program|archive-date=February 2, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Public health====
On August 16, 2011, Emanuel unveiled "Healthy Chicago", the city's first  public health blueprint with [[Chicago Department of Public Health]] Commissioner [[Bechara Choucair]].<ref name="Healthy Chicago">{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealthnewswire.org/?p=886|title=Chicago leaders unveil city's first-ever public health blueprint|access-date=October 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005032654/http://www.publichealthnewswire.org/?p=886|archive-date=October 5, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Emanuel initiated the consolidation of City Council committees from 19 to 16 in a cost control effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-258606696.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508153215/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-258606696.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 8, 2013|title=Mayor-Elect Emanuel Announces City Council Reorganization|date=May 11, 2011|accessdate=December 7, 2012|work=HighBeam Research}}</ref> On October 30, 2012, Emanuel voiced his support for the demolition of the abandoned [[Prentice Women's Hospital Building]], in order for [[Northwestern University]], which owns the property, to build a new facility.

====Transparency====
Emanuel rejected requests under the [[Freedom of Information Act (Illinois)|Illinois Freedom of Information Act]] from ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' for various communication and information logs for himself and his staff, labelling it "unduly burdensome". After a second request by the ''Tribune'', they were informed that 90 percent of the e-mails had been deleted by Emanuel and his top aides.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-11-30/news/ct-met-emanuel-fees-records-20111130_1_speed-cameras-vehicle-sticker-rate-hikes|title=Emanuel denies records requests on fee hikes, speed cameras|date=November 30, 2008|accessdate=December 11, 2012|work=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|first=David|last=Kidwell|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508154319/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-11-30/news/ct-met-emanuel-fees-records-20111130_1_speed-cameras-vehicle-sticker-rate-hikes|archive-date=May 8, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> As a result, Emanuel came under fire for going against his campaign promise to create "the most open, accountable, and transparent government that the City of Chicago has ever seen".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2011/12/01/the-most-transparent-government-chicago-has-ever-seen-part-1|title=The most transparent government Chicago has ever seen, part 1|date=December 1, 2011|accessdate=December 11, 2012|work=[[Chicago Reader]]|first=Mick|last=Dumke|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509063437/http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2011/12/01/the-most-transparent-government-chicago-has-ever-seen-part-1|archive-date=May 9, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Tax-exempt status of Lollapalooza====
[[Lollapalooza]], an annual summer music festival in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], was exempt from taxation. Emanuel's brother [[Ari Emanuel|Ari]] is the co-CEO of [[William Morris Endeavor]], which co-owns the event. In 2011 Rahm Emanuel asked the City Council to appoint an independent third party negotiator, to avoid having the negotiation seen as biased. Although the deal was reached before Emanuel took office, tax breaks must be negotiated every year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/7087418-418/emanuel-wants-independent-look-at-lollapalooza-tax-break.html|title=Emanuel wants independent look at Lollapalooza tax break|date=August 16, 2011|accessdate=December 8, 2012|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|first=Fran|last=Spielman|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619061528/http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/7087418-418/emanuel-wants-independent-look-at-lollapalooza-tax-break.html|archive-date=June 19, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> It was later revealed that the festival received its tax exemption for 2011 in the final days of the [[Richard M.

====Hyperloop====
Rahm Emanuel announced preliminary plans to award [[Elon Musk]] a contract to build a Hyperloop between downtown Chicago and the city’s O’Hare airport, although it would receive no public subsidies under this plan. However, some criticized the fact that Elon Musk has in the past donated more than $55,000 to Rahm Emanuel’s various election campaigns, suggesting a potential conflict of interest between the two.<ref>[https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-hyperloop-dreams-slam-into-cold-hard-reality?

====Immigration====
Chicago became a "de jure" [[sanctuary city]] in 2012 when Rahm Emanuel and the City Council passed the Welcoming City Ordinance.<ref>Chicago code [https://chicagocode.org/2/2-173/ Welcoming City Ordinance Chapter 2-173] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810113045/https://chicagocode.org/2/2-173/ |date=August 10, 2018 }}, ''chicagocode.org'' (January 25, 2017).</ref><ref>Welcoming City Ordinance [https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/Office%20of%20New%20Americans/PDFs/WelcomeCityOrdinance.pdf Chapter 2-173 Welcoming City Ordinance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810111213/https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/Office%20of%20New%20Americans/PDFs/WelcomeCityOrdinance.pdf |date=August 10, 2018 }}, ''City of Chicago'' (January 25, 2017).</ref>

===End of tenure===
Emanuel planned to arrange for a smooth transition between his mayoral administration and that of his elected successor [[Lori Lightfoot]]. Reports were that he intended to model the transition between their administrations upon the [[Presidential transition of Barack Obama|U.S. presidential transition between]] the [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]] administrations. Emanuel had been part of that transition as Obama's Chief of Staff designate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sneed|first=Michael|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/mayor-rahm-emanuel-transition-smooth-bush-obama-bolten-election/|title=SNEED: Mayor Rahm Emanuel is modeling his mayoral transition after the seamless handover George W.

Hours after Emanuel left office, the magazine  ''[[The Atlantic]]'', where he had written a dozen essays in prior months, made him a [[contributing editor]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-met-rahm-emanuel-contributing-editor-the-atlantic-20190521-story.html|title=Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has a new gig: Journalist|first=Lisa|last=Donovan|website=chicagotribune.com|access-date=June 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606002154/https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-met-rahm-emanuel-contributing-editor-the-atlantic-20190521-story.html|archive-date=June 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> however, this honorary title was withdrawn after black staff members objected.<ref>{{cite web
