The '''Daytime Emmy Award''' is an American accolade bestowed by the [[New York City|New York]]â€“based [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] in recognition of excellence in American [[daytime television]] programming. Ceremonies generally are held in May or June.

==History==
The first [[Emmy Award]]  ceremony took  place on January 25, 1949. The first daytime-themed [[Emmy Award]]s were given out at the primetime Emmy  awards ceremony in 1972, when ''[[The Doctors (1963 TV series)|The Doctors]]'' and ''[[General Hospital]]'' were nominated for Outstanding Achievement in a Daytime Drama. That year, ''The Doctors'' won the first Best Show Daytime Emmy. In addition, the award for Outstanding Achievement by an Individual in a Daytime Drama was given to [[Mary Fickett]] from ''[[All My Children]]''. A previous category "Outstanding Achievement in Daytime Programming" was added once in 1968 with individuals like ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' star [[Macdonald Carey]] nominated. Due to voting rules of the time, judges could opt to either award one or no Emmy, and in the end they decided that no one nominated was deserving of the golden statuette. This snub outraged then-''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'' writer [[Agnes Nixon]], causing her to write in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "...after viewing the recent fiasco of the Emmy awards, it may well be considered a mark of distinction to have been ignored by this group."<ref>Eckhardt Nixon, Agnes: "They're Happy to Be Hooked" ''[[The New York Times]]'', 7 July 1968 :D13.</ref>

Longtime ''[[General Hospital]]'' star [[John Beradino]] became a leading voice to have daytime talent honored with special recognition for their work. The first separate awards show made just for daytime programming was broadcast in 1974 from the Channel Gardens at Rockefeller Center in New York. The hosts that year were [[Barbara Walters]] and [[Peter Marshall (game show host)|Peter Marshall]]. For years, the gala was held in New York, usually at nearby [[Radio City Music Hall]], with occasional broadcasts from [[Madison Square Garden]]. In 2006, the Daytime Emmys was moved to the [[Kodak Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]], the first time they had ever been held outside of New York.<ref>[http://www.soapcentral.com/soapcentral/news/2005/0912-emmy_hollywood.php "The Daytime Emmys Go Hollywood!"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013062530/http://www.soapcentral.com/soapcentral/news/2005/0912-emmy_hollywood.php |date=2005-10-13 }} SoapCentral.com] 9 September 2005</ref> The Kodak Theatre also hosted the 2007 and 2008 ceremonies, before it was moved again in 2009 to the [[Orpheum Theatre (Los Angeles)|Orpheum Theatre]] across town. In 2010 and 2011, the Daytime Emmys were instead held in [[Las Vegas]]. From 2012 onward, the Daytime Emmys have been held at various venues in Los Angeles, never to return again to New York (most likely as a reflection of the current state of American daytime dramas, where all New York-produced network soap operas have since been cancelled, and the ones left on the air are being recorded in Los Angeles).

Due to the relatively small talent pool in daytime television, it has become common for the same people to be nominated repeatedly. The most infamous of these is ''[[All My Children]]'' star [[Susan Lucci]], whose name became synonymous with being nominated for an award and never winning, after having been nominated 18 times without receiving an award before finally winning a Daytime Emmy for Best Actress in 1999.<ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{cite news|first=Lisa|last=de Moraes|title=For the Primetime Emmys, a Series of Changes|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=2006-07-06|accessdate=2008-08-26|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/05/AR2006070501599.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106221404/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/05/AR2006070501599.html|archive-date=2012-11-06|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2003, in response to heavy criticism of [[Voting bloc|bloc voting]] in favor of shows with the largest casts, an additional voting round was added to all the drama acting categories.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.soapcentral.com/soapcentral/news/2003/0312-emmy_changes.php | title=Emmy nominations process changed to level the field | publisher=[[Soapcentral]] | date=2003-03-12 | accessdate=2010-03-15 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605003542/http://www.soapcentral.com/soapcentral/news/2003/0312-emmy_changes.php | archive-date=2009-06-05 | url-status=live }}</ref> Known as the "pre-nominations", one or two actors from each show is selected to then move on and be considered for the primary nominations for the awards.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=2010 Daytime Emmy Pre-Nominations Announced |url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/features/1948_daytime_emmy_pre_nominations_announced/ |magazine=Soap Opera Digest |quote=Those are the names put forth by each show for consideration to be nominated for the awards. |accessdate=2010-03-15 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

With the rise of [[cable television]] in the 1980s, cable programs first became eligible for the Daytime Emmys in 1989.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-30/entertainment/ca-3020_1_brandon-capwell-lighting-direction-daytime-emmys | title=NBC's 'Santa Barbara' Is Top Daytime Emmy Winner | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=1989-06-30 | accessdate=2015-09-22 | quote=In the first year that they were eligible for Daytime Emmys, cable programs did not win any during Thursday's ceremonies.

In October 2019, as part of several initiatives regarding gender identity, the NATAS decided to replace both the younger actor and actress in a drama categories with a single gender-neutral one for 2020.<ref name="Variety2019">{{cite news|title=Daytime Emmys Combine Young Performer Categories, Clarify Gender Identity Rules|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/daytime-emmys-rules-gender-young-performer-categories-2020-1203388913/|publisher=Variety|date=October 31, 2019|accessdate=November 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105032637/https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/daytime-emmys-rules-gender-young-performer-categories-2020-1203388913/|archive-date=November 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Rules==
Among the Daytime Emmy rules, a show must originally air on American television during the eligibility period between January 1 and December 31. In order to be considered a ''national daytime'' show, the program must air between 2 a.m. and 6 p.m., and to at least 50 percent of the country.<ref name="EmmyRules">{{cite web | url=http://www.daytimeemmys.tv/ | title=39th Daytime Emmys Rules and Procedures | publisher=National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | accessdate=2012-02-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301180603/http://daytimeemmys.tv/ | archive-date=2012-03-01 | url-status=dead }}</ref> A show that enters into the Daytime Emmys cannot also be entered into the [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s or any other national Emmy competition. For [[Broadcast syndication|shows in syndication]], whose air times vary between media markets, they can either be entered in the Daytime or Primetime Emmys (provided they still reach the 50 percent national reach), but not in both.<ref name="PrimetimeEmmyRules">{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.tv/sites/emmys.tv/files/pte11_rulesandproced_rev6.pdf | title=63rd Primetime Emmys Rules and Procedures | publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences | accessdate=2012-03-02 | quote=Syndicated programs that have reached a cumulative audience of at least 50% of the total potential U.S. television audience during the eligibility period, but not 50% exclusively in Daytime or Primetime, may enter either in Daytime or Primetime, but not in both | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815115025/http://www.emmys.tv/sites/emmys.tv/files/pte11_rulesandproced_rev6.pdf | archive-date=2011-08-15 | url-status=dead }}</ref> For game shows that reach the 50 percent threshold, they can be entered into the Daytime Emmys if they normally air before 8 p.m (including the former "[[Prime Time Access Rule|access hour]]" from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.); otherwise, they are only eligible for the Primetime Emmys.<ref name="EmmyRules"/> For [[web television]] shows, they must be available for downloading or streaming to more than 50 percent of the country, and like shows in syndication they can only enter in one of the national Emmy competitions.

Entries must be submitted by late December. Most award categories also require entries to include DVDs or tape masters of the show. For example, most series categories require the submitted DVD to include any one or two episodes that originally aired during the eligibility period.<ref name="EmmyRules"/>

Voting is done by peer judging panels. Any active Academy member, who has national credits for at least two years and within the last five years, is eligible to be a judge. Depending on the category, voting is done using either a ratings score criteria or a preferential scoring system.<ref name="EmmyRules"/>

==Telecast==
The show originally aired during the daytime hours (except for the 1983 and 1984 awards, which weren't televised) but moved to primetime in 1991. For many years, the show was produced by one of its own Lifetime Achievement honorees, [[Dick Clark]]. Each show from 2004 to 2008 was produced by White Cherry Entertainment.

[[NBC]] often aired special primetime episodes of its soaps (such as ''[[Another World: Summer Desire]]'') as a [[Hammocking|lead-in]] to the ceremony. In 2002, 2005, and 2007, CBS aired special primetime editions of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' as a lead-in (the first of which tying into its then-host [[Bob Barker]] being host of the ceremony, and the last being a primetime encore of his final episode as host, which aired earlier in the day).

In August 2009, [[The CW]] broadcast the Daytime Emmys for the first time, due to the other networks declining to carry it (at the time the network did have [[The CW Daytime|one daytime program]], ''[[Judge Jeanine Pirro]]''). The airing delivered the ceremony's lowest ratings ever (0.6/2 in 18â€“49, 2.72m),<ref name=Pigskin>[https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007988.html "Pigskin's kicking in"] ''Variety'', 1 September 2009</ref> but it did outperform The CW's weak averages on the night that summer. The second time around, [[Associated Television International]] brought the 37th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards to CBS, as well as the 38th, the following year. On May 3, 2012, it was announced and confirmed that [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]] would air the 39th ceremony on June 23, 2012.<ref name="39thDaytimeEmmys">{{cite web |url=http://soapoperadigest.com/content/daytime-emmy-update |title=Daytime Emmy Update |work=[[Soap Opera Digest]] |accessdate=2012-05-03 |date=2012-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506035617/http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/daytime-emmy-update |archive-date=2012-05-06 |url-status=live }}</ref> In that ceremony, an additional non-Emmy award was awarded by the program's social media partner, [[AOL]], for Best [[Viral Video]] Series.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} With 912,000 viewers (not counting four repeat broadcasts which brought the total to 2 million), the broadcast was "the most watched regularly scheduled, non-news telecast" ever on HLN, but by far the least-watched Daytime Emmy ceremony ever.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/tv-column/post/daytime-emmy-awards-912000-viewers-sets-record-for-hln-and-franchise--high-and-low-respectively/2012/06/25/gJQA3IHU2V_blog.html |title=Daytime Emmy Awards' 912,000 viewers sets record for HLN and franchise â€” high and low, respectively |last=de Moraes |first=Lisa |work=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=2012-08-04 |date=2012-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705094617/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/tv-column/post/daytime-emmy-awards-912000-viewers-sets-record-for-hln-and-franchise--high-and-low-respectively/2012/06/25/gJQA3IHU2V_blog.html |archive-date=2012-07-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>
