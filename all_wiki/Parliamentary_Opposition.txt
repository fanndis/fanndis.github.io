'''Parliamentary opposition''' is a form of [[opposition (politics)|political opposition]] to a designated government, particularly in a [[Westminster system|Westminster]]-based [[parliamentary system]]. This article uses the term ''[[executive (government)|government]]'' as it is used in Parliamentary systems, i.e. meaning ''the administration'' or ''the cabinet'' rather than ''the state''. The title of "'''Official Opposition'''" usually goes to the largest of the parties sitting in opposition with its leader being given the title "[[Leader of the Opposition]]".

In [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] assemblies, where the [[Duverger's law|tendency]] to gravitate into two major [[political party|parties]] or party groupings operates strongly, ''government'' and ''opposition'' roles can go to the two main groupings serially in alternation.

The more proportional a representative system, the greater the likelihood of multiple political parties appearing in the parliamentary [[Debate chamber|debating chamber]]. Such systems can foster multiple "opposition" parties which may have little in common and minimal desire to form a united bloc opposed to the government of the day.

Some well-organised democracies, [[Dominant-party system|dominated]] long-term by a single faction, reduce their parliamentary opposition to [[tokenism]]. [[Singapore]] exemplifies a case of a numerically weak opposition; [[South Africa]] under the ''apartheid'' regime maintained a long-term imbalance in the parliament. In some cases tame "opposition" parties are created by the governing groups in order to create an impression of democratic debate.
