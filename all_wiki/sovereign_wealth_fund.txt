{{short description|State-owned investment fund}}
{{Public finance}}
A '''sovereign wealth fund''' ('''SWF'''), '''sovereign investment fund''', or '''social wealth fund''' is a state-owned [[investment fund]] that invests in real and financial assets such as [[stock]]s, [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], real estate, [[precious metal]]s, or in alternative investments such as [[private equity fund]] or [[hedge fund]]s. Sovereign wealth funds invest globally. Most SWFs are funded by revenues from commodity exports or from [[foreign-exchange reserves]] held by the [[central bank]].  By historic convention, the United States' [[Social Security Trust Fund]], with US$2.8&nbsp;trillion of assets in 2014, and similar vehicles like [[Japan Post Bank]]'s [[JP¥]]200&nbsp;trillion of holdings, are not considered sovereign wealth funds.

Some sovereign wealth funds may be held by a [[central bank]], which accumulates the funds in the course of its management of a nation's banking system; this type of fund is usually of major economic and fiscal importance.  Other sovereign wealth funds are simply the state savings that are invested by various entities for the purposes of investment return, and that may not have a significant role in fiscal management.

The accumulated funds may have their origin in, or may represent, foreign currency deposits, gold, [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs) and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) reserve positions held by central banks and monetary authorities, along with other national assets such as pension investments, oil funds, or other industrial and financial holdings. These are assets of the sovereign nations that are typically held in domestic and different [[reserve currency|reserve currencies]] (such as the [[United States dollar|dollar]], [[euro]], [[Pound (currency)|pound]], and yen). Such [[investment management]] entities may be set up as official investment companies, state pension funds, or sovereign funds, among others.

There have been attempts to distinguish funds held by sovereign entities from foreign-exchange reserves held by central banks. Sovereign wealth funds can be characterized as ''maximizing long-term return'', with foreign exchange reserves serving short-term "currency stabilization", and liquidity management. Many central banks in recent years possess reserves massively in excess of needs for liquidity or foreign exchange management.  Moreover, it is widely believed most have diversified hugely into assets other than short-term, highly liquid monetary ones, though almost no data is publicly available to back up this assertion. 

==History==
The term "sovereign wealth fund" was first used in 2005 by Andrew Rozanov in an article entitled, "Who holds the wealth of nations?" in the ''Central Banking Journal''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ssga.com/library/esps/Who_Holds_Wealth_of_Nations_Andrew_Rozanov_8.15.05REVCCRI1145995576.pdf|title=Who holds the wealth of nations?|journal=[[Central Banking Journal]] |date=May 2005 |volume=15 |issue=4)|accessdate=2 September 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080529122341/http://www.ssga.com/library/esps/Who_Holds_Wealth_of_Nations_Andrew_Rozanov_8.15.05REVCCRI1145995576.pdf |archivedate = 29 May 2008}}</ref> The previous edition of the journal described the shift from traditional reserve management to sovereign wealth management; subsequently the term gained widespread use as the spending power of global officialdom has rocketed upward.

Some of them have grabbed attention making bad investments in several Wall Street financial firms such as [[Citigroup]], [[Morgan Stanley]], and [[Merrill Lynch]].  These firms needed a cash infusion due to losses resulting from mismanagement and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].

SWFs invest in a variety of asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, private equity and hedge funds.  Many sovereign funds are directly investing in institutional real estate.  According to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute's transaction database around US$9.26&nbsp;billion in direct sovereign wealth fund transactions were recorded in institutional real estate for the last half of 2012.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/11593/sovereign-funds-embrace-direct-real-asset-deals|title=Sovereign Funds Embrace Direct Real Asset Deals|publisher=SWF Institute|date=1 August 2013}}</ref> In the first half of 2014, global sovereign wealth fund direct deals amounted to $50.02&nbsp;billion according to the SWFI.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dunkley |first=Dan |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/08/07/sovereign-wealth-funds-pump-near-record-amount-of-cash-in-deals/ |title=Sovereign-Wealth Funds Pump Near Record Amount of Cash in Deals |work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=8 August 2014|date=7 August 2014 }}</ref>

===Early SWFs===
Sovereign wealth funds have existed for more than a century, but since 2000, the number of sovereign wealth funds has increased dramatically. The first SWFs were non-federal U.S. state funds established in the mid-19th century to fund specific public services.<ref name="academia.edu">M. Nicolas J. Firzli and Joshua Franzel: [https://www.academia.edu/7789625/Non-Federal_Sovereign_Wealth_Funds_in_the_United_States_and_Canada ‘Non-Federal Sovereign Wealth Funds in the United States and Canada’, Revue Analyse Financière, Q3 2014]</ref> The U.S. state of [[Texas]] was thus the first to establish such a scheme, to fund public education. The [[Permanent School Fund]] (PSF) was created in 1854 to benefit primary and secondary schools, with the [[Permanent University Fund]] (PUF) following in 1876 to benefit universities. The PUF was endowed with public lands, the ownership of which the state retained by terms of the 1845 annexation treaty between the [[Republic of Texas]] and the United States. While the PSF was first funded by an appropriation from the state legislature, it also received public lands at the same time that the PUF was created. The first SWF established for a sovereign state is the [[Kuwait Investment Authority]], a commodity SWF created in 1953 from oil revenues before Kuwait gained independence from the United Kingdom. According to many estimates, Kuwait's fund is now worth approximately US$600&nbsp;billion.

Another early registered SWFs is the [[Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund]] of Kiribati. Created in 1956, when the British administration of the [[Gilbert Islands]] in Micronesia put a levy on the export of [[phosphates]] used in [[fertilizer]], the fund has since then grown to $520&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9230598 |title=The world's most expensive club |work=The Economist |date=24 May 2007 }}</ref>

==Nature and purpose==
SWFs are typically created when governments have budgetary surpluses and have little or no international debt. It is not always possible or desirable to hold this excess [[liquidity]] as money or to channel it into immediate consumption. This is especially the case when a nation depends on raw material exports like oil, copper or diamonds. In such countries, the main reason for creating a SWF is because of the properties of resource revenue: high volatility of resource prices, unpredictability of extraction, and exhaustibility of resources.

There are two types of funds: saving funds and stabilization funds. Stabilization SWFs are created to reduce the volatility of government revenues, to counter the boom-bust cycles' adverse effect on government spending and the national economy. Savings SWFs build up savings for future generations.  One such fund is the [[Government Pension Fund of Norway]]. It is believed that SWFs in resource-rich countries can help avoid [[resource curse]], but the literature on this question is controversial. Governments may be able to spend the money immediately, but risk causing the economy to overheat, e.g.,&nbsp;in [[Hugo Chávez]]'s Venezuela or [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]]-era Iran. In such circumstances, saving the money to spend during a period of low inflation is often desirable.

Other reasons for creating SWFs may be economic, or strategic, such as [[war chest]]s for uncertain times. For example, the Kuwait Investment Authority during the [[Gulf War]] managed excess reserves above the level needed for currency reserves (although many central banks do that now). The [[Government of Singapore Investment Corporation]] and [[Temasek Holdings]] are partially the expression of a desire to bolster Singapore's standing as an international financial centre. The [[Korea Investment Corporation]] has since been similarly managed.  Sovereign wealth funds invest in all types of companies and assets, including startups like [[Xiaomi]] and renewable energy companies like Bloom Energy.<ref>{{cite web

 | date=6 January 2015 }}</ref>

According to a 2014 study, SWFs are not created for reasons related to reserve accumulation and commodity-export specialization. Rather, the diffusion of SWF can best understood as a fad whereby certain governments consider it fashionable to create SWFs and are influenced by what their peers are doing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chwieroth|first=Jeffrey M.|date=2014-12-01|title=Fashions and Fads in Finance: The Political Foundations of Sovereign Wealth Fund Creation|url=https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/58/4/752/1815068|journal=International Studies Quarterly|language=en|volume=58|issue=4|pages=752–763|doi=10.1111/isqu.12140|issn=0020-8833}}</ref>

==Concerns about SWFs==
The growth of sovereign wealth funds is attracting close attention because:

* As this asset pool continues to expand in size and importance, so does its potential impact on various asset markets.
* Some countries, like the United States, which passed the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007, worry that foreign investment by SWFs raises national security concerns because the purpose of the investment might be to secure control of strategically important industries for political rather than financial gain.
* Former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury [[Lawrence Summers]] has argued that the U.S. could potentially lose control of assets to wealthier foreign funds whose emergence "shake[s] [the] capitalist logic"<ref name="academia.edu"/> These concerns have led the [[European Union]] (EU) to reconsider whether to allow its members to use "[[golden share]]s" to block certain foreign acquisitions.<ref>{{cite web
 |url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/01/sovereign-wealth-funds-the-new-hedge-fund/
 |title=Sovereign Wealth Funds: The New Hedge Fund?
 |work=The New York Times
 | date=1 August 2007 }}</ref> This strategy has largely been excluded as a viable option by the EU, for fear it would give rise to a resurgence in international protectionism. In the United States, these concerns are addressed by the [[Exon–Florio Amendment]] to the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-418, § 5021, 102 Stat. 1107, 1426 (codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. app. § 2170 (2000)), as administered by the [[Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States]] (CFIUS).
* Their inadequate transparency is a concern for investors and regulators: for example, size and source of funds, investment goals, internal checks and balances, disclosure of relationships, and holdings in private equity funds.
* SWFs are not nearly as homogeneous as central banks or public [[pension fund]]s.
* A lack of transparency and hence an increase in risk to the financial system, perhaps becoming the "new hedge funds".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article1991137.ece |title=IMF concern over 'black box' funds of reserve rich nations |work=[[The Times]] |date=27 June 2007 | location=London | first=Gary | last=Duncan}}</ref>

The governments of SWF's commit to follow certain rules:
* Accumulation rule (what portion of revenue can be spent/saved)
* Withdraw rule (when the Government can withdraw from the fund)
* Investment (where revenue can be invested in foreign or domestic assets)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2011/03/11-sovereign-wealth-funds |title=Rebuilding America: The Role of Foreign Capital and Global Public Investors &#124; Brookings Institution |publisher=Brookings.edu |date=11 March 2011 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}</ref>

===Governmental interest in 2008===
* On 5 March 2008, a joint sub-committee of the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|U.S. House Financial Services Committee]] held a hearing to discuss the role of "Foreign Government Investment in the U.S. Economy and Financial Sector".  The hearing was attended by representatives of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of Treasury]], the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], the [[Federal Reserve Board]], Norway's Ministry of Finance, Singapore's Temasek Holdings, and the [[CPP Investment Board|Canada Pension Plan Investment Board]].
* On 20 August 2008, Germany approved a law that requires parliamentary approval for foreign investments that endanger national interests. To be specific, it affects acquisitions of more than 25% of a German company's voting shares by non-European investors—but the economics minister [[Michael Glos]] has pledged that investment reviews would be "extremely rare." The legislation is loosely modeled on a similar one by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investments. Sovereign wealth funds are also increasing their spend. In fact, the Qatar wealth fund plans to spend $35&nbsp;billion in the US in the next 5 years.{{clarify timeframe|date=August 2020}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Global|first=IndraStra|title=How Are Sovereign Wealth Fund Decisions Made?|url=https://www.indrastra.com/2017/12/How-are-sovereign-wealth-fund-decisions-made-003-12-2017-0022.html|journal=IndraStra|issn=2381-3652}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldfolio.com/news/qatar-to-invest-35bn-in-us-over-5-years/4186/ |title=Qatar to invest $35bn in U.S. over 5 years |publisher=The WorldFolio}}</ref>

===Santiago Principles===
{{See| Santiago Principles}}
There were a number of transparency indices springing out before the Santiago Principles, some more stringent than others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}  To address these concerns some of the world's main SWFs come together in a summit in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]] on 2–3 September 2008, under the leadership of the IMF, they formed a temporary International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds. This working group then drafted the 24 [[Santiago Principles]], to set out a common global set of [[international standard]]s regarding transparency, independence, and accountability in the way that SWFs operate.<ref>[http://www.iwg-swf.org/pubs/eng/santiagoprinciples.pdf Sovereign Wealth Funds: Generally Accepted Principles and Practices (Santiago Principles)], International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds, October 2008</ref><ref name="IFSWF002">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifswf.org/santiago-principles|title=Santiago Principles|author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds|accessdate=27 September 2016}}</ref> These were published after being presented to the IMF International Monetary Financial Committee on 11 October 2008.<ref name="IFSWF002"/> They also considered a standing committee to represent them and so a new organisation, the [[International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds]] (IFSWF) was then set up to maintain the new standards going forward and represent them in international policy debates.<ref name="IFSWF001">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifswf.org/about-us|title=About us|author=International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds|accessdate=27 September 2016}}</ref>

==New SWFs established in developed jurisdictions since 2010==
New SWFs were established in various developed jurisdictions after 2010 following the rise in energy and commodity prices, e.g., the [[North Dakota]] Legacy Fund (2011) and the [[Western Australia]]n Future Fund (2012). The [[Israeli Citizens' Fund]] should start operating in 2020 after several years of preparatory work involving veteran American as well as local [[asset management]] experts.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/israel-natgas-idUSL5N1HC37U |title=Israel natural gas wealth fund expected to begin around 2020 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=4 April 2017}}</ref>

==Size of SWFs==
[[Assets under management]] of SWFs amounted to $8.8&nbsp;trillion as at Sept 14, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://globalswf.com/ |title=Global SWF. Retrieved 2020-09-14 |publisher=globalswf.com |date= |accessdate=14 September 2020}}</ref> There was an additional $18.2&nbsp;trillion held in Public Pension Funds. Taken together, Governments have access to a pool of funds totaling $27&nbsp;trillion. Some of these funds could in future be channelled towards funding development of infrastructure for which there is global demand.

Countries with SWFs funded by oil and gas exports, totaled $5.1&nbsp;trillion as of 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalswf.com/ |title=Fund Rankings &#124; Global SWF |publisher=globalswf.com |date= |accessdate=14 September 2020}}</ref> Non-oil and gas SWFs totaled $3.7&nbsp;trillion. Non-commodity SWFs are typically funded by transfer of assets from official foreign exchange reserves, and in some cases from Government budget surpluses and privatization revenues. Middle Eastern and Asian countries account for 77% of all SWFs.

==Largest sovereign wealth funds==
{{see also|List of countries by sovereign wealth funds|List of countries by foreign-exchange reserves}}
The United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Norway, and Russia all have funds devoted to investing capital from oil and natural gas exports.  Other countries with investment funds are as varied as China, Singapore, Chile, and the Pacific island nation of Kiribati.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emergingindex.com/2010/01/sovereign-investment-funds.html |title=Sovereign Investment Funds |publisher=[[Emerging Index]] |date=17 January 2010 }}</ref>
