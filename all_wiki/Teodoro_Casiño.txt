'''Teodoro A. Casiño''' ({{IPA-tl|kaˈsɪɲo}}, born 15 November 1968), popularly known as '''Teddy Casiño''', is a writer and journalist. He was a member of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] for [[Bayan Muna]].

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Davao City]] to middle class parents, Casiño finished elementary education at the [[De La Salle University]] (DLSU) in 1982. He continued his high school studies at La Salle Green Hills, where his stint as a volunteer for the [[National Movement for Free Elections]] (NAMFREL) in the 1986 snap elections swept him into the politics of People Power via the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]].

The EDSA experience, plus the stories about hunger in [[Negros (island)|Negros]], moved him to forego a DLSU scholarship to study agriculture in [[UP Los Baños]], where he became an activist in his freshman year. He became editor in chief of the student paper, ''The UPLB Perspective'', from 1989–1991 even as he consistently made it to the honor roll.

In 1991, Casiño was elected national president of the College Editors Guild of the Philippines (CEGP), an alliance of over 700 student publications nationwide. He chose to delay his thesis requirement to work full-time for the CEGP. He eventually graduated from UPLB with the degree of BA Sociology in 1993, with his thesis bringing him to faraway Pamplona town in Cagayan Valley, where he studied the impact of Church activism on rural communities.

===Activism===

After his stint in the student movement, Teddy joined the [[Kilusang Mayo Uno]] (KMU - May First Movement). His childhood ambition and his father's wishes for him to become a lawyer gave way to his [[activism]]. In 1996, he entered the UP College of Law only to leave it three days later when it interfered with his work in the KMU.

After four years in the KMU, he joined the [[Bagong Alyansang Makabayan]] (BAYAN), the largest alliance of progressive people's organizations in the country. He was elected secretary general in 1999 and was catapulted to national prominence in 2001 as one of the youngest leaders of EDSA 2.

Casino was appointed commissioner of the EDSA People Power Commission but was removed for constantly being critical of the current administration.<ref>{{cite news|last=Esguerra|first=Christian|title=EDSA Players head new-look People Power Commission|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2479&dat=20010214&id=G342AAAAIBAJ&sjid=hCUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3693,21215981|accessdate=20 March 2013|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=14 February 2001}}</ref>  He had a short stint in ABS-CBN's ''Hoy Gising'' and ''The Correspondents''. In 2002, he was accorded the UPLB Distinguished Alumni Award for Extension.

As a writer, Casino was a regular contributor to the ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'''s Youngblood column from 1994-1996. In 1995, he became a regular columnist for ''Business World'', one of the most respected business newspapers in the country. He also wrote columns for the tabloids ''People's Bagong Taliba'' and ''Frontpage'', the OFW weekly ''Pinoy Gazette'' and the online magazine ''Bulatlat.com''.

==Legislative career==
In the [[May 2004 elections]], Casino was elected as Bayan Muna's representative in Congress.  With the re-election of Bayan Muna in the [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 partylist polls]], he returned to Congress.
