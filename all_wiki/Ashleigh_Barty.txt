'''Ashleigh Barty''' (born 24 April 1996) is an <!--Do not add "Indigenous" or "Aboriginal", as her indigenous heritage is already covered in this section.-->[[Australia|Australian]] professional [[tennis]] player and former [[cricket]]er. She is ranked No. 1 in the world in singles by the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA) and is the second Australian WTA singles No. 1 after fellow Indigenous Australian [[Evonne Goolagong Cawley]].{{efn|[[Margaret Court]] was also ranked No. 1 in singles before the WTA rankings were established in 1975.}} She is also a top 20 player in doubles, having achieved a career-high ranking of No. 5 in the world. Barty has won eight singles titles and ten doubles titles on the WTA Tour, including one Grand Slam singles title at the [[2019 French Open]] and one Grand Slam doubles title at the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open]] with partner [[CoCo Vandeweghe]]. She is also the reigning champion in singles at the [[2019 WTA Finals|WTA Finals]].

Born in [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in [[Queensland]], Barty began playing tennis at the age of four in nearby [[Brisbane]]. She had a promising junior career, reaching a career-high ranking of No. 2 in the world after winning the girls' singles title at [[2011 Wimbledon Championships – Girls' Singles|Wimbledon]] in 2011. As a teenager, Barty had early success in doubles on the WTA Tour in 2013, finishing runner-up at three Grand Slam doubles events with veteran [[Casey Dellacqua]], including at the [[2013 Australian Open|Australian Open]] while still only 16 years old. Late in the 2014 season, Barty decided to take an indefinite break from tennis. She ended up playing cricket during this hiatus, signing with the [[Brisbane Heat Women|Brisbane Heat]] for the inaugural [[Women's Big Bash League]] season despite having no formal training in the sport.

Barty returned to tennis in early 2016. She had a breakout year in singles in 2017, winning her first WTA title at the [[2017 Malaysian Open|Malaysian Open]] and rising to No. 17 in the world despite having never been ranked inside the top 100 before her time off. She also had another prolific year in doubles with Dellacqua, culminating in her first appearance at the [[WTA Finals]] in doubles. Barty then won her first Premier Mandatory and Grand Slam tournament titles in doubles in 2018 before accomplishing the same feat in singles in 2019. She also led [[Australia Fed Cup team|Australia]] to a runner-up finish at the [[2019 Fed Cup]].

Barty is an all-court player who employs a wide variety of shots into her style of play. Despite her short stature for a professional tennis player, she is an excellent server, regularly ranking among the WTA Tour's leaders in aces and percentage of service points won. Barty serves as the National Indigenous Tennis Ambassador for [[Tennis Australia]].

After the 2014 US Open, Barty announced she was "[taking] a break from professional tennis."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com.au/news/2014/09/19/barty-takes-a-break|title=Barty Takes a Break|publisher=Tennis Australia|date=19 September 2014|access-date=20 September 2014}}</ref> She later said that she took time off from tennis because "it was too much too quickly for me as I've been travelling from quite a young age... I wanted to experience life as a normal teenaged girl and have some normal experiences."<ref name=too-quickly-quote/> Barty was ranked outside of the top 200 in singles and was No. 40 in doubles at the time.<ref name=wta-rankings/>

Barty became interested in potentially playing cricket after meeting with the [[Australia women's national cricket team|Australian women's national team]] in early 2015 to discuss her experience as a professional athlete. She was intrigued by the opportunity to play a team sport as a change from the individual sport of tennis. At the time, she had no competitive cricket experience, having only played casually with her family. Barty later approached Queensland Cricket about how she could get involved with the sport. Andy Richards, the coach of the [[Queensland Fire]] and soon-to-be coach of the [[Brisbane Heat (WBBL)|Brisbane Heat]], was immediately impressed with Barty's skill set, saying, "Her skill from the first time she picked up a bat was outstanding from a coach's perspective... She never missed a ball in her first session... That's what attracted me as a coach to her as a player, her ability to pick up things really quickly."<ref name=smh-cricket>{{cite web |title=Ash Barty completes code switch from tennis to cricket |url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/ash-barty-completes-code-switch-from-tennis-to-cricket-20151014-gk8psb.html |website=Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=20 August 2018}}</ref><ref name="guardian-cricket">{{cite web |title=Ash Barty turns back on tennis to play women's cricket for Brisbane Heat |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/14/ash-barty-turns-back-on-tennis-to-play-womens-cricket-for-brisbane-heat |website=The Guardian |access-date=20 August 2018}}</ref><ref name="courier-cricket">{{cite web| url= http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/tennis/ash-barty-chooses-cricket-ahead-of-tennis-as-her-exile-from-the-sport-continues/story-fnii0pkt-1227458518125?sv=6d993fb1cb9ff71bfbb3d98cf5e9d9b3 |title= Ash Barty chooses cricket ahead of tennis as her exile from the sport continues |author= Paul Malone |publisher= The Courier Mail |date= 27 July 2015 |access-date= 14 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ash Barty |url=https://www.cricket.com.au/players/ash-barty/eLjvswVphkW0rMJjPKTwNQ |website=Cricket.com.au |access-date=20 August 2018}}</ref>

===2020: Australian Open semifinal, COVID-19 hiatus===
Barty started her season in her hometown, at the [[2020 Brisbane International|Brisbane International]], as a favourite to win the tournament, but picked up a disappointing second round loss against qualifier [[Jennifer Brady]]. However, she bounced back the following week and captured her first title on home soil at the [[2020 Adelaide International|Adelaide International]], following victories over [[Markéta Vondroušová]] (in a rematch of the 2019 French Open [[2019 French Open – Women's Singles|final]]), [[Danielle Collins]] and [[Dayana Yastremska]] in the final.<ref>{{cite web| title=Barty takes first home title in Adelaide with Yastremska victory | url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/1574534/barty-takes-first-home-title-in-adelaide-with-yastremska-victory | work=WTA Tennis | date = 18 January 2020 | access-date = 19 January 2020}}</ref> After this, Barty entered the [[2020 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]] as one of the favourites to win the title, and as the first Australian woman to ever play the tournament while being the WTA world No. 1. She lost in the semifinals to eventual champion [[Sofia Kenin]], despite having two set points in each of the sets played. Nevertheless, Barty became the first Australian woman to reach the semifinals since [[Wendy Turnbull]] in 1984 and picked up her first top ten win at a major (quarterfinals over [[Petra Kvitová]]).

After taking a rest break, Barty returned to court making her debut at the [[2020 Qatar Total Open|Qatar Open]], the first Premier 5 tournament of the year, where she lost to Kvitová in the semifinals. She next headed to [[2020 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]], but play was suspended before the tournament began due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. WTA tournaments resumed in August, but Barty decided to skip the rest of the year due to concerns related to traveling within the pandemic, which included deciding not to try and defend her [[2020 French Open|French Open]] crown.<ref>{{cite web| title=Ashleigh Barty: French Open champion pulls out of 2020 tournament over coronavirus | url=https://bbc.com/news/world-australia-54068037 | work=BBC | date = 8 September 2020 | access-date = 8 September 2020}}</ref> She finished as the year-end world No. 1 for the second consecutive season due to the change of criteria in the WTA rankings.<ref>{{cite web| title=WTA releases 2020 Year-End Rankings | url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/1898097/wta-releases-2020-year-end-rankings | work=WTA Tennis | date = 16 November 2020 | access-date = 17 November 2020}}</ref>

==National representation==
===Fed Cup===
Barty also made her [[Fed Cup]] debut for Australia in [[2013 Fed Cup|2013]] at the age of 16, playing in two away ties. In their February defeat to the top-seeded [[Czech Republic Fed Cup team|Czech Republic]], she lost the [[dead rubber]] doubles match with Dellacqua.<ref name="2013-fed-cup-loss">{{cite web |title=Fed Cup roundup: Czech Republic beats Australia |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2013/02/10/fed-cup-czech-republic-australia-russia-japan-serbia-slovakia/1906265/ |website=USA Today |access-date=19 August 2018}}</ref> Two months later against [[Switzerland Fed Cup team|Switzerland]], Barty won her only match against No. 56 [[Stefanie Vögele]] to clinch the tie for Australia and keep them in the top-level World Group the following year.<ref name="2013-fed-cup-win">{{cite web |title=Barty brilliant in Fed Cup singles debut |url=https://www.tennis.com.au/news/2013/04/23/barty-brilliant-in-fed-cup-singles-debut |website=Tennis Australia |access-date=19 August 2018}}</ref>

Barty played in two [[2018 Fed Cup|Fed Cup]] ties for Australia in 2018. In their February tie against [[Ukraine Fed Cup team|Ukraine]], she won both of her singles matches as well as the deciding doubles rubber with Dellacqua to carry her team into the World Group playoffs. This turned out to be the last match Barty would play with Dellacqua, as well as the last match of Dellacqua's career before she officially retired in April.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tennis.com.au/news/2018/02/11/barty-and-dellacqua-seal-victory-for-australia|title=Barty and Dellacqua seal victory for Australia |publisher=Tennis Australia|date=11 February 2018|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref><ref name="dellacqua-retires">{{cite web |title=Casey Dellacqua retires from tennis, players pay tribute |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/casey-dellacqua-retires-tennis-players-pay-tribute |website=WTA Tennis |access-date=23 August 2018}}</ref> In the following round, Barty won both of her singles matches against the [[Netherlands Fed Cup team|Netherlands]] to help Australia win the tie 4–1 and advance back into the top-tier World Group in 2019 for the first time in four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tennis.com.au/news/2018/04/22/fed-cup-barty-wins-again-australia-up-2-1|title=Fed Cup day 2: Gavrilova seals victory for Australia |publisher=Tennis Australia|date=22 April 2018|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref>

In the World Group, Barty was instrumental in leading Australia to the [[2019 Fed Cup]] final. She won all six of her rubbers in the first two rounds to help Australia advance against the [[United States Fed Cup team|United States]] and [[Belarus Fed Cup team|Belarus]], with both ties won by a tight score of 3–2. She partnered with [[Priscilla Hon]] in her doubles rubber against the United States, and [[Samantha Stosur]] in the doubles against Belarus.<ref>{{cite web |title=Semifinals await Aussies after Asheville triumph |url=https://www.fedcup.com/en/news/301925.aspx |website=Fed Cup |access-date=10 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ashleigh Barty and Sam Stosur take Australia to Fed Cup final |url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/ashleigh-barty-dominates-aryna-sabalenka-in-fed-cup-semifinal/news-story/4034ac7efe8a6a574860df9ec508cbcf |website=news.com.au |access-date=21 April 2019}}</ref> Australia faced [[France Fed Cup team|France]] in the final, which was played at home at [[Perth Arena]]. Barty continued her Fed Cup success in her first singles rubber with a [[double bagel]] victory over [[Caroline Garcia]]. However, her 15-rubber win streak in Fed Cup came to an end in her next match with a three-set loss to [[Kristina Mladenovic]]. [[Ajla Tomljanović]] won her second singles rubber to set up a decisive doubles rubber between Barty and Stosur for Australia and Garcia and Mladenovic for France.

Barty has represented Australia in the [[Hopman Cup]] twice. She made her first appearance at the event in [[2013 Hopman Cup|2013]] where she competed alongside [[Bernard Tomic]] after Dellacqua withdrew before the tournament due to a foot injury. The Australians finished their round-robin group in second place behind Serbia. They defeated Germany and Italy in their first and last ties, but lost to Serbia in a close tie that was decided by a [[Tennis scoring system#History of the tiebreak|match tiebreak]] in the mixed doubles. During the tie against Italy, Barty won a lopsided singles match against former French Open champion and world No. 35 [[Francesca Schiavone]] in just 55 minutes, the biggest singles win of her career at the time.<ref name=hopman-quote/>

Barty did not return to the tournament until [[2019 Hopman Cup|2019]] where she teamed up with [[Matthew Ebden]]. Australia finished runner-up in their round-robin group again. The pair won their first two ties against France and Spain,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/25637484/australia-beat-france-hopman-cup-opener |website=ESPN |title= Australia beat France in Hopman Cup opener in Perth|access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Aussies clinch tie in a thriller |url=https://hopmancup.com/2019/01/aussies-clinch-tie-in-a-thriller/ |website=Hopman Cup |access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref> but lost both of their singles matches in the decisive tie against the German team of [[Angelique Kerber]] and [[Alexander Zverev]] who won all of their ties and the group.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sascha secures Germany’s repeat final |url=https://hopmancup.com/2019/01/sascha-secures-germanys-repeat-final/ |website=Hopman Cup |access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref>

Barty's short stature and diverse array of shots have led her to be compared to former world No. 1 and five-time Grand Slam singles champion [[Martina Hingis]] by David Taylor, one of Hingis' former coaches.<ref name=hingis>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/australias-ashleigh-barty-compared-with-former-world-no-1-martina-hingis-20140104-30aww.html|title=Australia's Ashleigh Barty compared with former world No. 1 Martina Hingis|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=8 January 2014}}</ref> She has solid [[groundstroke]]s on both the [[forehand]] and [[backhand]] sides. In particular, she uses her powerful forehand to create sharp angles on cross-court shots. Her kick serve and backhand slice are also two of her better shots. Barty's doubles game translates well to singles, as she frequently comes to the net and excels at volleying. She uses her variety of shots to trouble her opponents.<ref name="tennis-view-profile">{{cite web |title=Ashleigh Barty Is Thriving Under A Newfound Level Of Comfort |url=http://www.tennisviewmag.com/tennis-view-magazine/article/ashleigh-barty-thriving-under-newfound-level-comfort |website=Tennis View Magazine |access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=break-explanation-quotes/> Despite her height, Barty is an excellent server. She finished the 2018 season at fourth on the WTA Tour in [[Ace (tennis)|aces]] with a total of 297, nearly five per match.

[[Thanasi Kokkinakis]], one of her compatriot contemporaries as well as one of her mixed doubles partners, has described her game as, "Ash plays different to most girls. She likes to come into the net, she uses her slice very well and she’s crafty. Whereas a lot of girls like to hit the ball hard and flat, she plays a little bit differently, she plays with a bit more control... and she makes things awkward for her opponent."<ref name=kokk-quote/>

Barty and [[Petra Kvitová]] have met nine times, with Barty currently trailing the head-to-head 4–5. They first met in 2012 at the [[2012 French Open|French Open]] where, in her second Grand Slam main draw appearance, Barty was defeated in straight sets. The pair's next clash came more than five years later, in 2017, in the final of [[2017 Aegon Classic|Birmingham]] where Kvitová came back from a set down to claim the title, before replicating a similar victory in the [[2019 Sydney International|Sydney]] final in 2019. They met once more two weeks later in the quarterfinals of the [[2019 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]] where Kvitová moved past Barty in straight sets.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/australian-open/petra-kvitova-is-the-comeback-story-we-should-all-be-cheering-for/news-story/f3a8801736f0124b226bb2434a1bf098 |title=Petra Kvitova is the comeback story we should all be cheering for |access-date=23 January 2019 |date=23 January 2019 |work=news.com.au |archive-date=22 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122122559/https://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/australian-open/petra-kvitova-is-the-comeback-story-we-should-all-be-cheering-for/news-story/f3a8801736f0124b226bb2434a1bf098 |url-status=live }}</ref>

She then recorded a further three consecutive victories – in the quarterfinals of the [[2019 China Open (tennis)|2019 China Open]], in the round-robin stage of the [[2019 WTA Finals]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/oct/31/tennis-wta-finals-ashleigh-barty-petra-kvitova-live |title=WTA Finals: Barty and Bencic through as tearful Bertens retires – as it happened |access-date=1 November 2019 |date=1 November 2019 |work=news.com.au |archive-date=31 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031235150/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/oct/31/tennis-wta-finals-ashleigh-barty-petra-kvitova-live |url-status=live }}</ref> and in the quarterfinals of the [[2020 Australian Open]], the latter two in straight sets.

==Personal life==
Barty took a break from professional tennis from September 2014 until February 2016, and ended up playing semi-professional cricket during the second half of that hiatus. Although she gave no reasons at the time, she later said, "I needed some time to refresh mentally more than anything. It became a bit of a slog for me and I wasn’t enjoying my tennis as much as I would have liked to."<ref name="break-explanation-quotes"/> Her family and coaches all supported her decision.<ref name=smh-profile/> Barty had no intention of retiring and continued to play casually during her hiatus, saying, "It was never in mind that I’d retired as such... I’d been coaching and holding a racket pretty much every day so I wasn’t completely out of practice."<ref name="break-explanation-quotes">{{cite web |title=Rising stars of tennis: Meet Ashleigh Barty – the Aussie youngster back on the WTA tour after season playing Big Bash cricket |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2017/03/21/rising-stars-tennis-meet-ashleigh-barty-aussie-youngster-back/ |website=The Telegraph |access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref> During her time off, she also pursued her hobbies such as fishing; and built a new house close to her family.<ref name=smh-profile/> She ultimately decided to return to the sport, commenting, "After a break and trying other things, I missed tennis and decided that I wanted to come back."<ref name=school-interview/>
