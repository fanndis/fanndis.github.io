'''Rajneesh''' (born '''Chandra Mohan Jain''', 11 December 1931{{spnd}}19 January 1990), also known as '''Acharya Rajneesh''',<ref name="Gordon26-27">{{Harvnb|Gordon|1987|pp=26–27}}</ref> '''Bhagwan Shri Rajneesh''', and later as '''Osho''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|ʃ|oʊ}}), was an Indian [[Godman (India)|godman]],<ref>{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|pp=83–154}}</ref> mystic, and founder of the [[Rajneesh movement]].

During his lifetime, he was viewed as a controversial [[new religious movement]] leader and [[mysticism|mystic]]. In the 1960s, he travelled throughout India as a public speaker and was a vocal critic of [[socialism]], arguing that India was not ready for socialism, and that socialism, communism, and anarchism could evolve only when capitalism had reached its maturity. Rajneesh also criticised [[Mahatma Gandhi]]<ref name="FF1-77" /><ref name="LFC44" /><ref name="JSG26-27" /> and the orthodoxy of mainstream religions. <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://content.ucpress.edu/chapters/12984.ch01.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325163212/https://content.ucpress.edu/chapters/12984.ch01.pdf |archive-date=25 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=150}}</ref><ref name="Joshi 1982 pp=1–4">{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|pp=1–4}}</ref> Rajneesh emphasised the importance of [[meditation]], [[mindfulness]], love, celebration, courage, creativity, and humour—qualities that he viewed as being [[Repression (psychology)|suppressed]] by adherence to static belief systems, religious tradition, and socialisation. In advocating a more open attitude to [[human sexuality]]<ref name="Joshi 1982 pp=1–4"/> he caused controversy in India during the late 1960s and became known as "the sex guru".<ref name="HBU-ZTB82">{{harvnb|Urban|1996|p=82}}</ref><ref name="Carter45">{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=45}}</ref>

In 1970, Rajneesh spent time in [[Mumbai]] initiating followers known as "neo-[[Sannyasa|sannyasins]]". During this period he expanded his spiritual teachings and commented extensively in discourses on the writings of religious traditions, mystics, bhakti poets, and philosophers from around the world. In 1974, Rajneesh relocated to [[Pune]], where an [[ashram]] was established and a variety of therapies, incorporating methods first developed by the [[Human Potential Movement]], were offered to a growing Western following.<ref name=Joshi123>{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=123}}</ref><ref name="BM26">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|pp=26}}</ref> By the late 1970s, the tension between the ruling [[Janata Party]] government of [[Morarji Desai]] and the movement led to a curbing of the ashram's development and a back tax claim estimated at $5&nbsp;million.<ref name="LFC6364">{{harvnb|Carter|1990|pp=63–64}}</ref>

In 1981, the Rajneesh movement's efforts refocused on activities in the United States and Rajneesh relocated to a facility known as [[Rajneeshpuram]] in [[Wasco County]], Oregon. Almost immediately the movement ran into conflict with county residents and the [[State governments of the United States|state government]], and a succession of legal battles concerning the ashram's construction and continued development curtailed its success. In 1985, in the wake of a series of serious crimes by his followers, including a [[1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack|mass food poisoning attack]] with [[Salmonella enterica|salmonella bacteria]] and an [[1985 Rajneeshee assassination plot|aborted assassination plot]] to murder U.S. Attorney [[Charles H. Turner (attorney)|Charles H. Turner]], Rajneesh alleged that his personal secretary [[Ma Anand Sheela]] and her close supporters had been responsible.<ref name="FF2-108" /> He was later [[deportation|deported]] from the United States in accordance with an [[Alford plea]] bargain.<ref name=Latkin342 /><ref>{{Cite news  | last =Staff  | title =Wasco County History  | work =Oregon Historical County Records Guide  | publisher =Oregon State Archives  | url =https://sos.oregon.gov/archives/records/county/Pages/wasco-history.aspx  | accessdate =22 November 2007 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20180612184622/https://sos.oregon.gov/archives/records/county/Pages/wasco-history.aspx  | archive-date =12 June 2018 | url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| last =Staff | title =Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh | work =Newsmakers 1990 | pages =Issue 2 | publisher =Gale Research | year =1990 }}</ref>

== Life ==

===Childhood and adolescence: 1931–1950===
Rajneesh (a childhood nickname from Sanskrit रजनी rajani, night and ईश isha, lord) was born Chandra Mohan Jain, the eldest of 11 children of a cloth merchant, at his maternal grandparents' house in Kuchwada; a small village in the [[Raisen District]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]] state in India.<ref name=Mullan10-11>{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|pp=10–11}}</ref><ref name=Mangalwadi88>{{harvnb|Mangalwadi|1992|p=88}}</ref><ref name="JSG21">{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=21}}</ref> His parents, Babulal and Saraswati Jain, who were [[Taranpanthi]] [[Jainism|Jains]], let him live with his maternal grandparents until he was seven years old.<ref name="BM11">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=11}}</ref> By Rajneesh's own account, this was a major influence on his development because his grandmother gave him the utmost freedom, leaving him carefree without an imposed education or restrictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Osho|1985|p=''passim''}}</ref> When he was seven years old, his grandfather died, and he went to [[Gadarwara]] to live with his parents.<ref name=Mullan10-11 /><ref name=Joshi22-48 /> Rajneesh was profoundly affected by his grandfather's death, and again by the death of his childhood girlfriend and cousin Shashi from [[typhoid]] when he was 15, leading to a preoccupation with death that lasted throughout much of his childhood and youth.<ref name=Joshi22-48>{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|pp=22–25, 31, 45–48}}</ref><ref name="JSG22">{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=22}}</ref> In his school years, he was a gifted and rebellious student, and gained a reputation as a formidable debater.<ref name="FF1-77">{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986a|p=77}}</ref> Rajneesh became critical of traditional religion, took an interest in many methods to expand consciousness, including [[Pranayama|breath control]], yogic exercises, meditation, fasting, the occult, and hypnosis. He became briefly associated with [[socialism]] and two [[Indian independence movement|Indian nationalist organisations]]: the [[Indian National Army]] and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]].<ref name="FF1-77" /><ref name="JSG23">{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=23}}</ref><ref name=Joshi38>{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=38}}</ref> However, his membership in the organisations was short-lived as he could not submit to any external discipline, ideology, or system.<ref>{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=11}}</ref>

=== University years and public speaker: 1951–1970 ===
In 1951, aged 19, Rajneesh began his studies at Hitkarini College in [[Jabalpur]].<ref>{{harvnb|Süss|1996|p=29}}</ref> Asked to leave after conflicts with an instructor, he transferred to D. N. Jain College, also in Jabalpur.<ref name=Carter43>{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=43}}</ref> Having proved himself to be disruptively argumentative, he was not required to attend college classes at D. N. Jain College except for examinations and used his free time to work for a few months as an assistant editor at a local newspaper.<ref name=Joshi50>{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=50}}</ref> He began speaking in public at the annual ''[[Sarva Dharma Sammelan]]'' (Meeting of all faiths) held at Jabalpur, organised by the Taranpanthi Jain community into which he was born, and participated there from 1951 to 1968.<ref>Smarika, ''Sarva Dharma Sammelan'', 1974, ''[[Taran Panth|Taran Taran Samaj]]'', Jabalpur</ref> He resisted his parents' pressure to marry.<ref name="LT15">(1985) Interview with Howard Sattler, 6PR Radio, Australia, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ocbZhRQS9I video available here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130174649/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ocbZhRQS9I |date=30 November 2016 }}. Retrieved 10 July 2011.</ref> Rajneesh later said he became spiritually enlightened on 21 March 1953, when he was 21 years old, in a mystical experience while sitting under a tree in the Bhanvartal garden in Jabalpur.<ref name="BM12">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=12}}</ref>

Having completed his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in philosophy at D. N. Jain College in 1955, he joined the [[University of Sagar]], where in 1957 he earned his [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|MA]] in philosophy (with distinction).<ref name=Joshi185>{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=185}}</ref> He immediately secured a teaching position at [[Raipur]] Sanskrit College, but the vice-chancellor soon asked him to seek a transfer as he considered him a danger to his students' morality, character, and religion.<ref name="LFC44" /> From 1958, he taught philosophy as a lecturer at [[Jabalpur University]], being promoted to professor in 1960.<ref name="LFC44" /> A popular lecturer, he was acknowledged by his peers as an exceptionally intelligent man who had been able to overcome the deficiencies of his early small-town education.<ref name="JSG25">{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=25}}</ref>

In parallel to his university job, he travelled throughout India under the name Acharya Rajneesh (''[[Acharya]]'' means teacher or professor; Rajneesh was a nickname he had acquired in childhood), giving lectures critical of [[socialism]], [[Gandhi]], and institutional religions.<ref name="FF1-77" /><ref name="LFC44" /><ref name="JSG26-27">{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|pp=26–27}}</ref> He said that socialism would socialise only poverty, and he described Gandhi as a [[self-defeating personality disorder|masochist]] reactionary who worshipped poverty.<ref name="FF1-77" /><ref name="JSG26-27" /> What India needed to escape its backwardness was [[capitalism]], science, modern technology, and [[birth control]].<ref name="FF1-77" /> He criticised orthodox Indian religions as dead, filled with empty ritual, oppressing their followers with fears of damnation and promises of blessings.<ref name="FF1-77" /><ref name="JSG26-27" /> Such statements made him controversial, but also gained him a loyal following that included a number of wealthy merchants and businessmen.<ref name="FF1-77" /><ref name="Lewis122">{{harvnb|Lewis|Petersen|2005|p=122}}</ref> These sought individual consultations from him about their spiritual development and daily life, in return for donations—a conventional arrangement in India—and his practice snowballed.<ref name="Lewis122" /> From 1962, he began to lead 3- to 10-day meditation camps, and the first meditation centres (Jivan Jagruti Kendra) started to emerge around his teaching, then known as the Life Awakening Movement (Jivan Jagruti Andolan).<ref name="ASIMA">{{harvnb|Osho|2000|p=224}}</ref> After a controversial speaking tour in 1966, he resigned from his teaching post at the request of the university.<ref name="LFC44">{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=44}}</ref>

In a 1968 lecture series, later published under the title ''From Sex to Superconsciousness'', he scandalised [[Hindu]] leaders by calling for freer acceptance of sex and became known as the "sex guru" in the Indian press.<ref name="Carter45" /><ref name="Joshi 1982 pp=1–4" /> When in 1969 he was invited to speak at the Second World Hindu Conference, despite the misgivings of some Hindu leaders, his statements raised controversy again when he said, "Any religion which considers life meaningless and full of misery and teaches the hatred of life, is not a true religion. Religion is an art that shows how to enjoy life."<ref name="Joshi88">{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=88}}</ref> He compared the treatment of lower caste [[shudra]]s and women with the treatment of animals.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-XbBB3bOn4C&q=osho+patna+second+world+hindu+conference&pg=PA271|title=The Rebellious Enlightened Master Osho|last=Bhed|first=Gyan|year=2006|publisher=Fusion books|pages=273|location=New Dehli|isbn=81-8419-047-6}}</ref> He characterised [[brahmin]] as being motivated by self-interest, provoking the ''[[Shankaracharya]]'' of [[Puri]], who tried in vain to have his lecture stopped.<ref name="Joshi88" />

=== Mumbai: 1970–1974 ===
At a public meditation event in early 1970, Rajneesh presented his Dynamic Meditation method for the first time.<ref name=LFC46>{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=46}}</ref> Dynamic Meditation involved breathing very fast and celebrating with music and dance.<ref name="Handa 2020">{{cite web | last=Handa | first=Mohini | title=Orangebook Osho Discourses | website=Internet Archive | date=10 June 2020 | url=https://archive.org/details/orangebookoshodiscourses_517_Y | access-date=20 June 2020}}</ref> He left Jabalpur for [[Mumbai]] at the end of June.<ref name="Joshi94103">{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|pp=94–103}}</ref> On 26 September 1970, he initiated his first group of disciples or [[neo-sannyasins]].<ref name="LFC47">{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=47}}</ref> Becoming a disciple meant assuming a new name and wearing the traditional orange dress of [[asceticism|ascetic]] Hindu holy men, including a [[Hindu prayer beads|''mala'']] (beaded necklace) carrying a locket with his picture.<ref name="FF1-78" /> However, his sannyasins were encouraged to follow a celebratory rather than ascetic lifestyle.<ref name="JSG32-33">{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|pp=32–33}}</ref> He himself was not to be worshipped but regarded as a [[catalyst|catalytic agent]], "a sun encouraging the flower to open".<ref name="JSG32-33" />

He had by then acquired a secretary, Laxmi Thakarsi Kuruwa, who as his first disciple had taken the name Ma Yoga Laxmi.<ref name="FF1-77" /> Laxmi was the daughter of one of his early followers, a wealthy Jain who had been a key supporter of the [[Indian National Congress]] during the struggle for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], with close ties to [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]], and [[Morarji Desai]].<ref name="FF1-77" /> She raised the money that enabled Rajneesh to stop his travels and settle down.<ref name="FF1-77" /> In December 1970, he moved to the Woodlands Apartments in Mumbai, where he gave lectures and received visitors, among them his first Western visitors.<ref name="Joshi94103" /> He now travelled rarely, no longer speaking at open public meetings.<ref name="Joshi94103" /> In 1971, he adopted the title "Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh".<ref name="FF1-78" /> ''[[Sri|Shree]]'' is a polite form of address roughly equivalent to the English "Sir"; ''[[Bhagwan]]'' means "blessed one", used in Indian traditions as a term of respect for a human being in whom the divine is no longer hidden but apparent. Later, when he changed his name, he would redefine the meaning of Bhagwan.<ref name="Süss29-30">{{harvnb|Süss|1996|pp=29–30}}</ref><ref>[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?query=bhagavan&display=simple&table=macdonell Macdonell Practical Sanskrit Dictionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017031501/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?query=bhagavan&display=simple&table=macdonell |date=17 October 2015 }} (see entry for ''bhagavat'', which includes ''bhagavan'' as the [[vocative]] case of ''bhagavat'').

=== Pune ashram: 1974–1981 ===
The humid climate of Mumbai proved detrimental to Rajneesh's health: he developed [[diabetes]], [[asthma]], and numerous [[allergy|allergies]].<ref name="FF1-78">{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986a|p=78}}</ref> In 1974, on the 21st anniversary of his experience in Jabalpur, he moved to a property in [[Koregaon Park]], Pune, purchased with the help of Ma Yoga Mukta (Catherine Venizelos), a Greek shipping heiress.<ref name="FF1-87">{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986a|p=87}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Carter|1990|pp=48–54}}</ref> Rajneesh spoke at the Pune ashram from 1974 to 1981. The two adjoining houses and {{convert|6|acre|ha}} of land became the nucleus of an [[ashram]], and the property is still the heart of the present-day OSHO International Meditation Resort. It allowed the regular audio recording and, later, video recording and printing of his discourses for worldwide distribution, enabling him to reach far larger audiences. The number of Western visitors increased sharply.<ref name="FF1-80" /> The ashram soon featured an arts-and-crafts centre producing clothes, jewellery, ceramics, and organic cosmetics and hosted performances of theatre, music, and mime.<ref name="FF1-80">{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986a|p=80}}</ref> From 1975, after the arrival of several therapists from the [[Human Potential Movement]], the ashram began to complement meditations with a growing number of therapy groups,<ref name="Joshi123"/><ref name="BM26"/> which became a major source of income for the ashram.<ref name="JMF16-17">{{harvnb|Fox|2002|pp=16–17}}</ref><ref name="FF1-82-83">{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986a|pp=82–83}}</ref>

The Pune ashram was by all accounts an exciting and intense place to be, with an emotionally charged, madhouse-carnival atmosphere.<ref name="FF1-80" /><ref name="JMF18">{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=18}}</ref><ref name="JSG76-78">{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|pp=76–78}}</ref> The day began at 6:00&nbsp;a.m. with Dynamic Meditation.<ref name="TLS192">{{harvnb|Aveling|1994|p=192}}</ref><ref name="BM24-25">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|pp=24–25}}</ref> From 8:00&nbsp;am, Rajneesh gave a 60- to 90-minute spontaneous lecture in the ashram's "Buddha Hall" auditorium, commenting on religious writings or answering questions from visitors and disciples.<ref name="FF1-80" /><ref name="BM24-25" /> Until 1981, lecture series held in [[Hindi]] alternated with series held in English.<ref name=Mehta93>{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=93}}</ref> During the day, various meditations and therapies took place, whose intensity was ascribed to the spiritual energy of Rajneesh's "buddhafield".<ref name="JMF18" /> In evening ''[[Darśana|darshans]]'', Rajneesh conversed with individual disciples or visitors and initiated disciples ("gave sannyas").<ref name="FF1-80" /><ref name="BM24-25" /> Sannyasins came for ''darshan'' when departing or returning or when they had anything they wanted to discuss.<ref name="FF1-80" /><ref name="BM24-25" />

To decide which therapies to participate in, visitors either consulted Rajneesh or selected according to their own preferences.<ref name="TLS193">{{harvnb|Aveling|1994|p=193}}</ref> Some of the early therapy groups in the ashram, such as the [[encounter group]], were experimental, allowing a degree of physical aggression as well as sexual encounters between participants.<ref name="FF1-83">{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986a|p=83}}</ref><ref name="NYT131181">{{harvnb|Maslin|1981|p=}}</ref> Conflicting reports of injuries sustained in Encounter group sessions began to appear in the press.<ref>Karlen, N., Abramson, P.: ''Bhagwan's realm'', ''Newsweek'', 3 December 1984.

[[Sannyasin]]s who had "graduated" from months of meditation and therapy could apply to work in the ashram, in an environment that was consciously modelled on the community the Russian mystic [[Gurdjieff]] led in France in the 1930s.<ref name="Clarke466">{{harvnb|Clarke|2006|p=466}}</ref> Key features incorporated from Gurdjieff were hard, unpaid labour, and supervisors chosen for their abrasive personality, both designed to provoke opportunities for self-observation and transcendence.<ref name="Clarke466" /> Many disciples chose to stay for years.<ref name="Clarke466" /> Besides the controversy around the therapies, allegations of drug use amongst sannyasin began to mar the ashram's image.<ref name="Paradise" /> Some Western sannyasins were alleged to be financing extended stays in India through prostitution and drug-running.<ref name="JSG71">{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=71}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sam|1997|pp=57–58, 80–83, 112–114}}</ref> A few people, later alleged that while Rajneesh was not directly involved, they discussed such plans and activities with him in ''darshan'' and he gave his blessing.<ref name="JMF47">{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=47}}</ref>

By the latter 1970s, the Pune ashram was too small to contain the rapid growth and Rajneesh asked that somewhere larger be found.<ref name="FF1-85" /> Sannyasins from around India started looking for properties: those found included one in the province of [[Kutch]] in Gujarat and two more in India's mountainous north.<ref name="FF1-85" /> The plans were never implemented as mounting tensions between the ashram and the [[Janata Party]] government of [[Morarji Desai]] resulted in an impasse.<ref name="FF1-85" /> Land-use approval was denied and, more importantly, the government stopped issuing visas to foreign visitors who indicated the ashram as their main destination.<ref name="FF1-85" /><ref>{{harvnb|Goldman|1991}}</ref> Besides, Desai's government cancelled the tax-exempt status of the ashram with retrospective effect, resulting in a claim estimated at $5&nbsp;million.<ref name="LFC6364"/> Conflicts with various Indian religious leaders aggravated the situation—by 1980 the ashram had become so controversial that [[Indira Gandhi]], despite a previous association between Rajneesh and the [[Indian National Congress|Indian Congress Party]] dating back to the sixties, was unwilling to intercede for it after her return to power.<ref name="LFC6364" /> In May 1980, during one of Rajneesh's discourses, an attempt on his life was made by Vilas Tupe, a young Hindu [[fundamentalist]].<ref name="FF1-85" /><ref name="FF1-227">{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986a|p=227}}</ref><ref name="retard">{{cite news

====Establishing Rajneeshpuram====
On 13 June 1981, Sheela's husband, John Shelfer, signed a purchase contract to buy property in [[Oregon]] for [[United States dollar|US$]]5.75&nbsp;million, and a few days later assigned the property to the US foundation. The property was a {{convert|64229|acre|km2|-1|adj=on}} ranch, previously known as "The Big Muddy Ranch" and located across two counties ([[Wasco County, Oregon|Wasco]] and [[Jefferson County, Oregon|Jefferson]]).<ref name=Carter133>{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=133}}</ref> It was renamed "Rancho Rajneesh" and Rajneesh moved there on 29 August.<ref name=Carter136138>{{harvnb|Carter|1990|pp=136–138}}</ref> Initial local community reactions ranged from hostility to tolerance, depending on distance from the ranch.<ref>{{harvnb|Abbott|1990|p=79}}</ref> The press reported, and another study found, that the development met almost immediately with intense local, state, and federal opposition from the government, press, and citizenry.

As to "preconceived intent", at the time of the investigation and prosecution, federal court appellate cases and the INS regulations permitted "dual intent", a desire to stay, but a willingness to comply with the law if denied permanent residence.

=== Travels and return to Pune: 1985–1990 ===
Following his exit from the US, Rajneesh returned to India, landing in Delhi on 17 November 1985. He was given a hero's welcome by his Indian disciples and denounced the United States, saying the world must "put the monster America in its place" and that "Either America must be hushed up or America will be the end of the world."<ref>{{Cite news

When non-Indians in his party had their visas revoked, he moved on to [[Kathmandu]], Nepal, and then, a few weeks later, to [[Crete]]. Arrested after a few days by the [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|Greek National Intelligence Service]] (KYP), he flew to [[Geneva]], then to [[Stockholm]] and London, but was in each case refused entry. Next Canada refused landing permission, so his plane returned to [[Shannon, County Clare|Shannon]] airport, Ireland, to refuel. There he was allowed to stay for two weeks at a hotel in [[Limerick]], on condition that he did not go out or give talks. He had been granted a Uruguayan identity card, one-year provisional residency and a possibility of permanent residency, so the party set out, stopping at [[Madrid]], where the plane was surrounded by the ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]''. He was allowed to spend one night at [[Dakar]], then continued to [[Recife]] and [[Montevideo]]. In Uruguay, the group moved to a house at [[Punta del Este]] where Rajneesh began speaking publicly until 19 June, after which he was "invited to leave" for no official reason. A two-week visa was arranged for Jamaica, but on arrival in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] police gave the group 12 hours to leave. Refuelling in [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander]] and in Madrid, Rajneesh returned to Bombay, India, on 30 July 1986.<ref>{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=241}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Shunyo|1993|pp=121, 131, 151}}</ref>

=== Death ===
Rajneesh died on 19 January 1990, aged 58, at the ashram in [[Pune]], India.

== Teachings ==
Rajneesh's teachings, delivered through his discourses, were not presented in an academic setting, but interspersed with jokes.<ref name="JMF1-2">{{harvnb|Fox|2002|pp=1–2}}</ref><ref name="BM1">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=1}}</ref> The emphasis was not static but changed over time: Rajneesh revelled in paradox and contradiction, making his work difficult to summarise.<ref name="JMF2">{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=1}}</ref> He delighted in engaging in behaviour that seemed entirely at odds with traditional images of enlightened individuals; his early lectures in particular were famous for their humour and their refusal to take anything seriously.<ref name="JMF6" /><ref name="HBU-ZTB169" /> All such behaviour, however capricious and difficult to accept, was explained as "a technique for transformation" to push people "beyond the mind".<ref name="JMF6" />

He spoke on major spiritual traditions including [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Hassidism]], [[Tantrism]], [[Taoism]], [[Sufism]], Christianity, [[Buddhism]], on a variety of Eastern and Western mystics and on sacred scriptures such as the ''[[Upanishads]]'' and the ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]''.<ref name="BM33" /> The sociologist Lewis F. Carter saw his ideas as rooted in Hindu [[advaita]], in which the human experiences of separateness, duality and temporality are held to be a kind of dance or play of cosmic consciousness in which everything is sacred, has absolute worth and is an end in itself.<ref name=Carter267>{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=267}}</ref> While his contemporary [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] did not approve of Rajneesh, there are clear similarities between their respective teachings.<ref name="JMF2"/>

Rajneesh also drew on a wide range of Western ideas.<ref name="BM33">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=33}}</ref> His belief in the [[unity of opposites]] recalls [[Heraclitus]], while his description of man as a machine, condemned to the helpless acting out of unconscious, neurotic patterns, has much in common with [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[George Gurdjieff]].<ref name="JMF2"/><ref>{{harvnb|Prasad|1978|pp=14–17}}</ref> His vision of the "new man" transcending constraints of convention is reminiscent of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'';<ref name="CLFNR">{{harvnb|Carter|1987|p=}}, reprinted in {{harvnb|Aveling|1999|p=209}}</ref> his promotion of [[sexual liberation]] bears comparison to [[D.

=== Ego and the mind ===
According to Rajneesh every human being is a ''[[Buddha]]'' with the capacity for [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], capable of unconditional love and of responding rather than reacting to life, although the ego usually prevents this, identifying with social conditioning and creating false needs and conflicts and an illusory sense of identity that is nothing but a barrier of dreams.<ref name="JMF3">{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=3}}</ref><ref name="HBU-ZTB171">{{harvnb|Urban|1996|p=171}}</ref><ref name=Wallis131>{{harvnb|Wallis|1986|p=}}, reprinted in {{harvnb|Aveling|1999|pp=130–133}}</ref> Otherwise man's innate being can flower in a move from the periphery to the centre.<ref name="JMF3"/><ref name=Wallis131 />

Rajneesh viewed the mind first and foremost as a mechanism for survival, replicating behavioural strategies that have proven successful in the past.<ref name="JMF3"/><ref name="Wallis131" /> But the mind's appeal to the past, he said, deprives human beings of the ability to live authentically in the present, causing them to repress genuine emotions and to shut themselves off from joyful experiences that arise naturally when embracing the present moment: "The mind has no inherent capacity for joy. ... It only thinks about joy."<ref name=Wallis131 /><ref name="JMF3-4">{{harvnb|Fox|2002|pp=3–4}}</ref> The result is that people poison themselves with all manner of [[neurosis|neuroses]], [[jealousy|jealousies]], and insecurities.<ref name="JMF4" /> He argued that [[psychological repression]], often advocated by religious leaders, makes suppressed feelings re-emerge in another guise, and that sexual repression resulted in societies obsessed with sex.<ref name="JMF4">{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=4}}</ref> Instead of suppressing, people should trust and accept themselves unconditionally.<ref name=Wallis131 /><ref name="JMF3-4" /> This should not merely be understood intellectually, as the mind could only assimilate it as one more piece of information: instead [[meditation]] was needed.<ref name="JMF4" />

=== Meditation ===
Rajneesh presented meditation not just as a practice but as a state of awareness to be maintained in every moment, a total awareness that awakens the individual from the sleep of mechanical responses conditioned by beliefs and expectations.<ref name=Wallis131 /><ref name="JMF4" /> He employed Western [[psychotherapy]] in the preparatory stages of meditation to create awareness of mental and emotional patterns.<ref name="JMF5" />

He suggested more than a hundred meditation techniques in total.<ref name="JMF5" /><ref name="HBU-ZTB172" /> His own "active meditation" techniques are characterised by stages of physical activity leading to silence.<ref name="JMF5">{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=5}}</ref> The most famous of these remains Dynamic Meditation™,<ref name="JMF5" /><ref name="HBU-ZTB172" /> which has been described as a kind of microcosm of his outlook.<ref name="HBU-ZTB172">{{harvnb|Urban|1996|p=172}}</ref> Performed with closed or blindfolded eyes, it comprises five stages, four of which are accompanied by music.<ref name="Gordon3-8">{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|pp=3–8}}</ref> First the meditator engages in ten minutes of rapid breathing through the nose.<ref name="Gordon3-8" /> The second ten minutes are for [[catharsis]]: "Let whatever is happening happen. ... Laugh, shout, scream, jump, shake—whatever you feel to do, do it!"<ref name="JMF5" /><ref name="Gordon3-8" /> Next, for ten minutes one jumps up and down with arms raised, shouting Hoo! each time one lands on the flat of the feet.<ref name="Gordon3-8" /><ref name="MFLM35">{{harvnb|Osho|2004|p=35}}</ref> At the fourth, silent stage, the meditator stops moving suddenly and totally, remaining completely motionless for fifteen minutes, witnessing everything that is happening.<ref name="Gordon3-8" /><ref name="MFLM35" /> The last stage of the meditation consists of fifteen minutes of dancing and celebration.<ref name="Gordon3-8" /><ref name="MFLM35" />

Rajneesh developed other active meditation techniques, such as the [[Kundalini]] "shaking" meditation and the Nadabrahma "humming" meditation, which are less animated, although they also include physical activity of one sort or another.<ref name="JMF5" /> His later "meditative therapies" require sessions for several days, OSHO Mystic Rose comprising three hours of laughing every day for a week, three hours of weeping each day for a second week, and a third week with three hours of silent meditation.<ref name="TLS198">{{harvnb|Aveling|1994|p=198}}</ref> These processes of "witnessing" enable a "jump into awareness".<ref name="JMF5" /> Rajneesh believed such cathartic methods were necessary because it was difficult for modern people to just sit and enter meditation. Once these methods had provided a glimpse of meditation, then people would be able to use other methods without difficulty.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== ''Sannyas'' ===
Another key ingredient was his own presence as a [[Guru|master]]: "A Master shares his being with you, not his philosophy. ... He never does anything to the disciple."<ref name="JMF6">{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=6}}</ref> The initiation he offered was another such device: "... if your being can communicate with me, it becomes a communion. ... It is the highest form of communication possible: a transmission without words. Our beings merge. This is possible only if you become a disciple."<ref name="JMF6" /> Ultimately though, as an explicitly "self-parodying" guru, Rajneesh even deconstructed his own authority, declaring his teaching to be nothing more than a "game" or a joke.<ref name="HBU-ZTB169" /><ref name="HBU-ZTB170">{{harvnb|Urban|1996|p=170}}</ref> He emphasised that anything and everything could become an opportunity for meditation.<ref name="JMF6" />

=== Renunciation and the "New Man" ===
Rajneesh saw his "neo-sannyas" as a totally new form of spiritual discipline, or one that had once existed but since been forgotten.<ref name="Aveling94-86">{{harvnb|Aveling|1994|p=86}}</ref> He thought that the traditional Hindu [[sannyas]] had turned into a mere system of social renunciation and imitation.<ref name="Aveling94-86" /> He emphasised complete inner freedom and the responsibility to oneself, not demanding superficial behavioural changes, but a deeper, inner transformation.<ref name="Aveling94-86" /> Desires were to be accepted and surpassed rather than denied.<ref name="Aveling94-86" /> Once this inner flowering had taken place, desires such as that for sex would be left behind.<ref name="Aveling94-86" />

Rajneesh said that he was "the rich man's guru" and that material poverty was not a genuine spiritual value.<ref name="Gordon114">{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=114}}</ref> He had himself photographed wearing sumptuous clothing and hand-made watches<ref name="TOI3104">{{cite news|author=Neil Pate |date=3 January 2004 |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/403145.cms |title=Celluloid Rajneesh, quite a hit |work=The Times of India |accessdate=11 July 2011 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429204538/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/403145.cms |archive-date=29 April 2012 }}</ref> and, while in Oregon, drove a different [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]] each day&nbsp;– his followers reportedly wanted to buy him 365 of them, one for each day of the year.<ref name="Hindu">Ranjit Lal, (16 May 2004).

Rajneesh aimed to create a "new man" combining the spirituality of [[Gautama Buddha]] with the zest for life embodied by [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]' ''[[Zorba the Greek]]'': "He should be as accurate and objective as a scientist ... as sensitive, as full of heart, as a poet ...

=== Euthanasia and Eugenics ===
{{over-quotation|date=April 2019}}

Rajneesh spoke many times of the dangers of [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], and advocated universal legalisation of contraception and abortion. He described the religious prohibitions thereof as criminal, and argued that the United Nations' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|declaration]] of the human "[[right to life]]" played into the hands of religious campaigners.
According to Rajneesh, one has no right to knowingly inflict a lifetime of suffering: life should begin only at birth, and even then, "If a child is born [[deaf-mute|deaf, dumb]], and we cannot do anything, and the parents are willing, the child should be put to eternal sleep" rather than "take the risk of burdening the earth with a crippled, blind child."{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} He argued that this simply freed the soul to inhabit a healthy body instead: "Only the body goes back into its basic elements; the soul will fly into another womb. Nothing is destroyed. If you really love the child, you will not want him to live a seventy-year-long life in misery, suffering, sickness, old age. So even if a child is born, if he is not medically capable of enjoying life fully with all the senses, healthy, then it is better that he goes to eternal sleep and is born somewhere else with a better body."{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

He stated that the decision to have a child should be a medical matter, and that oversight of population and genetics must be kept in the realm of science, outside of politicians' control: "If genetics is in the hands of Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, what will be the fate of the world?" He believed that in the right hands, these measures could be used for good: "Once we know how to change the program, thousands of possibilities open up. We can give every man and woman the best of everything. There is no need for anyone to suffer unnecessarily. Being retarded, crippled, blind, ugly – all these will be possible to change."<ref name="avaible">Osho, ''The Greatest Challenge: The Golden Future'', [http://www.osho.com/read/osho/vision/the-greatest-challenge-the-golden-future/birth-control-and-genetic-engineering available] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206164409/http://www.osho.com/read/osho/vision/the-greatest-challenge-the-golden-future/birth-control-and-genetic-engineering |date=6 February 2018 }} here</ref>

"Science has been a dagger driven into the back of nature. Philosophers have not done much harm—they cannot because they are absolute failures—but science has done much harm. Now the greatest enemy today is science. And why it has been so harmful? – because from the very beginning enmity has been at the base. Hatred, not love...enmity with life, not friendship. Science has created the idea in humanity that they have been teaching survival of the fittest – as if life is just a struggle! The fact is otherwise, just the contrary. Life is a vast cooperation."

"So the first thing to be understood is: All ideals are perfectionist. Hence, ALL ideals are inhuman.

And all ideals cripple and paralyse you. All ideals create a kind of subtle bondage around you, they imprison you. The really free man has no ideals."

If you make it an ideal, it is inhuman AND impossible. And it will destroy you. All ideals are destructive, and all idealists are the poisoners of humanity. Beware of them!

Live a simple, ordinary life – a day to day existence. Feeling hungry, eat; feeling sleepy, sleep; feeling loving, love. Don't hanker for anything perfect. Perfection is impossible. And don't start creating a new ideal out of this simple fact." <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.osho.com/osho-online-library/osho-talks/ideals-imprisonment-freedom-5cb7b5f5-2f8?p=f13acc8d9ed0c6d752c980d9b690516c|title=Ideals – Imprisonment – Freedom? – OSHO Online Library|website=OSHO – Transform Yourself through the Science of Meditation|access-date=26 April 2019}}</ref>

The new man is the very ordinary man: Nothing special, nothing superior, supramental.

===Contradictions and "Heart to heart communion"===
{{over-quotation|date=April 2019}}
{{primary sources|section|talk=Multiple Issues|date=April 2019}}
Rajneesh claimed on 30 October 1984 in the first talk he gave after three years of public silence that he had gone into public silence partly to put off those who were only intellectually following him:

"Now I have found my people and I have to arrange a silent communion, which will help in two ways: those who cannot understand silence will drop out. That will be good. That will be a good weeding; otherwise they will go on clinging around me because of the words, because their intellect feels satisfied. And I am not here to satisfy their intellect. My purpose is far, far deeper, of a different dimension.

So these days of silence have helped those who were just intellectually curious, rationally interested in me, to turn their back. And secondly, it has helped me to find my real, authentic people who are not in need of words to be with me. They can be with me without words. That's the difference between communication and communion."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rajneesh Bible|last=Osho, 1931–1990.|date=c. 1985|publisher=Rajneesh Foundational International|isbn=0880502002|location=Rajneeshpuram, Or., U.S.A.|oclc=11813128}}</ref>

=== Rajneesh's "Ten Commandments" ===
In his early days as Acharya Rajneesh, a correspondent once asked for his "[[Ten Commandments]]". In reply, Rajneesh said that it was a difficult matter because he was against any kind of commandment, but "just for fun", set out the following:

{{quote|
# Never obey anyone's command unless it is coming from within you also.
# There is no God other than life itself.
# '''Truth is within you, do not search for it elsewhere.'''
# Love is prayer.
# To become a nothingness is the door to truth. Nothingness itself is the means, the goal and attainment.
# Life is now and here.
# '''Live wakefully.'''
# Do not swim—float.
# '''Die each moment so that you can be new each moment.'''
# '''Do not search. That which is, is. Stop and see.'''}}

He underlined numbers 3, 7, 9 and 10.<ref name=10c>{{harvnb|Lewis|Petersen|2005|pp=128–129}}</ref> The ideas expressed in these Commandments have remained constant [[leitmotif]]s in his movement.<ref name=10c />

== Reception ==
Rajneesh is generally considered one of the most controversial spiritual leaders to have emerged from India in the twentieth century.<ref name=Mehta133>{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=133}}</ref><ref name="Chryss207-208" /> His message of sexual, emotional, spiritual, and institutional liberation, as well as the pleasure he took in causing offence, ensured that his life was surrounded by controversy.<ref name="JMF7"/> Rajneesh became known as the "sex guru" in India, and as the "Rolls-Royce guru" in the United States.<ref name="Gordon114" /> He attacked traditional concepts of nationalism, openly expressed contempt for politicians, and poked fun at the leading figures of various religions, who in turn found his arrogance insufferable.<ref>{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=1}}</ref><ref name=Mehta83>{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=83}}</ref> His teachings on sex, marriage, family, and relationships contradicted traditional values and aroused a great deal of anger and opposition around the world.<ref name="NYT160981" /><ref>{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=2}}</ref> His movement was widely considered a [[cult]]. Rajneesh was seen to live "in ostentation and offensive opulence", while his followers, most of whom had severed ties with outside friends and family and donated all or most of their money and possessions to the commune, might be at a mere "subsistence level".<ref name=Zaitz4 /><ref name=Galanter>{{harvnb|Galanter|1989|pp=95–96, 102}}</ref>

=== Appraisal by scholars of religion ===
Academic assessments of Rajneesh's work have been mixed and often directly contradictory. Uday Mehta saw errors in his interpretation of Zen and [[Mahayana Buddhism]], speaking of "gross contradictions and inconsistencies in his teachings" that "exploit" the "ignorance and gullibility" of his listeners.<ref name=Mehta>{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=151}}</ref> The sociologist Bob Mullan wrote in 1983 of "a borrowing of truths, half-truths and occasional misrepresentations from the great traditions"... often bland, inaccurate, spurious and extremely contradictory".<ref name="BM48">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=48}}</ref> American religious studies professor [[Hugh B. Urban]] also said Rajneesh's teaching was neither original nor especially profound, and concluded that most of its content had been borrowed from various Eastern and Western philosophies.<ref name="HBU-ZTB169" /> [[George Chryssides]], on the other hand, found such descriptions of Rajneesh's teaching as a "potpourri" of various religious teachings unfortunate because Rajneesh was "no amateur philosopher". Drawing attention to Rajneesh's academic background he stated that; "Whether or not one accepts his teachings, he was no charlatan when it came to expounding the ideas of others."<ref name="Chryss207-208" /> He described Rajneesh as primarily a Buddhist teacher, promoting an independent form of "Beat Zen"<ref name="Chryss207-208">{{harvnb|Chryssides|1999|pp=207–208}}</ref> and viewed the unsystematic, contradictory and outrageous aspects of Rajneesh's teachings as seeking to induce a change in people, not as philosophy lectures aimed at intellectual understanding of the subject.<ref name="Chryss207-208" />

Similarly with respect to Rajneesh's embracing of Western counter-culture and the human potential movement, though Mullan acknowledged that Rajneesh's range and imagination were second to none,<ref name="BM48" /> and that many of his statements were quite insightful and moving, perhaps even profound at times,<ref name="BM32">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=32}}</ref> he perceived "a potpourri of counter-culturalist and post-counter-culturalist ideas" focusing on love and freedom, the need to live for the moment, the importance of self, the feeling of "being okay", the mysteriousness of life, the fun ethic, the individual's responsibility for their own destiny, and the need to drop the ego, along with fear and guilt.<ref name="BM48-89-90">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|pp=48, 89–90}}</ref> Mehta notes that Rajneesh's appeal to his Western disciples was based on his social experiments, which established a philosophical connection between the Eastern [[Guru-shishya tradition|guru tradition]] and the Western [[growth movement]].<ref name=Mehta133 /> He saw this as a [[marketing strategy]] to meet the desires of his audience.<ref name="HBU-ZTB169" /> Urban, too, viewed Rajneesh as negating a dichotomy between spiritual and material desires, reflecting the preoccupation with the body and sexuality characteristic of late [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[consumer culture]] and in tune with the socio-economic conditions of his time.<ref name=GIA183 />

The British professor of religious studies [[Peter B. Clarke]] said that most participators felt they had made progress in self-actualisation as defined by American psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] and the [[human potential movement]].<ref name="Clarke466" /> He stated that the style of therapy Rajneesh devised, with its liberal attitude towards sexuality as a sacred part of life, had proved influential among other therapy practitioners and new age groups.<ref name="Clarke432-433" /> Yet Clarke believes that the main motivation of seekers joining the movement was "neither therapy nor sex, but the prospect of becoming enlightened, in the classical Buddhist sense".<ref name="Clarke466" />

In 2005, Urban observed that Rajneesh had undergone a "remarkable [[apotheosis]]" after his return to India, and especially in the years since his death, going on to describe him as a powerful illustration of what [[F. Max Müller]], over a century ago, called "that world-wide circle through which, like an electric current, Oriental thought could run to the West and Western thought return to the East".<ref name=GIA183>{{harvnb|Forsthoefel|Humes|2005|pp=181–185}}</ref> Clarke also said that Rajneesh has come to be "seen as an important teacher within India itself" who is "increasingly recognised as a major spiritual teacher of the twentieth century, at the forefront of the current 'world-accepting' trend of spirituality based on self-development".<ref name="Clarke432-433">{{harvnb|Clarke|2006|pp=432–433}}</ref>

=== Appraisal as charismatic leader ===
A number of commentators have remarked upon Rajneesh's charisma. Comparing Rajneesh with [[Gurdjieff]], [[Anthony Storr]] wrote that Rajneesh was "personally extremely impressive", noting that "many of those who visited him for the first time felt that their most intimate feelings were instantly understood, that they were accepted and unequivocally welcomed rather than judged. [Rajneesh] seemed to radiate energy and to awaken hidden possibilities in those who came into contact with him".<ref name=Storr47>{{harvnb|Storr|1996|p=47}}</ref> Many sannyasins have stated that hearing Rajneesh speak, they "fell in love with him".<ref name="SJP122">{{harvnb|Palmer|1988|p=122}}, reprinted in {{harvnb|Aveling|1999|p=368}}</ref><ref name="BM67">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=67}}</ref> Susan J. Palmer noted that even critics attested to the power of his presence.<ref name="SJP122" /> James S. Gordon, a psychiatrist and researcher, recalls inexplicably finding himself laughing like a child, hugging strangers and having tears of gratitude in his eyes after a glance by Rajneesh from within his passing Rolls-Royce.<ref name=Gordon109>{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=109}}</ref> [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]] concluded upon listening to Rajneesh in person that he was a brilliant lecturer, and expressed surprise at his talent as a comedian, which had not been apparent from reading his books, as well as the hypnotic quality of his talks, which had a profound effect on his audience.<ref name="FF2-106">{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986b|p=106}}</ref> Hugh Milne (Swami Shivamurti), an ex-devotee who between 1973 and 1982 worked closely with Rajneesh as leader of the Poona Ashram Guard<ref>{{harvnb|Wallis|1986|p=159}}</ref> and as his personal bodyguard,<ref>{{harvnb|Clarke|1988|p=67}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Belfrage|1981|p=137}}</ref> noted that their first meeting left him with a sense that far more than words had passed between them: "There is no invasion of privacy, no alarm, but it is as if his soul is slowly slipping inside mine, and in a split second transferring vital information."<ref>{{harvnb|Milne|1986|p=48}}</ref> Milne also observed another facet of Rajneesh's charismatic ability in stating that he was "a brilliant manipulator of the unquestioning disciple".<ref>{{harvnb|Milne|1986|p=307}}</ref>

Hugh B. Urban said that Rajneesh appeared to fit with [[Max Weber]]'s classical image of [[charismatic authority|the charismatic figure]], being held to possess "an extraordinary supernatural power or 'grace', which was essentially irrational and affective".<ref name="HBU-ZTB168">{{harvnb|Urban|1996|p=168}}</ref> Rajneesh corresponded to Weber's pure charismatic type in rejecting all rational laws and institutions and claiming to subvert all hierarchical authority, though Urban said that the promise of absolute freedom inherent in this resulted in bureaucratic organisation and institutional control within larger communes.<ref name="HBU-ZTB168" />

Some scholars have suggested that Rajneesh, may have had a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] personality.<ref>{{harvnb|Storr|1996|p=50}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Huth|1993|pp=204–226}}</ref><ref name=clarke /> In his paper ''The Narcissistic Guru: A Profile of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh'', Ronald O. Clarke, Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at [[Oregon State University]], argued that Rajneesh exhibited all the typical features of [[narcissistic personality disorder]], such as a grandiose sense of self-importance and uniqueness; a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success; a need for constant attention and admiration; a set of characteristic responses to threats to self-esteem; disturbances in interpersonal relationships; a preoccupation with [[personal grooming]] combined with frequent resorting to prevarication or outright lying; and a lack of empathy.<ref name=clarke /> Drawing on Rajneesh's reminiscences of his childhood in his book ''Glimpses of a Golden Childhood'', he suggested that Rajneesh suffered from a fundamental lack of [[parental discipline]], due to his growing up in the care of overindulgent grandparents.<ref name=clarke /> Rajneesh's self-avowed Buddha status, he concluded, was part of a [[delusion]]al system associated with his narcissistic personality disorder; a condition of ego-inflation rather than egolessness.<ref name=clarke>{{harvnb|Clarke|1988|p=}}, reprinted in {{harvnb|Aveling|1999|pp=55–89}}</ref>

=== Wider appraisal as a thinker and speaker ===
There are widely divergent assessments of Rajneesh's qualities as a thinker and speaker. [[Khushwant Singh]], an eminent author, historian, and former editor of the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', has described Rajneesh as "the most original thinker that India has produced: the most erudite, the most clearheaded and the most innovative".<ref name=Bhawuk>{{harvnb|Bhawuk|2003|p=14}}</ref> Singh believes that Rajneesh was a "free-thinking agnostic" who had the ability to explain the most abstract concepts in simple language, illustrated with witty anecdotes, who mocked gods, [[prophet]]s, scriptures, and religious practices, and gave a totally new dimension to religion.<ref>Khushwant Singh, writing in the ''[[Indian Express]]'', 25 December 1988, quoted e.g., [https://web.archive.org/web/20030523024043/http://www.indiaclub.com/Shop/SearchResults.asp?prodstock=11216 here]</ref> German philosopher [[Peter Sloterdijk]], a one time devotee of Rajneesh's (living at the Pune ashram from 1978 to 1980), described him as a "[[Wittgenstein]] of religions", ranking him as one of the greatest figures of the 20th century; in his view, Rajneesh had performed a radical deconstruction of the word games played by the world's religions.<ref>{{harvnb|Sloterdijk|1996|p=105}}</ref><ref>[https://petersloterdijk.net/vita/ Peter Sloterdijk vita]. Retrieved 16 October 2019.</ref>

During the early 1980s, a number of commentators in the popular press were dismissive of Rajneesh.<ref name="BM8-9" /> The Australian critic [[Clive James]] scornfully referred to him as "Bagwash", likening the experience of listening to one of his discourses to sitting in a laundrette and watching "your tattered underwear revolve soggily for hours while exuding grey suds. The Bagwash talks the way that he looks."<ref name="BM8-9">{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|pp=8–9}}</ref><ref name=Bagwash /> James finished by saying that Rajneesh, though a "fairly benign example of his type", was a "rebarbative dingbat who manipulates the manipulable into manipulating one another".<ref name="BM8-9" /><ref name=Bagwash /><ref>"Adieu to God: Why Psychology Leads to Atheism" Mick Power. p114</ref> Responding to an enthusiastic review of Rajneesh's talks by [[Bernard Levin]] in ''[[The Times]]'', Dominik Wujastyk, also writing in ''The Times'', similarly expressed his opinion that the talk he heard while visiting the Poona ''ashram'' was of a very low standard, wearyingly repetitive and often factually wrong, and stated that he felt disturbed by the [[personality cult]] surrounding Rajneesh.<ref name="BM8-9" /><ref>(10 August 2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090621002100/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1469028/Bernard-Levin.html Obituary of Bernard Levin], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. Retrieved 10 July 2011.</ref>

Writing in the [[Seattle Post Intelligencer]] in January 1990, American author [[Tom Robbins]] stated that based on his readings of Rajneesh's books, he was convinced Rajneesh was the 20th century's "greatest spiritual teacher". Robbins, while stressing that he was not a disciple, further stated that he had "read enough vicious propaganda and slanted reports to suspect that he was one of the most maligned figures in history".<ref name=Bhawuk /> Rajneesh's commentary on the [[Sikh]] scripture known as ''[[Japuji]]'' was hailed as the best available by [[Giani Zail Singh]], the former [[President of India]].<ref name="TJ" /> In 2011, author [[Farrukh Dhondy]] reported that film star [[Kabir Bedi]] was a fan of Rajneesh, and viewed Rajneesh's works as "the most sublime interpretations of Indian philosophy that he had come across". Dhondy himself said Rajneesh was "the cleverest intellectual confidence trickster that India has produced. His output of the 'interpretation' of Indian texts is specifically slanted towards a generation of disillusioned westerners who wanted (and perhaps still want) to 'have their cake, eat it' [and] claim at the same time that cake-eating is the highest virtue according to ancient-fused-with-scientific wisdom."<ref>(25 April 2011) [[Farrukh Dhondy]].
