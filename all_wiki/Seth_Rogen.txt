==Career==

===1999–2006: Early work and friendship with Judd Apatow===
Rogen's acting debut was in Apatow's ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', a [[cult hit]] series first released in 1999 as [[List of Freaks and Geeks characters#Ken Miller|Ken Miller]], a cynical, acerbic "freak."<ref name="torontostar"/> Revolving around a group of teenagers' lives, ''Freaks and Geeks'' first aired in 1999. Although well-reviewed, the show was [[NBC]]'s lowest-viewed program and was cancelled after one season due to poor ratings.<ref name="latimesfg"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/popcandy/2004-04-06-pop-candy_x.htm |title=DVDs resurrect 'Freaks and Geeks' – and everyone in between |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Whitney |last=Matheson |date=April 6, 2004 |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}</ref> Impressed with Rogen's improvisational skills,<ref name="Time"/> Apatow then chose him as the lead in another of his shows, ''[[Undeclared]]''. Rogen was originally set to play a fairly popular but nerdy college freshman, but the network did not think he was leading man material. Apatow opted not to go along with the show.<ref name="Time"/> Rogen also served as a staff writer to the short-lived production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifc.com/undeclared/cast/seth-rogen-1.php |title=Cast and Crew: Seth Rogen |publisher=[[Independent Film Channel|IFC]] |accessdate=June 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907065533/http://www.ifc.com/undeclared/cast/seth-rogen-1.php |archivedate=September 7, 2011  }}</ref><ref name="tdtgeek">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3558496/Seth-Rogen-Triumph-of-the-supergeek.html |title=Seth Rogen: Triumph of the supergeek |first=John |last=Hiscock |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=August 15, 2008 |accessdate=June 16, 2011 |location=London}}</ref>

Following the show's cancellation in 2002, Rogen did not get many auditions, which was not upsetting to him as he always thought he would achieve better success as a writer.<ref name="timepage2">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1622581,00.html |title=The Education of A Comic Prodigy |first=Joel |last=Stein |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}</ref> He would soon be a part of Apatow's "frat pack," a close-knit group that includes [[Steve Carell]] and [[Paul Rudd]].<ref name="tdt09"/> Of the awkwardness of a grown man spending so much time with a teenaged Rogen, Apatow said: "I'm such a comedy fan that, even though he's&nbsp;16, I know I'm hanging out with one of the guys who's going to be one of the great comics."<ref name="Time"/> Around this time, Apatow would come up with odd requests for Rogen and Goldberg, such as turn an idea of his into a movie in 10 days and come up with 100 one-page ideas for films.<ref name="timepage2"/> Regarding Apatow's professional effect on Rogen, the actor said in 2009, "Obviously, I can't stress how important Judd's been to my career."<ref name="tdt09"/>

===2007–2009: Breakthrough as a leading man===
[[File:SethRogen 7 2007.JPG|thumb|upright=0.84|Rogen in 2007]]
His breakthrough came when [[Universal Studios]] greenlit him for the lead in yet another Apatow production: ''[[Knocked Up]]'' (2007), a [[romantic comedy]] that follows the repercussions of a drunken [[one-night stand]] between his slacker character and [[Katherine Heigl]]'s just-promoted [[media personality]] that results in an unintended pregnancy. Upon completing ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'', Apatow had approached Rogen about potential starring roles, but the actor suggested many high-concept science fiction ideas. After Apatow insisted that he would work better in real life situations, the two agreed on the accidental pregnancy concept of this production.<ref name="flickd">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/flickd/k/knocked_up_set_visit_060928/ |title=A (Kind of) New Star is Born |last=Carrol |first=Larry |publisher=MTV |date=September 28, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Rogen called shooting sex scenes with Heigl "nerve-racking" and found comfort with the supporting cast since, even though he played a lead, the focus was not all on him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/entertainment/article.asp/aid/4457/cid/13/tcid/1 |title=Seth Rogen interview – Knocked Up |publisher=Collider |date=May 24, 2007 |accessdate=June 28, 2011}}</ref><ref name="pineapple usatoday">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-05-29-seth-rogen_N.htm |title=Many faces of Rogen keep them laughing |first=Susan |last=Wloszczyna |work=USA Today |date=May 30, 2007 |accessdate=June 28, 2011}}</ref> Made on a $30&nbsp;million budget and released on June 1, ''Knocked Up'' was a critical and commercial [[box office]] hit, garnering an approval rating of 90&nbsp;percent on [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and grossing $219&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/knocked_up/ |title=Knocked Up (2007) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=knockedup.htm |title=Knocked Up |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Rogen also received favourable reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/review/2007/06/01/knocked_up |title=Knocked Up |first=Stephanie |last=Zacharek |work=[[Salon.com|Salon]] |date=June 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&id=9122 |first=Wesley |last=Morris |title=In 'Knocked Up,' family values get a twist|work=Boston Globe |date=June 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Later that year, he played a supporting part as an irresponsible police officer in ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', which he had written with his writing partner and was co-produced by Apatow.

Rogen is a supporter of [[Black Lives Matter]].<ref>https://m.eonline.com/amp/news/1157972/seth-rogen-repeatedly-shuts-down-critics-of-his-black-lives-matter-post</ref>

During his July 2020 promotional tour for his comedy, ''An American Pickle'', Rogen said he was "fed a huge amount of lies about Israel" growing up. "They never tell you that, 'Oh, by the way, there were people there'. They make it seem like it was just like sitting there, like the fucking door’s open." He said that antisemitism remains pervasive and prevalent, but he rejected the argument that Jews would never be safe without a state. "You don’t keep something you’re trying to preserve all in one place."<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news| author = Oliver Holmes| title = Seth Rogen: 'I was fed a huge amount of lies about Israel'| newspaper = Guardian| date = 29 Jul 2020| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/29/seth-rogen-israel-palestinians-jewish-actor}}</ref>
