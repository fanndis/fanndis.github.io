[[File:Queen-charlotte-1744-1818.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]] of Great Britain and Ireland]]

The [[Catawba people|Catawba]] Native Americans were the first known historic tribe to settle Mecklenburg County (in the Charlotte area) and were first recorded around 1567 in Spanish records. By 1759 half the Catawba tribe had died from [[smallpox]], which was endemic among Europeans, because the Catawba had not acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the new disease. At the time of their largest population, Catawba people numbered 10,000, but by 1826 their total population had dropped to 110.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://clclt.com/theclog/archives/2012/12/21/question-the-queen-city-who-were-the-native-americans-that-lived-here-before-charlotte-was-colonized|title=Question the Queen City: Who were the Native Americans that lived here before Charlotte was colonized?|website=Creative Loafing Charlotte|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref>

The [[European Americans|European-American]] city of Charlotte was developed first by a wave of migration of [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] Presbyterians, or [[Ulster-Scot]] settlers from [[Northern Ireland]], who dominated the culture of the Southern Piedmont Region. They made up the principal founding European population in the backcountry. [[German Americans|German immigrants]] also settled the area before the [[American Revolutionary War]], but in much smaller numbers. They still contributed greatly to the early foundations of the region.

Mecklenburg County was initially part of [[Bath County, North Carolina|Bath County]] (1696 to 1729) of New Hanover Precinct, which became [[New Hanover County, North Carolina|New Hanover County]] in 1729. The western portion of New Hanover split into [[Bladen County, North Carolina|Bladen County]] in 1734, its western portion splitting into [[Anson County, North Carolina|Anson County]] in 1750. Mecklenburg County formed from Anson County in 1762. Further apportionment was made in 1792, after the American Revolutionary War, with [[Cabarrus County, North Carolina|Cabarrus County]] formed from Mecklenburg.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/mecklenburg-county-1762/|title=Mecklenburg County (1762)|publisher=North Carolina History Project|access-date=June 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200626074059/https://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/mecklenburg-county-1762/|archive-date=June 26, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1842, [[Union County, North Carolina|Union County]] formed from Mecklenburg's southeastern portion and a western portion of Anson County. These areas were all part of one of the original six judicial/military districts of North Carolina known as the [[Salisbury District, North Carolina|Salisbury District]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.carolana.com/NC/Revolution/patriot_militia_nc_salisbury_district.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070713204516/http://www.carolana.com/NC/Revolution/patriot_militia_nc_salisbury_district.html | archive-date = July 13, 2007 | title = The American Revolution in North Carolina | access-date = June 25, 2011}}</ref>

The area that is now Charlotte was settled by people of European descent around 1755, when Thomas Spratt and his family settled near what is now the Elizabeth neighborhood. [[Thomas Polk]] (granduncle of [[President of the United States|U.S.&nbsp;President]] [[James K. Polk]]), who later married Thomas Spratt's daughter, built his house by the intersection of two [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] trading paths between the [[Yadkin River|Yadkin]] and [[Catawba River|Catawba]] rivers.<ref name="Story1">{{cite web

A second nickname derives from the [[American Revolutionary War]], when British commander [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis]] occupied the city but was driven out by hostile residents. He wrote that Charlotte was "a [[hornet]]'s nest of rebellion", leading to the nickname "The Hornet's Nest".<ref>[https://www.cmstory.org/exhibits/hornets-nest-book-one/welcome-cornwallis Charlotte Mecklenburg Library: A Welcome for Cornwallis] (Retrieved on 07–25–19)</ref>

Local leaders came together in 1775 and signed the [[Mecklenburg Resolves]], more popularly known as the [[Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence]]. While not a true declaration of independence from British rule, it is among the first such declarations that eventually led to the [[American Revolution]]. May 20, the traditional date of the signing of the declaration, is celebrated annually in Charlotte as "MecDec", with musket and cannon fire by reenactors in Independence Square. North Carolina's [[Flag of North Carolina|state flag]] and [[Seal of North Carolina|state seal]] also bear the date.

===After the American Revolution===
Charlotte is traditionally considered the home of Southern [[Presbyterianism]], but in the 19th&nbsp;century, numerous churches, including Presbyterian, [[Baptist]], [[Methodist]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]], [[Lutheran]], and [[Roman Catholic]] formed, eventually giving Charlotte the nickname, "The City of Churches".<ref name="Story40">{{cite web

In 1799, in nearby Cabarrus County, 12-year-old [[Conrad Reed]] found a 17- pound rock, which his family used as a doorstop. Three years later, a jeweler determined it was nearly solid gold, paying the family a paltry $3.50.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050103061621/http://www.blanchardonline.com/AmericanRarities/archive-08/dah.html Blanchard Online: American Rarities] (Retrieved on 05–22–07)</ref> The first documented gold find in the United States of any consequence set off the nation's first [[gold rush]]. Many veins of gold were found in the area throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, leading to the 1837 founding of the [[Charlotte Mint]]. North Carolina was the chief producer of gold in the United States until the Sierra Nevada find in 1848,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blanchardonline.com/AmericanRarities/archive-08/char.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040419135250/http://blanchardonline.com/AmericanRarities/archive-08/char.html|archive-date=April 19, 2004 |title=The Charlotte Branch Mint |website=Blanchardonline.com |access-date=July 2, 2010}}</ref> although the volume mined in the Charlotte area was dwarfed by subsequent rushes.

Some groups still [[Placer mining|pan for gold]] occasionally in local streams and creeks. The [[Reed Gold Mine]] operated until 1912. The Charlotte Mint was active until 1861, when [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces seized it at the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The mint was not reopened at the war's end, but the building, albeit in a different location, now houses the [[Mint Museum of Art]].

The city's first boom came after the Civil War, as a cotton processing center and a railroad hub. Charlotte's city population at the [[United States Census, 1880|1880 Census]] grew to 7,084.<ref name="Story">{{cite web

In 1910, Charlotte surpassed [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] to become North Carolina's largest city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmhpf.org/S&Rs%20Alphabetical%20Order/Surveys&rmeckcourthouse.htm |title=Survey and Research Report on the Mecklenburg County Courthouse|publisher=Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Landmarks Commission|access-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>

===World War I to present===
The population grew again during [[World War I]], when the U.S. government established Camp Greene, north of present-day Wilkinson Boulevard. Many soldiers and suppliers stayed after the war, launching urbanization that eventually overtook older cities along the [[Piedmont Crescent]].  In the 1920 census, Charlotte was only the state's second largest city, [[Winston-Salem]] having 48,395, two thousand more people than Charlotte.  Charlotte overtook it several years later.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.journalnow.com/news/local/northwest-almanac-when-winston-salem-was-the-state-s-largest/article_f91d8e8f-4071-5894-94aa-a675e9a5f4d6.html|title=Northwest Almanac: When Winston-Salem was the state's largest city|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|date=January 8, 2018|access-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>

The city's modern-day banking industry achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, largely under the leadership of [[financier]] [[Hugh McColl]]. McColl transformed [[North Carolina National Bank]] (NCNB) into a formidable national bank that through aggressive acquisitions eventually merged with BankAmerica to become [[Bank of America]]. [[First Union]], later [[Wachovia]] in 2001, experienced similar growth before it was acquired by [[San Francisco]]-based [[Wells Fargo]] in 2008. Measured by control of assets, Charlotte became the second largest banking headquarters in the United States after [[New York City]].<ref name="Story13">{{cite web | url=http://www.cmstory.org/content/1991-nationsbank-soars | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518112416/http://www.cmstory.org/content/1991-nationsbank-soars | archive-date= May 18, 2015 | title= The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Story: History Timeline: NationsBank Soars | work = cmstory.org Web Site | publisher=Public Library of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County | access-date=September 25, 2015}}</ref>

On September 22, 1989, the city was hit by [[Hurricane Hugo]]. With sustained winds of {{convert|69|mph|abbr=on}} and gusts of {{convert|87|mph|abbr=on}},<ref>[http://www.hurricanedisasterslive.com/HURRICANE-HUGO-1989.html Hurricanedisasterslive.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824203024/http://www.hurricanedisasterslive.com/HURRICANE-HUGO-1989.html |date=August 24, 2009 }}, Retrieved on July 30, 2009</ref> Hugo caused massive property damage, destroyed 80,000 trees, and knocked out electrical power to most of the population. Residents were without power for weeks, schools were closed for a week or more, and the cleanup took months. The city was caught unprepared; Charlotte is {{convert|200|mi|km}} inland, and residents from coastal areas in both Carolinas often wait out hurricanes in Charlotte.

In December 2002, Charlotte and much of central North Carolina were hit by an ice storm that resulted in more than 1.3&nbsp;million people losing power.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ice Storm Knocks Out Power Across North Carolina |url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1089860/ |publisher=[[WRAL-TV]] |location=Raleigh, NC |date=December 5, 2002 |access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref> During an abnormally cold December, many were without power for weeks. Many of the city's [[Bradford pear]] trees split apart under the weight of the ice.

In August 2015 and September 2016, the city experienced several days of protests related to the [[List of killings by law enforcement officers in the United States|police shootings]] of [[Shooting of Jonathan Ferrell|Jonathan Ferrell]] and [[Shooting of Keith Lamont Scott|Keith Scott]].<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=August 22, 2015 |title=Two arrested during Kerrick trial protests in Charlotte |url=http://abc11.com/news/protests-in-charlotte-after-kerrick-mistrial/951156/ |publisher=[[WTVD]] |location=Durham, NC |access-date=September 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first1=Rick |last1=Rothacker |first2=Mark |last2=Washburn |first3=Adam |last3=Bell |title=Staggered by protests, city regains its footing |date=September 23, 2016 |newspaper=The Charlotte Observer |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article103629427.html |access-date=September 25, 2016}}</ref>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|308.6|sqmi||abbr=}}, of which {{convert|306.6|sqmi||abbr=}} is land and {{convert|2.0|sqmi||abbr=}} is water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/tigerwebmain/Files/bas19/tigerweb_bas19_incplace_nc.html|title=State of North Carolina Incorporated Places - Current/BAS19 - Data as of January 1, 2018|date=January 1, 2019|website=U.S. Census Bureau, TIGERweb Application|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref> Charlotte lies at an elevation of {{convert|751|ft|}}.
Charlotte constitutes most of [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina|Mecklenburg County]] in the Carolina [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]]. [[Charlotte center city]] sits atop a long rise between two creeks, Sugar Creek and Irwin Creek, and was built on the [[gunnies]] of the St. Catherine's and Rudisill [[gold]] [[mining|mines]].

Though the Catawba River and its lakes lie several miles west, there are no significant bodies of water or other geological features near the city center. Consequently, development has neither been constrained nor helped by waterways or ports that have contributed to many cities of similar size. The lack of these obstructions has contributed to Charlotte's growth as a highway, rail, and air transportation hub.

The urban section of [[Little Sugar Creek Greenway]] was completed in 2012. Inspired in part by the [[San Antonio River Walk]], and integral to Charlotte's extensive urban park system, it is "a huge milestone" according to Gwen Cook, greenway planner for Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/04/20/3186598/little-sugar-creek-greenway-section.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120722001407/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/04/20/3186598/little-sugar-creek-greenway-section.html|url-status=dead|title=Little Sugar Creek Greenway section is done|date=July 22, 2012|archive-date=July 22, 2012|website=CharlotteObserver.com}}</ref> However, the Little Sugar Creek Greenway bears no relation to the San Antonio River Walk. The Little Sugar Creek Greenway is prone to flooding during thunderstorms and periods of heavy rain. Creation of Little Sugar Creek Greenway cost $43 million and was controversial because it required the forced acquisition of several established local businesses.

The city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County began purchasing flood-prone homes in the 1990s. Voluntary buyouts of 700 households have created around 200 acres of open land that can flood safely, thereby saving an estimated $28 million in flood damage and emergency rescues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2019/11/26/one-citys-plan-combat-climate-change-bulldoze-homes-rebuild-paradise/|title=One city’s plan to combat climate change: Bulldoze homes, rebuild paradise|last=Sellers|first=Frances Stead|date=November 26, 2019|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127221706/https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2019/11/26/one-citys-plan-combat-climate-change-bulldoze-homes-rebuild-paradise/|archive-date=2019-11-27|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref>

===Climate===
Charlotte, like much of the Piedmont region of the southeastern United States, has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with four distinct seasons; the city itself is part of USDA [[hardiness zone]] 8a, transitioning to 7b in the suburbs in all directions except the south.<ref>{{cite web|title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=June 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227032333/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/|archive-date=February 27, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Winters are cool, with a normal January daily mean temperature of {{convert|40.1|°F|1}}.<ref name = "NWS Greenville-Spartanburg, SC (GSP)"/> On average, there are 59&nbsp;nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 1.5&nbsp;days that fail to rise above freezing.<ref name = "NWS Greenville-Spartanburg, SC (GSP)"/> April is the driest month, with an average of {{convert|3.04|in|cm}} of precipitation.

Charlotte is directly in the path of subtropical moisture from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as it heads up the eastern seaboard, thus the city receives ample precipitation throughout the year but also many clear, sunny days; precipitation is generally less frequent in autumn than in spring.<ref name="NWS Greenville-Spartanburg, SC (GSP)"/> On average, Charlotte receives {{convert|41.6|in|mm|sigfig=3}} of precipitation annually, which is somewhat evenly distributed throughout the year, although summer is slightly wetter; annual precipitation has historically ranged from {{convert|26.23|in|mm|abbr=on}} in 2001 to {{convert|68.44|in|mm|abbr=on}} in 1884.<ref name = "NWS Greenville-Spartanburg, SC (GSP)"/> In addition, there is an average of {{convert|4.3|in|cm|1}} of snow, mainly in January and February and rarely December or March, with more frequent ice storms and sleet mixed in with rain; seasonal snowfall has historically ranged from trace amounts as recently as 2011–12 to {{convert|22.6|in|cm|abbr=on}} in 1959–60.<ref name="NWS Greenville-Spartanburg, SC (GSP)"/> These storms can have a major impact on the area, as they often pull tree limbs down onto power lines and make driving hazardous. Snow has been recorded a small number of times in April, most recently, April 2, 2019.

{{As of|2020}}, the Charlotte metropolitan area as a whole is noted for having one of the worst [[weather radar]] gaps among any major [[East Coast of the United States|U.S. East Coast city]], with little to no coverage in a roughly quadrilateral area spanning [[Concord, North Carolina|Concord]], [[Salisbury, North Carolina|Salisbury]] and much

Historically, voters have been friendly to moderates of both parties. However, in recent years, Charlotte has swung heavily to the Democrats. Republican strength is concentrated in the southeastern portion of the city, while Democratic strength is concentrated in the south-central, eastern, and northern areas.

The city council has 11 members (7 from districts and 4 [[at-large]]). Democrats control the council with a 9-to-2 advantage, winning all 4 of the at-large seats in the November 2013, 2015, and 2017 municipal elections. While the City Council is responsible for passing ordinances, the City's budget, and other policies, all decisions can be overridden by the [[North Carolina General Assembly]], since North Carolina municipalities do not have [[Municipal home rule|home rule]]. While municipal powers have been broadly construed since the 1960s, the General Assembly still retains considerable authority over local matters.

Charlotte is split between two [[congressional district]]s on the federal level. The southeastern portion is part of the [[North Carolina's 9th congressional district|9th District]], represented by Republican [[Dan Bishop]]. Most of the city is in the [[North Carolina's 12th congressional district|12th District]], represented by Democrat [[Alma Adams]].

Charlotte was selected in 2011 to host the [[2012 Democratic National Convention]], which was held at the [[Spectrum Center (Charlotte)|Spectrum Center]]. It began September 4, 2012, and ended on September 6, 2012. {{ref|http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/02/01/charlotte-will-host-the-2012-democratic-national-convention-2/}} In 2018, Charlotte was chosen to host the [[2020 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in August 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/20/where-is-republican-national-convention-2020-charlotte-734953|title=Charlotte to host 2020 Republican National Convention|last=Mueller|first=Eleanor|date=July 20, 2018|work=politico.com|access-date=November 24, 2019}}</ref>

===Libraries===
[[File:Imaginon.jpg|thumb|[[ImaginOn]] Children's Theater and Library]]
The [[Charlotte Mecklenburg Library]] serves the Charlotte area with a large collection (more than 1.5&nbsp;million) of books, CDs and DVDs at 15&nbsp;locations in the city of Charlotte, with branches in the surrounding towns of [[Matthews, North Carolina|Matthews]], [[Mint Hill, North Carolina|Mint Hill]], [[Huntersville, North Carolina|Huntersville]], [[Cornelius, North Carolina|Cornelius]] and [[Davidson, North Carolina|Davidson]]. All locations provide free access to Internet-enabled computers and WiFi, and a library card from one location is accepted at all 20 locations.<ref name="Charlotte Mecklenburg Library Info"/>

Although the library's roots go back to the ''Charlotte Literary and Library Association,'' founded on January 16, 1891,<ref name="cmstory.org Web Site"/> the state-chartered [[Carnegie Library]], which opened on the current North Tryon site of the Main Library, was the first non-subscription library opened to members of the public in the city of Charlotte. The philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]] donated $25,000 for a library building, on the condition that the city of Charlotte donate a site and $2,500 per year for books and salaries,<ref name="Public Library of Charlotte and Mec"/> and that the state grant a charter for the library. All conditions were met, and the Charlotte Carnegie Library opened in an imposing classical building on July 2, 1903.

The 1903 state charter also required that a library be opened for the disenfranchised African-American population of Charlotte. This was completed in 1905 with the opening of the ''Brevard Street Library for Negroes'', an independent library in Brooklyn, a historically black area of Charlotte, on the corner of Brevard and East Second Streets (now Martin Luther King Boulevard).<ref name="cmstory.org">{{cite web

====Mass transit====
{{Main article|Charlotte Area Transit System}}
[[File:LynxBlandStreet.jpg|thumb|The [[LYNX Blue Line|Blue Line's]] Bland Street Station in Charlotte's SouthEnd neighborhood]]

The [[Charlotte Area Transit System]] (CATS) is the agency responsible for operating mass transit in the Charlotte metropolitan area, carrying over 16 million riders annually. Established in 1999 and administered as a department of the City of Charlotte, CATS operates [[light rail]] transit, [[streetcar]], [[commuter bus|express buses]], [[transit bus|local buses]], and special bus services serving Charlotte and the surrounding area in addition to other programs such as [[vanpool]].

CATS' rail arm, LYNX Rapid Transit Services, comprises two lines as of fall 2020. The Blue Line is an 18.9‑mile line north–south light rail line running through [[South End (Charlotte neighborhood)|South End]], [[Uptown Charlotte|Center City]], [[NoDa]], and [[University City (Charlotte neighborhood)|University City]]. The [[CityLYNX Gold Line]] streetcar, Phase 1 of which opened in 2015, is under Phase 2 construction as of fall 2020. When completed, the Gold Line will link the Beatties Ford neighborhood through Uptown and then south and east to the Elizabeth neighborhood. The [[LYNX Silver Line]], a light rail line in the pre-project development phase as of fall 2020, will link the southeastern suburbs of [[Matthews, North Carolina|Matthews]], [[Stallings, North Carolina|Stallings]], and [[Indian Trail, North Carolina|Indian Trail]] with [[Uptown Charlotte]] and the future Charlotte Gateway Station before extending west to [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport]] and across the Catawba River to [[Belmont, North Carolina|Belmont]] in Gaston County.

The bulk of CATS ridership is derived from its extensive bus network, which has its main hub at the Charlotte Transportation Center in Uptown, which also connects to the Blue and Gold lines. Other bus hubs are located at community transit centers in SouthPark, Eastland, and at Rosa Parks Place. CATS operates express buses to outlying parts of the city and some commuter bus to the northern suburbs in the Lake Norman area under the MetroRAPID umbrella.

====Walkability====
A 2011 study by [[Walk Score]] ranked Charlotte the 49th most walkable of the 50 largest cities in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/?page=5|title=2011 City and Neighborhood Rankings |publisher=Walk Score |year=2011 |access-date=August 28, 2011}}</ref>

====Roads and highways====
Charlotte's central location between the population centers of the northeast and southeast has made it a transportation focal point and primary distribution center, with two major interstate highways, [[Interstate 85|I-85]] and [[Interstate 77|I-77]], intersecting near the city's center. The latter highway also connects to the population centers of the [[Rust Belt]].

Charlotte's [[beltway]], designated [[Interstate 485|I-485]] and simply called "485" by local residents, has been under construction for over 20 years, but funding problems have slowed its progress. The final segment was finished in mid-2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdot.gov/projects/charlotteouterloop/|title=NCDOT: I-485 Charlotte Outer Loop|website=Ncdot.gov|access-date=June 13, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621073437/http://www.ncdot.gov/projects/CharlotteOuterLoop/|archive-date=June 21, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> I-485 has a total circumference of approximately {{convert|67|mi|abbr=on}}. Within the city, the [[Interstate 277 (North Carolina)|I-277]] loop freeway encircles Charlotte's uptown (usually referred to by its two separate sections, the [[John M. Belk|John Belk Freeway]] and the Brookshire Freeway) while [[Charlotte Route 4]] links major roads in a loop between I-277 and I-485. [[Independence Freeway]], which carries [[U.S. Route 74|U.S. 74]] and links downtown with the Matthews area, is undergoing an expansion and widening in the eastern part of the city.

It is a major hub for [[American Airlines]], having historically been a hub for its predecessors [[US Airways]] and [[Piedmont Airlines]]. Nonstop flights are available to many destinations across the United States, Canada, Central America, the [[Caribbean]], Europe, Mexico, and South America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cltairport.com/airport-info/about-clt|title=About CLT|website=cltairport.com|access-date=June 21, 2020}}</ref>
