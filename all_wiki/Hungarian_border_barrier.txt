In 2015, [[Hungary]] built a [[border barrier]] on its border with [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]]. The fence was constructed during the [[European migrant crisis]] (see [[Timeline of the European migrant crisis|timeline]]), with the aim to ensure border security by preventing illegal immigrants from entering, and enabling the option to enter through official checkpoints and claim asylum in Hungary in accordance with international and European law.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34260071 Migrant crisis: Hungary's closed border leaves many stranded]. [[BBC News]]. 15 September 2015.</ref> The number of illegal entries to Hungary declined greatly after the barrier was finished as it effectively abolished the access to asylum in Hungary.<ref name="26 August 2016"/>

Following an increased influx of asylum-seekers and migrants into the [[Schengen Area]] despite the [[Dublin Regulation]], Hungary stated that the EU was "too slow to act", and started construction of the barrier in June 2015.<ref name=Nolan>{{cite news|last1=Nolan|first1=Daniel|title=Hungary orders 100-mile Serbia border fence to keep out migrants|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/hungary/11680840/Hungary-orders-100-mile-Serbia-border-fence-to-keep-out-migrants.html|accessdate=18 August 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=17 June 2015}}</ref> According to [[BBC News]], "many of the migrants currently in Hungary have been refusing to register there, in order to continue their journeys to Germany before seeking asylum".<ref name="BBC 3 September 2015">[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34136823 Migrant crisis 'a German problem' - Hungary's Orban]. 3 September 2015.</ref> Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] commented: "Our job is only to register them".<ref name="BBC 3 September 2015"/> The barrier was completed in September.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-34250092 Refugees 'exhausted' after Serbia-Hungary border closes].

By mid-August the barrier was taking shape as a double security fence. There is a hastily constructed outer fence made up of three rows of razor wire, scheduled to be completed by the end of August 2015.

On 16 September 2015, migrants prevented by the new fence by crossing the border near [[Horgoš]], [[Serbia]], and [[Röszke]], Hungary, reacted by surging forward and pushing or tearing away a section of the new fence. Hungarian riot police responded with tear gas, causing the migrants to fall back, then regroup and surge forward again, only to be met by another round of tear gas canisters and with water cannon. At this point, some of the migrants began tearing apart a decayed structure, to obtain chunks of concrete which, along with [[Criminal rock throwing|rocks were hurled]] at police as other rioters built debris fires, filling the air with smoke. The riot subsided as word spread the Hungarian police had opened a nearby gate, but as 200 or 300 migrants walked through the newly opened gate, Hungarian police "surged forward", swinging batons and firing tear gas into the crowd of migrants.<ref name=Lyman>{{cite news|last1=Lyman|first1=Rick|title=Migrants Clash With Police in Hungary, as Others Enter Croatia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/world/europe/europe-refugee-migrant-crisis.html|accessdate=17 September 2015|work=New York Times|date=16 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=Radovanovic>{{cite news|last1=Radovanovic|first1=Radul|title=Chaotic border scrums as Croatia becomes migrant hotspot|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/croatia-now-latest-migrant-hotspot-after-hungarian-clashes/|accessdate=17 September 2015|agency=AP|publisher=Seattle Times|date=17 September 2015}}</ref>

Funding of the construction of the Hungary-Serbia border fence and border hunters project has increased tension between Hungary and the [[Member state of the European Union|other EU member states]].

==Romanian border==
In mid-September 2015, Hungary was considering a barrier on part of the [[Hungary–Romania border|Romanian border]] in case of a shift in the migrant flow through this area.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/15/us-europe-migrants-hungary-romania-idUSKCN0RF1JW20150915 Hungary preparing to extend border fence towards Romania].

In October 2017, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán offered to "help Romania to protect its eastern borders" and added that if illegal migration over Romanian territory continues to grow, Hungary will be forced to build a fence on the common border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europost.eu/article?id=20769|title=Orban offers help to Romania to seal its border for migrants|date=7 October 2017|work=Europost|accessdate=22 October 2017}}</ref>

==Impact on the number of illegal migrants entering Hungary==
Attempted border entries fell following the barrier's construction. During the month of September 2015 there was a total number of 138,396 migrant entries, and within the first two weeks of November the average daily number of intercepted migrants decreased to only 15, which is a daily reduction of more than 4,500.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/hatarinfo/elfogott-migransok-szama-lekerdezes?honap%5bvalue%5d%5byear%5d=2015&honap%5bvalue%5d%5bmonth%5d=11|title=Elfogott migránsok száma - dátum szerinti lekérdezés|website=A Magyar Rendőrség hivatalos honlapja|language=hu|access-date=2016-06-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903025844/http://www.police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/hatarinfo/elfogott-migransok-szama-lekerdezes?honap%5bvalue%5d%5byear%5d=2015&honap%5bvalue%5d%5bmonth%5d=11|archive-date=2017-09-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Environmental impact==
According to a correspondence published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' journal, the border barrier can entangle animals in razor wire and endangers [[wildlife]] by blocking [[animal migration]], jeopardizing connectivity of species populations by [[habitat fragmentation]]<ref>John D. C. Linnell. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7585/full/529156a.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20160114 Border controls: Refugee fences fragment wildlife]. [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 13 January 2016.</ref> (such as the [[lesser mole-rat]]<ref name=small-mammals>{{cite web|url=http://www.small-mammals.org/newsvojvodina-blind-mole-rat/|title=Vojvodina Blind Mole Rat may go extinct due to construction of a fence along the border between Hungary and Serbia - SMSG - Small Mammal Specialist Group|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2017}}</ref>).
