A '''means-tested benefit''' is a payment available to people who can demonstrate that their income and [[Capital rule|capital]] (their '[[wikt:means|means]]') are below specified limits. It is a central part of the [[welfare state in the United Kingdom]].

==History==
The [[Beveridge Report]] of 1942 proposed a system of contributory benefits which would leave only a residual role for means-tested benefits which were then called [[National Assistance]].

==Defunct==
* [[National Assistance]]
* [[Supplementary Benefit]]
* [[Family Credit]]
* [[Family Income Supplement]]
* [[Social Fund (UK)]]
* [[Working tax credit]]
* [[Child Tax Credit]]

==Current==
The main means-tested benefits in 2019 are:

* [[Income Support]]
* Income-based [[Jobseeker's Allowance]]
* Income-related [[Employment and Support Allowance]]  
* [[Pension Credit|Pension Credit Guarantee Credit]] 
* [[Universal Credit]]
* [[Housing Benefit]]

Receipt of such benefits other than [[Housing Benefit]] and tax credits is a passport to other non-cash help such as [[free school meals]], free [[prescription charges]], [[Legal Aid]], [[cold weather payment]]. The claimant, their partner and dependent children are covered. The rules for  free [[NHS dentistry]] and [[Eye care in the United Kingdom|optical charges]] have become more complex since the introduction of [[Universal Credit]] and have led to many people facing financial penalties, often wrongly.<ref>{{cite news |title='Go to the dentist and get fined Â£100' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41639456 |accessdate=15 April 2019 |publisher=BBC |date=18 October 2017}}</ref>

People who are not entitled to any of the qualifying benefits may be able to qualify for help with health charges by a separate [[means test]], the [[NHS Low Income Scheme]].

==Assessment of means==
The income and capital limits are specified in relation to the needs of a household, normally a couple and any children living with them. A couple who are not married may be treated as [[Cohabitation in the United Kingdom|Living together as a married couple]].
