'''Sir John Major''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KG|CH}} (born 29 March 1943) is a British politician who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from 1990 to 1997. Major served in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]] from 1987 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]], formerly [[Huntingdonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdonshire]], from 1979 to 2001. Since [[Margaret Thatcher's death]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of the [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former British prime ministers]].

Major was born in [[St Helier, London]]. His family moved from [[Worcester Park]] to [[Brixton]] due to their worsening financial situation. He left school in 1959 with just three [[O-levels]]. After working a variety of jobs and enduring a period of unemployment, he established a career at [[Standard Bank]]. However, his ambitions lay in politics. After a period as a [[Lambeth London Borough Council|councillor in Lambeth]], he was elected for Huntingdonshire at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] and served as a parliamentary private secretary, assistant whip and [[Department of Health and Social Security|Minister for Social Security]]. In 1987, he joined the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] and was promoted to [[Foreign Secretary]] in July 1989 and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in October. As Chancellor, he presented the 1990 budget. 

Major became Prime Minister when he won the [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election]] after [[Margaret Thatcher]] resigned during the early stages of the contest. In the early days of his premiership, he launched the [[Citizen's Charter]] and negotiated the [[European Union]]'s [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |access-date=17 May 2011}}</ref> In the midst of a severe recession, he went on to lead the Conservatives to a fourth consecutive electoral victory at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] with over 14&nbsp;million votes but a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) on 16 September 1992, a day which came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Major's economic policies and he was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again even as the economy eventually revived. He continued to push on with reforming education, health and criminal justice, privatising British Rail and the coal industry and reinvigorating the [[Northern Ireland peace process]]; which would lead to the [[Good Friday Agreement]] under his successor [[Tony Blair]]. By the mid-1990s, the Conservatives were highly polarised on European integration and also embroiled in a series of sexual and financial scandals involving various MPs and cabinet ministers (widely known as "sleaze"). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. On the international stage, he deployed British troops to the [[Gulf War]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Over the 1990s, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] moved towards the [[Centrism|centre]] and won several by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|access-date=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832, announcing his resignation as leader of the Conservative party shortly thereafter.

Major was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as party leader in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], and has since pursued his interests in business and charity work. By the end of his premiership Major was reviled by many in his party and the press as being a weak and unassertive leader, however his time in office has come to be reappraised in more recent years, with many pointing to his successes in the Northern Irish peace process, restoring economic growth, reforming the public sector, boosting the profile of arts and sports, and preserving British influence on the international stage.{{refn|group=nb| In 1999 a BBC Radio 4 poll [[Historical rankings of prime ministers of the United Kingdom|ranked him 17th of 19]] among 20th-century British prime ministers;<ref>{{cite news|title=Churchill 'greatest PM of 20th Century'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/579061.stm|publisher=BBC|date=26 December 1999|access-date=20 October 2018}}</ref> in 2016 a [[Historical rankings of prime ministers of the United Kingdom#2016 University of Leeds survey|University of Leeds survey]] ranked him 6th of 13 among post-war prime ministers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Britain's post-war prime ministers ranked by politics experts |url=https://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/3930/britains_post-war_prime_ministers_ranked_by_politics_experts |publisher=University of Leeds |access-date=6 December 2019 |date=13 October 2016}}</ref>}}

John Major was born on 29 March 1943 at [[St Helier Hospital|St Helier Hospital and Queen Mary's Hospital for Children]] in [[St Helier, London|St Helier]], Surrey, the son of Gwen Major (née Coates, 1905–1970) and former [[music hall]] performer [[Tom Major-Ball]] (1879–1962), who was 63 years old when Major was born.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sole.org.uk/johnmajor.htm |title=Ex Prime Minister Sir John Major and his Sewell Ancestors |publisher=Sole.org.uk |access-date=22 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030417/http://www.sole.org.uk/johnmajor.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was christened "John Roy Major" but only "John Major" was recorded on his [[birth certificate]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=V%2FaNpVve33l1lx1XfR4O5g&scan=1|title=Index entry|access-date=2 January 2018|website=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref>{{sfn|Major|2000|p=8-9}} he used his middle name until the early 1980s.<ref name="number2">{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/john-major |title=John Major |website=History and Tour |publisher=[[10 Downing Street]] |access-date=31 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011051246/http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/john-major |archive-date=11 October 2008 }}</ref> His birth had been a difficult one, with his mother suffering from [[pleurisy]] and [[pneumonia]] and John Major requiring several blood transfusions due to an infection, causing permanent scarring to his ankles.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=9}} The Major family (John, his parents, and his two older siblings [[Terry Major|Terry]] and Pat){{refn|group=nb|John also had two other half-siblings from his father's affairs which he was not to learn of until much later.<ref>{{harvnb|Major|2000|pp=4, 6}}</ref>}} lived at 260 Longfellow Road, [[Worcester Park]], Surrey, a middle-class area where Major's father ran a garden ornaments business and his mother worked in a local library and as a part-time dance teacher.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=8}} John Major later described the family's circumstances at this time as being "comfortable but not well off."{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=8}} Following a German [[V-1 flying bomb]] attack in the area in 1944 which killed several people, the Majors moved to the village of [[Saham Toney]], [[Norfolk]] for the duration of the [[World War II|war]].{{sfn|Major|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=9}}

John began attending primary school at Cheam Common School from 1948.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=10}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=11}} His childhood was generally happy, and he enjoyed reading, sports (especially [[cricket]] and [[association football|football]]) and keeping pets, such as his rabbits.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=10-12}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=11, 15}} In 1954 John passed the [[11+]] exam, enabling him to go to [[Rutlish School]], a [[grammar school]] in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], though to John's chagrin his father insisted that he register as 'John Major-Ball'.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=14}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=12-13}} The family's fortunes took a turn for the worse, with his father's health deteriorating,{{refn|group=nb|Tom Major had planned to move the family to Canada in his retirement, but his immigration application was rejected due to his failing eyesight.<ref>{{harvnb|Major|2000|p=15}}</ref>}} and the business in severe financial difficulties.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=15}} A recalled business loan which the family were unable to repay forced Tom Major to sell the house in Worcester Park in May 1955, with the family moving to a cramped, rented top-floor flat at 144 [[Coldharbour Lane]], [[Brixton]].{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=13}}{{sfn|Major|2000|p=16-17}}{{refn|group=nb|Major was later to learn that the flat was in fact owned by his half-brother Tom Moss.<ref>{{harvnb|Major|200|pp=17–8}}</ref>}} With his parents distracted by their reduced circumstances, John Major's difficulties at Rutlish went unnoticed; acutely conscious of his straitened circumstances vis-à-vis the other pupils, Major was something of a loner and consistently under-performed (except in sports), coming to see the school as "a penance to be endured."{{sfn|Major|2000|p=20-1}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=13,16}} Major left school just before his 16th birthday in 1959 with just three [[General Certificate of Education|O-level]] passes in History, English Language and English Literature, to his parents' disappointment.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=25}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=14}}{{refn|group=nb|In the 1999 BBC documentary ''The Major Years'', Major can be seen getting visibly upset when recalling this episode.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e4UZaMgIxE&t=291s Major Takes Over 1 of 3 – YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>}}

Major's interest in politics stems from this period, and he avidly kept up with current affairs by reading newspapers on his long commutes from Brixton to Wimbledon.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=19}} In 1956 Major met local MP [[Marcus Lipton]] at a local church fair and was invited to watch his first debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], where [[Harold Macmillan]] presented his only Budget as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].{{sfn|Major|2000|p=25-26}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=18-19}} Major has attributed his political ambitions to this event.<ref name="number2"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Harold MacMillan's only budget|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/budget97/background/bud1945_79.shtml|work=BBC News|access-date=1 August 2012}}</ref>

== Early post-school career (1959–1979) ==
Major's first job was as a clerk in the London-based insurance brokerage firm [[Alexander Forbes Group Holdings|Price Forbes]] in 1959, though finding the job dull and offering no prospects he quit.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=26-27}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=16}} Major began working with his brother Terry at the garden ornaments business; this had been sold in 1959, enabling the family to move to a larger residence at 80 Burton Road, Brixton.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=27-28}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=18}} Major's father died on 17 March 1962.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=29}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=18}} John left the ornaments business the following year to care for his ill mother, though when she got better he was unable to find a new job and was unemployed for much of the latter half of 1962, a situation he says was "degrading."{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=18}} After Major became Prime Minister, it was misreported that his failure to get a job as a bus conductor resulted from his failing to pass a maths test; he had in fact passed all of the necessary tests but had been passed over owing to his height.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=30}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=18}} In the meantime he studied for a qualification in banking via [[Distance education|correspondence course]].<ref>{{cite web|title=LSBF Great Minds Series :Sir John Major on Vocational Education|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9lOE3nBe6I|via=YouTube|access-date=9 March 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=21}} Eventually in December 1962 he found a job working at the [[London Electricity Board]] (LEB) in [[Elephant and Castle]].{{sfn|Major|2000|p=30}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=18}}

In 1959 Major had joined the [[Young Conservatives (UK)|Young Conservatives]] in Brixton and soon became a highly active member, which helped increase his confidence following the failure of his school days.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=28}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=19}} Encouraged by fellow Conservative Derek Stone, he started giving speeches on a [[soapbox|soap-box]] in [[Brixton Market]].{{sfn|Major|2000|p=28-29}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=18}} According to his biographer [[Anthony Seldon]], Major brought "youthful exuberance" to the Tories in Brixton, but was sometimes in trouble with the professional agent Marion Standing.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=19}} Major stood as a Councillor in the [[1964 Lambeth London Borough Council election]] for [[Larkhall (ward)|Larkhall ward]] at the age of 21 in 1964, losing to Labour.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=31}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=21}} He also assisted local Conservative candidates Kenneth Payne in the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]] and [[Piers Dixon]] in the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]].{{sfn|Major|2000|p=31}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=21-2}} Another formative influence on Major in this period was Jean Kierans, a divorcée 13 years his elder with two children who lived opposite the family on Burton Road, who became his mentor and lover. Seldon writes "She&nbsp;... made Major smarten his appearance, groomed him politically, and made him more ambitious and worldly."{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=21}} Major later moved in with Kierans when his family left Burton Road in 1965;{{sfn|Major|2000|p=33}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=21-2}} their relationship lasted from 1963 to sometime after 1968.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-young-john-major-and-the-older-woman-1571704.html|title=The young John Major and the older woman|date=6 February 1995|website=The Independent|access-date=6 February 2019}}</ref>

Major left the LEB and took up a post at [[District Bank]] in May 1965,{{sfn|Major|2000|p=32}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=21}} though he soon left this to join [[Standard Bank (historic)|Standard Bank]] the following year, largely because the latter offered the chance to work abroad.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=33}} In December 1966 he was sent for a long secondment in [[Jos, Nigeria]], which he enjoyed immensely, though he was put off by the casual [[racism]] of some of the ex-pat workers there.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=23}} In May 1967 he was involved in a serious car crash in which he broke a leg and had to be flown home.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=35-7}}<ref>{{cite web|title=John Major car crash in Nigeria |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world/articles/nigeria-reporters-blog |website=Channel 4 News |access-date=1 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406135514/http://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world/articles/nigeria-reporters-blog |archive-date=6 April 2010 }}</ref> Leaving hospital, he split his time between Jean Kierans' house and a small rented flat in [[Mayfair]], working at Standard Bank's London office and resuming his banking diploma and activities with the Young Conservatives in his spare time.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=37-8}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=25}}

Major stood again as Councillor in the [[1968 Lambeth London Borough Council election]], this time for [[Ferndale (ward)|Ferndale ward]]. Though a Labour stronghold, the Conservatives received a huge boost following [[Enoch Powell]]'s anti-immigration '[[Rivers of Blood speech]]' in April 1968 and Major won, despite strongly disapproving of Powell's views.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=38-40}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=27-8}} Major took a major interest in housing matters, with Lambeth notorious for overcrowding and poor quality rented accommodation.

Whilst Chief Secretary Major took part in discussions over the future funding of the [[National Health Service|NHS]], against the background of an NHS strike in February 1988 over pay, resulting in the 'Working for Patients' [[white paper]] and subsequent [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]].{{sfn|Major|2000|p=107}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=78}} Major also insisted in discussions with Thatcher that government assistance should be provided to support the sale of [[Short Brothers]] to [[Bombardier Inc.|Bombardier]], an aerospace company and major employer in Northern Ireland which might otherwise have collapsed.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=110}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=82}}

===Foreign Secretary (July–October 1989)===
In 1987–88 it became clear that Major had become a 'favourite' of [[Margaret Thatcher]] and he was widely tipped for further promotion.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=81-2}} Nevertheless, Major's appointment to [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] in July 1989 came as a surprise due to his relative lack of experience in the Cabinet and unfamiliarity with international affairs.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=111-12}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=89}} Major found the prospect daunting, and unsuccessfully attempted to convince Thatcher to allow him to stay on at the Treasury.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=111-12}} There were also fears within the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] (FCO) that Major would be Thatcher's 'hatchet-man', as her relations with the department under [[Geoffrey Howe]] had been poor and characterised by mutual distrust.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=87}} Major accepted the job and began to settle into the department, living in an upstairs room at the FCO and devolving decision making where necessary, though he found the increased security burdensome and disliked the extensive ceremonial aspects of the role.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=114-16}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=89-90}}

Amongst Major's first acts as Foreign Secretary was to cancel the sale of [[BAE Systems Hawk|Hawk aircraft]] to [[Iraq]], over concerns they would be used for internal repression.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=117-18}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=94}} He represented Britain at the Paris Peace Conference to determine the future of [[Cambodia]].{{sfn|Major|2000|p=118}} Major also met with [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[James Baker]], with whom he primarily discussed the issue of [[Vietnamese boat people]], and with [[Qian Qichen]], [[Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China|Foreign Minister]] of [[China]], becoming the first senior Western politician to meet with a Chinese official since the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|violent crackdown]] of pro-democracy protesters in [[Tiananmen Square]] the previous month.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=118-20}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=91-2}} Discussions focused primarily on the future of [[Hong Kong]], which Britain was scheduled to hand over to China in 1997.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=94}}

Major spent most of a summer holiday that year in Spain conducting extensive background reading on foreign affairs and British foreign policy.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=120-21}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=92}} Upon his return to the UK he and Thatcher met with French president [[François Mitterrand]], in which the future direction of the [[European Economic Community|European Community]] was discussed.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=121}} In September 1989 Major delivered a speech at the [[United Nations General Assembly]], in which he pledged to support [[Colombia]]'s effort to tackle the drugs trade and reiterated Britain's opposition to the [[apartheid]] regime in [[South Africa]].{{sfn|Major|2000|p=122-23}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=93-4}} Major also met US President [[George H.

Major's last major summit as Foreign Secretary was the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1989|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM) in [[Malaysia]]. The meeting was dominated by the issue of [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] on South Africa, with Britain being the only country to oppose them, on the grounds that they would end up hurting poorer South Africans far more than the apartheid regime at which they were aimed.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=125-26}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=96-7}} The summit ended acrimoniously, with Thatcher controversially and against established precedent issuing a second final communiqué stating Britain's opposition to sanctions, with the press seizing on the apparent disagreement on the matter between Major and Thatcher.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=125-28}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=96-7}}

===Chancellor of the Exchequer (1989–1990)===
After just three months as Foreign Secretary Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] on 26 October 1989 after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]], who had fallen out with Thatcher over what he saw as her excessive reliance on the advice of her Economic Adviser [[Alan Walters]].{{sfn|Major|2000|p=130}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=100-01}}<ref name=19891027guardian>{{cite news|last=Travis |first=Alan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1989/oct/27/past.christopherhuhne |title=Lawson sparks reshuffle |work=The Guardian |date= 27 October 1989|access-date=18 October 2009 |location=London}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Walters resigned soon after.<ref>{{cite web |title=Obituary – Sir Alan Walters |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/06/sir-alan-walters-obituary |work=The Guardian|date=6 January 2009|access-date=25 April 2020}}</ref>}} The appointment meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for a little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]]. Major made tackling [[inflation]] a priority, stating that tough measures were needed to bring it down and that "if it isn't hurting, it isn't working."{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=101}}{{sfn|Turner|2013|p=22}} He delivered his first [[Spring Statement|Autumn Statement]] on 15 November, announcing a boost in spending (mainly for the NHS) and with [[interest rate]]s to be kept as they were.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=140-41}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=104}}

As Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, on 20 March 1990.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=106}} He publicised it as a 'budget for savers', with the creations of the [[Tax-exempt special savings account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. Major also abolished the composite rate tax and [[stamp duty]] on share trades, whilst increasing taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and petrol.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=146}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=105-06}} Tax cuts were also made which benefited football associations, the aim being to increase funding on safety measures following the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] and [[Hillsborough disaster]].{{sfn|Major|2000|p=146-47}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=106}} Extra funding was also made available to Scotland in order to limit the impact of the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (widely dubbed the 'Poll Tax') which had been introduced there that year.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=148}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=106}}

The [[European Economic Community|European Community]]'s push for full [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]] (EMU) was another important factor in Major's time as Chancellor; in June 1990 he proposed that instead of a single European currency there could instead be a 'hard [[European Currency Unit|ECU]]',{{refn|group=nb|The European Currency Unit was a notional unit of account based on a weighted 'basket' of major European currencies. It was replaced with the physical Euro currency in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Brief History of the ECU, the Predecessor of the Euro |url=http://fx.sauder.ubc.ca/ECU.html |publisher=UBC Sauder School of Business|access-date=25 April 2020}}</ref>}} which different national currencies could compete against and, if the ECU was successful, could lead to a single currency.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=150-51}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=107-08}} The move was seen as a wrecking tactic by France and Germany, especially when the increasingly [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|Euro-sceptic]] Thatcher announced her outright opposition to EMU, and the idea was abandoned.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=152}} More successfully, Major managed to get the new [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD) located in London.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=149}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=107}}

By early 1990 Major had become convinced that the best way to combat inflation and restore macroeconomic stability would be if the British pound were to join the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM), and he and [[Douglas Hurd]] (Major's successor as Foreign Secretary) set about trying to convince a reluctant Thatcher to join it.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=155}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=110-12}}<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945–90'' (Harper Collins, 1997), pp. 541–50.</ref> The move was supported by the [[Bank of England]], the Treasury, most of the Cabinet, the Labour Party, several major business associations and much of the press.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=111}}{{sfn|Turner|2013|p=84}} With the '[[Lawson Boom]]' showing signs of running out of steam, exacerbated by rising oil prices following Iraq's [[invasion of Kuwait]] in August 1990, there were fears of a potential recession and pressure to cut interest rates.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=159-60}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=113}} Thatcher finally agreed on 4 October, and Britain's entry into the ERM at a rate of [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 2.95 to £1.00 (with an agreed 6% floating 'band' either side) was announced the following day.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=163}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=113-14}} An interest rate cut of 1% (from 15%) was also announced on the same day.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=164}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=113}}

The rest of Major's Chancellorship prior to the leadership contest was largely uneventful; he considered granting the Bank of England operational independence over monetary policy, with the ability to set interest rates, but decided against it.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=154}}{{refn|group=nb|This was later enacted under Labour Chancellor [[Gordon Brown]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chancellor announces new framework for monetary policy |url=http://archive.treasury.gov.uk/press/1997/p40_97.html |publisher=HM Treasury |date=6 May 1997 |access-date=27 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720163816/http://archive.treasury.gov.uk/press/1997/p40_97.html |archive-date=20 July 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>}} He also agreed a restructuring and write-off of some [[Debt of developing countries|Third World debt]] at a Commonwealth Finance Ministers meeting in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] in September 1990.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=165}}

====Conservative Party leadership contest====

Opposition within the Conservative Party to [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been brewing for some time, focusing on what was seen as her brusque, imperious style and the Poll Tax, which was facing serious opposition across the country.

leadership bid]] by [[Sir Anthony Meyer, 3rd Baronet|Anthony Meyer]]; though she won easily, 60 MPs had not voted for her, and it was rumoured that many more had had to be strong-armed into supporting her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2009/02/father-thatcher-european |title=The stalking horse |last=Meyer |first=Ashley |date=26 February 2009 |publisher=New Statesman |access-date=8 January 2013}}</ref><ref name="GH6Dec1989">{{cite news |last1=Parkhouse |first1=Geoffrey |title=Bruising Win for Thatcher |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19891206&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |access-date=22 December 2019 |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=6 December 1989 |page=1}}</ref><ref name="89election">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/5/newsid_2528000/2528339.stm|access-date=1 November 2008|title=5 December 1989: Thatcher beats off leadership rival|work=On This Day 1950–2005|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> By early 1990 it was clear that bills for many under the new Poll Tax regime would be higher than anticipated, and opposition to the Tax grew, with a non-payment campaign gaining much support and an anti-Poll Tax demonstration in [[Trafalgar Square]] in March ending in [[Poll tax riots|rioting]].<ref name="Revealed">{{citation |title=Revealed: How police panic played into the hand of the poll tax rioters|last=Verkaik|first=Robert|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/revealed-how-police-panic-played-into-the-hands-of-the-poll-tax-rioters-523918.html|date=21 January 2006|work=The Independent |page=10|access-date=17 May 2008}}</ref> The Conservatives lost the [[1990 Mid Staffordshire by-election]] to Labour and the [[1990 Eastbourne by-election]] to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], both Conservative seats, causing many Conservative MPs to worry about their prospects at the upcoming general election, due in 1991 or 1992.<ref name="Times 92">{{cite book|title=The Times Guide to the House of Commons April 1992|date=1992|publisher=Times Book|location=London|isbn=0-7230-0497-8|page=286}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Seldon |first1=Anthony |author2=Daniel Collings |title=Britain under Thatcher |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |pages=60}}</ref>{{sfn|Major|2000|p=173}} Thatcher's staunch anti-European stance also alienated pro-Europe Conservatives.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=175-76}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=113}} On 1 November the pro-European Deputy Prime Minister [[Geoffrey Howe]] resigned, issuing a fiercely critical broadside against Thatcher in the House of Commons on 13 November.<ref name="Observer">{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Rawnsley |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/10/geoffrey-how-the-cabinet-ally-who-became-thatchers-assassin |title=Geoffrey Howe, the close cabinet ally who became Thatcher's assassin |work=The Observer |date=10 October 2015 |access-date=11 March 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Major|2000|p=179}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=120}}

Major became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] on 28 November 1990 when he accepted [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]]'s invitation to form a government, succeeding [[Margaret Thatcher]]. His term ended with his resignation on 2 May 1997. While serving as Prime Minister, Major also served as the [[First Lord of the Treasury]], the [[Minister for the Civil Service]] and the Leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. He was succeeded by [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]] after the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]].

== Final years in Parliament (1997–2001) ==
Although many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on: they argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38–39}} Major refused, saying: "It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony."{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}

Major served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmwib/wb970517/oppo.htm|title=Weekly Information Bulletin: 17th May 1997 |publisher=House of Commons |date=17 May 1997 |access-date=26 April 2020}}</ref> Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] (having served as Foreign Secretary for three months in 1989) and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party no longer had any Scottish MPs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1545049.stm |title=Tories appoint new Scottish chairman |publisher=BBC |date=14 September 2001 |access-date=26 April 2020}}</ref> Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gulfnews.com/today-history/june-19-1997-tories-pick-young-hague-1.2045680 |title=June 19, 1997: Tories pick young Hague| publisher=Gulf News |date=18 June 2007 |access-date=26 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/115223.stm |title=Hague's first year – a chronology|publisher=BBC |date=18 June 1998 |access-date=26 April 2020}}</ref>

Like some post-war former Prime Ministers (such as [[Edward Heath]]), Major turned down a [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peerage]] when he retired from the House of Commons in 2001.

In December 2006, Major led calls for an independent inquiry into Tony Blair's decision to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invade Iraq]], following revelations made by [[Carne Ross]], a former British senior diplomat, that contradicted Blair's case for the invasion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2079340.ece |title=John Major leads calls for inquiry into conflict |date=16 December 2006 |work=The Independent |location=London |access-date=17 December 2006 |first1=Colin |last1=Brown |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108174201/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2079340.ece |archive-date=8 January 2007 }}</ref>

He was touted as a possible Conservative candidate for the [[2008 London mayoral election|Mayor of London elections in 2008]], but turned down an offer from Conservative leader [[David Cameron]].

Following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] Major announced his support for the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition]], and stated that he hoped for a "[[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]]" alliance beyond 2015, criticising Labour under [[Ed Miliband]] for playing "party games" rather than serving the national interest.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11981011|title=BBC News&nbsp;– Ed Miliband asks Lib Dems to help draw up Labour policy|work=BBC News|date=13 December 2010|access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11852628|title=Sir John Major urges Tory and Lib Dem pact to continue|work=BBC News|date=27 November 2010|access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref> Nevertheless, in 2013 Major expressed his concern at the seeming decline in [[social mobility]] in Britain: "In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class.

===Brexit===
Major was a vocal supporter for the Remain camp in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]] on Britain's membership of the European Union. John Major supported a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|second referendum]] over [[Brexit]], stating that the leave campaign put out a "fantasy case" during the referendum campaign, adding that to describe a second vote as undemocratic was "a rather curious proposition" and that he could see no "intellectual argument" against redoing the ballot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sir John Major condemns Boris Johnson for 'routine attacks' on PM without 'any coherent' Brexit plan|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-boris-johnson-john-major-negotiations-a8560751.html|access-date=10 July 2019|work=[[The Independent]]|date=29 September 2018}}</ref> Major feared Brexit will make the UK poorer and could endanger the peace settlement in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite news|title=John Major calls for Commons vote on second referendum|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/28/john-major-calls-for-commons-vote-on-second-referendum|access-date=10 July 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 February 2018}}</ref>

On 30 August 2019, it was announced that Major intended to join [[R (Miller) v The Prime Minister and Cherry v Advocate General for Scotland|a court case by Gina Miller]] against the [[2019 British prorogation controversy|proroguing of Parliament]] by the Prime Minister, [[Boris Johnson]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://edition.cnn.com/uk/live-news/brexit-talks-challenge-intl-gbr/index.html |title = Boris Johnson faces Brexit challenges as he steps up talks with EU: Live updates|date = 30 August 2019}}</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] Major urged voters to vote tactically against candidates supporting Boris Johnson when those candidates wanted a hard Brexit. Major said Brexit is, "the worst foreign policy decision in my lifetime. It will affect nearly every single aspect of our lives for many decades to come. It will make our country poorer and weaker. It will hurt most those who have least. Never have the stakes been higher, especially for the young. Brexit may even break up our historic United Kingdom."<ref>{{cite news|title=General election: Former Tory PM John Major urges people to vote against Boris Johnson's candidates|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-general-election-campaign-john-major-conservatives-vote-a9235436.html|work=The Independent|date=December 2019|access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref> In early 2020, after the UK formally left the EU with [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|an initial deal]], Major expressed his concerns about a future trading deal with the EU being "flimsy".<ref>{{cite news|title=John Major warns rushed UK-EU trade deal will be 'flimsy'|url=https://www.ft.com/content/dd9b1d66-4de2-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5|work=The Financial Times|date=13 February 2020|access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref>

==Assessment and legacy==
[[File:Sir John Major - geograph.org.uk - 1367859.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bust of Major by [[Shenda Amery]] in Huntingdon Library.]]
Major's mild-mannered style and moderate political stance contrasted with that of Thatcher, and made him theoretically well-placed to act as a conciliatory and relatively uncontroversial leader of his party. In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the "Euro-rebels" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=736-7}} Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion, led by [[Bill Cash]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier, with many viewing him as a weak and vacillating leader.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=736-7}} Ongoing 'sleaze'-related scandals among leading Conservative MPs also did Major and his government no favours, decreasing support for the party amongst the public. His task became even more difficult after the election of the modernist and highly media-savvy Tony Blair as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour leader]] in July 1994, who mercilessly exploited Conservative divisions whilst shifting Labour to the centre, thus making it much more electable.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7593554.stm |work=BBC News | title=Who has been UK's greatest post-war PM? | date=16 September 2008}}</ref> Whilst few observers doubted that Major was an honest and decent man, or that he made sincere and sometimes successful attempts to improve life in Britain and to unite his deeply divided party, he was also perceived as a weak and ineffectual figure, and his approval ratings for most of his time in office were low, particularly after "[[Black Wednesday]]" in September 1992 which destroyed the Conservative's reputation for effective economic management.<ref>{{cite news|title=30 January 1997: 'Weak, weak, weak'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/historic_moments/newsid_8188000/8188574.stm|work=BBC News|access-date=19 July 2012|date=31 October 2009}}</ref>

Major defended his government in his memoirs, focusing particularly on how under him the British economy had recovered from the recession of 1990–1993. He wrote that "during my premiership interest rates fell from 14% to 6%; unemployment was at 1.75&nbsp;million when I took office, and at 1.6&nbsp;million and falling upon my departure; and the government's annual borrowing rose from [[pound sterling|£]]0.5&nbsp;billion to nearly £46&nbsp;billion at its peak before falling to £1&nbsp;billion".{{sfn|Major|2000|p=689}} Major's Chancellor [[Kenneth Clarke|Ken Clarke]] stated in 2016 that Major's reputation looked better as time went by, in contrast to that of Tony Blair's which appeared to be in decline.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rice|first1=Michael|title=In Depth BBC Interview: Ken Clarke|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox24s3NylMI&t=1808s|access-date=26 July 2017}}</ref> [[Paddy Ashdown]], the Leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] during Major's term of office, was more sympathetic, writing in 2017 that Major was "one of the most honest, brave and sincere men to ever be Prime Minister" and that his time in office compares favourably with that of his successor Tony Blair.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ashdown |first=Paddy |editor1-last=Hickson |editor1-first=Kevin |editor2-last=Williams |editor2-first=Ben |title=John Major – An Unsuccessful Prime Minister?

Writing shortly after he left office, the historian and journalist [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] wrote that Major was "a hopeless leader" who "should never have been Prime Minister."{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=735}} The sentiments echoed that of much of the press at the time, which was generally hostile to Major, especially after Black Wednesday. The journalist [[Peter Oborne]] was one such figure, though writing in 2017 he stated that he now regrets his negative reporting, stating that he himself and the press in general were "grossly unfair to Major" and that this was motivated at least in part by snobbery at Major's humble upbringing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Oborne |first=Peter |editor1-last=Hickson |editor1-first=Kevin |editor2-last=Williams |editor2-first=Ben |title=John Major – An Unsuccessful Prime Minister?

Reappraising John Major |publisher=Biteback Publishing  |date=2017 |pages=xiii–xiv |chapter=Foreword |isbn=978-1-785-90271-0}}</ref> Others remain unconvinced however and, writing in 2011, the BBC's Home editor [[Mark Easton]] judged that "Majorism" had made little lasting impact.<ref name=intro-cam>{{cite news|last=Easton|first=Mark|title=Introducing Cameronism|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14115047|access-date=11 July 2011|work=BBC News UK|date=11 July 2011|author-link=Mark Easton|quote="Majorism and [[Brownism]] are unconvincing stubs. History appears to have decided they may have re-upholstered the settee and scattered a few cushions but they didn't alter the [[feng shui]] of the room."}}</ref>

In academic circles Major's legacy has generally been more well received. Mark Stuart, writing in 2017, stated that Major is "the best ex-Prime Minister we have ever had", praising him for initiating the Northern Ireland peace process, peacefully handing Hong Kong back to China, creating the National Lottery and leaving a sound economy to Labour in 1997.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://nottspolitics.org/2017/04/10/john-major-at-25-the-best-ex-prime-minister-weve-ever-had/|title=John Major at 25: the best ex-Prime Minister we've ever had?|publisher=School of Politics & International Relations, University of Nottingham |access-date=16 July 2020 | date=10 April 2017}}</ref> [[Dennis Kavanagh]] likewise states that Major did relatively well considering the unbridgeable divides that existed in the Conservative Party in the 1990s, chiefly over Europe, whilst also delivering economic growth, a more user-focused public sector and the basis of peace settlement in Northern Ireland.<ref name="Kavanagh">{{cite news|url=https://journals.openedition.org/osb/717 |title=John Major's political legacy |author=Dennis Kavanagh| publisher=Observatoire de la société britannique |date= 2009 |access-date=16 July 2020}}</ref> He also notes that Major's unexpected 1992 election victory effectively sealed in the Thatcher-era reforms and forced the Labour Party to ditch most of its more socialist-tinged policies, thereby permanently shifting the British political landscape to the centre ground.<ref name="Kavanagh"/> [[Anthony Seldon]] largely agrees with this assessment, adding that Major's deep dislike of discrimination contributed to the continuing decline in [[racism]] and [[homophobia]] in British society, and that his proactive foreign policy stance maintained Britain's influence in the world at a time of profound global change.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=738-44}} He also notes that Major faced a deeply unfavourable set of circumstances: most of the obvious and pressing Conservative reforms (e.g. reigning in the power of trade unions and privatising failing industries) had already being completed under Thatcher, the swift nature of his rise to power left him little time to formulate policy positions and upon becoming PM he was immediately thrust into having to deal with the Gulf War and a major recession. Furthermore, the narrow majority achieved after the 1992 election left him exposed to internal Conservative rebellions, which only worsened as time went by, abetted by a hostile press, as it became clear the Conservatives would lose the next election.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=739-41}} Seldon concludes that "Major was neither non-entity nor failure. His will be judged an important if unruly premiership at the end of the Conservative century, completing some parts of an earlier agenda while in some key respects helping to define a Conservatism for the 21st century."{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=743}} Seldon reiterated these views in his contribution to the 2017 volume ''John Major: An Unsuccessful Prime Minister?''<ref>{{cite book |last=Seldon|first=Anthony|editor1-last=Hickson |editor1-first=Kevin |editor2-last=Williams |editor2-first=Ben |title=John Major – An Unsuccessful Prime Minister? Reappraising John Major |publisher=Biteback Publishing  |date=2017 |pages=325–39 |chapter=22. An Overall Assessment |isbn=978-1-785-90271-0}}</ref> Political historian Robert Taylor, in his 2006 biography of Major, concurs with many of these points, summing up that "In the perspective provided by the years of New Labour government since May 1997, John Major's record as Prime Minister looked much better than his many critics liked to suggest... Britain's most extraordinary Conservative Prime Minister bequeathed an important legacy to this party and his country to build on. One day both yet may come to recognise and appreciate it."<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Robert |title=20 British Prime Ministers of the 20th century – Major |publisher=Haus Publishing  |date=2006 |pages=115, 126 |isbn=978-1-904-95072-1}}</ref> Noted political historian [[Dick Leonard]] however, writing in 2004, was more harsh in his assessment, concluding that Major was "A man of evident decent instincts, but limited abilities: as Prime Minister he pushed these abilities to the limit. It was not enough."<ref>{{cite book |last=Leonard |first=Dick |title= A Century of Premiers: Salisbury to Blair |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan  |date=2004 |pages=341 |isbn= 978-0-230-51150-7}}</ref>

==Representation in the media==
[[File:John Major (6357734833).jpg|thumb|left|Major at Chatham House in 2011.]]
During his leadership of the Conservative Party, Major was portrayed as honest ("Honest John")<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/honest-john-versus-tricky-tony-1283252.html |title=Honest John versus Tricky Tony... |publisher=The Independent |author=[[Andrew Marr]] |date=15 January 1997 |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/honest-john-gives-it-to-us-straight-stale-buns-and-all-hc0rnm5s88w |title=Honest John gives it to us straight – stale buns and all |work=The Times |date=13 June 2012 |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> but unable to exert effective control over his fractious party. However his polite, easy-going manner was initially well received by both his supporters and his critics.{{sfn|Turner|2013|p=20-21}} Major's appearance was noted for its greyness, his prodigious [[philtrum]], and large glasses, all of which were exaggerated in caricatures. For example, in ''[[Spitting Image]]'', Major's puppet was changed from a circus performer to that of a literally grey man who ate dinner with his wife in silence, occasionally saying "nice peas, dear", while at the same time nursing an unrequited crush on his colleague [[Virginia Bottomley]] – an invention, but an ironic one in view of his affair with [[Edwina Currie]], which was not then a matter of public knowledge. By the end of his premiership his puppet would often be shown observing the latest fiasco and ineffectually murmuring "oh dear".{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=204-05}}{{sfn|Turner|2013|p=19}} Long-standing Conservative MP [[Enoch Powell]], when asked about Major, stated "I simply find myself asking – does he really exist?",{{sfn|Turner|2013|p=18}} whereas on the left Labour's [[Alastair Campbell]] dismissed him as a "piece of [[lettuce]] that passes for prime minister"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/over-the-top-look-whos-talking-but-maybe-campbell-has-a-point-on-the-press-777320.html |title=Over the top?

Major was also satirised by Patrick Wright with his book ''101 Uses for a John Major'' (based on a comic book of some 10 years earlier called ''[[101 Uses for a Dead Cat]]''), in which Major was illustrated serving a number of bizarre purposes, such as a train-spotter's anorak or as a flag-pole;<ref>{{cite news|url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17896779W/101_Uses_for_a_John_Major|title=101 Uses for a John Major|publisher=Open Library |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/wright_patrick.htm|title=Patrick Wright|publisher=Lambiek Comiclopedia |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> Wright published a second collection of '101 Uses', as well as a parodic cartoon biography of Major entitled ''Not Inconsiderable: Being the Life and Times of John Major''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13429493-the-not-inconsiderable|title=Not Inconsiderable: Being the Life and Times of John Major |publisher=Good Reads|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref>

The impressionist comedian [[Rory Bremner]] often mocked John Major, for example depicting him as 'John 90', a play on 1960s puppet show ''[[Joe 90]]'';<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdnxvspLH28 John Major As John 90 – YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=205}} his impersonation was so accurate that he managed to fool the MP [[Richard Body]] that he was really speaking to Major in a [[prank phone call]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/media/rory-bremner-prank-pm-calls-bring-down-government-revealed-1353264|title=Rory Bremner's impression of John Major was so good, there were fears he could 'bring down the government' |author=Adam Sherwin|publisher=The i|date=2 January 2020 |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> The incident prompted [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet Secretary]] [[Robin Butler]] to warn Channel 4 head [[Michael Grade]] against any further calls for fear that state secrets could be inadvertently leaked.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/cabinet-secretary-%E2%80%98voiced-security-fears-over-rory-bremner%E2%80%99s-impersonation-john-major|title=Cabinet secretary 'voiced security fears' over Rory Bremner's impersonation of John Major |author=Jim Dunton|publisher=Civil Service World|date=3 January 2020 |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref>

Major was often mocked for his nostalgic evocation of what sounded like the lost Britain of the 1950s {{xref|(see [[Merry England]])}};{{Sfn|Taylor|2006|p=29}} for example, his famous speech stating that "Fifty years from now Britain will still be the country of long shadows on county grounds, warm beer, invincible green suburbs, dog lovers and pools fillers and – as George Orwell said – 'old maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the morning mist'."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.johnmajorarchive.org.uk/1990-1997/mr-majors-speech-to-conservative-group-for-europe-22-april-1993/ |title=Mr Major's Speech to Conservative Group for Europe |publisher=John Major official site |date=22 April 1993 |access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref> Major complained in his memoirs that these words (which drew upon a passage in [[George Orwell]]'s essay ''[[The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius|The Lion and the Unicorn]]'')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/the-lion-and-the-unicorn-socialism-and-the-english-genius/ |title=The Lion and the Unicorn |publisher=Orwell Foundation |access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref> had been misrepresented as being more naive and romantic than he had intended, and indeed his memoirs were dismissive of the common conservative viewpoint that there was once a time of moral rectitude; Major wrote that "life has never been as simple as that". Throughout his time in office Major was often acutely sensitive to criticism of him in the press; his biographer Anthony Seldon posits this to an inner vulnerability stemming from his difficult childhood and adolescence.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=204-05}} After leaving office, Major stated that "Perhaps up to a point I was too sensitive about some of the things in the press, I’m happy to concede that. But, the politicians who are said to have hides like rhinos and be utterly impervious to criticism, if they’re not extinct, they are very rare and I freely confess I wasn't amongst them."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.johnmajorarchive.org.uk/1997-2001-parliament/john-majors-contributions-in-the-the-major-years-15-october-1999/ |title=John Major's Contributions in the 'The Major Years' – 15 October 1999 |publisher=John Major official site |date=15 October 1999 |access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref>
