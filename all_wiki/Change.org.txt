On April 29, 2018, two nights after the release of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', Ryan Leger from [[Bolton, Ontario]] started a petition for [[Marvel Studios]] to extend [[Mark Ruffalo]]'s contract for him to appear in an ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)#Future|Incredible Hulk 2]]'' and for [[Universal Pictures]] to let [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Disney]] have the distribution rights to any potential post-''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' [[Hulk]] films and Disney, in return, give Universal, for each, a marquee credit (including placement of the studio's [[Production logo|opening logo]]) and 8-9% of the profits as they have for [[Paramount Pictures]] with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.<ref>https://comicbookrumors.com/petition-for-mark-ruffalo-to-get-his-own-post-avengers-4-hulk-film/</ref>

=== Australia===
In 2018 an anonymous creator of a Facebook community built on hatred for people riding bikes started a Change.org anti-cycling petition that has grown in a short time to reach over 100,000 signatures. Allegedly, there is evidence many of the names on the petition are fake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/massive-anticycling-petition-full-of-false-names-claims-bicycle-queensland-ceo/news-story/fdf3e0dd06aa3343948dce1020df03b1|title=Massive anti-cycling petition 'legitimate'|date=May 31, 2018|website=www.couriermail.com.au}}</ref>

In 2019, a petition directed towards the Australian government to remove Senator [[Fraser Anning]] from the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Federal Parliament]] after his comments on the [[Christchurch mosque shootings|terrorist attack]] in [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]]. Anning blamed immigration laws, the victims and heightening fears of [[Muslims]] for the attack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/disgusting-morrison-slams-senator-s-comments-on-christchurch-massacre-20190315-p514oj.html|title='Disgusting': Morrison slams Senator's comments on Christchurch massacre|last=Bourke|first=Latika|date=March 15, 2019|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref> The petition (as at 10:11 AM UTC on March 24, 2019) has 1,418,105 signatures, making it one of the second most signed petitions on Change.org, and the highest concerning Australian affairs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/petition-to-remove-fraser-anning-after-new-zealand-shooting-egging-at-1-million-signatures-2019-3|title=Over 1 million people have signed a petition to remove Fraser Anning following his comments on the New Zealand shooting|last=Shead|first=Sam|date=March 18, 2019|website=Business Insider Australia|language=en|access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref>

=== Mexico===
After two earthquakes hit Central Mexico on [[2017 Chiapas earthquake|September 7]] and [[2017 Central Mexico earthquake|September 19]], 2017, there were different petitions to force the "[[Instituto Nacional Electoral]]" (''National Electoral Institute''), the [[Mexican Senate]], and President [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] to donate most or all of the money destined for the upcoming [[2018 Mexican general election|2018 general elections]] be redirected to victims of the natural disaster in Mexico City and neighbor states of [[Morelos]], [[Chiapas]], [[Oaxaca]], and [[Puebla]]. All petitions together sum the number of more than 3 million signatures.<ref>{{cite news |author=Redacción GQ |title=México rompe récord en Change.Org, ahora solo falta que lo escuchen |url=https://www.gq.com.mx/actualidad/articulos/mexico-rompe-record-de-firmas-en-change-org/8935 |location=Mexico |date=September 22, 2017 |access-date=September 22, 2017 |language=es}}</ref>

==Business model==
Change.org makes revenue through a subscription membership model, people promoting petitions on the site, and crowdfunding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/why-change-org-s-army-of-davids-is-neutering-more-global-goliaths-20180228-p4z24h.html|title=Why Change.org's Army of Davids is Neutering More Global Goliaths|last=Bryant|first=Nick|date=March 3, 2018|website=smh.com.au|language=en|access-date=August 21, 2018}}</ref>

Change.org members contribute monthly to sustain the technology and the small teams of campaigners who coach and support petition starters. The majority of the company's revenue is advertising - individuals and organisations who start or sign petitions then chip in to promote those petitions to other site visitors.

To date, Change.org has raised $50 million to fuel its growth from mission-aligned investors in business, technology and the media. In 2017 an investment round driven by [[Reid Hoffman]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/05/26/reid-hoffman-change-org/|title=LinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman Invests Big Change In Change.org|work=Fortune|access-date=August 21, 2018|language=en}}</ref> helped drive the shift to the current business model.

The website previously made revenue by running advertisements called sponsored campaigns for advocacy organizations such as [[Amnesty International]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Mui|first=Ylan M|title=Change.org Emerges as Influential Advocate on Issues from Bullying to Bank Fees|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/changeorg-emerges-as-influential-advocate/2012/01/09/gIQAoCJHLQ_story.html| work = [[The Washington Post]]|date=January 24, 2012}}</ref> 
and list-building services to partner organizations.<ref>{{cite news|author=Martin, Courtney E. |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/164338/you-are-now-now-future-online-feminism|title= 'You Are the NOW of Now!' The Future of (Online) Feminism| work =[[The Nation]]|date= November 2, 2011}}</ref>
In May 2013 the website started "crowd-promoted petitions" that allowed a signatory to promote the petition by paying $5 to $1000 at the final stage of petition signing.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

==Criticism==

===Fake signatures===
In 2018, Anne Savage, the CEO of Bicycle Queensland, claimed that a massive Australian–based anti-cycling petition on Change.org was full of false names. She said Bicycle Queensland had received information that many of the names were created by electronic “bots”. A spokesperson for Change.org denied that the signatures were fake, saying that the organisation's engineering team had double-checked the petition and confirmed they had not detected any unusual activity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/massive-anticycling-petition-full-of-false-names-claims-bicycle-queensland-ceo/news-story/fdf3e0dd06aa3343948dce1020df03b1|title=Massive anti-cycling petition 'legitimate'|date=May 31, 2018|website=www.couriermail.com.au}}</ref>

===Visibility of personal information===
Under certain conditions,<ref>{{cite web|title=Privacy Policy {{!}} Change.org|url=http://www.change.org/about/privacy|publisher=Change.org|accessdate= March 19, 2012}}</ref>{{vague|date=January 2015}} signatures and other private information including email addresses can be found by search engines. Change.org operates a system for signature hiding, which works only if the user has an account on Change.org.<ref>{{cite web|title=I want my name off of this petition immediately! : The Change.org Help Desk|url=http://helpdesk.change.org/entries/20272227-i-want-my-name-off-of-this-petition-immediately|publisher=Change.org|accessdate= March 19, 2012}}</ref> Conversely, the platform has been criticized for not providing enough information on who has signed a petition; for instance a means of verifying that a petition protesting a politician has been signed by his or her constituents or that the signatures are genuine at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-29/change-org-is-amplifying-the-power-of-a-signature|title=Change.org Is Amplifying the Power of a Signature|first=Sarah|last=Issenberg|publisher=Bloomberg|date=May 29, 2015|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}</ref>

===Corporate structure===
There has been debate and criticism<ref>{{cite web|title=Is Change.org about Real Change or Just Pocket Change? |url=http://chieforganizer.org/2012/06/20/is-change-org-about-real-change-or-just-pocket-change/

The site has been accused of fooling its users and hiding the fact that it is "a for-profit entity that has an economic incentive to get people to sign petitions".

{{quote|text=Change.org is being deliberately deceitful through the use of the change.org name. I'd suspect that the average change.org user does not know that Change.org is a for-profit corporation, and that the corporation plans on using the contact information being provided to them to earn revenue.|sign=[[Clay Johnson (technologist)|Clay Johnson]]<ref name="changebiz"/>}}

Change.org spokesperson Charlotte Hill countered this criticism in a September 2013 article in ''[[Wired Magazine|Wired]]'', saying, "We are a mission-driven social enterprise, and while we bring in revenue, we reinvest 100% of that revenue back into our mission of empowering ordinary people. It's not just that we're not yet making a profit – it's that we are decidedly not for-profit." <ref>{{cite news|last=Klint|first=Finley|title=Meet Change.org, the Google of Modern Politics|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/09/change-org/|accessdate=October 7, 2013|newspaper=Wired Magazine|date=September 26, 2013}}</ref>

===Advertising policy===
In 2012, the site dropped most of the restrictions it previously placed on paid content. Internal documents began referring to "clients" and "partners" as "advertisers" and stated that "only advertisers strictly identified as 'hate groups' are to be banned."<ref name="kos">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/23/1149092/-Change-org-sells-out-progressive-movement|title=Change.org sells out progressive movement|first=Raven|last=Brooks|publisher=Daily Kos|date=October 23, 2012|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}</ref><ref name="karoli">{{cite web|url=http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/why-i-will-not-sign-another-changeorg-petit|title=Why I Will Not Sign Another Change.org Petition Ever|publisher=[[Crooks and Liars]]|date=October 24, 2012|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}</ref> As a result, Change.org was accused of encouraging [[astroturfing]] and abandoning the progressive user base from which it initially gained traction. Additional controversy arose when the employee who initially leaked the documents was fired.<ref name="karoli" /> Of the users who lost interest in the site after this change, a number of them expressed difficulty in being removed from Change.org mailing lists.<ref name="kos" />

===Selling of personal data===
Change.org has also been accused of selling the personal data provided by the users to third-party companies that hire its services.<ref name="changebiz"/>

===Use for trending topics===
Topics for Change.org petitions have grown to include disagreement with the [[Academy Awards]] and removing milk from certain types of coffee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-starbucks-vegan-pumpkin-spice-latte-20130912-story.html|first=Jenn|last=Harris|title="First world problem": Vegans want Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Lattes too|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 12, 2013|accessdate=December 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.tradical360.com/7-dumbest-change-org-petitions-ever-created/ |first=Becky |last=Radolf |title=The 7 Dumbest Change.org Petitions Ever Created |publisher=Tradical |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=December 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217055129/http://blog.tradical360.com/7-dumbest-change-org-petitions-ever-created/ |archive-date=December 17, 2014 }}</ref> The authors of these petitions have been criticized for focusing on “[[first world problems]]”.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/apartment-tenants-start-changeorg-petition-over-package-delivery-really-7428094|title=Apartment tenants start Change.org petition over package delivery.

Go figure.|publisher=Things That Matter|date=November 20, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2014}}</ref>

===Donations===
Change.org solicits signers to also donate money upon signing the petition. Although the donation is optional, it can be misleading to users who may believe the donations are used to fund petition organizers. It is unknown as to what Change.org uses donations for, however, the donations are likely used for their own profit.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Holmes |first1=Aaron |title=Change.org doesn't donate the money raised through its record-breaking George Floyd petition — and some donors say they feel misled |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/change-org-george-floyd-donations-petition-keeps-money-2020-6 |website=Business Insider}}</ref>
