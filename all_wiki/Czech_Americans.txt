}} {{Czechs}}

'''Czech Americans''' ({{lang-cz|Čechoameričané}}), known in the 19th and early 20th century as '''Bohemian Americans''', are citizens of the United States who are of [[Czechs|Czech descent]]. Czechs originate from the [[Czech lands]], a term which refers to the majority of the traditional [[lands of the Bohemian Crown]], namely [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Czech Silesia]]. These lands over time have been governed by a variety of states, including the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], the [[Austrian Empire]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and the [[Czech Republic]] also known by its short-form name, Czechia. Germans from the Czech lands who emigrated to the United States usually identified as [[German American]], or, more specifically, as Americans of [[German Bohemian]] descent. According to the [[United States 2000 Census|2000 US census]], there are 1,262,527 Americans of full or partial Czech descent, in addition to 441,403 persons who list their ancestry as [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]]. Historical information about Czechs in America is available thanks to people such as [[Mila Rechcigl]].

==History==
The first documented case of the entry of [[Czechs]] to the North American shores is of [[Joachim Gans]] of [[Prague]], who came to [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]], [[North Carolina]] in 1585 with an expedition of explorers organized by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] (1552–1618).

[[Augustine Herman]] (1621–1686) was the first documented Czech settler. He was a [[surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]] and skilled [[technical drawing|draftsman]], successful planter and developer of new lands, a shrewd and enterprising merchant, a bold politician and effective diplomat, fluent in several languages. After coming to [[New Amsterdam]] (present [[New York (state)|New York]]) he became one of the most influential people in the Dutch Province which led to his appointment to the Council of Nine to advise the New Amsterdam Governor [[Peter Stuyvesant]]. One of his greatest achievements was his celebrated map of [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] commissioned by Lord Baltimore on which he began working in earnest after removing to the English Province of [[Maryland]]. [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]] was so pleased with the map that he rewarded Herman with a large estate, named by Herman "[[Bohemia Manor]]", and the hereditary title [[Lord]].

There was another Bohemian living in New Amsterdam at that time, [[Frederick Philipse]] (1626–1720), who became equally famous. He was a successful merchant who, eventually, became the wealthiest person in the entire Dutch Province. Philipse was originally from [[Bohemia]], from an aristocratic [[Protestant]] family who had to leave their native land to save their lives, after the [[Thirty Years' War]].

The first significant wave of Czech colonists was of the [[Moravian Brethren]] who began arriving on the American shores in the first half of the 18th century. [[Moravian Brethren]] were the followers of the teachings of the Czech religious reformer and martyr [[Jan Hus]] (1370–1415), [[Petr Chelčický]] and Bishop [[John Amos Comenius]] (1592–1670). They were true heirs of the ancient "Unitas fratrum bohemicorum" - [[Unity of the Brethren]], who found a temporary refuge in [[Herrnhut]] ("Ochranov," in Czech language) in Lusatia under the patronage of Count [[Nikolaus Zinzendorf]] (1700–1760). Because of the worsening political and religious situation in [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], the Moravian Brethren, as they began calling themselves, decided to emigrate to North America.
[[File:Anton Cermak cph.3b27410.jpg|thumb|160px|Chicago's Czech-born mayor [[Anton Cermak]]]]

This group started coming in 1735, when they first settled in [[Savannah, Georgia]], and then in [[Pennsylvania]], from which they spread to other states after the [[American Revolution]], especially [[Ohio]]. The Moravians established a number of settlements, such as [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] and [[Lititz, Pennsylvania|Lititz]] in Pennsylvania and [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Salem]] in [[North Carolina]]. Moravians made great contributions to the growth and development of the US. Cultural contributions of Moravian Brethren from the Czech lands were distinctly notable in the realm of music. The trumpets and horns used by the Moravians in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] are the first evidence of Moravian instrumental music in America.

In 1776, at the time of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], more than two thousand [[Moravian Brethren]] lived in the colonies. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] designated special lands to the missionaries to civilize the Indians and promote Christianity. The free uncultivated land in America encouraged immigration throughout the nineteenth century; most of the immigrants were farmers and settled in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern states]].<ref name="The transition of a new world Bohemia">{{cite web |last1=Jerabek |first1=Esther |title=The transition of a new world Bohemia |url=http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/15/v15i01p026-042.pdf |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |accessdate=May 10, 2020}}</ref> The first major immigration of Czechs occurred in 1848 when the Czech "[[Forty-Eighters|Forty Eighters]]" fled to the United States to escape the political persecution by the [[Austrian Habsburgs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Bu-Dr/Czech-Americans.html#ixzz48nHsLh8X|author=Christine Molinari |title=Czech americans |publisher=Countries and Their Cultures}}</ref> During the [[American Civil War]], Czechs served in both the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] and Union army, but as with most immigrant groups, the majority fought for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. Immigration resumed and reached a peak in 1907, when 13,554 Czechs entered the eastern ports. Unlike previous immigration, new immigrants were predominantly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. Although some of the anticlericalism among Czechs in Europe did come to the United States, on the whole Czech Americans are much more likely to be practicing Catholics than Czechs in Europe. By 1910, the Czech population was 349,000, and by 1940 it was 1,764,000. The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Bureau of the Census]] reported that nearly 800,000 Czechs were residing in the U.S. in 1970. Since this figure did not include Czechs who had been living in the U.S. for several generations, it is reasonable to assume that the actual number was higher. Additionally, Czech immigrants in America at the time often had different claims of origin in records. Before 1918, many Czechs would be listed as from Bohemia or Moravia, or vaguely Austria or Silesia.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cermak|first=Anton|title=United States Census, 1900|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MS3H-Y16|website=FamilySearch}}</ref> Some were also counted as from Germany if they were German-speakers or rarely Polish if the recorder couldn't distinguish the language.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Horack|first=Gottlieb|title=United States Census, 1930|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XH85-ZWL|website=FamilySearch}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Svoboda|first=Peter|title=United States Census, 1930|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:X4QV-YKH|website=FamilySearch}}</ref> Slovaks were often listed as from Hungary.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bukva|first=Paul|title=United States Census, 1910|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M5ZX-F72|website=FamilySearch}}</ref> After the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, Czechs and Slovaks were also listed under this new blanket category.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cermak|first=Anton|title=United States Census, 1930|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XSGW-33T|website=FamilySearch}}</ref>

The Czech American community gained a high public profile in 1911, with the kidnapping and murder in Chicago of the five-year old [[Elsie Paroubek]] - when the Czech American community mobilized massively to help in the searches for the girl and support her family, and gained much sympathy from the general American public.
