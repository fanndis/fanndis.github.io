'''Brookline'''  {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ʊ|k|l|aɪ|n}} is a town in [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts]], in the [[United States]], and is a part of [[Greater Boston]]. Brookline borders six of [[Boston]]'s neighborhoods: [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], [[Allston]], [[Fenway–Kenmore]], [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]], [[Jamaica Plain]], and [[West Roxbury]]. The city of [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] lies to the west of Brookline.

At the 2010 census, the population of the town was 58,732. It is the most populous municipality in Massachusetts to have a [[New England town|town]] (rather than city) form of government.

Brookline was first settled in 1638 as a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in Boston; it was incorporated as a separate town in 1705.

Brookline was the birthplace and hometown of [[John F. Kennedy]], 35th [[President of the United States]].

==History==
[[File:Dorchester 1858.jpg|thumb|right|1858 map of north-central Norfolk County, showing Brookline (upper left) along with Dorchester, Roxbury and West Roxbury, all three of which were later annexed by Boston]]

Once part of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] territory, Brookline was first settled by [[White people|European]] colonists in the early 17th century. The area was an outlying part of the colonial settlement of Boston and known as the hamlet of Muddy River. In 1705, it was incorporated as the independent town of Brookline. The northern and southern borders of the town were marked by two small rivers or brooks, which is the town’s namesake. The northern border with Brighton (which was itself part of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] until 1807) was Smelt Brook. (That name appears on maps starting at least as early as 1852, but sometime between 1888 and 1925 the brook was covered over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/rzeledon/www/city/NaturalProcesses.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725072914/http://web.mit.edu/rzeledon/www/city/NaturalProcesses.html|url-status=dead|title=Packard's Corner: Once and Future City|archivedate=July 25, 2009}}</ref>) The southern boundary, abutting Boston, was the [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]].

The Town of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]] was merged with Boston in 1874, and the Boston-Brookline border was redrawn to connect the new Back Bay neighborhood with Allston-Brighton. This merger created a narrow strip of land along the [[Charles River]] belonging to Boston, cutting Brookline off from the shoreline. It also put certain lands north of the Muddy River on the Boston side, including what are now [[Kenmore Square]] and [[Packard's Corner]]. The current northern border follows Commonwealth Avenue, and on the northeast, St. Mary's Street. When [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] designed the [[Emerald Necklace]] of parks and parkways for Boston in the 1890s, the Muddy River was integrated into the [[Riverway]] and [[Olmsted Park]], creating parkland accessible by both Boston and Brookline residents.

Throughout its history, Brookline has resisted being annexed by Boston, in particular during the [[Boston–Brookline annexation debate of 1873]]. The neighboring towns of [[West Roxbury]] and [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]] connected Brookline to the rest of Norfolk County until they were annexed by Boston in 1874 and 1912, respectively, putting them in [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]. Brookline is now separated from the remainder of Norfolk County.

Brookline has long been regarded as a pleasant and verdant environment. In the 1841 edition of the ''Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening'', Andrew Jackson Downing described the area this way:
{{quote|The whole of this neighborhood of Brookline is a kind of landscape garden, and there is nothing in America of the sort, so inexpressibly charming as the lanes which lead from one cottage, or villa, to another. No animals are allowed to run at large, and the open gates, with tempting vistas and glimpses under the pendent boughs, give it quite an Arcadian air of rural freedom and enjoyment. These lanes are clothed with a profusion of trees and wild shrubbery, often almost to the carriage tracks, and curve and wind about, in a manner quite bewildering to the stranger who attempts to thread them alone; and there are more hints here for the lover of the picturesque in lanes than we ever saw assembled together in so small a compass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/bonsai/beginnings.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202082944/http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/bonsai/beginnings.html|url-status=dead|title=Arnold Arboretum Website|archivedate=February 2, 2007}}</ref>}}

Brookline residents were among the first in the country to propose extending the vote to women. [[Benjamin F. Butler]], in his 1882 campaign for Governor, advocated the idea.<ref>John Gould Curtis, History of the Town of Brookline Massachusetts, Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston and New York, 1933, pg.305</ref> However, in 1843, the City of Brookline [[Covenant (law)|legally banned resales of deeds]] to "any [[Housing discrimination in the United States|negro]] or [[Anti-Irish sentiment#"No Irish need apply"|native of Ireland]]."<ref>{{cite book|last=Rothstein|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Rothstein|title=The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America|title-link=The Color of Law|year=2017|place=New York|publisher=[[Boni & Liveright|Liveright Publishing Corporation]]|page=78|isbn=978-1631494536}}</ref><ref>{{cite document|last=Santucci|first=Larry|title=How Prevalent Were Racially Restrictive Covenants in 20th Century Philadelphia?

===Transportation history===
Two branches of upper [[Boston Post Road]], established in the 1670s, passed through Brookline. Brookline Village was the original center of retail activity.<ref>[http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/Planning/brooklinevillage.html Brookline Village] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008104829/http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/Planning/brooklinevillage.html |date=October 8, 2007 }}</ref> In 1810, the Boston and Worcester Turnpike, now [[Massachusetts Route 9]], was laid out, starting on [[Huntington Avenue]] in Boston and passing through the village center on its way west.

Steam railroads came to Brookline in the middle of the 19th century. The [[Boston and Worcester Railroad]] was constructed in the early 1830s, and passed through Brookline near the Charles River. The rail line is still in active use, now paralleled by the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. The Highland Branch of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] was built from Kenmore Square to Brookline Village in 1847, and was extended into Newton in 1852. In the late 1950s, this would become the [[Green Line D branch]].

The portion of Beacon Street west of Kenmore Square was laid out in 1850.  [[Streetcar]] tracks were laid above ground on Beacon Street in 1888, from [[Coolidge Corner]] to [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in Boston, via Kenmore Square.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org/history/presComm/beaconSt.asp|title=History of Beacon St.|website=www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  In 1889, they were electrified and extended over the Brighton border at [[Cleveland Circle]]. They would eventually become the [[Green Line C branch]].

Thanks to the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] system, this upgrade from [[horse-drawn carriage]] to electric trolleys occurred on many major streets all over the region, and made transportation into downtown Boston faster and cheaper. Much of Brookline was developed into a [[streetcar suburb]], with large brick apartment buildings sprouting up along the new streetcar lines.

===Etymology===
Brookline was known as the hamlet of '''Muddy River''' and was considered part of Boston until the Town of Brookline was independently incorporated in 1705.  (The [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]] was used as the Brookline–Boston border at incorporation.) It is said that the name derives from a farm therein once owned by Judge [[Samuel Sewall]].<ref>{{cite book

| quote = The name of Brookline came, as the late Rev. Samuel Sewall (great grandson of Judge Samuel Sewall) conjectures, from one of the farms within its bounds, namely the Gates' farm, hired of Judge Sewall, which was probably called Brookline because Smelt-brook, running through it, formed the line between that and one of the neighboring farms, and this brook also separated that farm from Cambridge.  Judge Sewall, in his journal, often mentions the name "Brookline" before the town was incorporated.  Rev. Mr. S. also thinks it was Judge Sewall that suggested that name for the town.}}</ref> Originally the property of  CPT [[John Hull (merchant)|John Hull]] and Judith Quincy Hull. Judge Sewall came into possession of this tract, which embraced more than 350 acres, through Hannah Quincy Hull (Sewall) who was the Hull's only daughter. John Hull in his youth lived in Muddy River Hamlet, in a little house which stood near the Sears Memorial Church. Hull removed to Boston, where he amassed a large fortune for those days. Judge Sewall probably never lived on his Brookline estate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org/history/proceedings/1903/1903_Sewall.html|title=1903 Proceedings of the Brookline Historical Society|website=www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org}}</ref>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Brookline has a total area of {{convert|17.7|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, all but {{convert|0.1|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} (0.44%) of which is land.

The northern part of Brookline, roughly north of the D-line tracks, is urban in character, as highly walkable and transit rich. The population density of this northern part of town is nearly {{convert|20,000|PD/sqmi|-3}}, similar to the densest neighborhoods in nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], Massachusetts (the densest cities in New England), and slightly lower than that of central Boston's residential districts (Back Bay, South End, Fenway, etc.).  The overall density of Brookline, which also includes suburban districts and grand estates south of the D-line, is still higher than that of many of the largest cities in the United States, especially in the South and West.  Brookline borders [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] (part of [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]]) to the west and [[Boston]] (part of [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]) in all other directions; it is therefore non-contiguous with any other part of Norfolk County.  Brookline became an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] of Norfolk County in 1873, when the neighboring town of [[West Roxbury]] was annexed by Boston (and left Norfolk County to join [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]). Brookline refused to be annexed by Boston after the [[Boston–Brookline annexation debate of 1873]].

Brookline separates the bulk of the city of Boston (except for a narrow neck or corridor near the [[Charles River]]) from its westernmost neighborhoods of [[Allston–Brighton]], which had been the separate town of Brighton until annexed by Boston in 1873.
