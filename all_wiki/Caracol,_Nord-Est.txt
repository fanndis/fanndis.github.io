In 2012 the Caracol Industrial Park was built on a square mile, 600 acre, 252 hectare site near Caracol. The $300 million project, which was to include a 10-megawatt power plant, road, a water-treatment plant, worker housing in neighboring communities, and development of a port in nearby [[Fort-Liberté#Fort-Libert.C3.A9 Bay|Fort-Liberté]], was built with hurricane relief funds, a loan from the [[Inter-American Development Bank]],<ref name=IDB112811>{{cite web|title=Haiti and its partners lay the foundation stone for the Caracol Industrial Park|url=http://www.iadb.org/en/news/news-releases/2011-11-28/caracol-industrial-park-in-haiti,9724.html|publisher=Inter-American Development Bank|accessdate=July 6, 2012|format=Press release|date=November 28, 2011}}</ref> contributions by the United States government, and the [[Clinton Foundation]].<ref name="KQ_Haiti">{{cite web|last1=Katz|first1=Jonathan|title=The King and Queen of Haiti|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/05/clinton-foundation-haiti-117368|website=Politico|accessdate=September 21, 2016|date=May 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Jonathan|title=The Big Truck That Went By: How the World Came to Save Haiti and Left Behind a Disaster|date=2013|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-230-34187-6}}</ref>  As of 2013, 1.7 of the projected 10 megawatts were being supplied by the power plant.<ref name="GenderAction">{{cite web|url=http://www.genderaction.org/publications/caracol.pdf|title=Caracol Industrial Park Social and Gender Impacts of Year One of Haiti's newest IFI - funded Industrial Park|author1=Claire Lauterbach|author2=Elaine Zuckerman|date=2013|website=GenderAction|publisher=Gender Action|pages=18, 35|accessdate=November 13, 2018}}</ref>

In April 2019, 13,000 people were employed at the Caracol industrial Park. At this time, S&H Global decided not to expand their production capacity in Haiti as they had planned.  According to ''Haïti Libre'', beyond management and security problems, this was most likely due to a [[Chamber of Deputies (Haiti)|lower house]] vote approving a 78.5% increase in the Haitian minimum wage for workers in the sector. At the same time, the Interamerican Development Bank decided to withdraw a $31 million pledge made in 2015 for expansion of the site.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Haïti Libre|date=2 April 2019|title=Les coréens à Caracol, transfert leurs projets d'extension en RD|language=fr|url=https://www.haitilibre.com/article-27347-haiti-flash-les-coreens-a-caracol-transfert-leurs-projets-d-extension-en-rd.html}}</ref>

Under a recently enacted law, the minimum wage should now be roughly $6.85 a day for garment work. But factory owners have simply refused to pay the higher wages.

Sae-A declined to comment on particulars, stating only that its employees "are compensated in accordance with local laws and regulations."}}</ref>

== Communal Sections ==
The commune consists of two [[communal section]]s, namely:
