'''Target Corporation''' is an American [[retail]] corporation. It is the 8th-largest retailer in the United States, and is a component of the [[S&P 500 Index]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://stores.org/stores-top-retailers-2017/|title=STORES Top Retailers 2017 - STORES: NRF's Magazine|work=STORES: NRF's Magazine|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en-US}}</ref>

Target established itself as the discount division of the Dayton's Company of Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1962; it began expanding the store nationwide in the 1980s (as part of the Dayton-Hudson Corporation) and introduced new store formats under the Target brand in the 1990s. The company has found success as a cheap-chic player in the industry.<ref name=":1">{{cite news|last=Tuttle|first=Brad|title=Why Target Is Focusing on Millennials and Cities Instead of Suburban Moms|website=MONEY|url=http://time.com/money/4519688/target-small-stores-millennials-cities-college-towns/|url-status=dead|access-date=October 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005165019/http://time.com/money/4519688/target-small-stores-millennials-cities-college-towns/|archive-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref> The parent company was renamed the Target Corporation in 2000 and divested itself of its last department store chains in 2004. It suffered from a massive and [[History of Target Corporation#2013 security breach|highly publicized security breach of customer credit card data]] and the failure of its short-lived [[Target Canada]] subsidiary in the early 2010s but experienced revitalized success with its expansion in urban markets within the United States. As of 2019, Target operated 1,844 stores throughout the United States.<ref name=10KFEB32018/> The company is ranked No. 37 on 2020 [[Fortune 500]] list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/|title=Fortune 500 Companies 2018: Who Made the List|website=Fortune|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-10}}</ref> Their retail formats include the [[discount store]] Target, the hypermarket SuperTarget, and "small-format" stores previously named CityTarget and TargetExpress before being consolidated under the Target branding.

Target introduced the "PFresh" store prototype in 2006, which expanded its grocery selection in general merchandise locations by an upwards of 200-percent. Newly constructed stores that follow the PFresh format are roughly {{convert|1500|sqft}} larger than properties without groceries, although retain the Target branding because their offerings are considerably more limited than SuperTarget. PFresh sells perishable and frozen foods, baked goods, meat, and dairy. The company remodeled 109 stores accordingly in 2006 and renovated another 350 stores the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/2009/11/16/daily32.html|title=Target to add the 'PFresh' (now referred to as 'Market') grocery concept at 350 stores|newspaper=Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal|publisher=American City Business Journals|date=November 18, 2006|access-date=March 10, 2016}}</ref> The company's decision to close their garden centers opened floor space for PFresh expansion and larger seasonal departments beginning in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consumerist.com/2010/08/13/target-closing-all-remaining-garden-centers/|title=Target Closing All Remaining Garden Centers|last=Morran|first=Chris|publisher=Consumerist|date=August 13, 2010|access-date=March 10, 2016}}</ref>

On June 15, 2015, [[CVS Health]] announced an agreement with Target to acquire all of Target's pharmacies and clinic businesses for around $1.9 billion. The Target pharmacies were rebranded as CVS Health pharmacies which totaled 1,672 pharmacies. The Target clinics were also rebranded as MinuteClinic. The acquisition of the Target pharmacies enabled CVS to expand its market into Seattle, Denver, Portland, and Salt Lake City. The Target pharmacies were rebranded to CVS Health pharmacies in February 2016.<ref>{{cite news |title=CVS Health and Target Announce Completed Acquisition of Target's Pharmacy and Clinic Businesses |url=https://cvshealth.com/newsroom/press-releases/cvs-health-and-target-announce-completed-acquisition-targets-pharmacy-and |date=December 16, 2015}}</ref><ref name=bi-2016feb03>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/target-and-cvs-pharmacy-is-bad-news-2016-2 |title=Target opening CVS pharmacies in stores is scary news for consumers |website=[[Business Insider]] |date=February 3, 2016 |first=Kate |last=Taylor}}</ref>

===SuperTarget===
[[File:SuperTarget .jpg|200px|thumb|The exterior of a SuperTarget in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], in October 2005]]
The first '''Target Greatland''' location opened in [[Apple Valley, Minnesota]] in September 1990. They were about fifty-percent larger than traditional Target stores, and pioneered company standards including an increased number of checkout lanes and price scanners, larger aisles, expanded pharmacy and photography departments, and a food court. Target Greatland locations have since been converted to stores following the PFresh format beginning in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/print-edition/2011/01/07/Target-to-roll-out-PFresh-concept.html|title=Target to roll out 'PFresh' concept store at Belmar center in Lakewood|last=Moore|first=Paula|newspaper=Denver Business Journal|publisher=American City Business Journals|date=January 7, 2011|access-date=March 10, 2016}}</ref>

The first '''Super Target''' [[hypermarket]] opened in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] in 1995, and expanded upon the Target Greatland concept with the inclusion of a full grocery department.<ref name="TargetThroughTheYears"/> The company expanded their grocery assortment in 2003 and adopted the modified tagline "Eat Well.

When comparing itself with rival Walmart Supercenter hypermarkets, then-chief executive Gregg Steinhafel opined that [[Walmart]] operates like "a grocer that happens to also sell general merchandise," where in contrast its less aggressive expansion of SuperTarget stores is indicative of their position that the grocery industry as a "high-impact, low-cost" side project.<ref name="ReboundRecipe"/> The company operated 239 SuperTarget locations as of September 2015;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/target-company-statistics/|title=Target Corporation Company Statistics|publisher=Statistic Brain Research Institute|date=September 3, 2015|access-date=March 10, 2016}}</ref> they each encompass an estimate of {{convert|174000|sqft}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/17/business/target-is-testing-a-small-store-for-city-shoppers.html|title=Target Tests Small Store for Urban Shoppers as Young People Pick Cities Over Suburbs|last=Harris|first=Elizabeth|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 16, 2014|access-date=March 10, 2016}}</ref>

In August 2015, Target made the announcement of "Big or small, our stores have one thing in common: they're all Target."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://corporate.target.com/article/2015/08/rebranding-citytarget-targetexpress-stores-flexibl|title=Keeping Things Simple: Rebranding our CityTarget and TargetExpress Stores|date=August 4, 2015|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> Since then newer stores have opened under the Target name. Existing SuperTarget stores retained the name on the buildings although some have become Target through remodels.

Nearly all of its planned openings through 2019 are small formats, which is less than 50,000 square feet.<ref name=":1" /> The goal of these smaller format stores is to win over the business of millennial customers.

===Financial and Retail Services===
Financial and Retail Services (FRS), formerly Target Financial Services (TFS), issues Target's credit cards, known as the Target REDcard (formerly the Target Guest Card), issued through Target National Bank (formerly Retailers National Bank) for consumers and through Target Bank for businesses. Target Financial Services also oversees GiftCard balances. Target launched its [[personal identification number|PIN]]-x debit card, the Target Check Card, which was later re-branded the Target Debit Card. The Target Debit Card withdraws funds from the customer's existing checking account, and allows for up to $40 "cash back". The debit card allows guests to save five percent off each purchase. In late 2017, Target replaced its REDcard slogan "Save 5% Today, Tomorrow, & Everyday with Target REDcard" when it rolled out new benefits for REDcard holders by offering exclusive products on Target.com and preorders with "Everyday Savings. Exclusive Extras."<ref>{{cite web |title=Target's REDcard: What You Need to Know (TGT) |url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/target-red-card-what-you-need-know-tgt.asp |website=investopedia.com}}</ref>

Target.com owns and oversees the company's [[e-commerce]] initiatives, such as the Target.com domain. Founded in early 2000 as target.direct, it was formed by separating the company's existing e-commerce operations from its retailing division and combining it with its Rivertown Trading direct marketing unit into a stand-alone subsidiary.<ref name=namechange>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_4_39/ai_59649452 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312083618/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_4_39/ai_59649452 |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 12, 2007 |title=Target is the name |work=Discount Store News |date=February 21, 2000 }}</ref> In 2002, target.direct and [[Amazon.com]]'s subsidiary Amazon Enterprise Solutions created a partnership in which Amazon.com would provide order fulfillment and guest services for Target.com in exchange for fixed and variable fees. After the company sold [[Marshall Field's]] and [[Mervyn's]] in 2004, target.direct became Target.com.

==Supply chain==
[[Image:Targetsemitruck.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Truck arriving at a Target distribution center.]]
{{As of|2016|5}}, Target Corporation operates 41 distribution centers across the United States.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://corporate.target.com/press/corporate |title=Target Corporate Fact Sheet |publisher=corporate.target.com |access-date=May 31, 2016}}</ref> With the exception of vendor supplied items, such as greeting cards and soda, these distribution centers ship items directly to Target stores. Also, unlike [[Walmart]], Target's grocery selection does not come from their own distribution centers, but from the companies with whom Target has partnered.<ref name=rowley>{{cite book |last=Rowley |first=Laura |year=2003 |title=On Target: How the World's Hottest Retailer Hit a Bull's-eye |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |isbn=0-471-25067-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ontarget00laur }}</ref>

The retail chain's first distribution center opened in [[Fridley, Minnesota]], in 1969. It included a computerized distribution system and was known as the Northern Distribution Center. During this time, the chain consisted of seventeen stores after having expanded into [[Oklahoma]] and Texas.<ref name=growth>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050528105558/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n18_v29/ai_8970766 From Roseville to Greatland, Target still hits the mark], ''Discount Store News'', September 17, 1990.</ref>

On August 9, 2004, Target announced to their suppliers that they were going to perform a trial on the effects of [[radio-frequency identification]] on the efficiency of [[supply chain management]] in the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]]. This trial involved one Target distribution center and ten nearby Target stores. Here, RFID tags were placed on the bar codes of pallets and cartons to track the goods from the suppliers to the distribution center, and from the distribution center to the stores.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=26806887| title=Target Meets With Suppliers About RFID Plans |magazine= InformationWeek| date=August 10, 2004}}</ref> As of 2009, RFID had been phased out of the Dallas–Fort Worth stores. In 2016, Target planned to roll out the RFID technology at all 1,795 of its store locations across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Target Announces Nationwide RFID Rollout {{!}} RFID JOURNAL|url=https://www.rfidjournal.com/target-announces-nationwide-rfid-rollout|access-date=2020-07-14|website=www.rfidjournal.com}}</ref>

Target opened three new distribution centers in 2006 ([[Rialto, California]], [[DeKalb, Illinois]]) and one in 2009 ([[Newton, North Carolina]]) to support the growth of its stores. On January 27, 2009, Target announced the closing of its distribution center in [[Maumelle, Arkansas]], the second-oldest in the company. The reason cited was the need to ensure that Target remains competitive in the long-term.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://investors.target.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=65828&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1248941&highlight=| title=Target announces workforce reduction| date=January 29, 2009}}</ref> In June 2009 Target opened a new distribution center to supply more than 60 stores in three states.<ref>{{cite news |title=Target distribution center opens in Newton |url=https://www.wbtv.com/story/10885305/target-distribution-center-opens-in-newton/ |publisher=WBTV |date=August 11, 2009}}</ref>

SuperTarget and PFresh stores require fresh produce, refrigerated and frozen items. Food distribution centers owned by [[SuperValu (United States)|SuperValu]] have been utilized by Target for many years. In October 2003, SuperValu's facility in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], was converted to serve Target exclusively.<ref name=RT>{{cite web| url=http://refrigeratedtrans.com/news/Target-planning-FL-food-distribution-center/| publisher=Refrigerated Transporter| date= February 1, 2007| title=Target aims for FL food distribution center}}</ref> The same change was implemented at the SuperValu center in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].<ref name=TARGET>{{cite web| url= http://pressroom.target.com/pr/news/target-stores/target-distribution-centers.aspx| title=Target Stores, Target Distribution Centers| publisher=Target}}</ref> A new distribution center was constructed by Target in [[Lake City, Florida]], to serve the Southeast, but it was operated by SuperValu until 2011 when it transitioned to Target.<ref name=RT/> A fourth center in [[Cedar Falls, Iowa]], opened in 2009 and is unique in that it is located adjacent to a standard Target Distribution Center, each utilizing the same dispatch office.<ref name=TARGET/> Other warehouses owned by SuperValu are still used in other regions, but Target plans to replace those over the next few years.<ref name=RT/> In Colorado, stores are serviced through ''FreshPack Produce Inc.'' of [[Denver]].<ref name=rowley/> In the [[mid-Atlantic region]]/[[Philadelphia]] market, [[C&S Wholesale Grocers]] services the fresh produce, meat, dairy, bakery, & frozen needs to "PFresh" stores. Target partnered with [[Swisslog Holding]] to use a semi-automated monorail picking system called the CaddyPick system for use in the food distribution centers.

The company operates four facilities to receive shipments from overseas manufacturers and suppliers. They are located near ports at [[Rialto, California]]; [[Savannah, Georgia]]; [[Lacey, Washington]]; and [[Suffolk, Virginia]]. Merchandise received is sent directly to Regional Distribution Centers. Internet sales orders from the Target Direct division, which operates from the Target.com website, are processed by the facility in [[Woodbury, Minnesota]], with some support from [[Savannah, Georgia]], and other vendors. New centers opened in [[Ontario, California]], and [[Tucson, Arizona]], in 2009.<ref name=TARGET />

August 24, 2009, the United States [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) filed a discrimination lawsuit against Target Corporation for unlawfully denying reasonable accommodation to an employee with multiple disability-based impairments and substantially reducing his work hours due to the medical conditions.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/business&id=6981568| title=EEOC Sues Target For Disability Discrimination| publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]| date=August 25, 2009| access-date=January 1, 2013}}</ref> According to the claims in the EEOC press release, Target's actions violated Title I of the [[Americans With Disabilities Act]] (ADA) and Title I of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.eeoc.gov/press/8-24-09.html| title=Target Stores Sued For Disability Discrimination| publisher=Equal Opportunity Employment Commission | access-date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>

===Philanthropy===
Target is consistently ranked as one of the most [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] companies in the US. It ranked No. 22 in ''Fortune'' magazine's "World's Most Admired Companies" for 2010, largely in part to the donation efforts of the company as a whole.<ref>{{cite news| title=World's Most Admired Companies| url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/mostadmired/2010/full_list/| access-date=December 5, 2010 |publisher=CNN}}</ref> According to a November 2005 ''[[Forbes]]'' article, it ranked as the highest cash-giving company in America in percentage of income given (2.1%).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060515230306/http://www.forbes.com/business/2005/11/11/charities-corporations-giving-cx_lm_1114charity.html The Most Charitable Companies], ''Forbes'', November 14, 2005.</ref> Target donates around 5 percent of its pre-tax operating profit; it gives over $3&nbsp;million a week (up from $2&nbsp;million in years prior) to the communities in which it operates. It also gives a percentage of charges from its Target Visa to schools designated by the cardholders. To date, Target has given over $150&nbsp;million to schools across the United States through this program.

Further evidence of Target's philanthropy can be found in the Target House complex in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], a long-term housing solution for families of patients at the city's [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]]. The corporation led the way with more than $27&nbsp;million in donations, which made available 96 fully furnished apartments for families needing to stay at St. Jude over 90 days.

Target has a no-solicitation rule at its properties, as it seeks to provide a "distraction-free shopping experience for its guests." Exemptions to this policy were previously made for the [[Salvation Army]] red kettles and bell-ringers outside Target stores during the holidays through Christmas. In 2004, however, Target asked the organization to explore alternate methods to partner with Target. Target donates to local Salvation Army chapters through its grant program and annually to the [[United Way of America]] (the Salvation Army is a member of the United Way coalition).

In 2005, Target and the Salvation Army<ref>[http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn%5Cwww_usn.nsf/vw-news/A2C8D799DEE5BE74802570B90052D6C7?opendocument Target and The Salvation Army Announce Partnership] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222085916/http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_usn.nsf/vw-news/A2C8D799DEE5BE74802570B90052D6C7?opendocument |date=February 22, 2006 }}, The Salvation Army, November 14, 2005.</ref> created a joint effort called "The Target/Salvation Army Wish List", where online shoppers could donate goods to the organization for hurricane victims by buying them directly from Target.com between November 25, 2005, and January 25, 2006.

During the Thanksgiving holiday of 2006, Target and the Salvation Army partnered with magician [[David Blaine]] to send several families on a shopping spree the morning of [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]. The challenge held that if Blaine could successfully work his way out of a spinning gyroscope by the morning of Black Friday, then several families would receive $500 shopping certificates. The challenge was completed successfully by Blaine.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,231713,00.html Magician David Blaine Ends Latest Stunt by Escaping From Gyroscope in NYC], FOXNews.com, November 24, 2006.</ref>

During disasters, Target has been a major benefactor for relief efforts. Target provided monetary and product donations during the [[September 11 attacks]]; it also donated money for relief efforts for the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]] in South Asia and donated $1.5&nbsp;million (US) to the [[American Red Cross]] in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. It also allowed its store properties in the affected area to be used as command centers for relief organizations and donated supplies such as water and bug spray.

Target will often donate its unused, returned or seasonal merchandise (particularly clothing) to [[Goodwill Industries]].

===Environmental record===
In 2007, Target Corporation agreed to reduce its sales on all materials containing [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC).<ref name="newswire1">{{cite news| url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/nov2007/2007-11-12-092.asp| publisher=Environment News Service| date= November 12, 2007| access-date=May 4, 2008| title = Target Stores to Phase Out Vinyl Plastic Products}}</ref> Testers found toxic lead and [[phthalate]]s and large amounts of PVC in toys, lunch boxes, baby bibs, jewelry, garden hoses, mini blinds, Christmas trees, and electronics.<ref name="newswire1"/> Several studies have shown that chemicals in vinyl chloride can cause serious health problems for children and adults.<ref name="newswire1"/> The [[University of Illinois Medical Center]] in Chicago states that people who use products containing PVC can become exposed with harmful toxic phthalates and lead, which eventually can become a big contributor with [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]].<ref name="newswire1"/> Lois Gibbs, executive director of the Center for Health, Environment, and Justice, stated, "Target is doing the right thing by moving away from PVC and switching to safer alternatives."<ref name="newswire1"/> Other companies reducing the PVC on their shelves include Walmart, [[Microsoft]], [[Johnson & Johnson]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and Apple.<ref name="newswire1"/> Target stores have been taking environmental measures by reusing materials within their stores and recycling products such as broken hangers, cardboard, and rechargeable batteries.<ref>[http://sites.target.com/site/en/corporate/page.jsp?contentId=PRD03-001095 Target Corporation 2006 Awards.

Target released a 13-page report in 2007 that outlined their current and future plans for becoming more earth-friendly according to [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]. Such efforts include installing sand filtration systems for the stores' wastewater. Recycling programs will be aimed at garment hangers, corrugated cardboard, electronics, shopping carts, shrink wrap, construction wastes, carpeting, and ceiling tiles and roofing materials. All stores in [[Oklahoma]] will be partnered with [[Oklahoma Gas & Electric]] to exclusively use [[wind power]] for all Target stores in order to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Stores nationwide use only [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] and [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lights]] and low-flow restrooms that reduce wastewater by 30%. Some Target stores are installing roof gardens or [[green roof]]s, which absorb stormwater and cut down on [[surface runoff]], mitigate temperature fluctuations and provide habitats for birds. There are currently four green-roof Target stores in [[Chicago]].

Target carries over 700 organic and alternative products from brands such as [[Archer Farms]], [[Burt's Bees]], and [[Method Products]]. They also sell clothes made from organic cotton, non-toxic cleaners, low-energy lighting and electronics, non-toxic and non-animal tested cosmetics, and furniture made from recycled materials. {{As of|2007|6}}, Target has been offering [[reusable shopping bag]]s as an alternative to disposable plastic bags. Target gift cards are made from corn-based resins. All of the stores' packaging is done with a modified paperboard/clamshell option and has goals for phasing out [[plastic wrap]] completely.<ref>Target Corporation.

Target is the only national retailer employing a Garment Hanger reuse program, which keeps millions of pounds of metal and plastic out of [[landfill]]s. In 2007, this program prevented 434 million hangers from entering landfills.

On June 15, 2009, the California Attorney General and 20 California District Attorneys filed a lawsuit in [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] alleging that Target stores across the state have been illegally dumping [[hazardous waste]]s in landfills.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://pressbanner.com/pages/full_story?page_label=opinion_letters&id=2806048-Attorney+general+targets+Target&article-Attorney%20general%20targets%20Target%20=&widget=push&instance=opinion_letters&open |title=Attorney general targets Target |work=Press-Banner |location=Scotts Valley, Calif. |date=June 26, 2009 |access-date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>

On October 1, 2009, Target Corporation agreed to pay a $600,000 civil penalty for importing and selling a variety of toys with [[lead paint]] levels that were higher than is legally allowed. The [[Consumer Products Safety Commission]] alleged that "Target knowingly imported and sold the illegal Chinese-made toys between May 2006 and August 2007."<ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/business/consumer/articles/2009/10/01/20091001targetlead.html Target penalized for toys with lead paint], ''AZ Central''.

A [[class action]] suit was filed in 2014 in the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio]], on behalf of consumers in Ohio that purchased Target-brand [[wet wipes]]. The lawsuit filed against Target Corporation alleges the retailer misled consumers by marking the packaging on its up & up® brand wipes as flushable and safe for sewer and septic systems. The lawsuit also alleges that so-called flushable wipes are a public health hazard because they are alleged to clog pumps at municipal waste-treatment facilities.<ref>{{cite magazine |author1=Lorenzo B.

===Differentiation from competitors===
Since its founding, it has intended to differentiate its stores from its competitors by offering what it believes is more upscale, trend-forward merchandise at lower costs, rather than the traditional concept of focusing on low-priced goods. Douglas J. Dayton, one of the Dayton brothers, explained John Geisse's concept:
{{cquote|"We will offer high-quality merchandise at low margins because we are cutting expenses. We would much rather do this than trumpet dramatic price cuts on cheap merchandise."<ref name=growth/>}}

As a result, Target stores tend to attract younger customers than Walmart, among other competitors. The [[median]] Target shopper is 40, the youngest of all major discount retailers that Target competes directly against. The median household income of Target's customer base is roughly $64,000. Roughly 76% of Target customers are female, and more than 43% have children at home. About 80% have attended college and 57% have completed college.<ref name=community>{{cite web|url=http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/grad/html/gfinfo.html |title=Community of Grand Forks |access-date=June 11, 2007 |publisher=University of North Dakota |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219205819/http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/grad/html/gfinfo.html |archive-date=December 19, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=factcard>{{cite web| url=http://sites.target.com/images/corporate/about/pdfs/corp_factcard_101107.pdf| title=Corporate Fact Card| publisher=Target Corporation| date=October 10, 2007| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128161431/http://sites.target.com/images/corporate/about/pdfs/corp_factcard_101107.pdf| archive-date=November 28, 2007| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In October 2008, Target announced plans to fight the perception that their products are more expensive than those of other discount retailers. It added perishables to their inventory, cut back on discretionary items, and spent three-quarters of their marketing budget on advertising that emphasizes value and includes actual prices of items featured in ads. Target also planned to slow its expansion from about 100 stores a year down to 70 stores a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/10/24/value-for-money-is-back--target-does-marketing-right.aspx |date=October 23, 2008 |title=Value For Money Is Back – Target Does Marketing Right |publisher=Marketing Doctor Blog |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112221355/http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/10/24/value-for-money-is-back--target-does-marketing-right.aspx |archive-date=January 12, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/target-intensify-value-message-vend/story.aspx?guid={3530B21A-2435-466C-A282-42594139AE9F}| date=October 23, 2008| title=Target to emphasize value, add perishables| publisher=Market Watch}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewarticle+articleid_2802564.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104032318/http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewarticle+articleid_2802564.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=January 4, 2013| date=November 15, 2008| title=Earnings Preview – Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)| publisher=iStockAnalyst}}</ref>

Target stores are designed to be more attractive than large [[big-box store]]s by having wider aisles, drop ceilings, a more attractive presentation of merchandise, and generally cleaner fixtures. Special attention is given to the design of the store environment: graphics reinforce its advertising imagery, while shelves are dressed with contemporary signage, backdrops, and liners, often printed on inexpensive material such as paper, corrugated and foam boards. Some stores, particularly those in the vicinity of major airports, have a [[bullseye (target)|bullseye]] painted on the roof that can be seen from above: the stores in [[East Point, Georgia]] near [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]]; [[Rosemont, Illinois]], near [[O'Hare International Airport]]; [[Potomac Yard|Potomac Yard, Virginia]], near [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]]; [[College Point, New York]] (Queens), east of [[LaGuardia Airport]]; and [[Richfield, Minnesota]], adjacent to [[Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport]] are among such locations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Target+loc:+Rosemont,+Illinois&ie=UTF8&z=18&ll=42.006903,-87.887095&spn=0.00287,0.006748&t=k&om=1 |title= Target on rooftop in Rosemont, IL |publisher=Google Maps |access-date=April 24, 2017}}</ref>

Target stores do not sell [[firearm]]s. In the early 1990s, they ceased sales of [[toy gun]]s that looked realistic and limited its toy gun selection to ones that were brightly colored and oddly shaped. In 2014, Target also "respectfully" asked their guests to leave any firearms at home when visiting the store.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/07/06/target-no-guns-request-your-say/12274409/| title=Cheers, grumbles for Target no guns request | newspaper=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> They do not sell tobacco products and have not sold cigarettes since 1996.<ref name="responsibility report">[http://sites.target.com/images/corporate/about/pdfs/corp_responsibility_report_0406.pdf Corporate Responsibility Report (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716093402/http://sites.target.com/images/corporate/about/pdfs/corp_responsibility_report_0406.pdf |date=July 16, 2006 }}, Target Corporation, January 31, 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://corporate.target.com/press/corporate|title=corporate}}</ref>

===Nomenclature===
Target uses a practice that was derived in 1989 from [[The Walt Disney Company]]<ref name=rowley/> by calling its customers "Guests," its employees "Team Members," and its supervisors "Team Leaders." Also, managers are known as "Executive Team Leaders (ETLs)," "Senior Team Leaders (SRTLs)," or "Guest Service Team Leaders (GSTLs)," and the Store Manager is known as the "Store Team Leader (STL)," Further up the "chain of command" are "District Team Leaders (DTL)," "Group Team Leaders (GTL, sometimes also Group Vice President)," "Regional Team Leaders (RTL, sometimes also Regional Vice President)," and corporate-level executives.

This practice began to be revised in 2018 and became more widespread in 2019 as the Group Team Leader became the Group Operations Director. District Team Leader became the District Senior Director. The Store Team Leader became Store Director. Executive Team Leaders were shortened to Executive Team Lead. Other Team Leaders retained their title though some of the department names changed such as Guest Service Team Leader was renamed Service & Engagement Team Leader. Front of store team members was renamed Guest Advocates. Specialty areas in Style, Beauty and Tech are considered Consultants. Other areas such as General Merchandise, Presentation, Inbound, Fulfillment, Food Service and Reverse Logistics are considered Experts.

===Product lines and partnerships===
Target has many exclusive deals with various designers and name brands, including Finnish design company [[Marimekko]]; architect [[Michael Graves]]; athletic wear company [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]; Portland-based undergarment designer [[Pair of Thieves]]; Italian fashion label [[Fiorucci]]; fashion designers [[Lilly Pulitzer]], [[Liz Lange]], [[Mossimo|Mossimo Giannulli]], and [[Isaac Mizrahi]], among others.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Xie|first=Jenny|date=2019-09-09|title=Our wishlist for Target's 20th Anniversary Collection of designer collabs|url=https://www.curbed.com/2019/9/9/20851105/target-20th-anniversary-collection-designers-home-goods|access-date=2020-07-31|website=Curbed|language=en}}</ref> To further increase its fashion profile, Target also created its fashion-forward [[Go International]] line, which hires famous designers to design collections available only for a few months.<ref name=michael_graves>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_1999_Feb_8/ai_53904958 Is Target making a Graves mistake?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312085505/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_1999_Feb_8/ai_53904958 |date=March 12, 2007 }}, ''Discount Store News'', February 8, 1999.</ref>

After hiring architect Michael Graves to design the scaffolding used to renovate the [[Washington Monument]] and contributing US$6&nbsp;million to the restoration plan, Target introduced its first designer line of products in 1999, the Michael Graves Collection of housewares and home decor products.<ref name="michael_graves"/> [[Walmart]] and [[Kmart]] have followed Target's lead by signing exclusive designers to their stores as well.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-03-19|title=Walmart, Target, Kmart, Kohl's Lead 50 Years of Retail Revolution|url=https://adage.com/article/news/walmart-target-kmart-kohl-s-lead-retail-revolution/233379|access-date=2020-07-31|website=adage.com|language=en}}</ref> Target also partners with well-established national brands to create exclusive collections for its stores.<ref name="michael_graves"/>

Target also signed an exclusive deal with [[Food Network]] to sell VHS tapes of TV shows featuring popular chefs such as [[Alton Brown]], [[Paula Deen]], and [[Rachael Ray]].{{when|date=October 2014}}{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 2005, Target introduced a major revision of [[prescription drug|prescription]] bottles, which it calls the [[ClearRx]] system. The redesigned bottles are color-coded, flattened-out and turned upside down, providing more room for the label. This system was based on the patent<ref>[http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220030214129%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20030214129&RS=DN/20030214129 US patent application 20030214129: Medication packaging and labeling system], U.S. Patent & Trademark Office.</ref> by student Deborah Adler and was named one of ''TIME's'' "Most Amazing Inventions of 2005."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1129522,00.html Best Inventions 2005: Healthy Options], ''Time'', November 21, 2005.</ref> After Target sold their in-store pharmacy and clinic operations to CVS Health in December 2015, CVS discontinued the use of ClearRx.<ref name="qz" />

Sometimes manufacturers will create red-colored items exclusively for Target.  In 2002, [[Nintendo]] produced a red [[List of Game Boy colors and styles#Special Edition Variants 5|special edition variant]] of the [[Game Boy Advance]], which featured the Target logo above the screen.<ref name="gameboyadvance">[http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/newsArt.cfm?artid=8056 Target Gets Exclusive New GBA Color!], ''Nintendo World Report'', Billy Berghammer, November 25, 2002.</ref>

In 2005, [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]] began a partnership with Target to promote a selection of independent films, both in Target stores and on IFC Monday nights at 9:00&nbsp;pm Eastern. Originally titled ''IFC Cinema Red'', the promotion was rebranded on-air as ''The Spotlight'' in 2007. The in-store headers refer to the selected titles as ''IFC Indies – Independent films chosen for Target by the Independent Film Channel.''<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5057/is_200607/ai_n18406438 Target welcomes indies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424005028/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5057/is_200607/ai_n18406438 |date=April 24, 2008 }}, BNET, July 2006.</ref>

In 2016, Target began to enforce [[gender neutrality]] in its marketing of toys, and stopped explicitly listed specific toys as being for "boys" or "girls."<ref>{{Cite web|title=How gender-targeted marketing is hurting toy retail|url=https://www.retaildive.com/news/how-gender-targeted-marketing-is-hurting-toy-retail/416547/|access-date=2020-07-31|website=Retail Dive|language=en-US}}</ref> This change came after the store stopped color coding toy aisles with pink and blue for "girls" or "boys," respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Schwab|first=Katharine|date=2016-05-05|title=Beyond Blue and Pink: Will Toys Ever Be Gender-Neutral?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/beyond-blue-and-pink-the-rise-of-gender-neutral-toys/480624/|access-date=2020-07-31|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US}}</ref> This practice was expanded with the February 2016 launch of new children's decor line, Pillowfort, which replaced its Circo brand and features more gender-neutral designs and color schemes.<ref name="startrib-pillowfort">{{cite news|title=Target takes gender-neutral approach with new kids home brand|url=http://www.startribune.com/target-takes-gender-neutral-approach-with-new-kids-home-brand/367849611/|access-date=February 8, 2006|work=Star-Tribune}}</ref>

===Gift cards===
The Target GiftCard is the retailing division's [[stored-value card]] or [[gift card]]. Target sells more gift cards than any other retailer in the United States and is one of the top sellers, by dollars and units, in the world.<ref>[http://www.secinfo.com/d11MXs.112p2.d.htm Target Corporation’s Third Quarter Earnings Release conference call], ''Securities Information from the SEC EDGAR database'', November 11, 2004.</ref> The unique designs of their cards contribute to their higher sales, as well as Target's policy of no expiration dates or service fees.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.target.com/b/ref=sc_iw_l_0/?node=1232828011 |title=About GiftCards: GiftCards |publisher=Target |access-date=February 21, 2010}}</ref> Past and current designs include [[lenticular printing|lenticular]], "scratch and sniff" (such as peppermint during the Christmas season), [[Phosphorescence|glow in the dark]], [[LED]] light-up, a gift card on the side of a [[Soap bubble|bubble blower]], a gift card that can function as a [[CD-ROM]], and even a gift card that allows the sender to record a voice message. A current environmentally friendly gift card is made from [[bioplastic]] manufactured from corn.<ref>[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/01/targets_bioplas.php Target's Bioplastic Gift Card], treehugger, January 31, 2006.</ref> Target rolled out a new [[MP3 player]] gift card for the 2006 holiday season. It holds 12 songs and must be purchased with an initial value of at least $50.

Beginning in January 2010, Target Stores rolled out Mobile GiftCards, through which one can produce a GiftCard barcode on any web-capable cell phone. This data matrix barcode can be scanned at a Target POS like any physical card barcode, and balances can be stored, retrieved, and gifted with the convenience of a cell phone.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nelson |first1=Ryan |title=The Target Affiliate Program |url=https://nichefacts.com/target-affiliate-program |website=Niche Facts |access-date=2 July 2018}}</ref>

Some of these unique design ideas are patented, and these patents are assigned to the Target Brands subsidiary. For example, some such Target GiftCard designs feature a wooden front side. On May 24, 2005, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] granted U.S. patent D505,450 for the "ornamental design for credit or stored value card with wood layer" to inventors Amy L. Lauer and John D. Mayhew.<ref>{{US patent|D505,450|US design patent D505,450}}: Credit or stored value card with wood layer, U.S. Patent & Trademark Office.</ref> U.S. patent 7004398, for the "stored-value card assembly including a stored-value card, an edible product, and a wrapper", was granted to Michael R. Francis and Barry C. Brooks on February 28, 2006.<ref>{{US patent|7004398}}: Stored-value card with edible product, U.S. Patent & Trademark Office.</ref> Both patents have been assigned by their inventors to Target Brands, Inc.

Target GiftCards are also collector's items. Some of the first gift cards issued are valued at over $300 (even though the card doesn't have any money on it). Every year, Target introduces new Holiday GiftCards. In 2007, Target's Holiday GiftCards featured a wind-up flashlight, a musical gift card, a gift card that lights up, and a scented gift card.

==Target forensic services==
In 2006, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' revealed that Target was operating two criminal [[forensics]] laboratories, one at its headquarters and the other in [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.azag.gov/StopMeth/RetailBusinessPerspectiveOnLawEnforcementPartnerships.pdf |title=Target Corporation Assets Protection |author=Office of the Arizona Attorney General |date=2006 |access-date=August 8, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620130430/http://www.azag.gov/StopMeth/RetailBusinessPerspectiveOnLawEnforcementPartnerships.pdf |archive-date=June 20, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Originally, the lab was created with the role of investigating internal instances of theft, fraud, and other criminal actions that have occurred on its own properties. Eventually, the company began offering [[pro bono]] services to law enforcement agencies across the country. Target's Forensic Services has assisted agencies at all levels of government, including such federal agencies as the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], and the [[United States Secret Service]].<ref name=police_work>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/28/AR2006012801268.html |title=Retailer Target Branches Out Into Police Work|work=The Washington Post|date= January 29, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/anderson.cooper.360/blog/2006/02/target-sets-sights-on-hard-to-crack.html |title=Target sets sights on hard-to-crack cases|work= CNN|date= February 9, 2006}}</ref>

===LGBTQ===
Pop star [[Lady Gaga]] was expected to give the store an exclusive expanded edition of her then upcoming album ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'', but she ended the deal after discovering that then CEO Gregg Steinhafel donated to a political action group that supported an anti-gay candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-ends-deal-with-target-over-its-support-of-anti-gay-groups-20110309|title=Lady Gaga Ends Deal With Target Over Its Support of Anti-Gay Groups}}</ref> Target apologized<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2010/08/05/target-apology-donation|title=Target apologizes for donation to MN Forward|first=Tom|last=Scheck}}</ref> and began its outward support of the  [[LGBTQ]] community.

===Pornographic audio over loudspeaker incident===
On October 14, 2015, audio from a [[pornographic film]] was unexpectedly broadcast over the [[public address system]] of a Target location in [[Campbell, California]]. The incident was recorded by a shopper, Gina Young, and uploaded to [[YouTube]] where it quickly went [[viral video|viral]]; Young stated that some patrons immediately left the store while others offered to cover her children's ears and confronted employees scrambling to silence the broadcast. A Target in [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo]] was involved in a similar incident four months earlier. A Target spokeswoman stated that the company was "actively reviewing the situation with the team to better understand what happened and to help ensure this doesn't happen again."

==="Bathroom policy" and boycott===
[[Image:TargetRestroom.jpg|thumb|right|Restroom at a Target store.]]
In April 2016, Target announced on its website that it would allow transgender customers and employees access to use restrooms and changing areas that correspond with the gender with which they identify, except where local laws require otherwise. The announcement read: "We believe that everyone—every team member, every guest, and every community—deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally. Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination. In our stores, we demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive experience in many ways. Most relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Travis|title=Target CEO responds to nationwide boycott of the store over transgender bathroom policy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/05/13/target-ceo-responds-to-nationwide-boycott-of-the-store-over-transgender-bathroom-policy/|access-date=January 2, 2018|work=Washington Post|date=May 13, 2016}}</ref> The ''[[New York Times]]'' called this "the most prominent position taken by a national retailer".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Abrams|first1=Rachel|title=Target Steps Out in Front of Bathroom Choice Debate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/business/target-steps-out-in-front-of-bathroom-choice-debate.html|access-date=May 3, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=April 27, 2016}}</ref> In response, the [[American Family Association]] (AFA) launched a nationwide boycott; by April 28 about one million people had signed the AFA's petition.<ref>{{cite news|title=More than 700,000 pledge to boycott Target over transgender bathroom policy|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/04/25/conservative-christian-group-boycotting-target-transgender-bathroom-policy/83491396/|access-date=May 3, 2016|work=USA TODAY}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Wahba|first1=Phil|title=Nearly 1 Million Sign Pledge to Boycott Target Over Bathroom Policy|url=http://fortune.com/2016/04/28/target-transgender-bathroom-petition/|access-date=May 2, 2016|work=Fortune|date=April 28, 2016}}</ref> Around the time of publicity about the policy, polls reported a drop from 42% to 38% of consumers noting they would shop at Target.<ref>{{cite news|title=Target brand perception falls, but it's not 'catastrophic'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/04/29/target-bathroom-transgender-brand-perception/83702928/|access-date=May 28, 2016|work=USA TODAY}}</ref> In mid-May, CEO Cornell said the boycott impacted "just a handful of stores across the country".<ref>{{cite news|title=Target Says Boycotts Over Bathroom Policy Not Hurting Sales|url=http://fortune.com/2016/05/18/target-transgender-bathroom-2/|access-date=May 28, 2016|work=Fortune|date=May 18, 2016}}</ref> Some observers, such as ''[[Fortune Magazine|Fortune]]''{{'}}s Phil Wahba, believed that Target's bathroom policy may have caused part of Target's drop in shopper traffic during the [[Fiscal year#United States|second quarter]] of 2016.

===Absence of AEDs in stores===
In 2014, the California Supreme Court ruled that Target stores do not have a positive duty to keep AEDs (Automated External Defibrillators) in stores for purposes of first aid.

===Refusal to stock albums after digital release===
Target initially refused to sell [[Frank Ocean]]'s ''[[Channel Orange]]'' and [[Beyoncé]]'s [[Beyoncé (album)|self-titled album]], due to those records becoming available to [[music download|digital retailers]], like [[iTunes Store|iTunes]], before physical copies were made. Target representatives argued that doing so impacted how well those records would sell at Target stores, and stocking them could cause the corporation to lose money.<ref name="newsfeed.time.com">{{cite web|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/07/16/why-wont-target-stocking-frank-oceans-new-album/|title=Why Won't Target Stock Frank Ocean's New Album?|first=Eliana|last=Dockterman|via=newsfeed.time.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/5839839/target-not-selling-beyonces-new-album|title=Target Not Selling Beyonce's New Album}}</ref>

Target started sponsoring stock cars in 2001 with [[Sterling Marlin]] when Chip Ganassi bought into the [[Felix Sabates]] stock car team.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In the [[2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series]] season, the No. 41 Chip Ganassi Target car was driven by [[Jimmy Spencer]], and from 2003 to 2005, [[Casey Mears]] drove the car.

Sorenson drove the car through the 2008 season, and Target has also had some major sponsorship time on the Ganassi Racing No. 40 car with [[Dario Franchitti]] and [[Jeremy Mayfield]] who subbed for the injured Franchitti. The 40 team has since been shut down.
