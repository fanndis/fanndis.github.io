The '''Sunflower Student Movement''' is associated with a protest [[Social movement|movement]] driven by a coalition of students and civic groups that came to a head between March 18 and April 10, 2014, in the [[Legislative Yuan]] and, later, also the [[Executive Yuan]] of [[Taiwan]].<ref name="NYT-Ramsey">{{cite web | url=http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/22/as-numbers-swell-students-pledge-to-continue-occupying-taiwans-legislature/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0 | title=As Numbers Swell, Students Pledge to Continue Occupying Taiwan's Legislature | work=The New York Times | date=March 22, 2014 | accessdate=March 22, 2014 | author=Ramzy, Austin}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:【直擊】警提升府維安 對戰一觸即發|url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/politics/20140320/363204/%E3%80%90%E7%9B%B4%E6%93%8A%E3%80%91%E5%A4%A7%E9%9B%A8%E6%BE%86%E4%B8%8D%E7%86%84%E3%80%80%E8%90%AC%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%8D%E6%9C%8D%E8%B2%BF|work=Apple Daily|accessdate=March 20, 2014|language=Chinese|date=March 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Ying-yu|last=Tseng|first2=Elizabeth|last2= Hsu|title=Protesters break police line, storm Legislature|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201403180044.aspx|work=Focus Taiwan|agency=[[Central News Agency (Republic of China)|Central News Agency]]|accessdate=March 19, 2014|date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> The activists protested the passing of the [[Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement]] (CSSTA) by the ruling party [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) at the legislature without clause-by-clause review.

== Background ==
On March 17 2014, Taiwan's ruling [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) attempted a unilateral move in the Legislative Yuan to force the [[Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement]] (CSSTA) to the legislative floor without giving it a clause-by-clause review as previously established in a June 2013 agreement with the opposing [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP). Previously, in September 2013, the two parties had agreed to hold 16 public hearings over the details of the trade agreement with academics, NGOs and representatives of trade sectors impacted by the agreement. The KMT had chaired eight public hearings within a week, and several members of social groups, NGOs, and business representatives from impacted industries were either not invited or were informed at the last minute.<ref name = "Diplomat-Cole" /> When academics and business sector representatives gave their opinions at the hearings, the presiding chair of the legislature's Internal Administrative Committee, KMT legislator {{ill|Chang Ching-chung|zh|張慶忠}}, said the agreement had to be adopted in its entirety and could not be amended.<ref name="BrownSCNN" /> Legislative gridlock followed, as the opposing DPP had not completed the eight hearings they had agreed to chair by March 17. Chang, citing Article 61 of the Legislative Yuan Functions Act, announced that the review process had gone beyond the 90 days allotted for review. The agreement, in the KMT's view, should therefore be considered reviewed and should be submitted to a plenary session on March 21 for a final vote.<ref name = "Diplomat-Cole"/>

== Occupation ==

=== Legislative chamber's occupation ===
On March 18 around 9:00&nbsp;p.m. local time, crowds of students, academics, civic organizations, and other protestors climbed over the fence at the legislature and entered the building. In the melee, one window of the [[Legislative Yuan]] was smashed and a police officer suffered serious injuries. A lawyer who was assigned to the protesters stated that six individuals had been arrested over the protest so far. While several hundred protesters remained outside the building, about 300 protesters occupied the legislative floor overnight and succeeded in preventing several attempts by police to expel them. The protesters demanded that the clause-by-clause review of the agreement be reinstated, otherwise they vowed to occupy the legislature until March 21, when the Yuan had scheduled to vote and pass the CSSTA. As night approached, the authorities cut water and electricity to the building. Premier Jiang Yi-huah ordered riot police be sent in to evict the protesters, but that directive was not implemented.<ref name = "Diplomat-Cole"/><ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:台灣反服貿協議團體佔領立法院議事場|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/zhongwen/trad/china/2014/03/140318_taiwan_demo.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=March 19, 2014|language=Chinese|date=March 18, 2014}}</ref>

After members of protest organizations booked a room at the hotel, police and hotel staff reportedly entered the room without authorization and demanded the guests check out immediately.<ref>{{cite news|last1=王|first1=張會|script-title=zh:張志軍抵台 野蠻飯店 踹門趕示威房客|url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/headline/20140626/35918787/%E5%BC%B5%E5%BF%97%E8%BB%8D%E6%8A%B5%E5%8F%B0%E9%87%8E%E8%A0%BB%E9%A3%AF%E5%BA%97%E8%B8%B9%E9%96%80%E8%B6%95%E7%A4%BA%E5%A8%81%E6%88%BF%E5%AE%A2|accessdate=June 27, 2014|work=Apple Daily|date=June 26, 2014|language=Chinese}}</ref> Hotel management said in a statement that the number of people staying in the room did not correspond with the number registered at the reception.

When Zhang arrived at a casual meeting with Wang Yu-chi at Sizihwan Sunset Beach Resort in [[Xiziwan]], [[Gushan District]] on June 27 around 8:10&nbsp;pm, protesters organized by [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] and Black Island National Youth Front greeted the motorcade by spraying white paint and throwing [[ghost money]], shouting slogans such as "[[One Country on Each Side]]" and "Zhang Zhijun get out of here". The white paint did not hit Zhang but did hit his body guards.<ref>{{cite news|title=【更新】張志軍至西子灣 黑島青丟白漆砸車|url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/politics/20140627/424143/|accessdate=June 30, 2014|work=Apple Daily|date=June 27, 2014}}</ref>

More than 200 professors and industry experts issued joint statements and held panel discussions warning the national security risks raised in the opening of the type II telecommunication services outlined in the trade pact. The [[National Communications Commission]] denied the liberalization of telecommunication services would pose security threats.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:服貿開發資通訊對國安的影響|url=http://www.slideshare.net/ntuperc/20140331-qa|publisher=Slideshare|accessdate=April 13, 2014|language=Chinese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:近3百位電機資訊教授連署反對服貿開放資通訊產業|url=http://www.ithome.com.tw/news/86596|publisher=iThome|accessdate=April 14, 2014|language=Chinese|date=April 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Shan|first=Shelley|title=TRADE PACT SIEGE: Experts decry NCC telecom plans|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/04/10/2003587705/1|work=Taipei Times|accessdate=April 14, 2014|date=April 10, 2014}}</ref>

On March 21, a group of presidents from the 52-member Associations of [[List of universities in Taiwan#National Universities|national universities of Taiwan]] issued a joint statement calling on President Ma Ying-jeou to respond to the student-led protesters' demands, and urged Ma to engage in talks with student protest leaders as soon as possible to defuse the situation. 25 of 34 professors at the National Taiwan University Mathematics Department also issued another statement declaring their support for the protesting students and the public, stating that:

<blockquote>We are not against the signing of the service trade agreement per se, since we do live in a world being swept by globalization, but the signing and review processes must be transparent and executed with due process. This is why we support what the students are demanding, which is rejecting any agreement signed 'in a black box.</blockquote>

The statement also criticized remarks made earlier by a high-ranking Ministry of Economic Affairs official, who described the agreement as "beneficial to the students because after its implementation, they can work in China and earn NT$52,000 a month, rather than [the] NT$22,000 [they would make in Taiwan]." In the statement, the professors also asked if ''"sending [Taiwan's] educated youth to China for work [was] the government's only solution for the nation's low wage and wealth gap problems."''<ref name="university statement">{{cite web|title=University heads call on Ma to respond to occupiers|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/03/23/2003586323|work=The Taipei Times|accessdate=March 23, 2014|author=Chen Yi-ching|last2=Lin|first2=Rachel|date=March 23, 2014}}</ref>

On March 22, Premier Jiang Yi-huah met with protesters but declined to withdraw the deal or agree to legislation monitoring future cross-strait agreements, saying that the two issues required the involvement of the Executive Yuan and President Ma Ying-jeou. Jiang stated that there is no need to enact new laws monitoring cross-strait agreements since "the governing party the [[Kuomintang]] has already proposed measures pertaining to the monitoring of such agreements by the legislature and the public that are supported by Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng. Therefore, there is no need for new legislation."<ref>{{cite web|last=Loa|first=Iok-sin|title=Jiang-protester talks fail before they start|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/03/23/2003586322/1

Polish media group Niezalezna – which owns several print and online news outlets in Poland, including the daily ''[[Gazeta Polska Codziennie]]'', the weekly ''[[Gazeta Polska]]'' and the monthly ''Nowe Panstwo'' — received a letter from the [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office|Taipei Economic and Cultural Bureau]] in Poland, protesting its use of an analogy between the occupation of the Executive Yuan compound by protesters and the consequent violent crackdown by police and the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|occupation]] of the central square, Maidan, in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, by protesters who were also treated brutally by the police. Hanna Shen, the journalist who wrote the story and other reports about the movement, expressed shock about receiving the letter:

<blockquote>My newspaper has been publishing articles very critical of the governments of Russia, China and the former Ukrainian government, but we never received any letter from the representative offices of those countries asking us to retract anything. I personally think this letter, as an attempt to influence, to control the way media in free and democratic Poland writes about Taiwan, is not acceptable.
