'''House of Deréon''' was a [[ready-to-wear]] fashion line introduced by singer and actress [[Beyoncé]] and her mother/stylist [[Tina Knowles|Tina Lawson]]. The style and concept is inspired by three generations of women in their family, with the name "Deréon" paying tribute to Beyoncé's maternal grandmother, Agnèz Deréon (mother of Tina Lawson). As of 2012 the junior line Deréon has been discontinued.

Deréon was introduced in 2006, with the tag line, "Where the sidewalk and catwalk meet". The line includes casualwear, such as sweatpants and embroidered hooded sweatshirts. The House of Deréon was introduced on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', and was also featured on ''[[The Tyra Banks Show]]''. The clothing mixes hip-hop influences, such as its use of denim, with ultra-feminine flourishes like embroidery and ruffles. In an interview with ''Ebony'' magazine, Beyoncé said "I love the clothes from the '70s, my mother's clothes. I love clothes from the '40s, my grandmother's style, so elegant. We wanted to take elements from my grandmother's legacy—the beaded lace, lush colors, fine fabrics—and mix them with clothes from my mother's generation and my generation."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_2_61/ai_n15893494|title=A family affair: Beyonce & Tina Knowles launch fashion line House of Dereon|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|date=December 2005|publisher=[[FindArticles]].

== Agnèz Beyincé ==
{{more citations needed|date=September 2010}}
'''Agnèz Beyincé''' (born '''Agnès DeRouen'''; 1909-1984), was a [[Louisiana]] native, whose birth surname and passion for creating beauty from the mundane is the inspiration for House of Deréon, a fashion line founded by her daughter, [[Tina Knowles]], and her granddaughter, [[Beyoncé Knowles]].

Agnèz Deréon was born on July 1, 1909 in [[Delcambre, Louisiana]], a town near the city of [[New Iberia, Louisiana]]. Deréon was the daughter of Eugène Gustave "Eugenie" DeRouen (1860–1937) and Odilia Broussard (daughter of E.R. Broussard and Josephine Lesser).<ref name="genealogy">{{cite web|url=http://genforum.genealogy.com/broussard/messages/753.html|title=Broussard ancestors of Beyoncé Giselle Knowles|author=Harrison LaTour|publisher=Genforum Genealogy|accessdate=September 19, 2011|date=July 10, 2007}}</ref> She and her family were [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Créoles]]. Self-taught, she became a well-known [[sewing|seamstress]] catering to private clients in Louisiana. She was accustomed to tailoring pieces that stood out by decorating the fabrics she used with such embellishments as embroidery, appliques and smocking. Incorporating materials such as lace, beads and jeweled buttons, Deréon made her style unique, according to the House of Deréon official website.

Deréon, later, married Lumis Beyincé of [[Abbeville, Louisiana]], at which point her surname changed from Deréon to Beyincé. Lumis was the son of Alexandre Beyincé (Boyancé) and Marie Olivier. The couple relocated to [[Galveston, Texas]] where they raised their family (some of the Beyincé relatives still live in Galveston). Both Agnèz and Lumis Beyincé were French-speaking Creoles of predominantly [[French people|French]], [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] descent.

The Beyincé family was upwardly mobile. The couple made many sacrifices to see that their children matriculated through private school and received a proper education. In an interview with ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine, Tina Knowles recalls that her mother made altar boy robes and other garments for the church so her children could attend Catholic schools.

== Controversy ==
In May 2008, the fashion line released advertisements for its girls line called "The Deréon Girls Collection".  The fashion line infuriated critics when the advertisement displayed seven-year-old girls in full makeup and high heels. A poll online on the [[Washington Post]] website has stated that 62% of the readers believe the advertisements oversexualize young girls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/celebritology/2008/05/beyonces_bootylicious_kid_ads.html|title=Beyonce's Bootylicious Kid Ads: Over The Line?|work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|first=Liz|last=Kelly |date=May 14, 2008|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}</ref>
