By the early 19th century, Belfast became a major [[port]]. It played an important role in the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Ireland, becoming briefly the biggest [[linen]]-producer in the world, earning it the nickname "[[Linenopolis]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.connollycove.com/linenopolis-linen-quarter-belfast/|title=Linenopolis: The Linen Quarter of Belfast {{!}} Connolly Cove {{!}}|last=ConnollyCove|date=2019-08-12|website=Connolly Cove|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> By the time it was granted [[City status in the United Kingdom#Northern Ireland|city status]] in 1888, it was a major centre of Irish linen production, [[tobacco]]-processing and rope-making.

Following the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1922, Belfast became the seat of government for Northern Ireland. Belfast's status as a global industrial centre ended in the decades after the [[World War II|Second World War]].

Belfast is still a port with commercial and industrial docks, including the Harland and Wolff shipyard, dominating the [[Belfast Lough]] shoreline. It is served by two airports: [[George Best Belfast City Airport]] and [[Belfast International Airport]] {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} west of the city.

==Name==
The name Belfast derives from the Irish ''{{lang|ga| Béal Feirsde}}'', later spelt ''{{lang|ga|Béal Feirste}}''.<ref name="Logainm"/> The word ''{{lang|ga|béal}}'' means "mouth" or "river-mouth" while ''{{lang|ga|feirsde/feirste}}'' is the genitive singular of ''{{lang|ga|fearsaid}}'' and refers to a [[shoal| sandbar]] or tidal [[ford (crossing) |ford]] across a river's mouth.<ref name="Logainm">{{cite web |url= http://www.logainm.ie/118005.aspx |title= Placenames Database of Ireland – Belfast: '''view the scanned records''' |publisher= Logainm.ie |access-date= 25 May 2014 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20130702093937/http://www.logainm.ie/118005.aspx |archive-date= 2 July 2013 | url-status = live}}</ref><ref name="Belfast name">{{cite web |title= Placenames/Logainmneacha – Belfast |website= BBC Northern Ireland – Education |publisher= BBC |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas/education/beginnersblas/1belfast.shtml |access-date= 17 May 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090115045404/http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas/education/beginnersblas/1belfast.shtml |archive-date= 15 January 2009 | url-status = live}}</ref> The name therefore translates literally as "(river) mouth of the sandbar" or "(river) mouth of the ford".<ref name="Logainm"/> The sandbar formed at the confluence (at present-day Donegall Quay) of two rivers: the [[River Lagan| Lagan]], which flows into Belfast Lough, and the Lagan's tributary the [[River Farset| Farset]]. This area became the hub around which the original settlement developed.<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/archive/places/a-town-is-born-four-hundred-years-ago-belfast-officially-became-a-town-and-so-began-an-unlikely-success-story-29223858.html|title= A town is born; Four hundred years ago Belfast officially became a town and so began an unlikely success story|work= BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|access-date= 2019-11-06|language= en-GB|issn= 0307-1235|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191106123008/https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/archive/places/a-town-is-born-four-hundred-years-ago-belfast-officially-became-a-town-and-so-began-an-unlikely-success-story-29223858.html|archive-date= 6 November 2019|url-status= live}}</ref> The Irish name ''{{lang|ga|Béal Feirste}}'' is shared by a [[County Mayo]] [[townland]] which has the anglicised name  ''Belfarsad''.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.logainm.ie/37016.aspx |title= Placenames Database of Ireland – Belfarsad |publisher= Logainm.ie |access-date= 13 November 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110816184830/http://www.logainm.ie/37016.aspx |archive-date= 16 August 2011 | url-status = live}}</ref>

An alternative interpretation of the name, "mouth of [the river] of the sandbar", would allude to the River Farset, which flows into the Lagan where the sandbar was located. [[Edmund Hogan]]<ref>{{Cite book |title= Onomasticon Goedelicum |last= Hogan |first= Edmund |year= 1910 |location= Dublin |url= http://publish.ucc.ie/doi/locus/B |access-date= 1 June 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717183101/http://publish.ucc.ie/doi/locus/B |archive-date= 17 July 2011 |url-status = live}}</ref> and [[John O'Donovan (scholar) |John O'Donovan]]<ref>{{Cite book |title= Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland |last= O'Donovan |first= John |year= 1856 |location= Dublin |url= https://archive.org/stream/annalarioghachta04ocle#page/1100/mode/2up |access-date= 6 March 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924151447/http://www.archive.org/stream/annalarioghachta04ocle#page/1100/mode/2up |archive-date= 24 September 2015 | url-status = live}}</ref> favoured this interpretation.

==History==
{{Main|History of Belfast}}

The [[county borough]] of Belfast was created when it was granted city status by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1888,<ref>{{cite web | title = Belfast City Hall | website = Discover Northern Ireland | publisher = Ireland Tourist Board | url = http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/product.aspx?ProductID=2782 | access-date = 18 May 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070616234058/http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/product.aspx?ProductID=2782 | archive-date = 16 June 2007 | url-status = dead }}</ref> and the city continues to straddle [[County Antrim]] and [[County Down]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Belfast, Newcastle and the County Down Coast | website = County Down Northern Ireland | publisher = GoIreland.com | url = http://www.countydown.com/ | access-date = 17 January 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081219115641/http://www.countydown.com/ | archive-date = 19 December 2008 |url-status = dead}}</ref>

===Origins===
The site of Belfast has been occupied since the [[Bronze Age]]. The [[Giants Ring, Belfast|Giant's Ring]], a 5,000-year-old [[henge]], is located near the city,<ref>{{cite news |title=A walk on the outskirts of Belfast: Giant's Ring Trail, Northern Ireland |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 May 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/may/12/giants-ring-trail-belfast-walk |access-date=1 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030002902/http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/may/12/giants-ring-trail-belfast-walk |archive-date=30 October 2013 |url-status = live}}</ref> and the remains of [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]]s can still be seen in the surrounding hills. Belfast remained a small settlement of little importance during the [[High Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]. [[John de Courcy]] built a castle on what is now Castle Street in the city centre in the 12th century, but this was on a lesser scale and not as strategically important as [[Carrickfergus Castle]] to the north, which was built by de Courcy in 1177. The [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neill]] clan had a presence in the area.

In the 14th century, Cloinne Aodha Buidhe, descendants of Aodh Buidhe O'Neill, built Grey Castle at Castlereagh, now in the east of the city.<ref>{{cite book | last = Komesu | first = Okifumi | title = Irish Writers and Politics | page = 73 | publisher = Rowman & Littlefield | url = https://books.google.com/?id=AwFO2Z8Bk0YC&pg=PA73 | year= 1990 | isbn = 978-0-389-20926-3}}</ref> Conn O'Neill of the Clannaboy O'Neills owned vast lands in the area and was the last inhabitant of Grey Castle, one remaining link being the Conn's Water river flowing through east Belfast.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theflightoftheearls.net/May2406.pdf |title=Celebrations mark the arrival of first Ulster Scots in Ireland |newspaper=Irish News |date=24 April 2006 |access-date=18 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927114138/http://www.theflightoftheearls.net/May2406.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status = dead}}</ref>

===The Early Town===
[[File:Bastille-day-belfast-1791.jpg|upright=0.90|thumb|right|Volunteer Corps parade down High Street, [[Bastille Day]], 1792.]]
Belfast became a substantial settlement in the 17th century after being established as an English town by [[Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester|Sir Arthur Chichester]].<ref name="belfast castle history">{{cite web |title=History of Belfast Castle |website=Tourism and venues |publisher=[[Belfast City Council]] |year=2014 |url=http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/tourism-venues/belfastcastle/bchistory.aspx |access-date=19 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519235252/http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/tourism-venues/belfastcastle/bchistory.aspx |archive-date=19 May 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As it grew with the port, and with textile manufacture, the English element was overwhelmed by the influx of Scottish Presbyterians. As "Dissenters" from the established Church of Ireland communion, the Presbyterians were conscious of sharing, if only in part, the [[Penal Laws|disabilities]] of Ireland's largely dispossessed [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Roman Catholic]] majority.

When, in the [[American Revolutionary War|American War Independence]], [[North Channel Naval Duel|Belfast Lough was raided]] by the privateer, [[John Paul Jones]], the townspeople assembled their own [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Volunteer militia]]. This emboldened a spirit a radical disaffection. Further enthused by the [[French Revolution]], the Volunteers and townspeople rallied in support of [[Catholic emancipation]] and "a more equal representation of the people" in the Irish Parliament.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Belfast: An Illustrated History|last=Bardon |first=Jonathan |publisher=Blackstaff Press |year=1982 |location=Belfast|isbn=0856402729|pages=50}}</ref>

Evidence of this period of Belfast's growth can still be seen in the oldest areas of the city, known as the [[The Belfast Entries|Entries]].

===The Industrial City===
[[File:High Street, Belfast (5785358121).jpg|thumb|left|High Street c.1906]]
Rapid industrial growth in the nineteenth century drew in landless Catholics from outlying rural and western districts, most settling to the west of the town. The plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract the English and Scottish capital to Belfast, but it was also a cause of insecurity. Protestant workers organised to protect "their" jobs giving a new lease of life in the town to the once largely rural [[Orange Order]]. Sectarian tensions were heightened by movements to [[Repeal Association|repeal the Acts of Union]] and to [[Irish Home Rule movement|restore a Parliament]] in [[Dublin]]. Given the progressive enlargement of the British electoral franchise, this would have had an overwhelming Catholic majority and, it was widely believed, interests inimical to the Protestant and industrial north. In 1864 and 1886 the issue had helped trigger deadly sectarian riots.

Sectarian tension was not in itself unique to Belfast: it was shared with Liverpool and Glasgow, cities that following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] had also experienced large scale Irish Catholic immigration.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Irish Migrants in Modern Britain, 1750–1922 |last=MacRaild |first=Donald |publisher=Macmillan |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-312-22032-7 |location=London}}</ref> But also common to this "industrial triangle" were traditions of labour militancy. In 1919, workers in all three cities struck for a ten-hour reduction in the working week. In Belfast—notwithstanding the political friction caused by [[Sinn Féin]]'s [[1918 Irish general election|electoral triumph]] in the south—this involved some 60,000 workers, Protestant and Catholic, in a four-week walk-out.<ref>{{cite news |title=Belfast strike of 1919 paved the way for shorter working week |last=Holland |first=Mairead |url=http://www.irishnews.com/paywall/tsb/irishnews/irishnews/irishnews//news/northernirelandnews/2019/01/28/news/belfast-strike-of-1919-paved-the-way-for-shorter-working-week-1537160/content.html |work=Irish News |date=28 January 2019 |access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>

In a demonstration of their resolve not to submit to a Dublin parliament, in 1912 [[Belfast City Hall]] unionists presented the [[Ulster Covenant]], which, with an associated Declaration for women, was to accumulate over 470,000 signatures. This was followed by the drilling and eventual arming of a 100,000 strong [[Ulster Volunteer Force]]. The crisis was abated by the onset of the [[World War One|Great War]], the sacrifices of the UVF in which continue to be commemorated in the city ([[Battle of the Somme|Somme Day]]) by unionist and loyalist organisations.

In 1921, as the greater part of Ireland seceded as the [[Irish Free State]], Belfast became the capital of the six counties remaining as [[Northern Ireland]] in the United Kingdom. In 1932 the devolved parliament for the region was housed in new buildings at [[Stormont Buildings|Stormont]] on the eastern edge of the city. In 1920–21, as the two parts of Ireland [[Partition of Ireland|drew apart]], up to 500 people were killed in disturbances in Belfast, the bloodiest period of strife in the city until [[the Troubles]] of the late 1960s onwards.<ref>Lynch, Robert. ''The Northern IRA and the Early Years of Partition'', p227</ref>

[[File:AIR RAID DAMAGE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM 1939-1945 - H 9476.jpg|thumb|right|Aftermath of the Blitz in May 1941]]
Belfast was [[Belfast Blitz|heavily bombed]] during [[World War II]]. Initial raids were a surprise as the city was believed to be outside of the range of German bomber planes. In one raid, in 1941, German bombers killed around one thousand people and left tens of thousands homeless. Apart from London, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during the [[The Blitz|Blitz]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm |title=The Belfast blitz is remembered |work=BBC News |date=11 April 2001 |access-date=12 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111212052/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm |archive-date=11 January 2009 |url-status = live}}</ref>

===The Troubles===
{{Main|The Troubles}}
Belfast has been the capital of Northern Ireland since its establishment in 1921 following the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. It had been the scene of various episodes of sectarian conflict between its Catholic and Protestant populations. These opposing groups in this conflict are now often termed [[Irish republicanism|republican]] and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] respectively, although they are also loosely referred to as '[[Irish nationalism|nationalist]]' and '[[Unionism (Ireland)|unionist]]'. The most recent example of this conflict was known as the Troubles – a civil conflict that raged from around 1969 to 1998.<ref name="bbc trouble history">{{cite web |last=Kelters |first=Seamus |title=Violence in the Troubles |website=History |publisher=BBC |date=February 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/troubles_violence |access-date=19 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605010515/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/troubles_violence |archive-date=5 June 2013 |url-status = live}}</ref>

Belfast saw some of the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, particularly in the 1970s, with rival paramilitary groups formed on both sides. Bombing, assassination and street violence formed a backdrop to life throughout the Troubles.

===Local government===
{{Details|Belfast City Council}}

Belfast City Council is the [[Local government in Northern Ireland|local council]] with responsibility for the city. The city's elected officials are the [[Lord Mayor of Belfast]], Deputy Lord Mayor and [[High Sheriff]] who are elected from among 60 [[councillors]]. The first Lord Mayor of Belfast was [[Sir Daniel Dixon, 1st Baronet|Daniel Dixon]], who was elected in 1892.<ref name="Belfast City Council – Lord Mayor">{{cite web|title=Councillors: Lord Mayor |publisher=Belfast City Council |url=http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/councillors/index.asp?menuitem2=lord-mayor |access-date=24 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607193627/http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/councillors/index.asp?menuitem2=lord-mayor |archive-date=7 June 2007 |url-status = dead}}</ref> The [[Lord Mayor]] for 2019–20 is John Finucane [[Sinn Féin]], while the Deputy Lord Mayor is an [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] councillor. The Lord Mayor's duties include presiding over meetings of the council, receiving distinguished visitors to the city, representing and promoting the city on the national and international stage.<ref name="Belfast City Council – Lord Mayor"/>

[[File:Belfast City Hall 2.jpg|thumb|Belfast City Hall]]
In 1997, [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] lost overall control of Belfast City Council for the first time in its history, with the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] gaining the balance of power between [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] and unionists. This position was confirmed in four subsequent council elections, with mayors from Sinn Féin and the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP), both of whom are nationalist parties, and the cross-community Alliance Party regularly elected since. The first nationalist Lord Mayor of Belfast was Alban Maginness of the SDLP, in 1997.

As Northern Ireland's capital city, Belfast is host to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]], the site of the [[Devolution#Northern Ireland|devolved]] legislature for Northern Ireland. Belfast is divided into four [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliamentary]] constituencies: [[Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast North]], [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]], [[Belfast South (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast South]] and [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]]. All four extend beyond the city boundaries to include parts of [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh]], [[Lisburn City Council|Lisburn]] and [[Newtownabbey Borough Council|Newtownabbey]] districts. In the [[2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election|Northern Ireland Assembly Elections in 2017]], Belfast elected 20 [[Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs), 5 from each [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland|constituency]]. Belfast elected 7 [[Sinn Féin]], 5 [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]], 2 [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]], 3 [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]], 1 [[Ulster Unionist Party|UUP]], 1 [[Green Party in Northern Ireland|Green]] and 1 [[People Before Profit Alliance|PBPA]] MLAs.<ref>{{cite news | title = Northern Ireland election | work = BBC News | date = 8 May 2016 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2016/northern_ireland/resultsm | access-date = 11 May 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In the 2017 UK general election, Belfast elected one [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] from each constituency to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] at Westminster, London.

Belfast is at the western end of Belfast Lough and at the mouth of the River Lagan giving it the ideal location for the shipbuilding industry that once made it famous. When the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' was built in Belfast in 1911–1912, [[Harland and Wolff]] had the largest shipyard in the world.<ref name="Titanic in History">{{cite web|title=Introduction To Titanic – Titanic in History |website=Titanic.

Belfast is situated on Northern Ireland's eastern [[coast]] at {{Coord|54|35|49|N|05|55|45|W}}. A consequence of this northern latitude is that it both endures short winter days and enjoys long summer evenings. During the [[winter solstice]], the shortest day of the year, local sunset is before 16:00 while sunrise is around 08:45. This is balanced by the [[Solstice|summer solstice]] in June, when the sun sets after 22:00 and rises before 05:00.<ref>{{cite web | title = Sunrise and sunset in Belfast | website = Sun Calculator | publisher = time and date.com | url = http://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/uk/belfast | access-date = 18 May 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140724071927/http://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/uk/belfast | archive-date = 24 July 2014 |url-status = live}}</ref>

In 1994, a [[Lagan Weir|weir]] was built across the river by the [[Laganside Corporation]] to raise the average water level so that it would cover the unseemly mud flats which gave Belfast its name<ref>{{cite web|title=Lagan Weir – Why it exists |publisher=Laganside |url=http://www.laganside.com/laganweir.asp |access-date=25 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418044643/http://www.laganside.com/laganweir.asp |archive-date=18 April 2007 |url-status = dead}}</ref> ({{etymology|ga|Béal Feirste|The sandy ford at the river mouth}}).<ref name="Belfast name"/> The area of Belfast Local Government District is {{convert|42.31|sqmi|km2}}.<ref name=Areameasurements>{{cite web|title=Area Measurements in Northern Ireland |website=2001 census Data |publisher=Northern Ireland Statistics & Research Agency |year=2001 |url=http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census/area_measurement.html |access-date=18 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617083217/http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census/area_measurement.html|archive-date=17 June 2007 |url-status = dead}}</ref>

The [[River Farset]] is also named after this [[silt]] deposit (from the Irish ''feirste'' meaning "sand spit"). Originally a more significant river than it is today, the Farset formed a dock on High Street until the mid 19th century. Bank Street in the [[Belfast City Centre|city centre]] referred to the river bank and Bridge Street was named for the site of an early Farset bridge.<ref>{{cite web|title=Belfast City: Did you know? |website=Discover Ireland |publisher=Tourism Ireland |year=2007 |url=http://www.discoverireland.com/za/ireland-places-to-go/areas-and-cities/belfast-city/highlights/culture/ |access-date=18 May 2007 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928125051/http://www.discoverireland.com/za/ireland-places-to-go/areas-and-cities/belfast-city/highlights/culture/ |archive-date=28 September 2007 }}</ref> Superseded by the River Lagan as the more important river in the city, the Farset now languishes in obscurity, under High Street. There are no less than twelve other minor rivers in and around Belfast, namely the Blackstaff, the Colin, the Connswater, the Cregagh, the Derriaghy, the Forth, the Knock, the Legoniel, the Loop, the Milewater, the Purdysburn and the Ravernet.<ref>Des O'Reilly, [http://www.colourpointbooks.co.uk/more_details.php?id=1016 Rivers of Belfast – A History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723042224/http://www.colourpointbooks.co.uk/more_details.php?id=1016 |date=23 July 2013 }}</ref>

===Climate===
As with the vast majority of the rest of Ireland, Belfast has a [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with a narrow range of temperatures and rainfall throughout the year. The climate of Belfast is significantly milder than most other locations in the world at a similar latitude, due to the warming influence of the [[Gulf Stream]]. There are currently five weather observing stations in the Belfast area: [[Helen's Bay]], Stormont, Newforge, Castlereagh, and Ravenhill Road. Slightly further afield is Aldergrove Airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-extremes|title=Station Locations|access-date=23 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603030136/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-extremes/|archive-date=3 June 2013|url-status = live}}</ref> The highest temperature recorded at any official weather station in the Belfast area was {{convert|30.8|C|F}} at [[Shaw's Bridge]] on 12 July 1983.<ref name="Met Office">{{cite web| title = Climate: Northern Ireland | publisher = Met Office | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/regional-climates/ni | access-date = 25 May 2007}}</ref>

Belfast expanded very rapidly from being a market town to becoming an industrial city during the course of the 19th century. Because of this, it is less an agglomeration of villages and towns which have expanded into each other, than other comparable cities, such as [[Manchester]] or [[Birmingham]]. The city expanded to the natural barrier of the hills that surround it, overwhelming other settlements. Consequently, the arterial roads along which this expansion took place (such as the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]] or the [[Newtownards Road]]) are more significant in defining the districts of the city than nucleated settlements. Belfast remains segregated by walls, commonly known as "[[peace lines]]", erected by the [[British Army]] after August 1969, and which still divide 14 districts in the inner city.<ref name="Peacelines">{{Cite journal | author = Margrethe C.

[[File:Obel Tower completed.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|[[Obel Tower]] is the tallest building in Belfast and Ireland.]]

The architectural style of Belfast's public buildings range from a small set of [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] buildings, many examples of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], including the main ''Lanyon Building'' at [[Queen's University Belfast]] and the [[Linenhall Library]], (both designed by [[Charles Lanyon|Sir Charles Lanyon]]). There are also many examples of [[Edwardian Baroque architecture|Edwardian]], such as the City Hall, to modern, such as the [[Waterfront Hall]].

The City Hall was finished in 1906 and was built to reflect Belfast's city status, granted by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1888. The [[Edwardian Baroque architecture|Edwardian]] architectural style of Belfast City Hall influenced the [[Victoria Memorial (India)|Victoria Memorial]] in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], India, and [[Durban]] City Hall in South Africa.<ref>{{cite book | last = Krishna | first = Dutta | title = Calcutta: A Cultural and Literary History | page = 132 | publisher = Signal Books | url = https://books.google.com/?id=UKfoHi5412UC&pg=PA132 | year= 2003 | isbn = 978-1-902669-59-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/africa/25durban.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |title=Where the Road to Renaming Does Not Run Smooth |work=The New York Times |date=25 May 2006 |access-date=1 October 2007|author=Wines, Michael| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416052505/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/africa/25durban.html?_r=1&oref=slogin| archive-date=16 April 2009|url-status = live}}</ref> The dome is {{convert|173|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and figures above the door state "[[Hibernia]] encouraging and promoting the Commerce and Arts of the City".<ref name="Go To Historic Buildings">{{cite web| title = Historic Belfast: A guide to the City's landmark buildings | publisher = Go To Belfast | url = http://www.gotobelfast.com/index.cfm/level/page/category_key/197/Page_Key/428/Parent_Key/0/type/Page/PaGeName/Historic_Buildings_of_Belfast | access-date = 23 May 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070618164651/http://www.gotobelfast.com/index.cfm/level/page/category_key/197/Page_Key/428/Parent_Key/0/type/Page/PaGeName/Historic_Buildings_of_Belfast |archive-date = 18 June 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref>

[[Belfast Zoo]] is owned by Belfast City Council. The council spends £1.5&nbsp;million every year on running and promoting the zoo, which is one of the few local government-funded zoos in the UK and Ireland. The zoo is one of the top visitor attractions in Northern Ireland, receiving more than 295,000 visitors a year. The majority of the animals are in danger in their natural habitat. The zoo houses more than 1,200 animals of 140 species including [[Asian elephant]]s, [[Barbary lion]]s, [[Malayan sun bear]]s (one of the few in the United Kingdom), two species of penguin, a family of [[western lowland gorilla]]s, a troop of [[common chimpanzee]]s, a pair of [[red panda]]s, a pair of [[Goodfellow's tree-kangaroo]]s and [[Francois' langur]]s. The zoo also carries out important conservation work and takes part in European and international breeding programmes which help to ensure the survival of many species under threat.<ref>{{cite news|title=Parks and gardens |publisher=belfastzoo |date=1 April 2007 |url=http://www.belfastzoo.co.uk/aboutbelfastzoo/HistoryofBelfastZoo.aspx |access-date=16 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414005143/http://www.belfastzoo.co.uk/aboutbelfastzoo/HistoryofBelfastZoo.aspx |archive-date=14 April 2009 |url-status = live}}</ref>

As with many cities, Belfast's inner city is currently characterised by the elderly, students and single young people, while families tend to live on the periphery.

Despite a period of relative peace, most areas and districts of Belfast still reflect the divided nature of Northern Ireland as a whole.

More distant suburbs are served by [[Ulsterbus]]. [[Northern Ireland Railways]] provides [[Belfast Suburban Rail|suburban services]] along three lines running through Belfast's northern suburbs to [[Carrickfergus]], [[Larne]] and [[Larne Harbour railway station|Larne Harbour]], eastwards towards [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] and south-westwards towards [[Lisburn]] and [[Portadown railway station|Portadown]]. This service is known as the [[Belfast Suburban Rail]] system. Belfast is linked [[Belfast-Derry railway line|directly]] to [[Coleraine railway station|Coleraine]], [[Portrush railway station|Portrush]] and [[Londonderry railway station|Derry]]. Belfast has a direct rail connection with [[Dublin]] called ''[[Enterprise (train)|Enterprise]]'' which is operated jointly by NIR and [[Iarnród Éireann]], the state railway company of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. There are no rail services to cities in other countries of the United Kingdom, due to the [[Irish Sea fixed crossing|lack of a bridge or tunnel]] connecting [[Great Britain]] to the island of [[Ireland]]. There is, however, a combined ferry and rail ticket between Belfast and cities in Great Britain, which is referred to as ''Sailrail''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seat61.com/NorthernIreland.htm|title=London to Belfast by train & ferry from £55|website=Seat61.com|access-date=11 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909133736/https://www.seat61.com/NorthernIreland.htm|archive-date=9 September 2018|url-status = live}}</ref>

In April 2008, the [[Department for Regional Development]] reported on a plan for a light-rail system, similar to that in [[Dublin]]. The consultants said Belfast does not have the population to support a light rail system, suggesting that investment in bus-based rapid transit would be preferable. The study found that bus-based rapid transit produces positive economic results, but light rail does not. The report by Atkins & KPMG, however, said there would be the option of migrating to light rail in the future should the demand increase.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7330000/newsid_7336800/7336822.stm?bw=bb&mp=wm&news=1&bbcws=1 |title=video No light rail system for city |work=BBC News |date=8 April 2008 |access-date=30 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324203825/http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7330000/newsid_7336800/7336822.stm?bw=bb&mp=wm&news=1&bbcws=1 |archive-date=24 March 2012 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = City to get rapid transit network | work = BBC Northern Ireland | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7335313.stm| access-date = 4 April 2008 | date=8 April 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080409114158/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7335313.stm| archive-date= 9 April 2008 |url-status = live}}</ref>

The city has two airports: [[Belfast International Airport]] offering, domestic, European and international flights such as Orlando operated seasonally by [[Virgin Atlantic]]. The airport is located northwest of the city, near Lough Neagh, while the [[George Best Belfast City Airport]], which is closer to the city centre by train from [[Sydenham railway station, Northern Ireland|Sydenham]] on the [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] Line, adjacent to Belfast Lough, offers UK domestic flights and a few European flights. In 2005, Belfast International Airport was the 11th busiest commercial airport in the UK, accounting for just over 2% of all UK terminal passengers while the George Best Belfast City Airport was the 16th busiest and had 1% of UK terminal passengers. The Belfast – Liverpool route is the busiest domestic flight route in the UK excluding London with 555,224 passengers in 2009. Over 2.2&nbsp;million passengers flew between Belfast and London in 2009.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency |title=Northern Ireland Transport Statistics Annual 2005–2006 |publisher=Department for Regional Development 555,224 passengers in 2009. |date=28 September 2006 |url=http://www.drdni.gov.uk/statistic-details.htm?publication_id=170 |format=PDF |access-date=2 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519124540/http://www.drdni.gov.uk/statistic-details.htm?publication_id=170 |archive-date=19 May 2007 |url-status = dead}}</ref>

Belfast has a large [[Port of Belfast|port]] used for exporting and importing goods, and for passenger ferry services. [[Stena Line]] runs regular routes to [[Cairnryan]] in Scotland using its conventional vessels—with a crossing time of around 2 hours 15 minutes. Until 2011 the route went to [[Stranraer]] and used inter alia a HSS (High Speed Service) vessel—with a crossing time of around 90 minutes. Stena Line also operates a route to [[Liverpool]]. A seasonal sailing to [[Douglas, Isle of Man]] is operated by the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet|Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]].

The [[Glider (Belfast)|Glider]] bus service is a new form of transport in Belfast. Introduced in 2018, it is a rapid transit system linking East Belfast, West Belfast and the Titanic Quarter from the City Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.infrastructure-ni.gov.uk/articles/belfast-rapid-transit-glider-introduction|website=Infrastructure-ni.gov.uk|access-date=15 May 2018|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515141539/https://www.infrastructure-ni.gov.uk/articles/belfast-rapid-transit-glider-introduction|archive-date=15 May 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Using [[articulated buses]], the £90&nbsp;million service saw a 17% increase in its first month in Belfast, with 30,000 more people using the Gliders every week.

Belfast's population is evenly split between its Protestant and Catholic residents.<ref name="Belfast Urban Area"/> These two distinct cultural communities have both contributed significantly to the city's culture. Throughout the Troubles, Belfast artists continued to express themselves through poetry, art and music.

Belfast has the highest concentration of Irish-speakers in Northern Ireland. Like all areas of the island of Ireland outside of the [[Gaeltacht]], the Irish language in Belfast is not that of an unbroken intergenerational transmission. Due to community activity in the 1960s, including the establishment of the [[Shaw's Road|Shaw's Road Gaeltacht]] community, the expanse in the Irish language arts, and the advancements made in the availability of Irish medium education throughout the city, it can now be said that there is a 'mother-tongue' community of speakers.{{Dubious|date=November 2010}} The language is heavily promoted in the city and is particularly visible in the Falls Road area, where the signs on both the iconic black taxis and on the public buses are bilingual.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forbairtfeirste.com/forbairt-news/comharthai-bus-gaeilge-san-iarthar-irish-language-bus-signs-in-the-west/ |title=ComharthaÃ Bus Gaeilge san Iarthar / Irish language bus signs in the West &#124; Here comes the new Belfast |publisher=Forbairtfeirste.com |access-date=2 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227211258/http://www.forbairtfeirste.com/forbairt-news/comharthai-bus-gaeilge-san-iarthar-irish-language-bus-signs-in-the-west/ |archive-date=27 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Projects to promote the language in the city are funded by various sources, notably [[Foras na Gaeilge]], an all-Ireland body funded by both the Irish and British governments.

The provision of certain resources for these schools (for example, such as the provision of textbooks) is supported by the charitable organisation TACA.

In late August 2018, at least three groups were vying for the right to purchase the 5,500 [[RMS Titanic]] relics that were an asset of the bankrupt [[Premier Exhibitions]].
