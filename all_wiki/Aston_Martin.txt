== History ==

===Founding===
Aston Martin was founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin and [[Robert Bamford]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astonmartin.com/the-company/history |title=Company History 1913 – 1920 |publisher=Astonmartin.com |access-date=23 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225062127/http://www.astonmartin.com/the-company/history |archive-date=25 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The two had joined forces as Bamford & Martin the previous year to sell cars made by [[Singer (car)|Singer]] from premises in Callow Street, London where they also serviced [[GWK (car)|GWK]] and [[Calthorpe cars|Calthorpe]] vehicles. Martin raced specials at [[Aston Clinton Hillclimb|Aston Hill]] near [[Aston Clinton]], and the pair decided to make their own vehicles.<ref>{{cite journal|first=E.M. |last=Inman-Hunter |title=Notes on the Original Aston-Martin Company |journal=Motor Sport |date=May 1944 |page= 92 }}</ref> The first car to be named ''Aston Martin'' was created by Martin by fitting a four-cylinder [[Coventry-Simplex]] engine to the chassis of a 1908 [[Isotta Fraschini]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Aston Martin: Car Manufacturer: Great British Design Quest |url=http://www.designmuseum.org/design/aston-martin |publisher=Design Museum |accessdate=23 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701055155/http://designmuseum.org/design/aston-martin |archivedate= 1 July 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.speedace.info/aston_martin.htm |title= Aston martin 1914–2005 |work= speedace.info |accessdate= 23 August 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081228110146/http://www.speedace.info/aston_martin.htm |archive-date= 28 December 2008 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

They acquired premises at Henniker Mews<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.lurotbrand.co.uk/images/mewsnews/MN%202009%2001%20Spring.pdf |title=Henniker Mews, SW3 |journal=Mews News |page=3 |publisher=Lurot Brand |date=Spring 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> in [[Kensington]] and produced their first car in March 1915. Production could not start because of the outbreak of the [[World War I|first World War]], and Martin joined the [[Admiralty]] and Bamford joined the [[Royal Army Service Corps|Army Service Corps]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29337|page=10477|supp=y|date=22 October 1915}}</ref>

=== Inter–war years ===

After the war they found new premises at Abingdon Road, Kensington and designed a new car. Bamford left in 1920 and Bamford & Martin was revitalised with funding from [[Count Louis Zborowski]]. In 1922, Bamford & Martin produced cars to compete in the [[French Grand Prix]], which went on to set world speed and endurance records at [[Brooklands]]. Three works Team Cars with 16-valve twin cam engines were built for racing and record-breaking: chassis number 1914, later developed as the Green Pea; chassis number 1915, the [[Razor Blade]] record car; and chassis number 1916, later developed as the [[Halford Special]].<ref>The AM Halford Special, The First Five Years, AM Quarterly, Volume 19 Number 77, Summer 1981.</ref>

Approximately 55 cars were built for sale in two configurations; long chassis and short chassis. Bamford & Martin went bankrupt in 1924 and was bought by [[Godfrey Benson, 1st Baron Charnwood#Family|Dorothea, Lady Charnwood]] who put her son John Benson on the board. Bamford & Martin got into financial difficulty again in 1925 and Martin was forced to sell the company (Bamford had already left).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zonQCwAAQBAJ&q=Aston+Martin+Bankrupt+1926&pg=PT718|title=The Singer Story|first= Kevin |last= Atkinson|publisher=Veloce Publishing|year=2007|isbn=978-1874105527}}</ref>

Later that year, Bill Renwick, [[A C Bertelli|Augustus (Bert) Bertelli]] and investors including Lady Charnwood took control of the business. They renamed it Aston Martin Motors and moved it to the former [[General Aircraft Limited#History|Whitehead Aircraft Limited]] [[Hanworth]] works in [[Feltham]]. Renwick and Bertelli had been in partnership some years and had developed an overhead-cam four-cylinder engine using Renwick's patented combustion chamber design, which they had tested in an [[Enfield-Allday]] chassis. The only "Renwick and Bertelli" motor car made, it was known as "Buzzbox" and still survives.<ref name=bertelli>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecuriebertelli.com/amhto1932.html|title=Pre-war Aston Martin, Birth to 1932|publisher=Ecurie Bertelli|accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref>

The pair had planned to sell their engine to motor manufacturers, but having heard that Aston Martin was no longer in production realised they could capitalise on its reputation to jump-start the production of a completely new car.<ref name=bertelli/>

Between 1926 and 1937 Bertelli was both technical director and designer of all new Aston Martins, since known as "Bertelli cars". They included the 1½-litre "T-type", "International", "Le Mans", "MKII" and its racing derivative, the "Ulster", and the 2-litre 15/98 and its racing derivative, the "Speed Model". Most were open two-seater sports cars bodied by Bert Bertelli's brother [[commons:Category:Bertelli coachwork|Enrico (Harry)]], with a small number of long-chassis four-seater tourers, dropheads and saloons also produced.<ref name=bertelli/>

Bertelli was a competent driver keen to race his cars, one of few owner/manufacturer/drivers. The "LM" team cars were very successful in national and international motor racing including at Le Mans.<ref name=bertelli/>

Financial problems reappeared in 1932. Aston Martin was rescued for a year by [[Aston Martin Owners Club|Lance Prideaux Brune]] before passing it on to [[Arthur Sutherland|Sir Arthur Sutherland]]. In 1936, Aston Martin decided to concentrate on road cars, producing just 700 until [[World War II]] halted work. Production shifted to aircraft components during the war.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.osv.ltd.uk/brief-history-of-aston-martin/|title=A Brief History of Aston Martin {{!}} OSV {{!}} Learning Centre|date=10 November 2017|work=OSV|access-date=9 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://astrumpeople.com/lionel-martin-biography-a-great-history-of-aston-martin-cars/|title=Lionel Martin Biography: A Great History of Aston Martin Cars|work=Astrum People|access-date=9 September 2018}}</ref>

=== 1947–1972: David Brown ===
[[File:1958-aston-martin-archives.jpg|thumb|1958 [[Aston Martin DB Mark III]]]]

In 1947, old-established (1860) privately owned [[Huddersfield]] [[gear]] and [[machine tools]] manufacturer [[David Brown Limited]] bought Aston Martin putting it under control of its Tractor Group. David Brown became Aston Martin's latest saviour.<ref>The David Brown Corporation Limited (Incorporated under the Companies Act. 1948.) ''The Times'', Monday, 12 March 1951; pg. 9; Issue 51947.</ref> He also acquired without its factory [[Lagonda]]'s business<ref>The New Lagonda Car. ''The Times'', Saturday, 20 September 1947; pg. 3; Issue 50871</ref> for its 2.6-litre [[W. O. Bentley]]-designed engine. Lagonda moved operations to Newport Pagnell and shared engines, resources and workshops. Aston Martin began to build the classic "DB" series of cars.<ref name=cct>{{cite web|url=https://classiccartrust.com/news/2017/01/70-years-of-aston-martin-dbs-david-brown-and-his-cars/|title=70 years of Aston Martin DBs: David Brown and his cars|publisher=Classic Car Trust|accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref>

In April 1950, they announced planned production of their Le Mans prototype to be called the [[Aston Martin DB2|DB2]],<ref>The 2½-Litre Aston-Martin. ''The Times'', Tuesday, 25 April 1950; pg. 3; Issue 51674.</ref> followed by the [[Aston Martin DB2/4|DB2/4]] in 1953, the [[Aston Martin DB2/4|DB2/4 MkII]] in 1955, the [[Aston Martin DB Mark III|DB Mark III]] in 1957 and the Italian-styled 3.7&nbsp;L [[Aston Martin DB4|DB4]] in 1958.<ref name=cct/>

While these models helped Aston Martin establish a good racing pedigree, the [[Aston Martin DB4|DB4]] stood out and yielded the famous [[Aston Martin DB5|DB5]] in 1963. Aston stayed true to its [[Grand tourer|grand touring]] style with the [[Aston Martin DB6|DB6]] (1965–70), and [[Aston Martin DBS|DBS]] (1967–1972).<ref name=cct/>

The six-cylinder engines of these cars from 1954 up to 1965 were designed by [[Tadek Marek]].<ref>''Classic Cars: The World's Greatest Marques'' {{ISBN|978-0-785-81694-2}} p. 29</ref>

=== 1972–1975: William Willson ===
[[File:1986 Aston Martin V580 engine from the rear.jpg|thumb|The Tadek Marek-designed V8 engine was a mainstay of the Aston Martin lineup for decades, and was built from 1969 until 2000.]]

Aston Martin was often financially troubled. In 1972, David Brown paid off all its debts, said to be £5&nbsp;million or more, and handed it for £101 to Company Developments, a [[Birmingham]]-based investment bank consortium chaired by accountant [[William Willson (businessman)|William Willson]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=News and Comment: Aston Martin changes hands |volume=136 |journal=Autocar |issue=3960 |page=2 |date=9 March 1972}}</ref> More detail on this period may be read at [[William Willson (businessman)|Willson's biography]]. The [[1973–75 recession#United Kingdom|worldwide recession]], lack of [[working capital]] and the difficulties of developing an engine to meet [[California Smog Check Program|California's exhaust emission]] requirements – it stopped the company's US sales – again pulled Aston Martin into receivership at the end of 1974. The company had employed 460 workers when the manufacturing plant closed.<ref name=TT59502>Receiver is called in at Jensen Motors. ''The Times'', Tuesday, 16 September 1975; pg. 17; Issue 59502</ref>

=== 1975–1981: Sprague and Curtis ===
The receiver sold the business in April 1975 for £1.05&nbsp;million to North American businessmen Peter Sprague of [[National Semiconductor#The transformation of National Semiconductor|National Semiconductor]] and Toronto hotelier, George Minden,<ref name=Car197809>{{cite journal| first=Mel |last=Nicols| title = The Aston Miracle| journal=Car Magazine| pages=35–362 |date=September 1978}}</ref> and Jeremy Turner, a London businessman,<ref>Aston Martin bid final, consortium says. ''The Times'', Friday, 4 April 1975; pg. 19; Issue 59361</ref> who insisted to reporters Aston Martin remained a British controlled business. Sprague later claimed he had fallen in love with the factory, not the cars, the workforce's craftsmanship dedication and intelligence. At this point, he and Minden had brought in investor, Alan Curtis, a British office property developer together with George Flather, a retired Sheffield [[steel magnate]].<ref name=TT60284>Lagonda sets out on a new course. ''The Times'', Monday, 24 April 1978; pg. 18; Issue 60284</ref>

Six months later, in September 1975, the factory – shut-down the previous December – re-opened under its new owner as Aston Martin Lagonda Limited with 100 employees and plans to lift staff to 250 by the end of 1975.<ref name=TT59502/> In January 1976, AML revealed that it now held orders for 150 cars for US, 100 for other markets and another 80 from a Japanese importing agency.<ref>Aston Martin Revival. ''The Times'', Saturday, 10 January 1976; pg. 17; Issue 59598</ref> At the [[Geneva Motor Show]], Fred Hartley, managing director and sales director for 13 years before that, announced he had resigned over "differences in marketing policy".<ref>On the Move. ''The Times'', Wednesday, 16 March 1977; pg. 21; Issue 59953</ref>

The new owners pushed Aston Martin into modernising its line, introducing the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (1977)|V8 Vantage]] in 1977, the convertible [[Aston Martin V8|Volante]] in 1978, and the one-off [[Aston Martin Bulldog|Bulldog]] styled by [[William Towns]] in 1980. Towns also styled the futuristic new [[Aston Martin Lagonda|Lagonda]] saloon, based on the V8 model.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hagertyinsurance.co.uk/price-guide/1980-Aston_Martin-Lagonda|title=1980 Aston Martin Lagonda|publisher=Hagerty Insurance|accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref>

Curtis, who had a 42% stake in Aston Martin,<ref>Consortium puts in its bid for MG. ''The Times'', Friday, 25 January 1980; pg. 17; Issue 60533</ref> also brought about a change in direction from the usual customers who were Aston Martin fanatics (fans) to successful young married businessmen. Prices had been increased by 25%.<ref name=TT60284/> There was speculation that AML was about to buy Italian automobile manufacturer [[Lamborghini]].<ref>August car sales may hit peak. ''The Times'', Friday, 18 August 1978; pg. 16; Issue 60383</ref> At the end of the 1970s, there was widespread debate about running MG into the Aston Martin consortium. 85 Tory MPs formed themselves into a pressure group to get British Leyland to release their grip and hand it over.<ref>Sell MG to Aston Martin, MPs say. ''The Times'', Tuesday, 27 November 1979; pg. 16; Issue 60485</ref> CH Industrials plc (car components) bought a 10% share in AML. But in July 1980, blaming a recession, AML cut back their workforce of 450 by more than 20% making those people redundant.<ref>''The Times'', Tuesday, 1 July 1980; pg. 17; Issue 60665</ref>

=== 1981–1991: Victor Gauntlett ===
In January 1981, there having been no satisfactory revival partners, Alan Curtis and Peter Sprague announced they had never intended to maintain a long-term financial stake in Aston Martin Lagonda and it was to be sold to [[Pace Petroleum]]'s [[Victor Gauntlett]]. Sprague and Curtis pointed out that under their ownership AML finances had improved to where an offer for MG might have been feasible.<ref>Petrol chief takes over Aston Martin. ''The Times'', Monday, 5 January 1981; pg. 15; Issue 60817.</ref>

Gauntlett bought a 12.5% stake in Aston Martin for £500,000 via [[Pace Petroleum]] in 1980, with Tim Hearley of CH Industrials taking a similar share. Pace and CHI took over as joint 50/50 owners at the beginning of 1981, with Gauntlett as executive chairman. Gauntlett also led the sales team, and after some development and publicity when the [[Aston Martin Lagonda|Lagonda]] became the world's fastest four-seater production car, was able to sell the car in Oman, Kuwait, and Qatar.<ref name=VGOBIT>{{cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030409/ai_n12682539|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080203121039/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030409/ai_n12682539|url-status= dead|archive-date= 3 February 2008|title= Obituary: Victor Gauntlett |newspaper=The Independent (London) |accessdate=3 February 2008 }}</ref>

In 1982, Aston Martin was granted a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant of Appointment]] by the [[Prince of Wales]].<ref name = warrant/>

Understanding that it would take some time to develop new Aston Martin products, they created an engineering service subsidiary to develop automotive products for other companies. It was decided to use a trade name of Salmons & Son, their in-house coachbuilder, [[Tickford]] which Aston Martin had bought in 1955. Tickford's name had been long associated with expensive high-quality carriages and cars along with their folding roofs. New products included a Tickford [[Austin Metro]], a Tickford [[Ford Capri]] and even Tickford train interiors, particularly on the [[Jaguar XJS]].<ref name=VGOBIT/> Pace continued sponsoring racing events, and now sponsored all Aston Martin Owners Club events, taking a Tickford-engined Nimrod Group C car owned by AMOC President [[Viscount Downe]], which came third in the Manufacturers Championship in both 1982 and 1983. It also finished seventh in the [[1982 24 Hours of Le Mans]] race. However, sales of production cars were now at an all-time low of 30 cars produced in 1982.<ref name=VGOBIT/>

As trading became tighter in the petroleum market, and Aston Martin was requiring more time and money, Gauntlett agreed to sell Hays/Pace to the Kuwait Investment Office in September 1983. As Aston Martin required greater investment, he also agreed to sell his share holding to American importer and Greek shipping tycoon [[Peter Livanos]], who invested via his joint venture with Nick and John Papanicolaou, ALL Inc. Gauntlett remained chairman of AML, 55% of the stake was owned by ALL, with Tickford a 50/50 venture between ALL and CHI. The uneasy relationship was ended when ALL exercised options to buy a larger share in AML; CHI's residual shares were exchanged for CHI's complete ownership of Tickford, which retained the development of existing Aston Martin projects. In 1984, Papanicolaou's Titan shipping business was in trouble so Livanos's father George bought out the Papanicolaou's shares in ALL, while Gauntlett again became a shareholder with a 25% holding in AML. The deal valued Aston Martin/AML at £2&nbsp;million, the year it built its 10,000th car.<ref name=VGOBIT/>

Although as a result Aston Martin had to make 60 members of the workforce redundant, Gauntlett bought a stake in Italian styling house [[Zagato]], and resurrected its collaboration with Aston Martin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1120288_aston-martin-shows-off-vanquish-zagato-shooting-brakes-interior|title=Aston Martin shows off Vanquish Zagato shooting brake's interior|publisher=Motor Authority|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Aston Martin Volante.jpg|right|thumb|Aston Martin V8 Vantage from ''[[The Living Daylights]]'']]
In 1986, Gauntlett negotiated the return of the fictional British secret agent [[James Bond]] to Aston Martin. [[Cubby Broccoli]] had chosen to recast the character using actor [[Timothy Dalton]], in an attempt to re-root the Bond-brand back to a more [[Sean Connery]]-like feel. Gauntlett supplied his personal pre-production Vantage for use in the filming of ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', and sold a Volante to Broccoli for use at his home in America. Gauntlett turned down the role of a [[KGB]] colonel in the film, however: "I would have loved to have done it but really could not afford the time."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thegoldengun.co.uk/tld/tldpress.html |title=TLD – Press (Allies/MI6) |publisher=thegoldengun.co.uk |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080513082305/http://www.thegoldengun.co.uk/tld/tldpress.html |archivedate=13 May 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>

Aston Martin needed funds to survive in the long term. In May 1987, Gauntlett and [[Prince Michael of Kent]] were staying at the home of Contessa Maggi, the wife of the founder of the original [[Mille Miglia]], while watching the revival event. Another house guest was [[Walter Hayes]], vice-president of [[Ford of Europe]].

Although Gauntlett was contractually to stay as chairman for two years, his racing interests took the company back into sports car racing in 1989 with limited European success. However, with engine rule changes for the 1990 season and the launch of the new Volante model, Ford provided the limited supply of [[Cosworth]] engines to the [[Jaguar cars]] racing team. As the entry-level [[Aston Martin DB7|DB7]] would require a large engineering input, Ford agreed to take full control of Aston Martin, and Gauntlett handed over Aston Martin's chairmanship to Hayes in 1991.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/13/1050172472030.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Keeping the best of British running | date=14 April 2003}}</ref> In 1992, the high-performance variant of the Virage called the [[Aston Martin Virage#Vantage|Vantage]] was announced, and the following year Aston Martin renewed the DB range by announcing the DB7.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalautomobileclub.co.uk/motoring/rotunda-cars/aston-martin-db7-1993|title=Aston Martin DB7 1993|publisher=Royal Automobile Club|accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref>

=== 1991–2007: Ford Motor Company ===
Ford placed Aston Martin in the [[Premier Automotive Group]], invested in new manufacturing and ramped up production. In 1994, Ford opened a new factory at Banbury Road in [[Bloxham]] to manufacture the DB7. In 1995, Aston Martin produced a record 700 cars. Until the Ford era, cars had been produced by hand coachbuilding craft methods, such as the [[English wheel]]. In 1998, the 2,000th DB7 was built, and in 2002, the 6,000th, exceeding production of all of the previous DB series models. The DB7 range was revamped by the addition of more powerful [[Aston Martin DB7|V12 Vantage]] models in 1999, and in 2001, Aston Martin introduced the V12-engined flagship model called the [[Aston Martin Vanquish|Vanquish]] which succeeded the aging Virage (now called the V8 Coupé).<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/car-reviews/aston-martin/vanquish/vanquish-2001-2007 |title= Aston Martin Vanquish (2001–2007) used car review |publisher=RAC |accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref>

At the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan in 2003, Aston Martin introduced the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2005)|AMV8 Vantage]] concept car. Expected to have few changes before its introduction in 2005, the Vantage brought back the classic V8 engine to allow Aston Martin to compete in a larger market. 2003 also saw the opening of the [[Gaydon]] factory, the first purpose-built factory in Aston Martin's history. The facility sits on a 22-hectare (55-acre) site of a former [[RAF]] [[V Bomber]] [[RAF Gaydon|airbase]], with an {{convert|8000|m2}} front building for offices, meeting rooms and customer reception, and a {{convert|35000|m2}} production building.<ref name= "aml gaydon"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sdc.co.uk/portfolio/lagonda-facility/|title=ASTON MARTIN LAGONDA HQ, GAYDON|work=SDC|access-date=12 June 2020}}</ref> Also introduced in 2003 was the [[Aston Martin DB9|DB9]] coupé, which replaced the ten-year-old [[Aston Martin DB7|DB7]].

In October 2004, Aston Martin set up the dedicated {{convert|12500|m2}} [[Aston Martin Engine Plant|AMEP]] engine production plant within the [[Ford Germany]] [[Niehl, Cologne]] plant. With the capacity to produce up to 5,000 engines a year by 100 specially trained personnel, like traditional Aston Martin engine production from Newport Pagnell, assembly of each unit was entrusted to a single technician from a pool of 30, with V8 and V12 variants assembled in under 20 hours. By bringing engine production back to within Aston Martin, the promise was that Aston Martin would be able to produce small runs of higher performance variants' engines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astonmartins.com/factory/amep.htm |title=Aston Martin s . com – Aston Martin Engine Plant Cologne |publisher=Astonmartins.com |accessdate=3 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012035826/http://astonmartins.com/factory/amep.htm |archivedate=12 October 2011 }}</ref> This expanded engine capacity allowed the entry-level [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2005)|V8 Vantage]] sports car to enter production at the Gaydon factory in 2006, joining the DB9 and DB9 Volante.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/car-reviews/aston-martin/vantage/vantage-2006-2017/|title=Aston Martin Vantage (2006–2017) used car review|publisher=RAC|accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref>

In December 2003, Aston Martin announced it would return to motor racing in 2005. A new division was created, called [[Aston Martin Racing]], which became responsible, together with [[Prodrive]], for the design, development, and management of the DBR9 program. The DBR9 competes in the GT class in [[sports car racing|sports car races]], including the world-famous [[24 Hours of Le Mans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/in/lemans/photos/aston-martin-racing-aston-martin-14/16586770/|title=Aston Martin Racing Aston Martin DBR9|work=Motor Sport|date=30 May 2018|accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref>

In 2006, an internal audit led Ford to consider divesting itself of parts of its [[Premier Automotive Group]]. After suggestions of selling [[Jaguar Cars]], [[Land Rover]], or [[Volvo Cars]] were weighed, Ford announced in August 2006 it had engaged [[UBS AG]] to sell all or part of Aston Martin at auction.<ref>{{cite web |last=Martinez |first=James |url=http://www.motorauthority.com/cars/aston-martin/aston-martin-the-past-the-present-and-tomorrow/ |publisher=Motor Authority |title=Ford confirms Aston Martin is for sale |date=31 August 2006 |accessdate=23 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521091102/http://www.motorauthority.com/cars/aston-martin/aston-martin-the-past-the-present-and-tomorrow/ |archive-date=21 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In January 2020, it was announced that the [[Racing Point F1 Team]] is due to be rebranded as Aston Martin for the [[2021 Formula One World Championship|2021 season]], as a result of a funding investment led by [[Racing Point UK|Racing Point]] owner [[Lawrence Stroll]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.racing-point-set-to-become-aston-martin-racing-for-2021.2YwShWhMbZr2NK1M4Q1nMn.html|title=Racing Point set to become Aston Martin works team for 2021|date=31 January 2020|publisher=Formula One|accessdate=2 February 2020}}</ref>
