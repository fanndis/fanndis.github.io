He was also a ‘walk On’ with the varsity lacrosse and soccer teams.<ref name=CNN />

While at North Carolina State, studying physics and chemistry, he took a TV and radio course. Tesh worked part-time reading later the news for [[Rick Dees]] at [[WKIX-FM]]-Raleigh in 1974. His roommate, [[Bill Leslie (journalist)|Bill Leslie]], anchor at [[WRAL-TV]], helped him get into the radio and TV field.<ref name="auto"/> While in the area, Tesh worked as a news anchor in Raleigh, Orlando, Nashville, then moving to [[WCBS-TV]] in New York; this portion of his career spanned 12 years.<ref name="auto"/>

==Career==
===''Entertainment Tonight'' and television career===
His television career included a stint as a news anchor and reporter at [[WSMV-TV|WSM-TV]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in the 1970s, where he often covered the same stories as [[Oprah Winfrey]], who worked at [[WTVF-TV|a competing Nashville station]]. He shuffled from Nashville to [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and finally to New York's [[WCBS-TV]], where, at age 22, he was their youngest reporter.<ref name="bio"/> However, he became more well-known when he co-hosted the television show ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' from 1986 to 1996.

Tesh also served as a sportscaster for [[CBS Sports|CBS]] and later [[NBC Sports|NBC]], anchoring events such as the [[Tour de France]] bicycle race from 1983 through 1986 (Tesh has the distinction of being the anchor for the first American broadcast of this event), the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], and gymnastics at the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] and [[1996 Summer Olympics]].

Tesh hosted the short-lived ''One on One with John Tesh'' talk show in 1991–92 on NBC daytime, and co-hosted the show ''[[Leeza|John & Leeza From Hollywood]]'' with fellow ''Entertainment Tonight'' personality [[Leeza Gibbons]] from 1993–94, also on NBC daytime. In 2014, Tesh returned to syndicated television in the series ''Intelligence for Your Life TV'', based on his radio show.<ref name=IntelTV>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/intelligence-for-your-life-tv-to-launch-on-september-15-2014-set-to-air-on-130-stations-into-83-of-us-homes-269044301.html|title="Intelligence For Your Life" TV To Launch On September 15, 2014, Set To Air On 130 Stations Into 83% Of U.S. Homes|website=Prnewswire.com}}</ref>

===Musical career===
In 1987, [[Yanni]] was putting together his first touring band to promote his album ''[[Out of Silence (Yanni album)|Out of Silence]]'', as well as selections from ''[[Keys to Imagination]]''. Being good friends, Tesh asked Yanni if he could join the band as keyboardist along with [[Giovanna Joyce Imbesi|Joyce Imbesi]] and drummer [[Charlie Adams (drummer)|Charlie Adams]], as he'd never been onstage for a live performance, and he needed the experience. Despite already having a full-time job with ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', and the long hours of rehearsal for the band, he did very well, although he did only one tour with Yanni, playing in about 12 shows, including the "[[Chameleon Days|1988 Concert Series]]", before being replaced by [[Bradley Joseph]]. Later, Yanni helped Tesh get his first recording contract with [[Private Music]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Yanni |author2 = Rensin, David |title = Yanni in Words |publisher = Miramax Books |year = 2002 |pages = [https://archive.org/details/yanniinwords00yann/page/123 123, 202] |isbn = 1-4013-5194-8 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/yanniinwords00yann/page/123 }}</ref>

In the 1990s, John Tesh was credited with the theme music to ''[[Bobby's World]]'', hosted by Howie Mandel, and the ''[[NBA on NBC]]'' theme, known as "[[Roundball Rock]]". Tesh composed the ''NBA on NBC'' theme after an idea hit him while traveling. In order to recall his idea at a later juncture, Tesh recorded the initial beat vocally on his answering machine, by ringing his home phone and leaving a message for himself.<ref>{{cite web |last = Gayomali |first = Chris |url = http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/05/26/watch-how-john-tesh-wrote-the-nbas-iconic-theme-song/ |title = Watch: How John Tesh Wrote the NBA's Iconic Theme Song |website=Newsfeed.time.com |date = May 26, 2011 |accessdate = March 12, 2013 }}</ref> The theme was used for the ''NBA on NBC'' before the network stopped carrying NBA games following the [[2001-02 NBA season|2001–02 season]] (as well as an [[electric guitar]]-driven spinoff that was used on NBC's [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] telecasts from [[1997 WNBA season|1997]] to [[2002 WNBA season|2002]]), though NBC would revive the theme for its basketball coverage during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. Tesh would later license the song to [[Fox Sports]] for its [[Fox College Hoops|college basketball coverage]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/12/fox-sports-roundball-rock-nba-on-nbc-theme-john-tesh-video|title=Fox Sports is bringing John Tesh's iconic 'Roundball Rock' back to basketball broadcasts|website=For The Win|language=en|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>

In August 1994, John performed at the [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] in Morrison, Colorado, for his first ''Live at Red Rocks'' concert. Tesh performed with conductor [[John Bisharat]] and the 70-piece Colorado Symphony Orchestra. The concert featured Tesh playing grand piano, [[Charlie Bisharat]] playing electric violin, and [[Everette Harp]] playing alto saxophone. Also featured were Olympic gold medal-gymnasts [[Nadia Comaneci]] (1976) and [[Bart Conner]] (1984) performing gymnastic routines specially-choreographed to Tesh's music.

After Tesh left his ten-year job as co-host for ''Entertainment Tonight'' in 1996, he turned to his career as a contemporary keyboardist. This led to him starting ''The John Tesh Radio Show'' in 2003.

In 2008, he put out a piano gospel dance DVD called ''Alive: Music & Dance''. It combines Tesh's music, big gospel choirs, and hip-hop dance.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130130213323/http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/14/154536.shtml John Tesh Finds His Groove].

===''John Tesh Radio Show'' and spin-offs===
Tesh currently has a nationally [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] radio show called the ''John Tesh Radio Show'', which typically airs on [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]], [[classic hits]], Christian and [[soft rock]] radio formats. The music is interspersed with various [[factoid]]s and other information Tesh considers useful to listeners, often with topics such as health and well-being.<ref name="auto"/>

These factoids are called "Intelligence for Your Life", played on radio stations across the United States and Canada, and the [[Armed Forces Network]]. Select pieces of "Intelligence for Your Life" are broken up and distributed in vignette form to other radio stations (including [[talk radio]] formats) and for use on morning shows. There is also a three-hour weekend show, "Intelligence for Your Health", launched in 2010, hosted by [[Connie Sellecca]].<ref name="auto1">{{cite web |url=http://radioink.com/2016/04/27/john-tesh-and-connie-sellecca-radios-intelligence-family/ |title=John Tesh and Connie Sellecca |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=April 2016 |website=Radioink.com|access-date=February 26, 2017}}</ref>

Across all of its versions, Tesh's radio programs reach listeners across the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom, placing it on the [[list of most-listened-to radio programs]]. Tesh's main rival is ''[[Delilah (radio show)|Delilah]]'', and these two shows are sometimes aired in the same market on competing stations.

The show started as a weekend show in 2000 on Clear Channel’s KKDJ-FM/Bakersfield and then a few other stations, expanding to a daily version in 2003. The program was originally syndicated by [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]] under the name ''On the Air with John Tesh'', albeit with a slightly different format. It is produced by Tesh with a staff of 35 and still distributed by syndicator Westwood One.<ref name="auto1"/> In September 2016, the partnership with Westwood One was renewed in a new multi-year agreement. At the time, Westwood One indicated that it was airing on 280 radio stations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westwoodone.com/LEARN-MORE/Press/Intelligence-For-Your-Life-with-John-Tesh-Connie-Sellecca-and-Gib-Gerard-Extend-Partnership-with-Westwood-One |title=MULTI-YEAR AGREEMENT FOR "INTELLIGENCE FOR YOUR LIFE" RADIO AND WESTWOOD ONE |last=Polsky |first=Jana |date=September 26, 2016 |website=Westwoodone.com|access-date=February 26, 2017 |quote=Westwood One and Intelligence For Your Life with John Tesh, Connie Sellecca and Gib Gerard has renewed their partnership in a new multi-year agreement that will bring the Intelligence for your Life radio programs ... Westwood One has exclusively represented the programs for 15 years.}}</ref>

In late 2014, a television version of these factoids, ''Intelligence for Your Life TV'', debuted in syndication to local stations. In April 2016, the TV program was seen on 174 stations. The series also features health segments hosted by his wife, Connie Sellecca, based on her own radio program, "Intelligence for Your Health".<ref name=IntelTV/>

Tesh also authored a book, ''Intelligence for Your Life: Powerful Lessons for Personal Growth'', in 2008, reprinted in 2012 ({{ISBN|0849964636}}, publisher Thomas Nelson).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2256360.Intelligence_for_Your_Life |title=for Your Life: Powerful Lessons for Personal Growth |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2016 |website=Goodreads |publisher=Goodreads Inc. |access-date=February 26, 2017}}</ref>
