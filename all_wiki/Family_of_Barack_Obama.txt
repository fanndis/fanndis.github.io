[[File:Family of Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|Marian Robinson (second from right) makes an appearance with the rest of the immediate family of Barack Obama on the [[Blue Room (White House)|South Portico]] of the White House during festivities of the 2009 [[White House Easter Egg Roll]]]]
Barack Obama has called his wife [[Michelle Obama]] "the most quintessentially American woman I know."<ref name="soil"/> Her family is of African-American heritage, descendants of Africans and Europeans of the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial era]] and [[Antebellum United States|antebellum]] eras.<ref name="soil"/> Michelle Obama's family history traces from colonists and [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in the South to [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] to the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to northern cities, in her family's case, Cleveland and Chicago. Each of her four grandparents was multiracial.<ref name="swarns">[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/us/dna-gives-new-insights-into-michelle-obamas-roots.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& Rachel L. Swarns, "Meet Your Cousin, the First Lady: A Family Story, Long Hidden"], ''The New York Times'', June 16, 2012</ref> Some of Michelle's relatives still reside in [[South Carolina]]. Extended family from her mother's Shields ancestors also reside in Georgia and throughout the South.

==={{Anchor|Jim Robinson}}Jim Robinson===
Michelle's earliest known relative on her father's side is her great-great grandfather Jim Robinson, born in the 1850s, who was an American [[slavery|slave]] on the [[Friendfield Plantation]] in [[Georgetown, South Carolina]] in the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Low Country]], where African Americans developed as the [[Gullah people]] and culture. The family believes that after the Civil War, he worked as a Friendfield [[sharecropper]] for the rest of his life. He is said to have been buried there in an unmarked grave.<ref name="soil"/>

Jim married twice, first to a woman named Louiser, with whom he had two sons, Gabriel and Fraser, Michelle Obama's great-grandfather. A daughter was born to the family, but her name has not been discovered, and she is believed to have died as a child. His second marriage to Rose Ella Cohen produced six more children. Fraser had an arm amputated as a result of a boyhood injury. He worked as a shoemaker, a newspaper salesman, and in a lumber mill.<ref name="soil"/> Carrie Nelson, Gabriel Robinson's daughter, is the keeper of family lore and the oldest living Robinson at 80 years old in 2008.<ref name="soil"/>

At least three of Michelle Obama's great-uncles served in the [[military of the United States]]. One aunt moved to [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where she worked as a maid. She cooked [[Soul food|Southern-style meals]] for Michelle and her brother Craig, when they were students at [[Princeton University]].

==={{Anchor|Melvinia Shields}}Melvinia Shields===
The earliest known relative on her mother's side is her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields (1844-1938), who was held as a slave on a farm in [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton County, North Georgia]]. Her master was Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm near [[Rex, Georgia|Rex]]. He would have worked along with his slaves.<ref name="swarns"/> Melvinia became pregnant at about age 15 and had a biracial son, Dolphus T. Shields, born into slavery about 1860.

Charles later became a teacher and married a white woman. Michelle Obama's extended family has said that people didn't talk about slavery time while they were growing up.<ref name="swarns"/> Michelle Obama's distant ancestry also includes Irish and other European roots.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Produced by Meghan Louttit/The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/06/22/us/first-lady-family-q-and-a.html |title=The First Family: A New Glimpse of Michelle Obama's White Ancestors&nbsp;— Interactive Feature |location=Southern States (US) |work=The New York Times |date=June 22, 2012 |access-date=December 14, 2012}}</ref>
