===Connection to P. T. Barnum===
[[File:University of Bridgeport Bryant Hall.jpg|thumb|left|University of Bridgeport Bryant Hall.]]
[[File:University of Bridgeport Cortright Hall.jpg|thumb|right|University of Bridgeport Cortright Hall.]]
The stately old Victorian homes on campus date from the late 1800s to the early 1900s &ndash; some owned by leading area industrialists and some by family and friends of showman [[P. T. Barnum]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bridgeport.edu/welcome/locations/main-bridgeport-campus/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150819091153/http://www.bridgeport.edu/welcome/locations/main-bridgeport-campus |archive-date=2015-08-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The University has restored two of the homes, and done substantial work on a third. These homes, as well as a newer 1937 home in International style, form the Marina Park Historic District,<ref>{{Citation|title=National Register of Historic Places listings in Bridgeport, Connecticut|date=2018-04-19|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Bridgeport,_Connecticut&oldid=837260679|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-01-20}}</ref> which is on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Beginnings===
The University began in 1927 as the first junior (2 year) college in Connecticut. Founders E. Everett Cortright, Alfred Fones, and Sumner Simpson saw a need in Bridgeport, then one of only 6 American cities of more than 100,000 residents lacking a college or university. So, they began the Junior College of Connecticut. The school expanded significantly, adding dormitories, acquiring New Haven's Arnold College, and adding a School of Business. The school purchased the former P.T. Barnum estate and neighboring property adjacent to [[Seaside Park (Connecticut)|Seaside Park]], and became a four-year institution in 1947, when it was renamed the University of Bridgeport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bridgeport.edu/about/ub-history|title=The History of UB - University of Bridgeport|website=www.bridgeport.edu}}</ref>

===1947 to 1990===
The university continued to grow rapidly from 1947-1969, due to the increased number of people seeking to attend a U.S. college resulting from the [[baby boom]], [[Vietnam War]] veterans eligible for a higher education under the [[G.I. Bill]], and international students who wanted to attend college in the United States. Enrollment peaked at 9100 students in 1969, and an Ed.D. program in Educational Leadership was added in 1979.<ref>Schaffer, Robert ''Illustrated History of Bridgeport'' NY: Wislow Publishing, 1992, p. 52.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bridgeport.edu/welcome/history.aspx |title=- UB history |access-date=2012-05-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501045001/http://www.bridgeport.edu/welcome/history.aspx |archive-date=2013-05-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Enrollment declined throughout the 1970s and 1980s after the waves of baby boom and Vietnam era veterans eligible for the G.I. Bill declined. By 1990, the university had cut tuition, room and board fees to $18,000 per year, but enrollment continued to decline, due to the decreased birth rate, increased competition, and the then-high crime rate in the neighborhood. In 1990, more than a third of the 50 campus buildings were empty. To cut costs, the university decided to terminate 50 tenured faculty, and asked the other faculty to accept a 30% wage cut.<ref>Davey, Robert "Moon Over Bridgeport" ''Connecticut Magazine'' (July, 1994), p. 69</ref> In addition, the university decided to eliminate its liberal arts college, alienating many students.<ref name="eliminate">{{cite news | last =Judson | first =George | title =University To Eliminate Liberal Arts | work =[[The New York Times]] | page =B1 | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date =November 27, 1991 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/27/nyregion/university-to-eliminate-liberal-arts.html | accessdate = October 6, 2009}}</ref> This led to the longest faculty [[strike action|strike]] in the history of American higher education. Dr. Janet Greenwood, the president at the time, quit abruptly, and around 1,000 students left the school, contributing to the cash crisis.<ref name="nearsaccord">{{cite news | last =Judson | first =George | title =Bridgeport U.

===1990 to 2003===
In 1990, after severe endowment losses, discussion began about affiliating or possibly merging the university with either the [[University of New Haven]] or [[Sacred Heart University]].<ref name="merger">{{cite news | last =[[Associated Press]] | title =Merger of New Haven U. and Bridgeport Proposed | work =[[The New York Times]] | page =63, Section: 1 | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date =December 8, 1991 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/nyregion/merger-of-new-haven-u-and-bridgeport-proposed.html | accessdate = October 6, 2009 }}</ref>
The university was approached by the [[Professors World Peace Academy]] (PWPA), an affiliate of the [[Unification Church]], but its offer to bail out the university was spurned by the trustees who said the school was "not going to have anything to do with the offer" and were concerned that such an affiliation would damage the university's reputation.<ref name="eliminate"/><ref name="judson">{{cite news | last =Judson | first =George | title =Making the Hard Choice at Bridgeport U.: Opting to Stay Alive | work =[[The New York Times]] | page =B5 | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date = April 17, 1992 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/17/nyregion/making-the-hard-choice-at-bridgeport-u-opting-to-stay-alive.html | accessdate = October 6, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="mcquiston">{{cite news | last =McQuiston | first =John | title =U. of Bridgeport Refuses Aid From Moon's Group | work =[[The New York Times]] | page =B1 | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date = October 22, 1991 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/22/nyregion/u-of-bridgeport-refuses-aid-from-moon-s-group.html | accessdate = October 6, 2009}}</ref>

Problems continued to plague the university; enrollment fell to 1,300 in 1991. Debt rose to over $22 million in 1991–92. Serious plans to merge the university with Sacred Heart fell through in 1992; the law school instead wanted to associate with [[Quinnipiac University]], but Sacred Heart maintained that any takeover would have to include the Law School.<ref name="planstakeover">{{cite news | last =Judson | first =George | title =University of Bridgeport Plans Takeover by Sacred Heart | work =[[The New York Times]] | page =B4 | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date = January 17, 1992 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/17/nyregion/university-of-bridgeport-plans-takeover-by-sacred-heart.html | accessdate = October 6, 2009}}</ref> There were other universities willing to take over the school, but were unwilling to take on its debt.<ref name="judson" /> The university's charter required the trustees to enter into "serious negotiations",<ref name="judson" /> and they accepted the offer, giving the PWPA sixteen spots as trustees, constituting a majority.<ref name="approvestransfer">{{cite news | last =Judson | first =George | title =Bar Group Approves Transfer Of U. of Bridgeport Law School | work =[[The New York Times]] | page =B7 | publisher =[[The New York Times Company]] | date =August 13, 1992 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/13/nyregion/bar-group-approves-transfer-of-u-of-bridgeport-law-school.html | accessdate = October 6, 2009 }}</ref> The PWPA invested $50.5 million in the university on May 30, 1992,<ref name="closesdeal">{{cite news | last =The New York Times staff | title =Bridgeport U.

A two-year faculty strike, started in the midst of the university's financial troubles, intensified when the trustees gave control to the PWPA. Eventually, sixty-six professors and librarians agreed to a "divorce" with the university in return for compensation of up to a year's salary. In a similar move, the Law School decided to cut ties with the university,<ref name="approvestransfer" /> separating from it. In order for the law school to remain open it had to merge with a financially sound university. The law school faculty and students voted to merge with Quinnipiac University and the name was officially changed to the [[Quinnipiac University School of Law]].<ref name="approvestransfer" />

Once PWPA-appointed trustees constituted a majority on the Board of Trustees, the trustees retained the president at the time, Dr. Edwin G. Eigel, Jr. (1932–2008). Eigel served as president until 1995. He was succeeded by distinguished Holocaust scholar, professor emeritus at Florida State, and former PWPA president Dr. [[Richard L. Rubenstein]], who served from 1995 to 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1bpt.bridgeport.edu/~rlr/CVNOT2003-June.htm|title=RICHARD L. RUBENSTEIN|website=www1bpt.bridgeport.edu}}</ref> [[Neil Albert Salonen]], a member of the Unification Church, was the Chairman of the university's board of trustees when he was chosen to serve as ninth University president in 1999. He had earlier managed several Unification Church related organizations, and had served as President of the [[Unification Church of the United States]] from 1973 to 1980, and as Chairman of the [[List of Unification Church affiliated organizations|International Cultural Foundation]], prior to becoming the chief executive of the university.<ref>[http://www.theamericanchiropractor.com/articledetail.asp?articleid=437&category=21 Featuring Neil Albert Salonen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227155129/http://www.theamericanchiropractor.com/articledetail.asp?articleid=437&category=21 |date=2009-02-27 }} in ''The American Chiropractor'', July 30, 2005.</ref> Salonen retired in 2018.<ref name="Lambeck">{{cite web|url=https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Salonen-to-leave-a-very-different-stronger-12915099.php|title=Salonen to leave a very different, stronger University of Bridgeport|first=Linda Conner|last=Lambeck|date=16 May 2018|website=Connecticut Post}}</ref>

Since 2003 the university has been financially independent from PWPA after having received funding from the PWPA from 1992 until 2002. It has remained non-sectarian throughout. Turnover on the Board of Trustees had led, over time, to a very different composition, when compared to the 1991 board.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bridgeport.edu/about/governance-administration|title=Governance and Administration - University of Bridgeport|website=www.bridgeport.edu}}</ref> As he retired, Salonen stated that "2 or 3" members of the Board of Trustees were church members.<ref name="Lambeck"/> Under his successor, Laura Skandera Trombley, the Board of Trustees was enlarged to 36 members. She announced, in an email to faculty, staff, and students on May 24, 2019, that "During the May 17 meeting of the UB Board of Trustees, the body unanimously voted to amend the university's bylaws to remove any references to and governance rights of the Professors World Peace Academy, an affiliate of the Unification Church...This amendment finalizes a termination process, which was long under way. The board expressed its gratitude for previous support.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ctinsider.com/local/ctpost/article/University-of-Bridgeport-cuts-ties-with-13892933.php|title=University of Bridgeport cuts ties with Unification Church - CTInsider.com|date=24 May 2019|website=www.ctinsider.com}}</ref>

===Campus safety===
Around 2000, to address safety concerns both on and off-campus, the university instituted a program where students are issued a portable alarm unit (PAL) that pinpoints their position and enables campus security to get to them in under two minutes. This system works immediately on the university campus, and in the neighborhood surrounding campus. Further, the Campus Security Department has 40 unarmed personnel that provide security services 24 hours a day, with both on-foot and on bicycle patrols. In 2018, in the midst of a rapid gentrification in the neighborhood surrounding the campus, the global security firm [[The ADT Corporation|ADT]] ranked UB as the safest campus in Connecticut.<ref>[http://bronx.news12.com/clip/14318909/study-bridgeport-has-safest-college-campus-in-state] News 12 - ADT study</ref> In 2019, the University discontinued the use of PALs in favor of the LiveSafe app for mobile devices.
