'''Dance music''' is [[music]] composed specifically to facilitate or accompany [[dance|dancing]]. It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are [[Concert|live]] dance music and recorded dance music. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek vases]] sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving [[medieval dance]]s. In the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period, the major dance styles were [[noble court]] dances (see [[Baroque dance]]). In the [[classical music era]], the minuet was frequently used as a third [[movement (music)|movement]], although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The [[waltz]] also arose later in the classical era. Both remained part of the [[romantic music]] period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the [[barcarolle]], [[mazurka]], [[ecossaise]], [[Ballade (classical music)|ballade]] and [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]].

Modern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century's Western [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]] and [[social dance]] music. During the early 20th century, ballroom dancing gained popularity among the [[working class]] who attended public [[dance hall]]s. Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s. In the 1930s, called the Swing era, [[Swing music]] was the popular dance music in America. In the 1950s, [[rock and roll]] became the popular dance music. The late 1960s saw the rise of [[Soul music|soul]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] music. The rise of [[disco]] in the early 1970s led to dance music becoming popular with the public. By the late 1970s, [[electronic dance music]] was developing. This music, made using electronics, is a style of [[popular music]] commonly played in [[nightclub]]s, [[radio station]]s, [[concert|shows]] and [[rave]]s. Many subgenres of electronic dance music have evolved.

==Origins==

Folk dance music is music accompanying [[Folk dance|traditional dance]] and may be contrasted with historical/classical, and popular/commercial dance music. An example of folk dance music in the United States is the [[old-time music]] played at [[square dance]]s and [[contra dance]]s.

==Historical dance music==
{{See also|History of dance|History of ballet|Historical dance}}

While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek vases]] sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving [[medieval dance]]s such as [[Carol (music)|carols]] and the [[Estampie]]. The earliest of these surviving dances are almost as old as Western staff-based [[music notation]].

===By period===

The [[Renaissance dance]] music was written for instruments such as the [[lute]], [[viol]], [[tabor (instrument)|tabor]], [[pipe (instrument)|pipe]], and the [[sackbut]].

In the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period, the major dance styles were [[noble court]] dances (see [[Baroque dance]]). Examples of dances include the [[courante|French courante]], [[sarabande]], [[minuet]] and [[gigue]]. Collections of dances were often collected together as [[suite (music)|dance suites]].

In the [[classical music era]], the minuet was frequently used as a third [[movement (music)|movement]] in four-movement non-vocal works such as [[sonata (music)|sonatas]], [[string quartet]]s, and [[symphony|symphonies]], although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The [[waltz]] also arose later in the classical era, as the minuet evolved into the [[scherzo]] (literally, "joke"; a faster-paced minuet).

Both remained part of the [[romantic music]] period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the [[barcarolle]], [[mazurka]] and [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]]. Also in the romantic music era, the growth and development of [[ballet]] extended the composition of dance music to a new height. Frequently, dance music was a part of [[opera]].

==Popular dance music==

Modern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century's Western [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]] and [[social dance]] music.

===By genre===
Dance music works often bear the name of the corresponding dance, e.g. [[waltz]]es, the [[Tango music|tango]], the [[bolero]], the [[can-can]], [[minuet]]s, [[salsa music|salsa]], various kinds of [[jig]]s and the [[breakdown (music)|breakdown]]. Other dance forms include [[contradance]], the [[merengue (music)|merengue]] ([[Dominican Republic]]), and the [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]]. Often it is difficult to know whether the name of the music came first or the name of the dance.

[[Ballad]]s are commonly chosen for [[slow-dance]] routines. However ballads have been commonly deemed as the opposite of dance music in terms of their tempo. Originally, the ballad was a type of dance as well (hence the name "ballad", from the same root as "[[ballroom]]" and "[[ballet]]"). Ballads are still danced on the [[Faeroe Islands]].

====Dansband====
{{Main article|Dansband}}

"Dansband" ("Dance band") is a term in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] for bands who play a kind of [[popular music]], "dansbandsmusik" ("Dance band music"), to [[partner dance]] to. These terms came into use around 1970, and before that, many of the bands were classified as "[[pop music|pop groups]]". This type of music is mostly popular in the [[Nordic countries]].

====Disco====
{{Main article|Disco}}

Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of [[funk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Pop music|pop]], and [[Salsa music|salsa]]. It was most popular during the mid to late 1970s, though it has had brief resurgences afterwards. It inspired the [[electronic dance music]] genre.

====Electronic====

{{Main article|Electronic dance music}}

By 1981, a new form of dance music was developing. This music, made using electronics, is a style of [[popular music]] commonly played in dance music [[nightclub]]s, [[radio station]]s, [[concert|shows]] and [[rave]]s. During its gradual decline in the late 1970s, [[disco]] became influenced by electronic musical instruments such as synthesizers. The first notable fully synthesized disco hit was "[[I Feel Love]]" by [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Pete Bellotte]] with lyrics by [[Donna Summer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct09/articles/classictracks_1009.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909013758/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct09/articles/classictracks_1009.htm |archivedate=2013-09-09 }}</ref> [[Music loop|Looping]], [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[segue]]ing as found in disco continued to be used as creative techniques within [[trance music]], [[techno|techno music]] and especially [[house music]].

Electronic dance music experienced a boom in the late 1980s. In the UK, this manifested itself in the dance element of [[Tony Wilson]]'s [[Ha√ßienda]] scene (in Manchester) and London clubs like Delirium, The Trip, and Shoom. The scene rapidly expanded to the Summer Of Love in [[Ibiza]], which became the European capital of house and trance.

Many music genres that made use of electronic instruments developed into contemporary styles mainly due to the [[MIDI]] protocol, which enabled computers, synthesizers, [[sound card]]s, samplers, and drum machines to interact with each other and achieve the full synchronization of sounds. Electronic dance music is typically composed using [[synthesizers]] and [[computers]], and rarely has any physical [[musical instrument|instruments]]. Instead, this is replaced by [[Analog synthesizer|analogue]] and [[Digital data|digital]] [[electronic musical instrument|electronic]] sounds, with a 4/4 beat. Many producers of this kind of music however, such as [[Darren Tate]] and [[MJ Cole]], were trained in classical music before they moved into the electronic medium.

Associated with dance music are usually commercial tracks that may not easily be categorized, such as "[[The Power (Snap! song)|The Power]]" by [[Snap!]], "[[No Limit (2 Unlimited song)|No Limit]]" by [[2 Unlimited]], "[[Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)]]" by [[C+C Music Factory]], and the [[Beatmasters]]' "[[Rok da House]]" but the term "dance music" is applied to many forms of [[electronic music]], both commercial and non-commercial.

Some of the most popular upbeat genres include [[house music|house]], [[techno]], [[Drum and bass|drum & bass]], [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]], [[Hardcore techno|hardcore]], [[electronica]], [[Industrial music|industrial]], [[breakbeat]], [[Trance music|trance]], [[psychedelic trance]], [[UK garage]] and [[Electro (music)|electro]]. There are also much slower styles, such as [[downtempo]], [[Chill out music|chillout]] and [[nu jazz]].

Many subgenres of electronic dance music have evolved. Subgenres of [[House music|house]] include [[acid house]], [[electro house]], [[hard house]], [[funky house]], [[deep house]], [[tribal house]], [[hip house]], [[tech house]] and [[US garage]]. Subgenres of [[Drum and bass|drum & bass]] include [[techstep]], [[hardstep]], [[jump-up (drum and bass)|jump-up]], [[Intelligent drum and bass|intelligent D&B/atmospheric D&B]], [[liquid funk]], [[sambass]], [[drumfunk]], [[neurofunk]] and [[ragga jungle]]. Subgenres of other styles include [[progressive breaks]], [[booty bass]], [[Goa trance]], [[hard trance]], [[hardstyle]], [[minimal techno]], [[Gabber|gabber techno]], [[breakcore]], [[broken beat]], [[trip hop]], [[folktronica]] and [[Glitch (music)|glitch]]. [[Speed garage]], [[breakstep]], [[2-step garage|2-step]], [[Bassline (music genre)|bassline]], [[Grime (music)|grime]], [[UK funky]], [[future garage]] and the [[reggae]]-inspired [[dubstep]] are all subgenres of [[UK garage]].
