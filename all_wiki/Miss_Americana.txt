'''''Miss Americana''''' (also known as '''''Taylor Swift: Miss Americana''''') is a 2020 American [[documentary film]] directed by [[Lana Wilson]], that follows American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] and her life over the course of several years of her career. It was released on [[Netflix]] and in select theaters on January 31, 2020. The film has been described as an unvarnished and emotionally-revealing look at Swift, during a metamorphic phase in her life, as she learns to accept her role as not only an entertainer and singer-songwriter, but as a woman "harnessing the full power of her voice".

''Miss Americana'' debuted at the opening night of [[2020 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 23, 2020 to critical acclaim, with praise directed towards the documentary's intimacy and vulnerability. It also became the highest-rated Netflix-original biographical documentary by a recording artist in [[IMDb]] history. Accompanying the film's release, "[[Only the Young (Taylor Swift song)|Only the Young]]", a song by Swift featured in the end credits, was released as a [[promotional single]].

I experienced it as a person with extreme privilege, so I can only imagine what it's like when you don't have that. And I think one theme that ended up emerging in the film [''Miss Americana''] is what happens when you are not just a people pleaser but someone who's always been respectful of authority figures, doing what you were supposed to do, being polite at all costs. I still think it's important to be polite, but not at all costs. Not when you're being pushed beyond your limits, and not when people are walking all over you.

Willman wrote that the film further features clips capturing Swift's increasing [[Straight ally|LGBTQ allyship]], Swift's reaction to her mother's cancer diagnosis, and Swift's response to her 2017 album ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' not receiving any nominations in general categories at the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards|2019 Grammy Awards]]. Wilson stated that she views the movie as "looking at the flip side of being America's sweetheart", meant to shed light on the less-glamorous side of fame and stardom.<ref name="Variety2020"/>

==Impact==

The premiere of ''Miss Americana'' at the opening night of the [[2020 Sundance Film Festival]] and Swift's pre-announced appearance at the festival caused a surge in the number of attendees, traction and media coverage of the event. [[TechCrunch]]'s Matthew Panzarino stated that, "in nearly a decade of attending Sundance, I've never seen a scene like the premiere of ''Miss Americana''", and added that the "crowd before letting into the theater was huge", with rumors about how "there wouldn't be room for ticketed attendees".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/26/sundance-in-miss-americana-taylor-swift-demotes-the-internet/|title=Sundance: In Miss Americana, Taylor Swift demotes the internet|last=Panzarino|first=Matthew|date=January 26, 2020|website=[[TechCrunch]]|access-date=February 8, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/miss-americana-taylor-swift-brings-her-raw-star-power-sundance-1272592|title=With 'Miss Americana,' Taylor Swift Brings Her Raw Star Power to Sundance|last=Sinha-Roy|first=Piya|date=January 24, 2020|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=February 8, 2020}}</ref> Upon release, the film became the highest-rated Netflix-original biographical documentary by an artist in [[IMDb]] history.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Taylor Swift responds to comedian's apology for body shaming comments|url=https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/taylor-swift/documentary-miss-americana-netflix/|date=February 3, 2020|website=[[Capital (radio network)|Capital FM]]|access-date=May 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=5 Reasons To Watch Miss Americana (& 5 Reasons To Skip It)|url=https://screenrant.com/best-reasons-watch-taylor-swift-netflix-documentary-miss-americana-skip-it-bad/|last=Etemesi|first=Philip|date=February 23, 2020|website=[[ScreenRant]]|access-date=May 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=In "Taylor Swift: Miss Americana" fans discover a vulnerable Swift in the biographical documentary|url=https://tbsnews.net/entertainment/taylor-swift-miss-americana-fans-discover-vulnerable-swift-biographical-documentary|last=Adnin|first=Nazia|date=February 21, 2020|website=[[Business Standard]]|access-date=May 7, 2020}}</ref>

American singer [[Katy Perry]] praised the film, stating that she was impressed by ''Miss Americana'', because of its [[self-awareness]] and vulnerability, and commented that she was "really excited for her [Swift] to be able to show that to the world: that things aren't perfect, they don't have to be, and it's more beautiful when they aren't".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/katy-perry-praised-taylor-swifts-miss-americana-doc-for-its-vulnerability-22583212|title=Katy Perry Was Impressed By Taylor Swift's 'Miss Americana' Documentary|last=Wang|first=Jessica|date=March 2, 2020|website=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]|language=en|access-date=March 6, 2020}}</ref> Perry further added that ''Miss Americana'' inspires her to make her own documentary.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kemp|first=Ella|date=September 8, 2020|title=Katy Perry to release access-all-areas film inspired by Taylor Swift|url=https://www.nme.com/news/film/katy-perry-to-release-access-all-areas-film-inspired-by-taylor-swift-2747954|access-date=September 10, 2020|website=[[NME]]|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=September 8, 2020|title=Katy Perry inspired by Taylor Swift to make tell-all documentary|url=https://www.celebretainment.com/music/katy-perry-inspired-by-taylor-swift-to-make-tell-all-documentary/article_fc1e56e8-9a1a-540d-a2db-bf142819387d.html|access-date=September 10, 2020|website=[[The Daily Nonpareil]]|language=en}}</ref> [[Emily Strayer]], of the American country music band [[The Chicks]], commented on the documentary, stating: "The power she [Swift] has right now to change things is way beyond any power we [The Chicks] ever had.

=== Conversations on mental health ===
''Miss Americana'' fueled several conversations about [[eating disorder]]s, [[Body dysmorphic disorder|body dysmorphia]], [[Hypergymnasia|exercise anorexia]], [[self-esteem]], [[Cyberbullying|toxic internet culture]] and [[sexual assault]]. Writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Jessica Gold, professor of [[psychiatry]] at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]], stated that Swift "struck a powerful chord with viewers" with ''Miss Americana'', "thanks to her honesty regarding her struggle for approval as a woman in today's society". Gold called Swift "the leader we need in 2020", who steps up to "fill gaps left by political leadership", during a time "when our political leaders are struggling to build consensus on and convey the gravity of issues" like [[mental health]]. She explained that Swift's leadership is commercially savvy, but also shows how celebrities "can now speak directly to fans, doing tremendous good in the process", and concluded that the singer is sending a powerful message—"one that is likely to save lives in myriad ways".<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/03/17/taylor-swift-leader-we-need-now/|title=Taylor Swift, the leader we need now|last=Gold|first=Jessica|date=March 17, 2020|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|access-date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> 

{{Quote|text=I remember how, when I was 18, that was the first time I was on the cover of a magazine, and the headline was like "Pregnant at 18?". And it was because I had worn something that made my lower stomach look not flat. So I just registered that as a punishment. And then I'd walk into a photo shoot and be in the dressing room and somebody who worked at a magazine would say, "Oh, wow, this is so amazing that you can fit into the sample sizes. Usually we have to make alterations to the dresses, but we can take them right off the runway and put them on you!" And I looked at that as a pat on the head.

Kelly Douglas of ''The Mighty'' opined that Swift's "powerful candor" about her eating disorders and body dysmorphia will "not only resonate with others facing similar struggles, but could also encourage others to seek help for their eating disorder behaviors".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://themighty.com/2020/01/taylor-swift-eating-disorder-reveal-recovery/|title=Why Taylor Swift's Eating Disorder Reveal Could Help Others|last=Douglas|first=Kelly|website=The Mighty|language=en-US|date=January 30, 2020|access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref> The ''[[New York Post]]''{{'s}} Elana Fishman confessed: "every so often, I'll still catch myself criticizing the way my tummy or legs look in a photo or how a certain pair of pants fits me.

Petersen added that Swift refuses "to hide, and thus continue to normalize, the behaviors that perpetuate it".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/taylor-swift-miss-americana-disordered-eating-body-image|title=Taylor Swift and the Gray Area Of Disordered Eating|last=Petersen|first=Anne Helen|website=BuzzFeed News|language=en|date=February 8, 2020|access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref>

''[[The Daily Targum]]'' stated that, despite being an expert when it comes to handling negative comments, even Swift "succumbed to insecurities that blossomed into eating problems, which shows how even the strongest among us are susceptible to potential eating disorders due to the toxic environment of [[social media]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailytargum.com/article/2020/02/taylor-swifts-miss-americana-shows-that-eating-disorders-can-manifest-silently|title=Taylor Swift's 'Miss Americana' shows that eating disorders can manifest silently|last=Esposito|first=Laura|website=The Daily Targum|date=February 2020|access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref> Ellen Ricks of ''[[HelloGiggles]]'' called Swift's reveal of her disorder as inspirational, noting "how it can potentially impact so many people still fighting", as "there is still so much stigma and misinformation" surrounding eating disorders, and praised Swift for "using her voice to shed light on the issue for her fans".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taylor-swifts-eating-disorder-reveal-175222219.html|title=Taylor Swift's eating disorder reveal in Miss Americana has given me hope in my own recovery|last=Ricks|first=Ellen|website=Yahooo!

In an interview with ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', Wilson talked about the positive comments she received regarding her decision to include Swift's eating disorder and body image issues in the film:{{Quote|quote=It's been such a positive reaction. People are connecting to it in a really deep way, which was, of course, my dream when making the movie. I think to see Taylor, someone who's an icon of beauty, voicing these thoughts that so many people have had is incredibly, incredibly powerful because it's not something you would expect to hear. God, I almost tear up like thinking about some of the notes I've gotten from teenagers about how they look in the mirror and they hate their body and they hate the way they look. But now that they've seen that Taylor has struggled with some of these same things too, and she's gotten through it and she's stronger and happier as a result, and that inspires them to keep going. It's just so moving.|author=[[Lana Wilson]] on the overwhelming positive comments she received|title=|source=''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.femestella.com/miss-americana-taylor-swift-eating-disorder/|title='Miss Americana' Director Says Fans Can't Stop Thanking Her For the Scene with Taylor Swift's Eating Disorder|last=Ziegler|first=Ashley|date=2020-02-12|website=Femestella|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref>}}

''Miss Americana'' further prompted many of Swift's past critics to respond to the documentary. American comedian [[Nikki Glaser]] wrote an apology on [[Instagram]] for her comments about Swift featured in the film. In the apology, Glaser stated that: "Unfortunately, I am featured in her [Swift's] new documentary as part of a montage of asshats saying mean things about her, which is used to explain why she felt the need to escape from the spotlight for a year", and admitted that her comments may have come from a place of "projection". She further added that "if you're familiar with my 'work' at all, you know I talk openly about battling some kind of eating disorder for the past 17 years, I was probably 'feeling fat' that day and was jealous". Swift responded: "One of the major themes of the doc is that we have the ability to change our opinions over time, to grow, to learn about ourselves. I'm so sorry to hear that you've struggled with some of the same things I've struggled with. Sending a massive hug".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/miss-americana-nikki-glaser-apologizes-taylor-swift-t172987|title=Nikki Glaser apologizes to Taylor Swift for resurfaced body shaming comments|last=Gariano|first=Francesca|website=[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]|language=en|date=February 3, 2020|access-date=March 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a30742704/taylor-swift-accepts-nikki-glaser-apology-miss-americana-clip/|title=Taylor Swift Responds To Nikki Glaser's Apology After Miss Americana Clip|last=Harwood|first=Erika|date=February 2, 2020|website=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|language=en-US|access-date=March 7, 2020}}</ref> American writer Jenny Johnson also posted a lengthy apology on Instagram, writing that her comments about Swift being "annoying" were "made in jest", and stated: "please know I'm not against you, I'm with you and I apologize." Journalist Richard S. took to [[Twitter]] to apologize to Swift for an article he wrote in 2016, titled "Taylor Swift Isn't Like Other Celebrities, She's Worse". He explained that the article was intended to "deconstruct the pettiness of the [[celebrity–industrial complex]]" and expressed his regret that the headline appeared to be "overly critical" of Swift. He concluded that he has "learned so much from Taylor's artistry over the years, and remain[s] a huge fan".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theblast.com/110185/everyone-is-apologizing-to-taylor-swift-now-thanks-to-miss-ameri|title=Everyone Is Apologizing To Taylor Swift Now Thanks To 'Miss Americana'|last=Coe|first=Michael|date=February 3, 2020|website=The Blast|language=en|access-date=March 7, 2020}}</ref> 

=== Political advertisement ===
"Only the Young", the film's [[promotional single]], was used to advertise [[Biden/Harris]], as part of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] campaign for [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 United States presidential elections]]. Representative [[Eric Swalwell]] revealed that Swift authorized the usage of the song for the campaign free-of-cost, marking the first time Swift has allowed her music to be used in a political advertisement. The video advertisement was released on October 30, 2020. It opens with a quote from [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential]] candidate, [[Kamala Harris]], wondering why "so many powerful people are making it so difficult to vote". The rest of the advertisement features a montage of scenes from the past four years in the US: Videos of [[Me Too movement|Me Too]] and [[Black Lives Matter]] protesters, President [[Donald Trump]] removing his face mask following [[COVID-19]] hospitalization, Judge [[Amy Coney Barrett]] being sworn in as a [[U.S. Supreme Court Justice|Supreme Court justice]], a 75-year-old protester being pushed to the ground by police in [[Buffalo, New York]], and a scene of young supporters of [[Presidential nominee]] [[Joe Biden]] organizing and taking part in [[early voting]]. The video concludes with the motto: "You've marched for four years. Now it's time to run". Harris expressed gratitude to Swift, and tweeted that the singer is showing the young voters "what's at stake" in the election.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=October 30, 2020|title=Taylor Swift Lends 'Only the Young' to New Political Ad|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-lends-only-the-young-to-new-political-ad-1083987/|access-date=October 30, 2020|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":02">{{Cite web|last=Swanson|first=Ian|date=October 30, 2020|title=Taylor Swift allows song to be used in campaign ad|url=https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/523553-taylor-swift-allows-song-to-be-used-in-campaign-ad|access-date=October 30, 2020|website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|language=en}}</ref>
