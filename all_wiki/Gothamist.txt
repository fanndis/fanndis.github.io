'''Gothamist LLC''' was the operator, or in some cases [[franchising|franchisor]], of eight city-centric websites that focused on news, events, food, culture, and other local coverage. It was founded in 2003 by Jake Dobkin and Jen Chung. In March 2017, [[Joe Ricketts]], owner of [[DNAinfo]], acquired the company and, in November 2017, the websites were temporarily shut down after the newsroom staff voted to [[Trade union|unionize]]. In February 2018, it was announced that [[WNYC]], [[KPCC]] and [[WAMU]] had acquired Gothamist, LAist and DCist, respectively. Chicagoist was purchased by Chicago-born rapper [[Chance the Rapper]] in July 2018.

==History==

=== Early history and other blogs ===
The [[namesake]] blog, Gothamist, focused on [[New York City]], was founded in 2003, by publisher Jake Dobkin and editor Jen Chung. {{as of|2014|6|df=us}} other blogs operated by the company include LAist (for [[Los Angeles]]), DCist for [[Washington, D.C.]], Chicagoist, and SFist (for [[San Francisco]]) in the [[United States]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gothamistllc.com/#who-reads-us|publisher=Gothamist|title=Media Kit}}</ref> as well as [[Shanghaiist]] internationally.<ref name=Shanghaiist>{{cite web|title=Shanghaiist|url=http://shanghaiist.com/|website=Shanghaiist|accessdate=23 January 2016|ref=Shanghaiist}}</ref>

Canadian blog Torontoist was launched by the American company, but was transferred to the locally-owned Ink Truck Media in April 2009, while retaining its "-ist" name and remaining affiliated with the Gothamist network.<ref>[http://torontoist.com/2009/04/torontoist_is_here_to_stay.php Torontoist Is Here To Stay], ''Torontoist'', 8 April 2009</ref> In March 2011, Torontoist was acquired from Ink Truck Media by St. Joseph Media, magazine publishing division of Canadian media giants [[St. Joseph Communications]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/torontoist-bought-by-magazine-company/article571808/ | title=Torontoist bought by magazine company | first=ADRIAN | last=MORROW | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | date=March 14, 2011}}</ref> As a result the site was not affected by the Gothamist shutdown in 2017, and remained in operation until it was acquired by ''[[Daily Hive]]'' in 2019.

In a similar fashion, in 2010 Londonist was transferred to the London-based startup LDN Creative.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://londonist.com/2010/06/news_in_which_londonist_is_compared | title=Londonist And @LDN Join Forces | work=Londonist | date=June 11, 2010}}</ref>

An estimate by income.com in 2015 quoted the monthly revenue from Gothamist at $110,000.<ref>[https://income.com/4100/27-bloggers-who-make-amazing-money-from-their-blogs/ "25 Top Money Earning Bloggers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507090006/https://income.com/4100/27-bloggers-who-make-amazing-money-from-their-blogs/ |date=2016-05-07 }}.

=== Shutdown ===
In 2017, Gothamist and all related blogs were sold to [[Joe Ricketts]], owner of [[DNAinfo.com]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.politico.com/media/story/2017/03/trump-donor-local-news-publisher-joe-ricketts-acquires-gothamist-websites-004939 | title=Joe Ricketts, local news publisher and Trump backer, acquires Gothamist websites | first=JOE | last=POMPEO | work=[[Politico]] | date=March 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://observer.com/2017/03/dnainfo-buys-gothamist-joe-ricketts/ | title=Joe Ricketts’ DNAinfo Buys Gothamist, Creating Local News Juggernaut | first=John | last=Bonazzo | work=[[observer.com|Observer]] | date=March 8, 2017}}</ref> After the acquisition, Gothamist expunged from its archives a number of stories that had covered Ricketts critically. Regarding the removal of Ricketts related content from the site, Dobkin told [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]], “Just as Bloomberg doesn’t cover Bloomberg, we don’t plan to cover Joe Ricketts and so we decided to take down our coverage of him. No one asked us to do it. It was a decision made solely by Jen [Chung] and me.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://jezebel.com/gothamist-deleted-negative-coverage-of-its-new-owner-1793085352|title=Gothamist Deleted Negative Coverage of Its New Owner|work=Jezebel|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en-US}}</ref>

On November 2, 2017, Ricketts posted to both DNAinfo and the "-ist" network sites that both websites would immediately cease operations, a week after Gothamist writers voted to unionize with the [[Writers Guild of America, East]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2017/11/02/ricketts-shuts-dnainfo/|title=Ricketts shuts down DNAinfo|last=Feder|first=Robert|date=2 November 2017|accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref> All content from all DNAinfo sites and all subsidiary sites were taken down.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/nyregion/dnainfo-gothamist-shutting-down.html|title=DNAinfo and Gothamist Are Shutting Down|last=Newman|first=Andy|date=November 2, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=November 2, 2017|last2=Leland|first2=John|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The next day, archives of the sites were returned to functionality.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1119220/the-archives-of-dnainfo-gothamist-chicagoist-laist-and-shanghaiist-are-not-deleted/|title=DNAInfo’s and Gothamist’s archives still exist and are likely to be resurrected|last=Yanofsky|first=David|date=2017-11-03|work=Quartz|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US}}</ref> Ricketts's shutdown was criticized as being a mere act of retaliation after the two companies' workers had joined a union.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/opinion/dnainfo-gothamist-ricketts-union.html|title=Opinion {{!}} A Billionaire Destroyed His Newsrooms Out of Spite|last=Nolan|first=Hamilton|date=2017-11-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In the aftermath of the shutdown, laid-off reporters for Gothamist stated that former owners Jake Dobkin and Jen Chung actively cooperated with Ricketts to discourage the union efforts, “It was textbook [[union-busting]] stuff.”<ref name="newyorker_20171114">{{Cite journal
