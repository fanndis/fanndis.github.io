'''Adana''' ({{IPA-tr|aˈda.na|pron}}; {{lang-hy|Ադանա}}; {{lang-grc|Άδανα}}, {{lang-ar|أضنة}}) is a [[Cilicia]]n city in southern [[Turkey]]. The city is situated on the [[Seyhan River]], {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} inland from the north-eastern coast of the [[Mediterranean sea]]. It is the administrative seat of the [[Adana Province]] and has a population of 1.77 million.<ref name="Adana2018">{{cite web |url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=tr |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 February 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204010758/https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=tr |archive-date=4 February 2016}}</ref>

Adana lies in the heart of Cilicia, a distinct geo-cultural region, at a time, was one of the most important regions of the [[Classical antiquity|classical world]] by being crossroads for religions and civilizations.<ref name=Ancient>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ancient.eu/Cilicia_Campestris/ |title=Cilicia Campestris |author=Joshua J. Mark |work=Ancient History Encyclopedia |access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref> Home to six million people, Cilicia is one of the largest population concentrations in the [[Near East]], as well an agriculturally productive area, owing to its large fertile plain of Çukurova. Adding the large population centers surrounding Cilicia, almost 10 million people reside within two hours' drive from the Adana city center.

One of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements of the world<ref name=Valilik>{{Cite web| url=https://adana.ktb.gov.tr/TR-60704/genel-bilgiler.html/ |title=Adana Genel Bilgiler |publisher=Adana İl Kültür ve Turizm Müdürlüğü |access-date=14 July 2020}}</ref> and with a name unchanged for at least four millennia, Adana was a market town at the Cilicia plain and one of the gateways from Europe to the Middle East. The city turned into a powerhouse of Cilicia with the [[Oghuz Turks|Turkic]] takeover in 1359. It remained as the capital of the [[Ramadanid Emirate]] until 1608, and then the regional center for the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Turkey]] and shortly for the [[Cilicia#French Cilicia|French Cilicia]]. The city boomed with the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, and emerged as a hub for international cotton trade. Traditionally a town populated by [[Armenians]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]]; influx of [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Greeks]], [[Circassians]], [[Jews]] and [[Alawites]] during this period made the city one of the most diverse cities of the Empire. Economic, social and cultural growth was halted by the [[Adana massacre]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], and the 1921 Cilicia evacuation,<ref name="HrantAdana">{{cite web |url=https://hrantdink.org/attachments/article/1398/Adana_Raporu_new.pdf |title=Ermeni Kültür Varlıklarıyla Adana |publisher=HDV Yayınları |access-date=12 March 2020}}</ref> all of which devastated the city in the early 20th century. After the eviction of Christian community, most of the city's private properties, value-wise, were confiscated in 1923 and were granted to the Muslim Turks who recently had migrated into the city. After a standstill period, city's economy again boomed in the 1950s with the construction of the [[Seyhan Dam]], and the growth continued until the 1980s.

In the 21st century, Adana is a center for regional trade, healthcare, and public and private services. Agriculture and logistics are significant sectors of the city. The economic decline caused by national policies and de-industrialization since the 1990s is reversing, as the city is gaining momentum with the fairs, festivals and entertainment life. The rivalry between the city's football clubs, [[Adanaspor]] and [[Adana Demirspor]], is getting attraction as being a [[Adana football derby|derby]] that is rooted in socio-economic divisions.

==Etymology==
One theory holds that the city name originates from a hypothetical [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] term; ''a danu'' ({{lang-en|on the river}}). Many river names in Europe were derived from the same [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root: [[Danube]], [[Don (river)|Don]], [[Dnieper]] and [[Donets]].<ref name="Sertkaya">Osman Fikri Sertkaya, " Adana, Begrek, Beyrek ve Elma Kelimelerinin Kökeni Üzerine", Ankara Üniversitesi Dil ve Tarih Coğrafya Fakültesi Türkoloji Dergisi, S.12, (2012), pages 101-103 (Article)</ref> The earliest time Adana was mentioned was around 2000 BC in the Hittite tablets. With a history of at least four millennia, Adana is one of the oldest continuously used place names and had only pronunciation changes under different rules.

In [[Homer]]'s [[Illiad]], the name of the city is mentioned as Adana. For a short while during the Hellenistic era, the city was known as Ἀντιόχεια τῆς Κιλικίας ({{lang-en|Antioch in Cilicia}}) and as Ἀντιόχεια ἡ πρὸς Σάρον ({{lang-en|Antioch on [[Seyhan River|Sarus]]}}). On some [[cuneiform]]s, the city name was mentioned as [[Quwê]], and as ''Coa'' in some other sources which could be the place [[Solomon]] had obtained his horses as per [[Bible]] (I Kings 10:28; II Chronicles 1:16). Under the Armenian rule, the city was known as Ատանա (Atana) or Ադանա (Adana). An ancient Greco-Roman legend mentions that the name of Adana originates from ''Adanus'', the son of the Greek god [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], who founded the city next to the river with his brother.<ref name="Anton">{{cite book| last=Anton| first=Charles| title=Classical Dictionary: Containing an account of the principal proper names mentioned in ancient authors... |location= New York| publisher=Harper & Brothers | year=1841}}</ref> His brother's name, ''Sarus'', was given to the river. An older legend, in [[Akkadian Empire|Accadian]], [[Sumer]]ian, [[Babylonia]]n, [[Assyria]]n and [[Hittites|Hittite]] mythologies, originates the city's name to the [[Weather god|Storm and rain god]] [[Hadad|Adad]] who lived in the surrounding forests. There are Hittite manuscripts that were founded in the region regarding this legend. The legend had survived as the Storm and rain god continued to create rain and abundance. The locals had great admiration towards the God and called the region ''Uru Adaniyya'' (English: Adana region) in his honour. The city inhabitants were called [[Denyen|Danuna]].

According to Ali Cevad's Memalik-i Osmaniye Coğrafya Lügatı ({{lang-en|Ottoman Geography Dictionary}}), Muslims of Adana originated the city's name to Ebu Süleym Ezene, who was appointed as [[Wali]] by [[Abbasid Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/memlikiosmaniyen0001al#page/n18/mode/2up|title=Memalik-i Osmaniye Tarih ve Coğrafya Lügatı|language=tr|publisher=archive.org|access-date=12 June 2020}}</ref> Other than Ezene, Ottoman and Islamic resources also mention the city as Edene, Azana and Batana.

==Geography==
[[File:Sinanpaşa_footbridge_over_the_Seyhan_River.JPG|thumb|[[Seyhan River]] passes through Adana.]]

Adana is located on the [[37th parallel north]] at the northeastern edge of the Mediterranean, where it serves as the gateway to the Cilicia plain. This large stretch of flat, fertile land lies southeast of the [[Taurus Mountains]]. From Adana, crossing Cilicia westwards, the road from Tarsus enters the foothills of the Taurus Mountains, eventually reaching an altitude of nearly {{convert|4000|ft|m}}. It goes through the famous [[Cilician Gates]], the rocky pass through which armies have coursed since the dawn of history, and continues to the Anatolian plain.

The [[Seyhan River]] (formerly called the Sarus) that passes through Adana, occasionally flooded the city until embankments were built in the 1900s.<ref>A.F. Baldwin (chief editor) {{google books|tV5JAQAAMAAJ|Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of Manufactures, Daily Consular and Trade Reports, Issues 1-75 (1910)|page=662}}</ref> The north of the city is surrounded by the Seyhan reservoir. The Seyhan Dam, completed in 1956, was constructed for hydroelectric power and to irrigate the lower Çukurova plain. Two irrigation channels in the city flow to the plain, passing through the city center from east to west. There is another canal for irrigating the Yüreğir plain to the southeast of the city.

===Climate===
Adana has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (Csa) under both the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] classification, and a dry-hot summer subtropical climate (Csa) under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] classification. Winters are mild and wet. Frost does occasionally occur at night almost every winter, but snow is a very rare phenomenon. Summers are long, hot, humid and dry. During heatwaves, the temperature often reaches or exceeds {{convert|40|°C|1|abbr=on}}. The highest recorded temperature was on 8 July 1978 at {{convert|45.6|°C|1|abbr=on}}. The lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|-8.1|°C|1|abbr=on}}.

==History==
Adana is considered to be the oldest city of Cilicia, and with a history of 8-millennia, it is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities of the world. The history of the [[Tepebağ]] [[tumulus]] dates back to the [[Neolithic]], to around 6000 B.C., the time of the first human settlements.  A place called ''Adana'' is mentioned by name in a [[Sumer]]ian epic, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].

First known people living in Adana and the surrounding area were the [[Luwians]]. They controlled the Mediterranean coasts of Anatolia roughly from 3000 BC to around 1600 BC. [[Hittites]] took over the region which came to be known as [[Kizzuwatna]]. Inhabited by Luwians and [[Hurrians]], Kizzuwatna had an autonomous governance under the Hittites protection, but they had a brief independent period from the 1500s to 1420s. According to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] inscription of [[Kava]], found in [[Hattusa]] ([[Boğazkale]]), [[Kizzuwatna]] was the kingdom that ruled Adana, under the protection of the Hittites by 1335 BC. Beginning with the collapse of the [[Hittite Empire]] c. 1191–1189 BC, Adana native [[Denyen]] [[sea peoples]] took control of the plain until around 900 BC.<ref name="Philistines">Ann E.

Quwê and other states were protected by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], though they had independent periods. After the Greek migration to Cilicia in the 8th century BC, the region was unified under the rule of [[Mopsus|Mopsos]] dynasty<ref name="Fox-211ff">Fox, Robin Lane (2009) ''Travelling Heroes: In the Epic Age of Homer'' Alfred A.

Bilingual inscriptions of the ninth and eighth centuries found in [[Mopsuestia]] were written in [[hieroglyphic Luwian]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]. Assyrians took control of the regions several times until their collapse in 612 BC.
 
Cilicians founded the [[Kingdom of Cilicia (ancient)|Kingdom of Cilicia]] in 612 BC with the efforts of [[Syennesis (5th century)|Syennesis I]]. The kingdom was independent until the invasion of [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 549 BC, then after, became an autonomous [[Cilicia (satrapy)|satrapy]] of Achaemenids until 401 BC. The uncertain loyalty of the Syennessis during the rebellion of [[Cyrus the Younger]] led [[Artaxerxes II]] to abolish the Syennesis administration and replace it with a centrally appointed satrap. Archeological remains of a procession reveals the existence of [[Persians|Persian]] nobility in Adana.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cilicia-3rd-cent|title=Cilicia|last=Michael Weiskopf|publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2020-07-26}}</ref>

[[File:Minted coin of Adana - 250 BC.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Minted coin of Adana, c.250 BC]]
[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] had an unexpected entry into Cilicia in 333 BC through the [[Cilician Gates]] and appointed the Syennesis dynasty to re-administer the region. His death in 323 BC marked the beginning of the  [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] era, as Greek replaced Luwian as the language of the region. After a short time under the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic dominion]], [[Seleucid Empire]] took control of the region in 312 BC. Adanan locals had adopted a Greek name for the city, ''Antioch on Sarus'', to demonstrate loyalty to the Seleucid dynasty. The adopted name and the motifs illustrating the personification of the city seated above the [[Potamoi|river-god]] ''Sarus'' on city's minted coins, reveal appreciation to the rivers which were strong part of the Cilician identity.<ref name="MarionMeyer">{{citation| last=Meyer| first=Marion | title=Cilicia as Part of the Seleucid Empire - The Beginning of Municipal Coinage|location=Istanbul| publisher=Institut Français d'Études Anatoliennes-Georges Dumézil| year=2001|pages=505–518}}</ref> Although the Adana area were into international trade, coasts of rugged Cilicia were under the heavy plunder of the [[Cilician pirates]].

Cilicia became a vassal state of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] in 83 BC and new settlements were founded by Armenians in the region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hyeetch.nareg.com.au/armenians/prominent_p5.html|title=King Tigran II – The Great|last=Hye Etch|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221235257/http://www.hyeetch.nareg.com.au/armenians/prominent_p5.html|archive-date=21 February 2007|access-date=2007-01-17}}</ref>

===Roman-Byzantine, Islamic and Armenian era===
[[File:Istanbul - Museo archeol. - Adriano - Da Adana - sec. II d.C. - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006 01.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Emperor [[Hadrian]], 2nd century CE]]
[[Pompey]] took over entire Cilicia and organized it as a [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Roman province]] in 64BC. Adana was of relatively minor importance during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]'s influential period, while nearby Tarsus was the [[metropolis]] of the area. During the era of [[Pompey]], the city was used as a prison for the pirates of Cilicia. The [[Taşköprü (Adana)|Sarus bridge]] was built in the early 2nd century, and for several centuries thereafter, the city was a [[wikt:way station|waystation]] on a Roman military road leading to the East. After the permanent split of the [[Roman Empire]] in 395 AD, the area became a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and was probably developed during the time of [[Julian the Apostate]]. With the construction of large bridges, roads, government buildings, irrigation and plantation, Adana and Cilicia became the most developed and important trade centers of the region. 
[[File:Adana_Archaeological_Museum_Achilles'_Sarcophagus_170-190_AD_0456.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Achilles' Sarcophagus 170–190 AD]]
Adana was a Christian [[bishopric]], a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of Tarsus, but was raised to the rank of autocephalous archdiocese after 680, the year in which its bishop appeared as a simple bishop at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]], but before its listing in a 10th-century ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' as an archdiocese.

During Umayyad rule, Cilicia became a [[no man's land]] frontier between Byzantine Christian and Arab Muslim forces.<ref name=Ancient /> In 746, profiting by the unstable conditions in the Umayyad Caliphate, Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] took control of Adana in 746. [[Abbasid Caliphate]] took over the rule of the region from Byzantine after [[Al-Mansur]]'s inauguration to caliph in 756. With the Abbasid rule, Muslims for the first time started settling in Cilicia. Abandoned for more than 50 years, Adana was garrisoned and re-settled from 758 to 760. To form a [[Al-Awasim|Thughūr]] on the Byzantine frontier, Cilicia was colonized with the Turkic Sayābija tribe from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. The city had seen rapid economic and cultural growth during the reign of [[Harun al-Rashid]] and [[Al-Amin]].

The city became part of the [[Seleucia (theme)|Seleucia theme]]. After the defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] was removed from reign by a coup. He then gathered a troop to regain his power, though got defeated and had to retreat his troop to Adana. He was forced to surrender by the garrison in Adana upon receiving assurances of his personal safety.

[[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]], the founder of the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]], annexed Adana in his campaign in 1084. Cilicia had been criss-crossed by invading armies and the [[crusades]] during this period until it was captured by the forces of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian Principality of Cilicia]] in 1132, under its king, [[Leo I of Armenia|Leo I]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Morton|title=The Crusader States and their Neighbours: A Military History, 1099-1187|year=2020|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0192557988|page=181}}</ref> It was taken by [[Byzantine]] forces in 1137, but the Armenians regained it around 1170.

The city was the center of a large trading network from [[Anatolia|Minor Asia]] to [[North Africa]], Near East and [[India]].

Most Armenians of the city fled to [[Cyprus]] after the ceding.

The Mamluks built garrisons in Tarsus, [[Yumurtalık|Ayas]] port and [[Sarvandikar]], and left the administration of Adana plain to [[Oghuz Turks#Üçoks (Three Arrows)|Yüreğir Turks]] who already formed a Mamluk authorized ''Türkmen Emirate'' in [[Camili, Yüreğir|Camili]] area in 1352, just southeast of Adana. The [[Amir]], Ramazan Bey, designated Adana as the capital, and headed the Yüreğir Turks in settling the city. The emirate which later on known as the [[Ramadanid Emirate]], were ''de facto'' independent throughout the 15th century, by being a [[Al-Awasim#Mamluk–Turkmen frontier|Thughūr]] in the Ottoman-Mamluk relations. In 1517, Selim I incorporated the beylik into the Ottoman Empire after his conquest of the Mamluk state. The Ramadanid Beys held the administration of the new Ottoman sanjak of Adana in a hereditary manner until 1608.

Wealth acquired with the thriving regional economy, doubling of Cilician Armenian population due to flee from [[Hamidian Massacres|Hamidian massacres]], the end of autocratic [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdulhamid]] rule with the [[Young Turk Revolution|revolution]] of July 1908, empowered the Armenian community and envisioned an autonomous Cilicia. [[Committee of Union and Progress|CUP's]] post-revolution mismanagement of Vilayets, caused pro-diversity ''Vali'' Bahri Pasha to be removed from the office in late 1908, and replaced him with the impotent Cevad Bey. Taking that into advantage, Bağdadizade Abdülkadir (Paksoy), the local leader of Cemiyet-i Muhammediye, took almost control of the local governance and led an action plan in entire Cilicia to "punish" Armenians. Rumours of an upcoming Armenian attack, deliberate provocations tensed the Turkish neighborhoods.

After a week of silence, 850 soldiers from regiments of the Ottoman Army arrived to the city on April 25. Shots were fired to the tents that soldiers set at the campground, and a rumor immediately spread that the Armenians had opened fire from a church tower. Without even investigating any falsity of the rumor, the military commander Mustafa Remzi Pasha directed soldiers, together with the [[bashi-bazouk]]s, towards Armenian quarters and for three days; shot people, destroyed buildings and burned down Christian neighborhoods. Pogroms of 25–27 April were much larger than the 14–17 April clashes, and the casualties were almost all Christian.<ref>{{citation|last=Yeghiayan|first=Puzant|title=Ատանայի Հայոց Պատմութիւն [The History of the Armenians of Adana]|location=Beirut|publisher=Union of Armenian Compatriots of Adana|year=1970|pages=211–272|language=hy}}</ref>

The [[Adana massacre]] of April 1909, resulted in the deaths of 18,839 Armenians, 1250 Greeks, 850 Assyrians, 422 Chaldeans and 620 Muslims. Adding the roughly 2500 disappeared [[Saimbeyli|Hadjinian]] and other seasonal workers, the death roll is estimated around 25,500 in the entire [[Vilayet of Adana|Vilayet]]. Later in summer, 2000 children died of [[dysentery]] and few thousand adults died of injuries or epidemic. The massacre orphaned 3500 children and caused heavy destruction of Christian properties.<ref>Raymond H. Kévorkian, "The Cilician Massacres, April 1909" in ''Armenian Cilicia'', eds. [[Richard G.

With the financial support he could gather, Djemal Pasha founded a new neighborhood, ''Çarçabuk'' (now Döşeme), for Armenians within a very short time, ordered the construction of [[Adana Dârüleytâm|two orphanages]] and the restoration of destroyed buildings.<ref name="Agos" /> Cilicia section of the [[Berlin–Baghdad railway]] had opened in 1912, connecting Adana to Middle East. In few years, the city had re-gained its momentum and by the turn of 1915, the Armenian population numbered up to 30,000, close to the figure before 1909.

====The city during Armenian Genocide====
[[File:Deportation trains to Syria.png|thumb|225px|right|Armenians loading on to the trains for the trip to Syria]]
Early in May 1915, ''Vali'' Ismail Hakkı Bey received an order from Constantinople (now İstanbul) to deport the Armenians of the city. ''Vali'' was able to delay the deportations and let the Armenians to sell their movable assets to acquire money for the trip. First convoy of deportees consisting of more than 4000 Armenians left the city on May 20. The [[Holy See of Cilicia|Catholicos of Cilicia]], [[Sahak II of Cilicia|Sahak II]] wrote a letter to Djemal Pasha, then Syria-Cilicia General ''Vali'',  to prevent further deportations and the chief secretary Kerovpe Papazian met the pasha in [[Aley]] in early June and delivered the message of Catholicos. Djemal Pasha immediately wired the Vali to not to deport more Armenians. With his efforts, Adana Armenians earned an exemption at a summer, while the rest of Cilician Armenians were being deported and hundreds of thousands of exhausted Armenian deportees of Western Anatolia were passing through the city. Armenian intellectuals that were [[Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915|deported on April 24th]] from Constantinople,  [[Rupen Zartarian]], [[Sarkis Minassian]], [[Nazaret Daghavarian]], [[Harutiun Jangülian]], and [[Karekin Khajag]] were kept in custody at the Vilayet Hall for few days. They could manage to have a meeting with the Catholicos at the [[Surp Asdvadzadzin Cathedral (Adana)|Cathedral]]; their last attempt for survival. Later in June, two prominent leaders, [[Krikor Zohrab]] and [[Vartkes Serengülian]] were also kept in the city on their final journey towards [[Diyarbakır]].<ref name="Kevorkian2">{{cite book| last=Kevorkian| first=Raymond| title=The Armenian Genocide: Complete History |location= London| publisher=I.B.Taurus & Co.Ltd. | year=2011| isbn=978-1848855618}}</ref>
[[File:Armenian children of Adana on the deportation train.png|thumb|200px|left|Children on the train]]
Minister of Interior, [[Talaat Pasha]], wanted to end the exemption of Adana Armenians and sent his second in command in the Ministry, Ali Munif, to the city in mid-August to resume the deportations. Ali Munif immediately deported 250 families from Adana who were accused of insurrection and executed many Armenians daily at Kuruköprü Square. Before the deportations of the rest, Vali could again manage the deportees to sell their assets. As almost a third of the city residents were selling their goods, the city seemed like a site for massive clearance sale. Deportations of 5000 Armenian families in eight convoys started on 2 September 1915 and continued until the end of October. 1000 craftsmen, state officers and the army personnel were exempted from deportations with their families. Unlike the deportees of other Vilayets, a good portion of Adana Armenians were sent to [[Damascus]] and further south, thus were avoided from the [[Deir ez-Zor Camps|death camps of Deir ez-Zor]] by the personal request of Djemal Pasha.<ref name="Kevorkian2" /> At the course of [[Armenian Genocide]], the death rate of the roughly 25,000 Adana Armenians that were deported through out 1915, were a lot lower than the deportees from other regions due to three main factors: No reports of direct killings in and around the city, a portion being deported to Damascus area and having money with them to manage their lives on the way and after arriving to their designated locations.

[[Armistice of Mudros]] that was signed on 30 October 1918 to end the [[World War I]], ceded the control of Cilicia to [[France]].

===Modern Turkey===
On 15 April 1923, just before the signing of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the Turkish government enacted the "Law of Abandoned Properties" which confiscated the properties of Armenians and Greeks who were not present on their property. Adana were one of the cities with the most confiscated property, thus [[muhacir]]s from Balkans and [[Crete]], migrants from [[Kayseri]] and [[Darende]] were relocated in the Armenian and Greek neighborhoods of the city. All types of modest properties, lands, houses and workshops were distributed to them. Large farms, factories, stores and mansions were granted to the Kayseri notables (e.g. Nuh Naci Yazgan, Nuri Has, Mustafa Özgür) and to local nationalists (e.g. Sefa Özler, Ali Münif) as promised at the [[Sivas Congress]] by Mustafa Kemal.<ref name="Cezmi3">{{cite web|url=http://birdeburadandinleyin.blogspot.com/2012/02/sabanclarn-imparator-olmas-cezmi.html|title=Sabancıların İmparator olması|access-date=30 April 2020}}</ref> Within a decade, the city had a sharp change demographically, socially and economically and lost its diversity by turning into a solely Muslim/Turkish city.<ref name="HrantAdana" /> Remaining Jews and Christians were hit by the heavy burden of the [[Varlık Vergisi|Wealth Tax]] in 1942, which caused them to leave Adana, selling their properties way under the value to families like [[Sabancı family|Sabancı]], who built their wealth on owning confiscated or undervalued properties. Forcible change in means of production led to abuse of wealth and harsh treatment of labor later in the 20th century, as the new possessors did not have the management attributes that the previous owners had.

The city was hit by a 6.2 magnitude [[earthquake]] ([[1998 Adana–Ceyhan earthquake]]) on 27 June 1998. The disaster killed 145 and left 1500 people wounded and many thousand homeless in the city and in Ceyhan district. The total economic loss was estimated at about US$1 billion.<ref name=ey>{{cite journal |url=http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/2005/5702/57020107.pdf |title=Stochastic Finite-fault Modeling of Ground Motions From the June 27, 1998 Adana–Ceyhan earthquake |author=Esref Yalcinkaya |journal=Earth Planets Space |volume=57|pages=107–115 |year=2005}}</ref>

National government is also the lawmaker, adjudicator and auditor of all the other levels of government and the neighborhood administration.

===Metropolitan municipality===
[[File:Orhan_Kemal_Cultural_Centre.JPG|thumb|[[Orhan Kemal Cultural Centre]] belongs to Çukurova Municipality Hall]]

Adana Municipality was incorporated in 1871 though the city continued to be governed by the [[muhtesip]] system until 1877 by the first mayor Gözlüklü Süleyman Efendi. The first modern municipal governance began with the second mayor [[Kirkor Bezdikyan]] and his successor Sinyor Artin. The roads were widened and paved with cobblestone, drainage canals and trenches were opened, more importantly the first municipal regulations were put in effect. After the foundation of the republic, major infrastructure projects were completed and the first planned neighborhoods were built north of the city. Turhan Cemal Beriker served as mayor and governor for 12 years during this period. With the completion of [[Seyhan Dam]] in 1956, the city saw explosive growth when then prime minister [[Adnan Menderes]] showed special interest in Adana; he initiated large-scale infrastructure projects like citywide underground sewer systems and rezoning of residential areas into roads and public spaces. From 1984 to the present, the cityscape has seen revolutionary changes with the revitalization of Seyhan river and the construction of large parks and boulevards.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.adana.bel.tr/adana-buyuksehir-belediyesi-tarihcesi-sayfa.html | title= Adana Büyükşehir Belediyesi Tarihçesi | language= tr | publisher= Adana Metropolitan Municipality | access-date= 26 July 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100731085938/http://www.adana.bel.tr/adana-buyuksehir-belediyesi-tarihcesi-sayfa.html | archive-date= 31 July 2010 | url-status= dead | df= dmy-all}}</ref>

Metropolitan Municipality Law was introduced in 1989 and the municipal governance was split between metropolitan municipality and district municipalities. Adana Municipality then became the Metropolitan Municipality and two new district municipalities were founded; Seyhan and Yüreğir. Karaisalı was annexed to the city in 2006, Çukurova and Sarıçam districts were founded in 2008 by the partitioning of Seyhan and Yüreğir districts respectively. On 3 February 2012, Karataş Municipal Council accepted a motion to amalgamate the municipality with Adana, hence [[Karataş]] will become the sixth district of the city after the transition process is completed.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://haberler.com/karatas-belediyesi-buyuksehir-e-baglanma-karari-3327420-haberi/| title= Karataş Belediyesi Büyükşehir'e Bağlanma Kararı Aldı.|language=tr|publisher=Haberler.com | access-date=3 February 2012}}</ref>

Metropolitan municipality consists of three organs; Metropolitan Council, Mayor and the Encümen. Each district municipal council elects one-fifth of their members to represent the district at the metropolitan council. Thus, metropolitan council consists of 35 councilors, ten from Seyhan district, eight from Yüreğir, eight from Çukurova, six from Sarıçam, two from Karaisalı and the metropolitan mayor who is elected directly by the voters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adana.bel.tr/belediye-meclisi-uyesi-sayfa.html|title=Adana Büyükşehir Belediyesi Meclis Üyeleri|language=tr|publisher=Adana Metropolitan Municipality|access-date=27 July 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915142641/http://adana.bel.tr/belediye-meclisi-uyesi-sayfa.html|archive-date=15 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Encümen, the executive committee, consists of ten members, five being metropolitan councilors and the other five are the directors at the metropolitan hall who are appointed to the Encümen by the metropolitan mayor.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.adana.bel.tr/encumen-uyeleri-sayfa.html | title= Adana Büyükşehir Belediyesi Encümeni | language= tr | publisher= Adana Metropolitan Municipality | access-date= 27 July 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100612153829/http://www.adana.bel.tr/encumen-uyeleri-sayfa.html | archive-date= 12 June 2010 | url-status= dead | df= dmy-all}}</ref>

===Districts===

[[File:Adana,_Reşatbey_Mh.,_Seyhan-Adana,_Turkey_-_panoramio_(51).jpg|left|thumb|Adana park view]]

City of Adana consists of the urban areas of the four metropolitan districts; Seyhan, Yüreğir, Çukurova, Sarıçam. Seyhan district is fully within the city limits whereas Yüreğir, Çukurova and Sarıçam districts have rural areas outside the city.

[[Seyhan|Seyhan district]], located west of Seyhan River, is the cultural and business center of the city. [[State road D400 (Turkey)|D-400]] state road (also called Turhan Cemal Beriker Boulevard within the city limits) divides the district into north and south. Seyhan's north of D-400, is economically the most developed part of the city. Hotels, cultural centers, commercial and public buildings line up along D-400. Old town, located south of D-400, is the market place where traditional and modern shops serve the residents. South of the old town is a low-income residential area.

[[Çukurova, Adana|Çukurova district]] is a modern residential district that lies north of the Seyhan district and south of the Seyhan Reservoir. The district was planned in the mid-1980s to direct the urban sprawl to low-fertile 3000 hectare land north of the city. Named as '''New Adana''', the project consisted of 200,000 homes including [[villa]]s along the lake shore and high-rise apartment buildings along the newly opened wide boulevards of Turgut Özal, Süleyman Demirel and Kenan Evren.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adana.bel.tr/yeni-adana-projesi-sayfa.html|title=Yeni Adana Projesi|language=tr|publisher=Adana Metropolitan Municipality|access-date=4 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915124243/http://adana.bel.tr/yeni-adana-projesi-sayfa.html|archive-date=15 September 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[Yüreğir|Yüreğir district]], located east of the river, consists mainly of low-income residential areas and large-scale industries. With the construction of new bridges on the river and the extension of metro line to the district, Yüreğir became increasingly important, Adana Court of Justice re-locating to the district and a 47.5-hectare health campus planned to be built in the Kazım Karabekir neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.haber01.com/SA%C4%9ELIK-KAMPUSU-YURE%C4%9EIR-E-10039.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181215122424/http://www.haber01.com/SA%C4%9ELIK-KAMPUSU-YURE%C4%9EIR-E-10039.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 15 December 2018 | title = Sağlık Kampüsü Yüreğir'e | publisher = haber01.com | access-date = 4 September 2010}}</ref> An extensive urban redevelopment plan is under effect in the district which will convert the neighborhoods of Sinanpaşa, Yavuzlar, Köprülü and Kışla into modern residential areas.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kentselhaber.com/V10/News/114515/Adana-da-kentsel-donusum-basladi | title = Adana'da Kentsel Donusum | publisher = Kentsel Haber | access-date = 18 August 2009 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110713143606/http://www.kentselhaber.com/V10/News/114515/Adana-da-kentsel-donusum-basladi | archive-date = 13 July 2011 | df = dmy-all}}</ref>

District of [[Sarıçam]] lies north and east of Yüreğir, consisting of former municipalities that were amalgamated to the City of Adana in 2008. Some of the large institutions of the city are in Sarıçam: Çukurova University, İncirlik Air Base and the Organized Industrial Region.

===Neighborhoods===
[[File:Adana_-_Dilberler_Sekisi_04.JPG|thumb|Adana Dilberler Sekisi]]
Neighborhoods ([[Mahalle]]) are administrative units within the district municipalities and are administered by the [[muhtar (title)|muhtar]] and the Neighborhood Seniors Council. Although elected by the neighborhood residents, the muhtar is not granted any powers, thus functions as an administrator of the national government. Muhtar can voice neighborhood issues to the district municipality and do have a seat at the Adana City Assembly, an umbrella organization for the coordination of public institutions in the city.<ref>{{citation|last=Koçberber|first=Seyit|year=2007|title=Yeni Belediye Yasası ile Mahalle Yönetimi|publisher=Sayıştay Journal|volume=56|pages=103–114|language=tr}}</ref> Despite the fact that neighborhood administration cannot provide social services nor have funding to increase the involvement of residents in neighborhood issues, many residents still like to identify themselves strongly with their neighborhoods especially in the low-income areas.

There are a total of 254 neighborhoods in the city. [[Seyhan#Neighborhoods|Seyhan has 99 neighborhoods]], 69 of them in the urban area and 30 are the neighborhoods of the former municipalities and the former villages that converted into neighborhoods. [[Yüreğir#Neighborhoods|Yüreğir has 99 neighborhoods]], 38 in the urban area and 61 rural. There are [[Sarıçam#Neighborhoods|29 neighborhoods in Sarıçam]], [[Çukurova, Adana#Neighborhoods|16 neighborhoods in Çukurova]] and 11 in Karaisalı district. A neighborhood population can range from 150 to 63,000.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://adana.bel.tr/ilce-mahalle-ve-muhtarliklar-sayfa.html| title = Adana Kenti İlçe Mahalle ve Muhtarlıklar| language = tr| publisher = Metropolitan Municipality| access-date = 27 July 2010| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100915124624/http://adana.bel.tr/ilce-mahalle-ve-muhtarliklar-sayfa.html| archive-date = 15 September 2010| df = dmy-all}}</ref> Some neighborhoods, especially in the Çukurova district, are very large—almost the size of a town—making resident access to muhtars difficult.

[[Tepebağ]], Kayalıbağ, Kuruköprü, Ulucami, Sarıyakup and Alidede are the historical neighborhoods of Adana. The planned neighborhoods of the republican era, [[Reşatbey]], Cemalpaşa, [[Kurtuluş, Seyhan|Kurtuluş]] and Çınarlı are the core of cultural life in the city. Güzelyalı, Karslılar and [[Kurttepe]] are the scenic neighborhoods overlooking the Seyhan reservoir.

==Economy==
Adana is one of the first industrialized cities, as well as one of the economically developed cities of Turkey. A mid-size trading city until the mid-1800s, the city attracted European traders after the United States, a major cotton supplier, was embroiled with its [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Cilicia farmers exported agricultural products for the first time and started building capital. By the start of the 20th century, factories almost all processing cotton, began to operate in the region. Factories were shut down and the economy almost came to a standstill in 1915, after the genocide of Armenians who ran most of the businesses in the city. Foundation of the republic, again accelerated the growth of industrialization by re-activation of closed plants and opening of state-owned ones. With the construction of [[Seyhan Dam]] and improvements in agricultural techniques, there was an explosive growth in agricultural production during the 1950s. Large-scale industries were built along D-400 state road and Karataş road. The service industry, especially banking, developed during this period.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aksiyon.com.tr/aksiyon/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=27748 | title = Bekleyen dev: Adana | publisher = Aksiyon | access-date = 2 February 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140104023320/http://www.aksiyon.com.tr/aksiyon/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=27748 | archive-date = 4 January 2014 | df = dmy-all}}</ref> Rapid economic growth continued until the mid-1980s and was accompanied by the rise of capitalistic greed which attracted movie makers to the region, filming income inequalities and the abuse of wealth.

Extensive [[neo-liberal]] policies by then Prime Minister [[Turgut Özal]] to centralize the country's economy, caused almost all Adana-based companies to move their headquarters to [[Istanbul]]. The decline in cotton planting in the region raised the raw material cost for manufacturing, thus the city has seen a wave of plant closures starting from the mid-1990s.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://haber.gazetevatan.com/Adanada_sanayi_tasfiye_oluyor/227177/2/Haber | title = Adana'da sanayi tasfiye oluyor.(Turkish) | publisher = Vatan Gazetesi | access-date = 9 March 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130616043138/http://haber.gazetevatan.com/Adanada_sanayi_tasfiye_oluyor/227177/2/Haber | archive-date = 16 June 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all}}</ref> Young professionals fled the city, contributing to Adana's status as the top [[brain drain]] city of Turkey. Financial and human capital flight from Adana further increased since 2002 with the current national governing party, [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]], due to neo-liberal centralization policies similar to Özal's and in addition, hidden policy not to invest in major projects in a city nonaligned with AKP version of [[conservatism]]. In 2010, unemployment in the city reached a record high of 19.1 percent.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.radikal.com.tr/Radikal.aspx?aType=RadikalDetayV3&ArticleID=1053946&CategoryID=80 | title = Adana'da 5 kişiden biri işsiz(Turkish) |publisher=Radikal Gazetesi | access-date=24 June 2011}}</ref> After 20 years of stagnation, the economy of Adana is picking up recently with investments in the tourism and service industry, wholesale and retail sectors and the city is re-shaping as a regional center.

Adana was named among the 25 ''European Regions of the Future'' for 2006/2007 by ''[[Foreign Direct Investment]]'' magazine. Chosen alongside [[İzmit|Kocaeli]] for Turkey, Adana scored the highest points for cost effectiveness against Kocaeli's points for infrastructure development, while Adana and Kocaeli tied on points for the categories of human resources and quality of life.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fdimagazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1544/EUROPEAN_CITIES___REGIONS_OF_THE_FUTURE_2006_07.html | title = European Regions of the Future | publisher = Foreign Direct Investment Magazine | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311042032/http://www.fdimagazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1544/EUROPEAN_CITIES___REGIONS_OF_THE_FUTURE_2006_07.html | archive-date = 11 March 2007 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Two-thirds of the residents of Adana live west of the Seyhan River, where the city was first founded. Urban sprawl east of the river is limited due to large institutions such as Çukurova University and Incirlik Air Base. Seyhan is the most diverse district, accommodating all ethnic groups.

The major ethnic groups in Adana are the Turks, Arabs and Kurds. Population growth slowed between 1885 and 1927 because of the [[Adana Massacre]] and the Armenian deportations, with the numbers only being replenished, rather than increased, by refugees brought in from the Balkans and Crete as part of the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Population Exchange of 1923]]. The first Turks moved to the city from Khorosan at the 8th century. In the early 14th century, several [[Oghuz Turks|Türkmen]] tribes were settled after Mamluks took control of Çukurova.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mekan360.com/360fx_hakkimizda_adanaataturkparki-hakkimizda.html |title=Adana Tarihi (Turkish) |publisher=Mekan360 |access-date=25 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714225530/http://www.mekan360.com/360fx_hakkimizda_adanaataturkparki-hakkimizda.html |archive-date=14 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> An Ottoman tax register from 1526 records 16 Turkish residential areas, but only one Armenian and none that were Greek, Jewish, Kurd or Arab.<ref name="Prophets page 39">''The Plain of Saints and Prophets: The Nusayri-Alawi Community of Cilicia'', Gisela Procházka-Eisl, Stephan Procházka, p. 39</ref> During the 17th century more Armenians and Greeks settled in the city; according to [[Evliya Çelebi]] there was also an Arab population.<ref name="Prophets page 39"/>

Arabs are concentrated in [[Karşıyaka, Adana|Karşıyaka]] quarter of Yüreğir. The demography of the city changed significantly in the 1990s after the massive migration of Kurds, many of them being forced to leave their villages in the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region|southeast]] at the peak of [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict#1984–1999: First insurgency|Turkey–PKK conflict]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/Radikal.aspx?aType=RadikalYazar&ArticleID=1025234&Yazar=SIRRI%20S%DCREYYA%20%D6NDER&Date=24.10.2010&CategoryID=97 |title=1990'larda kimine göre 2.5 milyon, kimine göre 4.5 milyon Kürt göç ettirildi.(Turkish)|work=Radikal |access-date=28 January 2012}}</ref> Kurds mostly live in southern neighborhoods of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.habername.com/haber/turkiyedeki-etnik-gruplarin-dagilim-raporu-1765.htm |title=Distribution of Ethnic Groups in Turkey (Turkish)|publisher=Habername |access-date=6 June 2008}}</ref> Conos, a tribe of [[Romani people]] of [[Romania]], settled in Adana during the [[Balkan Wars]].

Adana is home to a community of around 2,000 British and Americans serving at the [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik NATO Air Base]]. Before 2003, the community numbered up to 22,000, but declined when many troops were stationed in [[Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tumgazeteler.com/?a=4126756 |title=Amerikalı asker sayısı azaldı.

Similar to other cities on the Mediterranean and Aegean coasts, [[secularism]] is strong in Adana. Among the people with faith, the majority of the residents adhere to [[Sunni Islam]]. The majority of Turks, most of the Kurds and some of the Arabs are Sunni Muslim. Adana is also a stronghold of [[Alevism]], many Alevis having moved to the city from [[Kahramanmaraş]] after the [[Maraş Massacre|incidents in 1978]]. Arabs of Adana are mostly [[Alawites in Turkey|Alawi]], which is often confused with Alevis. Alawi Arabs are locally known as [[Nusayri]] or ''Fellah''. Arabs from [[Şanlıurfa Province]] are Sunni Muslims. There is a tiny community of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and a few [[Jews|Jewish]] families.

[[File:Büyük_Saat_(214879961).jpeg|thumb|130px|[[Büyük Saat|The Great Clock Tower]]]]

The golden age for the architecture of Adana was the late 15th and 16th centuries when [[Ramadanids|Ramadanid principality]] chose Adana as their capital. The city grew rapidly during that period with many new neighborhoods being built. Most of the historical landmarks of Adana were built during this period, thus [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk]] and [[Seljuqid]] architecture are dominant in Adana's architectural history. [[Stone Bridge (Adana)|Taşköprü]] is the only remaining landmark from the Roman-Byzantine era, and few public buildings were built during Ottoman rule. Adana is home to modern Turkey's historic Armenian architecture, which can be found behind the city's central modern buildings.

The first traces of settlement in the quarter of [[Tepebağ]], can be traced to the [[neolithic age]]. The quarter is next to the Taşköprü stone bridge, situated on a hill which gave its name Tepebağ (Garden on the hill). The city administration has launched a campaign to preserve the heritage of this area, particularly the Ottoman houses. Atatürk stayed in one of these houses on Seyhan Caddesi which now houses the [[Atatürk Museum (Adana)|Atatürk Museum]].

Several bridges cross the Seyhan river within the city, the most notable among them is the [[Taşköprü (Adana)|Taşköprü]], a 2nd-century [[Roman bridge]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.adanakultur.gov.tr/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFB0ED0AA5232E402F59FCBAD67E463149| title = Adana Taşköprü (Stone Bridge)| publisher=Governorship of Adana Tourism and Culture Department}}</ref> Currently used by pedestrians and cyclists, it was the oldest bridge in the world to be open to motorized vehicles until 2007. [[Demirköprü (bridge)|Demirköprü]] is a railway bridge that was built in 1912 as part of the [[Berlin-Baghdad Railway]] project. Regülatör bridge, at the southern section of the city, is a road bridge as well as a regulator for the river water. There are also three footbridges, Seyhan and Mustafakemalpaşa road bridges, the bridge of the [[Adana Metro|metro]] and the bridge of the [[List of highways in Turkey#O-50 – O-59|motorway]] spanning the river.

[[Büyüksaat|Büyük Saat (''The Great Clock Tower'')]], built by the local governor of Adana in 1882, is the tallest clock tower in Turkey rising {{convert|32|m|2|abbr=on}} high. It was damaged during French occupation, but was rebuilt in 1935, and its image can be found in the city's coat of arms. '''Kazancılar Çarşısı''' (Bazaar of Kazancilar), founded around the ''Büyük Saat''.

[[Ramazanoğlu Hall]] was built in 1495 during the reign of Halil Bey. A three-story building, made of stone and brick, it is one of the oldest examples of a house in Turkey. This hall is the Harem section, where the Ramadanid family lived. Selamlık section, where the government offices were, no longer exists.

'''Çarşı Hamam''' (''[[Turkish bath]] of the Bazaar'') was built in 1529 by Ramazanoğlu Piri Pasha and it is the largest [[Turkish bath|hamam]] in Adana. It is built with five domes and the inside is covered with marble. During the time it was built, water was brought from Seyhan River by water wheels and canals.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.kenthaber.com/akdeniz/adana/seyhan/Rehber/hamamlar/carsi-hamami---| title = Çarşı Hamamı(Turkish)| publisher = Kenthaber Kültür Kurulu| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091004173530/http://www.kenthaber.com/akdeniz/adana/seyhan/Rehber/hamamlar/carsi-hamami---| archive-date = 4 October 2009| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

'''Irmak Hamam''' (''Turkish bath of the River''), located next to Seyhan District Hall, was built in 1494 by Ramazanoğlu Halil Bey on the ruins of an ancient [[Roman bath]]. Its water comes from the river. Other historical [[Turkish bath|hamam]]s in the city are Mestenzade Bath and Yeni Bath.

'''''Mosques'''''
[[Sabancı Merkez Camii]], though not being historical, is the most visited mosque in Adana, as it is one of the largest mosques in the Middle East. Built in loyalty to [[Ottoman Architecture]], the mosque was opened in 1998 to a capacity of 28,500 prayers. The mosque has six minarets, four of them being 99 meters high. Its dome has a diameter of 32 meters and is 54 meters above the praying area. It is located on the west bank of Seyhan River at the corner of Seyhan Bridge and can be seen from a wide area.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabancivakfi.org/tr/?kalicieser/sos/adana/sabanci_merkez_cami/adana_sabanci_merkez_cami.html| title = Sabancı Merkez Camii| publisher=Sabancı Vakfı}}</ref>

[[Ulu Cami (Adana)|Ulu Cami]], a [[külliye]] built in 1541 during Ramadanid era, is the most interesting medieval structure of Adana with its mosque, [[madrasah]] and [[türbe]]. The mosque is of black and white marble with decorative window surrounds and it is famous for the 16th century [[Iznik]] tiling used in its inner space. The minaret is unique with the Mamluk effects it bears and with its orthogonal plan scheme.

[[Yağ Camii]] was originally built as the Church of St. James, then converted into a mosque by Ramazanoğlu Halil Bey in 1501.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.adonisistanbul.com/adonis/page.php?58| title=Adana| publisher=Adonis İstanbul| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311070341/http://www.adonisistanbul.com/adonis/page.php?58| archive-date=11 March 2010| df=dmy-all}}</ref> His successor Piri Mehmet Paşa added its [[minaret]] in 1525 and its [[madrasah]] in 1558. It is in the [[Seljuqid]] Grand Mosque style and has an attractive gate made of yellow stone.


'''Yeni Camii (New Mosque)''' was built in 1724 by Abdülrezzak Antaki, and is still known as Antaki Mosque by some. The influence of [[Mamluk architecture]] is visible. It is built in rectangular order and has an interesting stonework on its south walls.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kenthaber.com/akdeniz/adana/seyhan/Rehber/cami-ve-mescitler/yeni-cami| title=Yeni Camii| publisher=Kenthaber Kültür Kurulu| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005030129/http://www.kenthaber.com/akdeniz/adana/seyhan/Rehber/cami-ve-mescitler/yeni-cami| archive-date=5 October 2009| df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[File:Adana_Saint_Paul_Church_3040.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Paul Church (Bebekli Kilise)]]]]

In the 19th century, the city had four churches; two Armenian, one Greek and one Catholic. [[Saint Paul Church (Bebekli Kilise)]] is a Roman Catholic church that was built in 1870. It is located in the old town, close to 5 Ocak Square and currently serves the Roman Catholic and the Protestant communities.

Agios Nikolaos Greek Orthodox Church was built in 1845 in the Kuruköprü area and was converted into a museum in 1950. The church was restored to its original state and purpose in 2015 and is renamed [[Kuruköprü Monumental Church]].

Armenian Church on Ali Münif Street, at midpoint between [[Yağ Camii]] to [[Büyüksaat]], was converted into a [[Ziraat Bankası|Ziraat Bank]] branch during the Republican Era. Surp Asdvadzadzin Armenian Apostolic Church on the Abidinpaşa Street which served until 1915, was used as a movie theatre until 1970, and then demolished by the government and the Central Bank (Merkez Bankası) regional headquarters was built in its stead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cezmiyurtsever.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=191&Itemid=28|title=Kiikya Ermenileri|author=Cezmi Yurtsever|publisher=Cezmiyurtsever.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708133100/http://cezmiyurtsever.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=191&Itemid=28|archive-date=8 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Parks and gardens===
Adana has many parks and gardens.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://adana-bld.gov.tr/adanabld.asp?siteID=2&DilID=1&KatID=4&sayfaID=25 | title = Rekreasyon Çalışmaları | publisher = Adana Metropolitan Municipality | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140822193026/http://adana-bld.gov.tr/adanabld.asp?siteID=2&DilID=1&KatID=4&sayfaID=25 | archive-date = 22 August 2014 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Owing to the warm climate, parks and gardens are open all year long without the need of winter maintenance.

Recreational pathways on both banks of Seyhan river cross the entire city from south end to Seyhan Reservoir. Pathway then connects to Adnan Menderes Boulevard which follows the southern shores of Seyhan Reservoir, and the wide sidewalks of the boulevard extend the pathway to the west end of the reservoir. '''Dilberler Sekisi''' is the most scenic part of the pathway which is along the west bank, in between the old and the new dam. Recreational pathway along the north side of the Grand Canal goes from east end to west end of the city, crossing Seyhan river from old dam's pathway. Some sections of this pathway have not yet been completed. Once completed, within the city there will be almost {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=off}} of continuous recreational pathway connecting several parks.

[[File:Merkez Park Clock Tower.JPG|thumb|left|Clock Tower at [[Merkez Park]]]]
[[Merkez Park]] (Central Park) is a 33-hectare [[urban park]] that is located on both banks of Seyhan river, just north of Sabancı Mosque.

==Society and culture==

One of the major elements that define the society of Adana is the agriculture-based living and its extension, agriculture-based industrial culture. However, developments in industrial life, improvements in transportation, effects of communication and massive migrations have affected the unique culture of Adana. Similar to other cities in Turkey, the culture in some sections in the city are very distinct from each other.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://turkoloji.cu.edu.tr/CUKUROVA/makaleler/25.php | title = Adana Halk Kültürüne bakış |author=Erman Artun|publisher=Çukurova Üniversitesi Türkoloji Araştırmaları Merkezi}}</ref>

==Cuisine==
[[File:Adana kebab.jpg|thumb|[[Adana Kebab]]]]
Adana cuisine is influenced mainly from Yörük, Arabic and Armenian cuisine and the city has kept up its traditions. Spicy, sour and fatty dishes made of meat (usually [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]) and bulghur are common. Bulghur and flour are found in all Çukurova kitchens. In almost every home, red pepper, spices, tahini, a chopping block and pastry board can be found. The bulghur used in cooking is specific to Adana, made from dark colored hard wheat species with a preferred flavor.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.adanadan.biz/icerik.asp?ICID=73 | title = Adana Mutfağı(Turkish)|publisher=adanadan.biz}}</ref>

[[Adana Kebab]], called "Kebap" locally, is a kebab made from minced meat. Since it can be found at all kebab restaurants in Turkey and at most Turkish restaurants around the world, the Adana name still suggests kebab to many people. Adana Kebab is the most popular dining choice in Adana, although foods from other cultures are becoming increasingly popular. Besides many kebab restaurants, there are also many kebab serving vendors in the older streets of Adana.

[[File:yeni3.jpg|thumb|left|A glass of [[Şalgam]]]]
Adana Kebab is usually served with onion salad, green salad or with well-chopped tomato salad. [[Rakı]] and [[Şalgam]] usually accompany it as drinks. There are many varieties of salads typical to the city. Radish salad with tahini is popular and it is found only in the Çukurova region. [[Şalgam]] and pickle juice are the drinks of the winter and aşlama ([[licorice]] juice) is the choice of drink in summer.

One of the famous sweets of Turkey called "Sweet Sausage" originated from Adana. It was invented by Sir Duran O. during the First World War, around 1915 [[Seker Sucugu]].

Vegetable dishes are also popular in the city. Besides tomato paste, pepper paste is used in almost every dish. The city is also famous for its ''Şırdan'' a kind of home-made sausage stuffed with rice, and eaten with [[cumin]]; ''paça'', boiled sheep's feet; ''bicibici'' (pronounced as bee-jee-bee-jee) made from jellied starch, rose water and sugar is served with crushed ice and consumed especially in summertime. Furthermore, the city has a number of famous desserts, such as ''Halka Tatlı'', a round-shaped dessert, and ''Taş Kadayıf'', a bow-shaped dessert. Several types of fruit, including the [[apricot]], are native to this area.

===Nightlife===
[[File:Adana Rakı Festival2.jpg|thumb|180px|[[World Rakı Festival]]]]

The city was well known for its vibrant nightlife and many {{lang|tr|pavyons}} from the 1950s to the 1980s. Although some were family entertainment places, {{lang|tr|pavyons}} mostly functioned as adult entertainment clubs, similar to [[hostess club]]s of Japan, with live music, usually two-storey, a stage and a lounge with tables lined up at the main floor and private rooms at the upper floor.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/yasam/adana_artik_pavyonla_anilmiyor?tc=36&albumId=29729&page=22 | title = Adana artık pavyonla anılmıyor.(Turkish)|author=İbrahim Altay|publisher=Sabah Gazetesi|access-date= 11 February 2012}}</ref> The first {{lang|tr|pavyons}} opened in the city by 1942 with the arrival of English workers who worked on the Adana-[[Ulukışla]] road that was funded by the British Government to persuade Turkey to form a front in World War II.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/yasam/adana_artik_pavyonla_anilmiyor?tc=36&albumId=29729&page=19 | title = Adana'da bar-pavyon hayatı| author=İbrahim Altay|publisher=Sabah Gazetesi}}</ref> As Çukurova cotton was valued by the early 1950s, the surplus took landowners to the {{lang|tr|pavyons}} which opened more and more along the Seyhan river. In the 1960s, rapid industrialization brought more men to {{lang|tr|pavyons}} not only from the city, but from a wide region including Istanbul and Ankara, thus Adana was named ''Pavyon Capital of Turkey''. Many popular singers took the stage at and owe their fame to the {{lang|tr|pavyons}} of Adana.

{{lang|tr|Pavyons}} led the way to Western-style pubs and night clubs by the late 1980s with the socio-economic changes in Adana. The traditional entertainment district is Sular, near Central Station, but the pubs and clubs nowadays are spread throughout the city. The bigger clubs such as Life Legend, Uptown, Casara and Lava host world star singers at their elegant locations, mostly along the river and the lake. There are still two active {{lang|tr|pavyons}}, Afrodit and Maksim, but adult entertainment is directed mostly to what is known locally as tele-bars. Tele-bars are licensed as regular pubs, but function as places where bargirls entertain customers and usually hook with them afterwards. There are around 20 tele-bars mainly in the city center and around the old dam.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/yasam/adana_artik_pavyonla_anilmiyor?tc=36&albumId=29729&page=12 | title = Tele-bar Furyası (Turkish)|author=İbrahim Altay|publisher=Sabah Gazetesi}}</ref>

A hundred-year-long tradition of [[Adana Kebab|kebab]], liver and [[rakı]] in the Kazancılar Bazaar, with street music and dances, turned into a festival since 2010, with all-night entertainment. [[World Rakı Festival]], held the second Saturday night of December, attracts more than 20 thousand people to the old town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/haber/turkiye/rakicilar-bir-kez-daha-dunya-raki-gunune-hazirlaniyor |title=Rakıcılar bir kez daha Dünya Rakı Gününde buluşuyor |website=Cnnturk.com |date=2014-11-27 |access-date=2016-01-19}}</ref>

===Shopping===

Çakmak Street is the traditional shopping street that is located in the old town. Several attempts by the city to designate it as a pedestrianised street was unsuccessful because traffic flow could not be diverted to another street. There are several historical bazaars around Büyük Saat and Yağ Camii. Covered markets around Saydam street, Kilis and Mısır bazaars, were once a haven for shopping for quality foreign goods.

Ziyapaşa Boulevard is the street of elegance where expensive brands are located. The street runs from D-400 state road to the Central Train Station and the shops are concentrated towards the north end. The streets around Ziyapaşa and the streets of northern Adana, Özal, Demirel and Evren boulevards also have high-end shops.

There are four modern shopping malls in the city. Galleria was the first to be built in the early 1990s but did not become popular due to administrative issues. M1 and Carrefour malls were built during the late 1990s at the west end of the city. Recently opened Optimum Outlet is the first mall east of the river and is also the closest to the city center. The mall has a view of the river and the Merkez Park.

The city has large ethnic communities and education conducted in unofficial languages is only at institutions that do not get government support. Few of these institutions teach Arabic and Kurdish in Adana. The requirement for taking admission tests to high schools, universities and to a career in national public services led to the opening of more than one hundred [[cram schools]] ({{lang-tr|dershane}}) in the city since 1984 which added extra schooling and financial burden to residents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atonet.org.tr/yeni/index.php?p=235&l=1 |title=Dershaneler Dosyası (Turkish) |publisher=Ankara Chamber of Commerce |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072939/http://www.atonet.org.tr/yeni/index.php?p=235&l=1 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Adana road map.png|thumb|Map of the road network of Adana]]

Adana is on the major route that connects Europe to the Middle East. In the 16th century, Adana was a port city where ships could navigate on [[Seyhan River]] to the port just south of [[Stone Bridge (Adana)|Taşköprü]].

===Intercity transport===
[[File:Demirköprü railway bridge in Adana.png|thumb|left|[[Demirköprü (bridge)|Demirköprü]]]]
[[File:Adana Garı(Gece).jpg|thumb|[[Adana Railway Station]]]]

Şakirpaşa Airport lies just west of the old town. Together with the Central Bus Terminal and the Central Train Station, the three are the main locations for intercity transportation.

[[Adana Şakirpaşa Airport|Şakirpaşa Airport]], located within the city, is an international airport serving the Çukurova region. It is the sixth busiest airport in Turkey for passenger traffic, with 5.4 million passengers in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhmi.gov.tr/istatistik.aspx|title=DHMİ İstatistikler(Turkish)|publisher=DHMİ|access-date=7 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628154703/http://www.dhmi.gov.tr/istatistik.aspx|archive-date=28 June 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are international flights to major cities of Germany, to [[Beirut]], [[Jeddah]], [[Erbil]] and [[Nicosia]] ([[TRNC]]), frequent domestic flights to [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], [[İzmir]], [[Antalya]], [[Trabzon]], [[Bodrum]] and [[Van, Turkey|Van]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dunyagazetesi.com.tr/pegasus-adana-merkezli-diyarbakir-ve-van-ucuslarina-basladi_104937_haber.html |title=Pegasus, Adana merkezli Diyarbakır ve Van uçuşlarına başladı(Turkish) |publisher=Dünya Gazetesi |access-date=3 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108113436/http://www.dunyagazetesi.com.tr/pegasus-adana-merkezli-diyarbakir-ve-van-ucuslarina-basladi_104937_haber.html |archive-date=8 November 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[Turkish State Railways|Turkish State Railways (TCDD)]] runs five long-distance lines that connect Adana to Ankara, [[Kayseri]], [[Karaman]], [[Konya]] and [[Elâzığ]]. All these lines are served at the [[Adana Central railway station|Central Railway Station]]; some are also served at the other railway stations of the city—[[Şehitlik railway station|Şehitlik]] and [[Şakirpaşa Railway Station|Şakirpaşa]] stations at the west, [[Kiremithane railway station|Kiremithane]], [[İncirlik Railway Station|İncirlik]] and [[Yakapınar railway station|Yakapınar]] stations at the east. TCDD also runs three regional lines in Çukurova. [[Adana–Mersin Main Line|Adana-Mersin Line]] runs as a commuter train with 27 train times daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haberler.com/adana-mersin-hizli-tren-seferleri-basliyor-haberi/|title=Adana -Mersin Hızlı Tren Seferleri Başlıyor (Turkish)|publisher=Anadolu Ajansı|access-date=19 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123110119/http://www.haberler.com/adana-mersin-hizli-tren-seferleri-basliyor-haberi|archive-date=23 November 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Train service from Adana to [[Osmaniye]]&ndash;[[Islahiye]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/Upload/Files/ContentFiles/2010/bolgesel/islahiyeadana.htm|title=Islahiye-Adana Regional Train|publisher=Todd.gov.tr|access-date=2 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921042331/http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/Upload/Files/ContentFiles/2010/bolgesel/islahiyeadana.htm|archive-date=21 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and to [[Iskenderun]] run once daily. Regional trains stop at all city stations.

Although they lost their popularity as private airlines introduced inexpensive flights to major cities, coaches are still the major form of transportation to and from Adana. Adana has two intercity coach terminals providing service to almost all the cities and towns in Turkey. Coach companies that serve transportation to cities west of Adana, depart from '''Central Coach Terminal''', whereas the buses that serve cities east of Adana depart from '''Yüreğir Coach Terminal'''. A shuttle service is provided between the two terminals. Regional bus services from Adana to other places in Çukurova are plentiful and carried by bus and minibus co-operatives. Seasonal bus services to the high plains of Tekir, Bürücek and Kızıldağ run in summer, due to high demand of Adana residents escaping the heat of the city.

There is an extensive [[List of highways in Turkey#Motorways|motorway network (O50-O59)]] in the region, connecting Adana to as far as [[Erdemli]] in the west, [[Niğde]] in the north, [[Şanlıurfa]] in the east and [[Iskenderun]] in the south. Traffic runs smoothly throughout the day; driving can take as little as 40 minutes to Mersin and two hours to [[Gaziantep]].

===Local transport===
[[File:Metro map Adana.png|thumb|left|Map of the [[Adana Metro]]]]

Local transport in Adana is provided by '''Adana Transit Corporation''' (a division of the Metropolitan Municipality) and by [[dolmuş]] and bus co-operatives. Transit Corporation runs the metro and the municipal buses.

[[Adana Metro]] is a rail [[Rapid Transit|rapid transit]] system that extends {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=off}} from the north-west to the city center and then to Yüreğir.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.haberler.com/adana-hafif-rayli-tasima-sistemi-devreye-girdi-haberi/ | title = Adana Hafif Raylı Taşıma Sistemi Devreye Girdi. (Turkish)|publisher=Anadolu Ajansı| access-date=14 May 2010}}</ref> The metro serves 13 stations and can transport 21,600 passengers per hour one-way, a complete journey taking 21 minutes. The second line of the metro will run from Akıncılar to Çukurova University in the Sarıçam District. It will be {{convert|9.5|km|0|abbr=off}} long and will have seven stations. The project is contracted in January 2010 and the construction is expected to start after the funding is received from the Ministry of Transportation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adanamedya.com/news_detail.php?id=19121|title=Metronun İkinci Etap İhalesi Başlıyor.

Adana Transit Corporation serves the city with 229 buses, eight of them designed specifically for disabled users. Payment is collected by Kentkart Smartcard system. Six Bus Co-operatives (known as Can buses) serve the city with 411 buses. Kentkart and cash are accepted at these buses. 18 [[Dolmuş]] Co-operatives, with a total of 1,086 minibuses, provide service even to secondary streets. The only form of payment is by cash.

===Cycling and walkability===
The city of Adana is mostly flat and the warm weather makes it convenient for all year cycling and walking. The square shape of the city, city center's location right at the center of the square and the river running straight north–south in the middle of the city create further advantage for cycling as a means of transportation. Compact urban form due to dominance of high-rise buildings that are closely built, especially in Seyhan and Çukurova districts, make cycling from any end of the city to the city center to take less than 40 minutes. Despite all the advantages, car-oriented urban planning since the 1950s caused cycling to take a minor part in commuting to work or school. There are no bike lanes, but there are two bike paths, one along Fuzuli Street, the other along M. Kemalpaşa Boulevard—the latter not used by cyclists at all. Bicycles for commuting are currently only used by residents of low-income neighborhoods. [[Utility cycling|Bicycle use for transportation]] is low all over Turkey,<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.imo.org.tr/resimler/dosya_ekler/613d551d4160a60_ek.pdf?dergi=166 |title=Kentiçi ulaşımda bisiklet |author=Volkan Emre Uz, Mustafa Karaşahin |journal=Türkiye Mühendislik Haberleri |volume=429 2004/1|pages=41–46 |year=2004}}</ref> but when compared to cities like İzmir, [[Konya]] and [[Eskişehir]], Adana is less bicycle friendly.

Car-oriented urban planning became even more extreme since the 1980s, pedestrians seeing part of the sidewalks of the city's popular streets being converted into car-parking spots. The rise in car ownership not only caused high traffic, but also led to drivers parking their cars on the sidewalks. The city currently has no car-free squares or streets other than a few narrow ones. There are plans to convert both ends of Taşköprü to squares and widen the sidewalks in the old town where it is difficult to walk at the peddler-invaded narrow sidewalks. By far the most [[Walkability|pedestrian friendly]] street of the city is Turgut Özal Boulevard; Kenan Evren and other major streets in Çukurova district are also very convenient for walking.
