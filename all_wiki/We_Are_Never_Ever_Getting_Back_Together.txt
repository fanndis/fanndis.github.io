"'''We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] for her fourth studio album, ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012). Swift co-wrote the song with its producers, [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]]. The song was released as the [[lead single]] from ''Red'' on August 13, 2012, by [[Big Machine Records]]. Its lyrics depict Swift's frustrations at an ex-lover who wants to re-kindle their relationship. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine named the song the second best song of 2012 while it took the fourth spot in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s end-of-year poll. The song received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]. The song received a [[People’s Choice Award]] nomination for Favorite Song.

The song was an instant commercial success, becoming Swift's first number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in the United States, as well as the first song to hold the top spot for more than one week after a huge leap from a lower position since [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s two-week run at number one with "[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]", which rocketed from number 97 to the top spot in 2009.  Additionally, the song also topped the charts in Canada and New Zealand, while reaching the top five in Australia, Japan, South Korea, Ireland, Israel and the United Kingdom. It also topped the US Hot Country Songs for ten weeks, Swift's longest reign to date. A [[music video]] for the song was released in August 2012. To date, it has garnered over 615 million views on [[YouTube]]. A [[CD single]] was released in September 2012 by Swift's official store, [[Amazon.com]] and US [[Walmart]] stores.

==Background and release==
[[File:Taylor Swift GMA 2012.jpg|thumbnail|upright|left|Swift during her appearance on ''[[Good Morning America]]'', where she talked about "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", and also previewed the song]]
After writing ''[[Speak Now]]'' (2010) entirely solo, Swift opted to collaborate with different songwriters and producers for ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]''. Thus, she called [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], two songwriters and producers whose work she admired, to discuss a possible collaboration. The trio conceived the concept for "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" shortly after a friend of Swift's ex-boyfriend walked into the recording studio and spoke of rumors he heard that Swift and her former flame were reuniting. After the friend left, Martin and Shellback asked Swift to elaborate on the details of the relationship, which she described as "break up, get back together, break up, get back together, just, ugh, the worst". When Martin suggested that they write about the incident, Swift began playing the guitar and singing, "We are never ever......", and the song flowed rapidly afterwards. She described the process as one of the most humorous experiences she had while recording, and said the musical partners matched her expectations. An audio clip of her sarcastically speaking about breakups can be heard before the final chorus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/08/taylor-swift-reveals-new-album-red-drops-new-single-we-are-never-getting-back-together-abc-exclusive/|title=Taylor Swift Reveals New Album, 'Red,' Drops New Single, 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together': ABC Exclusive|last=Effron|first=Lauren|date=August 13, 2012|work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref>  The song is reportedly about Swift's ex, [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], as the two had broken up in January 2011 but had been seen on a date a few days later.<ref name="jg">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/05/taylor-swifts-we-are-never-ever-song-jake-gyllenhaal_n_1858318.html|title=Taylor Swift's 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together' Is Reportedly About Jake Gyllenhaal|last=Marcus|first=Stephanie|date=September 5, 2012|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[AOL Music]]|accessdate=April 8, 2013}}</ref> After the release of the [[music video]], more clues linking the song to Gyllenhaal emerged;<ref name="jg"/> with the actor in the video looking like Gyllenhaal,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2012/09/05/taylor-swift-single-jake-gyllenhaal-video/|title=New Proof Taylor Swift's Single Is About Jake Gyllenhaal — Source|last=Melas|first=Chloe|date=September 5, 2012|work=Hollywood Life|publisher=PMC|accessdate=April 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423152440/http://hollywoodlife.com/2012/09/05/taylor-swift-single-jake-gyllenhaal-video/|archive-date=April 23, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> giving her a scarf – as Gyllenhaal had reportedly done.

Upon initial release, the song received positive reviews from music critics. Robert Myers of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' felt that the song, while "good", was "not Swift at her best" and speculated that the decision to release it as a lead single was made for commercial reasons: "I doubt 'Never Ever' is even close to being the best song on ''Red''; it's a teaser, an indication to her fans of what's coming up. That sounds like commercial calculation of the worst kind, but I don't think it is. Swift's connection with her audience is possibly more important than her connection with her boyfriends. And there is one brilliant touch: the spoken bit that comes after the middle eight."<ref>{{cite web|last=Myers |first=Robert |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/08/hot_100_debuts_taylor_swift_future.php |title=Hot 100 Roundup: Taylor Swift's Kiss-Off To Country, Mumford & Sons' Folkie Rave, And More - New York - Music - Sound of the City |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=August 7, 2012 |accessdate=August 16, 2012}}</ref> Grady Smith of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' drew comparisons with [[Avril Lavigne]] and praised the "undeniable, instantly catchy hook".<ref name="Smith"/> While describing the song as "joyous", he nevertheless expressed concern that the song's "juvenile sensibilities" marked a regression following Swift's work on ''Speak Now''.<ref name="Smith"/> Jody Rosen of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that the song's "hooks, plural, have a zing that's more Stockholm than Nashville. But it's unmistakably Taylor: a witty relationship postmortem, delivered in inimitable girlie-girl patois. And this bit – "I'm just, I mean, this is exhausting. Like, we are never getting back together. Like, ever" – might be the most sublime spoken-word interlude in pop since [[Barry White]] died."<ref name=RollingStonereview>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/we-are-never-ever-getting-back-together-20120823|title=We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together &#124; Rolling Stone|author=Jody Rosen|date=August 23, 2012|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=August 26, 2012}}</ref>

''Rolling Stone'' named it the second-best song of 2012 in their end-of-year critics' poll: "It's like a Clash of the Titans: Swift, the world's hottest pop singer or songwriter, meets up with Max Martin, the Swedish maestro who's been the Dr. Evil of global trash-disco for more than a decade. To nobody's surprise, they cook up a perfect three-minute teen tantrum about country girls getting mad at high-strung indie boys, topping the charts faster than you can say, "This is exhausting." It's a stadium-chant breakup song that may have less to do with the actual guy it's about than with the massive raging-cowgirl audience Swift has led to the pinnacle of the music world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/50-best-songs-of-2012-20121205/taylor-swift-we-are-never-ever-getting-back-together-19691231|title=50 Best Songs of 2012: Taylor Swift, 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=December 13, 2012|date=2012-12-05}}</ref> The song was marked at number four on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's "Top 10 Songs of 2012 Playlist".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/12/04/listen-to-times-top-10-songs-of-2012-playlist/|title=Listen to TIME's Top 10 Songs of 2012 Playlist|date=December 4, 2012|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[CNN]], CNN, Time, Inc|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref> It was voted the sixth best single of 2012 by ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s 40th annual [[Pazz & Jop|Pazz & Jop critics' poll]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/pazznjop/singles/2012/ |title=Singles&nbsp;— All Votes |work=[[The Village Voice]] |publisher=[[Village Voice Media]] |accessdate=January 18, 2013}}</ref> "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" was named the 169th best song of 2010-2014 on [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']]'s "The 200 Best Tracks of the Decade So Far (2010-2014)" list.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/9466-the-200-best-tracks-of-the-decade-so-far-2010-2014/?page=2|title=The 200 Best Tracks of the Decade So Far (2010-2014)|last=Pitchfork Staff|date=August 18, 2014|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=October 18, 2017}}</ref> It also received a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] for the [[2013 Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taylorswift.com/news/114981 |title=Taylor Nominated For Three 2013 Grammy Awards |date=December 5, 2012 |author=Taylor Swift |publisher=TaylorSwift.com |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CsxIvST8?url=http://taylorswift.com/news/114981 |archive-date=December 13, 2012 |accessdate=December 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |author-link=Taylor Swift }}</ref> In 2019, ''[[Stereogum]]'' ranked the song as the 71st best song of the 2010s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/featured/best-songs-of-the-2010s-list/|title=The 200 Best Songs of the 2010s|website=[[Stereogum]]|date=November 5, 2019|accessdate=November 24, 2019}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked the song as the thirteenth-best female country song of the 2000s and 2010s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country-lists/a-real-fine-place-to-start-20-years-of-country-hits-by-women-927482/|title=A Real Fine Place to Start: 20 Years of Country Hits by Women|last=Shaffer|first=Claire|last2=Hudak|first2=Joseph|date=2019-12-17|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>

The video then segues into Swift going into her living room where her band is dressed up in animal costumes and Swift belts out the chorus of the song. The video then goes to a TV where Swift says "Like, ever." and then to the dining room where we see she returns to recounting the events of her relationship and receives a phone call from her ex who is calling her from a nightclub. Swift hangs up on him and he walks off screen into the nightclub. It then goes to the two in a truck having an argument then to them having a stroll in the park. Swift then runs off and we see her on the phone telling the person on the other line how she and her ex are not getting back together and her frustration of their entire relationship. The video then segues back to Swift's living room where a party is going on and her ex shows up unannounced trying to woo her back and she slams the door in his face. The video ends with Swift on her window ledge where she was at the beginning of the video, singing the last line of the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-taylor-swift-video-we-are-never-ever-getting-back-together-20120831,0,4916280.story|title=Video: Taylor Swift's 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together'|author=Randy Lewis|date=August 31, 2012|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref>
