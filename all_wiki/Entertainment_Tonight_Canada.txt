'''''Entertainment Tonight Canada''''' (branded as '''''ET Canada''''') is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[entertainment news]] television series, using the same format as the American entertainment newsmagazine ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''. ''ET Canada'' airs back-to-back with the  American version on most of Global's stations.

''ET Canada'' is hosted by longtime [[CIII-DT|Global Toronto]] entertainment host [[Cheryl Hickey]]. Reporters associated with the program include [[Roz Weston]], [[Sangita Patel]], Matte Babel, [[Paul McGuire (television host)|Paul McGuire]], and Carlos Bustamante.

==Reception==
The show was nominated for a [[Gemini Award]] in the best general interest series category in 2006.

==Spin-offs==

The show has also added three spin-off shows and an annual special. ''ET Canada: Behind the Scenes'' gives viewers a peek behind the curtain, showcasing the team behind the brand. There have been two installments to date, the first highlighting the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], debuted in October 2011.  The second brought fans to the [[Grammy Awards]], and documented the last minute-changes to the live red carpet show, in the wake of [[Whitney Houston]]'s shocking sudden death.

''ET Canada: Conversations'' highlights major international stars in extended long form interviews. The premiere episode featured [[Michael Bublé]] and aired in December 2011. Since then, [[One Direction]], [[Coldplay]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Nickelback]], [[Kylie Minogue]], and [[Carrie Underwood]] have all been subjects.

From 2008 through 2015, Global also produced coverage of [[New Year's Eve]] festivities from [[Queen Victoria Park]] and the [[Skylon Tower]] in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], co-branded as the ''ET Canada New Year's Eve Bash''. The special was previously a local broadcast on Hamilton's [[CHCH-DT|CHCH]] prior to its sale to [[Channel Zero Inc.|Channel Zero]], but was expanded and re-positioned as a nationally focused broadcast on Global with more prominent performers. The last telecast aired in 2015.

In June 2016, the show began infrequent additional live episodes on [[Facebook]]. On September 12, 2016 ''ET Canada Live'' began its daily broadcast online and on Global.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cartt.ca/article/%E2%80%98et-canada%E2%80%99-offers-facebook-users-daily-dose-entertainment|title= ‘ET Canada’ offers Facebook users a daily dose of entertainment|date=September 8, 2016|accessdate=March 29, 2017|work=Cartt.ca}}</ref><ref>[https://www.tvpassport.com/series/entertainment-tonight-canada/81262 Enrertainment Tonight Canada]</ref> Similar to ''[[Access Hollywood Live]]'' and ''[[TMZ#Branches|TMZ Live]]'', the show is shot during the afternoon in-studio and features viewer interaction.
