Woods, considered a moderate-to-liberal Republican, was attorney general from 1991 to 1999. In the 1980s, he was the first congressional chief of staff for the late U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and was a longtime friend and confidant of McCain's.

Grant has been elected to the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, which is limited to the top 500 trial lawyers in the world.

During the U.S. presidential election of 2016 he was the only Arizona Republican to have held high office who endorsed the Democratic candidate, [[Hillary Clinton]]. Regarding the two presidential candidates, he wrote, "Hillary Clinton is one of the most qualified nominees to ever run for president. Donald Trump is the least qualified ever. The stakes are too high to stand on the sideline. I stand with Hillary Clinton for president."

Woods delivered a eulogy at Senator McCain's funeral in 2018. 

[[Jon Kyl]] was appointed to succeed McCain, but said he would not run for re-election. He resigned in December 2018 and Governor [[Doug Ducey]] appointed [[Martha McSally]] to fill the  remainder of the term. A [[2020 United States Senate special election in Arizona|special election would be held in 2020]]. Woods considered running for the seat as a Democrat;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ktar.com/story/2300490/former-republican-arizona-ag-grant-woods-is-now-a-registered-democrat/ |title=Former Republican Arizona AG Grant Woods is now a registered Democrat |date=10 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mccains-former-chief-of-staff-says-hes-considering-senate-bid-as-a-democrat/2018/09/05/34e59e94-b14e-11e8-aed9-001309990777_story.html|title=McCain’s former chief of staff says he’s considering Senate bid as a Democrat|publisher=The Washington Times|date=September 5, 2018}}</ref> however, he announced on February 8, 2019 that he would not seek election to McCain's former senate seat in 2020 to avoid campaigning against other Democrats, stating that "Democrats are not the problem."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Squires|first1=Michael|title=Grant Woods says he won't run for U.S. Senate in 2020|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2019/02/08/grant-woods-says-he-wont-run-us-senate-2020/2812905002/|newspaper=Arizona Republic|date=February 8, 2019|accessdate=February 8, 2019}}</ref>
