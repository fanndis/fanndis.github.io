In his defence, Cunha said that opening the impeachment process was his constitutional duty as chamber president, and the decision to do so was based only on facts related to the budget laws. Cunha said further that he had no personal grievance against the Workers' Party and that Rousseff had signed six decrees for additional spending, which had increased the 2015 federal spending in non-compliance with the annual budget law and without approval of the Congress.<ref name = bargain/>

Rousseff denied any attempted deal to save Cunha in return for stopping her impeachment, and also denied agreements to interfere with the Council of Ethics in exchange for approval of the re-introduction of the CPMF tax (Provisional Tax on Financial Transactions), which was a wish from the government.<ref>{{cite web

===Comments by specialists and public opinion===
Professor Leonardo Avritzer of [[Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais]] told [[Agência Brasil]] in December 2015 that the political crisis was tied to Rousseff's inability to negotiate with Congress, and that Brazil's fragmented political system (and many [[List of political parties in Brazil|political parties]]) had created an ungovernable government. According to him, the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] confronting Rousseff after the 2014 elections calling for a recount and her disputed campaign accounts, culminating in the impeachment process, had been other major factors in the destabilization of the government. However, political scientist Luciana Veiga stated that, at that time, the process was benefiting Rousseff, who was now free from blackmail and could potentially reorganize her government. Veiga believed that Cunha could be removed from office and that the opposition would try to push the impeachment process of Rousseff in Congress for 2016 in order to mitigate the "electoral ecstasy" and "act of revenge" that were said to be the cause of the impeachment attempt.<ref name= "Terra">{{cite web |url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/politica/impeachment/impeachment-dependera-do-futuro-de-cunha-na-camara-dizem-cientistas-politicos,4693873b8bb811e15bb298eaea0a3fecd25v5z3i.html

===Fiscal responsibility crimes===
Rousseff issued six unnumbered decrees in 2014 and 2015 that allocated funds to social programs, allegedly for political purposes, without authorization from Congress. These totaled R$18.5&nbsp;billion (US$6.9&nbsp;billion) and were contracted in official financial institutions with neither the necessary legislative authorization, nor targets which complied with the Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal (Fiscal Responsibility Law) and the {{Interlanguage link multi|Annual Budgetary Law|pt|3=Lei orçamentária anual}}. To obtain these additional credits, the target of 2014 was reduced by the end of 2014 by R$67&nbsp;billion (US$25&nbsp;billion) at the request of the president. Rousseff allegedly committed similar crimes of fiscal irresponsibility in 2015. She further issued such decrees in the years 2014 and 2015 to authorize the opening credit precisely to, purportedly, allow the provision of additional resources despite it being known that the primary ''superavit'' target in the budget forecast was not being fulfilled, and would not be fulfilled, hence disregarding the Annual Budgetary Law and the Federal Constitution.<ref>Request for impeachment, pg 13–21</ref>

==="Fiscal pedaling"===
In 2011 and 2014, Rousseff's government is said to have held illegal credit operations, using funds from the state-owned banks [[Caixa Econômica Federal]] and [[Banco do Brasil]] to finance social programs without officially declaring loans from either of those banks, an example of [[fiscal pedaling]]. These transactions were reported in 2015 by the TCU and, according to the report, were undertaken in order to improve the government's chances of re-election.<ref>Request for impeachment, pg 22–38; pg.38: ''Com efeito, como evidenciado em sede de Representação Criminal encaminhada à  Procuradoria Geral da República, ao fazer empréstimos proibidos e não os contabilizar, a Presidente da República poderia até, em tese, ser inclusa nas iras do artigo 299 do Código Penal, que tipifica a falsidade ideológica. A situação resta ainda mais grave, quando se constata que todo esse expediente fora intensificado durante o ano eleitoral, com o fim deliberado de iludir o eleitorado. Daí ser possível falar em verdadeiro estelionato eleitoral.''
<br />(''In fact, as evidenced by a Criminal Representation sent to the Office of the Attorney General, by illegally taking loans and not accounting for them, the [actions of the] President could, in theory, be included under Article 299 of the Penal Code, which typifies identity fraud. The situation is even more serious if one observes that this procedure was intensified during election year, with the deliberate purpose of deceiving the electorate. Hence it is possible to talk about electoral fraud.'') See talk page for translation discussion.</ref>

Caixa Econômica Federal and Banco do Brasil operated federal social programs under a government contract at this time. The government would pass the funds necessary to finance the programs through the {{Interlanguage link multi|Secretariat of the National Treasury|pt|3=Secretaria do Tesouro Nacional}} every month. They were obliged to transfer the equivalent values for the equalization of interest rates, expenditures and legal transfers covered under the contract. But the government had not made these reimbursements, and the contracted banks instead funded the programs using their own capital, capital that the government was obliged to reimburse them for, although no loans had been officially filed. The Fiscal Responsibility Law (Article 36) prohibits members of the federal government who control state financial institutions from borrowing from those institutions that they control.<ref name= "SL101"/> The total balance of these liabilities by the end of August 2014 was R$1.74&nbsp;billion (US$740&nbsp;million). Of the total R$7.8&nbsp;billion (US$2.9&nbsp;billion) spent on subsidies in these programs between 2009 and 2014, only R$1.6&nbsp;billion (US$590&nbsp;million) was transferred by the Government.<ref>Request for impeachment, pg 25–27</ref>

At the end of 2014, Rousseff sent the Congress [[Bill (law)|PLN]] 362014, to change the {{Interlanguage link multi|Budgetary Directives Law|pt|3=Lei de diretrizes orçamentárias}} in order to modify the rules of the primary ''superavit'' (surplus), and hence showing her knowledge of the fiscal pedaling by taking steps to normalize the accounts.<ref>Request for impeachment, pg 45</ref>

In the first day of the Brazilian legislative year 2016 (2 February), Rousseff spoke in [[National Congress of Brazil|Congress]]. That unusual personal attendment to Congress to inform her government's legislative agenda has served to mitigate the signs that 2016 should be, once again, a year of political battlefield.

The President discourse was marked by calls for support new taxes to overcome the crisis, boos from Rousseff opponents, as well as criticism even from her allies. Received by the then Presidents of [[President of the Federal Senate (Brazil)|Senate]] ([[Renan Calheiros]]), [[Supreme Federal Court]] ([[Ricardo Lewandowski]]), and [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]] ([[Eduardo Cunha]]), Rousseff kissed the faces of the first two, and with Cunha - who accepted her impeachment request - only complimented with a quick handshake.

A banner held by deputies [[Eduardo Bolsonaro]] and [[Jair Bolsonaro]] (who would be elected President of Brazil in 2018) had written the phrase: "Brazil can't tolerate you anymore. Get out".<ref>{{Cite web

[[File:Michel Temer Ministerial meeting.jpg|thumb|280px|Michel Temer in his first ministerial meeting on 13 May 2016]]

In the Brazilian political system, the president and vice president run on the same ticket but have constitutionally separate terms. Michel Temer, who was president of the Chamber during the [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] presidency from 1995 to 2003, is a member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), which announced it was running against the Rousseff government in March 2016.<ref>{{Cite web

In March 2017, former [[Odebrecht|Odebrecht Group]] CEO [[Marcelo Odebrecht]], as part of a [[plea bargain]] for leniency, said before the Superior Electoral Court Judge Herman Benjamin, that PMDB and PT [[slush fund]]s received payments of R$150&nbsp;million (US$48&nbsp;million) from Odebrecht's construction conglomerate for the 2014 re-election campaign in 2014, and that at least a third of the money originated from corrupt practices. Odebrecht was jailed in June 2015 for corruption uncovered by Operation Car Wash.<ref>{{cite news

===Public opinion===
A CNT/MDA poll published on 8 June 2016, indicated that only 11.3% of Brazilians approved while 28% disapproved of the acting government of President Temer. For 30.2% of respondents, Temer's government is ordinary, while 30.5% gave no answer. The survey also showed that 46.6% of Brazilians believed that the corruption in Temer's government could equal that in Rousseff's government. 28.3% believed that corruption could be less and the remaining 18.6% estimated that it could be even greater. Regarding the lawfulness of the process of impeachment, 61.5% agreed with the conduct of the process, 33.3% answered negatively and 5.2% didn't answer. CNT/MDA polled 2,002 people in 137 municipalities in 25 federative units between 2 and 5 June. CNT/MDA reported the poll as 95% reliable with a 2% margin of error.<ref>{{cite web

An [[Ipsos]] poll in early July 2016 investigated what outcome most Brazilians were hoping for, with mixed results: 16% of Brazilians preferred Temer in office; 20% said that Rousseff should be acquitted and finish her four-year mandate; and 52% said that whoever assumed the presidency should call new elections for president. However, holding new elections would only be possible with a 3/5 majority in both houses of Congress. Alternatively, both could have been removed from office, depending on the outcome of a lawsuit filed in the Superior Electoral Court by the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]], party of Aécio Neves, the defeated candidate in the 2014 presidential elections, whose suit alleged electoral crime by the political alliance of Rousseff-Temer involving donations from the companies implicated in Operation Car Wash.<ref>{{cite web

==Impeachment trial==
After the Senate vote to suspend Rousseff's presidential powers and duties, subsequent procedure required new citations, new defense, appointing witnesses and producing evidence for preparation of the final report, which first of all had to be reviewed by a committee and then the entire Senate, each requiring a simple majority to confirm that the charges were well-founded. After that, the debate over conviction or acquittal began, requiring a two-thirds majority of the Senate, which proceedings were chaired by [[Ricardo Lewandowski]]. This eventually resulted in Rousseff's permanent removal, the appeal of which was denied by the court.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:José Eduardo Cardozo CEI2016.jpg|thumb|200px|<center>José Eduardo Cardozo, lawyer who represented Rousseff</center>]]

His 370-page filing said that the president had not committed the alleged crimes and that Rousseff's impeachment "was solely and exclusively aimed at ending Operation Car Wash." Cardozo submitted as evidence transcripts of a recorded telephone conversation between {{Interlanguage link multi|José Sérgio Machado|pt|Sérgio Machado (político e empresário)}}, former president of Petrobras subsidiary [[Transpetro]], and Senator [[Romero Jucá]], an influential politician in the PMDB. Published by the newspaper [[Folha de S. Paulo]], the conversation convinced Cardozo that the two were trying to prevent the investigation from widening, due to the risk to both of being caught up in it, and suggested that Rousseff's impeachment could have been part of an agreement aimed at preventing (and possibly later stopping) the Operation Car Wash investigations.{{citation needed|reason=allegations of criminality require a solid reference even though sourced.|date=May 2017}} Jucá's lawyer said that his client never thought to interfere in Operation Car Wash and that the dialogue did not suggest that he did.<ref>{{cite web

Anastasia ruled against recorded telephone conversation between Machado and Jucá being introduced into evidence, ruling it irrelevant since the charges against Rousseff were fiscal responsibility crimes and the recording was only an informal conversation and proved nothing in law. Cardozo protested that the facts cited in the recording were a primary question of the investigation, and announced on 3 June that he would appeal the decision to the president of the Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web

At 2 June meeting, the Committee had established that eight witnesses would be heard for each of the six supplemental budget decrees against Rousseff, both for the prosecution and for the defense, i.e. a total of 48 witnesses for each side, with each decree considered separately. Nunes contended that the six decrees should be considered a single entity, to be added to the so-called "tax pedaling", so that the number of witnesses to be heard could be reduced to 16.<ref>{{cite web

On 8 June, the committee accepted a request by both defense and prosecution reducing to four the number of supplemental budget decrees to be considered in the trial. Thus, the number of witnesses in the process was reduced to forty. Since each charge entitled eight witnesses, the defense of Rousseff could introduce up to 32 witnesses for the four decrees and eight for the "tax pedaling" charge. The prosecution would be entitled to the same number. The decision to reduce the charges was supported by a report produced at the House of Representatives, which considered that two decrees signed by Rousseff without approval of Congress were neutral from a fiscal perspective, once the primary sources and financial expenses listed in the documents were equivalent.<ref>{{cite web

Oliveira, procurator of the [[Federal Court of Accounts]] (TCU), said that in April 2015 TCU identified the recidivist fiscal misconduct, so-called "tax pedaling", immediately rejected. There was no previous understanding to modify the rules and the consensus, and every time that the TCU has ruled, it had disapproved the conduct adopted by Rousseff.<ref name= JMO/> He reiterated that the President acted intentionally to borrow from public banks, and acted "coercively" in these operations. This, in his opinion, was serious, and forbidden by the fiscal responsibility law. The practice, he said, went on for years, including throughout the year 2015.<ref>{{cite web

Prosecution witnesses Tiago Alves de Gouveia Lins Dutra and Leonardo Rodrigues Albernaz, both TCU auditors, testified on 13 June. Tiago Dutra said that Rousseff created overdrafts with public banks in 2015 that had already observed in 2014. A TCU report indicated a delay of eleven months in transferring to banks an amount of R$2.6&nbsp;billion, and five months in transferring R$3&nbsp;billion related to the operations. For principal and interest, until December 2015, the government have been paid R$15&nbsp;billion, of which R$2&nbsp;billion were related to interest.<ref>{{cite web

Both, Wagner Vilas Boas and Iara Pinho, said they could not give an opinion on the compatibility of the signed supplementary decrees and the current fiscal target since their functions don't allow them to conduct an analysis of the achievement of the target. Concerning these statements, the prosecution pointed out that the technicians were not able to explain specifically the possible crime of responsibility.

Former [[Ministry of Agrarian Development (Brazil)|Ministry of Agrarian Development]] [[Patrus Ananias]] testified on 27 June.

On 28 June were heard {{Interlanguage link multi|Maria Fernanda Ramos Coelho|pt}}, former Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Agrarian Development; [[Aldo Rebelo]], former Ministry of Defence; [[Luís Inácio Adams]], former [[Attorney General of Brazil|General's Office attorney]]; and Antônio Carlos Stangherlin Rebelo, who was responsible for analysis of supplemental credits on the [[National Justice Council]]. Maria Fernanda said that the delay in the payment of interest rate equalization of the Plan Safra (government's plan to support agriculture) for 2015, did not configure a credit operation, since the non-compliance was not subject to penalty payment in the contract terms. According to former Secretary, the values were only monetarily adjusted. The prosecution lawyer Janaína Paschoal rejected the claims of Maria Fernanda and said that the remuneration per {{Interlanguage link multi|interest rate SELIC|pt|3=taxa SELIC}} (a benchmark interest rate of the Brazilian economy) is a proof that there was a credit operation. The prosecution reiterated that this statement confirmed the infringement materially, she concluded.<ref>{{cite web

The witness hearings ended on 29 June. A total of 44 witnesses were heard, six convened by prosecution and 38 by the defense.
At the end of the witnesses hearings phase, both the prosecution and the defense lawyers said they were confident of their respective theses. Prosecution lawyer Janaína Paschoal criticized the actions of Rousseff's defense because of the large number of witnesses called. Defense lawyer José Eduardo Cardozo also expressed confidence, but said that the process had political undertones and that this might interfere with the result. He also pointed out that some senators refused to question the witnesses because there was already a predetermined outcome prior to the completion of work.<ref name= "final hearings"/>

====Auditors' report====
The board of experts designated at 13 June session, by committee president Raimundo Lira, was heard on 5 July. This board had audited the documents, as requested by the defense and authorized by Lewandowski. They found that the delays in the transfer of payments to the public banks did indeed constitute loans. However, they avoided considering whether the President intended this and said that this judgement should be made by the senators. Also heard were the assistant to the prosecution, Selene Péres Nunes and the assistant to the defense, Ricardo Lodi Ribeiro. Nunes said that there was willful misconduct by the President, since the operations had been concealed via the accounting and the fact that the government had later issued a [[provisional measure]] allowing payment of the debts.<ref>{{cite web

====Cross-examination of witnesses====
On 25 August, the prosecution called two witnesses, Julio Marcelo de Oliveira, procurator of the TCU, and author of the report recommending the rejection of the 2014 accounts, and Antonio Carlos Costa D'avila Carvalho Júnior, auditor of the TCU. Oliveira was questioned as an expert, not as an evidentiary, witness, as ruled by Lewandowski, after Cardozo accused Oliveira of making a report based on a biased understanding. He denied this, saying that he only fulfilled a recommendation to adopt a "less tolerant" rule that came from TCU. Oliveira asserted that Rousseff broke budget laws in 2014 and also in 2015. In his status as informant, his complaints could not be considered as evidence, but as technical information.

The next prosecution witness questioned, D'Avila Carvalho, asserted that Rousseff "disguised" the accounting and was responsible for delaying transfers to state banks. Cardozo tried to disqualify this witness, accusing him of bias because he had helped Oliveira to draft the TCU report, "clearly an unethical situation that violates the principle of impartiality." However, Lewandowski overruled this motion.<ref>{{cite web

[[File: Dilma Rousseff impeachment trial.jpg|thumb|left|300px|<center>Impeachment trial begins on 25 August 2016</center>]]

Cross-examination continued the next day when the defense called six witnesses:

*Esther Dweck, former Secretary of Federal Budget
*Ricardo Ribeiro Lodi, Law professor at the [[State University of Rio de Janeiro]].

Barbosa said that decrees provide more leeway for the administration of funds when the budget is limited, and are used by experienced officials.

She also compared the effort to impeach her to the torture she endured after agents of the military dictatorship arrested and jailed her as an [[Dilma Rousseff#Guerrilla activity, 1968–69|urban guerrilla]]. Rousseff called the impeachment proceedings a new type of coup and evoked the breakdown of Brazilian democracy in the 1960s before the military coup. Senator [[Ana Amélia Lemos]] in reply expressed respect for her personal history but said that the senators were not there to judge her biography, but the actions of her government. She said Rousseff had broken the law by manipulating the budget to hide economic problems.<ref>{{cite web

====Senate vote====
The Senate found President Dilma Rousseff guilty of responsibility crimes and administrative misconduct regarding the federal budget and removed her from office after a vote of 61–20 on 31 August 2016.<ref name="auto"/> In a separate vote on whether she should be barred from public office for eight years, senators voted 42-36 in favor. A two-thirds majority of the votes (54 of 81 senators) would have been needed, so she will be able to run for any public office again in the near future.<ref>
