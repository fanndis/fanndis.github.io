{{French language}}

'''French''' ({{lang|fr|français}} {{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃sɛ|}} or {{lang|fr|langue française}} {{IPA-fr|lɑ̃ɡ fʁɑ̃sɛːz|}}) is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]]. It descended from the [[Vulgar Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire]], as did all Romance languages. French evolved from [[Gallo-Romance]], the Latin spoken in [[Gaul]], and more specifically in Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other [[langues d'oïl]]—languages historically spoken in northern [[France]] and in southern [[Belgium]], which French ([[Francien]]) largely supplanted. French was also [[substratum|influenced]] by native [[Celtic languages]] of Northern Roman Gaul like [[Gallia Belgica]] and by the ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]]) [[Frankish language]] of the post-Roman [[Franks|Frankish]] invaders. Today, owing to France's [[French colonial empire|past overseas expansion]], there are numerous [[French-based creole languages]], most notably [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]]. A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as '''Francophone'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> in both English and French.

==History==
{{Main|History of French}}
French is a [[Romance language]] (meaning that it is descended primarily from [[Vulgar Latin]]) that evolved out of the Gallo-Romance dialects spoken in northern France. The language's early forms include Old French and Middle French.

=== Vulgar Latin in Gallia ===
{{see also|Gallo-Romance}}

Due to Roman rule, Latin was gradually adopted by the inhabitants of Gaul, and as the language was learned by the common people it developed a distinct local character, with grammatical differences from Latin as spoken elsewhere, some of which being attested on graffiti.<ref name=Adams/> This local variety evolved into the Gallo-Romance tongues, which include French and its closest relatives, such as [[Arpitan language|Arpitan]].

The evolution of Latin in Gaul was shaped by its coexistence for over half a millennium beside the native [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] [[Gaulish language]], which did not go extinct until the late 6th century, long after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]].<ref name=Helix>{{cite book|author=Laurence Hélix| title=Histoire de la langue française|isbn=978-2-7298-6470-5|publisher=Ellipses Edition Marketing S.A.|page=7 | year=2011}}</ref> The population remained 90% indigenous in origin;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lodge |first1=R.

At the time of the collapse of the Empire, this local elite had been slowly abandoning Gaulish entirely, but the rural and lower class populations remained Gaulish speakers who could sometimes also speak Latin or Greek.<ref name=Mufwene>Mufwene, Salikoko S. "Language birth and death." Annu. Rev. Anthropol. 33 (2004): 201-222.</ref> The final language shift from Gaulish to Vulgar Latin among rural and lower class populations occurred later, when both they and the incoming Frankish ruler/military class adopted the Gallo-Roman Vulgar Latin speech of the urban intellectual elite.<ref name=Mufwene/>

The Gaulish language likely survived into the 6th century in France, despite considerable Romanization.<ref name=Helix/> Coexisting with Latin, Gaulish helped shape the [[Vulgar Latin]] dialects that developed into French,<ref name=Mufwene/><ref name=Helix/> with effects including loanwords and [[calque]]s (including ''oui'',<ref name="Matas" /> the word for "yes"),<ref name=Savignac/><ref name="Matas" /> sound changes shaped by Gaulish influence,<ref>Henri Guiter, "Sur le substrat gaulois dans la Romania", in ''Munus amicitae.

=== Old French ===
{{Main|Old French}}The beginning of French in Gaul was greatly influenced by Germanic invasions into the country. These invasions had the greatest impact on the northern part of the country and on the language there.<ref name=":02">{{cite web|url=https://www.pin1.harvard.edu/cas/login;jsessionid=BB951275000142B63AD17A43564E70A5?service=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pin1.harvard.edu%2Fpin%2Fauthenticate%2FHUL_ACC_MGMT_SVC%3Bjsessionid%3DBB951275000142B63AD17A43564E70A5|title=HarvardKey - Login|website=www.pin1.harvard.edu}}</ref> A language divide began to grow across the country. The population in the north spoke {{Lang|fr|[[langue d'oïl]]}} while the population in the south spoke {{Lang|fr|[[langue d'oc]]}}.<ref name=":02"/> Langue d'oïl grew into what is known as Old French. The period of Old French spanned between the 8th and 14th centuries. Old French shared many characteristics with Latin. For example, Old French made use of different possible word orders just as Latin did because [[Old French#Nouns|it had a case system that retained the difference between nominative subjects and oblique non-subjects]].<ref name="auto">{{Cite journal|last1=Lahousse|first1=Karen|last2=Lamiroy|first2=Béatrice|date=2012|title=Word order in French, Spanish and Italian:A grammaticalization account|journal=Folia Linguistica|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|doi=10.1515/flin.2012.014|s2cid=146854174|issn=1614-7308}}</ref> The period is marked by a heavy [[superstrate]] influence from the Germanic [[Frankish language]], which non-exhaustively included the use in upper-class speech and higher registers of [[V2 word order]],<ref>Rowlett, P. 2007.

=== Middle French ===
{{Main|Middle French}}
Within Old French many dialects emerged but the [[Francien language|Francien]] dialect is one that not only continued but also thrived during the Middle French period (14th–17th centuries).<ref name=":02" /> Modern French grew out of this Francien dialect.<ref name=":02" /> Grammatically, during the period of Middle French, noun declensions were lost and there began to be standardized rules. [[Robert Estienne]] published the first Latin-French dictionary, which included information about phonetics, etymology, and grammar.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Charles de Bovelles, 1479–1553: An Intellectual Biography|last=Victor|first=Joseph M.|publisher=Librairie Droz|year=1978|pages=28}}</ref> Politically, the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]] (1539) named French the language of law.

=== Modern French ===
During the 17th century, French replaced [[Latin]] as the most important language of diplomacy and international relations ([[lingua franca]]). It retained this role until approximately the middle of the 20th century, when it was [[International English|replaced by English]] as the United States became the dominant global power following the [[Second World War]].<ref name="andaman.org">[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm The World's 10 Most Influential Languages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312042140/http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm |date=12 March 2008 }} ''Top Languages''.

During the [[Grand Siècle]] (17th century), France, under the rule of powerful leaders such as [[Cardinal Richelieu]] and [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], enjoyed a period of prosperity and prominence among European nations. Richelieu established the [[Académie française]] to protect the French language. By the early 1800s, Parisian French had become the primary language of the aristocracy in France.

Near the beginning of the 19th century, the [[French government]] began to pursue policies with the end goal of eradicating the many minorities and regional languages ([[patois]]) spoken in France. This began in 1794 with [[Henri Grégoire]]'s "Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalize the use of the French language". When public education was made [[Compulsory education|compulsory]], only French was taught and the use of any other (patois) language was punished. The goals of the [[French school system|Public School System]] were made especially clear to the French-speaking teachers sent to teach students in regions such as [[Occitania]] and [[Brittany]]. Instructions given by a French official to teachers in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Finistère]], in western [[Brittany]], included the following: "And remember, Gents: you were given your position in order to kill the Breton language".<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=L'Imposture.

Among the historic reformers of French orthography, such as [[Louis Maigret (grammarian)|Louis Maigret]], Marle M., [[Marcellin Berthelot]], [[:fr:Philibert Monet|Philibert Monet]], [[Jacques Peletier du Mans]], and [[Antoine Baudeau de Somaize|Somaize]], nowadays the most striking reform is proposed by [[Mickael Korvin]], a Franco-American linguist of Hungarian origin who wants to eliminate accents, silent letters, double letters and more.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/les-accents-sont-ils-les-dictateurs-de-la-langue_1098075.html |title=Les accents, dictateurs de la langue? |magazine=L'Express |date= 2012-03-27|accessdate=2018-06-19}}</ref>

Along with Luxembourgish and German, French is one of the three official languages of [[Luxembourg]], where it is generally the preferred language of business as well as of the different public administrations. It is also the official language of [[Monaco]].

At a regional level, French is acknowledged as official language in the [[Aosta Valley]] region of Italy where it is the first language of approximately 30% of the population, while French dialects remain spoken by minorities on the [[Channel Islands]].

French is the second most common language in Canada, after English, and both are official languages at the federal level. It is the first language of 9.5 million people or 29% and the second language for 2.07 million or 6% of the entire population of Canada.<ref name="Qu'est-ce que la Francophonie"/> French is the sole official language in the province of [[Quebec]], being the mother tongue for some 7 million people, or almost 80% (2006 Census) of the province. About 95% of the people of Quebec speak French as either their first or second language, and for some as their third language. Quebec is also home to the city of [[Montreal]], which is the world's 4th-largest French-speaking city, by number of first language speakers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.touristmaker.com/blog/what-are-the-largest-french-speaking-cities-in-the-world/ |title=What are the largest French-speaking cities in the world? |website=Tourist Maker |language=en-US |access-date=2016-10-06}}</ref> [[New Brunswick]] and [[Manitoba]] are the only officially bilingual provinces, though full bilingualism is enacted only in New Brunswick, where about one third of the population is Francophone. French is also an official language of all of the territories ([[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], and [[Yukon]]).

Elsewhere, sizable French-speaking minorities are found in southern Manitoba, [[Nova Scotia]], Prince Edward Island and the [[Port au Port Peninsula]] in Newfoundland and Labrador, where the unique [[Newfoundland French]] dialect was historically spoken. Smaller pockets of French speakers exist in all other provinces. The Ontarian city of [[Ottawa]], the Canadian capital, is also effectively bilingual, as it has a large population of federal government workers, who are required to offer services in both French and English, and is across a river from Quebec, opposite the major city of [[Gatineau]] with which it forms a single metropolitan area.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

French is one of Haiti's two official languages. It is the principal language of writing, school instruction, and administrative use. It is spoken by all educated Haitians and is used in the business sector. It is also used for ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church masses. About 70–80% of the country's population have Haitian Creole as their first language; the rest speak French as a first language. The second official language is the recently standardized [[Haitian Creole]], which virtually the entire population of Haiti speaks. Haitian Creole is one of the [[French-based creole languages]], drawing the large majority of its vocabulary from French, with influences from West African languages, as well as several European languages. Haitian Creole is closely related to Louisiana Creole and the creole from the [[Lesser Antilles]].<ref>Ministère de l'Éducation nationale</ref>

In French Polynesia, the percentage of the population who reported that French was the language they use the most at home rose from 67% at the 2007 census to 74% at the 2017 census.<ref name=PF_2007>{{cite web|url=http://ispf.pf/bases/Recensements/2007/Details/Langues.aspx |title=Recensement 2007 – Données détaillées Langues|author=Institut Statistique de Polynésie Française (ISPF)|accessdate=2019-04-07}}</ref><ref name=PF_2017 /> In Wallis and Futuna, the percentage of the population who reported that French was the language they use the most at home rose from 10% at the 2008 census to 13% at the 2018 census.<ref name=WF_2018 /><ref name=WF_2008>{{cite web| url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/ppp/bases-de-donnees/irweb/rpwf08/dd/excel/rpwf08_Pop_06.xls| title=Tableau Pop_06_1 : Population selon le sexe, la connaissance du français et l'âge décennal| first=[[Cabinet of France|Government of France]]| last=[[INSEE]]|format=XLS| accessdate=3 October 2009|language=fr|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604180112/http://www.insee.fr/fr/ppp/bases-de-donnees/irweb/rpwf08/dd/excel/rpwf08_Pop_06.xls|archivedate=2011-06-04}}</ref>

=== Future ===
The future of the French language is often discussed in the news. For example, in 2014, ''[[The New York Times]]'' documented an increase in the teaching of French in New York, especially in K-12 dual-language programs where Spanish and Mandarin are the only second-language options more popular than French.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/nyregion/a-push-for-french-in-new-york-schools-from-france.html |title=A Big Advocate of French in New York's Schools: France |last=Semple |first=Kirk |date=30 January 2014 |work=nytimes.com}}</ref> In a study published in March 2014 by ''[[Forbes]]'', the investment bank [[Natixis]] said that French could become the world's most spoken language by 2050.

In the [[European Union]], French was once the dominant language within all institutions until the 1990s. After several enlargements of the EU (1995, 2004), French significantly lost ground in favour of English, which is more widely spoken and taught in most EU countries. French currently remains one of the three working languages, or "procedural languages", of the EU, along with English and German. It is the second most widely used language within EU institutions after English, but remains the preferred language of certain institutions or administrations such as the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]], where it is the sole internal working language, or the [[Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development|Directorate-General for Agriculture]]. Since 2016, [[Brexit]] has rekindled discussions on whether or not French should again hold greater role within the institutions of the European Union. <ref>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20191017-eu-after-brexit-will-the-french-language-make-a-comeback-1</ref>

==Current status and importance==
A leading [[world language]], French is taught in universities around the world, and is one of the world's most influential languages because of its wide use in the worlds of journalism, [[jurisprudence]], education, and diplomacy.<ref>Kai Chan, Distinguished Fellow, [[INSEAD]] Innovation and Policy Initiative, [https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/12/these-are-the-most-powerful-languages-in-the-world/ "These are the most powerful languages in the world"], [[World Economic Forum]], December 2016</ref>
In diplomacy, French is one of the six official languages of the United Nations (and one of the [[UN Secretariat]]'s only two working languages<ref name="dawnmarley">Rodney Ball, Dawn Marley, ''The French-Speaking World: A Practical Introduction to Sociolinguistic Issues'', Taylor & Francis, 2016, page 6</ref>), one of twenty official and three working languages of the [[European Union]], an official language of [[NATO]], the [[International Olympic Committee]], the [[Council of Europe]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], [[Organization of American States]] (alongside Spanish, Portuguese and English), the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], one of eighteen official languages of the [[European Space Agency]], [[World Trade Organization]] and the least used of the three official languages in the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] countries. It is also a working language in nonprofit organisations such as the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] (alongside English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Russian), [[Amnesty International]] (alongside 32 other languages of which English is the most used, followed by Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Italian), [[Médecins sans Frontières]] (used alongside English, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic), and [[Médecins du Monde]] (used alongside English).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/article_imprim.php3?id_article=15179|title=France-Diplomatie |author=The French Ministry of Foreign affairs|work=France Diplomatie: Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development}}</ref> Given the demographic prospects of the French-speaking nations of Africa, researcher Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry wrote in 2014 that French "could be the language of the future".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/pascalemmanuelgobry/2014/03/21/want-to-know-the-language-of-the-future-the-data-suggests-it-could-be-french/ |title=Want To Know The Language of the Future?

Significant as a judicial language, French is one of the official languages of such major international and regional courts, tribunals, and dispute-settlement bodies as the [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]], the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]], the [[Economic Community of West African States#The Community Court of Justice|Court of Justice for the Economic Community of West African States]], the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], the [[International Court of Justice]], the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]], the [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]] the [[International Criminal Court]] and the [[Appellate Body|World Trade Organization Appellate Body]]. It is the sole internal working language of the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]], and makes with English the [[European Court of Human Rights]]'s two working languages.<ref>On the Linguistic Design of Multinational Courts – The French Capture, forthcoming in 14 INT’L J. CONST. L. (2016), Mathilde Cohen</ref>

In 1997, George Werber published, in ''Language Today'', a comprehensive academic study entitled "The World's 10 most influential languages".<ref name="weber">[https://web.archive.org/web/20130507110651/http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm The World's 10 most influential languages], George Werber, 1997, ''Language Today'', retrieved on scribd.com</ref> In the article, Werber ranked French as, after English, the second most ''influential'' language of the world, ahead of Spanish.<ref name="weber"/> His criteria were the numbers of native speakers, the number of secondary speakers (especially high for French among fellow world languages), the number of countries using the language and their respective populations, the economic power of the countries using the language, the number of major areas in which the language is used, and the [[linguistic prestige]] associated with the mastery of the language (Werber highlighted that French in particular enjoys considerable linguistic prestige).<ref name="weber"/> In a 2008 reassessment of his article, Werber concluded that his findings were still correct since "the situation among the top ten remains unchanged."<ref name="weber"/>

Knowledge of French is often considered to be a useful skill by business owners in the United Kingdom; a 2014 study found that 50% of British managers considered French to be a valuable asset for their business, thus ranking French as the most sought-after foreign language there, ahead of German (49%) and Spanish (44%).<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-27948049 |title=Foreign languages 'shortfall' for business, CBI says |last=Burns |first=Judith |date=2014-06-22 |work=BBC News |access-date=2018-11-18 |language=en-GB}}</ref> MIT economist Albert Saiz calculated a 2.3% premium for those who have French as a foreign language in the workplace.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2014/03/language-study|title=Johnson: What is a foreign language worth?|last=Johnson|date=9 December 2017|journal=The Economist|accessdate=9 December 2017}}</ref>

In English-speaking Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland, French is the first foreign language taught and in number of pupils is far ahead of other languages. In the United States, Spanish is the most commonly taught foreign language in schools and universities, though French is next. In some areas of the country nearest to French-speaking Quebec, it is the language more commonly taught.

Although there are many French regional accents, foreign learners normally use only one variety of the language.

* There are a maximum of 17 vowels in French, not all of which are used in every dialect: {{IPA|/a/, /ɑ/, /e/, /ɛ/, /ɛː/, /ə/, /i/, /o/, /ɔ/, /y/, /u/, /œ/, /ø/,}} plus the nasalized vowels {{IPA|/ɑ̃/, /ɛ̃/, /ɔ̃/}} and {{IPA|/œ̃/}}. In France, the vowels {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/œ̃/}} are tending to be replaced by {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} in many people's speech, but the distinction of {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} and {{IPA|/œ̃/}} is present in [[Meridional French]]. In Quebec and Belgian French, the vowels {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, {{IPA|/ə/}}, {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/œ̃/}} are present.
* Voiced stops (i.e., {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}}) are typically produced fully voiced throughout.
* Voiceless stops (i.e., {{IPA|/p, t, k/}}) are unaspirated.
* The velar nasal {{IPA|/ŋ/}} can occur in final position in borrowed (usually English) words: ''parking, camping, swing''. The palatal nasal {{IPA|/ɲ/}} can occur in word initial position (e.g., ''gnon''), but it is most frequently found in intervocalic, onset position or word-finally (e.g., ''montagne'').
* French has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing, i.e., labiodental {{IPA|/f/~/v/}}, dental {{IPA|/s/~/z/}}, and palato-alveolar {{IPA|/ʃ/~/ʒ/}}. {{IPA|/s/~/z/}} are dental, like the plosives {{IPA|/t/~/d/}} and the nasal {{IPA|/n/}}.
* French has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts. In general, it is described as a [[voiced uvular fricative]], as in {{IPA|[ʁu]}} ''{{wiktfr|roue}}'', "wheel". Vowels are often lengthened before this segment. It can be reduced to an approximant, particularly in final position (e.g., ''fort''), or reduced to zero in some word-final positions. For other speakers, a uvular trill is also common, and an apical trill {{IPA|[r]}} occurs in some dialects.
* Lateral and central approximants: The lateral approximant {{IPA|/l/}} is unvelarised in both onset (''lire'') and coda position (''il''). In the onset, the central approximants {{IPA|[w]}}, {{IPA|[ɥ]}}, and {{IPA|[j]}} each correspond to a high vowel, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/y/}}, and {{IPA|/i/}} respectively. There are a few [[minimal pair]]s where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast, but there are also many cases where they are in free variation. Contrasts between {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} occur in final position as in {{IPA|/pɛj/}} ''{{wiktfr|paye}}'', "pay", vs. {{IPA|/pɛi/}} ''{{wiktfr|pays}}'', "country".

French pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are:
* Final single consonants, in particular ''s'', ''x'', ''z'', ''t'', ''d'', ''n'', ''p'' and ''g,'' are normally silent. (A consonant is considered "final" when no vowel follows it even if one or more consonants follow it.) The final letters ''f'', ''k'', ''q'', and ''l'', however, are normally pronounced. The final '''c''' is sometimes pronounced like in '''bac''', '''sac''', '''roc''' but can also be silent like in '''blanc''' or '''estomac'''. The final ''r'' is usually silent when it follows an ''e'' in a word of two or more syllables, but it is pronounced in some words (''hiver'', ''super'', ''cancer'' etc.).
** When the following word begins with a vowel, however, a silent consonant ''may'' once again be pronounced, to provide a ''[[liaison (linguistics)|liaison]]'' or "link" between the two words. Some liaisons are ''mandatory'', for example the ''s'' in ''les amants'' or ''vous avez''; some are ''optional'', depending on [[dialect]] and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], for example, the first ''s'' in ''deux cents euros'' or ''euros irlandais''; and some are ''forbidden'', for example, the ''s'' in ''beaucoup d'hommes aiment''. The ''t'' of ''et'' is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in [[set phrase]]s like ''pied-à-terre''.
** Doubling a final ''n'' and adding a silent ''e'' at the end of a word (e.g., ''chien'' → ''chienne'') makes it clearly pronounced. Doubling a final ''l'' and adding a silent ''e'' (e.g., ''gentil'' → ''gentille'') adds a [j] sound if the ''l'' is preceded by the letter ''i''.
* Some monosyllabic function words ending in ''a'' or ''e'', such as ''je'' and ''que'', drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound (thus avoiding a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]). The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe. (e.g., ''*je ai'' is instead pronounced and spelled → ''j'ai''). This gives, for example, the same pronunciation for ''l'homme qu'il a vu'' ("the man whom he saw") and ''l'homme qui l'a vu'' ("the man who saw him"). However, for Belgian French the sentences are pronounced differently; in the first sentence the syllable break is as "qu'il-a", while the second breaks as "qui-l'a". It can also be noted that, in [[Quebec French]], the second example (''l'homme qui l'a vu'') is more emphasized on ''l'a vu''.

==Writing system==

===Alphabet===
{{Main|French alphabet|French braille}}

French is written with the 26 letters of the basic [[Latin script]], with four diacritics appearing on vowels ([[circumflex]] accent, [[acute accent]], [[grave accent]], [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) and the [[cedilla]] appearing in "ç".

There are two [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], "œ" and "æ", but they are often replaced in contemporary French with "oe" and "ae", because the ligatures do not appear on the [[AZERTY]] keyboard layout used in French-speaking countries. However this is nonstandard in formal and literary texts.

===Orthography===
{{Main|French orthography|Reforms of French orthography}}

French spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling. Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography (as with some English words such as "debt"):
* Old French ''doit'' > French ''doigt'' "finger" (Latin ''digitus'')
* Old French ''pie'' > French ''pied'' "foot" [Latin ''pes'' (stem: ''ped-'')]

French is a [[Morphophonemic orthography|morphophonemic]] language. While it contains 130 [[grapheme]]s that denote only 36 [[phoneme]]s, many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rdcu.be/uA31|title=The contribution of morphological awareness to the spelling of morphemes and morphologically complex words in French|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref> Many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound. In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme. However, there is not a one-to-one relation of a phoneme and a single related grapheme, which can be seen in how ''tomber'' and ''tombé'' both end with the /e/ phoneme.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brissaud|first1=Catherine|last2=Chevrot|first2=Jean-Pierre|title=The late acquisition of a major difficulty of French inflectional orthography: The homophonic /E/ verbal endings|journal=Writing Systems Research|volume=3|issue=2|pages=129–44|doi=10.1093/wsr/wsr003|year=2011|s2cid=15072817|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00785731/file/Brissaud_Chevrot_2011_.pdf}}</ref> Additionally, there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words, demonstrated by how the ''x'' in ''paix'' is not pronounced though at the end of ''Aix'' it is''.''

As a result, it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound. Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel (see [[Liaison (French)]]). For example, the following words end in a vowel sound: ''pied'', ''aller'', ''les'', ''{{lang|fr|finit}}'', ''beaux''. The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: ''beaux-arts'', ''les amis'', ''pied-à-terre''.

French writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language. In Old French, the plural for ''animal'' was ''animals''. The {{IPA|/als/}} sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong {{IPA|/aus/}}. This change was then reflected in the orthography: ''animaus''. The ''us'' ending, very common in Latin, was then abbreviated by copyists (monks) by the letter ''x'', resulting in a written form ''animax''. As the French language further evolved, the pronunciation of ''au'' turned into {{IPA|/o/}} so that the ''u'' was reestablished in orthography for consistency, resulting in modern French ''animaux'' (pronounced first {{IPA|/animos/}} before the final {{IPA|/s/}} was dropped in contemporary French). The same is true for ''cheval'' pluralized as ''chevaux'' and many others. In addition, ''castel'' pl. ''castels'' became ''château'' pl. ''châteaux''.
* [[Nasal vowel|Nasal]]: ''[[n]]'' and ''m''. When ''n'' or ''m'' follows a vowel or diphthong, the ''n'' or ''m'' becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized (i.e., pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils). Exceptions are when the ''n'' or ''m'' is doubled, or immediately followed by a vowel. The prefixes ''en-'' and ''em-'' are always nasalized. The rules are more complex than this but may vary between dialects.
* [[digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]]: French uses not only [[diacritic]]s to specify its large range of vowel sounds and [[diphthongs]], but also specific combinations of vowels, sometimes with following consonants, to show which sound is intended.
* [[Consonant length|Gemination]]: Within words, double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French (but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the 1970s, and in very refined elocution they may still occur). For example, ''illusion'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ilyzjɔ̃]}} and not {{IPA|[ilːyzjɔ̃]}}. However, gemination does occur between words; for example, ''une info'' ("a news item" or "a piece of information") is pronounced {{IPA|[ynɛ̃fo]}}, whereas ''une nympho'' ("a nymphomaniac") is pronounced {{IPA|[ynːɛ̃fo]}}.
* [[Diacritic|Accents]] are used sometimes for pronunciation, sometimes to distinguish similar words, and sometimes based on etymology alone.
** Accents that affect pronunciation
*** The [[acute accent]] (''l'accent aigu'') ''é'' (e.g., '''''é'''cole''—school) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/e/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/ə/}}.
*** The [[grave accent]] (''l'accent grave'') ''è'' (e.g., ''él'''è'''ve''—pupil) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/ɛ/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/ə/}}.
*** The [[circumflex]] (''l'accent circonflexe'') ''ê'' (e.g. ''for'''ê'''t''—forest) shows that an ''e'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and that an ''ô'' is pronounced {{IPA|/o/}}. In standard French, it also signifies a pronunciation of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} for the letter ''â'', but this differentiation is disappearing. In the mid-18th century, the circumflex was used in place of ''s'' after a vowel, where that letter ''s'' was not pronounced. Thus, ''forest'' became ''forêt'', ''hospital'' became ''hôpital'', and ''hostel'' became ''hôtel''.
*** [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|Diaeresis]] or ''tréma'' (''ë'', ''ï'', ''ü'', ''ÿ''): over ''e'', ''i'', ''u'' or ''y'', indicates that a vowel is to be pronounced separately from the preceding one: ''naïve'', ''Noël''.
****The combination of ''e'' with diaeresis following ''o'' (''N'''oë'''l'' {{IPA-fr|ɔɛ|}}) is nasalized in the regular way if followed by ''n'' (''[[Samoëns|Sam'''oë'''ns]]'' {{IPA-fr|wɛ̃|}})
****The combination of ''e'' with diaeresis following ''a'' is either pronounced {{IPA-fr|ɛ|}} (''Raph'''aë'''l'', ''Isr'''aë'''l'' {{IPA-fr|aɛ|}}) or not pronounced, leaving only the ''a'' (''[[Madame de Staël|St'''aë'''l]]'' {{IPA-fr|a|}}) and the ''a'' is nasalized in the regular way if ''aë'' is followed by ''n'' (''[[Saint-Saëns|Saint-S'''aë'''ns]]'' {{IPA-fr|ɑ̃|}})
****A diaeresis on ''y'' only occurs in some proper names and in modern editions of old French texts. Some proper names in which ''ÿ'' appears include ''[[Aÿ]]'' (a commune in [[Marne (department)|Marne]], formerly ''Aÿ-Champagne''), ''Rue des Cloÿs'' (an alley in Paris), ''Croÿ'' (family name and hotel on the Boulevard Raspail, Paris), ''[[:fr:Château du Feÿ|Château du Feÿ]]'' (near [[Joigny]]), ''Ghÿs'' (name of Flemish origin spelt ''Ghĳs'' where ''ĳ'' in handwriting looked like ''ÿ'' to French clerks), ''[[L'Haÿ-les-Roses]]'' (commune near Paris), [[Pierre Louÿs]] (author), [[Moÿ-de-l'Aisne]] (commune in [[Aisne (department)|Aisne]] and a family name), and ''Le Blanc de Nicolaÿ'' (an insurance company in eastern France).
****The diaeresis on ''u'' appears in the Biblical proper names ''Archélaüs'', ''Capharnaüm'', ''Emmaüs'', ''Ésaü'', and ''Saül'', as well as French names such as [[René Just Haüy|Haüy]]. Nevertheless, since the 1990 orthographic changes, the diaeresis in words containing ''guë'' (such as ''aiguë'' or ''ciguë'') may be moved onto the ''u'': ''aigüe'', ''cigüe'', and by analogy may be used in verbs such as ''j'argüe''.
****In addition, words coming from German retain their [[Diaeresis (diacritic)#Umlaut|umlaut]] (''ä'', ''ö'' and ''ü'') if applicable but use often French pronunciation, such as ''Kärcher'' (trademark of a pressure washer).
*** The [[cedilla]] (''la cédille'') ''ç'' (e.g., ''gar'''ç'''on''—boy) means that the letter ''ç'' is pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the back vowels ''a'', ''o'' and ''u'' (''c'' is otherwise {{IPA|/k/}} before a back vowel). ''C'' is always pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the front vowels ''e'', ''i'', and ''y'', thus ''ç'' is never found in front of front vowels.
** Accents with no pronunciation effect
*** The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters ''i'' or ''u'', nor, in most dialects, ''a''. It usually indicates that an ''s'' came after it long ago, as in ''île'' (''isle'', compare with English ''island'')<!-- [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Rapport_du_Conseil_sup%C3%A9rieur_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise_sur_les_rectifications_orthographiques_de_1990#Accent_circonflexe_.28II.4.29] -->. The explanation is that some words share the same orthography, so the circumflex is put here to mark the difference between the two words. For example, ''dites'' (you say) / ''dîtes'' (you said), or even ''du'' (of the) / ''dû'' (past participle for the verb ''devoir'' = must, have to, owe; in this case, the circumflex disappears in the plural and the feminine).
*** All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words, as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs ''là'' and ''où'' ("there", "where") from the article ''la'' ("the" feminine singular) and the conjunction ''ou'' ("or"), respectively.

Some proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://fonetik.fr/index-en.html Fonétik.fr writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://sites.google.com/site/ortofasil/ Ortofasil writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.alfograf.net/ Alfograf writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://ortograf.net/ Ortograf.net writing system proposal].</ref>

In 1990, a [[Reforms of French orthography|reform]] accepted some changes to French orthography. At the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions. In 2016, schoolbooks in France began to use the newer recommended spellings, with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35496893|title=End of the circumflex?

==Grammar==
{{Main|French grammar}}
French is a moderately [[Inflection|inflected]] language. [[Noun]]s and most [[pronoun]]s are inflected for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); [[adjective]]s, for number and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; [[personal pronoun]]s and a few other pronouns, for [[grammatical person|person]], number, gender, and [[grammatical case|case]]; and [[verb]]s, for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and the person and number of their [[subject (grammar)|subjects]]. Case is primarily marked using [[word order]] and [[preposition]]s, while certain verb features are marked using [[auxiliary verb]]s. According to the French lexicogrammatical system, French has a rank-scale hierarchy with clause as the top rank, which is followed by group rank, word rank, and morpheme rank. A French clause is made up of groups, groups are made up of words, and lastly, words are made up of morphemes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caffarel|first1=Alice|last2=Martin|first2=J.R.|last3=Matthiessen|first3=Christian M.I.M|title=Language Typology: A Functional Perspective|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia}}</ref>

French grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including
* the loss of [[Latin declension]]s
* the loss of the neuter gender
* the development of grammatical [[article (grammar)|articles]] from Latin [[demonstrative]]s
* the loss of certain Latin [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] and the creation of new tenses from auxiliaries.

=== Nouns ===
Every French [[noun]] is either masculine or feminine. Because French nouns are not inflected for gender, a noun's form cannot specify its gender. For nouns regarding the living, their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to. For example, a male teacher is a "enseignant" while a female teacher is a "enseignante". However, plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine. So a group of two male teachers would be "enseignants". A group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be "enseignants". In many situations, and in the case of "enseignant", both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically. The article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech. For example, the singular "le professeur" or "la professeur(e)" (the male or female teacher, professor) can be distinguished from the plural "les professeurs" because "le", "la", and "les" are all pronounced differently. There are some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference. For example, "le dentiste" refers to a male dentist while "la dentiste" refers to a female dentist.

=== Verbs ===
{{Main|French verbs}}

==== Moods and tense-aspect forms ====
The French language consists of both finite and non-finite moods. The finite moods include the [[indicative mood]] (indicatif), the [[subjunctive mood]] (subjonctif), the [[imperative mood]] (impératif), and the [[conditional mood]] (conditionnel). The non-finite moods include the [[infinitive]] mood (infinitif), the [[present participle]] (participe présent), and the [[past participle]] (participe passé).

===== Finite moods =====

====== Indicative (Indicatif) ======
The indicative mood makes use of eight tense-aspect forms. These include the [[Present tense|present]] (présent), the [[simple past]] ([[passé composé]] and [[passé simple]]), the [[past imperfective]] ([[imparfait]]), the [[pluperfect]] ([[plus-que-parfait]]), the [[simple future]] ([[futur simple]]), the [[future perfect]] ([[futur antérieur]]), and the [[past perfect]] (passé antérieur). Some forms are less commonly used today. In today's spoken French, the passé composé is used while the passé simple is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes. Similarly, the plus-que-parfait is used for speaking rather than the older passé antérieur seen in literary works.

Within the indicative mood, the passé composé, plus-que-parfait, futur antérieur, and passé antérieur all use auxiliary verbs in their forms.

====== Subjunctive (Subjonctif) ======
The subjunctive mood only includes four of the tense-aspect forms found in the indicative: present (présent), simple past (passé composé), past imperfective (imparfait), and pluperfect (plus-que-parfait).

Within the subjunctive mood, the passé composé and plus-que-parfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms.

==== Voice ====
French uses both the [[active voice]] and the [[passive voice]]. The active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb ''être'' ("to be") and the past participle.

Example of the active voice:
* "Elle aime le chien." ''She loves the dog.''
* "Marc a conduit la voiture." ''Marc drove the car.''
Example of the passive voice:
* "Le chien est aimé par elle." ''The dog is loved by her.''
* "La voiture était conduite par Marc." ''The car was driven by Marc.''

==== Syntax ====

===== Word order =====
French declarative word order is [[subject–verb–object]] although a pronoun object precedes the verb. Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] of the subject and verb, as in "Parlez-vous français ?" when asking a question rather than "Vous parlez français ?" Both formulations are used, and carry a rising inflection on the last word. The literal English translations are "Do you speak French?" and "You speak French?", respectively. To avoid inversion while asking a question, "Est-ce que" (literally "is it that") may be placed at the beginning of the sentence. "Parlez-vous français ?" may become "Est-ce que vous parlez français ?" French also uses [[verb–object–subject]] (VOS) and [[object–subject–verb]] (OSV) word order. OSV word order is not used often and VOS is reserved for formal writings.<ref name="auto"/>

The majority of French words derive from [[Vulgar Latin]] or were constructed from [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots. In many cases, a single etymological root appears in French in a "popular" or native form, inherited from Vulgar Latin, and a learned form, borrowed later from [[Classical Latin]]. The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective:
* brother: ''[[wikt:frère|frère]]'' / ''[[wikt:fraternel|fraternel]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frater|frater]] / [[wikt:fraternalis|fraternalis]]''
* finger: ''[[wikt:doigt|doigt]]'' / ''[[wikt:digital|digital]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:digitus|digitus]] / [[wikt:digitalis|digitalis]]''
* faith: ''[[wikt:foi|foi]]'' / ''[[wikt:fidèle|fidèle]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:fides|fides]] / [[wikt:fidelis|fidelis]]''
* eye: ''[[wikt:œil|œil]]'' / ''[[wikt:oculaire|oculaire]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:oculus|oculus]] / [[wikt:ocularis|ocularis]]''

However, a historical tendency to [[Francization|Gallicise]] Latin roots can be identified, whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin:
* ''[[wikt:rayonnement|rayonnement]]'' / ''radiation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:radiatio|radiatio]]''
* ''[[wikt:éteindre|éteindre]]'' / ''extinguish'' from Latin ''[[wikt:exstinguo#Latin|exstinguere]]''
* ''[[wikt:noyau|noyau]]'' / ''nucleus'' from Latin ''[[wikt:nucleus#Latin|nucleus]]''
* ''[[wikt:ensoleillement|ensoleillement]]'' / ''insolation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:insolatio|insolatio]]''

There are also noun-noun and adjective-adjective pairs:
* thing/cause: ''[[wikt:chose|chose]]'' / ''[[wikt:cause|cause]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:causa|causa]]''
* cold: ''[[wikt:froid|froid]]'' / ''[[wikt:frigide|frigide]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frigidum|frigidum]]''

It can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words because in the evolution from [[Vulgar Latin]], unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications.

More recently{{When|date=August 2020}} the linguistic policy of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents<ref>{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/01/french-fight-franglais-with-alternatives-for-english-technology-terms-590128/|title=French fight franglais with alternatives for English technology terms |author=metrowebukmetro|date=1 October 2012|work=Metro News}}</ref> to (mainly English) imported words, either by using existing vocabulary, extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules. The result is often two (or more) co-existing terms for describing the same phenomenon.
* ''mercatique ''/ ''marketing''
* ''finance'' ''fantôme'' / ''shadow'' ''banking''
* ''bloc-notes'' / ''notepad''
* ''ailière'' / ''wingsuit''
* ''tiers-lieu ''/'' coworking''

It is estimated that 12% (4,200) of common French words found in a typical [[dictionary]] such as the ''[[Petit Larousse]]'' or ''Micro-Robert Plus'' (35,000 words) are of foreign origin (where [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] learned words are not seen as foreign). About 25% (1,054) of these foreign words come from English and are fairly recent borrowings. The others are some 707 words from Italian, 550 from ancient [[Germanic languages]], 481 from other [[Gallo-Romance languages]], 215 from Arabic, 164 from German, 160 from [[Celtic languages]], 159 from Spanish, 153 from [[Dutch language|Dutch]], 112 from [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], 101 from [[Native American languages]], 89 from other [[Asian languages]], 56 from other [[Afro-Asiatic languages]], 55 from [[Balto-Slavic languages]], 10 from [[Basque language|Basque]] and 144 (about 3%) from other languages.<ref name="auto1"/>

===Numerals===
The French counting system is partially [[vigesimal]]: [[20 (number)|twenty]] (''{{lang|fr|vingt}}'') is used as a base number in the names of numbers from 70 to 99. The French word for ''80'' is ''{{lang|fr|quatre-vingts}}'', literally "four twenties", and the word for ''75'' is ''{{lang|fr|soixante-quinze}}'', literally "sixty-fifteen". This reform arose after the [[French Revolution]] to unify the counting systems (mostly vigesimal near the coast, because of Celtic (via [[Breton language|Breton]]) and Viking influences. This system is comparable to the archaic English use of ''score'', as in "fourscore and seven" (87), or "threescore and ten" (70).

In Old French (during the [[Middle Ages]]), all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20, e.g. ''vint et doze'' (twenty and twelve) for 32, ''dous vinz et diz'' (two twenties and ten) for 50, ''uitante'' for 80, or ''nonante'' for 90.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Einhorn | first = E. | title = Old French: A Concise Handbook | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1974 | location = Cambridge| page = 110 | isbn = 978-0-521-09838-0}}</ref>

[[Belgian French]], [[Swiss French]], [[Aostan French]]<ref name="Jean-Pierre Martin 1984">Jean-Pierre Martin, ''Description lexicale du français parlé en Vallée d'Aoste'', éd. Musumeci, [[Quart, Aosta Valley|Quart]], 1984.</ref> and the French used in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]] are different in this respect. In the French spoken in these places, 70 and 90 are ''{{lang|fr|septante}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|nonante}}''. In Switzerland, depending on the local dialect, 80 can be ''{{lang|fr|quatre-vingts}}'' (Geneva, Neuchâtel, Jura) or ''{{lang|fr|huitante}}'' (Vaud, Valais, Fribourg). ''Octante'' had been used in [[Switzerland]] in the past, but is now considered archaic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.langue-fr.net/spip.php?article202|title=Septante, octante (huitante), nonante|work=langue-fr.net|language=fr}}. See also the English Wikipedia article on [[Welsh language]], especially the section "Counting system" and its note on the influence of [[Celts|Celtic]] in the French counting system.</ref> while in the [[Aosta Valley]] 80 is ''{{lang|fr|huitante}}''.<ref name="Jean-Pierre Martin 1984" /> In Belgium and in its former African colonies, however, ''quatre-vingts'' is universally used.

French, like most European languages, uses a space to separate thousands.<ref>{{cite web |title=Questions de langue: Nombres (écriture, lecture, accord) |publisher=[[Académie française]] |url=http://académie-française.fr/la-langue-francaise/questions-de-langue#57_strong-em-nombres-criture-lecture-accord-em-strong|access-date=15 November 2015 |language=fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101052809/http://xn--acadmie-franaise-npb1a.fr/la-langue-francaise/questions-de-langue#57_strong-em-nombres-criture-lecture-accord-em-strong |archive-date=1 January 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The comma ({{lang-fr|virgule|link=no}}) is used in French numbers as a decimal point, i.e. "2,5" instead of "2.5". In the case of currencies, the currency markers are substituted for decimal point, i.e. "5$7" for "5 dollars and 7 [[cent (currency)|cent]]s".
