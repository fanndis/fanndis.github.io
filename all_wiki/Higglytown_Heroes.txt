'''''Higglytown Heroes''''' is an American CGI-animated [[children's television|children's]] [[Television program|television series]] produced by [[WildBrain Entertainment|Wild Brain]], and Happy Nest Company that aired on the [[Playhouse Disney]] block on [[Disney Channel]] in the United States. The show's characters are shaped like [[Matryoshka doll|Russian nesting dolls]]. In the show, children Wayne, Eubie, Twinkle, and Kip learn about all of the important jobs that people do in Higglytown.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=282–284}}</ref> 65 episodes were produced.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crump |first1=William D. |title=Happy Holidays—Animated!

The theme song of the show, ''Here in Higglytown'', is performed by [[They Might Be Giants]], which was also released on their second children's album ''[[Here Come the ABCs]]''. ''Higglytown Heroes'' had reruns on [[Disney Junior]] on its cable and satellite channel replacing [[SOAPnet]] on March 23, 2012. The Higglytown Heroes TV series was made using [[Autodesk Maya|Alias Maya]] which was used to design models and textures for the Higglytown Heroes Characters, and [[Photoshop]] which was used to create the 2D backgrounds and 2D props.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seandicken.blogspot.co.uk/p/resume.html |title=Sean Dicken – Animation Director, Animator}}</ref><br>The lyrics to the first "Hero" song were written by Kent Redeker, one of the show's executive producers. The song was composed and produced by Mark Harrison, the show's senior songwriter.

==Hero Song==
Each episode contains two songs. An initial "dilemma" song which sets up the "problem" which needs to be solved followed by the "I'm a Higgly Town Hero" song which introduces the hero who solves the problem, some of the heroes would later appear in later episodes.

While every hero song has the same basic melody as the initial hero song written by Harrison, he performed and produced each song with different lyrics and instrumentation to fit the episode's specific hero.

Brad Mossman, the other principal songwriter, composed lyrics and music for a number of dilemma songs in many episodes as well.

In 2011, [[Relient K]] re-recorded the theme song for the show for [[Disney Junior - Live on Stage!]]
This show was re-dubbed in the UK sometime between 2005 and 2010, which aired in the UK on Playhouse Disney on April 11, 2005. In the UK dub, Fran is voiced by veteran actress [[Sue Johnston]], Eubie is voiced by Jonathan Bee and Joe Cooper, Wayne is voiced by Africa Nile, Twinkle is voiced by Amira McCarthy, and Kip was voiced by Matthew Thomas Davies, this also included most of the character cast in the show who ware voiced by the majority of the actors in the UK. Pizza Guy is called Pizza Man instead, causing minor lip-sync issues, most of which would probably not be noticed by the show's target audience.
