Carlsberg was founded by [[J. C. Jacobsen]], a [[philanthropist]] and avid art collector. With his fortune he amassed an art collection which is housed in the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]] in central Copenhagen. The first brew was finished on 10 November 1847, and the export of Carlsberg beer began in 1868 with the export of one barrel to [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].<ref name="Carl">{{Cite web |title=Carlsberg Group - Our Heritage |url=http://www.carlsberguk.co.uk/AboutUs/heritage/Pages/Global.aspx |access-date=14 December 2015 |publisher=Carlsberg}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Some of the company's original logos include an elephant, after which some of its lagers are named, and the [[swastika]],<ref group=note>[http://reddit.com/r/PreWarSwastikas/comments/iry9at/from_the_late_1800s_to_1945_all_carlsberg_labels/ Sample image of a label featuring swastika]</ref> the use of which was discontinued in the 1930s because of its association with political parties in neighboring Germany.

Jacobsen's son Carl opened a brewery in 1882 named Ny (New) Carlsberg forcing him to rename his brewery Gamle (Old) Carlsberg. The companies were merged and run under Carl's direction in 1906 and remained so until his death in 1914.<ref name="Carl" />

Jacobsen set up the [[Carlsberg Laboratory]] in 1875, which worked on scientific problems related to brewing. It featured a Department of Chemistry and a Department of Physiology. The species of yeast used to make [[pale lager]], ''[[Saccharomyces carlsbergensis]]'', was isolated by Emil Christian Hansen at the laboratory in 1883 and bears its name; this was shared freely by Carlsberg.<ref name="Carl" /> The Carlsberg Laboratory also developed the concept of [[pH]] and made advances in protein chemistry.<ref name="euchems">{{Cite web |title=Sørensen, Søren Peter Lauritz (1868–1939) |url=http://www.euchems.org/Distinguished/20thCentury/sorensen.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004013146/http://www.euchems.org/Distinguished/20thCentury/sorensen.asp |archive-date=4 October 2006 |access-date=9 January 2007 |website=100 Distinguished European Chemists |publisher=European Association for Chemical and Molecular Sciences}}</ref> In 1972, the Carlsberg Research Centre was established and the Carlsberg Laboratory is an independent unit of the Centre.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Carlssberg Laboratory |url=http://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/en/Afdelinger/Carlsberg%20Laboratorium.aspx |access-date=14 December 2015 |publisher=Carlsberg}}</ref>

In 1876, J.C. Jacobsen established the Carlsberg Foundation, run by trustees from the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters,  which managed the Carlsberg Laboratory as well as supporting scientific research within the fields of natural sciences, mathematics, philosophy, the humanities and social sciences in Denmark. Because of a conflict with his son Carl, Jacobsen's brewery was left to the Foundation upon his death in 1887.<ref name="The Carlsberg Foundation">{{Cite web |title=The Carlsberg Foundation |url=http://www.carlsberggroup.com/Company/Foundations/CARLSBERGFOUNDATION/Pages/Default.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222092944/http://www.carlsberggroup.com/Company/Foundations/CARLSBERGFOUNDATION/Pages/Default.aspx |archive-date=22 December 2015 |access-date=14 December 2015 |publisher=Carlsberg}}</ref>

Special Brew is a [[strong lager]] brewed only in Denmark and the United Kingdom. It was initially brewed by Carlsberg to commemorate a visit to Denmark by [[Winston Churchill]] in 1950.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Carlsberg Group – Carlsberg Special Brew |url=http://www.carlsberggroup.com/brands/Pages/Carlsbergspecialbrew.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229153951/http://www.carlsberggroup.com/brands/Pages/CarlsbergSpecialBrew.aspx |archive-date=29 December 2010 |access-date=7 March 2011 |publisher=www.carlsberggroup.com}}</ref> The flavour incorporates "cognac flavours among its tasting notes" as Churchill was partial to brandy. In May 1951 two crates were delivered to Churchill's London home. In a thank-you letter Churchill called the drink "Commemoration Lager". In Denmark the drink was called {{lang|da|Påskebryg}}&nbsp;("Easter Brew"), but the Easter Brew has since been replaced by a weaker beer ({{lang|da|Carls Påske}}). For the British market Carlsberg called the drink Special Brew, and production was started in [[Northampton]] in the 1950s.

At 7.5% alcohol (previously 9%, then 8% for a short time), Special Brew is part of a group of strong lagers that are termed "super-strength" in the UK and [[malt liquor]] in the USA. This beer is often associated with street alcoholics.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Weaver |first=Matthew |date=3 October 2005 |title=Call for ban on super-strength 'tramp juice' |work=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/oct/03/drugsandalcohol.homelessness}}</ref>

A single can (440mL) of Special Brew contains 3.5 [[Unit of alcohol|units of alcohol]] (previously 4.5 units) whilst the maximum recommended daily intake for a man is two units. In January 2015, it was reported that Carlsberg would reduce the units per can to less than four, in line with a UK government pledge that no single can should contain more than four units. The change, a reduction either in the size of the can from 500mL to 440mL, or the alcoholic strength of the beer, was considered for implementation in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The secret history of Special Brew |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-30795336 |access-date=13 January 2015 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> Both changes were made; the cans have since been reduced to 440 mL, and the ABV reduced from 9% to 8%, then another drop to 7.5%.

=== Elephant beer ===

[[Image:Carlsberg Elephant Beer.jpg|thumb|upright|50px|Elephant beer]]

In 1901, at brewer Carl Jacobsen's initiative, the Architect Professor J. L. Dahlerup created a tower resting on four elephants carved in granite from the Danish island of [[Bornholm]]. Jacobsen's inspiration was the obelisk supporting an elephant on the [[Piazza della Minerva]] in Rome.<ref>[http://www.visitcarlsberg.dk/history/Footprints/Valby/Pages/TheElephantTower.aspx Visit Carlsberg]</ref> The four elephants each bear the initial of one of Carl Jacobsen's children: Theodora, Paula, Helge and Vagn. This became known as The Elephant Gate and is a landmark entrance to the brewery.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} 

To the west of the gate, Carl Jacobsen's motto was inscribed: Laboremus pro Patria (Let us work for our country). Since then, the Elephant has been a famous part of the Carlsberg family, especially after the strong Elephant Beer was created in 1955 under the name Export Lager Beer featuring the Elephant label. The Elephant is still brewed in Carlsberg Breweries in Copenhagen and exported around the world. A few markets brew their own Carlsberg Elephant beer locally according to the original recipe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Carlsberg's tagline "Probably the best lager in the world" was created in 1973 by Tony Bodinetz at KMP for the UK market.<ref>{{LinkedIn URL | https://www.linkedin.com/in/tony-bodinetz-99408381 | Tony Bodinetz}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Foster |first=Stephen |title=Carlsberg enlists Belgian bikers in great beer battle |url=https://www.moreaboutadvertising.com/2011/10/carlsberg-enlists-belgian-bikers-in-great-beer-battle/ |access-date=22 August 2018 |website=More About Advertising}}</ref> It began to appear in company corporate ads around the world from the 1980s onwards until it was replaced in 2011 in most regions by new tagline "That calls for a Carlsberg".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Thompson |first=James |date=8 December 2011 |title=Jorgen Rasmussen: Right time for change of tactics?

The voice over for the original ad in 1983 was voiced by actor [[Orson Welles]],<ref>http://www.carlsberggroup.com/Company/Timeline/Pages/History.aspx  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213062037/http://www.carlsberggroup.com/Company/Timeline/Pages/History.aspx |date=13 February 2008 }}</ref> his voice has been used repeatedly over the years. Welles was not expensive and he liked the advertisements, so he kept his fees to a minimum. In some countries the tagline has been adapted to "Probably the best beer in the world".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Stamp |first=Gavin |date=18 June 2006 |title=Probably the best corporate slogan... |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5036084.stm |access-date=17 January 2015}}</ref>

Carlsberg was featured in the film ''[[Ice Cold in Alex]]'' (not, however, in the book on which the film was based) as the lager the main cast get to drink after driving across the desert. Lines from the film gave rise to one of Carlsberg's best known advertising slogans in the UK: "worth waiting for".{{cn|date=September 2020}}
