From its inception during the [[American Revolutionary War]], the U.S. Armed Forces have played a decisive role in the [[history of the United States]]. It helped forge a sense of national unity and identity through its victories in the [[First Barbary War]] and the [[Second Barbary War]]. It played a critical role in the [[American Civil War]], keeping the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] from seceding from the republic. The [[National Security Act of 1947]], adopted following [[World War II]], created the modern U.S. military framework. The Act established the [[United States Department of Defense|National Military Establishment]], headed by the secretary of defense; and created the [[United States Air Force]] and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]. It was amended in 1949, renaming the National Military Establishment the Department of Defense, and merged the cabinet-level Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force, into the Department of Defense.

The U.S. Armed Forces are one of the largest military forces in terms of personnel. It draws its personnel from a large pool of paid [[Volunteer military|volunteers]]. Although [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] has been used in the past, it has not been used since 1973. The [[Selective Service System]] retains the power to conscript males, and requires that all male citizens and residents residing in the U.S. between the ages of 18–25 register with the service.

==History==
{{Main|Military history of the United States}}
The history of the U.S. Armed Forces dates to 14 June 1775, with the creation of the [[Continental Army]], even before the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] marked the establishment of the United States. The [[Continental Navy]], established on 13 October 1775, and [[Continental Marines]], established on 10 November 1775, were created in close succession by the [[Second Continental Congress]] in order to defend the new nation against the [[British Empire]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

These forces demobilized in 1784 after the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] ended the War for Independence. The [[Congress of the Confederation]] created the current [[United States Army]] on 3 June 1784. The [[United States Congress]] created the current [[United States Navy]] on 27 March 1794 and the current [[United States Marine Corps]] on 11 July 1798. All three services trace their origins to their respective Continental predecessors. The 1787 adoption of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] gave the [[United States Congress|Congress]] the power to "raise and support armies", to "provide and maintain a navy" and to "make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces", as well as the power to [[Declaration of war by the United States|declare war]]. The [[President of the United States|president]] is the U.S. Armed Forces' [[commander-in-chief]].

The [[United States Coast Guard]] traces its origin to the founding of the [[Revenue Cutter Service]] on 4 August 1790 which merged with the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] on 28 January 1915 to establish the Coast Guard. The [[United States Air Force]] was established as an independent service on 18 September 1947; it traces its origin to the formation of the [[Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps]], which was formed 1 August 1907 and was part of the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] before becoming an independent service as per the National Security Act of 1947. The [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]] was formerly considered to be a branch of the United States Armed Forces from 29 July 1945 until its status as such was revoked on 3 July 1952.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/vso/veterans-preference-and-wartime-service#8 |title=Veterans Preference and "Wartime" Service |access-date=20 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621221456/https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/vso/veterans-preference-and-wartime-service#8 |archive-date=21 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all |date=15 August 2016 }}</ref>

The [[United States Space Force]] was established as an independent service on 20 December 2019. It is the sixth branch of the U.S. military and the first new branch since the establishment of the independent U.S. Air Force in 1947.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/USSpaceForceDoD/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&eid=ARCv5bxQxz9QMM5ZPYFZoeVpS2-x_IUaiLhEShloFBFWb45cy1FWp5DgsJCSd-dcjt0yQdmhSqbsRbgE |title = United States Space Force Facebook Page|date = 2019-12-20}}</ref> It traces its origin to the formation of the [[Air Force Space Command]], which was formed 1 September 1982 and was a [[List of major commands of the United States Air Force|major command]] of the United States Air Force.

==Structure==
[[File:US National Command.png|thumb|Structure of the National Command Authority]]
The United States Armed Forces are led by the [[president of the United States]], which [[Article Two of the United States Constitution]] names them as the "Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States." The United States Armed Forces are split between two cabinet departments, with the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] serving as the primary cabinet department for military affairs and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] responsible for administering the [[United States Coast Guard]].

The military chain of command flows from the president of the United States to the secretary of defense (for services under the Defense Department) or secretary of homeland security (for services under the Department of Homeland Security), ensuring [[civilian control of the military]]. Within the Department of Defense the military departments, the [[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]], [[United States Department of the Navy]], and [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]], are civilian led entities that oversee the coequal military service branches organized within. The military departments and services are responsible for organizing, training, and equipping forces, with the actual chain of command flowing through the [[unified combatant commands]].

[[File:Joint Chiefs of Staff (31662768614).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The Joint Chiefs of Staff and commandant of the Coast Guard in January 2017.]]
The [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], although outside the operational chain of command, is the senior-most military body in the United States Armed Forces. It is led by the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], who is the military head of the armed forces and principle advisor to the president and secretary of defense on military matters. Their deputy is the [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. Other members include the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|chief of staff of the Army]], [[commandant of the Marine Corps]], [[chief of naval operations]], [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|chief of staff of the Air Force]], [[Chief of Space Operations|chief of space operations]], and the [[chief of the National Guard Bureau]]. The [[commandant of the Coast Guard]] is not an official member of the Joint Chiefs, but sometimes attends meetings as the one of the military service chiefs. The [[Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman]] is the most senior enlisted member in the United States Armed Forces.<ref>https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2020/august/time-coast-guard-join-joint-chiefs</ref>

Leadership of the Armed Forces, to include the [[president of the United States]], [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] are members of the [[United States National Security Council]], which advises the president on national security, military, and foreign policy matters. The [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] and [[Deputy National Security Advisor (United States)|Deputy National Security Advisor]] may also be members of the United States Armed Forces. The [[National Security Council Deputies Committee]] also includes the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]], [[United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security|Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security]], and [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. The [[United States Homeland Security Council]], which advises the president on homeland security, includes the [[president of the United States]], [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. The [[Homeland Security Advisor]] may also be a member of the armed forces. Military leadership, including the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security]], and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] also sit on the [[National Space Council]].
===Military service branches===
[[File:Organization_of_U.S._Space_Force.png|thumb|350px|Organization of the military services and military departments within the Department of Defense]]
The United States Armed Forces is comprised of six coequal military service branches. Five of the branches, the [[United States Army]], [[United States Marine Corps]], [[United States Navy]], [[United States Air Force]], and [[United States Space Force]] are organized under the Department of Defense's military departments. The [[United States Coast Guard]] is nominally under the [[Department of Homeland Security]], but may be transferred to the Department of Defense's Department of the Navy (which is the civilian entity that oversees the coequal U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy) at the direction of the president or congress. With the exception of the Coast Guard, the military services only organize, train, and equip forces. The unified combatant commands are responsible for operational control of non-service retained forces.
====United States Army====
{{main|United States Army}}
[[File:Logo of the United States Army.svg|thumb|Logo of the United States Army]]
The [[United States Army]] (USA) is the [[land]] [[military branch|service branch]] of the United States Armed Forces and part of the civilian-led [[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]], which is led by the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]].

Rank names may be different between services, but they are matched to each other by their corresponding [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades|paygrade]].<ref>For example, a [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] in the Air Force is equivalent to a [[Vice admiral (United States)|vice admiral]] in that Navy since they both carry a paygrade of O-9.</ref> Officers who hold the same rank or paygrade are distinguished by their date of rank to determine seniority, while officers who serve in certain positions of office of importance set by law, outrank all other officers in active duty of the same rank and paygrade, regardless of their date of rank.<ref name="senior officers">{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/131001p.pdf |title=Department of Defence Instruction 1310.01: Rank and Seniority of Commissioned Officers |date=6 May 2006 |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |accessdate=9 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026035949/http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/131001p.pdf |archive-date=26 October 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2012, it was reported that only one in four persons in the United States of the proper age meet the moral, academic and physical standards for military service.<ref>Barber, Barrie.

{{Main|United States military deployments}}

====Overseas====
{{see also|:Category:United States military presence in other countries|l1=United States military presence in other countries}}

As of 31 December 2010, U.S. Armed Forces troops were stationed in 150 countries; the number of non-contingent deployments per country ranges from 1 in [[Suriname]] to over 50,000 in Germany.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/history/hst1012.pdf| title=Active duty military personnel strengths by regional area and by country| accessdate=31 December 2010| year=2010| publisher=U.S. Department of Defense| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505023014/http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/history/hst1012.pdf| archivedate=5 May 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Some of the largest deployments are: 103,700 in [[Afghanistan]], 52,440 in [[Germany]] ''(''see [[List of United States Army installations in Germany|list]]), 35,688 in Japan ([[United States Forces Japan|USFJ]]), 28,500 in [[Republic of Korea|South Korea]] ([[United States Forces Korea|USFK]]), 9,660 in [[Italy]] and 9,015 in the United Kingdom. These numbers change frequently due to the regular recall and deployment of units.

[[File:US Global Military Presence.svg|thumb|U.S. global military presence]]

Altogether, 77,917 military personnel are located in Europe, 141 in the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]], 47,236 in East Asia and the Pacific, 3,362 in North Africa, the [[Near East]] and South Asia, 1,355 in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and 1,941 in the [[Western Hemisphere]] excluding the United States itself.

====Domestic====
''Including U.S. territories and ships afloat within territorial waters''
As of 31 December 2009, a total of 1,137,568 personnel were on active duty within the United States and its [[U.S. territory|territories]] (including 84,461 afloat).<ref name="2009 Armed Forces Deployment">{{cite web|title=Active Duty Military Personnel Strengths by Regional Area and by Country|url=http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/history/hst0912.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Defense|accessdate=29 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019001138/http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/history/hst0912.pdf|archivedate=19 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The vast majority (941,629 personnel) were stationed at bases within the [[contiguous United States]]. There were an additional 37,245 in [[Hawaii]] and 20,450 in [[Alaska]] while 84,461 were at sea, 2,972 in [[Guam]] and 179 in [[Puerto Rico]].

===Rank structure===
Rank in the United States Armed Forces is split into three distinct categories: [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], [[Warrant officer (United States)|warrant officers]], and [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] personnel. Officers are the leadership of the military, holding commissions from the president of the United States and confirmed to their rank by the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Warrant officers hold a warrant from the secretaries of the military departments, serving as specialist in certain military technologies and capabilities. Upon promotion to chief warrant officer 2, they gain a commission from the president of the United States. Enlisted personnel comprise the majority of the armed forces, serving as specialists and tactical-level leaders until they become senior non-commissioned officers or senior petty officers. Military ranks across the services can be compared by U.S. Uniformed Services pay grade or NATO rank code.<ref>https://www.defense.gov/Resources/Insignia/</ref>

[[Warrant officer (United States)|Warrant officers]] are specialists, comprising only 8% of the officer corps.<ref>https://www.bls.gov/ooh/military/military-careers.htm#:~:text=Enlisted%20personnel%20make%20up%20about,manage%20operations%20and%20enlisted%20personnel.</ref> Warrant officers hold warrants from their service secretary and are specialists and experts in certain military technologies or capabilities. The lowest-ranking warrant officers serve under a warrant, but they receive commissions from the president upon promotion to chief warrant officer 2. They derive their authority from the same source as commissioned officers but remain specialists, in contrast to commissioned officers, who are generalists. There are no warrant officers in the Air Force or Space Force.<ref>https://www.defense.gov/Resources/Insignia/</ref>

Warrant officers are typically non-commissioned officers before being selected, with the exception of the Army Aviation where any enlisted grade can apply for a warrant. Army Warrant officers attend the [[Warrant Officer Candidate School (United States Army)|Army Warrant Officer Candidate School]].<ref>https://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/current-and-prior-service/advance-your-career/warrant-officer.html#:~:text=X-,A%20Warrant%20Officer%20is%20a%20highly%20specialized%20expert%20and%20trainer,advancing%20within%20their%20career%20specialties.</ref>

The [[Women's Army Corps|Woman's Army Auxiliary Corps]] was established in the United States in 1942. Women saw combat during World War II, first as nurses in the [[Pearl Harbor]] attacks on 7 December 1941. The [[WAVES|Woman's Naval Reserve]], [[United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve|Marine Corps Women's Reserve]], [[SPARS|US Coast Guard Women's Reserve]], and [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] (WASPs) were also created during this conflict.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} In 1944, WACs arrived in the Pacific and landed in Normandy on [[D-Day]]. During the war, 67 Army nurses and 16 [[United States Navy Nurse Corps|Navy nurses]] were captured and spent three years as Japanese prisoners of war. There were 350,000 American women who served during World War II and 16 were killed in action. In total, they gained over 1,500 medals, citations and commendations. [[Virginia Hall]], serving with the Office of Strategic Services, received the second-highest U.S. combat award, the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], for action behind enemy lines in France.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

After World War II, demobilization led to the vast majority of serving women being returned to civilian life. Law 625, [[Women's Armed Services Integration Act|The Women's Armed Services Act]] of 1948, was signed by [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]], allowing women to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces in fully integrated units during peacetime, with only the WAC remaining a separate female unit. During the [[Korean War]] of 1950–1953, many women served in the [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]s, with women serving in Korea numbering 120,000 {{dubious|date=January 2018}}during the conflict.{{cn|date=May 2020}} During the [[Vietnam War]], 600 women served in the country as part of the Air Force, along with 500 members of the WAC and over 6,000 medical personnel and support staff.

The Marine Corps has recognized its observed birth date on a more consistent basis. The [[Second Continental Congress]] is considered to have established the Navy on 13 October 1775 by authorizing the purchase of ships, but did not actually pass the [[United States Navy Regulations#History|"Rules for the Regulation of the Navy of the United Colonies"]] until 27 November 1775.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rules for the Regulation of the Navy of the United Colonies of North-America|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/organization-and-administration/regulations-and-policy/navy-regulations-1775.html|website=Naval Historical Center|publisher=Department of the Navy|accessdate=11 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123152420/http://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/organization-and-administration/regulations-and-policy/navy-regulations-1775.html|archive-date=23 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Marine Corps was established by an act of the Second Continental Congress on 10 November 1775.
