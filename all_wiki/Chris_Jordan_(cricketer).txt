===2013–14 Australia and T20 World Cup===
Jordan made his ODI debut against Australia, taking figures of 3–51. Jordan's selection had come as a surprise to many following his injury problems. Jordan played in the first two matches of the return series in Australia, taking 1–50 and 2–53. Jordan played in the final three games of the series, the pick of his figures being 2–37 in the final game of the series. Jordan's economy rate did not pass 6.00 runs per over in any of the games, making him one of England's stand out bowlers.

Jordan made his T20 debut at the World Cup against New Zealand in a rain affected match. He took 2–28 in the second match against Sri Lanka as England secured an unlikely victory. Jordan played in the defeat against South Africa which ended their hopes of progressing in the competition. He took 1–13 in three overs against the Netherlands but was unable to prevent an embarrassing defeat for England.

===2014 Sri Lanka, India and Tri Series===
In the first match of the ODI series against Sri Lanka, Jordan excelled, taking 3–25 and smashing 38 off just 16 balls. This earned him the man of the match award. Jordan took 5–29 in the third match of the series as England cruised to victory. Jordan was expensive in the fourth match, managing 2–67 as Sri Lanka won the match to take the series into a decider. In the final match he took 1–55 as England lost the game and the series 3–2. Jordan was called up to the test team to face Sri Lanka following his impressive performances. In the first test, he took 5 wickets in the match but was unable to force a victory as the match ended in a draw. He was less impressive for the second match, failing to take a wicket as England lost by 100 runs.

Jordan was selected in the squad for the first test against India, but missed out as Ben Stokes returned from injury. He was also named in the squad for the second test. He played in his first game of the series in the third Test. He did not take a wicket in the match, but kept his place for the next match of the series. Here he was again not at his best, although he did take three wickets to help England go 2–1 up in the series. In the final test of the series, Jordan took 3–32 in the first innings, before making 20 with the bat. With England in a commanding position he took 4–18 in the second innings to help England win the match and the series 3–1. He played in the second ODI against India, although he did not perform well, finishing with figures of 0–73. He did not play again in the series.

Jordan was selected in the squad for the return series against Sri Lanka. He made his first appearance of the tour in the third ODI, where he took figures of 2–46. He took 2–35 in the next game, although England lost. In the fifth ODI he took another two wickets to keep England's hopes of winning the series alive. He proved expensive in the next game, finishing with figures of 2–68. He ended he tour by taking another two wickets, although England again lost to lose the series 5–2.

Jordan only played once in England's tri series against India and Australia, taking figures of 1–33 in the first match of the tournament against Australia. He made 17 with the bat but England suffered defeat. This proved to be Jordan's only game of the series.

===2015 World Cup===
Jordan was overlooked at the start of the World Cup and did not play until England met Bangladesh in a must win game. Jordan took figures of 2–59 as Bangladesh posted 275. Jordan was later run out for a duck as England failed to chase the target and were eliminated. In the final game against Afghanistan Jordan picked up the man of the match award after picking up figures of 2–13 to help England win by nine wickets.

===2015 West Indies===
Jordan kept his place in the team for the tour of West Indies. In the first innings of the first Test, he remained unbeaten on 21. After taking 1–46 in the first innings, he took 1–48 in the second innings as England were unable to force a result. In the second Test he took 2–65 in West Indies first innings and followed this up taking a wicket in the second innings to help England win the game. In the third Test he was less effective. He failed to take a wicket in the West Indies first innings as they were bowled out for 189. After England collapsed in their second innings,  Jordan took 1–24 in the West Indies second innings but England lost the game by five wickets as the West Indies levelled the series at 1–1.

===2015 New Zealand and Pakistan===
Although Jordan didn't play in the Test series, he returned to the fold for the ODI series. He picked up figures of 1–33 in the first match, as England secured an emphatic victory. However, he was expensive in the next match, taking figures of 1–97 as New Zealand posted 398 to secure a win on the D/L method. Jordan injured himself in the match and was ruled out of the rest of the series, which England went on to win 3–2.

After being left out of the matches against Australia, Jordan returned against Pakistan. Jordan played in the first T20 against Pakistan, finishing with figures of 0–37. After being rotated in the second match, he returned in the third match of the series and took figures of 3–23, as the scores were tied. Jordan was entrusted to bowl the Super Over and England won the match.

===2015–16 South Africa===

After taking 0–56 in England's win in the first ODI, he took figures of 0–33 in the second match of the series, which England also won. He took 1–54 in the next match, although was again expensive, going at over seven runs per over. Although he wasn't selected for the rest of the ODI series, he returned to the fold in the T20I series. He took 3–23 in the first match, but was expensive in the second, taking figures of 0–48.

===2016 World T20===
Jordan was a key member of the England T20 World Cup squad, playing every game in England's run to the final. He took figures of 0–24 against the West Indies, but was expensive against South Africa. He picked up his first wicket of the tournament as England beat Afghanistan, and then took match winning figures of 4–28 as England beat Sri Lanka to qualify for the semi-finals. Jordan continued to impress with his death bowling, taking figures of 1–24. In the final against West Indies, he took 0–36 as England narrowly lost and finished as runners-up.
