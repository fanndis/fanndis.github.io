'''Elizabeth Virginia Truman''' ([[Maiden and married names|''née'']] '''Wallace'''; February 13, 1885{{spnd}}October 18, 1982) was the wife of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] and the [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1945 to 1953. She also served as the [[Second Lady of the United States]] in 1945.

She had known her future husband since they were children attending the same school in [[Independence, Missouri]].

She currently holds the record of longest-lived First Lady and longest-lived Second Lady, at {{age in years and days|1885|2|13|1982|10|18}}. She died in Independence, Missouri.

Harry Truman met Bess soon after his family moved to Independence, and the two attended school together until graduation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Klapthor|first=Margaret Brown|title=The First Ladies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5YVoopwVgUC&pg=PT75|date=October 1, 2002|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-912308-83-8|page=75}}</ref>
 
After graduating from [[William Chrisman High School]] (then known as Independence High School) she studied at [[Miss Barstow's Finishing School for Girls]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. In 1903, her father rose very early one morning, climbed into the family bathtub, and died by suicide by shooting himself in the head. According to biographer [[David McCullough]], the cause for his suicide is unknown, with speculation ranging from depression to mounting debts.<ref>''[[American Experience]]: Truman'' [[PBS]]. 1997.

Bess and Harry Truman married on June 28, 1919, at [[Trinity Episcopal Church (Independence, Missouri)|Trinity Episcopal Church]] in Independence.<ref>{{cite book|last=Margolies|first=Daniel S.|title=A Companion to Harry S.

== Life in Washington ==
When Truman was elected as a Senator from Missouri in 1934, the family moved to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]]. Mrs. Truman became a member of the Congressional Club, the PEO Sisterhood, the H Street United Service Organization, and the Red Cross work of the Senate Wives Club. She joined her husband's staff as a clerk, answering personal mail and editing committee reports when he became Chairman of the [[Truman Committee|Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program]].<ref name="Truman: Bess Truman's Biography"/>

==First Lady of the United States==
Bess found the [[White House]]'s lack of privacy distasteful. As her husband put it later, she was "not especially interested" in the "formalities and pomp or the artificiality which, as we had learned..., inevitably surround the family of the President." Though she steadfastly fulfilled the social obligations of her position, she did only what she thought was necessary. When the White House was rebuilt during Truman's second term, the family lived in [[Blair House]] and kept their social life to a minimum. In most years of her husband's presidency, Mrs. Truman was not regularly present in Washington other than during the [[social season]] when her presence was expected.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Christensen|first1=Lawrence O.|last2=Foley|first2=William E.|last3=Kremer|first3=Gary|title=Dictionary of Missouri Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gyxWHRLAWgC&pg=PA752|date=October 1999|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-6016-1|page=752}}</ref> The contrast with Bess's activist predecessor [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] was considerable. Unlike her, Bess held only one press conference after many requests from the media.<ref>{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Robert P.|title=The Presidents' Wives: Reassessing the Office of First Lady|url=https://archive.org/details/presidentswivesr00wats|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn=978-1-55587-948-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidentswivesr00wats/page/89 89]}}</ref> The press conference consisted of written questions in advance and the written replies were mostly monosyllabic along with many ''no comments''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burnes|first=Brian|title=Harry S.

I have nothing to say to the public."<ref name=":0" /> Bess's response to whether she wanted her daughter Margaret to become president was "most definitely not." Her reply to what she wanted to do after her husband left office was "return to Independence".<ref>{{cite book|last=Wertheimer|first=Molly Meijer|title=Inventing a Voice: The Rhetoric of American First Ladies of the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBwYLVZHsWMC&pg=PA212|date=January 1, 2004|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-2971-7|page=212}}</ref>

As First Lady, Bess served as Honorary President of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]], the Woman's National Democratic Club, and the Washington Animal Rescue League. She was Honorary Chairman of the [[American Red Cross]].<ref name="Truman: Bess Truman's Biography"/>

In 1953, the Trumans went back to Independence and the family home at [[Harry S. Truman National Historic Site|219 North Delaware Street]], where the former president worked on building his library and writing his memoirs. Bess fully recovered following a 1959 [[mastectomy]] in which doctors removed a large, but benign, tumor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Neal|first=Steve|title=Eleanor and Harry: The Correspondence of Eleanor Roosevelt and Harry S.

When President [[Lyndon Johnson]] signed [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] into law in 1965, the Trumans were the first [[senior citizen]]s to receive Medicare cards, presented to them by Johnson at the Truman Library.<ref>{{cite web | title=President Johnson signs Medicare Bill on July 30, 1965 | publisher = Politico | accessdate=December 15, 2013 | url= http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0707/5129.html}}</ref>

== Antisemitism ==
   
In 1961, [[David Susskind]] conducted a series of interviews with former President Truman in Independence. After picking Truman up at his home to take him to the [[Truman Presidential Library]] for the interviews over several days, Susskind asked Truman why he had not been invited into the home. According to presidential historian [[Michael Beschloss]], Truman flatly told Susskind, "This is Bess's house" and that there had never been nor would there ever be a Jewish guest.<ref name="isbn0-684-85705-7">{{cite book|author=Beschloss, Michael|author-link=Michael Beschloss|title=Presidential Courage: Brave Leaders and How They Changed America 1789–1989|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|year=2007|isbn=0-684-85705-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidentialcour00besc/page/210 210]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidentialcour00besc/page/210}}</ref>

==Widowhood, death and longevity record==
At the time of her husband's death in 1972 at age 88, she was 87, making them the oldest couple having occupied the White House at that time. Bess agreed to be the honorary chairman for the reelection campaign of Sen. [[Thomas Eagleton]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D]]-[[Missouri]]).<ref name="Algeo2009">{{cite book|last=Algeo|first=Matthew|title=Harry Truman's Excellent Adventure: The True Story of a Great American Road Trip|url=https://archive.org/details/harrytrumansexce0000alge|url-access=registration|date=May 1, 2009|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-56976-251-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/harrytrumansexce0000alge/page/226 226]}}</ref>

Bess continued to live quietly in Independence for the last decade of her life, being visited by her daughter and grandchildren. She died on October 18, 1982, from [[congestive heart failure]] at the age of 97; a private funeral service was held on October 21. Afterwards, she was buried beside her husband in the courtyard of the [[Harry S. Truman Library]] in Independence, Missouri.<ref>{{cite web | title= Bess Truman Buried – October 22, 1982 | publisher = The Gettysburg Times | accessdate=August 1, 2013 | url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&dat=19821022&id=Np9cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=U1gNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4791,4605178}}</ref>
