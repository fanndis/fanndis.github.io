'''New Zealand Permanent Residents''' are residents of [[New Zealand]], who hold a permanent resident visa, which – superficially seen – makes them equal to New Zealand citizens. A permanent resident visa must not be confused with a resident visa.

This article refers to the terms “resident” and “permanent resident” only in the scope of immigration purposes and describes the current situation based on the Immigration Act 2009. There are other definitions for residents in tax or electoral affairs.

== Differences between a resident and a permanent resident visa ==
A permanent resident visa holder is entitled to be granted entry permission at the border at any time, while the resident visa holder is only entitled to apply for entry permission (whether before or after travelling to New Zealand). All other rights become only effective, if entry is granted to the resident visa holder.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2009/0051/latest/DLM1440688.html |title=Currency and nature of a permanent resident visa}}</ref>

Generally, a resident visa is issued with travel conditions, which allow the holder to re-enter the country multiple times until these conditions expire. After that the holder may remain in the country legally but must not leave it or lose its resident status.

== Requirements to obtain a permanent residence visa ==
An applicant for a permanent resident visa must
*hold or have held a resident visa in the last three months
**
*hold, or have held that resident visa for at least two years continuously
*be of good character
*have met any conditions that the resident visa was subject to
