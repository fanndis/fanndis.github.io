'''Columbia''' is the [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] and second-largest city of the [[U.S. state]] of [[South Carolina]], with a population estimate of 131,674 as of 2019.<ref name="CensusCity">{{cite web|title=Columbia city, South Carolina|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/4516000|website=Census Bureau|publisher=Census Bureau|accessdate=October 1, 2016}}</ref> The city serves as the [[county seat]] of [[Richland County, South Carolina|Richland County]], and a portion of the city extends into neighboring [[Lexington County, South Carolina|Lexington County]]. It is the center of the [[Columbia metropolitan area (South Carolina)|Columbia metropolitan statistical area]], which had a population of 767,598 as of the 2010 United States Census, growing to 832,666 by July 1, 2018, according to 2018 U.S. Census estimates. This makes it the 70th-largest metropolitan statistical area in the nation, as estimated by the [[United States Census Bureau]] as of July 1, 2018. The name [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] is a poetic term used for the United States, originating from the name of [[Christopher Columbus]].
The city is located about {{convert|13|mi|km|0}} northwest of the geographic center of South Carolina, and is the primary city of the [[Midlands (South Carolina)|Midlands]] region of the state. It lies at the confluence of the [[Saluda River]] and the [[Broad River (Carolinas)|Broad River]], which merge at Columbia to form the [[Congaree River]]. Columbia is home to the [[University of South Carolina]], the state's flagship university and the largest in the state, and is also the site of [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], the largest [[United States Army]] installation for [[United States Army Basic Training|Basic Combat Training]]. Columbia is also located 20 miles west of the site of [[McEntire Joint National Guard Base]], which is operated by the [[U.S. Air Force]] and is used as a training base for the [[169th Fighter Wing]] of the [[South Carolina Air National Guard]]. Columbia is also the location of the [[South Carolina State House]], which is the center of government for the state. In 1860, the city was the location of the South Carolina Secession Convention, which marked the departure of the first state from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the events leading up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

[[File:Slave quarters at the Hale–Elmore–Seibels House.jpg|thumb|Former slave quarters at the [[Hale–Elmore–Seibels House]] in downtown Columbia.]]
At the time of European encounter, the inhabitants of the area that became Columbia were a people called the [[Congaree people|Congaree]].<ref name=swanton>{{citation| last=Swanton| first=John R.| title=The Indian Tribes of North America| publisher=Smithsonian Institution| year=1952| url=https://books.google.com/?id=vtHI5pkJOGMC| isbn=0-8063-1730-2| page=93| oclc=52230544}}</ref> In May 1540, a Spanish expedition led by [[Hernando de Soto]] traversed what is now Columbia while moving northward. The expedition produced the earliest written historical records of the area, which was part of the regional [[Cofitachequi]] chiefdom.<ref name="Hudson1998">{{cite book|author=Charles Hudson|title=Knights of Spain, Warriors of the Sun: Hernando de Soto and the South's Ancient Chiefdoms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWJnGjxjJk8C|accessdate=February 16, 2012|date=September 1998|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2062-5|pages=234–238|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009061906/http://books.google.com/books?id=vWJnGjxjJk8C|archive-date=October 9, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

From the creation of Columbia by the [[South Carolina General Assembly]] in 1786, the site of Columbia was important to the overall development of the state. The Congarees, a frontier fort on the west bank of the Congaree River, was the head of navigation in the [[Santee River]] system. A ferry was established by the colonial government in 1754 to connect the fort with the growing settlements on the higher ground on the east bank.<ref name="columbiahistory">[http://www.columbiasc.net/about-columbia "A Brief History of Columbia."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219184430/http://www.columbiasc.net/about-columbia |date=February 19, 2015 }} City of Columbia Official Web Site. columbiasc.net. Retrieved February 20, 2015.</ref>

Like many other significant early settlements in colonial America, Columbia is on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]] from the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region. The [[fall line]] is the spot where a river becomes unnavigable when sailing upstream and where water flowing downstream can power a mill.

State Senator [[John Lewis Gervais]] of the town of [[Ninety Six, South Carolina|Ninety Six]] introduced a bill that was approved by the legislature on March 22, 1786, to create a new state capital. Considerable argument occurred over the name for the new city. According to published accounts, Senator Gervais said he hoped that "in this town we should find refuge under the wings of [[Columbia (name)|COLUMBIA]]", for that was the name which he wished it to be called. One legislator insisted on the name "Washington", but "Columbia" won by a vote of 11–7 in the state senate.

The site was chosen as the new state capital in 1786, due to its central location in the state. The State Legislature first met there in 1790. After remaining under the direct government of the legislature for the first two decades of its existence, Columbia was incorporated as a village in 1805 and then as a city in 1854.

Columbia received a large stimulus to development when it was connected in a direct water route to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] by the [[Santee Canal]], which connected the Santee and Cooper Rivers in a {{convert|22|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} section. It was first chartered in 1786 and completed in 1800, making it one of the earliest canals in the United States. With increased railroad traffic, it ceased operation around 1850.

The commissioners designed a town of 400 blocks in a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on|0}} square along the river. The blocks were divided into lots of {{convert|0.5|acre|m2}} and sold to speculators and prospective residents. Buyers had to build a house at least {{convert|30|ft|m}} long and {{convert|18|ft|m}} wide within three years or face an annual 5% penalty. The perimeter streets and two through streets were {{convert|150|ft|m}} wide. The remaining squares were divided by thoroughfares {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide.

The commissioners constituted the local government until 1797, when a Commission of Streets and Markets was created by the General Assembly. Three main issues occupied most of their time: public drunkenness, gambling, and poor sanitation.

As one of the first [[planned community|planned cities]] in the United States, Columbia began to grow rapidly. Its population was nearing 1,000 shortly after the start of the 19th century.

[[File:Robert Mills House.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Mills House]] built 1823]]

In 1801, South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) was founded in Columbia. The original building survives. The city was chosen as the site of the institution in part to unite the citizens of the [[Upstate South Carolina|Upcountry]] and the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Lowcountry]] and to discourage the youth from migrating to England for their higher education. At the time, South Carolina sent more young men to England than did any other state. The leaders of South Carolina wished to monitor the progress and development of the school; for many years after the founding of the university, commencement exercises were held in December while the state legislature was in session.

Columbia received its first charter as a town in 1805. An intendant and six wardens  governed the town. [[John Taylor (South Carolina governor)|John Taylor]], the first elected intendant, later served in both houses of the General Assembly, both houses of Congress, and eventually as governor. By 1816,  250 homes were in the town and a population of more than 1000. Columbia became chartered as a city in 1854, with an elected mayor and six aldermen. Two years later, Columbia had a police force consisting of a full-time chief and nine patrolmen. The city continued to grow at a rapid pace, and throughout the 1850s and 1860s, Columbia was the largest inland city in the Carolinas. Railroad transportation served as a significant cause of population expansion in Columbia during this time. Rail lines that reached the city in the 1840s primarily transported cotton bales, not passengers. Cotton was the lifeblood of the Columbia community; in 1850, virtually all of the city's commercial and economic activity was related to cotton.

"In 1830, around 1,500 [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] lived and worked in Columbia; this population grew to 3,300 by 1860. Some members of this large enslaved population worked in their masters' households. Masters also frequently hired out slaves to Columbia residents and institutions, including South Carolina College. Hired-out slaves sometimes returned to their owners' homes daily; others boarded with their temporary masters."<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://slaveryatusc.weebly.com/urban-slavery-in-columbia.html|title=Urban Slavery in Columbia|work=Slavery at South Carolina College, 1801–1865:<br />The Foundations of the University of South Carolina|accessdate=September 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722215524/http://slaveryatusc.weebly.com/urban-slavery-in-columbia.html|archive-date=July 22, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> During this period, "legislators developed state and local statutes to restrict the movement of urban slaves in hopes of preventing rebellion. Although various decrees established [[curfew]]s and prohibited slaves from meeting and from learning to read and write, such rulings were difficult to enforce."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Indeed, "several prewar accounts note that many Columbia slaves were literate; some slaves even conducted classes to teach others to read and write." Also, "many slaves attended services at local Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist churches, yet some struggled to obtain membership in these institutions."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Columbia's [[First Baptist Church (Columbia, South Carolina)|First Baptist Church]] hosted the South Carolina Secession Convention on December 17, 1860. The delegates drafted a resolution in favor of [[secession]], 159–0. Columbia's location made it an ideal location for other conventions and meetings within [[Confederate States of America|the Confederacy]].

On February 17, 1865, in the last months of the Civil War, much of Columbia was [[Capture of Columbia|destroyed by fire]] while being occupied by [[Union Army|Union]] troops under the command of General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sherman|first1=William Tecumse|title=Burning of Columbia, South Carolina|date=2009|publisher=Great Neck Publishing|page=384}}</ref> Jeff Goodwyn, mayor of Columbia, sent William B. Stanley and Thomas W. Radcliffe to surrender the city to Sherman's troops. According to legend, Columbia's First Baptist Church barely missed being torched by Sherman's troops. The soldiers marched up to the church and asked the sexton if he could direct them to the First Baptist Church. The sexton directed the men to the nearby Washington Street Methodist Church; thus, the historic landmark was saved from destruction by Union soldiers, and the sexton preserved his employment at the cost of another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wsmethodist.org/about/our-history/|title=Washington Street Methodist Church - Our History|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908223526/http://wsmethodist.org/about/our-history/|archive-date=September 8, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Wade Hampton equestrian statue, Columbia, SC IMG 4747.JPG|thumb|right|Equestrian statue in Columbia of General and later [[governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton, III]], known for his opposition to [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]]]
The controversy surrounding the burning of the city started soon after the war ended. General Sherman blamed the high winds and retreating Confederate soldiers for firing bales of cotton, which had been stacked in the streets. General Sherman denied ordering the burning, though he did order militarily significant structures, such as the [[Confederate Printing Plant]], destroyed. Firsthand accounts by local residents, Union soldiers, and a newspaper reporter offer a tale of revenge by Union troops for Columbia and South Carolina's pivotal role in leading Southern states to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Today, tourists can follow the path General Sherman's army took to enter the city and see structures or remnants of structures that survived the fire.

During Reconstruction, Columbia became the focus of considerable attention. Reporters, journalists, travelers, and tourists flocked to South Carolina's capital city to witness a Southern state legislature whose members included former slaves. The city also made somewhat of a rebound following the devastating fire of 1865; a mild construction boom took place within the first few years of Reconstruction, and repair of railroad tracks in outlying areas created jobs for area citizens.

Following Reconstruction, the Columbia Music Festival Association <!-- (CMFA) --> was established in 1897,<ref>{{cite web|title=Mission|url=http://www.cmfaonline.com/OurAssociation/Mission.aspx|publisher=Columbia Music Festival Association|accessdate=August 23, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924020540/http://www.cmfaonline.com/OurAssociation/Mission.aspx|archivedate=September 24, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> by Mayor William McB. Sloan and the aldermen of the city of Columbia. It was headquartered in the Opera House on Main Street, which was also City Hall. Its role was to book and manage concerts and events in the opera house for the city.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The first few years of the 20th century had Columbia emerge as a regional textile manufacturing center. In 1907, Columbia had six mills in operation: [[Richland Cotton Mill|Richland]], [[Granby Mill Village Historic District|Granby]], [[Olympia Mill|Olympia]], Capital City, Columbia, and Palmetto. Combined, they employed over 3,400 workers with an annual payroll of $819,000, giving the Midlands an economic boost of over $4.8 million. Columbia had no paved streets until 1908, when 17 blocks of Main Street were surfaced. However, 115 publicly maintained street crossings were placed at intersections to keep pedestrians from having to wade through a sea of mud between wooden sidewalks. As an experiment, Washington Street was once paved with wooden blocks. This proved to be the source of much local amusement when they buckled and floated away during heavy rains. The blocks were replaced with asphalt paving in 1925.

The years 1911 and 1912 were something of a construction boom for Columbia, with $2.5 million worth of construction occurring in the city. These projects included the Union Bank Building at Main and Gervais, the [[Palmetto Building|Palmetto National Bank]], a shopping arcade, and large hotels at Main and Laurel (the Jefferson) and at Main and Wheat (the Gresham). In 1917, the city was selected as the site of [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Camp Jackson]], a U.S. military installation that was officially classified as a "Field Artillery Replacement Depot". The first recruits arrived at the camp on September 1, 1917.

In 1930, Columbia was the hub of a trading area with about 500,000 potential customers. It had 803 retail establishments, 280 of them being food stores. The city also had 58 clothing and apparel outlets, 57 restaurants and lunch rooms, 55 filling stations, 38 pharmacies, 20 furniture stores, 19 auto dealers, 11 shoe stores, nine cigar stands, five department stores, and one book store. Wholesale distributors located within the city numbered 119, with one-third of them dealing in food.

In 1934, the federal courthouse at the corner of Main and Laurel Streets was purchased by the city for use as City Hall. Built of granite from nearby [[Winnsboro, South Carolina|Winnsboro]], [[Columbia City Hall (South Carolina)|Columbia City Hall]] is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Designed by Alfred Built Millet, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s federal architect, the building was completed in 1876. Millet, best known for his design of the Executive Office Building in Washington, DC, had originally designed the building with a clock tower. Large cost overruns probably caused it to be left out. Copies of Mullet's original drawings can be seen on the walls of City Hall alongside historic photos of Columbia's beginnings. Federal offices were moved to the [[J. Bratton Davis United States Bankruptcy Courthouse]].

Reactivated Camp Jackson became Fort Jackson in 1940, giving the military installation the permanence desired by city leaders at the time. The fort was annexed into the city in the fall of 1968, with approval from [[the Pentagon]]. In the early 1940s, shortly after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, which began America's involvement in [[World War II]], Lt. Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle]] and his group of now-famous pilots began training for the [[Doolittle Raid]] over Tokyo at what is now [[Columbia Metropolitan Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiasouthcarolina.com/airport.html|title=Columbia Metropolitan Airport – Columbia, SC – Columbia's airport|accessdate=September 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322175251/http://www.columbiasouthcarolina.com/airport.html|archive-date=March 22, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> They trained in [[B-25 Mitchell]] bombers, the same model as the plane that now rests at Columbia's [[Owens Field]] in the [[Curtiss-Wright]] hangar.

The 1940s had the beginning of efforts to reverse [[Jim Crow laws]] and [[racism|racial discrimination]] in Columbia. In 1945, a federal judge ruled that the city's black teachers were entitled to equal pay to that of their white counterparts. However, in years following, the state attempted to strip many blacks of their teaching credentials. Other issues in which the blacks of the city sought equality concerned [[suffrage|voting rights]] and [[racial segregation|segregation]] (particularly regarding public schools). On August 21, 1962, eight downtown chain stores served blacks at their lunch counters for the first time. The University of South Carolina admitted its first black students in 1963; around the same time, many vestiges of segregation began to disappear from the city, blacks attained membership on various municipal boards and commissions, and a non-discriminatory hiring policy was adopted by the city. These and other such signs of racial progress helped earn the city the 1964 [[All-America City Award]] for the second time (the first being in 1951), and a 1965 article in ''[[Newsweek]]'' <!-- magazine --> lauded Columbia as a city that had "liberated itself from the plague of doctrinal [[apartheid]]."

Historic preservation has played a significant part in shaping Columbia into the city that it is today. The historic [[Robert Mills House]] was restored in 1967, which inspired the renovation and restoration of other historic structures such as the [[Hampton-Preston House]] and homes associated with President [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Maxcy Gregg]], [[Mary Boykin Chesnut]], and noted free black Celia Mann. In the early 1970s, the University of South Carolina initiated the refurbishment of its "Horseshoe". Several area museums also benefited from the increased historical interest of that time, among them the Fort Jackson Museum, the McKissick Museum on the campus of the University of South Carolina, and most notably the [[South Carolina State Museum]], which opened in 1988.

Mayor Kirkman Finlay, Jr., was the driving force behind the refurbishment of Seaboard Park, now known as [[Finlay Park]], in the historic Congaree Vista district, as well as the compilation of the $60 million Palmetto Center package, which gave Columbia an office tower, parking garage, and the Columbia Marriott, which opened in 1983. In 1980, the Columbia metropolitan population reached 410,088, and in 1990, this figure had hit roughly 470,000. The 1970s and 1980s had a rise in skyscrapers throughout Columbia. In 1973, The [[Tower at 1301 Gervais]] was constructed. In 1983, Hub at Columbia was constructed. In 1989, [[Bank of America]] Plaza was constructed. In 1987, [[Capitol Center (Columbia, South Carolina)|Capitol Center]] was constructed, becoming the tallest building in South Carolina.

===Recent history===
The 1990s and early 2000s saw revitalization in the downtown area. The [[Congaree Vista]] district along Gervais Street, once known as a warehouse district, became a thriving district of art galleries, shops, and restaurants. The [[Colonial Life Arena]] (formerly known as the Colonial Center) opened in 2002, and brought several big-named concerts and shows to Columbia. [[EdVenture]], the largest children's museum in the Southeast, opened in 2003. The [[Village at Sandhill]] shopping center opened in 2004 in Northeast Richland County. The Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center opened in 2004, and a new convention center hotel opened in September 2007. A public-private City Center Partnership has been formed to implement the downtown revitalization and boost downtown growth. In 2009, Columbia's most recent skyscraper, the Tower at Main and Gervais, was completed. Mayor [[Stephen K. Benjamin]] started his first term in July 2010, becoming the first black mayor in the city's history. [[Founders Park]], home of USC baseball, opened in 2009. The South Carolina Gamecocks baseball team won two NCAA national championships in 2010 and in 2011. The [[2010 South Carolina Gamecocks football]] team, under coach [[Steve Spurrier]], earned their first appearance in the SEC championship. A [[Mast General Store]] was opened in 2011. The [[Music Farm (music venue)|Music Farm]] opened a location in Columbia on Senate Street in 2014. In 2000, the Confederate battle flag was moved from the South Carolina State House to the Confederate monument. On July 10, 2015, the flag was removed from the monument to a museum. The fallout from the historic flooding in October 2015 forced the <!-- South Carolina --> Gamecocks football team to move their October 10 home game. [[Segra Park]] (formerly Spirit Communications Park), home of the [[Columbia Fireflies]], opened in April 2016. In 2017, the Gamecocks women's basketball team (under coach [[Dawn Staley]]) won their first NCAA championship, and the men's basketball team went to the Final Four for the first time.

==Geography==
[[File:South Carolina.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of Columbia taken from the [[International Space Station]]]]
[[File:Gervais_Street_Bridge,_Gervais_Street_spanning_Congaree_River,_Columbia_(Richland_County,_South_Carolina).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Gervais Street Bridge]] over the Congaree River]]
One of Columbia's more prominent geographical features is its fall line, the boundary between the upland [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont region]] and the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]], across which rivers drop as falls or rapids. Columbia grew up at the fall line of the Congaree River, which is formed by the convergence of the Broad and Saluda Rivers. The Congaree was the farthest inland point of river navigation. The energy of falling water also powered Columbia's early [[Cotton mill|mills]]. The city has capitalized on this location, which includes three rivers, by christening itself "The Columbia Riverbanks Region". Columbia is located roughly halfway between the Atlantic Ocean and the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and sits at an elevation around {{convert|292|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=May 27, 2002|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Soils in Columbia are well drained in most cases, with grayish brown loamy sand topsoil. The subsoil may be yellowish red sandy clay loam (Orangeburg series), yellowish brown sandy clay loam (Norfolk series), or strong brown sandy clay (Marlboro series). All belong to the [[Ultisol]] soil order.<ref>[http://soils.usda.gov/survey/online_surveys/south_carolina/richland/maps/gsm.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224224546/http://soils.usda.gov/survey/online_surveys/south_carolina/richland/maps/gsm.pdf |date=February 24, 2013 }}</ref><ref>[https://soilseries.sc.egov.usda.gov/OSD_Docs/O/ORANGEBURG.html Official Series Description - ORANGEBURG Series] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718230743/https://soilseries.sc.egov.usda.gov/OSD_Docs/O/ORANGEBURG.html |date=July 18, 2011 }}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|349.5|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|342.4|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|7.0|km2|order=flip}} is water (2.01%). Approximately ⅔ of Columbia's land area, {{convert|81.2|sqmi|km2}}, is contained within the Fort Jackson Military Installation, much of which consists of uninhabited training grounds. The actual inhabited area for the city is slightly more than {{convert|50|sqmi|km2}}.<ref name="CensusCity" />

=== Climate ===

Columbia has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with relatively cool to mild winters and hot and humid summers. The area averages 55 nights below freezing and is subject to temporary [[Cold wave|cold spells]] during the winter, but extended cold or days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing are both rare.<ref name = "NWS Columbia, SC (CAE)"/> These cold snaps usually result from atmospheric [[Trough (meteorology)|troughs]] that bring in cold air from Canada across the Eastern part of the country. The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] places Columbia in the 8a [[Hardiness zone|Hardiness Zone]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/planting-zones/south-carolina-planting-zones.htm|title=South Carolina Planting Zones – USDA Map Of South Carolina Growing Zones|website=Gardening Know How|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528221741/https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/planting-zones/south-carolina-planting-zones.htm|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

With an annual average of 5 days with {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ and 72 days with {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ temperatures,<ref name="NWS Columbia, SC (CAE)" /> the city's current promotional slogan describes Columbia as "Famously Hot".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiacvb.com|title=Columbia SC Official Website|accessdate=March 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013174629/http://www.columbiacvb.com/|archive-date=October 13, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> In the summer months, Columbia usually has the greatest high temperature in the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sercc.com/climateinfo/historical/mean90.html|title=Number of Days with Max Temperatures Equal to or Above 90°F for Selected Cities in the Southeast {{!}} Southeast Regional Climate Center|website=sercc.com|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528221749/http://sercc.com/climateinfo/historical/mean90.html|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> One reason for this is its low [[elevation]] in comparison to other cities at similar latitudes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.onthesnow.com/news/a/15157/does-elevation-affect-temperature|title=Does Elevation Affect Temperature?|website=OnTheSnow|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528221738/https://www.onthesnow.com/news/a/15157/does-elevation-affect-temperature|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, [[Atlanta]] has a significantly higher elevation, which helps to moderate its summer temperatures. Secondly, the city lies in the heart of the [[Sandhills (Carolina)|Sandhills]] region. Since the region's soils are more sandy, they contain less water and can warm up more quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://horticulture.tekura.school.nz/soils/soils-2/ht1032-soils-2-study-plan/soil-temperature/|title=Soil temperature {{!}} Te Kura Horticulture|website=horticulture.tekura.school.nz|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528221743/https://horticulture.tekura.school.nz/soils/soils-2/ht1032-soils-2-study-plan/soil-temperature/|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> This explains why usually only the high temperatures and not the low temperatures are much different than across the state. Thirdly, because of its distance from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], it does not receive the same moderating effects of coastal cities like [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. Lastly, the city experiences the [[urban heat island]] effect, making it significantly warmer than some surrounding towns and cities.

Precipitation, at {{convert|44.6|in|mm|sigfig=3}} annually, peaks in the summer months largely because of afternoon thunderstorms, and is the least during spring and fall.<ref name="NWS Columbia, SC (CAE)" /> Snowfall averages {{convert|1.5|in|cm|1}}, but is largely variable depending on the year.<ref name="NWS Columbia, SC (CAE)" /> Snow flurries usually do fall at least once during the winter season during its coldest periods. Like much of the southeastern U.S., the city is prone to [[Temperature inversion|inversions]], which trap ozone and other pollutants over the area.

Official extremes in temperature have ranged from {{convert|109|°F|0}} on [[Summer 2012 North American heat wave|June 29 and 30, 2012]] down to {{convert|−2|°F|0}}, set on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 14, 1899]], although a close second of {{convert|−1|°F|0}} was recorded on [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|January 21, 1985]], and the [[University of South Carolina]] campus reached {{convert|113|°F|0}} on June 29, 2012, establishing a new state record high.<ref name = "NWS Columbia, SC (CAE)"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/2012/13/supplemental/page-9/|title=National Overview - Annual 2012 - 2012 By The Numbers - State of the Climate - National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823195431/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/2012/13/supplemental/page-9/|archive-date=August 23, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Lady Street between Huger and Assembly streets in the Vista and the [[Five Points (Columbia)|Five Points neighborhood]] have undergone beautification projects, which mainly consisted of replacing curbs and gutters, and adding brick-paved sidewalks and angled parking.

Special revitalization efforts are being aimed at Main Street, which began seeing an exodus of department and specialty stores in the 1990s. The goal is to re-establish Main Street as a vibrant commercial and residential corridor, and the stretch of Main Street home to most businesses—-from Gervais to Blanding streets—-has been streetscaped in recent years. Notable developments completed in recent years along Main Street include an 18-story, $60 million tower at the high-profile corner of Main and Gervais streets, the renovation of the 1441 Main Street office building as the new Midlands headquarters for [[Wells Fargo]] Bank (formerly [[Wachovia]] Bank), a new sanctuary for the Holy Trinity [[Greek Orthodox]] Church, the location of Mast General store in the historic [[Efird's Department Store|Efird's building]], and the relocation of the Nickelodeon theater. A façade improvement program for the downtown business district, implemented in 2011, has resulted in the restoration and improvement of the façades of several historic Main Street shopfronts. One of the most ambitious development projects in the city's history is currently underway which involves old state mental health campus downtown on Bull Street. Known formally as Columbia Common, this project will consist of rehabbing several historic buildings on the campus, as well as constructing new buildings, for residential, hospitality, and retail use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wistv.com/story/22672800/city-will-announce-plans-for-old-bull-street-hospital-campus|title=City officials announce plans for old Bull Street hospital - wistv.com - Columbia, South Carolina -|author=Jack Kuenzie|date=June 24, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525234318/http://www.wistv.com/story/22672800/city-will-announce-plans-for-old-bull-street-hospital-campus|archive-date=May 25, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> A minor league baseball stadium was built on the campus in 2016.

==Parks and recreation==
[[File:FinlayPark.jpg|thumb|[[Finlay Park]]]]
[[Finlay Park]] has hosted events from festivals and political rallies to road races and Easter Sunrise services. This {{convert|18|acre|m2|adj=on}} park has had two lives; first dedicated in 1859 as Sidney Park, named in honor of Algernon Sidney Johnson, a Columbia City Councilman, the park experienced an illustrious but short tenure. The park fell into disrepair after the Civil War and served as a site for commercial ventures until the late 20th century. In 1990, the park was reopened. It serves as the site for such events as Kids Day, The Summer Concert Series, plus many more activities. In 1992, the park was renamed Finlay Park, in honor of Kirkman Finlay, a past mayor of Columbia who had a vision to reenergize the historic Congaree Vista district, between Main Street and the river, and recreate the site that was formerly known as Sidney Park. The  city has plans for an $18 million upgrade of the park in the near future which will include a redesigned parking lot near Laurel Street; a significant overhaul of the pond; construction of a pair of scenic streams; brand new shelters, restrooms, plazas, and performance stage; new waterfall features; and a new, large playground with a splash pad.

Memorial Park is a {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} tract of land in the Congaree Vista between Main Street and the river. The property is bordered by Hampton, Gadsden, Washington, and Wayne Streets and is one block south of Finlay Park. This park was created to serve as a memorial to those who served their country and presently has monuments honoring the [[USS Columbia]] warship and those that served with her during [[World War II]], the China-Burma-India Theater Veterans of WWII, casualties of the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack of December 7, 1941, who were from South Carolina, [[Holocaust survivors]] who live in South Carolina as well as concentration camp liberators from South Carolina, and the State [[Vietnam War]] Veterans. The park was dedicated in November 1986 along with the unveiling of the South Carolina Vietnam Monument. In June 2000, the [[Korean War]] Memorial was dedicated at Memorial Park. In November 2014, Columbia native and resident of Boston, Henry Crede, gave a bronze statue and plaza in the park dedicated to his WWII comrades who served in the Navy from South Carolina.

Granby Park opened in November 1998 as a gateway to the rivers of Columbia, adding another access to the many river activities available to residents. Granby is part of the Three Rivers Greenway, a system of green spaces along the banks of the rivers in Columbia, adding another piece to the long-range plan and eventually connecting to the existing Riverfront Park. Granby is a {{convert|24|acre|m2|adj=on}} linear park with canoe access points, fishing spots, bridges, and ½ mile of nature trail along the banks of the Congaree River.

In the Five Points district of downtown Columbia is the park dedicated to the legacy and memory of civil rights leader, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Formerly known as Valley Park, it was renamed in the late 1980s. The park features a water sculpture and a community center. An integral element of the park is the Stone of Hope monument, unveiled in January 1996. The monument is inscribed with a portion of King's 1964 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] acceptance speech: "History is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued that self-defeating path of hate. Love is the key to the solutions of the problems of the world."

Situated along the meandering Congaree River in central South Carolina, [[Congaree National Park]] is home to champion trees, primeval forest landscapes, and diverse plant and animal life. This {{convert|22200|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} park protects the largest contiguous tract of old-growth bottomland hardwood forest remaining in the United States. The park is an international [[biosphere reserve]]. Known for its giant hardwoods and towering pines, the park's floodplain forest includes one of the highest canopies in the world and some of the tallest trees in the eastern United States. Congaree National Park provides a sanctuary for plants and animals, a research site for scientists, and a place to walk and relax in a tranquil wilderness setting.

[[Sesquicentennial State Park]] is a {{convert|1419|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} park, featuring a {{convert|30|acre|m2|adj=on}} lake surrounded by trails and picnic areas. The park's proximity to downtown Columbia and three major interstate highways attracts both local residents and travelers. Sesquicentennial is often the site of family reunions and group campouts. Interpretive nature programs are a major attraction to the park. The park also contains a two-story log house, dating back to the mid 18th century, which was relocated to the park in 1969. This house is believed to be the oldest building still standing in Richland County. The park was originally built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Evidence of their craftsmanship is still present today.

In November 1996, the River Alliance proposed that a {{convert|12|mi|km|0|adj=on}} linear park system be created to link people to their rivers. This was named the Three Rivers Greenway, and the $18 million estimated cost was agreed to by member governments (the cities of [[Cayce, South Carolina|Cayce]], Columbia, and [[West Columbia, South Carolina|West Columbia]]) with the proviso that the Alliance recommend an acceptable funding strategy.

While the funding process was underway, an existing city of Columbia site located on the [[Congaree River]] offered an opportunity to be a pilot project for the Three Rivers Greenway. The Alliance was asked to design and permit for construction by a general contractor this component. This approximately one-half-mile segment of the system was opened in November 1998. It is complete with {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} wide concrete pathways, vandal-proof lighting, trash receptacles, water fountains, picnic benches, overlooks, bank fishing access, canoe/kayak access, a public restroom and parking. These set the standards for the common elements in the rest of the system. Eventually, pathways will run from Granby to the Riverbanks Zoo. Boaters, sportspeople, and fisherpeople will have access to the area, and additional recreational uses are being planned along the miles of riverfront.

Running beside the historic [[Columbia Canal]], Riverfront Park hosts a two and a half-mile trail. Spanning the canal is an old railway bridge that now is a pedestrian walkway. The park is used for walking, running, bicycling, and fishing. [[Picnic table]]s and benches dot the walking trail. Markers are located along the trail so that visitors can measure distance. The park is part of the Palmetto Trail, a hiking and biking trail that stretches the entire length of the state, from [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]] to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].

==Government==
[[File:Columbia, SC, City Hall IMG 4807.JPG|thumb|Columbia City Hall]]
The city of Columbia has a [[council-manager]] form of government. The mayor and [[city council]] are elected every four years, with no [[term limit]]s. Elections are held in the spring. Unlike other mayors in council-manager systems, the Columbia mayor has the power to veto [[local ordinance|ordinance]]s passed by the council; vetoes can be overridden by a two-thirds majority of the council, which appoints a [[city manager]] to serve as chief administrative officer. The current mayor is [[Stephen K. Benjamin]], who succeeded longtime mayor and fellow Democrat [[Bob Coble]] in 2010. Teresa Wilson is the current city manager.

The city council consists of six members, four from districts and two elected [[at-large]]. The city council is responsible for making policies and enacting laws, rules, and regulations in order to provide for future community and economic growth, in addition to providing the necessary support for the orderly and efficient operation of city services.
