==History==
[[File: Access Hollywood 2016 logo.png|thumb|right|Last logo from the first Access Hollywood era, from 2015 to 2017.]]
''Access Hollywood'' has aired nationally on various local stations, most of them affiliates of [[NBC]], in the United States since September&nbsp;9, 1996.  It was previously produced by [[Universal Television|NBC Studios]] and has changed distributors over the years, first with [[New World Pictures|New World/Genesis Distribution]], then [[20th Television]] (after [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] bought New World), followed by [[Warner Bros. Television Studios|Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution]] who still distributes the show today via barter ad-sales, and then to NBC Enterprises when the network started up its own syndication division. Today, [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]], in association with NBC's owned-and-operated station [[KNBC]] has been solely responsible for its production and distribution since 2004. Warner Bros. continues its involvement with the program by having responsibilities for barter ad sales for ''Access Hollywood''.

On September 13, 2010, ''Access Hollywood'' began broadcasting in high definition.<ref>[https://www.accessonline.com/articles/Billy-Bush-Kit-Hoover-to-co-host-Access-Hollywood-Live-88982 ''Billy Bush & Kit Hoover To Co-Host 'Access Hollywood Live' ''].

===''Access Across America''===
In [[2005 in American television]], ''Access Hollywood'' went on a month-long roadtrip called ''Access Across America'' while the studio underwent a major overhaul. The show's new set was done in  pastel colors with a modern flair, separating its look from other similar shows, including rival ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''. The new look also included a brand-new graphics package. ''Access Hollywood'' is taped at Studio&nbsp;1 at [[The Burbank Studios]] (formerly NBC Studios) in [[Burbank, California]], former home of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. Currently with ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', it was one of two remaining NBC-produced programs as of 2014 originating from Burbank; ''Access Hollywood'' moved to [[Universal City, California]] and [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] in 2015 as NBC's operations continue to combine in Universal City.

==Spin-offs==
The program has had some short-lived spinoffs in the last few years, including ''AMC Access'' for the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] channel, and ''Real Access'' (the first teen-oriented entertainment news program, and the only attempt so far at an entertainment news program aimed at teens on television) for [[Noggin (brand)|The N]] and [[Nickelodeon]]. The network most recently produced the African-American oriented ''TV&nbsp;One Access'' for the [[TV One (American TV channel)|TV One]] cable channel. The programs formerly did entertainment segments for [[NBCUniversal]]'s cable news channel titled ''Access [[MSNBC]]'', though these have been withdrawn as MSNBC's news coverage has become mainly political.
