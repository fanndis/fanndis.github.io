Petrobras was created in 1953 under the government of Brazilian president [[Getúlio Vargas]] with the slogan "The Oil is Ours" (Portuguese: "O petróleo é nosso"). It was given a legal monopoly in Brazil.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21643224-one-many-casualties-petrobras-scandal-misguided-industrial-policy-whose-oil | title=Whose oil in Brazil? | work=[[The Economist]] | author=Bello | date=14 February 2015}}</ref> In 1953, Brazil produced only 2,700 barrels of oil per day.<ref name=wapo/> In 1961, the company's REDUC refinery began operations near Rio de Janeiro,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/petrobras-halts-some-reduc-refinery-ops-after-fire-2011-12-26 | title=Petrobras halts some Reduc refinery ops after fire | work=[[MarketWatch]] | first=Diana | last=Kinch | date=26 December 2011}}</ref> and in 1963, its [[Cenpes]] research center opened in [[Rio de Janeiro]]; it remains one of the world's largest centers dedicated to energy research.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.brasil.gov.br/centro-aberto-de-midia/news/press-tour-to-the-petrobras-research-and-development-center-cenpes-on-monday-30-june | title=Press Tour to the Petrobras Research and Development Center (Cenpes) on Monday, 30 June | publisher=[[Brazilian Government]] | date=24 June 2014}}</ref> In 1968, the company established Petrobras Quimica S.A ("Petroquisa"), a subsidiary focused on [[petrochemical]]s and the conversion of [[naphtha]] into [[ethene]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Petrobras Quimica SA Petroquisa - Company Profile and News - Bloomberg Markets|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/PTQS3:BZ|access-date=2020-09-17|website=Bloomberg.com}}</ref>

Petrobras had begun processing [[oil shale]] in 1953, developing the [[Petrosix]] technology for extracting oil from oil shale. It began using an industrial-size [[retort]] to process shale in the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aapg.org/divisions/emd|title=Energy Minerals Division|website=www.aapg.org}}</ref> In 2006, Petrobras said that their industrial retort had the capacity to process 260 tonnes/hour of oil shale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.costar-mines.org/oss_archive/files/25OSSP/25_09_ADR.pdf|title=PETROSIX INDUSTRIAL PLANT IN OPERATION}}</ref>

In 1994, Petrobras put the [[Petrobras 36]], the world's largest [[oil platform]], into service. It sank after an explosion in 2001 and was a complete loss.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.versatel.nl/the_sims/rig/p36.htm|title=Petrobras P-36|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> In 1997, the government approved Law N.9.478, which broke Petrobras's monopoly and allowed competition in Brazil's oilfields, and also created the [[National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (Brazil)|national petroleum agency]] Agência Nacional do Petróleo, (ANP) responsible for the regulation and supervision of the petroleum industry, and the National Council of Energy Policies, a public agency responsible for developing public energy policy.<ref name=brazilbusiness/> In 1999, the National Petroleum Agency signed agreements with other companies, ending the company's monopoly.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.offshore-mag.com/articles/print/volume-59/issue-11/departments/international-focus/monopoly-ends-for-brazils-petrobras.html | title=Monopoly ends for Brazil's Petrobras | publisher=[[Offshore Magazine]] | date=1 November 1999}}</ref>

In 2005, Petrobras announced a [[joint venture]] with Nippon Alcohol Hanbai KK to sell Brazilian [[ethanol]] to Japan, called Brazil-Japan Ethanol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petrobras.com/en/countries/japan/japan.htm|title=Japan - Petrobras|author=Ative Soluções|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> On 21 April 2006, the company started production on the P-50 oil platform in the [[Albacora-Leste oil field|Albacora East field]] at Campos Basin, which made Brazil self-sufficient in oil production.<ref name=wapo>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/21/AR2006042100139.html | title=New Rig Brings Brazil Oil Self-Sufficiency | agency=[[Associated Press]] | work=[[Washington Post]] | first=Peter | last=Muello | date=21 April 2006}}</ref> By November 2015, the company had accumulated $128 billion in debt, 84% of it denominated in foreign currencies.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-19/the-boys-from-the-bank-of-brazil-race-petrobras-debt-clock | title=Petrobras's Dangerous Debt Math: $24 Billion Owed in 24 Months | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | date=18 November 2015}}</ref>

===Production===
In 1961, Petrobras geologist [[Walter K. Link]] published [[Link's memorandum]], which implied that the company was better off exploring offshore instead of onshore.<ref>{{cite journal | title=From the Archivists Corner - Linkages | journal=The Outcrop | year=2001 | first=Robert | last=Dott | pages=14–17 | url=http://www.geology.wisc.edu/outcrop/01/01pdfs/Linkages_R_Dott.pdf }}</ref> In 1963, Petrobras discovered the {{ILL|Recôncavo baiano|pt|Recôncavo}} and [[Carmópolis]] oil fields.<ref name=brazilbusiness>{{cite web | url=http://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/understand-petrobras | title=Understand Petrobras | publisher=The Brazil Business | author=Andréa Novais | date=24 November 2011}}</ref>

The company's growth was halted by the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The entire country was affected, and the "Brazilian miracle", a period when annual [[GDP]] growth exceeded 10%, ended. Petrobras nearly went bankrupt.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GeDGBQAAQBAJ|title=The Alignment Factor|accessdate=5 May 2016|isbn=9781136445460|last1=Van Riel|first1=Cees B. M.|date=29 March 2012}}</ref>
In 1974, the company discovered an oil field in the [[Campos Basin]]. This discovery boosted its finances and helped it restructure nationwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petrobras.com.br/en/our-activities/main-operations/basins/campos-basin.htm |title=Campos Basin|work=Petrobras|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> In 1975, the [[Brazilian Government]] temporarily allowed foreign operators into Brazil, and Petrobras signed exploration contracts with foreign companies for oilfields in Brazil.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/07/business/us-oil-and-gas-companies-test-waters-in-brazil-again.html | title=U.S. Oil and Gas Companies Test Waters in Brazil, Again | work=[[New York Times]] | author=James Brooke | date=7 November 1994}}</ref>

The company was affected by the [[1979 energy crisis]], although not nearly as badly as in 1973.

In 1997, Petrobras reached the production milestone of {{convert|1|Moilbbl|m3}} per day. The company also executed agreements with other Latin American governments and began operations outside Brazil.<ref name=wharton>{{cite news | url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/now-50-petrobras-the-brazilian-national-oil-company-has-aged-well/ | title=Now 50, Petrobras, the Brazilian National Oil Company, Has Aged Well | publisher=[[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] | date=8 October 2003}}</ref>

In 2003, on its 50-year anniversary, Petrobras surpassed {{convert|2|e6BOE|lk=in}} of daily production.<ref name=wharton/> On 1 May 2006, after the [[Bolivian gas conflict]], Bolivia's president [[Evo Morales]] announced the nationalization of all [[Geology of Bolivia|gas and oil fields in the country]] and ordered the occupation of all fields by the [[Bolivian Army]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/01/world/americas/01cnd-bolivia.html | title=Bolivia Nationalizes Natural Gas Industry | work=[[New York Times]] | author=Christine Hauser | date=1 May 2006}}</ref> On 4 May 2006, Petrobras cancelled a major future investment plan in Bolivia as a result.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4971832.stm | title=Petrobras scraps Bolivia project | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=4 May 2006}}</ref> The Bolivian government demanded an increase in royalty payments from foreign petroleum companies to 82%, but eventually settled for a 50% royalty interest.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/8108328 | title=A hard bargain: Evo Morales deals and wins on gas | publisher=[[The Economist]] | date=2 November 2006}}</ref>

In 2007, Petrobras inaugurated the Petrobras 52 Oil Platform. The 52 is the biggest Brazilian oil platform and the third-biggest in the world.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/2007/11/petrobras-starts-production-tests-at-p-52-platform.html | title=Petrobras starts production tests at P-52 platform | publisher=[[Oil and Gas Journal]] | date=26 November 2007}}</ref>

In 2007 and 2008, Petrobras made several major oil discoveries including the [[Tupi oil field]] (formerly known as the Lula oil field), the [[Jupiter field]], and the [[Sugar Loaf field]], all in the [[Santos Basin]], 300&nbsp;km off the coast of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The oil fields were discovered by partnerships that include Petrobras, [[Royal Dutch Shell]], and [[Galp Energia]]. However, estimates for the reserves of these new fields varied widely.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/13348824 | title=The next oil giant? | publisher=[[The Economist]] | date=19 March 2009}}</ref>

==Operation Car Wash{{anchor|Scandal}} and related protests in Brazil==
{{main|Operation Car Wash}}
{{main|2015 protests in Brazil}}

In 2014, the largest [[corruption]] [[scandal]] in the history of Brazil was uncovered centered around Petrobras. Initially, the investigation was not focused on Petrobras executives, but rather small time [[:wikt:doleiros|doleiros]] (black market money dealers), who mostly used small businesses to carry out their transactions. The investigation discovered links to an executive at Petrobras, {{ill|Paulo Roberto Costa|pt}}, the director of refining and supply.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/01/brazil-operation-car-wash-is-this-the-biggest-corruption-scandal-in-history|title=Operation Car Wash: The biggest corruption scandal ever?|first=Jonathan|last=Watts|date=1 June 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> President Dilma Rousseff made one critical change in policy, the introduction of plea bargains, making it possible to offer deals in exchange for information leading to further arrests.<ref name="theguardian.com"/> It was a defining moment of the investigation. Costa later confessed that he and his colleagues had knowingly overpaid on contracts, funneling excess funds to personal accounts. Paulo Costa received kickbacks of 3% on all contracts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30129184|title=Scandal strains Brazil's giant Petrobras|first=Ruth|last=Costas|date=21 November 2014|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> According to the investigation, a small number of top Petrobras officials colluded with an organized cartel of 16 companies to overcharge Petrobras for construction and service work in return for bribes and kickbacks. Petrobras officials pegged the total of all bribes at nearly $3 billion. As of August 2015, 117 [[indictment]]s had been issued, five politicians arrested, and criminal cases brought against 13 companies. Both [[Dilma Rousseff]], who promised to cut corruption in her election campaign, and former Brazilian president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] served on the board of directors of Petrobras during the scandals and both were blamed, as well as the president of the lower house, [[Eduardo Cunha]]. Cunha was sentenced in March 2017 to 15 years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|agency=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39442005|date=30 March 2017|accessdate=28 April 2017| title=Brazil ex-speaker Eduardo Cunha jailed for 15 years}}</ref>
Lula was implicated in multiple corruption investigations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-idUSKCN12A2C8|work=Reuters|author=Brad Brooks|title=Lula charged over Odebrecht Angola work in Brazil graft probe|date=10 October 2016|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref>

Protests broke out calling for the resignation or impeachment of Rousseff. The most widespread of these occurred on 13 March 2016 in over 300 municipalities. Police estimates gave about 3.5 million protestors throughout the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2016/03/manifestacoes-contra-governo-dilma-ocorrem-pelo-pais.html|language=pt|publisher=O Globo|title=Manifestantes fazem maior protesto nacional contra o governo Dilma|date=13 March 2016}}</ref> Some of the protests were in areas previously thought of as strongholds of the Workers Party, of which Rousseff was the leader.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/13/brazil-anti-government-protests-dilma-rousseff-rio-de-janeiro|title=More than a million Brazilians protest against 'horror' government|first=Jonathan|last=Watts|date=14 March 2016|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>

The [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] sued Petrobras and its auditors, [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]] as a result of the corruption scandal.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/11892400/Bill-Gates-sues-oil-giant-Petrobras-and-PwC-over-corruption-scandal.html | title=Bill Gates sues oil giant Petrobras and PwC over corruption scandal | publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]] | date=25 September 2015}}</ref> Later in September 2018, Petrobras agreed to pay $853.2 million as a settlement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/petrobras-to-pay-853-2-million-to-settle-corruption-investigations-in-u-s-brazil-1538051052|title=Petrobras to Pay $853.2 Million to Settle Corruption Probes in U.S., Brazil|last1=Viswanatha|first1=Aruna|date=2018-09-27|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-09-28|last2=Lewis|first2=Jeffrey T.|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660|last3=Rubenfeld|first3=Samuel}}</ref>

==Environmental record==

Petrobras's website notes several initiatives to preserve the environment. These include efforts to support both ocean and forest ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petrobras.com/en/magazine/post/mapping-to-preserve.htm|title=Mapping to preserve|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> Most notably, Petrobras has sponsored [[population studies]] and conservation efforts for humpback whales in northeast Brazil. The company's efforts helped to rebuild Brazil's humpback whale populations from 2,000 in the mid-nineties to over 9,000 in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/08/18/maybe-petrobras-isnt-so-horrible-afterall/|title=Maybe Petrobras Isn't So Horrible After All|first=Kenneth|last=Rapoza|website=Forbes}}</ref>

Petrobras subscribes to the [[United Nations Global Compact]], a voluntary agreement regarding human rights, [[working condition]]s, [[corruption]], and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/participation/report/cop/create-and-submit/advanced/165411|title=Petroleo Brasileiro SA - Petrobras – 2015 Communication on Progress - UN Global Compact|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref>
