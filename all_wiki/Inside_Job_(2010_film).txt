'''''Inside Job''''' is a 2010 American [[documentary film]], directed by [[Charles H. Ferguson|Charles Ferguson]], about the [[late-2000s financial crisis]]. Ferguson, who began researching in 2008,<ref>{{url|1=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130272396}}</ref> says the film is about "the systemic corruption of the United States by the [[financial services]] industry and the consequences of that systemic corruption".<ref>(February 25, 2011). {{YouTube|vS0hj4kiqsA|"Charlie Rose Interviews Charles Ferguson on his documentary 'Inside Job'"}}. Retrieved October 25, 2011.</ref> In five parts, the film explores how changes in the policy environment and banking practices helped create the financial crisis.

''Inside Job'' was acclaimed by film critics, who praised its pacing, research and exposition of complex material. It screened at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]] in May and won the 2010 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].

==Synopsis==
The documentary is split into five parts. It begins by examining how Iceland was highly deregulated in 2000 and the [[privatization]] of its banks. When [[Lehman Brothers]] went bankrupt and [[American International Group|AIG]] collapsed, [[Iceland]] and the rest of the world went into a global recession. At the [[Federal Reserve]] annual [[Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City#Economic%20policy%20symposium|Jackson Hole conference]] in 2005, [[Raghuram Rajan]], then the chief economist of IMF, warned about the growing risks in the financial system and proposed policies that would reduce such risks. Former [[U.S. Treasury Secretary]] [[Lawrence Summers]] called the warnings "misguided" and Rajan himself a "[[Luddite#In%20modern%20thought|luddite]]". However, following the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], Rajan's views were seen as prescient and he was extensively interviewed for this movie.

=== Part I: How We Got Here ===
The American financial industry was regulated from 1941 to 1981, followed by a long period of deregulation. At the end of the 1980s, a [[savings and loan crisis]] cost taxpayers about $124 billion. In the late 1990s, the financial sector had consolidated into a few giant firms. In March 2000, the [[Dot-com bubble|Internet Stock Bubble]] burst because investment banks promoted Internet companies that they knew would fail, resulting in $5 trillion in investor losses. In the 1990s, [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s became popular in the industry and added instability. Efforts to regulate derivatives were thwarted by the [[Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000]], backed by several key officials. In the 2000s, the industry was dominated by five investment banks ([[Goldman Sachs]], [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Lehman Brothers]], [[Merrill Lynch]], and [[Bear Stearns]]), two financial conglomerates ([[Citigroup]], [[JPMorgan Chase]]), three [[securitized]] insurance companies (AIG, [[MBIA]], [[Ambac|AMBAC]]) and [[Big Three (credit rating agencies)|the three]] rating agencies ([[Moody's Investors Service|Moody’s]], [[Standard & Poor's]], [[Fitch Ratings|Fitch]]). Investment banks bundled mortgages with other loans and debts into [[collateralized debt obligations]] (CDOs), which they sold to investors. Rating agencies gave many CDOs [[bond credit rating|AAA ratings]]. [[Subprime loans]] led to predatory lending. Many home owners were given loans they could never repay.

=== Part II: The Bubble (2001–2007) ===
During the housing boom, the ratio of money borrowed by an investment bank versus the bank's own assets reached unprecedented levels. The [[credit default swap]] (CDS), was akin to an insurance policy. Speculators could buy CDSs to bet against CDOs they did not own. Numerous CDOs were backed by subprime mortgages. Goldman-Sachs sold more than $3 billion worth of CDOs in the first half of 2006. Goldman also bet against the low-value CDOs, telling investors they were high-quality. The three biggest ratings agencies contributed to the problem. AAA-rated instruments rocketed from a mere handful in 2000 to over 4,000 in 2006.

=== Part III: The Crisis ===
The market for CDOs collapsed and investment banks were left with hundreds of billions of dollars in loans, CDOs, and real estate they could not unload. The [[Great Recession]] began in November 2007, and in March 2008, Bear Stearns ran out of cash. In September, the federal government took over [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]], which had been on the brink of collapse. Two days later, Lehman Brothers collapsed. These entities all had AA or AAA ratings within days of being bailed out. Merrill Lynch, on the edge of collapse, was acquired by [[Bank of America]]. [[Henry Paulson]] and [[Timothy Geithner]] decided that Lehman must go into bankruptcy, which resulted in a collapse of the [[commercial paper]] market.  On September 17, the insolvent AIG was taken over by the government. The next day, Paulson and Fed chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] asked Congress for $700 billion to bail out the banks. The [[global financial system]] became paralyzed. On October 3, 2008, President [[George W. Bush]] signed the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]], but global stock markets continued to fall. Layoffs and foreclosures continued with unemployment rising to 10% in the U.S.A. and the [[European Union]]. By December 2008, [[General Motors|GM]] and [[Chrysler]] also faced bankruptcy. Foreclosures in the U.S. reached unprecedented levels.

=== Part IV: Accountability ===
Top executives of the insolvent companies walked away with their personal fortunes intact. The executives had hand-picked their [[Board of directors|boards of directors]], which handed out billions in bonuses after the government bailout. The major banks grew in power and doubled anti-reform efforts. Academic economists had for decades advocated for deregulation and helped shape U.S. policy. They still opposed reform after the 2008 crisis. Some of the consulting firms involved were the [[Analysis Group]], [[Charles River Associates]], [[Jonathan Orszag|Compass Lexecon]], and the Law and Economics Consulting Group ([[LECG]]). Many of these economists had conflicts of interest, collecting sums as consultants to companies and other groups involved in the financial crisis.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203436904577148940410667970|title=Economists Set Rules on Ethics |first=Ben |last=Casselman |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=January 9, 2012 |accessdate=January 9, 2012}}</ref>

=== Part V: Where We Are Now ===
Tens of thousands of U.S. factory workers were laid off. The incoming [[Obama administration]]’s financial reforms were weak, and there was no significant proposed regulation of the practices of ratings agencies, lobbyists, and executive compensation. Geithner became Treasury Secretary. [[Martin Feldstein]], [[Laura Tyson]] and [[Lawrence Summers]] were all top economic advisers to Obama. Bernanke was reappointed Fed Chair. European nations imposed strict regulations on bank compensation, but the U.S. resisted them.
