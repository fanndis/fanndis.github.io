'''Cyber-shot''' is [[Sony]]'s line of [[point-and-shoot camera|point-and-shoot]] [[digital camera]]s introduced in 1996. Cyber-shot model names use a DSC prefix, which is an initialism for "Digital Still Camera". Many Cyber-shot models feature [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss]] trademarked lenses, while others use Sony, or Sony G lenses.

All Cyber-shot cameras accept Sony's proprietary [[Memory Stick]] or [[Memory Stick#Memory PRO Duo|Memory Stick PRO Duo]] flash memory. Select models have also supported [[CompactFlash]]. Current Cyber-shot cameras support Memory Stick PRO Duo, [[Secure Digital|SD]], [[SDHC]], and [[SDXC]].

==Features==
===3D===
Some Cyber-shot models can take 3D stills by shooting two images using two different focus settings. The technology uses one lens only for the process, and users can later see the images on a [[3D TV]] or on a regular 2D screen. The cameras have been available since 2010.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.techhive.com/article/200591/sony_3d_cybershots.html| title=Sony Adds 3D Shooting to New Cyber-shot Cameras}}</ref>

===Geotagging===
Some Cyber-Shot models such as the [[Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX20V|DSC-HX20V]], [[Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX90V|DSC-HX90V]], [[Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V|DSC-HX200V]] and the [[Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX400V|DSC-HX400V]] have a built-in [[GPS]] so the user can have their photos automatically geotagged as they are being taken. The feature can also serve as a compass as it shows the user's position on the camera screen.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.sony.co.uk/hub/geotagging| title=Camera with GPS Sony| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026072621/http://www.sony.co.uk/hub/geotagging| archivedate=October 26, 2013| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Tru Black===
Tru Black is a technology developed by Sony which allows a better visualization of the screen, even when there is too much light. It enables LCD screens to automatically change the display contrast in order to enhance the controlling reflectance.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/technology/technology/theme/trublack_01.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112183544/http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/technology/technology/theme/trublack_01.html| archivedate=2014-01-12|title= TruBlack Display}}</ref> In other words, when light hits a display with Tru Black technology, the screen turns opaque as a means to improve the visualization of the content.

===Panorama===
All current Cyber-shot cameras are equipped with a [[Panoramic photography|panoramic]] technology branded as Sweep Panorama, which enables the user to capture  wide format photographs using only one lens. The photos can be taken and displayed in 2D or 3D.
