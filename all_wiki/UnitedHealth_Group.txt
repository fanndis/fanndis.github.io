* UnitedHealthcare Employer and Individual - provides health benefit plans and services for large national employers
* UnitedHealthcare Medicare and Retirement - provides health and well-being services to individuals age 65 and older.<ref name=10K/>
* UnitedHealthcare Community and State - serves state programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved, and people without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program.<ref name=10K/>
* UnitedHealthcare Global - serves 6.2 million people with medical benefits, residing principally in [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]] and Peru but also in more than 130 other countries.<ref name=10K/>

==Health insurance plans==
UnitedHealthcare offers commercial [[group insurance]] plans across the United States under several product names with different offerings.<ref name=AdministrativeGuide>{{cite web| url=https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/admin-guides/UnitedHealthcare_Administrative_Guide_2017.pdf| title=UnitedHealthcare Care Provider Administrative Guide| website=United Healthcare| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181125103150/https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/admin-guides/UnitedHealthcare_Administrative_Guide_2017.pdf| archive-date=November 25, 2018| url-status=dead| access-date=November 25, 2018}}</ref>
* '''UnitedHealthcare Select''' is [[exclusive provider organization]] (EPO) with no coverage for out-of-network providers<ref name=Terms>{{cite web | url=https://www.uhc.com/content/dam/uhcdotcom/en/NationalAccounts/ConsultantEnrollmentResources/Consultant_Enrollment_Resoruces_UHC_Acronyms.pdf| title=UnitedHealthcare Terms and Acronyms |website=United Healthcare|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730064935/https://www.uhc.com/content/dam/uhcdotcom/en/NationalAccounts/ConsultantEnrollmentResources/Consultant_Enrollment_Resoruces_UHC_Acronyms.pdf|archive-date=2018-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref>
* '''UnitedHealthcare Select Plus''' is a [[preferred provider organization]] (PPO).<ref name=Terms/>
* '''UnitedHealthcare Choice''' functions as a HMO plan with access to specialists,<ref name=Terms/> whereas UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus is an HMO which allows for out-of-network coverage.<ref name=Terms/>
* '''UnitedHealthcare Navigate, Charter, and Compass''' require a [[primary care physician]] referral to see a specialist<ref name=AdministrativeGuide/> meaning that they are more restrictive [[managed care]] plans, similar to [[point of service plan]]s.

===Provider networks===
UnitedHealthcare negotiates with providers in periodic contract negotiation; contracts may be discontinued from time to time.<ref name=AdministrativeGuide/> High-profile contract disputes can span provider networks across the nation, as in the case of a 2018 dispute with a major emergency room doctor group, [[Envision Healthcare]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uhc.com/erfacts|title=Envision and ER Costs|publisher=UnitedHealth Group|access-date=November 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181125204036/https://www.uhc.com/erfacts|archive-date=November 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Provider directory===
Maintaining up-to-date provider directories is necessary since the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] can fine insurers with outdated directories.<ref name=blockchain>{{cite web| url=https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/unitedhealthcare-optum-humana-multiplan-and-quest-diagnostics-launch-blockchain-provider| title=UnitedHealthcare, Optum, Humana, MultiPlan and Quest Diagnostics launch blockchain provider director pilot| website=Healthcare Finance News| access-date=November 25, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181125162556/https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/unitedhealthcare-optum-humana-multiplan-and-quest-diagnostics-launch-blockchain-provider| archive-date=November 25, 2018| url-status=live}}</ref> As a condition of participation, UnitedHealthcare requires that providers notify them of changes, but also has a Professional Verification Outreach program to proactively request information from providers.<ref name=AdministrativeGuide/> However, providers are burdened by having to maintain their information with multiple networks (e.g., competitors to UnitedHealthcare). The total cost of maintaining these directories is estimated at $2.1b annually, and a [[blockchain]] initiative began in 2018 to share the directory.<ref name=blockchain/>

In 2010, UnitedHealth Group spent more than $1.8 million on [[lobbying]] activities to work to achieve favorable legislation, and hired seven different lobbying firms to work on its behalf.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]] | url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?lname=UnitedHealth+Group&year=2010 | title=UnitedHealth Group}}</ref> In addition, its corporate political action committee or [[Political Action Committee|PAC]], called United for Health, spent an additional $1 million on lobbying activities in 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00274431&cycle=2010 | title=UnitedHealth Group | publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]] | access-date=February 4, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226155942/http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00274431&cycle=2010 | archive-date=December 26, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Legal issues==
In 2006, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth Group's management and directors, for [[Options backdating|backdating of stock options]]. Investigations were also begun by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, who subpoenaed documents from the company. The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in May 2006, discussing apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of [[stock options]] by UHC management. The backdating apparently occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, according to the ''Journal''. Major shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Thomas Kean]] and UHC's other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty.<ref>{{cite news | first=Joe | last=Conason | url=https://www.salon.com/2006/09/15/kean_3/ | title=Jersey hustler | work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] | date=September 15, 2006 | access-date=June 23, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190623161747/https://www.salon.com/2006/09/15/kean_3/ | archive-date=June 23, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref> On October 15, 2006, CEO [[William W.

===OptumInsight, aka Ingenix===
In February 2008, New York State Attorney General [[Andrew Cuomo]] announced an industry-wide investigation into a scheme by health insurers to defraud consumers by manipulating reasonable and customary rates. The announcement included a statement that Cuomo intended "to file suit against Ingenix, Inc., its parent UnitedHealth Group, and three additional subsidiaries." Cuomo asserted that his investigation found that rates found in a database of health care charges maintained by Ingenix were lower than what he determined was the actual cost of certain medical expenses. Cuomo said this inappropriately allowed health insurance companies to deny a portion of provider claims, thereby pushing costs down to members.<ref>[http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2008/feb/feb13a_08.html "Cuomo Announces Industry-Wide Investigation into Health Insurer's Fraudulent Reimbursement Scheme"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330043123/http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2008/feb/feb13a_08.html | date=March 30, 2008}}, press release, Office of the Attorney General, New York State, February 13, 2008</ref>

On January 13, 2009, Ingenix announced an agreement with the New York State attorney settling the probe into the independence of the health pricing database. Under the settlement, UnitedHealth Group and Ingenix would pay $50 million to finance a new, non-profit entity that would develop a new health care pricing database. Ingenix would discontinue its medical pricing databases when the new entity makes its product available. The company acknowledged the appearance of a conflict of interest but admitted no wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/unitedhealth/update-2-unitedhealth-settles-new-york-reimbursement-probe-idUSN1338639920090113 |title=UPDATE 2-UnitedHealth settles New York reimbursement probe |work=[[Reuters]] |date=January 13, 2009 |access-date=June 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190623161749/https://www.reuters.com/article/unitedhealth/update-2-unitedhealth-settles-new-york-reimbursement-probe-idUSN1338639920090113 |archive-date=June 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On January 15, 2009, UnitedHealth Group announced a $350 million settlement of three class action lawsuits filed in Federal court by the [[American Medical Association]], UnitedHealth Group members, healthcare providers, and state medical societies for not paying out-of-network benefits. This settlement came two days after a similar settlement with Cuomo.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/unitedhealth/update-2-unitedhealth-settles-payment-suits-for-350-million-idUSN1531133620090115 | title=UPDATE 2-UnitedHealth settles payment suits for $350 million| first=Lewis | last=Krauskopf |date=January 15, 2009 | work=[[Reuters]] | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220052804/http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssHealthcareNews/idUSN1531133620090115|archive-date=February 20, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On October 27, 2009, Cuomo announced the creation of FAIR Health, the independent, non-profit organization that will develop a nationwide database for consumer reimbursement, as well as a website where consumers will be able to compare prices before they choose doctors. To fund FAIR Health, the Attorney General's office secured nearly $100 million from insurers such as [[Aetna]], UnitedHealth Group, and [[Anthem Inc.]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuomo-healthcare/cuomo-sets-healthcare-reimbursement-reform-idUSTRE59Q3D320091027 |title=Cuomo sets healthcare reimbursement reform| first=Jonathan | last=Stempel

===Options backdating investigations and lawsuits===
In 2006, the SEC began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth Group's management and directors, including Dr. McGuire, as did the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, who have subpoenaed documents from the company.

The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in March 2006, discussing the apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock optionsâ€”in a process called [[options backdating]]â€”by UnitedHealth Group management.<ref>Charles Forelle & James Bandler, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114265075068802118 "The Perfect Payday"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809130918/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114265075068802118 | date=August 9, 2017}}, ''The Wall Street Journal'' newspaper, March 18, 2006</ref>
The backdating apparently occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, according to the ''Journal''. Major shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Thomas Kean]] and UnitedHealth Group's other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty.<ref>{{cite news | first=Loren | last=Steffy | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/biz/4318193.html | title=How William McGuire earned that fat paycheck | work=[[Houston Chronicle]] | date=November 7, 2006 | access-date=January 16, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329042755/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/biz/4318193.html | archive-date=March 29, 2008 | url-status=dead }},</ref>

===Resignation of McGuire===
On October 15, 2006, it was announced that [[William W. McGuire]] would step down immediately as chairman and director of UnitedHealth Group, and step down as CEO on December 1, 2006, due to his involvement in the employee stock options scandal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chief executive at U.S. health insurer forced out |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/16/business/worldbusiness/16iht-web.1016united.3168637.html| work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 16, 2006}}</ref> Simultaneously, it was announced that he would be replaced as CEO by Stephen Hemsley, who has served as President and COO and is a member of the board of directors. McGuire's exit compensation from UnitedHealth, expected to be around $1.1 billion, would be the largest [[golden parachute]] in the history of corporate America.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/biz/4318193.html|title=Steffy: How William McGuire earned that fat paycheck | work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329042755/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/biz/4318193.html | archive-date=March 29, 2008 | df=mdy-all}}</ref>

McGuire's compensation became controversial again on May 21, 2009, when [[Elizabeth Edwards]], speaking on ''[[The Daily Show]]'', used it to support her argument for a public alternative to commercial insurance.<ref>[http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/05/21/elizabeth-edwards-1-of-every-700-went-to-pay-salary-of-unitedhealth-ceo/ WonkRoom] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524155647/http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/05/21/elizabeth-edwards-1-of-every-700-went-to-pay-salary-of-unitedhealth-ceo/ |date=May 24, 2009 }} page including an embedded clip from ''[[The Daily Show]]''</ref> Edwards stressed the importance of restoring competition in health insurance markets noting that at one point, "the President of UnitedHealth made so much money, that one of every $700 that was spent in this country on health care went to pay him." Since estimates of McGuire's 2005 compensation range from $59,625,444<ref>[http://www.aflcio.org/corporatewatch/paywatch/retirementsecurity/case_unitedhealth.cfm UnitedHealth Group Case Study, 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319040428/http://www.aflcio.org/corporatewatch/paywatch/retirementsecurity/case_unitedhealth.cfm | date=March 19, 2009}} AFL-CIO estimate of McGuire compensation</ref> to $124.8 million,<ref>[http://healthcare-economist.com/2006/02/14/united-health-ceo-earned-1248-million-in-2005/ United Health CEO earned $124.8 million in 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327050140/http://healthcare-economist.com/2006/02/14/united-health-ceo-earned-1248-million-in-2005/ | date=March 27, 2009}} ''Health Care Economist'', February 14, 2006</ref> and the revenue of UnitedHealth Group was then $71 billion, it is therefore possible that Mrs. Edwards may have meant that one of every $700 that was spent on UnitedHealth Group premiums went to pay McGuire.

===McGuire's settlement with SEC===

On December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire was to repay $468 million, including a $7 million civil penalty, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution. He was also barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years.<ref>[https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2007/lr20387.htm Securities and Exchange Commission v.

===Medicare overbilling lawsuit===
A whistleblower lawsuit, filed in 2011, charges UnitedHealth Group's data analytics division with assisting in defrauding [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] by boosting risk adjustment scores from [[Medicare Advantage]] companies. The suit alleges that UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Ingenix (now OptumInsight) "defrauded the United States of hundreds of millions â€” and likely billions â€” of dollars."
