==History==
[[Image:Duke Energy Center cropped.jpg|thumb|140px|left|[[Duke Energy Center]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], 2010]]
The company began in 1900 as the Catawba Power Company when Dr. Walker Gill Wylie and his brother financed the building of a hydroelectric power station at India Hook Shoals along the Catawba River near [[India Hook, South Carolina]]. In need of additional funding to further his ambitious plan for construction of a series of hydroelectric power plants, Wylie convinced [[James B. Duke and his partner James Blaney to invest in the Southern Power Company, founded in 1905.

In 1917 James Blaney was the founder of the Wateree Power Company that was formed as a holding company for several utilities that had been founded and/or owned by Duke, and Blaney his associates, and in 1924 the name was changed to Duke Power. In 1927, most of the subsidiary companies, including Southern Power Company, Catawba Power Company, Great Falls Power Company, and Western Carolina Power Company were merged into Duke Power, although Southern Public Utilities, 100% owned by Duke Power, maintained a legally separate existence for the retail marketing of Duke-generated power to residential and commercial customers.<ref>U.S. Federal Trade Commission (1935), Utility Corporations No. 766 Duke Power Co., pp. 9–14.</ref>

Before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Duke Power had an overt policy of openly discriminating on the basis of race in hiring and assigning employees at its [[Dan River Steam Station|Dan River plant]].<ref>''Griggs v. Duke Power Co.'',401 U.S. 424 (1971).</ref>  In the years following the passage of the Civil Rights Act, Duke Power continued to racially discriminate by implementing education requirements for work placement that did not directly relate to the work being done.  The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] found in ''[[Griggs v. Duke Power Co.]]'' that this policy violated the law and was discriminatory. 

A 1973 labor dispute between mine workers and Duke Power was the subject of the documentary ''[[Harlan County, USA]]''. The film documents the use of "gun thugs" to intimidate striking workers.

In 1988, Nantahala Power & Light Co., which served southwestern North Carolina, was purchased by Duke and is now operated under the Duke Power Nantahala Area brand. Duke Power merged with PanEnergy, a natural gas company, in 1997 to form Duke Energy.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Duke Power To Purchase Panenergy For $7.7 Billion | work = The Seattle Times | access-date = 2014-10-22 | date = 1996-11-25 | url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19961125&slug=2361712 }}</ref> The Duke Power name continued as the electric utility business of Duke Energy until the Cinergy merger.

[[File:Duke Energy Field Services (East Texas Plant).jpg|thumb|Duke Energy Field Services near [[Palestine, Texas]].  The facilities include refineries and oil wells throughout the region.]]

With the purchase of [[Cinergy|Cinergy Corporation]] announced in 2005 and completed on April 3, 2006, Duke Energy Corporation's customer base grew to include the [[Midwestern United States]] as well. The company operates [[nuclear power]] plants, coal-fired plants, conventional [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plants, natural-gas turbines to handle peak demand, and pumped hydro storage. During 2006, Duke Energy also acquired [[Chatham, Ontario]]-based [[Union Gas]], which is regulated under the Ontario Energy Board Act (1998).

On January 3, 2007, Duke Energy spun off its gas business to form [[Spectra Energy]]. Duke Energy shareholders received 1 share of Spectra Energy for each 2 shares of Duke Energy. After the spin-off, Duke Energy now receives the majority of its revenue from its electric operations in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. The spinoff to Spectra also included Union Gas, which Duke Energy acquired the previous year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.power-eng.com/2006/06/28/duke-energy-announces-plan-to-separate-gas-power-businesses/|title=Duke Energy announces plan to separate gas, power businesses|date=2006-06-28|website=Power Engineering|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/duke-energy-to-spin-off-natural-gas-operations/article711664/|title=Duke Energy to spin off natural gas operations|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>

In 2011, Duke Energy worked with Charlotte’s business leader community to help build Charlotte into a [[smart city]]. The group called the initiative "Envision Charlotte". At the time, the group decided on a goal to reduce energy use in the "urban core of the city by 20 percent". To do so, the group focused on making energy consumption changes to commercial buildings larger than 10,000 square feet.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/8243-duke-energy-teams-charlotte-nc-expand-reach-smart-energy-solutions-model/|title=Duke Energy teams up with Charlotte, NC to expand reach of smart energy solutions model|last=Carey|first=Liz|date=2017-10-03|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}</ref>

On July 3, 2012, Duke Energy merged with [[Progress Energy Inc]] with the Duke Energy name being retained along with the [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], headquarters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Duke Energy, Progress Energy to merge in $26B deal|url= http://www.wral.com/business/story/8907376/ |work=[[WRAL-TV]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Duke Energy and Progress Energy Have Merged|url=http://www.duke-energy.com/corporate-merger/|work=Duke Energy|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729063758/http://www.duke-energy.com/corporate-merger/|archive-date=2012-07-29}}</ref>

Duke announced on June 18, 2013, that CEO Jim Rogers was retiring and Lynn Good would become the new CEO. Rogers has been CEO and Chairman since 2006, while Good was Chief Financial Officer of Duke since 2009, having joined Duke in the 2006 Cinergy merger. Rogers' retirement was part of an agreement to end an investigation into Duke's Progress Energy acquisition in 2012.<ref name=NEXT>{{cite news|last=Polson|first=Jim|title=Duke Picks CFO Lynn Good to Be Next CEO, Replacing Rogers|url=http://washpost.bloomberg.com/Story?docId=1376-MOL89J6TTDVV01-4B1K5QT7J9CAKTUKOJH6OQKOEP|access-date=5 July 2013|newspaper=Washington Post/Bloomberg|date=June 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002541/http://washpost.bloomberg.com/Story?docId=1376-MOL89J6TTDVV01-4B1K5QT7J9CAKTUKOJH6OQKOEP|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===New nuclear power plant===
{{main|William States Lee III Nuclear Generating Station}}
On March 16, 2006, Duke Power announced that a [[Cherokee County, South Carolina]] site had been selected for a potential new [[nuclear power plant]]. The site is jointly owned by Duke Power and [[Southern Company]]. Duke plans to develop the site for two [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] [[AP1000]] (advanced passive) [[pressurized water reactor]]s. Each reactor is capable of producing approximately 1,117 megawatts. (See [[Nuclear Power 2010 Program]].)

On December 14, 2007, Duke Power submitted a [[Combined Construction and Operating License]] to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], with an announcement that it will spend $160 million in 2008 on the plant with a total cost of $5 billion to $6 billion.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSN1324347520071213 | title=UPDATE 1-Duke Energy files to build new nuclear power plant | first=Matt | last=Daily | date=December 13, 2007 | work=Reuters}}</ref> The plant was approved in 2016.<ref name=nrc-Lee>{{Cite news|url= https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/news/2016/16-075.pdf |title=NRC Issues New Reactor Licenses to Duke Energy for William States Lee III Site in South Carolina|date=December 21, 2016|work=NRC News|access-date=December 22, 2016|via=www.nrc.gov}}</ref>

In August 2017, Duke decided to seek permission from the North Carolina Utility Commission to cancel the project due to the bankruptcy of Westinghouse and "other market activity", although they will retain the option of restarting the project at some point in the future if circumstances change.<ref>{{cite web |title=Duke Seeks To Cancel William States Lee Nuclear Power Project |url=https://nuclearstreet.com/nuclear_power_industry_news/b/nuclear_power_news/archive/2017/08/25/duke-seeks-to-cancel-william-states-lee-nuclear-power-project-082502 |website=nuclearstreet.com |access-date=2018-06-27}}</ref>

This site would have been adjacent to the old site, which was never completed and abandoned in the early 1980s, and used by [[James Cameron]] as a film set for the 1989 movie ''[[The Abyss]]''.

In 2018, Duke Energy decided not to include new nuclear power in its long-range plans.<ref name=bizjournals-20180905>{{cite news |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2018/09/05/no-more-nukes-duke-energy-writes-new-nuclear-out.html |title=No more nukes: Duke Energy writes new nuclear out of its long-range plan |last=Downey |first=John |website=Charlotte Business Journal |date=5 September 2018 |access-date=8 September 2018}}</ref>

===Headquarters buildings===
[[J.A. Jones]] designed the first headquarters building, known as the Power Building, which was completed in 1928 at [[440 South Church]]. The Electric Center at 526 South Church Street opened in 1975 with an addition in 1988.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://illumination.duke-energy.com/articles/retro-power-buildings-over-the-years|title=Retro: Power buildings over the years|last=Flavors|first=Akeem|date=21 March 2019|access-date=16 January 2020}}</ref>

==Environmental record==
In 1999, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] commenced an enforcement action against Duke Energy for making modifications to very old and deteriorating coal-burning power plants without getting permits under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]. Duke asserted that a "modification" under the Clean Air Act did not require a permit. Environmental groups asserted that Duke was using loopholes in the law to increase emissions. Initially, Duke prevailed at the trial court level, but in 2006 the case was argued before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] (''[[Environmental Defense]] v. Duke Energy Corp.'' (05-848)). The Court unanimously ruled on April 2, 2007 that the modifications allowed the power plants to operate for more hours, increasing emissions, so Clean Air Act permits were needed.<ref>{{cite web

In early 2008, Duke Energy announced a plan to build the new, 800-megawatt Cliffside Unit 6 coal plant {{convert|55|mi|km}} west of Charlotte, North Carolina. The plan has been strongly opposed by environmental groups such as Rising Tide North America, [[Rainforest]] Action Network, the community-based Canary Coalition as well as the Southern Environmental Law Center, which has threatened to sue Duke if it does not halt construction plans. On April 1, activists locked themselves to machinery at the Cliffside construction area as part of [[Fossil Fools Day]].

In a joint venture with the French-based global energy firm AREVA, under the nominal name of ADAGE, Duke Energy has planned a "Green" biomass burning facility in Mason County, Washington and is negotiating with forestland owners to secure the 600,000 tons of wood debris it needs yearly to fuel its $250 million biomass plant.
The joint venture between electric power company Duke Energy and global nuclear services giant AREVA was created to build wood [[waste-to-energy]] power plants around the country.

ADAGE president Reed Wills announced the first Northwest outpost will be in the struggling timber town of Shelton, Washington.

Following a February 2, [[2014 Dan River coal ash spill|2014 coal ash spill]] which was the third-largest of its kind in US history, the US Attorney's Office opened a grand jury investigation into Duke Energy and North Carolina regulators in the administration of Governor Pat McCrory. McCrory had been an employee of Duke Energy for 28 years and critics have said his administration intervened on Duke's behalf to settle lawsuits over environmental violations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/apnewsbreak-us-investigates-nc-environment-agency|title=APNewsBreak: US investigates NC coal ash spill|access-date=2014-02-23|newspaper=Associated Press|date=2014-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218021421/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/apnewsbreak-us-investigates-nc-environment-agency|archive-date=18 February 2015}}</ref>  The US Attorney subpoenaed over 20 officials of the McCrory administration and sought records of "investments, cash or other items of value" from Duke to regulators.<ref>{{cite news|last=Biesecker|first=Michael|title=INVESTIGATION INTO NC COAL ASH SPILL WIDENS|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/prosecutors-file-new-subpoenas-over-nc-coal-ash|access-date=2014-02-23|newspaper=Associated Press|date=2014-02-14}}</ref>

Duke Energy owns the [[Crystal River Energy Complex]] in rural [[Citrus County, Florida]] which includes the now-closed [[Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant]] and four [[fossil-fuel power station]]s using coal. In late 2012, Duke paid $19 million of their 2012 property tax bill of $36 million, and filed suit against the county, claiming the assessment was too high. Duke Power owns 4,700 acres (1,900 hectares) of land and improvements assessed at over $2 billion, constituting more than a quarter of the county tax base.<ref name=TAX /> Citrus County Property Appraiser Geoff Greene commented, "Given the complexity, history and dispute over the last year's assessment of Duke Energy's property, an ''independent'' appraisal team was needed and tasked to arrive at a fair and just value."<ref name=OWES /> With the financial assistance from the Board of County Commissioners and the School Board,<ref name=OWES /> Greene hired two independent appraisal firms at a cost of $330,000.<ref name=TAX /> After five months of inspection, documentation and crunching numbers,<ref name=OWES /> the outside appraisal concluded that the county assessment was incorrect at $2.32 billion; it should have been $3.47 billion.
