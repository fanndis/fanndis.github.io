'''The Jackson 5''' (stylized as '''the''' '''Jackson''' '''5ive'''), later known as '''the Jacksons''', is an American [[pop band]] composed of members of the [[Jackson family]]. The group was founded in 1965 in Gary, Indiana, by brothers [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], and [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]], with younger brothers [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]] and [[Michael Jackson|Michael]] joining soon after.<ref name="GQ"/><ref name="Carlson">{{cite web|last1=Carlson|first1=Peter|last2=Wolmuth|first2=Roger|url=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-tour-de-force-vol-21-no-18/|title=Tour De Force|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=1984-05-07|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref> 

The Jackson 5 performed in talent shows and clubs on the [[Chitlin' Circuit]], then signed with Steeltown Records in 1967 and released two singles.<ref name="45rpmrecords.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.45rpmrecords.com/IN/Steeltown.php|title=Steeltown Records – Indiana Local Labels|website=45rpmrecords.com|access-date=28 June 2018}}</ref> In 1968, they left Steeltown Records and signed with [[Motown]], where they were the first group to debut with four consecutive number one hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with the songs "[[I Want You Back]]", "[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]]", "[[The Love You Save]]", and "[[I'll Be There (Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-jackson-5-mn0000083013/biography|title=The Jackson 5 {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref> They also achieved 16 top-40 singles on the ''chart''. The group left Motown for Epic Records in early 1976, with the exception of Jermaine, who was replaced by [[Randy Jackson (The Jacksons)|Randy]]. At Epic, they released four studio albums and one live album between 1976 and 1981, including the successful albums ''[[Destiny (The Jacksons album)|Destiny]]'' (1978) and ''[[Triumph (The Jacksons album)|Triumph]]'' (1980) and the singles "[[Enjoy Yourself (The Jacksons song)|Enjoy Yourself]]", "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]", and "[[Can You Feel It (The Jacksons song)|Can You Feel It]]". 

The brothers also released solo albums, most successfully Michael. In 1983, Jermaine reunited with the band to perform on the ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]'' TV special. They released the ''[[Victory (The Jacksons album)|Victory]]'' album the following year, followed by [[Victory Tour (The Jacksons tour)|an extensive tour]] which also featured songs from Michael's solo albums. After the ''Victory'' tour, Michael and Marlon Jackson left the group. The remaining four released the poorly received ''[[2300 Jackson Street]]'' album in 1989 before being dropped from their label. In 2001, the Jacksons reunited on Michael's [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration|30th Anniversary Celebration]] TV special. The four eldest of the brothers embarked on their [[Unity Tour]] in 2012 following Michael's death, and they planned several major performances for 2017.<ref>{{cite speech|title=Eulogy for Michael Jackson|author=Gordy, Berry|date=July 19, 2009|location=Los Angeles, California}}</ref><ref name="amg 5">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4568|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Jackson 5|last=Huey|first=Steve|publisher=Macrovision Corp.|access-date=2008-05-08}}</ref>

According to some sources, The Jackson 5 have sold more than 100 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/the-jacksons/|title=The Jacksons Hollywood Star Walk|last=Weiss|first=Jeff|date=June 18, 2010|access-date=March 1, 2018|work=LA Times}}</ref> In 1980 the brothers were honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] as the Jacksons. They were inducted to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997. Two of the band's recordings ("ABC" and "I Want You Back") are among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll|500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]] and, alongside "I'll Be There", were also inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].

==History==
===Early years===
[[File:Jackson 5 1969.jpg|thumb|224x224px|The Jackson 5 in 1969|alt=]]
The five Jackson brothers' interest in music was bolstered by their father [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joe Jackson]]. In 1964, Joe found Tito playing with his guitar after a string broke, and he was impressed enough to buy him his own guitar. Tito, Jermaine, and Jackie later formed their own group, with Michael (age 5) playing congas and childhood friends Reynaud Jones and Milford Hite playing keyboards and drums in 1965. Marlon joined on tambourine in August 1965, when Evelyn LaHaie suggested that the group name themselves the Jackson Five Singing Group.<ref name="GQ"/>

In 1966, the group won their first talent show at [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (Gary)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]] in Gary. Jermaine performed [[the Temptations]]' "[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]", and Michael performed [[Robert Parker (singer)|Robert Parker]]'s "[[Barefootin' (song)|Barefootin']]".<ref name="All">{{cite web|author=Steve Huey|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-jackson-5-mn0000083013|title=The Jackson 5|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> [[Johnny Jackson (musician)|Johnny Jackson]] and [[Ronnie Rancifer]] eventually replaced Hite and Jones. During their early performing years, the Jackson 5 would perform at other talent showcases at several other Gary schools and halls and theaters in Gary and the Chicago area. In August 1967, the boys were eventually booked into venues such as Chicago's [[Regal Theater (Chicago)|Regal Theater]] and Harlem's [[Apollo Theater]], winning the talent competitions on both shows that year, winning the Apollo competition on August 13. Afterwards, it's claimed [[Gladys Knight]] sent a tape of the boys' demo to Motown Records, hoping to get them to sign, but their tape was rejected and sent back{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}. In July 1967, the group recorded an early version of a song that would later be their first single, "[[Big Boy (song)|Big Boy]]", for [[One-derful Records]], however, the group was also rejected by that label.

In November 1967, Joe Jackson signed the group into [[Steeltown Records]], a label founded and owned by record producer [[Gordon Keith (producer)|Gordon Keith]]. With Keith at the helm, they recorded "Big Boy" again that same month, the song would later be released as a single in January 1968.<ref name="45rpmrecords.com"/> By March, Keith had managed to sign the Jackson 5 into a distribution deal with [[Atlantic Records]], where "Big Boy" and another single, "We Don't Have to Be Over 21 (To Fall in Love)", were distributed. "Big Boy" eventually moved 10,000 copies.<ref name = "tara 36-37">Taraborrelli, p. 36–37</ref> By March, Keith booked the boys to perform for their first paying gig at the Apollo Theater where they opened for [[Etta James]]<ref name = "tara 41-42">Taraborrelli, p. 41-42</ref>. That month, Keith had "Big Boy" distributed through [[Atlantic Records]] and was working out on a record contract for the boys on that label when he learned that Joe Jackson had tried to get in touch with Motown through his attorney Richard Arons.<ref name = "tara 44-46">Taraborrelli, p. 44-46</ref>

During July 1968, the boys opened for [[Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bobby-taylor-motown-singer-who-discovered-jackson-5-dead-at-83-202100/|title=Bobby Taylor, Motown Singer Who Discovered Jackson 5, Dead at 83|last1=Knopper|first1=Steve|last2=Knopper|first2=Steve|date=2017-07-23|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-05}}</ref> at the Regal Theater. After being blown away by Michael's performance, Taylor sent the boys to Detroit where he set up a recorded Motown audition, which took place at Motown's official headquarters on Detroit's Woodward Avenue on July 23, 1968. Gordy, who had initially rejected their tape, refusing to sign any more "kid acts" after Stevie Wonder, changed his mind once he viewed Taylor's tape. On July 26, Gordy returned to Detroit where he had Joe Jackson and the boys sign their first year-long Motown contract.<ref name="tara 48-51">Taraborrelli, p. 48-51</ref> However, recording on their first album was delayed due to a contract dispute with Keith. While negotiations were continuing to get the Jacksons out of Steeltown, the group performed at strip clubs such as Guys + Dolls to make extra income, as well as honky tonks.

Finally on March 11, 1969, a day before Marlon's 12th birthday, the Jackson Five signed an exclusive seven-year contract with the label.<ref name="tara 48-51"/> After initial recordings at Detroit's [[Hitsville U.S.A.]] failed to impress Gordy, he sent the Jacksons to Hollywood. In August, Motown's PR machine, led by [[Suzanne de Passe]], started to pass off the group as having been discovered by [[The Supremes|Supremes]] lead singer [[Diana Ross]]. When the group opened for record industry insiders at the Los Angeles club, the Daisy, Michael was billed as an "eight-year-old sensation", though he was several days shy of his 11th birthday. Shortly after the Daisy performance, the Jackson Five performed a cover of "[[It's Your Thing]]" at the Miss Black America Pageant in New York.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Michael Jackson, rewind : the life & legacy of pop music's king|last=Easlea, Daryl|page=178|isbn=978-1631063671|location=New York|oclc=960711448|date = 2016-10-07}}</ref> By September, Gordy had set up the new songwriting and producing team, [[The Corporation (record production team)|The Corporation]], to write exclusively for the Jackson Five. After recording "[[I Want You Back]]" that same month, the single was released in early October and the Jacksons promoted the song on such programs such as the ''[[Hollywood Palace]]'' and the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Their debut album, ''[[Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5]]'', was released in December 1969.

===Jacksonmania===
[[File:Jackson 5 copy.jpg|thumb|223x223px|The Jackson 5 with [[Hal Davis]]|alt=]]
"I Want You Back" topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in January 1970. The Jackson 5 released two more number-one singles led by the Corporation: "[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]]" and "[[The Love You Save]]". The single "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]" was co-written and produced by [[Hal Davis]] and became the band's fourth number-one single, making them the first recording act to have their first four singles reach the top of the Hot 100, and all four were almost as popular in other countries as they were in the United States. The group released a succession of four albums in one year and replaced the Supremes as Motown's best-selling group. They continued their success with singles such as "[[Mama's Pearl]]", "[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]", and "[[Sugar Daddy (The Jackson 5 song)|Sugar Daddy]]", giving them a total of seven top-ten singles within a two-year period.

The Jackson Five became Motown's main marketing focus and the label capitalized on the group's youth appeal, licensing dozens of products, including the J5 heart logo on Johnny Jackson's drum set, the group's album covers, stickers, posters, and coloring books, as well as a board game and a [[The Jackson 5ive (TV series)|Saturday morning cartoon]] produced by [[Rankin/Bass]]. The black publication ''[[Right On!]]'' began in 1971 and focused heavily on the Jackson 5, with members adorning covers between January 1972 and April 1974. In addition, the group appeared in several television specials including Diana Ross' 1971 special, ''[[Diana!]]''. They starred on their first of two Motown-oriented television specials ''[[Goin' Back to Indiana]]'' in September; their second was ''The Jackson 5 Show'' which debuted in November of the following year. The group often joined [[Bob Hope]] on USO-benefited performances to support military troops during the Vietnam War.

In order to continue increasing sales, Motown launched Michael Jackson's solo career in 1971 with the single "[[Got to Be There (song)|Got to Be There]]", released in November. His 1972 song "[[Ben (song)|Ben]]" became his first to top the charts. Jermaine was the second to release a solo project; his most successful hit of the period was a cover of the doo-wop song "Daddy's Home".

===Decline===
The Jackson 5's records began plummeting on the charts by 1972, despite Michael and Jermaine's solo successes. The Corporation had produced most of their hit singles, but they split up in 1973. The brothers focused on the emerging disco craze and recorded the song "[[Get It Together (The Jackson 5 song)|Get It Together]]", followed by their hit "[[Dancing Machine]]", their first to crack the top ten since "Sugar Daddy" nearly three years before. Despite those successes, most of the Jackson 5's follow-ups were not as successful, and Joe Jackson grew tired of Motown's uneasiness to continue producing hits for the brothers by 1973. He began producing a nightclub act around [[Jackson family|his sons and daughters]], starting in Las Vegas and expanding to other states.

By 1975, most of the Jacksons opted out of recording any more music for Motown, desiring creative control and royalties after learning that they were earning only 2.8% of royalties from Motown. The Jacksons announced their conclusion to depart from Motown at a press conference at the [[Rainbow Room|Rainbow Grill]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].<ref name="Yorker"/> Joe Jackson then began negotiating to have the group sign a lucrative contract with another company, settling for [[Epic Records]], which had offered a royalty rate of 20% per record; he signed with the company in June 1975.<ref name="Yorker">{{cite web|last1=W.S. Trow|first1=George|last2=Kincaid|first2=Jamaica|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1975/07/14/leaving-motown/amp|title=Leaving Motown|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=1975-07-06|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref> Absent from the deal was Jermaine Jackson, who decided to stay with Motown following his marriage to Hazel Gordy, and [[Randy Jackson (The Jacksons)|Randy Jackson]] replaced him. Even though the group announced their departure from the label, they still remained under contract to Motown until March 1976.<ref name="Yorker"/> Motown sued them for breach of contract but allowed the group to record for Epic, as long as they changed their name because Motown owned the name Jackson 5. The brothers thus renamed themselves the Jacksons.

===The Jacksons CBS/Epic Records===
In November 1976, following the debut of the family's [[The Jacksons (TV series)|weekly variety series]], the Jacksons released their [[The Jacksons (album)|self-titled CBS debut]] under the [[Philadelphia International Records|Philadelphia International]] subsidiary, produced by [[Gamble & Huff]]. Featuring "[[Enjoy Yourself (The Jacksons song)|Enjoy Yourself]]" and "[[Show You the Way to Go]]", the album went gold but failed to generate the sales the brothers had enjoyed while at Motown. A follow-up, ''[[Goin' Places (The Jacksons album)|Goin' Places]]'', fizzled. Renewing their contract with Epic, the Jacksons were allowed full creative control on their next recording, ''[[Destiny (The Jacksons album)|Destiny]]'', released in December 1978. Featuring their best-selling Epic single to date, "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]", written by Michael and Randy, the album sold over a million copies. Its follow-up, 1980's ''[[Triumph (The Jacksons album)|Triumph]]'', also sold a million copies, spawning hits such as "[[Lovely One]]" and "[[Can You Feel It (The Jacksons song)|Can You Feel It]]". In 1981, they released their fifth album, a [[The Jacksons Live!|live album]] that eventually sold half a million copies. The live album was culled from recordings of performances on their [[Triumph Tour]]. [[File:MichaelJacksonSnoopyKBFApr1984cropped.jpg|alt=|thumb|242x242px|[[Michael Jackson|Michael]] (pictured in 1984) became a global superstar following his departure from The Jackson 5.]]

In between the releases of ''Destiny'' and ''Triumph'', Michael released the best-selling solo effort, ''[[Off the Wall (Michael Jackson album)|Off the Wall]]''. Its success led to rumors of Michael's alleged split from his brothers. After ''Triumph'', Michael worked on his second Epic solo release, which was released in November 1982 as ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'', which later went on to become the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling album of all time]], winning eight Grammy Awards including Album of the Year, plus producing two number one hit singles, "Billie Jean" and "Beat It", and three breakthrough MTV music videos, "Billie Jean", "Beat It", and the 14-minute zombie-themed music video "Thriller". In March 1983, with Jermaine, the Jacksons performed on ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]'', the same show where Michael debuted the [[moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]] during a solo performance of "[[Billie Jean]]". Following the success of the reunion, all six brothers agreed to record a sixth album for Epic, later released as ''[[Victory (The Jacksons album)|Victory]]'' in 1984. Their biggest-selling album to date, it included their final top ten single, "[[State of Shock (song)|State of Shock]]". The song was actually a duet between Michael and [[Mick Jagger]] and did not feature participation from any other Jackson besides Marlon and Jackie, who were credited as background vocalists. Most of the album was produced in this way, with each brother essentially recording solo songs. Another hit was the top 20 single "[[Torture (The Jacksons song)|Torture]]", a duet between Michael and Jermaine, with Jackie singing several parts. In the same year, the brothers participated in filming a Pepsi commercial where Michael suffered burns to his scalp due to a pyrotechnic fault. In July 1984, the Jacksons launched their [[Victory Tour (The Jacksons tour)|Victory Tour]], which was overshadowed by Jackie's leg injury, ticket issues, friction between the brothers, and a shakeup in the promotion and marketing team, initially headed by [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]], who was later fired. Michael announced he was leaving the group after their final performance at [[Dodger Stadium]] that December to continue his solo career. The following January, Marlon Jackson also announced he was leaving the group to pursue a [[Solo (music)|solo]] career.

In 1987, The Jacksons released the single "Time Out for the Burglar", which was included on the soundtrack of the [[Whoopi Goldberg]] comedy film ''[[Burglar (film)|Burglar]]''. In 1989, the remaining quartet of Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Randy released ''[[2300 Jackson Street]]'', which performed poorly on the charts by the band's standards. After a brief promotional tour, the group went into hiatus and never recorded another album together.

}}In September 2001, nearly 17 years after their last performance together, all six Jackson brothers reunited for two performances at [[Madison Square Garden]] for a [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration|30th anniversary special commemorating Michael's solo career]], which aired in November. In early 2009, the four elder brothers began filming a [[reality television|reality show]] to make their attempt on reuniting the band, later debuting in December 2009 as ''[[The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty]]''.<ref name="nytimes20091211">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/12/arts/television/12jackson.html?_r=1 |title=No Longer One for All, but Still All From One |author=Mike Hale |work=[[The New York Times]]  |date=2009-12-11 |access-date=2010-03-06}}</ref> During the middle of the project, Michael had announced his [[This Is It (Michael Jackson concerts)|concert comeback in London]] was scheduled on July 13, 2009. [[Death of Michael Jackson|Michael died]] that same year on June 25, putting efforts on halt.

Later in 2009, following the death of brother Michael, the surviving Jacksons recorded background vocals for a previously unreleased song, "[[This Is It (Michael Jackson song)|This Is It]]" (the theme for the [[Michael Jackson's This Is It|movie of the same name]]), which had originally been a demo.<ref name="rssongreview">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/10/12/new-michael-jackson-song-this-is-it-premieres-online/|title=New Michael Jackson song, 'This Is It', premieres online |work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stones]]|date=October 12, 2009 |access-date=March 6, 2010}}</ref> The radio-only single was released in October of that same year.

The surviving members of the Jacksons were in talks of planning a reunion concert tour (which was to serve as a tribute to Michael) for 2010, and were in talks in working on their first new studio album in over 20 years.<ref name="nytimes20091211" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/zwecker/2066353,CST-FTR-zp24.article |title=J-Lo spins record discord |author=Bill Zwecker |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=Sun-Times Media, LLC |date=2010-02-24 |access-date=2010-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228173435/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/zwecker/2066353,CST-FTR-zp24.article |archive-date=2010-02-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, neither plan was put into action.

===The Jacksons: Unity Tour===
In September 2010, Jermaine Jackson held his own "tribute" concert to Michael in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. In 2011, Jackie Jackson released a solo single to [[iTunes]], while Jermaine released his first solo album in 21 years, ''I Wish U Love''. Following the release of one solo album, Marlon quit the music business in 1989 and invested in real estate. Randy has not been active in the industry since he disbanded the group Randy & the Gypsys in 1991.

In August 2011, there appeared to be a discord between the brothers concerning a tribute concert dedicated to Michael. While Jackie, Tito and Marlon were present alongside mother [[Katherine Jackson|Katherine]] and sister [[La Toya Jackson|La Toya]] for a tribute concert in [[Cardiff]] at the [[Millennium Stadium]] for a press conference concerning the tour, a couple of days after the press conference, both Randy and Jermaine issued a statement denouncing the tribute tour as the date of it occurred around the time of Conrad Murray's [[manslaughter]] trial in relation to Michael's death. The show carried on with Jackie, Tito and Marlon performing without Jermaine. In April 2012, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon announced that they would reunite for several United States concerts for their [[Unity Tour]]. Thirty-eight dates were announced, however, eleven shows in the U.S. were canceled. The tour started at [[Casino Rama]] in Orillia, Ontario, Canada on June 20, 2012.<ref>{{cite web | first = Jane | last = Stevenson | access-date = 2012-07-02 | date = 2012-06-21 | title = Casino Rama, Rama Ont.

In 1992, Suzanne de Passe, Jermaine Jackson, and Jermaine's then common-law wife Margaret Maldonado, worked with Motown to produce ''[[The Jacksons: An American Dream]]'', a five-hour television [[miniseries]] broadcast based on the history of the Jackson family in a two-part special on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

Influenced by [[the Temptations]], [[the Supremes]], [[James Brown]], [[The Teenagers]] and [[Sly & the Family Stone]], the group eventually served as the inspiration for several generations of [[boy band]]s, including [[New Edition]], [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], [[New Kids on the Block]], [[NSYNC]], the [[Jonas Brothers]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[One Direction]], and many more.

The rise of the Jackson 5 in the 1960s and 1970s coincided with the rise of a very similar musical family, [[the Osmonds]]. The Osmonds had risen to fame as regular performers on ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''; [[Jay Osmond]] would later note: "Michael had a unique sense of humor about him, and told us he was so tired of watching the Osmonds on ''The Andy Williams Show''. He explained this was something their father had them do, and Michael joked he became really tired of it!"<ref name="jay-osmond">{{cite web|url=http://www.jayosmond.com/news.html |title=Jay Osmond Official Website |publisher=Jayosmond.com |access-date=2010-06-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124023137/http://jayosmond.com/news.html |archive-date=2010-11-24 }}</ref> The song "[[One Bad Apple]]", written by [[George Jackson (songwriter)|George Jackson]], who had the Jackson Five in mind when he wrote it, was originally presented to Motown Record's Chairman of the Board [[Berry Gordy]] for the group to record, but he turned it down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=9173|title=One Bad Apple by The Osmonds|website=Songfacts.com|access-date=28 June 2018}}</ref> It was then presented to [[MGM Records]] for the Osmonds. "One Bad Apple", which the Osmonds recorded in a similar style to the songs of the Jackson 5 at the time, reached number one and began a string of several hits for the Osmonds.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-osmonds |title= The Osmonds - Hot 100 History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= March 1, 2018 |website= Billboard.com |publisher= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date= March 1, 2018 }}</ref> Both bands followed a similar career trajectory: a string of several hits as a group, which eventually led to a breakout star (Michael for the Jacksons, [[Donny Osmond|Donny]] for the Osmonds) becoming a solo artist, a little sister not originally part of the group also rising to fame ([[Janet Jackson]] and [[Marie Osmond]] respectively), and eventual decline as a smaller group in the 1980s. The two groups' members eventually became friends, despite public perception of a rivalry between the two and allegations that the Osmonds, white [[Mormon]] brothers from Utah, were an imitation of the black Jackson 5.
