During his time in office, Lula introduced sweeping social programs including [[Bolsa Família]] and [[Fome Zero]], aimed at combating poverty and lifting the station of the country's working class.

Succeeded by his former [[Chief of Staff of Brazil|Chief of Staff]], [[Dilma Rousseff]], Lula left an enduring mark on Brazilian politics in the form of [[Lulism]].

== Early life ==
Luiz Inácio da Silva was born on 27 October 1945 (registered with a date of birth of 6 October 1945) in [[Caetés, Pernambuco|Caetés]] (then a district of [[Garanhuns]]), located 250&nbsp;km (150 miles) from [[Recife]], capital of [[Pernambuco]], a state in the [[Northeast of Brazil]]. He was the seventh of eight children of Aristides Inácio da Silva and Eurídice Ferreira de Melo. Two weeks after Lula's birth, his father moved to [[Santos, São Paulo]], with Valdomira Ferreira de Góis, a cousin of Eurídice. He was raised [[Roman Catholic]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Feltrin, Ricardo|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u82505.shtml |title="Lula é um católico a seu modo", diz d. Cláudio Hummes |work=Folha de S.Paulo |date=6 April 2005  |accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref> Lula's mother was of partial [[Italians|Italian]] descent.<ref>{{cite book|last = Paraná|first = Denise|title = Lula, o filho do Brasil|year = 2009|publisher = Objetiva|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WsROAQAAIAAJ|accessdate = 25 October 2018|page = ???|isbn = 9788539000371}}</ref>

In December 1952, when Lula was only 7 years old, his mother decided to move to [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] with her children to rejoin her husband. After a journey of thirteen days in a ''pau-de-arara'' (open [[Pickup truck#Pickup bed styles|truck bed]]), they arrived in [[Guarujá]] and discovered that Aristides had formed a second family with Valdomira. Aristides' two families lived in the same house for some time, but they did not get along very well, and four years later, Eurídice moved with her children to a small room behind a bar in [[São Paulo]]. After that Lula rarely saw his father, who became an alcoholic and died in 1978.<ref>Bourne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7TlK53NMGawC&pg=PT50 Lula of Brazil]</ref>

Lula was married twice. In 1969, he married Maria de Lourdes, who died of hepatitis in 1971, while pregnant with their first son, who also died.<ref name="Hoje em dia">{{cite news|author=Narciso, Paulo |url=http://www.hojeemdia.com.br/cmlink/hoje-em-dia/noticias/politica/da-distante-pauliceia-lula-vinha-namorar-todas-as-noites-1.38045 |title=Da distante Paulicéia, Lula vinha namorar todas as noites |work=Hoje em Dia |accessdate=14 December 2009|language=pt|archive-date=21 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021142022/http://www.hojeemdia.com.br/cmlink/hoje-em-dia/noticias/politica/da-distante-pauliceia-lula-vinha-namorar-todas-as-noites-1.38045 }}</ref> Lula and Miriam Cordeiro had a daughter, Lurian, born out of wedlock in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|author=Fordeleone, Yolanda|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/nacional,lurian-filha-de-lula-foi-atendida-no-hospital-sirio-libanes,201085,0.htm |title=Lurian, filha de Lula, foi atendida no hospital Sírio-Libanês |work=[[O Estado de S.

== Education and work ==
Lula had little formal education. He did not learn to read until he was ten years old,<ref name=Fourth-time>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2367851.stm |title=Lula: Fourth time lucky? |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 October 2002 |accessdate=27 April 2007}}</ref> and quit school after the second grade to work and help his family. His first job at age 12 was as [[shoeshiner]] and street vendor.

He lost the little finger on his left hand at 19 in an accident, while working as a press operator in an automobile parts factory.<ref name=Fourth-time/> After the accident he had to run to several hospitals before he received medical attention. This experience increased his interest in participating in the Workers' Union. Around that time, he became involved in [[Trade union|union]] activities and held several important union posts.<ref name=Biography/><ref name=LULAC1>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Luiz-Inacio-Lula-da-Silva| title=Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva |publisher=Encyclopdia Britannica|access-date=27 October 2019}}</ref>

== Union career ==
Inspired by his brother Frei Chico, Lula joined the [[labour movement]] when he worked at [[Villares Metals S.A]], rising steadily through the ranks. He was elected in 1975, and reelected in 1978, as president of the Steel Workers' Union of [[São Bernardo do Campo]] and [[Diadema, Brazil|Diadema]]. Both cities are located in the [[ABCD Region]], home to most of Brazil's automobile manufacturing facilities, including [[Ford do Brasil|Ford]], [[Volkswagen do Brasil|Volkswagen]], [[Toyota]], [[Mercedes-Benz]] and others, and are among the most industrialized in the country. In the late 1970s, when Brazil was under military rule, Lula helped organize union activities, including major strikes. [[Labour court]]s found the strikes illegal, and Lula was jailed for a month. Due to this, and like other people imprisoned for political activities under the military government, Lula was awarded a lifetime pension after the fall of the military régime.<ref name=LULAP1>{{cite book|author=Richard Bourne |title=Lula of Brazil: The Story So Far |isbn= 978-0520261556 | publisher=University of California Press |date=19 October 2009}}</ref>

== Political career ==
[[File:Dep. lula.jpg|thumb|upright|Lula speaking at the plenary of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]]{{when|date=July 2017}}]]
On 10 February 1980, a group of academics, intellectuals, and union leaders, including Lula, founded the ''[[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Partido dos Trabalhadores]]'' (PT) or Workers' Party, a left-wing party with [[Progressivism|progressive]] ideas created in the midst of Brazil's military government.

In 1982, he added the nickname Lula to his legal name.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/TOP/reference/timestopics/people/d/luiz_inacio_lula_da_silva/ |title= Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|date=26 August 2012|work=The New York Times|first=Alexei|last=Barrionuevo}}</ref> In 1983 he helped found the [[Central Única dos Trabalhadores]] (CUT) union association. In 1984, PT and Lula joined the popular ''[[Diretas Já]]!'' (''Direct [Elections] Now!'') campaign, demanding a direct popular vote for the next Brazilian presidential election. According to the 1967 constitution, Presidents were at that time elected by both Houses of Congress in joint session, with representatives of all State Legislatures; this was widely recognised as a mere sham as, since the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|March 1964 coup d'état]], each "elected" President had been a retired general chosen in a closed military caucus. Lula and the PT supported the public demand for a change in the electoral system. But the campaign was defeated by a vote in Congress that rejected an amendment calling direct elections for the following year, and, in 1985, a civilian president, [[Tancredo Neves]], was elected by the same indirect procedure, with Lula's support. Only four years later, as a direct result of ''Diretas Já!'' and after years of popular struggle, the 1989 elections were the first in 29&nbsp;years to elect a president by direct popular vote.

=== Elections ===
[[File:LulaSerra.jpg|thumb|Lula and mayor of [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]] [[José Serra]], whom he defeated in the [[2002 Brazilian general election|2002 presidential elections]]]]
Lula first ran for office in 1982, for the state government of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], and lost. In the 1986 elections Lula won a seat in [[National Congress of Brazil|Congress]] with the most votes nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Eleicoes/0,,AA1330800-6282,00.html |title=Eleições 2006 – Com votação recorde, Lula chega ao segundo mandato|work=[[G1 (website)|G1]] |publisher=[[Grupo Globo]] |accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref> The Workers' Party helped write the country's [[Constitution of Brazil|post-military government Constitution]], ensuring strong constitutional guarantees for workers' rights, but failed to achieve a proposed push for [[agrarian reform]] in the Constitutional text. Under Lula's leadership, the PT took a stance against the Constitution in the [[1988 Constituent Assembly]], reluctantly agreeing to sign the agreed draft at a later stage.

In 1989, still as a Congressman, Lula ran as the PT candidate in the first democratic elections for president since 1960. Lula and [[Leonel Brizola]], two popular left-wing candidates, were expected to vie for first place. Lula was viewed as the more left-leaning of the two, advocating immediate land reform and a [[default (finance)|default]] on the [[external debt]]. However, a minor candidate, [[Fernando Collor de Mello]], former governor of [[Alagoas]], quickly amassed support among the nation's élite with a more business-friendly agenda. Collor became popular taking emphatic anti-corruption positions; he eventually beat Lula in the second round of the [[1989 Brazilian presidential election|1989 elections]]. In 1992, Collor resigned, under threat of [[impeachment]] for his alleged [[embezzlement]] of public money.

Lula refused to run for re-election as a Congressman in 1990, busying himself with expanding the Workers' Party organizations around the country. As the political scene in the 1990s came under the sway of the [[Brazilian real]] monetary stabilization plan, which ended decades of rampant inflation, former Minister of Finance [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] ([[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB)) [[1994 Brazilian general election|defeated Lula in 1994]] and again, by an even wider margin, [[1998 Brazilian general election|in 1998]].

A 2010 article in the [[Washington Post]] said that, before winning the presidency, Lula had been a "strident [[union organizer]] known for his bushy beard and [[Che Guevara]] T-shirts".<ref name="WPost">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/03/AR2010100304612_pf.html|title=Brazilian president's handpicked successor leads, faces runoff|first=Juan|last=Forero|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=4 October 2010}}</ref> In the 2002 campaign, Lula foreswore both his informal clothing style and his platform plank of linking the payment of Brazil's foreign debt to a prior thorough audit. This last point had worried economists, businessmen and banks, who feared that even a partial Brazilian default along with the existing Argentine default would have a massive ripple effect through the world economy. Embracing [[political consultant]] [[Duda Mendonça]]'s advice to pursue a more media-friendly image, Lula led the field in the first round of the [[2002 Brazilian general election|2002 election]], held on 6 October, with a nearly two-to-one margin over PSDB candidate [[José Serra]]. He then defeated Serra in the runoff with 61.3 percent of the vote.

At the [[2006 Brazilian general election|1 October 2006 general elections]], Lula came within a few thousand votes of being reelected in a single round (to date, Cardoso is the only person to win a first-round victory since the return of direct elections in 1989). He faced a [[Two-round system|run-off]] on 29 October and won by a substantial margin over the PSDB's [[Geraldo Alckmin]], albeit with a slightly smaller share of the vote than he'd won in the 2002 runoff (60.83 percent vs 61.3 percent).<ref name=2006-election>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6095820.stm |title=Brazil re-elects President Lula |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2007}}</ref> In an interview published 26 August 2007, he said that he had no intention to seek a constitutional change so that he could run for a third consecutive term; he also said that he wanted "to reach the end of [his] term in a strong position in order to influence the succession."<ref>{{cite news |author=Newsroom |title=Brazilian President Vows Not to Seek a Third Term |url=http://www.brazzilmag.com/component/content/article/51/8599-brazilian-president-vows-not-to-seek-a-third-term.html |work=Mercopress via Brazzil Magazine |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=22 June 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071225191620/http://www.brazzilmag.com/content/view/8599/54/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 25 December 2007}}</ref>

In early September 2018, Brazil's top electoral court banned former president Lula da Silva from running for president on the [[2018 Brazilian general election|2018 general election]] due to his corruption conviction, in accordance with [[Lei da Ficha Limpa]]. Instead, [[Fernando Haddad]] ran for president on the Workers Party ticket, and was defeated by [[Jair Bolsonaro]], after securing nearly 45 percent of the popular vote in a run-off between the candidates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-idUSKCN1LR08N|title=Brazil's jailed former leader Lula ends presidential bid|date=11 September 2018|via=reuters.com}}</ref>

== Presidency ==
[[File:Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.jpg|thumb|Lula's first term official portrait]]
Lula served two terms as president from 2003 through 2010 and left office on 1 January 2011. During his farewell speech he said he felt an additional burden to prove that he could handle the presidency despite his humble beginnings. "If I failed, it would be the workers' class which would be failing; it would be this country's poor who would be proving they did not have what it takes to rule."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2010/12/2010123054815679161.html |title= Lula bids a tearful goodbye |date= 30 December 2010|work= Al Jazeera English|accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref>

=== Political orientation ===
[[File:Lula's presidential inauguration, 2007.jpg|thumb|Lula climbs the ramp leading to the [[Palácio do Planalto]] with [[Vice President of Brazil|Vice President]] [[José Alencar]] for the [[Brazilian presidential inauguration|official ceremony]] marking the beginning of their second term in 2007]]
Since the beginning of his political career to the present, Lula has changed some of his original ideas and moderated his positions. Instead of the drastic social changes he proposed in the past, his government chose a reformist line, passing new retirement, tax, labour and judicial legislation, and discussing university reform.

Very few of the proposed reforms were actually implemented during Lula's terms of office. Some wings of the [[Worker's Party (Brazil)|Worker's Party]] disagreed with the increasing moderation in focus since the late eighties and have since left the party to form dissident wings such as the [[Workers' Cause Party]], the [[United Socialist Workers' Party]] and during Lula's presidency the [[Socialism and Liberty Party]]. Alliances with old, traditional oligarch politicians, like former presidents [[José Sarney]] and [[Fernando Collor]], have been a cause of disappointment for some.<ref>{{cite news|title=Where dinausaurs still roam |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13062220|work=The Economist|date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=12 May 2009|url-access=limited }}</ref>

=== Social projects ===
[[File:Lulaspeech.jpg|thumb|Lula gives a speech in [[Diadema, São Paulo|Diadema]] in a public event launching further social assistance in the form of [[subsidized housing]] and [[Bolsa Família]] credits]]
Lula put social programs at the top of his agenda during the campaigns and after election. From very early on his leading program was to eradicate hunger, following the lead of projects already put into practice by the Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration, but expanded by the new ''[[Fome Zero]]'' ("Zero Hunger") program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coha.org/2006/06/21/lula-brazils-lost-leader/ |title= Lula – Brazil's Lost Leader |accessdate=5 April 2008 |last=Kirksey |first=Emily |date=21 June 2006 |work=[[Council on Hemispheric Affairs]] }}</ref> This program brings together a series of programs with the goal to end hunger in Brazil, including the construction of water [[cisterns]] in Brazil's semi-arid region of [[Sertão]], plus actions to counter teenage pregnancy, to strengthen [[Family farm|family agriculture]], to distribute a minimum amount of cash to the poor, and many other measures.

The largest assistance program, however, was ''[[Bolsa Família]]'' (Family Allowance), which was based upon the previous ''[[Education policy in Brazil#Bolsa Escola|Bolsa Escola]]'' (School Allowance), which was conditional on school attendance, first introduced in the city of [[Campinas]] by then-mayor [[José Roberto Magalhães Teixeira]]. Not long thereafter, other municipalities and states adopted similar programs. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso later federalized the program in 2001. In 2003, Lula formed ''Bolsa Família'' by combining ''Bolsa Escola'' with additional allowances for food and kitchen gas. This was preceded by the creation of a new ministry – the Ministry of Social Development and Eradication of Hunger. This merger reduced administrative costs and bureaucratic complexity for both the families involved and the administration of the program.

''Fome Zero'' has a government budget and accepts donations from the private sector and international organizations. The ''Bolsa Família'' program has been praised internationally for its achievements, despite internal criticism accusing it of having turned into an electoral weapon.

Along with projects such as ''Fome Zero'' and ''Bolsa Família'', another Lula administration flagship program was the [[Growth Acceleration Program]] (PAC). The PAC had a total budget of $646&nbsp;billion reais (US$353&nbsp;billion) by 2010, and was the Lula administration's main investment program. It was intended to strengthen Brazil's infrastructure, and consequently to stimulate the private sector and create more jobs. The social and urban infrastructure sector was scheduled to receive $84.2&nbsp;billion reais (US$46&nbsp;billion).

As Lula gained strength in the run-up to the 2002 elections, the fear of drastic measures, and comparisons with [[Hugo Chávez]] of [[Venezuela]], increased internal market speculation. This led to some market hysteria, contributing to a drop in the value of the [[Brazilian real|real]], and a downgrade of Brazil's credit rating.<ref name=Downgrade>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2057137.stm |title=Brazil hit by debt downgrade  |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=21 June 2002 |accessdate=9 August 2007}}</ref>

In the beginning of his first term, Lula's chosen Minister of Finance was [[Antonio Palocci]], a physician and former [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] activist who had recanted his far left views while serving as the mayor of the sugarcane processing industry center of [[Ribeirão Preto]], in the state of São Paulo. Lula also chose [[Henrique Meirelles]] of the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]], a prominent market-oriented economist, as head of the [[Brazilian Central Bank]]. As a former CEO of the [[BankBoston]] he was well known to the market.<ref name=MeirBio>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcb.gov.br/pre/quemequem/ingl/presidentes/henriqueMeirelles.asp |title=Henrique de Campos Meirelles |publisher=Banco Central do Brazil |accessdate=9 August 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927074612/http://www.bcb.gov.br/pre/quemequem/ingl/presidentes/henriqueMeirelles.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 27 September 2007}}</ref> Meirelles was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 2002 as a member of the opposing [[Brazilian Social Democratic Party|PSDB]], but resigned as deputy to become Governor of the Central Bank.<ref name=MeirBio/>

His government achieved a satisfactory primary [[budget surplus]] in the first two years, as required by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] agreement, exceeding the target for the third year. In late 2005, the government paid off its debt to the IMF in full, two years ahead of schedule.<ref name=IMF>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4527438.stm |title=Brazil to pay off IMF debts early  |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=14 December 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2007}}</ref> Three years after the election, Lula had slowly but firmly gained the market's confidence, and sovereign risk indexes fell to around 250&nbsp;points. The government's choice of inflation targeting kept the economy stable, and was complimented during the 2005 [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]].

The Brazilian economy was generally not affected by the [[mensalão scandal]], which related to vote buying in the Brazilian Congress.<ref>{{cite news |author=Newsroom |title=O Chefe (The Boss) by Ivo Patarra |url=http://www.escandalodomensalao.com.br |access-date=19 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422145751/http://www.escandalodomensalao.com.br/ |archive-date=22 April 2018 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> In early 2006, however, Palocci had to resign as finance minister due to his involvement in an abuse of power scandal. Lula then appointed [[Guido Mantega]], a member of the PT and an economist by profession, as finance minister. Mantega, a former Marxist who had written a PhD thesis (in Sociology) on the history of economic ideas in Brazil from a left-wing viewpoint, was known for his criticism of high interest rates, something he claimed satisfied banking interests. Mantega was also supportive of a higher level of employment by the state.
Not long after the start of his second term, Lula's government announced the [[Growth Acceleration Program]] (''Programa de Aceleração de Crescimento'', PAC), an investment program to solve many of the problems that prevented the Brazilian economy from expanding more rapidly. The measures included investment in the creation and repair of roads and railways, simplification and reduction of taxation, and modernization of the country's energy production to avoid further shortages. The money pledged to be spent on this program was considered to be around [[Brazilian real|R$]] 500&nbsp;billion (more than 250&nbsp;billion dollars) over four years. Prior to taking office, Lula had been a critic of [[privatization]]. In his government, however, his administration created [[public-private partnership]] concessions for seven federal roadways.<ref>{{cite news |first=Isabel |last=Clemente |author2=Leal, Andréa |author3=Neves, Maria Laura  |title=Enfim, Lula privatizou... |url=http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EDG79551-6009,00.html |work=[[Época (Brazilian magazine)|Época]] |publisher=[[Rede Globo]] |accessdate=5 April 2008|language=pt }}</ref>

Lula's second term was much more confident; Lula was then not only the undisputed master of popular affection, as the first president to bring a modest well-being to many people, but also in complete control of his own administration. His two leading ministers were gone. Palocci was no longer needed to calm the nerves of overseas investors and Lula had never liked and somewhat feared [[José Dirceu]], a virtuoso of cold political calculation and intrigue. Their joint elimination freed Lula for sole command in [[Brasilia]]. When, midway through his second term its test came, he handled it with aplomb. The crash of Wall Street in 2008 might have been a tsunami in the US and Europe, he declared, but in Brazil it would be no more than a little 'ripple' ("''uma marolinha''"). The phrase was seized on by the Brazilian press as proof of reckless economic ignorance and irresponsibility.<ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n07/perry-anderson/lulas-brazil Lula’s Brazil] by Perry Anderson – Vol. 33 No. 7 · 31 March 2011 pages 3–12</ref>  In 2008, Brazil enjoyed economic good health to fight the global financial crisis with a large [[economic stimulus]] lasting, at least, until 2014.<ref>[http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2014/03/31/after-latin-americas-boom-years-anticipating-the-deluge/After Latin America’s boom years, anticipating the deluge] by John Paul Rathbone on 31 March 2014</ref> The Lula administration's economic policies also helped to significantly raise living standards, with the percentage of Brazilians belonging to the consumerist middle class rising from 37% to 50% of the population. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'': {{quote|Under Lula, Brazil became the world's eighth-largest economy, more than 20 million people rose out of acute poverty and [[Rio de Janeiro]] was awarded the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], the first time the Games will be held in South America.|''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 2010<ref name="WPost"/>}}

According to ''[[The Economist]]'' of 2 March 2006, Lula had a pragmatic foreign policy, seeing himself as a negotiator, not an ideologue, a leader adept at reconciling opposites. As a result, he befriended both Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chávez]] and U.S. President [[George W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/5578770|title=Brazil: Lula's leap|work=The Economist |date= 2 March 2006|url-access=limited}}</ref> Lula also gained increasing stature in the Southern hemisphere through economic growth in Brazil. In 2008, he was said to have become a "point man for healing regional crises," as in the [[2008 Andean diplomatic crisis|escalation of tensions]] between Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador.

== Corruption scandals and controversy ==
=== Mensalão ===
Lula's administration was plagued by corruption scandals, notably the [[Mensalão scandal]] and {{ILL|Escândalo dos Sanguessugas|pt}} in his first term. The Brazilian attorney-general presented charges against 40 politicians and officials involved in the Mensalão affair, including several charges against Lula himself. Top officials involved, such as [[Roberto Jefferson]], [[José Dirceu]], [[Luiz Gushiken]] and [[Humberto Costa]] denied he was aware of any wrongdoing; but one of his own party members, [[Arlindo Chinaglia]], alleged that Lula had been warned that the corruption existed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/brasil/lula-sabia-sim-mensalao-confirma-chinaglia|title=Lula sabia, sim, do mensalão, confirma Chinaglia|work=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]|publisher=[[Grupo Abril]]|date=30 October 2009 |accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref> Having lost numerous government aides in the face of political turmoil, Lula survived largely unscathed in the eyes of the public, with overwhelming approval rates.

His administration was heavily criticized for relying on local political barons, like [[José Sarney]], [[Jader Barbalho]], [[Renan Calheiros]] and [[Fernando Collor]] to ensure a majority in [[Congress of Brazil|Congress]]. He did lose some important votes in Congress however, such as when the [[Senate of Brazil|Senate]] barred a tax on financial transactions from being reinstated. Another frequent reproach was his ambiguous treatment of the left wing of the PT. Analysts felt that he would occasionally give in to left-wing calls for tighter government control on media and increased state intervention: in 2004, he pushed for the creation of a "Federal Council of Journalists" (CFJ) and a "National Cinema Agency" (Ancinav), the latter designed to overhaul funding for [[Electronic media|electronic communications]]. Both proposals ultimately failed amid concerns over the effect of state control on free speech.<ref>Caram, Fabio.

When wanted Italian terrorist [[Cesare Battisti (1954)|Cesare Battisti]] was arrested in Rio de Janeiro on 18 March 2007 by Brazilian and French police officers, Brazilian Minister of Justice [[Tarso Genro]] granted him status as a political refugee, a controversial decision which divided Italy and the Brazilian and international press.

On 29 October 2011, through the [[Syrian-Lebanese Hospital]] of [[São Paulo]], it was announced that Lula had a malignant tumor in his [[larynx]]. He elected [[chemotherapy]] to counteract the tumor, and on 16 November, his press office released photos of his wife shaving his beard and hair, leaving him bald, although he retained his moustache.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-15766843|title = Brazil's Lula da Silva shaves beard in cancer battle |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date = 16 November 2011 }}</ref> It was the first time that he had been seen without his beard since he left office.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15507640|title = Brazil ex-President Lula diagnosed with throat cancer |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date = 29 October 2011 }}</ref> He was treated with radiation, and the cancer went into remission.

According to official media sources,{{who|date=July 2017}} Lula was expected to join Rousseff's government.

=== 2018 presidential campaign ===
In 2017, Lula announced he would stand as the Workers' Party candidate for president again in the [[2018 Brazilian general election|2018 election]]. In September, he led a caravan of supporters to travel through the states of Brazil, starting with Minas Gerais, whose governor is Lula's political ally [[Fernando Pimentel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/politica/republica/apos-depor-em-curitiba-lula-vai-retomar-caravana-pelo-pais-por-minas-gerais-a3434q204gg2q3kovphkv444o|title=Após depoimento, Lula retoma caravana por Minas Gerais|website=Gazeta do Povo}}</ref> While traveling through the [[South Region, Brazil|South of Brazil]], the caravan became the target of protests.

Despite Lula's imprisonment in April 2018, the Workers' Party insisted in keeping Lula as the party's presidential candidate. In a poll conducted by [[Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics|Ibope]] in June 2018, Lula led with 33% of vote intentions, with the [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)|PSL]] candidate [[Jair Bolsonaro]] polling second with 15%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2018/noticia/lula-tem-33-bolsonaro-15-marina-7-e-ciro-4-aponta-pesquisa-ibope.ghtml|title=Lula tem 33%, Bolsonaro, 15%, Marina, 7%, e Ciro, 4%, aponta pesquisa Ibope|website=G1}}</ref> The former president negotiated a national coalition with the [[Partido Comunista do Brasil|PCdoB]] and regional alliances with the [[Partido Socialista Brasileiro|Socialist Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/08/da-cadeia-lula-articulou-acoes-que-resultaram-no-isolamento-de-ciro.shtml|title=Da cadeia, Lula articulou ações que resultaram no isolamento de Ciro|date=1 August 2018|website=Folha de S.Paulo}}</ref>

The Workers' Party officially nominated Lula as its candidate on 5 August 2018, in São Paulo. Actor [[Sérgio Mamberti]] read a letter written by Lula, who was unable to attend because of his prison sentence. Former São Paulo mayor [[Fernando Haddad]] was named as Lula's running mate and intended to represent Lula in events and debates. In the event that Lula were declared ineligible, Haddad would replace Lula as candidate, with [[Manuela d'Ávila]] replacing Haddad as the vice presidential candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2018/noticia/2018/08/06/fernando-haddad-sera-vice-na-chapa-de-lula-diz-pt.ghtml|title=PT anuncia Haddad como vice na chapa de Lula e acordo com o PCdoB|website=G1}}</ref>

In response to an appeal considering Lula as a political prisoner, the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee|UN Human Rights Committee]] ruled on 17 August 2018 that it had requested the Brazilian government to allow Lula to exercise his political rights.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In a 26 August poll, Lula had 39 percent of vote intentions within one month of the first round. The same opinion polling put Lula ahead of all his challengers in a second round run-off, including the nearest one, [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)|PSL]] candidate [[Jair Bolsonaro]], by 52 to 32.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2018/eleicao-em-numeros/noticia/2018/08/22/pesquisa-datafolha-lula-39-bolsonaro-19-marina-8-alckmin-6-ciro-5.ghtml|title=Pesquisa Datafolha: Lula, 39%; Bolsonaro, 19%; Marina, 8%; Alckmin, 6%; Ciro, 5%|date=22 August 2018|work=G1|access-date=26 August 2018|language=pt-BR}}</ref>
