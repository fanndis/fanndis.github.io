The '''president of the Russian Federation''' ({{lang-rus|Президе́нт Росси́йской Федера́ции|Prezident Rossiyskoy Federatsii}}), is the [[head of state]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], as well as the [[Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|commander-in-chief]] of the [[Russian Armed Forces]]. It is the [[Order of precedence in Russia|highest office in Russia]].

In 1991, the office was briefly known as the president of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] ({{lang-ru|Президе́нт Росси́йской Сове́тской Федерати́вной Социалисти́ческой Респу́блики|Prezident Rossiyskoy Sovetskoy Federativnoy Respubliki}}) until 25 December 1991. According to the [[1978 Russian Constitution]], the president of Russia was head of the [[executive branch]] and headed the [[Council of Ministers of Russia]]. According to the current [[1993 Constitution of Russia]], the president of Russia is not a part of the [[Government of Russia]], which exercises [[Executive (government)|executive]] power.<ref>I.E. Kozlova and O. E. Kutafin, Konstitutsionnoe Pravo Rossii (Constitutional Law of Russia) (4th ed, 2006) p. 383</ref>

In all cases where the president of the Russian Federation is unable to fulfill their duties, they shall be temporarily delegated to the [[Prime Minister of Russia|prime minister of Russia]], who becomes [[Acting President of Russia|acting president of Russia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eng.constitution.kremlin.ru/#article-92-3 |title=Конституция Российской Федерации |publisher=Eng.constitution.kremlin.ru |accessdate=3 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161341/http://eng.constitution.kremlin.ru/#article-92-3 |archive-date=10 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The power includes execution of federal law, alongside the responsibility of appointing federal ministers, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the State Duma and the [[Federation Council]]. The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Federal Assembly]] under extraordinary circumstances. The president also directs the foreign and domestic policy of the Russian Federation.

The president is elected directly through a popular vote to a six-year term. The law prohibits anyone from ever being elected to the presidency for a third consecutive term. In all, three individuals have served four presidencies spanning six full terms. In May 2012, [[Vladimir Putin]] became the fourth president; he was [[2018 Russian presidential election|re-elected in March 2018]] and [[Fourth inauguration of Vladimir Putin|inaugurated]] in May to a six-year term.

==History==
After the [[February Revolution|fall]] of [[Russian Empire|monarchy]] in 1917, the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|All-Russian Constituent Assembly]], [[1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election|elected]] later that year, planned on establishing a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[Presidential republic|presidential]] or [[Semi-presidential republic|semi-presidential]] [[federal republic]], [[Decree on the system of government of Russia (1918)|proclaiming]] the Russian Democratic Federal Republic in January 1918. The President of the RDFR would have been the head of state, elected for a one-year term by a majority vote in parliament involving the deputies of both chambers.<ref name="WhiteMovementPolitprogram">{{in lang|ru}} [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:VEYKQY0OcXkJ:www.bali.ostu.ru/umc/arhiv/2009/2/buhvostova.doc&cd=7&hl=ru&ct=clnk&gl=ru THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF RUSSIA IN PROGRAMS OF WHITE MOVEMENT AND WHITE EMIGRATION] Bukhvostovoj D.V.</ref> Due to [[Russian Constituent Assembly#Dissolving|the dissolution of the Assembly]] by the [[Bolsheviks]] and establishment of their [[One-party state|one-party]] [[dictatorship]], no person was ever elected to this office. 

[[Boris Yeltsin]] came to power with a wave of high expectations not long before the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's collapse]]. In may 1990, he was elected [[List of leaders of the Russian SFSR#Heads of state|Chairman of the Supreme Soviet (Parliament) of the Russian SFSR]] - the highest state office and thus became the head of state. As a result of the creation of the post of [[President of the Soviet Union]], the [[Subdivisions of the Soviet Union|Union republics]] also began to introduce the post of President. To do this, a [[1991 Russian presidential referendum|referendum]] was held in the Russian SFSR, in which 71% of voters voted for the creation of the post of President, elected in direct elections. On 12 June 1991 Yeltsin was elected president of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] with 57% of the vote, becoming the first popularly elected president.<ref name="Transcripts of 'Insight' on CNN">{{cite web|title=Transcripts of 'Insight' on CNN|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=7 October 2002|accessdate=17 July 2007|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0210/07/i_ins.01.html}}</ref> But Yeltsin never recovered his popularity after a series of economic and political crises in Russia in the 1990s.

Throughout his presidential terms and into his second term as the Prime Minister, Putin has enjoyed high approval ratings amongst the Russian public.

Medvedev was appointed [[First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia|First Deputy Prime Minister]] on 14 November 2005. Formerly [[Vladimir Putin]]'s [[chief of staff]], he was also the [[chair (official)|Chairman]] of [[Gazprom]]'s [[board of directors]], a post he had held, for the second time, since 2000.  On 10 December 2007, he was informally [[political endorsement|endorsed]] as a [[candidate]] for the forthcoming [[2008 Russian presidential election|presidential elections]] by the largest Russian [[political party]], [[United Russia]], and officially endorsed on 17 December 2007. Medvedev's candidacy was supported by former [[President (government title)|President]] Vladimir Putin and [[political groups during Vladimir Putin's presidency|pro-presidential]] [[political party|parties]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7136347.stm Putin sees Medvedev as successor] BBC News</ref> As [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]] and political [[:wikt:appointment|appointee]], Medvedev - Putin's former Chief of Staff and one-time rival to Sergey Ivanov - had never held [[election|elective]] office before 2009.

==Selection process==
===Eligibility===
A candidate for office must be a citizen of the Russian Federation who is at least 35 years old, has "permanently resided" in Russia for at least 25 years and does not have and has never previously had a foreign citizenship or residence permit.<ref>The Constitution of the Russian Federation: A Contextual Analysis, Henderson, Jane</ref> 

The Constitution of Russia [[term limits|limits]] the election of one person to the Presidency to two consecutive terms. Previously the constitution contains no ruling on a total number of terms that a President may serve, a former president could seek "re-election" after sitting out one complete term.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|title=Chapter 4.

===Inauguration===
{{Main|Russian presidential inauguration}}
[[File:Vladimir Putin inauguration 7 May 2012-10.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Vladimir Putin]] takes the Presidential Oath in 2012.]]
{{Politics of Russia}}
Inauguration of the President of Russia is conducted six years after the previous inauguration (since 2000, this 7 May). If the President was elected in early elections, he takes the oath, thirty days after the announcement of the results.

Before executing the powers of the office, a president is constitutionally required to take the presidential oath:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|title=Chapter 4. The President of the Russian Federation|website=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|accessdate=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212183338/http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|archive-date=12 December 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{quote|I swear in exercising the powers of the President of the Russian Federation to respect and safeguard the rights and freedoms of man and citizen, to observe and protect the Constitution of the Russian Federation, to protect the sovereignty and independence, security and integrity of the State, to faithfully serve the people.}}

===Vacancy or disability===
{{See also|Acting President of Russia}}
Vacancies in the office of President may arise under several possible circumstances: death, resignation and [[Impeachment in Russia|removal from office]]. In all cases when the President is unable to perform his duties, his powers are temporarily transferred to the [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] until the new President takes office.

==Insignia==
After the oath of office has been taken by the elected president, these following insignia are handed over to the president. These devices are used to display the rank of his office and are used on special occasions.

===Chain of office===
{{multiple image

 | direction = vertical
 | align = right
 | image1 = Russia president emblem.jpg
 | caption1 = Chain of office
 | image2 = Standart of the President RF.png
 | caption2 = Presidential standard
 | footer = 
}}
The first insignia that is issued is the [[livery collar|chain of office]] with an emblem. The central emblem is the red cross of the [[Order "For Merit to the Fatherland"]], with arms in equal size, charged with the [[Coat of Arms of Russia|Russian coat of arms]]. On the reverse of the cross, the words "Benefit, Honor and Glory" appear in the form of a circle. A golden wreath is used to connect the cross with the rest of the chain. There are 17 "links" in the emblem, with nine consisting of the Russian coat of arms. The other eight consist of a rosette, also bearing the motto "Benefit, Honor and Glory." At the inauguration of Vladimir Putin, the emblem was placed on a red pillow, positioned on the left side of the podium. According to the Presidential website, the emblem is placed inside the Kremlin and is used only on certain occasions.

===Standard (flag)===
The standard is a square version of the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]], charged in the center with the Russian coat of arms. Golden fringe is added to the standard. Copies of the standard are used inside his office, at the Kremlin, other state agencies, and while the president is traveling in a vehicle inside Russia. A 2:3 ratio version of the flag is used when the President is at sea. This is the most used symbol to denote the presence of the Russian President.

===Special copy of the Constitution===
The President also has a special copy of the [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Constitution]] that is used during the inauguration. This copy has a hard, red cover with gold lettering. An image of the Russian coat of arms appears in silver. The special copy is kept in the Presidential Library.

===Legal basis of the insignia===
These insignia and the procedure were established by the [[Decree of the President of Russia|presidential decree]] 1138 from 5 August 1996,<ref>Coбpaниe зaкoнoдaтeльcтвa Рoccийcкoй Фeдepaции 1996, №33, ar. 3976</ref> and modified by decree 832 from 6 May 2000.<ref>Coбpaниe зaкoнoдaтeльcтвa Рoccийcкoй Фeдepaции 2000, №19, ar. 2068</ref> In the new decree the special copy of the Constitution was removed as the third symbol of the Russian Presidency; the other two symbols remained intact because they were and are regulated by separate decrees. Nonetheless, the special copy of the Constitution still exists and serves for inauguration purposes only without being officially presented as a symbol of the Russian Presidency.

===Guarantor of the Constitution===
As the guarantor of the Constitution and the entire system of constitutional law, the President ensures that the constitutions, laws and regulations of the constituent territories of the Russian Federation be in full compliance with the country's Constitution and federal laws.

===Nominations===
The President is highly active in appointing top officials in the country. He nominates candidates for official state positions, who must ultimately be appointed based on parliamentary vote. The President submits nominations to the [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]], the [[upper house]] of [[Federal Assembly of Russia|the parliament]], for judges of the [[Constitutional Court]], the [[Supreme Court of Russia|Supreme Court]] and the [[Supreme Arbitration Court of Russia|Supreme Arbitration Court]], as well as for [[Prosecutor General of Russia]]. A proposal to relieve the Prosecutor General of his duties must also be submitted to the Federation Council. The President submits to the [[State Duma]], the [[lower house]] of parliament, nominations for appointment to the office of the Chairman of the [[Central Bank of Russia|Central Bank]], and likewise submits to the State Duma any proposal to relieve the Chairman of the Central Bank of his duties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/president03.shtml |title=Authority and Duties of the President |publisher=Archive.kremlin.ru |accessdate=3 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210072025/http://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/president03.shtml |archivedate=10 February 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Legislation===
Under the procedure stipulated by the Constitution, the President exercises his [[Right of initiative (legislative)|right to submit draft legislation]], as well as the right to [[sign into law|sign bills into law]] or to [[veto]] them.

The President has the right to suspend laws and [[regulation]]s issued by executive bodies of Russia's constituent territories if such laws and regulations contravene the Constitution, federal laws or international obligations of the Russian Federation, or violate [[human rights in Russia|human]] and [[civil rights]] and liberties, pending the resolution of the issue in an appropriate court.

The President can [[Decree of the President of Russia|issue by-laws by decree]], so long as such decrees are not in contradiction with existing laws (both local and federal), Russia's international agreements or the Russian Constitution.

The President is further empowered to grant federal [[Pardon#Russia|pardons]] and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Federal Assembly]] under extraordinary circumstances.

Other powers of the President in the sphere of legal activities and in his interaction with the Parliament include calling [[Elections in Russia|elections]] to the State Duma, [[Dissolving parliament#Russia|dissolving the State Duma]] in certain cases, and calling [[referendum]].

===Domestic policy===
Under the Constitution, the President is not empowered to determine the full range of short-, middle-, and long-term objectives and targets of domestic policy, but only its basic guidelines. In practice, he determines it with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation. They are to be implemented both by the President himself and by the [[Government of Russia]] within the bounds of their authority. The President’ fundamental positions on domestic policy issues are expressed in his written decisions regarding draft federal constitutional laws and draft federal laws, as well as his letters explaining the reasons for rejecting draft federal laws.

Within the bounds of the authority granted to the head of state by the Constitution and other laws, the President also shapes the basic domestic policy guidelines by issuing legal regulations and through organizational and regulatory activity, such as issuing decrees and executive orders. Each year the President is required to make an Address to the Federal Assembly regarding the situation in the country and the internal and foreign policy of the state.

===Foreign policy===
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama 7 July-3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Then-President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] with Then-[[US President]] [[Barack Obama]] in 2009.]]
The President is invested with extensive rights to implement the state's foreign policy. The President determines [[Foreign relations of Russia|Russia's position in international affairs]], along with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation, and represents the state in international relations, conducts negotiations and signs [[ratification]] documents. The President appoints and recalls [[diplomatic representative]]s of Russia to foreign states and [[international organization]]s. These appointments are preceded by consultations with the respective committees or commissions of the [[bicameralism|two houses]] of the Federal Assembly. The President signs [[international treaty|international treaties]].

===Ceremonial duties===
An important ceremonial role of the President is awarding state awards. [[List of orders, decorations, and medals of the Russian Federation|State Awards of the Russian Federation]] are the highest form of official recognition given to individuals for service to the nation in the fields of defense, state-building, economics, science, culture, art, education, health care, public safety, rights advocacy and charity. The state awards of the Russian Federation include the title of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]], [[Hero of Labour of the Russian Federation]] as well as orders, medals, emblems and honorary titles. New state honors and awards can be established by the President, who also presents these honors to the recipients in an official ceremony. A Commission for State Honors, which works on a voluntary basis, helps the President to objectively assess potential recipients.

==Residences==

Earlier, the President also could use the so-called 14th Administrative Corpus Building (the reserve residence), but in 2016 it was demolished.<ref name="residences" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://russian.rt.com/article/300478-zavershyon-demontazh-14-go-korpusa-kremlya|script-title=ru:Завершён демонтаж 14-го корпуса Кремля|website=RT|language=Russian|accessdate=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011165637/https://russian.rt.com/article/300478-zavershyon-demontazh-14-go-korpusa-kremlya|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Since 2000 the current home residence of the President is ''[[Novo-Ogaryovo]]'' ({{lang-ru|Ново-Огарёво}}). It was planned that it would remain at the disposal of Vladimir Putin after his term ended, as ''Gorki-9'' ({{lang-ru|Горки-9}}) (also called ''[[Barvikha]]'' ({{lang-ru|Барвиха}}), but actually near it) had remained at the disposal of [[Boris Yeltsin]] after his retirement.

Also, the President has several vacation residences outside of Moscow.<ref>[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=740687 Vladimir Putin Residences] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527054538/http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=740687 |date=27 May 2010 }}, Kommersant, #18(3594), 7 February 2007</ref>

==Political affiliation==
None of the Russian presidents to date have ever been a member of a [[political party]] while in office. In 2012, commenting on stepping down from the post of [[United Russia]] party leader, Vladimir Putin said "The constitution doesn’t forbid the president to be a member of any party, but in the spirit of how our political life has evolved, a president is first and foremost a consolidating figure for all the political forces of the country, for all citizens".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themoscownews.com/politics/20120424/189662904.html |title=Putin steps down as United Russia head |publisher=Themoscownews.com |date=24 April 2012 |accessdate=3 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228002950/http://themoscownews.com/politics/20120424/189662904.html |archivedate=28 February 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>

==Post-presidency==
[[File:Vladimir Putin 12 June 2001-2.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|President Vladimir Putin with former President [[Boris Yeltsin]] on 12 June 2001]]

On 16 August 1995, President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree "On some social guarantees of persons holding public positions of the Russian Federation and the position of federal public servants." 15 June 1999 went to President Yeltsin's decree on amendments and additions to the previous decree. On 11 November 1999 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the implementation of the amended decree of 15 June 1999.

On 31 December 1999, the day of the resignation of Boris Yeltsin, the president issued a decree "On guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stop exercising his powers, and his family," and the eponymous federal law was adopted by 25 January 2001.

This law establishes the legal, social and other guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stops the execution of its powers in connection with the expiration of his term of office or in advance in the event of his resignation or permanent incapacity for health reasons to exercise the powers belonging to him and his family:

*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, regardless of age, is entitled to a monthly lifetime pay of 75% of the monthly remuneration of the President of Russia.
*In the case of the President's death his family members are entitled to a monthly allowance in the amount equal to six times the minimum old-age pension, established by the federal law on the day of his death.
*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, has immunity. He can not be held criminally or administratively liable for acts committed by them during the execution of the President's powers, as well as arrested, detained, interrogated and subjected to a personal search, if these actions are carried out in the course of proceedings relating to the execution of his powers as President.

Beginning in 1999, all living former presidents were granted a pension, an office, and a staff. The pension has increased numerous times. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the government. All former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 are protected by the [[Federal Protective Service (Russia)|Federal Protective Service]] until the president's death. A spouse who remarries or divorced from president is no longer eligible for Federal Protective Service protection.

In 2020, the Constitution was amended to grant the former President immunity (except if he was removed from office by impeachment). This immunity may be lifted in the same manner as the impeachment procedure. Also, in accordance with the amendments, former presidents (except if he was removed from office by impeachment) were granted the right to become [[Senator for life|Senators for life]].<ref name=Constitution2020/>

===Living former Presidents===
As of {{currentmonth}} {{currentyear}}, there is only one living former president. The most recent death of a former president was that of Boris Yeltsin (1991–1999) on April 23, 2007, aged 76.

===Presidential centers===
[[File:Yeltsin Center-Yekaterinburg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Boris Yeltsin Presidential Center]]]]
In May 2008, the Federal law №68, "On centers of historical heritage of presidents of the Russian Federation ceased to carry out its powers", was adopted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rg.ru/2008/05/16/presidenty-centry-dok.html|script-title=ru:Федеральный закон о центрах исторического наследия президентов РФ, прекративших исполнение своих полномочий|website=Российская газета|language=Russian|accessdate=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011165832/https://rg.ru/2008/05/16/presidenty-centry-dok.html|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to this law, the objectives of the centers are the study and public presentation of historical heritage of presidents of Russia as an integral part of the modern history of Russia, the development of democratic institutions and the rule of law. The centers will be built for each former president of Russia. The first such [[Boris Yeltsin Presidential Center|center dedicated to Boris Yeltsin]] was opened in 2015 in [[Yekaterinburg]]. In the future the creation of presidential centers for Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev is also planned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://altapress.ru/story/v-rossii-poyavyatsya-medvedev-tsentr-i-putin-tsentr-191138|script-title=ru:В России появятся Медведев Центр и Путин Центр|date=22 November 2016|language=Russian|website=AltaPress|accessdate=24 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011165853/http://altapress.ru/story/v-rossii-poyavyatsya-medvedev-tsentr-i-putin-tsentr-191138|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
