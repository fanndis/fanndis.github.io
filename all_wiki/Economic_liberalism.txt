'''Economic liberalism''' is a [[Political philosophy|political]] and [[economic philosophy]] based on strong support for a [[market economy]] and [[private property]] in the [[means of production]]. Although economic liberals can also be supportive of [[government regulation]] to a certain degree, they tend to oppose [[government intervention]] in the [[free market]] when it inhibits [[free trade]] and [[Competition (economics)|open competition]]. Economic liberalism has been described as representing the economic expression of [[liberalism]].

As an [[economic system]], economic liberalism is organized on individual lines, meaning that the greatest possible number of [[Economy|economic]] decisions are made by [[individual]]s or [[household]]s rather than by [[collective]] [[institution]]s or [[organization]]s.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=20}} An economy that is managed according to these precepts may be described as liberal capitalism or liberal economy.

Economic liberalism is associated with free markets and private ownership of [[capital asset]]s. Historically, economic liberalism arose in response to [[mercantilism]] and [[feudalism]]. Today, economic liberalism is also considered opposed to non-capitalist economic orders such as [[socialism]] and [[Planned economy|planned economies]].<ref>Brown, Wendy (2005). ''Edgework: Critical Essays on Knowledge And Politics''. Princeton University Press. p. 39.</ref> It also contrasts with [[protectionism]] because of its support for free trade and [[Open economy|open markets]].

Economic liberals commonly adhere to a [[Political philosophy|political]] and [[economic philosophy]] which advocates a restrained [[fiscal policy]] and the [[Balanced budget|balancing of budgets]], through measures such as low taxes, reduced government spending and minimized government debt.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last1=Simmons|first1=Beth A.|last2=Dobbin|first2=Frank|last3=Garrett|first3=Geoffrey|date=October 2006|title=Introduction: The International Diffusion of Liberalism|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/introduction-the-international-diffusion-of-liberalism/1AAA24743F00B2AE436300BB686D8049|journal=International Organization|volume=60|issue=4|pages=781–810|doi=10.1017/S0020818306060267|issn=1531-5088}}</ref> [[Free trade]], [[deregulation]] of the economy, [[Tax cut|lower taxes]], [[privatization]], [[labour market flexibility]], [[opposition to trade unions]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=Boudreaux|first=Don|date=2015-03-31|title=Milton Friedman on the Real World Effects of Labor Unions|url=https://cafehayek.com/2015/03/milton-friedman-on-the-real-world-effects-of-labor-unions.html|access-date=2020-10-13|website=Cafe Hayek|language=en-US}}</ref> and [[Economic inequality#Various proposed causes of economic inequality|indifference towards economic inequality]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why Tackling Global Economic Inequality Is Liberal Democracy's Next Big Challenge|url=https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/amp/insights/25190/why-tackling-global-economic-inequality-is-liberal-democracy-s-next-big-challenge|access-date=2020-10-15|website=www.worldpoliticsreview.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Letters|date=2016-12-28|title=Liberal values and the growth of inequality {{!}} Letters|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/28/liberal-values-and-the-growth-of-inequality|access-date=2020-10-15|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Jeffrey Edward|date=2017-11-01|title=Has Inequality Led to a Crisis for Liberalism?|url=https://online.ucpress.edu/currenthistory/article/116/793/320/107978/Has-Inequality-Led-to-a-Crisis-for-Liberalism|journal=Current History|language=en|volume=116|issue=793|pages=320–323|doi=10.1525/curh.2017.116.793.320|issn=0011-3530}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Liberalism and the New Inequality|url=https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/issue-1/liberalism-and-the-new-inequality?token=-Gkz3XlDwyastTvUSsURTiIS7Xwexjiy|access-date=2020-10-15|website=The Breakthrough Institute|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-03-26|title=Why liberals are way, way too obsessed with income inequality|url=https://www.aei.org/economics/why-liberals-are-way-way-too-obsessed-with-income-inequality/|access-date=2020-10-15|website=American Enterprise Institute - AEI|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=September 13|first1=Ed Conard|last2=Edt|first2=2016 9:00 Am|title=What Liberals Don't Understand About Income Inequality|url=https://time.com/4474437/upside-of-income-inequality/|access-date=2020-10-15|website=Time|language=en}}</ref> are often hallmarks of economic liberalism.<ref name=":0"/> Economic liberalism follows the same philosophical approach as [[classical liberalism]] and [[fiscal conservatism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gamble|first=Andrew|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYltAAAAQBAJ&q=info:iYMlJ3MGTnAJ:scholar.google.com/&pg=PA53|title=Resilient Liberalism in Europe's Political Economy|date=29 August 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-04153-0|editor-last=Thatcher|editor-first=Mark|editor-last2=Schmidt|editor-first2=Vivien A.|pages=53–77|chapter=Neo-Liberalism and Fiscal Conservatism}}</ref>

== Origins ==
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adam Smith]] was an early advocate for economic liberalism]]
Arguments in favor of economic liberalism were advanced during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], opposing mercantilism and feudalism. It was first analyzed by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) which advocated minimal interference of government in a market economy, although it did not necessarily oppose the state's provision of basic [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s.<ref>Aaron, Eric (2003). ''What's Right?''. Dural, Australia: Rosenberg Publishing. p. 75.</ref> In Smith's view, if everyone is left to his own economic devices instead of being controlled by the state, the result would be a harmonious and more equal society of ever-increasing prosperity.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=20}} This underpinned the move towards a [[capitalist]] economic system in the late 18th century and the subsequent demise of the mercantilist system.

Private property and individual [[contract]]s form the basis of economic liberalism.{{sfn|Butler|2015|p=10}} The early theory was based on the assumption that the economic actions of individuals are largely based on self-interest ([[invisible hand]]) and that allowing them to act without any restrictions will produce the best results for everyone ([[spontaneous order]]), provided that at least minimum standards of public information and justice exist. For example, no one should be allowed to coerce, steal, or commit fraud and there is freedom of speech and press.

Initially, the economic liberals had to contend with the supporters of feudal privileges for the wealthy, [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] traditions and the rights of [[Monarch|kings]] to run national economies in their own personal interests.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} By the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, these were largely defeated. Today, economic liberalism is associated{{by whom|date=May 2019}} with [[classical liberalism]], [[neoliberalism]], [[right-libertarianism]] and some schools of [[conservatism]] such as [[liberal conservatism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

=== Position on state interventionism ===
Economic liberalism opposes government intervention on the grounds that the state often serves dominant business interests, distorting the market to their favor and thus leading to inefficient outcomes.{{sfn|Turner|2008|p=60-61}} 
[[Ordoliberalism]] and various schools of [[social liberalism]] based on classical liberalism include a broader role for the state, but they do not seek to replace private enterprise and the free market with [[Public sector|public enterprise]] and [[economic planning]].{{sfn|Turner|2008|pp=83–84}}{{sfn|Balaam|Dillman|2015|p=48}} A [[social market economy]] is a largely free market economy based on a [[free price system]] and private property, but it is supportive of government activity to promote [[Competition (economics)|competitive markets]] and [[social welfare]] programs to address [[social inequalities]] that result from market outcomes.{{sfn|Turner|2008|pp=83–84}}{{sfn|Balaam|Dillman|2015|p=48}}

Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that [[classical liberalism in the United States]] during the 19th century had distinctive characteristics as opposed to Britain:
{{quote|[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud7TN4Asro8C&pg=PA2|title=Freedom from Want: American Liberalism and the Idea of the Consumer|last=Donohue|first=Kathleen G.|year=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=2|isbn=9780801883910}}</ref>}}
