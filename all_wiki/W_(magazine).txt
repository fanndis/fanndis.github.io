'''''W''''' is an American [[fashion]] [[magazine]] which features stories about style through the lens of culture, fashion, art, celebrity, and film.

Conde Nast purchased the magazine from the original owner, [[Fairchild Publications]] in 2000. It was created in 1972<ref name="Kismet Girls" /><ref name="Fashion Theory" /> by the publisher of sister magazine ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'', [[James Brady (columnist)|James Brady]]. The magazine is an oversize format &ndash; ten inches wide and thirteen inches tall. [[Sara Moonves]] is the editor in chief;

''W'' has a reader base of nearly half a million, 469,000 of which are annual subscribers.<ref name="echo" />

==Publication history==
Originally a biweekly newspaper that was spun off from ''Women's Wear Daily'', ''W'' became an oversized monthly magazine in 1993.

Often the subject of controversy, ''W'' has featured stories and covers which have provoked mixed responses from its intended audience. In July 2005, ''W'' produced a 60-page [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]] portfolio of [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Brad Pitt]] entitled "Domestic Bliss".<ref name="Domestic Bliss" /> The shoot was based upon Pitt's idea of the irony of the perfect American family; set in 1963, the photographs mirror the era when 1960s disillusionment was boiling under the facade of pristine 1950s suburbia.

Other controversial issues include [[Steven Meisel]]'s shoot entitled "Asexual Revolution", in which male and female models (including [[Jessica Stam]] and [[Karen Elson]]) are depicted in gender-bending styles and provocative poses. In addition, [[Tom Ford]]'s racy shoot with [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]] and the accompanying article on sexuality in fashion came as a shock to some loyal readers. During the interview, Ford is quoted as saying "I've always been about [[pansexuality]]. Whether I'm sleeping with girls or not at this point in my life, the clothes have often been androgynous, which is very much my standard of beauty."<ref name="Fordbitten" /> [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]] also was the photographer for the racy photo shoot featured in the August 2007 issue, showcasing [[David Beckham|David]] and [[Victoria Beckham]].<ref name="American Idols" /> [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]] produced a 60-page tribute to New Orleans in the April 2008 issue, and shot a 36-page story on the newest fashion designers in Miami for the July 2008 issue.<ref name="Come on Down to Nawlins" /><ref name="Summer Camp" /> Most of ''W''{{'}}s most memorable covers are featured on the W Classics<ref name="Jennifer Lopez" /> page on the magazine's website.

''W'' is also known for its coverage of American and European society. Many of these society luminaries, as well as the elite of the entertainment and fashion industries, have allowed ''W'' into their homes for the magazine's W House Tours<ref name="W House Tours" /> feature, including [[Marc Jacobs]], [[Evelyn Robert de Rothschild|Sir Evelyn Rothschild]] and [[Imelda Marcos]].

In 2011, Steven Meisel created controversy again by promoting fake advertisements throughout the November issue of the magazine. In 2013, Meisel shot [[RuPaul's Drag Race Season 3]] contestant [[Carmen Carrera]] in an editorial called "Show girl", promoting the beauty of the transgender model.

In June 2019, Sara Moonves was named as the first ever female editor-in-chief in the magazine's history. The new W team finished the biggest Best Performances issue ever. In the first week of January 2020, W launched 9 covers, a 76-page celebrity portfolio covering 29 celebrities and 20 videos. <ref name="Brad Pitt" />

Additionally, W Magazine launched a series of new initiatives and dramatically expanded its digital footprint. They launched W’s first podcast, “5 Things with Lynn Hirschberg,” which has attracted a broad listener base and included guests like Quentin Tarantino, Charlize Theron, Saoirse Ronan, Greta Gerwig, Noah Baumbach, Nicole Kidman, Awkwafina, and Margot Robbie as a part of the new vision for the brand. <ref name="5 Things" />

Under Moonves's editorship the magazine underwent a major transition.

On August 14, 2020, ''W magazine'' was acquired by a group of new investors.<ref name="fashionweekdaily2020-08-14" />  They retained Moonves as editor in chief.  ''[[Daily Front Row]]'' credited Moonves with lining up the investors, which included supermodel [[Karlie Kloss]].

==International editions==
An international edition was previously published in Japan. The [[South Korea]]n edition was launched in 2005 and is published under license by [[Doosan Group|''Doosan Magazine'']].<ref name="Doosan Group" />{{dead link|date=October 2020}}
