===Political views===

Sutherland identifies as a [[Liberalism|political liberal]].<ref>https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/sutherland-politics-designated-survivor-1.3401718</ref>

In his January 2007 interview with [[Charlie Rose]], Sutherland said of his political views: 
<blockquote>I believe inherently that we have a responsibility to take care of each other, so when you talk about [[Universal health care|socialized health care]]: absolutely, that's a no-brainer. [[Free education|Free universities]]: absolutely, that's a no-brainer. So, in the definition, I guess those are leaning toward [[Socialism|socialist]] politics. To me, it's common sense.<ref>https://charlierose.com/videos/25280</ref></blockquote>

===Charity work===

Sutherland is a member of a Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artistsagainstracism.org/artists/|title=Artists – Artists Against Racism|website=artistsagainstracism.org}}</ref>
