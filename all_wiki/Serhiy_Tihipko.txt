==Education, the army, and the young communist league (Komsomol)==

Tihipko was educated at the local school in Lazovskiy district, and then went to university in [[Dnipropetrovsk]], where he graduated in [[Metallurgy|engineering-metallurgy]] from the [[Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Institute]] in 1982.<ref name = CV2009/>

He served in the Soviet Army in a tank regiment from 1982–1984.<ref name = CV2009/>

From there he became Chairman of the Board of the commercial bank [[Privatbank|Pryvat]] until 1997, helping in taking the small regional bank to become one of the biggest private banks in Eastern Europe."<ref name = CV2009/>

According to a poll by [[Research & Branding Group]], as of 27 November Tihipko was running fifth in polls at 4.4%, behind [[Viktor Yanukovych]] (32.4%), [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] (16.3%), [[Arseniy Yatseniuk]] (6.1%) and [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]] (4.5%), and ahead of [[Petro Symonenko]] (3.8%) and incumbent President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (3.5%).<ref>[https://archive.is/20120907120850/http://www.rb.com.ua/rus/politics/polls/2009/5558.html Electoral Situation in Ukraine: 50 days to go], [[Research & Branding Group]] (27 November 2009)</ref>

A poll conducted by [[FOM-Ukraine]] in late November placed him in third place at 7.4%, with 23% of the respondents stating that they consider Tihipko "a promising young politician whom they would like to see at the presidential elections." Director of the Penta Center for Applied Political Studies Volodymyr Fesenko thought that this third-place by Tihipko could be explained by the fact that some voters started to consider Tihipko not only an alternative to the leader of the [[Party of Regions]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]], but as an alternative to fellow candidate [[Arseniy Yatseniuk]].<ref>[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/26082/ Tihipko in third position in presidential race, according to poll], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (25 November 2009)</ref> According to a [[Russia]]n poll taken in the last week of the campaign, Serhiy Tihipko was to be the unexpected outsider, snapping the second place from Tymoshenko.<ref>[http://www.europarussia.com/posts/730 Ukraine.
