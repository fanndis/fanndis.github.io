The '''2020 MTV Video Music Awards''' were held on August 30, 2020. [[Keke Palmer]] hosted the 37th annual ceremony, which was presented primarily from [[New York City]], but with no in-person ceremony due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|ongoing COVID-19 pandemic]].

[[Lady Gaga]] was the most awarded act of the night having won five awards, as well as the most nominated alongside [[Ariana Grande]], with both artists receiving nine nominations each. Gaga was presented with the inaugural MTV Tricon award for achievements in three or more fields of entertainment. The [[MTV Video Music Award for Push Best New Artist#2020s|longlist]] of nominees for [[Push Best New Artist]] were revealed on July 23, 2020; nominees for other categories were announced on July 30.

==Ceremony information==
The awards were originally scheduled to be held at [[Barclays Center]] for the first time since [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards|2013]].<ref name="Deadline Barclays"/> Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in New York City|COVID-19 pandemic]], the event was expected to be held with "limited or no audience", as one of the first major indoor events to be held in the city since the onset of the pandemic in the state, with MTV also announcing plans for the show to "[span] [[Boroughs of New York City|all five boroughs]]" to "pay homage to the strength, spirit and incredible resilience of NYC and its beloved residents".<ref name="Deadline Barclays">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/mtv-vma-barclays-cuomo-1234693273/|title=MTV’s VMAs to Be Held at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center With ‘Limited or No’ Audience, Governor Cuomo Says|last=Aswad|first=Jem|date=June 29, 2020|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200630023552/https://variety.com/2020/music/news/mtv-vma-barclays-cuomo-1234693273/|archive-date=June 30, 2020|access-date=August 24, 2020}}</ref>

MTV eventually scrapped the indoor component of the ceremony at Barclays after "close consultation with state and local health officials" and announced that it would be conducted in an outdoor format across the city; the Center will host the 2021 show instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/08/mtv-video-music-awards-opt-out-barclays-center-event-1203007888/|title=MTV Video Music Awards Opt Out Of Indoor Event At Barclays Center After Health Warnings|last=Haring|first=Bruce|date=August 7, 2020|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808012647/https://deadline.com/2020/08/mtv-video-music-awards-opt-out-barclays-center-event-1203007888/|archive-date=August 8, 2020|access-date=August 24, 2020}}</ref> The majority of performances were pre-recorded either in New York City (with locations such as [[Hudson Yards (development)|Hudson Yards]] and a drive-in theatre in Brooklyn), or on a [[chroma key]] set with New York scenery for acts unable to travel to New York City (primarily in Los Angeles, and South Korea in the case of BTS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/9442393/bts-vmas-dynamite-mtv|title=BTS Make Explosive VMAs Debut With 'Dynamite' at 2020 MTV VMAs|last=Unterberger|first=Andrews|date=August 30, 2020|work=[[Billboard (magazine) |Billboard]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200831051245/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/9442393/bts-vmas-dynamite-mtv|archive-date=August 31, 2020|access-date=October 3, 2020}}</ref> All personnel entering New York City were required to quarantine for three to four days on arrival, and be [[COVID-19 testing|tested]] before and after filming.
