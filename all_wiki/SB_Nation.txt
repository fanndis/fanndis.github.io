'''''SB Nation''''' (originally known as '''''Sports Blog Nation''''') is a sports blogging network owned by [[Vox Media]]. It was co-founded by Tyler Bleszinski and [[Markos Moulitsas]] in 2005. The blog from which the network formed was started by Bleszinski as ''Athletics Nation'' in 2003, and focused solely on the [[Oakland Athletics]]. It has since expanded to cover sports franchises on a national scale, including all [[Major League Baseball]], [[National Basketball Association]], [[National Football League]], and [[National Hockey League]] teams, as well as college and soccer teams, [[mixed martial arts]] and [[professional wrestling]], totaling over 300 community sites. In 2011, the network expanded into technology content with ''[[The Verge]]'', leading to the parent company Sports Blogs Inc. being rebranded as Vox Media. ''SB Nation'' operates from Vox Media's offices in New York City and Washington, D.C.

== History ==
''SB Nation'' was co-founded by friends Tyler Bleszinski and [[Markos Moulitsas]] in 2005. The single blog from which the network formed was launched by Bleszinski as ''Athletics Nation'' in November 2003, and covered only the [[Oakland Athletics]] baseball team.<ref name="Orlando" /> ''Athletics Nation'' quickly became Blogads's second largest website, following [[Daily Kos]], where Moulitsas served as an editor.<ref name="Lincoln" /> Following the blog network's creation, six additional writers were hired to join Bleszinski in creating content, and Daily Kos' platform was implemented to encourage [[online community]] growth.<ref name="Lincoln" /> Established bloggers were selected to contribute articles, and sports fans could leave comments. After sites were created for all [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), [[National Football League]] (NFL), and [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) franchises, along with some college and other teams, Bleszinski focused on company growth and making money.<ref name="Lincoln" />

In 2008, ''SB Nation'' raised $5 million in a [[Series A round]] of financing with [[Accel Partners]], [[Allen & Company]], and [[Ted Leonsis]] contributing.<ref name="Schonfeld">{{cite web |last1=Schonfeld |first1=Erick |title=SB Nation Scores a Link Deal with the NHL |url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/13/sb-nation-scores-a-link-deal-with-the-nhl/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |access-date=March 21, 2018 |date=April 13, 2009}}</ref> Jim Bankoff, who was advising the company during the [[venture round]], became ''SB Nation''{{'s}} CEO in January 2009.<ref name="Dubois" /><ref name="Lincoln" /> The network had approximately 1 million unique users,<ref name="Kramer">{{cite web |last1=Kramer |first1=Staci D. |title=With Launch of The Verge, SB Nation Parent Rebrands as Vox Media |url=https://gigaom.com/2011/10/31/419-with-launch-of-the-verge-sbnation-parent-rebrands-as-vox-media/ |website=[[Gigaom]] |access-date=March 21, 2018 |date=October 31, 2011}}</ref> and nearly 185 blogs by February.<ref name="Overly" /> The NHL sanctioned and began linking to ''SB Nation'' content on its official website in April, when the network was averaging 5 million unique monthly visitors across nearly 200 sites.<ref name="Schonfeld" /> In July, [[Comcast]]'s [[venture capital]] branch, Comcast Interactive Capital, spearheaded a nearly $8 million second round of financing.<ref name="Lincoln" /><ref name="Key">{{cite journal |last1=Key |first1=Peter |title=Comcast SportsNet content sharing with SB Nation |journal=[[Philadelphia Business Journal]] |date=June 28, 2010 |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/blogs/technology/2010/06/comcast_sportsnet_content_sharing_with_sb_nation.html |access-date=March 20, 2018 |publisher=American City Business Journals |issn=0744-3587}}</ref> In September 2009, ''SB Nation'' was re-launched to serve as a nationally focused portal for the network's blogs.<ref name="Lincoln" /> Revenue generated by the network increased by four times in 2009.<ref name="Dubois" />

In February 2016, the site published a lengthy profile of [[Daniel Holtzclaw]], a former police officer convicted of multiple accounts of rape and other charges, focusing on his college football career. The piece, which was seen as sympathetic to Holtzclaw, was heavily criticized and was taken down within hours of publication. ''SB Nation'''s editorial director Spencer Hall apologized for "a complete breakdown" of ''SB Nation''{{'s}} editorial process, and described the story and its publication as a "complete failure" of site standards.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bonesteel |first1=Matt |title=SB Nation is right: Its story about a convicted rapist was a 'complete failure' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/02/18/sb-nation-is-right-its-story-about-a-convicted-rapist-was-a-complete-failure/ |access-date=February 19, 2016 |work=The Washington Post |date=February 18, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Victor |first1=Daniel |title=SB Nation Removes Article Criticized as Sympathetic to Convicted Rapist |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/19/business/media/sb-nation-daniel-holtzclaw.html |access-date=February 19, 2016 |work=The New York Times |date=February 18, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Mitchell |first1=Benjamin F |title=SB Nation publishes, takes down "failure" of story about Holtzclaw |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/02/18/sb-nation-publishes-takes-down-failure-story-holtzclaw/80553936/ |access-date=February 19, 2016 |work=USA Today |date=February 18, 2016}}</ref> ''SB Nation'' subsequently cut ties with the story's author, freelance journalist Jeff Arnold, and put its [[long-form journalism|longform]] program on hiatus pending a peer review of the editorial process that led to the Holtzclaw piece being published.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://deadspin.com/sb-nation-memo-announces-hiatus-for-longform-program-1760143895 |title=SB Nation Memo Announces Hiatus For Longform Program |last=Howard |first=Greg |publisher=[[Deadspin]] |date=February 19, 2016}}</ref> The head of the longform program, veteran sportswriter Glenn Stout, was suspended and later fired.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://deadspin.com/how-sb-nation-published-their-daniel-holtzclaw-story-1761030353 |title=How SB Nation Published Their Daniel Holtzclaw Story |last=Howard |first=Greg |publisher=[[Deadspin]] |date=February 26, 2016}}</ref>

In May 2016, Vox Media published the results of the peer review. It found that the longform program was isolated from the rest of ''SB Nation'' in a way that made it impossible for stories to be properly vetted. It also harshly criticized ''SB Nation'' for not giving individual editors the authority to review stories about sensitive topics. At the time, sensitive stories were reviewed by the newsroom's two most senior women, senior editor Elena Bergeron and senior content producer Sarah Kogod. The reviewers found that this practice made it appear that an individual editor did not have the responsibility to "care to the fullest extent about matters of ethics, integrity, and accuracy." It also raised concerns about the lack of diversity in the newsroom.<ref>[https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6553831/Peer_Review_Final.0.pdf Peer review of Holtzclaw story]</ref> Based on the review, ''SB Nation'' permanently shelved the longform program, replacing it with a features program. ''SB Nation'' also announced it would take steps to diversify its newsroom. In a statement, ''SB Nation'' said that the Holtzclaw situation revealed that "an organization cannot afford to wait to be diverse, particularly if that organization is one that wants to tell stories."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/26/11790170/a-note-from-sb-nation-leadership |title=A note from SB Nation leadership |publisher=SB Nation |date=May 26, 2016}}</ref>
