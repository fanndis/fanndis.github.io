It was formerly known as '''Revue Studios''', '''Universal-International Television''', '''MCA/Universal''', '''MTE Inc.''', '''NBC Productions''', '''NBC Studios''', '''Studios USA Television LLC''', '''Universal Network Television''', '''Universal Domestic Television''', '''USA Cable Entertainment''', '''NBC Universal Television Studio''', and '''Universal Media Studios'''.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:UniversalCity1964.jpg|thumb|The Universal City Logo from 1964–1969.]] -->

===Revue Studios===
'''Revue Productions''' (later known as '''Revue Studios''') was founded in 1943 by [[MCA Inc.]] to produce live radio shows and also produced "Stage Door Canteen" live events for the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) during World War II. Revue was re-launched as MCA's television production subsidiary in 1950. The partnership of [[NBC]] and Revue extends as far back as September 6, 1950, with the television broadcast of ''Armour Theatre'', based on radio's ''Stars Over Hollywood''. MCA bought the Universal Studios lot in 1958 and was renamed Revue Studios. Following its merger with [[Decca Records]], the then-parent of [[Universal Pictures]], the studio backlot name was changed back to Universal. In 1963, MCA formed Universal City Studios to merge the Motion Picture and Television arms of both Universal Pictures and Revue Studios and Revue was officially renamed Universal Television in 1963.

During the early years of television, Revue was responsible for producing and/or distributing many television programs. The most noteworthy included ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', which ran for only one season on [[CBS]] before going to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1958 until 1963. In addition, Revue also made [[Alan Hale Jr.]]'s ''Biff Baker, U.S.A.'' (1952–1953) and all three of [[Rod Cameron (actor)|Rod Cameron]]'s [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series, ''[[City Detective]]'' (1953–1955), ''[[State Trooper (TV series)|State Trooper]]'' (1956–1959), and ''[[Coronado 9]]'' (1960–1961) and the [[Bill Williams (actor)|Bill Williams]] western series, ''[[The Adventures of Kit Carson]]'' (1951–1955). It produced ''[[Bachelor Father (American TV series)|Bachelor Father]]'' (1957–1962), for "Bachelor Productions", [[Edmond O'Brien]]'s syndicated [[crime film]] ''[[Johnny Midnight (TV series)|Johnny Midnight]]'', based on a fictitious [[New York City]] actor-turned-[[private investigator]]. Another of its offerings was the 52-episode ''[[Crusader (TV series)|Crusader]]'', the first [[Brian Keith]] series, which ran on CBS 1955–1956. Another western produced by Revue and starring [[Audie Murphy]] was ''[[Whispering Smith (TV series)|Whispering Smith]]'' (NBC, 1959/61), based on the 1948 [[Alan Ladd]] movie [[Whispering Smith|of the same name]]. ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'' was produced first by George Gobel's Golmaco Productions, then by Kayro Productions on a back lot at Revue Studios from 1958 to 1963. Also ''[[McHale's Navy]]'' was produced by Revue from 1962 to 1966.

In December 1958 MCA/Revue purchased Universal Studios's 367-acre [[backlot]] to produce television series, then leased it back to Universal for a million dollars a year for a decade.<ref>pp. 16–17 Green, Paul & Price, Frank, ''A History of Television's the Virginian, 1962–1971''. McFarland, 30/05/2010</ref>

Revue also produced later seasons of ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' for CBS and [[NBC]] and in co-operation with [[Jack Benny]]'s J and M productions ''[[Checkmate (American TV series)|Checkmate]]'', ''[[General Electric Theater]]'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' for CBS, ''[[Studio 57]]'' for [[DuMont Television Network]], and westerns such as ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]'', ''[[The Restless Gun]]'' and ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'' for NBC, as well as ''[[Wagon Train]]'' for NBC and ABC, and the first two seasons of NBC's ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', based on a film released originally by [[Paramount Pictures]], whose pre-1950 theatrical sound feature film library was sold to MCA in 1957. ''Wagon Train'' was the only Revue-produced TV show ever to finish an [[United States|American]] television season in first place.

===NBC Productions/NBC Studios===
NBC Productions was founded in 1947 by [[RCA]] ([[NBC]]'s former parent company).

In 1996, the company was renamed NBC Studios. In 2004, NBC Studios was merged with Universal Network Television to form NBC Universal Television Studios.<ref name="tor" />

In 1995, NBC launched a partnership with television director [[James Burrows]] to create '''3 Sisters Entertainment''', who produced series for the network.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/95-OCR/BC-1995-05-22-OCR-Page-0026.pdf#search%3D%22nbc%20james%20burrows%22 |title=Burrows cheers venture with NBC |last=C. |first=S. |magazine=Broadcasting Magazine|date=May 22, 1995|via=American Radio History |page=30}}</ref> Out of these five, the most successful out of the venture were ''[[Will & Grace]]'' and ''[[Caroline in the City]]'' (co-produced and owned by [[CBS Productions]]).

===MCA Television===
MCA TV (also known as MCA Television Limited) was founded in 1948, several years before parent [[MCA Inc.]]'s purchase of [[Decca Records]] (in 1959) and [[Universal Pictures]] (in 1962). For more than four decades, it was one of the most active syndicators of television programming. During the 1980s, it distributed both off-network reruns of shows like ''[[Kate & Allie]]'' and ''[[Gimme a Break!]]'', as well as original syndication product like the animated action series ''[[Bionic Six]]'' (co-produced with [[TMS Entertainment]]), ''[[The Morton Downey Jr. Show]]'' (taped at then-MCA owned [[WWOR-TV]] in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]]), ''[[The Munsters Today]]'' (a revival of the Universal sitcom), and ''[[Pictionary (1989 game show)|Pictionary]]'', based on the popular board game.

MCA Television attempted several branded TV packages in 1985 to 2001 including an ad-hoc film network, a broadcast network and a few [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[block programming]]. The company launched the [[Fourth television network|Universal Pictures Debut Network]], an ad-hoc film network with plans to launch in two stages beginning in September 1985.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kerry Segrave|title=Movies at Home: How Hollywood Came to Television|date=January 1, 1999|publisher=McFarland|pages=147|isbn=9780786406548|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZTehB3M1_kC&pg=PA146|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> MCA TV and [[Paramount Domestic Television]] had formed Premier Advertiser Sales, a joint venture created for the sale of advertising for their existing syndicated programs in September 1989. As a possible outgrowth of this sales joint venture, MCA and Paramount began plans for a new network, [[fourth television network]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Plan Seen For Another TV Network|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/20/business/plan-seen-for-another-tv-network.html|author=Richard W.

In 1996, MCA TV was renamed Universal Television Enterprises; at this time they also assumed production and distribution of several daytime talk shows previously produced by [[Multimedia Entertainment]] (which Universal had acquired), including ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]''.

MTE (known as MCA Television Entertainment) was formed in 1987. It primarily dealt with made-for-TV movies and series like ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]'' that were made for cable networks like [[HBO]]. Like MCA TV, in 1996, it was renamed as Universal Television Entertainment.

[[EMKA, Ltd.]] is the holding company responsible for a majority of the pre-1950 [[Paramount Pictures]] sound library. As an official part of the [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] library, they are part of the company's television unit, Universal Television.

===Universal Television===
