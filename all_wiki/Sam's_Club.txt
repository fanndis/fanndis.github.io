==History==
{{More citations needed section|date=November 2009}}
[[File:Sams Club.svg|thumb|Former Sam's Club logo, used from 2006 to 2019]]

[[Sam Walton]] opened the first Sam's Club on April 7, 1983, in [[Midwest City, Oklahoma|Midwest City]], [[Oklahoma]], 21 years after he founded Walmart.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www3.samsclub.com/newsroom/Press/515|title=Sam's Club celebrates 25th anniversary with nationwide open house| date = April 10, 2007|publisher=Sam's Club}}</ref>

In 1987, Sam's Club made its first acquisition by purchasing [[West Monroe, Louisiana]]-based SuperSaver Wholesale Warehouse Club;<ref>{{cite web|title=Sam's Club History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/sam-s-club-history/|website=fundinguniverse.com}}</ref> the purchase expanded the chain by 24 locations.  The stores were owned by [[Alton Hardy Howard]] and his son John.

In 1989, Sam's Club entered [[New Jersey]] with a club in [[Delran Township, New Jersey|Delran]] in a former Two Guys/Jefferson Ward store. This was Walmart's first expansion into the Northeast.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} The first Walmart discount store (now expanded into a Supercenter) in New Jersey opened in 1991 in [[Turnersville, New Jersey|Turnersville]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}The company entered the [[Pennsylvania]] market in 1990.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In 1993, Walmart acquired [[Kmart|PACE Membership Warehouse]] from [[Kmart]] and converted many (but not all) PACE locations into Sam's Clubs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Sam's Club entered the Canadian market in Ontario in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://calgaryherald.com/business/fp/Mart+Canada+shut+Club+wholesale+unit/1332667/story.html|title=Wal-Mart Canada to shut its Sam's Club wholesale unit|first= Hollie|last=Shaw}}</ref>

The latest flagship club opening {{as of|2007|9|13|df=US|lc=on}}, was in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]]. The largest Sam's Club is located in [[Pineville, North Carolina]] with {{convert|185000|sqft|abbr=on}} of retail space that was formerly an [[Incredible Universe]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

On September 24, 2006, Sam's Club unveiled a new logo with an updated [[serif]] font.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sam's Club 'WOW' gifts: diamonds and jets |date=October 24, 2006 |url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/10/24/news/companies/sams_club/index.htm |website=CNN Money |access-date=2020-05-31}}</ref>

In December 2007, Sam's Club launched a new slogan, "Enjoy the Possibilities". Since then it became an official advertising slogan, mentioned in television and radio advertisements, but it is not mentioned on its website. {{As of|2008|January}}, the "Enjoy the Possibilities" slogan was no longer in use. Sam's Club launched their latest slogan "Savings Made Simple" in the fourth quarter of 2009.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Starting in April 2007, there was speculation of a possible sale or spinoff of Sam's Club from parent company Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|last=Otte|first=Timothy M.|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/value/2007/05/07/spinoff-in-bentonville-revisited.aspx|title=Spinoff in Bentonville Revisited|publisher=[[The Motley Fool]] |date=May 7, 2007|accessdate=November 27, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Otte |first=Timothy M.|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/value/2007/04/17/a-spinoff-in-bentonville.aspx?vstest=search_042607_linkdefault|title=A Spinoff in Bentonville? |publisher=[[The Motley Fool]]|date=April 17, 2007|accessdate=November 27, 2009}}</ref> At Walmart's 2007 annual shareholder's meeting in June, management said that Sam's Club is not for sale, although they did not say they are not considering a spinoff.

On February 26, 2009, [[Walmart Canada]] announced that it would be closing all six of its Canadian Sam's Club locations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123568673767887129|title=Walmart Canada to Close Sam's Club Division|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=February 26, 2009|last=Georgiades|first=Andy}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://micro.newswire.ca/release.cgi?rkey=1702264189&view=73403-0&Start=30&htm=0|title=Walmart Canada to close six Ontario Sam's Club locations to focus on supercenter expansion|date=February 26, 2009|publisher=[[Walmart Canada]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115164331/http://micro.newswire.ca/release.cgi?rkey=1702264189&view=73403-0&Start=30&htm=0|archive-date=January 15, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/article/593651|title=Walmart to close all Canadian Sam's Club stores|last=Flavelle| first=Dana|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=February 26, 2009|accessdate=February 26, 2009}}</ref> This was part of Walmart Canada's decision to shift focus towards supercentres, but some industry observers suggested that the operation was struggling in competition with [[Costco]] and the non-membership [[The Real Canadian Superstore]] (known as [[Maxi (Canadian supermarket)|Maxi & Cie]] in [[Quebec]]), that had a well-established history in the country. Sam's Club also rebranded the two as yet unopened locations as new Walmart Supercentres. {{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} In January 2010, it was announced that ten clubs would be closing, including four in California. At the same time, Sam's opened six new clubs at various locations in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-walmart12-2010jan12,0,7246820.story|title=Sam's Club to close 10 stores, four in California|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 12, 2010|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}</ref>

On January 24, 2010, it was announced that approximately 11,200 Sam's Club employees would be laid off. The layoffs resulted from the decision to outsource product sampling duties to an outside company (Rogers, Arkansas-based Shopper Events, which already performs in-store [[product demonstration]]s for Walmart) and to eliminate New Business Membership Representative positions throughout the chain. Most of the laid-off employees were part-time and represented about 10% of the total Sam's Club workforce.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

[[Rosalind Brewer]] was named as the new CEO for Sam's Club, a change that came into effect on February 1, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Walmart names Rosalind Brewer as Sam's Club CEO, first woman to hold CEO position|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/Wal-mart-says-sams-club-president-and-ceo-cornwell-leaving-company-to-return-to-northeast/2012/01/20/gIQAGRfYDQ_story.html |accessdate=January 20, 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 20, 2012}}</ref>

On January 11, 2018, Walmart announced that 63 Sam's Club locations in cities including [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Houston]], [[Seattle]], and others would be closing. Some of the stores had already liquidated, without notifying employees, some employees learned by a company-wide email delivered January 11. All of the 63 stores were gone from the Sam's Club website as of the morning of January 11, 2018. Walmart said that ten of the stores will become e-commerce distribution centers and employees can reapply to work at those locations. ''[[Business Insider]]'' magazine calculated that over 11,000 workers will be affected.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cleveland19.com/story/37245316/sams-club-stores-close-around-the-country | title=Sam's Club stores close around the country | work=Cleveland 19 News | date=January 11, 2018 | accessdate=January 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Walmart is abruptly closing 63 Sam's Club stores and laying off thousands of workers|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-suddenly-closes-sams-club-stores-2018-1/ref>|author=Peterson, Hayley|date=January 11, 2018|website=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=January 11, 2018}}</ref> On the same day, Walmart announced that as a result of [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|the new tax law]], it would be raising Walmart starting wages, distributing bonuses, expanding its leave policies and contributing toward the cost of employees' adoptions.

Like other warehouse clubs, Sam's Club sells most of its merchandise in [[Bulk purchasing|bulk]] and directly off [[pallet]]s. The clubs are arranged like [[warehouse]]s, with merchandise stocked in steel bins. Products sold include jewelry, designer goods, sunglasses, crystal and collectibles, electronics, floral, apparel, food, and meats. Most locations have Pharmacy, Tire and Battery, Photo (as of late 2019, photo was cut from most clubs), Bakery, Optical, Café and Floral departments. Sam's Club markets items under the private labels ''Simply Right'', ''Member's Mark'', ''Bakers & Chefs'', ''Daily Chef'', ''Sam's Club'', and [[Richelieu Foods]],<ref name=start>{{cite web|title=Richelieu experiences hiring boom, starts expansion|publisher=[[WCF Courier]], RC Balaban|date= August 27, 2006|url=http://wcfcourier.com/business/local/article_eb9bdbf5-8790-5071-9eab-2e82b2085f28.html}}</ref> a private label manufacturer of frozen pizza, salad dressing, sauces, marinades, condiments and deli salads.

==Sam's Business Center==
Sam's Club opened their first Business Center in Houston, Texas, in August 2008. Converted from an existing Sam's location, the Business Center is similar in concept to Costco's Business Centers.

In January 2010, the company announced it would be closing its Business Center, along with nine other clubs across the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.myfoxhouston.com/dpp/business/100112-sams-club-houston-closing|title=Sam's Club Closing Houston Location|publisher=MyFoxHouston.com<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>

In October 2018, Sam's Club opened <ref>

Customers can also order items ahead of time with same-day curbside pickup at the store. The Sam's Club Now store is located in Dallas, TX.

==Membership==
Membership is required to purchase at Sam's Club (except at the cafe, eye exams in Optical, and the pharmacy where federal law prohibits sales of prescription drugs to members only, as well as liquor and gasoline in some states).  A 10% surcharge is added (except where forbidden by local laws, such as in Elmsford, NY, CA, SC) to the prices for non-members, except for alcohol items, cafe, and pharmacy items where available. {{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} All memberships fees are 100% guaranteed at any point of time in the membership tenure.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Memberships can be renewed online, by mail, at the in-club at the Membership Services desk or any cash register, and at new ATM/Membership kiosks available in select locations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In the United States, Sam's Club memberships are divided into two categories: Sam's Club and Sam's Plus, each with an annual fee. Sam's Plus is the more comprehensive membership plan, that includes Cash Rewards, extra savings in Pharmacy and Optical centers, free shipping on items purchased from their website, and (at some clubs) early shopping hours before the store is opened to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eapplicants.com/sams-club-application| website=Sam's Club|title=Membership Application }}</ref>
