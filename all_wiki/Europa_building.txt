The '''Europa building''' is the seat of the [[European Council]] and [[Council of the European Union]], located on [[Rue de la Loi|Wetstraat/Rue de la Loi]] in the [[Brussels and the European Union|European Quarter]] of [[Brussels]], the capital city of [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/12/07-europa-building/|title=EUROPA : Home of the European Council and the Council of the EU - Consilium|website=www.consilium.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-08}}</ref> Its defining feature is the multi-storey "lantern-shaped" construct holding the main meeting rooms; a representation of which has been adopted by both the European Council and Council of the EU as their official emblems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/general-secretariat/corporate-policies/visual-identity/|title=Visual identity - Consilium|website=www.consilium.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-08}}</ref> The Europa building is situated on the former site of the partially demolished and renovated ''Bloc A'' of the Résidence Palace. Its exterior combines the [[Heritage registers in Belgium|listed]] [[Art Deco]] façade of the original 1920s building with the [[Contemporary architecture|contemporary]] design of architect [[Philippe Samyn]]. The building is linked via two [[skyway]]s and a service tunnel to the adjacent [[Justus Lipsius building]], which provides for additional office space, meeting rooms and press facilities.

==History==

=== Construction and former usage: the ''Résidence Palace'' ===

Following the end of the [[World War I|First World War]], [[Wallonia|Walloon]] businessman Lucien Kaisin, in collaboration with [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[architect]], Michel Polak, put forward plans for a complex of luxurious apartment blocks for the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[aristocracy]], the '''''Résidence Palace''''', to be situated on the edge of Brussels' [[Leopold Quarter]]. Consisting of five ''Blocs'' (A - E), it was to be "a small town within a city" able to provide its residents with onsite facilities, including a theatre hall, a swimming pool, as well as other commercial services such as a restaurants and hairdressers.<ref>[http://consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/web2sn03755.en09.pdf RÉSIDENCE PALACE Project Factsheet], Council of the European Union</ref>  The Résidence Palace aimed to address the dual shortage of suitable property and domestic workers for the upper classes following the [[Rape of Belgium|destruction]] brought about during the war.  The foundation stone of the [[Art Deco]] building was laid on 30 May 1923 with the first residents moving in 1927.

The development, however, only had a short commercial success. In 1940 tenants were forced to leave,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.blbe.be/default.asp?V_DOC_ID=1962 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-06-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514195604/http://www.blbe.be/default.asp?V_DOC_ID=1962 |archive-date=2010-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as the building was requisitioned as the headquarters of the occupying [[Wehrmacht|German army]] during the Nazi occupation of Belgium during the [[Second World War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/6206556/New-EU-showcase-building-to-cost-taxpayers-280-million.html|title=New EU showcase building to cost taxpayers £280 million|author=Bruno Waterfield in Brussels|date=18 September 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> In September 1944, after the liberation of Brussels, the building was taken over as headquarters for [[SHAEF]] and [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Rickett |first=Jack |date=31 January 2006 |title=My life as a Signalman during the War |work=WW2 People's War |publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/01/a9009001.shtml}}</ref>

After the War, in 1947, the Belgian government bought the complex and used Bloc A (the north-east L-shaped building) for administrative offices.<ref name="S&P">[http://www.samynandpartners.be/v5/03_projects/project_txt.asp?project=01-494&categoryid=2 NEW HEADQUARTERS OF THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION], Samyn and Partners</ref> At the end of the 1960s, as part of work to modernise the area during the construction of an underground railway line beneath [[Rue de la Loi]], a new aluminium façade was built, closing the L-shape, under the supervision of Michel Polak's sons.

=== Development of the European Quarter ===

With the development of the [[Brussels and the European Union|European Quarter]] in Brussels, city planners struggled to find suitable office space to house the growing staff and needs of the [[European Union]] institutions situated in close proximity to the Résidence Palace. In 1988, the eastern part of the Résidence Palace, ''Blocs'' ''D'' and ''E'' were demolished to make way for the construction of the [[Justus Lipsius building]] as the seat of the [[Council of the European Union]].  In 2002, the [[European Council]], the organisation gathering the EU's [[Head of state|Heads of State]]/[[Head of government|Government]] together, also began using the Justus Lipsius building as their Brussels venue. This followed an advanced implementation of a decision by European leaders during ratification of the [[Treaty of Nice|Nice Treaty]] to do so at such a time as the total membership of the European Union [[Enlargement of the European Union|surpassed 18 member states]]. Prior to this, the venue for European Council summits was in the member state that held the rotating [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]].  The resulting growing international media presence in the area led the [[Federal Government of Belgium|Belgian Federal Government]] to develop Blocs ''C'' and ''B'' as the site of its new [[International Press Center (Brussels)|International Press Centre]]. A swimming pool and theatre were also maintained.

However, in 2004 leaders decided the logistical problems created by the outdated facilities warranted the construction of a new purpose built seat able to cope with the nearly 6,000 meetings, working groups, and summits per year. This being despite a number of renovations to the Justus Lipsius building, including the conversion of an underground carpark into additional meeting rooms. The Belgian government proposed as a solution the conversion of ''Bloc A'' of the Résidence Palace into a new permanent seat for both EU institutions.<ref name="uia">{{cite web |url=http://www.uia-architectes.org/texte/england/Residence/2-results.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811010102/http://www.uia-architectes.org/texte/england/Residence/2-results.html |archivedate=2007-08-11 }}</ref> Under the deal, the site would be transferred from the Belgian government to the [[General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union|Council's Secretariat]]  for the symbolic price of €1, with the Council assuming the costs for the subsequent construction project.<ref name="EO149">Pop, Valentina (14 September 2009) [http://euobserver.com/9/28661 Top EU institution to move into eco-friendly building], EU Observer</ref>

=== Transformation of ''Bloc A'' into the Europa building ===
A pan-European competition was opened to redesign Bloc A of the ''Résidence Palace'' to suit the needs of the institutions. As the original Art Deco façades of the Résidence Palace building were listed as [[Heritage registers in Belgium|historic monuments]], competition rules stated that these had to be retained.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&hl=en&js=n&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurobru.com%2Fmonum060.htm&sl=fr&tl=en&history_state0=|title=Google Translate|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref>  In 2005, it was announced that a team involving Belgian architect [[Philippe Samyn|Philippe Samyn and Partners]] (architects and engineers), lead and design partner, in collaboration with Studio Valle Progettazioni (architects), and [[Buro Happold]] (engineers) had succeeded in submitting the winning design.<ref name="uia" /> The design for what was to be later named the Europa building, involved the demolition of the 1960s extension, and the construction of a large glass-cubed atrium connecting the two renovated wings of the original 1920s L-shaped building.  Within the atrium was to be constructed a "lantern-shaped" structure housing the main meeting rooms where the EU's delegations to the European Council and Council of the EU would meet.<ref name="S&P" /> <ref>Council of the European Union, Factsheet on the EUROPA building 7 December 2016.</ref> Due to EU leaders desire for the building to be [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]], the design was adapted to include solar panels on the roof and recycle rain water.<ref name="EO149" /> Construction work on the Europa building began in 2007, with the building originally planned to be finished and inaugurated by 2012.<ref name="consilium.europa.eu">[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/misc/86237.pdf Result of the architectural competition for the restructuring of block A of the Résidence Palace Building for use by the European Council], Council of the European Union</ref> However, due to setbacks and modifications to the design following the evolution of the European Council's needs as an institution during the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]] reforms, the building was completed in December 2016.

A defining characteristic of the Europa building is the use of striking colour compositions designed by the Belgian painter Georges Meurant. Lead architect, Philipe Samyn, wished to break with the visual "uniformity" of other EU buildings, believing that the EU was "not being served well by its [[Flag of Europe|blue flag with its 12 stars]]".<ref name="Atalli Europa">{{cite book |last1=Atalli |first1=Jean |title=Europa : European Council and Council of the European Union : History of the new headquarters 2005-2013 : Philippe Samyn, architect and engineer |date=2013 |publisher=Lannoo Publishers |location=Tielt |isbn=9789401414494 |page=161-176 |url=https://samynandpartners.com/17_e-books/Europa_en/files/assets/basic-html/index.html |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref> Further he believed it "too bland an image of the multiple institutional, social, cultural constellations that structure European conscience". Samyn, inspired by the boldness of Dutch architect [[Rem Koolhaas]]' 2002 "barcode" flag, commissioned Meurant to reflect the national heraldic symbols and flags, of the 28 member states in their diverse proportions and colours.<ref name="Atalli Europa" /> Meurant's orthogonal [[polychrome]] grid designs appear over ceilings in meeting rooms, doors, carpet flooring in conference rooms as well as in the corridors, press room, catering facilities and elevators.<ref name="Atalli Europa" /> Samyn and Meurant saw this as a way to not only bring more light and a warmer atmosphere into the building, and particular in the meeting rooms, which for security reasons had to remain windowless, but also to create a visual message, of "permanent creative effort and political debate" befitting a polyglottic diverse Union.<ref name="Atalli Europa" />
