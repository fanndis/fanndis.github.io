"'''Imagine'''" is a song by English rock musician [[John Lennon]] from his 1971 [[Imagine (John Lennon album)|album of the same name]]. The best-selling single of his solo career, its lyrics encourage listeners to imagine a world at peace without the barriers of borders or the divisions of religion and nationality and to consider the possibility that the whole of humanity would live unattached to material possessions. Shortly before his death, Lennon said that much of the song's lyrics and content came from his wife, [[Yoko Ono]], and in 2017 she received co-writing credit.<ref name="NotOnlyOne">{{cite news|first= Jude |last= Rogers |title= Not the only one: how Yoko Ono helped create John Lennon's Imagine |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= 6 October 2018 |accessdate= 23 August 2020 |url= http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/oct/06/how-yoko-ono-helped-create-john-lennon-imagine}}</ref>

Lennon and Ono co-produced the song with [[Phil Spector]]. Recording began at Lennon's home studio at [[Tittenhurst Park]], England, in May 1971, with final overdubs taking place at the [[Record Plant]], in New York City, during July. In October, Lennon released "Imagine" as a single in the United States, where it peaked at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song was first issued as a single in Britain in 1975, to promote the compilation ''[[Shaved Fish]]'', and reached number six on the [[UK Singles Chart]] that year. It later topped the chart following [[Murder of John Lennon|Lennon's murder]] in 1980.

[[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] named "Imagine" one of the 100 most performed songs of the 20th century. In 1999, it was ranked number 30 on the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]'s list of the 365 "[[Songs of the Century]]", earned a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]], and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s "[[500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]". A 2002 UK survey conducted by the ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums|Guinness World Records British Hit Singles Book]]'' named it the second best single of all time, while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it number three in the 2004 list of "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]". Since 2005, event organisers have played the song just before the New Year's [[Times Square Ball]] drops in New York City.

By 2013, "Imagine" had sold over 1.6 million copies in the UK. More than 200 artists have performed or [[cover version|covered]] the song, including [[Madonna]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Elton John]] and [[Diana Ross]]. After "Imagine" was featured at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the song re-entered the UK Top 40, reaching number 18. In March 2020, in response to the unfolding [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]], the actress [[Gal Gadot]] posted an informal but star-studded cover version of "Imagine" on Instagram.<ref>{{cite news|title= WATCH: Gal Gadot, Natalie Portman, Zoe Kravitz and others sing 'Imagine' to lift spirits during coronavirus fight |newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 19 March 2020 |accessdate= 27 March 2020 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/19/watch-gal-gadot-natalie-portman-zoe-kravitz-others-sing-imagine/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20200326090729/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/19/watch-gal-gadot-natalie-portman-zoe-kravitz-others-sing-imagine/ |archivedate= 26 March 2020 |url-status= live}}</ref> The song remains controversial, as it has been since its release, over its request to imagine "no religion too".<ref>{{cite news|first= Joe |last= Raiola |title= John Lennon's 'Imagine' Threatens the Conservative Mindset Far Away and Near |work= [[HuffPost]] |date= 28 August 2017 |accessdate= 22 February 2020 |url= https://www.huffpost.com/entry/john-lennons-imagine-threatens-the-conservative_b_59a2b197e4b0a62d0987b00b?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004}}</ref>

A lot of it – the lyric and the concept – came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted her contribution, but it was right out of ''Grapefruit''."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=51}} When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with [[David Sheff]] for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, Lennon told Sheff that [[Dick Gregory]] had given Ono and him a [[Christian prayer]] book, which inspired him the concept behind "Imagine".

{{quote|The concept of positive prayer ... If you can ''imagine'' a world at peace, with no denominations of religion – not without religion but without this my God-is-bigger-than-your-God thing – then it can be true ... the World Church called me once and asked, "Can we use the lyrics to 'Imagine' and just change it to 'Imagine ''one'' religion'?" That showed [me] they didn't understand it at all. It would defeat the whole purpose of the song, the whole idea.{{sfn|Sheff|1981|pp=212–13}}}}

{{listen|filename=Imagine.ogg|title="Imagine"|description=An excerpt from the second chorus}}
With the combined influence of "Cloud Piece" and the prayer book given to him by Gregory, Lennon wrote what author John Blaney described as "a humanistic [[paean]] for the people".{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=51}} Blaney wrote, "Lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach, but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s [[David Fricke]] commented: "[Lennon] calls for a unity and equality built upon the complete elimination of modern social order: geopolitical borders, organised religion, [and] economic class."{{sfn|Fricke|2012|p=59}}

Lennon stated: "'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is virtually the Communist Manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} He told ''[[NME]]'': "There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about ... [is] not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice ... British Socialism."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} Ono described the lyrical statement of "Imagine" as "just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people."{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}} ''Rolling Stone'' described its lyrics as "22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself".{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}}{{refn|group=nb|The lyrical content of "Imagine" relates to Lennon's concept of [[Nutopia]]: The Country of Peace, which he invented in 1973. Lennon included a symbolically mute anthem to this country on his album ''[[Mind Games (John Lennon album)|Mind Games]]'' released later that year.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=82}}}}

Lennon composed "Imagine" one morning in early 1971, on a [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] piano, in a bedroom at his [[Tittenhurst Park]] estate in [[Ascot, Berkshire]], England. Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session.{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}} Described as a [[Ballad|piano ballad]]<ref>{{cite web|first= Scott |last= Floman |title= John Lennon – Overview |accessdate= 22 July 2014 |url= http://sfloman.com/johnlennon.html#2 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023950/http://sfloman.com/johnlennon.html#2 |archivedate= 29 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first= Gary |last= Trust |title= A History Of Hit Piano Ballads On The Hot 100 |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 10 April 2013 |accessdate= 22 July 2014 |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/1556769/a-history-of-hit-piano-ballads-on-the-hot-100 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140706093801/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/1556769/a-history-of-hit-piano-ballads-on-the-hot-100 |archivedate= 6 July 2014 |url-status= live}}</ref> performed in the [[soft rock]] genre,<ref>{{cite news|first= Jef |last= Otte |title= Imagine that: John Lennon fans turn into zealots over Cee Lo's change in lyrics |newspaper= [[Westword]] |date= 11 January 2012 |accessdate= 22 July 2014 |url= http://www.westword.com/2012-01-12/music/john-lennon-fans-mad-at-cee-lo/full/ |archivedate= 28 July 2014 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140728042331/http://www.westword.com/2012-01-12/music/john-lennon-fans-mad-at-cee-lo/full/ |url-status= live}}</ref> the song is in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[C major]].{{sfn|Lennon|1983|pp=5–9}} Its 4-bar piano introduction begins with a C chord then moves to Cmaj7 before changing to F; the 12-bar verses also follow this chord progression, with their last 4 bars moving from Am/E to Dm and Dm/C, finishing with G, G11 then G7, before resolving back to C.{{sfn|Lennon|1983|pp=5–9}} The 8-bar choruses progress from F to G to C, then Cmaj7 and E before ending on E7, a C chord substituted for E7 in the final bar.

Lennon and Ono co-produced the song and album with [[Phil Spector]], who commented on the track: "We knew what we were going to do ... It was going to be John making a political statement, but a very commercial one as well ... I always thought that 'Imagine' was like the national anthem."<ref>For Spector co-producing with Lennon and Ono see: {{harvnb|Du Noyer|1971|pp=1–14}}; for "I always thought that song was like the national anthem" see: {{harvnb|Levy|2005|p=87}}.</ref> Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that—[Ono] and Phil will just sit in the other room and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well' ... I'll get the initial idea and ... we'll just find a sound from [there]."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|pp=50–51}}

Recording took place on 27 May 1971 at [[Ascot Sound Studios]], Lennon's newly built home studio at Tittenhurst Park, with string overdubs taking place on 4 July 1971 at the [[Record Plant]], in New York City.{{sfn|Madinger|Raile|2015|pp=239, 247}} Relaxed and patient, the sessions began during the late morning, running to just before dinner in the early evening. Lennon taught the musicians the chord progression and a working arrangement for "Imagine", rehearsing the song until he deemed the musicians ready to record.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=51}} In his attempt to recreate Lennon's desired sound, Spector had some early tapings feature Lennon and [[Nicky Hopkins]] playing in different octaves on one piano. He also initially attempted to record the piano part with Lennon playing the white [[Grand piano|baby grand]] in the couple's all-white room. However, after having deemed the room's acoustics unsuitable, Spector abandoned the idea in favour of the superior environment of Lennon's home studio.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=52}} They completed the session in minutes, recording three takes and choosing the second one for release.{{sfn|Fricke|2012|p=58}} The finished recording featured Lennon on piano and vocal, [[Klaus Voormann]] on bass guitar, [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] on drums and the Flux Fiddlers on strings.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=53}} The string arrangement was written by [[Torrie Zito]].<ref>{{cite web|author= Wenn |title= Lennon's Imagine Orchestrator Zito Dies |website= [[Contactmusic.com]] |date= 18 December 2009 |accessdate= 14 October 2020 |url= http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/lennons-imagine-orchestrator-zito-dies_1124994}}</ref>

Issued by [[Apple Records]] in the United States in October 1971, "Imagine" became the best-selling single of Lennon's solo career.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=292}} It peaked at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=57}} and reached number one in Canada on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' national singles chart, remaining there for two weeks.<ref name="Canada"/><ref>{{cite magazine|title= RPM 100 Singles |volume= 16 |issue= 16 |magazine= [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |date= 4 December 1971 |accessdate= 21 May 2016 |url= http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.7566&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.7566.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.7566 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160919151156/http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.7566&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.7566.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.7566 |archivedate= 19 September 2016 |url-status= live}}</ref> Upon its release the song's lyrics upset some religious groups, particularly the line: "Imagine there's no heaven".{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=382}} When asked about the song during one of his final interviews, Lennon said he considered it to be as strong a composition as any he had written with [[the Beatles]].{{sfn|Wenner|2010|p=13}} He described the song's meaning and explicated its commercial appeal: "Anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic, but because it is sugarcoated it is accepted ... Now I understand what you have to do. Put your political message across with a little honey."{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=87}} In an [[open letter]] to [[Paul McCartney]] published in ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Lennon said that "Imagine" was "'[[Working Class Hero]]' with sugar on it for conservatives like yourself".<ref>{{cite book|first= Peter |last= Doggett |year= 2009 |title= You Never Give Me Your Money: The Beatles After the Breakup |edition= 1st US hardcover |page= 179 |publisher= [[Harper (publisher)|Harper]] |isbn= 978-0-06-177446-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=luOMJFxe-bYC}}</ref> On 30 November 1971, the ''Imagine'' LP reached number one on the UK chart.<ref>{{cite book|first= Keith |last= Badman |year= 1999 |edition= 2001 |title= The Beatles After the Breakup 1970–2000: A Day-by-Day Diary |publisher= [[Omnibus Press|Omnibus]] |page= 55 |isbn= 978-0-7119-8307-6}}</ref> It became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career.<ref>{{cite book|first= Albert |last= Goldman |authorlink= Albert Goldman |year= 1988 |title= The Lives of John Lennon |publisher= [[William Morrow and Company]] |page= 397 |isbn= 1-55652-399-8}}</ref>

==Film and re-releases==
In 1972, Lennon and Ono released an 81-minute [[Imagine (1972 film)|film]] to accompany the ''Imagine'' album which featured footage of the couple in their home, garden and the recording studio of their [[Berkshire]] property at Tittenhurst Park as well as in New York City.{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=378}} A full-length documentary rock video, the film's first scene features a shot of Lennon and Ono walking through a thick fog, arriving at their house as the song "Imagine" begins. Above the front door to their house is a sign that reads: "This Is Not Here", the title of Ono's then New York art show. The next scene shows Lennon sitting at a white grand piano in a dimly lit, all-white room. Ono gradually walks around opening shutters that allow in light, making the room brighter with the song's progression.<ref>For a description of the room and Ono opening shutters see: {{cite book|first= Jacqueline |last= Edmondson |year= 2010 |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood]] |title= John Lennon: A Biography |url= https://archive.org/details/johnlennonbiogra00edmo |url-access= limited |isbn= 978-0-313-37938-3 |page= [https://archive.org/details/johnlennonbiogra00edmo/page/n176 140]}}; for the title of Ono's then New York art show see: {{harvnb|Harry|2000|pp=907–8}}.</ref> At the song's conclusion, Ono sits beside Lennon at the piano, and they share a quaint gaze, then a brief kiss.<ref>{{cite book|first= Philip |last= Norman |authorlink= Philip Norman (author) |title= John Lennon: The Life |year= 2008 |publisher= ECCO ([[HarperCollins|Harper Collins]]) |page= [https://archive.org/details/johnlennonlife00norm_0/page/763 763] |isbn= 978-0-06-075401-3 |url= https://archive.org/details/johnlennonlife00norm_0/page/763}}</ref>

Several celebrities appeared in the film, including [[Andy Warhol]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Jack Palance]], [[Dick Cavett]] and [[George Harrison]]. Derided by critics as "the most expensive home movie of all time", it premiered to an American audience in 1972.{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=378}} In 1986, [[Zbigniew Rybczyński]] made a [[music video]] for the song, and in 1987, it won both the "[[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity|Silver Lion]]" award for Best Clip at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and the Festival Award at the [[Festival do Rio|Rio International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Artist/VIP gallery: Zbigniew Rybczynski |publisher= Polish American Film Society |accessdate= 25 September 2012 |url= http://www.polishfilmla.org/wocms.php?siteID=13&ID=33 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130321001532/http://www.polishfilmla.org/wocms.php?siteID=13&ID=33 |archivedate= 21 March 2013 |url-status= live}}</ref>

''Rolling Stone'' ranked "Imagine" number three on its list of "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]", describing it as "an enduring hymn of solace and promise that has carried us through extreme grief, from the shock of Lennon's own death in 1980 to the unspeakable horror of [[September 11 attacks|September 11th]].

In addition to its general popularity, she noted its musical simplicity, its key of C major, "the plainest and least complicated key, with no [[sharp (music)|sharps]] or [[flat (music)|flats]]" aside from one passage with "a plaintive [[major seventh chord]] that allows a tiny bit of [[E minor]] into the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]". That piano part, "gentle as a rocking chair", underpins lyrics that, Waldman says, "belongs to the tradition of hymns or spirituals that visualize a glorious afterlife without prophesizing any immediate end to suffering on earth". This understanding is also compounded by the historical context of Lennon's own violent death, "remind[ing] us that the universe can run ramshod over idealistic people". Ultimately, the song "captures the fragility of our hope after a violent or destructive event ... [bu]t also reveals its tenacity".<ref name="Slate"/>
