'''Karnataka''' ([[ISO 15919|ISO]]: {{transl|kn|ISO|Karnāṭaka}}, {{IPA-kn|kəɾˈnɑːʈəkɑ}}) is a [[States of India|state]] in the south western region of [[India]]. It is the largest state in [[South India]] and seventh largest in India. It was [[Unification of Karnataka|formed]] on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|States Reorganisation Act]]. Originally known as the [[Mysore State|State of Mysore]], it was renamed ''Karnataka'' in 1973. The state corresponds to the [[Carnatic region]]. The capital and largest city is [[Bangalore]].

Karnataka is bordered by the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west, [[Goa]] to the northwest, [[Maharashtra]] to the north, [[Telangana]] to the northeast, [[Andhra Pradesh]] to the east, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the southeast, and [[Kerala]] to the south. It is the only southern state to have land borders with all of the other 4 southern Indian sister states. The state covers an area of {{convert|191976|km2|mi2}}, or 5.83 percent of the total geographical area of India. It is the [[List of states of India by area|sixth largest Indian state by area]]. With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the [[List of states of India by population|eighth largest state by population]], comprising 31 [[List of districts in India|districts]]. [[Kannada]], one of the [[classical language]]s of India, is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. Other minority languages spoken include [[Urdu]], [[Konkani]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam]], [[Kodava language|Kodava]] and [[Beary]].

Though [[Origin of Karnataka's name|several etymologies]] have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that ''Karnataka'' is derived from the Kannada words ''karu'' and ''nādu'', meaning "elevated land". ''Karu Nadu'' may also be read as ''karu'', meaning "black" and ''nadu'', meaning "region", as a reference to the [[Vertisol|black cotton soil]] found in the [[Bayalu Seeme]] region of the state. The [[British Raj|British]] used the word [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]], sometimes ''Karnatak'', to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna.<ref>See [[Lord Macaulay]]'s life of Clive and James Talboys Wheeler: ''Early History of British India'', London (1878) p.98. The principal meaning is the western half of this area, but the rulers there controlled the [[Coromandel Coast]] as well.</ref>

With an antiquity that dates to the [[paleolithic]], Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful [[Political history of medieval Karnataka|empires of ancient and medieval India]]. The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music, the [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] and [[Hindustani music|Hindustani]] traditions.

The [[economy of Karnataka]] is the [[List of Indian states and union territories by GDP|fourth-largest of any Indian state]] with {{INRConvert|16.99|t|lk=r}} in [[gross domestic product]] and a per capita GDP of {{INRConvert|231|k}}.<ref name="MOSPI" /><ref name="Karnataka Budget" /> Karnataka has the [[List of Indian states and territories by Human Development Index|nineteenth highest ranking]] among Indian states in [[Human Development Index]].<ref name="snhdi-gdl" />

Karnataka's pre-history goes back to a [[paleolithic]] hand-axe culture evidenced by discoveries of, among other things, [[hand axe]]s and [[Cleaver (tool)|cleavers]] in the region.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Recent findings on the Acheulian of the Hunsgi and Baichbal valleys, Karnataka, with special reference to the Isampur excavation and its dating|author=Paddayya, K.|journal=Current Science|volume=83|issue=5|pages=641–648|date=10 September 2002|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Evidence of [[neolithic]] and [[megalithic]] cultures have also been found in the state.

Prior to the third century BCE, most of Karnataka formed part of the [[Nanda Empire]] before coming under the [[Mauryan empire]] of [[Emperor Ashoka]]. Four centuries of [[Satavahana Dynasty|Satavahana]] rule followed, allowing them to control large areas of Karnataka. The decline of Satavahana power led to the rise of the earliest native kingdoms, the [[Kadambas]] and the [[Western Gangas]], marking the region's emergence as an independent political entity. The [[Kadamba Dynasty]], founded by [[Mayurasharma]], had its capital at [[Banavasi]];<ref name="origin">From the [[Talagunda]] inscription (Dr. B. L.

As the "[[doctrine of lapse]]" gave way to dissent and resistance from princely states across the country, [[Kittur Chennamma]], [[Sangolli Rayanna]] and others spearheaded rebellions in Karnataka in 1830, nearly three decades before the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].

After [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]], the Maharaja, [[Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar]], allowed his kingdom's accession to India. In 1950, Mysore became an Indian state of the same name; the former Maharaja served as its ''Rajpramukh'' (head of state) until 1975. Following the long-standing demand of the [[Unification of Karnataka|Ekikarana Movement]], Kodagu- and Kannada-speaking regions from the adjoining states of Madras, Hyderabad and Bombay were incorporated into the Mysore state, under the [[States Reorganisation Act]] of 1956.

Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward, reaching the sea at the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Other prominent rivers such as the [[Sharavati]] in [[Shimoga]] and [[Netravati River|Netravati]] in [[Dakshina Kannada]] flow westward, reaching the sea at the Arabian Sea. A large number of [[List of dams and reservoirs in Karnataka|dams and reservoirs]] are constructed across these rivers which richly add to the [[irrigation]] and [[hydroelectricity]] power generation capacities of the state.

== Sub-divisions ==
{{Main|Districts of Karnataka}}

There are 31 districts in Karnataka. Each district (''[[List of districts in India|zila]]'') is governed by a district commissioner (''ziladar''). The districts are further divided into sub-districts (''[[taluka]]s''), which are governed by sub-commissioners (''talukdars''); sub-divisions comprise blocks (''[[tehsil]]s''/''hobli''), which are governed by block development officers (''tehsildars''), which contain village councils (''[[panchayat]]s''), town municipal councils (''purasabhe''), city municipal councils (''nagarasabhe''), and city municipal corporations (''mahanagara palike'').

The diverse linguistic and religious ethnicities that are native to Karnataka, combined with their long histories, have contributed immensely to the varied cultural heritage of the state. Apart from Kannadigas, Karnataka is home to [[Tuluva]]s, [[Kodava people|Kodavas]] and [[Konkanis]]. Minor populations of [[Tibetan Buddhist]]s and tribes like the [[Soliga tribe|Soligas]], Yeravas, [[Toda people|Todas]] and [[Siddhis of Karnataka|Siddhis]] also live in Karnataka. The [[Folk arts of Karnataka|traditional folk arts]] cover the entire gamut of music, dance, drama, storytelling by itinerant troupes, etc. ''Yakshagana'' of Malnad and coastal Karnataka, a classical dance drama, is one of the major theatrical forms of Karnataka. Contemporary theatre culture in Karnataka remains vibrant with organisations like ''[[Ninasam]]'', ''[[Ranga Shankara]]'', ''[[Rangayana]]'' and ''[[Prabhat Kalavidaru]]'' continuing to build on the foundations laid by [[Gubbi Veeranna]], [[T.

[[Adi Shankaracharya]] (788–820) chose [[Sringeri]] in Karnataka to establish the first of his four ''[[matha]]s'' (monastery). [[Madhvacharya]] (1238–1317) was the chief proponent of [[Dvaita Vedanta|Tattvavada]] (Philosophy of Reality), popularly known as [[Dvaita]] or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy&nbsp;– one of the three most influential [[Vedanta]] philosophies. Madhvacharya was one of the important philosophers during the [[Bhakti movement]]. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, Madhvacharya is believed to be the third incarnation of [[Vayu]] (Mukhyaprana), after [[Hanuman]] and [[Bhima]]. The [[Haridasa]] devotional movement is considered as one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy, and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.

This movement was ushered in by the Haridasas (literally "servants of Lord Hari") and took shape in the 13th century – 14th century CE, period, prior to and during the early rule of the Vijayanagara empire. The main objective of this movement was to propagate the Dvaita philosophy of Madhvacharya (Madhva Siddhanta) to the masses through a literary medium known as [[Dasa Sahitya]] literature of the servants of the Lord. [[Purandara Dasa|Purandaradasa]] is widely recognised as the ''"Pithamaha"'' of [[Carnatic Music]] for his immense contribution. [[Ramanujacharya]], the leading expounder of ''[[Vishishtadvaita]]'', spent many years in [[Melkote]]. He came to Karnataka in 1098 AD and lived here until 1122 AD. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the [[Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple]] and a well-organised ''matha'' were built. He was patronised by the Hoysala king, [[Vishnuvardhana]].<ref name="Kamath">Kamath (2001), pp. 150–152</ref>

In the twelfth century, [[Lingayatism]] emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of this movement were [[Basava]], [[Akka Mahadevi]] and [[Allama Prabhu]], who established the [[Anubhava Mantapa]] which was the centre of all religious and philosophical thoughts and discussions pertaining to Lingayats. These three social reformers did so by the literary means of ''"Vachana Sahitya"'' which is very famous for its simple, straight forward and easily understandable Kannada language. Lingayatism preached women equality by letting women wear ''Ishtalinga'' i.e. Symbol of god around their neck. [[Basava]] shunned the sharp hierarchical divisions that existed and sought to remove all distinctions between the hierarchically superior master class and the subordinate, servile class. He also supported inter-caste marriages and Kaayaka Tatva of Basavanna. This was the basis of the [[Lingayat]] faith which today counts millions among its followers.<ref name="basava">Kamath (2001), pp. 152–154.</ref>

The [[Jain]] philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka. [[Islam]], which had an early presence on the west coast of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka.<ref name="bam">Sastri (1955), p. 396.</ref> [[Christianity]] reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century with the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[St. Francis Xavier]] in 1545.<ref name="chris">Sastri (1955), p. 398.</ref>

[[Buddhism]] was popular in Karnataka during the first millennium in places such as [[Gulbarga]] and [[Banavasi]]. A chance discovery of edicts and several [[Maurya]]n relics at [[Sannati]] in [[Gulbarga district]] in 1986 has proven that the [[Krishna River]] basin was once home to both [[Mahayana]] and [[Hinayana]] Buddhism. There are [[Refugees in India|Tibetan refugee]] camps in Karnataka.

=== Festivals ===

[[Bangalore Karaga]], celebrated in the heart of Bangalore, is the second most important festival celebrated in Karnataka.<ref name="nada-habba">{{cite news|title=Dasara fest panel meets Thursday|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/88517.cms|work=The Times of India, dated 2003-07-22|publisher=Times Internet Limited.|accessdate=17 July 2007|date=22 July 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012174112/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/88517.cms|archivedate=12 October 2007}}</ref> ''[[Ugadi]]'' (Kannada New Year), [[Makara Sankranti]] (the harvest festival), [[Ganesh Chaturthi]], [[Gowri Habba]], [[Ram Navami]], [[Nagaradhane|Nagapanchami]], [[Basava Jayanthi]], [[Diwali|Deepavali]], and [[Balipadyami]] are the other major festivals of Karnataka.

Kannada features a rich and ancient body of [[Kannada literature|literature]] including religious and secular genre, covering topics as diverse as [[Jainism]] (such as ''[[Purana]]s''), [[Lingayatism]] (such as [[Vachana]]s), [[Vaishnavism]] (such as [[Haridasa|''Haridasa Sahitya'']]) and [[Modern Kannada literature|modern literature]]. Evidence from edicts during the time of [[Ashoka]] (reigned 274–232 BCE) suggest that Buddhist literature influenced the [[Kannada alphabet|Kannada script]] and its literature. The [[Halmidi inscription]], the earliest attested full-length inscription in the Kannada language and script, dates from 450 CE, while the earliest available literary work, the ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'', has been dated to 850 CE. References made in the ''Kavirajamarga'', however, prove that Kannada literature flourished in the native composition metres such as ''Chattana'', ''Beddande'' and ''Melvadu'' during earlier centuries. The classic refers to several earlier greats (''purvacharyar'') of Kannada poetry and prose.<ref name="kavi5">Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 12, 17.</ref>
