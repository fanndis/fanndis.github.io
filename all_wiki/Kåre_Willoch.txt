He since has held the offices of Governor of [[Akershus]] (1989–1998) and Chairman of [[NRK]] (1998–2000).

Willoch graduated as an economist (cand. oecon.) from the [[University of Oslo]].  He served in the [[Independent Norwegian Brigade Group in Germany|Norwegian Brigade]] that formed part of the Allied occupation in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]], after [[World War II]], and became a dedicated friend of Germany during that time.

He speaks Norwegian, English, German and French, and has published a number of books.

== Early life ==

Willoch was born on 3 October 1928, in [[Oslo]], to Haakon Isaachsen Willoch (1896–1955) and his wife Agnes Christine Saure (1895–1994). He grew up in the [[East End and West End of Oslo|West End of Oslo]], and took [[examen artium]] in 1947.<ref name=nbl/> After that, he studied economics at the [[University of Oslo]], where he was taught by the [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]] winners [[Trygve Haavelmo]] and [[Ragnar Frisch]].<ref name="Wilsford">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/politicalleaders00wils |url-access=registration |last=Campbell |first=D.

== Political life ==

An economist (characterized in 1981 as being "supply side"<ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A11F73C5D0C738EDDA00894D9484D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fA%2fApple%2c%20R%2e%20W%2e%20Jr%2e New York Times] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312193543/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A11F73C5D0C738EDDA00894D9484D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fA%2fApple%2c%20R%2e%20W%2e%20Jr%2e |date=12 March 2007 }} Voters shift to right, bolstering NATO's northern outpost</ref>) by education and profession, Willoch made an early mark in national politics on issues related to economic development. He expressed deep skepticism about social democratic reforms throughout most of the post-World War II era and has advocated a larger role for market mechanisms to solve economic problems.

Within the Conservative Party, Willoch was respected for his command of the issues and consistent ideological platform.  In spite of friendly rivalry with [[Erling Norvik]], [[Rolf Presthus]], and [[Jan P. Syse]], these and other party members led a political shift in Norway away from the social democratic legacy.

=== Parliamentary and ministerial posts ===

Willoch's first political post was as a member of the Oslo City Council from 1952 to 1959.

Willoch was first elected to the [[Stortinget|Norwegian parliament]] at the age of 29 in 1957, representing [[Oslo]]. He was to be elected in every parliamentary election until 1989.

He was appointed Minister of Trade in the short-lived but notable [[John Lyng]] [[Lyng's Cabinet|cabinet]] from August to September 1963, following the [[Kings Bay Affair]] that brought to an end to the uninterrupted chain of Labor governments after World War II, headed by [[Einar Gerhardsen]] and [[Oscar Torp]].

He was appointed to the same ministerial post in the government of [[Per Borten]] in 1965-1970. He stepped down from this post to become first the Parliamentary leader, and then chairman of the Conservative Party 1970-1974.

In 1973, he unified his party in opposition to the newly introduced restrictions on use of land.  This formed a watershed in Norwegian politics, in that the party adopted a stronger ideological alternative to the social democratic establishment that had dominated post-World War II politics. Some historians, notably [[Francis Sejersted]] attribute this in large part to the [[Norwegian Labour Party]]'s exuberant continuation of social democratic efforts.

Willoch served as the leader of the Foreign Affairs committee in the coalition government and from then until he retired from parliament in 1989.

As a member of the Borten government he faced the constitutional question of the marriage of the then Crown Prince Harald to a commoner, Sonja Haraldsen. (They married in 1968 and since 1991 have been king and queen).  Willoch is reported to have never considered opposing the union.

Most of Willoch's political career was spent in opposition to various Labour governments. His rhetorical style was characterized by a use of [[Norwegian language|language]] and carefully articulated viewpoints that many considered cold or even sarcastic. His debates with long-time adversary [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] became legendary in Norway and were by several accounts based on personal as well as political differences. Brundtland wrote in her memoirs that she learned from Willoch "how not to treat people, or parties."

=== Premiership ===

Willoch was asked to form a Conservative party government when a non-socialist coalition gained a majority in the [[Stortinget 1981-1985|parliamentary elections of 1981]]. The cabinet depended on the support of the [[Christian People's Party (Norway)|Christian Democrats]] and [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]], and in 1983 these joined the cabinet to become a coalition government.

When [[Braathens SAFE Flight 139]] was hijacked, the hijacker demanded to speak with Willoch.<ref name=mannen>{{cite news |title=Den 24 år gamle mannen fra Karmøy som fredag kapret et fly|date=23 June 1985 |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

By the [[Stortinget 1985-1989|parliamentary elections of 1985]], Willoch's cabinet had lost much of its parliamentary basis and was dependent on the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress party]] for support.  The cabinet lost a vote of no-confidence over Willoch's proposal to increase surcharges on gasoline, when the Socialist Left Party, Labour Party, and Progress party joined forces.  A minority government led by [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] took over through the rest of the parliamentary period.

In spite of difficult parliamentary conditions, the Willoch cabinet embarked on a series of reforms that to many seemed like reversals of long-standing social democratic reforms, and to others changes that reflected new and emerging economic realities.

Often cited changes include:
* Dissolution of the governmental monopoly on radio and television broadcasting, including allowing the introduction of commercially funded content.
* Ending government intervention in credit markets, which in turn led to freer access to credit by both consumers and businesses.
* Reducing restrictions on ownership and sale of real estate
* Reducing restrictions on retail trade, especially with respect to opening hours
* Several efforts at strengthening the non-petroleum related Norwegian economy

The Willoch government's foreign policy was largely consistent with those of prior Labour party cabinets in terms of Norwegian commitments under the [[NATO]] treaty, but deviated sharply on the issue of non-proliferation. Where the Labour Party promoted a policy of "reduction of tensions" in the Nordic region, which marginalized Norway in NATO, the Willoch cabinet approved forward logistical bases for American rapid deployment forces<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlanterhavskomiteen.no/Tema/50aar/1a.htm |title=Norge og NATO under den kalde krigen |publisher=Atlanterhavskomiteen |author=Rolf Tamnes og Knut Einar Eriksen= |language=Norwegian |accessdate=28 May 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080514010309/http://www.atlanterhavskomiteen.no/Tema/50aar/1a.htm |archivedate = 14 May 2008}}</ref> and lent full support to the [[NATO Double-Track Decision|NATO double track decision]] of 1979.<ref>[http://www.hoyre.no/Saker/1093422603.03] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929093000/http://www.hoyre.no/Saker/1093422603.03 |date=29 September 2007 }}</ref>

Willoch earned a reputation as a sharp-witted, sometimes acerbic politician.  During his years in parliament and in various governments, he was respected by his political allies and opponents alike, but never gained the popularity of other prime ministers in his time in office.

In an op ed in the newspaper [[Aftenposten]] Willoch summarized his views on the Israeli politics towards the Palestinians. He warned that "Those who defend the Israeli politics towards the Palestinians support a policy that generates a hatred that may lead to a disaster for Israel" and concluded that "Friends of Israel should seek to make Israel accept the Arab peace proposal. It demands, amongst other things, borders as before the war of 1967, only with such adjustments that the parties reach agreement upon, and guarantees for Israel's security."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/article2866969.ece |title=Veien til katastrofen |newspaper=[[Aftenposten]] |date=14 January 2009 |first=Kåre |last=Willoch |language=Norwegian |accessdate=28 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318144044/http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/article2866969.ece |archivedate=18 March 2009}}</ref>

In 2011, Willoch expressed pessimism regarding President [[Barack Obama|Obama]]'s Mideast policy because Obama had chosen "a chief of staff who is a Jew," namely [[Rahm Emanuel]]. In response, Mona Levin, a writer who is a leading spokesperson for Norway's tiny Jewish community, said that Willoch's comment had been an expression of "racism and hatred toward Jews." In a TV debate, Levin charged that Willoch had been saying such things for 20 to 30 years, and that it had "just gotten worse and worse."<ref>Nordstoga,Anders; Mona Levin: - Willoch er rasist og viser jødehat; Aftenposten; 14 January 2009; https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/M1oWK/Mona-Levin---Willoch-er-rasist-og-viser-jodehat</ref> When Willoch was invited to speak at a ceremony memorializing the Jews from Bergen who were deported by the Nazis during World War II, the invitation was harshly criticized by the group Med Israel for Fred (With Israel for Peace) and by other supporters of Israel. In 2015, Erlend Wiborg, a Member of Parliament accused Wiborg of having "contributed to Jew-hatred generally and accorded it legitimacy."<ref>Myrland, Conrad; Willoch beviste at han er feil mann på minnemarkeringer for drepte jøder; Med Israel; 29 November 2012; https://www.miff.no/antisemittisme/2012/11/29willochbevisteathanerfeilmannpaminnemarkeringerfordreptej%C3%B8der.htm</ref><ref>Erlingsen, Hilde; Stortingspolitiker skylder på Kåre Willoch for jødehat i Norge; NRK; 17 February 2015; https://www.nrk.no/ostfold/stortingspolitiker-skylder-pa-kare-willoch-for-jodehat-i-norge-1.12215110</ref>

Regarding [[Cablegate]], he stated that "the problem is that the [[Western world]] is violating [[Human rights]], not that someone is uncovering those violations".<ref>[[Dagbladet]], 11 December 2010, p. 3 by [[Marie Simonsen]]: "Men problemet, som Kåre Willoch tørt konstaterte i et intervju med NRK, er ikke at noen avdekker brudd på menneskerettigheter, men at vesten begår dem."</ref>

In 1996, Willoch was decorated as a Commander with Star of the [[Order of St. Olav]].<ref name=nbl/>
