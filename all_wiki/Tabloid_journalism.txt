{{short description|style of journalism}}

'''Tabloid journalism''' is a popular style of largely [[Sensationalism|sensationalist]] [[journalism]], that takes its name from the format: a small-sized newspaper (half [[broadsheet]]).<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/tabloid-journalism Tabloid journalism] - [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].</ref> The size became associated with sensationalism, and ''tabloid journalism'' replaced the earlier label of ''[[yellow journalism]]''.<ref name="cohen">{{cite book|last=Cohen | first=Daniel | year=2000 | publisher=Twenty-First Century Books | title=Yellow Journalism | isbn=0761315020 | page=73}}</ref> Not all newspapers associated with tabloid journalism are tabloid size, and not all tabloid-size newspapers engage in tabloid journalism; in particular, since around the year 2000 many [[broadsheet]] newspapers converted to the more [[Tabloid (newspaper format)#Compact tabloids|compact tabloid format]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tabloid journalism|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/tabloid-journalism|access-date=2020-09-19|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> 

In some cases, celebrities have successfully sued for [[libel]], demonstrating that tabloid stories have defamed them.<ref name= ":0">{{cite news| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ |title= Dr. Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation |work=The Washington Post |date=July 14, 2016 |accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>

Publications engaging in tabloid journalism are known as '''rag newspapers'''. Notable tabloid publications include the ''[[National Enquirer]]'', ''[[New York Post]]'', and ''[[Globe (tabloid)|Globe]]'' in North America; and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[Daily Express]]'', ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', ''[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]'', ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'', ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'', ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', and the former ''[[News of the World]]'' in the UK.

Tabloid journalism has changed over the last decade to more online platforms that seek to target and engage youth consumers with celebrity news and entertainment.

==Supermarket tabloids==
{{see also|Gossip magazine}}

In the United States and Canada, "supermarket tabloids" are large, national versions of these tabloids, usually published weekly. They are named for their prominent placement along the [[supermarkets]] checkout lines.

In the 1960s, the ''National Enquirer'' began selling magazines in supermarkets as an alternative to newsstands. To help with their rapport with supermarkets and continue their franchise within them, they had offered to buy back unsold issues so newer, more up to date ones could be displayed.<ref name=":0" />

These tabloids—such as ''[[The Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]'' and the ''National Enquirer''—often use aggressive and usually mean-spirited tactics to sell their issues. Unlike regular tabloid-format newspapers, supermarket tabloids are distributed through the magazine distribution channel like other weekly magazines and mass-market paperback books. Leading examples include the ''National Enquirer'', ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'', ''[[Weekly World News]]'' (later reinvented as a parody of the style), and the ''[[Sun (supermarket tabloid)|Sun]]''. Most major supermarket tabloids in the U.S. are published by [[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]], including the ''National Enquirer'', ''Star'', ''[[The Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]'', and ''[[National Examiner]]''.

A major event in the history of U.S. supermarket tabloids was the successful libel lawsuit by [[Carol Burnett]] against the ''National Enquirer'' (''[[Carol Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.]]''), arising out of a false 1976 report in the ''National Enquirer'', implying she was drunk and boisterous in a public encounter with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]]. Though its impact is widely debated, it is generally seen as a significant turning point in the relations between celebrities and tabloid journalism, increasing the willingness of celebrities to sue for libel in the U.S., and somewhat dampening the recklessness of U.S. tabloids.<ref name= "carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi">{{cite news | last= Scott | first= Vernon | url= http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ | title= Carol Burnett launches trial balloon | date= March 22, 1981 | publisher= [[United Press International]] | website= UPI.com | accessdate= January 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name="carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes">{{cite news | last= Lindsey | first= Robert | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html | title= Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer | date= March 27, 1981 | work= [[The New York Times]] | accessdate= January 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name="how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html "How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court"], January 4, 1991, ''The New York Times'', retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name= "tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes">{{cite news | last= Langberg | first= Barry | url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids | title= Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment | date= August 12, 1991 | work= [[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate= January 1, 2017}} (Opinion essay by libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others)</ref><ref name= "tabloid_law_1999_08_atlantic">{{cite news | last= Beam | first= Alex | url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ | title= Tabloid Law| date= August 1999 | work= [[The Atlantic Monthly]] | accessdate= January 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name= "dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post">{{cite news | last= Andrews | first= Travis M. | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ | title= Dr. Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation | date= July 14, 2016 | work= [[The Washington Post]] | accessdate= January 1, 2017}}</ref> Other celebrities have attempted to sue tabloid magazines for libel and slander including [[Richard Simmons]] in 2017<ref>{{cite web |title= ''Richard Simmons v the National Enquirer'' |url= https://www.scribd.com/document/357656566/Richard-Simmons-v-the-National-Enquirer | via=Scribd |access-date= November 1, 2017}}</ref> and [[Phil McGraw]] in 2016.<ref name= "dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post" />

Tabloids may [[chequebook journalism|pay for stories]].  Besides [[scoop (news)|scoop]]s meant to be headline stories, this can be used to censor stories damaging to the paper's allies.  Known as "[[catch and kill]]", tabloid newspapers may pay someone for the exclusive rights to a story, then choose not to run it.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/catch-and-kill-at-national-enquirer-gives-media-one-last-black-eye-before-election/2016/11/05/2534d43e-a36c-11e6-8832-23a007c77bb4_story.html |title='Catch and kill' at National Enquirer gives media one last black eye before election |last=Sullivan |first=Margaret |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date= November 5, 2016|access-date= December 6, 2017}}</ref>  Publisher American Media has been accused of burying stories embarrassing to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/12/local/me-arnold12 |title=Tabloid's Deal With Woman Shielded Schwarzenegger |last1=Nicholas|first1=Peter|last2=Hall|first2=Carla|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date=August 12, 2005|access-date= December 6, 2017}}</ref> [[Donald Trump]],<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirer-shielded-donald-trump-from-playboy-models-affair-allegation-1478309380 |title=National Enquirer Shielded Donald Trump From Playboy Model's Affair Allegation |last1= Palazzolo| first1=Joe|last2=Rothfield|first2=Michael|last3=Alpert|first3=Lukas|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=November 4, 2016| accessdate=December 6, 2017}}</ref> and [[Harvey Weinstein]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/05/us/harvey-weinstein-complicity.html |title=Weinstein's Complicity Machine |last1= Twohey| first1= Megan| last2= Kantor| first2= Jodi| last3=Dominus|first3=Susan|last4=Rutenberg|first4=Jim|last5=Eder| first5= Steve| work= [[The New York Times]] |date= December 6, 2017| access-date= December 6, 2017}}</ref>

==Red tops==
The term "red tops" refers to British tabloids with red [[Nameplate (publishing)|mastheads]], such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'', the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', and the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/dec/06/pressandpublishing.abcs|title=Red-tops on the rise, survey shows|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=December 6, 2007|author=Stephen Brook|access-date=April 1, 2012}}</ref>

== Modern tabloid journalism ==
In the last decade, a lot of tabloid journalism and news production has changed mediums to online formats due to the transition to digital media.<ref name="Bastos 217–225">{{Citation|last=Bastos|first=Marco T.|chapter=Digital Journalism And Tabloid Journalism|date=2016-11-18|title=The Routledge Companion to Digital Journalism Studies|pages=217–225|editor-last=Franklin|editor-first=Bob|edition=1|publisher=Routledge|language=en|doi=10.4324/9781315713793-22|isbn=978-1-315-71379-3|url=http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/15368/1/Bastos%20-%20Digital%20Journalism%20and%20Tabloid%20Journalism%20%28preprint%29.pdf|editor2-last=Eldridge|editor2-first=Scott A.}}</ref> This change is to keep up with the era of digital media and allow for increased accessibility of readers.
