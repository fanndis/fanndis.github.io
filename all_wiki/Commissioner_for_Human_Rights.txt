The '''Commissioner for Human Rights''' is an independent and impartial non-judicial institution established in 1999 by the Strasbourg-based [[Council of Europe]], to promote [[awareness]] of and respect for human rights in the 47 member states. The activities of this institution focus on three major, closely related areas:
* country visits and dialogue with national authorities and civil society;
* thematic studies and advice on systematic human rights work; 
* [[Consciousness raising|awareness-raising]] activities.

The current Commissioner is [[Dunja Mijatović]], who began her six-year mandate on April 1, 2018 (succeeding [[Álvaro Gil-Robles]], [[Thomas Hammarberg]] and [[Nils Muižnieks]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/the-commissioner|title=The Commissioner for Human Rights|website=Commissioner for Human Rights|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>
