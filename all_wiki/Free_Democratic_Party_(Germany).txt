The FDP is led by [[Christian Lindner]].

The FDP was founded in 1948 by members of former liberal political parties which existed in Germany before World War II, namely the [[German Democratic Party]] and the [[German People's Party]]. For most of the [[German Federal Republic]]'s history, it has held the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in the [[Bundestag]]. It was a junior coalition partner to the [[CDU/CSU]] (1949–1956, 1961–1966, 1982–1998 and 2009–2013) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (1969–1982). In the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal election]], the FDP failed to win any directly elected seats in the [[Bundestag]] and came up short of the 5 percent threshold to qualify for list representation, being left without representation in the Bundestag for the first time in its history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/249651/umfrage/ergebnisse-der-fdp-bei-den-landtagswahlen/|title=Ergebnisse der FDP bei den jeweils letzten Landtagswahlen in den Bundesländern bis 2017 - Statistik}}</ref> In the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]], the FDP regained its representation in the Bundestag, receiving 10.6% of the vote.

Since the 1980s, the party has pushed [[economic liberalism]] and has aligned itself closely to the promotion of [[free market]]s and [[privatization]]. It is a member of [[Liberal International]], the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE) and [[Renew Europe]].

== History ==
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2013}}

=== Predecessors ===
The history of liberal parties in Germany dates back to 1861, when the [[German Progress Party]] was founded, being the first political party in the modern sense in Germany. From the establishment of the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] in 1867 until the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1933, the liberal-democratic camp was divided into a "national-liberal" and a "left-liberal" line of tradition. After 1918 the national-liberal strain was represented by the [[German People's Party]] (DVP), the left-liberal one by the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP, which merged into the [[German State Party]] in 1930). Both parties played an important role in government during the Weimar Republic era, but successively lost votes during the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] since the late-1920s. After the [[Nazi seizure of power]], both liberal parties agreed to the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] and subsequently dissolved themselves. During the 12 years of Hitler's rule, some former liberals collaborated with the Nazis (e.g. economy minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]]), while others resisted actively against Nazism (e.g. the [[Solf Circle]]).

Soon after World War II, the Soviet Union pushed for the creation of licensed "anti-fascist" parties in [[Soviet occupation zone|its occupation zone]] in East Germany. In July 1945, former DDP politicians [[Wilhelm Külz]], [[Eugen Schiffer]] and [[Waldemar Koch]] called for the establishment of a pan-German liberal party. Their [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany|Liberal-Democratic Party]] (LDP) was soon licensed by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]], under the condition that the new party joined the pro-Soviet "[[Democratic Bloc (East Germany)|Democratic Bloc]]".

In September 1945, citizens in [[Hamburg]]—including the anti-Nazi resistance circle "Association Free Hamburg"—established the ''Party of Free Democrats'' (PFD) as a [[bourgeois]] left-wing party and the first liberal Party in the Western occupation zones. The German Democratic Party was revived in some states of the Western occupation zones (in the Southwestern states of [[Württemberg-Baden]] and [[Württemberg-Hohenzollern]] under the name of [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party]]).

Many former members of DDP and DVP however agreed to finally overcome the traditional split of German liberalism into a national-liberal and a left-liberal branch, aiming for the creation of a united liberal party.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Alf Mintzel |title=Besatzungspolitik und Entwicklung der bürgerlichen Parteien in den Westzonen (1945–1949) |editor=Dietrich Staritz |work=Das Parteiensystem der Bundesrepublik |publisher=Leske + Budrich |year=1976 |page=79}}</ref> In October 1945 a liberal coalition party was founded in the state of [[Bremen]] under the name of Bremen Democratic People's Party. In January 1946, liberal state parties of the [[British occupation zone]] merged into the ''Free Democratic Party of the British Zone'' (FDP). A similar state party in [[Hesse]], called the Liberal-Democratic Party, was licensed by the [[Office of Military Government, United States|US military government]] in January 1946. In the state of Bavaria, a ''Free Democratic Party'' was founded in May 1946.

In the first post-war state elections in 1946, liberal parties performed well in Württemberg-Baden (16.8%), Bremen (18.3%), Hamburg (18.2%) and Greater Berlin (still undivided; 9.3%). The LDP was especially strong in the October 1946 state elections of the Soviet zone—the last free parliamentary election in East Germany—obtaining an average of 24.6% (highest in Saxony-Anhalt, 29.9%, and Thuringia, 28.5%), thwarting an absolute majority of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) that was favoured by the Soviet occupation power. This disappointment to the communists however led to a change of electoral laws in the Soviet zone, cutting the autonomy of non-socialist parties like the LDP and forcing it to join the SED-dominated [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]], making it a dependent "[[Bloc party (politics)|bloc party]]".

The [[Democratic Party of Germany]] (DPD) was established in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]] on 17 March 1947 as a pan-German party of liberals from all four occupation zones. Its leaders were [[Theodor Heuss]] (representing the DVP of Württemberg-Baden in the American zone) and [[Wilhelm Külz]] (representing the LDP of the Soviet zone). However, the project failed in January 1948 as a result of disputes over Külz's pro-Soviet direction.

=== Founding of the party ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1983-098-20a, Heuss.jpg|thumb|upright|Theodor Heuss, first chairman of the FDP and first President of West Germany]]
The Free Democratic Party was established on 11–12 December 1948 in [[Heppenheim]], in [[Hesse]], as an association of all 13 liberal state parties in the three Western zones of occupation.<ref group="Note">These regionally organised liberal parties were the ''Bremian Democratic People's Party'' (BDV) in the [[Bremen (state)|state of Bremen]], the ''Democratic Party of Southern and Middle Baden'' (DemP) in the [[South Baden|State of South Baden]], the ''Democratic Party'' (DP) in the [[Rhineland-Palatinate|State of Rhineland-Palatinate]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Northern Württemberg-Northern Baden]] (DVP) in the [[Württemberg-Baden|State of Württemberg-Baden]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Southern Württemberg-Hohenzollern]] (DVP) in the [[Württemberg-Hohenzollern|State of Württemberg-Hohenzollern]], the united ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) of the British zone of occupation (consisting of five state associations), the ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) in the [[Free State of Bavaria]], the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) in the [[State of Hesse]], and the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) of [[West Berlin]]. Cf. Almut Leh and Alexander von Plato, ''Ein unglaublicher Frühling: erfahrene Geschichte im Nachkriegsdeutschland 1945 - 1948'', Bundeszentrale für Politische Bildung (ed.), Bonn: Bundeszentrale für Politische Bildung, 1997, p. 77. {{ISBN|3-89331-298-6}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.freiheit.org/files/288/1948_Heppenheimer_Proklamation.pdf|title= Heppenheimer Proklamation der Freien Demokratischen Partei|trans-title= Heppenheim Proclamation of the Free Democratic Party|date= 12 December 1948|accessdate= 12 November 2013|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150903224113/http://www.freiheit.org/files/288/1948_Heppenheimer_Proklamation.pdf|archive-date= 3 September 2015|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The proposed name, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was rejected by the delegates, who voted 64 to 25 in favour of the name Free Democratic Party (FDP).

The party's first chairman was Theodor Heuss, a member of the Democratic People's Party in Württemberg-Baden; his deputy was [[Franz Blücher]] of the FDP in the British zone. The place for the party's foundation was chosen deliberately: the "Heppenheim Assembly" was held at the Hotel ''Halber Mond'' on 10 October 1847, a meeting of moderate liberals who were preparing for what would be, within a few months, the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]].

The FDP was founded on 11 December 1948 through the merger of nine regional liberal parties formed in 1945 from the remnants of the pre-1933 [[German People's Party]] (DVP) and the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), which had been active in the [[Weimar Republic]].

=== 1949–1969: reconstruction of Germany ===
[[File:Schlußstrich drunter - FDP election campaign poster, Germany 1949.jpg|thumb|"Schlußstrich drunter!"—FDP election campaign poster before the 1949 Bundestag election in Hesse calling for a halt on [[denazification]]]]
In the [[1949 West German federal election|first elections to the Bundestag on 14 August 1949]], the FDP won a vote share of 11.9 percent (with 12 direct mandates, particularly in Baden-Württemberg and Hesse), and thus obtained 52 of 402 seats. In September of the same year the FDP chairman [[Theodor Heuss]] was elected the first [[President of Germany|President]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. In his [[1954 West German presidential election|1954 re-election]], he received the best election result to date of a President with 871 of 1018 votes (85.6 percent) of the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Assembly]]. Adenauer was also elected on the proposal of the new German President with an extremely narrow majority as the first Chancellor. The FDP participated with the CDU/CSU and the [[German Party (1947)|DP]] in Adenauer's coalition cabinet: they had three ministers: [[Franz Blücher]] (Vice-Chancellor), [[Thomas Dehler]] (Justice) and [[Eberhard Wildermuth]] (housing).

On the most important economic, social and [[German question|German national]] issues, the FDP agreed with their coalition partners, the CDU/CSU. However, the FDP recommended to the bourgeois voters a secular party that refused the [[Parochial school|religious schools]] and accused the opposition parties of clericalization. The FDP said they were known also as a consistent representative of the market economy, while the CDU was then dominated nominally from the Ahlen Programme, which allowed a [[Third Way]] between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. [[Ludwig Erhard]], the "father" of the [[social market economy]], had his followers in the early years of the Federal Republic in the Union rather than in the FDP.

The FDP won Hesse's 1950 state election with 31.8 percent, the best result in its history, through appealing to East Germans displaced by the war by including them on their ticket.

Up to the 1950s, several of the FDP's regional organizations were to the right of the CDU/CSU, which initially had ideas of some sort of Christian socialism, and even former office-holders of the Third Reich were courted with national, patriotic values. The FDP voted in parliament at the end of 1950 against the CDU- and SPD- introduced [[de-nazification]] process. At their party conference in Munich in 1951 they demanded the release of all "so-called [[war crime|war criminals]]" and welcomed the establishment of the "Association of German soldiers" of former [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members, to advance the integration of the nationalist forces in democracy. The 1953 Naumann-Affair, named after [[Werner Naumann]], identifies old Nazis trying to infiltrate the party, which had many right-wing and nationalist members in [[Hesse]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Lower Saxony]]. After the [[British occupation zone|British occupation authorities]] had arrested seven prominent members of the Naumann circle, the FDP federal board installed a commission of inquiry, chaired by Thomas Dehler, which particularly sharply criticized the situation in the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP. In the following years, the right wing lost power, and the extreme right increasingly sought areas of activity outside the FDP. In the [[1953 West German federal election|1953 federal election]], the FDP received 9.5 percent of the party votes, 10.8 percent of the primary vote (with 14 direct mandates, particularly in [[Hamburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], Hesse, [[Württemberg]] and [[Bavaria]]) and 48 of 487 seats.

In the second term of the Bundestag, the South German Liberal democrats gained influence in the party.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Thomas Dehler, a representative of a more left-liberal course took over as party and parliamentary leader. The former Minister of Justice Dehler, who in 1933 suffered persecution by the Nazis, was known for his rhetorical focus. Generally the various regional associations were independent and translated so different from country to country accents in liberal politics. After the FDP had left in early 1956, the coalition with the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia and made with SPD and center a new state government, were a total of 16 members of parliament, including the four federal ministers from the FDP and founded the short-lived Free People's Party, which then up was involved to the end of the legislature instead of FDP in the Federal Government. The FDP first took it to the opposition.

Only one of the smaller post-war parties, the FDP survived despite many problems. In [[1957 West German federal election|1957 federal elections]] they still reached 7.7 percent of the vote to 1990 and their last direct mandate with which they had held 41 of 497 seats in the Bundestag. However, they still remained in opposition, because the Union won an absolute majority. In the following example, the FDP sat for a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe.

Even before the election Dehler was assigned as party chairman. At the federal party in Berlin at the end January 1957 relieved him Reinhold Maier. Dehler's role as Group Chairman took over after the election of the national set very Erich Mende. Mende was also chairman of the party.

In the [[1961 West German federal election|1961 federal elections]], it achieved 12.8 percent nationwide, the best result until then, and the FDP entered a coalition with the CDU again. Although it was committed before the election to continuing to sit in any case in a government together with Adenauer, Chancellor Adenauer was again, however, to withdraw under the proviso, after two years. These events led to the FDP being nicknamed the ''Umfallerpartei'' ("pushover party").<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OThqlaLQjFIC&pg=PA65 |page=66 |title=Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Eine Bilanz nach 60 Jahren |isbn=9783412202378 |last1=Schwarz |first1=Hans-Peter |year=2008 }}</ref>

In the [[Spiegel Affair]], the FDP withdrew their ministers from the federal government. Although the coalition was renewed again under Adenauer in 1962, the FDP withdrew again on the condition in October 1963. This occurred even under the new Chancellor, Ludwig Erhard. This was for Erich Mende turn the occasion to go into the cabinet: he took the rather unimportant Federal Ministry for All-German Affairs.

In the [[1965 West German federal election|1965 federal elections]] the FDP gained 9.5 percent. The coalition with the CDU in 1966 broke on the subject of tax increases and it was followed by a grand coalition between the CDU and the SPD. The opposition also pioneered a course change to: The former foreign policy and the attitude to the eastern territories were discussed. The new chairman elected delegates in 1968 Walter Scheel, a European-oriented liberals, although it came from the national liberal camp, but with Willi Weyer and Hans-Dietrich Genscher led the new center of the party. This center strove to make the FDP coalition support both major parties. Here, the Liberals approached to by their reorientation in East Germany and politics especially of the SPD.

=== 1969–1982: social changes and crises ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-047-20, Walter Scheel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Walter Scheel]] served as Foreign Minister, Vice Chancellor, Acting Chancellor and [[President of Germany]]]]
On 21 October 1969 began the period after the election of a Social-Liberal coalition with the SPD and the German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]. Walter Scheel was he who initiated the foreign policy reversal. Despite a very small majority he and Willy Brandt sat by the controversial New Ostpolitik. This policy was within the FDP quite controversial, especially since after the entry into the Federal Government defeats in state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Saarland on 14 June 1970 followed. In Hanover and Saarbrücken, the party left the parliament.

After the federal party congress in Bonn, just a week later supported the policy of the party leadership and Scheel had confirmed in office, founded by Siegfried party rights Zoglmann 11 July 1970 a "non-partisan" organization called the National-Liberal action on the Hohensyburgstraße - to fall with the goal of ending the left-liberal course of the party and Scheel. However, this was not. Zoglmann supported in October 1970 a disapproval resolution of opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander Möller, Erich Mende, Heinz Starke, and did the same. A little later all three declared their withdrawal from the FDP; Mende and Strong joined the CDU, Zoglmann later founded the German Union ''(Deutsche Union)'', which remained a splinter party.

The foreign policy and the socio-political changes were made in 1971 by the Freiburg theses, which were as Rowohlt Paperback sold more than 100,000 times, on a theoretical basis, the FDP is committed to "social liberalism" and social reforms. Walter Scheel was first foreign minister and vice chancellor, 1974, he was then second-liberal President and paving the way for inner-party the previous interior minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher free.

From 1969 to 1974 the FDP supported the SPD Chancellor Willy Brandt, who was succeeded by [[Helmut Schmidt]]. Already by the end of the 70s there did not seem to be enough similarities between the FDP and the SPD to form a new coalition, but the CDU/CSU chancellor candidate of Franz Josef Strauss in 1980 pushed the parties to run together again. The FDP's policies, however, began to drift apart from the SPD's, especially when it came to the economy. Within the SPD, there was strong grassroots opposition to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's policies on the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]]. However, within the FDP, the conflicts and contrasts were always greater.

=== 1982–1998: Kohl government, economic transition and reunification ===
In the fall of 1982, the FDP tore up its coalition agreement with the SPD and instead threw its support behind the CDU/CSU. On 1 October, the FDP and CDU/CSU were able to oust Schmidt and replace him with CDU party chairman Helmut Kohl as the new Chancellor. The coalition change resulted in severe internal conflicts, and the FDP then lost about 20 percent of its 86,500 members, as reflected in the general election in 1983 by a drop from 10.6 percent to 7.0 percent. The members went mostly to the SPD, the Greens and newly formed splinter parties, such as the left-liberal party [[Liberal Democrats (Germany)|Liberal Democrats]] (LD). The exiting members included the former FDP General Secretary and later EU Commissioner Günter Verheugen. At the party convention in November 1982, the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] state chairman [[Uwe Ronneburger]] challenged [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] as party chairman. Ronneburger received 186 of the votes—about 40 percent—and was just narrowly defeated by Genscher.

Young FDP members who did not agree with the politics of the FDP youth organization [[JungdemokratInnen/Junge Linke|Young Democrats]] founded in 1980 the [[Young Liberals (Germany)|Young Liberals]] (JuLis). For a time JuLis and the Young Democrats side by side, until the JuLis became the new official youth wing of the FDP. The Young Democrats split from the FDP and were left as a party-independent youth organization.

At the time of reunification, the FDP's objective was a special economic zone in the former East Germany, but could not prevail against the CDU/CSU, as this would prevent any loss of votes in the five new federal states in the general election in 1990.

In all federal election campaigns since the 1980s, the party sided with the CDU and CSU, the main conservative parties in Germany.  Following German reunification in 1990, the FDP merged with the [[Association of Free Democrats]], a grouping of liberals from [[East Germany]] and the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]].

During the political upheavals of 1989/1990 in the GDR new liberal parties emerged, like the FDP East Germany or the German Forum Party. They formed the Liberal Democratic Party, who had previously acted as a [[bloc party (politics)|bloc party]] on the side of the SED and with Manfred Gerlach also the last Council of State of the GDR presented, the Alliance of Free Democrats, (BFD). Within the FDP came in the following years to considerable internal discussions about dealing with the former bloc party. Even before the reunification of Germany united on a joint congress in Hanover, the West German FDP united with the other parties to form the first all-German party. Both party factions brought the FDP a great, albeit short-lived, increase in membership. In the first all-German Bundestag elections, the CDU/CSU/FDP centre-right coalition was confirmed, the FDP received 11.0 percent of the valid votes (79 seats) and won (in Halle (Saale)) the first direct mandate since 1957.

During the 1990s, the FDP won between 6.2 and 11 percent of the vote in Bundestag elections. It last participated in the federal government by representing the junior partner in the government of Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] of the CDU.

In 1998, the CDU/CSU - FDP coalition lost the federal election, which ended the FDP's nearly 30-year reign in government. In its 2002 campaign the FDP made an exception to its party policy of siding with the CDU/CSU when it adopted equidistance to the CDU and SPD. From 1998 until 2009 the FDP remained in the opposition until it became part of a new centre-right coalition government.

=== 2005 federal election ===
[[File:Freie Demokratische Partei, Deutschland (logo - 2005).svg|thumb|100px|Former logo (2001–2014)]]
In the [[2005 German federal election|2005 general election]] the party won 9.8 percent of the vote and 61 federal deputies, an unpredicted improvement from prior opinion polls. It is believed that this was partly due to [[tactical voting]] by CDU and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU) alliance supporters who hoped for stronger market-oriented economic reforms than the CDU/CSU alliance called for. However, because the CDU did worse than predicted, the FDP and the CDU/CSU alliance were unable to form a coalition government. At other times, for example after the 2002 federal election, a coalition between the FDP and CDU/CSU was impossible primarily because of the weak results of the FDP.

The CDU/CSU parties had achieved the third-worst performance in German postwar history with only 35.2 percent of the votes. Therefore, the FDP was unable to form a coalition with its preferred partners, the CDU/CSU parties. As a result, the party was considered as a potential member of two other [[political coalition]]s, following the election. One possibility was a partnership between the FDP, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]], known as a "[[traffic light coalition]]", named after the colors of the three parties. This coalition was ruled out, because the FDP considered the Social Democrats and the Greens insufficiently committed to market-oriented [[economic reform]]. The other possibility was a CDU-FDP-Green coalition, known as a "[[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]]" because of the colours of the three parties. This coalition wasn't concluded either, since the Greens ruled out participation in any coalition with the CDU/CSU. Instead, the CDU formed a [[Grand coalition]] with the SPD, and the FDP entered the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]]. FDP leader [[Guido Westerwelle]] became the unofficial leader of the opposition by virtue of the FDP's position as the largest opposition party in the Bundestag.

In the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|2009 European Parliament elections]], the FDP received 11% of the national vote (2,888,084 votes in total) and returned 12 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse//|title=Übersicht|work=bundeswahlleiter.de|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231614/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== 2009–2013: Merkel II government ===
[[File:ChristianLindner-FDP-1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christian Lindner]] is the party chairman, having succeeded [[Philipp Rösler]] in December 2013]]
In the [[2009 German federal election|September 2009 federal elections]], the FDP increased its share of the vote by 4.8 percentage points to 14.6%, an all-time record so far. This percentage was enough to offset a decline in the CDU/CSU's vote compared to 2005, to create a CDU-FDP centre-right governing coalition in the Bundestag with a 53% majority of seats.  On election night, party leader Westerwelle said his party would work to ensure that civil liberties were respected and that Germany got an "equitable tax system and better education opportunities".<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4728511,00.html Merkel to head new center-right government] [[Deutsche Welle]] 27 September 2009.</ref>

The party also made gains in the two state elections held at the same time, acquiring sufficient seats for a CDU-FDP coalition in the northernmost state, [[Schleswig-Holstein]], and gaining enough votes in left-leaning [[Brandenburg]] to clear the 5% hurdle to enter that state's parliament.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

However, after reaching its best ever election result in 2009, the FDP's support collapsed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/25/germany-liberal-collapse-free-democrats |title=Germany's Liberal Collapse |newspaper=Guardian |date=24 August 2009 |accessdate=2012-06-03 |location=London |first=Hans |last=Kundnani}}</ref> The party’s policy pledges were put on hold by Merkel as the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|recession of 2009]] unfolded and with the onset of the [[European debt crisis]] in 2010.<ref>Brian Parkin and Tony Czuczka (23 September 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-22/german-king-makers-fdp-face-parliamentary-exile-after-64-years.html German ‘King Makers’ FDP Face Parliamentary Exile] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> By the end of 2010, the party's support had dropped to as low as 5%. The FDP retained their seats in the state elections in [[2010 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|North Rhine-Westphalia]], which was held six months after the federal election, but out of the seven state elections that have been held since 2009, the FDP have lost all their seats in five of them due to failing to cross the 5% threshold.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Support for the party further eroded amid infighting and an internal rebellion over euro-area bailouts during the debt crisis.<ref>Leon Mangasarian (17 September 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-16/merkel-s-fdp-ally-begs-for-her-party-s-votes-in-survival-fight.html Merkel's FDP Ally Begs for Her Party’s Votes in Survival Fight] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref>

Westerwelle stepped down as party leader following the 2011 state elections, in which the party was wiped out in [[2011 Saxony-Anhalt state election|Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[2011 Rhineland-Palatinate state election|Rhineland-Palatinate]] and lost half its seats in [[2011 Baden-Württemberg state election|Baden-Württemberg]]. Westerwelle was replaced in May 2011 by [[Philipp Rösler]]. The change in leadership failed to revive the FDP's fortunes, however, and in the next series of state elections, the party lost all its seats in [[2011 Bremen state election|Bremen]], [[2011 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election|Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], and [[2011 Berlin state election|Berlin]].<ref>{{citation|title=Rot-Grün als "große Koalition"|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/nach-der-wahl-in-bremen-eine-rundum-ratlose-kanzlerin-1688143-infographic.html|magazine=[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=2012-05-15|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925082144/http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/nach-der-wahl-in-bremen-eine-rundum-ratlose-kanzlerin-1688143-infographic.html|archive-date=25 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In Berlin, the party lost nearly 75% of the support they had had in the previous election.<ref>{{cite news|author=Email Us |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/0919/1224304355656.html |title=Berlin pirates force FDP to walk the plank |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=2012-06-03}}</ref>

In March 2012, the FDP lost all their seats in [[2012 Saarland state election|Saarland]]. However, this was averted in the [[2012 Schleswig-Holstein state election|Schleswig-Holstein]] state elections, when they achieved 8% of the vote, which was a severe loss of seats but still over the 5% threshold. In the snap elections in [[2012 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|North Rhine-Westphalia]] a week later, the FDP not only crossed the threshold, but also increased its share of the votes to 2 percentage points higher than in the previous state election. This was attributed to the local leadership of [[Christian Lindner]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/14/world/europe/in-rebuke-to-merkel-social-democrats-win-german-vote.html | work=The New York Times | first=Nicholas | last=Kulish | title=Angela Merkel's Party Loses State Election in Germany | date=13 May 2012}}</ref>

=== 2013 federal election ===
The FDP last won a directly elected seat in 1990—the only time it has won a directly elected seat since 1957.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ACIDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA27 |title=The Left Party in Contemporary German Politics|author1=Dan Hough|author2=Michael Koß|author3=Jonathan Olsen|publisher=[[Springer Nature|Springer]]|date=2007|isbn=978-0230592148}}</ref> The party's inability to win directly elected seats came back to haunt it at the [[2013 German federal election|2013 election]], in which it came up just short of the 5% threshold. With no directly elected seats, the FDP was shut out of the Bundestag for the first time since 1949. After the previous chairman Philipp Rösler then resigned, Christian Lindner took over the leadership of the party.

=== 2014 European and state elections ===
In the [[2014 European Parliament election in Germany|2014 European parliament elections]], the FDP received 3.36% of the national vote (986,253 votes in total) and returned 3 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_14/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/ |title=Übersicht |work=bundeswahlleiter.de |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705072802/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_14/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/ |archive-date=5 July 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref> In the [[2014 Brandenburg state election]] the party experienced a 5.8% down-swing and lost all their representatives in the Brandenburg state parliament. In the [[2014 Saxony state election]], the party experienced a 5.2% down-swing, again losing all of its seats. In the [[2014 Thuringian state election]] a similar phenomenon was repeated with the party falling below the 5% threshold following a 5.1% drop in popular vote.

=== 2015–present ===
The party managed to enter parliament in the [[2015 Bremen state election]] with the party receiving 6.5% of the vote and gaining 6 seats. However, it failed to get into government as a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Greens was created. In the [[2016 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election]] the party failed to get into parliament despite increasing its vote share by 0.3%. The party did manage to get into parliament in [[Baden-Württemberg]], gaining 3% of the vote and a total of 12 seats. This represents a five-seat improvement over their previous results. In the [[2016 Berlin state election]] the party gained 4.9% of the vote and 12 seats but still failed to get into government. A red-red-green coalition was instead formed relegating the FDP to the opposition. In the [[2016 Rhineland-Palatinate state election]], the party managed to enter parliament receiving 6.2% of the vote and 7 seats. It also managed to enter government under a [[traffic light coalition]]. In [[2016 Saxony-Anhalt state election]] the party narrowly missed the 5% threshold, receiving 4.9% of the vote and therefore receiving zero seats despite a 1% swing in their favour.

The [[2017 North Rhine-Westphalia state election]] was widely considered a test of the party's future as their chairman Christian Lindner was also leading the party in that state. The party experienced a 4% swing in its favour gaining 6 seats and entering into a coalition with the CDU with a bare majority. In the [[2017 Saarland state election]] the party again failed to gain any seats despite a 1% swing in their favour. The party gained 3 seats and increased its vote share by 3.2% in the [[2017 Schleswig-Holstein state election]]. This success was often credited to their state chairman [[Wolfgang Kubicki]]. They also managed to re-enter the government under a [[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]].

In the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]] the party scored 10.7% of votes and re-entered the Bundestag, winning 80 seats.

The FDP won 5.4% and 5 seats in the [[2019 European Parliament election in Germany|2019 European elections]].

In the [[2019 Thuringian state election|October 2019 Thuringian state election]], the FDP won seats in the Landtag of [[Thuringia]] for the first time since 2009. It exceeded the 5% threshold by just 5 votes.<ref>[https://www.thelocal.de/20191028/five-extra-votes-put-free-democrats-in-thuringias-state-parliament How five votes put Germany's Free Democrats in Thuringia state parliament], ''The Local'' (28 October 2019).</ref> In February 2020, the FDP's [[Thomas Kemmerich]] was elected Minister-President of Thuringia by the Landtag with the likely support of the CDU and AfD, becoming the second member of the FDP to serve as head of government in a German state. This was also the first time a head of government had been elected with the support of AfD. Under intense pressure from state and federal politicians, Kemmerich resigned the following day, stating he would seek new elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51399445|title=Germany AfD: Thuringia PM quits amid fury over far right|publisher=BBC|date=8 February 2020}}</ref> The next month, he was replaced by Bodo Ramelow of The Left; the FDP did not run a candidate in the second vote for Minister-President.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-thuringia-gets-left-wing-state-premier-in-re-run-vote/|title=Germany's Thuringia gets left-wing state premier in re-run vote|date=4 March 2020}}</ref>

Donald Hancock et al., ''Politics in Europe'' (CQ Press, 2015), pp. 265-66.</ref> However, these positions have shifted in recent years.

During the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]], the party called for Germany to adopt an immigration channel using a Canada-style [[points-based immigration system]]; spend up to 3% of GDP on defense and international security; phase out the [[Taxation in Germany|solidarity surcharge tax]] (which was first levied in 1991 to pay for the costs of absorbing [[East Germany]] after [[German reunification]]); cut taxes by 30 billion [[euro]] (twice the amount of the tax cut proposed by the CDU); and improve road infrastructure by spending 2 billion euro annually for each of the next two decades, to be funded by selling government stakes in [[Deutsche Bahn]], [[Deutsche Telekom]], and [[Deutsche Post]].<ref>Joel Lewin, [https://www.ft.com/content/6d9e1814-8108-11e7-a4ce-15b2513cb3ff How the policies of Germany's political parties match up], ''Financial Times'' (August 28, 2017).</ref> The FDP also called for the improvement of Germany's digital infrastructure, the establishment of a Ministry of Digital Affairs, and greater investment in education.<ref name="Chase"/> The party also supports allowing [[dual citizenship]] (in contrast to the [[CDU-CSU]], which opposes it) but also supports requiring third-generation immigrants to select a single nationality.<ref name="Chase"/>

The FDP supports the [[Cannabis in Germany|legalization of cannabis in Germany]]<ref>[https://www.dw.com/en/germany-delays-roll-out-of-medical-marijuana/a-46872556 Germany delays roll-out of medical marijuana], [[Deutsche Welle]] (December 27, 2018).</ref><ref>Kathleen Schuster, [https://www.dw.com/cda/en/5-facts-about-cannabis-laws-in-germany/a-42709969 5 facts about cannabis laws in Germany], [[Deutsche Welle]] (March 10, 2018).</ref> and strongly opposes proposals to heighten [[Internet surveillance]].<ref name="Hancock"/>

==Support base==
The party tends to draw its support from professionals and self-employed Germans.<ref name="Biesinger">Joseph A.

George K. Romoser), p. 59.</ref>

The party's membership has historically been largely male; in 1995, less than one-third of the party's members were women, and in the 1980s women made up less than one-tenth of the party's national executive committee. By the 1990s, the percentage of women on the FDP's national executive committee rose to 20%.<ref>Miki Caul Kittilson, ''Challenging Parties, Changing Parliaments: Women and Elected Office in Contemporary Western Europe'' (Ohio State University Press, 2006), pp. 94-95.</ref>
