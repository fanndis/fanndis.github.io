Firtash was arrested by Austrian authorities in March 2014.

In 2017, the United States [[Justice Department]] described him as an "upper-echelon [associate] of Russian organized crime."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/doj-ex-manafort-associate-firtash-top-tier-comrade-russian-mobsters-n786806|title=DOJ: Ex-Manafort associate is top-tier comrade of Russian mobsters|website=NBC News}}</ref>

{{As of|2016|August|post=,}} Firtash has not returned to Ukraine following the [[Euromaidan|Maidan]] revolution of 2014.

==Early life==
Firtash was born on 2 May 1965 in Bohdanivka, [[Zalishchiky Raion]] ([[Ternopil Oblast]]), [[Ukraine]], [[Soviet Union]]. His father Vasily ({{lang-uk|Василь}}) was a driver and his mother Maria Grigorovna ({{lang-uk|Марія Григорівна}}) had two degrees (economics and veterinary medicine) and worked at a livestock farm and then a sugar mill as an accountant.<ref name="bbcuk2006">{{cite news |title=Дмитро Фірташ дав перше інтерв'ю |url=https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/news/story/2006/04/060428_firtash_interview_ak.shtml |accessdate=21 November 2019 |work=www.bbc.com |publisher=BBC Ukrainian |date=28 April 2006 |language=uk}}</ref> Since the 1990s, the village has been called Synkiv.

==Business career and assets==
Firtash began his business career almost immediately after completing his military service. He founded a trading company in [[Chernivtsi]], Ukraine, eventually moving to Moscow in the early 1990s.

In 2007, a private international group of companies, [[Group DF]] ("the Firtash group of companies") was formed to consolidate Firtash's business assets in different sectors. Presently, Group DF incorporates assets in the chemical industry, energy sector and real estate, and this consolidation effort is still underway.

In 2008, Firtash was involved with a firm owned by [[Paul Manafort]] in a $895&nbsp;million project to redevelop the [[Drake Hotel (New York City)|Drake Hotel]] in New York City into a spa and luxury mall to be called Bulgari Tower. According to court records, Firtash's firm had planned to invest $100&nbsp;million in the project.<ref name="NBC News">{{cite news|last1=Winter|first1=Tom|last2=Dilanian|first2=Ken|title=Trump aide Paul Manafort's ties to Russia described as 'deeply disturbing'|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/donald-trump-aide-paul-manafort-scrutinized-russian-business-ties-n631241|work=NBC News|date=18 August 2016|language=en}}</ref> The deal was never finalized.<ref name="Chicago Tribune">{{cite news|last1=Janssen|first1=Kim|title=Ukrainian oligarch with ties to Trump campaign fighting extradition to Chicago|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chicagoinc/ct-trump-manafort-firtash-0802-chicago-inc-20160801-story.html|work=Chicago Tribune|date=1 August 2016}}</ref>

In 2010, Firtash launched an effort towards consolidation of the Ukrainian nitrogen business. From September 2010 to September 2011, Firtash acquired ownership in 'Concern STIROL' ([[Horlivka]]), 'Severodonetsk Production Association Azot' and 'Cherkassy Azot'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0c4d6038-451e-11e0-80e7-00144feab49a?_i_location=http:%252/www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0c4d6038-451e-11e0-80e7-00144feab49a.html&_i_referer=http://yandex.ua/yandsearch?text=Firtash+acquired+Cherkassy+azot&clid=48648&lr=143&tld=ua|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref> In just over a year, the joint marketing strategy of the four fertilizer manufacturers owned by Firtash substantially strengthened its domestic market position.

==Business development initiatives==
[[File:Dmytro Firtash.jpg|thumb|left|Firtash united Ukrainian employers]]
Firtash unified the employers' organizations of Ukraine into a single powerful association, the [[Federation of Employers of Ukraine]] (FEU), which he presided over from November 2011 to September 2016. The FEU membership includes companies and enterprises collectively generating 70 percent of Ukraine's GDP.

In spring 2002, Firtash ran for parliament as a member of the all-Ukrainian political association [[Women for the Future]], under the patronage of Lyudmila Kuchma, a wife of Ukrainian President [[Leonid Kuchma]].

Since 2011, they have been at odds on questions of public policy. In 2011, Firtash said that Yushchenko had planned good reforms, but Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] had not allowed him to implement them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27213404| work=BBC News |title=Profile: Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash| date=30 April 2014}}</ref>

In March 2014, on behalf of the business circles of Ukraine, Firtash addressed Aleksandr Shokhin, the Head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and the wider business community concerning the situation in the political arena and urged Russian businessmen to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dt.ua/UKRAINE/firtash-zaklikav-rosiyskih-biznesmeniv-zupiniti-viynu-mizh-rosiyeyu-ta-ukrayinoyu-138753_.html|title=Фірташ закликав російських бізнесменів зупинити війну між Росією та Україною|website=DT.ua}}</ref>

On 3 April 2014, Firtash announced that he hoped the [[2014 Ukrainian presidential election|forthcoming presidential elections]] would overcome the chaos in Ukraine and strengthen the country on the international political scene. He said: "I will not allow for my reputation to be ruined by those who are driven by political motivations and are not interested in Ukraine and its people".<ref>[http://molbuk.ua/ukraine/71550-ya-opynyvsya-v-epicentri-protystoyannya-ssha-i-rosiyi-firtash.html "Я опинився в епіцентрі протистояння США і Росії", – Фірташ].

In an interview given to the BBC in May 2014, Firtash protested his innocence, denied paying bribes and any links to organized crime. He reiterated his belief that he is a pawn in the geo-political struggle between the United States and Russia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27235510|title=Dmytro Firtash breaks silence to protest his innocence|last=Galpin|first=Richard|date=1 May 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=2 November 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In May 2014, Firtash also stated that Ukraine must be strong, neutral and independent. He also pointed out that the top priority faced by Ukraine is to legitimize the government, which can only become a possibility after having the elections.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In September 2016, after serving as president of the FEU for five years, Firtash resigned the position of the FEU President.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fru.ua/en/events/fru-events/federatsiia-robotodavtsiv-ukrainy-obrala-nove-kerivnytstvo|title=A new leadership of the Federation of Employers of Ukraine elected|last=FRU|website=fru.ua|accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref>

===Involvement in Trump-Ukraine scandal===
{{Trump–Ukraine scandal}}
{{See also|Trump-Ukraine scandal}}
Living in Vienna, Austria, since 2014 Firtash has been resisting extradition to the United States on bribery and racketeering charges, and has sought to have the charges dropped. Firtash's attorneys obtained a September 2019 statement from [[Viktor Shokin]], the former Ukrainian prosecutor general who was forced out under pressure from multiple countries and non-governmental organizations, as conveyed to Ukraine by then-vice president [[Joe Biden]]. Shokin asserted in the statement that Biden actually had him fired because he refused to stop his investigation into [[Burisma]], a Ukrainian energy firm that employed Biden's son. President Donald Trump's personal attorney, [[Rudy Giuliani]], who asserts he has "nothing to do with Firtash," has promoted the statement in television appearances as purported evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.

Firtash is represented by Trump and Giuliani associates [[Joseph diGenova]] and his wife [[Victoria Toensing]], having hired them on the recommendation of Giuliani associate [[Lev Parnas]]. ''The New York Times'' reported in November that Giuliani had directed Parnas to approach Firtash with the recommendation, with the proposition that Firtash could help to provide compromising information on Biden, which Parnas's attorney described was "part of any potential resolution to [Firtash's] extradition matter."<ref name="auto4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/us/giuliani-ukraine-oligarchs.html|title=Why Giuliani Singled Out 2 Ukrainian Oligarchs to Help Look for Dirt|first1=Jo|last1=Becker|first2=Walt|last2=Bogdanich|first3=Maggie|last3=Haberman|first4=Ben|last4=Protess|date=November 25, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Shokin's statement notes that it was prepared "at the request of lawyers acting for Dmitry Firtash."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/ukrainian-oligarch-firtash-linked-giuliani-pals-gas-deals-biden-dirt-n1067516 |title=Oligarch Firtash linked to Giuliani pals' gas deals and Biden research |work=NBC News |first=Ken |last=Dilanian |first2=Dan |last2=De Luce |first3=Tom |last3=Winter |date=October 16, 2019 |accessdate=October 18, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://time.com/5699201/exclusive-how-a-ukrainian-oligarch-wanted-by-u-s-authorities-helped-giuliani-attack-biden/ |first=Simon |last=Shuster |date=October 15, 2019 |title=Exclusive: How a Ukrainian Oligarch Wanted by U.S. Authorities Helped Giuliani Attack Biden |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=October 18, 2019 }}</ref> ''Bloomberg News'' reported on October 18 that during the summer of 2019 Firtash associates began attempting to dig up dirt on the Bidens in an effort to solicit Giuliani's assistance with Firtash's legal matters, as well as hiring diGenova and Toensing in July.

Judge Leo Levnaic-Iwanski noted that U.S. authorities had provided additional documentation since the lower court had ruled against them. Firtash faces up to 50 years in prison and the seizure of all his assets. Immediately following the verdict, Firtash was arrested on a Spanish arrest warrant related to charges of money laundering.<ref>{{cite news|title=Austrian Court Backs Extradition of Ukraine Businessman Firtash to U.S.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/02/21/world/europe/21reuters-ukraine-firtash.html |accessdate=22 February 2017|work=New York Times|agency=Reuters|date=22 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/extradition-hearing-dmytro-firtash-starts-vienna-court-appeals-update.html|title=Austrian appeals court grants US request to extradite Firtash |date=21 February 2017|newspaper=KyivPost|access-date=21 February 2017}}</ref>

====Detention on Spanish and American orders====
Vienna's Higher Regional Court issued its decision on 19 December, citing insufficient documentation linking Firtash to alleged money laundering and organized crime. A court in Vienna has decided against extraditing Ukrainian oligarch Dymitro Firtash from Austria to Spain, saying Madrid had not provided enough proof linking Firtash to alleged crimes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/vienna-court-rejects-spain-extradition-request-ukrainian-oligarch-firtash/28928162.html|title=Vienna Court Rejects Spain's Extradition Request For Ukrainian Oligarch Firtash|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref>

On 21 February 2017, a few minutes after the announcement of the High Court's decision, Austrian police detained Firtash at the courthouse on the basis of an EU arrest warrant issued by Spain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/21/austria-grants-us-request-to-extradite-ukrainian-mogul-dmytro-firtash|title=Ukrainian businessman Dmytro Firtash arrested after extradition ruling|last=Walker|first=Shaun|date=21 February 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=2 November 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The Spanish warrant was issued as part of an investigation into money laundering. The prosecutor's office in Vienna detained Firtash for 48 hours to determine its course of action.

On 23 February, Firtash was released from custody on the {{Euro|125}}&nbsp;million bail deposited in 2014. However, that same day he was arrested and held in custody in connection with the U.S. extradition request.

On 24 February, Vienna Regional Court dismissed the Vienna prosecutor's application to impose provisional detention pending surrender regarding the U.S. extradition case. The question where Firtash was to be extradited – to Spain or the United States – is in the jurisdiction of the Minister of Justice of Austria, Wolfgang Brandstetter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39043117|title=Ukraine oligarch faces extradition to US|date=21 February 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=2 November 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In early September 2017, Yevhen Yenin, Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine, noted that Firtash's return to the Ukraine was "an unrealistic event". Proceedings to hear extradition cases from the United States and Spain would be lengthy. Yenin also noted, "there is a political side to the case. If we consider the level of Firtash's defense, it includes Austria's former justice minister."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/general-prosecutors-office-says-firtashs-imminent-return-ukraine-unlikely.html|title=General Prosecutor’s Office says Firtash's imminent return to Ukraine unlikely – Sep. 04, 2017|date=4 September 2017|work=KyivPost|access-date=2 November 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

In September, anti-corruption groups including Human Rights Watch, proposed that Firtash be placed on the [[Magnitsky Act|Magnitsky List]] and sanctioned by the United States government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/rights-anti-corruption-groups-propose-placing-firtash-magnitsky-list.html|title=Rights, anti-corruption groups propose placing Firtash on Magnitsky List – Sep. 15, 2017|date=15 September 2017|work=KyivPost|access-date=2 November 2017|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-rights-magnitsky/rights-groups-target-police-spy-chiefs-globally-under-new-u-s-law-idUSKCN1BO126|title=Rights groups target police, spy chiefs globally under new U.S. law|date=13 September 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=2 November 2017}}</ref>
