==Campaign history==
The campaign began in March 2001 on recommendation from over seventy experts on the health of women.<ref name="ht"/> The research stressed the need to communicate to women about the risk of heart disease, and endorsed The Heart Truth as a means of doing so.<ref name="ht"/>

==Logo and marketing==
The [[logo]] of the campaign is a red dress. It came into being as a way to attract attention to The Heart Truth, and eliminate perceptions that heart disease is an issue only for men.<ref name="ht"/> The dress reminds women to focus on their "outerselves", as well as their "innerselves", especially heart health.<ref name="ht"/>

The campaign has also conjured a [[National Wear Red Day]], meant to take place on the first Friday of February annually.<ref name="ht"/>
