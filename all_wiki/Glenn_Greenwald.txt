'''Glenn Edward Greenwald'''<ref name="SltZJ" /> (born March 6, 1967) is an American journalist, author, and former attorney.

After graduating from law school in 1994, Greenwald worked as a corporate lawyer, before founding his own civil rights and constitutional law firm in 1996. In the course of nearly a decade of litigation, Greenwald represented a number of controversial clients in [[First Amendment]] cases, including individuals and organizations affiliated with [[neo-Nazism]]. Greenwald has commented about how the example of the [[ACLU]], which famously defended the rights of neo-Nazis to [[National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie|march in Skokie, IL]], inspired him to defend the free speech rights of persons and causes he considered odious.

Following the attacks of [[9/11 terror attack|September 11th 2001]], Greenwald initially supported the Bush Administration's [[War on Terror]], and was a supporter of Bush's decision to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invade Iraq]] in 2003.<ref>[Preface]. (2006). In G. Greenwald (Author), ''How would a patriot act?: Defending American values from a president run amok''. San Francisco: Working Assets Publishing.</ref> By late 2005, Greenwald had changed his position on the war, and was also increasingly concerned by what he perceived to be the Administration's attack on civil liberties. He has subsequently taken a consistently critical stance on American foreign policy in the Middle East and around the world. 

Greenwald began blogging on national security issues in October 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2007-06-20|title=Fringe liberal bloggers|url=https://www.salon.com/2007/06/20/liberalism/|access-date=2020-09-27|website=Salon|language=en|archive-date=December 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223043026/https://www.salon.com/2007/06/20/liberalism/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="zir8P"/> He then contributed to ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''. In June 2013, while at ''The Guardian'', he began publishing a series of reports detailing previously unknown information about American and British [[global surveillance]] programs based on classified documents provided by [[Edward Snowden]]. Along with other reporters, Greenwald won both a [[George Polk Awards|George Polk Award]] and a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for the reporting. He has also written best-selling books, including ''[[No Place to Hide (Greenwald book)|No Place to Hide]]''. In 2014, he, [[Laura Poitras]] and [[Jeremy Scahill]], launched ''[[The Intercept]]'', for which he was co-founding editor until he resigned in October 2020.

==Early life==
Greenwald was born in New York City to Arlene and Daniel Greenwald.<ref name="lnKno" /> Greenwald's family moved to [[Lauderdale Lakes, Florida]] when he was an infant.<ref name="SalonProfile" /><ref name="GreenwaldResponse" /><ref name="Buzzfeed" /> His parents are [[Jewish]] and they and his grandparents tried to introduce him to Judaism, but he grew up without practicing an organized religion, did not have a [[bar mitzvah]], and has said his "moral precepts aren't informed in any way by religious doctrine".<ref name="mxPKN" /> Greenwald attended Nova Middle School and [[Nova High School]] in [[Davie, Florida]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Herrera |first1=Chabeli |title=Columnist who broke NSA leaks story grew up in Lauderdale Lakes |url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article1953011.html |accessdate=18 November 2020 |work=Miami Herald |date=July 4, 2013}}</ref> He received a BA in philosophy from [[George Washington University]] in 1990 and a JD from [[New York University School of Law]] in 1994.<ref name="SalonProfile" /><ref name="Buzzfeed" />

==Career==

===Litigation attorney===
Greenwald practiced law in the litigation department at [[Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz]] from 1994 to 1995. In 1996, he co-founded his own litigation firm, Greenwald Christoph & Holland (later renamed Greenwald Christoph PC), where he litigated cases concerning issues of U.S. constitutional law and civil rights.<ref name="SalonProfile" /><ref name="GreenwaldResponse" /> He worked ''pro bono'' much of the time, and his cases included representing white supremacist [[Matthew F. Hale|Matthew Hale]] in Illinois and the neo-nazi [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]].<ref name="Wilentz">{{cite news|last=Wilentz|first=Sean|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/01/would-you-feel-differently-about-snowden-greenwald-and-assange-if-you-knew-what-the|title=Would you feel differently about Snowden, Greenwald, and Assange if you knew what they really thought?|work=New Statesman|date=January 20, 2014|access-date=April 26, 2019|archive-date=April 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426203909/https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/01/would-you-feel-differently-about-snowden-greenwald-and-assange-if-you-knew-what-the|url-status=live}}</ref>

About his work in First Amendment speech cases, Greenwald told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 2013, "to me, it's a heroic attribute to be so committed to a principle that you apply it not when it's easy ... not when it supports your position, not when it protects people you like, but when it defends and protects people that you hate".<ref name="SqbjS" />

Later, according to Greenwald, "I decided voluntarily to wind down my practice in 2005 because I could, and because, after ten years, I was bored with litigating full-time and wanted to do other things which I thought were more engaging and could make more of an impact, including political writing."<ref name="GreenwaldResponse" />

===''Unclaimed Territory'' and ''Salon''===
Greenwald initially supported the [[War on Terror]] and President George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq, but had become a staunch critic of the Administration's Iraq policy and policies concerning civil liberties by 2005.<ref>[Preface]. (2006). In G. Greenwald (Author), ''How would a patriot act?: Defending American values from a president run amok''. San Francisco: Working Assets Publishing.</ref> 

In October 2005, he began his [[blog]] ''Unclaimed Territory'' focusing on the investigation pertaining to the [[Plame affair]], the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]], the federal indictment of [[Scooter Libby]] and the [[NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)]] controversy. In April 2006, the blog received the 2005 Koufax Award for "Best New Blog".<ref name="SalonProfile" /> According to [[Sean Wilentz]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', Greenwald "seemed to take pride in attacking Republicans and Democrats alike".<ref name="Wilentz" />

In February 2007, Greenwald became a contributing writer for the ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' website, and the new column and blog superseded ''Unclaimed Territory'', although ''Salon'' featured hyperlinks to it in Greenwald's dedicated biographical section.<ref name="GreenwaldBlogNews" /><ref name="Singal" />

[[File:Noam, Amy & Glenn (5668932535).jpg|thumb|Greenwald, [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Amy Goodman]] in April 2011]]
Among the frequent topics of his ''Salon'' articles were the investigation of the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] and the candidacy of former CIA official [[John O. Brennan]] for the jobs of either [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]] (D/CIA) or the next [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI) after the election of [[Barack Obama]]. Brennan withdrew his name from consideration for the post after opposition centered in liberal blogs and led by Greenwald.<ref name="Ambinder" /><ref name="salon2008-11-16" /><ref name="EiuJ2" /><ref name="JGi1P" /><ref name="IHT" /><ref name="Hamsher" />

In a 2010 article for ''Salon'', Greenwald described [[U.S. Army]] Private [[Chelsea Manning]] as "a [[whistle-blower]] acting with the noblest of motives" and "a national hero similar to [[Daniel Ellsberg]]".<ref name="salon2010-06-18" /> In an article for ''[[The Raw Story]]'' published in 2011, Greenwald criticized the prison conditions in which Manning was held after her arrest by military authorities.<ref name="BMkGH" /> 

Greenwald was described by [[Rachel Maddow]] during his period writing for ''Salon'' as "the American left’s most fearless political commentator."<ref name="Wilentz" />

===''The Guardian''===
It was announced in July 2012 that Greenwald was joining the American wing of Britain's ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper, to contribute a weekly column and a daily blog.<ref name="Byers">{{cite news|last=Byers|first=Dylan|title=Glenn Greenwald to move to The Guardian|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/07/glenn-greenwald-to-move-to-the-guardian-129447.html|work=Politico|date=July 19, 2012|access-date=July 21, 2012|archive-date=July 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721173556/http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/07/glenn-greenwald-to-move-to-the-guardian-129447.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Carr2012">{{cite news|last=Carr|first=David|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/glenn-greenwald-moves-from-salon-to-guardian-u-s|title=Glenn Greenwald Moves From Salon to Guardian U.S|work=The New York Times|date=July 19, 2012|access-date=April 27, 2019|archive-date=September 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920164345/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/glenn-greenwald-moves-from-salon-to-guardian-u-s/|url-status=live}}</ref> Greenwald wrote on ''Salon'' that the move offered him "the opportunity to reach a new audience, to further internationalize my readership, and to be re-invigorated by a different environment" as reasons for the move.<ref name="Byers" /><ref name="Salon071912">{{cite news|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/07/19/home_news|title=I'll be writing in a new venue beginning next month|date=July 19, 2012|work=Salon.com|access-date=December 9, 2012|archive-date=January 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115133943/http://www.salon.com/2012/07/19/home_news/|url-status=live}}</ref>

On June 5, 2013, Greenwald reported on the [[Classified information in the United States#Top Secret|top-secret]] [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] order requiring [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] to provide the National Security Agency with telephone [[metadata]] for all calls between the U.S. and abroad, as well as all domestic calls.<ref name="greenwaldnsa" /><ref name="Bazelon" /><ref name="NYTglenn" />

On October 15, 2013, Greenwald announced, and ''The Guardian'' confirmed, that he was leaving the newspaper to pursue a "once-in-a-career dream journalistic opportunity that no journalist could possibly decline".<ref name="GreenGuard" /><ref name="WNA5x" />

===First Look Media and ''The Intercept''===
Financial backing for ''[[The Intercept]]'' was provided by [[eBay]] founder [[Pierre Omidyar]].<ref name="bxmMp" /><ref name="D2lcw" /> Omidyar told media critic [[Jay Rosen]] that the decision was fueled by his "rising concern about press freedoms in the United States and around the world". Greenwald, along with his colleagues [[Laura Poitras]] and [[Jeremy Scahill]], initially were working on creating a platform online to support independent journalism, when they were approached by Omidyar who was hoping to establish his own media organization. That news organization, [[First Look Media]], launched its first online publication, ''The Intercept'', on February 10, 2014.<ref name="TNW Intercept launch" /> Greenwald initially served as editor, alongside Poitras and Scahill. The organization is incorporated as a [[501(c)(3)]] tax-exempt charitable entity.<ref name="aboutfirstlook" /><ref name="rosen1" />

''The Intercept'' was in contact during the 2016 presidential campaign with [[Guccifer 2.0]], who relayed some of the material about [[Hillary Clinton]], gathered via a data breach, to Greenwald. The Grugq, a counterintelligence specialist, reported in October 2016: "''The Intercept'' was both aware that the e-mails were from Guccifer 2.0, that Guccifer 2.0 has been attributed to Russian intelligence services, and that there is significant public evidence supporting this attribution."<ref>{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=Sean|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/is-russia-using-journalists-as-weapons-does-it-matter/|title=Agents of influence: How reporters have been "weaponized" by leaks|work=Ars Technica|date=October 20, 2016|access-date=April 26, 2019|archive-date=April 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426182545/https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/is-russia-using-journalists-as-weapons-does-it-matter/|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to Simon van Zuylen-Wood writing for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine in early 2018, Greenwald has "repositioned himself as a bomb-throwing media critic" since the Snowden revelations.<ref name=":1" /> By 2019, he was serving as an ''Intercept'' columnist without any control over the site's news reporting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Perlberg|first=Steven|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/24/the-intercept-greenwald-grim-profile-media-politics-left-liberal-226710|title=How the Intercept Is Fueling the Democratic Civil War|work=Politico|date=April 24, 2019|access-date=April 25, 2019|archive-date=January 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200121205753/https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/24/the-intercept-greenwald-grim-profile-media-politics-left-liberal-226710|url-status=live}}</ref>

On October 29, 2020, Greenwald resigned from ''The Intercept'', giving his reasons as political censorship and contractual breaches by the editors, who he said had prevented him from reporting on [[Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory|allegations concerning Joe Biden's conduct with regard to China and Ukraine]] and had demanded that he not publish the article in any other publication.<ref name="TDB20201029">{{Cite news|last1=Tani|first1=Maxwell|last2=Baragona|first2=Justin|date=2020-10-29|title=Glenn Greenwald Resigns From The Intercept, Claims He Was Censored|language=en|work=The Daily Beast|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/glenn-greenwald-resigns-from-the-intercept-claims-he-was-censored|access-date=2020-10-29}}</ref> Betsy Reed, the editor-in-chief, disputed Greenwald's accusations and claims of censorship, and accused him of presenting dubious claims by the [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|Trump campaign]] as journalism.<ref name="TDB20201029" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Katie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/business/glenn-greenwald-leaving-intercept.html|title=Glenn Greenwald Leaves The Intercept, Claiming He Was Censored|work=The New York Times|date=October 29, 2020|access-date=October 29, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/intercept-staffers-roll-their-eyes-over-glenn-greenwalds-censorship-claim |title=Intercept Staffers Roll Their Eyes Over Glenn Greenwald's Censorship Claim |website=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=October 31, 2020 |first=Maxwell |last=Tani |access-date=October 31, 2020}}</ref> Greenwald said he would begin publishing his work on [[Substack]], and had begun "exploring the possibility of creating a new media outlet."<ref name="cnnwire">{{cite news |title=Claiming censorship, Greenwald leaves the Intercept |url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/10/29/claiming-censorship-greenwald-leaves-the-intercept/ |access-date=30 October 2020 |agency=CNN Wire Agency |work=The Mercury News |date=29 October 2020}}</ref><ref name="smh">{{cite news |last1=Barr |first1=Jeremy |last2=Izadi |first2=Elahe |title=Glenn Greenwald resigns from the Intercept following dispute over Biden story |url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/glenn-greenwald-resigns-from-the-intercept-following-dispute-over-biden-story-20201030-p56a30.html |access-date=30 October 2020 |work=Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> After resigning from ''The Intercept'', Greenwald published his article about Biden and his correspondence with the editors of ''The Intercept'' on his Substack page.<ref name="TDB20201029"/>

===Books===
Greenwald's first book, ''[[How Would a Patriot Act? Defending American Values From a President Run Amok]]'' was published by [[Working Assets]] in 2006. It was a [[New York Times bestseller list|''New York Times'' bestseller]],<ref name="xGLD6" /> and ranked No. 1 on [[Amazon.com]], both before its publication (due to orders based on attention from 'UT' readers and other bloggers) and for several days after its release, ending its first week at #293.<ref name="Garofoli" />

''[[A Tragic Legacy]]'', his next book, examined the presidency of [[George W. Bush]]. Published in hardback by [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown]] (a division of [[Random House]]) on June 26, 2007, and reprinted in a paperback edition by [[Three Rivers Press]] on April 8, 2008, it was a [[New York Times Best Seller|''New York Times'' Best Seller]]. ''Great American Hypocrites: Toppling the Big Myths of Republican Politics'', was also first published by Random House in April 2008.<ref name="salon2008-03-09" /><ref name="h59PA" /> ''With Liberty and Justice for Some: How the Law Is Used to Destroy Equality and Protect the Powerful'', was released by Metropolitan Books in October 2011 and ''[[No Place to Hide (Greenwald book)|No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State]]'', was released in May 2014.<ref name="macmillan" /> The latter work spent six weeks on ''The New York Times'' Best Seller list,<ref name="Q6B6x" /> and was named one of the ten Best Non-Fiction Books of 2014 by ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.<ref name="xpIk8" />

==Global surveillance disclosure==
{{main|2013 Global surveillance disclosure}}

===Contact with Edward Snowden===
[[File:Carl-von-Ossietzky-Medaille 2014-12-14 1.jpg|thumb|Snowden, Poitras, and Greenwald were the recipients of the 2014 Carl von Ossietzky medal.]]
Greenwald was initially contacted anonymously in late 2012 by [[Edward Snowden]], a former contractor for the U.S. [[National Security Agency]],<ref name="Maass" /> who said he held "sensitive documents" that he wished to share.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Greenwald found the measures that Snowden asked him to take to secure their communications too annoying to employ.<ref name="Maass" /> Snowden then contacted documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras about a month later in January 2013.<ref name="poitras-how" />

According to ''The Guardian'', Snowden was attracted to Greenwald and Poitras by a ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' article written by Greenwald detailing how Poitras' films had made her a "target of the government".<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref name="w1bAC" /> Greenwald began working with Snowden in either February<ref name="politico-journalist-spat" /> or in April, after Poitras asked Greenwald to meet her in New York City, at which point Snowden began providing documents to them both.<ref name="Maass" />

As part of the [[global surveillance disclosure]], the first of Snowden's documents were published on June 5, 2013, in ''The Guardian'' in an article by Greenwald. Greenwald said that Snowden's documents exposed the "scale of domestic surveillance under Obama".<ref name="vNPVI" />

The series on which Greenwald worked contributed to ''[[The Guardian]]'' (alongside ''[[The Washington Post]]'') winning the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] in 2014.<ref name="k12fN" /><ref name="pulitzer prize" />

Greenwald's work on the Snowden story was featured in the documentary ''[[Citizenfour]]'', which won the 2014 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]]. Greenwald appeared on-stage with director [[Laura Poitras]] and Snowden's girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, when the Oscar was given.<ref name="JuLsO" /> In the 2016 [[Oliver Stone]] feature film [[Snowden (film)|''Snowden'']], Greenwald was played by actor [[Zachary Quinto]].<ref name="Jafwv" />

===Testimony===

In a statement delivered before the [[National Congress of Brazil]] in early August 2013, Greenwald testified that the U.S. government had used [[counter-terrorism]] as a pretext for clandestine surveillance in order to compete with other countries in the "business, industrial and economic fields".<ref name="NNE7K" /><ref name="cun27" /><ref name="SiFF0" />

On December 18, 2013, Greenwald told the European Union's [[Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs]] that "most governments around the world are not only turning their backs on Edward Snowden but also on their ethical responsibilities".<ref name="4VDrU" /> Speaking via a video link, Greenwald said that, "It is the UK through their interception of underwater fibre optic cables, that is a primary threat to the privacy of [[Citizenship of the European Union|European citizens]] when it comes to their telephone and emails". In a statement given to the [[European Parliament]], Greenwald said:

{{quote|The ultimate goal of the NSA, along with its most loyal, one might say subservient junior partner the British agency [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] – when it comes to the reason why the system of suspicion of surveillance is being built and the objective of this system – is nothing less than the elimination of [[Right to privacy|individual privacy]] worldwide|Glenn Greenwald<ref name="tWGSN" />}}

==2019 Operation Car Wash Telegram chat leaks in Brazil==
{{main|Vaza Jato}}
{{Vaza Jato |expanded=all}}
On June 9, 2019, Greenwald and journalists from [[investigative journalism]] magazine ''[[The Intercept Brasil]]'' where he was an editor, [[Vaza Jato|released several messages]] exchanged via [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]] between members of the investigation team of [[Operation Car Wash]]. The messages implicated members of Brazil's [[judiciary system]] and of the [[Operação Lava-Jato]] taskforce, including former judge and [[Ministry of Justice and Public Security (Brazil)|Minister of Justice]] [[Sérgio Moro]], and lead prosecutor [[Deltan Dallagnol]], in the violation of legal and ethical procedures during the investigation, trial and arrest of former president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], with the alleged objective of preventing him from running for a third term in the [[2018 Brazilian general election]], among other crimes. Following the leak, ''[[Folha de São Paulo]]'' and ''[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]'' confirmed the authenticity of the messages and worked in partnership with ''The Intercept Brasil'' to sort the remaining material in their possession before releasing it.<ref>Release Nickname Sources:

On July 23, [[Brazilian Federal Police]] announced that they had arrested and were investigating [[Araraquara]] [[hacker]] Walter Delgatti Neto for breaking into the authorities' Telegram accounts. Neto confessed to the hack and to having given copies of the [[chat log]]s to Greenwald. Police said the attack had been accomplished by abusing Telegram's phone number verification and exploiting vulnerabilities in [[voicemail]] technology in use in Brazil by using a spoofed phone number. ''The Intercept'' neither confirmed nor denied Neto being their source, citing [[freedom of the press]] provisions of the 1988 [[Brazilian Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Entenda o vazamento de diálogos da Lava-Jato |url=https://www.nsctotal.com.br/noticias/entenda-o-vazamento-de-dialogos-da-lava-jato |website=www.nsctotal.com.br |publisher=NSCTotal |access-date=August 13, 2019 |language=pt-BR |archive-date=August 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190813205427/https://www.nsctotal.com.br/noticias/entenda-o-vazamento-de-dialogos-da-lava-jato |url-status=live }}</ref>

In reporting on retaliation against Greenwald from the Bolsonaro government and its supporters, ''The Guardian'' said the articles published by Greenwald and ''The Intercept'' "have had an explosive impact on Brazilian politics and dominated headlines for weeks", adding that the exposés "appeared to show prosecutors in the sweeping Operation Car Wash corruption inquiry colluding with Sérgio Moro, the judge who became a hero in Brazil for jailing powerful businessmen, middlemen and politicians."<ref>{{cite news|title=Outcry after reports Brazil plans to investigate Glenn Greenwald|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/brazil-glenn-greenwald-investigation-outcry-bar-association-journalists|agency=The Guardian|date=July 3, 2019|access-date=August 11, 2019|archive-date=August 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190811001356/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/brazil-glenn-greenwald-investigation-outcry-bar-association-journalists|url-status=live}}</ref>

In November 2019, Brazilian columnist Augusto Nunes physically attacked Greenwald during a joint appearance on a Brazilian radio program. Immediately prior to the attack, Nunes had argued that a family judge ought to take away Greenwald's adopted children, prompting Greenwald to call him a "coward." Two of Jair Bolsonaro's sons praised Nunes' actions, while former presidential candidate [[Ciro Gomes]] defended Greenwald.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kaiser |first1=Anna Jean |title=Right-Wing Columnist Smacks Journalist Glenn Greenwald on Brazil Radio Show |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/07/glenn-greenwald-brazil-augusto-nunes-radio-show |access-date=June 28, 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=November 7, 2019 |archive-date=July 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200701130055/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/07/glenn-greenwald-brazil-augusto-nunes-radio-show |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Political views==
===United States===
====George W. Bush and Barack Obama eras====
[[File:Greenwald and Miranda at Congress.jpg|thumb|Miranda and Greenwald speak at the [[National Congress of Brazil]] in the wake of the [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures]].]]
Greenwald is critical of actions jointly supported by Democrats and Republicans, writing in 2010: "The worst and most tyrannical government actions in Washington are equally supported on a fully bipartisan basis."<ref name="salon2010-12-14" /> In the preface to his first book, ''[[How Would a Patriot Act?]]'' (2006), Greenwald described his 'pre-political' self as neither [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] nor [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] as a whole, voting neither for [[George W. Bush]] nor for any of his rivals (indeed, not voting at all).<ref name="GreenwaldPref" />

Bush's election to the U.S. presidency "changed" Greenwald's previous uninvolved political attitude toward the electoral process "completely", and in 2006 he wrote:

<blockquote>"Over the past five years, a creeping extremism has taken hold of our federal government, and it is threatening to radically alter our system of government and who we are as a nation. This extremism is neither conservative nor liberal in nature, but is instead driven by theories of unlimited presidential power that are wholly alien, and antithetical, to the core political values that have governed this country since its founding"; for, "the fact that this seizure of ever-expanding presidential power is largely justified through endless, rank fear-mongering—fear of terrorists, specifically—means that not only our system of government is radically changing, but so, too, are our national character, our national identity, and what it means to be American."<ref name="GreenwaldPref" /></blockquote>

Believing that "It is incumbent upon all Americans who believe in that system, bequeathed to us by the founders, to defend it when it is under assault and in jeopardy. And today it is", he said: "I did not arrive at these conclusions eagerly or because I was predisposed by any previous partisan viewpoint. Quite the contrary."<ref name="GreenwaldPref" />

Resistant to applying ideological labels to himself, he emphasized that he is a strong advocate for U.S. [[Constitutional law|constitutional]] "balance of powers"<ref name="Rechecking" /> and for constitutionally protected [[civil and political rights]] in his writings and public appearances.<ref name="SalonProfile" />

Greenwald frequently writes about the [[War on Drugs]] and criminal justice reform. He is a member of the advisory board of the Brazil chapter of [[Law Enforcement Action Partnership]].<ref name="leap" /><ref name="leaptweet" /> Greenwald was also the author of a 2009 [[white paper]] published by the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] ''[[Cato Institute]]'' entitled, ''Drug Decriminalization in Portugal: Lessons for Creating Fair and Successful Drug Policies'', exploring the role of [[drug policy of Portugal]].<ref name="cato" />

He criticized the policies of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] and those who supported it, arguing that most of the American [[news media|"Corporate News Media"]] excused Bush's policies and echoed the administration's positions rather than asking hard questions.<ref name="Goodman" /><ref name="Silverstein" /> Greenwald accused mainstream U.S. media of "spreading patriotic state propaganda".<ref name="YjV8z" />

Regarding civil liberties during the Obama presidency, he elaborated on his conception of change when he said, "I think the only means of true political change will come from people working outside of that [two-party electoral] system to undermine it, and subvert it, and weaken it, and destroy it; not try to work within it to change it."<ref name="ISO2011-07-03" /> He raised money for [[Russ Feingold]]'s 2010 Senate re-election bid,<ref name="eOq1b" /> [[Bill Halter]]'s 2010 primary challenge to Democratic [[Blanche Lincoln|Sen. Blanche Lincoln]],<ref name="qjQ3x" /> as well as several Congressional candidates in 2012 described as "unique".<ref name="ThreeChallengers" />

According to Greenwald, the emergence of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] is a direct consequence of the [[Iraq War]] and NATO-led [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention in Libya]].<ref name="r3yqd" /><ref name="JUfmX" /><ref name="Bjcuo" /> Greenwald has been critical of U.S. and UK involvement in the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]].<ref name="W980C" /> He wrote in October 2016: "The atrocities committed by the Saudis would have been impossible without their steadfast, aggressive support."<ref name="9Zju7" />

====Donald Trump and Russian election interference====
Greenwald has criticized some of the policies of the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]].<ref name="H3qUp" /><ref name="slate" /> He said: "I think the Trump White House lies more often. I think it lies more readily. I think it lies more blatantly."<ref name="slate" />

During the Trump administration Greenwald became a prominent critic of the Democratic Party, alleging a double standard in their foreign policy. He said that "Democrats didn't care when Obama hugged [[House of Saud|Saudi despots]], and now they pretend to care when Trump embraces Saudi despots or [[Hosni Mubarak|Egyptian ones]]."<ref name="slate" /> Greenwald said that choosing between Trump and "whatever you want to call it. Call it the [[deep state in the United States|deep state]], call it the national security blob, call it the [[CIA]] and the Pentagon", is like choosing between "Bashar al-Assad or al-Qaida or ISIS [in Syria] once the ordinary people of the Syrian revolution got defeated."<ref name="slate" />

He expressed skepticism of the [[James Clapper]]-led US intelligence community's assessment that [[Russia]]'s government [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interfered in the 2016 presidential election]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name="slate" /> Regardless of the accuracy of the assessment, Greenwald has doubted its significance,<ref name=":1" /> stating "This is stuff we do to them, and have done to them for decades, and still continue to do."<ref name="slate" /> In December 2018, he said: "I do regard the [[Robert Mueller|Mueller]] indictment as some evidence, not conclusive, but at least some evidence finally that the Russians are involved, but that doesn’t say the extent to which Putin was involved, let alone the extent to which Trump officials are criminally implicated."<ref name="NYobserver">{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Davis|title=Glenn Greenwald on Sucker Journalists—and Why There's No Silver Bullet Coming for Trump|url=https://observer.com/2018/12/glenn-greenwald-on-sucker-journalists-and-why-theres-no-silver-bullet-coming-for-trump/|work=[[The New York Observer]]|date=December 20, 2018|access-date=May 28, 2019|archive-date=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520034959/https://observer.com/2018/12/glenn-greenwald-on-sucker-journalists-and-why-theres-no-silver-bullet-coming-for-trump/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Greenwald sees Democrats' rhetoric on Russia as a more serious problem, characterizing it as "unhinged". According to Greenwald, "the effect is a constant ratcheting up of tensions between two [[list of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear-armed powers]] whose nuclear systems are still on hair-trigger alert and capable of catastrophic responses based on misunderstanding and misperception."<ref>{{cite news |title=Russia Hysteria Infects ''WashPost'' Again: False Story About Hacking U.S. Electric Grid |url=https://theintercept.com/2016/12/31/russia-hysteria-infects-washpost-again-false-story-about-hacking-u-s-electric-grid/ |work=The Intercept |date=December 31, 2016 |access-date=April 10, 2019 |archive-date=April 10, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410100306/https://theintercept.com/2016/12/31/russia-hysteria-infects-washpost-again-false-story-about-hacking-u-s-electric-grid/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Greenwald also wrote that the "East Coast newsmagazines" are "feeding Democrats the often [[xenophobia|xenophobic]], hysterical Russophobia for which they have a seemingly insatiable craving."<ref name="bR4l3" /> During a July 2018 panel on "fake news" held by Russian government outlet [[RT (TV network)|RT]] in Moscow and hosted by editor-in-chief [[Margarita Simonyan]], Greenwald argued that the Democrats' focus on Russian interference in the 2016 election is motivated by a need to rationalize Clinton's loss.<ref name="qUqBm" /><ref name="eNdVg" /> He told ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in August 2018 "'Let’s just get along with the Russians' has been turned into something treasonous". Of Trump, he commented: "Even if he has weird dealings with Russia, I still think it’s in everybody’s interest not to teach an entire new generation of people, becoming interested in politics for the first time, that the Russians are demons." He said that both Trump and [[Jill Stein]] were being "vilified for advocating ways to reduce U.S./Russian tensions" and told ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' that the [[2018 Russia–United States summit|Putin–Trump summit]] in Helsinki in July 2018 was an "excellent idea" because "90 percent of the world’s [[nuclear weapon]]s are in the hands of two countries—the United States and Russia—and having them speak and get along is much better than having them isolate one another and increase the risk of not just intentional conflict, but misperception and miscommunication".<ref>{{cite news |title=Debate: Is Trump-Putin Summit a "Danger to America" or Crucial Diplomacy Between Nuclear Powers? |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/7/16/debate_is_trump_putin_summit_a_danger |work=Democracy Now! |date=July 16, 2018 |access-date=August 23, 2019 |archive-date=August 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819093030/https://www.democracynow.org/2018/7/16/debate_is_trump_putin_summit_a_danger |url-status=live }}</ref>

Susan Hennessey, an NSA lawyer at the time of Snowden's NSA revelations, told [[Marcy Wheeler]] writing for ''[[The New Republic]]'' in January 2018, that Greenwald was only relaying "surface commentary" rather than evidence for or against Russian interference in the 2016 election.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wheeler|first=Marcy|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/146725/glenn-greenwalds-women|title=All Glenn Greenwald's Women|work=The New Republic|date=January 23, 2018|access-date=April 27, 2019|archive-date=April 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427070532/https://newrepublic.com/article/146725/glenn-greenwalds-women|url-status=live}}</ref> Tamsin Shaw wrote in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' in September 2018: "Greenwald has repeatedly, in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, decried as Russophobia the findings that Putin ordered interference in the 2016 US presidential election".<ref>{{cite news|last=Shaw|first=Tamsin|url=https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/09/13/edward-snowden-reconsidered/|title=Edward Snowden Reconsidered|work=The New York Review of Books|date=September 13, 2018|access-date=April 26, 2019|archive-date=April 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426191141/https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/09/13/edward-snowden-reconsidered/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Greenwald remained doubtful of assertions that the Trump presidential campaign worked with the Russians after the release of the letter about the Mueller's findings from attorney general [[William Barr]] in late March 2019.

In an exchange with Greenwald in February 2019, Rep.

In April 2019, Greenwald condemned the [[indictment and arrest of Julian Assange|arrest of Julian Assange]], tweeting: "If you're a US media star who has spent 2 years claiming to be so concerned about press freedoms over Trump's mean tweets about your friends, but don't raise your voice in protest over this grave attack on press freedom, take a hard look in the mirror."<ref>{{cite news |title=Greenwald Rips Media for Not Condemning Assange Arrest |url=https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/hypocrisy-glenn-greenwald-julian-assange-freedom-of-the-press/2019/04/11/id/911380/ |work=Newsmax |date=April 11, 2019 |access-date=May 28, 2019 |archive-date=May 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528104834/https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/hypocrisy-glenn-greenwald-julian-assange-freedom-of-the-press/2019/04/11/id/911380/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Greenwald criticized the government's decision to charge Assange under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] for his role in the 2010 publication of the [[Iraq War documents leak]].

===Jair Bolsonaro===
In October 2018, Greenwald said that Bolsonaro was "often depicted wrongly in the Western media as being Brazil's [[Donald Trump|Trump]], and he's actually much closer to say Filipino President [[Rodrigo Duterte|Duterte]] or even the Egyptian dictator General [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi|el-Sisi]] in terms of what he believes and what he's probably capable of carrying out."<ref>{{cite news |title=Jair Bolsonaro supports dictatorships and torture — and he'll probably be Brazil's next president |url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/episode-413-canada-s-forests-at-risk-the-politics-of-rage-canada-s-spookiest-places-eden-robinson-and-more-1.4878598/jair-bolsonaro-supports-dictatorships-and-torture-and-he-ll-probably-be-brazil-s-next-president-1.4878611 |publisher=CBC News |date=October 27, 2018 |access-date=April 10, 2019 |archive-date=April 10, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410112325/https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/episode-413-canada-s-forests-at-risk-the-politics-of-rage-canada-s-spookiest-places-eden-robinson-and-more-1.4878598/jair-bolsonaro-supports-dictatorships-and-torture-and-he-ll-probably-be-brazil-s-next-president-1.4878611 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Greenwald said that Bolsonaro could be a "good partner" for President Trump "If you think that the U.S. should go back to kind of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] as [National Security Adviser] [[John R.

Greenwald has faced death threats and homophobic harassment from Bolsonaro supporters due to his reporting on leaked [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]] messages about Brazil's [[Operation Car Wash]] and Bolsonaro's justice minister [[Sérgio Moro]].<ref name="apnews.com"/> President Bolsonaro threatened Greenwald with possible imprisonment.

In January 2020, Brazilian federal prosecutors charged Greenwald with cybercrimes, alleging he was part of a "criminal organization" that hacked into the cellphones of prosecutors and other public officials in 2019. Prosecutors said he played a "clear role in facilitating the commission of a crime" by, for example, encouraging hackers to delete archives in order to cover their tracks. Greenwald, who was not detained, called the charges "an obvious attempt to attack a free press in retaliation for the revelations we reported about Minister of Justice Sérgio Moro and the Bolsonaro government."<ref name="NYTimes2020-01-21">{{cite news |last1=Londoño |first1=Ernesto |last2=Casado |first2=Letícia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/world/americas/glenn-greenwald-brazil-cybercrimes.html |title=Glenn Greenwald Charged With Cybercrimes in Brazil |work=The New York Times |date=January 21, 2020 |access-date=January 21, 2020 |archive-date=January 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200121154004/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/world/americas/glenn-greenwald-brazil-cybercrimes.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In February 2020, a federal judge dismissed the charges against Greenwald, citing a ruling from Supreme Court justice Gilmar Mendes that shielded him.<ref name="NYT6Feb2020">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/americas/greenwald-charges-dropped-brazil.html | title=Brazil Judge Dismisses Charges Against the Journalist Glenn Greenwald | work=The New York Times | date=February 6, 2020 | access-date=February 6, 2020 | author=Londoño, Ernesto | archive-date=February 7, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200207005016/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/americas/greenwald-charges-dropped-brazil.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

==Reception==
Greenwald has been placed on numerous "top 50" and "top 25" lists of columnists in the United States.{{refn|<ref name="Forbes" /><ref name="Hasan" /><ref name="Amira" /><ref name="Mediaite" /><ref name="Krugman" /><ref name="Technorati" /><ref name="FAQAuthority" /><ref name="The Atlantic Wire" /><ref name="tseJt" />}} In June 2012, ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine named him one of America's Top Ten Opinionists, saying that "a righteous, controlled, and razor-sharp fury runs through a great deal" of his writing, and: "His independent persuasion can make him a danger or an asset to both sides of the aisle."<ref name="rCC4L" />

[[File:Glenn Greenwald 2.JPG|thumb|Greenwald in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, September 2014]]
According to Nate Anderson, writing in ''[[Ars Technica]]'' around 2010 or 2011, [[Aaron Barr]] of [[HBGary]] and Team Themis planned to damage Greenwald's career in response to a potential dump of [[Bank of America]] documents by WikiLeaks, saying that "Without the support of people like Glenn WikiLeaks would fold."<ref name="tA4Re" />

[[Josh Voorhees]], writing for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', reported that in 2013 congressman [[Peter T. King|Peter King]] (R-NY) suggested Greenwald should be arrested for his reporting on the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|NSA PRISM program]] and NSA leaker Edward Snowden.<ref name="UiVBX" /> Journalist [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]] said "I would arrest <nowiki>[</nowiki>Snowden<nowiki>]</nowiki> and now I'd almost arrest Glenn Greenwald",<ref name="dd49I" /> but later made an apology for his statement, which Greenwald accepted.

Journalist [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] accused Greenwald of [[aiding and abetting]] Snowden, before asking, "Why shouldn't you, Mr. Greenwald, be charged with a crime?"<ref name="mBLR4" />

In a 2013 interview with [[Martha Raddatz]] of [[ABC News]], Greenwald said that members of Congress are not being told "the most basic information about what NSA is doing  and spying on American citizens and what the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] court has been doing in terms of declaring some of some of this illegal, some of it legal."<ref name="ABC2013">{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-gen-martin-dempsey-reps-ruppersberger-king/story?id=19864913|title=This Week' Transcript: Gen.

[[Dutch Ruppersberger]] (D-MD), who at the time was the ranking member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] ("House Intelligence Committee"). He responded: "We have rules as far as the committee and what you can have and what you cannot have. However, based on that, that statement I just made, is that since this incident occurred with Snowden, we've had three different hearings for members of our Democratic Caucus, and the Republican Caucus ... what we're trying to do now is to get the American public to know more about what's going on."<ref name="ABC2013" /> Rep. [[Peter T. King|King]], who was also a guest on ''This Week'' as a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated: "[T]o me it's unprecedented to have all of these top people from an administration during this time of crisis still come in and answer question after question after question. So anyone who says that Congress is somehow being stonewalled is just wrong and [the question] is generally, I think, raised by people who are trying to make a name for themselves."<ref name="ABC2013" />
[[File:Standing ovation for Glenn Greenwald.jpg|thumb|Standing ovation for Greenwald, [[Germany]], December 2014]]
In a February 2014 interview, Greenwald said he believed he risked detention if he reentered the U.S., but insisted that he would "force the issue" on principle, and return for the "many reasons" he had to visit, including if he won a prestigious award of which he was rumoured to be the winner.<ref name="beutler" /> Later that month, it was announced that he was, in fact, among the recipients of the 2013 [[George Polk Award|Polk Awards]], to be conferred April 11, 2014 in Manhattan.<ref name="pengelly" /> In a subsequent interview, Greenwald stated he would attend the ceremony, and added: "I absolutely refuse to be exiled from my own country for the crime of doing journalism and I'm going to force the issue just on principle.

Their entry into the United States was trouble-free and they traveled with an ACLU attorney and a German journalist "to document any unpleasant surprises". Accepting the award, Greenwald said he was "happy to see a table full of ''Guardian'' editors and journalists, whose role in this story is much more integral than the publicity generally recognizes".<ref name="IU7O6" /> On April 14, the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] was awarded jointly to ''The Guardian'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' for revelation of widespread secret surveillance by the NSA.
