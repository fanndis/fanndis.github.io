'''Julia Eileen Gillard''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|AC}} (born 29 September 1961) is an Australian former politician who served as the 27th [[Prime Minister of Australia]] and [[Australian Labor Party|Leader of the Labor Party]] from 2010 to 2013. She was previously [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia]] from 2007 until 2010 and held the additional positions of [[Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth|Minister for Education]], [[Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (Australia)|Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations]] and [[Minister for Social Inclusion (Australia)|minister for Social Inclusion]] from 2007 to 2010. She is the first and only woman to hold the positions of Deputy Prime Minister, Prime Minister and leader of a major party in Australia.

Born in [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry, Wales]], Gillard migrated with her family to [[Adelaide]], South Australia, in 1966. She attended [[Mitcham Primary School|Mitcham Demonstration School]] and [[Unley High School]]. Gillard went on to study at the [[University of Adelaide]], but switched to the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1982, where she eventually graduated with Bachelor of Laws (1986) and Bachelor of Arts (1989) degrees. She worked with the [[Australian Union of Students]] during that time and was the organisation's president from 1983 to 1984. In 1987, Gillard joined the law firm [[Slater & Gordon]]. She became a [[Partner (business rank)|partner]] in 1990, specialising in industrial law, but left in 1996 to become chief of staff to [[John Brumby]], the leader of the Labor Party in Victoria. This preceded her own entry into federal politics.

Gillard was first elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] at the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]] for the seat of [[Division of Lalor|Lalor]]. Following the [[2001 Australian federal election|2001 election]], she was elected to [[Shadow Cabinet of Australia|Shadow Cabinet]]. When [[Kevin Rudd]] was elected as party leader and [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]] in December 2006, Gillard was elected unopposed as his deputy. Upon Labor's victory at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 election]], she became the first female Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, and was made Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. On {{Nowrap|24 June 2010}}, after Rudd lost the support of his party and resigned, Gillard [[Australian Labor Party leadership spill, 2010|was elected unopposed]] as his replacement, thus becoming Prime Minister. The subsequent [[2010 Australian federal election|2010 election]] saw the first [[hung parliament]] since 1940. Gillard was able to form a [[minority government]] with the support of a [[Australian Greens|Green]] MP and three [[independent (politician)|independents]]. On 26 June 2013, after a [[Australian Labor Party leadership spill, June 2013|leadership spill]], Gillard lost the leadership of the Labor Party back to Rudd. Her resignation as Prime Minister took effect the following day. Gillard retired from politics on 5 August 2013, before the impending federal election.

Following her departure from politics, Gillard became an honorary [[Visiting scholar|visiting professor]] at the University of Adelaide, and a nonresident [[Fellow|senior fellow]] at the [[Brookings Institution]]'s Center for Universal Education. She released her political memoir, ''[[My Story (Gillard book)|My Story]]'', in September 2014. She has been on the board of the mental health organisation [[Beyond Blue]] since December 2014 and its chair since July 2017, and was made an honorary fellow of [[Aberystwyth University]] in June 2015. Gillard has also served as the chairwoman of the [[Global Partnership for Education]] since February 2014.

=== 2010 leadership vote ===
{{Main|Australian Labor Party leadership spill, 2010}}
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd suffered a decline in his personal ratings, and a perceived loss of support among his own MPs, following the failure of the Government's [[Energy Efficient Homes Package|insulation program]], controversy regarding the implementation of a [[Minerals Resource Rent Tax|tax on mining]], the failure of the government to secure passage of its [[carbon trading]] scheme and some policy debate about immigration policy. Significant disaffection had arisen within the Labor Party as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2933046.htm |title=The Gillard Coup &#124; Q&A |work=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]]|date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> On 23 June 2010 he announced that Gillard had asked him to hold a [[Australian Labor Party leadership spill, 2010|leadership ballot]] the following day to determine the leadership of the Labor Party, and hence the Prime Ministership of Australia.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Harvey|title=Federal Labor MPs moving to axe Kevin Rudd and replace him with Julia Gillard|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/labor-considers-axing-rudd/story-e6frf7l6-1225883380388|newspaper=[[Herald Sun]] |date=23 June 2010|accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref>

As late as May 2010, prior to challenging Rudd, Gillard was quipping to the media that "There's more chance of me becoming the [[full-forward]] for the [[Western Bulldogs|Dogs]] than there is of any change in the Labor Party".<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2011/s3336424.htm |title=7.30: Carbon Tax, Border Protection and Leadership |work=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]] |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> Consequently, Gillard's move against Rudd on 23 June appeared to surprise many Labor backbenchers. [[Daryl Melham]], when asked by a reporter on the night of the challenge if indeed a challenge was on, replied: "Complete garbage.

Initially, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' reported that the final catalyst for the move on Rudd was sparked by a report that Rudd had used his chief of staff to sound out back benchers on his level of support, thus implying that "he did not trust the repeated assurances by Ms Gillard that she would not stand".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/gillard--becomes-australias-first-female-prime-minister-as-tearful-rudd-stands-aside-20100624-yzvw.html | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | title=Julia Gillard, Prime Minister After Labor Leadership Challenge | date=24 June 2010}}</ref> Later, ABC's 7:30 Report said the seeds for the challenge to Rudd came from "factional heavyweights" [[Bill Shorten]] and Senator [[David Feeney]], who secured the support of "New South Wales right power broker" [[Mark Arbib]] and that Feeney and Arbib went to discuss a challenge with Gillard on the morning of 23 June and a final numbers count began for a challenge.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2010/s2936441.htm |title=7.30—Gillard takes top job in bloodless coup |work=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]] |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref> Accounts have continued to differ as to the extent of Gillard's foreknowledge and planning of the replacement of Rudd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/pm-julia-gillard-stitched-up-kevin-rudd/story-e6freuy9-1226499866236 |title=PM Julia Gillard stiched up Kevin Rudd |date=21 October 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2013}}</ref>

Rudd initially said that he would challenge Gillard, but it soon became apparent that he did not have enough support within the party to survive in his position. Hours before the vote on 24 June, he resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labor Party, leaving Gillard to assume the leadership unopposed. [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] Wayne Swan was at the same time elected unopposed to succeed Gillard as Deputy Leader.<ref name="theaustralian1" />

Shortly afterward, Gillard was sworn in as the 27th Prime Minister of Australia by [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] [[Quentin Bryce]], with Swan being sworn in as Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2010/s2935655.htm|last1=Curtis|first1=Lyndal|last2=Hall|first2=Eleanor|title=Gillard becomes first female PM |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=13 October 2010}}</ref> The members of the [[First Rudd Ministry|Rudd Ministry]], with the exception of Rudd himself who returned to the backbenches, subsequently became the members of the [[First Gillard Ministry]].

Later that day, in her first press conference as Prime Minister, Gillard said that at times the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Government]] "went off the tracks", and "[I] came to the view that a good Government was losing its way".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/julia-gillard-is-australias-new-prime-minister/story-e6freuy9-1225883617249 |title=Julia Gillard is Australia's new Prime Minister |first1=Malcolm |last1=Farr |first2=Alison |last2=Rehn |first3=Steve |last3=Lewis |first4=Simon |last4=Benson |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref> Gillard offered wider explanation of her motivations for replacing Rudd during the [[Australian Labor Party leadership spill, 2012|2012 Labor leadership spill]] in which Rudd challenged Gillard to regain the Labor leadership, telling the media that the Rudd Government had entered a "period of paralysis" and that Rudd's work patterns were "difficult and chaotic".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national-old/julia-gillard-responds-to-kevin-rudds-resignation-by-calling-leadership-ballot-for-monday/story-e6frfkvr-1226279217149 |title=SHE SAYS: 'Why I had to knife Kevin Rudd' – Gillard confirms leadership spill |publisher=[[News.com.au]] |date=23 February 2012 |accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>

Upon her election by the Labor Party, Gillard said that she wouldn't move into [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]] until she was elected Prime Minister in her own right, instead choosing to divide her time between a flat in [[Canberra]] and her home in [[Altona, Victoria|Altona]], a western suburb of Melbourne.<ref name = "New PM">{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/labor-party-was-losing-its-way-under-rudd-gillard-20100624-z10q.html|last=Levy |first= Megan |title=Labor Party was losing its way under Rudd: Gillard |date=24 June 2010 |newspaper=[[Brisbane Times]] |accessdate=13 October 2010}}</ref> Gillard moved into The Lodge on 26 September 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/gillard-moves-into-the-lodge-20100926-15s2x.html|title=Gillard moves into The Lodge|date=26 September 2010 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=26 September 2010}}</ref>

As well as being the first female Prime Minister, and the first never to have married, Gillard is the first Prime Minister since [[Billy Hughes]] to have been born overseas.<ref name="theaustralian1">{{cite news|first1=Christian|last1=Kerr|last2=Franklin |first2=Matthew|title=Julia Gillard 'honoured' to become prime minister as Kevin Rudd stands aside|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/politics/labor-leadership-ballot/story-e6frgczf-1225883589139|newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=24 June 2010|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>

The leadership question remained a feature of the [[Gillard Government]]'s terms in office, and amidst ongoing leadership speculation following an ABC TV ''[[Four Corners]]'' examination of the events leading up to Rudd's replacement which cast doubt on Gillard's insistence that she did not actively campaign for the Prime Ministership, Attorney-General [[Nicola Roxon]] spoke of Rudd's record in the following terms: "I don't think we should whitewash history – while there are a lot of very good things our government did with Kevin as prime minister, there were also a lot of challenges, and it's Julia who has seen through fixing a lot of those problems."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/julia-gillard-still-has-the-numbers-in-any-leadership-vote-with-kevin-rudd-says-nicola-roxon/story-fn3dxity-1226274606927 | title=Julia Gillard still has the numbers in any leadership vote with Kevin Rudd, says Nicola Roxon | date=18 February 2012 | work=[[The Australian]]}}</ref>

=== Domestic policies ===

====Economy====
Gillard came to office in the aftermath of the global [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. Government receipts fell during the international downturn and the Rudd Government had employed pump priming expenditure.<ref>{{cite news|first=Paul |last=Kelly |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/addiction-to-over-promising-in-julia-gillards-government-for-all-seasons/story-e6frg74x-1226537092324 |title=Addiction to over-promising in Julia Gillard's 'government for all seasons' |date=15 December 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2013 |work=[[The Australian]]}}</ref> Upon taking over as leader of the Labor Party on 24 June 2010, Gillard said she could "assure" Australians that the Federal Budget would be in surplus in 2013.<ref name="23 June Press Conference"/> The Government continued to promise this outcome until December 2012. Gillard initially ruled out a "[[carbon tax]]" but said that she would build community consensus for a price on carbon and open negotiations with the mining industry for a re-vamped mining profits tax.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name="23 June Press Conference">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdXlUdSBOYk |title=23 June Press Conference |publisher=YouTube |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/gillard-becomes-first-female-pm-20100623-z0d4|title=Gillard becomes first female PM|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref> Following the 2010 hung parliament election result, the Labor Party elected to adopt the Australian Greens preference for a carbon tax to transition to an emissions trading scheme, establishing a carbon price via the [[Clean Energy Act 2011]]. The government also introduced a revised Minerals Resource Rent Tax and the [[Flood levy|Queensland Flood Levy]].

The Gillard Government stressed a need to return the Federal Budget to surplus for the 2012–13 financial year, and Gillard said that there would be "no ifs no buts" about this promise and that "failure is not an option here and we won't fail".<ref>{{cite news|last=Blair |first=Tim |url=http://blogs.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/timblair/index.php/dailytelegraph/comments/failure_is_not_an_option/ |title=Failure is not an option|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=21 December 2012|accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated13>Bolt, Andrew.

====Health====
Like her predecessor Rudd, Gillard had said that health is a priority in her agenda. She announced during the 2010 election, that there would be an increase of 270 placements for emergency doctors and nurses and 3,000 extra nursing scholarships over the following 10 years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/27/2965258.htm | title=Rural doctors question Gillard pledge|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref> She also said [[mental health]] would be a priority in her second term, with a $277&nbsp;million suicide-prevention package which would target high-risk groups.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/labor-to-expand-the-mental-health-front-line/story-fn59niix-1225897734559 |title= Labor to expand the mental health front line |work=[[The Australian]] |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=25 March 2011 |first1=Patricia |last1=Karvelas |first2=Adam |last2=Cresswell }}</ref> As the election delivered a hung parliament, a $1.8&nbsp;billion package was given to rural hospitals, which was agreed to by the independents to support her re-election.<ref name=3005179abc/>

In October 2010, her government introduced legislation to reform funding arrangements for the health system, with the intention of giving the Commonwealth responsibility for providing the majority of funding to public hospitals and 100 per cent of funding for primary care and GP services.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22media%2Fpressrel%2F314546%22|title=Transcript of joint press conference: 25 October 2010: Pink Ribbon Day; health funding; MRRT; John Howard's biography; abortion; Caucus; health specialists; interest rates; Prime Minister's travel|date=25 October 2010|accessdate=2 January 2015|work=Parliament of Australia}}</ref> In February 2011, Gillard announced extensive revision of the original health funding reforms proposed by the Rudd Government, which had been unable to secure the support of all state governments. The revised Gillard government plan proposed that the federal government move towards providing 50% of new health funding (and not 60 per cent as originally agreed) and removed the requirement of the states to cede a proportion of their [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]] revenue to the Federal Government to fund the new arrangement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/julia-gillard-details-revamped-health-reform-package-with-the-states-before-coag/story-fn59niix-1226004336983|title=Tony Abbott says Julia Gillard's revamped health reform package is yet another backdown|date=11 February 2011|accessdate=11 February 2011|work=[[The Australian]]}}</ref> The new agreement was supported by all state premiers and chief ministers<ref>{{cite news|first=Matthew |last=Franklin|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/gillard-seals-health-overhaul/story-e6frg6n6-1226005407694 |title=Gillard seals health overhaul |work=[[The Australian]] |date=14 February 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2011}}</ref> and signed on 2 August.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/states-sign-gillards-20b-health-deal/story-fn3dxity-1226106893492 | title=States sign Gillard's $20b health deal | date=2 August 2011 | agency=Australian Associated Press | work=[[The Australian]]}}</ref>

====Immigration====
In relation to population targets for Australia, Gillard told [[Fairfax Media]] in August 2010 that while skilled migration is important: "I don't support the idea of a [[big Australia]]". Gillard also altered the nomenclature of [[Tony Burke]]'s role as "Minister for Population" to that of "Minister for Sustainable Population".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/06/27/2938009.htm |title=Gillard shuts door on 'big Australia' |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |accessdate=4 April 2011}}</ref> The Government released a "sustainable population strategy" in May 2011 which did not specify a target population.<ref name="Even Bigger Australia">{{cite news|title=Big Australia?

After winning leadership of the Labor Party, Gillard identified addressing the issue of unauthorised arrivals of asylum seekers as a priority of her government. She announced that negotiations were underway for a return to "offshore processing" of asylum seeker claims. Gillard ruled out a return to processing at [[Nauru]] and named [[East Timor]] as a preferred location for new detention and processing facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/07/2946786.htm |title=This is no Pacific Solution: Gillard |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=4 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-07-13/smith-still-backs-asylum-plan/901834 |title=Smith still backs asylum plan |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=13 July 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref> The East Timorese government rejected the plan.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Kelly |title= East Timor's parliament rejects Gillard plan for regional asylum-seeker centre |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/politics/east-timors-parliament-rejects-gillard-plan-for-regional-asylum-seeker-centre/story-e6frgczf-1225890881986 |work=[[The Australian]] | date=25 July 2010 |accessdate=25 March 2011}}</ref>

In October 2010, her government announced that it would open two detention centres for 2000 immigrants, due to the pressures in allowing women and children to be released into the community. One was to be opened in [[Inverbrackie, South Australia]], and one in [[Northam, Western Australia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/pm-julia-gillard-softens-detention-stance/story-fn59niix-1225940414154 |title=PM Julia Gillard softens detention stance |work=[[The Australian]] |date=19 October 2010 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |first1=Patricia |last1=Karvelas |first2=Paul |last2=Maley}}</ref> She said it would be a short-term solution to the problem and that temporary detention centres would be closed.

On 15 December 2010, a ship containing 89 asylum seekers crashed on the shore of [[Christmas Island]], killing up to fifty people.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/timeline-of-christmas-island-tragedy/story-e6frfkvr-1225972208620 |title=Timeline of Christmas Island tragedy |publisher=[[News.com.au]] |date=16 December 2010 |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/9477127/ |title=Christmas Island tragedy left 'more dead than alive' |work=[[The West Australian]]|date=19 May 2011 |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> Refugee and migrant advocates condemned the government's hardline policy as responsible for the tragedy,<ref>{{cite news|title=The tragedy that shames Australia|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/the-tragedy-that-shames-australia-2161625.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=16 December 2010|first1=Kathy|last1=Marks}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Refugee advocate blames Government, Andrew Bolt calls for Julia Gillard's resignation|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/refugee-advocate-blames-government-for-christmas-island-boat-deaths-andrew-bolt-calls-for-julia-gillards-resignation/story-e6frfkvr-1225971895724|publisher=news.com.au|date=16 December 2010}}</ref> and Labor Party President [[Anna Bligh]] called for a complete review of the party's asylum seeker policy.<ref name=xmasbligh>{{cite news|title=Christmas Island tragedy forces review of ALP's asylum stance|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/chritmas-island-tragedy-forces-review-of-alps-asylum-stance/story-fn59niix-1225972457596|work=[[The Australian]]|date=17 December 2010|first1=Jamie|last1=Walker|first2=Paul|last2=Maley}}</ref> Gillard returned early from holidays in response to the crash, and to review asylum seeker policy.<ref name=xmasbligh /> Some months later Gillard would announce "The Malaysia Solution" in response.<ref>{{cite news|title=Prime Minister Julia Gillard wins backing on Malaysia Solution|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/pm-facing-malaysian-deadlock-as-coalition-refuses-to-budge-on-nauru/story-fn59niix-1226134614843|work=[[The Australian]]|date=12 September 2011|first=James|last=Massola}}</ref>

In April 2011, Australia's federal government confirmed that a detention centre for single men would be built at the old army barracks at [[Pontville]], 45 minutes north of [[Hobart]], Tasmania. This immigration detention centre would house up to 400 refugees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2011/04/05/220051_tasmania-news.html |title=Detention centre for Pontville Tasmania News |work=The Mercury |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2011}}</ref> Also in April 2011, immigration detainees at the Villawood detention centre rioted in protest of their treatment, setting fire to several buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-04-21/buildings-torched-in-villawood-riot/2607462 |title=Buildings torched in Villawood riot |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=21 April 2011 |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>

In May 2011, Gillard announced that Australia and [[Malaysia]] were finalising an arrangement to exchange asylum seekers. Gillard and Immigration Minister [[Chris Bowen]] said they were close to signing a bilateral agreement which would result in 800 asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat being taken to Malaysia instead. Australia would take 4,000 people from Malaysia who have previously been assessed as being refugees.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/gillard-announces-malaysian-solution-20110507-1ed0h.html |title=Gillard announces Malaysian solution |work=[[The Age]] |date=7 May 2011 |accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref> However, on 31 August, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] ruled that the agreement to transfer refugees from Australia to Malaysia was invalid, and ordered that it not proceed.

The asylum seeker debate returned during August 2012 following the report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, led by retired [[Air Chief Marshal (Australia)|Air Chief Marshall]] [[Angus Houston]]. Accepting the panel's recommendation, Gillard on 12 August 2012 announced that a bill then before Parliament would be amended to allow the Government to choose sites for off-shore processing. At the same time she announced the Government would nominate the former detention centres on Nauru and [[Manus Island]], Papua New Guinea to be re-opened.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/immigration/labor-caucus-backs-expert-panel-on-asylum-policy/story-fn9hm1gu-1226449423972 |title=Labor to act quickly to reopen Nauru, PNG asylum-seeker processing centres |last=Packham |first=Ben |work=[[The Australian]] |date=12 August 2012 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref> The amended bill passed with the support of the Opposition on 16 August 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/offshore-asylum-laws-through-parliament/story-fndo1sx1-1226451444495 |title=Offshore asylum laws through Parliament |date=16 August 2012 |newspaper=Adelaide Now |first=Anna |last=Caldwell |agency=Australian Associated Press |accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref>

====Education====
Gillard held the responsibilities of the Education portfolio for four days after becoming Prime Minister, before appointing Simon Crean as [[Minister for Education (Australia)|Education Minister]] on 28 June 2010. Following the 2010 election, [[Peter Garrett]] assumed the role of Minister for Education, where he remained until June 2013. Gillard also altered the nomenclature of "Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research" to comprise [[Tertiary education in Australia|tertiary education]]; [[Chris Evans (Australian politician)|Chris Evans]], Chris Bowen, and later, [[Craig Emerson]], each served as [[Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science (Australia)#List of science ministers|Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research]] in the Gillard Government.

At the July 2010 National Press Club, Gillard stated "I will make education central to my economic agenda because of the role it plays in developing the skills that lead to rewarding and satisfying work – and that can build a high-productivity, high-participation economy."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/politics/pm-julia-gillards-speech-to-the-national-press-club-moving-forward-to-a-stronger-and-fairer-economy/story-e6frgczf-1225892159728 |title=PM Julia Gillard's speech to the National Press Club – Moving forward to a stronger and fairer economy |work=[[The Australian]] |date= 15 July 2010|accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/gillard-mum-on-rudd-resignation-deal-20100715-10c1x.html?from=age_sb |title=Gillard mum on Rudd 'resignation deal' claim |work=[[The Age]] |date= 15 July 2010|accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref> The Gillard Government in January 2011 extended tax cuts to parents to help pay for stationery, textbooks or computer equipment under the Education Tax Refund scheme.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/keep-your-backtoschool-receipts-pm-20110106-19h24.html | title=Keep your back-to-school receipts: PM | date=6 January 2011 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>

As Education Minister under Rudd, Gillard commissioned [[David Gonski]] to be chairman of a committee to make recommendations regarding funding of education in Australia. The findings and recommendations of the committee were later presented to the Gillard Government in November 2011, whereafter deliberations were entered into by the Federal and state governments to consider its content. The committee's report is known as the [[Gonski Report]].<ref>(2 August 2013). [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-08-27/whats-in-the-gonski-report/4219508 "What's in the Gonski Report?"]. ''[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]''. Retrieved 20 May 2016.</ref> Subsequently, the proposed reforms (an increase in funding) became known as "Gonski" and supporters urged governments to "Give a Gonski". The report was removed from the government website by the newly elected [[Abbott Government]] after the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 Federal election]] and is preserved by Australia's [[Pandora Archive]].<ref>(December 2011).

Retrieved 20 May 2016.</ref>

Gillard continued to put the [[My School]] website centre of her education agenda, which was controversial at the time when she implemented it as Minister for Education. Although it was popular amongst parents, the website helped parents view statistics of the school their children attended. She had since unveiled the revamped version, My School 2.0, promising better information to parents.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/national/myschool-20-website-to-give-parents-better-information-about-their-childs-education/story-e6frfkvr-1225955326426 | work=The Courier-Mail | first1=Emma | last1=Chalmers | first2=Tanya | last2=Chilcott | title=MySchool 2.0 website to give parents better information about their child's education | date=18 November 2010}} Retrieved 20 May 2016.</ref>

Universities also placed highly on her education agenda. Legislation which would have been voted on in November 2010 would have seen the introduction of a national universities regulator; however, this was delayed until 2011 following criticisms from the higher education sector. It was also announced by her government that legislation to establish the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency would also be introduced early 2011.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/delay-for-uni-standards-legislation-20101115-17ufn.html | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | title=Delay for uni standards legislation | date=16 November 2010}}</ref>

====Climate change====
The Rudd [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] opposition promised to implement an [[emissions trading scheme]] (ETS) before the 2007 federal election which Labor won. Rudd, unable to secure support for his scheme in the Senate, dropped it. During his 2012 leadership challenge against Gillard's prime ministership, Rudd said that it was Gillard and Swan who convinced him to delay his Emissions Trading Scheme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/rudd-i-was-framed-for-julias-mistakes/story-e6frfkvr-1226280784182 |title=Rudd: 'I was framed for Julia's mistakes'|publisher=[[News.com.au]]|date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref>

In the 2010 election campaign, Gillard pledged to build a "national consensus" for a carbon price by creating a "citizens assembly", to examine "the evidence on climate change, the case for action and the possible consequences of introducing a market-based approach to limiting and reducing carbon emissions", over the course of one year. The assembly was to be selected by an independent authority who would select people from the electoral roll using census data.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-election/pm-pledges-peoples-assembly-on-climate-20100722-10myh.html |work=[[The Age]] | first1=Adam | last1=Morton | first2=Tom | last2=Arup | title=PM pledges 'people's assembly' on climate | date=23 July 2010}}</ref> The plan was never implemented. After the 2010 Election, Gillard agreed to form a minority government with the Greens and Independents and replaced her "citizens assembly" plan with a climate change panel consisting of Labor, Greens and independent members of the Australian parliament.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/labor-greens-strike-alliance-deal-for-stable-government/story-e6frg6n6-1225912672100 | title=Gillard PM dumps citizens assembly as Labor, Greens strike alliance deal | date=1 September 2010 | work=[[The Australian]] | first1=James | last1=Massola | first2=Samantha | last2=Maiden}} Retrieved 20 May 2016.</ref> The panel ultimately announced backing for a temporary carbon tax, leading up to an Emissions Trading Scheme.

During the 2010 election campaign, Gillard also said that no carbon tax would be introduced under a government she led.<ref name=NoCarbonTax>{{cite news|title=PM says no carbon tax under her govt|url=http://www.smh.com.au//breaking-news-national/pm-says-no-carbon-tax-under-her-govt-20100816-126ru.html|accessdate=25 January 2016|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=16 August 2010}}</ref> In the first hung parliament result in 70 years, the Gillard Government, with the support of the Australian Greens and some cross bench independents, negotiated the implementation of a carbon tax (the preferred policy of the Australian Greens), by which a fixed-price carbon tax would proceed to a floating-price ETS within a few years under the plans.

====Poker machines====
In 2010, Gillard agreed with [[Nick Xenophon]], Andrew Wilkie and the [[Australian Greens]] to introduce [[poker machine]] reform legislation (to curb problem gambling) into the Australian parliament by May 2012. After members of the [[cross bench]] advised that they would not support this bill in the Australian House of Representatives, Gillard withdrew her support. Wilkie said that many Australians felt "very let down by the PM", and fellow anti-gambling campaigner Xenophon accused the Prime Minister of "backstabbing the person who put her in office".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/2012/01/bst_20120123_0732.mp3 |title=Interview with PM Julia Gillard |work=[[Radio National]] AM |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref>

On 21 January 2012, Wilkie announced that he was withdrawing his support for the Gillard Government after it broke the agreement he had signed with Gillard to implement mandatory [[precommitment]] for all poker machines by 2014. He stated that he would support the government's alternative plan to trial pre-commitment in the ACT and require that pre-commitment technology be installed in all poker machines built from 2013, but that this fell short of what he had been promised in return for supporting the government.<ref name="Wilkie withdraws support">{{cite news|title=Wilkie withdraws support over broken pokies deal|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-01-21/wilkie-withdraws-support-over-broken-pokies-deal/3786040|accessdate=21 January 2012|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=21 January 2012}}</ref> In response, Gillard and [[Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs]] Jenny Macklin argued that there was not enough support in the House of Representatives for Wilkie's preferred option for it to be passed, and that they had been advised it was technically unfeasible to implement mandatory commitment within the time frame he had specified.<ref name="PM unveils compromise deal">{{cite news|last=Peatling|first=Stephanie|title=PM unveils compromise deal over pokies reform|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/pm-unveils-compromise-deal-over-pokies-reform-20120121-1qb1m.html|accessdate=2 January 2015|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=21 January 2012}}</ref>

====Same-sex marriage====
The [[2011 Australian Labor Party National Conference|triennial Labor conference]] held in December 2011 saw Gillard successfully negotiate an amendment on same-sex marriage to see the party introduce a [[conscience vote]] to parliament through a [[private member's bill]], rather than a binding vote.<ref name="tacticalswitch">{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/in-depth/wake-up-call-that-drove-pm-towards-tactical-switch/story-fnba0rxe-1226213616969 | first=Matthew | last=Franklin | title=Wake-up call that drove PM towards tactical switch | date=5 December 2011 | work=[[The Australian]]}}</ref> Despite Gillard, who had previously stated her personal objection to same-sex marriage, the motion passed narrowly by 208 votes to 184.<ref name="ssmpassed">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-03/labor-votes-for-conscience-vote-on-same-sex-marriage/3710828|title=Labor decides on conscience vote for gay marriage|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=22 January 2012|accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref><ref name="ssmpassed2">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/gay-marriage-free-vote-a-pot-of-gold-at-end-of-labor-deal/story-e6frfkvr-1226212487275|title=Labor backs same-sex marriage|work=News Corporation|date=4 December 2011 |accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref> In February 2012, two bills to allow same-sex marriage in Australia were introduced in the 43rd Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inquiry into the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 and the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=spla/bill%20marriage/index.htm|publisher=House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref>

====Forced adoptions====

In an August 2012 press conference regarding the [[AWU affair]], Gillard was critical of ''The Australian'' newspaper for writing about her connection to the affair and of what she called "misogynist nut jobs on the internet".

=== 2012 leadership vote ===
{{Main|Australian Labor Party leadership spill, 2012}}
[[File:Julia Gillard 2012 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Gillard in 2012]]
In the light of poor polling results for the Gillard Government, speculation that Foreign Minister and former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd wished to challenge Gillard for the leadership culminated with Rudd resigning from the Cabinet on 22 February 2012. Rudd told the media "I can only serve as Foreign Minister if I have the confidence of Prime Minister Gillard and her senior ministers" after Gillard failed to repudiate cabinet ministers who publicly criticised Rudd and his tenure as Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1628677/Rudd-resigns-as-foreign-minister |title=Rudd resigns as foreign minister |work=[[SBS World News]] |date=26 February 2012 |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Benson|first=Simon|title=Kevin Rudd had dinner with Kim Beazley before all hell broke loose|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/kevin-rudd-had-dinner-with-kim-beazley-before-all-hell-broke-loose/story-e6frfkvr-1226279047970|accessdate=23 February 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|date=23 February 2012}}</ref> The situation had been further exacerbated by the revelation on ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' that Gillard's staff wrote her victory speech for the 2010 leadership election two weeks prior to her challenge, contradicting Gillard's earlier claims that she had only resolved to challenge Rudd the day before the vote. This revelation caused particular conflict between Labor factions to surface, with Labor MP [[Darren Cheeseman]] calling on Gillard to resign, while his colleague [[Steve Gibbons (politician)|Steve Gibbons]] called Rudd a "psychopath with a giant ego".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-02-19/questions-over-leaked-rudd-video/3838358 |title=Wilkie convinced Rudd will launch challenge|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date= 15 May 2012|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>

After resigning, Rudd stated that he did not think Gillard could defeat the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] at the next election and that, since his resignation, he had received encouragement from Labor MPs and Cabinet Ministers to contest the leadership.<ref>{{cite news |last=Toohey |first=Paul |title=Kevin Rudd speaks for the first time since his resignation as foreign minister |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/kevin-rudd-holed-up-in-washington-hotel-the-willard-after-resigning-as-foreign-minister/story-e6freuy9-1226278947012 |accessdate=23 February 2012 |newspaper=Daily Telegraph (Sydney) |date=23 February 2012}}</ref> Gillard responded to these developments by announcing a leadership ballot for the morning of 27 February 2012, saying that if she lost the vote she would return to the [[backbench]] and renounce any claims to the leadership. She asked that Rudd make the same commitment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Julia Gillard calls leadership ballot to end 'squabbling'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17136442|accessdate=22 February 2012|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=22 February 2012}}</ref>

{{Main|Australian Labor Party leadership spill, March 2013}}
Despite Gillard's defeating Kevin Rudd comfortably in the 2012 leadership spill, tensions remained in the Labor Party regarding Gillard's leadership.<ref>{{cite news|last=Editor |first=Political |url=http://www.news.com.au/national-news/south-australia/kevin-rudds-the-man-who-wont-go-away-for-labor/story-fndo4dzn-1226580626361 |title=Kevin Rudd's the man who won't go away for Labor |publisher=[[News.com.au]] |date=18 February 2013 |accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref> After Labor's polling position worsened in the wake of Gillard announcing the date of the 2013 election, these tensions came to a head when former Labor Leader and [[Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government|Regional Minister]] Simon Crean called for a leadership spill and backed Rudd on 21 March 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-03-21/live-coverage-labor-leadership-crisis/4586250 |title=Labor leadership crisis|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date= 21 March 2013|accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> In response, Gillard sacked Crean from his position, and called a leadership spill for 4.30&nbsp;pm that same day.

Ten minutes before the ballot was due to occur, Rudd publicly announced that he would not contest the leadership, in line with the commitment he had made following the 2012 contest. As such, Gillard and Wayne Swan were the only candidates for the Leadership and Deputy Leadership of the Labor Party, and were elected unopposed. This marked the first time in history that an incumbent Labor Leader was elected unopposed at a leadership ballot.<ref>{{cite news|last=Farr|first=Malcolm|title=Rudd shies away from PM challenge|url=http://www.news.com.au/national-news/rudd-shies-away-from-pm-challenge/story-fncynjr2-1226602790758|accessdate=21 March 2013|publisher=[[News.com.au]]|date=21 March 2013}}</ref> Several ministers subsequently resigned from the government, including Chief Government Whip [[Joel Fitzgibbon]], Human Services Minister [[Kim Carr]], and Energy Minister [[Martin Ferguson]].

Gillard declared that the question of the Labor leadership was now "settled". Nevertheless, speculation on Gillard's leadership remained a major issue, with polling results indicating an electoral disaster were she to lead the Labor Party into the election. In light of this, media attention once more turned to Kevin Rudd as a possible replacement in the short term. It was reported that Gillard's supporter Bill Shorten was under pressure to ask her to resign, creating a vacancy that Rudd would contest.<ref>{{cite news|last=Uhlmann|first=Chris|title=Labor's predicted election defeat raises leadership questions|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-10/labors-predicted-election-defeat-raises-leadership/4744842|accessdate=11 June 2013|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=11 June 2013}}</ref>

By the end of June 2013, Labor's standing in the polls had worsened, and the Coalition had been leading in most opinion polls for two years; one poll in early June showed that Labor would be reduced to as few as 40 seats after the next election.<ref>{{cite news|title=Julia Gillard loses significant support among caucus|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-09/julia-gillard-loses-significant-support-in-caucus/4742626|accessdate=9 June 2013|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=9 June 2013}}</ref> With a general election due later that year, even some staunch Gillard supporters began to believe that Labor faced almost certain defeat if Gillard continued as leader. According to the ABC's [[Barrie Cassidy]], the question was not whether Gillard would be ousted as Labor leader, but when the ousting would take place.<ref>{{cite news|title=Is Gillard's number up?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-09/cassidy---gillard/4742634|accessdate=9 June 2013|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=9 June 2013|authorlink=Barrie Cassidy|first=Barrie|last=Cassidy}}</ref>

Following further speculation over her leadership, on 26 June a rumour emerged that supporters of Kevin Rudd were collecting signatures for a letter demanding an immediate leadership vote. That afternoon, before any letter had been published, Gillard called a leadership spill live on television.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nick |last=Bryant |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-23061391 |title=Kevin Rudd ousts Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=6 June 2013 |accessdate=28 June 2013}}</ref> She challenged any would-be opponent to join her in a pledge that, while the winner would become leader, the loser would immediately retire from politics. Despite his earlier comments that he would not return to the leadership under any circumstances, Kevin Rudd announced that he would challenge Gillard for the leadership, and committed to retiring from politics if he lost. In the party-room ballot later that evening, Rudd defeated Gillard by a margin of 57 votes to 45.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national-news/federal-election/labor-leadership-live-kevin-rudd-returns-julia-gillard-loses-support-of-partyroom/story-fnho52ip-1226669921693 |title=Labor leadership live: Kevin Rudd returns, Julia Gillard loses support of partyroom |publisher=[[News.com.au]] |date=26 June 2013 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref>

Following her defeat in the [[Australian Labor Party leadership spill, June 2013|leadership vote]] on 26 June 2013, Gillard congratulated Rudd on his win and announced that she would immediately tender her resignation as Prime Minister to the Governor-General, Quentin Bryce.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national-news/federal-election/labor-leadership-live-kevin-rudd-returns-julia-gillard-loses-support-of-partyroom/story-fnho52ip-1226669921693 |title=Labor leadership live: Kevin Rudd returns, Julia Gillard loses support of partyroom |publisher=[[News.com.au]] |date= 26 June 2013|accessdate=28 June 2013}}</ref> She also announced, in keeping with her pledge before the leadership vote, that she would not re-contest her seat of Lalor at the upcoming election, and thus would retire from politics. In her final speech, she reflected on the honour of being the first female head of government in Australia and expressed confidence for the future of women leaders in Australia:{{blockquote|There's been a lot of analysis about the so-called 'gender wars'. Me playing the so-called 'gender card' because heavens knows no-one noticed I was a woman until I raised it [...] I've been a little bit bemused by those colleagues in the newspapers who have admitted that I have suffered more pressure as a result of my gender than other prime ministers in the past but then concluded that it had zero effect on my political position or the political position of the Labor Party. It doesn't explain everything, it doesn't explain nothing, it explains some things. And it is for the nation to think in a sophisticated way about those shades of grey. What I am absolutely confident of is it will be easier for the next woman and the woman after that and the woman after that.
