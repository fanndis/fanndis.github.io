===Configuration===
Salesforce users can configure their CRM application. In the system, there are tabs such as "Contacts," "Reports," and "Accounts." Each tab contains associated information. Configuration can be done on each tab by adding user-defined custom fields.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2006/11/13/an-introduction-to-saleforcecoms-appexchange.html |work=O'Reilly Network |title=An Introduction to Salesforce.com's AppExchange |date=November 13, 2006 |last=Stubblebine |first=Tony}}</ref>

Configuration can also be done at the "platform" level by adding configured applications to a Salesforce instance, that is adding sets of customized / novel tabs for specific vertical- or function-level (Finance, Human Resources, etc.) features.

===Web services===
In addition to the web interface, Salesforce offers a [[SOAP]]/[[Representational state transfer|REST]] [[Web service]] [[application programming interface]] (API) that enables integration with other systems.<ref>{{cite web |title=Field Types {{!}} SOAP API Developer Guide {{!}} Salesforce Developers |url=https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.226.0.api.meta/api/field_types.htm |website=developer.salesforce.com |access-date=5 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Salesforce Offers REST & SOAP API for 3rd Party App Integration |url=https://kennected.org/salesforce-api-integration-rest-soap/ |access-date=5 August 2020 |work=Kennected |date=29 July 2020}}</ref>

==Technologies==
Salesforce works on [[Model–view–controller]] architecture.

===Apex===
Apex is a proprietary programming language provided by the Force.com platform to developers similar to [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]. It is a strongly typed, object-oriented, case-insensitive programming language, following a dot-notation and curly-brackets syntax. Apex can be used to execute programmed functions during most processes on the Force.com platform including custom buttons and links, event handlers on record insertion, update, or deletion, via scheduling, or via the custom controllers of Visualforce or Lightning Experience pages.

Due to the multitenant nature of the platform, the language has strictly imposed governor limitations<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_gov_limits.htm |title=Salesforce Developers |website=Salesforce.com |access-date=July 5, 2017}}</ref> to guard against any code monopolizing shared resources. Salesforce provides a series of [[Asynchrony (computer programming)|asynchronous processing]] methods for Apex to allow developers to produce longer-running and more complex Apex code.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/async_processing/salesforce_async_processing.pdf |title=Asynchronous Processing in Force.com |website=Salesforce.com |access-date=July 6, 2017}}</ref>

=== Lightning ===
In 2014, Salesforce made public the [[Front and back ends|front end]] of its platform, called Lightning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.salesforce.com/lightning|title=Lightning Platform|last=<!-- no byline -->|date=<!-- copyright 2000-2017 -->|website=Salesforce Developers|access-date=July 25, 2018}}{{Self-published source|date=July 2018}}</ref> This component-based framework is what the Salesforce mobile app is built on. Salesforce built on this framework in 2015 by releasing the Lightning Design System,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/|title=Lightning Design System|last=<!-- no byline -->|date=June 29, 2018<!-- last modified, in page footer -->|website=Salesforce.com|access-date=July 25, 2018}}{{Self-published source|date=July 2018}}</ref> an HTML style framework with default CSS styling built in. This framework allows customers to build their own components to either use in their internal instances or sell on the AppExchange.

The Salesforce Lightning App Builder is a tool for [[rapid application development]] of responsive web interfaces. This interface allows for different screens to be put together based on Lightning components. This can be used as layouts for records or specific applications.

[https://blogs.emorphis.com/salesforce-lightning-vs-classic/ Lightning Experience], released in 2016, is the new redesigned interface in Salesforce for processes enhancement. Since then all the apps available on AppExchange need to be Lightning and those built on Classic have to migrate to Lightning as Classic is not to be updated any more by Salesforce. The platform offers an option for developers to employ migration techniques to enable the new user interface and switch to Lightning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/lex_migration_introduction/lex_migration_introduction_whatis|title=Get Started with Lightning Experience|publisher=Salesforce.com|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref>

==Criticisms==
{{Criticism section|date=June 2017}}
===Subject to a phishing attack===

In November 2007 a successful [[phishing]] attack on a Salesforce employee compromised contact information on a number of Salesforce customers, which was then used to send highly targeted phishing emails.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/security-threats/2007/11/07/salesforce-tight-lipped-after-phishing-attack-39290616/ |title=Salesforce tight-lipped after phishing attack |date=November 7, 2007 |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |last=Espiner |first=Tom}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/3709836 |title=Salesforce.com Scrambles To Halt Phishing Attacks |date=November 7, 2007 |last=Patrizio |first=Andy |website=[[QuinStreet|InternetNews.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/security/6058/salesforcecom-customer-list-stolen/ |title=Salesforce.com customer list stolen |date=November 7, 2007 |last=McMillan |first=Robert |work=[[International Data Group|IDG News Service]]}}</ref> Salesforce has stated that "a phisher tricked someone into disclosing a password, but this intrusion did not stem from a security flaw in [the salesforce.com] application or database."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trust.salesforce.com/en/letter/|title=Trust&nbsp;— Salesforce|website=Trust.salesforce.com|access-date=October 9, 2018}}</ref> The phishing breach was cited as an example of why the CRM industry needs greater security for users against such threats as [[Spamming|spam]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/Berlind/?p=880 |title=Phishing-based breach of Salesforce customer data is more evidence of industry's need to act on spam.

===Attempt to trademark [[Social enterprise]]===
In July 2012, Salesforce applied to trademark the term "[[social enterprise]]" in the [[United States]], the [[European Union]] and [[Jamaica]] where the term was in widespread use to describe businesses with a primarily social purpose. This was successfully challenged by a campaign called ''#notinourname'' which was launched by [[Social Enterprise UK]], resulting in Salesforce.com withdrawing their trademark application and agreeing not to use the term in their future marketing.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Not In Our Name|url=http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk:80/policy-campaigns/past-campaigns/not-in-our-name|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923070542/http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk:80/policy-campaigns/past-campaigns/not-in-our-name|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 September 2016|website=socialenterprise.org.uk|publisher=Social Enterprise UK|access-date=3 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/connieguglielmo/2013/08/15/salesforce-coms-marc-benioff-on-innovation-acquisitions-and-reinvention/|title=Salesforce.com's Marc Benioff On Innovation, Acquisitions And Reinvention|last=Guglielmo|first=Connie|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref>
===‘Meatpistol’ presenters let go at Def Con===

In 2017 at [[DEF CON|Def Con]], Salesforce's Director of Offensive Security and a security engineer were fired on the conference room floor in front of several other attendees by an executive at the company after giving a talk.

===RAICES donation refusal===

The [[Nonprofit organization|not-for-profit]] organization [[Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services]] (RAICES) rejected a US$250,000 philanthropic donation from Salesforce because the company has contracts with [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]. The executive director of Raices, Jonathan Ryan, tweeted that "When it comes to supporting oppressive, inhumane, and illegal policies, we want to be clear: the only right action is to stop" in reference to the rejected donation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RAICESTEXAS/status/1019975176140701696|title=Raices Twitter}}</ref> Salesforce CEO [[Marc Benioff]] responded in an [[press release|official statement]] that the company's employees "don't work with [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|CBP]] regarding separation of families.
