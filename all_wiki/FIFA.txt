It is the highest governing body of football.

FIFA was founded in 1904<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/history/index.html |title=History of FIFA - Foundation - FIFA.com |last=FIFA.com |website=FIFA.com |language=en-GB|access-date=15 June 2018}}</ref> to oversee international competition among the national associations of [[Royal Belgian Football Association|Belgium]], [[Danish Football Union|Denmark]], [[Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques|France]], [[German Football Association|Germany]], the [[Royal Dutch Football Association|Netherlands]], [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|Spain]], [[Swedish Football Association|Sweden]], and [[Swiss Football Association|Switzerland]].

Today, FIFA outlines a number of objectives in the organizational Statutes, including growing football internationally, providing efforts to ensure football is accessible to everyone, and advocating for integrity and fair play.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/the-statutes.html |title=FIFA Statutes |last=FIFA.com |website=FIFA.com |language=en|access-date=10 July 2019}}</ref> FIFA is responsible for the organization and promotion of football's major international [[tournaments]], notably the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] which commenced in 1930 and the [[FIFA Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] which commenced in 1991.

==History==
{{Main|History of FIFA}}

The need for a single body to oversee [[association football]] became apparent at the beginning of the 20th century with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters of the [[Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques]] (USFSA) at the Rue Saint Honoré 229 in Paris on 21 May 1904.<ref>Classic Football History of FIFA – Foundation, https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/foundation.html</ref> The French name and acronym are used even outside French-speaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of [[Royal Belgian Football Association|Belgium]], [[Danish Football Union|Denmark]], [[French Football Federation|France]], [[Royal Dutch Football Association|the Netherlands]], Spain (represented by the then-[[Real Madrid C.F.|Madrid Football Club]]; [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|the Royal Spanish Football Federation]] was not created until 1913), [[Swedish Football Association|Sweden]] and [[Swiss Football Association|Switzerland]]. Also, that same day, the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) declared its intention of affiliating through a telegram.<ref name="Filmcircle.com" />

The first president of FIFA was [[Robert Guérin]]. Guérin was replaced in 1906 by [[Daniel Burley Woolfall]] from [[The Football Association|England]], by then a member of the association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the [[Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics in London]] was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.{{dubious|date=June 2015}}

Membership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of [[South African Football Association|South Africa]] in 1909, [[Argentine Football Association|Argentina]] in 1912, [[Canadian Soccer Association|Canada]] and [[Federación de Fútbol de Chile|Chile]] in 1913, and the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] in 1914.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/organisation/52/00/10/fs-120_01a_ma.pdf |title=FIFA's 208 Member Associations |accessdate=1 December 2015 |author=FIFA |date=10 September 2009}}</ref>

During [[World War I]], with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited, the organization's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organization was run by Dutchman [[Carl Anton Wilhelm Hirschmann|Carl Hirschmann]]. It was saved from extinction but at the cost of the withdrawal of the [[Home Nations]] (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their recent World War enemies. The Home Nations later resumed their membership.

The FIFA flag has a blue background, with the organization's logo in the middle.

The current FIFA flag was first flown during the [[2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony]] in Moscow, Russia and has been used ever since.

== Anthem ==
{{Main|FIFA Anthem}}

Akin to the [[UEFA Champions League]], FIFA has adopted an anthem composed by the German composer [[Franz Lambert]] since the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. It has been re-arranged and produced by [[Rob May]] and [[Simon Hill (musician)|Simon Hill]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCvUCgAAQBAJ&q=Rob+May+and+Simon+Hill+FIFA+ANTHEM&pg=PA71 |title=Designing Inclusive Pathways with Young Adults: Learning and Development for a Better World |first1=Judith |last1=Kearney |first2=Lesley |last2=Wood |first3=Richard |last3=Teare |date=28 October 2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789463001571 |via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/fifa-facts/1/673827.html |title=FIFA's 113th foundation day: 10 things you should know about world football's governing body : Sports Arena |website=indiatoday.intoday.in}}</ref> The FIFA Anthem is played at the beginning of official FIFA sanctioned matches and tournaments such as international friendlies, the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[FIFA Women's World Cup]], [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]], [[FIFA U-17 World Cup]], [[Football at the Summer Olympics]], [[FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]], [[FIFA Women's U-17 World Cup]], [[FIFA Futsal World Cup]], [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]] and [[FIFA Club World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9I7bn1b4oc |title=FIFA anthem |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref>

Since 2007, FIFA has also required most of its broadcast partners to use short sequences including the anthem at the beginning and end of FIFA event coverage, as well as for [[break bumper]]s, to help promote FIFA's sponsors. This emulates practices long used by some other international football events such as the UEFA Champions League. Exceptions may be made for specific events; for example, an original piece of African music was used for bumpers during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180614-world-cup-2018-the-extraordinary-power-of-the-football-song |title=The extraordinary power of the football song |date=14 June 2018 |work=BBC}}</ref>

{{Main|List of FIFA Member Associations}}

=== Six confederations and 211 national associations ===
{{FIFA confederations}}
Besides its worldwide institutions, there are six confederations recognized by FIFA which oversee the game in the different continents and regions of the world. National associations, and not the continental confederations, are members of FIFA. The continental confederations are provided for in FIFA's statutes, and membership of a confederation is a prerequisite to FIFA membership.

[[Monegasque Football Federation|Monaco]] is not member of UEFA or FIFA.}}

In total, FIFA recognizes 211 national associations and their associated men's national teams as well as 129 women's national teams; see the [[list of men's national football (soccer) teams|list of national football teams]] and their respective [[list of FIFA country codes|country codes]]. The number of FIFA member associations is higher than the number of UN member states as FIFA has admitted associations from 23 non-sovereign entities as members in their own right, such as the four [[Home Nations]] within the United Kingdom and politically disputed territories such as [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bruisedearth.org/?p=137 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427021948/http://www.bruisedearth.org/?p=137 |archivedate=27 April 2011 |title=Palestine Football: Escape to Victory? |publisher=Bruisedearth.org |date=27 October 2008 |accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref>

The FIFA Working Committee of Small Nations has categorized potential FIFA members into three categories:
#Independent states not in FIFA ([[Kiribati]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]], [[Monaco]], [[Niue]], [[Palau]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Vatican City]])
#Non-independent territories ([[Åland Islands]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Greenland]], [[Guernsey]], [[Isle of Man]], [[Jersey]], [[Martinique]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Réunion]], [[Sint Maarten]], [[Zanzibar]])
#Politically sensitive areas ([[Abkhazia]], [[Crimea]], [[Northern Cyprus]], [[South Ossetia]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.playthegame.org/news/news-articles/2011/cas-ruling-puts-new-focus-on-small-football-nations/ |title=PlayTheGame |accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.playthegame.org/fileadmin/documents/PTG-FIFA_Small_Nations_table1.pdf]</ref>

The [[FIFA World Rankings]] are updated monthly and rank each team based on their performance in international competitions, qualifiers, and friendly matches. There is also a [[FIFA Women's World Rankings|world ranking for women's football]], updated four times a year.

=== Laws and governance ===
[[File:FIFA-Headquarter.jpg|thumb|[[FIFA headquarters]] in [[Zürich]]]]
FIFA is [[FIFA Headquarters|headquartered]] in [[Zürich]], and is an association established under the [[law of Switzerland]].

FIFA's supreme body is the [[FIFA Congress]], an assembly made up of representatives from each affiliated member association. Each national football association has one vote, regardless of its size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. Congress makes decisions relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations and holds elections. Congress elects the [[List of Presidents of FIFA|President of FIFA]], its general secretary, and the other members of the [[FIFA Council]] in the year following the [[FIFA World Cup]].<ref name="FIFA-congress">{{cite news |date=27 May 2011 |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/congress.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405100855/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/congress.html |archivedate=5 April 2010 |title=FIFA Congress |publisher=FIFA}}</ref>

FIFA Council – formerly called the FIFA Executive Committee and chaired by the president – is the main decision-making body of the organization in the intervals of congress. The council is composed of 37 people: the president; 8 vice presidents; and 28 members from the confederations, with at least one of them being a woman. The Executive Committee is the body that decides which country will host the World Cup.

The president and the general secretary are the main office holders of FIFA, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the general secretariat, with its staff of approximately 280 members. [[Gianni Infantino]] is the current president, elected on 26 February 2016 at an extraordinary FIFA Congress session after former president [[Sepp Blatter]] was suspended pending a [[2015 FIFA corruption case|corruption investigation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/08/iss-hayatou-acting-president-fifa-sepp-blatter-suspended |title=Issa Hayatou to be acting Fifa president following suspension of Sepp Blatter |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=8 October 2015 |website=The Guardian|access-date=10 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Acting FIFA President Issa Hayatou |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/acting-president/index.html |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=8 December 2015}}</ref>

FIFA's worldwide organizational structure also consists of several other bodies, under the authority of the FIFA Council or created by Congress as standing committees. Among those bodies are the FIFA Emergency Committee, the [[FIFA Ethics Committee]], the Finance Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Referees Committee.

The FIFA Emergency Committee deals with all matters requiring immediate settlement in the time frame between the regular meetings of the [[FIFA Council]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/committees/committee=1882020/index.html |title=Emergency Committee |publisher=FIFA |access-date=7 December 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/apr/25/newsstory.sport1 |title=Outraged Scot takes up the chase of Blatter |last1=Chaudhary |first1=Vivek |date=25 April 2002 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=8 December 2015}}</ref> The Emergency Committee consists of the FIFA president as well as one member from each confederation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-fifa-emergency-idUSKBN0OD1BX20150528 |title=Blatter chairs emergency FIFA meeting as scandal grows |date=28 May 2015 |work=Reuters |access-date=8 December 2015}}</ref> Emergency Committee decisions made are immediately put into legal effect, although they need to be ratified at the next Executive Committee meeting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/745/fifa/2009/12/04/1665888/fifa-ratify-suspension-of-iraqi-football-association |title=FIFA Ratify Suspension of Iraqi Football Association |date=4 December 2009 |publisher=Goal |access-date=8 December 2015 }}</ref>

=== Administrative cost ===
FIFA publishes its results according to [[International Financial Reporting Standards|IFRS]]. The total compensation for the management committee in 2011 was 30&nbsp;million for 35 people. Blatter, the only full-time person on the committee, earned approximately two million Swiss francs, 1.2&nbsp;million in salary and the rest in bonuses.<ref>[http://www.bilanz.ch/unternehmen/fifa-boni-von-wegen-30-millionen Fifa-Boni: Von wegen 30 Millionen], Bilanz, 17 May 2012.</ref><ref>[https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/02/30/12/07/fifafr2013en_neutral.pdf FIFA Financial Report 2013], p94.</ref><ref>[http://www.persoenlich.com/interview/blatter-joseph-fifa-pr%C3%A4sidentoktober2002-152063 Interview mit: Joseph Blatter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725165054/http://www.persoenlich.com/interview/blatter-joseph-fifa-pr%C3%A4sidentoktober2002-152063 |date=25 July 2014 }}, persönlich.com, 2002–10.</ref> A report in London's ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in June 2014 said the members of the committee had their salaries doubled from $100,000 to $200,000 during the year.

== Governance ==
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}
{{Main|Laws of the Game (association football)}}

The laws that govern football, known officially as the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]], are not solely the responsibility of FIFA; they are maintained by a body called the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB). FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: [[The Football Association|England]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Ireland]], who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognized for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates.

The FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies that have the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the congress, the executive committee, the general secretariat, and standing and ad hoc committees.<ref>{{cite web |last=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |title=FIFA TRANSFER REGULATIONS AND UEFA PLAYER ELIGIBILITY RULES: MAJOR CHANGES IN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MINORS |url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |publisher=EMORY INTERNATIONAL LAW REVIEW |accessdate=28 March 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319030412/http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/eilr/25/25.1/Lembo.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2013}}</ref>

=== Discipline of national associations ===
FIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member organizations or if the associate is not functioning properly.

A 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs, and appear in official matches for a maximum of two, in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of [[FIFA Two|two former Ireland internationals]]. As a direct result of this controversy, FIFA modified this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with out-of-phase seasons.

=== Video replay and goal-line technology ===
{{See also|Goal-line technology|Video assistant referee}}
FIFA now permits the use of video evidence during matches, as well as for subsequent sanctions. However, for most of FIFA's history it stood opposed to its use.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/jan/05/newsstory.sport8 |title=Fifa rules out video evidence |date=5 January 2005 |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=29 November 2009}}</ref> The 1970 meeting of the [[International Football Association Board]] "agreed to request the television authorities to refrain from any slow-motion play-back which reflected, or might reflect, adversely on any decision of the referee".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1970/1970min.pdf |title=Minutes of the AGM |author=IFAB |publisher=Soccer South Bay Referee Association |location=Inverness |date=27 June 1970 |accessdate=29 November 2009 |page=§&nbsp;5(i) |nopp=y|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430093219/http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1970/1970min.pdf |archivedate=30 April 2011}}</ref> As recently as 2008 FIFA president Sepp Blatter said: "Let it be as it is and let's leave [football] with errors. The television companies will have the right to say [the referee] was right or wrong, but still the referee makes the decision – a man, not a machine."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/story/2008/03/08/fifa-instant-replay.html |work=[[CBC News]] |title=FIFA halts instant replay experiment |date=8 March 2008}}</ref> This stance was finally overturned on 3 March 2018, when the IFAB wrote [[video assistant referee]]s (also known as VARs) into the Laws of the Game on a permanent basis.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historic step for greater fairness in football |url=http://www.theifab.com/news/historic-step-for-greater-fairness-in-football |website=The IFAB |publisher=IFAB |accessdate=6 July 2018 |date=3 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721225556/http://www.theifab.com/news/historic-step-for-greater-fairness-in-football |archive-date=21 July 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Their use remains optional for competitions.

In early July 2012 FIFA sanctioned the use of goal-line technology, subject to rules specified by the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB), who had officially approved its use by amending the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] to permit (but not require) its use.<ref>

== Recognitions and awards ==
FIFA holds an annual awards ceremony, [[The Best FIFA Football Awards]] since [[The Best FIFA Football Awards 2016|2016]], which recognizes both individual and team achievements in international association football. Individually, the top men's player is awarded [[The Best FIFA Men's Player]] and the top women's player is [[The Best FIFA Women's Player]]. Another main awards are [[The Best FIFA Football Coach]] and [[FIFA FIFPro World11]].

In 2000 FIFA presented two awards, [[FIFA Club of the Century]] and [[FIFA Player of the Century]], to decide the greatest football club and player of the 20th century. [[Real Madrid]] was the club winner, while [[Diego Maradona]] and [[Pelé]] were the joint players winners.

== Corruption ==
{{Main|2015 FIFA corruption case}}
In May 2006, British investigative reporter [[Andrew Jennings]]' book ''Foul! The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals'' ([[Harper Collins]]) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner [[International Sport and Leisure]] (ISL), and revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for [[Sepp Blatter]]'s continued control of FIFA as the organization's president. Shortly after the release of ''Foul!'' a [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' exposé by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke, screened on 11 June 2006, reported that Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than £1m worth of [[bribery|bribes]] pocketed by football officials. [[David Triesman, Baron Triesman|Lord Triesman]], the former chairman of the English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that "behaves like a [[mafia]] family", highlighting the organization's "decades-long traditions of bribes, bungs and [[corruption]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-27801996 |title=BBC News Fifa 'like a mafia family' says former FA boss Triesman |date=11 June 2014 |accessdate=3 October 2014 |website=BBC News }}</ref>

All testimonies offered in the ''Panorama'' exposé were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one: Mel Brennan, a former CONCACAF official, became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of corruption, nonfeasance and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership. Brennan—the highest-level [[African-American]] in the history of world football governance—joined Jennings, [[Trinidad]]ian journalist Lisana Liburd and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money by CONCACAF, and drew connections between ostensible CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviours at FIFA. Since then, and in the light of fresh allegations of corruption by FIFA in late 2010,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/fifa-corruption-pair-suspended-2137472.html |title=Fifa suspend six officials |date=18 November 2010 |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=18 November 2010 |first1=Martyn |last1=Ziegler}}</ref> both Jennings and Brennan remain highly critical of FIFA has Brennan called directly for an alternative to FIFA to be considered by the stakeholders of the sport throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00bws9k/World_Football_20_11_2010/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308000808/http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00bws9k/World_Football_20_11_2010/ |archivedate=8 March 2013 |title=BBC iPlayer – World Football: 20/11/2010 |publisher=BBC |date=20 November 2010 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref>

In a further ''Panorama'' exposé broadcast on 29 November 2010, Jennings alleged that three senior FIFA officials, [[Nicolas Leoz]], [[Issa Hayatou]] and [[Ricardo Teixeira]], had been paid huge bribes by ISL between 1989 and 1999, which FIFA had failed to investigate. Jennings claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100&nbsp;million. A former ISL executive said that there were suspicions within the company that they were only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The programme also alleged that another current official, [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels.' ''Panorama'' also alleged that FIFA requires nations bidding to host the World Cup to agree to implement special laws, including a blanket [[tax exemption]] for FIFA and its corporate sponsors, and limitation of [[workers rights]]. Contrary to FIFA's demands, these conditions were revealed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, resulting in them being told by FIFA that their bid could be adversely affected. Following Jennings' earlier investigations, he was banned from all FIFA press conferences, for reasons he claimed had not been made clear. The accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations, either verbally or by letter.

[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] and [[Andy Anson]], head of England's World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast, three days before FIFA's decision on the host for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], on the grounds that it might damage England's bid; the voters included officials accused by the programme.<ref>''Panorama'', [[BBC One]], 29 November 2010</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11841783 "Panorama: Three Fifa World Cup officials took bribe"], [[BBC News]], 29 November 2010</ref>

In June 2011, it came to light that the [[International Olympic Committee]] had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president [[João Havelange]] into claims of bribery. ''Panorama'' alleged that Havelange accepted a $1&nbsp;million 'bung' in 1997 from ISL. The IOC stated that it "takes all allegations of corruption very seriously and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC members to be passed to our ethics commission".<ref>{{cite news |author=International |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/8581704/Fifa-honourary-president-Joao-Havelange-faces-IOC-inquiry.html |title=Fifa {{Sic |nolink=y|honou|rary |expected=honorary}} president Joao Havelange faces IOC inquiry |work=Daily Telegraph |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011 |location=London}}</ref>

In a 2014 interview, American sportswriter [[Dave Zirin]] said that corruption is endemic to FIFA leadership and that the organization should be abolished for the good of the game. He said that currently, FIFA is in charge of both monitoring corruption in football matches, and marketing and selling the sport, but that two "separate" organizational bodies are needed: an organizational body that monitors corruption and match-fixing and the like, and an organization that's responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling the sport. Zirin said the idea of having a single organization that's responsible for both seems highly ineffective and detrimental to the sport.<ref>[http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=12014 Dave Zirin: Abolish FIFA] (17 June 2014), [[Dave Zirin]], ''[[The Real News Network]]''</ref>

In May 2015, 14 people were arrested, including nine FIFA officials, after being accused of corruption.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/several-top-fifa-officials-arrested |title=Fifa officials arrested on corruption charges as World Cup inquiry launched |author=The Guardian |language=en}}</ref>

The pleas of [[Chuck Blazer]], [[José Hawilla]], Daryan Warner, Darrell Warner, [[Traffic Group]] and [[Traffic Sports USA]] were unsealed in May 2015.<ref name="DOJ presser" /> In another 2015 case, [[Singapore]] also imposed a 6-year "harshest sentence ever received for match-fixing" on match-fixer Eric Ding who had bribed three Lebanese FIFA football officials with prostitutes as an inducement to fix future matches that they would officiate, as well as perverting the course of justice.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Chelvan |first1=Vanessa Paige |title=Convicted match-fixer Eric Ding's jail term extended to 6 years |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/convicted-match-fixer/2211108.html |accessdate=2 December 2015 |publisher=CNA}}</ref>

===Indictments and arrests===
Fourteen FIFA officials and marketing executives were indicted by the [[United States Department of Justice]] in May 2015. The officials were [[2015 arrests of FIFA officials|arrested]] in Switzerland and are in the process of extradition to the US. Specific charges (brought under the [[RICO]] act) include [[wire fraud]], [[racketeering]], and [[money laundering]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/sports/soccer/fifa-officials-face-corruption-charges-in-us.html |title=FIFA Officials Arrested on Corruption Charges; Blatter Isn't Among Them |date=27 May 2015 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref>

Two members of FIFA's executive committee were banned from all football-related activity in November 2010 for allegedly offering to sell their votes to undercover newspaper reporters. In early May 2011, a British parliamentary inquiry into why England failed to secure the 2018 finals was told by member of parliament, [[Damian Collins]], that there was evidence from ''The Sunday Times'' newspaper that [[Issa Hayatou]] of Cameroon and [[Jacques Anouma]] of [[Ivory Coast]] were paid by Qatar. Qatar has categorically denied the allegations, as have Hayatou and Anouma.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afrikansoccer.com/2011/05/qatar-denies-paying-world-cup-bribes-to-hayatou-anouma/ |title=Qatar denies paying World Cup bribes to Hayatou, Anouma |publisher=Afrikansoccer.com |date=11 May 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909025719/http://www.afrikansoccer.com/2011/05/qatar-denies-paying-world-cup-bribes-to-hayatou-anouma/ |archivedate=9 September 2011}}</ref>

FIFA president Blatter said, {{as of|2011|May|23|lc=y}}, that the British newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' has agreed to bring its whistle-blowing source to meet senior FIFA officials, who will decide whether to order a new investigation into alleged World Cup bidding corruption. "[The ''Sunday Times''] are happy, they agreed that they will bring this whistleblower here to Zürich and then we will have a discussion, an investigation of this", Blatter said.

Specifically, the whistle-blower claims that FIFA executive committee members Issa Hayatou and Jacques Anouma were paid $1.5&nbsp;million to vote for Qatar.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/ffa-coy-on-world-cup-bid-rerun-20110520-1ewr2.html |title=FFA coy on World Cup bid re-run |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/923253/fifa-investigates-bin-hammam-bribery-claims?cc=5739 |title=FIFA investigates Bin Hammam bribery claims – ESPN Soccernet |publisher=ESPN |date=25 May 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref> The emirate's bid beat the United States in a final round of voting last December. Blatter did not rule out reopening the 2022 vote if corruption could be proved, but urged taking the matter "step by step". The FIFA president said his organization is "anxiously awaiting" more evidence before asking its ethics committee to examine allegations made in Britain's Parliament in early May 2011.

Hayatou, who is from Cameroon, leads the [[Confederation of African Football]] and is a FIFA vice president. Anouma is president of [[Ivorian Football Federation]]. The whistle-blower said Qatar agreed to pay a third African voter, [[Amos Adamu]], for his support. The [[Nigerian]] was later suspended from voting after a FIFA ethics court ruled he solicited bribes from undercover Sunday Times reporters posing as lobbyists. Blatter said the newspaper and its whistle-blower would meet with FIFA secretary general, [[Jérôme Valcke]], and legal director, Marco Villiger.

Allegations against FIFA officials have also been made to the UK Parliament by [[David Triesman]], the former head of England's bid and the English Football Association. Triesman told the lawmakers that four long-standing FIFA executive committee members—[[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], [[Nicolás Leoz]], [[Ricardo Teixeira]] and [[Worawi Makudi]]—engaged in "improper and unethical" conduct in the 2018 bidding, which was won by Russia. All six FIFA voters have denied wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6565931/fifa-meet-qatar-2022-bid-whistleblower |title=Sepp Blatter: FIFA to meet Qatar 2022 bid whistleblower – ESPN |publisher=ESPN |date=19 May 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref>

On 28 September 2015, [[Sepp Blatter]] suggested that the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]] being awarded to Russia was planned before the voting, and that the [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cup]] would have then been awarded to the United States. However, this plan changed after the election ballot, and the 2022 World Cup was awarded to [[Qatar]] instead of the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34657900 |website=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Riach |first1=James |title=Sepp Blatter: Russia was chosen as 2018 World Cup host before vote |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/28/sepp-blatter-fifa-russia-2018-world-cup-vote |publisher=The Guardian Newspaper}}</ref>

According to leaked documents seen by ''The Sunday Times'', Qatari state-run television channel Al Jazeera secretly offered $400&nbsp;million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar will hold the 2022 World Cup. The contract also documented a secret TV deal between FIFA and Qatar's state-run media broadcast Al Jazeera that $100&nbsp;million will also be paid into a designated FIFA account only if Qatar wins the World Cup ballot in 2010. An additional $480&nbsp;million was also offered by the State of Qatar government, three years after the initial offer, which brings the amount to $880&nbsp;million offered by Qatar to host the 2022 world cup. The documents are now part of the bribery inquiry by Swiss Police.<ref name=JP>{{cite news |url=https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Qatar-offered-FIFA-880-million-for-hosting-the-2022-World-Cup-582998 |title=QATAR OFFERED FIFA $880 MILLION FOR HOSTING THE 2022 WORLD CUP – REPORT |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=10 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/revealed-qatars-secret-880m-world-cup-payments-to-fifa-p3r5rvw9x |title=Exclusive investigation: Qatar's secret $880m World Cup payments to Fifa |work=The Sunday Times |date=10 March 2019}}</ref> FIFA refused to comment on the inquiry and responded to ''The Sunday Times'' in an email and wrote "allegations linked to the Fifa World Cup 2022 bid have already been extensively commented by Fifa, who in June 2017 published the Garcia report in full on Fifa.com.

The revision also made it an offence to make public statements of a defamatory nature against FIFA.<ref name="APnewsFifaEthics"/> Alexandra Wrage, a former member of the FIFA governance committee and an expert in anti-bribery compliance, said that of the revision that "the real value to FIFA is the [[chilling effect]] this will have on critics".<ref name="APnewsFifaEthics"/>
