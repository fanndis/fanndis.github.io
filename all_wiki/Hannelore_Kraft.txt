'''Hannelore Kraft''' (''née'' '''Külzhammer'''; born 12 June 1961) is a German politician. She served as the [[List of Ministers-President of North Rhine-Westphalia|Minister President]] of North Rhine-Westphalia from 2010 until 2017. Kraft was the first woman to serve as head of government of this state and was the third woman to become head of a state government in [[Germany]]. Between 1 November 2010 and 31 October 2011, she was the [[President of the German Bundesrat|President of the Bundesrat]], again the first woman to hold the office.<ref>see [[:de:Liste der Präsidenten des deutschen Bundesrates]]</ref> She is the former leader of the [[SPD North Rhine-Westphalia]] and served on the SPD's federal executive from November 2009 until May 2017, and was one of the four federal deputy chairs.<ref>[http://www.spd.de/de/partei/organisation/parteispitze_gremien/gremien/parteivorstand/index.html spd.de] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914030843/http://www.spd.de/de/partei/organisation/parteispitze_gremien/gremien/parteivorstand/index.html |date=14 September 2010 }}, accessed 10 May 2010 {{in lang|de}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
The daughter of a streetcar driver and a ticket collector,<ref>Birgit Jennen (7 May 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-06/rust-belt-rebel-kraft-leads-german-charge-against-merkel.html Rust-Belt Rebel Kraft Leads German Charge Against Merkel] [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]].</ref> Kraft graduated in 1980, and first trained as a bank clerk with [[Dresdner Bank]]. She commenced her studies in economics at [[University of Duisburg-Essen|Comprehensive University of Duisburg]] in 1982, and studied at [[King's College London]] in 1986 and 1987. She completed her studies in Duisburg in 1989.

==Career==
===Early career===
From 1989 until 2001, Kraft was a consultant and project manager at ZENIT GmbH ('Centre for Innovation and Technology') in [[Mülheim|Mülheim an der Ruhr]], and was head of the local European Info Centre.

===Political career===
Kraft joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in 1994. She was drawn to politics after becoming head of a works council and struggling to find a place for her son in a nursery.<ref>Noah Barkin and Madeline Chambers (18 September 2013), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/18/germany-election-kraft-idUSL5N0HE1DN20130918 German left keeps its own Merkel waiting in the wings] [[Reuters]].</ref> At the [[2000 North Rhine-Westphalia state election]], she was elected to the [[Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Initially representing electoral district 74 (Mülheim II-[[Essen]] VII), she switched to electoral district 64 (Mülheim I) for the [[2005 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|election in 2005]].

On 24 April 2001, she replaced [[Detlev Samland]] as Minister for Federal and European Affairs, and then under [[Minister-President]] [[Peer Steinbrück]], served from 12 November 2002 until 31 May 2005 as Minister for Science and Research.

Kraft was a SPD delegate to the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] for the purpose of electing the [[President of Germany]] in 2004, 2009, 2010 and 2012.

====Chairwoman of the SPD Parliamentary Group in North Rhine-Wesphalia, 2005-2010====
After the SPD lost the 2005 state election in North Rhine-Westphalia, Kraft was elected leader of the SPD's parliamentary group with 95.7% of the votes, hence becoming the Opposition Leader in the state. In 2007, she was elected chairperson of the SPD in North Rhine-Westphalia.

On 13 November 2009, Kraft was elected as one of the four vice chairs of the federal SPD under chairman [[Sigmar Gabriel]], receiving the highest overall vote. A party congress in February 2010 affirmed that she was the SPD's candidate for [[Minister-President]] at the [[2010 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|May 2010 state election]].<ref>[https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article6578699/SPD-in-NRW-feiert-ihre-Spitzenkandidatin-Kraft.html SPD in NRW feiert ihre Spitzenkandidatin Kraft] (SPD in NRW celebrates its top candidate Kraft), ''[[Die Welt]]'' (online edition), 26 February 2010 {{in lang|de}}</ref>

====First term as Minister President, 2010-12====
The state election on 9 May 2010 resulted in a near-tie with the governing CDU at 67 seats, and with Kraft's preferred red-green coalition one seat short of an overall majority; at the time, the federal government under Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] blamed the result on voter anger at the [[Greek government-debt crisis|first aid package for Greece]].<ref>Arne Delfs and Patrick Donahue (11 September 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-10/germany-s-second-most-powerful-woman-takes-on-merkel.html Germany’s Second-Most Powerful Woman Takes on Merkel] Bloomberg.</ref>

After many parallel negotiations and various coalitions, Kraft was elected Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia on 14 July 2010 on the second ballot with a sufficient majority of votes, coming from the SPD and Alliance 90/The Greens, while [[The Left North Rhine-Westphalia|the Left Party]] abstained. Kraft formed a minority government with ministers of Social Democrats and Greens.<ref>[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2010-07/wahl-kraft-ministerpraesidentin "Kraft ist neue Ministerpräsidentin in NRW"], ''Zeit Online'', 07-2010. {{in lang|de}}</ref> It was the first time in Germany that a coalition has attempted to rule one of the 16 federal states without a proper majority,<ref>Quentin Peel (26 September 2011), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ff08a584-e2d6-11e0-93d9-00144feabdc0.html Politics: Minority government confounds sceptics] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> with the only exception being a [[red–green alliance]] governing Berlin for some months in 2001–2002 without a majority. For nearly two years, Kraft ruled the state without a regular majority, pulling votes for each initiative from opposition parties on the right or the left.<ref>Nicholas Kulish (11 May 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/12/world/europe/hannelore-kraft-raises-challenge-to-merkel-in-germany.html In Germany’s Most Populous State, a Regional Leader Rises to Challenge Merkel] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> Together with the deputy governor, [[Sylvia Löhrmann]] from the Green Party, Kraft dubbed her government the "invitation coalition".<ref>Melissa Eddy (7 March 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/world/europe/women-finding-their-way-in-german-politics.html Women Finding Their Way in German Politics] ''The New York Times''.</ref>

After decades of ideological rivalry in the state over the structure of secondary schools, both Kraft and Löhrmann later succeeded in negotiating a cross-party agreement with the centre-right [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] that is to ensure peace until 2023.<ref>Quentin Peel (26 September 2011), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ff08a584-e2d6-11e0-93d9-00144feabdc0.html Politics: Minority government confounds sceptics] ''Financial Times''.</ref>

Kraft got attention for a [[eulogy]] she gave after a stampede killed 21 people at the [[Love Parade disaster|Love Parade]] music festival in July 2010, less than two weeks after she became state premier. When she gave her speech at a memorial ceremony, she spoke of the hours she spent waiting to hear from her son, who was at the event, unsure if he was injured or unharmed, alive or dead.<ref>Nicholas Kulish (11 May 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/12/world/europe/hannelore-kraft-raises-challenge-to-merkel-in-germany.html In Germany’s Most Populous State, a Regional Leader Rises to Challenge Merkel] ''The New York Times''.</ref>

In October 2010, Kraft was elected President of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], according to the customary rotation of the presidency between the Bundesländer. She assumed office on 1 November 2010, becoming the first female office holder, remaining in office until 31 October 2011.

At an SPD convention in Berlin in December 2011, Kraft was confirmed in her vice-chairmanship by 97 percent of party members, the best result for a board member.<ref>Arne Delfs and Patrick Donahue (11 September 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-10/germany-s-second-most-powerful-woman-takes-on-merkel.html Germany’s Second-Most Powerful Woman Takes on Merkel] Bloomberg.</ref>

Krafts failure to get her 2012 budget plans passed after a court ruled a supplementary budget for 2010 unconstitutional forced her to call an early election and left her exposed to charges of fiscal incompetence.<ref>Stephen Brown and Madeline Chambers (14 May 2012), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/05/14/germany-election-kraft-idUKL5E8GE74X20120514 Could heartland victory help Kraft to Berlin?] Reuters.</ref> Kraft had hoped to win backing from the opposition FDP for the budget but their long-standing objections were not overcome in time for the vote.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/14/germany-nrw-vote-idUSB4E8D901220120314 German state faces snap election after gov't defeat] Reuters, 14 March 2012.</ref>

====Second term as Minister President, 2012-2017====
The [[2012 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|resulting election]] saw the SPD-Green coalition win a nine-seat majority and allowed Kraft to remain in office. [[Cabinet Kraft II]] is quite similar to [[Cabinet Kraft I]].

Soon after the May 2012 elections, Kraft placed third in a ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' poll among German politicians right after Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and the new federal president, [[Joachim Gauck]], and ahead of any other politician in the SPD including [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]], who lost to Merkel [[2009 German federal election|in 2009]], and party chairman [[Sigmar Gabriel]].<ref>Erik Kirschbaum (1 July 2012), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/07/01/us-germany-election-poll-idUKBRE8600B720120701 Rising star helps SPD gain on Merkel in German poll] Reuters.</ref><ref>Delamaide, Darrell, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/merkels-dutch-ally-feels-impact-of-backlash-2012-07-05?link=MW_story_investinginsight "Merkel’s Dutch ally feels impact of backlash"], ''[[MarketWatch]]'', 5 July 2012. Kraft/SPD's strength was put in the context of Dutch Socialist Party leader [[Emile Roemer]]'s simultaneously growing strength in opposition before September 2012 elections; of Socialist [[Francois Hollande]]'s May 2012 victory in France; of Radical Left [[Alexis Tsipras]]' strength in spring 2012 Greek elections; and of 2013 German national elections. Retrieved 6 July 2012.</ref> This vaulted Kraft into the top rank of German politicians, prompting speculation that she might be the strongest contender to lead the party against Merkel and potentially succeed her as chancellor.<ref>Nicholas Kulish (13 May 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/14/world/europe/in-rebuke-to-merkel-social-democrats-win-german-vote.html In Rebuke to Merkel’s Party, Social Democrats Win German Vote] ''The New York Times''.</ref><ref>Melissa Eddy (7 March 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/world/europe/women-finding-their-way-in-german-politics.html Women Finding Their Way in German Politics] ''The New York Times''.</ref> However, she soon announced that she did not want to become the SPD's candidate for chancellor, preferring instead to stay in her home state for the five-year term she had just won.<ref>Charles Hawley (27 September 2012), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-social-democrats-still-without-a-chancellor-candidate-a-858369.html Letter from Berlin: SPD Still Looking for a Leader to Challenge Merkel] ''[[Spiegel Online]]''.</ref>

In 2013, Kraft initially opposed national SPD leaders who opted to join Merkel as junior partner for the second time.<ref>Tony Czuczka and Rainer Buergin (25 September 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-25/merkel-allies-hold-out-on-coalition-talks-in-german-waiting-game.html Merkel Allies Hold Out on Coalition Talks in German Waiting Game] Bloomberg.</ref><ref>Birgit Jennen (7 May 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-06/rust-belt-rebel-kraft-leads-german-charge-against-merkel.html Rust-Belt Rebel Kraft Leads German Charge Against Merkel] Bloomberg.</ref> However, she subsequently was part of the SPD team led by [[Sigmar Gabriel]], which led the negotiations towards forming a new German government with Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]’s CDU/CSU bloc.<ref>Quentin Peel (30 September 2013), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/14ef84aa-29d2-11e3-9bc6-00144feab7de.html German coalition talks to start on Friday] ''Financial Times''.</ref> She headed the SPD's delegation in the energy working group and vocally defended the coal industry, which has a sizeable presence in her state; her co-chair from the CDU/CSU was [[Peter Altmaier]].<ref>Annika Breidthardt and Gernot Heller (26 October 2013), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/26/us-germany-tax-idUSBRE99P05R20131026 Germany may see higher tax revenues, could play role in talks] Reuters.</ref>

In 2014, Kraft’s government plans record spending of 62 billion euros ($85 billion) while trimming the deficit by a quarter to 2.4 billion euros.<ref>Birgit Jennen (7 May 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-06/rust-belt-rebel-kraft-leads-german-charge-against-merkel.html Rust-Belt Rebel Kraft Leads German Charge Against Merkel] Bloomberg.</ref> At the same time, she has repeatedly criticized Merkel’s austerity policies during the debt crisis.<ref>Birgit Jennen (7 May 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-06/rust-belt-rebel-kraft-leads-german-charge-against-merkel.html Rust-Belt Rebel Kraft Leads German Charge Against Merkel] Bloomberg.</ref>

In March 2014, Kraft hosted Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]] in Duisburg as he visited the last stop on the [[Yuxinou Railway]] between Europe and Asia.<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2014/03/31/2003586913 China-Europe route is new ‘silk road’] ''[[Taipei Times]]'', 31 March 2014.</ref>

Following her party’s loss in the [[2017 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|2017 state elections]], Kraft remained a member of the State Parliament where she currently serves on the Committee on Sports.<ref>[http://www.ksta.de/nrw/nrw-landtag--neue-posten-fuer-ex-landesminister--27954642 NRW-Landtag Neue Posten für Ex-Landesminister] ''[[Kölner Stadtanzeiger]]'', 11 July 2017.</ref> She also joined the supervisory board of [[RAG AG]].

==Political positions==

===Energy===
In 2012, Kraft placed investment in renewable energy at the center of her second term’s agenda, stating that more than 30 per cent of electricity in NRW should be coming from renewable sources by 2025.<ref>Quentin Peel (26 September 2012), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/22c96060-00ce-11e2-9dfc-00144feabdc0.html ‘Red-green’ victory makes waves in Berlin] ''Financial Times''.</ref> In 2013, Kraft called on [[Angela Merkel]] to use tax revenue to cut electricity costs for consumers by 25 percent.<ref>Stefan Nicola (21 March 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-21/merkel-taken-on-by-kraft-as-power-costs-open-second-crisis-front.html Merkel Taken On by Kraft as Power Costs Open Second Crisis Front] Bloomberg.</ref> On energy companies extracting oil and natural gas by the controversial practice of [[hydraulic fracturing]], or fracking, Kraft stated in 2014 that "[a]s long as I am governor in North Rhine-Westphalia, there will be no fracking for unconventional natural gas."<ref>Melissa Eddy and Stanley Reed (5 June 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/business/international/germany-may-turn-to-fracking.html Germany Leans Toward Allowing Fracking] ''The New York Times''.</ref> She also helped get a resolution through the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] on tighter rules for fracking, after visiting Canada to get a first-hand look at shale oil extraction there.<ref>Noah Barkin and Madeline Chambers (18 September 2013), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/18/germany-election-kraft-idUSL5N0HE1DN20130918 German left keeps its own Merkel waiting in the wings] Reuters.</ref>

===Tax evasion===
Early in her time in office, Kraft focused on [[tax evasion]], which is a policy that is not exclusively the reserve of the federal government and thus allowed to her to both exercise her power in her state as well as in the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], the upper house of the federal parliament, where the states are presented and the opposition had a majority at the time.<ref>Arne Delfs and Patrick Donahue (11 September 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-10/germany-s-second-most-powerful-woman-takes-on-merkel.html Germany’s Second-Most Powerful Woman Takes on Merkel] Bloomberg.</ref> In 2013, Kraft led the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] opposition to a tax agreement with [[Switzerland]], eventually blocking it as too easy on tax dodgers.<ref>Arne Delfs and Patrick Donahue (11 September 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-10/germany-s-second-most-powerful-woman-takes-on-merkel.html Germany’s Second-Most Powerful Woman Takes on Merkel] Bloomberg.</ref> Under the proposed law, Germans with untaxed wealth in Switzerland would have been able to legitimize their holdings and retain their anonymity in exchange for paying a one-off penalty charge and submitting to a future withholding tax.

===Art===
In 2013, the heir of a prominent Jewish art dealer [[Alfred Flechtheim]], who fled [[Nazi Germany]], urged the state of North Rhine-Westphalia to relinquish paintings by [[Paul Klee]] and [[Juan Gris]] that he says were lost due to Nazi persecution; Kraft declined to comment.<ref>Catherine Hickley (29 January 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-29/jewish-dealer-heir-urges-decision-on-klee-gris-artworks.html  Jewish Dealer Heir Urges Decision on Klee, Gris Artworks] Bloomberg.</ref> In 2014, Kraft rejected demands made by museum directors in North Rhine-Westphalia who sought to prevent the sale of two [[Andy Warhol]] paintings, ''Triple Elvis'' (1963) and ''Four Marlons'' (1966), by the former [[West LB]] at [[Christie's]] New York; in a letter in response to the museum directors, she held that she could not stop the sale because the paintings were not considered items of national cultural importance.<ref>Henri Neuendorf (21 October 2014), [http://news.artnet.com/in-brief/is-germany-using-warhol-sale-to-pay-off-state-debt-138918 Is Germany Using Warhol Sale to Pay Off State Debt?] ''[[artnet]]''.</ref>

===Immigration===
In summer 2015, when [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] allowed tens of thousands of asylum seekers camped out in Hungary to [[European migrant crisis#Triggers of the summer 2015 crisis|travel to Germany]], Kraft asserted that this had sent a signal to thousands of migrants to head straight for Germany; at the time, North-Rhine Westphalia was taking in around a fifth of the new arrivals.<ref>Caroline Copley (11 September 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/11/us-europe-migrants-germany-idUSKCN0RB1SI20150911 Merkel's critics grow louder as more refugees flood into Germany] Reuters.</ref>

===Relations with France===
Alongside Senator [[Catherine Troendle]], Kraft served as co-chairwoman of the German-French Friendship Group set up by the [[Bundesrat of Germany|German Bundesrat]] and the [[Senate (France)|French Senate]].

With 2014 marking the centenary of the start of [[World War I]], Kraft inaugurated a memorial for the [[Armistice Day]] in [[Ablain-Saint-Nazaire]] alongside French President [[François Hollande]] and German Defense Minister [[Ursula von der Leyen]], as well as British and Belgian officials.<ref>Natalie Muller (11 November 2014), [http://www.dw.de/hollande-von-der-leyen-europe-observe-armistice-day/a-18057098 Hollande, von der Leyen, Europe observe Armistice Day]''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.</ref>

On 26 March 2015, Kraft joined Merkel, Hollande and [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] [[Mariano Rajoy]] of Spain at the crash site of [[Germanwings Flight 9525]] in the [[Massif des Trois-Évêchés]] for a memorial; North Rhine-Westphalia was the state where the plane was headed and many of the 144 passengers lived. One day later, she and Germany's President [[Joachim Gauck]] attended a memorial service in the western town of [[Haltern]] for 16 students and two teachers from the local high school who were killed in the crash.
