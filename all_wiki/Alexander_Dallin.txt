Stemming in part from his interviews during the Harvard Project,<ref name="stan-mem-res"/> in 1957 Dallin published ''German Rule in Russia, 1941-1945'', which became the classic, definitive account of the [[German-occupied Europe|German occupation of parts of Russia during World War II]].<ref name="nyt-obit"/><ref name="sr-obit"/> It won the [[George Louis Beer Prize]] for European international history since 1895.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.historians.org/awards-and-grants/past-recipients/george-louis-beer-prize-recipients | title=George Louis Beer Prize Recipients | publisher=[[American Historical Association]] | accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref> <!-- multiple sources say it also won the Wolfson Prize for History, yet the prize wasn't created until 1972 and the book is not anywhere in the list of past winners at http://www.wolfson.org.uk/history-prize/previous-winners/ so how could that be? -->

In 1956, Dallin became an assistant professor of political science at [[Columbia University]].<ref name="uses-intro"/>  He subsequently became professor of international relations in 1961<ref name="uses-intro"/> and received the Adlai Stevenson chair in 1965.<ref name="nyt-obit"/> Dallin was director of Columbia's [[Harriman Institute|Russian Institute]] from 1962 to 1967.<ref name="nyt-obit"/> While at Columbia, he was recipient of one of the [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1961|Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1961]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/results?competition=ALL&fellowship_category=ALL&lower_bound=1961&page=1&query=&upper_bound=1961&x=21&y=8 |title=Search Results |publisher=[[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] |accessdate=January 7, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107115634/http://www.gf.org/fellows/results?competition=ALL&fellowship_category=ALL&lower_bound=1961&page=1&query=&upper_bound=1961&x=21&y=8 |archivedate=January 7, 2014 }}</ref> and a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Hays fellowship]] in 1965–66.<ref name="whos-66"/>  Dallin also served as a part-time consultant to the U.S. Government during much of the 1960s.<ref name="whos-84"/>

[[Marshall D. Shulman]], who also served as director of the Russian Institute, later noted Dallin's objectivity, saying, "In a field riven by political controversy, he was universally respected as a voice of common sense and scholarly detachment rooted in a solid historical backing."<ref name="nyt-obit"/>

==Stanford years==
In 1970, Dallin and his family left for the West Coast and he became a fellow at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] and a visiting professor at [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="uses-intro"/> In 1971, he joined the faculty of [[Stanford University]].<ref name="sr-obit"/> There Dallin became the Raymond A.

His first marriage ended in divorce and Dallin married Gail W. Lapidus, a senior fellow at Stanford's Institute for International Studies and a professor of political science.<ref name="stan-mem-res"/>  The two would frequently collaborate on his later works.<ref name="sr-obit"/>

Dallin was frequently present in open-to-the-public Center for Russian and East European Studies seminars on campus where his expertise and talent were shared. The Faculty Senate at Stanford reported that Dallin, "...chaired virtually every major committee in the field".<ref name="stan-mem-res">{{cite web | title=Memorial Resolution: Alexander Dallin | work=SenD#5220 | publisher=Stanford Faculty Senate | date=June 6, 2001 | url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/june6/dallinmeml-66.html }}</ref> He was a long-time member of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies]] and he helped re-energize the organization by bringing its headquarters to Stanford and served as its president from 1984–85.<ref name="sr-obit"/><ref name="stan-mem-res"/> Dallin had earlier been president of the Western Slavic Association from 1978–80.<ref name="whos-84"/>

David Holloway and Norman Naimark edited a [[Festschrift]] in honor of Dallin, ''Reexamining the Soviet Experience: Essays in Honor of Alexander Dallin'', published in 1996. Dallin formally retired in 1996<ref name="uses-intro"/> but continued to write, teach, and participate in academic activities.<ref name="stan-mem-res"/> He died of heart failure in [[Stanford, California]], on 22 July 2000, having suffered a stroke the day before.<ref name="nyt-obit"/>

Holloway, who succeeded to the Spruance chair, subsequently said that Dallin was "the model scholar-organizer"<ref name="sr-obit"/> and that he "had a profound and beneficial influence on the field of Soviet and East European studies. For him the study of the Soviet Union was not a question of confirming an already held point of view but rather a matter of seeking to understand a complex and changing reality."<ref name="nyt-obit"/>
