Greenwood is known for his patriotic [[signature song]] "[[God Bless the U.S.A.]]", which was originally released and successful in 1984, and became popular again during the [[Gulf War|Gulf War in 1991]] and after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]] (becoming his highest charting pop hit, reaching number 16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]). He also has charted seven number-ones on the US [[Hot Country Songs]] list in his career: "[[Somebody's Gonna Love You]]", "[[Going, Going, Gone (Lee Greenwood song)|Going, Going, Gone]]", "[[Dixie Road (song)|Dixie Road]]", "[[I Don't Mind the Thorns (If You're the Rose)]]", "[[Don't Underestimate My Love For You]]", "[[Hearts Aren't Made to Break (They're Made to Love)]]", and "[[Mornin' Ride]]". His 1983 single "I.O.U." was also a top-five hit on the adult contemporary charts, and a number 53 on the Hot 100.

==Early life==
Greenwood was born in [[South Gate, California]], a few miles south of Los Angeles. After the separation of his parents, he grew up near [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]<ref name="lgbio">{{cite web|title=Lee Greenwood bio on Greenwood's official site|url=http://www.leegreenwood.com/index.php?p=360|accessdate=2010-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912075606/http://www.leegreenwood.com/index.php?p=360|archive-date=2015-09-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> on the [[poultry]] farm of his maternal grandparents. At the age of seven, he started singing in church. In 1969, he joined the Chester Smith Band and had his first television appearance. A short time later, he worked with the country musician [[Del Reeves]].

He founded his first band, The Apollos, in 1962. The band, which changed its name later to Lee Greenwood Affair, played mostly [[popular music|pop music]] and appeared mostly in [[gambling|casino]]s in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. A few records were recorded in Los Angeles with the [[Paramount Records (1969)|Paramount]] label. After the band broke up in the 1970s, Greenwood moved back to Las Vegas, where he worked as a [[blackjack]] dealer during the day, and as a singer at night. He is well known for his meet and greets at Hyvee grocery stores.

==Career==

In 1979, he was discovered in [[Reno, Nevada]], by Larry McFaden, the [[bandleader]] and [[bassist]] of [[Mel Tillis]]. After making some demo tapes, Greenwood was signed in 1981 by the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] [[MCA Nashville Records|division]] of the [[MCA Records|MCA]] label (which had recently absorbed the Paramount label), and McFaden became his manager.

The first single, the [[Jan Crutchfield]]-penned "It Turns Me Inside Out", made it to a spot in the top 20 of the country charts. The song had been written for [[Kenny Rogers]], but Rogers turned it down due to the sheer volume of songs he had been offered at the time. "[[Ring on Her Finger, Time on Her Hands]]" landed him in the country top 10. Each song was marketed heavily, particularly in the South Florida market by MCA Account Service Representative Brad Fitzgerald, among others.

Greenwood is known for writing and recording "[[God Bless the U.S.A.|God Bless the USA]]" in the early 1980s. The song gained renewed popularity following the launch of [[Operation: Desert Storm]] in 1991,<ref>{{cite news|title=Greenwood will entertain troops on Armed Forces TV|publisher=The Daily News-Journal|date=January 24, 1991|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20935936/lee_greenwood_entertaining_troops_in/}}</ref> and again, 10 years later, following the September 11, 2001 attacks. "God Bless the USA" re-entered the top 20 of the country charts in late 2001. Since then, Greenwood has played across the US,at many public events and commemorations of the attacks.

The day before the [[inauguration of Donald Trump]], Greenwood performed at the [[Make America Great! Welcome Celebration]]. "God Bless the U.S.A." was used by [[Donald Trump]] as one of his [[campaign song]]s during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] and the [[2018 United States elections|2018 midterm elections]], and is used again during the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWtXrCBKvAg|title=FULL TRUMP RALLY: President Trump holds campaign rally in Dallas, Texas|accessdate=October 20, 2019 |date=October 17, 2019}}</ref>

==National Council on the Arts==
In November 2008, President [[George W. Bush]] appointed Greenwood to a six-year term to the National Council on the Arts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bush appoints Lee Greenwood to National Arts Council|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 3, 2008|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2008/11/lee-greenwoods.html}}</ref>

==Theater==
In 1995, Greenwood took a break from his touring schedule to spend time with just his children and his wife. In his time off, he elected to build a theater in [[Sevierville, Tennessee]], and in April 1996, the Lee Greenwood Theater opened its doors. This gave Greenwood the opportunity to perform daily shows, in addition to being with his family.<ref>{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Gary|title=The Lee Greenwood Interview|url=http://www.theharbinger.org/xv/970422/JAMES.HTM|accessdate=30 April 2017|publisher=The Harbinger|date=22 April 1997}}</ref> The theater operated for five seasons, and closed for Greenwood to continue touring. The former theater building is host to a church.

==Family==
Greenwood is married to former [[Miss Tennessee USA]] Kimberly Payne, his fourth marriage.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lee Greenwood on Why Fourth Time's the Charm|publisher=The Boot|date=March 3, 2010|url=http://theboot.com/lee-greenwood-wife|accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> They have two sons together, Dalton and Parker Greenwood.<ref name="lgbio"/>
