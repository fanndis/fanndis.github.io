"'''Drunk in Love'''" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter [[Beyoncé]] featuring her husband, American rapper [[Jay-Z]]. The duo composed the song along with credited production and writing by [[Detail (musician)|Detail]], [[Dre Moon|Andre Eric Proctor]], Rasool Diaz, [[Brian Soko]], [[Timbaland]], [[J-Roc]] and [[Boots (musician)|Boots]] for [[Beyoncé (album)|self-titled fifth studio album]] (2013). [[Columbia Records]] released "Drunk in Love" as one of the two [[lead single]]s from ''Beyoncé'' on December 17, 2013. The song was dominated by [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap]] [[Beat (music)|beats]] in chunks and [[Bass instrument|bass]]. Its lyrics, which depict [[female sexuality]], are sung by Beyoncé in a sensual and confident way.

Many music critics called the song a follow-up to Beyoncé's and Jay-Z's song "[[Crazy in Love]]" (2003). "Drunk in Love" peaked at number two on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, spending eight weeks in the top ten. It also reached the top ten in France, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. At the [[57th Grammy Awards]], "Drunk in Love" won [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance|Best R&B Performance]].

The song's [[music video]] was directed by [[Hype Williams]] and shot in [[black-and-white]] in [[Golden Beach, Florida]] at a beach front [[manse]]. The visual features scenes of the pair singing the song together. "Drunk in Love" was performed by Beyoncé and Jay-Z at the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards]]. It was later added to the set lists of the second European leg of Beyoncé's [[The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour]] in 2013 and the pair's joint [[On the Run Tour (Beyoncé and Jay-Z)|On the Run Tour]] in 2014. Numerous remixes and cover versions of the song were made, most notably the official rework by rapper [[Kanye West]]. The music video won [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Collaboration|Best Collaboration]] and was nominated for [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards]].

"Drunk in Love" was written by [[Beyoncé]], [[Detail (musician)|Detail]] and [[Jay-Z]] in end of 2012, who appears as the featured artist on the track. Production of the song was handled by [[Boots (musician)|Boots]] and Beyoncé as well as Detail. "Drunk in Love" was recorded at [[Jungle City Studios]] and at [[Oven Studios]] in [[New York City]].<ref name="credits"/> Detail approached Beyoncé with a [[Beat (music)|beat]] he had created called "Drunk" inspired by different situations from being affected by alcohol.<ref name="nbc" /><ref name="details" /> Beyoncé further helped in the production of the song, adding elements that Detail had missed.<ref name="details" /> She and Jay-Z later [[Freestyle rap|free-styled]] their verses for the song and [[Timbaland]] contributed keyboards. [[J-Roc (record producer)|J-Roc]], [[Dre Moon]], [[Brian Soko]] and Rasool Ricardo Diaz contributed to the production of the song. Elaborating on the conception of the song, Beyoncé said: "We just kinda had a party. It was so great, because it wasn't about any ego, we weren't trying to make a hit record [...] we were just having fun...and I think you can hear that in the record."<ref name="nbc">{{cite web|last=Fowler|first=Brandi|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/Beyonce_Talks_Surprise_Self-Titled_Album___I_Recorded_About_80_Songs_for_It_-237912371.html|title=Beyonce Talks Surprise Self-Titled Album: "I Recorded About 80 Songs for It"|publisher=[[WRC-TV|NBC Washington]].

In 2014, rapper [[Future (rapper)|Future]] claimed that he had previously recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo version]] of the song. He worked together with Detail who persuaded him to record vocals for the track as it would convince Beyoncé more easily to record it. Several days later, Detail informed Future that Beyoncé was in the studio recording "Drunk in Love". However, when the rapper was working on his second studio album ''[[Honest (Future album)|Honest]]'', he used the same melody of the demo version on a song called "Good Morning" as Beyoncé hadn't released her version seven months since he was told that she worked on it. When Beyoncé released her album, the track was scrapped from the track listing of ''Honest'' and Future was not mentioned in its credits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1817123/future-drunk-in-love/|title=Future Tells The Surprising Story Behind 'Drunk In Love'|publisher=[[MTV News]].

The visual is almost six and a half minutes long. As the video begins, waves are seen crashing on a night time beach. Nearly a minute later, Beyoncé appears; she is strolling on a beach at night and she seemingly carries a massive trophy while an eerie music is playing in the background. Sporting a sheer negligee that reveals her bra and panties beneath, she twists her body in the sand. The singer also dances seductively against a backdrop of smoke and mouths the song's lyrics, staring at the camera. Beyoncé is later joined by husband Jay-Z, who is wearing a T-shirt and a backwards baseball cap. He raps with his eyes down holding a glass with alcohol in his hand while Beyoncé mouths the words behind him, smiling. The last seconds of the video show Beyoncé dancing and it concludes with close-up shots of the singer's face.
