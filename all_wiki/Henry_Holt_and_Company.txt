'''Henry Holt and Company''' is an [[United States|American]] book publishing company based in [[New York City]]. One of the oldest publishers in the United States, it was founded in 1866 by [[Henry Holt (publisher)|Henry Holt]] and [[Frederick Leypoldt]].<ref>Nancy Lewis Tuten. ''The Robert Frost Encyclopedia''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=47NFEPDDBMgC&pg=PA149 pg.149]</ref> Currently, the company publishes in the fields of American and international [[fiction]], [[biography]], [[history]] and [[politics]], [[science]], [[psychology]], and [[health]], as well as books for children's literature. In the US, it operates under [[Macmillan Publishers#Macmillan in the United States|Macmillan Publishers]].

==History==
[[File:Henry Holt and Company logo 1904 red.png|thumb|left|Logo of Henry Holt and Company, as it appeared in the book ''[[:s:In the Dwellings of the Wilderness|In the Dwellings of the Wilderness]]'' by [[Charlotte Bryson Taylor]] (1904).]]

The company publishes under several imprints including Metropolitan Books, [[Times Books]], Owl Books and [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]]. It also publishes under the name of Holt Paperbacks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.macmillan.com/publishers/henry-holt/|title=Henry Holt|website=US Macmillan|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref>

The company has published works by renowned authors [[Erich Fromm]], [[Paul Auster]], [[Hilary Mantel]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Herta Müller]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], and [[Noam Chomsky]].

From 1951 to 1985, Holt published the magazine ''[[Field & Stream]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inewsdesign.com/2011/10/28/hunting-fishing/|title=Hunting, fishing…|last=Opalic|first=Zoran|date=2011-10-28|website=iNewsDesign|language=en|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/business/media/john-backe-dies-at-83-put-cbs-back-atop-prime-time.html|title=John Backe Dies at 83; Put CBS Back Atop Prime Time|last=Roberts|first=Sam|date=2015-10-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-19|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Holt merged with [[Rinehart & Company]] of New York and the [[John C. Winston Company]] of Philadelphia in 1960 to become [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]. ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported on March 1 that Holt stockholders had approved the merger, last of the three approvals. "Henry Holt is the surviving concern, but will be known as Holt, Rinehart, Winston, Inc."<ref>"Henry Holt Merger". ''The Wall Street Journal''. March 1, 1960. Page 12.</ref>

[[CBS]] purchased the company in 1967. But in 1985 the group split, and the retail publishing arm along with the Holt name was sold to the [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]] based in [[Stuttgart]], which has retained Holt as a subsidiary publishing under its original name and in the US it is part of [[Macmillan Publishers#Macmillan in the United States|Macmillan Publishers]].
The educational publishing arm, which retained the Holt, Rinehart and Winston name, was sold to [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt]].
