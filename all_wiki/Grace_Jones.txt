'''Grace Beverly Jones''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OJ}} (born 19 May 1948) is a Jamaican model, singer, songwriter, record producer and actress.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/grace-jones-carry-yourself-with-class-1.2842556|title=Grace Jones: 'Carry yourself with class'|website=Irishtimes.com|access-date=13 October 2018}}</ref> 
In 1999, Jones ranked 82nd on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll'', and in 2008, she was honored with a [[Q Awards|Q Idol Award]]. Jones influenced the [[cross-dressing]] movement of the 1980s and has been an inspiration for artists including [[Annie Lennox]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Rihanna]], [[Solange (singer)|Solange]], [[Lorde]], [[Róisín Murphy]], [[Brazilian Girls]], [[Nile Rodgers]], [[Santigold]], and [[Basement Jaxx]]. In 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''  magazine ranked her as the 40th greatest [[Dance Club Songs|dance club]] artist of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-top-dance-club-artists|title=Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists : Page 1|website=Billboard.com}}</ref>

Born in British Jamaica, she and her family moved to [[Syracuse, New York]], when she was 13. Jones began her [[Model (person)|modelling]] career in New York state, then in [[Paris]], working for [[fashion house]]s such as [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves St. Laurent]] and [[Kenzo (brand)|Kenzo]], and appearing on the covers of ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. She worked with photographers such as [[Jean-Paul Goude]], [[Helmut Newton]], [[Guy Bourdin]], and [[Hans Feurer]], and became known for her distinctive [[androgynous]] appearance and bold features.

Beginning in 1977, Jones embarked on a music career, securing a record deal with [[Island Records]] and initially becoming a star of [[New York City]]'s [[Studio 54]]-centered [[disco]] scene. In the early 1980s, she moved toward a [[new wave music|new wave]] style that drew on [[reggae]], [[funk]], [[post-punk]] and [[pop music]], frequently collaborating with both the graphic designer [[Jean-Paul Goude]] and the musical duo [[Sly & Robbie]]. Her most popular albums include ''[[Warm Leatherette (album)|Warm Leatherette]]'' (1980), ''[[Nightclubbing (Grace Jones album)|Nightclubbing]]'' (1981), and ''[[Slave to the Rhythm (album)|Slave to the Rhythm]]'' (1985). She scored Top 40 entries on the [[UK Singles Chart]] with "[[Pull Up to the Bumper]]", "[[I've Seen That Face Before (Libertango)|I've Seen That Face Before]]", "[[Private Life (song)|Private Life]]", and "[[Slave to the Rhythm (Grace Jones song)|Slave to the Rhythm]]". In 1982, she released the [[music video]] collection ''[[A One Man Show]]'', directed by Goude.

Jones appeared in some low-budget films in the US during the 1970s and early 1980s. In 1984, she made her first mainstream appearance as Zula in the fantasy-action film ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' alongside [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]], and subsequently appeared in the 1985 [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] movie ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' as May Day. In 1986, she played a [[vampire]] in ''[[Vamp (film)|Vamp]]'', and acted in and contributed a song to the 1992 [[Eddie Murphy]] film ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]''. She appeared alongside [[Tim Curry]] in the 2001 film ''[[Wolf Girl (2001 film)|Wolf Girl]]''. For her work in ''Conan the Destroyer'', ''A View to a Kill'', and ''Vamp'', she was nominated for [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Saturn Awards for Best Supporting Actress]].

===1974–79: Transition to music, and early releases===
{{BLP sources section|date=November 2015}}
Jones was signed by [[Island Records]], who put her in the studio with disco record producer, [[Tom Moulton]]. Moulton worked at [[Sigma Sound Studios]] in [[Philadelphia]], and ''[[Portfolio (Grace Jones album)|Portfolio]]'', was released in 1977. The album featured three songs from Broadway musicals, "[[Send in the Clowns]]" by [[Stephen Sondheim]] from ''[[A Little Night Music]]'', "[[What I Did for Love (A Chorus Line)|What I Did for Love]]" from ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' and "[[Tomorrow (1977 song)|Tomorrow]]" from ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]''. The second side of the album opens up with a seven-minute reinterpretation of [[Édith Piaf]]'s "[[La Vie en rose]]" followed by three new recordings, two of which were co-written by Jones, "Sorry", and "That's the Trouble". The album finished with "[[I Need a Man (Grace Jones song)|I Need a Man]]", Jones's first club hit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Grace-Jones-Portfolio/release/1717094 |title=Grace Jones – Portfolio (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs |website=Discogs.com |access-date=24 May 2012}}</ref> The artwork to the album was designed by [[Richard Bernstein (artist)|Richard Bernstein]], an artist for ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]''.

In 1978, Jones and Moulton made ''[[Fame (album)|Fame]]'', an immediate follow-up to ''Portfolio'', also recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. The album featured another reinterpretation of a French classic, "[[Autumn Leaves (1945 song)|Autumn Leaves]]" by [[Jacques Prévert]]. The Canadian edition of the vinyl album included another French language track, "Comme un oiseau qui s'envole", which replaced "All on a Summers Night"; in most locations this song served as the B-side of the single "[[Do or Die (Grace Jones song)|Do or Die]]".  In the North American club scene, ''Fame'' was a hit album and the "Do or Die"/"Pride"/"Fame" side reached top 10 on both the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] and Canadian Dance/Urban charts. The album was released on compact disc in the early 1990s, but soon went [[out of print]]. In 2011, it was released and remastered by Gold Legion, a record company that specialises in reissuing classic disco albums on CD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shop.goldlegion.com/Grace-Jones-Fame-GLDN56226.htm |title=Grace Jones Fame |access-date=21 August 2012 |website=Shop.goldlegion.com}}</ref> Jones's live shows were highly sexualized and flamboyant, leading her to be called "Queen of the Gay Discos."<ref name="allmusic"/>

''[[Muse (Grace Jones album)|Muse]]'' was the last of Jones's disco albums. The album features a re-recorded version "I'll Find My Way to You", which Jones released three years prior to ''Muse''. Originally appearing in the 1976 Italian film, ''[[Colt 38 Special Squad]]'' in which Jones had a role as a club singer, Jones also recorded a song called "Again and Again" that was featured in the film. Both songs were produced by composer [[Stelvio Cipriani]]. Icelandic keyboardist Thor Baldursson arranged most of the album and also sang duet with Jones on the track "Suffer". Like the last two albums, the cover art is by Richard Bernstein. Like ''Fame'', ''Muse'' was later released by Gold Legion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shop.goldlegion.com/Grace-Jones-Muse-GLGN-56227.htm |title=Grace Jones Fame |access-date=21 August 2012 |website=Shop.goldlegion.com}}</ref>

=== 1980–85: Breakthrough, ''Nightclubbing'', and acting ===
With anti-disco sentiment spreading, and with the aid of the [[Compass Point All Stars]], Jones transitioned into [[new wave music]] with the 1980 release of ''[[Warm Leatherette (album)|Warm Leatherette]]''. The album included covers of songs by [[The Normal]] ("[[Warm Leatherette (song)|Warm Leatherette]]"), [[The Pretenders]] ("[[Private Life (song)|Private Life]]"), [[Roxy Music]] ("[[Love Is the Drug]]"), [[Smokey Robinson]] ("[[The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game]]"), [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] ("[[Breakdown (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song)|Breakdown]]") and [[Jacques Higelin]] ("Pars"). Sly Dunbar revealed that the title track was also the first to be recorded with Jones.<ref name="41b">{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldofgracejones.com/41b.html |title=The World of Grace Jones |access-date=26 May 2012 |website=Theworldofgracejones.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114010822/http://www.theworldofgracejones.com/41b.html |archive-date=14 November 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldofgracejones.com/46b.html |title=The World of Grace Jones |access-date=26 May 2012 |website=Theworldofgracejones.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114011344/http://www.theworldofgracejones.com/46b.html |archive-date=14 November 2011 }}</ref> Tom Petty wrote the lyrics to "Breakdown", and he also wrote the third verse of Jones's reinterpretation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sadclownrep.com/7538/3349-breakdown-by-grace-jones/ |title=3349.

The 1981 release of ''[[Nightclubbing (Grace Jones album)|Nightclubbing]]'' included Jones's covers of songs by [[Flash and the Pan]] ("[[Walking in the Rain (Flash and the Pan song)|Walking in the Rain]]"), [[Bill Withers]] ("[[Use Me (Bill Withers song)|Use Me]]"), [[Iggy Pop]]/[[David Bowie]] ("[[Nightclubbing (song)|Nightclubbing]]") and [[Ástor Piazzolla]] ("[[I've Seen That Face Before (Libertango)|I've Seen That Face Before]]"). Three songs were co-written by Jones: "Feel Up", "Art Groupie" and "[[Pull Up to the Bumper]]". [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] wrote "[[Demolition Man (song)|Demolition Man]]"; he later recorded it with [[The Police]] on the album ''[[Ghost in the Machine (The Police album)|Ghost in the Machine]]''. "I've Done It Again" was written by [[Marianne Faithfull]]. The strong rhythm featured on ''Nightclubbing'' was produced by Compass Point All Stars, including [[Sly and Robbie]], [[Wally Badarou]], [[Mikey Chung]], [[Uziah Thompson|Uziah "Sticky" Thompson]] and [[Barry Reynolds]]. The album entered in the Top 5 in four countries, and became Jones's highest-ranking record on the US [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] mainstream albums and R&B charts.

''Nightclubbing'' claimed the number 1 slot on ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s Album of the Year list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/1981.html |title=Rocklist.net...NME End of Year Lists 1981... |access-date=28 May 2012 |website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk}}</ref> ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' listed the album at No. 40 on its list of Best Albums of the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/feature/best-albums-of-the-1980s/308/page_7 |title=Best Albums of the 1980s |access-date=18 March 2012 |website=Slantmagazine.com}}</ref> ''Nightclubbing'' is now widely considered Jones's best studio album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sadclownrep.com/7479/3333-walking-in-the-rain-by-grace-jones/ |title=3333.

[[File:Gracejones.jpg|thumb|left|Jones performing in 2007]]

Having already recorded two reggae-oriented albums under the production of Compass Point All Stars, Jones went to [[Nassau, Bahamas]] in 1982 and recorded ''[[Living My Life (album)|Living My Life]]''; the album resulted in Jones's final contribution to the Compass Point trilogy, with only one cover, [[Melvin Van Peebles]]'s "[[The Apple Stretching]]". The rest were original songs; "[[Nipple to the Bottle]]" was co-written with [[Sly Dunbar]], and, apart from "[[My Jamaican Guy]]", the other tracks were collaborations with [[Barry Reynolds]]. Despite receiving a limited single release, the [[Living My Life (song)|title track]] was left off the album.

Jones's three albums under the production of the Compass Point All Stars resulted in Jones's ''[[A One Man Show|One Man Show]]'', a [[performance art]]/pop theatre presentation devised by Goude and Jones in which she also performed tracks from the albums ''[[Portfolio (Grace Jones album)|Portfolio]]'' ("[[La Vie en rose#Grace Jones version|La Vie en rose]]"), ''[[Warm Leatherette (album)|Warm Leatherette]]'', ("[[Private Life (song)|Private Life]]", "[[Warm Leatherette]]"), ''[[Nightclubbing (Grace Jones album)|Nightclubbing]]'' ("Walking in the Rain", "Feel Up", "Demolition Man", "Pull Up to the Bumper" and "I've Seen That Face Before (Libertango)") and from ''Living My Life'', "My Jamaican Guy" and the album's [[Living My Life|title track]].

After Jones's success as a mainstream actress, she returned to the studio to work on ''[[Slave to the Rhythm (album)|Slave to the Rhythm]]'', the last of her recordings for [[Island records|Island]]. [[Bruce Woolley]], Simon Darlow, [[Stephen Lipson]] and [[Trevor Horn]] wrote the material, and it was produced by Horn and Lipson. It was a concept album that featured several interpretations of the title track. The project was originally intended for [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] as a follow-up to "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]", but was given to Jones.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.perfectsongs.com/artists_writers/trevor_horn.html| title = Perfect Songs artists/writers Trevor Horn| access-date = 12 February 2012| work = perfectsongs.com| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111128004400/http://www.perfectsongs.com/artists_writers/trevor_horn.html| archive-date = 28 November 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref> All eight tracks on the album featured excerpts from a conversation with Jones, speaking about many aspects of her life.

After her success with ''Slave to the Rhythm'', Island released ''[[Island Life]]'', Jones's first best-of compilation, which featured songs from most of her releases with Island (''Portfolio'', ''Fame'', ''Warm Leatherette'', ''Nightclubbing'', ''Living My Life'' and ''Slave to the Rhythm''). American writer and journalist [[Glenn O'Brien]] wrote the essay for the inlay booklet. The compilation charted in the UK, New Zealand and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Li: Island Life|url=http://www.libraryofinspiration.com/music_1980s_islandlife.htm|publisher=Library of Inspiration}}</ref> The artwork on the cover of the compilation was of another Jones/Goude collaboration; it featured Jones's celestial body in a montage of separate images, following Goude's ideas on creating credible illusions with his cut-and-paint technique.

{{BLP sources section|date=November 2015}}

After ''[[Slave to the Rhythm (album)|Slave to the Rhythm]]'' and ''[[Island Life]]'', Jones started to record again under a new contract with [[Manhattan Records]], which resulted in ''[[Inside Story (Grace Jones album)|Inside Story]]'', Jones teamed up with music producer [[Nile Rodgers]] of [[Chic (band)|Chic]], whom Jones had previously tried to work with during the disco era.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.disco-disco.com/tributes/chic.shtml |title=Nile & Bernard - Chic - Tribute @ Disco-Disco.com |access-date=19 April 2012 |website=Disco-disco.com}}</ref> The album was recorded at Skyline Studios in New York and post-produced at Atlantic Studios and Sterling Sound. ''Inside Story'' was the first album Jones produced, which resulted in heated disputes with Rodgers. Musically, the album was more accessible than her previous albums with the Compass Point All Stars, and explored different styles of pop music, with undertones of jazz, gospel, and Caribbean sounds. All songs on the album were written by Jones and [[Bruce Woolley]]. Richard Bernstein teamed up with Jones again to provide the album's artwork. ''Inside Story'' made the top 40 in several European countries. The album was Jones's last entry to date on US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart.

Despite several comeback attempts throughout the 1990s, Jones's next full-length record was released almost twenty years later, after Jones decided "never to do an album again,"<ref>{{cite news |author=Michael Osborn |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7747522.stm |title=An audience with Grace Jones |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=26 November 2008 |access-date=11 January 2012}}</ref> changing her mind after meeting music producer [[Ivor Guest, 4th Viscount Wimborne|Ivor Guest]] through a mutual friend, [[milliner]] [[Philip Treacy]].

{{Quote box
| quote  = "Grace was very open. We worked together to create this intimidating character. I mean, she's naturally intimidating anyway with her body shape, very straight neck, prominent cheekbones, and clean-cut jawline. She's [[feminine]], no doubt about that, but I've always thought that she was far more beautiful without the artifices she employed to make herself more feminine. I tried to emphasize that body shape through a sort of minimalist [[German expressionism]], with its games of shadows and its angular shapes. Grace is from Jamaica, so she speaks English in a quite thought-out way. I also advised her to address her audience – mostly composed of [[homosexuals]] – like a teacher would, with severity. All of that stuff contributed to the building of her image.  "

Jones's "appearance was equally divisive" as the sonic fluidity of her music - with her "striking visuals [leading] to her becoming a muse for the likes of [[Issey Miyake]] and [[Thierry Mugler]].<ref name="idmag">{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Jake|date=21 April 2016|title=exploring the complicated relationship between jean-paul goude and grace jones|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/exploring-the-complicated-relationship-between-jean-paul-goude-and-grace-jones|access-date=8 August 2016|work=[[i-D]]|publisher=[[Vice Media]]}}</ref> Her image has been described as "neo-[[cubist]]".<ref name="Gardner88" /> Jones's distinctive androgynous appearance, square-cut, angular padded clothing, manner, and height of 179&nbsp;cm (5'10 1/2"){{cn|date=November 2019}} influenced the [[cross-dressing]] movement of the 1980s.

Kyle Munzenrieder of ''[[W (magazine)|W]]'' magazine wrote that "everyone from [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] to [[Björk]] to [[Beyoncé]] to [[Lady Gaga]] has taken more than a few pages from her playbook[.]"<ref>{{cite web|last=Munzenrieder|first=Kyle|title=See Grace Jones Wearing a Shrub-like Hat on the Red Carpet|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/grace-jones-veil-red-carpet|access-date=13 October 2018|website=Wmagazine.com}}</ref> Jones's work is often discussed for its visual aspect, which was largely the work of French illustrator, photographer, and graphic designer [[Jean-Paul Goude]]. According to Jake Hall of ''[[i-D]]'', "their collaborative work [went on] to define the visual landscape of the 70s and 80s," and "the artist helped create one of the most intriguing legends in musical history."<ref name="idmag" /> Goude saw Jones as his [[muse]], declaring she was "beautiful and [[grotesque]] at the same time,"<ref name="p4kfurman">{{cite web|last1=Furman|first1=Anna|date=7 November 2016|title=The Stories Behind the Photos on 6 Iconic Album Covers|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1353-the-stories-behind-the-photos-on-6-iconic-album-covers/|access-date=8 November 2016|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]}}</ref> and dated her from 1977 to 1984.

Jones was featured prominently in Goude's work from that period, "which, over the course of the '80s, became increasingly synonymous with willful distortion" - using a technique he refers to as "French correction".<ref name="nymag14" /> The artist stated in 2012: "chopping up photos and rearranging them in a montage to elongate limbs or exaggerate the size of someone's head or some other aspect appealed to me on a lot of levels – I'm always searching for equilibrium, symmetry, and rhythm in an image."<ref name="vicewessang">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.vice.com/read/jean-paul-goude-is-still-ahead-of-his-time|title=Jean-Paul Goude Is Still Ahead of His Time|last1=Wessang|first1=Adeline|date=2 April 2012|magazine=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|access-date=8 November 2016}}</ref> Goude's work "centers around artistic depictions of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[ethnicity]], and global culture", with an "enchantment with the far-away and the exotic".<ref name="idmag" /> As a result, much of his depictions of black women are considered controversial and exploitative,<ref name="idmag" /><ref name="p4kfurman" /> as Jones was presented as "a white man's rendition of the African feminine."<ref name="Gardner88">Gardner, 2012. p.88</ref> Goude's images depicted her [[hypersexualized]] and [[androgynous]], emphasizing her "[[Black people|blackness]]" and [[Jamaica]]n heritage. Writer Abigail Gardner felt Jones's body "was presented and manipulated in ways that are clearly congruent with conceiving of that display as artefactual."<ref name="Gardner88" /> Essentially, Hall writes, "Goude treated Jones as an artistic vehicle first and foremost - a [[hyperbole]] which, despite destroying their personal relationship, allowed Goude to translate his grandiose vision of Jones the phenomenon into a series of imagery which painted her as a [[surrealism|surreal]], impossible muse.<ref name="idmag" />

It has been noted that Jones's ties with the 1970s and 1980s New York art scene are important in understanding her visual identity during this period, and she was close to [[Andy Warhol]], who created a number of paintings and other works of the singer.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pink Grace Jones by Andy Warhol|url=https://curiator.com/art/andy-warhol/grace-jones|access-date=2 March 2018|website=Curiator|language=en}}</ref><ref name="Interview Magazine">{{Cite news|date=1 February 2018|title=The time Grace Jones was Andy Warhol's wedding date - Interview Magazine|language=en-US|work=Interview Magazine|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/obvious-history-time-grace-jones-andy-warhols-wedding-date|access-date=2 March 2018}}</ref> She also knew artist [[Richard Bernstein (artist)|Richard Bernstein]], and artist and social activist, [[Keith Haring]], who painted her head-to-toe for a series of photographs taken by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] and for her role in the 1986 film ''[[Vamp (film)|Vamp]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tate|title='Grace Jones', painted by Keith Haring.

===Music===
''Vice'' described Jones's musical output as "weird, vibrant and progressive," stating that she "has woven [[disco]], [[new wave music|new wave]], [[post punk]], [[art-pop]], [[industrial music|industrial]], [[reggae]], and [[gospel music|gospel]] into a tight sound that is distinctly hers, threaded together with lilting, powerful vocals."<ref name="DJones">{{cite magazine|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/5945d5/guide-to-getting-into-grace-jones|title=The Guide to Getting Into Grace Jones|magazine=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|last=Jones|first=Daisy|date=2 August 2018|access-date=15 November 2018}}</ref> Her early music was rooted in disco. She opted for a new wave sound in the early 1980s. She recorded a series of albums (1980's ''[[Warm Leatherette (album)|Warm Leatherette]]'' through 1982's ''[[Living My Life (album)|Living My Life]]'') backed by the Jamaica [[rhythm section]] duo [[Sly and Robbie]]. Her music during this era was described as a new wave hybrid of reggae, [[funk]], [[Pop music|pop]], and [[rock music|rock]].<ref name="p4k-review1"/> According to [[John Doran (writer)|John Doran]] of [[BBC Music]], ''Warm Leatherette'' and ''Nightclubbing'' were "post-punk pop" albums that, "delved into the worlds of disco, reggae and funk much more successfully than most of her 'alternative' contemporaries, while still retaining a blank-eyed alienation that was more reminiscent of David Bowie or [[Ian Curtis]] than most of her peers."<ref name="BBC">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/vzd3/|title=Grace Clubbing - Nightclubbing review|last1=Doran|first1=John|year=2010|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=3 August 2016}}</ref>

Jones has a [[contralto]] vocal range. She sings in two modes: either in her monotone speak-sing voice as in songs such as "[[Private Life (song)|Private Life]]", "[[Walking in the Rain (Flash and the Pan song)|Walking in the Rain]]" and "[[The Apple Stretching]]", or in an almost-[[soprano]] mode in songs such as "[[La Vie en Rose]]", "[[Slave to the Rhythm (Grace Jones song)|Slave to the Rhythm]]", and "[[Victor Should Have Been a Jazz Musician]]". Jones's voice spans 4 octaves, 1 note and a semitone from the low note of C<sub>2</sub> (in "Corporate Cannibal") to the high note of E{{flat}}<sub>6</sub> (in "Slave to the Rhythm).<ref name="clashmusic">{{cite web |url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/10-things-you-never-knew-about-grace-jones |title=10 Things You Never Knew About...

==Personal life==
Jones's father was strict and their relationship was strained. According to his particular denomination's beliefs, one should only use one's singing ability to glorify God.<ref name="Sawyer" /> Bishop Robert W. Jones died on 7 May 2008.<ref name="auto"/> Her mother, Marjorie, always supported Jones's career (she sings on "[[Williams' Blood]]" and "[[My Jamaican Guy]]") but could not be publicly associated with her music.<ref name="Sawyer" /> Marjorie's father, William, was also a musician, and played with [[Nat King Cole]].<ref name="Sawyer" />

Jones described her childhood as having been "crushed underneath the Bible",{{sfn|Jones|Morley|2015|p=45}} and since has refused to enter a Jamaican church due to her bad childhood experiences.{{sfn|Jones|Morley|2015|p=41}}

Through her relationship with longtime collaborator [[Jean-Paul Goude]], Jones has one son, Paulo. From Paulo, Jones has one granddaughter.<ref name="clashmusic"/> Jones married Atila Altaunbay in 1996.  She disputes rumors that she married Chris Stanley in her 2015 memoir ''I'll Never Write My Memoirs'', saying, "The truth is, I only ever married one of my boyfriends, Atila Altaunbay, a Muslim from Turkey."
