{{Communication}}
'''Communication studies''' or '''communication sciences''' is an [[academic discipline]] that deals with processes of [[human communication]] and [[Human behavior|behavior]], patterns of communication in [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relationships]], [[social interaction]]s and communication in different [[Culture|cultures]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Calhoun|first=Craig|date=2011|title=Communication as Social Science (and More)|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=5|pages=1479–1496|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> Communication is commonly defined as giving, receiving or exchanging ideas, information, signals or messages through appropriate [[Media (communication)|media]], enabling individuals or groups to persuade, to seek information, to give information or to express emotions effectively.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Communication in everyday life : personal and professional contexts|last=Ferguson, Sherry Devereaux|others=Lennox Terrion, Jenepher, 1963-|isbn=978-0-19-544928-0|location=Don Mills, Ontario, Canada|oclc=861207333|date = March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Organizational Behavior|last=Bauer|first=Talya|publisher=FlatWorld|year=2015|isbn=978-1-4533-7118-3|location=Boston, MA|pages=227–242}}</ref> Communication studies is a [[social science]] that uses various methods of [[Empirical method|empirical investigation]] and [[critical analysis]] to develop a body of knowledge that encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation at a level of individual [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] and interaction to [[social]] and [[Cultural studies|cultural]] communication systems at a macro level.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=Robert T.|date=1999-05-01|title=Communication Theory as a Field|url=https://academic.oup.com/ct/article/9/2/119/4201776|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=119–161|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.1999.tb00355.x|issn=1050-3293}}</ref><ref name=":02">{{Cite book|title=The presentation of self in everyday life|last=Goffman, Erving|isbn=978-0-385-09402-3|edition=Anchor books|location=Garden City, New York|oclc=256298|year=1959|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/presentationofse00goff_0}}</ref>

Scholarly communication theorists focus primarily on refining the [[theoretical]] understanding of communication, examining [[statistics]] in order to help substantiate claims. The range of social scientific methods to study communication has been expanding. Communication [[Researchers questioning the mainstream media account of 9/11|researchers]] draw upon a variety of [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] techniques. The [[Linguistic turn|linguistic]] and [[Cultural turn|cultural turns]] of the mid-20th century led to increasingly [[Verstehen|interpretative]], [[hermeneutic]], and [[philosophic]] approaches towards the analysis of communication.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Statistical methods for communication science|last=Hayes, Andrew F.|date=2005|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|isbn=978-1-4106-1370-7|location=Mahwah, N.J.|oclc=320950289}}</ref> Conversely, the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s have seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically, and computationally rigorous techniques.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shannon|first=C.

== History ==
{{Main|History of communication studies}}

=== Origins ===
Communication, a natural human behavior, became a topic of study in the 20th century.<ref name=":22">{{Cite book|title=A first look at communication theory|last=Griffin, Emory A.|others=Ledbetter, Andrew,, Sparks, Glenn Grayson|isbn=978-1-260-13243-4|edition=Tenth|location=New York, NY|oclc=1010662990|date = 2018-03-05}}</ref> As communication technologies developed, so did the serious study of communication. When [[World War I]] ended, the interest in studying communication intensified. The social science study was fully recognized as a legitimate discipline after [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Getting the message : a history of communications|last=Solymar, L. (Laszlo)|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-850333-4|location=Oxford|oclc=40602884}}</ref>

Prior to being established as its own discipline, communication studies, was formed from three other major studies: psychology, sociology, and political science.<ref name=":122" /><ref name=":22" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Bannerman|first1=Sara|last2=Haggart|first2=Blayne|date=2014-10-27|title=Historical Institutionalism in Communication Studies: Historical Institutionalism in Communication Studies|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1111/comt.12051}}</ref> Communication studies focus on communication as central to the human experience, which involves understanding how people behave in creating, exchanging, and interpreting messages.<ref>Jefferson D. Pooley, “The New History of Mass Communication Research,” in History of Media and Communication Research: Contested Memories, edited with David Park (New York: Peter Lang, 2008)</ref>

=== Foundations of the academic discipline ===
The institutionalization of communication studies in U.S. higher education and research has often been traced to [[Columbia University]], the [[University of Chicago]], and the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]], where early pioneers of the field worked after the [[2nd World War]].<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4">William F. Eadie, "Communication as an Academic Field: USA and Canada," in International Encyclopedia of Communication, ed. Wolfgang Donsbach, Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008.</ref><ref name="obit2"></ref>

[[Wilbur Schramm]] is considered the founder of the field of communication studies in the United States.<ref name="obit2">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/01/obituaries/wilbur-schramm-wrote-many-works-on-communications.html|title=Wilbur Schramm; Wrote Many Works On Communications|date=1 January 1988|work=New York Times}}</ref> Schramm was hugely influential in establishing communications as a field of study and in forming departments of communication studies across universities in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Communication History|last=Simonson|first=Peter|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0415892599|location=New York}}</ref> He was the first individual to identify himself as a communication scholar; he created the first academic degree-granting programs with communication in their name; and he trained the first generation of communication scholars.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McAnany|first=Emile G.|date=1988|title=Wilbur Schramm, 1907-1987: Roots of the Past, Seeds of the Present|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ379811|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=38|issue=4|pages=109–22|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1988.tb02073.x}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Everett M.|date=2001-09-01|title=The department of communication at Michigan state university as a seed institution for communication study|journal=Communication Studies|volume=52|issue=3|pages=234–248|doi=10.1080/10510970109388556|s2cid=142732423|issn=1051-0974}}</ref> Schramm had a background in English literature and developed communication studies partly by merging existing programs in speech communication, rhetoric, and journalism. He also edited a textbook ''The Process and Effects of Mass Communication'' (1954) that helped define the field, partly by claiming [[Paul Lazarsfeld]], [[Harold Lasswell]], [[Carl Hovland]], and [[Kurt Lewin]] as its founding fore fathers.<ref name="obit2" />

Schramm established three important communication institutes: the [[UIUC College of Media|Institute of Communications Research]] (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), the Institute for Communication Research ([[Stanford University]]), and the [[East–West Center|East-West]] Communication Institute ([[Honolulu]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Danielson|first=Wayne|date=1997|title=The Beginnings of Communication Study in America: A Personal Memoir|journal=Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|volume=73|issue=4|pages=890–910}}</ref> The patterns of scholarly work in communication studies that were set in motion at these institutes continue to this day.<ref name="The Free Press2">{{cite book|title=A History of Communication Study: A Biological Approach|last1=Rogers|first1=Everett|date=1994|publisher=The Free Press|location=NY|page=29}}</ref> Many of Schramm's students, such as [[Everett Rogers]] and [[David Berlo]] went on to make important contributions of their own.<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Diffusion of innovations|last=Rogers, Everett M.|date=2003|publisher=Free Press|isbn=0-7432-2209-1|edition=5th|location=New York|oclc=52030797|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/diffusionofinnov00roge}}</ref>

The first college of communication was founded at [[Michigan State University]] in 1958, led by scholars from Schramm's original [[UIUC College of Media|ICR]] and dedicated to studying communication scientifically using a quantitative approach.<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-03-16-9603160107-story.html|title=DAVID KENNETH BERLO|last=Tribune|first=Chicago|website=chicagotribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref> MSU was soon followed by important departments of communication at [[Purdue University]], [[University of Texas-Austin]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of Iowa]], [[University of Illinois]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[The University of Southern California]], and [[Northwestern University]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ely|first=Donald|date=1960|title=The Communications School: Neophyte in Higher Education|journal=Audio Visual Communication Review|volume=8|issue=5|pages=20–27|via=JSTOR}}</ref><ref name=":6">Simonson, Peter; Peters, John Durham (2008-06-05), "Communication and Media Studies, History to 1968", ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication'', John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-8640-7}}, retrieved 2019-12-02</ref>

Associations related to Communication Studies were founded or expanded during the 1950s. The National Society for the Study of Communication (NSSC) was founded in 1950 to encourage scholars to pursue communication research as a social science.<ref name=":4" /> This Association launched the [[Journal of Communication]] in the same year as its founding. Like many communication associations founded around this decade, the name of the association changed with the field. In 1968 the name changed to the [[International Communication Association]] (ICA).<ref name=":6" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=The history of speech communication : the emergence of a discipline, 1914-1945|last=Cohen|first=Herman|date=1995|publisher=Speech Communication Association|isbn=0-944811-14-0|location=Annandale, Va|oclc=667177896}}</ref>

== Scope and topics ==
{{Main|Outline of communication}}
Communication studies integrates aspects of both social sciences and the humanities. As a [[social science]], the discipline overlaps with [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[political science]], [[economics]], and [[public policy]].<ref name=":0" /> From a [[humanities]] perspective, communication is concerned with [[rhetoric]] and [[persuasion]] (traditional graduate programs in communication studies trace their history to the rhetoricians of [[Ancient Greece]]).<ref>{{Cite book|title=ROUTLEDGE HANDBOOK OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION.|date=2019|publisher=ROUTLEDGE|isbn=978-0-367-36773-2|location=[S.l.]|oclc=1107565954}}</ref> Humanities approaches to communication often overlap with [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[English literature|English]], and [[cultural studies]].

Communication research informs [[Politician|politicians]] and [[Public policy|policy makers]], [[Education|educators]], [[Strategist|strategists]], [[Legislator|legislators]], [[Business magnate|business magnates]], [[Management|managers]], [[Social worker|social workers]], [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations]], [[Non-profit organization|non-profit organizations]], and people interested in resolving communication issues in general.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Organizational communication : approaches and processes|last=Miller, Katherine, 1959-|isbn=978-1-285-16420-5|edition=Seventh|location=Stamford, Connecticut|oclc=864086905|date = January 2014}}</ref> There is often a great deal of crossover between [[Social research and methods|social research]], cultural research, [[market research]], and other statistical fields.

===In the United States===
Undergraduate curricula aim to prepare students to interrogate the nature of communication in society, and the development of communication as a specific field.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morreale|first1=Sherwyn|last2=Osborn|first2=Michael|last3=Pearson|first3=Judy|date=2000|title=Why Communication is Important: A Rationale for the Centrality of the Study of Communication|url=https://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/Chairs_Corner/Making_the_Case_for_and_Advancing_the_Discipline/PDF-ATD-JACA-Why_Communication_is_Important_%20Rationale_for_Centrality_of_the_Study_of_Communication.pdf|journal=Journal of the Association for Communication Administration|publisher=National Communication Association|volume=29|pages=1–25|access-date=2016-09-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105235213/https://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/Chairs_Corner/Making_the_Case_for_and_Advancing_the_Discipline/PDF-ATD-JACA-Why_Communication_is_Important_%20Rationale_for_Centrality_of_the_Study_of_Communication.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[National Communication Association]] (NCA) recognizes nine distinct but often overlapping sub-disciplines within the broader communication discipline:{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} [[technical communication|technology]], critical-cultural, [[health communication|health]], [[intercultural communication|intercultural]], [[interpersonal communication|interpersonal]]-small group, mass communication, [[organizational communication|organizational]], [[political communication|political]], rhetorical, and [[environmental communication]]. Students take courses in these subject areas. Other programs and courses often integrated in communication programs include{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} [[journalism]], [[film criticism]], [[theatre]], [[public relations]], [[political science]] (e.g., political campaign strategies, public speaking, effects of media on elections), as well as [[radio]], [[television]], [[computer-mediated communication]], [[film production]], and [[new media]].

=== In Canada ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}
With the early influence of federal institutional inquiries, notably the 1951 [[Massey Commission]], which "investigated the overall state of culture in Canada,"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/massey-commission-emc|title=Massey Commission {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}</ref> the study of communication in Canada has frequently focused on the development of a cohesive national culture, and on infrastructural empires of social and material circulation. Although influenced by the American Communication tradition and [[British Cultural Studies]], Communication studies in Canada has been more directly oriented toward the state and the policy apparatus, for example the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]. Influential thinkers from the Canadian communication tradition include [[Harold Innis]], [[Marshall McLuhan]], Florian Sauvageau, Gertrude Robinson, Marc Raboy, [[Dallas Smythe]], [[James R. Taylor]], [[François Cooren]], [[Gail Guthrie Valaskakis]] and [[George Grant (philosopher)|George Grant]].
