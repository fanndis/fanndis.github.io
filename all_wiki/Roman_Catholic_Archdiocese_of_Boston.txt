The '''Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston''' ({{lang-la|Archidioecesis Bostoniensis}}) is an ecclesiastical territory or [[Archdiocese]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]  in the [[New England]] region of the [[United States]]. It comprises several counties of the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] of [[Massachusetts]]. It is led by a [[prelate]] [[archbishop]] who serves as [[pastor]] of the [[mother church]], [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross (Boston)|Cathedral of the Holy Cross]] in the South End of Boston.

As of 2017, there are 288 [[parish]]es in the archdiocese.<ref>http://www.thebostonpilot.com/article.asp?ID=179672</ref>  In 2007, the archdiocese estimated that more than 1.8 million Catholics were in the territory, of whom about 315,000 regularly attended Mass.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kerber |first=Ross |title=Bless you, we take Visa |work=The Boston Globe |date=January 29, 2007 |url=https://www.boston.com/business/personaltech/articles/2007/01/29/bless_you_we_take_visa/?page=2 |access-date=January 29, 2007}}</ref>

==History==
The original Diocese of Boston was canonically erected on April 8, 1808 by [[Pope Pius VII]]. It took its territories from the larger historic [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Diocese of Baltimore]] and consisted of the states of [[Connecticut]], (future) [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]] and [[Vermont]].

In the nineteenth century, as [[Catholicism]] grew [[exponential growth|exponentially]] in New England, the Diocese of Boston was carved into smaller new dioceses: on November 28, 1843, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] erected the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford|Diocese of Hartford]]; [[Pope Pius IX]] erected the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington|Diocese of Burlington]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland|Diocese of Portland]] on July 29, 1853, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield in Massachusetts|Diocese of Springfield]] on June 14, 1870, and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence|Diocese of Providence]] on February 16, 1872. On February 12, 1875, [[Pope Pius IX]] elevated the diocese to the rank of an archdiocese.

In the 1920s, Cardinal William O'Connell moved the [[Diocesan chancery|chancery]] from offices near Holy Cross Cathedral in the South End to 127 Lake Street in [[Brighton, Massachusetts|Brighton]].<ref name="changes2007">[http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2007/05/24/changes_come_to_lake_street/ Changes come to Lake Street]. ''The Boston Globe'', May 24, 2007</ref> "Lake Street" was a [[Metonymy|metonym]] for the Bishop and the office of the Archdiocese.<ref name="changes2007" />

=== Clergy sexual abuse scandal and settlements ===
At the beginning of the 21st century the archdiocese was shaken by [[sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Boston|accusations of sexual abuse by clergy]] that culminated in the resignation of its archbishop, Cardinal [[Bernard Francis Law]], on December 13, 2002. In September 2003, the archdiocese settled over 500 abuse-related claims for $85 million.<ref>{{cite news

In June 2004, the archbishop's residence and the [[Diocesan chancery|chancery]] in [[Brighton, Massachusetts|Brighton]] and surrounding lands were sold to [[Boston College]], in part to defray costs associated with abuse cases.<ref>[https://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories5/042104_sale.htm Diocesan headquarters sold to BC] The Boston Globe, April 21, 2004.</ref><ref>[https://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories5/042104_statement.htm Statement of the Archdiocese of Boston and Boston College on sale of part of Brighton campus] The Boston Globe, April 20, 2004.]</ref><ref>Oslin, Reid,
[http://www.bc.edu/publications/chronicle/TopstoriesNewFeatures/features/construction090910.html "Campus Construction Update: Stokes, Brighton Campus Projects Begin"], ''The Boston College Chronicle'', September 9, 2010</ref> The offices of the Archdiocese were moved to [[Braintree, Massachusetts]]. The diocesan seminary, [[Saint John's Seminary (Massachusetts)|Saint John's Seminary]], remains on the property in Brighton.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of the Archdiocese, shown in the information box to the right at the top of this article, has a blue shield with a gold cross and a gold "trimount" over a silver and blue "Barry-wavy" at the base of the shield.  The "trimount" of three ''coupreaux'' represents the City of Boston, the original name of which was Trimountaine in reference to the three hills on which the city is was built.  The cross, ''fleurettée'', honors the Cathedral of the Holy Cross while also serving as a reminder that the first bishop of Boston and other early ecclesiastics were natives of France. The "Barry-wavy" is a symbol of the sea, alluding to Boston's role as a major seaport whose first settlers came from across the sea.<ref>[https://www.bostoncatholic.org/historical-sketch-archdiocese-boston/coat-arms Description of coat of arms] on the web site of the Archdiocese of Boston.</ref>

==Communications media==
The diocesan newspaper ''[[The Pilot (Massachusetts newspaper)|The Pilot]]'' has been published in Boston since 1829.

The Archdiocese's ''Catholic Television Center'', founded in 1955, produces programs and operates the cable television network [[CatholicTV]]. From 1964 to 1966, it owned and operated a broadcast television station under the call letters [[WSBK-TV|WIHS-TV]].
