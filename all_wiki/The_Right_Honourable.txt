{{short description|Honorific prefix}}
{{distinguish|The Honourable}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}'''The Right Honourable''' ([[abbreviation]]: '''The Rt Hon.''' or '''Rt Hon.''') is an [[honorific]] [[Style (manner of address)|style]] traditionally applied to certain persons and collective bodies in the [[United Kingdom]], the former [[British Empire]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The term is predominantly used today as a style associated with the holding of certain senior public offices in the United Kingdom, Canada, Kenya, The Bahamas and New Zealand.

"Right" in this context is an [[adverb]] meaning "thoroughly" or "very".

Privy Counsellors are appointed for life by the monarch, on the advice of the prime minister. All members of the British Cabinet (technically a committee of the Privy Council) are appointed to the Privy Council, as are certain other senior ministers in the government, senior members of the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]], and leaders of the major political parties. The Privy Council thus includes all current and former members of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]], excepting those who have resigned from the Privy Council. The first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also so appointed, as is the leader of the largest opposition party in the [[Scottish Parliament]].

In order to differentiate [[peerage|peers]] who are Privy Counsellors from those who are not, the [[Post-nominal letters|suffix]] "PC" should be added after the name (according to [[Debrett's|''Debrett's Peerage'']]).<ref>Kidd, Charles, ''Debrett's Peerage & Baronetage 2015 Edition'', London, 2015, Forms of Addressing Persons of Title, pp.56-60, p.60</ref><ref name="DebrettPC">[[Debrett's]] recommends the use of the post-nominal letters "PC" in a social style of address for a peer who is a Privy Counsellor.{{Cite web |title=Privy Counsellors and Crown Appointments |url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/hierarchies/letters-after-name/privy-counsellors-and-crown-appointments |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528100708/http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/hierarchies/letters-after-name/privy-counsellors-and-crown-appointments |archive-date=28 May 2016 |access-date=15 June 2015 |website=Debrett’s}}</ref><ref name="Debretts">{{Cite web |title=Privy counsellors |url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/privy-counsellors |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630042729/http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/privy-counsellors |archive-date=30 June 2015 |access-date=24 May 2015 |publisher=[[Debretts]]}}</ref> This is not however considered correct by ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]''.<ref>' Privy Counsellors'.

In the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|members]] are not permitted to address each other directly or name other members, but must instead address the Speaker and refer to each other indirectly by their job. A non-[[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] member is thus "my hon. Friend (the member for ''constituency'')" if in the same party as the person speaking, and "the hon. Member/Gentleman/Lady (the member for ''constituency'')" otherwise. ("Honourable" is abbreviated as "hon." in [[Hansard]].) "Honourable" becomes "right honourable" for those members entitled to this style, in particular Privy Counsellors. Members with government or opposition jobs may be referred to as such, for example "my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer", "the right hon. Lady, the Leader of the Opposition", "his right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for ''Department''", "the Secretary of State" (where this is unambiguous, such as while asking questions of a minister), or "the Prime Minister". Other honorifics are used in addition for those members in relevant professions:

* The Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty (the former [[Board of Admiralty]])
* The Right Honourable the Lords of the Committee of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] appointed for the consideration of all matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations (the [[Board of Trade]])

See also the collective use of "[[the Most Honourable]]", as in "The Lords of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council" (the [[Privy Council]]).

===Canada===
{{Further|Canadian honorifics}}
In Canada, occupants of only the three most senior public offices are styled as "The Right Honourable" ({{Lang|fr|Le/La très honorable}} in French). Formerly, this was by virtue of their appointment to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]]. However, Canadian appointments to the British Privy Council were ended by the government of [[Lester Pearson]]. Currently, individuals who hold, or have held, one of the following offices are awarded the style of Right Honourable for life:

* [[Governor General of Canada]]
* [[Prime Minister of Canada]]
* [[Chief Justice of Canada]]

"The Right Honourable" is not to be confused with "His/Her Excellency", used by governors general during their term of office, or "[[The Honourable]]", used only while in office by provincial [[Premier (Canada)|premiers]] and cabinet ministers, and for life by [[Senate of Canada|senators]] and members of the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] (chiefly cabinet ministers, as well as other figures such as party leaders or provincial premiers who may be appointed from time to time).

The title may also be granted for life by the Governor General to eminent Canadians who have not held any of the offices that would otherwise entitle them to the style. This has been done on two occasions: to eight prominent political figures to mark the 125th anniversary of [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1992, and again upon the retirement of longtime politician [[Herb Gray]] in 2002.

The following individuals have been granted the title as an honorific:
* [[Paul Martin Sr.]] (1992) — cabinet minister (Minister of External Affairs), Member of Parliament, senator and diplomat
* [[Martial Asselin]] (1992) — federal cabinet minister,  Member of Parliament, senator (Speaker of the Senate) and [[Lieutenant Governor of Quebec]]
* [[Ellen Fairclough]] (1992) — federal cabinet minister and Member of Parliament; first [[women in Canadian politics|woman in Canadian politics]] ever appointed to cabinet
* [[Jean-Luc Pépin]] (1992) — federal cabinet minister and Member of Parliament; chair of Anti-Inflation Board and co-chair of Task Force on Canadian Unity
* [[Alvin Hamilton]] (1992) — federal cabinet minister and Member of Parliament
* [[Don Mazankowski]] (1992) — deputy prime minister, federal cabinet minister and Member of Parliament
* [[Jack Pickersgill]] (1992) — federal cabinet minister, Member of Parliament, and senior civil servant (Assistant Private Secretary and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister, Clerk of the Privy Council; chair of the Canadian Transport Commission)
* [[Robert Stanfield]] (1992) — federal Opposition Leader and Member of Parliament, provincial MLA and Premier of Nova Scotia
* [[Herb Gray]] (2002) — deputy prime minister, federal cabinet minister, and Member of Parliament; the longest-serving MP in Canadian history

Over the years, a number of prominent Canadians became members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and thus were entitled to use the style of Right Honourable, either because of their services in Britain (e.g. serving as envoys to London) or as members of the [[Imperial War Cabinet]], or due to their prominence in the [[Canadian Cabinet]]. These included all but three of Canada's early prime ministers ([[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]], [[John Abbott]], and [[Mackenzie Bowell]]), who governed before the title was used domestically.

===New Zealand===
Previously in [[New Zealand]] the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]] and some other senior cabinet ministers were customarily appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] and thus styled ''The Right Honourable''.<ref name="NZGRtHon.">{{cite web|title=The Right Honourable |url= https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/overview/rthon|website=www.dpmc.govt.nz|publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=30 April 2017|language=en-NZ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408180916/http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/overview/rthon|archive-date= 8 April 2017}}</ref>

In her resignation honours, the former prime minister [[Helen Clark]] did not recommend the appointment of any new Privy Counsellors. In 2009 it was announced that her successor, [[John Key]], had decided not to make any further recommendations to [[the Crown]] for appointments to the Privy Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/docs/Honours_Q_and_A.pdf|title=Honours Q and A |year=2009 |accessdate=29 June 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110603234727/http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/docs/Honours_Q_and_A.pdf|archive-date= 3 June 2011}}</ref>

In August 2010, the [[Monarchy of New Zealand|Queen of New Zealand]] announced that, with immediate effect, individuals who hold, and those persons who after the date of the signing of these rules are appointed to, the following offices are awarded the style ''The Right Honourable'' for life:<ref name="NZGRtHon." />
* the [[Governor-General of New Zealand]]
* the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]]
* the [[Chief Justice of New Zealand]]
* the [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives]]

This change was made because the practice of appointing New Zealanders to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom had ceased. However, the change had little immediate effect, as all but two of the holders or living former holders of the offices granted the style had already been appointed to the Privy Council.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2010/RTNZ.aspx|title=Use of the title 'The Right Honourable' in New Zealand, 2 August 2010|date=2 August 2010|publisher=The Queen's Printer|accessdate=3 August 2010 |url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100805071452/http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2010/RTNZ.aspx|archive-date= 5 August 2010}}</ref><ref>This did not apply to former governor-generals Sir [[Paul Reeves]], Dame [[Catherine Tizard]] and Dame [[Silvia Cartwright]] and former speakers Sir [[Kerry Burke]], Sir [[Robin Gray (New Zealand politician)|Robin Gray]], Sir [[Peter Tapsell (New Zealand politician)|Peter Tapsell]], Sir [[Doug Kidd]] and [[Margaret Wilson]]</ref>

The living New Zealanders holding the style ''The Right Honourable'' as a result of membership of the Privy Council are:

==Minor or historic title==
===Australia===
In Australia, the [[lord mayor]]s of [[Adelaide]], [[Brisbane]], [[Hobart]], [[Melbourne]], [[Perth]] and [[Sydney]] are entitled to be styled "The Right Honourable" while in office.

Historically, a number of Australians were entitled to the style as members of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]]. Appointment to the Australian equivalent of the Privy Council, the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], does not entitle a person to the style. Typical appointees to the Imperial Privy Council included senior politicians and judges at state and federal level. [[Malcolm Fraser]] in 1976 was the most recent prime minister to accept appointment to the Privy Council and thus to be styled "The Right Honourable". Of his 21 predecessors, only four were not members of the Privy Council – [[Alfred Deakin]] (declined appointment), [[Chris Watson]] (never offered), [[Arthur Fadden]] (accepted after leaving office), and [[Gough Whitlam]] (declined appointment). The last Governor-General to be entitled to the style was [[Ninian Stephen|Sir Ninian Stephen]], who left office in 1988. The last active politician to be entitled to the style was [[Ian Sinclair]], who retired in 1998. The few Australian recipients of British peerages were also entitled to the style.

Present-day Australian governments no longer recommend Australians for elevation to the peerage or appointment to the Privy Council. However, some present-day Australian citizens either hold hereditary peerages (e.g. [[Malcolm Murray, 12th Earl of Dunmore]]) or have been awarded [[life peer]]ages on the recommendation of the UK government (e.g. [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford]]).

===Ireland===
Members of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] were entitled to be addressed as ''The Right Honourable'', even after the Privy Council ceased to have any functions or to meet on the creation of the [[Irish Free State]] in December 1922. Nevertheless, the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]], like some of his counterparts in Great Britain, retained the use of the honorific style as a result of its having been conferred separately by legislation; in 2001 it was removed, as a consequence of [[local government]] law reform.
