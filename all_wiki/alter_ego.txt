[[File:Structural-Iceberg all.svg|thumb|Egos]]
An '''alter ego''' ([[Latin]] for "other I") means an alternative [[Self (psychology)|self]], which is believed to be distinct from a person's normal or true original [[Personality psychology|personality]]. Finding one's alter ego will require finding one's other self, one with a different personality. The altered states of the ego may themselves be referred to as ''alterations''.  A distinct meaning of ''alter ego'' is found in the [[Literary criticism|literary analysis]] used when referring to fictional literature and other narrative forms, describing a key [[Character (arts)|character]] in a story who is perceived to be intentionally representative of the work's author (or creator), by oblique similarities, in terms of [[psychology]], behavior, speech, or thoughts, often used to convey the author's thoughts. The term is also sometimes, but less frequently, used to designate a [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] "twin" or "best friend" to a character in a story.  Similarly, the term ''alter ego'' may be applied to the role or persona taken on by an actor<ref>{{cite book|title=Psychology and Performing Arts | author=Glenn Daniel Wilson |year=1991|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=90-265-1119-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3shEzj0wccgC&q=%22Alter+ego%22+psychology&pg=PA272}}</ref> or by other types of performers.

== Origin ==
[[Cicero]] coined the term as part of his philosophical construct in 1st-century [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], but he described it as "a second self, a trusted friend".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/alter+ego|title=Alter Ego|last=|first=|year=2009|work=Collins English Dictionary - Complete and Unabridged 10th Edition|publisher=William Collins Sons & Co. Ltd.|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>

The existence of "another self" was first fully recognized in the 18th century, when [[Anton Mesmer]] and his followers used [[hypnosis]] to separate the alter ego.<ref>J Haule, ''Jung in the 21st Century II'' (2010) p. 88</ref> These experiments showed a behavior pattern that was distinct from the personality of the individual when he was in the [[waking state]] compared with when he was under hypnosis. Another character had developed in the altered state of [[consciousness]] but in the same body.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pedersen|first=David|title=Cameral Analysis: A Method of Treating the Psychoneuroses Using Hypnosis|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London, U.K.|isbn=0-415-10424-6|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U8GkPGW8KyYC&q=psychological+phenomenon+of+the+Alter+ego&pg=PA20}}</ref>

[[Freud]] throughout his career would appeal to such instances of dual consciousness to support his thesis of the unconscious.<ref>S Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 1995) p. 21</ref> He considered that “We may most aptly describe them as cases of a splitting of the mental activities into two groups, and say that the same consciousness turns to one or the other of these groups alternately”.<ref>S Freud ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 172</ref> Freud considered the roots of the phenomenon of the alter ego to be in the [[Narcissism|narcissistic stage]] of early childhood.<ref>S Freud, 'The Uncanny' ''Imago'' V (1919) p. 41</ref> [[Heinz Kohut]] would identify a specific need in that early phase for mirroring, by another which resulted later in what he called the “twinship or alter ego transference”.<ref>H Kohut, ''How Does Analysis Cure?'' (London 1984) p. 192-3</ref>

*The title characters in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s thriller ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' represent an exploration of the concept that good and evil exist within one person, constantly at war.<ref>I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge 1995) p. 263</ref> Edward Hyde represents the doctor's other self, a [[psychopathy|psychopath]] who is unrestrained by the conventions of civilized society, and who shares a body with the doctor. The names "Jekyll and Hyde" have since become synonymous with a split personality or an ''alter ego'' that becomes capable of overpowering the original self.
*In the novel ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas]], the main character [[Edmond Dantes]] after escaping from the [[Chateau d'If]] assumes the other three alter egos. The count of Monte Cristo, the Italian abbe called Giacomo Busoni, and the Englishman Lord Wilmore. In the novel, the Count of Monte Cristo rewards those who had been good to him while punishing those who contributed in one way or the other to his imprisonment. He leads M. Danglars to lose all his fortune, M. de Villefort to his madness, Fernand Mandego to commit suicide, and others more to their fate.
*In the 1999 Indian Malayalam Film ''[[Ustaad (1999 film)|Ustaad]]'', Written by [[Ranjith (director)|Ranjith]] and directed by [[Sibi Malayil]], [[Mohanlal]] plays the character of Ustaad, which is an alter ego of the character Parameswaran.
*[[Norman Douglas]] in the late 1890s wrote a short story, "The Familiar Spirit", about a man who became aware while drowning of a conformist [[True self and false self|second self]] – "the presence within him of this Spirit, his ''alter ego'', which is bent on crushing his ambition".<ref>N. Douglas, ''Looking Back'' (London 1934) p. 274</ref>
*In [[comic books]], superheroes and their [[secret identity|secret identities]] are often considered the ''alter egos''. The [[archetype|archetypal]] comic book hero, [[Superman]], assumes the identity of the "mild-mannered" newspaper reporter [[Clark Kent]]  to live among the citizens of Metropolis without arousing suspicion. ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' comic book series further complicates this theme, as [[Bruce Banner]] loses control to the Hyde-like Hulk whenever he becomes angry, yet also depends upon the Hulk's superpowers to combat villains. Comic book-inspired ''alter egos'' can be seen in other forms of popular fiction, including television and movie adaptations of comic books, parodies of this genre, and unrelated fiction.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
*In the film and novel ''[[Fight Club]]'', [[Narrator (Fight Club)|the narrator]] has an alter ego he loses control of, [[Tyler Durden]].

* In Pretty Little Liars is Vivian Darkbloom the alter ego of [[Alison Dilaurentis]].
*Several famous musicians have adopted alter egos over the years, usually to indicate a new creative direction or a deep dive into their emotions removed from their popular stage persona—notable examples being [[David Bowie]] (with [[Ziggy Stardust (character)|Ziggy Stardust]] and [[Aladdin Sane (character)|Aladdin Sane]]) and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] (with Camille).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rollingstoneindia.com/origin-stories-musics-biggest-alter-egos/|title=The Origin Stories of Music's Biggest Alter Egos|last=Kotrial|first=Utsav|date=August 30, 2018|website=Rolling Stone|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 16, 2019}}</ref> Particularly during the 2000s, several big-name singers dedicated album eras to reveal their alter egos, including [[Janet Jackson]] with [[Damita Jo (album)|Damita Jo]], [[Mariah Carey]] with [[The Emancipation of Mimi]], and [[Beyoncé]] with [[I Am... Sasha Fierce|I Am ... Sasha Fierce]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/madonna-madame-x/|title=Madonna: Madame X Album Review|last=Juzwiak|first=Rich|date=June 18, 2019|website=Pitchfork|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 16, 2019}}</ref> Many rappers have also employed alter egos, notably [[Eminem]], [[Lil' Kim]], and [[Nicki Minaj]], among others.
