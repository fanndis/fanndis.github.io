==History==
[[File:Hughandhazeldarlinglawlibrary.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Hugh and Hazel Darling Law Library, UCLA School of Law]]
Founded in 1949, the UCLA School of Law is the third oldest of the five [[Law school in the United States|law schools]] within the [[University of California]] system.

In the 1930s, initial efforts to establish a law school at UCLA went nowhere as a result of resistance from UC President [[Robert Gordon Sproul]], and because UCLA's supporters eventually refocused their efforts on first adding [[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA|medical]] and [[UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science|engineering schools]].<ref name="Dundjerski1">{{cite book |last1=Dundjerski |first1=Marina |title=UCLA: The First Century |date=2011 |publisher=Third Millennium Publishing |location=Los Angeles |isbn=9781906507374 |page=117 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbLr-4QteEYC&pg=PA117 |accessdate=24 February 2019}}</ref>

During the mid-1940s, the impetus for the creation of the UCLA School of Law emerged from outside of the UCLA community.  Assemblyman William Rosenthal of [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles|Boyle Heights]] (on the other side of Los Angeles from UCLA) conceived of and fought for the creation of the first public law school in [[Southern California]] as a convenient and affordable alternative to the expensive [[USC Gould School of Law|private law school at USC]].<ref name="Dundjerski1" /><ref name="Rastorfer">{{cite journal |last1=Rastorfer |first1=Renee Y. |title=Thomas S.

The search for the law school's first dean was difficult and delayed its opening by a year.<ref name="Dundjerski2" />  UCLA's Law School Planning Committee prioritized merit, while the then-conservative [[Regents of the University of California]] prioritized political beliefs.<ref name="Rastorfer" />  Another factor was a simultaneous deanship vacancy at [[UC Berkeley School of Law|Berkeley Law]].<ref name="Dundjerski2" />  Near the end of 1948, the Committee finally identified a sufficiently conservative candidate willing to take the job: L. Dale Coffman, then the dean of [[Vanderbilt University Law School]].<ref name="Rastorfer" />  The Regents believed Coffman would help bring balance to the UCLA campus, which they saw as overrun by [[Communist Party USA|Communists]].<ref name="Rastorfer" />

Dean Coffman was able to recruit several distinguished faculty to UCLA, including [[Roscoe Pound]], [[Brainerd Currie]], Rollin M. Perkins, and Harold Verrall.<ref name="Rastorfer" /><ref name="Dundjerski2" />  To build a [[law library]], he hired Thomas S. Dabagh, then the law librarian of the Los Angeles County Law Library.<ref name="Rastorfer" /><ref name="Dundjerski2" /> The UCLA School of Law officially opened in September 1949 in temporary quarters in former military barracks behind Royce Hall, and moved into a permanent home upon the completion of the original Law Building in 1951.<ref name="Rastorfer" /><ref name="Dundjerski2" /><ref name="Dewey" />

Coffman's deanship did not end well, due to his vindictive and strongly prejudiced personality.<ref name="Rastorfer" /><ref name="Dundjerski2" /><ref name="Dewey" />  One sign of early trouble was when he drove out Dabagh in 1952 after they could not bridge their fundamental differences over how to run the law library, which was widely regarded around the UCLA community as contributing to Dabagh's early death in 1959.<ref name="Rastorfer" /> On September 21, 1955, the faculty revolted in the form of a memorandum to Chancellor [[Raymond B. Allen]] alleging that Coffman was categorically [[Antisemitism|refusing to hire Jews]] or anyone he perceived to be leftist, and that the school's reputation was deteriorating because Coffman's abrasive personality had led to excessive faculty [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]].<ref name="Rastorfer" /><ref name="Dewey" />  On May 24, 1956, Coffman was stripped of his deanship after a lengthy investigation by a panel of deans of his biases and his "dictatorial, undemocratic, and autocratic" management style.<ref name="Rastorfer" />  He remained on the faculty until his forced retirement in 1973, but continued to face allegations as late as 1971 that he was "an unreconstructed [[McCarthyism|McCarthyite]] and [[Racial segregation in the United States|pro-segregationist]]."<ref name="Dewey" />

Coffman's successor was Richard C. Maxwell, who served as the second dean of UCLA Law from 1958 to 1969.<ref name="Moidel">{{cite journal |last1=Moidel |first1=Selma Moidel |title=The UCLA School of Law - Origin, Conflict, and Growth |journal=California Legal History |date=2016 |volume=11 |pages=1–6 |url=https://www.cschs.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Legal-Hist-v.-11-Introduction.pdf |accessdate=24 February 2019}}</ref>  Dean Maxwell "presided over happier, more harmonious years of institutional growth,"<ref name="Dewey" /> and it was under his deanship that UCLA became "the youngest top-ranked law school in the country."<ref name="Moidel" />  Dabagh's successor, Louis Piacenza, was able to grow the law school's library collection to 143,000 volumes by May 1963, which at that time was the 14th largest law school library in the United States.<ref name="Dewey" />

By 1963, the law school had 600 students in a building designed for 550, and the Law Building's deficiencies had become all too evident, such as a complete lack of [[air conditioning]].<ref name="Dewey" />  In October 1963, the law school administration announced a major remodeling and expansion project, which added air conditioning and a new wing to the building. During the 1960s, the law school grew so quickly that the new wing was already insufficient upon its completion in January 1967.<ref name="Dewey" /> From its founding to the end of the 20th century, UCLA Law struggled with severe overcrowding, as librarians, faculty, staff, and as many as 18 student organizations—at one point, more than any other law school in the United States—competed for limited space in the Law Building for books, classes, conferences, and offices.<ref name="Dewey" /> 

The chronic space shortage was ultimately relieved by the addition of a wing for clinical education <ref>{{Cite web|last=Loyola Law School|first=|date=|title=Loyola Law School dean biography|url=https://www.swlaw.edu/faculty/full-time/susan-prager|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>and, after four grueling years of construction, completion of the new Hugh and Hazel Darling Law Library on January 22, 2000.<ref name="Dewey" />

Under Dean Maxwell, the faculty size tripled, from 12 to 37 professors, and the school hired its first female and African-American faculty members. Under Deans Murray Schwartz, who led the school from 1969 to 1975, and William Warren, who served as dean from 1975 to 1982, the school became a pioneer in clinical legal education,<ref>{{Cite web|last=UCLA School of Law|first=|date=July 13, 2020|title=UCLA School of Law History|url=https://law.ucla.edu/about-ucla-law/history|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> developing a skills-based approach that remains among the school’s hallmarks.

Students, too, broke new ground. In 1973, they created a network of student-run legal clinics first known as El Centro Legal de Santa Monica, which continues to provide pro bono services around Los Angeles with 15 separate clinics. <ref>{{Cite web|last=El Centro Legal|first=|date=July 13, 2020|title=El Centro Legal|url=https://law.ucla.edu/life-ucla-law/student-organizations/el-centro-legal-clinics|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> 

In the 1990s and through subsequent years, the school established several centers of excellence that focus on education and advocacy in specific fields. The school’s [https://law.ucla.edu/academics/centers/critical-race-studies Critical Race Program] was the first law school school center in the country to formalize the study of race and justice. The [https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/ Williams Institute] is a leading organization for research and analysis of LGBT legal issues. The [https://law.ucla.edu/academics/centers/david-j-epstein-program-public-interest-law-policy David J.

==Academics==
UCLA Law has approximately 1,000 students in its [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) program and 200 students in its Masters of Law (LL.M.) program, which is popular among foreign students intending to take the California Bar Exam. It also offers a Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.) program for students who already have a J.D. and hope to become law professors, as well as a Master of Legal Studies<ref>{{Cite web|last=UCLA Newsroom|first=|date=July 13, 2020|title=UCLA Law Creates Master of Legal Studies Degree|url=https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-law-creates-master-of-legal-studies-degree|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> program for those who do not seek a law degree, but find a legal education an important complement to their professional obligations.

The school was a pioneer in clinical legal education and today offers a strong experiential education program. Through clinical courses and related offerings, the school gives students the opportunity to directly represent clients in a variety of settings while under expert supervision. UCLA Law's clinics also provide service to many people who cannot afford to pay for their own legal services, including veterans, the homeless, and indigent individuals appearing in criminal and immigration courts. In 2017, the school opened the [https://law.ucla.edu/academics/clinical-and-experiential-programs/documentary-film-legal-clinic/ Documentary Film Legal Clinic] and [https://law.ucla.edu/academics/clinical-and-experiential-programs/music-industry-clinic/ Music Industry Clinic], which provide legal services to aspiring visual journalists, musicians and entrepreneurs in the arts, and the [https://law.ucla.edu/academics/clinical-and-experiential-programs/veterans-legal-clinic/ Veterans Justice Clinic] at the [[West Los Angeles VA Medical Center]].

UCLA Law offers the first [https://law.ucla.edu/centers/social-policy/critical-race-studies/about/ Critical Race Studies] program in the country, focusing on the intersection between race and law. It also has a robust public interest program. Its most prominent centers, programs and institutes include the Center for Immigration law and Policy, Critical Race Studies program, the [https://law.ucla.edu/centers/social-policy/david-j-epstein-program-in-public-interest-law-and-policy/about/ David J.

Students can elect to specialize in Business Law and Policy, Entertainment Law, Environmental Law, Public Interest Law, Critical Race Studies, and Law and Philosophy. The roughly 300 students who begin Law School at UCLA every year are divided into sections to encourage a sense of community. Students take all of their first year courses with their sections.<ref>Cynthia L. Cooper, ''The Insider's Guide to the Top Fifteen Law Schools'' (New York: Doubleday, 1990), 343 & 345.</ref>

Several joint degree programs are available, which require four years of study and result in the simultaneous award of a [[Juris Doctor]] and master's degree in Afro-American Studies, American Indian Studies, Law and Management, Public Health, Public Policy, Philosophy, Social Welfare, and Urban Planning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/academics/degrees-and-specializations/|title=Joint Degree Programs|last=|first=|date=|work=UCLA Law School website|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}</ref>
