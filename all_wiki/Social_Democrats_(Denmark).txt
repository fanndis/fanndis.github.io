It first formed a government after the [[1924 Danish Folketing election]] under [[Thorvald Stauning]], the longest-serving [[List of Prime Ministers of Denmark|Danish Prime Minister]] of the 20th century. During Stauning's government which lasted until the [[1926 Danish Folketing election]], the Social Democrats exerted a profound influence on [[Danish society]], laying the foundation of the Danish [[welfare state]].

== Overview ==
The party traces its own history back to the International Labour Association, founded in 1871 and banned in 1873, loosely re-organised in the Social Democratic Labour Party which in 1876 issued the Gimle program, but as a formal political party it was first founded in 1878 as the Social Democratic Federation. This name was formally carried by the party for almost a hundred years, although in practice it also used a number of other names until it changed its name to Social Democracy in 1965. At a congress in [[Aalborg]] in 2002, the party changed its name to the Social Democrats, but from 2016 again only Social Democracy is used.<ref name="name1"/><ref name="name2"/>

The party has the letter A as a symbol, but the abbreviation S is often used in the media. The party's classic symbol is a [[Rose (symbolism)|red rose]] and in recent times an A in a red circle. Aside from the classical socialist [[red]] colour<!-- #C9002D -->,<ref>{{cite news|last=Hagelskjær|first=Christian Made|date=3 March 2017|url=http://maerkesag.dk/valgkamp-har-mange-nuancer-af-roed/|title=Valgkamp har mange nuancer af rød|newspaper=Maerkesag|language=Danish|accessdate=11 May 2020}}</ref> the party has recently adopted a more light red colour called [[Orange (colour)|competition orange]].<!-- #F04D46 --><ref>{{cite news|last=Mortensen|first=Søren|date=16 September 2014|url=https://www.bt.dk/politik/socialdemokraterne-aendrer-den-roede-farve-her-er-partiets-nye-kuloer|title=Socialdemokraterne ændrer den røde farve: Her er partiets nye kulør|newspaper=B.T.|language=Danish|accessdate=11 May 2020}}</ref>

== History ==
{{expand section|date=December 2013}}

=== 19th century ===
[[File:Election poster Social Democrats Denmark.jpg|thumb|1932 general election poster]]
The party was founded as in 1871 by [[Louis Pio]], [[Harald Brix]] and [[Paul Geleff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kb.dk/da/nb/materialer/smaatryk/polprog/Socialdemokraterne/index.html|title=Socialdemokraterne – Socialdemokratiet|publisher=Det Kongelige Bibliotek|language=Danish|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref> The goal was to organise the emerging [[working class]] on a [[Democratic socialism|democratic and socialist]] basis. The [[industrialisation]] of Denmark had begun in the mid-19th century and a period of rapid [[urbanisation]] had led to an emerging class of [[Proletariat|urban workers]]. The social-democratic movement emerged from the desire to give this group [[political rights]] and [[Representation (politics)|representation]] in the [[Folketing]], the Danish [[parliament]]. In 1876, the party held an annual conference, adopting the first party manifesto.

The stated policy was as follows: {{quote|The Danish Social Democratic Labour Party works in its national form, but is convinced of the international nature of the labour movement and ready to sacrifice everything and fulfill all obligations to provide: Freedom, equality and brotherhood among all nations.}}

In 1884, the party had their first two members of parliament elected, namely [[Peter Thygesen Holm]] and [[Chresten Hørdum]].

=== 20th century ===
In 1906, the party created the Social Democratic Youth Association, lasting until 1920 when the [[Social Democratic Youth of Denmark]] and current party's [[youth wing]] was founded.

In the [[1924 Danish Folketing election]], the party won the majority with 36.6 percent of the vote and its first government was put in place with [[Thorvald Stauning]] as [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/86834:Danmark--Den-skjulte-forskel|title=Den skjulte forskel|work=Kristeligt Dagblad|date=5 February 2005|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718072428/http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/86834:Danmark--Den-skjulte-forskel|archivedate=18 July 2013}}</ref> That same year, he appointed [[Nina Bang]] as the world's first female minister, nine years after [[women's suffrage]] had been given in Denmark. Stauning stayed in power until his death in 1942, with his party laying the foundations for the Danish [[welfare state]] based on a close collaboration between labor unions and the government.

In January 1933, Stauning's government entered into what was then the most extensive settlement yet in [[Danish politics]], namely the [[Kanslergadeforliget|Kanslergade settlement]] ({{lang-da|Kanslergadeforliget}}) with the liberal party [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]].<ref>Skou, p. 367.</ref> The settlement was named after Stauning's apartment in Kanslergade in [[Copenhagen]] and included extensive [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] and reforms of the legislation and administration in the social sector.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mørch|first=Søren|title=24 statsministre: 24 fortællinger om magten i Danmark i det tyvende århundrede og en kort forklaring på, hvor den 25. er blevet af|page=165|publisher=Gyldendal|location=Copenhagen|year=2002|isbn=9788702003611|language=Danish}}</ref> In 1935, Stauning was reelected with the famous slogan "[[Stauning or Chaos]]".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Svensson|first=Palle|url=https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/scandinavian_political_studies/article/viewFile/12501/2383|title=Support for the Danish Social Democratic Party 1924–39 — Growth and Response|journal=Scandinavian Political Studies|volume=9|issue=A9|pages=127–146|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9477.1974.tb00536.x|date=January 1974}}</ref>

[[File:Socialdemokratiet1945.jpg|thumb|Social Democrats election poster for the October 1945 general election]]
Stauning's second cabinet lasted until the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[occupation of Denmark]] in 1940, when the cabinet was widened to include all political parties for a [[national unity government]] and the Danish government pursued a collaborative policy with the German occupiers. Through the 1940s and until 1972, [[List of Prime Ministers of Denmark|Denmark's Prime Ministers]] were all from the party.

=== Poul Nyrup Rasmussen government coalition: 1993–2001 ===
The Social Democrats' [[social policy]] through the 1990s and continuing in the 21st century involved a significant [[Redistribution (economics)|redistribution of income]] and the maintenance of a large state apparatus with collectively financed core [[public services]] such as [[public healthcare]], [[education]] and [[infrastructure]].

Social Democrats-led coalition governments (the [[Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen I|I]], [[Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen II|II]], [[Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen III|III]] and [[Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen IV|IV]] Cabinets of [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]]) implemented the system known as [[flexicurity]] (flexibility and social security), mixing strong Scandinavian [[unemployment benefits]] with deregulated employment laws, making it easier for employers to fire and rehire people in order to encourage [[economic growth]] and reduce unemployment.<ref>Volkesn, Andrea (2004). "Policy Changes of European Social Democrats 1945–98". In Bonoli, Giuliano (ed.). ''Social Democratic Party Policies in Contemporary Europe''. Psychology Press.</ref>

The Cabinets of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen maintained a parliamentary majority during the period from 1993 to 2001 by virtue of their support from the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]] and the [[Red–Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red–Green Alliance]].

Towards the end of the 1990s, a [[trade surplus]] of 30 billion [[Danish krone|kroner]] (US$4.9 billion) turned into a [[Trade deficit|deficit]].{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} To combat this, the government increased taxes, limiting [[Consumption (economics)|private consumption]]. The 1998 initiative, dubbed the Whitsun Packet (Danish: ''Pinsepakken'') from the season it was issued, was not universally popular with the electorate which may have been a factor in the Social Democrats' defeat in the [[2001 Danish general election]].

=== In opposition: 2001–2011 ===
After being defeated by the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal Party]] in the 2001 Danish general election, the party chairmanship went to former [[Finance Minister of Denmark|finance]] and [[Foreign Minister of Denmark|foreign minister]] [[Mogens Lykketoft]]. Following another defeat in the [[2005 Danish general election]], Lykketoft announced his resignation as party leader and at an extraordinary congress on 12 March it was decided that all members of the party would cast votes in an election of a new party leader. The two contenders for the leadership represented the two wings in the party, with [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] being viewed as [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[Frank Jensen]] being viewed as slightly more [[Centre-left politics|left-leaning]]. On 12 April 2005, Thorning-Schmidt was elected as the new leader.

=== Helle Thorning-Schmidt government coalition: 2011–2015 ===
In the [[2011 Danish general election]], the Social Democrats gained 44 seats in parliament, the lowest number since 1953.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://s-dialog.dk/A-English+version-Votes-and-seats-default.aspx?site=english&func=article.view&menuAction=selectClose&menuID=123060&id=123059|title=Socialdemokraterne – English version – Votes and seats|publisher=S-dialog.dk|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, the party succeeded in establishing a minority government with the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]] and the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]]. The incumbent centre-right coalition led by the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal Party]] lost power to a centre-left coalition led by the Social Democrats, making Thorning-Schmidt the country's first female Prime Minister. The Danish Social Liberal Party and the Socialist People's Party became part of the three-party centre-left coalition government. The new parliament convened on 4 October. The government rolled back anti-immigration legislation enacted by the previous government<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=William|url=http://world.time.com/2011/10/06/a-slap-to-europes-far-right-denmark-reshapes-its-immigration-policies/|title=Denmark's New Government Rolls Back an Anti-Immigrant Legacy|journal=Time|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref> and passed a tax-reform with support from the liberal-conservative opposition.<ref name="ThorningTaxreform"/> The tax reform raised the top tax threshold, effectively lowering tax rates for the wealthiest citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/politics/pm-supports-call-raise-top-tax-threshold|title=PM supports call to raise top tax threshold|work=The Copenhagen Post|date=16 May 2012|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref> The aim of the tax reform was to increase labour output to fend off a projected labour shortage within the next decades. The stated goal was to entice Danes to work more in order to compensate for the decreasing workforce by lowering tax on wages and gradually lowering welfare payments to those outside of the labour market to increase the economic benefit of working relative to receiving welfare.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/nyheter/news-2011-1/article.2011-10-06.6407706507|title=Helle Thorning-Schmidt: Danes must work more|journal=Nordic Labour Journal|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref>

On 3 February 2014, the Socialist People's Party left the government in protest over the sale of shares in the public energy company [[DONG Energy]] to the investment bank [[Goldman Sachs]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Hakim|first=Danny|title=Goldman Deal Threatens Danish Government|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/goldman-deal-threatens-danish-government/|work=The New York Times|date=30 January 2014|accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref> Because of the government's minority status and of its dependency on the support of the Danish Social Liberal Party, the government had to jettison many of the policies that the Social Democrats–Socialist People's Party coalition had given during the campaign. Although critics have accused the government of breaking its promises, other studies argue that it accomplished half of its stated goals, blaming instead poor public relations strategies for its increasingly negative public image.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/politics/government-track-message|title=Government on track but off message|work=The Copenhagen Post|date=18 May 2012|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref> The government pursued a centrist compromise agenda, building several reforms with support from both sides of the parliament. This caused friction with the supporting Red–Green Alliance which was kept outside of influence.<ref name="ThorningTaxreform">{{cite web|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/politics/government-defends-tax-deal-opposition|title=Government defends tax deal with opposition|work=The Copenhagen Post|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref>

=== In opposition: 2015–2019 ===
In the [[2015 Danish general election]], the Social Democrats gained seats and became the biggest party in the parliament again since 2001, yet lost the government because the right-wing parties had a majority. The results of the 2015 election and the defeat of the left-bloc led Thorning-Schmidt to resign as Prime Minister on election night and making way for the next leader [[Mette Frederiksen]].<ref>[http://nyheder.tv2.dk/valg2015/2015-06-19-portraet-den-utraditionelle-socialdemokrat-traekker-sig "Den utraditionelle socialdemokrat trækker sig"] (in Danish).</ref> Under Frederiksen, the Social Democrats voted in favor of a law allowing Danish authorities to confiscate money, jewellery and other valuable items refugees crossing the border may have,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/01/denmark-refugees-asylum-immigrants-syria/429240/|title=Denmark Will Strip Refugees of Their Valuables|first=Feargus|last=O'Sullivan|work=CityLab|date=26 January 2016|accessdate=13 June 2019}}</ref> despite harsh condemnation from the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|United Nations Human Right Council]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.dk/20160121/danish-migrant-bill-blasted-at-un|title=Danish migrant bill blasted at UN|first=Nina|last=Larson|work=The Local|date=21 January 2016|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref> and widespread comparisons between the plan and the treatment of [[Jews]] in [[Nazi-occupied Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/12/17/denmark-wants-to-seize-jewelry-from-refugees/|title=Denmark wants to seize jewelry and cash from refugees|first=Rick|last=Noack|work=The Washington Post|date=26 January 2016|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref>

Similarly, the Social Democrats voted for a law [[Burqa ban|banning wearing]] of [[burqa]]s and [[niqab]]s while abstaining during a vote on a law on mandatory handshakes irrespective of religious sentiment at citizenship ceremonies and on a plan to house criminal [[asylum seeker]]s on an island used for researching contagious animal diseases. Frederiksen has also backed the right-wing populist [[Danish People's Party]] in their paradigm shift push to make [[repatriation]] rather than [[Social integration|integration]] the goal of asylum policy. She has called for a cap on non-Western immigrants, expulsion of asylum seekers to a reception centre in North Africa and forced labour for immigrants in exchange for benefits. Labeling economic foreign policies of Europe as too [[Economic liberalism|liberal]], Frederiksen has criticised other social democratic parties for losing their voters' trust by failing to prevent globalisation chipping away at labour rights, increasing inequality and exposing them to uncontrolled immigration.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

=== Mette Frederiksen government: 2019–present ===
In the [[2019 Danish general election]], the Social Democrats gained one further seat and the opposition red bloc of [[left-wing]] and [[centre-left]] parties (the Social Democrats, the Danish Social Liberal Party, the Socialist People's Party and the Red–Green Alliance along with the [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] [[Social Democratic Party (Faroe Islands)|Social Democratic Party]] and [[Greenland]]'s [[Inuit Ataqatigiit]] and [[Siumut]]) won a majority of 93 out of 179 seats in the Folketing while support for the [[Danish People's Party]] and the [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]] collapsed, costing [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]] his majority. With the result beyond doubt on election night, Rasmussen conceded defeat and Frederiksen has been commissioned by [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]] to lead the negotiations to form a new government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/folketingsvalg/loekke-mette-frederiksen-udpeget-som-kongelig-undersoeger|title=Løkke: Mette Frederiksen udpeget som kongelig undersøger|last=Ingvorsen|first=Emil Søndergård|publisher=DR|date=6 June 2019|language=Danish|accessdate=16 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/danmarks-nye-regering-er-nu-paa-plads-se-hele-mette-frederiksens-ministerhold-her|title=Danmarks nye regering er nu på plads: Se hele Mette Frederiksens ministerhold her|last=Müller|first=Thea Deleuran|publisher=DR|date=27 June 2019|language=Danish|accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref> On 27 June 2019, Frederiksen was successful in forming the [[Frederiksen Cabinet]], an exclusively Social Democrats minority government supported by the red bloc, becoming the second woman in the role after Thorning-Schmidt as well as the youngest Prime Minister in Danish history at the age of 41.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/denmarks-youngest-prime-minister-to-lead-new-government/a-49357121|title=Denmark's youngest prime minister to lead new government|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=25 June 2019|accessdate=27 June 2019}}</ref>

Despite having run on an [[anti-immigration]] stance during the election, Frederiksen shifted her stance on immigration by allowing more foreign labour and reversing government plans to hold foreign criminals offshore after winning government.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/mette-frederiksen-social-democrats-form-government-in-denmark/|title=Social Democrats form government in Denmark|newspaper=Politico|date=26 June 2019|accessdate=31 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/denmark-new-government-left-mette-frederiksen-welfare-spending-anti-immigration-a8975096.html|title=Denmark gets new left-wing government with plans to increase welfare spending and scrap anti-immigration measures|newspaper=The Independent|date=26 June 2019|accessdate=31 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/06/26/world/politics-diplomacy-world/denmark-becomes-third-nordic-country-form-leftist-government-year/|title=Denmark becomes third Nordic country to form leftist government this year|newspaper=The Japan Times|date=26 June 2019|accessdate=31 July 2019}}</ref>

Since its foundation, the lemma of the party has been "[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood]]" and these values are still described as central in the party program. In the political program, these values are described as being consistent with a focus on solidarity with the poorest and social welfare to those who need it, with individual responsibility in relation to other members in society and with an increased involvement in the [[European Union|European political project]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialdemokraterne.dk/download.aspx?docId=717618|title=Handen Pa Hjertet|publisher=Socialdemokratiet|accessdate=16 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616101723/http://socialdemokraterne.dk/download.aspx?docId=717618|archivedate=16 June 2013}}</ref>

As well as adopting more [[left-leaning]] economics, the party has become increasingly sceptical of [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] [[mass immigration]] from a left-wing point of view as it believes it has had negative impacts for much of the population, a more pressing issue since at least 2001 after the [[11 September attacks]] which intensified during the [[2015 European migrant crisis]], including the view that perception of adopting the [[Third Way]] and practicing [[centrist]], [[neoliberal economics]] and supporting unrestricted [[Economic globalisation|globalisation]] contributed to its poor electoral performance in the early 21st century.<ref name="The Guardian"/><ref name="Politico"/>

In a recent biography, Party Leader and Danish Prime Minister [[Mette Frederiksen]] further argued: "For me, it is becoming increasingly clear that the price of unregulated globalisation, mass immigration and the free movement of labour is paid for by the lower classes".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/11/denmark-election-matte-frederiksen-leftwing-immigration|title=Mette Frederiksen: the anti-immigration left leader set to win power in Denmark|first=Richard Orange|last=Copenhagen|work=The Guardian|date=11 May 2019|accessdate=8 June 2019}}</ref>

== Electoral performance ==
The Social Democrats governed Denmark for most of the 20th century, with a few intermissions such as the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]]-led government of [[Poul Schlüter]] in the 1980s. It continued to be Denmark's largest party until 2001 when [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]]'s liberal [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] party gained a landslide victory, becoming the largest party and forming a centre-right government. The Social Democrats returned to government from 2011 to 2015 and since 2019.
