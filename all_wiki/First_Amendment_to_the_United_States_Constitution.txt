The '''First Amendment''' ('''Amendment I''') to the [[United States Constitution]] prevents the government from making laws which regulate an [[Establishment Clause|establishment of religion]], or that would prohibit the [[Free Exercise Clause|free exercise of religion]], or abridge the [[Freedom of speech in the United States|freedom of speech]], the [[Freedom of the press in the United States|freedom of the press]], the [[freedom of assembly]], or the [[right to petition]] the government for redress of grievances. It was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].

The Bill of Rights was proposed to assuage [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalist]] opposition to [[History of the United States Constitution#Ratification of the Constitution|Constitutional ratification]]. Initially, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by the [[United States Congress|Congress]], and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. Beginning with ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'' (1925), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] applied the First Amendment to states—a process known as [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights#Amendment I|incorporation]]—through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment]].

In ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' (1947), the Court drew on [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s correspondence to call for "a wall of separation between church and State", though the precise boundary of this separation remains in dispute. Speech rights were expanded significantly in a series of 20th and 21st century court decisions which protected various forms of political speech, anonymous speech, [[campaign finance]], [[pornography]], and [[School speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]; these rulings also defined a series of [[United States free speech exceptions|exceptions to First Amendment protections]]. The Supreme Court overturned [[English common law]] precedent to increase the burden of proof for [[defamation]] and [[libel]] suits, most notably in ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'' (1964). Commercial speech, however, is less protected by the First Amendment than political speech, and is therefore subject to greater regulation.

The Free Press Clause protects publication of information and opinions, and applies to a wide variety of media. In ''[[Near v. Minnesota]]'' (1931) and ''[[New York Times v. United States]]'' (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected against [[prior restraint]]—pre-publication censorship—in almost all cases. The Petition Clause protects the right to petition all branches and agencies of government for action. In addition to the right of assembly guaranteed by this clause, the Court has also ruled that the amendment implicitly protects [[freedom of association]].

Although the First Amendment applies only to [[state actors]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18682099/supreme-court-ruling-first-amendment-social-media-public-forum|title=First Amendment constraints don't apply to private platforms, Supreme Court affirms|last=Lecher|first=Colin|date=2019-06-17|website=The Verge|access-date=June 18, 2019}}</ref> there is a common misconception that it prohibits anyone from limiting free speech, including private, non-governmental entities.<ref name="McGregor"/>

==Background==

{{Further|Anti-Federalism}}

The right to petition for redress of grievances was a principle included in the 1215 [[Magna Carta]], as well as the [[Bill of Rights 1689|1689 English Bill of Rights]]. In 1776, the second year of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia colonial legislature]] passed a [[Virginia Declaration of Rights|Declaration of Rights]] that included the sentence "The freedom of the press is one of the greatest bulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic Governments." Eight of the other twelve states made similar pledges. However, these declarations were generally considered "mere admonitions to state legislatures", rather than enforceable provisions.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|pp=6–7}}
[[File:James Madison.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[James Madison]], drafter of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]]]

After several years of comparatively weak government under the [[Articles of Confederation]], a [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring among other changes a stronger chief executive. [[George Mason]], a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that the Constitution include a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing [[civil liberties]]. Other delegates—including future Bill of Rights drafter [[James Madison]]—disagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.{{sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=341–43}}

For the constitution to be ratified, however, nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for the addition of a bill of rights. The U.S. Constitution was eventually ratified by all thirteen states. In the [[1st United States Congress]], following the state legislatures' request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments, and his proposed draft of the First Amendment read as follows:
<blockquote>The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established, nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner, or on any pretext, infringed. The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and the freedom of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, shall be inviolable. The people shall not be restrained from peaceably assembling and consulting for their common good; nor from applying to the Legislature by petitions, or remonstrances, for redress of their grievances.<ref>Haynes, Charles, et al. ''The First Amendment in Schools: A Guide from the First Amendment Center'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=tFPtl17Xx5kC&pg=PA13 p. 13] (Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, 2003). Madison also proposed a similar limitation upon the states, which was completely rejected: "No State shall violate the equal rights of conscience, or the freedom of the press, or the trial by jury in criminal cases."

This language was greatly condensed by Congress, and passed the House and Senate with almost no recorded debate, complicating future discussion of the Amendment's intent.{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=2}}{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=10}} Congress approved and submitted to the states for their ratification twelve articles of amendment on September 25, 1789. The revised text of the third article became the First Amendment, because the last ten articles of the submitted 12 articles were ratified by the requisite number of states on December 15, 1791 and are now known collectively as the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights.html |title=Bill of Rights |publisher=National Archives |accessdate=April 4, 2013 |archivedate=April 4, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404123122/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights.html |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/nation/jb_nation_bofright_1.html |title=The New United States of America Adopted the Bill of Rights: December 15, 1791 |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=April 4, 2013 |archivedate=December 25, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225223835/http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/nation/jb_nation_bofright_1.html |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref>

==Freedom of religion==

{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}

Religious liberty, also known as freedom of religion, is "the right of all persons to believe, speak, and act – individually and in community with others, in private and in public – in accord with their understanding of ultimate truth."<ref name="20191101FarrReligousFreedom" /> The acknowledgement of religious freedom as the first right protected in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] points toward the American founders' understanding of the importance of religion to human, social, and political flourishing.<ref name="20191101FarrReligousFreedom" /> [[Freedom of religion]]<ref name="20191101FarrReligousFreedom" /> is protected by the First Amendment through its [[Establishment Clause]] and [[Free Exercise Clause]], which together form the religious liberty clauses of the First Amendment.<ref name="20021226ReligiousFreedomEducationProject">{{cite web|author1=Charles C.

Free exercise cases deal with Americans’ rights to practice their faith."<ref name="20201103WashingtonPostFulton v. Philadelphia" /> Both clauses sometimes compete with each other. The Supreme Court in ''[[McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union]]'' (2005) clarified this by the following example: When the government spends money on the [[clergy]], then it looks like establishing religion, but if the government cannot pay for [[military chaplains]], then many soldiers and sailors would be kept from the opportunity to exercise their chosen religions.<ref>{{cite web|title=McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U.S. 844 (2005), at Part IV|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/844/ |publisher=Justia US Supreme Court Center|accessdate=November 8, 2020|date=June 27, 2005}}</ref> In his dissenting opinion in ''[[McGowan v. Maryland]]'' (1961), Justice [[William O. Douglas]] illustrated the broad protections offered by the First Amendment's religious liberty clauses:

<blockquote>The First Amendment commands government to have no interest in theology or ritual; it admonishes government to be interested in allowing religious freedom to flourish—whether the result is to produce [[Catholicity|Catholics]], [[Judaism|Jews]], or [[Protestantism|Protestants]], or to turn the people toward the path of [[Buddhism|Buddha]], or to end in a predominantly [[Muslims|Moslem]] nation, or to produce in the long run [[Atheism|atheists]] or [[Agnosticism|agnostics]]. On matters of this kind, [[Separation of church and state in the United States|government must be neutral]]. This freedom plainly includes freedom from religion, with the right to believe, speak, write, publish and advocate anti-religious programs. ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette|Board of Education v. Barnette]], supra'', 319 U. S. 641. Certainly the "free exercise" clause does not require that everyone embrace the theology of some church or of some faith, or observe the religious practices of any majority or minority sect. The First Amendment, by its "establishment" clause, prevents, of course, the selection by government of an "official" church. Yet the ban plainly extends farther than that. We said in ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'', 330 U. S. 1, 330 U. S. 16, that it would be an "establishment" of a religion if the Government financed one church or several churches. For what better way to "establish" an institution than to find the fund that will support it? The "establishment" clause protects citizens also against any law which selects any religious custom, practice, or ritual, puts the force of government behind it, and fines, imprisons, or otherwise penalizes a person for not observing it. The Government plainly could not join forces with one religious group and decree a universal and symbolic [[circumcision]]. Nor could it require all children to be [[Baptism|baptized]] or give tax exemptions only to those whose children were baptized.<ref>{{cite web|title=McGowan v. Maryland: 366 U.S. 420 (1961)|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/366/420/#tab-opinion-1943325|publisher=Justia US Supreme Court Center|accessdate=May 25, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>

The history of the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause and the Supreme Court's own constitutional jurisprudence with respect to these clauses was explained in the 1985 case ''[[Wallace v. Jaffree]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wallace v.

The First Amendment was adopted to curtail the power of Congress to interfere with the individual's freedom to believe, to worship, and to express himself in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience. The [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] imposes on the states the same limitations the First Amendment had always imposed on the Congress.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wallace v.

The fundamental concept of liberty embodied in that Amendment embraces the liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment. The First Amendment declares that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The Fourteenth Amendment has rendered the legislatures of the states as incompetent as Congress to enact such laws. The constitutional inhibition of legislation on the subject of religion has a double aspect. On the one hand, it forestalls compulsion by law of the acceptance of any creed or the practice of any form of worship. Freedom of conscience and freedom to adhere to such religious organization or form of worship as the individual may choose cannot be restricted by law. On the other hand, it safeguards the free exercise of the chosen form of religion."<ref>{{cite web|title=Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38 (1985), at 50. Quoting from Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.

Maynard]]'' (1977){{efn|Enlarging on this theme, [[Warren Burger|THE CHIEF JUSTICE]] recently wrote: "We begin with the proposition that the right of freedom of thought protected by the First Amendment against state action includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.

<blockquote>Just as the right to speak and the right to refrain from speaking are complementary components of a broader concept of individual freedom of mind, so also the individual's freedom to choose his own creed is the counterpart of his right to refrain from accepting the creed established by the majority. At one time, it was thought that this right merely proscribed the preference of one [[Christianity|Christian]] [[sect]] over another, but would not require equal respect for the conscience of the [[infidel]], the [[Atheism|atheist]], or the [[Religious adherence|adherent]] of a non-Christian faith such as [[Islam]] or [[Judaism]]. But when the underlying principle has been examined in the crucible of litigation, the Court has unambiguously concluded that the individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces the right to select any religious faith or none at all. This conclusion derives support not only from the interest in respecting the individual's freedom of conscience, but also from the conviction that religious beliefs worthy of respect are the product of free and voluntary choice by the faithful, and from recognition of the fact that the political interest in forestalling [[Religious intolerance|intolerance]] extends beyond intolerance among Christian sects -- or even intolerance among "religions" -- to encompass intolerance of [[Infidel|the disbeliever]] and [[Uncertainty|the uncertain]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Wallace v.

===Establishment of religion===

{{See also|Establishment Clause}}

The precise meaning of the Establishment Clause can be traced back to the beginning of [[19th century]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote about the First Amendment and its restriction on Congress in an 1802 reply to the [[Baptists in the history of separation of church and state|Danbury Baptists]],<ref>{{cite web |author1=Jennifer A.

One source of the confusion is the phrase “separation of church and state,” a phrase used by President Thomas Jefferson in a widely misunderstood letter to the Danbury Baptist Association of Connecticut in 1802. Many think this means a radical separation of religion and politics. Some have gone so far as to suggest that religion should be entirely personal and private, kept out of public life and institutions like public schools. That is incorrect: Jefferson wanted to protect states’ freedom of religion from federal government control and religious groups’ freedom to tend to their internal matters of faith and practice without government interference generally.

<blockquote>Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof", thus building [[Separation of church and state|a wall of separation between Church & State]].

In ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'' (1878) the Supreme Court used these words to declare that "it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured. Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere [religious] opinion, but was left free to reach [only those religious] actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order." Quoting from Jefferson's [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] the court stated further in ''Reynolds'':
<blockquote>In the preamble of this act{{nbsp}}... religious freedom is defined; and after a recital 'that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion, and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy which at once destroys all religious liberty,' it is declared 'that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its officers to interfere [only] when [religious] principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order.' In these two sentences is found the true distinction between what properly belongs to the church and what to the State.</blockquote>

''Reynolds'' was the first Supreme Court decision to use the metaphor "a wall of separation between Church and State." American historian [[George Bancroft]] was consulted by Chief Justice [[Morrison Waite]] in ''Reynolds'' regarding the views on establishment by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]. Bancroft advised Waite to consult Jefferson and Waite then discovered the above quoted letter in a library after skimming through the index to Jefferson's collected works according to historian Don Drakeman.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Mark Movsesian (Director of the Center for Law and Religion at St. John's University)|title=How the Supreme Court Found the Wall{{!}}Mark Movsesian|url=https://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2013/02/how-the-supreme-court-found-the-wall|publisher=[[First Things]]|accessdate=June 16, 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220144157/https://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2013/02/how-the-supreme-court-found-the-wall/|archivedate=February 20, 2020}}</ref>

In ''[[Torcaso v.

====Separationists====

[[File:Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|thumb|President [[Thomas Jefferson]] [[Separation of church and state in the United States|wrote]] in 1802 of "a wall of separation".<ref name=everson />]]

''Everson'' used the metaphor of a wall of [[separation between church and state]], derived from the correspondence of President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. It had been long established in the decisions of the Supreme Court, beginning with ''Reynolds v. United States'' (1878), when the Court reviewed the history of the early Republic in deciding the extent of the liberties of Mormons. Chief Justice Morrison Waite, who consulted the historian [[George Bancroft]], also discussed at some length the ''Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments'' by James Madison,<ref name="Memorial&Remonstrance">{{cite web|last1=Madison|first1=James|title=Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious AssessmentsPapers|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions43.html|website=The Founders' Constitution|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=26 January 2017|pages=8:298–304|date=June 20, 1785}}</ref> who drafted the First Amendment; Madison used the metaphor of a "great barrier".<ref>Edward Mannino: ''Shaping America: the Supreme Court and American society'', University of South Carolina Press, 2000; p. 149; Daniel L. Driesbach, ''Thomas Jefferson and the Wall of Separation between Church and State'' NYU Press 2002, unpaginated; Chap. 7.</ref>

In ''Everson'', the Court adopted Jefferson's words.<ref name=everson> "In the words of [Thomas] Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect "a wall of separation between church and State". from [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/search/display.html?terms=Everson&url=/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0330_0001_ZO.html the ''Everson'' decision]</ref> The Court has affirmed it often, with majority, but not unanimous, support. Warren Nord, in ''Does God Make a Difference?'', characterized the general tendency of the dissents as a weaker reading of the First Amendment; the dissents tend to be "less concerned about the dangers of establishment and less concerned to protect free exercise rights, particularly of religious minorities".<ref>Warren A. Nord, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qXTziqxDgEQC&pg=PT226&dq=establishment+clause+conservative+liberal Does God Make a Difference?]'', Oxford University Press, 2010.</ref>

Beginning with ''Everson'', which permitted New Jersey school boards to pay for transportation to parochial schools, the Court has used various tests to determine when the wall of separation has been breached. ''Everson'' laid down the test that establishment existed when aid was given to religion, but that the transportation was justifiable because the benefit to the children was more important. In the school prayer cases of the early 1960s, (''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' and ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]''), aid seemed irrelevant; the Court ruled on the basis that a legitimate action both served a secular purpose and did not ''primarily'' assist religion. In ''[[Walz v. Tax Commission]]'' (1970), the Court ruled that a legitimate action could not entangle government with religion; in ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' (1971), these points were combined into the [[Lemon v. Kurtzman#Lemon test|Lemon test]], declaring that an action was an establishment if:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/11/us/excerpts-from-ruling-on-use-of-education-money.html|title=Excerpts From Ruling on Use of Education Money|date=June 11, 1998|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 3, 2013}}</ref>
# the statute (or practice) lacked a secular purpose;
# its principal or primary effect advanced or inhibited religion; or
# it fostered an excessive government entanglement with religion.

The ''Lemon'' test has been criticized by justices and legal scholars, but it remains the predominant means by which the Court enforces the Establishment Clause.<ref name="Kritzer, H.

Simmons-Harris]]'' (2002), the opinion of the Court considered secular purpose and the absence of primary effect; a concurring opinion saw both cases as having treated entanglement as part of the primary purpose test.<ref name="Kritzer, H. M 2003"/> Further tests, such as the [[endorsement test]] and [[coercion test]], have been developed to determine whether a government action violated the Establishment Clause.<ref>For the [[Endorsement test]] see ''[[Lynch v. Donnelly]]'', {{Ussc|465|668|1984|el=no}}.</ref><ref>For the [[coercion test]] see ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'', {{Ussc|505|577|1992|el=no}}.</ref>

[[Felix Frankfurter]] called in his concurrence opinion in ''[[McCollum v. Board of Education]]'' (1948) for a strict separation between state and church: "Separation means separation, not something less. Jefferson's metaphor in describing the relation between Church and State speaks of a "wall of separation", not of a fine line easily overstepped. [...] "The great American principle of eternal separation"—[[Elihu Root]]'s phrase bears repetition—is one of the vital reliances of our Constitutional system for assuring unities among our people stronger than our diversities. It is the Court's duty to enforce this principle in its full integrity."<ref>''[[McCollum v. Board of Education]]'', {{Ussc|333|203|1948|el=no}}</ref> In ''Lemon'' the Court however stated that the separation of church and state could never be absolute: "Our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state; total separation is not possible in an absolute sense. Some relationship between government and religious organizations is inevitable", the court wrote. "Judicial caveats against entanglement must recognize that the line of separation, far from being a 'wall', is a blurred, indistinct, and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship."<ref>''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'', 403 U.S. 602 (1971)</ref>

Douglas]] that "[w]e are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."<ref name="Accommodationists" />{{efn|The quote from Justice William O. Douglas comes from his majority opinion in ''[[Zorach v. Clauson]]'' (1952). This case centered on a programm by the state of New York which allowed children to leave school during school hours to receive religious instruction outside the school. In upholding the New York program Justice Douglas stated: "We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. We guarantee the freedom to worship as one chooses. We make room for as wide a variety of beliefs and creeds as the spiritual needs of man deem necessary. We sponsor an attitude on the part of government that shows no partiality to any one group and that lets each flourish according to the zeal of its adherents and the appeal of its dogma. When the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions. For it then respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs. To hold that it may not would be to find in the Constitution a requirement that the government show a callous indifference to religious groups. That would be preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe. Government may not finance religious groups nor undertake religious instruction nor blend secular and sectarian education nor use secular institutions to force one or some religion on any person. But we find no constitutional requirement which makes it necessary for government to be hostile to religion and to throw its weight against efforts to widen the effective scope of religious influence. The government must be neutral when it comes to competition between sects. It may not thrust any sect on any person. It may not make a religious observance compulsory.

Burger]] in ''Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York'' (1974) with respect to the separation of church and state: "No perfect or absolute separation is really possible; the very existence of the Religion Clauses is an involvement of sorts—one that seeks to mark boundaries to avoid excessive entanglement."<ref name="2017FirstAmendmentEncyclopedia1970Waltz"/> He also coined the term "benevolent neutrality" as a combination of neutrality and accommodationism in ''Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York'' (1974) to characterize a way to ensure that there is no conflict between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vile|first1=John R.|title=Benevolent Neutrality|url=https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/826/benevolent-neutrality|publisher=The First Amendment Encyclopedia presented by the John Seigenthaler Chair of Excellence in First Amendment Studies.|accessdate=August 3, 2020|archiveurl=https://archive.is/wip/Tfujn|archivedate=August 3, 2020}}</ref>{{efn|Burger explained the term "benevolent neutrality" with respect to the interplay of the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause in this way in ''Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York'' (1974):"The course of constitutionality neutrality in this area cannot be an absolutely straight line; rigidity could well defeat the basic purpose of these provisions, which is to insure that no religion be sponsored or favored, none commanded, and none inhibited. The general principle deducible from the First Amendment and all that has been said by the Court is this: that we will not tolerate either governmentally established religion or governmental interference with religion. Short of those expressly proscribed governmental acts there is room for play in the joints productive of a benevolent neutrality which will permit religious exercise to exist without sponsorship and without interference."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vile|first1=John R.|title=Benevolent Neutrality|url=https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/826/benevolent-neutrality|publisher=The First Amendment Encyclopedia presented by the John Seigenthaler Chair of Excellence in First Amendment Studies.|accessdate=August 3, 2020|archiveurl=https://archive.is/wip/Tfujn|archivedate=August 3, 2020}}</ref>}} Burger's successor, [[William Rehnquist]], called for the abandonment of the "wall of separation between church and State" metaphor in ''[[Wallace v.

===Free exercise of religion===

{{See also|Free Exercise Clause}}

The acknowledgement of religious freedom as the first right protected in the Bill of Rights points toward the American founders' understanding of the importance of religion to human, social, and political flourishing. The First Amendment makes clear that it sought to protect "the free exercise" of religion, or what might be called "free exercise equality."<ref name="20191101FarrReligousFreedom" /> Free exercise is the liberty of persons to reach, hold, practice and change beliefs freely according to the dictates of conscience. The Free Exercise Clause prohibits governmental interference with religious belief and, within limits, religious practice.<ref name="20021226ReligiousFreedomEducationProject" /> "Freedom of religion means freedom to hold an opinion or belief, but not to take action in violation of social duties or subversive to good order."<ref>{{cite web|title=Supreme Court Cases: Reynolds v.

The First Amendment broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.<ref name="19720626MosleyOpinionOfTheCourt" /> Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference and restraint by the government.<ref>{{cite web |title=freedom of speech In: The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition, 2020. |url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Freedom+of+speech |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company |accessdate=July 28, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728051257/https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Freedom+of+speech |archivedate=July 28, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=freedom of speech |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freedom%20of%20speech |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=July 28, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229134124/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freedom%20of%20speech |archivedate=February 29, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=free speech |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/free-speech |publisher=[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]] |accessdate=July 28, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190916143258/https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/free-speech |archivedate=September 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=freedom of speech |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/freedom-of-speech |publisher=[[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate=July 28, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616121744/https://www.dictionary.com/browse/freedom-of-speech |archivedate=September 10, 2019}}</ref> The term "freedom of speech" embedded in the First Amendment encompasses the decision what to say as well as what not to say.<ref>{{cite web |title=Riley v.

Mosley]]'' (1972) said: 
<blockquote>"But, above all else, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content. [...] To permit the continued building of our politics and culture, and to assure self-fulfillment for each individual, our people are guaranteed the right to express any thought, free from government censorship. The essence of this forbidden censorship is content control. Any restriction on expressive activity because of its content would completely undercut the "profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.""<ref name="19720626MosleyOpinionOfTheCourt">{{cite web|title=Police Dept. of City of Chicago v.

The level of protections with respect to free speech and free press given by the First Amendment is not limitless. As stated in his concurrence in ''Chicago Police Dept. v. Mosley'' (1972), Chief Justice Warren E. Burger said:
<blockquote>"Numerous holdings of this Court attest to the fact that the First Amendment does not literally mean that we "are guaranteed the right to express any thought, free from government censorship." This statement is subject to some qualifications, as for example those of `''[[Roth v. United States]]'', 354 U. S. 476 (1957); ''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'', 315 U. S. 568 (1942). See also ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'', 376 U. S. 254 (1964)."<ref>{{cite web|title=Police Dept. of City of Chicago v.

Attached to the rights of free speech and free press as the core rights to utter and to print are several peripheral rights which make these core rights more secure. The peripheral rights encompass not only [[freedom of association]] including [[privacy]] in one's associations, but also, in the words of ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965), "[[Academic freedom|the  freedom of the entire university community]]", i.e. the right to distribute, the right to receive, the right to read as well as freedom of inquiry, [[freedom of thought]], and freedom to teach.<ref>{{cite web |title=Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), at 482-483 |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/381/479/ |publisher=Justia US Supreme Court Center |accessdate=July 30, 2020 |date=June 7, 1965}}</ref>

===Wording of the clause===

The First Amendment bars Congress from "abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press". U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] commented about this phraseology in a 1993 journal article: "I emphasize the word 'the' in the term 'the freedom of speech' because the definite article suggests that the draftsmen intended to immunize a previously identified category or subset of speech." Stevens said that, otherwise, the clause might absurdly immunize things like false testimony under oath.<ref>Stevens, John Paul. "The Freedom of Speech", ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'', Vol. 102, p. 1296 (1993).</ref> Like Stevens, journalist [[Anthony Lewis]] wrote: "The word 'the' can be read to mean what was understood at the time to be included in the concept of free speech."{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=40}} But what was understood at the time is not 100% clear.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=41}} In the late 1790s, the lead author of the speech and press clauses, [[James Madison]], argued against narrowing this freedom to what had existed under English [[common law]]:
<blockquote>The practice in America must be entitled to much more respect. In every state, probably, in the Union, the press has exerted a freedom in canvassing the merits and measures of public men, of every description, which has not been confined to the strict limits of the common law.<ref name=Dry>Dry, Murray. Civil Peace and the Quest for Truth: The First Amendment Freedoms in Political Philosophy and American Constitutionalism, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7S02AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA70 pp. 68–70] (Lexington Books 2004).</ref></blockquote>

Madison wrote this in 1799, when he was in a dispute about the constitutionality of the [[Alien and Sedition Laws]], which was legislation enacted in 1798 by President [[John Adams]]' [[Federalist Party]] to ban [[seditious libel]]. Madison believed that legislation to be unconstitutional, and his adversaries in that dispute, such as [[John Marshall]], advocated the narrow freedom of speech that had existed in the English common law.<ref name=Dry />

===Speech critical of the government===

The Supreme Court declined to rule on the [[constitutionality]] of any federal law regarding the Free Speech Clause until the 20th century. For example, the Supreme Court never ruled on the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]]; three Supreme Court justices [[riding circuit]] presided over sedition trials without indicating any reservations.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=15}} The leading critics of the law, Vice President Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, argued for the Acts' unconstitutionality based on the First Amendment and other Constitutional provisions.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|pp=16–17}} Jefferson succeeded Adams as president, in part due to the unpopularity of the latter's sedition prosecutions; he and his party quickly overturned the Acts and pardoned those imprisoned by them.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=20}} In the majority opinion in ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'' (1964),<ref name="ReferenceA">''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'', {{ussc|376|254|1964}}</ref> the Court noted the importance of this public debate as a precedent in First Amendment law and ruled that the Acts had been unconstitutional: "Although the Sedition Act was never tested in this Court, the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the court of history."<ref>''Sullivan'', at 276</ref>{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=53}} 

====World War I====

During the patriotic fervor of [[World War I]] and the [[First Red Scare]], the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] imposed a maximum sentence of twenty years for anyone who caused or attempted to cause "insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty in the military or naval forces of the United States". Specifically, the Espionage Act of 1917 states that if anyone allows any enemies to enter or fly over the United States and obtain information from a place connected with the national defense, they will be punished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Espionage Act, 1917|url=http://recordsofrights.org/records/145/espionage-act|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref> Hundreds of prosecutions followed.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=25}} In 1919, the Supreme Court heard four appeals resulting from these cases: ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'', ''[[Debs v. United States]]'', ''[[Frohwerk v. United States]]'', and ''[[Abrams v. United States]]''.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|pp=25–27}}
[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr circa 1930-edit.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] formulated the [[clear and present danger]] test for free speech cases.]]

In the first of these cases, [[Socialist Party of America]] official [[Charles Schenck]] had been convicted under the Espionage Act for publishing leaflets urging resistance to the draft.{{sfn|Abrams|2006|pp=65–66}} Schenck appealed, arguing that the Espionage Act violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. In ''Schenck v. United States'', the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Schenck's appeal and affirmed his conviction.<ref>''Schenck v. United States'', {{ussc|249|47|1919}}</ref> Debate continued over whether ''Schenck'' went against the right to freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment. Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], writing for the Court, explained that "the question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a [[clear and present danger]] that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent."<ref>''Schenck'', at 52</ref> One week later, in ''Frohwerk v. United States'', the court again upheld an Espionage Act conviction, this time that of a journalist who had criticized U.S. involvement in foreign wars.{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=23}}<ref>{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey R. Stone|author2=Professor of Law Geoffrey R Stone|title=Perilous Times: Free Speech in Wartime from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the War on Terrorism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7ScI3Ia25sC|year=2004|publisher=W.W.

In ''Debs v. United States'', the Court elaborated on the "clear and present danger" test established in ''Schenck''.<ref>''Debs v. United States'', {{ussc|249|211|1919}}</ref> On June 16, 1918, [[Eugene V. Debs]], a political activist, delivered a speech in [[Canton, Ohio]], in which he spoke of "most loyal comrades were paying the penalty to the working class—these being [[w:Alfred Wagenknecht|Wagenknecht]], Baker and [[C. E. Ruthenberg|Ruthenberg]], who had been convicted of aiding and abetting another in failing to register for the draft."<ref>''Debs'', at 213</ref> Following his speech, Debs was charged and convicted under the Espionage Act. In upholding his conviction, the Court reasoned that although he had not spoken any words that posed a "clear and present danger", taken in context, the speech had a "natural tendency and a probable effect to obstruct the recruiting services".<ref name="Debs216">''Debs'', at 216</ref>{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=27}} In ''Abrams v. United States'', four Russian refugees appealed their conviction for throwing leaflets from a building in New York; the leaflets argued against President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s intervention in Russia against the [[October Revolution]]. The majority upheld their conviction, but Holmes and Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] dissented, holding that the government had demonstrated no "clear and present danger" in the four's political advocacy.{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=23}}
{{Clear}}

====Extending protections====

[[File:Brandeisl.jpg|thumb|Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] wrote several dissents in the 1920s upholding free speech claims.]]

The Supreme Court denied a number of Free Speech Clause claims throughout the 1920s, including the appeal of a labor organizer, Benjamin Gitlow, who had been convicted after distributing a manifesto calling for a "revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat".{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=108}} In ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'' (1925), the Court upheld the conviction, but a majority also found that the First Amendment applied to state laws as well as federal laws, via the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=24}}{{sfn|Lewis|2007|pp=34–35}} Holmes and Brandeis dissented in several more cases in this decade, however, advancing the argument that the Free Speech Clause protected a far greater range of political speech than the Court had previously acknowledged. In ''[[Whitney v. California]]'' (1927),<ref>''[[Whitney v. California]]'', {{ussc|274|357|1927}}</ref> in which [[Communist Party USA]] organizer [[Charlotte Anita Whitney]] had been arrested for "[[criminal syndicalism]]", Brandeis wrote a dissent in which he argued for broader protections for political speech:
<blockquote>Those who won our independence{{nbsp}}... believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; that without free speech and assembly discussion would be futile; that with them, discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the dissemination of noxious doctrine; that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people; that public discussion is a political duty; and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=36}}</blockquote>

In ''[[Herndon v. Lowry]]'' (1937), the Court heard the case of African American Communist Party organizer [[Angelo Herndon]], who had been convicted under the Slave Insurrection Statute for advocating black rule in the southern United States. The Court reversed Herndon's conviction, holding that [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] had failed to demonstrate any "clear and present danger" in Herndon's political advocacy.{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=26}}

In 1940, Congress enacted the [[Smith Act]], making it illegal to advocate "the propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force and violence".<ref>{{usc|18|2385}}</ref> The statute provided law enforcement a tool to combat Communist leaders. [[Eugene Dennis]] was convicted in the [[Foley Square trial]] for attempting to organize a Communist Party.<ref>''Dennis'', at 497</ref> In ''[[Dennis v. United States]]'' (1951),<ref>''[[Dennis v. United States]]'' {{ussc|341|494|1951}}</ref> the Court upheld the law.{{efn|Justice [[Tom C. Clark]] did not participate because he had ordered the prosecutions when he was [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]].}}{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=28}} Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson]] relied on Holmes' "clear and present danger" test as adapted by [[Learned Hand]]: "In each case [courts] must ask whether the gravity of the 'evil', discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as necessary to avoid the danger."<ref>''Dennis'', at 510</ref> Clearly, Vinson suggested, clear and present danger did not intimate "that before the Government may act, it must wait until the ''putsch'' is about to be executed, the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited."<ref>''Dennis'', at 509</ref> In a concurring opinion, Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] proposed a "balancing test", which soon supplanted the "clear and present danger" test:
<blockquote>The demands of free speech in a democratic society as well as the interest in national security are better served by candid and informed weighing of the competing interests, within the confines of the judicial process.{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=28}}</blockquote>

In ''[[Yates v. United States]]'' (1957), the Supreme Court limited the Smith Act prosecutions to "advocacy of action" rather than "advocacy in the realm of ideas". Advocacy of abstract doctrine remained protected while speech explicitly inciting the forcible overthrow of the government was punishable under the Smith Act.<ref>''[[Yates v. United States]]'', {{ussc|354|298|1957}}</ref>{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=29}}

During the [[Vietnam War]], the Court's position on public criticism of the government changed drastically. Though the Court upheld a law prohibiting the forgery, mutilation, or destruction of [[draft card]]s in ''[[United States v. O'Brien]]'' (1968),<ref>''[[United States v. O'Brien]]'', {{ussc|391|367|1968}}</ref> fearing that [[Draft-card burning|burning draft cards]] would interfere with the "smooth and efficient functioning" of the draft system,<ref>{{usc|50a|462}}</ref><ref>''O'Brien'', at 379</ref> the next year, the court handed down its decision in ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' (1969),<ref>''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|395|444|1969}}</ref> expressly overruling ''Whitney v. California''.{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=32}} ''Brandenburg'' discarded the "clear and present danger" test introduced in ''Schenck'' and further eroded ''Dennis''.<ref>''Brandenburg'', at 450–1</ref>{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=124}} Now the Supreme Court referred to the right to speak openly of violent action and revolution in broad terms:
{{quote|[Our] decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not allow a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing [[imminent lawless action]] and is likely to incite or cause such action.<ref>''Brandenburg'', at 447</ref>}}

In ''[[Cohen v. California]]'' (1971),<ref>''[[Cohen v. California]]'', {{ussc|403|15|1971}}</ref> the Court voted reversed the conviction of a man wearing a jacket reading "Fuck the Draft" in the corridors of a [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] courthouse. Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II]] wrote in the majority opinion that Cohen's jacket fell in the category of protected political speech despite the use of an expletive: "One man's vulgarity is another man's lyric."{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=46}}

===Political speech===
====Anonymous speech====

In ''[[Talley v. California]]'' (1960),<ref>''[[Talley v. California]]'', {{ussc|362|60|1960}}</ref> the Court struck down a Los Angeles city ordinance that made it a crime to distribute anonymous pamphlets. Justice Hugo Black wrote in the majority opinion: "There can be no doubt that such an identification requirement would tend to restrict freedom to distribute information and thereby freedom of expression.{{nbsp}}... Anonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures and even books have played an important role in the progress of mankind."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-90119545|title=Cybersmear: telecommunication's 200-year-old riddle|author=Chiger, Stephen J.|date=June 1, 2002|work=Communications and the Law|publisher=|via=[[Questia Online Library]] |url-access=subscription|accessdate=April 11, 2013}}</ref> In ''[[McIntyre v.

====Campaign finance====

{{See also|Campaign finance reform in the United States}}
[[File:Mitch McConnell 2016 official photo.jpg|thumb|U.S. Senator [[Mitch McConnell]], plaintiff in ''[[McConnell v. Federal Election Commission]]'']]

In ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'' (1976),<ref>''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'', {{ussc|424|1|1976}}</ref> the Supreme Court reviewed the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] of 1971 and related laws, which restricted the monetary contributions that may be made to political campaigns and expenditure by candidates. The Court affirmed the constitutionality of limits on campaign contributions, saying they "serve[d] the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process without directly impinging upon the rights of individual citizens and candidates to engage in political debate and discussion."<ref>''Buckley'', at 58</ref> However, the Court overturned the spending limits, which it found imposed "substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech".<ref>''Buckley'', at 39</ref>{{sfn|Lewis|2007|pp=177–78}}

The court again scrutinized campaign finance regulation in ''[[McConnell v. Federal Election Commission]]'' (2003).<ref>''[[McConnell v. Federal Election Commission]]'', {{ussc|540|93|2003}}</ref> The case centered on the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] of 2002 (BCRA), a federal law that imposed new restrictions on campaign financing. The Supreme Court upheld provisions which barred the raising of [[Campaign finance in the United States#Hard money and soft money|soft money]] by national parties and the use of soft money by private organizations to fund certain advertisements related to elections. However, the Court struck down the "choice of expenditure" rule, which required that parties could either make coordinated expenditures for all its candidates, or permit candidates to spend independently, but not both, which the Court agreed "placed an unconstitutional burden on the parties' right to make unlimited independent expenditures".<ref>''McConnell'', at 213</ref> The Court also ruled that the provision preventing minors from making political contributions was unconstitutional, relying on ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]''.

In ''[[Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.]]'' (2007),<ref>{{ussc|name=Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.|volume=551|page=449|year=2007}}</ref> the Court sustained an [["as applied" challenge]] to BCRA, holding that issue ads may not be banned from the months preceding a primary or general election. In ''[[Davis v. Federal Election Commission]]'' (2008),<ref>{{ussc|name=Davis v. FEC|volume=554|page=724|year=2008}}</ref> the Supreme Court declared the "Millionaire's Amendment" provisions of the BCRA to be unconstitutional. The Court held that easing BCRA restrictions for an opponent of a self-financing candidate spending at least $350,000 of his or her own money violated the freedom of speech of the self-financing candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-204614062|title='Wholly foreign to the First Amendment': the demise of campaign finance's equalizing rationale in Davis v.

In ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'' (2010),<ref>{{ussc|name=Citizens United v. FEC|volume=558|page=310|year=2010}}.</ref> the Court ruled that the BCRA's federal restrictions on electoral advocacy by corporations or [[Trade union|unions]] were unconstitutional for violating the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. The Court overruled ''[[Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce]]'' (1990),<ref>{{ussc|name=Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce|494|652|1990}}</ref> which had upheld a state law that prohibited corporations from using treasury funds to support or oppose candidates in elections did not violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments. The Court also overruled the portion of ''McConnell'' that upheld such restrictions under the BCRA.<ref>See Part III of the Opinion of the Court in ''Citizens United''</ref> In other words, the ruling was considered to hold that "political spending is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment".<ref>[http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/ "Citizens United v.

====Flag desecration====

The divisive issue of [[flag desecration]] as a form of protest first came before the Supreme Court in ''[[Street v. New York]]'' (1969).<ref>{{ussc|name=Street v. New York|394|576|1969}}.</ref> In response to hearing an erroneous report of the murder of civil rights activist [[James Meredith]], Sidney Street burned a [[Flag of the United States|48-star U.S. flag]]. Street was arrested and charged with a New York state law making it a crime "publicly [to] mutilate, deface, defile, or defy, trample upon, or cast contempt upon either by words or act [any flag of the United States]".<ref>''Street'', 394 U.S. at 578 (quoting the [[New York Penal Law]], §1425, subd. 16).</ref> The Court, relying on ''[[Stromberg v. California]]'' (1931),<ref>''[[Stromberg v. California]]'', {{ussc|name=Stromberg v. California|283|359|1931}}.</ref> found that because the provision of the New York law criminalizing "words" against the flag was unconstitutional, and the trial did not sufficiently demonstrate he had been convicted solely under the provisions not yet deemed unconstitutional, the conviction was unconstitutional. The Court, however, "resist[ed] the pulls to decide the constitutional issues involved in this case on a broader basis" and left the constitutionality of flag-burning unaddressed.<ref>''Street'', 394 U.S. at 581.</ref>{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=43}}

The ambiguity with regard to flag-burning statutes was eliminated in ''[[Texas v. Johnson]]'' (1989).<ref>''[[Texas v.

===Compelled speech===

{{Main|Compelled speech}}

The Supreme Court has determined that the First Amendment also protects citizens from being compelled to say or pay for certain speech.

In ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'' (1943), the Court ruled that school children could not be punished for refusing either to say the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|pledge of allegiance]] or salute the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]. The Court also overruled ''[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]'' (1940), which had upheld such punishments of school children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/West-Virginia-State-Board-of-Education-v-Barnette|title=West Virginia State Board of Education v.

In ''[[National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra]]'' (2018), the Court ruled that a California law requiring [[crisis pregnancy center]]s to post notices informing patients they can obtain free or low-cost abortions and include the number of the state agency that can connect the women with abortion providers violated those centers' right to free speech.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2018/06/opinion-analysis-divided-court-rules-for-anti-abortion-pregnancy-centers-in-challenge-to-california-law/#more-272072|title=Opinion analysis: Divided court rules for anti-abortion pregnancy centers in challenge to California law|author=Amy Howe|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|date=June 26, 2018|accessdate=June 27, 2018}}</ref>

In ''[[Janus v. AFSCME]]'' (2018), the Court ruled that requiring a [[public sector]] employee to pay dues to a union to which he is not a member violated the First Amendment. According to the Court, "the First Amendment does not permit the government to compel a person to pay for another party's speech just because the government thinks that the speech furthers the interests of the person who does not want to pay." The Court also overruled ''[[Abood v. Detroit Board of Education]]'' (1977), which had upheld legally obligating public sector employees to pay such dues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2018/06/opinion-analysis-court-strikes-down-public-sector-union-fees/|title=Opinion analysis: Court strikes down public-sector union fees|author=Amy Howe|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|date=June 27, 2018|accessdate=June 27, 2018}}</ref>

===Commercial speech===

{{Main|Commercial speech}}

Commercial speech is speech done on behalf of a company or individual for the purpose of making a profit. Unlike political speech, the Supreme Court does not afford commercial speech full protection under the First Amendment. To effectively distinguish commercial speech from other types of speech for purposes of litigation, the Court uses a list of four indicia:<ref>''[[Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products]]'', {{ussc|463|60|1983}}</ref>
# The contents do "no more than propose a commercial transaction".
# The contents may be characterized as advertisements.
# The contents reference a specific product.
# The disseminator is economically motivated to distribute the speech.

Alone, each indicium does not compel the conclusion that an instance of speech is commercial; however, "[t]he combination of ''all'' these characteristics{{nbsp}}... provides strong support for{{nbsp}}... the conclusion that the [speech is] properly characterized as commercial speech."<ref>''Bolger'', 463 U.S. at 67.</ref>

In ''[[Valentine v. Chrestensen]]'' (1942),<ref>{{ussc|name=Valentine v. Chrestensen|316|52|1942}}</ref> the Court upheld a New York City ordinance forbidding the "distribution in the streets of commercial and business advertising matter", ruling the First Amendment protection of free speech did not include commercial speech.<ref>''Valentine'', 316 U.S. at 53-54.</ref>

In ''[[Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council]]'' (1976),<ref>{{ussc|name=Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council|425|748|1976}}. {{usgovpd}}</ref> the Court overturned ''Valentine'' and ruled that commercial speech was entitled to First Amendment protection:
{{quote|What is at issue is whether a State may completely suppress the dissemination of concededly truthful information about entirely lawful activity, fearful of that information's effect upon its disseminators and its recipients.{{nbsp}}... [W]e conclude that the answer to this one is in the negative.<ref>''Virginia State Pharmacy Board'', 425 U.S. at 773.</ref>}}

In ''Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association'' (1978),<ref>{{ussc|name=Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association|436|447|1978}}. {{usgovpd}}</ref> the Court ruled that commercial speech was not protected by the First Amendment as much as other types of speech:
{{quote|We have not discarded the 'common-sense' distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech. To require a parity of constitutional protection for commercial and noncommercial speech alike could invite a dilution, simply by a leveling process, of the force of the [First] Amendment's guarantee with respect to the latter kind of speech.<ref>''Ohralik'', 436 U.S. at 455.</ref>}}

In ''[[Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission]]'' (1980),<ref>''[[Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission]]'', {{ussc|447|557|1980}}</ref> the Court clarified what analysis was required before the government could justify regulating commercial speech:
# Is the expression protected by the First Amendment? Lawful? Misleading? Fraud?
# Is the asserted government interest substantial?
# Does the regulation directly advance the governmental interest asserted?
# Is the regulation more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest?

Six years later, the U.S. Supreme Court, applying the ''Central Hudson'' standards in ''[[Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Company of Puerto Rico]]'' (1986),<ref>''[[Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Company of Puerto Rico]]'', {{ussc|478|328|1986}}</ref> affirmed the [[Supreme Court of Puerto Rico]]'s conclusion that [[Puerto Rico]]'s ''Games of Chance Act of 1948'', including the regulations thereunder, was not facially unconstitutional. The lax interpretation of ''Central Hudson'' adopted by ''Posadas'' was soon restricted under ''[[44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island]]'' (1996),<ref>''[[44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island]]'', {{ussc|517|484|1996}}</ref> when the Court invalidated a [[Rhode Island]] law prohibiting the publication of liquor prices.

===School speech===

{{Main|School speech (First Amendment)}}

In ''Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District'' (1969),<ref>''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'', {{ussc|393|503|1969}}</ref> the Supreme Court extended free speech rights to students in school. The case involved several students who were punished for wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam War. The Court ruled that the school could not restrict symbolic speech that did not "materially and substantially" interrupt school activities.{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=61}} Justice [[Abe Fortas]] wrote:
{{quote|First Amendment rights, applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment, are available to teachers and students. It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.{{nbsp}}... [S]chools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism. School officials do not possess absolute authority over their students. Students{{nbsp}}... are possessed of fundamental rights which the State must respect, just as they themselves must respect their obligations to the State.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0393_0503_ZO.html|title=''Tinker v.

In ''[[Healy v. James]]'' (1972), the Court ruled that [[Central Connecticut State University|Central Connecticut State College's]] refusal to recognize a campus chapter of [[Students for a Democratic Society]] was unconstitutional, reaffirming ''Tinker''.{{sfn|Jasper|1999|p=62}}

However, since 1969 the Court has also placed several limitations on ''Tinker''. In ''[[Bethel School District v. Fraser]]'' (1986),<ref>''[[Bethel School District v. Fraser]]'', {{ussc|478|675|1986}}</ref> the Court ruled that a student could be punished for his sexual-innuendo-laced speech before a school assembly and, in ''[[Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'' (1988),<ref>''[[Hazelwood v.

Frederick]]'' (2007),<ref>''[[Morse v.

===Obscenity===

{{Further<!--Main is ONLY for summary-style overviews of a subarticle; Further is the correct template when "the section expounds a specific aspect of the topic instead of summarizing its article".-->|United States obscenity law}}
[[File:US Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart - 1976 official portrait.jpg|thumb|Justice [[Potter Stewart]] wrote that while he could not precisely define pornography, he "[knew] it when [he saw] it".]]

According to the U.S. Supreme Court, the First Amendment's protection of free speech does not apply to obscene speech. Therefore, both the federal government and the states have tried to prohibit or otherwise restrict obscene speech, in particular the form that is {{as of|2019|alt=now}} called pornography. {{as of|2019}}, pornography, except for child pornography, is in practice free of governmental restrictions in the United States, though pornography about "extreme" sexual practices is occasionally prosecuted. The change in the twentieth century, from total prohibition in 1900 to near-total tolerance in 2000, reflects a series of court cases involving the definition of obscenity. The U.S. Supreme Court has found that most pornography is not obscene, a result of changing definitions of both obscenity and pornography.<ref name=EB /> The legal tolerance also reflects changed social attitudes: one reason there are so few prosecutions for pornography is that [[jury nullification in the United States|juries will not convict]].<ref>Jury nullification:<br />

In ''[[Rosen v. United States]]'' (1896), the Supreme Court adopted the same obscenity standard as had been articulated in a famous British case, ''Regina v. Hicklin'' (1868).<ref>''Regina v. Hicklin'', [1868] L. R. 3 Q. B. 360</ref> The [[Hicklin test|''Hicklin'' test]] defined material as obscene if it tended "to deprave or corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall".<ref>''Rosen'', at 43</ref> In the early twentieth century, literary works including ''[[An American Tragedy]]'' ([[Theodore Dreiser]], 1925) and ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' ([[D.H. Lawrence]], 1928) were banned for obscenity. In the [[United States district court|federal district court]] case ''[[United States v. One Book Called Ulysses]]'' (1933), Judge John M. Woolsey established a new standard to evaluate [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), stating that works must be considered in their entirety, rather than declared obscene on the basis of an individual part of the work.<ref name=obscenity>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/obscenity|title=Obscenity|date=August 19, 2010|publisher=Legal Information Institute, Cornell University Law School|accessdate=April 10, 2013|archivedate=April 2, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402163508/http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/obscenity|url-status=live|df=mdy}}</ref>

The Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Roth v. United States]]'' (1957)<ref>''[[Roth v. United States]]'', {{ussc|354|476|1957}}</ref> that the First Amendment did not protect obscenity.<ref name=obscenity /> It also ruled that the ''Hicklin'' test was inappropriate; instead, the ''Roth'' test for obscenity was "whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest".<ref>''Roth'', at 489</ref> This definition proved hard to apply, however, and in the following decade, members of the Court often reviewed films individually in a court building screening room to determine if they should be considered obscene.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|pp=135–36}} Justice [[Potter Stewart]], in ''[[Jacobellis v. Ohio]]'' (1964),<ref>''[[Jacobellis v.

The ''Roth'' test was expanded when the Court decided ''[[Miller v. California]]'' (1973).<ref>''[[Miller v. California]]'', {{ussc|413|15|1973}}</ref> Under the [[Miller test|''Miller'' test]], a work is obscene if:
{{quote|(a){{nbsp}}... 'the average person, applying contemporary community standards' would find the work, as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest{{nbsp}}...

Note that "community" standards—not national standards—are applied whether the material appeals to the prurient interest, leaving the question of obscenity to local authorities.<ref name=obscenity /> [[Child pornography]] is not subject to the ''Miller'' test, as the Supreme Court decided in ''[[New York v.

Personal possession of obscene material in the home may not be prohibited by law. In ''[[Stanley v. Georgia]]'' (1969),<ref>''[[Stanley v.

===Defamation===

{{Further<!--Main is ONLY for summary-style overviews of a subarticle; Further is the correct template when "the section expounds a specific aspect of the topic instead of summarizing its article".-->|United States defamation law}}
[[File:US Supreme Court Justice William Brennan - 1976 official portrait.jpg|thumb|Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote the landmark decision ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'', requiring the demonstration of "actual malice" in libel suits against public figures.]]

[[United States tort law|American tort liability]] for [[Defamation|defamatory]] speech or publications traces its origins to [[English law#Common law|English common law]]. For the first two hundred years of American jurisprudence, the basic substance of defamation law continued to resemble that existing in England at the time of the Revolution. An 1898 American legal textbook on defamation provides definitions of libel and slander nearly identical to those given by [[William Blackstone]] and [[Edward Coke]]. An action of slander required the following:{{sfn|Newell|1898|pp=37–41}}
# Actionable words, such as those imputing the injured party: is guilty of some offense, suffers from a contagious disease or psychological disorder, is unfit for public office because of moral failings or an inability to discharge his or her duties, or lacks integrity in profession, trade or business;
# That the charge must be false;
# That the charge must be articulated to a third person, verbally or in writing;
# That the words are not subject to legal protection, such as those uttered in Congress; and
# That the charge must be motivated by malice.

An action of libel required the same five general points as slander, except that it specifically involved the publication of defamatory statements.{{sfn|Newell|1898|pp=33–37}} For certain criminal charges of libel, such as seditious libel, the truth or falsity of the statements was immaterial, as such laws were intended to maintain public support of the government and true statements could damage this support even more than false ones.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=93}} Instead, libel placed specific emphasis on the result of the publication. Libelous publications tended to "degrade and injure another person" or "bring him into contempt, hatred or ridicule".{{sfn|Newell|1898|pp=33–37}}

Concerns that defamation under common law might be incompatible with the new republican form of government caused early American courts to struggle between [[William Blackstone]]'s argument that the punishment of "dangerous or offensive writings{{nbsp}}...

The Supreme Court's ruling in ''New York Times Co. v. Sullivan'' (1964)<ref name="ReferenceA"/> fundamentally changed American defamation law. The case redefined the type of "malice" needed to sustain a libel case. Common law malice consisted of "ill-will" or "wickedness". Now, a public officials seeking to sustain a civil action against a tortfeasor needed to prove by "clear and convincing evidence" that there was actual malice. The case involved an advertisement published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' indicating that officials in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] had acted violently in suppressing the protests of African-Americans during the [[civil rights movement]]. The Montgomery Police Commissioner, L. B. Sullivan, sued the ''Times'' for libel, saying the advertisement damaged his reputation. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the $500,000 judgment against the ''Times''. Justice Brennan suggested that public officials may sue for libel only if the statements in question were published with "[[actual malice]]"—"knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not".<ref>''Sullivan'' at 280</ref>{{sfn|Jasper|1999|pp=9–10}} In sum, the court held that "the First Amendment protects the publication of all statements, even false ones, about the conduct of public officials except when statements are made with actual malice (with knowledge that they are false or in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity)."<ref>{{cite web|title=New York Times v.

State constitutions provide free speech protections similar to those of the U.S. Constitution. In a few states, such as California, a state constitution has been interpreted as providing more comprehensive protections than the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has permitted states to extend such enhanced protections, most notably in ''[[Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins]]''.<ref>''[[Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins]]'', {{ussc|447|74|1980}}</ref> In that case, the Court unanimously ruled that while the First Amendment may allow private property owners to prohibit trespass by political speakers and petition-gatherers, California was permitted to restrict property owners whose property is equivalent to a traditional public forum (often shopping malls and grocery stores) from enforcing their private property rights to exclude such individuals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-196305310|title=Returning to the PruneYard: the unconstitutionality of state-sanctioned trespass in the name of speech|author=Gregory C.

A landmark decision for press freedom came in ''[[Near v. Minnesota]]'' (1931),<ref>''[[Near v. Minnesota]]'', {{ussc|283|697|1931}}</ref> in which the Supreme Court rejected [[prior restraint]] (pre-publication censorship). In this case, the Minnesota legislature passed a statute allowing courts to shut down "malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspapers", allowing a defense of truth only in cases where the truth had been told "with good motives and for justifiable ends".{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=43}} The Court applied the Free Press Clause to the states, rejecting the statute as unconstitutional. Hughes quoted Madison in the majority decision, writing, "The impairment of the fundamental security of life and property by criminal alliances and official neglect emphasizes the primary need of a vigilant and courageous press."{{sfn|Lewis|2007|pp=44–45}}
[[File:Daniel Ellsberg.jpg|thumb|The leak of the [[Pentagon Papers]] by [[Daniel Ellsberg]] (pictured here in 2018) led to ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]'' (1971), a landmark press freedom decision.]]

However, ''Near'' also noted an exception, allowing prior restraint in cases such as "publication of sailing dates of transports or the number or location of troops".{{sfn|Lewis|2007|pp=46–47}} This exception was a key point in another landmark case four decades later: ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]'' (1971),<ref>''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|403|713|1971}}</ref> in which the administration of President [[Richard Nixon]] sought to ban the publication of the [[Pentagon Papers]], classified government documents about the Vietnam War secretly copied by analyst [[Daniel Ellsberg]]. The Court found that the Nixon administration had not met the heavy burden of proof required for prior restraint. Justice Brennan, drawing on ''Near'' in a concurrent opinion, wrote that "only governmental allegation and proof that publication must inevitably, directly, and immediately cause the occurrence of an evil kindred to imperiling the safety of a transport already at sea can support even the issuance of an interim restraining order." Justices Black and Douglas went still further, writing that prior restraints were never justified.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001770.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509092209/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001770.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 9, 2013|title=New York Times Co. v.

The courts have rarely treated content-based regulation of journalism with any sympathy. In ''[[Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo]]'' (1974),<ref>''[[Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo]]'', {{ussc|418|241|1974}}</ref> the Court unanimously struck down a state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses. The state claimed the law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility. The Supreme Court found that freedom, but not responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-21201322.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509083623/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-21201322.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 9, 2013|title=Dan Paul, 85, leading lawyer for press freedom|author=Dennis Hevesi|date=February 2, 2010|work=The Boston Globe|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref>

Content-based regulation of television and radio, however, have been sustained by the Supreme Court in various cases. Since there is a limited number of frequencies for non-cable television and radio stations, the government licenses them to various companies. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that the problem of scarcity does not allow the raising of a First Amendment issue. The government may restrain broadcasters, but only on a content-neutral basis. In ''[[Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation]]'',<ref>''[[Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation]]'', {{ussc|438|726|1978}}</ref> the Supreme Court upheld the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s authority to restrict the use of "[[Decency|indecent]]" material in broadcasting.

State governments retain the right to tax newspapers, just as they may tax other commercial products. Generally, however, taxes that focus exclusively on newspapers have been found unconstitutional. In ''[[Grosjean v. American Press Co.]]'' (1936),<ref>''[[Grosjean v. American Press Co.]]'' {{ussc|297|233|1936}}</ref> the Court invalidated a state tax on newspaper advertising revenues, holding that the role of the press in creating "informed public opinion" was vital.{{sfn|Lewis|2007|p=46}} Similarly, some taxes that give preferential treatment to the press have been struck down. In ''Arkansas Writers' Project v. Ragland'' (1987),<ref>''Arkansas Writers' Project v. Ragland'', {{ussc|481|221|1987}}</ref> for instance, the Court invalidated an [[Arkansas]] law exempting "religious, professional, trade and sports journals" from taxation since the law amounted to the regulation of newspaper content. In ''Leathers v. Medlock'' (1991),<ref>''[[Leathers v. Medlock]]'', {{ussc|499|439|1991}}</ref> the Supreme Court found that states may treat different types of the media differently, such as by taxing cable television, but not newspapers. The Court found that "differential taxation of speakers, even members of the press, does not implicate the First Amendment unless the tax is directed at, or presents the danger of suppressing, particular ideas."<ref>''Leathers'', at 453</ref>

In ''[[Branzburg v. Hayes]]'' (1972),<ref>''[[Branzburg v. Hayes]]'', {{ussc|408|665|1972}}</ref> the Court ruled that the First Amendment did not give a journalist the right to refuse a [[subpoena]] from a [[grand jury]]. The issue decided in the case was whether a journalist could refuse to "appear and testify before state and Federal grand juries" basing the refusal on the belief that such appearance and testimony "abridges the freedom of speech and press guaranteed by the First Amendment".<ref>''Branzburg'', 667</ref> The decision was that such a protection was not provided by the First Amendment. However, a concurring opinion by Justice [[Lewis F. Powell]], in which he said a claim for press privilege "should be judged on its facts by the striking of a proper balance between freedom of the press and the obligation of all citizens to give relevant testimony with respect to criminal conduct. The balance of these vital constitutional and societal interests on a case-by-case basis accords with the tried and traditional way of adjudicating such questions," has been frequently cited by lower courts since the decision.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000283.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509085553/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000283.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 9, 2013|title=Branzburg v.

Beyond the political sphere, both speech and petition advance personal expression, although the right to petition is generally concerned with expression directed to the government seeking redress of a grievance.<ref name="Duryea"/>}}

The right of assembly is the [[Individual and group rights|individual right]] of people to come together and collectively express, promote, pursue, and defend their collective or shared ideas.<ref>Jeremy McBride, Freedom of Association, in The Essentials of{{nbsp}}... Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, London, 2005, pp. 18–20</ref> This right is equally important as those of free speech and free press, because, as observed by the Supreme Court of the United States in ''[[DeJonge v. Oregon]]'', 299 U.S. 353, 364, 365 (1937), the right of peaceable assembly is "cognate to those of free speech and free press and is equally fundamental{{nbsp}}... [It] is one that cannot be denied without violating those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all civil and political institutions—principles which the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] embodies in the general terms of [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due_Process_Clause|its due process clause]]{{nbsp}}... The holding of meetings for peaceable political action cannot be proscribed. Those who assist in the conduct of such meetings cannot be branded as criminals on that score. The question{{nbsp}}... is not as to the auspices under which the meeting is held but as to its purpose; not as to the relations of the speakers, but whether their utterances transcend the bounds of the freedom of speech which the Constitution protects."<ref name="Findlaw20121005" /> The right of peaceable assembly was originally distinguished from the right to petition.<ref name="Findlaw20121005" /> In ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1875),<ref>''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'', {{ussc|92|542|1875}}</ref>, the first case in which the right to assembly was before the Supreme Court,<ref name="Findlaw20121005" /> the court broadly declared the outlines of the right of assembly and its connection to the right of petition:
<blockquote>The right of the people peaceably to assemble for the purpose of petitioning Congress for a redress of grievances, or for anything else connected with the powers or duties of the National Government, is an attribute of national citizenship, and, as such, under protection of, and guaranteed by, the United States. The very idea of a government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances.<ref>''Cruikshank'', at 552</ref></blockquote>

Justice [[Morrison Waite]]'s opinion for the Court carefully distinguished the right to peaceably assemble as a secondary right, while the right to petition was labeled to be a primary right. Later cases, however, paid less attention to these distinctions.<ref name="Findlaw20121005" /> An example for this is ''[[Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization]]'' (1939), where it was decided that the freedom of assembly covered by the First Amendment applies to [[Forum (legal)|public forums]] like streets and parks.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Successes of the American Civil Liberties Union|url=https://www.aclu.org/successes-american-civil-liberties-union|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=June 26, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Findlaw20121005" /> In two 1960s decisions collectively known as forming the [[Noerr-Pennington doctrine]],{{efn|''[[Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc]]'' (1961) and ''[[United Mine Workers v. Pennington]]'' (1965)}} the Court established that the right to petition prohibited the application of [[antitrust law]] to statements made by private entities before public bodies: a monopolist may freely go before the city council and encourage the denial of its competitor's building permit without being subject to [[Sherman Act]] liability.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-321223711|title=Competition and the Noerr-Pennington doctrine: When should political activity be barred under European community competition law?|author=William Cooney|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=The George Washington International Law Review|via=[[Questia Online Library]]|url-access=subscription|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref>
