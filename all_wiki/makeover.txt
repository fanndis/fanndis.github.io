{{Wiktionary}}A '''makeover''' is a radical change in appearance. When the word is used to describe a change in [[human physical appearance]], it may imply a change in clothing, [[haircut]], or [[cosmetics]]. A personal makeover might also include [[plastic surgery]], [[Veneer (dentistry)|dental veneers]], or [[contact lens]]es. Sometimes a makeover is used to refer to non-physical things, such as a makeover of character, personality or attitude. It can also refer to a dramatic change in construction, such as when a building is renovated or is refurbished. Makeovers are usually referred to in a positive manner, as a way to start fresh or improve your life.

Computer software and online tools can also be used for performing what are known as '''Virtual Makeovers'''. Using a photograph of a human face, software can apply cosmetics, hairstyles, and various eyewear such as contact lenses and sunglasses in order to allow users to visualize different looks without physically trying them on. Today, virtual makeup works in real-time using phone camera tracking, and examples are Visage Technologies's MakeApp, [[L'Oreal]]'s Makeup Genius,<ref>"L'OREAL PARTNERS WITH VIVA TECHNOLOGY START UP CONNECT."
