'''Intact dilation and extraction''' ('''D&X,''' '''IDX''', '''intact D&E''') is a surgical procedure that removes an intact [[fetus]] from the [[uterus]]. The procedure is used both after [[miscarriage]]s and for [[abortion]]s in the second and third trimesters of [[pregnancy]].

It is also known as '''intact [[dilation and evacuation]] (D&E)''' and, in [[United States]] federal law, as '''partial-birth abortion.''' Partial-birth abortion is not an accepted medical term and is not used by abortion practitioners or the medical community at large.<ref name=Gonzales>''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=05-380 550 U.S. ____ (2007)]. Findlaw.com.

In 2000, although only 0.17% (2,232 of 1,313,000) of all abortions in the United States were performed using this procedure,<ref>Guttmacher.org [http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3500603.html Abortion Incidence and Services in the United States in 2000]</ref> it developed into a focal point of the [[abortion debate]]. Intact D&E of a fetus with a heartbeat was outlawed in most cases by the 2003 federal [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], which was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Gonzales v.

{{TOC limit}}

== Indications ==
As with non-intact D&E or labor induction in the second trimester, the purpose of D&E is to end a pregnancy by removing the fetus and placenta. Patients who are experiencing a [[miscarriage]] or who have a fetus diagnosed with severe [[congenital anomalies]] may prefer an intact procedure to allow for viewing of the remains, grieving, and achieving [[Closure (psychology)|closure]].<ref name="naf" /><ref name=":0">{{cite book|title=Danforth's Obstetrics and Gynecology|last=Gibbs|first=Ronald S.|publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7817-6937-2}}</ref> In cases where an autopsy is requested, an intact procedure allows for a more complete examination of the body. 

An intact D&E is also used in abortions to minimize the passage of instruments into the uterus, reducing the risk of trauma. It also reduces the risk of cervical lacerations that may be caused by the removal of bony parts from the uterus and the risk of retention of fetal parts in the uterus such as brain matter and tissue.<ref name="naf" />

==Procedure==
As with non-intact D&E, intact D&E may be safely performed in freestanding clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, and in hospitals. Intra-operative pain control is usually dependent on the setting and patient characteristics but commonly involves local analgesia with either IV sedation or general anesthesia. Preoperative antibiotics are administered to reduce the risk of infection.<ref name="naf2">{{cite book|title=Management of Unintended and Abnormal Pregnancy|last1=Paul|first1=Maureen|last2=Lichtenberg|first2=Steve|last3=Borgatta|first3=Lynn|last4=Grimes|first4=David A.|last5=Stubblefield|first5=Phillip G.|last6=Creinin|first6=Mitchell D.|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2011}}</ref> In cases where the woman is Rh-negative, [[Rho(D) immune globulin|Rho(D) immunoglobulin]] (RhoGam) is administered to prevent the risk of developing [[Hemolytic disease of the newborn|erythroblastosis fetalis]] (hemolytic disease of the newborn) in subsequent pregnancies.<ref name=":0" /> Intact D&E is more feasible among women with higher parity, at higher gestational ages, and when cervical dilation is greater.<ref name="naf" /> There are no absolute contraindications. 

=== Cervical preparation ===
The surgery is preceded by cervical preparation which may take several days. [[Laminaria stick|Osmotic dilators]], natural or synthetic rods that absorb moisture from the [[cervix]], are placed in the cervix and mechanically dilate the cervix over the course of hours to days. [[Misoprostol]] can be used to soften the cervix further. Intact D&E can only be performed with 2-5 centimeters of [[cervical dilation]].<ref name=":0" />

=== Feticide ===
Feticidal injection of [[digoxin]] or [[potassium chloride]] may be administered at the beginning of the procedure to allow for softening of the fetal bones or to comply with relevant laws in the physician's jurisdiction and the U.S. federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.<ref name="naf" /> Umbilical cord transection can also be used to induce fetal demise prior to removal.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tocce|first=Kristina|last2=Leach|first2=Kara K.|last3=Sheeder|first3=Jeanelle L.|last4=Nielson|first4=Kandice|last5=Teal|first5=Stephanie B.|date=2013-08-08|title=Umbilical cord transection to induce fetal demise prior to second-trimester D&E abortion|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24034582/|journal=Contraception|volume=88|issue=6|pages=712–716|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2013.08.001|issn=1879-0518|pmid=24034582}}</ref>

=== Removal of fetus and placenta ===
During the surgery, the fetus is removed from the uterus in the [[breech position]]. If the fetal presentation is not breech, forceps or manual manipulation can be used to turn it to a breech presentation while in the uterus (internal version).<ref name="naf3">{{cite book|title=Management of Unintended and Abnormal Pregnancy|last1=Paul|first1=Maureen|last2=Lichtenberg|first2=Steve|last3=Borgatta|first3=Lynn|last4=Grimes|first4=David A.|last5=Stubblefield|first5=Phillip G.|last6=Creinin|first6=Mitchell D.|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2011}}</ref> The fetal skull is usually the largest part of the fetal body and its removal may require mechanical collapse if it is too large to fit through the cervical canal.<ref name=":02">{{cite book|title=Danforth's Obstetrics and Gynecology|last=Gibbs|first=Ronald S.|publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7817-6937-2}}</ref> Decompression of the skull can be accomplished by incision and suction of the brain or by using forceps to collapse the skull.<ref name="naf" />

== Recovery ==
Recovery from an intact D&E is similar to recovery from a non-intact D&E. Postoperative pain is usually minimal and managed with [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]]. In cases of [[uterine atony]] and corresponding blood loss, [[Methylergometrine|methergine]] or misoprostol can be given to encourage uterine contraction and achieve hemostasis.<ref name=":0" /> Patients who have recently undergone an intact D&E are monitored for signs of coagulopathy, uterine perforation, uterine atony, retained tissue, or hemorrhage.<ref name="naf" />

== Complications ==
The risks of intact D&E are similar to the risks of non-intact D&E and include postoperative infection, hemorrhage, or uterine injury. Overall, the complication rate is low, with rates of serious complications (those requiring blood transfusion, surgery, or hospital treatment) ranging from 0 per 1,000 cases to 2.94 per 1,000 cases. The rate of minor complications is approximately 50 in 1,000 (5%), the same as the minor complication rate for non-intact D&E; the rate of serious complications is higher in non-intact D&E.<ref name="naf" />

Data directly comparing the safety of non-intact to intact D&E are limited.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Prager|first=Sarah Ward|last2=Oyer|first2=Deborah Jean|date=2009|title=Second-trimester surgical abortion|journal=Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=52|issue=2|pages=179–187|doi=10.1097/GRF.0b013e3181a2b43a|issn=1532-5520|pmid=19407524}}</ref> There is no difference in postoperative blood loss or major complications when compared to non-intact D&E.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chasen|first=Stephen T.|last2=Kalish|first2=Robin B.|last3=Gupta|first3=Meruka|last4=Kaufman|first4=Jane E.|last5=Rashbaum|first5=William K.|last6=Chervenak|first6=Frank A.|date=2004|title=Dilation and evacuation at >or=20 weeks: comparison of operative techniques|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=190|issue=5|pages=1180–1183|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2003.12.034|issn=0002-9378|pmid=15167815}}</ref> There is no difference in risk of subsequent preterm delivery.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chasen|first=Stephen T.|last2=Kalish|first2=Robin B.|last3=Gupta|first3=Meruka|last4=Kaufman|first4=Jane|last5=Chervenak|first5=Frank A.|date=2005|title=Obstetric outcomes after surgical abortion at > or = 20 weeks' gestation|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=193|issue=3 Pt 2|pages=1161–1164|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2005.05.078|issn=0002-9378|pmid=16157130}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chasen|first=Stephen T.|last2=Kalish|first2=Robin B.|last3=Gupta|first3=Meruka|last4=Kaufman|first4=Jane E.|last5=Rashbaum|first5=William K.|last6=Chervenak|first6=Frank A.|date=2004|title=Dilation and evacuation at >or=20 weeks: comparison of operative techniques|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=190|issue=5|pages=1180–1183|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2003.12.034|issn=0002-9378|pmid=15167815}}</ref> The risk of retained tissue is lower since the fetus is removed intact.<ref name="naf4">{{cite book|title=Management of Unintended and Abnormal Pregnancy|last1=Paul|first1=Maureen|last2=Lichtenberg|first2=Steve|last3=Borgatta|first3=Lynn|last4=Grimes|first4=David A.|last5=Stubblefield|first5=Phillip G.|last6=Creinin|first6=Mitchell D.|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2011}}</ref>

In some cases, the physician may not be able to remove the fetus intact due to anatomical limitations. This may present a psychological problem for the patient who wishes to view the remains, or make a comprehensive autopsy impossible, precluding an accurate postmortem diagnosis of fetal anomalies.<ref name="naf" />

[[Image:Signing the Partial-Birth Abortion ban.jpg|thumb|254px|right|The signing of the ''[[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] ]]

In the U.S., a [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act#"Partial-birth abortion" defined by lw|federal statute defines]] "partial-birth abortion" as any abortion in which the life of the fetus is terminated after having been extracted from the mother's body to a point "past the navel [of the fetus]" or "in the case of head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother" at the time the life is terminated. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the terms "partial-birth abortion" and "intact dilation and extraction" are basically synonymous.<ref name="SCOTUS">''Gonzales v. Carhart'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=05-380 550 U.S. ____ (2007)]. Findlaw.com. Retrieved 2007-04-19.</ref> However, there are cases where these overlapping terms do not coincide. For example, the intact D&E procedure may be used to remove a deceased fetus (e.g., due to a [[miscarriage]] or [[feticide]]) that is developed enough to require dilation of the cervix for its extraction.<ref name="extract">''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=05-380 550 U.S. ____ (2007)]. Findlaw.com. Retrieved 2007-04-30. ("If the intact D&E procedure is truly necessary in some circumstances, it appears likely an injection that kills the fetus is an alternative under the Act that allows the doctor to perform the procedure.")</ref> Removing a dead fetus does not meet the federal legal definition of "partial-birth abortion," which specifies that partial live delivery must precede "the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered, living fetus."<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1531- U.S. Code, Title 18, Part I, Chapter 74, Section 1531], "Partial-birth abortions prohibited."</ref>

In addition to the federal ban, there have also been a number of [[#State law|state partial-birth abortion bans]]. There, courts have found that state legislation (rather than federal legislation) intended to ban "partial-birth abortions" could be interpreted to apply to some non-intact [[dilation and evacuation]] (D&E) procedures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/reproductiverights/abortionbans/12669res20040326.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128182129/http://www.aclu.org/reproductiverights/abortionbans/12669res20040326.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 November 2005|title=American Civil Liberties Union :Abortion Bans: Myths and Facts|date=28 November 2005|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> Non-intact D&E, though performed at similar gestational ages, is a fundamentally different procedure.

===Controversy===
Intact D&E is a target of anti-abortion advocates who believe the procedure illustrates their contention that abortion, and especially [[Late termination of pregnancy|late-term abortion]], is the taking of a human life, and therefore both immoral and illegal. Critics consider the procedure to be [[infanticide]],<ref>Koukl, Gregory.

According to a [[BBC]] report about the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', "government lawyers and others who favour the ban, have said there are alternative and more widely used procedures that are still legal - which involves dismembering the fetus in the uterus."<ref>{{cite news | title = US top court backs abortion ban | publisher = BBC | date = 2007-04-18 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6569007.stm | accessdate = 2007-04-18 }}</ref> An article in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' magazine stated that, "Defending the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban... requires arguing to judges that pulling a fetus from a woman's body in dismembered pieces is legal, medically acceptable, and safe; but that pulling a fetus out intact, so that if the woman wishes the fetus can be wrapped in a blanket and handed to her, is appropriately punishable by a fine, or up to two years' imprisonment, or both."<ref name="harpers" /> Alternately, pro-life advocates frame the issue as one in which a partially-born infant's life is disposable, whereas pulling the infant only a few more inches down the birth canal automatically transforms it into "a living person, possessing rights and deserving of protection."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abortionfacts.com/facts/2|title=Fact #2: Every human being is a person. – AbortionFacts.com|website=www.abortionfacts.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that intact D&E remains legal as long as there is first a feticidal injection while the fetus is still completely inside of the mother's body.<ref name="extract" />

There is also controversy about why this procedure is used. Although prominent defenders of the method asserted during 1995 and 1996 that it was used only or mostly in acute medical circumstances, lobbyist Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the [[National Coalition of Abortion Providers]] (a trade association of abortion providers), told ''[[The New York Times]]'' (February 26, 1997): "In the vast majority of cases, the procedure is performed on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus that is 20 weeks or more along."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/26/us/an-abortion-rights-advocate-says-he-lied-about-procedure.html|title=An abortion rights advocate says he lied about procedure|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1997-02-26|page=A11|accessdate=2009-06-08 | first=David | last=Stout}}</ref>
Some prominent pro-life advocates quickly defended the accuracy of Fitzsimmons's statements,<ref>Ruth Padawer, [http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/PBA%20activists%20lied.pdf "Pro-choice advocates admit to deception"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614123430/http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/PBA%20activists%20lied.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }}, ''Bergen Record'', February 27, 1997.</ref> whilst others condemned Fitzsimmons as self-serving.<ref>Melanie Conklin, [https://archive.is/20120708152326/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1295/is_n9_v61/ai_19732071/ "Whatever happened to the abortion lobbyist who repented?"], ''The Progressive'', September, 1997.</ref>

In support of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, a nurse who witnessed three intact D&E procedures found them deeply disturbing, and described one performed on a 26½-week [[fetus]] with [[Down Syndrome]] in testimony before a Judiciary subcommittee of the US House of Representatives.<ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/215.htm Testimony of Brenda Pratt Shafer, R.N.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501040628/http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/215.htm |date=2007-05-01 }} Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee On The Constitution, U.S. House Of Representatives, March 21, 1996.

A journalist observed three intact and two non-intact D&E procedures involving fetuses ranging from 19 to 23 weeks. She "watched for any signs of fetal distress, but ... [she] could see no response, no reflexive spasm, nothing.

Abortion provider [[Warren Hern]] asserted in 2003 that "No peer-reviewed articles or case reports have ever been published describing anything such as 'partial-birth' abortion, 'Intact D&E' (for 'dilation and extraction'), or any of its synonyms."<ref>Hern, Warren. "Did I Violate the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban?" [http://www.slate.com/id/2090215/ (''Slate'', October 22, 2003)].</ref> Therefore, Hern expressed uncertainty about what all of these terms mean. The U.S. Supreme Court held in ''Gonzales v. Carhart'' that these terms of the federal statute are not vague because the statute specifically detailed the procedure being banned: it specified anatomical landmarks past which the fetus must not be delivered, and criminalized such a procedure only if an "overt" fatal act is performed on the fetus after "partial delivery."<ref name="SCOTUS"/>

===Legality in the United States===
{{Main|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act}}

==== Federal law ====
Since 1995, led by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] have moved several times to pass measures banning the procedure. Congress passed two such measures by wide margins during [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's presidency]], but Clinton [[veto]]ed those bills in April 1996 and October 1997 on the grounds that they did not include health exceptions. Subsequent congressional attempts at overriding the veto were unsuccessful.

A major part of the legal battle over banning the procedure relates to health exceptions, which would permit the procedure in special circumstances. The 1973 Supreme Court decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which declared many state-level abortion restrictions unconstitutional, allowed states to ban abortions of post-viable fetuses unless an abortion was "necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother." The companion ruling, ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', upheld against a vagueness challenge a state law that defined health to include mental as well as physical health. The Court has never explicitly held, as a matter of constitutional law, that states have to allow abortions of post-viable fetuses if doing so is necessary for the woman's mental health, but many read ''Doe'' as implying as much. The concern that the health exception can be read so liberally partly explains why supporters of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act did not want to include one.

In 2003, the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] (H.R. 760, S. 3) was signed into law; the House passed it on October 2 with a vote of 281–142, the Senate passed it on October 21 with a vote of 64–34, and President [[George W. Bush]] signed it into law on November 5.

Beginning in early 2004, the [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]], the [[National Abortion Federation]], and abortion doctors in Nebraska challenged the ban in [[United States district court|federal district courts]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District of California]], [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]], and [[United States District Court for the District of Nebraska|District of Nebraska]]. All three district courts ruled the ban unconstitutional that same year. Their respective [[United States court of appeals|federal courts of appeals]]&mdash;the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]], respectively&mdash;affirmed these rulings on appeal.

The three cases were all appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], and were consolidated into the case ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''. On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court voted to uphold the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] by a decision of 5–4.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mark |last=Sherman |title=Court Backs ban on abortion procedure |date=April 18, 2007 |publisher=SFGate |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/04/18/national/w070844D25.DTL&type=politics |accessdate=2007-04-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114231038/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2007%2F04%2F18%2Fnational%2Fw070844D25.DTL&type=politics |archive-date=November 14, 2007 }}</ref> Justice [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]] wrote for the majority and was joined by Justices [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]], [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]], [[Samuel Alito|Alito]], and Chief Justice [[John G.

====State law====
Many states have [[Late-term abortion#Legal restrictions on later abortion|bans on late-term abortions]] which apply to intact D&E if it is performed after [[Fetus#Viability|viability]].

Many states have also passed bans specifically on intact D&E. The first was Ohio, which in 1995 enacted a law that referred to the procedure as ''dilation and extraction''. In 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found the law unconstitutional on the grounds that it placed a substantial and unconstitutional obstacle in the path of women seeking pre-viability abortions in the [[second trimester]].

Between 1995 and 2000, 28 more states passed Partial-Birth Abortion bans, all similar to the proposed federal bans and all lacking an exemption for the health of the woman. Many of these state laws faced legal challenges, with Nebraska's the first to reach decision in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]''. The Federal District Court held Nebraska's statute unconstitutional on two counts. One being the bill's language was too broad, potentially rendering a range of abortion procedures illegal, and thus, creating an undue burden on a woman's ability to choose. The other count was the bill failed to provide a necessary exception for the health of the woman. The decision was appealed to and affirmed by both the Eighth Circuit and the Supreme Court in June 2000, thus resolving the legal challenges to similar state bans nationwide.

Since the ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' decision, Virginia, Michigan, and Utah have adopted legislation very similar to the Nebraska law overturned as unconstitutional. The Michigan law was similarly struck down for broadness and failure to provide a health exemption. Utah's law remains on the books, pending trial, but is unenforceable under a court-ordered preliminary injunction. Virginia's Law was initially ruled invalid, but was reversed and remanded to the District Court in the wake of the Gonzales v. Carhart decision, where it was upheld as constitutional. This is despite the fact the Virginia law criminalizes abortions for accidental or intentional intact D&E.

In 2000 Ohio introduced another "partial-birth abortion" ban. The law differed from previous attempts at the ban in that it specifically excluded D&amp;E procedures, while also providing a narrow health exception. This law was upheld on appeal to the Sixth Circuit in 2003 on the grounds that "it permitted the partial birth procedure when necessary to prevent significant health risks."

In 2003 the Michigan Senate introduced Senate Bill No. 395, which would have changed the definition of birth and therefore effectively ban intact D&E. would in effect ban partial birth abortions. The definition of birth as defined in the bill was that once any part of the body had passed beyond the introitus, it is considered a birth. The bill included an exemption for the mother's health. The bill was passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives but was vetoed by governor [[Jennifer Granholm]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

====Clinical response to legal bans on the procedure====
Since the passage of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in the United States and similar state laws, providers of later abortions typically induce and document [[feticide|fetal death]] before beginning any later abortion procedure. Since the bans only apply to abortions of living fetuses, this protects the abortion providers from prosecution. The most common method of inducing fetal demise is to inject digoxin intrafetally or potassium chloride intrathoracically.<ref name=":0" /><ref>http://www.societyfp.org/_documents/resources/InductionofFetalDemise.pdf</ref>

===In other countries===
Questioned about the policy of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] government on the issue in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], [[Kay Andrews, Baroness Andrews|Baroness Andrews]] stated that

<blockquote>We are not aware of the procedure referred to as "partial-birth abortion" being used in Great Britain. It is the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]]' (RCOG) belief that this method of abortion is never used as a primary or pro-active technique and is only ever likely to be performed in unforeseen circumstances in order to reduce maternal [[death|mortality]] or severe [[morbidity]].<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030512/text/30512w05.htm#30512w05_sbhd0 Text of a written answer to a parliamentary question] at The House of Lords ''[[Hansard]]''.
