{{short description|Self-guided improvement}}
{{Other uses}}
'''Self-help''' or '''self-improvement''' is a self-guided improvement<ref name="APA">''APA Dictionary of Physicology'', 1st ed., Gary R. VandenBos, ed., Washington: [[American Psychological Association[[, 2007.</ref>—economically, intellectually, or emotionally—often with a substantial [[psychology|psychological]] basis. 

When engaged in self-improvement, people often utilize publicly available information or [[support groups]], on the Internet as well as in person, where people in similar situations join together.<ref name="APA"/> From early examples in self-driven legal practice<ref name="Salerno 2005">Steve Salerno (2005) ''Sham: How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless'', {{ISBN|1-4000-5409-5}} pp. 24–25</ref> and home-spun advice, the connotations of the word have spread and often apply particularly to [[education]], [[business]], [[psychology]] and [[psychotherapy]], commonly distributed through the popular genre of [[self-help book]]s. According to the ''APA Dictionary of Psychology'', potential benefits of self-help groups that professionals may not be able to provide include friendship, emotional support, experiential knowledge, [[Identity (social science)|identity]], meaningful roles, and a sense of belonging.<ref name="APA"/>

Many different self-help group programs exist, each with its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, [[leadership|leader]]s. Concepts and terms originating in self-help culture and [[Twelve-step program|Twelve-Step]] culture, such as [[Recovery model|recovery]], [[dysfunctional families]], and [[codependency]] have become firmly integrated in mainstream language.<ref>Micki McGee. ''Self-Help, Inc.: Makeover Culture in American Life'' (Oxford 2005) p. 188.</ref>
Groups associated with health conditions may consist of patients and [[caregiver]]s. As well as featuring long-time members sharing [[experience]]s, these health groups can become [[support group]]s and clearing-houses for educational material. Those who help themselves by learning and identifying about health problems can be said to exemplify self-help, while self-help groups can be seen more as peer-to-peer or mutual-support groups.

==History==
Within [[classical antiquity]], [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' "opens with moral remonstrances, hammered home in every way that Hesiod can think of."<ref>
John Boardman et al eds., ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (Oxford 1991), p. 94</ref> The [[Stoics]] offered ethical advice "on the notion of ''eudaimonia''—of well-being, welfare, flourishing."<ref>Boardman, p. 371</ref> The genre of [[mirror-of-princes writing]]s, which has a long history in [[Greco-Roman]] and Western [[Renaissance]] literature, represents a secular cognate of Biblical wisdom-literature. [[Proverb]]s from many periods, collected and uncollected, embody traditional moral and practical advice of diverse cultures.

The hyphenated [[English compound|compound]] word "self-help" often appeared in the 1800s in a legal context, referring to the doctrine that a party in a dispute has the right to use lawful means on their own initiative to remedy a wrong.<ref>
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd edition, 1989) traces legal usage back to at least 1875; whereas it detects "self-help" as a moral virtue as early as 1831 in [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]]'s ''[[Sartor Resartus]]''.
</ref>

For some, [[George Combe]]'s "''Constitution''" [1828], in the way that it advocated [[personal responsibility]] and the possibility of naturally sanctioned self-improvement through education or proper self-control, largely inaugurated the self-help movement;"<ref>John Van Wyhe, ''Phrenology and the Origins of Victorian Scientific Naturalism'' (2004) p. 189</ref>{{Verify source|date=October 2015}} In 1841, an essay by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], entitled [[Compensation (essay)|Compensation]], was published suggesting "every man in his lifetime needs to thank his faults" and "acquire habits of ''self-help''" as "our strength grows out of our weakness."<ref>Ralph Waldo Emerson, ''Compensation'' (1841) p. 22 [http://www.emersoncentral.com/compensation.htm Essays]</ref> [[Samuel Smiles]] (1812–1904) published the first self-consciously personal-development "self-help" book—entitled ''[[Self-Help (book)|Self-Help]]''—in 1859. Its opening sentence: "Heaven helps those who help themselves", provides a variation of "God helps them that help themselves", the oft-quoted [[maxim (saying)|maxim]] that had also appeared previously in [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''[[Poor Richard's Almanac]]'' (1733–1758).

===Early 20th century===

In 1902, [[James Allen (author)|James Allen]] published ''[[As a Man Thinketh]]'', which proceeds from the conviction that "a man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts." Noble thoughts, the book maintains, make for a noble person, whilst lowly thoughts make for a miserable person. Several decades later, [[Napoleon Hill]]'s ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' (1937) described the use of repeated [[Optimism|positive thought]]s to attract happiness and wealth by tapping into an "[[Infinity|Infinite]] Intelligence".<ref>Starker, Steven (2002). ''Oracle at the Supermarket: The American Preoccupation With Self-Help Books''. Transaction Publishers. p. 62. {{ISBN|0-7658-0964-8}}</ref>

Around the same time, in 1936, [[Dale Carnegie]] further developed the genre with ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]''.<ref>Steven Starker, ''Oracle at the Supermarket'' (2002) p. 63</ref> Having failed in several careers, Carnegie became fascinated with success and its link to [[self-confidence]], and his books have since sold over 50 million copies.<ref>O'Neil, William J. (2003). ''Business Leaders & Success: 55 Top Business Leaders & How They Achieved Greatness''. [[McGraw-Hill Professional]]. pp. 35–36. {{ISBN|0-07-142680-9}}</ref>

===Late 20th century===

In the final third of the 20th century, "the tremendous growth in self-help publishing...in self-improvement culture"<ref>McGee, p. 12</ref> really took off—something which must be linked to [[postmodernism]] itself—to the way "postmodern subjectivity constructs self-reflexive subjects-in-process."<ref>Elizabeth Deeds Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (Princeton 1992) p. 58</ref> Arguably at least, "in the literature of self-improvement...that crisis of subject hood is not articulated but enacted—demonstrated in ever-expanding self-help book sales."<ref>McGee, p. 177</ref>

The conservative turn of the [[neoliberal]] decades also meant a decline in traditional political activism, and increasing "social isolation; Twelve-Step recovery groups were one context in which individuals sought a sense of community...yet another symptom of the psychological of the personal"<ref>
Mcgee, p. 97</ref> to more radical critics. Indeed, "some social theorist{{sic}} have argued that the late-20th century preoccupation with the self serves as a tool of social control: soothing political unrest...[for] one's own pursuit of self-invention."'<ref>McGee, p. 22–3</ref>

==The market==
Within the context of the market, group and corporate attempts to aid the "seeker" have moved into the "self-help" marketplace, with [[Large Group Awareness Training]]s, LGATs<ref>

===Self-help and professional service delivery===
Self-help and mutual-help are very different from—though they may complement—service delivery by professionals:<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Lloyd |first1=R |title=Modeling community-based, self-help mental health rehabilitation . |journal=Australasian Psychiatry |volume=15 Suppl 1 |pages=S99–103 |pmid=18027146 |year=2007 |doi=10.1080/10398560701701296 |s2cid=7492660 }}</ref> note, for example, the interface between local self-help and International Aid's service delivery model.

Conflicts can and do arise on that interface, however, with some professionals considering that "the twelve-step approach encourages a kind of contemporary version of 19th-century amateurism or enthusiasm in which self-examination and very general social observations are enough to draw rather large conclusions."<ref>{{cite book|author=Lennard J. Davis|title=Obsession: A History|location=London|year=2008|pages=171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5ATMl1uCCcC&q=Lennard+J.+Davis%2C+Obsession%3A+A+History|isbn=9780226137797}}</ref>

==Research==
The rise of self-help culture has inevitably led to boundary disputes with other approaches and disciplines. Some would object to their classification as "self-help" literature, as with "[[Deborah Tannen]]'s denial of the self-help role of her books" so as to maintain her academic credibility, aware of the danger that "writing a book that becomes a popular success...all but ensures that one's work will lose its long-term legitimacy."<ref>McGee, p. 195 and 245</ref>

[[Placebo]] effects can never be wholly discounted. Thus careful studies of "the power of subliminal self-help tapes...showed that their content had no real effect...But that's not what the participants thought."<ref>Eliot R. Smith/Diane M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (Hove 2007) p. 264</ref> "If they thought they'd listened to a self-esteem tape (even though half the labels were wrong), they felt that their self-esteem had gone up. No wonder people keep buying subliminal tape: even though the tapes don't work, people think they do."<ref>Smith/Mackie, p. 265</ref> One might then see much of the self-help industry as part of the "skin trades. People need haircuts, massage, dentistry, wigs and glasses, sociology and surgery, as well as love and advice."<ref>John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 6</ref>—a skin trade, "not a profession and a science"<ref>O'Neill, p. 7</ref> Its practitioners would thus be functioning as "part of the personal service industry rather than as mental health professionals."<ref>McGee, p. 229</ref> While "there is no proof that twelve-step programs 'are superior to any other intervention in reducing alcohol dependence or alcohol-related problems',"<ref>Nicholas Bakalar 2006, in Davis, p. 178-9</ref> at the same time it is clear that "there is something about 'roguishness' itself which is curative."<ref>Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis''(Penguin 1976) p. 294</ref> Thus for example "smoking increases mortality risk by a factor of just 1.6, while social isolation does so by a factor of 2.0...suggest[ING] an added value to self-help groups such as [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] as surrogate communities."<ref>Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 178</ref>

[[List of positive psychologists|Some psychologists]] advocate a [[positive psychology]], and explicitly embrace an empirical self-help philosophy; "the role of positive psychology is to become a bridge between the ivory tower and the main street—between the rigor of academe and the fun of the self-help movement."<ref>Tal Ben-Shachar, "Giving Positive Psychology Away" in C. R. Snyder et al, ''Positive Psychology'' (Sage 2010) p. 503</ref> They aim to refine the self-improvement field by way of an intentional increase in scientifically sound research and well-engineered models. The division of focus and methodologies has produced several sub fields, in particular: general positive psychology, focusing primarily on the study of psychological phenomenon and effects; and [[personal effectiveness]], focusing primarily on analysis, design and implementation of qualitative personal growth. This includes the intentional training of new patterns of thought and feeling. As business strategy communicator [[Don Tapscott]] puts it, "The design industry is something done to us. I'm proposing we each become designers. But I suppose 'I love the way she thinks' could take on new meaning."<ref>[http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_7.html Edge.org question center: Scientific concepts and cognitive toolkits, page 7]</ref>

Both self-talk, the propensity to engage in verbal or mental self-directed conversation and thought, and social support can be used as instruments of self-improvement, often by empowering, action-promoting messages. Psychologists have designed a series of experiments that are intended to shed light into how self-talk can result in self-improvement. In general, research has shown that people prefer to use second-person pronouns over first-person pronouns when engaging in self-talk to achieve goals, regulate one’s own behavior, thoughts, or emotions, and facilitate performance.<ref>Gammage, K. L., Hardy, J., & Hall, C. G. (2001). A description of self-talk in exercise. Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 2, 233–247</ref> If self-talk has the expected effect, then writing about personal problems using language from their friends’ perspective should result in greater amount of motivational and emotional benefits comparing to using language from their own perspective. When you need to finish a difficult task and you are not willing to do something to finish this task, trying to write a few sentence or goals imaging what your friends have told you gives you more motivational resources comparing to you write to yourself. Research done by Ireland and others have revealed that, as expected, when people are writing using many physical and mental words or even typing a standard prompt with these kinds of words, adopting a friend’s perspective while freely writing about a personal challenge can help increase people’s intention to improve self-control by promoting the positivity of emotions such as pride and satisfaction, which can motivate people to reach their goal.<ref>Ireland et al. (2014). A Friend to Myself: Thinking of a Friend in Self-Talk Strengthens Intentions to Improve Self-Control. Manuscript under review.</ref>

The use of self-talk goes beyond the scope of self-improvement for performing certain activities, self-talk as a linguistic form of self-help also plays a very important role in regulating people’s emotions under social stress. First of all, people using non-first-person language tend to exhibit higher level of visual self-distancing during the process of introspection, indicating that using non-first-person pronouns and one’s own name may result in enhanced self-distancing.<ref>Mischowski, D., Kross, E., & Bushman, B. (2012). Flies on the wall are less aggressive: The effect of self-distancing on aggressive affect, cognition, and behavior. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 48, 1187–1191. doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2012.03.012</ref><ref name="Kross, E. 2014">Kross, E., Bruehlman-Senecal, E., Park, J., Burson, A., Dougherty, A., Shablack, H., & Ayduk, O. (2014). Self-talk as a regulatory mechanism: How you do it matters. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 106(2), 304</ref> More importantly, this specific form of self-help also has been found can enhance people’s ability to regulate their thoughts, feelings, and behavior under social stress, which would lead them to appraise social-anxiety-provoking events in more challenging and less threatening terms. Additionally, these self-help behaviors also demonstrate noticeable self-regulatory effects through the process of social interactions, regardless of their dispositional vulnerability to social anxiety.<ref name="Kross, E. 2014"/>

==Criticism==
Scholars have targeted self-help claims as misleading and incorrect. In 2005, [[Steve Salerno]] portrayed the American self-help movement—he uses the acronym ''SHAM: the Self-Help and Actualization Movement''—not only as ineffective in achieving its goals, but also as socially harmful.<ref name="Salerno 2005"/> "Salerno says that 80 percent of self-help and motivational customers are repeat customers and they keep coming back 'whether the program worked for them or not'."<ref>Vicki Kunkel, ''Instant Appeal'' (2009) p. 94</ref> Others similarly point out that with [[self-help books]] "supply increases the demand... The more people read them, the more they think they need them... more like an addiction than an alliance."<ref>R. J. McAllister, ''Emotion: Mystery or Madness?'' (2007) pp. 156–7</ref>

Self-help writers have been described as working "in the area of the ideological, the imagined, the narrativized.... although a veneer of scientism permeates the[ir] work, there is also an underlying armature of moralizing."<ref>Davis, p. 173</ref>

[[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]] in his book ''[[God Is My Broker]]'' asserts: "The only way to get rich from a self-help book is to write one".<ref name=balance>{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=C|title=''God Is My Broker'', ''A Monk-Tycoon Reveals the 7 1/2 Laws of Spiritual and Financial Growth''|year=1998|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-06-097761-0|pages=185|url=https://archive.org/details/godismybrokermo000tybr}}</ref>

Self-help treatment books and the commercialization of psychotherapy. American Psychologist, 42, 46-51.</ref> raised concerns that psychologists were promoting untested self-help books with exaggerated claims rather than conducting studies that could advance the effectiveness of these programs to help the public. Rosen noted the potential benefits of self-help, but cautioned that good intentions were not sufficient to assure the efficacy and safety of self-administered instructional programs. Some 40 years later, Rosen and colleagues have observed that many psychologists continue to promote untested self-help programs, rather than contribute to the meaningful advancement of self-help. <ref>Rosen GM, Glasgow RE, Moore T, & Barrera M (2015).

===Parodies and fictional analogies===
The self-help world has become the target of [[parody|parodies]]. [[Walker Percy]]'s odd genre-busting ''[[Lost in the Cosmos]]''<ref>''Lost in the Cosmos: The Last Self-Help Book''. New York: Farrar, Straus, 1983.</ref> has been described as "a parody of self-help books, a philosophy textbook, and a collection of short stories, quizzes, diagrams, thought experiments, mathematical formulas, made-up dialogue".<ref>
[http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Walker-Percys-Weirdest-Book/23835/ Walker Percy's Weirdest Book]</ref> In their 2006 book ''Secrets of The Super optimist'', authors W.R. Morton and Nathaniel Whiten revealed the concept of "super optimism" as a humorous antidote to the overblown self-help book category.  In his comedy special ''[[Complaints and Grievances]]'' (2001), [[George Carlin]] observes that there is "no such thing" as self-help: anyone looking for help from someone else does not technically get "self" help; and one who accomplishes something without help, did not need help to begin with.<ref>{{cite video

</ref> In [[Margaret Atwood]]'s semi-satiric dystopia ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'', university literary studies have declined to the point that the protagonist, Snowman, is instructed to write his thesis on self-help books as literature; more revealing of the authors and of the society that produced them than genuinely helpful.
