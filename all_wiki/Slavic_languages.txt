The '''Slavic languages''', also known as the '''Slavonic languages''', are [[Indo-European languages]] spoken primarily by the [[Slavs|Slavic peoples]] or their descendants. They are thought to descend from a [[proto-language]] called [[Proto-Slavic]], spoken during the [[Early Middle Ages]], which in turn is thought to have descended from the earlier [[Proto-Balto-Slavic language]], linking the Slavic languages to the [[Baltic languages]] in a [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic group]] within the Indo-European family.

The Slavic languages are conventionally (that is, also on the basis of extralinguistic features) divided into three subgroups: [[East Slavic languages|East]], [[West Slavic languages|West]], and [[South Slavic languages|South]], which together constitute more than 20 languages. Of these, 10 have at least one million speakers and official status as the [[national language]]s of the countries in which they are predominantly spoken: [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (of the East group), [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] (of the West group) and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] (eastern dialects of the South group), and [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]] (western dialects of the South group). In addition, [[Aleksandr Dulichenko]] recognizes a number of [[Slavic microlanguages]]: both isolated ethnolects and peripheral dialects of more well-established Slavic languages.<ref>Dulichenko A.D., Малые славянские литературные языки (микроязыки). ''Языки мира: Славянские языки.'' М.: Academia, 2005.</ref><ref>Dulichenko A.D., ''Славянские литературные микроязыки. Вопросы формирования и развития.'' Tallinn, 1981.</ref><ref>Duličenko А.D., Kleinschriftsprachen in der slawischen Sprachenwelt. ''Zeitschrift für Slawistik'', 1994, Bd. 39.</ref>

The current geographic distribution of natively spoken Slavic languages includes [[Southern Europe]], [[Central Europe]], [[the Balkans]], [[Eastern Europe]], and all of the territory of [[Russia]], which includes northern and north-central Asia (though many [[minority languages of Russia]] are also still spoken). Furthermore, the diasporas of many Slavic peoples have established isolated minorities of speakers of their languages all over the world. The number of speakers of all Slavic languages together was estimated to be 315 million at the turn of the twenty-first century,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Slavic-languages|title=Slavic languages|last1=Browne|first1=Wayles|last2=Ivanov|first2=Vyacheslav Vsevolodovich|date=17 October 2019|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> it is the largest ethno-linguistic group in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |title=Slavic Countries |url=http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/slavic-countries.html |website=WorldAtlas |language=en}}</ref>{{sfn|Barford|2001|p=1}}

[[File:Geographical distribution of extant Slavic and East Baltic languages 2015.png|thumb|Ethnographic Map of Slavic and Baltic Languages]]
Since the interwar period scholars have conventionally divided Slavic languages, on the basis of geographical and genealogical principle, and with the use of the extralinguistic feature of script, into three main branches, that is, East, West and South. (From the vantage of linguistic features alone, there are only two branches of the Slavic languages, namely North and South.<ref>[[Peter Trudgill]]. 2003. ''A Glossary of Sociolinguistics''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp 36, 95–96, 124–125.</ref> These three conventional branches feature some of the following subbranches:

; [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]]
:* [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]
:* [[Russian language|Russian]]
:* [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]
:* [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]]

; [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]]

:*** [[Croatian language|Croatian]]
:*** [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]
:*** [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]
:*** [[Burgenland Croatian]]
:** [[Slovene language|Slovene]]

Some linguists speculate that a [[North Slavic languages|North Slavic]] branch has existed as well. The [[Old Novgorod dialect]] may have reflected some idiosyncrasies of this group.
[[Mutual intelligibility]] also plays a role in determining the West, East, and South branches. Speakers of languages within the same branch will in most cases be able to understand each other at least partially, but they are generally unable to across branches (which would be comparable to a native [[English language|English]] speaker trying to understand any other [[Germanic language]] besides [[Scots language|Scots]]).

The most obvious differences between the East, West and South Slavic branches are in the orthography of the standard languages: West Slavic languages (and Western South Slavic languages – [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]]) are written in the [[Latin script]], and have had more [[Western Europe]]an influence due to their proximity and speakers being historically [[Roman Catholic]], whereas the East Slavic and Eastern South Slavic languages are written in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and, with [[Eastern Orthodox]] or [[Uniate]] faith, have had more [[Greek language|Greek]] influence.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Kamusella|2005|p=77}}</ref> East Slavic languages such as Russian have, however, during and after [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]'s Europeanization campaign, absorbed many words of Latin, French, German, and Italian origin.

The tripartite division of the Slavic languages does not take into account the spoken [[dialect]]s of each language. Of these, certain so-called transitional dialects and hybrid dialects often bridge the gaps between different languages, showing similarities that do not stand out when comparing Slavic literary (i.e. standard) languages. For example, Slovak (West Slavic) and Ukrainian (East Slavic) are bridged by the [[Rusyn language]]/dialect of Eastern Slovakia and Western Ukraine.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Rusyn history and culture'', p 274, Paul R. Magocsi, Ivan Ivanovich Pop, University of Toronto Press, 2002</ref> Similarly, the Croatian [[Kajkavian]] dialect is more similar to [[Slovene language|Slovene]] than to the standard Croatian language.

Although the Slavic languages diverged from a common [[proto-language]] later than any other group of the [[Indo-European language]] family, enough differences exist between the various Slavic dialects and languages to make communication between speakers of different Slavic languages difficult. Within the individual Slavic languages, dialects may vary to a lesser degree, as those of Russian, or to a much greater degree, like those of Slovene.

===Common roots and ancestry===
[[File:Balto-Slavic lng.png|thumb|left|upright=1.18|Area of Balto-Slavic dialectic continuum (''purple'') with proposed material cultures correlating to speakers Balto-Slavic in Bronze Age (''white''). ''Red'' dots = archaic Slavic hydronyms]]

Slavic languages descend from [[Proto-Slavic]], their immediate [[parent language]], ultimately deriving from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], the ancestor language of all [[Indo-European languages]], via a [[Proto-Balto-Slavic language|Proto-Balto-Slavic]] stage. During the Proto-Balto-Slavic period a number of exclusive [[isogloss]]es in phonology, morphology, lexis, and syntax developed, which makes Slavic and [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] the closest related of all the Indo-European branches. The secession of the Balto-Slavic dialect ancestral to Proto-Slavic is estimated on archaeological and glottochronological criteria to have occurred sometime in the period 1500–1000 BCE.<ref>cf. {{Harvcoltxt|Novotná|Blažek|2007}} with references. "Classical glottochronology" conducted by Czech Slavist M. Čejka in 1974 dates the Balto-Slavic split to −910±340 BCE, Sergei Starostin in 1994 dates it to 1210 BCE, and "recalibrated glottochronology" conducted by Novotná & Blažek dates it to 1400–1340 BCE. This agrees well with Trziniec-Komarov culture, localized from Silesia to Central Ukraine and dated to the period 1500–1200 BCE.</ref>

A minority of Baltists maintain the view that the Slavic group of languages differs so radically from the neighboring Baltic group ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], and the now-extinct [[Old Prussian language|Old Prussian]]), that they could not have shared a parent language after the breakup of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] continuum about five millennia ago. Substantial advances in Balto-Slavic [[accentology]] that occurred in the last three decades, however, make this view very hard to maintain nowadays, especially when one considers that there was most likely no "Proto-Baltic" language and that West Baltic and East Baltic differ from each other as much as each of them does from Proto-Slavic.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Kapović|2008|p=94}} "Kako rekosmo, nije sigurno je li uopće bilo prabaltijskoga jezika. Čini se da su dvije posvjedočene, preživjele grane baltijskoga, istočna i zapadna, različite jedna od druge izvorno kao i svaka posebno od praslavenskoga".</ref>

===Evolution===
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2010}}
The imposition of [[Old Church Slavonic]] on Orthodox Slavs was often at the expense of the [[vernacular]]. Says WB Lockwood, a prominent Indo-European linguist, "It ([[Old Church Slavonic|O.C.S]]) remained in use to modern times but was more and more influenced by the living, evolving languages, so that one distinguishes Bulgarian, Serbian, and Russian varieties. The use of such media hampered the development of the local languages for literary purposes, and when they do appear the first attempts are usually in an artificially mixed style." (148)

Lockwood also notes that these languages have "enriched" themselves by drawing on Church Slavonic for the vocabulary of abstract concepts. The situation in the Catholic countries, where Latin was more important, was different. The Polish Renaissance poet [[Jan Kochanowski]] and the [[Croatia]]n [[Baroque]] writers of the 16th century all wrote in their respective vernaculars (though Polish itself had drawn amply on Latin in the same way Russian would eventually draw on Church Slavonic).

[[File:beresta.jpg|thumb|right|14th-century [[Novgorod]]ian children were literate enough to send each other [[Birch bark document|letters written on birch bark]].]]
Although Church Slavonic hampered [[vernacular literature]]s, it fostered Slavonic literary activity and abetted linguistic independence from external influences. Only the Croatian vernacular literary tradition nearly matches Church Slavonic in age. It began with the [[Vinodol Codex]] and continued through the Renaissance until the codifications of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] in 1830, though much of the literature between 1300 and 1500 was written in much the same mixture of the vernacular and Church Slavonic as prevailed in Russia and elsewhere.

The most important early monument of Croatian literacy is the [[Baška tablet]] from the late 11th century. It is a large [[stele|stone]] [[commemorative plaque|tablet]] found in the small [[Church of St. Lucy, Jurandvor]] on the Croatian [[island]] of [[Krk]], containing text written mostly in [[Čakavian]] dialect in angular Croatian [[Glagolitic]] script. The independence of [[Dubrovnik]] facilitated the continuity of the tradition.

[[File:ZographensisColour.jpg|right|upright=0.81|thumb|10th–11th century ''[[Codex Zographensis]]'', canonical monument of [[Old Church Slavonic]]]]
More recent foreign influences follow the same general pattern in Slavic languages as elsewhere and are governed by the political relationships of the Slavs. In the 17th century, bourgeois Russian (''delovoi jazyk'') absorbed German words through direct contacts between Russians and communities of German settlers in Russia. In the era of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], close contacts with [[France]] invited countless [[loan word]]s and [[calque]]s from [[French language|French]], many of which not only survived but also replaced older Slavonic loans. In the 19th century, Russian influenced most literary Slavic languages by one means or another.

===Differentiation===
The [[Proto-Slavic language]] existed until around AD 500. By the 7th century, it had broken apart into large dialectal zones.

There are no reliable hypotheses about the nature of the subsequent breakups of West and South Slavic. East Slavic is generally thought to converge to one [[Old East Slavic]] language, which existed until at least the 12th century.

Linguistic differentiation was accelerated by the dispersion of the Slavic peoples over a large territory, which in [[Central Europe]] exceeded the current extent of Slavic-speaking majorities. Written documents of the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries already display some local linguistic features. For example, the [[Freising manuscripts]] show a language that contains some phonetic and lexical elements peculiar to [[Slovene dialects]] (e.g. [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]], the word ''krilatec''). The Freising manuscripts are the first [[Latin script|Latin-script]] continuous text in a Slavic language.

The migration of Slavic speakers into the Balkans in the declining centuries of the [[Byzantine Empire]] expanded the area of Slavic speech, but the pre-existing writing (notably Greek) survived in this area. The arrival of the [[Hungarians]] in [[Pannonia]] in the 9th century interposed non-Slavic speakers between South and West Slavs. [[Franks|Frankish]] conquests completed the geographical separation between these two groups, also severing the connection between Slavs in [[Moravia]] and [[Lower Austria]] ([[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravians]]) and those in present-day [[Styria]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[East Tyrol]] in [[Austria]], and in the provinces of modern [[Slovenia]], where the ancestors of the [[Slovenes]] settled during first colonisation.

[[File:Slavic languages tree and map from Kushniarevich article.png|thumb|Map and tree of Slavic languages, according to Kassian and A. Dybo]]
In September 2015, Alexei Kassian and [[Anna Vladimirovna Dybo|Anna Dybo]] published,<ref>Kassian, Alexei, Anna Dybo, «Supplementary Information 2: Linguistics: Datasets; Methods; Results» in: {{cite journal|last1=Kushniarevich|first1=A|last2=Utevska|first2=O|last3=Chuhryaeva|first3=M|last4=Agdzhoyan|first4=A|last5=Dibirova|first5=K|last6=Uktveryte|first6=I|display-authors=etal|title=Genetic Heritage of the Balto-Slavic Speaking Populations: A Synthesis of Autosomal, Mitochondrial and Y-Chromosomal Data|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=9|year=2015|pages=e0135820|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0135820|pmid=26332464|pmc=4558026}}</ref> as a part of interdisciplinary study of Slavic ethnogenesis, a lexicostatistical classification of Slavic languages. It was built using qualitative 110-word Swadesh lists that were compiled according to the standards of the Global Lexicostatistical Database project<ref>{{cite web|url=http://starling.rinet.ru/new100/main.htm|title=The Global Lexicostatistical Database|publisher=Russian State University for the Humanities, Moscow}}</ref> and processed using modern phylogenetic algorithms.

The resulting dated tree complies with the traditional expert views on the Slavic group structure. Kassian-Dybo's tree suggests that Proto-Slavic first diverged into three branches: Eastern, Western and Southern. The Proto-Slavic break-up is dated to around 100 A.D., which correlates with the archaeological assessment of Slavic population in the early 1st millennium A.D. being spread on a large territory<ref>Sussex, Roland, Paul Cubberley. 2006. The Slavic languages. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. P.19.</ref> and already not being monolithic.<ref>Седов, В. В. 1995. Славяне в раннем средневековье. Москва: Фонд археологии. P. 5</ref> Then, in the 5th and 6th centuries A.D., these three Slavic branches almost simultaneously divided into sub-branches, which corresponds to the fast spread of the Slavs through Eastern Europe and the Balkans during the second half of the 1st millennium A.D. (the so-called Slavicization of Europe).<ref>Седов, В. В. 1979. Происхождение и ранняя история славян. Москва: Наука.</ref><ref>Barford, P.M. 2001.

The Slovenian language was excluded from the analysis, as both Ljubljana koine and Literary Slovenian show mixed lexical features of Southern and Western Slavic languages (which could possibly indicate the Western Slavic origin of Slovenian, which for a long time was being influenced on the part of the neighboring Serbo-Croatian dialects),{{original research inline|date=January 2019}} and the quality Swadesh lists were not yet collected for Slovenian dialects. Because of scarcity or unreliability of data, the study also did not cover the so-called Old Novgordian dialect, the Polabian language and some other Slavic lects.

The above Kassian-Dybo's research did not take into account the findings by Russian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak who stated that in the 11th century Novgorod language differed from Kiev language as well as from all other Slavic languages much more than in later centuries, meaning that there was no common [[Old East Slavic]] language of Kievan Rus' from which Ukrainian, Russian and Belorussian languages diverged, but that the Russian language developed as the convergence of Novgorod language and other Russian dialects, whereas Ukrainian and Belorusian were continuation of the development of respective Kiev and Polotsk dialects of Kievan Rus'.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zaliznyak |first1=Andrey Anatolyevich |title=About Russian Language History |url=https://elementy.ru/nauchno-populyarnaya_biblioteka/431649/Ob_istorii_russkogo_yazyka |website=elementy.ru |publisher=Mumi-Trol School |accessdate=21 May 2020}}</ref>

Also Russian linguist Sergey Nikolaev, analysing historical development of Slavic dialects’ accent system, concluded that a number of other tribes in Kievan Rus came from different Slavic branches and spoke distant Slavic dialects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://inslav.ru/publication/dybo-v-zamyatina-g-i-nikolaev-s-l-osnovy-slavyanskoy-akcentologii-m-1990 |website=inslav.ru |publisher=Slavic Studies Institute}}</ref>

Zaliznyak and Nikolaev's points mean that there was a convergence stage before the divergence or simultaneously, which was not taken into consideration by Kassian-Dybo's research.

Ukrainian linguists ([[Stepan Smal-Stotsky]], [[Ivan Ohienko]], [[George Shevelov]], Yevhen Tymchenko, Vsevolod Hantsov, Olena Kurylo) deny the existence of a common Old East Slavic language at any time in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/istkult/ikult01.htm |title=Мова (В.В.Німчук). 1.

===Linguistic history===
{{Main|History of the Slavic languages#Historical development up to Proto-Slavic|l1=Historical development of the Slavic languages up to the Proto-Slavic}}
{{See also|Proto-Slavic}}

The following is a summary of the main changes from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) leading up to the [[Common Slavic]] (CS) period immediately following the [[Proto-Slavic language]] (PS).

# [[Centum and satem languages|Satemisation]]:
#* PIE *ḱ, *ǵ, *ǵʰ → *ś, *ź, *źʰ (→ CS *s, *z, *z)
#* PIE *kʷ, *gʷ, *gʷʰ → *k, *g, *gʰ
# [[Ruki sound law|Ruki]] rule: Following *r, *u, *k or *i, PIE *s → *š (→ CS *x)
# Loss of [[voiced aspirate]]s: PIE *bʰ, *dʰ, *gʰ → *b, *d, *g
# Merger of *o and *a: PIE *a/*o, *ā/*ō → PS *a, *ā (→ CS *o, *a)
# Law of [[open syllable]]s: All [[closed syllable]]s (syllables ending in a consonant) are eventually eliminated, in the following stages:
## [[Nasalization]]: With *N indicating either *n or *m not immediately followed by a vowel: PIE *aN, *eN, *iN, *oN, *uN → *ą, *ę, *į, *ǫ, *ų (→ CS *ǫ, *ę, *ę, *ǫ, *y). (NOTE: *ą *ę etc. indicates a nasalized vowel.)
## In a cluster of [[obstruent]] (stop or fricative) + another consonant, the obstruent is deleted unless the cluster can occur word-initially.
## (occurs later, see below) [[Monophthongization]] of [[diphthong]]s.
## (occurs much later, see below) [[Slavic liquid metathesis and pleophony|Elimination of liquid diphthongs]] (e.g. *er, *ol when not followed immediately by a vowel).
# [[Slavic first palatalization|First palatalization]]: *k, *g, *x → CS *č, *ž, *š (pronounced {{IPAblink|tʃ}}, {{IPAblink|ʒ}}, {{IPAblink|ʃ}} respectively) before a front vocalic sound (*e, *ē, *i, *ī, *j).
# Iotation: Consonants are [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] by an immediately following *j:
#** sj, *zj → CS *š, *ž
#** nj, *lj, *rj → CS *ň, *ľ, *ř (pronounced {{IPA|[nʲ lʲ rʲ]}} or similar)
#** tj, *dj → CS *ť, *ď (probably [[palatal stop]]s, e.g. {{IPA|[c ɟ]}}, but developing in different ways depending on the language)
#** bj, *pj, *mj, *wj → *bľ, *pľ, *mľ, *wľ (the [[lateral consonant]] *ľ is mostly lost later on in [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]])
# Vowel fronting: After *j or some other palatal sound, back vowels are fronted (*a, *ā, *u, *ū, *ai, *au → *e, *ē, *i, *ī, *ei, *eu). This leads to hard/soft alternations in noun and adjective declensions.
# Prothesis: Before a word-initial vowel, *j or *w is usually inserted.
# [[Monophthongization]]: *ai, *au, *ei, *eu, *ū → *ē, *ū, *ī, *jū, *ȳ {{IPA|[ɨː]}}
# [[Slavic second palatalization|Second palatalization]]: *k, *g, *x → CS *c {{IPA|[ts]}}, *dz, *ś before new *ē (from earlier *ai). *ś later splits into *š (West Slavic), *s (East/South Slavic).
# Progressive palatalization (or "third palatalization"): *k, *g, *x → CS *c, *dz, *ś ''after'' *i, *ī in certain circumstances.
# Vowel quality shifts: All pairs of long/short vowels become differentiated as well by [[vowel quality]]:
#** a, *ā → CS *o, *a
#** e, *ē → CS *e, *ě (originally a low-front sound {{IPA|[æ]}} but eventually raised to {{IPA|[ie]}} in most dialects, developing in divergent ways)
#** i, *u → CS *ь, *ъ (also written *ĭ, *ŭ; lax vowels as in the English words ''pit, put'')
#** ī, *ū, *ȳ → CS *i, *u, *y
# [[Slavic liquid metathesis and pleophony|Elimination of liquid diphthongs]]: [[Liquid diphthong]]s (sequences of vowel plus *l or *r, when not immediately followed by a vowel) are changed so that the syllable becomes [[open syllable|open]]:
#** or, *ol, *er, *el → *ro, *lo, *re, *le in [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]].
#** or, *ol, *er, *el → *oro, *olo, *ere, *olo in [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]].
#** or, *ol, *er, *el → *rā, *lā, *re, *le in [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]].
#* Possibly, *ur, *ul, *ir, *il → syllabic *r, *l, *ř, *ľ (then develops in divergent ways).
# Development of phonemic tone and [[vowel length]] (independent of vowel quality): Complex developments (see [[History of the Slavic languages#Accentual developments|History of accentual developments in Slavic languages]]).

==Features==
The Slavic languages are a relatively homogeneous family, compared with other families of [[Indo-European languages]] (e.g. [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]).  As late as the 10th century AD, the entire Slavic-speaking area still functioned as a single, dialectally differentiated language, termed ''[[Common Slavic]]''. Compared with most other Indo-European languages, the Slavic languages are quite conservative, particularly in terms of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the means of inflecting nouns and verbs to indicate grammatical differences). Most Slavic languages have a rich, [[fusional language|fusional]] morphology that conserves much of the inflectional morphology of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]].<ref name="Comrie-Corbett-6" />

<sup>1</sup>The sound {{IPA|/sʲ/}} did not occur in West Slavic, where it had developed to {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.

This inventory of sounds is quite similar to what is found in most modern Slavic languages. The extensive series of [[palatal consonant]]s, along with the [[affricate]]s *ts and *dz, developed through a series of [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]]s that happened during the [[Proto-Slavic]] period, from earlier sequences either of [[velar consonant]]s followed by [[front vowel]]s (e.g. *ke, *ki, *ge, *gi, *xe, and *xi), or of various consonants followed by *j (e.g. *tj, *dj, *sj, *zj, *rj, *lj, *kj, and *gj, where *j is the [[palatal approximant]] ({{IPA|[j]}}, the sound of the English letter "y" in "yes" or "you").

The biggest change in this inventory results from a further [[History of the Slavic languages#General palatalization|general palatalization]] occurring near the end of the Common Slavic period, where ''all'' consonants became palatalized before front vowels. This produced a large number of new palatalized (or "soft") sounds, which formed pairs with the corresponding non-palatalized (or "hard") consonants<ref name="Comrie-Corbett-6">{{Harvcoltxt|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=6}}</ref> and absorbed the existing palatalized sounds {{IPA|*lʲ *rʲ *nʲ *sʲ}}. These sounds were best preserved in Russian but were lost to varying degrees in other languages (particularly Czech and Slovak). The following table shows the inventory of modern Russian:

This general process of palatalization did not occur in Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian. As a result, the modern consonant inventory of these languages is nearly identical to the Late Common Slavic inventory.

Late Common Slavic tolerated relatively few [[consonant cluster]]s. However, as a result of the loss of certain formerly present vowels (the weak [[yer]]s), {{failed verification span|the modern Slavic languages allow quite complex clusters, as in the Russian word {{lang|ru|'''взбл'''еск}} {{IPA-ru|vzblʲesk|}} ("flash"). Also present in many Slavic languages are clusters rarely found cross-linguistically, as in Russian {{lang|ru|'''рт'''уть}} {{IPA-ru|rtutʲ|}} ("mercury") or Polish {{lang|pl|'''mch'''u}} {{IPA-pl|mxu|}} ("moss", gen. sg.). The word for "mercury" with the initial ''rt-'' cluster, for example, is also found in the other East and West Slavic languages, although Slovak retains an epenthetic vowel ({{lang|sk|ortuť}}).|date=October 2020}}<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Nilsson|2014|p=41}}</ref>

===Vowels===
A typical vowel inventory is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
!
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Central vowel|Central]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
! style="text-align: left;" | [[Close vowel|Close]]
| style="font-size:120%" | {{IPA link|i}}
| style="font-size:120%" | {{IPA link|ɨ|(ɨ)}}
| style="font-size:120%" | {{IPA link|u}}
|-
! style="text-align: left;" | [[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| style="font-size:120%" | {{IPA link|e}}
| style="font-size:120%" |
| style="font-size:120%" | {{IPA link|o}}
|-
! style="text-align: left;" | [[Open vowel|Open]]
|
| style="font-size:120%" | {{IPA link|a}}
|
|}

The sound {{IPAblink|ɨ}} occurs only in some languages (Russian and Belarusian), and even in these languages, it is unclear whether it is its own [[phoneme]] or an [[allophone]] of /i/. Nonetheless, it is a quite prominent and noticeable characteristic of the languages in which it is present.
* Russian {{lang|ru|мышь}} {{Audio-IPA|Ru-мышь.ogg|[mɨʂ]}} and Polish {{lang|pl|mysz}} {{Audio-IPA|Pl-mysz.ogg|[mɨʂ]|help=no}} "mouse"

Common Slavic also had two [[nasal vowel]]s: *ę {{IPA|[ẽ]}} and *ǫ {{IPA|[õ]}}. However, these are preserved only in modern Polish (along with a few lesser-known dialects and microlanguages; see [[Yus]] for more details).
* Polish {{lang|pl|wąż}} {{Audio-IPA|Pl-wąż.ogg|/vɔ̃ʐ/|help=no}} and {{lang|pl|węże}} {{Audio-IPA|Pl-węże.ogg|/vɛ̃ʐɛ/|help=no}} "snake, snakes"

Other phonemic vowels are found in certain languages (e.g. the [[schwa]] {{IPA|/ə/}} in Bulgarian and Slovenian, distinct [[high-mid]] and [[low-mid]] vowels in Slovenian, and the lax front vowel {{IPA|/ɪ/}} in Ukrainian).

===Length, accent, and tone===
An area of great difference among Slavic languages is that of [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] (i.e. syllabic distinctions such as [[vowel length]], [[accent (phonetics)|accent]], and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]). Common Slavic had a complex system of prosody, inherited with little change from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. This consisted of [[phonemic]] vowel length and a free, mobile [[pitch accent]]:
* All vowels could occur either short or long, and this was phonemic (it could not automatically be predicted from other properties of the word).
* There was (at most) a single accented syllable per word, distinguished by higher pitch (as in modern [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) rather than greater dynamic stress (as in English).
* Vowels in accented syllables could be pronounced with either a rising or falling tone (i.e. there was ''pitch accent''), and this was phonemic.
* The accent was ''free'' in that it could occur on any syllable and was phonemic.
* The accent was ''mobile'' in that its position could potentially vary among closely related words within a single paradigm (e.g. the accent might land on a different syllable between the nominative and genitive singular of a given word).
* Even within a given inflectional class (e.g. masculine ''i''-stem nouns), there were multiple accent patterns in which a given word could be inflected. For example, most nouns in a particular inflectional class could follow one of three possible patterns: Either there was a consistent accent on the root (pattern A), predominant accent on the ending (pattern B), or accent that moved between the root and ending (pattern C). In patterns B and C, the accent in different parts of the paradigm shifted not only in location but also type (rising vs. falling). Each inflectional class had its own version of patterns B and C, which might differ significantly from one inflectional class to another.

The modern languages vary greatly in the extent to which they preserve this system. On one extreme, Serbo-Croatian preserves the system nearly unchanged (even more so in the conservative [[Chakavian dialect]]); on the other, Macedonian has basically lost the system in its entirety. Between them are found numerous variations:
* Slovenian preserves most of the system but has shortened all unaccented syllables and lengthened non-final accented syllables so that vowel length and accent position largely co-occur.
* Russian and Bulgarian have eliminated distinctive vowel length and tone and converted the accent into a [[stress (linguistics)|stress accent]] (as in English) but preserved its position. As a result, the complexity of the mobile accent and the multiple accent patterns still exists (particularly in Russian because it has preserved the Common Slavic noun inflections, while Bulgarian has lost them).
* Czech and Slovak have preserved phonemic vowel length and converted the distinctive tone of accented syllables into length distinctions. The phonemic accent is otherwise lost, but the former accent patterns are echoed to some extent in corresponding patterns of vowel length/shortness in the root. Paradigms with mobile vowel length/shortness do exist but only in a limited fashion, usually only with the zero-ending forms (nom. sg., acc. sg., and/or gen. pl., depending on inflectional class) having a different length from the other forms. (Czech has a couple of other "mobile" patterns, but they are rare and can usually be substituted with one of the "normal" mobile patterns or a non-mobile pattern.)
* [[Old Polish]] had a system very much like Czech. Modern Polish has lost vowel length, but some former short-long pairs have become distinguished by quality (e.g. {{IPA|[o oː]}} > {{IPA|[o u]}}), with the result that some words have vowel-quality changes that exactly mirror the mobile-length patterns in Czech and Slovak.

===Grammar===

{{expand section|date=February 2013}}

Similarly, Slavic languages have extensive morphophonemic alternations in their derivational and inflectional morphology,<ref name="Comrie-Corbett-6" /> including between velar and postalveolar consonants, front and back vowels, and a vowel and no vowel.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=8}}</ref>

==Influence on neighboring languages==
{{Cleanup lang|section|date=October 2020}}
{{main|Slavicism}}
[[File:West slavs 9th-10th c..png|upright=1.36|thumb|[[West Slavs|West Slav]] tribes in 9th–10th centuries]]
Most languages of the former [[Soviet Union]] and of some neighbouring countries (for example, [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]) are [[Russianism|significantly influenced by Russian]], especially in vocabulary. The [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] languages show the influence of the neighboring Slavic nations, especially in vocabulary pertaining to urban life, agriculture, and crafts and trade—the major cultural innovations at times of limited long-range cultural contact. In each one of these languages, Slavic lexical borrowings represent at least 15% of the total vocabulary. However, Romanian has much lower influence from Slavic than Albanian or Hungarian.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} This is potentially because Slavic tribes crossed and partially settled the territories inhabited by ancient [[Illyria]]ns and [[Vlach]]s on their way to the [[Balkans]].

=== Germanic languages ===
The Slavic contributions to Germanic languages remains a moot question, though [[Max Vasmer]], a specialist in Slavic etymology, has claimed that there were no Slavic loans into [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]]. Nevertheless, many linguists, including Andrzej Poppe, consider the Slavic contribution to the Germanic languages to be enormous. A large number of Slavic loanwords are found in the [[Gothic language]]: {{lang|got-Latn|hlaifs}} (bread, from [[Proto-Slavonic]] ''hleb''), {{lang|got-Latn|katils}} (cauldron, from [[Proto-Slavonic]] ''kotel''), {{lang|got-Latn|biuþs}} (table, from [[Proto-Slavonic]] ''bliudo''), {{lang|got-Latn|kaupjan}} (buy, from [[Proto-Slavonic]] ''kupit''), {{lang|got-Latn|skeinan}} (shine, from [[Proto-Slavonic]] ''sianye''), {{lang|got-Latn|boka}} (letter, from [[Proto-Slavonic]] ''bukva''), etc.<ref>{{Cite book|language=|author=Alexander Shilov|title=Slavonic borrowings in the Romano-Germanic languages|trans-title=|publisher=|location=Moscow|date=2015|isbn= 978-3-515-07560-2}} (It is based mainly on the English-Russian dictionary by W. Muller)</ref> On the other hand, scientists [[Rasmus Rask]] and [[August Schleicher]] argued that such a number of [[Slavicism]]s in the German language is explained by the fact that the Slavic and Germanic languages have a common origin.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Schleicher A.|title=Die ersten Spaltungen des indogermanischen Urvolkes|location=|publisher=Allgemeine Zeitung für Wissenschaft und Literatur |date=1853|ref=Schleicher}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |author=Rask R. K.|title=Undersögelse om det gamle Nordiske eller Islandske Sprogs Oprindelse|location=Kjöbenhavn|publisher=Gyldendal|date=1818|ref=Rask}}&nbsp;— xii&nbsp;+ 312&nbsp;s.</ref> 

However, there are isolated Slavic loans (mostly recent) into other Germanic languages. For example, the word for "border" (in modern [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Grenze}}, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|grens}}) was borrowed from the Common Slavic ''granica''. There are, however, many cities and villages of Slavic origin in Eastern Germany, the largest of which are [[Berlin]], [[Leipzig]] and [[Dresden]]. English derives ''[[Quark (cheese)|quark]]'' (a kind of cheese and [[Quark|subatomic particle]]) from the German {{lang|de|Quark}}, which in turn is derived from the Slavic ''tvarog'', which means "curd". Many German surnames, particularly in Eastern Germany and Austria, are Slavic in origin. [[Swedish language|Swedish]] also has {{lang|sv|torg}} (market place) from Old Russian {{lang|orv|tъrgъ}} or Polish {{lang|pl|targ}},<ref>{{cite dictionary

=== Finnic languages ===
[[Finnic languages|Finnic]] and Slavic languages have many words in common. According to Petri Kallio, this suggests borrowing Slavic words into Finnish languages, as early as Proto-Finnic.<ref>[https://blogs.helsinki.fi/slavica-helsingiensia/files/2019/11/sh27-Kallio.pdf On the Earliest Slavonic Loanwords in Finnic]. Ed. by Juhani Nuorluoto, Helsinki 2006, ISBN 952–10–2852–1</ref> Many loanwords have acquired a Finnicized form, making it difficult to say whether such a word is natively Finnic or Slavic.<ref>[https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/the-finnish-russian-relationships-the-interplay-of-economics-history-psychology-and-language THE FINNISH-RUSSIAN RELATIONSHIPS: THE INTERPLAY OF ECONOMICS, HISTORY, PSYCHOLOGY AND LANGUAGE] Mustajoki Arto, Protassova Ekaterina, 2014</ref>

=== Other ===
The [[Czech language|Czech]] word {{lang|cs|[[wikt:robot|robot]]}} is now found in most languages worldwide, and the word ''[[wikt:pistol|pistol]]'', probably also from Czech,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Titz |first1=Karel |title=Naše řeč – Ohlasy husitského válečnictví v Evropě |journal=Československý Vědecký ústav Vojenský |date=1922 |page=88 |url=http://nase-rec.ujc.cas.cz/archiv.php?art=1876 |accessdate=26 January 2019|language=Czech}}</ref> is found in many European languages, such as [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|[[wikt:πιστόλι|πιστόλι]]}}.

A well-known Slavic word in almost all European languages is [[vodka]], a borrowing from Russian {{lang|ru|водка}} ({{transl|ru|vodka}}) – which itself was borrowed from Polish {{lang|pl|wódka}} (lit. "little water"), from common Slavic ''voda'' ("water", [[cognate]] to the English word) with the [[diminutive]] ending "-ka".<ref>{{OEtymD|vodka|accessdate = 18 May 2007}}</ref><ref>Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary.

During the heyday of the [[USSR]] in the 20th century, many more Russian words became known worldwide: ''da'', ''[[Soviet Union|Soviet]]'', ''[[sputnik]]'', ''[[perestroika]]'', ''[[glasnost]]'', ''[[kolkhoz]]'', etc. Also in the English language borrowed from Russian is ''[[samovar]]'' (lit. "self-boiling") to refer to the specific Russian tea urn.

Interslavic in its current form was standardized in 2011 after the merger of several older projects.<ref>{{aut|Steenbergen, Jan van}}.
