'''Lee Hsien Loong''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Parliament of Singapore|MP]]}} ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=李显龙|t=|p=}}; born 10 February 1952) is a [[Singapore]]an politician. He served as the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|deputy prime minister]] under then-prime minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] from 1990 to 2004 and as [[Ministry of Finance (Singapore)|finance minister]] from 2001 to 2007. He has served as [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] and secretary-general of the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) since 2004 and is an elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Ang Mo Kio GRC]].

Born in [[Colony of Singapore|British Singapore]], Lee was the eldest son of Singapore's founding father [[Lee Kuan Yew]]. He later studied in [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[Cambridge University]], and graduated in 1974 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and a master's degree in [[Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science|computer science]]. In 1980 he earned a [[Master of Public Administration]] at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Kennedy School of Government]]. From 1971 to 1984, he served in the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) where he rose to the rank of [[brigadier general]]. Entering civilian politics in 1984, he was elected to Parliament as the MP for [[Teck Ghee Single Member Constituency|Teck Ghee SMC]], and upon its dissolution has represented Ang Mo Kio GRC since 1991.

Lee went on to serve in various ministerial appointments under Goh before succeeding him in 2004. His first two years saw the enactment of a “[[Workweek and weekend|five-day work week]]” and the extension of [[maternity leave]] days. His proposal to build two [[Integrated Resorts]] (IRs) in Singapore to increase tourism revenue led to the development of the [[Marina Bay Sands]] and [[Resorts World Sentosa]]. He later presided over the [[2008 financial crisis]] and oversaw the country's economic recovery within two years. Political reforms in 2010 legalised online activism and increased the number of [[Non-constituency Member of Parliament|non-elected opposition representatives]] (NCMPs) in Parliament.

His government has supported and stressed the need for [[Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST) hikes to fund [[social spending]] and infrastructure development, with the GST expected to be raised from 7% to 9% by at latest 2025. In 2019, the implementation of the [[Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act]] (POFMA) as a way to combat [[fake news]] was criticized as a limitation of free speech by some opposition politicians. The same year, Lee reshuffled his cabinet and promoted his expected successor [[Heng Swee Keat]] to deputy prime minister, as he prepares to step down by the time of the next [[General elections in Singapore|general election]].

In foreign policy, Lee's government's policy has been to stay neutral in an era of great power competition between [[China]] and the [[United States]]. Under Lee, both the Chinese and Singaporean governments have cooperated on projects, with Lee's government backing China's [[Belt and Road Initiative]] as one of its largest investors. At the same time, Singapore has a close defence relationship with the United States, signing the Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) in 2005 to cooperate on terrorist and cybersecurity threats. Lee's government has had complex and fraught relations with [[Malaysia]], particularly with regard to water supply and territorial claims, although the countries have agreed to work on several cross-border projects, such as the [[Kuala Lumpur–Singapore high-speed rail]] and the [[Johor Bahru–Singapore Rapid Transit System]].

===Education===
Lee studied at [[Nanyang Primary School]] and received his secondary education at [[Catholic High School (Singapore)|Catholic High School]], where he played clarinet in the school band,<ref name="Lee 2016 p. 171">{{cite book | last=Lee | first=Wei | title=A Hakka woman's Singapore stories : my life as a daughter, doctor, and diehard Singaporean | publisher=Straits Times Press | location=Singapore | year=2016 | isbn=978-981-4642-47-7 | oclc=918935420 | page=171}}</ref> before going on to [[National Junior College]].

In 1980, he completed his master's degree in public administration at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]], Harvard University.

===Military career===
Lee joined the SAF in 1971, and served as an officer from 1974 to 1984. In 1978, he attended the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], and held various staff and command posts, including the ''Director of the Joint Operations and Plans Directorate'' (Director, JOPD), and ''Chief of Staff of the General Staff'' (COS, GS). Lee rose quickly through the ranks in the [[Singapore Army]], becoming the youngest [[brigadier-general]] in Singaporean history after his promotion in July 1983. Notably, he was put in command of the rescue operations following the [[Singapore Cable Car disaster|Sentosa cable car disaster]]. Lee served as commanding officer (CO) of 23rd Singapore Artillery (23SA) in the Singapore Army before he left the SAF in 1984 to pursue civilian politics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pm-lee-my-army-buddy-what-it-was-like-doing-ns-with-the-man-who-9358656|title='PM Lee, my army buddy': What it was like doing NS with the man who became Prime Minister|access-date=19 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819114359/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pm-lee-my-army-buddy-what-it-was-like-doing-ns-with-the-man-who-9358656|archive-date=19 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cabinet.gov.sg/content/cabinet/appointments/mr_lee_hsien_loong/biodata.html|title=The Cabinet|accessdate=12 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819140333/http://www.cabinet.gov.sg/content/cabinet/appointments/mr_lee_hsien_loong/biodata.html|archive-date=19 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Early political career==
In the 1980s, Lee was regarded as the core member of the next batch of new leaders in the People's Action Party (PAP) [[Leadership transition in the People's Action Party|leadership transition]] that was taking place in the mid-1980s, as Lee Kuan Yew had declared that he would step down as prime minister in 1984. Following the [[1984 Singaporean general election|1984 general election]], all of the old [[Central Executive Committee (PAP)|Central Executive Committee]] members resigned on 1 January 1985, except for Lee Kuan Yew himself.<ref name=trans1985>{{cite journal|last=Chan|first=Heng Chee|title=Singapre in 1985: Managing Political Transition and Economic Recession|journal=Asian Survey|volume=26|issue=2|year=1986|publisher=University of California Press|pages=158–167|jstor=2644451|doi=10.2307/2644451}}</ref>

Lee was first elected [[Parliament of Singapore|Member of Parliament]] for the [[Teck Ghee Single Member Constituency|Teck Ghee SMC]] in 1984 at the age of 32. He was subsequently appointed Minister of State in the [[Ministry of Trade and Industry (Singapore)|Ministry of Trade and Industry]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Ministry of Defence]].

In 1985, Lee chaired the government's economic committee, which recommended changes to established government policies to reduce business costs, foster longer-term growth and revive the Singapore economy, which was experiencing a recession at the time. The committee's recommendations included reductions in corporate and personal taxes and the introduction of a [[consumption tax]].

In 1986, Lee was appointed the acting trade and industry minister. In 1987, he became a full member of the Cabinet as the minister for trade and industry and second minister for defence.

===PAP Youth Committee===
In March 1986, First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong discussed the question with Lee on encouraging younger Singaporeans to join the party. Goh was firm that the proposed committee should attract only the right kinds of members, ruling out material rewards as an incentive. The proposed youth wing was to encourage the improvement of the system from within, which would give new members a stake in the country's future. Lee later said the establishment of the youth wing reflected concerns by the leadership that the lack of an official channel to engage with the younger generation might lead them to vote for opposition parties and potentially bring the PAP government down. The youth wing was an official "tailor-made" mechanism to allow dissenting opinions to be heard.

Lee was the first chairman of the PAP Youth Committee upon its establishment, the predecessor to [[Young PAP]].<ref name=officialhist>{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.youngpap.org.sg/about/history/|publisher=Young PAP|accessdate=7 January 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320115046/http://www.youngpap.org.sg/about/history/|archive-date=20 March 2014}}</ref>

==Deputy Prime Minister==
===Ministerial duties===
On 28 November 1990, Goh Chok Tong succeeded Lee Kuan Yew as prime minister. Lee Hsien Loong was made one of two deputy prime ministers, along with [[Ong Teng Cheong]]. He continued to serve as the minister for trade and industry until 1992, when he was diagnosed with [[lymphoma]]. He subsequently relinquished his ministerial position and underwent three months of [[chemotherapy]], though he continued to be a deputy prime minister during his illness. The chemotherapy was successful, and his cancer has gone into remission.

Lee was appointed chairman of the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]] (MAS) in January 1998,<ref name="monetaryauthoritychairmen">{{cite web |title=Our History |url=https://www.mas.gov.sg/who-we-are/Our-History |website=Monetary Authority of Singapore |accessdate=7 September 2020 |archive-date=14 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200914180420/https://www.mas.gov.sg/who-we-are/Our-History |url-status=live }}</ref> and in 2001 he was made the [[Minister for Finance (Singapore)|finance minister]]. To ease the growing budget deficit due to falling tax revenues from cuts in corporate and personal income taxes and other factors such as the [[Iraq War]] and [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS]] outbreak, Lee proposed on 29 August 2003 to raise the [[Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)|GST]] from three percent to five percent, a change that took place in January 2004.

Lee initiated several amendments to render requirements for [[Singapore citizenship]] less restrictive, notably for foreign-born children of Singaporean women.<ref>{{cite web |author=Chuang Peck Ming |url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/push-rights-singapore-womens-foreign-born |title=Push For Rights Of Singapore Women's Foreign-born |publisher=Yaleglobal.yale.edu |date=12 June 2003 |accessdate=2 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522012227/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/push-rights-singapore-womens-foreign-born |archive-date=22 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The changes were made after repeated pleas from MPs and the [[Remaking Singapore Committee]].

===Visit to Taiwan===
On 10 July 2004, Lee visited [[Taiwan]], an island claimed by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) that has been ruled by the [[Government of the Republic of China|Republic of China]] (ROC) since 1949. Even after the severing of diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on 3 October 1990 in favour of the People's Republic, the Singapore government maintains a policy of neutrality in the [[Cross-Strait relations]] between the two sides. To facilitate the policy, it was considered important for Lee to get a "personal feel for the situation" in Taiwan. Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials advised that any visit by an incumbent prime minister would be diplomatically impossible. The visit was hence planned a month before Lee assumed the premiership and in his capacity as a private citizen, not a state leader, with the PRC embassy informed on 9 July 2004. The same afternoon, the PRC government summoned the Singapore ambassador in Beijing and urged the cancellation of Lee's trip, citing the likelihood that [[Chen Shui Bian]]'s administration would exploit it as a diplomatic coup and use it to promote [[Taiwan independence]], claiming Singapore was making a "historical error". Foreign Minister [[S Jayakumar]] replied to his counterpart [[Li Zhaoxing]] that Taiwan had been told to keep the visit low-profile and that it would proceed.<ref name="diplomacysjaya">{{cite book |last1=Shunmugam |first1=Jaya Kumar |title=Diplomacy: A Singapore Experience |date=1 January 2011 |publisher=Straits Times Press |isbn=978-9814266949}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Taiwan: China disappointed with Singapore Official Visit to Taipei |url=https://unpo.org/article/918 |accessdate=7 September 2020 |agency=Channel News Asia |publisher=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization |date=13 July 2004 |archive-date=30 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030050258/https://unpo.org/article/918 |url-status=live }}</ref>

China retaliated by cancelling several visits by high-ranking PRC officials to Singapore and delaying planned [[signing ceremony|signing ceremonies]], hinting that free trade negotiations would also be pushed back. The matter was further complicated and magnified when Taiwanese media headlined the visit and portrayed it as a diplomatic breakthrough, which raised tensions with the PRC. Singapore published the records of the discussion with the Chinese embassy in its local media to publicize the PRC's strong-arm tactics and failure to commit to a [[New security concept|peaceful agenda]].<ref name="diplomacysjaya"/>

On 28 August 2004, in his first National Day Rally speech and as prime minister, Lee criticized the Taiwanese leadership and populace over their pro-independence stance.

On 12 August 2004, Lee succeeded [[Goh Chok Tong]] as Prime Minister and relinquished his chairmanship of the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]] to Goh. [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] [[Yong Pung How]] swore Lee in at [[the Istana]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Singapore swears in a new leader |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3558444.stm |accessdate=20 September 2020 |agency=BBC News |date=12 August 2004 |archive-date=28 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128182446/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3558444.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

In his maiden [[National Day Rally]] speech on 22 August 2004, Lee announced several new initiatives, among them the policy of the "five-day work week" which removed the half-working day on Saturday.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Suryadinata |first1=Leo |title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary |date=2012 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |isbn=978-981-4345-21-7 |pages=512 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA512 |accessdate=26 August 2020 |archive-date=5 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200905022150/https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA512#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> The plan took effect on 1 January 2005.

In November 2004, Lee sparked a national debate when he proposed to build two [[Integrated Resort]]s (IRs), or hotel-casinos. Despite the longstanding stance against gambling in Singapore, with the exception of regulated industries such as the [[Singapore Turf Club]] and [[Singapore Pools]], the government was concerned its stance was hurting the economic competitiveness of the country, risking the loss of tourism revenue to other cities. In April 2005, despite some public opposition, the government approved the proposal. The IRs were built in [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]] and [[Sentosa]]. To limit the negative social impact of [[casino]] gambling, Lee suggested safeguards such as prohibiting minors from the casinos and charging an entrance fee for Singaporeans of [[S$]]100 (or S$2000 for a yearly pass). The Casino Control Act was enacted into law on 1 June 2006, which regulated the operations of the casino operators and provided social safeguards intended to deter problem gambling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1615_2009-11-30.html|title=Casino Control Act - Infopedia|first=National Library Board|last=Singapore|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=6 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206220933/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1615_2009-11-30.html|archive-date=6 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===2006–2011: Second term===
{{Expand section|1=information on his second term|section=1|date=August 2020}}
In that election, the PAP won 82 of the 84 seats, including 37 walkovers. The [[Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency|Ang Mo Kio GRC]] was contested for the first time in 15 years. The [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] (WP) claimed that they wanted to give Ang Mo Kio residents a chance to exercise their vote. Lee and his six-member GRC team won 60.42% of the votes against WP's inexperienced team.

On 29 November 2007, Lee announced that he would relinquish his finance ministerial portfolio to [[Tharman Shanmugaratnam]] on 1 December 2007. The handover was largely supported by business analysts, who felt that the importance of the position necessitated the dedication of a full-time minister for Singapore to entrench and promote its role as a financial hub. Regional economist Song Seng Wun said that with the growing sophistication of the economy and the financial markets' increasing volatility, Lee "may not have the full-time attention" due to his concurrent duties as prime minister.<ref name="TharmanFM">{{cite web |last1=Popatlal |first1=Asha |title=PM Lee to relinquish Finance Minister post, Tharman takes over |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/314525/1/.html |website=Channel NewsAsia |accessdate=16 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130041800/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/314525/1/.html |archive-date=30 November 2007 |date=29 November 2007}}</ref>

====2008 financial crisis====
The economy grew for the first two years of Lee's tenure but plunged 12.5% during the worldwide [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]] following the [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers crash]]. Singapore became the first Asian country to slip into a recession during the fourth quarter of 2008, with the financial, construction and manufacturing sectors being particularly affected by the crisis; the downturn was attributed to the city's trade-dependent economy.<ref name=jordanjournal>{{cite journal |last1=Rolf |first1=Jordan |title=Singapore in its Worst Recession for Years.

====Political reforms====
On 27 May 2009, Lee gave a speech in Parliament validating the roles of nonpartisan [[Nominated Member of Parliament|Nominated Members of Parliament]] (NMP) and praising the NMP scheme as having improved "quality of debate" in the-PAP dominated parliament.

Construction and refurbishment of new port and rail infrastructure, coupled with economic restructuring and training of workers, also necessitated tax increases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-to-raise-taxes-as-govt-spending-increases |title=Singapore to raise taxes as govt spending increases |last=Seow |first=Joanna |date=20 November 2017 |access-date=7 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207144438/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-to-raise-taxes-as-govt-spending-increases |archive-date=7 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The taxes raised would be in the form of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)|GST]], which is expected to rise from 7% to 9% by 2025.

In his Budget 2020 speech in February, Heng announced amendments to the GST Voucher Fund Act that would allow grants-in-aid to be given to parents or guardians for infants and children to mitigate their expenses. Second Minister for Finance [[Lawrence Wong]] said the intent was to expand the range of people who qualify for the fund. With the amendment, the Act would allow for the funding of the $6 billion Assurance Package, which was intended to delay the impact of the impending hike for five years.<ref>{{cite news |title=Parliament: Law changed to allow use of a fund for new Assurance Package to delay impact of GST hike |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-law-changed-to-allow-use-of-a-fund-for-new-assurance-package-to-delay-impact-of |accessdate=27 August 2020 |agency=The Straits Times |date=26 March 2020 |archive-date=28 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728144657/https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-law-changed-to-allow-use-of-a-fund-for-new-assurance-package-to-delay-impact-of |url-status=live }}</ref>

The proposed hike met with broad disapproval from the opposition, with the Workers' Party and Progress Singapore Party calling for the GST to be retained at its present rate of 7% and others calling for the GST to be suspended entirely or for the exemption of essential goods from the tax.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lim |first1=Yan Liang |title=GST: To raise, suspend or exempt? |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/6-gst-to-raise-suspend-or-exempt |accessdate=27 August 2020 |agency=The Straits Times |date=5 July 2020 |archive-date=13 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200713071438/https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/6-gst-to-raise-suspend-or-exempt |url-status=live }}</ref>

====POFMA implementation====
The [[Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act]] (POFMA), colloquially known as the "fake news law", was first mooted when Minister of Law and Home Affairs [[K Shanmugam]] noted that the proliferation of unverified news online had caused racial tensions and wasted public monies with unnecessary investigations into false matters. He claimed that fake news, when not debunked, can quickly harm Singaporeans, waste emergency resources, and damage reputations. He also claimed that nasty people seek to profit from fake news and that foreign agencies and foreign governments seek to destabilise the government with fake news.<ref name="fakenews">{{cite web|title=Government 'seriously considering' how to deal with fake news: Shanmugam|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/government--seriously-considering--how-to-deal-with-fake-news-sh-8712436|website=Channel NewsAsia|date=3 April 2017|access-date=26 August 2020|archive-date=27 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927125021/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/government--seriously-considering--how-to-deal-with-fake-news-sh-8712436|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods|Select Committee]] was formed on 11 January 2018 to examine the problem of deliberate online falsehoods, examine strategies to deal with them, and conduct public consultation on the proposed law.

====Response to COVID-19 pandemic====
The first [[COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore|COVID-19 case in Singapore]] was confirmed on 23 January 2020. Early cases were primarily imported until local transmission began to develop. By late March, clusters were detected at multiple dormitories for foreign workers, which soon contributed to an overwhelming number of new cases in the country. In response, Lee announced on 3 April 2020 that Singapore would enter a limited [[lockdown]] with restrictions on movement. The policy, officially called "[[2020 Singapore circuit breaker measures|circuit breaker]]" in governmental parlance, was intended to halt the disease's spread in the wider community. Workplaces were shut and all schools switched to home-based learning from 7 April to 1 June. Lee served as advisor to a multi-ministry level task force that had been set up in January, chaired by Minister for Education [[Lawrence Wong]] and Minister for Health [[Gan Kim Yong]].<ref name="ST22Jan">{{cite web|title=Wuhan virus: MOH sets up multi-ministry taskforce, advises against non-essential trips to Wuhan|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/wuhan-virus-3-more-suspected-cases-in-singapore-avoid-non-essential-travel-to-wuhan|last1=Goh|first1=Timothy|date=22 January 2020|website=The Straits Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122134325/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/wuhan-virus-3-more-suspected-cases-in-singapore-avoid-non-essential-travel-to-wuhan|archive-date=22 January 2020|accessdate=22 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/multi-ministry-taskforce-on-wuhan-coronavirus-and-tor---final.pdf |title=Multi-Ministry Taskforce on Wuhan Coronavirus: Terms of Reference (TORs) and Composition |access-date=21 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200321054236/https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/multi-ministry-taskforce-on-wuhan-coronavirus-and-tor---final.pdf |archive-date=21 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Lee's government also contributed US$500,000 to support the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Singapore contributes US$500,000 to support WHO efforts against COVID-19 |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-contributes-s-500-000-to-support-who-covid-19-efforts-12568566 |accessdate=25 March 2020 |work=CNA |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200325020159/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-contributes-s-500-000-to-support-who-covid-19-efforts-12568566 |archive-date=25 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Legal suits==
===Allegations of nepotism===
In 2010, Lee, together with his predecessors, threatened legal action against [[The New York Times Company]] which owns the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' regarding an op-ed piece titled "All in the Family" of 15 February 2010 by Philip Bowring, a freelance columnist and former editor of the ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]''. The ''International Herald Tribune'' apologised in March that readers of the article may "infer that the younger Lee did not achieve his position through merit". The New York Times Company and Bowring agreed to pay S$60,000 to Lee, S$50,000 to Lee Kuan Yew and S$50,000 to Goh (amounting to about US$114,000 at the time), in addition to legal costs. The case stemmed from a 1994 settlement between the three Singaporean leaders and the paper about an article also by Bowring that referred to 'dynastic politics' in East Asian countries, including Singapore. In that settlement, Bowring agreed not to say or imply that the younger Lee had attained his position through nepotism.

In response, media rights watchdog [[Reporters Without Borders]] wrote an open letter urging Lee and other top Singapore government officials to stop taking "libel actions" against journalists.<ref name="Richard Perez-Pena" /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gGg8uUSPiBjYefuEejHIS17FU7MAD9ELK1101 |title=NY Times pays damages to Singapore leaders |author=Alex Kennedy |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=25 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328234925/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gGg8uUSPiBjYefuEejHIS17FU7MAD9ELK1101 |archive-date=28 March 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iT7AgeoMNlFm88Nv9zofXLyb8ljw |title=''New York Times'' to pay damages to Singapore leaders |agency=Agence France-Presse |accessdate=25 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219173110/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iT7AgeoMNlFm88Nv9zofXLyb8ljw |archive-date=19 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/172827/ |title=Stop suing journalists: RSF tells Singapore leaders |date=26 March 2010 |work=Bangkok Post |accessdate=26 March 2010 }}</ref> Legal action had been taken in the Singapore courts for defamation against the ''[[Financial Times]]'' (2007)<ref name="guardian" /> and the [[New York Times Company]].<ref name="Richard Perez-Pena">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/business/media/25times.html?adxnnl=1&ref=global&adxnnlx=1269630126-/pOpabLI8eqVE1l9rvVbZw |title=Times Co.

Lee's lawyers claimed that Lee had been "gravely injured in his character and reputation" and "brought into public scandal, odium and contempt".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bhavan |first1=Jaipragas |title=Singapore's prime minister personally sues critic for sharing article on Facebook |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/2176404/singapores-prime-minister-personally-sues-critic-sharing |accessdate=18 October 2020 |agency=South China Morning Post |date=5 December 2018 |archive-date=18 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201018201342/https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/2176404/singapores-prime-minister-personally-sues-critic-sharing |url-status=live }}</ref> Leong removed the post thereafter but justified his actions by claiming that it was "a matter of public interest... whether or not it was correct" and filed a countersuit against Lee, claiming that the lawsuit proceedings against him were "an abuse of the process of the court".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Linette |first1=Lai |title=PM Lee Hsien Loong in High Court for start of four-day defamation hearing against blogger Leong Sze Hian |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/pm-lee-hsien-loong-in-high-court-for-start-of-four-day-defamation-hearing-against-blogger |accessdate=18 October 2020 |agency=The Straits Times |date=6 October 2020}}</ref> The Court of Appeal dismissed the countersuit in September 2019, citing that Singapore law does not recognize the concept of the abuse of court process.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Linette |first1=Lai |title=Court of Appeal throws out blogger Leong Sze Hian's counterclaim against PM Lee |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/court-of-appeal-throws-out-blogger-leong-sze-hians-counterclaim-against-pm-lee |accessdate=18 October 2020 |agency=The Straits Times |date=27 September 2019 |archive-date=18 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201018201359/https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/court-of-appeal-throws-out-blogger-leong-sze-hians-counterclaim-against-pm-lee |url-status=live }}</ref>

In October 2020, Lee took the stand in a four-day trial in the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] against Leong, who was defended by lawyer [[Lim Tean]], secretary-general of the opposition party [[Peoples Voice (Singapore)|Peoples Voice]].<ref name="cleanrep">{{cite news |last1=Dewey |first1=Sim |title=Singapore PM suing blogger for defamation says legal action key to protecting government's clean reputation |url=https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3104401/singapore-pm-suing-blogger-defamation-says-lawsuits-key |accessdate=18 October 2020 |agency=South China Morning Post |date=6 October 2020 |archive-date=18 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201018201428/https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3104401/singapore-pm-suing-blogger-defamation-says-lawsuits-key |url-status=live }}</ref> In an opening statement, Lee's lawyer Davinder Singh said that 1MDB had become "a byword for corruption and criminal activity" and that Leong's sharing the post might have implied that "Lee was complicit in criminal activity relating to 1MDB".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Linette |first1=Lai |last2=Rei |first2=Kurohi |title=PM Lee's libel hearing against blogger Leong Sze Hian begins with Leong's lawyer Lim Tean arguing there is no need to sue his client |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/pm-lees-libel-hearing-against-blogger-leong-sze-hian-begins-with-leongs-lawyer-lim-tean |accessdate=18 October 2020 |agency=The Straits Times |date=6 October 2020 |archive-date=18 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201018201307/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/pm-lees-libel-hearing-against-blogger-leong-sze-hian-begins-with-leongs-lawyer-lim-tean |url-status=live }}</ref> Lee claimed that he was compelled to file the suit because not to do so would have raised questions, given his history of filing lawsuits against defamatory statements.<ref name="cleanrep"/> Leong did not take the witness stand, with Lim arguing that it was unnecessary for Leong to give evidence, and that it was Lee's responsibility to prove that Leong's actions were malicious and had damaged Lee's reputation.

==Controversies==
===Condominium rebates===
In 1996, while serving as deputy prime minister, Lee and his father [[Senior Minister]] Lee Kuan Yew addressed Parliament on the allegations of receiving special discounts on four luxury condominium units that they had purchased from Hotel Properties Limited (HPL) on the properties of Nassim Jade and Scotts 28 in 1994 and 1995 respectively. Lee Kuan Yew's brother Lee Suan Yew was the director of HPL, leading to the controversy. Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] ordered an immediate investigation into the matter, since although the provision of special discounts or rebates to relatives and associates of directors is permitted under Singapore law, shareholders must approve such transactions.<ref name="wsj">{{cite news|date=18 January 2012|title=Salaries Cut, Singapore Leaders Are Still Well-Paid|work=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204468004577168620110589932|access-date=10 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831220816/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204468004577168620110589932|archive-date=31 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Though both Lees said they received no preferential treatment in their transactions, the [[Stock Exchange of Singapore]] firmly rebuked HPL for violations in their non-disclosure of the sales of these luxury properties.
