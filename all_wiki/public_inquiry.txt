{{short description|Official review of events or actions ordered by a government body}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2020}}
A '''tribunal of inquiry''' is an official [[review]] of events or actions ordered by a government body. In many [[common law]] countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], such a '''public inquiry''' differs from a [[Royal Commission]] in that a public inquiry accepts evidence and conducts its hearings in a more public forum and focuses on a more specific occurrence. Interested members of the public and organisations may not only make (written) evidential submissions as is the case with most inquiries, but also listen to oral evidence given by other parties.

Typical events for a public inquiry are those that cause multiple deaths, such as public transport crashes or [[mass murders]]. In addition, in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[Planning Inspectorate]], an agency of the Department for [[Communities and Local Government]], routinely holds public inquiries into a range of major and lesser land use developments, including highways and other transport proposals.

[[Advocacy group]]s and [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] political parties are likely to ask for public inquiries for all manner of issues. The government of the day typically only accedes to a fraction of these requests. The political decision whether to appoint a public inquiry into an event was found to be dependent on several factors. The first is the extent of media coverage of the event; those that receive more media interest are more likely to be inquired. Second, since the appointment of a public inquiry is typically made by government ministers, events that involve allegations of blame on the part of the relevant minister are less likely to be investigated by a public inquiry.<ref>[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7834671&fileId=S0007123410000049 Sulitzeanu-Kenan, R. 2010. Reflection in the Shadow of Blame: When do Politicians Appoint Commissions of Inquiry?, ''British Journal of Political Science'' 40(3): 613-634].</ref> Third, a public inquiry generally takes longer to report and costs more on account of its public nature. Thus, when a government refuses a public inquiry on some topic, it is usually on at least one of these grounds.

The conclusions of the inquiry are delivered in the form of a written report, given first to the government, and soon after published to the public. The report will generally make recommendations to improve the quality of government or management of public organisations in the future. Recent studies have shown that the reports of public inquiries are not effective in changing public opinion regarding the event in question.<ref>[http://aas.sagepub.com/content/48/1/3.abstract Sulitzeanu-Kenan, R & Y. Holzman-Gazit. 2016. Form and Content: Institutional Preferences and Public Opinion in a Crisis Inquiry, ''Administration & Society'' 48(1): 3-30].</ref> Moreover, public inquiry reports appear to enjoy public trust only when they are critical of the government, and tend to lose credibility when they find no fault on the part of the government.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9299.2006.00605.x | volume=84 | year=2006 | journal=Public Administration | pages=623–653 | last1 = Sulitzeanu-Kenan | first1 = Raanan| title=If They Get It Right: An Experimental Test of the Effects of the Appointment and Reports of UK Public Inquiries | issue=3 }}</ref>

==France==
In France, any major project which requires the compulsory acquisition of private property must, before being approved, be the subject of a public inquiry (usually by the [[Prefect (France)|prefect]] of the [[Regions of France|region]] or [[Departments of France|department]] in which the project will take place); the favourable outcome of such an inquiry is a ''[[déclaration d'utilité publique]]'', a formal finding that the project will produce public benefit. This procedure was established by the law on expropriation enacted on 7 July 1833,<ref>''Loi du 7 juillet 1833 sur l'expropriation pour cause d'utilité publique''</ref> which extended an earlier law enacted in 1810.<ref>''Loi du 8 mars 1810 sur l'expropriation pour cause d'utilité publique''</ref>

== South Africa ==
A number of historically important public inquiries have taken place in South Africa since the advent of [[1994 South African general election|full democracy]] in 1994.  A number of which have looked into national scale events such as systematic human rights abuses during [[apartheid]] or wide scale [[Corruption in South Africa|corruption]].

==United Kingdom==
In Britain, there are two types of public inquiry, the statutory inquiry set out in terms of the [[Inquiries Act 2005]] (or its predecessor), or the non-statutory inquiry, often used in the investigate controversial events of national concern, the advantage being that they are more flexible, not needing to follow the requirements of the Inquiries Act.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Caird |first1=Jack Simson |title=Public Inquiries: non-statutory commissions of inquiry |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN02599 |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |accessdate=17 July 2018 |date=1 July 2016}}</ref>

A statutory inquiry is usually chaired by a well-known and well-respected member of the [[upper echelons]] of [[British society]], such as a judge, [[lord]], professor or senior civil servant. Inquiries are often informally named after the chair of the inquiry, or the event that is the subject of the inquiry.
