'''WJR''' (760 [[Hertz|kHz]]) is a [[commercial radio|commercial]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[radio station]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. It is owned by [[Cumulus Media]] and broadcasts a [[Talk radio|News/Talk]] [[radio format]].

WJR is a [[List of broadcast station classes#AM|Class A]] [[Clear-channel stations|clear channel]] station whose broadcasts can be heard throughout much of the eastern half of North America at night, operating with 50,000 [[watt]]s, the maximum power for commercial AM stations.  It is Michigan's primary entry point station for the [[Emergency Alert System]].

WJR airs a mix of local and [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] talk shows and local sports. Weekdays feature WJR morning personality [[Paul W. Smith]], afternoon personality [[Mitch Albom]] and late morning host [[Frank Beckmann]]. It is the Detroit outlet for [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]] syndicated talk shows [[Mark Levin]], [[John Batchelor]] and [[Red Eye Radio]]. WJR for many years has aired [[Rush Limbaugh]] from the [[Premiere Networks]] in early afternoons. WJR is also the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] of the [[Michigan State Spartans]] and the [[Detroit Lions Radio Network|Detroit Lions]].<ref name=MSU/><ref name=freepress-wjrmove/>  Late nights and weekends, most hours begin with world and national news from [[Fox News Radio]].

==Studios and Transmitter==
WJR's transmitter building and [[transmitter]] [[radio masts and towers|tower]] are located off Sibley Road in [[Riverview, Michigan]].<ref>[https://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/finder?call=wjr&x=0&y=0&sr=Y&s=C Radio-Locator.com/WJR]</ref>  It is considered "one of the best [[Art Deco]] transmitter buildings ever."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://detroit1701.org/WJR%20Radio.html|title=WJR transmitter building|website=www.detroit1701.org}}</ref>  The [[radio studio|studio]]s are located in the [[Fisher Building]] in Detroit's New Center area. A tower atop the Fisher Building is used for transmitting WJR's audio to the transmitter.  At one time WJR-FM (currently [[WDVD]]) used that tower to broadcast its signal.

==History==
The station began as WCX on May 4, 1922, owned by the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' newspaper, broadcasting from the [[Detroit Free Press Building|''Free Press'' Building]]. It shared this [[radio frequency|frequency]] with [[WWJ (AM)|WWJ]], owned by ''[[The Detroit News]]''.<ref name="history 2006">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303172051/http://www.wjr.com:80/article.asp?id=144992|archivedate=March 3, 2007|title=History of WJR|url=http://www.wjr.com:80/article.asp?id=144992|publisher=WJR|accessdate=November 4, 2018}}</reF> On December 8, 1924, WCX opened studios atop the new [[Book-Cadillac Hotel]] in downtown Detroit, with transmitter facilities on the roof. Hometown poet [[Edgar A. Guest]] and the [[Jean Goldkette]] orchestra participated in the program.

In 1925, the Jewett Radio & Phonograph Company of [[Pontiac, Michigan]] purchased WCX. The station later became known as WCX/WJR.<ref name="history 2006"/> Also by 1925, WWJ was at 850&nbsp;kHz, and both stations were broadcasting with 5000 watts of power. On November 11, 1928, WWJ moved to 750 as a result of the [[Federal Radio Commission|FRC]]'s [[General Order 40]].  It has broadcast on 950 AM since 1941.
 
On December 16, 1928, the station moved from the newspaper's offices to its current location in the Fisher Building. It began identifying as "WJR Detroit, from the Golden Tower of the Fisher Building." Goodwill Stations Inc., formed by George A. Richards (who also owned the [[Detroit Lions]]), acquired WJR in 1929, and it became known as "The Goodwill Station" (along with [[WGAR (AM)|WGAR]] in [[Cleveland]] and [[KMPC]] in [[Los Angeles]]).<ref name="history 2006"/><ref>{{citation|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002027682|title=Memorandum of WJR, KMPC and WGAR in support of proposed findings of fact and conclusions|author=Fulton, Walter & Halley|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|date=1951|accessdate=November 4, 2018}}}</ref> WCX ceased to exist, and WJR acquired all its assets.<ref name=Michiguide>{{cite web|url=http://www.michiguide.com/8626/|title=WJR AM 760 Detroit|publisher=Michiguide|accessdate=November 4, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214072907/http://www.michiguide.com/dials/rad-j/wjr.html|archivedate=February 14, 2012|url-status=live}}</reF> In 1931, the station raised its power to 10,000 watts.  Four years later, it was authorized to broadcast with 50,000 watts.<ref name=Michiguide /> On March 29, 1941, WJR moved from 750 to 760&nbsp;kHz in accordance with the NARBA frequency reallocations. Before [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]] of 1941, 750&nbsp;kHz was a [[Clear-channel stations|clear channel]] under 1928 rules.

WJR became a [[CBS]] affiliate on September 29, 1935, after having been affiliated with [[Blue Network|NBC-Blue]].<ref>{{cite news| title=WJR Will Affiliate With CBS in Fall| url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1935/1935-05-01-BC.pdf| accessdate=24 October 2014| work=[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]]| date=May 1, 1935| volume=8| number=9| page=12}}</ref> On the same date, WJR's officials formally dedicated the station's new 50,000 W transmitter.<ref>{{cite news| title=Stations in Detroit Realigned Sept. 29| url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1935/1935-10-01-BC.pdf| accessdate=4 November 2014| work=Broadcasting| date=October 1, 1935| volume=8| number=7| page=22}}</ref>
 
Richards died in May 1951, and in 1964, Goodwill Stations was sold to [[Capital Cities Communications]], which later merged with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and later with the [[Walt Disney Company]]. Upon the sale, WJR's air slogan became "The Great Voice of the Great Lakes". Also in 1964, WJR acquired full rights to [[Detroit Tigers]] [[baseball]] games, with [[announcers]] [[Ernie Harwell]] and [[George Kell]], who had begun broadcasting Tiger games in 1960. Previously, WJR had carried only night games with day games on [[WDTW (AM)|WKMH]] and [[WLQV|WJBK]]. The station became the flagship of the "Tiger Baseball Network." In the late 1960s, WJR also became the flagship station for [[Detroit Red Wings]] [[hockey]] and [[Detroit Pistons]] [[basketball]].

The station is also remembered among many Metro Detroiters for its advertising campaigns and jingles including [http://jingles.com/audio/d_SpiritOf76.mp3 "W-J-R ... Radio 76 ... Cares About Detroit."] Another: "This is America's finest - AM stereo 76." Regularly on his show, [[J.P. McCarthy]] would state in a nonchalant way "This is the world's greatest radio station, WJR Detroit," with a manner that made it seem like the most obvious of facts. WJR broadcast in "AM Stereo" from 1982 to 2006, and was received in (C-Quam) stereo AM at great distances at night. WJR's Detroit Tigers home games were broadcast in stereo, as were the Thanksgiving Day Parades.

Most of WJR's broadcast studios, along with its newsroom and offices, are in the [[Fisher Building]]. The station also has a satellite studio in the Wintergarden of the [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] [[Renaissance Center]] in downtown Detroit. Past WJR personalities included J.P. McCarthy, Jimmy Launce, Warren Pierce, Mike Whorf, Murray Gula, Joel Alexander, Jay Roberts, [[Charles Coughlin]] and many others. WJR Program Directors during the Capital Cities era included Joe Bacarella, Curt Hahn and AC radio consultant Gary Berkowitz.

WJR signed on an FM outlet in 1948 at 96.3&nbsp;MHz. The station was known as WJR-FM until 1982 when it became WHYT. It is now [[WDVD]].

Music programming on WJR has been phased out almost entirely over the past two decades. As of June 2014, the only music-oriented show on the station is the ''[[Renfro Valley Gatherin']]'', aired early Sunday mornings. In 2006, WJR picked up the nationally syndicated ''Handyman Show'' with Glenn Haege, which originates from Detroit, and previously aired on [[WXYT (AM)|WXYT]] and [[WDFN]]. ''The Handyman Show'' is a nationally syndicated show, originating from WJR's own studios, as is also the case with several other weekend shows such as ''The C.A.R. Show'' and ''The Real Estate Insiders''.

WJR was sold with other ABC Radio stations to [[Citadel Broadcasting]] in January 2006. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.<ref name=abj-citadelcumulus>{{cite news| title=Cumulus now owns Citadel Broadcasting| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2011/09/16/cumulus-now-owns-citadel-broadcasting.html| accessdate=September 16, 2011| newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Atlanta Business Journal]]| date=September 16, 2011}}</ref>

WJR broadcast an [[HD Radio|AM-HD]] Radio signal for about a two-year period (2006–2008) (also on 93.1 [[WDRQ]]'s [[HD Radio|FM-HD]] subchannel), eventually eliminating night time AM-HD radio use, then dropping AM-HD and FM-HD radio broadcasts completely, returning to its 50,000 watt analog signal only. WJR is streamed via the web, and has since returned to HD Radio on WDVD-HD2.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=10| title=HD Radio: Detroit, MI| publisher=HD Radio| accessdate=2015-12-16| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123032523/http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=10| archivedate=2015-11-23}}</ref> WJR is licensed to broadcast a digital hybrid (HD) signal.<ref>{{cite web| title=Station Search Details| url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_det.pl?Facility_id=8626| publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]| accessdate=December 16, 2015}}</ref>

==Sports programming==
For much of its history, WJR served as a powerhouse in Michigan sports radio. However, in 2001 the station lost its longtime [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] rights to the [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[Detroit Red Wings]], both of whom moved to [[CBS]]-owned [[WXYT (AM)|WXYT]] and [[WXYT-FM]]. Then, in 2005, the station dropped its status as the flagship station for [[Michigan Wolverines]] football and basketball in favor of a flagship rights deal with the [[Michigan State Spartans]].  WJR had served as flagship for Michigan State prior to 1976.<ref name=MSU>{{cite press release| title=MSU Announces Football Broadcast Team| url=http://www.msuspartans.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/050806aaa.html| date=May 8, 2006| publisher=Michigan State University| accessdate=December 16, 2015}}</ref> On November 20, 2015, WJR announced it would take over as flagship station of the [[Detroit Lions]] in 2016, with the team moving over from WXYT-FM.<ref name=freepress-wjrmove>{{cite news| title=Want to listen to the Lions in 2016?

(During parts of the season when Michigan football and Tiger baseball were both on, Tiger baseball would take precedence, and if a Michigan football game was either just beginning or really good when Tiger baseball came on, an announcement would come on as the football game fades out stating the need to switch due to contractual obligations. Otherwise, the announcement would just simply state they're leaving the Michigan game for the Tigers. Either way, the listener was directed to [[CKLW]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]] for the conclusion of the game.)
