Her following videos for tracks such as "Summer Wine", "Carmen", and "Summertime Sadness" were all produced off of significantly lower budgets and retained more elements of Del Rey's earlier style. The ''Ultraviolence'' era incorporated an admixture of high budget videos and self-made ones, while the ''Honeymoon'' era was almost strictly film noir-influenced professionally-shot visuals. Both eras saw some of Del Rey's homemade videos for tracks such as "Pretty When You Cry" and "Honeymoon" go unreleased due to Del Rey's opinions they were "too boring".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1847218/lana-del-rey-pretty-when-you-cry-teaser-video/|title=Lana Del Rey Looks Pretty, Doesn't Cry In 'Pretty When You Cry' Teaser|first=John|last=Walker|website=MTV News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/31913/1/watch-lana-del-rey-s-rejected-honeymoon-video|title=Watch Lana Del Rey’s rejected ‘Honeymoon’ video|date=July 5, 2016|website=Dazed}}</ref> The ''Lust For Life'' era was widely characterized for its futuristic flare in its mildly filtered vintage-inspired look.

While it's impossible to keep the businesses' hands out the pop when creating a pop star, the roots of where this all comes from are firmly inside of Lizzy Grant."<ref name="hellyer" /> In Del Rey's own words, she "[n]ever had a persona.

In a 2017 interview, Del Rey stated, "I didn't edit myself [on ''Born to Die''] when I could have, because a lot of it's just the way it was. I mean, because I've changed a lot and a lot of those songs, it's not that I don't relate but... A lot of it too is I was just kinda nervous. I came off sort of nervously, and there was just a lot of dualities, a lot of juxtapositions going on that maybe just felt like something was a little off. Maybe the thing that was off was that I needed a little more time or something, and also my path was just so windy just to get to having a first record. I feel like I had to figure it out all by myself. Every move was just guesswork."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/lana-del-rey-interview-2017-cover-story|work=Complex|title=Lana Del Rey Talks "Lust for Life," Avoiding Cultural Appropriation, and Getting Political|author=Callahan-Bever, Noah|date=July 26, 2017|access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref>

<blockquote>For me, a true feminist is someone who is a woman who does exactly what she wants. If my choice is to, I don't know, be with a lot of men, or if I enjoy a really physical relationship, I don't think that's necessarily being anti-feminist. For me the argument of feminism never really should have come into the picture. Because I don't know too much about the history of feminism, and so I'm not really a relevant person to bring into the conversation.
