The '''College of William & Mary''' (also known as '''William & Mary''', '''W&M''', and officially '''The College of William and Mary in Virginia''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]. Founded in 1693 by [[letters patent]] issued by [[King William III]] and [[Queen Mary II]], it is the [[Colonial colleges|second-oldest]] institution of [[higher education]] in the [[United States]], after [[Harvard University]].

William & Mary educated American presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]] (third), [[James Monroe]] (fifth), and [[John Tyler]] (tenth) as well as other key figures pivotal to the development of the United States, including the first [[President of the Continental Congress]] [[Peyton Randolph]] of Virginia, the first [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Edmund Randolph]] of Virginia, the fourth U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] of Virginia, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] [[Henry Clay]] of Kentucky, sixteen members of the [[Continental Congress]], and four signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], earning it the nickname "the Alma Mater of the Nation."<ref>{{cite web |title = William & Mary – History of the College |url = https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/studenthandbook/history_of_the_college/index.php |website = www.wm.edu |access-date = October 31, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151209211035/http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/studenthandbook/history_of_the_college/index.php |archive-date = December 9, 2015 |url-status = dead |df = mdy-all }}</ref> A young [[George Washington]] also received his surveyor's license at the college, and he would become the college's first American [[Chancellor of the College of William & Mary|chancellor]] in 1788.

William & Mary is notable for its many firsts in American higher education. The [[Flat Hat Club|F.H.C. Society]], founded in 1750, was the first collegiate fraternity in the United States, and W&M students founded the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] academic [[honor society]] in 1776, the first Greek-letter fraternity. W&M was also the first school of higher education in the United States to install an [[honor code]] of conduct for students, dating back to 1736. The establishment of graduate programs in law and medicine in 1779 makes it one of the [[first university in the United States|first universities in the United States]].

In addition to its undergraduate program, W&M is home to several graduate programs and four professional schools.  The [[William & Mary Law School|Marshall–Wythe School of Law]] is the oldest law school in the United States. In his 1985 book ''Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities'', Richard Moll included William & Mary as one of the original eight "[[Public Ivies]]". It is [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|classified]] among "R2: Doctoral Universities – High Research Activity".<ref>{{cite web |title=Carnegie Classifications Institution Lookup |url=https://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup/view_institution.php?unit_id=231624 |publisher=Center for Postsecondary Education |website=carnegieclassifications.iu.edu |access-date=12 September 2020}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of the College of William & Mary}}

===Colonial era: 1693–1776===
[[File:James Blair.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[James Blair (Virginia)|James Blair]], founder of William & Mary]]
A school of higher education for both [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] young men and the sons of the colonists was one of the earliest goals of the leaders of the [[Colony of Virginia]]. The college was founded on February 8, 1693, under a royal charter (legally, letters patent) to "''make, found and establish a certain Place of Universal Study, a perpetual College of Divinity, Philosophy, Languages, and other good arts and sciences...to be supported and maintained, in all time coming.''"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://swem.wm.edu/departments/special-collections/exhibits/exhibits/charter/charter/ |title=Earl Gregg Swem Library Special Collections |publisher=Swem.wm.edu |access-date=September 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919125611/http://www.swem.wm.edu/departments/special-collections/exhibits/exhibits/charter/charter/ |archive-date=September 19, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Named in honor of the reigning monarchs [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]], the college is the second oldest college in the United States. The original plans for the college date back to 1618 at [[Henricus|Henrico]] but were thwarted by the [[Indian Massacre of 1622]], a change in government (in 1624, the Virginia Company's charter was revoked by King James I and the Virginia Colony was transferred to royal authority as a [[crown colony]]), events related to the [[English Civil War]], and [[Bacon's Rebellion]]. In 1695, before the town of Williamsburg existed, construction began on the College Building, now known as the Sir Christopher [[Wren Building]], in what was then called [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)]]. It is the oldest college building in America. The college is one of the country's nine [[Colonial Colleges]] founded before the [[American Revolution]]. The Charter named [[James Blair (Virginia)|James Blair]] as the college's first president (a lifetime appointment which he held until his death in 1743). William & Mary was founded as an [[Anglican]] institution; students were required to be members of the [[Church of England]], and professors were required to declare adherence to the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]].<ref>Webster, Homer J. (1902) "Schools and Colleges in Colonial Times", ''The New England Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly'', v. XXVII, p. 374, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC01644447&pg=PA373 Google Books entry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506182259/https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC01644447&pg=PA373 |date=May 6, 2016 }}</ref>

In 1693, the college was [[university constituency|given a seat]] in the [[House of Burgesses]] and it was determined the college would be supported by [[tobacco]] taxes and export duties on [[fur]]s and animal skins. The college acquired a {{convert|330|acre|km2}} parcel for the new school,<ref>{{cite web|last=GmbH |first=Sedo |url=http://williamsburgpostcards.com/other/other14a.htm |title=williamsburgpostcards.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120043818/http://williamsburgpostcards.com/other/other14a.htm |archive-date=January 20, 2012 }}</ref> {{convert|8|mi|km}} from Jamestown. In 1694, the new school opened in temporary buildings.

[[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] was granted a royal charter as a city in 1722 by [[The Crown]] and served as the capital of Colonial Virginia from 1699 to 1780. During this time, the college served as a law center and lawmakers frequently used its buildings. It educated future U.S. Presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Monroe]], and [[John Tyler]]. The college has been called "the Alma Mater of a Nation" because of its close ties to America's founding fathers. A 17-year-old [[George Washington]] received his surveyor's license through the college and would return as its first American chancellor. William & Mary is famous for its firsts: the first U.S. institution with a royal charter, the first Greek-letter society ([[Phi Beta Kappa]], founded in 1776), the first collegiate society in the country ([[Flat Hat Club|F.H.C. Society]], founded in 1750), the first student honor code and the first [[William & Mary Law School|law school]] in America.

===Revolution and transition===

[[File:Jamesmonroe-npgallery.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[James Monroe]], 5th President of US, W&M alumnus]]
During the period of the American Revolution, [[freedom of religion]] was established in Virginia notably with the 1786 passage of the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]]. Future U.S. President [[James Madison]] was a key figure in the transition to religious freedom in Virginia, and [[James Madison (bishop)|Right Reverend James Madison]], his cousin and [[Thomas Jefferson]], who was on the [[Board of Visitors]], helped the College of William & Mary to make the transition as well. In 1779 the college became the first American university with the establishment of the graduate schools in law and medicine.{{clarify|date=March 2016}} As its president, Reverend Madison worked with the new leaders of Virginia, most notably Jefferson, on a reorganization and changes for the college which included the abolition of the Divinity School and the Indian School and the establishment of the first elective system of study and honor system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virginiavignettes.org/?p=21 |title=Virginia Vignettes » What Was the Brafferton School? |publisher=Virginiavignettes.org |date=August 2007 |access-date=September 26, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111135556/http://www.virginiavignettes.org/?p=21 |archive-date=November 11, 2007 }}</ref>

The College of William and Mary is home to the nation's first [[collegiate secret societies in North America|collegiate secret society]], the [[Flat Hat Club|F.H.C. Society]], popularly known as the [[Flat Hat Club]], founded November 11, 1750. On December 5, 1776, students [[John Heath (politician)|John Heath]] and [[William Short (American ambassador)|William Short]] (Class of 1779) founded [[Phi Beta Kappa]] as a secret literary and philosophical society. Other [[Secret societies at the College of William & Mary|secret societies]] known to currently exist at the college include: The [[Seven Society (College of William & Mary)|7 Society]], 13 Club, Alpha Club, [[Bishop James Madison Society]], The Society, The Spades, W Society, and [[Wren Society]].<ref>[http://www.dogstreetjournal.com/story/2049 Shhh!

In 1842, alumni of the college formed the Society of the Alumni<ref>{{cite web |first=F.

In 1859, a great fire destroyed the College Building. The [[Alumni House (College of William & Mary)|Alumni House]] is one of the few original antebellum structures remaining on campus; notable others include the Wren Building, the President's House, the Brafferton, and Prince George House.

===Civil War, Reconstruction, and the early 20th century===
[[File:Wren 1859 william and mary.jpg|thumb|left|College Building, 1859–1862]]
At the outset of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), enlistments in the [[Confederate States Army]] depleted the student body; and on May 10, 1861, the faculty voted to close the college for the duration of the conflict. [[Charles A. Whittier|General Charles A. Whittier]] reported that "thirty-two out of thirty-five professors and instructors abandoned the college work and joined the army in the field".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gordon|first=John Brown|url=https://archive.org/details/reminiscencesci02gordgoog/page/n451/mode/1up|title=Reminiscences of the Civil War|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=1903|isbn=|location=New York|pages=422}}</ref> The [[Wren Building|College Building]] was used as a Confederate barracks and later as a hospital, first by Confederate, and later Union forces. The [[Battle of Williamsburg]] was fought nearby during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] on May 5, 1862, and the city was captured by the Union army the next day. The [[Brafferton (building)|Brafferton building of the college]] was used for a time as quarters for the commanding officer of the Union garrison occupying the town. On September 9, 1862, drunken soldiers of the [[5th Pennsylvania Cavalry]] set fire to the College Building,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/vitalfacts/nineteenth2.php |title=1850–1899 {{pipe}} Historical Facts |work=Historical Chronology of William and Mary |publisher=Wm.edu |access-date=September 26, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704205939/http://www.wm.edu/vitalfacts/nineteenth2.php |archive-date=July 4, 2008 }}</ref> purportedly in an attempt to prevent Confederate snipers from using it for cover. Much damage was done to the community during the Union occupation, which lasted until September 1865.

Following the restoration of the Union, Virginia was destitute from the War. The college's 16th president, [[Benjamin Stoddert Ewell]], finally reopened the school in 1869 using his funds but the college closed in 1882 due to lack of funds. In 1888, William & Mary resumed operations under an amended charter when the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] passed an act<ref>{{cite web |url=http://swem.wm.edu/departments/special-collections/exhibits/exhibits/charter/normal/ |title=Earl Gregg Swem Library Special Collections |publisher=Swem.wm.edu |access-date=September 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011191341/http://swem.wm.edu/departments/special-collections/exhibits/exhibits/charter/normal |archive-date=October 11, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> appropriating $10,000 to support the college as a teacher-training institution. [[Lyon Gardiner Tyler]] (son of US President and alumnus [[John Tyler]]) became the 17th president of the college following President Ewell's retirement. Tyler, along with the 18th president [[J. A. C. Chandler]], expanded the college into a modern institution. In March 1906, the General Assembly passed an act taking over the grounds of the colonial institution, and it has remained publicly supported ever since. In 1918, William & Mary became one of the first universities in Virginia to admit women and become [[coeducational]].<ref>[http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/women/grad_prof1.html Women at UVa: Graduate and Professional Schools] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216222951/http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/women/grad_prof1.html |date=February 16, 2015 }}. .lib.virginia.edu.

Largely thanks to the vision of a William and Mary instructor, [[W. A. R. Goodwin|Reverend Dr. W. A. R. Goodwin]], the College Building, the President's House and [[the Brafferton]] (originally the Indian School) were restored to their 18th-century appearance between 1928 and 1932 with substantial financial support from [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] and his wife, [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]]. Together, they led the establishment and beginnings of [[Colonial Williamsburg]].

===1930–present===

In 1930, William & Mary expanded its territorial range by establishing a branch in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] – The Norfolk Division of the College of William & Mary. This extension would eventually become the independent state-supported institution known as [[Old Dominion University]].

Significant campus construction continued under the college's nineteenth president, [[John Stewart Bryan]]. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] received an honorary degree from the college on October 20, 1934.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1934/10/21/archives/roosevelts-address-at-william-and-mary.html Roosevelt's Address at William and Mary – Article – NYTimes.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608171651/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10917FF3B5D167A93C3AB178BD95F408385F9 |date=June 8, 2013 }}.

The sunken design is taken from a similar landscape feature at [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] in London, designed by Sir Christopher Wren.

The college has a history of supporting freedom of the press dating back at least to the 1940s. In 1945, for example, the college administration sanctioned the student Marilyn Kaemmerle for an article she had written in ''[[The Flat Hat]]'' supporting the end of [[racist]] policies of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], [[anti-miscegenation laws]] and [[white supremacy]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,792051,00.html Education: Jefferson's Heirs]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826034248/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C792051%2C00.html |date=August 26, 2013 }}, ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', February 26, 1945</ref> According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, in response, over one-thousand William & Mary students held "a spirited mass meeting protesting infringement of the sacred principles of freedom of the press bequeathed by Alumnus Thomas Jefferson."

The college admitted Hulon Willis into a graduate program in 1951 because the program was unavailable at [[Virginia State University|Virginia State]]. However, the college did not open all programs to African-American students until around 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Desegregation_in_Higher_Education#start_entry|title=Desegregation in Higher Education in Virginia|first=Peter|last=Wallenstein|access-date=June 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710021610/http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Desegregation_in_Higher_Education#start_entry|archive-date=July 10, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1960, [[The Colleges of William & Mary]], a short-lived five campus university system, was founded. It included the College of William & Mary, the [[Richmond Professional Institute]], the [[Norfolk Division of the College of William & Mary]], [[Christopher Newport College]], and [[Richard Bland College]].<ref name="CoWMAH">{{cite book|last=Godson|title=The College of William and Mary: A History|year=1993|publisher=King and Queen Press|isbn=0-9615670-4-X|display-authors=etal}}</ref> It was dissolved in 1962.

In 1974, Jay Winston Johns willed [[Highland (James Monroe house)|Highland]], the {{convert|535|acre|km2|adj=on}} historic [[Albemarle County, Virginia]] estate of alumnus and U.S. President [[James Monroe]], to the college.

Jefferson Hall, a student dormitory, was destroyed by fire in January 1983 with no casualties. The building was later rebuilt and reopened.

Throughout the second half of the 20th century, William & Mary has retained its historic ties to the United Kingdom and their royal family. In 1954, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] visited William & Mary as part of her tour of the United States, becoming the first member of the royal family to visit the college. In 1957, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] visited the college to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the landing at Jamestown. Elizabeth gave a speech from the balcony of the Wren Building that drew over 20,000 people, the largest crowd ever seen in the city. In 1981, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] visited to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Yorktown. In 1988, the United States Congress selected William & Mary to send a delegation to the United Kingdom for the 300th anniversary of the ascension of King William III and Queen Mary II. Prince Charles would return to the college in 1993 for the 300th anniversary of William & Mary, and that same year William & Mary sent a delegation to meet with Queen Elizabeth II. Former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] would be made the [[Chancellor of the College of William & Mary]] that same year. In 2007, Elizabeth II and Prince Philip would visit the college for a second time to recognize the 400th anniversary of the landing at Jamestown.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2015/rolling-out-wms-red-carpet-for-royalty123.php | title=Great Britain's royalty is at home at William & Mary

==Campus==
The college is on a {{convert|1200|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]. In 2011, [[Travel+Leisure]] named William & Mary one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/24|title="America's most beautiful college campuses", ''Travel+Leisure'' (September 2011)|work=Travel + Leisure|access-date=November 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202171454/http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/24|archive-date=December 2, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Wren Building|Sir Christopher Wren Building]] is the oldest college building in the United States and a National Historic Landmark.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=707&ResourceType=Building |title=Wren Building, College of William and Mary |publisher=National Park Service |access-date=December 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213002246/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=707&ResourceType=Building |archive-date=February 13, 2009 }}</ref> The building, colloquially referred to as the "Wren Building", was named upon its renovation in 1931 to honor the English architect [[Sir Christopher Wren]]. The basis for the 1930s name is a 1724 history in which mathematics professor [[Hugh Jones (professor)|Hugh Jones]] stated the 1699 design was "first modelled by Sir Christopher Wren" and then was adapted "by the Gentlemen there" in Virginia; little is known about how it looked since it burned within a few years of its completion. Today's Wren Building is based on the design of its 1716 replacement. The college's alumni association has suggested Wren's connection to the 1931 building is a viable subject of investigation.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Did Wren Design the Building and William and Mary Bearing His Name? |first=Chiles T.A. |last=Larson |journal=William & Mary |page=59 |date=Fall 2005 |volume=71 |issue=1 |publisher=W&M Alumni Association |url=http://wmalumnimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vol_71_no_1_WMAlumMag_fall20052.pdf |access-date=April 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413224316/http://wmalumnimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vol_71_no_1_WMAlumMag_fall20052.pdf |archive-date=April 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Two other buildings around the Wren Building complete a triangle known unofficially as "Ancient Campus": the [[Brafferton (building)|Brafferton]] (built within 1723 and originally housing the Indian School, now the President and Provost's offices) and the President's House (built within 1732). In addition to the "Ancient Campus", which dates to the 18th century, the college also consists of "Old Campus" and "New Campus."

"Old Campus" consists of academic buildings and dormitories built near the Wren Building and matches the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and Anglo-Dutch architecture of the colonial buildings of "Ancient Campus" and [[Colonial Williamsburg]]. Located directly to the west of the Wren Building, the majority of "Old Campus" was constructed during the 1920s and 1930s and is dominated by the [[Sunken Garden (Virginia)|Sunken Gardens]] and the college's football stadium, [[Zable Stadium]]. Also within "Old Campus" are Sorority Court, the majority of upperclassmen dormitories, and the offices and classrooms of the History, Economics, Government, Philosophy, Religion, Music, Modern Language, and English Departments.

Adjoining "Old Campus" to the north and west is "New Campus." It was constructed primarily between 1950 and 1980, and it consists of academic buildings and dormitories that, while of the same brick construction as "Old Campus", fit into the vernacular of modern architecture. Beginning with the college's [[tercentenary]] in 1993, the college has embarked on a building and renovation program that favors the traditional architectural style of "Old Campus", while incorporating energy-efficient technologies. Several buildings constructed since the 1990s have been [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED certified]]. Additionally, as the buildings of "New Campus" are renovated after decades of use, several have been remodeled to incorporate more traditional architectural elements to unify the appearance of the entire college campus. "New Campus" is dominated by [[William and Mary Hall]], [[Earl Gregg Swem Library]], and [[Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall]]. It also includes the offices and classrooms of the Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, Biology, and Chemistry Departments, the majority of freshman dormitories, the fraternity complex, the majority of the college's athletic fields and the [[Muscarelle Museum of Art]]. The newest addition to "New Campus" is [[Alan B. Miller Hall]], the headquarters of the college's [[Mason School of Business]].

[[File:William and mary lake matoaka ampitheater september 2011.jpeg|thumb|The renovated Matoaka Amphitheater scenically located on the shore of Lake Matoaka.]]

The recent wave of construction at William and Mary has resulted in a new building for the School of Education, not far from William and Mary Hall. Additionally, new facilities have freed up space in existing structures. The offices and classrooms of the Government, Economics, and Classical Language Departments, which share a building on "New Campus" (Morton Hall), could potentially be separated and some relocated to vacant buildings recently renovated within the "Old Campus".

The vast majority of William and Mary's {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} consists of woodlands and [[Lake Matoaka]], an artificial lake created by colonists in the early 18th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/as/kecklab/lakematoaka/facts/index.php |title=Facts about Lake Matoaka |publisher=The College of William and Mary |access-date=May 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513054133/https://www.wm.edu/as/kecklab/lakematoaka/facts/index.php |archive-date=May 13, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The college has shown a dedication to the stewardship and preservation of these natural elements, which are accessible via the trails running throughout the campus.

The college also has property and buildings not contiguous to campus, including the [[The College of William & Mary Law School|William and Mary School of Law]] and the [[McCormack-Nagelsen Tennis Center]], both on a piece of property approximately four blocks southeast of the Wren Building. Additionally, approximately a mile northwest of "New Campus" is the Dillard Complex (located across from the modern campus of Virginia's [[Eastern State Hospital (Virginia)|Eastern State Hospital]]), which is home to several offices, two former dormitories, and [[Plumeri Park]], the college's baseball stadium.

The [[Chancellor of the College of William and Mary]] is largely a ceremonial role. Until 1776, the position was held by an English subject, usually the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] or the [[Bishop of London]], who served as the college's advocate to the Crown, while a colonial President oversaw the day-to-day activities of the Williamsburg campus. Following the Revolutionary War, General [[George Washington]] was appointed as the first American chancellor; later United States President [[John Tyler]] held the post. The college has recently had several distinguished chancellors: former [[Chief Justice of the United States]] [[Warren E. Burger]] (1986–1993), former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] (1993–2000), former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] (2000–2005), and former U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] (2005–2012).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/chancellor/duties/index.php |title=Duties and History, Chancellor |publisher=The College of William and Mary |access-date=December 21, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218084552/http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/chancellor/duties/index.php |archive-date=February 18, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Former U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert M.

===Publications===
The [[Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture]] publishes the ''[[William and Mary Quarterly]]'', a scholarly journal focusing on colonial history, particularly in North America and the Atlantic World from the Age of Discovery onward.

In addition to the Quarterly, W&M, by its mission to provide undergraduates with a thorough grounding in research also hosts several student journals. The ''Monitor'' is the undergraduate journal of International Studies which publishes on a bi-annual basis. The [[Lyon Gardiner Tyler]] Department of History also supports an undergraduate history journal, The ''[[James Blair (Virginia)|James Blair]] Historical Review'', which publishes on an annual basis.

Non-academic publications include ''The William & Mary Review'' – the college's official literary magazine – ''Winged Nation'' – a student literary arts magazine, ''Acropolis'' – the Art and Art History magazine, ''[[The Flat Hat]]'' – the student newspaper, ''The Botetourt Squat'' – the student satirical newspaper, ''The Colonial Echo'' – the college's yearbook, ''Tribe Attaché'' - the student news blog covering international events, ''[[The DoG Street Journal]]'' – a daily online newspaper, and ''ROCKET Magazine'' – the college's fashion, art, and photography publication.

Several members of the socially elite and politically influential Tucker family, including [[Nathaniel Beverley Tucker|Nathaniel Beverley]], [[St. George Tucker|St. George]], and [[Henry St. George Tucker Sr.]] (who penned the original [[honor code]] pledge for the [[University of Virginia]] that remains in use there today), taught at William & Mary.

More recently, William & Mary recruited the constitutional scholar [[William Van Alstyne]] from [[Duke Law School]]. Professor [[Benjamin Bolger]] – the second-most credentialed person in modern history behind Michael Nicholson – teaches at W&M.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2009/01/twentyseven_degrees_and_counti.html|title=Twenty-seven degrees and counting: Kalamazoo man enjoys the 'freedom' of intellectual pursuits|work=MLive.com|access-date=December 2, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820044525/https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2009/01/twentyseven_degrees_and_counti.html|archive-date=August 20, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Lawrence Wilkerson]], current Harriman Visiting Professor of Government and Public Policy, was chief of staff for [[Colin Powell]].

===Honor system===
[[File:Thomas-Jefferson.jpg|upright|thumb|Thomas Jefferson]]
William & Mary's [[Honor code|honor system]] was first established by alumnus [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1779 and is widely believed to be the nation's first.<ref>{{cite news |last=Olsen |first=Patricia R. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/education/edlife/notebook.html |title=And Out of the Corner of My Eye... – New York Times |work=The New York Times |date=January 6, 2008 |access-date=September 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425022144/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/education/edlife/notebook.html |archive-date=April 25, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> During the orientation week, every entering student recites the Honor Pledge in the Great Hall of the [[Wren Building]] pledging:
{{quote|As a Member of the William & Mary community I pledge, on my Honor, not to lie, cheat, or steal in either my academic or personal life. I understand that such acts violate the Honor Code and undermine the community of trust of which we are all stewards.}}

===Student Code of Conduct===

W&M considers the observance of public laws of equal importance to the observance of its particular regulations. William and Mary's Board of Visitors delegates authority for discipline to its president. The President oversees a hierarchy of disciplinary authorities to enforce local laws as it pertains to William and Mary's interest as well as its internal regulatory system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/studenthandbook/student_code_of_conduct/index.php |title=Student Code of Conduct |publisher=Wm.edu |access-date=April 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410074600/http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/studenthandbook/student_code_of_conduct/index.php |archive-date=April 10, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Traditions===
[[File:Crimdell.jpg|thumb|left|Crim Dell bridge in the heart of W&M's wooded campus]]
William & Mary has several traditions, including the Yule Log Ceremony, at which the president dresses as [[Santa Claus]] and reads a rendition of "[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]", the Vice-President of Student Affairs reads "Twas the Night Before Finals", and [[The Gentlemen of the College]] sing the song "[[The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)|The Twelve Days of Christmas]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_59339.asp |title=Holiday Traditions Fill The Season In Williamsburg |work=Chattanoogan.com |access-date=September 26, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214114143/http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_59339.asp |archive-date=February 14, 2009 }}</ref> Christmas is a grand celebration at the college; decorated Christmas trees abound on campus. This popular tradition started when German immigrant [[Charles Minnigerode]], a humanities professor at the college in 1842 who taught Latin and Greek, brought one of the first Christmas trees to America. Entering into the social life of post-colonial Virginia, Minnigerode introduced the German custom of decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas at the home of law professor [[St. George Tucker]], thereby becoming another of many influences that prompted Americans to adopt the practice at about that time.<ref>[http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Minnigerode_Charles_1814-1894 Minnigerode, Charles (1814–1894)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801022323/http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Minnigerode_Charles_1814-1894 |date=August 1, 2016 }}. Encyclopedia Virginia. Retrieved on August 9, 2013.</ref>

Incoming freshmen participate in Opening Convocation, at which they pass through the entrance of the Wren Building and are officially welcomed as the newest members of the college. Freshmen also have the opportunity, during orientation week, to serenade the president of the college at his home with the [[Our Alma Mater|Alma Mater song]]. The Senior Walk is similar, in that graduating seniors walk through the Wren Building in their "departure" from the college. On the last day of classes, Seniors are invited to ring the bell in the cupola of the Wren Building.

W&M also takes pride in its connections to its colonial past during Charter Day festivities. Charter Day is technically February 8, based on the date (from the [[Julian Calendar]]) that the Reverend James Blair, first president of the college received the charter from the Court of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] at Kensington Palace in 1693. Past Charter Day speakers have included former US President [[John Tyler]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], and [[Robert Gates]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Another underground tradition at W&M is known as the "Triathalon". As reported by ''[[The Flat Hat]]'', the tradition - normally performed prior to graduation - involves completing three activities;<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=The College's very own triathlon tradition {{!}} Flat Hat News|url=http://flathatnews.com/2008/08/22/colleges-very-own-triathlon-tradition/|last=Hat|first=The Flat|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref> jumping the walls of the Governor's Palace in Colonial Williamsburg, streaking through the Sunken Garden, and finally swimming in the [[Crim Dell bridge|Crim Dell]]. The tradition has been referred to as an underground one and is not sanctioned by the college, but is still widely practiced.<ref name=":0" />

A unique tradition at William and Mary is the annual Raft Debate. Described by the college as "...a 'delicate balance of comedy and lecture,' the annual Raft Debate features four W&M faculty members from diverse disciplines, stranded on a desolate island with only a one-person life raft for escape to civilization. Based on the volume of applause, the audience chooses the sole survivor as the professors cajole, plead, pontificate, and resort shamelessly to props and costumes. The quirky event originated in the mid-1900s and was revived during the 2000s by the Graduate Center, the A&S Office of Graduate Studies and Research, and the A&S Graduate Student Association. Faculty participants represent the Humanities, the Social Sciences, or the Natural and Computational Sciences. The Devil's Advocate, who argues sarcastically that none of the academic disciplines are worth saving, has on rare occasion emerged victoriously."{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Commencement exercises each year begin with the senior class walking through the Wren Building and across the campus, crossing the Crim Dell bridge, and arriving at William & Mary Hall (Kaplan Arena) for the commencement ceremony. The graduating class processes into the arena as the Choir of the College of William & Mary sings the [[William & Mary Hymn]]. Since 2018, the venue for graduation ceremony has been changed to Zable Stadium due to the renovation of Kaplan Arena.

===Fraternities and sororities===
{{Main|College of William & Mary fraternity and sorority system}}
William & Mary has a long history of [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities and sororities]] dating back to 1750 and the founding of the [[Flat Hat Club|F.H.C. Society]], the first collegiate fraternity established in what now is the [[United States of America|United States]].  [[Phi Beta Kappa]], the first "Greek-letter" fraternity, was founded at the College in 1776.

Today, various Greek-letter organizations play an important role in the college community, along with such other social organizations as theatre and club sport groups.  Overall, about one-third of undergraduate students are active members of one or another of 16 national fraternities and 13 sororities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/offices/greeks/who-we-are/chapters/index.php |title=Chapters |publisher=Wm.edu |date=February 4, 2013 |access-date=June 28, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216201644/http://www.wm.edu/offices/greeks/who-we-are/chapters/index.php |archive-date=December 16, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>  William & Mary is also home to several unusual fraternal or similar organizations, including the [[Nu Kappa Epsilon]] music sorority<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/so/nukappaepsilon/aboutnke.html|title=What Exactly is Nu Kappa Epsilon?|access-date=February 12, 2008}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010 |bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and its male counterpart, [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]]; the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] co-ed service fraternity; gender-inclusive [[Phi Sigma Pi]] and other honor fraternities.

=== The Queen's Guard ===
The Queen's Guard was established on Feb. 8, 1961 as a special unit of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. The Guard was described by former President Davis Y. Paschall as "a unit organized, outfitted with special uniforms, and trained in appropriate drills and ceremonies as will represent the College of William and Mary in Virginia on such occasions and in such events as may be approved by the President." The uniform of the Guard loosely resemble that of the [[Scots Guard]] of the United Kingdom. The [[baldric]] is a pleated Stuart tartan, in honor of Queen Mary II and Queen Anne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/so/queensguard/|title=The Queens' Guard Homepage and Pershing Rifles Co.

==Athletics==

{{Main|William & Mary Tribe}}
Formerly known as the "Indians", William & Mary's athletic teams are now known as the "Tribe". The college fields [[NCAA Division I]] teams for men and women in basketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, swimming, tennis, and indoor and outdoor track and field. Also, there are women's field hockey, lacrosse and volleyball squads as well as men's baseball and football. In the 2004–05 season, the Tribe garnered five [[Colonial Athletic Association]] titles, and it leads the conference with over 80 titles. That same year, several teams competed in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Championships, with the football team appearing in the [[Division I-AA]] national semifinals. The men's cross country team finished 8th and 5th within the Division I [[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship]] in 2006 and 2009, respectively. The William & Mary men's basketball team is one of four original Division I schools that have never been to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament.

There have been many recent notable athletes who competed for the Tribe. On the men's soccer team, goalkeeper [[Adin Brown]] was a back-to-back [[Division I First-Team All-American (soccer)|NCAA First Team All-American]] in 1998 and 1999. The track program has produced several [[All-America]]ns, including Brian Hyde, an [[Olympic Games|Olympian]] and collegiate record holder in the [[1500 meters|1500-meter run]], and Ed Moran, a gold medalist in the [[5000 meters|5000-meter run]] at the [[2007 Pan American Games]]. The baseball program boasts a handful of current [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] players, including relief pitcher [[Bill Bray]] with the [[Cleveland Indians]] organization, 11 year MLB career Curtis Pride [[Montreal Expos]], [[New York Yankees]], [[Atlanta Braves]], [[Detroit Tigers]], and [[Colorado Rockies]] utility infielder [[Brendan Harris]]. The [[William & Mary Tribe football|football program]] has also produced numerous [[National Football League|NFL]] players and coaches: All-Pro safety [[Darren Sharper]], current [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] head coach [[Mike Tomlin]], current Buffalo Bills head coach [[Sean McDermott]], cornerback [[Derek Cox]], kicker [[Steve Christie]], long snapper [[Mike Leach (long snapper)|Mike Leach]], [[Walter Payton Award]]-winning quarterback [[Lang Campbell]], wide receiver [[Dominique Thompson]], [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] coaches [[Marv Levy]] and [[Lou Holtz]], and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] linebackers coach [[Mark Duffner]].

In May 2006, the NCAA ruled that the athletic logo, which includes two green and gold feathers, could create an environment offensive to the American Indian community, even though the Florida State Seminoles logo and Utah Utes logo were considered unoffensive. The college's appeal regarding the use of the institution's athletic logo to the NCAA Executive Committee was rejected. The "Tribe" nickname, by itself, was found to be neither hostile nor abusive, but rather communicates ennobling sentiments of commitment, shared idealism, community and common cause.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/news/?id=5338 |title='Tribe' refers to community Nichol states in a report sent to the NCAA {{pipe}} University Relations |publisher=Wm.edu |access-date=September 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218091251/http://www.wm.edu/news/?id=5338 |archive-date=February 18, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> The college stated it would phase out the use of the two feathers by the fall of 2007, although they can still be seen prominently painted on streets throughout the campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/news/index.php?id=6870 |title=William and Mary to change athletic logo before Fall 2007 {{pipe}} University Relations |publisher=Wm.edu |access-date=September 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218081923/http://www.wm.edu/news/index.php?id=6870 |archive-date=February 18, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2018, athletic director Samantha Huge introduced a new brand kit for the department, officially retiring and de-emphasizing the script "Tribe" logo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tribeathletics.com/news/2018/7/20/general-william-mary-athletics-reveals-revitalized-brand-and-logo.aspx|title=William & Mary Athletics Reveals Revitalized Brand and Logo|website=William & Mary Athletics|access-date=January 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030060717/https://tribeathletics.com/news/2018/7/20/general-william-mary-athletics-reveals-revitalized-brand-and-logo.aspx|archive-date=October 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the fall of 2019, Tribe Athletics presented the "Tribe 2025" plan, a comprehensive plan for the athletics department to raise national prominence, undergo significant facilities upgrades, and achieve higher levels of student involvement and spirit.<ref>William & Mary Athletics sets ambitious goals in strategic plan 'Tribe 2025' https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2019/william-mary-athletics-sets-ambitious-goals-in-strategic-plan-tribe-2025.php {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200101025444/https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2019/william-mary-athletics-sets-ambitious-goals-in-strategic-plan-tribe-2025.php |date=January 1, 2020 }}</ref>
