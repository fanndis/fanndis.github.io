The '''Black Reel Awards''', or "'''BRAs'''", is an annual [[United States|American]] awards ceremony hosted by the Foundation for the Augmentation of African-Americans in Film (FAAAF) to recognize excellence of African-Americans, as well as the cinematic achievements of the African diaspora, in the global [[film industry]], as assessed by the Foundation’s voting membership. The various category winners are awarded a copy of a statuette, officially called the Black Reel Award. The awards, first presented in 2000 in [[Washington, DC]], are overseen by FAAAF.

The awards ceremony was initially awarded online during its first two years before the first live show presentation in 2002. The awards have broadcast to radio since 2014. The Black Reel Awards is the oldest cinema-exclusive awards ceremony for African-Americans.

The [[Black Reel Awards of 2020|20th Annual Black Reel Awards]] ceremony were held on February 6, 2020.

==History==
Founded by film critic Tim Gordon and Sabrina McNeal in 2000, the [[Black Reel Awards of 2000|first annual Black Reel Awards]] presentation was held on February 16, 2000 online courtesy of Reel Images Magazine.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kearney |first1=Ryan |title='For Colored Girls' leads D.C.'s Black Reel Awards nominations |url=http://www.tbd.com/blogs/tbd-arts/2010/12/-for-colored-girls-leads-d-c-s-black-reel-awards-nominations-6007.html |work=TBD Arts |date=December 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617082846/http://www.tbd.com/blogs/tbd-arts/2010/12/-for-colored-girls-leads-d-c-s-black-reel-awards-nominations-6007.html |archivedate=June 17, 2015 }}</ref> Two years later, the [[Black Reel Awards of 2002|third annual Black Reel Awards]] held its first live presentation at a private dinner function at the Cada Vez in [[Washington, DC]] with an audience of about 150 people. Twenty statuettes were awarded, honoring African-American artists, directors and other participants in the filmmaking industry, for their works in 2001. The ceremony ran for 90 minutes.

In subsequent years, the Black Reel Awards have largely been presented in the nation’s capital, with the exception of one year when the awards were moved to New York. The awards have been presented live several times: the [[Black Reel Awards of 2003|fourth annual Black Reel Awards]] presentation was held at H20 on the Southwest waterfront in [[Washington, DC]] with an audience of about 200 people; the [[Black Reel Awards of 2005|sixth annual Black Reel Awards]] presentation was held at the [[French Embassy]] with an audience of about 350 people; and the [[Black Reel Awards of 2013|thirteenth annual Black Reel Awards]] presentation was held at the MIST Harlem with an audience of about 200 people.

Initially winners were announced online. Later, the live awards presentations would use a sealed envelope to reveal the name of each winner.

The Black Reel Awards benefit '''The Foundation for the Advancement of African-Americans in Film''' (FAAAF), a non-profit arts organization whose mission is to provide educational opportunities to future minority film executives. Through the FAAAF programs "Reel Kids," and "Producer's Institute," scholarships are awarded to minority junior high, high school and college graduate students pursuing careers in the movie and television industries.

In 2015, the Foundation changed its name to '''The Foundation for the Augmentation of African-Americans in Film'''.<ref>{{cite web|title=History |url=http://blackreelawards.com/history/ |publisher=Black Reel Awards |accessdate=16 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220004054/http://blackreelawards.com/history/ |archivedate=20 February 2016 }}</ref>
