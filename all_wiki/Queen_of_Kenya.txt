'''Queen of Kenya''' was a title held by [[Elizabeth II]] as the [[head of state]] of [[Kenya (1963–1964)|Kenya]] from 1963 to 1964. Her full [[Style of the British sovereign|style]] in Kenya was ''Queen of Kenya and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth''.<ref>See for example, ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=96OQ5X-LoN0C&pg=PT468 Kenya Gazette]'', 24 May 1964, p. 454</ref> She was also the Sovereign of the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, including the [[United Kingdom]]. Her roles as Kenyan head of state were delegated to the [[Governor-General of Kenya]].

The [[Kenya Independence Act 1963]] transformed the [[Kenya Colony|Colony and Protectorate of Kenya]] into an independent [[sovereign state]] with Elizabeth II as its queen. Kenya adopted a new [[Constitution of Kenya|constitution]] in 1964 which abolished the monarchy and the office of governor-general, and Kenya became a [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|republic within the Commonwealth]], with the [[President of Kenya]] as head of state.

The Queen was in Kenya at [[Treetops Hotel]] on 6 February 1952, when she became Queen of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s of the [[British Commonwealth]] on the death of her father, [[George VI]]. She had arrived in [[Nairobi]] on 1 February and had been staying at [[Sagana Lodge]], near [[Mount Kenya]]. After the news of her accession, she returned immediately to the United Kingdom via [[Entebbe Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2002/DiaryofeventsintheearlylifeofHMTheQueen.aspx|title=Diary of events in the early life of The Queen|date=1 February 2002|type=Press release|publisher=Royal Household|work=Official website of the British monarchy|accessdate=8 November 2015}}</ref> After Kenya's independence, she stopped briefly in the country on 26 March 1972 and 7 October 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/RoyalVisits/Commonwealthvisitssince1952.aspx|title=Commonwealth visits since 1952|publisher=Royal Household|work=Official website of the British monarchy|accessdate=8 November 2015}}</ref> She undertook a [[state visit]] to Kenya 10–14 November 1983, as the guest of President [[Daniel Arap Moi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/RoyalVisits/OutwardStatevisitssince1952.aspx|title=Outward State visits since 1952|publisher=Royal Household|work=Official website of the British monarchy|accessdate=8 November 2015}}</ref>
