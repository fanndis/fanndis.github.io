'''''Kommersant''''' ({{lang-ru|Коммерса́нтъ}}, {{IPA-ru|kəmʲɪrˈsant|IPA}}, ''The Businessman'', often shortened to '''[[Ъ]]''') is a nationally distributed daily newspaper published in [[Russia]] mostly devoted to politics and business. It is a leading liberal business broadsheet.<ref>{{cite news|title=The press in Russia|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4315129.stm|accessdate=29 November 2014|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=16 May 2008}}</ref> The TNS Media and NRS Russia certified July 2013 circulation of the daily was 120,000–130,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kommersant.ru/about/kommersant|title=Kommersant Website; (Russian)|year=2013|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref>

== History ==
In 1989, with the onset of press freedom in Russia, ''Kommersant'' was founded under the ownership of businessman and publicist [[Vladimir Yakovlev (journalist)|Vladimir Yakovlev]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/source-profile/356511-kommersant|title=Kommersant; Presseurop (English)|work=Presseurop|year=2012|accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> The newspaper's title is spelled in Russian with a terminal [[Yer|hard sign]] (ъ) – a letter that is silent at the end of a word in modern Russian, and was thus largely abolished by the post-revolution [[Reforms of Russian orthography#The post-revolution reform|Russian spelling reform]], in reference to a pre-Soviet newspaper of the same name active between 1909 and 1917. This is played up in the Kommersant logo, which features a script hard sign at the end of somewhat more formal font. The newspaper also refers to itself or its redaction as "Ъ".

In January 2005, ''Kommersant'' published a protest at a court ruling ordering it to publish a denial of a story about a crisis at [[Alfa-Bank]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Alfa-d Up|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p543041/r_524/Alfa-d_Up/|work=Kommersant|location=Moscow|date=31 January 2005|accessdate=28 August 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606111951/http://www.kommersant.com/p543041/r_524/Alfa-d_Up/|archivedate=6 June 2011}}</ref>
