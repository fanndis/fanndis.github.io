'''Ernst Carl Julius Albrecht''' (29 June 1930<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kas.de/statische-inhalte-detail/-/content/albrecht-ernst|title=Albrecht, Ernst|date=4 August 2010|website=www.kas.de}}</ref> – 13 December 2014) was a [[Germany|German]] politician of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] and a former high-ranking [[European Civil Service|European civil servant]]. He was one of the first European civil servants appointed in 1958 and served as Director-General of the [[Directorate-General for Competition]] from 1967 to 1970. He served as [[Minister President of Lower Saxony|Minister President]] of the [[states of Germany|state]] of [[Lower Saxony]] from 1976 to 1990. He was the father of the politician [[Ursula von der Leyen]], the [[President of the European Commission]].

==Background==
Ernst Albrecht was born in [[Heidelberg]], the son of the psychologist, psychotherapist and medical doctor [[Carl Albrecht (psychologist)|Carl Albrecht]], who was known for developing a new method of [[meditation]]; the [[Albrecht family]] had been among the ''[[hübsche families|hübsche]]'' ("genteel") families of the [[Electorate of Hanover]] as doctors, jurists and civil servants since the 17th century, but his immediate ancestors had been wealthy cotton merchants in [[Bremen]] and members of the city-state's [[Hanseaten (class)|Hanseatic]] elite in the 19th and 20th centuries. His grandmother Mary Ladson Robertson was an American of prominent [[planter class]] origin from [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and a descendant of [[James H. Ladson]] and several colonial governors.<ref>''[[Deutsches Geschlechterbuch]]'' vol. 17 p. 49</ref>

==European Commission, 1958–1970==
Ernst Albrecht studied law and economics. In 1958 he moved to [[Brussels]] where he became one of the first [[European Civil Service|European civil servants]]. He initially served as the [[Chef de Cabinet]] to the European Commissioner for Competition [[Hans von der Groeben]] in the [[Hallstein Commission]], and in 1967, at the age of 37, he became the Director-General of the [[Directorate-General for Competition]].

==Business and political career==

He entered politics in his native Germany when he was elected to the [[Landtag of Lower Saxony|Lower Saxon Landtag]] (parliament) in 1970, and moved to Hanover with his family the following year. From 1971 to 1976, he was [[CEO]] of [[Bahlsen]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.niedersachsen.de/live/live.php?navigation_id=6866&article_id=19941&_psmand=1000 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607154844/http://www.niedersachsen.de/live/live.php?navigation_id=6866&article_id=19941&_psmand=1000 |archive-date=2011-06-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

When [[Alfred Kubel]] resigned from the office of [[Minister President of Lower Saxony|State Premier]] in 1976, Albrecht was unexpectedly elected as his successor. Since he received three more votes than his party had representatives in the Legislative Assembly, some members of the governing coalition [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] must have secretly voted for him. He was re-elected in state parliament elections in 1978, 1982 and 1986. 

Albrecht is known for the decision to make the County of [[Lüchow-Dannenberg]] the state's "nuclear district"; only a radioactive waste dump at [[Gorleben]] was realized, however. During his tenure Albrecht was embroiled in an unusually large number of political scandals; most famously, the [[Celle Hole]]. In 1980, Albrecht launched a campaign for election as [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]], but he lost out to fellow conservative [[Franz-Josef Strauß]]. Albrecht lost the 1990 state elections to [[Gerhard Schröder]], who later became Chancellor.

==Personal life==
[[File:Albrecht Adele und Ernst 1985.jpg|thumb|Ernst and Adele Albrecht (1985)]]
Ernst Albrecht married Heidi Adele Stromeyer (1928–2002) in 1953. They had seven children, among them politician [[Ursula von der Leyen]] and [[Hans-Holger Albrecht]], President & CEO of the international telecom and media group [[Deezer]]. A daughter died at age 11 and one son at age 49 of cancer. 

His brother is [[George Alexander Albrecht]], a conductor. He had [[Alzheimer's disease]] since 2003,<ref>[https://www.welt.de/fernsehen/article2038166/Von_der_Leyen_und_die_Krankheit_ihres_Vaters.html ''Von der Leyen und die Krankheit ihres Vaters.''] Ein Artikel über die Sendung auf [https://www.welt.de/ www.welt.de], 27. Mai 2008.</ref> which was announced to the public in 2008.  He died at the age of 84 in [[Burgdorf, Hanover|Burgdorf]] in December 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/ernst-albrecht-ist-tot-ursula-von-der-leyen-er-hat-ein-erfuelltes-leben-gehabt/11116808.html|title=Ursula von der Leyen: "Er hat ein erfülltes Leben gehabt"|date=13 December 2014|publisher=|via=Tagesspiegel}}</ref>
