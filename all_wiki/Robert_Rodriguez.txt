'''Robert Anthony Rodriguez''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ɒ|ˈ|d|r|iː|ɡ|ɛ|z}}; born June 20, 1968)<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Cathy |last=Booth Thomas |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1093629,00.html |title=Robert Rodriguez – TIME |magazine=TIME |date=August 13, 2005 |access-date=April 24, 2009}}</ref> is an American filmmaker and visual effects supervisor. He shoots, edits, produces, and scores many of his films in [[Mexico]] and in his home state of [[Texas]]. Rodriguez directed the 1992 action film ''[[El Mariachi]]'', which was a commercial success after grossing $2 million against a budget of $7,000. The film spawned two sequels known collectively as the ''[[Mexico Trilogy]]'': ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]''. He directed ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn]]'' in 1996 and developed its [[From Dusk till Dawn: The Series|television adaptation series]] (2014–2016).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/11/el-reys-from-dusk-till-dawn-rounds-out-cast/|title=El Rey's 'From Dusk Till Dawn' Rounds Out Cast, by THE DEADLINE TEAM|author=The Deadline Team|work=Deadline|access-date=November 16, 2014}}</ref> Rodriguez co-directed the 2005 neo-noir crime thriller anthology ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' (adapted from the [[Sin City|graphic novel of the same name]]) and the 2014 sequel, ''[[Sin City: A Dame to Kill For]]''. Rodriguez also directed the ''[[Spy Kids (franchise)|Spy Kids]]'' films, ''[[The Faculty]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl]]'', ''[[Planet Terror]]'', ''[[Machete (2010 film)|Machete]]'', and ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]''. He is the best friend and frequent collaborator of filmmaker [[Quentin Tarantino]], who founded the production company [[A Band Apart]], of which Rodriguez was a member. In December 2013, Rodriguez launched his own cable television channel, [[El Rey Network|El Rey]].

==Early life==
Rodríguez was born in [[San Antonio, Texas]], the son of [[Mexico|Mexican]] parents Rebecca (née Villegas), a nurse, and Cecilio G. Rodríguez, a salesman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/37/Robert-Rodriguez.html |title=Robert Rodriguez Biography (1968?-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |access-date=April 24, 2009}}</ref><ref name=ena>{{cite book|last=Marvis|first=Barbara J.|title=Robert Rodriguez|publisher=Mitchell Lane|year=1998|pages=5|isbn=1883845483}}</ref> He began his interest in film at age eleven, when his father bought one of the first [[VCR]]s, which came with a camera.<ref>[http://www.fridaymoviez.com/celebrity/biography/robert-rodriguez "Robert Rodriguez Biography"] Friday Moviez Entertainment Guaranteed</ref>

[[File:Robert_Rodriguez_1993_Atlanta_Film_Festival.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Robert Rodriguez 1993 Atlanta Film Festival.]] 
While attending [[St. Anthony Catholic High School (San Antonio, Texas)|St. Anthony High School Seminary]] in San Antonio, Rodríguez was commissioned to videotape the school's football games. According to his sister, he was fired soon afterward as he had shot footage in a cinematic style, getting shots of parents' reactions and the ball traveling through the air instead of shooting the whole play. In high school, he met Carlos Gallardo; they both shot films on video throughout high school and college.

Rodriguez went to the [[University of Texas at Austin College of Communication|College of Communication]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he also developed a love of cartooning. Not having grades high enough to be accepted into the school's film program, he created a daily comic strip entitled ''Los Hooligans.'' Many of the characters were based on his siblings – in particular, one of his sisters, Maricarmen. The comic ran for three years in the student newspaper ''[[The Daily Texan]]'', while Rodríguez continued to make short films.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-03-07|title=King of Dreams|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/king-of-dreams/|access-date=2020-12-01|website=Texas Monthly|language=en}}</ref>

Rodríguez shot action and horror short films on video and edited on two VCRs. In late 1990, his entry in a local film contest earned him a spot in the university's film program. There he made the award-winning 16&nbsp;mm short ''[[Bedhead (film)|Bedhead]]'' (1991). The film chronicles the amusing misadventures of a young girl whose older brother sports an incredibly tangled mess of hair which she detests. Even at this early stage, Rodríguez's trademark style began to emerge: quick cuts, intense zooms, and fast camera movements deployed with a sense of humor.

''Bedhead'' (1991) was recognized for excellence in the Black Maria Film Festival. It was selected by Film/Video Curator Sally Berger for the Black Maria 20th-anniversary retrospective at [[MoMA]] in 2006.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
The short film ''Bedhead'' attracted enough attention to encourage him to seriously attempt a career as a filmmaker.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Bedhead (1991)  | publisher = Brian's Robert Rodriguez Page (Geocities) | url = http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Makeup/4303/bedhead.html/index.html  | access-date = 2007-08-16|archive-url=https://archive.today/20091025143613/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Makeup/4303/bedhead.html/index.html| url-status =dead|archive-date=2009-10-25}}</ref> He went on to shoot the action flick ''[[El Mariachi]]'' (1992) in Spanish; he shot it for around $7,000 with money raised by his friend Adrian Kano and from payments for his own participation in medical testing studies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/winter1993/film_for_song.php|title=Robert Rodriguez' El Mariachi - Filmmaker Magazine - Winter 1993|website=www.filmmakermagazine.com}}</ref> Rodriguez won the Audience Award for this film at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 1993.<ref>[http://history.sundance.org/events/28 1993 Sundance Film Festival] sundance.org</ref> Intended for the Spanish-language low-budget home-video market, the film was "cleaned up" by [[Columbia Pictures]] with post-production work costing several hundred thousand dollars before it was distributed in the United States.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/25/paranormal-activity-box-office-profit | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Paranormal Activity and the myth of the shoestring shocker | date=November 25, 2009 | access-date=May 1, 2010 | first=Tom | last=Shone}}</ref> Its promotion still advertised it as "the movie made for $7,000".

=== Mainstream success ===
[[File:Rodriguez_and_Tarantino,_2007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rodriguez and Tarantino in 2007.]]
''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'' was a sequel to ''El Mariachi'' that starred [[Antonio Banderas]] and introduced [[Salma Hayek]] to international audiences as her English-language breakthrough role.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/1995-09-01/features/9509010132_1_el-mariachi-bucho-robert-rodriguez-s-desperado|title=`Desperado' Burns Up Screen|last=Strom|first=Heidi|work=[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]]|date=September 1, 1995|access-date=February 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1995/film/reviews/desperado-2-1200441582/|title=Review: 'Desperado'|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 25, 1995|access-date=February 4, 2015}}</ref> Rodríguez went on to collaborate with [[Quentin Tarantino]] on the [[vampire]] thriller ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (also both co-producing its [[From Dusk till Dawn (film series)|two sequels]]), and he wrote, directed, and produced the [[From Dusk Till Dawn: The Series|TV series]] for his own cable network, [[El Rey (TV network)|El Rey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/11/el-reys-from-dusk-till-dawn-rounds-out-cast/|title=El Rey's 'From Dusk Till Dawn' Rounds Out Cast|author=The Deadline Team|work=Deadline|access-date=November 16, 2014}}</ref> Rodriguez has also worked with [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]], on the sci-fi thriller film ''[[The Faculty]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldstein |first=Patrick |title=The Faculty |url=http://www.teako170.com/faculty.html |newspaper=LA Times |access-date=September 29, 2012}}</ref>

In 2001, Rodríguez enjoyed his first Hollywood hit with ''[[Spy Kids (film)|Spy Kids]]'', which went on to become a movie franchise. A third "mariachi" film also appeared in late 2003, ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'', which completed the [[Mexico Trilogy]] (also called the Mariachi Trilogy). He operates a production company called [[Troublemaker Studios]], formerly Los Hooligans Productions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.robert-rodriguez.info/robert-rodriguez-biography-short/|title=The Robert Rodriguez Archives}}</ref>

Rodríguez co-directed ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' (2005), an adaptation of the [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] ''[[Sin City]]'' comic books; [[Quentin Tarantino]] guest-directed a scene. During production in 2004, Rodríguez insisted Miller be credited as co-director, because he considered the visual style of Miller's comic art to be just as important as his own in the film. However, the [[Directors Guild of America]] would not allow it, citing that only "legitimate teams", ''e.g.'', [[the Wachowskis]], could share the director's credit. Rodríguez chose to resign from the DGA, stating, "It was easier for me to quietly resign before shooting because otherwise I'd be forced to make compromises I was unwilling to make or set a precedent that might hurt the guild later on." By resigning from the DGA, Rodríguez was forced to relinquish his director's seat on the film ''[[John Carter of Mars (film)|John Carter of Mars]]'' for [[Paramount Pictures]]. Rodríguez had already signed on and had been announced as director of that film, planning to begin filming soon after completing ''Sin City''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hughes |first=David |title=The Greatest Science Fiction Movies Never Made |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |date=2008 |pages=311–22 |isbn=978-1-84576-755-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author-link=Drew McWeeny |first=Drew |last=McWeeny |title=Holy Crap!!

''Sin City'' was a critical hit in 2005 as well as a box office success, particularly for a hyperviolent comic book adaptation that did not have name recognition comparable to the ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' or ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]''. He has an interest in adapting all of Miller's ''Sin City'' comic books.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.latina.com/entertainment/celebrity/robert-rodriguez-walking-alexa-vega-down-aisle|title=Robert Rodriguez Is Walking Alexa Vega Down the Aisle|work=LATINA|access-date=December 6, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Rodríguez released ''[[The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl]]'' in 2005, a superhero-kid movie intended for the same younger audiences as his ''Spy Kids'' series. ''Sharkboy and Lavagirl'' was based on a story conceived by Rodríguez's 7-year-old son, Racer, who was given credit for the screenplay. The film grossed $39&nbsp;million at the box office.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Adventures-of-Sharkboy-and-Lavagirl-in-3-D-The#tab=summary|title=The Numbers: Where Data and the Movies Meet}}</ref>

Rodríguez wrote and directed the film ''[[Planet Terror]]'' as part of the double-bill release ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' (2007). Quentin Tarantino directed ''Grindhouse'''s other film.

He has a series of "Ten Minute Film School" segments on several of his DVD releases, showing aspiring filmmakers how to make good, profitable movies using inexpensive tactics. Starting with the ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'' DVD, Rodríguez began creating a series called "Ten Minute Cooking School" in which he revealed his recipe for "Puerco Pibil" (based on [[Cochinita pibil]], an old dish from [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]]), the same food [[Johnny Depp]]'s character, "Agent Sands" ate in the film. The popularity of this series led to the inclusion of another "Cooking School" on the two-disc version of the ''[[Sin City]]'' DVD where Rodríguez teaches the viewer how to make "Sin City Breakfast Tacos", a dish (made for his cast and crew during late-night shoots and editing sessions) utilizing his grandmother's tortilla recipe and different egg mixes for the filling. He had initially planned to release a third "Cooking School" with the DVD release of ''[[Planet Terror]]'' but then announced on the "Film School" segment of the DVD that he would put it on the ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' DVD set instead. The Cooking School, titled "Texas Barbecue...from the GRAVE!", is a dish based on the "secret barbecue recipe" of JT Hague, [[Jeff Fahey]]'s character in the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/2007/04/03/grindhouse-dvd-details-revealed|title=Grindhouse DVD Details Revealed|publisher=/Film|access-date=October 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706223001/http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/04/03/grindhouse-dvd-details-revealed/|archive-date=July 6, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Rodríguez is a strong supporter of [[digital cinematography|digital filmmaking]], having been introduced to the practice by director [[George Lucas]], who personally invited Rodríguez to use the digital cameras at Lucas's headquarters.<ref>''Once Upon a Time in Mexico'' DVD feature "Film is Dead".</ref> He was presented with the Extraordinary Contribution to Filmmaking Award at the 2010 [[Austin Film Festival]].

===''Predators''===

{{Main|Predators (film)}}
On February 7, 2010, it was announced that Rodríguez would produce a new [[Predator (film)|Predator]] sequel, entitled ''[[Predators (film)|Predators]]''. This film's script was based on early drafts he had written after seeing the original. Rodriguez's ideas included a planet-sized game preserve and various creatures used by the Predators to hunt a group of abducted yet skilled humans. Opening to mostly positive reviews, the film fared reasonably well at the box office.

===''Machete''===
{{Main|Machete (2010 film)}}
''Machete'' is a feature film directed by Rodríguez and released in September 2010. It is an expansion of a fake [[trailer (film)|trailer]] Rodriguez directed for the 2007 film ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]''. It starred [[Danny Trejo]] as the title character. Trejo, Rodriguez's 2nd cousin, has worked with him in some of his other movies such as ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'', ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'' and ''[[Spy Kids (film)|Spy Kids]]'', where Trejo first appeared as Machete. Although originally announced to be released direct-to-DVD as an extra on the ''[[Planet Terror]]'' DVD, the film was produced as a theatrical release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/20070514_machete_movie_greenlit.html |title=Machete movie greenlit! |access-date=November 17, 2007 |last=Morris |first=Clint |date=May 14, 2007 |publisher=Moviehole |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040812/http://www.moviehole.net/news/20070514_machete_movie_greenlit.html |archive-date = October 11, 2007}}</ref>

According to Rodríguez, the origins of the film go back to ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]''. He says, "When I met Danny, I said, 'This guy should be like the Mexican [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] or [[Charles Bronson]], putting out a movie every year and his name should be Machete.' So I decided to do that way back when, never got around to it until finally now. So now, of course, I want to keep going and do a feature."<ref>{{cite news |last=Moro |first=Eric |title=SXSW 07: Machete Movie Coming |publisher=IGN Film Force |date=March 11, 2007 |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/772/772081p1.html | access-date=March 27, 2007}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Rodriguez said that he wrote the screenplay back in 1993 when he cast Trejo in ''Desperado''. "So I wrote him this idea of a [[federales|federale]] from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes [[FBI]] or [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] have a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, "That's ''Machete''. He would come and do a really dangerous job for a lot of money to him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts." But I never got around to making it."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Edwards |first=Gavin |title=Horror Film Directors Dish About ''Grindhouse'' Trailers |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=April 2007 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/14022408/online_exclusive_horror_film_directors_dish_about_grindhouse_trailers/1 |access-date=April 4, 2007}}</ref>

''Machete'' was released in theaters September 3, 2010 in the U.S.A.

Since 1998, he has owned the film rights to [[Mike Allred]]'s off-beat comic ''[[Madman (Mike Allred character)|Madman]]''. The two have hinted at the project being close to beginning on several occasions without anything coming of it. However, other projects have been completed first (Allred was instrumental in connecting Rodríguez with Frank Miller, leading to the production of ''Sin City''). In 2004, Allred, while promoting his comic book, ''The Golden Plates'', announced that a screenplay by [[George Huang (director)|George Huang]] was near completion. In March 2006, it was announced that production on ''Sin City: A Dame to Kill For'' would be postponed. Allred announced at the 2006 [[WonderCon]] that production would likely commence on ''[[Madman (Mike Allred character)#Film adaptation|Madman the Movie]]'' in 2006. Huang is actually friends with Rodriguez, who advised him to pursue filmmaking as a career when Rodriguez landed a deal with [[Columbia Pictures]] where Huang was an employee.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==The "one-man film crew" and "Mariachi-style"==
[[File:Rodriguez, Robert (2007).jpg|right|150px|thumb|Rodriguez in 2007]]
Rodríguez not only has the credits of producing, directing and writing his films, he also frequently serves as [[Film editing#Film editor|editor]], [[director of photography]], [[camera operator]], [[steadicam]] operator, composer, [[production designer]], visual effects supervisor, and [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] on his films. This has earned him the nickname of "the one-man film crew". He abbreviates his numerous roles in his film credits; ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'', for instance, is "shot, chopped, and scored by Robert Rodriguez", and ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' is "shot and cut by Robert Rodriguez".

He calls his style of making movies "Mariachi-style" (in reference to his first feature film ''El Mariachi'') in which (according to the back cover of his book ''[[Rebel Without a Crew]]'') "Creativity, not money, is used to solve problems." He prefers to work at night, spending his day-time hours with his kids, when they're home, and says that he believes many creative people are "[[Night owl (person)|night people]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1185057|title=Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez|website=NPR.org}}</ref>

In his book ''[[The DV Rebel's Guide]]'', [[Stu Maschwitz]] coined the term "Robert Rodriguez list", i.e. the filmmaker compiling a list of things they have access to like cool cars, apartments, horses, samurai swords and so on, and then writing the screenplay based on that list.<ref name="DVReb" />

Rodriguez wrote a blurb for the book that stated:
<blockquote>I'd been wanting to write a book for the new breed of digital filmmakers, but now I don't have to.  My pal and fellow movie maker Stu Maschwitz has compressed years of experience into this thorough guide.  Don't make a movie without reading this book! <ref name="DVReb">{{cite book|last1=Maschwitz|first1=Stu|title=The DV rebel's guide : an all-digital approach to making killer action movies on the cheap|date=2007|publisher=Peachpit Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-0321413642|page=back cover}}</ref></blockquote>
