'''''Las Vegas Weekly''''' is a free [[alternative weekly]] newspaper based in [[Henderson, Nevada]], covering [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] arts, entertainment, culture and news. ''Las Vegas Weekly'' is published by [[Greenspun Media Group]]. The paper was founded in 1992 by James P. Reza, Greg Ryan and Robert Ringle as a free monthly publication called ''Scope Magazine'' covering Southern Nevada's culture, arts, music and lifestyle from a decidedly [[Generation X]] perspective.<ref>{{cite news

During this partnership, Reza continued on as Managing Editor, broadening the coverage to a more traditional alternative newsweekly style, and accelerated the publishing schedule to biweekly. In 1998, Reza sold his remaining interest in ''Scope'' to [[The Greenspun Corporation]], who retooled it and renamed it ''Las Vegas Weekly''.<ref>{{cite news
