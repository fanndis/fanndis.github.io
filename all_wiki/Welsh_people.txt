The [[Welsh language]] is taught in schools and protected in law. While Welsh remains the predominant language in many parts of Wales, particularly in [[North Wales]] and parts of [[West Wales]], English is the predominant language in [[South Wales]]. Though Welsh remains a common language throughout Wales and is predominant in some regions, in the English-speaking areas of Wales, many Welsh people are [[Multilingualism|bilingually fluent]] or semi-fluent in the Welsh language or, to varying degrees, capable of speaking or understanding the language at limited or conversational [[language proficiency|proficiency]] levels. Although the Welsh language and its ancestors have been spoken in what is now Wales since well before the [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|Roman incursions into Britain]], historian [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]] argues that the origin of the "Welsh nation" can be traced to the late 4th and early 5th centuries, following the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]].<ref>{{harv|Davies|1994|p=54}}</ref>

In 2016, an analysis of the geography of [[Welsh surnames]] commissioned by the [[Welsh Government]] found that 718,000 people (nearly 35% of the Welsh population) have a family name of Welsh origin, compared with 5.3% in the rest of the United Kingdom, 4.7% in New Zealand, 4.1% in Australia, and 3.8% in the United States, with an estimated 16.3 million people in the countries studied having at least partial Welsh ancestry.<ref name="Welsh names" /> Over 300,000 Welsh people live in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/cymrufyw/29851488|title=Canolfan i 300,000 o Gymry|trans-title=Centre for 300,000 Welsh|work=BBC|date=5 November 2014|language=Welsh|accessdate=6 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111162144/http://www.bbc.com/cymrufyw/29851488|archive-date=11 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Terminology==
The names "Wales" and "Welsh" are modern descendants of the Anglo-Saxon word ''wealh'', a descendant of the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] word "[[Walhaz]]", which was derived from the name of the [[Gauls|Gaulish people]] known to the Romans as [[Volcae]] and which came to refer indiscriminately to inhabitants of the [[Western Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |last= Miller |first= Katherine L. |date= 2014 |title= The Semantic Field of Slavery in Old English: Wealh, Esne, Þræl |type= Doctoral dissertation |publisher= University of Leeds |url= http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/8031/1/Katherine%20Miller%20Semantic%20Field%20of%20Slavery%20in%20Old%20English%20v%203.pdf |access-date= 8 August 2019}}</ref> The [[Old English]]-speaking [[Anglo-Saxons]] came to use the term to refer to the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] in particular. As the Britons' territories shrank, the term came ultimately to be applied to a smaller group of people, and the plural form of Wealh, {{lang|ang|Wēalas}}, evolved into the name for the territory that best maintained cultural continuity with pre-Anglo-Saxon Britain: Wales.<ref>{{harv|Davies|1994|p=71}}</ref> The modern names for various [[Romance languages|Romance-speaking]] people in [[Continental Europe]] (e.g. [[Wallonia]], [[Wallachia]], {{lang|fr|[[Valais]]}}, [[Vlachs]], and {{lang|pl|Włochy}}, the [[Polish language|Polish]] name for Italy) have a similar etymology.<ref>{{harv|Davies|1994|p=71}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} Albert Henry, {{lang|fr|''Histoire des mots Wallons et Wallonie'', Institut Jules Destrée, Coll.

The modern Welsh name for themselves (plural) is ''Cymry'' (singular: ''Cymro'' [m] and ''Cymraes'' [f]), and ''Cymru'' is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced {{IPA-cy|ˈkəm.rɨ|}}) are descended from the [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] word ''combrogi'', meaning "fellow-countrymen".<ref>{{harv|Davies|1994|p=69}}</ref> Thus, they carry a sense of "land of fellow-countrymen", "our country", and notions of fraternity. The use of the word ''Cymry'' as a self-designation derives from the [[Sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman Era]] relationship of the Welsh with the Brythonic-speaking peoples of northern England and southern Scotland, the peoples of "[[Hen Ogledd|Yr Hen Ogledd]]" ({{lang-en|The Old North}}).<ref>{{Cite journal

In [[Literature of Wales (Welsh language)|Welsh literature]], the word ''Cymry'' was used throughout the [[Middle Ages]] to describe the Welsh, though the older, more generic term ''Brythoniaid'' continued to be used to describe any of the [[Britons (historical)|Britonnic peoples]], including the Welsh, and was the more common literary term until {{circa|1100}}. Thereafter ''Cymry'' prevailed as a reference to the Welsh. Until {{circa|1560}} the word was spelt ''Kymry'' or ''Cymry'', regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland.<ref>{{harv|Davies|1994|p=69}}</ref>

During their [[Roman Britain|time in Britain]], the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] encountered tribes in present-day Wales that they called the [[Ordovices]], the [[Demetae]], the [[Silures]] and the [[Deceangli]].<ref>Cunliffe, B.

However, in prehistory Wales, England and Scotland did not exist in any way as distinctive entities in the ways they have done so for the last 1000 years. “|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127093345/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/british_prehistory/iron_01.shtml|archive-date=27 January 2010|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This language, and Celtic culture more generally, seems to have arrived in Britain during the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], though some archaeologists argue that there is no evidence for large-scale [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] migrations into Great Britain,<ref name="cunliffe">''Iron Age Britain'' by [[Barry Cunliffe]]. Batsford. {{ISBN|0-7134-8839-5}}.</ref> in which case the Celticisation of Britain would have occurred through cultural diffusion.

Most people in Wales today regard themselves as [[modern Celts]], claiming a heritage back to the Iron Age tribes. When the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman legions departed Britain]] around 400, a [[Romano-British]] culture remained in the areas the Romans had settled, and the pre-Roman cultures in others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/nation/pages/state01.shtml |title=What happened after the fall of the Roman Empire? |publisher=BBC |accessdate=17 October 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080609015441/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/nation/pages/state01.shtml |archivedate = 9 June 2008}}</ref> The people in what is now Wales continued to speak [[Common Brittonic]] with significant influence from [[Latin language|Latin]], as did people in other areas of western and northern Britain; this language eventually evolved into [[Old Welsh]].

 Davies places the change from Brythonic to Welsh between 400 and 700.}}</ref> [[Offa's Dyke]] was erected in the mid-8th century, forming a barrier between Wales and [[Mercia]].

The process whereby the indigenous population of Wales came to think of themselves as "Welsh" (a name applied to them by [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon settlers]]) is not clear. There is plenty of evidence of the use of the term ''Brythoniaid'' (Britons); meanwhile, the earliest use of the word ''Kymry'' (referring not to the people but to the land—and possibly to northern Britain in addition to Wales) is found in a poem {{circa|633}}. The name of the region in northern England now known as [[Cumbria]] is derived from the same root.<ref>Williams, Ifor. 1972. ''The beginnings of Welsh poetry'' University of Wales Press. p. 71</ref> Only gradually did ''Cymru'' (the land) and ''Cymry'' (the people) come to supplant ''Brython''. Although the Welsh language was certainly used at the time, [[Gwyn A. Williams]] argues that even at the time of the erection of Offa's Dyke, the people to its west saw themselves as Roman, citing the number of Latin inscriptions still being made into the 8th century.<ref>Williams, Gwyn A., ''The Welsh in their History'', published 1982 by Croom Helm, {{ISBN|0-7099-3651-6}}</ref> However, it is unclear whether such inscriptions reveal a general or normative use of Latin as a marker of identity or its selective use by the early [[Christian Church]].

There was immigration to Wales after the [[Norman Conquest]], several [[Normans]] encouraged immigration to their new lands; the [[Landsker Line]] dividing the [[Pembrokeshire]] "Englishry" and "Welshry" is still detectable today.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/wales/w_sw/article_4.shtml |title=The Flemish colonists in Wales: ''BBC'' website.

===Genetic studies===

Recent research on ancient DNA has concluded that much of Britain's Neolithic population was replaced by [[Bell Beaker Culture|Beaker people]] in the [[Bronze Age]].<ref name="Olalde et al.">{{cite biorxiv |last1=Olalde |first1=I |display-authors=et. al |date=May 2017|title=The Beaker Phenomenon and the Genomic Transformation of Northwest Europe|biorxiv=10.1101/135962}}</ref> The British groups encountered by the Romans were thus largely descended from these Beaker populations.

The post-Roman period saw a significant alteration in the genetic makeup of southern Britain due to the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons; however, historical evidence suggests that Wales was little affected by these migrations. A study published in 2016 compared samples from modern Britain and Ireland with DNA found in skeletons from Iron Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon era Yorkshire. The study found that most of the Iron Age and Roman era Britons showed strong similarities with both each other and modern-day Welsh populations, while modern southern and eastern English groups were closer to a later Anglo-Saxon burial.<ref>Martiniano, R., Caffell, A., Holst, M. et al. Genomic signals of migration and continuity in Britain before the Anglo-Saxons. Nat Commun 7, 10326 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10326</ref> Another study, using Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon samples from Cambridgeshire, concluded that modern Welsh people carry a 30% genetic contribution from Anglo-Saxon settlers in the post-Roman period; however, this could have been brought about due to later migration from England into Wales.<ref>Schiffels, S. ''et al.'' (2016) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26783965 ''Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon genomes from East England reveal British migration history''], Nature Communications 7, Article number:10408 doi:10.1038/ncomms10408</ref> A third study, published in 2020 and based on Viking era data from across Europe, suggested that the Welsh trace, on average, 58% of their ancestry to the Brittonic people, up to 22% from a Danish-like source interpreted as largely representing the Anglo-Saxons, 3% from Norwegian Vikings, and 13% from further south in Europe, possibly related to French immigration during the Norman period.<ref>Margaryan, A., Lawson, D.J., Sikora, M. et al.

===Modern times===
The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts; especially [[Glamorganshire]], which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911.<ref>Brian R.

=== 2001 census ===

It is uncertain how many people in Wales consider themselves to be of Welsh ethnicity, because the [[United Kingdom census, 2001|2001 UK census]] did not offer 'Welsh' as an option; respondents had to use a box marked "Other". Ninety-six per cent of the population of Wales thus described themselves as being [[White British]].<ref name="censusresults">{{cite news |author=Dr John Davies |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2755217.stm |title=Census shows Welsh language rise Friday, 14 February 2003 extracted 12-04-07 |work=BBC News |date=14 February 2003 |accessdate=17 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105005721/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2755217.stm |archive-date=5 January 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Controversy surrounding the method of determining ethnicity began as early as 2000, when it was revealed that respondents in Scotland and Northern Ireland would be able to tick a box describing themselves as of Scottish or of Irish ethnicity, an option not available for Welsh or English respondents.<ref name="censusequality">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2000/conferences/plaid_cymru/936077.stm |title=Census equality backed by Plaid 23 September 2000 extracted 12-04-07 |work=BBC News |date=23 September 2000 |accessdate=17 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081124103326/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2000/conferences/plaid_cymru/936077.stm |archive-date=24 November 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2288147.stm |title=Census results 'defy tick-box row' 30 September 2002 extracted 12-04-07 |work=BBC News |date=30 September 2002 |accessdate=17 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228215723/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2288147.stm |archive-date=28 December 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Prior to the census, Plaid Cymru backed a petition calling for the inclusion of a Welsh tick-box and for the National Assembly to have primary law-making powers and its own [[National Statistics Office]].<ref name="censusequality" />

In advance of the 2011 UK Census, the [[Office for National Statistics|Office for National Statistics (ONS)]] launched a census consultation exercise.

For the first time ever in British census history the 2011 Census gave the opportunity for people to describe their identity as Welsh or English. A 'dress rehearsal' of the Census was carried out on the Welsh island of [[Anglesey]] because of its rural nature ''and'' its high numbers of Welsh speakers.<ref name="WMail2009" />

The Census, taken on 27 March 2011, asked a number of questions relating to nationality and national identity, including ''What is your country of birth?'' ('Wales' was one of the options), ''How would you describe your national identity?'' (for the first time 'Welsh' and 'English' were included as options), ''What is your ethnic group?'' ('White Welsh/English/Scottish/Northern Irish/British' was an option) and ''Can you understand, speak, read or write Welsh?''.<ref>ONS website [http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/2011-census-questions---wales.pdf 2011 Census questions – Wales] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922222221/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/2011-census-questions---wales.pdf |date=22 September 2013 }} (Retrieved 17 October 2011)</ref>

As of the 2011 census in Wales, 66 per cent (2.0 million) of residents reported a Welsh national identity (either on its own or combined with other identities). Most residents of Wales (96 per cent, 2.9 million) reported at least one national identity of English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish, or British.  Of the 66 per cent (2.0 million) of Welsh residents who considered themselves to have a Welsh national identity in Wales in 2011, 218,000 responded that they had Welsh and British national identity.  Just under 17 per cent (519,000) of people in Wales considered themselves to have a British national identity only.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/2011censuskeystatisticsforwales/2012-12-11 |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322204758/https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/2011censuskeystatisticsforwales/2012-12-11 |archive-date=22 March 2018 |url-status=bot: unknown |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Some Welsh people are affiliated with other religions, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], and [[Sikhism]].

The 2001 Census showed that slightly fewer than 10% of the Welsh population are regular [[Church in Wales|church]] or chapel goers (a slightly smaller proportion than in England or Scotland), although about 70% of the population see themselves as Christian in some form. Judaism has quite a long history in Wales, with a Jewish community recorded in [[Swansea]] from around 1730. In August 1911, during a period of public order and industrial disputes, Jewish shops across the [[South Wales coalfield]] were damaged by mobs. Since that time the Jewish population of that area, which reached a peak of 4,000–5,000 in 1913, has declined; only [[Cardiff]] has retained a sizeable Jewish population, of about 2000 in the 2001 Census. The largest non-Christian faith in Wales is Islam, with about 22,000 members in 2001 served by about 40 mosques, following the [[Masjid-e-Abu Hurairah|first mosque]] established in [[Cardiff]]. A college for training clerics has been established at [[Llanybydder]] in [[West Wales]]. Islam arrived in Wales in the mid 19th century, and it is thought that Cardiff's [[Yemenis in the United Kingdom|Yemeni]] community is Britain's oldest Muslim community, established when the city was one of the world's largest coal exporting ports. [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] each have about 5,000 adherents in Wales, with the rural county of [[Ceredigion]] being the centre of Welsh Buddhism. [[Govinda]]'s temple and restaurant, run by the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]]s in [[Swansea]], is a focal point for many Welsh Hindus. There are about 2,000 [[Sikh]]s in Wales, with the first purpose-built [[gurdwara]] opened in the [[Riverside, Cardiff|Riverside]] area of Cardiff in 1989. In 2001 some 7,000 people classified themselves as following "other religions", including a reconstructed form of [[Druidism]], which was the pre-Christian religion of Wales (not to be confused with the Druids of the [[Gorsedd]] at the National [[Eisteddfod]] of Wales). Approximately one-sixth of the population, some 500,000 people, profess no religious faith whatsoever.

The Sabbatarian [[temperance movement]] was also historically strong among the Welsh; the sale of alcohol was prohibited on Sundays in Wales by the [[Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881]] – the first legislation specifically issued for Wales since the Middle Ages. From the early 1960s, local council areas were permitted to hold referendums every seven years to determine whether they should be "wet" or "dry" on Sundays: most of the industrialised areas in the east and south went "wet" immediately, and by the 1980s the last district, Dwyfor in the northwest, went wet; since then there have been no more Sunday-closing referendums.

==Language==
{{Main|Welsh language|History of the Welsh language|Welsh English}}
[[File:Welsh speakers in the 2011 census.png|thumb|left|upright=0.7|The proportion of respondents in the 2011 census who said they could speak Welsh]]
The Welsh language is in the [[Insular Celtic]] family; historically spoken throughout Wales, with its predecessor [[Common Brittonic]] once spoken throughout most of the island of Great Britain. Prior to the 20th century, large numbers of Welsh people spoke only Welsh, with little or no fluent knowledge of English.<ref>Janet Davies, [[University of Wales Press]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (1993). ''The Welsh Language'', page 34</ref> Welsh remains the predominant language in parts of Wales, particularly in North Wales and parts of West Wales. 

According to the 2001 census the number of Welsh speakers in Wales increased for the first time in 100 years, with 20.5% of a population of over 2.9 million claiming fluency in Welsh.<ref name="censusresults" /> In addition, 28% of the population of Wales claimed to understand Welsh.<ref name="censusresults" /> The census revealed that the increase was most significant in urban areas, such as Cardiff with an increase from 6.6% in 1991 to 10.9% in 2001, and [[Rhondda Cynon Taf]] with an increase from 9% in 1991 to 12.3% in 2001.<ref name="censusresults" />  However, the proportion of Welsh speakers declined in [[Gwynedd]] from 72.1% in 1991 to 68.7% in 2001, and in [[Ceredigion]] from 59.1% in 1991 to 51.8% in 2001.<ref name="censusresults" /> The greatest fluctuation was in Ceredigion, with a 19.5% influx of new residents since 1991.<ref name="censusresults" />

The decline in Welsh speakers in much of rural Wales is attributable to non-Welsh-speaking residents moving to North Wales, driving up property prices above what locals may afford, according to former [[Gwynedd]] county councillor [[Seimon Glyn]] of [[Plaid Cymru]], whose controversial comments in 2001 focused attention on the issue.<ref name="censusresults" /> As many as a third of all properties in Gwynedd are bought by people from outside Wales.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1123782.stm |title=Apology over 'insults' to English, BBC Wales, 3 September 2001 |work=BBC News |date=19 January 2001 |accessdate=17 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806190314/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1123782.stm |archive-date=6 August 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The issue of locals being priced out of the local housing market is common to many rural communities throughout Britain, but in Wales the added dimension of language complicates the issue, as many new residents do not learn the Welsh language.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/524419.stm |title=UK: Wales Plaid calls for second home controls, BBC Wales, November 17, 1999 |work=BBC News |date=17 November 1999 |accessdate=17 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807114726/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/524419.stm |archive-date=7 August 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

A Plaid Cymru taskforce headed by Dafydd Wigley recommended land should be allocated for affordable local housing, called for grants for locals to buy houses, and recommended that [[council tax]] on holiday homes should double.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1397281.stm |title=Plaid plan 'protects' rural areas, BBC Wales, 19 June 2001 |work=BBC News |date=19 June 2001 |accessdate=17 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806115537/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/1397281.stm |archive-date=6 August 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

However, the same census shows that 25% of residents were born outside Wales. The number of Welsh speakers in other places in Britain is uncertain, but there are significant numbers in the main cities, and there are speakers along the [[Wales-England border|Welsh-English border]].

Even among Welsh speakers, very few people speak only Welsh, with nearly all being [[bilingual]] in English. However, a large number of Welsh speakers are more comfortable expressing themselves in Welsh than in English. Some prefer to speak English in South Wales or the urbanised areas and Welsh in the North or in rural areas. A speaker's choice of language can vary according to the subject domain (known in linguistics as [[code-switching]]).

Due to an increase in Welsh-language nursery education, recent census data reveals a reversal of decades of linguistic decline: there are now more Welsh speakers under five years of age than over 60. For many young people in Wales, the acquisition of Welsh is a gateway to better careers, according to research from the [[Welsh Language Board]] and Careers Wales.<ref name=DewisDa>{{cite web|url=http://www.careerswales.com/server.php?show=nav.9579|title=Dewis Da - Why choose Welsh?|accessdate=2013-03-04|publisher=Careers Wales|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603095544/https://www.careerswales.com/server.php?show=nav.9579|archive-date=3 June 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Welsh Government identified media as one of six areas likely to experience greater demand for Welsh speakers:<ref name=DewisDa /> the sector is Wales's third-largest revenue earner.

Although Welsh is a [[minority language]], and thus threatened by the dominance of English, support for the language grew during the second half of the 20th century, along with the rise of [[Welsh nationalism]] in the form of groups such as the political party [[Plaid Cymru]] and [[Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg]] (Welsh Language Society). The language is used in the bilingual [[Welsh Assembly]] and entered on its records, with English translation. The high cost of translation from English to Welsh has proved controversial.<ref>{{cite news|last=Powys|first=Betsan|title=Mugshots and making headlines|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-18159802|work=BBC News|accessdate=2013-03-04|date=2012-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023080850/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-18159802|archive-date=23 October 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the past the rules of the [[British Parliament]] forbade the use of Welsh in any proceedings.

Welsh as a [[first language]] is largely concentrated in the less urban north and west of Wales, principally [[Gwynedd]], inland [[Denbighshire]], northern and south-western [[Powys]], the [[Isle of Anglesey]], [[Carmarthenshire]], North [[Pembrokeshire]], [[Ceredigion]], and parts of western [[Glamorgan]], although first-language and other fluent speakers can be found throughout Wales. However, Cardiff is now home to an urban Welsh-speaking population (both from other parts of Wales and from the growing Welsh-medium schools of Cardiff itself) due to the centralisation and concentration of national resources and organisations in the capital.

For some, speaking Welsh is an important part of their Welsh identity. Parts of the culture are strongly connected to the language&nbsp;— notably the Eisteddfod tradition, poetry and aspects of folk music and dance. Wales also has a strong tradition of poetry in the English language.

[[Patagonian Welsh]] (Cymraeg y Wladfa) is a dialect of the [[Welsh language]] which is spoken in [[Y Wladfa]] in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] region, [[Patagonia]].

==National symbols==
{{main|National symbols of Wales}}
* The [[Flag of Wales]] (Y Ddraig Goch) incorporates the [[red]] [[dragon]], a popular symbol of Wales and the Welsh people, along with the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] colours of green and white. It was used by Henry VII at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] in 1485, after which it was carried in state to [[St. Paul's Cathedral]]. The red dragon was then included in the Tudor royal arms to signify their Welsh descent. It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. Since the British [[Union Flag]] does not have any Welsh representation, the Flag of Wales has become very popular.
* The [[Flag of Saint David]] is sometimes used as an alternative to the national flag, and is flown on [[Saint David's Day]].
* The [[dragon]], part of the national flag design, is also a popular Welsh symbol. The oldest recorded use of the dragon to symbolise Wales is from the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', written around 820, but it is popularly supposed to have been the battle standard of [[King Arthur]] and other ancient Celtic leaders. Following the annexation of Wales by England, the dragon was used as a supporter in the English monarch's coat of arms.
* Both the [[daffodil]] and the [[leek]] are symbols of Wales. The origin of the leek can be traced back to the 16th century and the daffodil, encouraged by [[David Lloyd George]], became popular in the 19th century.<ref>{{harv|Davies|1994|p=189}}</ref> This may be due to confusion of the Welsh for leek, ''cenhinen'', and that for daffodil, ''cenhinen Bedr'' or St. Peter's leek. Both are worn as symbols by the Welsh on [[Saint David's Day]], 1 March.
* The Prince of Wales's Feathers, the heraldic badge of the [[Prince of Wales]], is sometimes adapted by Welsh bodies for use in Wales. The symbolism is explained on the article for [[Edward, the Black Prince#Emblem|Edward, the Black Prince]], who was the first Prince of Wales to bear the emblem. The [[Welsh Rugby Union]] uses such a design for its own badge.

==Welsh emigration==
