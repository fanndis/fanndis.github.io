=== Reception ===
In October 2019, Thomas Hobbs of ''[[Dazed]]'' wrote,<ref name=":11" />
{{Quote|text=With a look that sits somewhere between [[Harley Quinn]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]], [Rico Nasty]’s aesthetic is proudly nonconformist, while her raspy drawl – which frequently transitions into passionate, cathartic screams – has just as much in common with [[post-punk]] bands like [[The Raincoats]] as it does hip hop artists like [[City Girls]]. Rico’s voice feels at once strong and vulnerable as she drains every last bit of emotion out of her vocal cords. When she spits, you feel it in the pit of your stomach – vengeful songs like "Smack a Bitch" and "Roof" recall the raw firecracker energy of emcees like [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] and [[Sticky Fingaz]], albeit with rainbow-coloured nails and deliriously camp make-up. For Rico, traditional notions of femininity and masculinity are two sides of the same coin, and she’ll often channel both within the same song, moving quickly from being overwhelmed by emotion to being ready to smack you right in the face.}}
