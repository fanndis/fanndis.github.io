==Novel==
{{Main|Queen Sugar (novel)}}
[[UCLA]] graduate Natalie Baszile started writing ''Queen Sugar'', the novel, in the early 1990s, but the text was only completed ten years later. She first presented the manuscript to publishers in 2009 but without any success. After revising the book for another two years, she resubmitted the text, with one agent agreeing to represent her.

Baszile took part in a women writer's retreat in [[Hedgebrook]]. A friend of hers who was also at the retreat, the novelist Sarah Manyika, suggested that she read part of ''Queen Sugar'' to fellow residents. Leigh Haber, ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]'''s book editor was attending and loved the novel and passed it to people at Oprah's [[Harpo Productions]]. A few months after that, Harpo called to say they wanted to option the book for a project.<ref>[http://lithub.com/natalie-baszile-wrote-the-book-she-wanted-to-read-queen-sugar/# LiteraryHub.com : Natalie Baszile wrote the book she wanted to read: Queen Sugar - Misan Sagay in conversation with the author of one of Oprah's favorite books]</ref>

The book was published by Penguin in 2014 as Baszile's debut novel and, a few months later, OWN negotiated the deal to turn the book into a television series.
