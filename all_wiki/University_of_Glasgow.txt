The '''University of Glasgow''' (abbreviated as '''''Glas.''''' in [[Post-nominal letters|post-nominals]]; {{Lang-gd|Oilthigh Ghlaschu}}<ref>{{Cite web|title=University of Glasgow - Explore - UofG Gàidhlig|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/explore/gaelic/|access-date=2020-11-09|website=www.gla.ac.uk}}</ref>) is a [[Public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. Founded by [[papal bull]] in 1451, it is the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|fourth-oldest university]] in the [[English-speaking world]] and one of Scotland's four [[Ancient university|ancient universities]]. Along with the universities of [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]], and [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], the university was part of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] during the 18th century.

In common with universities of the pre-modern era, Glasgow originally educated students primarily from wealthy backgrounds; however, it became a pioneer{{citation needed|reason=That GU participated in the broadening of tertiary ed is probably uncontroversial; but a citation would be good for the claim that it was a *pioneer* in that broadening.|date=June 2015}} in British higher education in the 19th century by also providing for the needs of students from the growing urban and commercial [[middle class]]. Glasgow University served all of these students by preparing them for professions: the law, medicine, civil service, teaching, and the church. It also trained smaller but growing numbers for careers in science and engineering.<ref>Paul L.

==History==

The University of Glasgow was founded in 1451 by a charter or [[papal bull]] from [[Pope Nicholas V]], at the suggestion of [[James II of Scotland|King James II]], giving Bishop [[William Turnbull (bishop)|William Turnbull]], a graduate of the [[University of St Andrews]], permission to add a university to the city's Cathedral.<ref>[http://www.archives.gla.ac.uk/about/publish/histcon.pdf University of Glasgow – Who, Where and When]. Retrieved 22 April 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327001623/http://www.archives.gla.ac.uk/about/publish/histcon.pdf |date=27 March 2006 }}</ref> It is the second-oldest university in Scotland after St Andrews and the fourth-oldest in the English-speaking world. The universities of St Andrews, Glasgow and [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]] were ecclesiastical foundations, while [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] was a civic foundation. As one of the ancient universities of the United Kingdom, Glasgow is one of only eight institutions to award undergraduate master's degrees in certain disciplines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uniserveducation.com/tz/university-of-glasgow/|title=University of Glasgow|date=2016-01-12|website=Uniserv Education|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-04}}</ref>

The university has been without its original Bull since the mid-sixteenth century. In 1560, during the political unrest accompanying the [[Scottish Reformation]], the then chancellor, Archbishop [[James Beaton II|James Beaton]], a supporter of the [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Marian cause]], fled to France. He took with him, for safe-keeping, many of the archives and valuables of the Cathedral and the university, including the Mace and the Bull. Although the Mace was sent back in 1590, the archives were not. Principal Dr James Fall told the Parliamentary Commissioners of Visitation on 28 August 1690, that he had seen the Bull at the Scots College in Paris, together with the many charters granted to the university by the monarchs of Scotland from [[James II of Scotland|James II]] to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. The university enquired of these documents in 1738, but was informed by [[Thomas Innes (historian)|Thomas Innes]] and the superiors of the [[Scots College (Paris)|Scots College]] that the original records of the foundation of the university were not to be found. If they had not been lost by this time, they certainly went astray during the [[French Revolution]] when the Scots College was under threat. Its records and valuables were moved for safe-keeping out of the city of Paris. The Bull remains the authority by which the university awards degrees.

Teaching at the university began in the chapterhouse of [[Glasgow Cathedral]], subsequently moving to nearby [[Rottenrow]], in a building known as the "Auld Pedagogy". The university was given {{Cvt|13|acre}} of land belonging to the Black Friars (Dominicans) on [[High Street, Glasgow|High Street]] by Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1563.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH0172&type=P |title = Biography of Queen Mary |accessdate =15 October 2008 |publisher = University of Glasgow }}</ref> By the late 17th century its building centred on two courtyards surrounded by walled gardens, with a clock tower, which was one of the notable features of Glasgow's skyline—reaching {{convert|140|ft}} in height<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSD00553&t=2 |title = Old College Inner Court |accessdate =27 February 2019 |website=The Glasgow Story }}</ref>—and a chapel adapted from the church of the former [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] (Blackfriars) friary. Remnants of this Scottish Renaissance building, mainly parts of the main façade, were transferred to the Gilmorehill campus and renamed as the "Pearce Lodge", after [[Sir William Pearce, 1st Baronet|Sir William Pearce]], the shipbuilding magnate who funded its preservation. The [[Lion and Unicorn Staircase]] was also transferred from the old college site and is now attached to the Main Building.

[[John Anderson (natural philosopher)|John Anderson]], while professor of natural philosophy at the university, and with some opposition from his colleagues, pioneered [[vocational education]] for working men and women during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. To continue this work in his will, he founded [[Royal College of Science and Technology|Anderson's College]], which was associated with the university before merging with other institutions to become the [[University of Strathclyde]] in 1964.

In 1973, [[Delphine Parrott]] became its first female professor, as Gardiner Professor of Immunology.<ref name=bsi>{{cite web |url=https://www.immunology.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=1188 |title=BSI Honorary member: Delphine Parrott |author=Thomas T. MacDonald |publisher=[[British Society for Immunology]] |accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>

In October 2014, the university court voted for the university to become the first academic institution in Europe to [[Fossil fuel divestment|divest from the fossil fuel industry]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/08/glasgow-becomes-first-university-in-europe-to-divest-from-fossil-fuels |title=Glasgow becomes first university in Europe to divest from fossil fuels |first=Libby |last=Brooks |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 October 2014 |accessdate=8 October 2014}}</ref>

==Campus==
[[File:University of Glasgow, Older Building Sign.JPG|thumb|University of Glasgow, Older Building Sign]]
The university is currently spread over a few campuses. The main one is the Gilmorehill campus, in [[Hillhead]]. As well as this there is the Garscube Estate in [[Bearsden]], housing the [[University of Glasgow School of Veterinary Medicine|Veterinary School]], [[Observatory]], [[ship model basin]] and much of the University's sports facilities, the [[Glasgow Dental Hospital and School|Dental School]] in the city centre, the section of Mental Health and Well Being at [[Gartnavel Royal Hospital]] on Great Western Road, the Teaching and Learning Centre at the [[Queen Elizabeth University Hospital]] and the Crichton campus in Dumfries (operated jointly by the University of Glasgow, the [[University of the West of Scotland]] and the [[Open University]]).

The Imaging Centre of Excellence (ICE) was opened at the [[Queen Elizabeth University Hospital]] on 29 March 2017, including a Clinical Innovation Zone spanning {{Convert|11000|sqft}} of collaboration space for researchers and industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/colleges/mvls/ice/|title=University of Glasgow - Colleges - College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences - Imaging Centre of Excellence (ICE)|website=www.gla.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}</ref>

===High Street===
[[File:Glasgow University in 1650.jpg|right|thumb|The University of Glasgow in 1650]]
The university's initial accommodation including [[Glasgow University Library]]<ref>"The University of Glasgow Library: Friendly Shelves" published by The Friends of Glasgow University Library in association with the Library (2016)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.friendsofgul.org|title=Friends of Glasgow University Library|website=Friends of Glasgow University Library}}</ref> was part of the complex of religious buildings in the precincts of [[Glasgow Cathedral]]. In 1460, the university received a grant of land from [[James Hamilton, 1st Lord Hamilton|James, Lord Hamilton]], on the east side of the [[High Street, Glasgow|High Street]], immediately north of the Blackfriars Church, on which it had its home for the next four hundred years. In the mid-seventeenth century, the Hamilton Building was replaced with a very grand two-court building with a decorated west front facing the High Street, called the 'Nova Erectio', or New Building. This foundation is widely considered to have been one of the finest 17th-century buildings in Scotland. Decorated fragments from it, including a complete exterior stairway, were rescued and built into its 19th-century replacement. In Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s best-selling 1817 novel ''[[Rob Roy (novel)|Rob Roy]]'', set at the time of the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]], the lead character fights a duel in the New Building grounds before the contest is broken up by [[Rob Roy MacGregor]].

Over the following centuries, the university's size and scope continued to expand. In 1757 it built the [[Macfarlane Observatory]] and later Scotland's first public museum, the [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian]]. It was a centre of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and subsequently of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and its expansion in the High Street was constrained. The area around the university declined as well-off residents moved westwards with expansion of the city and overcrowding of the immediate area by less well-off residents. It was this rapid slumming of the area that was a chief catalyst of the university's migration westward.

===Gilmorehill===

[[File:Tower of The University of Glasgow.jpg|thumb|The university's tower overlooking [[Kelvingrove Park]], as seen from Partick Bridge over the [[River Kelvin]]]]

In 1870, the university moved to a (then [[greenfield land|greenfield]]) site on Gilmorehill in the West End of the city, around {{Convert|3|mi|0|spell=in}} west of its previous location, enclosed by a large [[meander]] of the [[River Kelvin]]. The original site on the High Street was sold to the [[City of Glasgow Union Railway]] and replaced by the College [[goods yard]]. The new-build campus was designed by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]] in the [[Gothic revival]] style. The largest of these buildings echoed, on a far grander scale, the original High Street campus's twin-[[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] layout, and may have been inspired by [[Ypres]]' late-medieval [[cloth hall]]; Gilmorehill in turn inspired the design of the Clocktower complex of buildings for the new [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand. In 1879, Gilbert Scott's son, [[John Oldrid Scott|Oldrid]], completed this original vision by building an open [[undercroft]] forming two quadrangles, above which is his grand Bute Hall (used for examinations and graduation ceremonies), named after its donor, [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute]]. Oldrid also later added a spire to the building's signature [[gothic architecture|gothic]] [[bell tower]] in 1887, bringing it to a total height of some {{convert|85|m}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://glasgowuniversity.wordpress.com/tag/dusk/|title=Dusk &#124; Photos from Glasgow University |publisher=Glasgowuniversity.wordpress.com |accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref> The local [[Bishopbriggs]] blond sandstone cladding and Gothic design of the building's exterior belie the modernity of its [[Victorian era|Victorian]] construction; Scott's building is structured upon what was then a cutting-edge riveted [[steel frame|iron frame]] construction, supporting a lightweight wooden-beam roof. The building also forms the second-largest example of Gothic revival architecture in Britain, after the [[Palace of Westminster]]. An illustration of the Main Building currently features on the reverse side of the current series of [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|£100 notes]] issued by the [[Clydesdale Bank]].<ref name="scotbanks">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_clydesdale_bank.php|title=Current Banknotes: Clydesdale Bank|publisher=The Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers|accessdate=30 October 2008}}</ref>

The university's [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]] resides in the Main Building, and the related Hunterian Gallery is housed in buildings adjacent to the University Library.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/about/visit/attractions/ |title=About us: visit us: visitor attractions |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> The latter includes "The Mackintosh House", a rebuilt terraced house designed by, and furnished after, architect [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]].

Even these enlarged premises could not contain the expanding university, which quickly spread across much of Gilmorehill. The 1930s saw the construction of the award-winning round Reading Room (it is now a category-A [[listed building]]) and an aggressive programme of house purchases, in which the university (fearing the surrounding district of Hillhead was running out of suitable building land) acquired several terraces of Victorian houses and joined them together internally. The departments of Psychology, Computing Science and most of the Arts Faculty continue to be housed in these terraces.
[[File:History department.jpg|thumb|right|The School of History building occupies what were formerly townhouses on University Avenue.]]
More buildings were built to the west of the Main Building, developing the land between University Avenue and the River Kelvin with natural science buildings and the faculty of medicine. The medical school spread into neighbouring [[Partick]] and joined with the [[Western Infirmary]]. At the eastern flank of the Main Building, the James Watt Engineering Building was completed in 1959. The growth and prosperity of the city, which had originally forced the university's relocation to [[Hillhead]], again proved problematic when more real estate was required. The school of veterinary medicine, which was founded in 1862, moved to a new campus in the leafy surrounds of Garscube Estate, around {{Convert|2|mi|0|spell=in}} west of the main campus, in 1954. The university later moved its sports ground and associated facilities to Garscube and also built student halls of residence in both Garscube and [[Maryhill]].

The growth of tertiary education, as a result of the [[Robbins Report]] in the 1960s, led the university to build numerous modern buildings across Hillhead, including several [[Brutalist architecture|brutalist]] concrete blocks: the Mathematics building; the [[John Boyd Orr|Boyd Orr]] Building and the Adam Smith building (housing the Faculty of Law, Business and Social Sciences, named after university graduate [[Adam Smith]]). Other additions around this time, including the new glass-lined [[Glasgow University Library]], Rankine Building for Civil Engineering (named for [[Macquorn Rankine]]) and the amber-brick Gregory Building (housing the Geology department), were more in keeping with Gilmorehill's leafy suburban architecture. The erection of these buildings in the late 1960s, however, involved the demolition of a large number of houses in Ashton Road, and rerouting the west end of University Avenue to its current position. To cater for the expanding student population, a new [[refectory]], known as the Hub, was opened adjacent to the library in 1966. The Glasgow University Union also had an extension completed in 1965 and the new Queen Margaret Union building opened in 1969.

In October 2001 the century-old Bower Building (previously home to the university's botany department) was gutted by fire. The interior and roof of the building were largely destroyed, though the main façade remained intact. After a £10.8 million refit, the building re-opened in November 2004.

The [[Wolfson Medical School Building]], with its award-winning glass-fronted atrium, opened in 2002,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/medicine/mus/wolfsonmedicalschool/ |title=School of Medicine: Undergraduate Medical School: Wolfson Medical School Building |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=26 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603013739/http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/medicine/mus/wolfsonmedicalschool/ |archive-date=3 June 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and in 2003, the St Andrews Building was opened, housing the what is now the School of Education. It is sited a short walk from Gilmorehill, in the [[Woodlands, Glasgow|Woodlands]] area of the city on the site of the former Queens College, which had in turn been bought by [[Glasgow Caledonian University]], from whom the university acquired the site. It replaced the St Andrews Campus in [[Bearsden]]. The university also procured the former Hillhead Congregational Church, converting it into a lecture theatre in 2005. The Sir Alwyn Williams building, designed by Reiach and Hall, was completed at Lilybank Terrace in 2007, housing the School of Computing Science.

In September 2016 in partnership with [[Glasgow City Council]], [[Glasgow Life]] and the [[National Library of Scotland]] the transformed [[Kelvin Hall]] has been brought into new public use including in Phase I the Hunterian Collections and Study Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kelvinhall.org.uk/|title=Kelvin Hall|website=kelvinhall.org.uk}}</ref>

The university is investing £1 billion to expand its campus now that it has acquired what was formerly known as the [[Western Infirmary]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/campusdevelopment/|title=University of Glasgow - MyGlasgow - Campus Development|website=www.gla.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}</ref>

====Chapel====
{{Main|University of Glasgow Memorial Chapel}}
The University Chapel was constructed as a memorial to the 755 sons of the university who had lost their lives in the First World War. Designed by [[John James Burnet|Sir John Burnet]], it was completed in 1929 and dedicated on 4 October. Tablets on the wall behind the Communion Table list the names of those who died, while other tablets besides the stalls record the 405 members of the university community who gave their lives in the Second World War. Most of the windows are the work of [[Douglas Strachan]], although some have been added over the years, including those on the South Wall, created by Alan Younger.

Daily services are held in the chapel during term-time, as well as seasonal events. Before Christmas, there is a Service of [[Nine Lessons and Carols]] on the last Sunday of term, and a [[Watchnight service]] on Christmas Eve. Graduates, students, members of staff and the children of members of staff are entitled to be married in the chapel, which is also used for [[baptism]]s and funerals. [[Civil marriage]]s and [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]] may be blessed in the chapel, although under UK law may not be performed there.{{Verify source|date=December 2018}}

The current [[chaplain]] of the university is the Reverend Stuart MacQuarrie, and the university appoints honorary chaplains of other denominations.

Situated over 12 floors, it hosts more than 3 million books and journals, as well as providing access to an extensive range of electronic resources including over 51,900 electronic journals. It also houses sections for periodicals, microfilms, special collections and rare materials.<ref name="library">{{cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/about/librariesmuseumsandarchives/|title=Libraries, museums and archives|publisher=University of Glasgow|accessdate=13 May 2014}}</ref> Open between 7&nbsp;a.m. and 2&nbsp;a.m., 361 days of the year, the library provides a resource not only for the academic community.

In addition to the main library, subject libraries also exist for Medicine, Chemistry, Dental Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, Education, Law, History of Art, and the faculty of Social Sciences, which are held in branch libraries around the campus.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/timeline/index.html |title=Glasgow University Library Timeline |publisher=Special.lib.gla.ac.uk |accessdate=22 January 2011}}</ref> In 2007, a state-of-the-art section to house the library's collection of historic photographs was opened, funded by the Wolfson Foundation.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

The [[Archives of the University of Glasgow]] are the central place of deposit for the records of the university, created and accumulated since its foundation in 1451.

===Crichton campus, Dumfries===
The university opened the [[The Crichton|Crichton campus]] in [[Dumfries]], [[Dumfries and Galloway]] during the 1980s. It was designed to meet the needs for tertiary education in an area far from major cities and is operated jointly by the University of Glasgow, the [[University of the West of Scotland]] and the [[Open University]]. It offers a modular undergraduate curriculum, leading to one of a small number of liberal arts degrees, as well as providing the region's only access to postgraduate study.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.gla.ac.uk |title=University of Glasgow, Crichton Campus, Dumfries |publisher=Cc.gla.ac.uk |date=22 May 2010 |accessdate=22 January 2011}}</ref>

===Non-teaching facilities===
As well as these teaching campuses the university has halls of residence in and around the North-West of the city, accommodating a total of approximately 3,500 students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/studentlife/accommodation/ |title=Student life: Accommodation |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> These include the Murano Street halls in Maryhill; Wolfson halls on the Garscube Estate; Queen Margaret halls, in [[Kelvinside]]; Cairncross House and Kelvinhaugh Gate, in [[Yorkhill]]. In recent years, Dalrymple House and Horslethill halls in [[Dowanhill]], Reith halls in [[North Kelvinside]] and the Maclay halls in Park Circus (near [[Kelvingrove Park]]), have closed and been sold, as the development value of such property increased.

The [[Sir Daniel Macaulay Stevenson|Stevenson]] Building on Gilmorehill opened in 1961 and provides students with the use of a fitness suite, squash courts, sauna and six-lane, 25-metre swimming pool. The university also has a large sports complex on the Garscube Estate, beside their Wolfson Halls and Vet School. This is a new facility, replacing the previous ''Westerlands'' sports ground in the [[Anniesland]] area of the city. The university also has use of half of the East Boathouse situated at [[Glasgow Green]] on the [[River Clyde]] where [[Glasgow University Boat Club]] train.

==Governance and administration==
[[File:GFDL Gla Uni Main Building East.JPG|thumb|Eastern section of the main building of the university]]
{{Further|Ancient university governance in Scotland}}
In common with the other [[ancient universities of Scotland]] the university's constitution is laid out in the Universities (Scotland) Acts. These Acts create a tripartite structure of bodies: the [[University Court]] (governing body), the [[Academic Senate]] (academic affairs) and the [[General Council (Scottish university)|General Council]] (advisory). There is also a clear separation between governance and executive administration.

The university's constitution, academic regulations, and appointments are described in the university calendar,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/senateoffice/calendar/ |title=Services A-Z: Senate office: University calendar |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=9 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200250/http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/senateoffice/calendar/ |archive-date=10 September 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> while other aspects of its story and constitution are detailed in a separate "history" document.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_61834_en.pdf |title=Who, Where and When: The History & Constitution of the University of Glasgow |publisher=University of Glasgow |year=2001 |accessdate=26 June 2014}}</ref>

===Officers===
There are several officers of the university. The role of each involves management of the operations of Glasgow.

====Chancellor====
{{Main|Chancellor of the University of Glasgow}}
The Chancellor is the titular head of the university and President of the [[General Council (Scottish university)|General Council]]. They award all degrees, although this duty is generally carried out by the Vice-Chancellor, appointed by them.

The current Chancellor is [[Katherine Grainger|Dame Katherine Grainger]], a former rower who is Britain's most decorated female Olympian, the current chair of [[UK Sport]], and former Chancellor of [[Oxford Brookes University]]. She is an alumna of the university, with a [[Master of Philosophy]] (MPhil) in Medical Law and Medical Ethics. She is the first woman to hold the office in the University.

====Rector====
{{Main|Rector of the University of Glasgow}}
All students at the university are eligible to vote in the election of the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] (officially styled "Lord Rector"), who holds office for a three-year term and chairs the University Court. In the past, this position has been a largely honorary and ceremonial one, and has been held by political figures including [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], [[Benjamin Disraeli]], [[Bonar Law]], [[Robert Peel]], [[Raymond Poincaré]], [[Arthur Balfour]], [[Charles Kennedy]] and 1970s union activist [[Jimmy Reid]], and latterly by celebrities such as TV presenters [[Arthur Montford]] and [[Johnny Ball]], musician [[Pat Kane]], and actors [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]], [[Ross Kemp]] and [[Greg Hemphill]]. In 2004, for the first time in its history, the university was left without a Rector as no nominations were received. When the elections were run in December, [[Mordechai Vanunu]] was chosen for the post,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4100119.stm |title=Vanunu elected university rector |work=BBC News |date=16 December 2004 |accessdate=22 April 2006}}</ref> even though he was unable to attend due to restrictions placed upon him by the Israeli government. In 2014, [[Edward Snowden]], an American computer specialist, a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor—who came to international attention when he disclosed a large number of classified NSA documents to several media outlets—was elected.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/edward-snowden-elected-rector-of-glasgow-university-9137052.html |title=Edward Snowden elected rector of Glasgow University |work=[[The Independent]] |last=Davies |first=Elliot |date=18 February 2014 |accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> The current Rector, elected on 21 March 2017, is [[Aamer Anwar]], a Scottish lawyer and former student of the university.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stv.tv/news/west-central/1383783-aamer-anwar-voted-as-new-glasgow-university-rector/ |title=Aamer Anwar voted as new Glasgow University rector |work=[[STV News]] |last= Barrie |first=Douglas |date=21 March 2017 |accessdate=21 March 2017}}</ref>

====Principal====
{{Main|Principal of the University of Glasgow}}
Day-to-day management of the university is undertaken by the [[University Principal]] (who is also [[Vice-Chancellor]]). The current principal is Sir [[Anton Muscatelli]] who replaced Sir [[Muir Russell]] in October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/news/archiveofnews/2009/october/headline_132274_en.html |title=Archive of News: University of Glasgow welcomes new Principal |publisher=University of Glasgow |date=October 2009 |accessdate= 26 June 2014}}</ref>

There are also several Vice-Principals, each with a specific remit. They, along with the Clerk of Senate, play a major role in the day-to-day management of the university.

===University Court===
The governing body of the university is the [[University Court]], which is responsible for contractual matters, employing staff, and all other matters relating to finance and administration. The Court takes decisions about the deployment of resources as well as formulating strategic plans for the university. The Court is chaired by the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]], who is elected by all the [[Matriculation|matriculated students]] at the university. The University Secretary is the Head of University Services and assists the Principal in day-to-day management. The current University Secretary is David Duncan.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/stafflist/?action=person&id=4edce9e78092|title=Staff list |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref>

===Academic Senate===
The [[Academic Senate]] (or University Senate) is the body which is responsible for the management of academic affairs, and which recommends the conferment of degrees by the Chancellor. Membership of the Senate comprises all [[List of Professorships at the University of Glasgow|Professors of the university]], as well as elected academic members, representatives of the [[Glasgow University Students' Representative Council|Student's Representative Council]], the Secretary of Court and directors of university services (e.g. [[Glasgow University Library|Library]]). The President of the Senate is the Principal.

The Clerk of Senate, who has status equivalent to that of a Vice-Principal and is a member of the Senior Management Group, has responsibility for regulation of the university's academic policy, such as dealing with plagiarism and the conduct of examinations. Notable Clerks of Senate have included the chemist, [[Joseph Black]]; [[John H. D. Anderson|John Anderson]], father of the [[University of Strathclyde]]; and the economist, [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]].

===Committees===
There are also a number of committees of both the Court and Senate that make important decisions and investigate matters referred to them. As well as these bodies there is a General Council made up of the university graduates that is involved in the running of the university. The graduates also elect the Chancellor of the university.

At the university's foundation in 1451, there were four original [[Faculty (division)|faculties]]: Arts, Divinity, Law and Medicine. The Faculty of Divinity became a constituent school of the Faculty of Arts in 2002,<ref>{{cite web|title=Corporate Biography of the Faculty of Divinity|url=http://www.gashe.ac.uk/public_docs/isaar/C2070.html|publisher=Gateway to Archives of Scottish Higher Education|date=31 August 2005|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref> while the Faculty of Law was changed in 1984 into the Faculty of Law and Financial Studies, and in 2005 became the Faculty of Law, Business and Social Sciences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Corporate Biography of the Faculty of Law and Financial Studies|url=http://www.gashe.ac.uk/public_docs/isaar/C2075.html|publisher=Gateway to Archives of Scottish Higher Education|date=1 September 2005|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref> Although one of the original faculties established, teaching in the Faculty of Medicine did not begin formally until 1714, with the revival of the [[Regius Professor of Medicine and Therapeutics, Glasgow|Chair in the Practice of Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Corporate Biography of the Faculty of Medicine|url=http://www.gashe.ac.uk/public_docs/isaar/C2076.html|publisher=Gateway to Archives of Scottish Higher Education|date=1 September 2005|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref> The Faculty of Science was formed in 1893 from Chairs removed from the Faculties of Arts and Medicine, and subsequently divided in 2000 to form the three Faculties of Biomedical and Life Sciences, Computing Science, Mathematics and Statistics (now Information and Mathematical Sciences) and Physical Sciences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Corporate Biography of the Faculty of Science|url=http://www.gashe.ac.uk/public_docs/isaar/C2082.html|publisher=Gateway to Archives of Scottish Higher Education|date=2 September 2005|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref> The Faculty of Social Sciences was formed from Chairs in the Faculty of Arts in 1977, and merged to form the Faculty of Law, Business and Social Sciences in 2005, the two having operated as a single 'resource unit' since 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Corporate Biography of the Faculty of Social Sciences|url=http://www.gashe.ac.uk/public_docs/isaar/C2083.html|publisher=Gateway to Archives of Scottish Higher Education|date=2 September 2005|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref> The Faculty of Engineering was formally established in 1923, although engineering had been taught at the university since 1840 when [[Queen Victoria]] founded the UK's first Chair of Engineering.

It was in 1769 when James Watt's engineering at Glasgow led to a stable steam engine and, subsequently, the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was established in 1862 as the independent Glasgow Veterinary College, being subsumed into the University in 1949 and gaining independent Faculty status in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/faculties/vet/aboutus/|title=About the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine|publisher=University of Glasgow}}</ref> The Faculty of Education was formed when the University merged with St Andrew's College of Education in 1999.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12017160.A_degree_of_concern_over_college_merger/ |title=A degree of concern over college merger |first=Elizabeth |last=Buie |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=6 April 1999 |accessdate=13 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Corporate Biography of St Andrew's College of Education|url=http://www.gashe.ac.uk/public_docs/isaar/C0738.html|publisher=Gateway to Archives of Scottish Higher Education|date=28 March 2000|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref>

On 1 August 2010, the former faculties of the university were removed and replaced by a system of four larger Colleges, intended to encourage interdisciplinary research and make the university more competitive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Challenge for university as Glasgow slims down to step up|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/challenge-for-university-as-glasgow-slims-down-to-step-up-1.924863|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|date=9 October 2009|accessdate=27 October 2009}}</ref> This structure was similar to that at other universities, including the [[University of Edinburgh#Colleges and schools|University of Edinburgh]].

In the 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] (RAE), almost 70% of research carried out at the university was in the top two categories (88% in the top three categories). Eighteen subject areas were rated top ten in the UK, whilst fourteen subject areas were rated the best in Scotland. The 2008 Times RAE table ranks according to an 'average' score across all departments, of which Glasgow posted an average of 2.6/4. The overall average placed Glasgow as the thirty-third-highest of all UK universities, perhaps reflecting the broadness of the university's activities.

[[File:Glasgow university with sno.jpg|thumb|right|The main campus, from University Avenue]]
The University of Glasgow was the first university in Europe to divest from [[Fossil fuel divestment|fossil fuel companies]] in October 2014. The 12-month campaign was led by the Glasgow University Climate Action Society and involved over 1,300 students.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/17/climate-change-make-big-polluters-pay-fossil-fuel-industries Climate change: how to make the big polluters really pay] [[Naomi Klein]] The Guardian 17 October 2014</ref>

==Student life==
Unlike other universities in Scotland, Glasgow does not have a single students' association; instead, there exist a number of bodies concerned with the representation, welfare, and entertainment of its students. Due to the university's retention of its separate male and female students' unions, which since 1980 have admitted both sexes as full members, there are two independent students' unions, as well as a sports association and the students' representative council. None of these are affiliated to the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]]: membership has been rejected on a number of occasions, most recently in November 2006, on both economic and political grounds. A student-run "No to NUS" campaign won a campuswide referendum with more than 90% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glasgowstudent.net/files/nus_motion_111006.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – Glasgow University SRC Council Motion.doc |accessdate=22 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092723/http://www.glasgowstudent.net/files/nus_motion_111006.pdf |archive-date=28 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In common with the other [[ancient universities of Scotland]], students at Glasgow also elect a [[University of Glasgow#Rector|Rector]].

The university has an eclectic body of clubs and societies, including sports teams, political and religious groups, and [[role-playing game|gaming]] societies.

===Students' Representative Council===
[[Glasgow University Students' Representative Council]] is the legal representative body for students, as recognised by the [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1889]]. The SRC is responsible for representing students' interests to the management of the university, to [[Local government in Scotland|local]] and [[UK Government|national]] government, and for health and welfare issues. Under the Universities (Scotland) Acts, all students of the university automatically become members of the SRC; however, they are entitled to opt out of this. Members of the SRC sit on various committees throughout the university, from departmental level to the Senate and Court.

The SRC organises Media Week, RAG (Raising And Giving) Week and Welfare Week, as well as funding some 130 [[Student society|clubs and societies]].

===Unions===

In addition to the Students' Representative Council, students are commonly members of one of the university's two [[students' union]]s, the Glasgow University Union (GUU) and the Queen Margaret Union (QMU).<ref>[http://www.gla.ac.uk/publications/factsandfigures/studentorganisations.html University of Glasgow – Facts and Figures 2005 – Student organisations and activities]. Retrieved 22 April 2006  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312212400/http://www.gla.ac.uk/publications/factsandfigures/studentorganisations.html |date=12 March 2007 }}</ref> Unlike many other student unions in the UK, membership to either GUU or QMU is not automatic and students must apply, for free, to become a member of either. Students are also permitted to be a member of both. These are largely social and cultural institutions, providing their members with facilities for debating, dining, recreation, socialising, and drinking, and both have a number of meeting rooms available for rental to members. Postgraduate students, mature students and staff were previously able to join the [[Free Hetherington|Hetherington Research Club]];<ref>[http://researchclub.gla.ac.uk Hetherington Research Club] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422231636/http://researchclub.gla.ac.uk/ |date=22 April 2006 }}.

Attempts to evict this occupation resulted in complaints of heavy-handed policing and much controversy on campus.<ref>{{cite news|title=Glasgow University eviction of students 'heavy handed'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12819114|accessdate=31 March 2011|work=BBC News|date=22 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-14866868 |title=Inquiry condemns Glasgow University sit-in eviction |work=BBC News |date=10 September 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2014}}</ref>

The separate unions exist due to the university's previous male-only status; the GUU was founded before the admission of women, while the QMU was originally the union of [[Queen Margaret College (Glasgow)|Queen Margaret College]], a women-only college which merged with the university in 1892. Their continued separate existence is due largely to their individual atmospheres. The GUU's focus is mainly towards people involved in sports and debates (as among its founders were the [[Glasgow University Sports Association|Athletic Association]] and [[Glasgow University Dialectic Society|Dialectic Society]]), the QMU is one of Glasgow's music venues, and has played host to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers (band)|Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Biffy Clyro]] and [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]].

In 1955, the GUU won the [[John Smith Memorial Mace|Observer Mace]], now the [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] Memorial Mace, named after the deceased GUU debater and former leader of the British Labour Party. The GUU has since won the mace debating championship fourteen more times, more than any other university. The GUU has also won the [[World Universities Debating Championships]] five times, more than any other university or club in the series' history.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://flynn.debating.net/wudcfin.htm | title = World Debate Website | accessdate = 22 October 2008 | last = Flynn | first = Colm | year = 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120731131540/http://flynn.debating.net/wudcfin.htm | archive-date = 31 July 2012 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

===Sports association===
Sporting affairs are regulated by the [[Glasgow University Sports Association]] (GUSA) (previously the Glasgow University Athletics Club) which works closely with the Sport and Recreation Service. There are a large number of varied clubs, including Squash, Gaelic Football, Basketball, Cycling, Football, Hockey, Netball, Martial Arts and [[Glasgow University Boat Club|Rowing]], who regularly compete in BUCS competitions. Students who join one of the sports clubs affiliated with the university must also join GUSA. However, there are also regular classes and drop-in sessions for various sports which are non-competitive and available to all university gym members.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

===Mature Students' Association===
The community of [[mature student]]s—that is those students aged 21 or over—are served by the Mature Students' Association located at 62 Oakfield Avenue. The MSA aims are to provide all mature students with facilities for recreation and study. Throughout the year, the MSA also organises social events and peer support for the wide range of subjects studied by the university's mature students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/maturestudentsassociation |title=Glasgow University – Mature Student Association |publisher=Gla.ac.uk |accessdate=22 January 2011}}</ref>

===Media===
There is an active student media scene at the university, part of, but editorially independent from, the SRC. There is a newspaper, the ''[[Glasgow University Guardian]]''; ''[[Glasgow University Magazine]]''; [[Glasgow University Student Television]]; and [[Subcity Radio]]. In recent years, independent of the SRC, the Queen Margaret Union has published a fortnightly magazine, ''[[Queen Margaret Union#Publications|qmunicate]]'',<ref>[http://www.qmu.org.uk/category/qmunicate QMU.org.uk – Qmunicate]. Retrieved 22 April 2006.</ref> and Glasgow University Union has produced the ''G-you'' magazine, formerly known as GUUi.<ref>[http://www.guu.co.uk/index.php?W21ID=170&SK=a469d5186aa3ca7de65bcdb0843760f6 Glasgow University Union website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313093052/http://www.guu.co.uk/index.php?W21ID=170&SK=a469d5186aa3ca7de65bcdb0843760f6 |date=13 March 2007 }}.
