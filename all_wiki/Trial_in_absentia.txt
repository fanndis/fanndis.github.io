'''Trial in absentia''' is a criminal proceeding in a court of law in which the person who is subject to it is not physically present at those proceedings. {{lang|la|In absentia}} is [[Latin]] for "in (the) absence". Its meaning varies by jurisdiction and legal system.

In [[common law]] legal systems, the phrase is more than a spatial description. In these systems it suggests a recognition of a violation to a defendant's right to be present in court proceedings in a criminal trial.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Conviction in a trial in which a defendant is not present to answer the charges is held to be a violation of natural justice.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Primus |first1=Eve Brensike |last2=Jerold Israel |first2=Jerold |last3=King |first3=Nancy J. |last4=Kerr |first4=Orin |last5=LaFave |first5=Wayne R |last6=Kamisar |first6=Yale |title=Modern Criminal Procedure, Cases, Comments, and Questions |date=May 25, 2015 |publisher=West Academic Publishing |isbn=978-1634595315 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hWWX9KAPo7AC&q=Conviction+in+a+trial+in+which+a+defendant+is+not+present+to+answer+the+charges+is+held+to+be+a+violation+of+natural+justice.&pg=PT490 |access-date=7 June 2017}}</ref> Specifically, it violates the second [[principles of natural justice|principle of natural justice]], {{lang|la|[[audi alteram partem]]}} (hear the other party).

[[File:Council of Europe (blue).svg|right|thumb|Signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights]]
[[Member states of the Council of Europe]] that are party to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] are bound to adhere to [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 6]] of the convention, which protects the right to a fair trial.

Trials in absentia are banned in some member states of the EU and permitted in others, posing significant problems for the fluidity of mutual recognition of these judicial judgments. The executing member state possesses some degree of discretion and is not obliged to execute a [[European Arrest Warrant]] if the country that is making the request has already tried that person in absentia.

Conditions under which trials in absentia must be recognised include: if the person can be said to have been aware of the trial; if a counsellor took their place at the trial; if they do not request an appeal in due time; and if they are to be offered an appeal.
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openeurope.org.uk/Content/documents/Pdfs/tia.pdf |title=Briefing note: EU strengthens trials in absentia – Framework Decision could lead to miscarriages of justice |access-date=2014-07-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905121759/http://www.openeurope.org.uk/Content/Documents/PDFs/tia.pdf |archive-date=2012-09-05 |website=[[Open Europe]]}}</ref>

The framework decision on the [[European Arrest Warrant]] provides for the legal guarantees relevant to trials in absentia. While the framework decision explicitly refers to [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]], its purpose is not to harmonise national laws on trials in absentia but to provide terms for the non-recognition of a European Arrest Warrant and other cooperative tools. The framework decision provides detailed conditions and requirements on which a trial in absentia can be considered compatible with Article 6, the [[right to a fair trial]].<ref>{{cite  web|url=http://www.law.unc.edu/documents/faculty/adversaryconference/profboesepaper.pdf |title=Harmonizing procedural rights indirectly: The Framework Decision on trials in absentia |first=Martin |last=Bose |website=Law.unc.edu |access-date=2016-09-18}}</ref>

According to Pieter Cleppe of the think-tank [[Open Europe]], in parts of Europe, in absentia trials essentially give defendants the ability to appeal twice—asking for a retrial at which they would be present and then potentially appealing the second verdict.

{{quote|There are some guarantees in the legal system that make sure that it's fair, that the rights of the defense are not being violated, while still making sure that justice is being done.

[[The Council of Europe]] has made commentary on judgments that are made in absentia. The [[Committee of Ministers]], in Resolution (75) 11, of 21 May 1975, stated that an individual must first be effectively served with a summons prior to being tried.  In this sense, the ministers are emphasizing that it is not the presence of the accused at the hearing that is of importance, rather the focus should be on whether or not the individual was informed of the trial in time.

In a 1985 judgement in the case ''Colozza v Italy'', the [[European Court of Human Rights]] stressed that a person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to take part in the hearings. This entitlement is based on the right to a fair trial and the right to a defence, both of which are required by The convention (Articles 6(1) and 6(3)). Furthermore, the court stressed that a person convicted in absentia shall be entitled to a fresh trial once he becomes aware of the proceedings:<ref>{{Citation

=== Belgium ===
The [[Human Rights Committee]] (HRC) examined ''[[Monguya Mbenge v. Zaire]]'' (1990) in which the applicant was sentenced to death while exiled in Belgium and was only able to learn of the case against him through the media. Due to these circumstances, the committee found that a number of the applicant's procedural rights had been violated, especially in consideration of the fact that the Zairean authorities had hardly attempted to contact the applicant despite possible knowledge of the applicant's address. This highly impeded the applicant's capacity to prepare any form of defense. Failed evidence to support the case that a court had tried to inform the accused of proceedings against him/her provides the committee with the opinion that the right to be tried in one's presence was violated.<ref>{{cite web |last=Goodman |first=Ryan |url=http://justsecurity.org/5839/trials-absentia/ |title=Trials in Absentia Under International, Domestic and Lebanese Law |publisher=Just Security |date=2014-01-18 |access-date=2016-09-07}}</ref>

In general, the Czech Criminal Procedural Code requires the presence of the defendant in any criminal proceedings. The code recognizes the following exemptions from this rule, when criminal proceedings may be conducted without the presence of the person charged:<ref>{{cite book |last=Císařová |first=Dagmar |title=Trestní právo procesní |trans-title=Criminal procedural law |publisher=Linde Praha a.s. |place=Prague |year=2006 |language=cs}}

* ''Where a defendant has died'' (involving the continuation or reopening of proceedings in order to clear a deceased defendant's name).
* ''Where a defendant is unknown:''
** This may arise before charges against a person are brought, normally in respect of pre-trial proceedings. For example, if police conclude that a crime has been committed and that action needs to be taken to identify the perpetrator, such as the interrogation of a witness or an identity parade, such an action is taken in the presence of a judge because the rights of the (still unidentified) criminal suspect cannot otherwise be adequately protected during the evidence gathering. Normally, a defendant enjoys the right to be present or represented by an attorney during the interrogation or identity parade. But where the defendant is not yet identified, in order to secure full legality and impartiality, a judge is present. This ensures the admissibility of the resulting evidence will not be successfully challenged during the trial. Typically, this situation might involve a dying witness, not expected to be available later for cross-examination at a trial by or on behalf of the defendant.<ref>{{cite book |last=Šámal |first=Pavel |title=Trestní řád I., II., III. |trans-title=Criminal Procedure Code I., II., III. |publisher = C.

** When confiscating property involved in criminal case from an unknown owner, the property confiscated will remain the property of the unknown owner pending a trial and a court decision to transfer the property confiscated to the state.  An example could arise where the property to be confiscated might endanger people, property or society, or might be used for commission of a felony. Typically, this concerns prohibited weapons or ammunition, explosives, narcotics, poisons, etc., seized by the police without, at the time of the seizure, knowing the owner's identity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Šámal |first=Pavel |title=Trestní zákoník |trans-title=Criminal Code |publisher=C.

===Italy===
[[Italy]] is one of several countries in Europe that allow trials in absentia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/uploads/documents/prisoners/Trials_in_absentia.pdf |title=General Information |website= Prisoners Abroad |access-date=2016-09-07}}</ref> and they are a regular occurrence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/v4i1/schwar41.htm |title=Trials in Absentia |website=Washington College of Law |publisher=American University |access-date=2016-09-07}}</ref>

In ''Maleki v Italy'' (1997), the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] held that the Italian policy on trials in absentia was a breach of the right to fair trial under Article 14 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. Italy argued that where a defendant in absentia is represented by court-appointed counsel and where he or she has an opportunity to be re-tried, the right to a fair trial will not be violated. The committee disagreed, describing Italy's position as:

{{quote|clearly insufficient to lift the burden placed on the State party if it is to justify trying an accused in absentia. It was incumbent on the court that tried the case to verify that [Maleki] had been informed of the pending case before proceeding to hold the trial in absentia. Failing evidence that the court did so, the [HRC] is of the opinion that [Maleki's] right to be tried in his presence was violated.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2176&context=ilj&sei-redir=1&referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.it%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dcriminal%2520law%2520italy%2520trial%2520in%2520absentia%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D12%26ved%3D0CCUQFjABOAo%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fir.lawnet.fordham.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D2176%2526context%253Dilj%26ei%3D8T3OU7rfDOTW0QXR8oCACg%26usg%3DAFQjCNHGRUHPSKrmi9O5R5LvfMXK8KIIxA#search=%22criminal%20law%20italy%20trial%20absentia%22 |format=PDF |journal=[[Fordham International Law Journal]] |title=Notice Otherwise Given: Will in Absentia Trials at the Special Tribunal for Lebanon Violate Human Rights? |first=Chris |last=Jenks |volume=33 |date=2009 |access-date=2016-09-18}}

In 2009, a former [[CIA]] station chief and two other Americans were tried and convicted in absentia by a Milan appeals court for the abduction of Egyptian terror suspect Osama Hassan Mustafa Nasr. The decision meant that 26 Americans tried in absentia for the abduction were found guilty.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/italian-court-convicts-cia-trio-kidnap-article-1.1253324 |title=Italian court convicts CIA trio in kidnap |publisher=NY Daily News |access-date=2016-09-07}}</ref>

The trial of American [[Amanda Knox]] for the 2007 murder of British student [[Meredith Kercher]] highlighted the issue of Italy's willingness to try defendants in absentia. In 2013 Italy's highest court, the [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]], decided to annul Knox's appeal (alongside the co-accused, Italian Raffaele Sollecito), thus overturning their previous acquittals, declaring the acquittal as "full of deficiencies, contradictions and illogical conclusions".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/amanda-knox-no-show-new-trial-murder-begins-italy-f8C11294149 |title=Amanda Knox is a no-show as new trial for murder begins in Italy |work=NBC News |date=September 30, 2013 |first=Henry |last=Austin |access-date=2016-09-07}}</ref>

In the case of ''Goddi v.

Certain case law supports the notion that in some circumstances representation by counsel at the trial will not be enough to make an in absentia conviction conclusive enough for the establishment of [[probable cause]]. In ''Gallina v Fraser'', the appellant Vincenzo Gallina was convicted in absentia according to established Italian procedure for two robberies. The verdict in Gallina has been since interpreted to suggest that the presence of legal counsel alone is, in certain cases, insufficient to give an in absentia conviction that establishes probable cause.

== United States ==
For more than 100 years, courts in the United States have held that, according to the United States Constitution, a criminal defendant's right to appear in person at their trial, as a matter of [[due process]], is protected under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]], [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth]], and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]].

In 1884, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that

{{bquote|the legislature has deemed it essential to the protection of one whose life or liberty is involved in a prosecution for felony, that he shall be personally present at the trial, that is, at every stage of the trial when his substantial rights may be affected by the proceedings against him. If he be deprived of his life or liberty without being so present, such deprivation would be without that due process of law required by the Constitution.

''[[Hopt v. Utah]]'' 110 US 574, 28 L Ed 262, 4 S Ct 202 (1884).}}

A similar holding was announced by the [[Arizona Court of Appeals]] in 2004 (based on Arizona Rules of Criminal Procedure):

{{bquote|A voluntary waiver of the right to be present requires true freedom of choice. A trial court may infer that a defendant's absence from trial is voluntary and constitutes a waiver if a defendant had personal knowledge of the time of the proceeding, the right to be present, and had received a warning that the proceeding would take place in their absence if they failed to appear. The courts indulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver of fundamental constitutional rights.

''[[State v. Whitley]]'', 85 P.3d 116 (2004) (Depublished Opinion).}}

Although [[United States Congress]] codified this right by approving Rule 43 of the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] in 1946 and amended the Rule in 1973, the right is not absolute.

Rule 43 provides that a defendant shall be present

* at the arraignment,
* at the time of the plea,
* at every stage of the trial including the impaneling of the jury and the return of the verdict and
* at the imposition of sentence.

However, the following exceptions are included in the Rule:
* the defendant waives his or her right to be present if he or she voluntarily leaves the trial after it has commenced,
* if he or she persists in disruptive conduct after being warned that such conduct will cause him or her to be removed from the courtroom,
* a corporation need not be present, but may be represented by counsel,
* in prosecutions for misdemeanors, the court may permit arraignment, plea, trial, and imposition of sentence in the defendant's absence with his or her written consent, and
* the defendant need not be present at a conference or argument upon a question of law or at a reduction of sentence under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

Indeed, several U.S. Supreme Court decisions have recognized that a defendant may forfeit the right to be present at trial through [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Mumia Abu-Jamal|disruptive behavior]],<ref>''Illinois v. Allen'', 397 U.S. 337 (1970)</ref> or through his or her voluntary absence after trial has begun.<ref>''Taylor v. United States (1973)'', 414 U.S. 17 (1973)</ref>

In 1993, the Supreme Court revisited Rule 43 in the case of ''[[Crosby v. United States]]''.<ref>506 U.S. 255</ref> The Court unanimously held, in an opinion written by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], that Rule 43 does not permit the trial in absentia of a defendant who is absent at the beginning of trial.

<blockquote>This case requires us to decide whether Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 permits the trial in absentia of a defendant who absconds prior to trial and is absent at its beginning. We hold that it does not. ...The Rule declares explicitly: "The defendant shall be present...at every stage of the trial...''except as otherwise provided by this rule''{{-"}} (emphasis added). The list of situations in which the trial may proceed without the defendant is marked as exclusive not by the "expression of one" circumstance, but rather by the express use of a limiting phrase. In that respect the language and structure of the Rule could not be more clear.</blockquote>

However, the ''Crosby'' Court reiterated an 80-year-old precedent that
