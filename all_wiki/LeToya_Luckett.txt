==Music career==

===Early life and career===
Luckett was born on March 11, 1981, in [[Houston]], Texas. She grew up singing in her local Brentwood [[Baptist]] Church. She also took vocal lessons to become an opera singer. Her father, who was also a singer, was very proud of his daughter's vocal talents and tried to get her in the [[music business]]. Luckett is the older of two children. Luckett was given the chance to sing her first solo at the age of five. "The lady just gave me the mic one Sunday and I sang," she recalled.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmcMepDC5x8 |title=LeToya interview for E! Television series, Boulevard of Broken Dreams part referring to her first experience with a microphone|accessdate=May 3, 2007 |publisher=[[E!]] |date=January 28, 2007 }}</ref> Shortly thereafter, she joined the children's [[choir]] and began performing in plays at her elementary school. One day, she walked to her desk in class to find a girl sitting in her seat. Luckett asked her teacher to remove the girl (who turned out to be [[Beyoncé Knowles]]) from her assigned seat. They later became friends and she was invited to join Beyoncé's singing group Girls Tyme, which later became Destiny's Child.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmcMepDC5x8 |title=LeToya interview for E! Television series, Boulevard of Broken Dreams |accessdate=May 3, 2007 |publisher=[[E!]] |date=January 28, 2007 }}</ref>

===1993–2000: Destiny's Child and departure===
{{Main|Destiny's Child}}
In 1993, LeToya Luckett joined Knowles, [[LaTavia Roberson]], and [[Kelly Rowland]] to complete the Houston-based R&B group, [[Destiny's Child]]. The roles of the group consisted with Knowles as lead vocalist, Rowland as second-lead vocalist plus alongside Roberson and Luckett as [[background vocalists]] with Roberson as [[alto]] (and spokesperson) adding the low notes and Luckett as the [[soprano]] adding the high notes to the group's harmony,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.idolator.com/7503986/why-beyonce-shades-kelly-rowland-destinys-child-interview |title=LeToya Luckett Talks Beyonce's Cough in That Old Destiny's Child Interview |accessdate=December 3, 2016 |date=January 31, 2014}}</ref> however occasional leads too. After being signed and later dropped by [[Elektra Records]], the group eventually signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1997, but not before signing with [[Mathew Knowles]] the group's manager (and also Beyoncé Knowles' father). According to the E!&nbsp;Television Special, ''Boulevard of Broken Dreams'', Knowles forced the girls to sign with him before they could sign with the label. Luckett's mother requested the contracts be reviewed by an attorney, but Knowles denied the request. However, Luckett eventually signed with him and joined the group.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmcMepDC5x8 |title=LeToya interview for E! Television series, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, part referring to the Pam Luckett reviewing contracts|accessdate=May 3, 2007 |publisher=[[E!]] |date=January 28, 2007 }}</ref> After graduating from the Houston club scene, the group opened for established acts such as [[Dru Hill]], [[SWV]], and [[IMx|Immature]], and released their 1998 self-titled debut album ''[[Destiny's Child (album)|Destiny's Child]]''. The album spawned two singles: the platinum "[[No, No, No (Destiny's Child song)|No, No, No Part II]]" (featuring [[Wyclef Jean]]) and "[[With Me (Destiny's Child song)|With Me]]". Subsequently, the group made it on the soundtrack album of the romantic comedy ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'' with the song "Get on the Bus" (featuring [[Timbaland]]), and later toured as an opening act on [[TLC (band)|TLC]]'s "Fanmail Tour" and [[Christina Aguilera]]'s debut tour.

In 1999, the group released their second album, ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]].'' The album became one of the biggest selling albums released by a female group, and was certified eight times platinum in the USA. As opposed to the first album, Luckett had more contribution to the second album in terms of co-writing. The album spawned four hit singles: "[[Bills, Bills, Bills]]", "[[Bug a Boo]]", "[[Say My Name]]", and "[[Jumpin' Jumpin']]". The two singles "Bills, Bills, Bills" and "Say My Name" were also nominated for [[Grammy awards]], which "Say My Name" won in two different categories. The album had also been released in a "Houston Special Edition" which included a bonus track where Luckett sung lead in alongside all other members entitled "Can't Help Myself".

In late 1999, in the midst of the group's success and rise, Luckett and Roberson asserted that they wanted their own manager because of the increasing lack of communication with manager Mathew Knowles. The pair said they never wanted to fire Knowles, but wanted to secure outside management to represent them. Soon after, Luckett and Roberson found themselves ostracized by the Knowles family and the group's management.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504044/20050613/story.jhtml |title=The Song Isn't Called 'Survivor' For Nothing |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=June 13, 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/d/destiny00/ |title=Where did it all go wrong? |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=September 22, 2000 }}</ref> When the music video for "Say My Name" debuted in February 2000, they were replaced by two new members, [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] and [[Farrah Franklin]]. Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé Knowles and Kelly Rowland, charging them with breach of partnership and [[fiduciary]] duties, and sought unspecified damages. Luckett and Roberson withdrew the case against Beyoncé and Kelly, but continued to sue Mathew Knowles. The case was eventually settled, with Luckett and Roberson receiving [[royalties]] for their contributions as founding members of the group. Shortly following the release of Destiny's Child's ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'', Luckett and Roberson filed another lawsuit against the group in March 2002. They claimed that the album's lead single, "[[Survivor (Destiny's Child song)|Survivor]]", violated their previous settlement due to its lyrics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456291/20020725/destinys_child.jhtml |title=Destiny's Child Settle With Ex-Members Over 'Survivor' Dis |accessdate=April 20, 2007 |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=July 25, 2002 }}</ref>

===2001–2008: Solo debut, ''LeToya''===
After several months of media speculation, it was announced via the MTV News website that Luckett and Roberson had created a new group called Anjel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1441286/20010305/destinys_child.jhtml |title=Ex-Destiny's Child Members Say Their Name Is Angel |accessdate=April 20, 2007 |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=March 5, 2001 }}</ref> After several auditions, Naty Quinones and Tiffany Beaudoin were selected as members. The group recorded a 22-song demo in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, with the help of R&B group [[Jagged Edge (American group)|Jagged Edge]]. The group also appeared in Jagged Edge's video for "Where the Party At (Remix)". However, the production company (581 Entertainment) which handled the group collapsed and all the members of Anjel went on to pursue solo projects. Meanwhile, the recorded tracks were leaked onto the Internet.

After the Anjel project fell through, Luckett joined with Noontime, an Atlanta-based management/production company. Along with Noontime, she recorded a five-song demo and eventually signed with [[Capitol Records]] in 2003. Soon after, she began working on her debut solo album. The first promotional song, "[[You Got What I Need]]", was released in 2004, followed next year by "[[All Eyes on Me (LeToya song)|All Eyes on Me]]". She was featured on "My Promise" with her label mate [[Houston (singer)|Houston]] on his debut album ''[[It's Already Written]],'' "What Love Can Do" on the ''[[Coach Carter]]'' soundtrack, and on "This Is My Life" with former boyfriend and rapper [[Slim Thug]] on his album ''[[Already Platinum]].'' LeToya's [[LeToya (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in July 2006 and debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] charts. ''LeToya'' was certified gold after one month and by December 2006, the album had been certified platinum. Luckett and Beyoncé Knowles are the only members of Destiny's Child to have an album debut at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 and achieve platinum status in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1441286/20010305/destinys_child.jhtml |title=LeToya Rolls With Houston Hip-Hoppers |accessdate=April 20, 2007 |publisher=MTV |date=March 21, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1526753/20060321/simpson_ashlee.jhtml?headlines=true |title=For The Record: Quick News On |accessdate=April 20, 2007 |publisher=MTV |date=March 21, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_year_filter=2006&resultpage=&id=2A8441CD-99AD-EA6A-AFE4-8BBF80B165AE |title=News Room |accessdate=April 20, 2007 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=December 22, 2006 }}</ref>

The album is a hip-hop inspired R&B production. Producers included [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Scott Storch]], Teddy Bishop, [[Bryan Michael Cox|B. Cox]], and musical guests [[Slim Thug]], [[Mike Jones (rapper)|Mike Jones]], [[Paul Wall]], and [[Bun B]]. "[[All Eyes on Me (LeToya song)|All Eyes on Me]]" was originally chosen as Luckett's debut single, but  "[[Torn (LeToya Luckett song)|Torn]]" was ultimately selected instead. The ballad (produced by Teddy Bishop) was released in March 2006 and became an R&B hit. The song climbed the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts, peaking at number two on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]].

Although ''Torn'' was still receiving airplay, her second single, "[[She Don't]]" was released to radio, and the video premiered on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s ''Access Granted'' in July 2006, featuring Luckett's ex-boyfriend, Slim Thug. The single received moderate success, reaching number 17 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. In November 2006, "[[Obvious (LeToya song)|Obvious]]" was selected as the third single. According to ''Billboard'', the song had a 94% chance of becoming a hit, but due to the merger of [[Capitol Records]] and [[Virgin Records]], all promotional money was frozen, therefore the single was never officially released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hitsdailydouble.com/news/newsPage.cgi?news06487m01 |title=Capitol Music Group Formed  |accessdate=July 4, 2007 |work=hitsdailydouble |date=January 25, 2007 }}</ref> Luckett was also named "One of the Best New Artists of 2006" by AOL Music, number two on ''Rap-Up'' magazines' Top 5 Breakthrough Artists of 2006, and received multiple nominations from the [[NAACP]], the Soul Train Music Awards, and the [[Teen Choice Awards]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
BET promoted Luckett on ''106 & Park,'' ''The Center,'' ''The Black Carpet,'' and with a three-part reality series special called ''The H-Town Chick'' which aired from May to July 2006. The series chronicled Luckett's experiences during her summer promotional tour and insight about her life since Destiny's Child. BET also hosted a contest that gave fans the opportunity to decide the final outcome of the "Torn" video. [[Cingular]] hosted a lip-sync contest that awarded those who best performed "Torn" in an online submitted video.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allaccess.com |title=AllAccess |accessdate=June 7, 2007 |work=[[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] |date=June 30, 2006 }}</ref> In addition to a nationwide radio tour, club performances, a brief European and Asian appearances, Luckett participated in the 2006 "[[Pantene]] Total You" Tour, the "Cingular Live in Concert" series, and was invited by [[Mary J.
