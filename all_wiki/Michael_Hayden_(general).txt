He was Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) from 1999 to 2005. During his tenure as director, he oversaw the controversial NSA surveillance of technological communications between persons in the United States and alleged foreign [[Terrorism|terrorist]] groups, which resulted in the [[NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)|NSA warrantless surveillance controversy]].

On April 21, 2005, then Lt. Gen Hayden, was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] as the first Principal Deputy [[Director of National Intelligence]] and awarded his fourth star-making him "the highest-ranking military intelligence officer in the armed forces".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=5746 |title=Biographies : GENERAL MICHAEL V.

His nomination was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on 26 May by a vote of 78–15. On May 30, 2006, and again the following day at the CIA lobby with President [[George W. Bush]] in attendance, Hayden was sworn in as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

On July 1, 2008, Hayden retired from the Air Force after over 41 years of service, and continued to serve as Director of the CIA until February 12, 2009.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/cia-director-hayden-announces-airforce-retirement.html Hayden announces his retirement from the Air Force] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513234355/https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/cia-director-hayden-announces-airforce-retirement.html |date=May 13, 2008}}, April 23, 2008.</ref> He received an honorary doctorate from [[The Institute of World Politics]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 2009.

Hayden is a Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[George Mason University]]'s [[Schar School of Policy and Government]]. He is also a founder of the [[Michael V. Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy, and International Security]] at the [[Schar School of Policy and Government]] at George Mason University.

==Early life and education==
Michael Vincent Hayden was born on March 17, 1945, in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], to an Irish-American couple, Sadie (Murray) and Harry V. Hayden Jr.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/triblive-pittsburgh-tribune-review/obituary.aspx?pid=177051027 |title=Harry V. Hayden Jr. |work=Pittsburgh Tribune Review}}</ref> who worked as a welder for a Pennsylvania manufacturing company. He has a sister, Debby, and a brother, Harry.

Hayden attended to St. Peter's Elementary School where, in 7th and 8th grade he played quarterback on the school football team then being coached by the late [[Dan Rooney]], the son of the founder of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and former Chairman of the team. Hayden graduated from [[Cardinal Wuerl North Catholic High School|North Catholic High School]]. One of his first jobs was as an equipment manager for the Steelers.<ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/02/AR2008110202621.html?sid=ST2008110202670&s_pos= |title=Mike Wise – Mike Wise: The Spy Who Loved Rooney |work=The Washington Post |date=November 3, 2008 |access-date=March 6, 2012}}</ref> He went on to [[Duquesne University]] in Pittsburgh where he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in history in 1967 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He then attended graduate school at Duquesne for a [[Master's degree]] in modern [[History of the United States|American history]]. He continues to be an avid fan of the hometown Pittsburgh Steelers, since the 1990s traveling with his wife and family to at least three or four games a year.<ref name="washingtonpost.com" />

Hayden was commissioned through [[Duquesne University]]'s [[Air Force Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] program.<ref name="Corps Distinguished Alumni Induction 2011, page 5">Ceremony program, Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps Distinguished Alumni Induction, Maxwell AFB, Alabama, July 26, 2011, page 5.</ref> Hayden entered active military service in 1969.

==Intelligence career==
Hayden has served as commander of the [[Air Intelligence Agency]] and Director of the Joint Command and Control Warfare Center, both headquartered at [[Lackland Air Force Base]]. He also has served in senior staff positions in the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]; Headquarters [[U.S. European Command]], [[Stuttgart]], Germany; the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Embassy in the then-People's Republic of [[Bulgaria]]. Prior to becoming Director of the National Security Agency, the general served as deputy chief of staff for [[United Nations Command]] and [[U.S. Forces Korea]], [[Yongsan Garrison]]. He has also worked in intelligence in [[Guam]].

===Air Intelligence Agency===
From 1996 to 1997, Hayden served as Commander of the [[Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency|AIA]], an agency of 16,000 charged with defending and exploiting the "information domain."<ref>{{cite web |date=July 1997 |work=Popular Science |title=Information Warriors of the 609th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXx0OlBtGEEC&pg=PA71 |pages=71–74; here: p. 74 |last=O'Malley |first=Chris}}</ref>

===National Security Agency===
Hayden served as the Director of the National Security Agency and Chief of the [[Central Security Service]] at [[Fort George G. Meade]], [[Maryland]] from March 1999 to April 2005. As the Director of NSA and Chief of CSS, he was responsible for a combat support agency of the Department of Defense with military and civilian personnel stationed worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/06/AR2006050601069.html |title=Hayden Faces Senate and CIA Hurdles If Named |date=May 7, 2006 |first1=Thomas E. |last1=Ricks |first2=Dafna |last2= Linz |work=Washington Post|access-date=March 12, 2017}}</ref>

====Strategy for the NSA====
Hayden came to the NSA at a time of great trouble in the agency. Internal government analysis indicated it suffered from a lack of quality management and an outdated [[IT infrastructure]]. In fact soon after he came on board, a huge part of the NSA network system crashed and was down for several days. Part of his plan to revitalize the agency was to introduce more outside contractors, induce a lot of old managers to retire and get rid of old management structures. Part of his plan also included increased openness at the agency; it had historically been one of the most secretive organs of government. He notably allowed [[James Bamford]] access for his book ''[[Body of Secrets]]''.<ref name=bos>James Bamford, ''[[Body of Secrets]]'', Doubleday, 2001</ref> Hayden was also initially extremely concerned with following the laws against domestic surveillance. Many reports say that after 9/11, he became more concerned with stopping terrorism, and allegedly softened his stance against domestic surveillance.<ref name=bos /><ref name=senintel /><ref name=effclassa /><ref name=globsec /> Hayden however has said that he believed everything the agency was doing was "effective, appropriate, and lawful".<ref name=mayer2011 />

On 9/11, Hayden immediately evacuated all non-essential personnel from NSA headquarters. After 9/11, the agency greatly increased its activity. Details about its operations have been largely hidden, but it played a major role in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the [[War on Terror]]. One notable example is its relationship with the [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] 'drone' program.<ref>James Bamford, ''[[The Shadow Factory]]'', 2008, Doubleday</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

====Wiretaps of domestic communication====
In May 2006, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that, under Hayden's leadership, the NSA created a [[NSA call database|domestic telephone call database]]. During his nomination hearings, Hayden defended his actions to Senator [[Russ Feingold]] and others, stating that he had relied upon legal advice from the [[White House]] that building the database was supported by [[Article Two of the United States Constitution]] executive branch powers (in which the President must "take care that the laws be faithfully executed"), overriding legislative branch statutes forbidding [[warrantless wiretapping|warrantless surveillance]] of domestic calls, which included the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA). Previously, this action would have required a warrant from a FISA court. The stated purpose of the database was to eavesdrop on international communications between persons within the U.S. and individuals and groups overseas in order to locate terrorists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/2006/intell-060123-dni01.htm|title=Remarks By General Michael V. Hayden: What American Intelligence & Especially The NSA Have Been Doing To Defend The Nation|author=John Pike}}</ref>

====Trailblazer====
Hayden also championed the [[Trailblazer Project]], a "transformation" project with a large information technology component. The project was criticized by several NSA staffers for not including privacy protections for United States citizens and for being a waste of money. The critics included Diane S Roark, of the [[House Intelligence Committee]], NSA workers [[Thomas Andrews Drake]], [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], J. Kirk Wiebe, and Loomis, and others. Hayden severely rebuked these critics. Several quit in protest. After investigations by the NSA inspector general, the DOD inspector general, and Congress, Trailblazer was shut down.<ref name=mayer2011 />

===Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence===
[[File:Hayden DepDir NatInt.jpg|thumb|right|Hayden is sworn in as Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence]]
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
As part of the [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act]] of 2004, the CIA chief no longer would run the intelligence community. Instead a new office was created for this purpose; the [[Director of National Intelligence]]. General Hayden became the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence from May 2005 to May 2006 under the first DNI, [[John Negroponte]].

===Civil liberties===
On January 23, 2006, Hayden participated in a news conference.<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/01/24/1516258 Democracy Now! coverage of the January 23 National Press Club meeting.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511072513/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F01%2F24%2F1516258 |date=May 11, 2006 }}, September 7, 2010</ref> A YouTube video<ref>{{YouTube|cGhcECnWRGM|''Michael Hayden: "probable cause" is not in the 4th Amendment''}}, September 7, 2010</ref> was posted of Michael Hayden telling reporters at a press conference that "probable cause" is not required for all searches or seizures under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], claiming instead that the standard is whether the search or seizure is reasonable. "Probable cause" is required for all warrants whether or not the search or seizure is deemed to be "unreasonable."

[[File:Hayden cia nomination.jpg|thumb|left|[[George W. Bush]] announces his nomination of Hayden as the next Director of the CIA as Director of National Intelligence [[John Negroponte]] looks on.]]

Hayden referred to people who believed that [[torture]] of CIA detainees has never yielded useful intelligence as "interrogation deniers".<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303745304576359820767777538 Birthers, Truthers and Interrogation Deniers], Michael Hayden, June 2011, Wall Street Journal</ref>

===Director of the Central Intelligence Agency===
[[File:Michael Hayden by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Michael Hayden speaking at the 2015 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland on February 27, 2015.]]
On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated by President George W. Bush to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency after the resignation of [[Porter J. Goss]] on May 5, 2006.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4750357.stm Hayden named as Bush CIA choice] May 8, 2006</ref> He was later confirmed on May 26, 2006, as Director, 78–15, by full [[U.S. Senate]] vote.<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&vote=00160 U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home > Votes > Roll Call Vote] May 26, 2006</ref>

Critics of the nomination and Hayden's attempts to increase domestic surveillance included Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] who stated on May 11, 2006, that "I happen to believe we are on our way to a major constitutional confrontation on Fourth Amendment guarantees of unreasonable search and seizure".<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/11/nsa.phonerecords/index.html Bush says U.S. not 'trolling through personal lives'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615052647/http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/11/nsa.phonerecords/index.html |date=June 15, 2006 }}, CNN, May 12, 2006</ref>

Hayden has been accused of lying to [[United States Congress|Congress]] during his 2007 testimony about the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation program.<ref>"[http://time.com/3628324/torture-congress-lying-hayden/ What Happens When You Lie To Congress?]" ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.

''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''. December 10, 2014.</ref>

In 2007, Hayden lobbied to allow the CIA to conduct drone strikes purely on the behavior of ground vehicles, with no further evidence of connection to terrorism.<ref>Porter, Gareth. [http://www.ipsnews.net/2011/09/cias-push-for-drone-war-driven-by-internal-needs/ "CIA's Push for Drone War Driven by Internal Needs."] IPS, September 5, 2011.</ref>

In 2008 Hayden warned of the destabilizing consequences of [[Muslim]] migration to Europe that might raise the possibility of [[civil unrest]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Joby Warrick|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/30/AR2008043003258.html?nav=rss_world|title=CIA Chief Sees Unrest Rising With Population|work=The Washington Post|date=April 30, 2008}}</ref>

In 2013, after the [[P5+1]] reached a [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|nuclear agreement]] with Iran, Hayden said, "We have accepted Iranian uranium enrichment."<ref>{{cite news|last=Seher|first=Jason|title=Former CIA head: U.S. has 'accepted Iranian uranium enrichment' |publisher=CNN |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/01/former-cia-head-u-s-has-accepted-iranian-uranium-enrichment/?hpt=po_c2|access-date=December 2, 2013}}</ref>

The 2014 [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture]] cited an email prepared by a subordinate that indicated that as CIA Director, Hayden instructed that out-of-date information be used in briefing Congress so that fewer than 100 Guantanamo Bay detainees would be reported.<ref name="New York Times2014">{{cite web|last=Ashkenas|first=Jeremy|date=December 9, 2014|title=7 Key Points From the C.I.A.

==NSA spying scandal==
{{See also|Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)}}
In September 2013, Hayden stressed the indisputable legality of "what the NSA is doing" and called [[Edward Snowden]] a "troubled young man" and "morally arrogant to a tremendous degree"; he also said about his prospects in Russia: "I suspect he will end up like most of the rest of the defectors who went to the old Soviet Union: Isolated, bored, lonely, depressed—and most of them ended up alcoholics."<ref name="snowdenalcoholic">{{cite web|last=Peterson|first=Andrea|title=Former NSA chief: 'Morally arrogant' Snowden will probably become an alcoholic|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/09/17/former-nsa-chief-morally-arrogant-snowden-will-probably-become-an-alcoholic/?tid=btm_rex_1|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=September 18, 2013}}</ref>
