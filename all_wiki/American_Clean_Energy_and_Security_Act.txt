The '''American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009''' ('''ACES''') was an [[energy]] bill in the [[111th United States Congress]] ({{USBill|111|H.R.|2454}}) that would have established a variant of an [[emissions trading]] plan similar to the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]]. The bill was approved by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on June 26, 2009 by a vote of 219-212, but was never brought to the floor of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] for discussion or a vote.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Kate Sheppard |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/03/waxman-markey-senate-climate-kerry-graham-lieberman |title=Was Waxman-Markey A Waste of Energy? |magazine=Mother Jones |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2016-09-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Walsh |first=Bryan |url=http://science.time.com/2010/07/26/why-the-climate-bill-died/ |title=Why the Climate Bill Died &#124; TIME.com |journal=Time |publisher=Science.time.com |date=2010-07-26 |accessdate=2016-09-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Republican reversal conservatives and the environment from Nixon to Trump|last1=Turner|first1=James Morton|last2=Isenberg|first2=Andrew C.|date=2018|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674979970|pages=180–185|oclc=1035623224}}</ref>          
 
The House passage of the bill was the "first time either house of Congress had approved a bill meant to curb the heat-trapping gases scientists have linked to climate change."<ref name=nyt/>

The bill was also known as the '''Waxman-Markey Bill''', after its authors, Representatives [[Henry Waxman|Henry A. Waxman]] of [[California]] and [[Ed Markey|Edward J. Markey]] of [[Massachusetts]], both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Waxman was at the time the chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Energy and Commerce Committee]], and Markey was the chairman of that committee's [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power|Energy and Power Subcommittee]].

==Summary of provisions==
The bill proposed a [[cap and trade]] system, under which the government would set a limit (cap) on the total amount of [[greenhouse gas]]es that can be emitted nationally. Companies then buy or sell (trade) permits to emit these gases, primarily [[carbon dioxide]] {{CO2}}. The cap is reduced over time to reduce total carbon emissions. The legislation would set a cap on total emissions over the 2012–2050 period and would require regulated entities to hold rights, or allowances, to emit greenhouse gases. After allowances were initially distributed, entities would be free to buy and sell them (the trade part of the program). Those entities that emit more gases face a higher cost, which provides an economic incentive to reduce emissions. Key elements of the bill include:<ref>[http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?q=bill/hr-2454-the-the-american-clean-energy-and-security-act]</ref>

*Requires electric utilities to meet 20% of their electricity demand through renewable energy sources and energy efficiency by 2020.
*Subsidizes new clean energy technologies and energy efficiency, including renewable energy ($90 billion in new subsidies by 2025), [[carbon capture and storage|carbon capture and sequestration]] ($60 billion), electric and other advanced technology vehicles ($20 billion), and basic scientific research and development ($20 billion).
*Protects consumers from energy price increases. According to estimates from the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], the reductions in carbon pollution required by the legislation will cost American families less than a postage stamp per day (about $13.20 a month, and $160.60 a year ). 
*It set the same target for reductions in emissions of [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], and other [[greenhouse gas]]es as that proposed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]. The bill required a 17-percent emissions reduction from 2005 levels by 2020; Obama had committed to a 17 percent reduction by 2020. Both plans would've reduce United States' emissions by about 83 percent by 2050. Complementary measures in the legislation, such as efforts to prevent [[tropical deforestation]], would have achieved significant additional reductions in carbon emissions.
*It included a [[renewable electricity standard]] (almost identical to a [[renewable portfolio standard]], but narrowly tailored to electrical energy) requiring each electricity provider who supplies over 4 million [[MWh]] to produce 20 percent of its [[electricity]] from [[Renewable resource|renewable sources]] (such as [[Wind power|wind]], [[Solar energy|solar]], and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]]) by 2020.  There is a provision whereby 5% of this standard can be met through [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] savings, as well as an additional 3% with certification of the [[Governor]] of the state in which the provider operates.

Alternative compliance payments were $25/MWh in violation of the standard, adjusted for inflation beginning in 2010.
*It provides for [[Smart grid|modernization]] of the [[electrical grid]]
*It provides for expanded production of [[electric vehicle]]s and other [[alternative fuel vehicle|advanced automobile technology]].
*It mandates significant increases in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in buildings, [[home appliance]]s, and [[electricity generation]].

The bill's cap-and-trade program allocates 85% of allowances to industry for free, auctioning the remainder.<ref name="ForbesStone">{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/24/climate-carbon-cap-and-trade-business-energy-carbon.html |title=A Winner In The New Climate Legislation |first=Andy |last=Stone |date=2009-06-24 |accessdate=2009-07-04 |work=[[Forbes]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627092306/http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/24/climate-carbon-cap-and-trade-business-energy-carbon.html |archive-date=27 June 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> The revenue from these allowances will be used to finance conservation of tropical forests abroad and to support low-income households.<ref name="RFFStevenson">[http://www.rff.org/wv/archive/2009/06/09/tropical-forest-conservation-in-waxman-markey.aspx "Tropical Forest Conservation in Waxman Markey"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822065501/http://www.rff.org/wv/archive/2009/06/09/tropical-forest-conservation-in-waxman-markey.aspx |date=2009-08-22 }}.

==Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis==
A study in June 2009 by the non-partisan [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) indicated that the bill would be roughly deficit-neutral for the government over the next decade:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/41189 |title=H.R. 2454, American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 &#124; Congressional Budget Office |publisher=Cbo.gov |date=2009-06-05 |accessdate=2016-09-14}}</ref>

{{quote|...enacting the legislation would increase revenues by $873 billion over the 2010-2019 period and would increase direct spending by $864 billion over that 10-year period. In total, CBO and JCT estimate that enacting the legislation would reduce future budget deficits by about $4 billion over the 2010-2014 period and by about $9 billion over the 2010-2019 period...}}

The study also indicated that the tax burden on individual households would be limited:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_111/20090620/cbowaxmanmarkey.pdf |title=CBO-Analysis of Waxman-Markey-June 2009 |access-date=2009-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920091154/http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_111/20090620/cbowaxmanmarkey.pdf |archive-date=2009-09-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

{{quote|...the net annual economy-wide cost of the cap-and-trade program in 2020 would be $22 billion—or about $175 per household...households in the lowest income quintile would see an average net benefit of about $40 in 2020, while households in the highest income quintile would see a net cost of $245. Added costs for households in the second lowest quintile would be about $40 that year; in the middle quintile, about $235; and in the fourth quintile, about $340. Overall net costs would average 0.2 percent of households' after-tax income.}}

The analysis did not attempt to quantify the environmental benefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The report also stated that the "net financial impact of the program on households in different income brackets would depend in large part on how many allowances were sold (versus given away), how the free allowances were allocated, and how any proceeds from selling allowances were used. That net impact would reflect both the added costs that households experienced because of higher prices and the share of the allowance value that they received in the form of benefit payments, rebates, tax decreases or credits, wages, and returns on their investments." In other words, while a cap and trade system imposes costs on high emitters, it can generate revenues for low emitters that sell permits to them. While the government sets the bar on emission levels, the market determines who gains and who loses.

The [[Republicans for Environmental Protection]] (REP), a national grassroots organization, issued a press release after the vote stating "House passage today of the American Clean Energy and Security Act is a step in the right direction in the fight against [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|dangerous climate change]] and for developing cleaner, more secure energy resources."<ref name="REP626">[http://www.rep.org/opinions/press_releases/release09-6-26.html Press Releases] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708164031/http://www.rep.org/opinions/press_releases/release09-6-26.html |date=2009-07-08 }}, [[Republicans for Environmental Protection]] (REP America)</ref>  David Jenkins, REP vice president for government and political affairs, noted that "Doing nothing is not an option.

Today, the House looked to the future and did the right thing for our economy, security, and environment."<ref name="REP626"/>

The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) estimated the discussion draft version of the bill to cost average households $98–$140 per year.  A preliminary update of this study says that the changes "would likely result in lower allowance prices, a smaller impact on energy bills, and a smaller impact on household consumption."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/05/19/19greenwire-revised-house-climate-bill-carries-smaller-pri-19116.html | title=Revised House climate bill carries smaller price tag, EPA report says | date=2009-05-19 | work=The New York Times| accessdate=2009-05-20 | first1=Darren | last1=Samuelsohn| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090523193805/http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/05/19/19greenwire-revised-house-climate-bill-carries-smaller-pri-19116.html| archive-date= 23 May 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] argued for the bill in September 2009, while attacking the bill's opponents: "It's important, then, to understand that claims of immense economic damage from climate legislation are as bogus, in their own way, as [[climate change denial]]. Saving the planet won't come free (although the early stages of conservation actually might). But it won't cost all that much either."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/opinion/25krugman.html?ref=todayspaper|title=Opinion - It's Easy Being Green|first=Paul|last=Krugman|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 September 2009}}</ref> During May 2009, he argued that a cap and trade system is better than a [[carbon tax]]. He explained how the incentives work

<blockquote>Even when polluters get free permits, they still have an incentive to reduce their emissions, so that they can sell their excess permits to someone else. That's not just theory: allowances for sulfur dioxide emissions are allocated to electric utilities free of charge, yet the cap-and-trade system for SO2 has been highly successful at controlling acid rain.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/18/opinion/18krugman.html|title=Opinion - The Perfect, the Good, the Planet|first=Paul|last=Krugman|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 May 2009}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Tia Nelson]] testified in support of the bill on April 24, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4533986/tia-nelson-supports-american-clean-energy-security-act-2009|title=Tia Nelson Supports American Clean Energy Security Act of 2009|website=C-SPAN.org}}</ref>

===Arguments against the bill===
Criticism has focused on ultimate costs and benefits of the plan.  A report written for the conservative think tank [[The Heritage Foundation]] on the discussion draft of the bill claims that the economy would react to this cap-and-trade system like it would lead to an energy crisis.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/EnergyandEnvironment/wm2438.cfm | title=The Economic Impacts of Waxman-Markey | date=2009-05-13 | publisher=The [[Heritage Foundation]] | accessdate=2009-05-14| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090513230033/http://www.heritage.org/Research/EnergyandEnvironment/wm2438.cfm| archive-date= 13 May 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> This same report also claimed that the impact on global temperature by the end of the 21st century would amount to a reduction of no more than 0.2° [[Celsius]].

====Equity issues====
Economist [[Arnold Kling]] said the bill "maximizes rent-seeking (favoritism toward particular businesses) and minimizes carbon reduction".<ref>[http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/06/the_obama_pattern.php The Obama Pattern], ''[[The Atlantic]]'', June 26, 2009.</ref> Other economists have argued that the bill will create significant financial costs. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' accused the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) of significantly underestimating the bill's ultimate costs, pointing out supposed flaws in its calculations. The ''Wall Street Journal'' also suggested that the bill's costs would disproportionately affect lower-income households, for which the CBO estimates did not account.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124588837560750781 The Cap and Tax Fiction], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', June 26, 2009.</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the bill's provisions to levy tariffs on Chinese imports due to carbon emissions could provoke a trade war.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2009/06/24/24climatewire-possible-plan-for-tariffs-on-imports-from-ch-25103.html Possible Plan for Tariffs on Imports From China Remains Alive in House Climate Bill], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 24, 2009.</ref> The [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] argued that the bill was essentially the "largest tax hike in world history".<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/seven/06252009/postopinion/opedcolumnists/trojan_hearse_175976.htm Trojan Hearse], ''[[The New York Post]]'', June 25, 2009.</ref> The [[American Petroleum Institute]], which represents the petroleum and natural gas industry, said the bill would place "disproportionate burden on all consumers of gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, jet fuel, propane and other petroleum products", and by 2035, it would cause gasoline prices in excess of $4.00 per gallon by today's standards.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110614230043/http://www.api.org/Newsroom/upload/Letter_to_Congress_6_23_09.pdf Letter to Congress], American Petroleum Institute, June 23, 2009.</ref>

====Nuclear power====
Nuclear power plants generate minimal greenhouse gases, yet one critic wrote that the bill does not sufficiently advocate this clean power source. In response to this criticism, House of Representatives staff members wrote that the electricity generated by nuclear power requires the purchase of far fewer allowances than other forms of electricity generation; that the bill provides various types of financial support to build clean energy generating sources, including nuclear; and that an EPA study indicated that twice as many nuclear plants would be built if the law is passed versus the status quo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-kirsch/waxman-markey-three-tough_b_215430.html|title=Waxman-Markey: Three Tough, Unanswered Questions|first=Steve|last=Kirsch|date=16 July 2009}}</ref>

====Other high emitting nations====
There is criticism that unless [[China]] and [[India]] adopt similar emissions standards, the impact on global climate will be insubstantial.  This is largely an argument based on the leading role these two countries have obtained in carbon dioxide emissions which could reach 34% of the global total by 2030.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/pdf/emissions.pdf|title=International Energy Outlook, Chapter 7|date=June 2008|publisher=Energy Information Administration|accessdate=2009-05-20| archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090427071944/http%3A//www%2Eeia%2Edoe%2Egov/oiaf/ieo/pdf/emissions%2Epdf| archive-date= April 27, 2009| url-status= live}}</ref>

====Doubts about a carbon market====
Critics also note that the bill would create the largest market in carbon in the world.  It would also "open up the so-called 'sub-prime carbon' market in [[carbon offset]]s, whereby industries can claim emissions reductions by investing in various projects around the world that theoretically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) claims it's virtually impossible to verify whether carbon offsets represent real emissions reductions.<ref>[http://www.ips-dc.org/articles/good_news_theres_a_climate_bill_bad_news_it_stinks Good News, There's a Climate Bill — Bad News, It Stinks], [http://www.ips-dc.org/ The Institute for Policy Studies], May 19, 2009</ref> "

====Non federal jurisdictions====
On June 26, 2009, [[Reuters]] reported that "[s]tates that have set the U.S. agenda on addressing greenhouse gas emissions are lining up behind a federal climate bill, fearing signs of dissent would weaken a plan that still faces hurdles"<ref name=gardner>{{cite news

While the [[Environmental Defense Fund]]<ref name="EDF9854"/> and many other environmental organizations strongly support the bill, other environmentalists have sharply criticized the legislation in its present form as too weak and have called urgently for it to be amended so as to include additional and more vigorous measures to protect climate and natural resources.

Some environmentalists have criticized the fuel efficiency standards in the "cash for clunkers" provision of the bill, because new cars would only need to get 22 MPG to be considered fuel efficient.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/congress-close-on-cash-for-clunkers/?hp | title=Congress Close on 'Cash for Clunkers' | work=The New York Times | date=May 6, 2009 | first=Ken | last=Belson | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://washingtonindependent.com/43628/dems-finally-stop-pretending-cash-for-clunkers-is-an-environmental-bill | title=Dems Finally Stop Pretending Cash-for-Clunkers Is an Environmental Bill | work=[[Washington Independent]] | date=May 19, 2009 | access-date=2009-06-01 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523221043/http://washingtonindependent.com/43628/dems-finally-stop-pretending-cash-for-clunkers-is-an-environmental-bill | archive-date=2009-05-23 | url-status=dead }}</ref> New SUVs and pickup trucks would only need to get 18 MPG to be considered fuel efficient.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE5515YB20090602?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews | title= Senate set to consider plan to boost auto sales | work=Reuters | date= June 2, 2009 | first=John | last=Crawley}}</ref> Vehicles older than 25 years are not eligible for the program.

''[[The New York Times]]'' has noted that "while some environmentalists enthusiastically supported the legislation, others, including [[Greenpeace]] and [[Friends of the Earth]], opposed it."<ref name="nyt"/>  Friends of the Earth, an international environmental organization, announced its opposition to ACES as they believed the bill was too weak. They cited support from [[Shell Oil Company]] and [[Duke Energy]] as evidence of the bill's shortcomings. They also objected to the removal of the EPA's existing authority to use the Clean Air Act to counter emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref>

</ref> Environmental organizations critical of the bill said the bill fell short by allowing for 85 percent or more of pollution permits to be given away free of cost to the electricity sector. A coalition of environmental groups released a statement saying that "to craft a bill that allows for 2 billion tons of offsets per year — roughly equivalent to 27 percent of 2007 U.S. greenhouse gas emissions — is to allow for continued and dangerous delay in real action by our country at a time when the world is looking to the U.S. for leadership on climate change."<ref>[http://www.redd-monitor.org/2009/04/24/environmental-groups-urge-waxmanmarkey-to-close-the-floodgate-on-carbon-offsets redd-monitor.org]{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2009}}</ref> Critics of the bill were concerned about it not going far enough, and claimed that there were too many concessions made to special interests in rewriting the bill.<ref>{{cite news

Dr. [[James E. Hansen]], one of the first to warn about the risks of climate change and an advocate of taking related action, also argued strongly against the bill: 1) It restricted the EPA's ability to regulate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from power plants; 2) it set "meager" targets for emission reductions, with only a 13% reduction by 2020; 3) it lacked certain controls important to the trading of allowances to emit carbon; and 4) it failed to set predictable prices for carbon, making it harder for businesses and households to make investment decisions. Dr. Hansen advocated a carbon tax rather than a cap and trade system.<ref>{{cite news

Alternatively, Senators Maria Cantwell and Susan Collins introduced the [[Carbon Limits and Energy for America's Renewal (CLEAR) Act]]. This bill proposed a [[Cap and Dividend]] approach in which 75% of the revenue is returned to taxpayers in the form of a dividend, and the rest is used to fund to development of renewable energy.<ref>{{cite news

=== Media response ===
News agencies [[Reuters]] and [[Agence France-Presse]] and [[United Kingdom]] newspaper [[The Guardian]] reported the narrow passage of the "historic"<ref name=afphistoric>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iqcr7nMnCiZYVHW_iQ1hbxHWuIBQ|title=AFP: US House passes historic climate change bill}}</ref><ref name=Guardian27>{{cite news|last=Goldenberg|first=Suzanne|title=Barack Obama's US climate change bill passes key Congress vote|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2009-06-27|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/27/barack-obama-climate-change-bill|accessdate=2009-07-07 | location=London| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090630040118/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jun/27/barack-obama-climate-change-bill| archive-date= 30 June 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> legislation in the House, regarding the vote to be a "major"<ref name=afphistoric/><ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE55O4R120090626 House passes landmark climate change bill], Reuters</ref> and "hard-fought"<ref name=afphistoric/> victory for President Obama, while an [[Associated Press]] article, carried by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], reported the vote to be "a triumph for [the] U.S. President."<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/u-s-house-passes-climate-change-bill-1.801611 U.S. House passes climate change bill], Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</ref>

[[The New York Times]] commented that "the House legislation reflects a series of concessions necessary to attract the support of Democrats from different regions and with different ideologies. In the months of horse-trading before the vote Friday, the bill's targets for emissions of heat-trapping gases were weakened, its mandate for renewable electricity was scaled back, and incentives for industries were sweetened."<ref name="nyt"/>  [[Business Week]] emphasized its perceived significance of the legislation and its passage in the House, declaring "June 26, 2009, will go down as an historic moment in world's efforts to tackle climate change. For the first time, a Congressional body passed legislation that would place mandatory limits on the emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/blogs/money_politics/archives/2009/06/house_passes_ca.html|title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?|website=www.businessweek.com}}</ref>

==Impact on Copenhagen Climate Change Conference==
It was reported that the passage of ACES in Congress would increase the likelihood that a successor to the [[Kyoto Protocol]] would be adopted at the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009]] in [[Copenhagen]]. The Guardian US environment correspondent noted that ACES passing the US House of Representatives "delivers an important boost to the prospects of reaching an agreement for international action on climate change at Copenhagen this year."<ref name=Guardian27/> The NYTimes noted that "the German chancellor, [[Angela Merkel]], who was in Washington on Friday to meet with Mr. Obama, strongly endorsed the bill even though it fell short of European goals for reducing the emissions of heat-trapping gases."<ref name="nyt"/>

On May 21, 2009, the bill passed out of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Energy and Commerce Committee]] by a vote of 33-25, largely falling along political party lines.<ref>{{cite web|title=Committee on Energy and Commerce - 111th Congress Roll Call Vote #68|url=http://republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/Media/file/Markups/Energy/ACES0509/FinalPassage.pdf|access-date=2012-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527212422/http://republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/Media/file/Markups/Energy/ACES0509/FinalPassage.pdf|archive-date=2010-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Energy and Commerce Committee markup ===
Republicans proposed over 400 amendments to the bill, the majority of which many think were proposed to delay passage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20602099&sid=aCOW1G1GFgAQ&refer=energy|title=Waxman Seeks Bipartisan Help in Passing Climate Bill|date=2009-05-18|publisher=[[Bloomberg.com]]|accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref> Some of the more prominent from both parties are listed below:

==== Accepted ====
*[[John Dingell]] (D-MI) offered an amendment that establishes a bank to assist with loans for clean energy development.
*[[Betty Sutton]] (D-OH) offered an amendment establishing a "Cash for Clunkers" program, giving $3,500 or $4,500 toward the purchase or lease of more fuel efficient vehicles if anyone trades in qualifying, less-efficient vehicles.
*[[Kathy Castor]] (D-FL) offered an amendment giving states the ability to adopt [[feed-in tariff]]s for renewable energy as defined in the bill.
*[[Henry Waxman]] (D-CA) offered an amendment creating a classification of "central procurement state" that allows existing renewable energy legislation passed by states before January 1, 2009 to supersede some provisions of the bill.

==== Defeated ====
*[[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]] (R-MI) offered an amendment that would have cancelled the Act unless [[China]] and [[India]] adopt similar standards.
*[[Roy Blunt]] (R-MO) offered an amendment that would have cancelled the Act if the average price of electricity in a residential sector increases by 10% or more.  After defeat, he offered a second amendment that would have cancelled only Title III (the cap-and-trade plan) of the Act if residential electricity prices rise by 20%.  After defeat of this measure, [[George Radanovich]] (R-CA) offered a similar amendment that would have cancelled only Title III if electricity prices in the residential sector rise by 100%.  This measure was also defeated.  In the hearing, [[Bart Stupak]] (D-MI) called into question the seriousness of these "message amendments."  He stated they are only offered to be used by the Republicans to spur sensational headlines about lack of sympathy by Democrats.  Ranking Member [[Joe Barton]] (R-TX) responded that they were indeed "message amendments" to the American people in an attempt to convey that supporters of the bill care nothing about cost to the ratepayer.
*[[Lee Terry]] (R-NE) offered an amendment that would have cancelled the Act if average gas prices reach $5 per gallon.
*[[Fred Upton]] (R-MI) offered an amendment that would have suspended the Act if the nation's unemployment rate for the prior year reaches 15% as a result of the Act.
*[[Marsha Blackburn]] (R-TN) offered an amendment that would have required the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to label energy bills, food, manufactured products and fuels with the price impact this law has on the item.
*[[Cliff Stearns]] (R-FL) offered an amendment that would have removed existing nuclear power from the baseline of the Renewable Electricity Standard.  (This amendment would have potentially reduced the overall implementation of renewable energy under this act by around 20%, the amount of nuclear electricity generation in the United States).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nei.org/resourcesandstats/documentlibrary/reliableandaffordableenergy/graphicsandcharts/uselectricitygenerationfuelshares | title=U.S. Electricity Generation Fuel Shares | date=April 2009 | publisher=Nuclear Energy Institute | accessdate=2009-05-21 | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090709005458/http://www.nei.org/resourcesandstats/documentlibrary/reliableandaffordableenergy/graphicsandcharts/uselectricitygenerationfuelshares/ | archive-date=2009-07-09 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

By the end of May 20, 2009, 2 Republican and 24 Democratic amendments had been adopted.  15 Republican amendments had been defeated.  No amendment sponsored by a Democrat had yet been defeated.
