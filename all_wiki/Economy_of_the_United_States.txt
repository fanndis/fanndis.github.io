==History==
{{main|Economic history of the United States}}

===Colonial era and 18th century===
The economic history of the United States began with British settlements along the Eastern seaboard in the 17th and 18th centuries. These [[Thirteen Colonies|13 colonies]] gained independence from the [[British Empire]] in the late 18th century and quickly grew from colonial economies towards an economy focused on agriculture.

===19th century===

In 180 years, the U.S. grew to a huge, integrated, industrialized economy that made up around one-fifth of the [[world economy]]. As a result, the U.S. GDP per capita converged on and eventually surpassed that of the [[British Empire]], as well as other nations that it previously trailed economically. The economy maintained high wages, attracting immigrants by the millions from all over the world.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In the early 1800s, the United States was largely agricultural with more than 80 percent of the population in farming. Most of the manufacturing centered on the first stages of transformation of raw materials with lumber and saw mills, textiles and boots and shoes leading the way. The rich resource endowments contributed to the rapid economic expansion during the nineteenth century. Ample land availability allowed the number of farmers to keep growing, but activity in manufacturing, services, transportation and other sectors grew at a much faster pace. Thus, by 1860 the share of the farm population in the U.S. had fallen from over 80 percent to roughly 50 percent.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

At the beginning of the century new [[innovation]]s and improvements in existing innovations opened the door for improvements in the standard of living among American consumers. Many firms grew large by taking advantage of economies of scale and better communication to run nationwide operations. Concentration in these industries raised fears of monopoly that would drive prices higher and output lower, but many of these firms were cutting costs so fast that trends were towards lower price and more output in these industries. Many workers shared the success of these large firms, which typically offered the highest wages in the world.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The United States has been the world's largest national economy in terms of GDP since at least the 1920s.<ref name="Digital History"/> For many years following the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, when danger of [[recession]] appeared most serious, the government strengthened the economy by spending heavily itself or cutting taxes so that consumers would spend more, and by fostering rapid growth in the money supply, which also encouraged more spending. Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s. From the [[New Deal]] era that began in 1933, to the [[Great Society]] initiatives of the 1960s, national policy makers relied principally on [[fiscal policy]] to influence the economy.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

During the world wars of the twentieth century, the United States fared better than the rest of the combatants because none of the First World War and relatively little of the Second World War was fought on American territory (and none on the then 48 states). Yet, even in the United States, the wars meant sacrifice. During the peak of Second World War activity, nearly 40 percent of U.S. GDP was devoted to war production. Decisions about large swaths of the economy were largely made for military purposes and nearly all relevant inputs were allocated to the war effort. Many goods were rationed, prices and wages controlled and many durable consumer goods were no longer produced. Large segments of the workforce were inducted into the military, paid half wages, and roughly half of those were sent into harm's way.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The approach, advanced by British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], gave elected officials a leading role in directing the economy since spending and taxes are controlled by the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] and the [[Congress of the United States|Congress]]. The [[post–World War II baby boom|"Baby Boom"]] saw a dramatic increase in fertility in the period 1942–1957; it was caused by delayed marriages and childbearing during depression years, a surge in prosperity, a demand for suburban single-family homes (as opposed to inner city apartments) and new optimism about the future. The boom crested about 1957, then slowly declined.<ref name="Susan Kellogg 1988">Steven Mintz and Susan Kellogg, ''Domestic Revolutions: a Social History of American Family Life'' (1988) ch 9</ref> A period of high inflation, interest rates and unemployment after 1973 weakened confidence in fiscal policy as a tool for regulating the overall pace of economic activity.<ref name=buchanan1977>

Since the 1970s, several [[emerging countries]] have begun to close the economic gap with the United States. In most cases, this has been due to moving the manufacture of goods formerly made in the U.S. to countries where they could be made for sufficiently less money to cover the cost of shipping plus a higher profit. In other cases, some countries have gradually learned to produce the same products and services that previously only the U.S. and a few other countries could produce. Real income growth in the U.S. has slowed.

The United States economy experienced a recession in 2001 with an unusually slow jobs recovery, with the number of jobs not regaining the February 2001 level until January 2005.<ref name="Payems"/> This "jobless recovery" overlapped with the building of a [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] and arguably a wider debt bubble, as the ratio of household debt to GDP rose from a record level of 70% in Q1 2001 to 99% in Q1 2008. Homeowners were borrowing against their bubble-priced homes to fuel consumption, driving up their debt levels while providing an unsustainable boost to GDP. When housing prices began falling in 2006, the value of securities backed by mortgages fell dramatically, causing the equivalent of a [[bank run]] in the essentially unregulated [[shadow banking|non-depository]] banking system, which had outgrown the traditional, regulated depository banking system. Many mortgage companies and other non-depository banks (e.g., investment banks) faced a worsening crisis in 2007–2008, with the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|banking crisis]] peaking in September 2008, with the bankruptcy of [[Lehman Brothers]] and bailouts of several other financial institutions.<ref name="FCIC_1">{{cite web |url = http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/report/conclusions |title = Financial Crisis Inquiry Report-Conclusions-January 2011 |publisher = Fcic.law.stanford.edu |date = March 10, 2011 |access-date = April 22, 2013}}</ref>

The Bush administration (2001–2009) and Obama administrations (2009–2017) applied banking [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|bailout programs]] and Keynesian [[American Reinvestment and Recovery Act|stimulus]] via high government deficits, while the Federal Reserve maintained near-zero interest rates.

Debt held by the public, a measure of national debt, has risen throughout the 21st century, rising from 31% in 2000 to 52% in 2009 and 77% of GDP in 2017, which was ranked 43rd highest out of 207 countries. Income inequality peaked in 2007 and fell during the Great Recession, yet still ranked 41st highest among 156 countries in 2017 (i.e., 74% of countries had a more equal income distribution).<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2186rank.html#us CIA World Factbook – Debt to GDP]</ref>

About 70% of U.S. GDP is personal consumption, with business investment 18%, government 17% (federal, state and local but excluding transfer payments such as Social Security, which is in consumption) and net exports a negative 3% due to the U.S. trade deficit.<ref>[https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm BEA News Release – GDP Second Quarter 2018 – July 27, 2018]</ref> Real [[gross domestic product]], a measure of both production and income, grew by 2.3% in 2017, vs. 1.5% in 2016 and 2.9% in 2015.

As of 2014, China passed the U.S. as the largest economy in GDP terms, measured at purchasing power parity conversion rates. The U.S. was the largest economy for more than a century prior to that milestone; China has more than tripled the U.S. growth rate for each of the past 40 years.

===Income inequality===
Income inequality has become a hotly debated topic globally.

For after-tax income, these figures were 7%, 17%, and 13%, respectively. These figures indicate the share of income earned by top earners more than doubled between 1979 and 2007, then fell somewhat following the [[Great Recession]], and the higher tax rates and re-distributive policies applied by President Barack Obama in 2013 (i.e., expiration of the [[Bush Tax Cuts]] for the top 1% and subsidies for lower income persons via the [[Affordable Care Act]]).<ref name="CBO_Dist2014">[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53597 CBO.

===Coverage===
{{See|Health insurance coverage in the United States}}
The American system is a mix of public and private insurance. The government provides insurance coverage for approximately 53&nbsp;million elderly via [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], 62&nbsp;million lower-income persons via [[Medicaid]], and 15&nbsp;million military veterans via the [[Veteran's Administration]]. About 178&nbsp;million employed by companies receive subsidized health insurance through their employer, while 52&nbsp;million other persons directly purchase insurance either via the subsidized marketplace exchanges developed as part of the [[Affordable Care Act]] or directly from insurers. The private sector delivers healthcare services, with the exception of the Veteran's Administration, where doctors are employed by the government.<ref name="Census2016">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.html|title=Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2016|first=US Census|last=Bureau|website=census.gov}}</ref>

Multiple surveys indicate the number of uninsured fell between 2013 and 2016 due to expanded [[Medicaid]] eligibility and health insurance exchanges established due to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], also known as the "ACA" or "Obamacare". According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], in 2012 there were 45.6&nbsp;million people in the US (14.8% of the under-65 population) who were without health insurance. Following the implementation of major ACA provisions in 2013, this figure fell by 18.3&nbsp;million or 40%, to 27.3&nbsp;million by 2016 or 8.6% of the under-65 population.<ref name="Census_HistTable">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/health-insurance/historical-series/hic.html|title=Health Insurance Historical Tables –HIC Series|first=US Census|last=Bureau|publisher=Census}}</ref>

However, under President Trump these gains in healthcare coverage have begun to reverse. The [[Commonwealth Fund]] estimated in May 2018 that the number of uninsured increased by 4&nbsp;million from early 2016 to early 2018. The rate of those uninsured increased from 12.7% in 2016 to 15.5%. The impact was greater among lower-income adults, who had a higher uninsured rate than higher-income adults.

The U.S. lags in overall healthcare performance but is [[Biomedical research in the United States|a global leader in medical innovation]]. America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the EU and Switzerland together contributed to five. Since 1966, Americans have received more [[List of Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prizes in Medicine]] than the rest of the world combined.

===Cost===
{{See|Health care prices in the United States}}

U.S. healthcare costs are considerably higher than other countries as a share of GDP, among other measures. According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], U.S. healthcare costs in 2015 were 16.9% GDP, over 5% GDP higher than the next most expensive OECD country.<ref name="OECD1">[http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SHA OECD Statistical Database – Health expenditure and financing]</ref> A gap of 5% GDP represents $1&nbsp;trillion, about $3,000 per person or one-third higher relative to the next most expensive country.<ref name="CDC1">{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/health-expenditures.htm|title=FastStats|date=18 July 2017|website=cdc.gov}}</ref>

The high cost of health care in the United States is attributed variously to technological advance, administration costs, drug pricing, suppliers charging more for medical equipment, the receiving of more medical care than people in other countries, the high wages of doctors, government regulations, the impact of lawsuits, and third party payment systems insulating consumers from the full cost of treatments.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Conover|first1=Christopher J.|title=Health Care Regulation A $169 Billion Hidden Tax|url=http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa527.pdf|publisher=Cato Institute|access-date=2 September 2014|date=October 4, 2004}}</ref><ref name=Cutler>{{cite web|title=Why Does Health Care Cost so Much in America?

==Currency and central bank==
{{Main|United States dollar|Federal Reserve System}}

The United States dollar is the unit of currency of the United States. The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pdf/pf_4.pdf |title=The Implementation of Monetary Policy – The Federal Reserve in the International Sphere |access-date=April 21, 2012}}</ref> Several countries [[Dollarization|use it as their official currency]], and in many others it is the [[de facto currency]].<ref>Benjamin J. Cohen, ''The Future of Money'', Princeton University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0691116660}}; ''cf.'' "the dollar is the de facto currency in Cambodia", Charles Agar, ''Frommer's Vietnam'', 2006, {{ISBN|0471798169}}, p. 17</ref>

The federal government attempts to use both [[monetary policy]] (control of the money supply through mechanisms such as changes in interest rates) and [[fiscal policy]] (taxes and spending) to maintain low inflation, high economic growth, and low unemployment. A private [[central bank]], known as the [[Federal Reserve]], was formed in 1913 to provide a stable currency and [[monetary policy]].

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] regulates private enterprise in numerous ways. Regulation falls into two general categories.

Some efforts seek, either directly or indirectly, to control prices. Traditionally, the government has sought to create state-regulated [[monopoly|monopolies]] such as electric utilities while allowing prices in the level that would ensure them normal profits. At times, the government has extended economic control to other kinds of industries as well. In the years following the Great Depression, it devised a complex system to stabilize prices for agricultural goods, which tend to fluctuate wildly in response to rapidly changing supply and demand. A number of other industries—trucking and, later, airlines—successfully sought regulation themselves to limit what they considered as harmful price-cutting, a process called [[regulatory capture]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Regulation and Control in the U.S. Economy: About.com</ref>

Another form of economic regulation, [[Competition law|antitrust law]], seeks to strengthen market forces so that direct regulation is unnecessary. The government—and, sometimes, private parties—have used antitrust law to prohibit practices or mergers that would unduly limit competition.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

[[Bank regulation in the United States]] is highly fragmented compared to other [[Group of Ten (economic)|G10]] countries where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and state level. The U.S. also has one of the most highly regulated banking environments in the world; however, many of the regulations are not soundness related, but are instead focused on privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-[[usury]] lending, and promoting lending to lower-income segments.

Since the 1970s, government has also exercised control over private companies to achieve social goals, such as improving the public's health and safety or maintaining a healthy environment. For example, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] provides and enforces standards for workplace safety, and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] provides standards and regulations to maintain air, water, and land resources. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates what drugs may reach the market, and also provides standards of disclosure for food products.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

American attitudes about regulation changed substantially during the final three decades of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, policy makers grew increasingly convinced that economic regulation protected companies at the expense of consumers in industries such as airlines and trucking. At the same time, technological changes spawned new competitors in some industries, such as telecommunications, that once were considered natural monopolies. Both developments led to a succession of laws easing regulation.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

While leaders of America's two most influential political parties generally favored economic [[deregulation]] during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, there was less agreement concerning regulations designed to achieve social goals. Social regulation had assumed growing importance in the years following the Depression and World War II, and again in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, the government relaxed labor, consumer and environmental rules based on the idea that such regulation interfered with [[free enterprise]], increased the costs of doing business, and thus contributed to inflation. The response to such changes is mixed; many Americans continued to voice concerns about specific events or trends, prompting the government to issue new regulations in some areas, including environmental protection.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Where legislative channels have been unresponsive, some citizens have turned to the courts to address social issues more quickly. For instance, in the 1990s, individuals, and eventually the government itself, sued tobacco companies over the health risks of cigarette smoking. The 1998 [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]] provided states with long-term payments to cover medical costs to treat smoking-related illnesses.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Between 2000 and 2008, economic regulation in the United States saw the most rapid expansion since the early 1970s. The number of new pages in the Federal Registry, a proxy for economic regulation, rose from 64,438 new pages in 2001 to 78,090 in new pages in 2007, a record amount of regulation. Economically significant regulations, defined as regulations which cost more than $100&nbsp;million a year, increased by 70%. Spending on regulation increased by 62% from $26.4&nbsp;billion to $42.7&nbsp;billion.<ref name="bushregulation">{{cite magazine|title=Bush's Regulatory Kiss-Off – Obama's assertions to the contrary, the 43rd president was the biggest regulator since Nixon|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/130328.html|magazine=Reason magazine|date=January 2009|access-date=February 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902085717/http://www.reason.com/news/show/130328.html|archive-date=September 2, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Taxation===
{{Main|Taxation in the United States}}

[[Taxation in the United States]] is a complex system which may involve payment to at least four different levels of government and many methods of taxation. Taxes are levied by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], by the [[State governments of the United States|state governments]], and often by [[Local government in the United States|local governments]], which may include [[Counties of the United States|counties]], municipalities, [[Township (United States)|township]], [[school district]]s, and other [[Special district (United States)|special-purpose districts]], which include fire, utility, and transit districts.<ref>{{cite news |title=America's Aversion to Taxes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/business/economy/slipping-behind-because-of-an-aversion-to-taxes.html?_r=1&src=recg |quote=In 1965, taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.7 percent of the nation's output. In 2010, they amounted to 24.8 percent. Excluding Chile and Mexico, the United States raises less tax revenue, as a share of the economy, than every other industrial country. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 14, 2012 |access-date=August 15, 2012 |first=Eduardo |last=Porter}}</ref>

Forms of taxation include taxes on [[Income tax in the United States|income]], [[Property tax in the United States|property]], [[Sales tax in the United States|sales]], imports, payroll, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. When taxation by all government levels taken into consideration, the [[List of countries by tax revenue as percentage of GDP|total taxation as percentage of GDP]] was approximately a quarter of GDP in 2011.<ref>{{Citation| url=http://www.heritage.org/index/country/unitedstates | title=Index of Economic Freedom: United States | publisher=Index of Economic Freedom }}</ref> Share of [[black market]] in the U.S. economy is very low compared to other countries.<ref name="Trans-Atlantic Comparisons 3-2">{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,628389-2,00.html |work=Der Spiegel| title=Is the US Really a Nation of God-Fearing Darwin-Haters? | date=June 6, 2009}}</ref>

Although a federal [[wealth tax]] is prohibited by the [[United States Constitution]] unless the receipts are distributed to the States by their populations, state and local government property tax amount to a wealth tax on [[real estate]], and because [[Capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains]] are taxed on nominal instead of inflation-adjusted profits, the capital gains tax amounts to a wealth tax on the inflation rate.<ref name=YglesiasWealth>{{cite news|last=Yglesias|first=Matthew|title=America Does Tax Wealth, Just Not Very Intelligently|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/03/06/america_s_wealth_tax_it_s_called_property_taxes_and_they_re_not_very_smart.html|access-date=March 18, 2013|newspaper=Slate|date=March 6, 2013}}</ref>

The United States public-sector spending amounts to about 38% of GDP (federal is around 21%, state and local the remainder).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-spending.htm|title=General Government Spending}}</ref> Each level of government provides many direct services. The federal government, for example, is responsible for national defense, research that often leads to the development of new products, conducts space exploration, and runs numerous programs designed to help workers develop workplace skills and find jobs (including higher education). Government spending has a significant effect on local and regional economies—and on the overall pace of economic activity.

[[Politics of the United States|State governments]], meanwhile, are responsible for the construction and maintenance of most highways. State, county, or city governments play the leading role in financing and operating public schools. Local governments are primarily responsible for police and fire protection. In 2016, U.S. state and local governments owed $3&nbsp;trillion and have another $5&nbsp;trillion in unfunded liabilities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Debt Myths, Debunked |url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/articles/2016-12-01/myths-and-facts-about-the-us-federal-debt |work=U.S. News |date=December 1, 2016}}</ref>

The [[United States welfare state|welfare system in the United States]] began in the 1930s, during the Great Depression, with the passage of the [[New Deal]]. The welfare system was later expanded in the 1960s through [[Great Society]] legislation, which included [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], the [[Older Americans Act]] and federal education funding.

===Federal budget and debt===
{{further|United States federal budget}}
During FY2017, the federal government spent $3.98&nbsp;trillion on a budget or cash basis, up $128&nbsp;billion or 3.3% vs. FY2016 spending of $3.85&nbsp;trillion. Major categories of FY 2017 spending included: Healthcare such as Medicare and Medicaid ($1,077B or 27% of spending), Social Security ($939B or 24%), non-defense discretionary spending used to run federal Departments and Agencies ($610B or 15%), Defense Department ($590B or 15%), and interest ($263B or 7%).<ref name="CBO_BOE2018"/>

During FY2017, the federal government collected approximately $3.32&nbsp;trillion in tax revenue, up $48&nbsp;billion or 1.5% versus FY2016. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,587B or 48% of total receipts), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($1,162B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($297B or 9%). Other revenue types included excise, estate and gift taxes. FY 2017 revenues were 17.3% of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), versus 17.7% in FY 2016. Tax revenues averaged approximately 17.4% GDP over the 1980–2017 period.<ref name="CBO_BOE2018"/>

The federal budget deficit (i.e., expenses greater than revenues) was $665&nbsp;billion in FY2017, versus $585&nbsp;billion in 2016, an increase of $80&nbsp;billion or 14%. The budget deficit was 3.5% GDP in 2017, versus 3.2% GDP in 2016. The budget deficit is forecast to rise to $804&nbsp;billion in FY 2018, due significantly to the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] and other spending bills. An aging country and healthcare inflation are other drivers of deficits and debt over the long-run.<ref name="CBO_BOE2018"/>

Debt held by the public, a measure of national debt, was approximately $14.7&nbsp;trillion or 77% of GDP in 2017, ranked the 43rd highest out of 207 countries.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2186rank.html#us CIA World Factbook-Debt to GDP]</ref> This debt, as a percent of GDP, is roughly equivalent to those of many western European nations.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/is-rising-u-s-debt-inviting-trouble-ask-japan/19469343/|access-date=May 18, 2010|title=Is Rising U.S. Debt Inviting Trouble?

From its emergence as an independent nation, the United States has encouraged science and innovation. In the early 20th century, the research developed through informal cooperation between U.S. industry and academia grew rapidly and by the late 1930s exceeded the size of that taking place in Britain (although the quality of U.S. research was not yet on par with British and German research at the time). After World War II, federal spending on defense R&D and antitrust policy played a significant role in U.S. innovation.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Walker, William|title=National innovation systems : a comparative analysis|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195076172|editor1-last=Nelson|editor1-first=Richard R.|location=New York|pages=61–64|chapter=National Innovation Systems: Britain|ref=Walker1993|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFDGjgxc2CYC&pg=PA61}}<!-- Author profile: https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/intrel/people/index.php/wbw.html--></ref>

The United States is rich in mineral resources and fertile farm soil, and it is fortunate to have a moderate climate. It also has extensive coastlines on both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as on the Gulf of Mexico. Rivers flow from far within the continent and the [[Great Lakes]]—five large, inland lakes along the U.S. border with Canada—provide additional shipping access. These extensive waterways have helped shape the country's economic growth over the years and helped bind America's 50 individual states together in a single economic unit.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081114043907/http://usinfo.state.gov/infousa/government/forpolicy/chap2.html U.S. Department of state: How the U.S. Economy Works]</ref>

The number of workers and, more importantly, their productivity help determine the health of the U.S. economy. [[Consumer spending]] in the U.S. rose to about 62% of GDP in 1960, where it stayed until about 1981, and has since risen to 71% in 2013.<ref name=consumerecon/> Throughout its history, the United States has experienced steady growth in the labor force, a phenomenon that is both cause and effect of almost constant economic expansion. Until shortly after World War I, most workers were immigrants from Europe, their immediate descendants, or African Americans who were mostly slaves taken from Africa, or their descendants.<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EB29BrnCMm4C&pg=PA280 Trends in International Migration 2002: Continuous Reporting System on Migration]''".

Labor mobility has also been important to the capacity of the American economy to adapt to changing conditions. When immigrants flooded labor markets on the East Coast, many workers moved inland, often to farmland waiting to be tilled. Similarly, economic opportunities in industrial, northern cities attracted black Americans from [[Southern United States|southern]] farms in the first half of the 20th century, in what was known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].

In the United States, the corporation has emerged as an association of owners, known as stockholders, who form a business enterprise governed by a complex set of rules and customs. Brought on by the process of [[mass production]], corporations, such as [[General Electric]], have been instrumental in shaping the United States. Through the [[stock market]], American banks and investors have grown their economy by investing and withdrawing capital from profitable corporations. Today in the era of [[globalization]], American investors and corporations have influence all over the world. The American government is also included among the major investors in the American economy. Government investments have been directed towards public works of scale (such as from the [[Hoover Dam]]), military-industrial contracts, and the financial industry.

===Aging===
The U.S. population is aging, which has significant economic implications for GDP growth, productivity, innovation, inequality, and national debt, according to several studies. The average worker in 2019 was aged 42, vs. 38 in 2000. By 2030, about 59% of adults over 16 will be in the labor force, vs. 62% in 2015. One study estimated that aging since 2000 has reduced productivity between 0.25% and 0.7% per year. Since GDP growth is a function of productivity (output per worker) and the number of workers, both trends slow the GDP growth rate. Older workers save more, which pushes interests rates down, offsetting some of the GDP growth reduction but reducing the Federal Reserve's ability to address a recession by lowering interest rates. Means of addressing the aging trend include immigration (which theoretically brings in younger workers) and higher fertility rates, which can be encouraged by incentives to have more children (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies, and more generous paid leave).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/sunday-review/work-age-economy.html?|title=This Economy Is Not Aging Gracefully |last=Porter |first=Eduardo |date=June 15, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=June 15, 2019}}</ref>

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated in May 2019 that mandatory spending (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security) will continue growing relative to the size of the economy (GDP) as the population ages. The population aged 65 or older is projected to rise by one-third from 2019-2029. Mandatory program spending (outlays) in 2019 were 12.7% of GDP and are projected to average 14.4% GDP from 2025-2029.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55151|title= Updated Budget Projections: 2019 to 2029|date=May 2, 2019 |work=[[Congressional Budget Office]] |access-date=June 15, 2019}}</ref>

The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. In 1876, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was awarded the first U.S. [[Invention of the telephone|patent for the telephone]]. [[Thomas Edison]]'s laboratory developed the [[phonograph]], the first [[Incandescent light bulb|long-lasting light bulb]], and the first viable [[Kinetoscope|movie camera]]. Edison's company would also pioneer ([[direct current]] based) electric power delivery and market it around the world, followed on by companies such as [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] which would rapidly develop [[alternating current]] power delivery. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of [[Ransom E. Olds]] and [[Henry Ford]] popularized the [[assembly line]].

[[File:Steve Jobs and Bill Gates (522695099).jpg|thumb|[[Steve Jobs]] and [[Bill Gates]] are two of the best-known American entrepreneurs.]]

American society highly emphasizes entrepreneurship and business. [[Entrepreneurship]] is the act of being an entrepreneur, which can be defined as "one who undertakes [[innovation]]s, finance and business acumen in an effort to transform innovations into economic goods". This may result in new organizations or may be part of revitalizing mature organizations in response to a perceived opportunity.<ref name="ReferenceB">Shane, Scott "A General Theory of Entrepreneurship: the Individual-Opportunity Nexus", Edward Elgar</ref> American entrepreneurs are even engaged in public services delivery through [[Public-private partnerships in the United States|public-private partnerships]].

The most obvious form of entrepreneurship refers to the process and engagement of starting new businesses (referred to as [[Startup company|startup companies]]); however, in recent years, the term has been extended to include social and political forms of entrepreneurial activity. When entrepreneurship is describing activities within a firm or large organization it is referred to as intra-preneurship and may include corporate venturing, when large entities spin-off organizations.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

According to Paul Reynolds, entrepreneurship scholar and creator of the [[Global Entrepreneurship Monitor]], "by the time they reach their retirement years, half of all working men in the United States probably have a period of self-employment of one or more years; one in four may have engaged in self-employment for six or more years. Participating in a new business creation is a common activity among U.S. workers over the course of their careers."<ref>Reynolds, Paul D. "Entrepreneurship in the United States", Springer, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0387456676}}</ref> And in recent years, business creation has been documented by scholars such as [[David Audretsch]] to be a major driver of economic growth in both the United States and Western Europe.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

== Venture capital investment ==
[[File:US VC funding.png|300px|right|Quarterly U.S. venture capital investments, 1995–2017]]
[[Venture capital]], as an industry, originated in the United States, which it still dominates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.briskfox.com/open/years/2009_q1/do_v_c44780.php|title=Mandelson, Peter.

Total U.S. investment in venture capital amounted to US$48.3 billion in 2014, for 4 356 deals. This represented 'an increase of 61% in dollars and a 4% increase in deals over the prior year,' reported the National Venture Capital Association. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that venture capital investment in the United States had fully recovered by 2014 to pre-recession levels. The National Venture Capital Association has reported that, in 2014, venture capital investment in the life sciences was at its highest level since 2008: in biotechnology, $6.0 billion was invested in 470 deals and, in life sciences overall, $8.6 billion in 789 deals (including biotechnology and medical devices). Two thirds (68%) of the investment in biotechnology went to first-time/early-stage development deals and the remainder to the expansion stage of development (14%), seed-stage companies (11%) and late-stage companies (7%). However, it was the software industry which invested in the greatest number of deals overall: 1,799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1,005 deals. Many of these companies are based in the state of California, which alone concentrates 28% of U.S. research.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=United States of America.

Some new American businesses raise investments from [[angel investor]]s (venture capitalists). In 2010 healthcare/medical accounted for the largest share of angel investments, with 30% of total angel investments (vs. 17% in 2009), followed by software (16% vs. 19% in 2007), biotech (15% vs. 8% in 2009), industrial/energy (8% vs. 17% in 2009), retail (5% vs. 8% in 2009) and IT services (5%).<ref>{{cite web|last=Sohl|first=Jeffrey|title=Full Year 2009 Angel Market Trends|url=http://wsbe.unh.edu/files/2009_Angel_Market_Press_Release.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120034841/http://wsbe.unh.edu/files/2009_Angel_Market_Press_Release.pdf|archive-date=January 20, 2013|publisher=University of New Hampshire Center for Venture Research|access-date=September 27, 2011|date=March 31, 2010}}</ref> {{clarify|In this article, we really need total amount of dollars/annually|date=February 2012}}

== Mergers and Acquisitions ==
Since 1985 there have been three major waves of M&A in the U.S. (see graph "Mergers and Acquisitions in the U.S. since 1985"). 2017 has been the most active year in terms of number of deals (12,914), whereas 2015 cumulated to the biggest overall value of deals (24 billion USD).

The biggest merger deal in U.S. history was the acquisition of Time Warner by America Online Inc. in 2000, where the bid was over 164 billion USD. Since 2000 acquisitions of U.S. companies by Chinese investors increased by 368%. The other way round—US companies acquiring Chinese Companies—showed a decrease of 25%, with a short upwards trend until 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-us-united-states/|title=M&A US – Mergers & Acquisitions in the United States|work=IMAA-Institute|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Research and development ==
[[File:GERD GDP ratio in the USA, 2002–2013.svg|thumb|Gross domestic expenditure on R&D in the U.S. as a percentage of GDP, 2002–2013. Other countries are given for comparison. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030]]
The U.S. invests more funds in research and development (R&D) in absolute terms than the other G7 nations combined: 17.2% more in 2012. Since 2000, gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) in the U.S. has increased by 31.2%, enabling it to maintain its share of GERD among the G7 nations at 54.0% (54.2% in 2000).<ref name=":0" />

=== Impact of recession on research spending ===
Generally speaking, U.S. investment in R&D rose with the economy in the first years of the century before receding slightly during the economic recession then rising again as growth resumed. At its peak in 2009, GERD amounted to US$ 406 billion (2.82% of GDP). Despite the recession, it was still at 2.79% in 2012 and will slide only marginally to 2.73% in 2013, according to provisional data, and should remain at a similar level in 2014.<ref name=":0" />

The federal government is the primary funder of basic research, at 52.6% in 2012; state governments, universities and other non-profits funded 26%. Experimental development, on the other hand, is primarily funded by industry: 76.4% to the federal government's 22.1% in 2012.<ref name=":0" />
[[File:World shares of GDP, GERD, researchers and publications for the G20, 2009 and 2013.svg|thumb|World shares of GDP, research spending, researchers and scientific publications, 2009 and 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 1.7]]
While U.S. investment in R&D is high, it failed to reach President Obama's target of 3% of GDP by the end of his presidency in 2016. American supremacy is eroding in this respect, even as other nations—China, in particular—are carrying their own investment in R&D to new heights. Between 2009 and 2012, the United States' world share of research expenditure receded slightly from 30.5% to 28.1%. Several countries now devote more than 4% of GDP to R&D (Israel, Japan and the Republic of Korea) and others plan to raise their own GERD/GDP ratio to 4% by 2020 (Finland and Sweden).<ref name=":0" />

=== Business spending on research ===
Business enterprises contributed 59.1 % of U.S. GERD in 2012, down from 69.0 % in 2000. Private non-profits and foreign entities each contribute a small fraction of total R&D, 3.3% and 3.8%, respectively.<ref name=":0" /> [[File:R&D budget by US agency, 1994–2014.svg|thumb|US research and development budget by government agency, 1994–2014. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 5.4, based on data from American Association for the Advancement of Science]]The USA has historically been a leader in business R&D and innovation. The economic recession of 2008–2009 has had a lasting impact, however. While the major performers of R&D largely maintained their commitments, the pain of the U.S. recession was felt mainly by small businesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau showed that, in 2008, the number of business 'deaths' began overtaking the number of business 'births' and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From 2003 to 2008, business research spending had followed a generally upward trajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the previous year then again in 2010, albeit by 1–2% this time. Companies in high-opportunity industries like health care cut back less than those in more mature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R&D spending were in agriculture production: −3.5% compared to the average R&D to net sales ratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment industry, on the other hand, showed R&D to net sales ratios that were 3.8% and 4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R&D spending increased in 2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth rate of business-funded R&D had recovered. Whether this continues will be contingent on the pursuit of economic recovery and growth, levels of federal research funding and the general business climate.<ref name=":0" />

=== Research spending at the state level ===
{{See also|List of U.S. states by research and development spending}}
The level of research spending varies considerably from one state to another. Six states (New Mexico, Maryland, Massachusetts, Washington, California and Michigan) each devoted 3.9% or more of their GDP to R&D in 2010, together contributing 42% of national research expenditure. In 2010, more than one quarter of R&D was concentrated in California (28.1%), ahead of Massachusetts (5.7%), New Jersey (5.6%), Washington State (5.5%), Michigan (5.4%), Texas (5.2%), Illinois (4.8%), New York (3.6%) and Pennsylvania (3.5%). Seven states (Arkansas, Nevada, Oklahoma, Louisiana, South Dakota and Wyoming) devoted less than 0.8% of GDP to R&D.<ref name=":0" />
[[File:Science and engineering in the USA by state, 2010.svg|thumb|Science and engineering in the U.S. by state. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 5.6, based on data from American Association for the Advancement of Science]]
California is home to Silicon Valley, the name given to the area hosting the leading corporations and start-ups in information technology. This state also hosts dynamic biotechnology clusters in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego. The main biotechnology clusters outside California are the cities of Boston/Cambridge, Massachusetts, Maryland, suburban Washington, DC, New York, Seattle, Philadelphia, and Chicago. California supplies 13.7% of all jobs in science and engineering across the country, more than any other state. Some 5.7% of Californians are employed in these fields. This high share reflects a potent combination of academic excellence and a strong business focus on R&D: the prestigious Stanford University and University of California rub shoulders with Silicon Valley, for instance. In much the same way, Route 128 around Boston in the state of Massachusetts is not only home to numerous high-tech firms and corporations but also hosts the renowned Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<ref name=":0" />

New Mexico's high research intensity can be explained by the fact that it hosts the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Maryland's position may reflect the concentration of federally funded research institutions there. Washington State has a high concentration of high-tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon and Boeing and the engineering functions of most automobile manufacturers are located in the state of Michigan.<ref name=":0" />

=== Research spending by multinational corporations ===
The federal government and most of the 50 states that make up the United States offer tax credits to particular industries and companies to encourage them to engage in research and development (R&D). Congress usually renews a tax credit every few years. According to a survey by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2012, companies do not factor in these credits when making decisions about investing in R&D, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.<ref name=":0" />

In 2014, four U.S. multinational corporations figured in the Top 50 for the volume of expenditure on R&D: Microsoft, Intel, Johnson & Johnson and Google. Several have figured in the Top 20 for at least ten years: Intel, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and IBM. Google was included in this table for the first time in 2013.<ref name=":0" />

=== Exports of high-tech goods and patents ===
[[File:High-tech exports from the USA as a world share, 2008–2013.svg|thumb|High-tech exports from the U.S. as a percentage of the world share, 2008–2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 5.10, based on Comtrade database]]
The United States has lost its world leadership for high-tech goods. Even computing and communications equipment is now assembled in China and other emerging economies, with high-tech value-added components being produced elsewhere. Until 2010, the United States was a net exporter of pharmaceuticals but, since 2011, it has become a net importer of these goods.

The United States is a post-industrial country. Imports of high-tech products far exceed exports. However, the United States' technologically skilled workforce produces a large volume of patents and can still profit from the license or sale of these patents. Within the United States' scientific industries active in research, 9.1% of products and services are concerned with the licensing of intellectual property rights.<ref name=":0" />

When it comes to trade in intellectual property, the United States remains unrivalled. Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2 billion in 2013, the highest in the world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of $31.6 billion in 2013. The United States' payments for use of intellectual property amounted to $39.0 billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4 billion).<ref name=":0" />

Because of the influential role that the U.S. stock market plays in [[international finance]], a [[New York University]] study in late 2014 interprets that in the short run, stocks that affect the willingness to bear risk independently of macroeconomic fundamentals explain most of the variation in the U.S. stock market. In the long run, the U.S. stock market is profoundly affected by shocks that reallocate the rewards of a given level of production between workers and shareholders. Productivity shocks, however, play a small role in historical stock market fluctuations at all horizons in the U.S. stock market.<ref>[http://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/ludvigsons/osf.pdf Origins of Stock Market Fluctuations]. [[New York University]], December 16, 2014.</ref>

The U.S. [[finance industry]] comprised only 10% of total non-farm business profits in 1947, but it grew to 50% by 2010. Over the same period, finance industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance industry's proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20%. The mean earnings per employee hour in finance relative to all other sectors has closely mirrored the share of total U.S. income earned by the top 1% income earners since 1930. The mean salary in New York City's finance industry rose from $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in 2011, while average New York City salaries rose from $40,000 to $70,000. In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with less than $300 million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by 2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300 million in deposits in the U.S., and over 1,800 with more.

A 2012 [[International Monetary Fund]] study concluded that the U.S. financial sector has grown so large that it is slowing [[economic growth]]. New York University economist [[Thomas Philippon]] supported those findings, estimating that the U.S. spends $300 billion too much on financial services per year, and that the sector needs to shrink by 20%. Harvard University and University of Chicago economists agreed, calculating in 2014 that workers in research and development add $5 to the GDP for each dollar they earn, but finance industry workers cause the GDP to shrink by $0.60 for every dollar they are paid.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tankersley|first1=Jim|title=A black hole for our best and brightest|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2014/12/16/a-black-hole-for-our-best-and-brightest/|access-date=December 23, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=December 16, 2014}}</ref> A study by the [[Bank for International Settlements]] reached similar conclusions, saying the finance industry impedes economic growth and research and development based industries.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cecchetti|first1=Stephen G|last2=Kharroubi|first2=Enisse|title=Why does financial sector growth crowd out real economic growth?|url=http://www.bis.org/publ/work490.pdf|website=BIS Working Papers No 490|publisher=Bank for International Settlements|access-date=20 September 2015}}</ref>
