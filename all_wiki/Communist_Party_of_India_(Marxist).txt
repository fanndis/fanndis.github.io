The '''Communist Party of India (Marxist)''' ('''CPI (M)''') is a [[communist]] [[List of political parties in India|political party]] in [[India]].<ref name="OUP_Ideology">{{cite book |last1=Chakrabarty |first1=Bidyut |date= 2014|title=Communism in India: Events, Processes and Ideologies |url= |location= |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|page= 314 |isbn=978-0-199-97489-4 |author-link=}}</ref> It is one of the [[List of political parties in India#National parties|national parties]] of India.<ref name=":0" /> The party emerged from a split from the [[Communist Party of India]] in 1964. The CPI(M) was formed in [[Calcutta]] from 31 October to 7 November 1964.

As of 2020, CPI(M) is leading the state government in [[Kerala]] and has representation in the following Legislative assemblies in the states of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Bihar]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Odisha]] and [[Maharashtra]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.timesnownews.com/elections/rajasthan-election |title=RAJASTHAN ELECTION RESULTS 2018 |access-date=12 December 2018 |date=28 November 2014 }}</ref> The Politburo is the supreme organ of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).<ref name="cpim-const">{{cite web |url=https://cpim.org/party-constitution |title=Party Constitution {{!}} Communist Party of India (Marxist) |date=18 March 2009 |access-date=17 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200317152952/https://cpim.org/party-constitution |archive-date=17 March 2020}}</ref> However, in between two party congresses, the Central Committee is the highest decision making body.<ref name="cpim-const" />
{{Communist Parties}}

==History==
The Communist Party of India (Marxist) emerged from a division within the  [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI), which was formed on 26 December 1925.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/communistparty.in/cpi/brief-history-of-cpi|title=Brief History of CPI - CPI|publisher=|access-date=1 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209001241/https://sites.google.com/a/communistparty.in/cpi/brief-history-of-cpi|archive-date=9 December 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> The CPI had experienced a period of upsurge during the years following the [[Second World War]]. The CPI led armed rebellions in [[Telangana Rebellion|Telangana]], [[Tripura (princely state)|Tripura]], and [[Kerala]]. However, it soon abandoned the strategy of armed revolution in favour of working within the [[parliamentary]] framework. In 1950, [[B. T. Ranadive]], the CPI general secretary and a prominent representative of the radical sector inside the party, was demoted on grounds of left-adventurism.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Under the government of the [[Indian National Congress]] party of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], independent India developed close relations and a strategic partnership with the [[Soviet Union]]. The Soviet government consequently wished that the Indian communists moderate their criticism towards the Indian state and assume a supportive role towards the Congress governments. However, large sections of the CPI claimed that India remained a semi-[[feudal]] country, and that [[class struggle]] could not be put on the back-burner for the sake of guarding the interests of Soviet trade and foreign policy.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} Moreover, the Indian National Congress appeared to be generally hostile towards political competition. In 1959 the central government intervened to impose [[President's Rule]] in Kerala, toppling the [[E.M.S. Namboodiripad]] cabinet (the sole non-Congress state government in the country).{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

===Formation of CPI(M)===
{{main|1964 split in the Communist Party of India}}
The basis of difference in opinion between the two factions in CPI was ideological – about the assessment of Indian scenario and the development of a party programme. This difference in opinion was also a reflection of a [[Sino-Soviet split|similar difference at international level on ideology]] between the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Chinese Communist Party|Chinese]] parties. The alleged 'right wing' inside the party followed the Soviet path <ref>https://m.timesofindia.com/india/CIA-papers-trace-split-of-Indian-Communists/articleshow/2162923.cms</ref> where as the 'left wing' wanted to follow the Chinese principle of a [[Mass line|mass party with a class line]] with national characteristics. Moreover, the faction of CPI which later became CPI(M) referred to the "right" strategy as a national approach of class collaboration, a damning charge within the communist movement where the prioritization of working class interests and independence is considered paramount.<ref>https://m.timesofindia.com/india/CIA-papers-trace-split-of-Indian-Communists/articleshow/2162923.cms</ref><ref>https://www.leftclicknews.com/news/lessons-to-be-learnt-from-the-india-china-war-1962</ref>
It was this ideological difference which later intensified, coupled with the Soviet-Chinese split at the international level and ultimately gave birth to CPI(M).<ref name=kozhikkodepartycongress>{{cite web|url=http://www.kozhikodepartycongress.org/kerala-cpim-history.php|title=Communist Party in Kerala|publisher=CPI(M)|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314030901/http://www.kozhikodepartycongress.org/kerala-cpim-history.php|archivedate=14 March 2012}}</ref>

Hundreds of CPI leaders, accused of being pro-Chinese, were imprisoned. Thousands of Communists were detained without trial.<ref>The bulk of the detainees came from the left wing of the CPI. However, [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] of the [[Socialist Unity Centre of India]] and the [[Workers Party of India]] were also targeted.[http://www.ganashakti.com/archive/left_unity.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017160748/http://www.ganashakti.com/archive/left_unity.htm |date=17 October 2007 }}</ref><ref>https://m.timesofindia.com/india/CIA-papers-trace-split-of-Indian-Communists/articleshow/2162923.cms</ref>

In 1962 [[Ajoy Ghosh]], the general secretary of the CPI, died. After his death, [[S.A. Dange]] was installed as the party chairman (a new position) and E.M.S. Namboodiripad as general secretary. This was an attempt to achieve a compromise.

At a CPI National Council meeting held on 11 April 1964, 32 Council members walked out. <ref>The 32 were [[P. Sundarayya]], [[M. Basavapunniah]], [[T. Nagi Reddy]], [[Moturu Hanumantha Rao|M.

The leftist section, to which the 32 National Council members belonged, organised a convention in [[Tenali]], Andhra Pradesh 7 to 11 July. In this convention the issues of the internal disputes in the party were discussed. 146 delegates, claiming to represent 100,000 CPI members, took part in the proceedings. The convention decided to convene the 7th Party Congress of CPI in [[Calcutta]] later the same year.<ref name="basu51">Basu, Pradip. Towards Naxalbari (1953–1967) – An Account of Inner-Party Ideological Struggle. Calcutta: Progressive Publishers, 2000. p. 51.</ref>

Marking a difference from the official sector of CPI, the Tenali convention was marked by the display of a large portrait of the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] leader [[Mao Zedong]].<ref name="basu51"/>

At the Tenali convention a Bengal-based pro-Chinese group, representing one of the most radical streams of the CPI left wing, presented a draft programme proposal of their own. These radicals criticised the draft programme proposal prepared by [[M. Basavapunniah]] for undermining [[class struggle]] and failing to take a clear pro-Chinese position in the ideological conflict between the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) and the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CPC).<ref>Suniti Kumar Ghosh was a member of the group that presented this alternative draft proposal. His grouping was one of several left tendencies in the Bengali party branch. Basu, Pradip. ''Towards Naxalbari (1953–1967) – An Account of Inner-Party Ideological Struggle''. [[Calcutta]]: Progressive Publishers, 2000. p. 32.</ref>

After the Tenali convention the CPI left wing organised party district and state conferences. In [[West Bengal]], a few of these meetings became battlegrounds between the most radical elements and the more moderate leadership. At the Calcutta Party District Conference an alternative draft programme was presented to the leadership by Parimal Das Gupta (a leading figure amongst far-left intellectuals in the party). Another alternative proposal was brought forward to the Calcutta Party District Conference by [[Aziz ul Haq]], but Haq was initially banned from presenting it by the conference organisers. At the Calcutta Party District Conference 42 delegates opposed M. Basavapunniah's official draft programme proposal.<ref name=pb1/>

At the Siliguri Party District Conference, the main draft proposal for a party programme was accepted, but with some additional points suggested by the far-left North Bengal cadre [[Charu Majumdar]]. However, [[Harekrishna Konar]] (representing the leadership of the CPI left wing) forbade the raising of the slogan ''Mao Tse-Tung Zindabad'' (Long live Mao Tse-Tung) at the conference.<ref name=pb1/>

Parimal Das Gupta's document was also presented to the leadership at the West Bengal State Conference of the CPI leftwing. Das Gupta and a few other spoke at the conference, demanding the party ought to adopt the class analysis of the Indian state of the 1951 CPI conference. His proposal was, however, voted down.<ref name=pb1>Basu, Pradip. Towards Naxalbari (1953–1967) – An Account of Inner-Party Ideological Struggle. [[Calcutta]]: Progressive Publishers, 2000. p. 52-54.</ref>

The Calcutta Congress was held between 31 October and 7 November, at Tyagraja Hall in southern [[Calcutta]]. Simultaneously, the CPI convened a Party Congress of in [[Bombay]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} The group which assembled in Calcutta would later adopt the name 'Communist Party of India (Marxist)', to differentiate themselves from the CPI. The CPI(M) also adopted its own political programme. [[P. Sundarayya]] was elected general secretary of the party.<ref>https://m.timesofindia.com/india/CIA-papers-trace-split-of-Indian-Communists/articleshow/2162923.cms</ref><ref>https://www.leftclicknews.com/news/lessons-to-be-learnt-from-the-india-china-war-1962</ref>

In total 422 delegates took part in the Calcutta Congress. CPI(M) claimed that they represented 104,421 CPI members, 60% of the total party membership.<ref>{{cite book|title=Peking Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6StOodgop4C|year=1965|publisher=Peking review|page=17}}</ref>

At the Calcutta conference the party adopted a class analysis of the character of the Indian state, that claimed the Indian [[bourgeoisie]] was increasingly collaborating with [[imperialism]].<ref name=autogenerated2>Basu, Pradip. Towards Naxalbari (1953–1967) – An Account of Inner-Party Ideological Struggle. [[Calcutta]]: Progressive Publishers, 2000. p. 54.</ref>

Parimal Das Gupta's alternative draft programme was not circulated at the Calcutta conference. However, [[Souren Basu]], a delegate from the far-left stronghold [[Darjeeling]], spoke at the conference asking why no portrait had been raised of Mao Tse-Tung along the portraits of other communist stalwarts. His intervention met with huge applause from conference delegates.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

===Name===
CPI(M) is officially known as भारत की कम्युनिस्ट पार्टी मार्क्सवादी (''Bharat ki Kamyunist Party Marksvadi'') in Hindi, but it is often known as मार्क्सवादी कम्युनिस्ट पार्टी (''Marksvadi Kamyunist Party'', abbreviated ''MaKaPa'') in press and media circles. During its initial years after the split, the party was often referred by different names such as 'Left Communist Party' or 'Communist Party of India (Left)'. The party has used the name 'Left' because CPI people were dubbed as rightist in nature for their support to Congress-Nehru regime. During the Kerala Legislative Assembly elections of 1965, the party adopted the name '[https://www.indianexitpoll.com/political-party/communist-party-of-india-marxist-cpi-m/ Communist Party of India (Marxist)]' and applied to obtain its election symbol from the Election Commission of India.<ref>[[Jyoti Basu|Basu, Jyoti]].

===Early years of CPI(M)===
The CPI (M) was born into a hostile political climate. At the time of the holding of its Calcutta Congress, large sections of its leaders and cadres were jailed without trial. Again on 29–30 December, over a thousand CPI (M) cadres were arrested and detained, and held in jail without trial.<ref name=rao17/> In 1965 new waves of arrests of CPI(M) cadres took place in [[West Bengal]], as the party launched agitations against the rise in fares in the [[Calcutta Tramways]] and against the then prevailing food crisis. Statewide general strikes and [[hartal]]s were observed on 5 August 1965, 10–11 March 1966 and 6 April 1966.<ref name=rao17/> The March 1966 general strike resulted in several deaths during confrontations with police forces.<ref name=rao17/>

Also in Kerala, mass arrests of CPI(M) cadres were carried out during 1965. In [[Bihar]], the party called for a ''[[hartal|Bandh]]'' (general strike) in [[Patna]] on 9 August 1965 in protest against the Congress state government.<ref name=rao17/> During the strike, police resorted to violent actions against the organisers of the strike. The strike was followed by agitations in other parts of the state.<ref name=rao17/>

P. Sundaraiah, after being released from jail, spent the period of September 1965 – February 1966 in Moscow for medical treatment. In Moscow he also held talks with the CPSU.<ref name=rao17>M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. ''Communist Parties and United Front – Experience in Kerala and West Bengal''. [Hyderabad, India]: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 17-18</ref>

The Central Committee of CPI(M) held its first meeting on 12–19 June 1966. The reason for delaying the holding of a regular CC meeting was the fact that several of the persons elected as CC members at the Calcutta Congress were jailed at the time.<ref>The jailed members of the new CC, at the time of the Calcutta Congress, were [[B.T. Ranadive]], Muzaffar Ahmed, Hare Krishna Konar and Promode Das Gupta. Source: Bose, Shanti Shekar; A Brief Note on the Contents of Documents of the Communist Movement in India. Kolkata: 2005, National Book Agency, p. 44-5.</ref> A CC meeting had been scheduled to have been held in [[Trichur]] during the last days of 1964, but had been cancelled due to the wave of arrests against the party. The meeting discussed tactics for electoral alliances, and concluded that the party should seek to form a broad electoral alliances with all non-reactionary opposition parties in West Bengal (i.e. all parties except Jan Sangh and Swatantra Party). This decision was strongly criticised by the [[Communist Party of China]], the [[Party of Labour of Albania]], the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]] and the radicals within the party itself. The line was changed at a National Council meeting in [[Jullunder]] in October 1966, where it was decided that the party should only form alliances with select left parties.<ref>M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. ''Communist Parties and United Front – Experience in Kerala and West Bengal''.[Hyderabad, India]: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 234-235.</ref>

===Naxalbari uprising===
{{main|Naxalite}}
At this point the party stood at crossroads. There were radical sections of the party who were wary of the increasing parliamentary focus of the party leadership, especially after the electoral victories in West Bengal and Kerala. Developments in China also affected the situation inside the party. In West Bengal two separate internal dissident tendencies emerged, which both could be identified as supporting the Chinese line.<ref>According to Basu (in Basu, Pradip; Towards Naxalbari (1953–67) : An Account of Inner-Party Ideological Struggle. Calcutta: Progressive Publishers, 2000.) there were two nuclei of radicals in the party organisation in West Bengal. One "theorist" section around Parimal Das Gupta in Calcutta, which wanted to persuade the party leadership to correct revisionist mistakes through inner-party debate, and one "actionist" section led by [[Charu Majumdar]] and [[Kanu Sanyal]] in North Bengal. The 'actionists' were impatient, and strived to organize armed uprisings. According to Basu, due to the prevailing political climate of youth and student rebellion it was the 'actionists' which came to dominate the new Maoist movement in India, instead of the more theoretically advanced sections. This dichotomy is however rebuffed by followers of the radical stream, for example the [http://www.cpiml.org/liberation/year_2001/october/charu.htm CPI(ML) Liberation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013802/http://www.cpiml.org/liberation/year_2001/october/charu.htm|date=27 September 2007}}.</ref>

In 1967 a peasant uprising broke out in [[Naxalbari]], in northern West Bengal. The insurgency was led by hardline district-level CPI(M) leaders [[Charu Majumdar]] and [[Kanu Sanyal]]. The hardliners within CPI(M) saw the Naxalbari uprising as the spark that would ignite the Indian revolution. The Communist Party of China hailed the Naxalbari movement, causing an abrupt break in CPI(M)-CPC relations.<ref>On 1 July ''[[People's Daily]]'' carried an article titled [http://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/peoples-daily/1967/07/05.htm Spring Thunder Over India] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223115803/http://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/peoples-daily/1967/07/05.htm |date=23 February 2007 }}, expressing the support of CPC to the Naxalbari rebels. At its meeting in [[Madurai]] on 18–27 August 1967, the Central Committee of CPI(M) adopted a resolution titled 'Resolution on Divergent Views Between Our Party and the Communist Party of China on Certain Fundamental Issues of Programme and Policy'. Source: Bose, Shanti Shekar; A Brief Note on the Contents of Documents of the Communist Movement in India. Kolkata: 2005, National Book Agency, p. 46.</ref>

The Naxalbari movement was violently repressed by the West Bengal government, of which CPI(M) was a major partner. Within the party, the hardliners rallied around an [[All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} Following the 1968 [[Burdwan]] plenum of CPI(M) (held on 5–12 April 1968), the AICCCR separated themselves from CPI(M).{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} This split divided the party throughout the country. But notably in West Bengal, which was the centre of the violent radicalist stream, no prominent leading figure left the party. The party and the [[Naxalite]]s (as the rebels were called) were soon to get into a bloody feud.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

In Andhra Pradesh another revolt was taking place. There the pro-Naxalbari dissidents had not established any presence. But in the party organisation there were many veterans from the Telangana armed struggle, who rallied against the central party leadership. In Andhra Pradesh the radicals had a strong base even amongst the state-level leadership. The main leader of the radical tendency was [[T. Nagi Reddy]], a member of the state legislative assembly. On 15 June 1968 the leaders of the radical tendency published a press statement outlining the critique of the development of CPI(M). It was signed by T. Nagi Reddy, D.V. Rao, Kolla Venkaiah and [[Chandra Pulla Reddy]].<ref>This press statement was reproduced in full in the central CPI(M) publication, People's Democracy, on 30 June. P. Sundarayya and M. Basavapunniah, acting on behalf of the Polit Bureau of CPI(M), formulated a response to the statement on 16 June, titled 'Rebuff the Rebels, Uphold Party Unity'. Source: Bose, Shanti Shekar; A Brief Note on the Contents of Documents of the Communist Movement in India. Kolkata: 2005, National Book Agency, p. 48.</ref>

In total around 50% of the party cadres in Andhra Pradesh left the party to form the [[Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries]], under the leadership of T. Nagi Reddy.<ref>Some perceive that the Chinese leadership severely misjudged the actual conditions of different Indian factions at the time, giving their full support to the Majumdar-Sanyal group whilst keeping the Andhra Pradesh radicals (that had a considerable mass following) at distance.</ref>

===Dismissal of United Front governments in West Bengal and Kerala===
<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:United Front government.JPG|150px|thumbnail|United Front government]] -->
In November 1967, the West Bengal United Front government was dismissed by the central government. Initially the Indian National Congress formed a minority government led by [[Prafulla Chandra Ghosh]], but that cabinet did not last long. Following the proclamation that the United Front government had been dislodged, a 48-hour hartal was effective throughout the state.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} After the fall of the Ghosh cabinet, the state was put under President's Rule. CPI(M) launched agitations against the interventions of the central government in West Bengal.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The 8th Party Congress of CPI(M) was held in [[Cochin]], Kerala, on 23–29 December 1968. On 25 December 1968, whilst the congress was held, 42 [[Dalit]]s were [[Kilvenmani massacre|burned alive]] in the [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil]] village of [[Kizhavenmani]]. The massacre was a retaliation from landlords after Dalit labourers had taken part in a CPI(M)-led agitation for higher wages.<ref>[http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1712/17121050.htm Dalits and land issues<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223113220/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1712/17121050.htm|date=23 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nhrc.nic.in/Publications/NHRCJournal2002.pdf|title=Untitled-1<!-- Bot generated title -->|access-date=27 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023515/http://nhrc.nic.in/Publications/NHRCJournal2002.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>

The United Front government in Kerala was forced out of office in October 1969, as the CPI, RSP, KTP and Muslim League ministers resigned. E.M.S. Namboodiripad handed in his resignation on 24 October.<ref>[http://www.kerala.gov.in/knowkerala/political.htm officialwebsite of kerala.gov.in<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060805205314/http://www.kerala.gov.in/knowkerala/political.htm|date=5 August 2006}}</ref> A coalition government led by CPI leader [[C. Achutha Menon]] was formed, with the outside support of the [[Indian National Congress]].

===Elections in West Bengal and Kerala===
Fresh elections were held in West Bengal in 1969. CPI(M) contested 97 seats, and won 80. The party was now the largest in the West Bengal legislative.<ref>Indian National Congress had won 55 seats, Bangla Congress 33 and CPI 30. CPI(M) allies also won several seats.[http://www.eci.gov.in/StatisticalReports/SE_1969/StatReport_WB_69.pdf ECI: Statistical Report on the 1969 West Bengal Legislative Election] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129141351/http://www.eci.gov.in/StatisticalReports/SE_1969/StatReport_WB_69.pdf |date=29 November 2007 }}</ref> But with the active support of CPI and the [[Bangla Congress]], [[Ajoy Mukherjee]] was returned as Chief Minister of the state. Mukherjee resigned on 16 March 1970, after a pact had been reached between CPI, Bangla Congress and the Indian National Congress against CPI(M). CPI(M) strove to form a new government, instead but the central government put the state under President's Rule.

In Kerala, fresh elections were held in 1970. CPI(M) contested 73 seats and won 29. After the election Achutha Menon formed a new ministry, including ministers from the Indian National Congress.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

===Outbreak of war in East Pakistan===
In 1971 [[Bangladesh]] (formerly [[East Pakistan]]) declared its independence from [[Pakistan]]. The Pakistani military tried to quell the uprising. India intervened militarily and gave active backing to the [[Mukti Bahini|Bangladeshi rebels]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} Millions of Bangladeshi refugees sought shelter in India, especially in West Bengal.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

At the time the radical sections of the Bangladeshi communist movement were divided into many [[Political factions|faction]]s. Whilst the pro-Soviet [[Communist Party of Bangladesh]] actively participated in the rebellion, the pro-China communist tendency found itself in a peculiar situation as China had sided with Pakistan in the war. In Calcutta, where many Bangladeshi leftists had sought refuge, CPI(M) worked to co-ordinate the efforts to create a new political organisation. In the fall of 1971 three small groups, which were all hosted by the CPI(M), came together to form the [[Bangladesh Communist Party (Leninist)]]. The new party became the sister party of CPI(M) in Bangladesh.<ref>The same is also true for the [[Workers Party of Bangladesh]], which was formed in 1980 when BCP(L) merged with other groups. Although politically close, WPB can be said to have a more Maoist-oriented profile than CPI(M).</ref>

==Party organisation==
{{See also|Politburo of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)}}
CPI(M) currently has three MPs in Lok Sabha. CPI(M)'s highest tally was in 2004 when it got 5.66% of votes polled in and it had 43 MPs. It won 42.31% on an average in the 69 seats it contested. It supported the new [[Indian National Congress]]-led [[United Progressive Alliance]] government, but without becoming a part of it. On 9 July 2008 it formally withdrew support from the UPA government explaining this by differences about the Indo-US nuclear deal and the IAEA Safeguards Agreement in particular.<ref>article in [[The Hindu]], 9 July 2008: [http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200807091250.htm Left meets President, hands over letter of withdrawal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713070349/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200807091250.htm |date=13 July 2008 }}</ref>

In [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]] it participates in the [[Left Front (Tripura)|Left Front]]. In [[Kerala]] the party is part of the [[Left Democratic Front (Kerala)|Left Democratic Front]]. In [[Tamil Nadu]] it was part of the ruling Democratic Progressive Alliance led by the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK). However, it has since withdrawn support.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Its members in Great Britain are in the electoral front [[Unity for Peace and Socialism]] with the [[Communist Party of Britain]] and the British domiciled sections of the [[Communist Party of Bangladesh]] and the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE). It is standing 13 candidates in the London-wide list section of the [[London Assembly]] elections in May 2008.<ref>[http://ufps.org.uk/{{dead link|date=February 2016}} Unity For Peace and Socialism homepage]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===General Secretaries of CPI(M)===
Article XV, Section 15 of the party constitution says:

<blockquote>"No person can hold the position of the General Secretary for more than three full terms.  Full term means the period between two Party Congresses. In a special situation, a person who has completed three full terms as General Secretary may be re-elected for a fourth term provided it is so decided by the Central Committee with a three-fourth majority. But in no case can that person be elected again for another term in addition to the fourth term."<ref>[http://cpim.org/party-constitution CPI(M) Constitution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315084048/http://cpim.org/party-constitution |date=15 March 2015 }}.</ref></blockquote>

In the 1977 Lok Sabha elections, the CPI(M) had fielded its candidates on 53 seats scattred around in 14 states and union territories of India. It won 4.29% of the average votes polled in this election. The party had won 17 seats from West Bengal, 3 from Maharashtra and one each from Orrissa and Punjab. This election was done shortly after the Emergency imposed by the Indira Gandhi and reflected a wide uproar of masses against her draconian rule. A coalition of Opposition parties was formed against the Congress regime, CPI(M) too supported this coalition by not fielding its candidates against the Janta Party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/LS_1977/Vol_I_LS_77.pdf|title=1977 general elections ECI Report|access-date=27 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718185438/http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/LS_1977/Vol_I_LS_77.pdf|archivedate=18 July 2014}}</ref>

CPI(M) leader and former Chief Minister of Kerala, V.S. Achuthanandan has stated in a TV interview that Bengal defeat was "because of the deviation from party policies and because of its anti-peasant line. Though party tried to correct the mistakes, is not effective enough prevent the downturn."

Nine CPI(M) candidates were elected in the [[2014 Indian general election]], as well as two CPI(M)-supported independents. This is down from the previous number of 16. The national vote share of CPI(M) has also shrunk from 5.33% in 2009 to 3.28% in 2014. This is a 38.5% reduction within a span of 5 years which is consistent with the overall decline of the left in India.<ref>{{Citation|title=Archive of GE 2009 - Performance of National Parties|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/archiveofge2009/Stats/VOLI/12_PerformanceOfNationalParties.pdf|volume=1|year=2009|publisher=[[Election Commission of India]]|access-date=16 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209173959/http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/archiveofge2009/Stats/VOLI/12_PerformanceOfNationalParties.pdf|archive-date=9 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Archive of GE 2014 - Performance of National Parties|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/archiveofge2014/20%20-%20Performance%20of%20National%20Parties.pdf|year=2014|publisher=[[Election Commission of India]]|access-date=16 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215073314/http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/archiveofge2014/20%20-%20Performance%20of%20National%20Parties.pdf|archive-date=15 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=May 2019}} CPI(M) did not win a single seat in Tamil Nadu and its seats went down from 9 to 2 in West Bengal where it is being heavily eroded by [[Mamata Banerjee]] governed [[All India Trinamool Congress|AITMC]]. Kerala is the only state where CPI(M) gained one more seat but this is mainly attributed to splitting of anti-LDF votes between the UDF and emerging NDA. The NDA saw a sharp spike in vote share in decades which came coupled with a sharp decline in UDF votes. {{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Thus, it is assumed that the NDA cut into UDF votes thereby facilitating victory for LDF. This was again mirrored during the [[2016 Kerala Legislative Assembly election]], which saw the NDA getting entry into the State Assembly for the first time as BJP veteran [[O. Rajagopal]] wins the Nemom seat and CPI(M)'s [[Pinarayi Vijayan]] forming the LDF-ruled government.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

===General Elections 2019===

The CPI(M) won only 3 of the 65 seats it contested nationwide in the 2019 General Elections. 1 seat came from Kerala where it is leading the state Government whereas 2 seats from Tamil Nadu where it contested these 2 seats within the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]]-led coalition.<ref>[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/west-bengal/all-but-one-left-front-candidates-lose-security-deposit-in-west-bengal/articleshow/69481742.cms?from=mdr All but one Left Front candidates lose security deposit in West Bengal]</ref>
