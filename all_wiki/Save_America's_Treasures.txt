'''Save America's Treasures''' is a [[United States federal government]] initiative to preserve and protect historic buildings, arts, and published works.  It is a [[public–private partnership]] between the U.S. [[National Park Service]] and the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].  The [[National Endowment for the Arts]], [[Heritage Preservation]], and the [[National Park Foundation]] also are allied.

==History==
Save America's Treasures (SAT) was established by [[Executive Order 13072]] in February 1998 by President [[Bill Clinton]], in conjunction with the [[White House Millennium Council]]'s activities.  Instrumental in its founding was then [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]].<ref>{{cite web|work=New York Times|title=Hillary Clinton Inaugurates Preservation Campaign|author=Patricia Leigh Brown|accessdate=2017-05-20|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/14/us/hillary-clinton-inaugurates-preservation-campaign.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=CSPAN|title='Saving America's Treasures'|access-date=2017-05-20|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?108823-1/saving-americas-treasures}}</ref> Its Honorary Chair is traditionally the First Lady as designated by the [[President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities]] <ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[NEH]]|title=''IMLS ANNOUNCES SAVE AMERICA'S TREASURES GRANT AWARDS''|accessdate=2017-05-20|url=https://www.neh.gov/files/press-release/2009_sat_awards.pdf}}</ref> "Selection criteria require that each project be of national significance, demonstrate an urgent preservation need, have an educational or otherwise clear public benefit, and demonstrate the likely availability of non-federal matching funds. Each grant requires non-federal matching funds, which has stimulated contributions from states, localities, corporations, foundations and individuals who value our shared heritage." <ref name="NPS">{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/news/release.htm?id=163|title=National Park Service and National Endowment for the Arts Announce $13.7 Million in Grants to "Save America's Treasures"|date=September 11, 2001|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=January 19, 2020}}</ref>

On December 9, 2009, First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] said “Save America’s Treasures invests in our nation’s irreplaceable legacy of buildings, documents, collections and artistic works. These awards empower communities all over the country to rescue and restore this priceless heritage, and ensure that future generations continue to learn from the voices, ideas, events and people represented by these projects.”  Despite this initial endorsement, both the Save America's Treasures and the [[Preserve America]] grant programs were later eliminated by the Obama Administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/treasures/ |title=Save America's Treasures Grants |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}</ref> On January 30, 2010, President Barack Obama in his "Tough Choices" FY 2011 Budget proposed eliminating the Save America's Treasures and Preserve America grant programs, stating that "both programs lack rigorous performance metrics and evaluation efforts so the benefits are unclear."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/01/30/tough-choices |title=Tough Choices &#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}</ref> The National Trust for Historic Preservation eliminated its Save America's Treasures office in 2011 during a reorganization.

From 1999 - 2010, over $318 million were awarded and matched by over $400 million from other sources, resulting in the preservation of over 1200 significant historic structures and repositories of cultural heritage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Save America's Treasures Awards 1999-2010 By State|publisher=President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities|url=https://www.pcah.gov/sites/default/files/SAT%20Awards%201999-2010%20Table_2.pdf|accessdate=2017-05-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819205016/https://www.pcah.gov/sites/default/files/SAT%20Awards%201999-2010%20Table_2.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-19}}</ref> As of 2012, the program had been responsible for the creation of about 16,000 jobs.

Funding ceased after 2010 because of concerns about adequate "performance metrics and evaluation efforts” yet resumed in 2017. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://sr.ithaka.org/publications/save-americas-treasures-impact-and-lessons|publisher=Ithaka S + R|title=Save America's Treasures: Impact and Lessons|author=Deanna Marcum|accessdate=January 18, 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://madisoncourier.com/Content/News/News/Article/Preservationists-lament-loss-of-Save-America-s-Treasures-grant-program/178/961/55682|title=Preservationists lament loss of Save America's Treasures grant program|location=Kentucky|publisher=Madison Courier.com|accessdate=January 18, 2020}}</ref>

Monies for the program come from the Historic Preservation Fund (HPF), a source of revenue from federal oil leases that does not expend taxpayer dollars. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.redlakenationnews.com/story/2019/09/23/news/national-park-service-and-partners-announce-126-million-in-save-americas-treasures-grants/83500.html|title=National Park Service and Partners Announce $12.6 Million in Save America's Treasures Grants|publisher=Red lake Nation News|date=September 23, 2019|accessdate=January 19, 2020}}</ref>
