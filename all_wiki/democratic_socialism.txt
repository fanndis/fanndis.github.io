'''Democratic socialism''' is a [[political philosophy]] supporting [[political democracy]] within a [[socially owned]] economy,{{sfnm|1a1=Sinclair|1y=1918|2a1=Busky|2y=2000|2p=7|3a1=Abjorensen|3y=2019|3p=115}} with a particular emphasis on [[economic democracy]], [[workplace democracy]] and [[workers' self-management]]{{sfn|Edelstein|1993}} within a [[market socialist economy]] or some form of a [[decentralised planned]] [[socialist economy]].{{sfn|Anderson|Herr|2007|p=448}} Democratic socialists argue that [[capitalism]] is inherently incompatible with the values of [[freedom]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]] and [[solidarity]] and that these [[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]] can only be achieved through the realisation of a socialist society.{{sfn|Alt|Chambers|Garrett|Kurian|2010|p=401}} Although most democratic socialists seek a gradual transition to [[socialism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Busky|1y=2000|1p=10|2a2=Heywood|2y=2012|2p=97}} democratic socialism can support either [[revolutionary]] or [[reformist]] politics as means to establish socialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Alt|1a2=Chambers|1a3=Garrett|1a4=Kurian|1y=2010|1p=401|2a1=Abjorensen|2y=2019|2p=115}} As a term, ''democratic socialism'' was popularised by social democrats and other socialists who were opposed to the [[authoritarian socialist]] development in Russia and elsewhere during the 20th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=1985|1p=289|2a1=Foley|2y=1994|2p=23|3a1=Eatwell|3a2=Wright|3y=1999|3p=80|4a1=Busky|4y=2000|4pp=7–8}}

The origins of democratic socialism can be traced to 19th-century utopian socialist thinkers and the British [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement that somewhat differed in their goals yet all shared the essence of democratic decision making and [[public ownership]] of the [[means of production]] as positive characteristics of the society they advocated for.{{sfn|Sargent|2008|p=118}} In the late 19th century and early 20th century, democratic socialism was also influenced by social democracy. The [[Gradualism#Politics and society|gradualist]] form of socialism promoted by the British [[Fabian Society]] and [[Eduard Bernstein]]'s [[evolutionary socialism]] in Germany influenced the development of democratic socialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Bernstein|1y=1907|2a1=Cole|2y=1961|3a1=Steger|3y=1997}} Democratic socialism is what most socialists understand by the concept of socialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Sinclair|1y=1918|2a1=Busky|2y=2000|2pp=7–8}} It may be a very broad or more limited concept,{{sfnm|1a1=Hamilton|1y=1989|2a1=Pierson|2y=2005|3a1=Page|3y=2007}} referring to all forms of socialism that are democratic and reject an [[authoritarian]] [[Marxist–Leninist state]].{{sfnm|1a1=Busky|1y=2000|1pp=7–8|2a1=Prychitko|2y=2002|2p=72}} Democratic socialism is a broad label and movement that includes forms of [[libertarian socialism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Draper|1y=1966|1pp=57–84|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|3a1=Hain|3y=2000|3p=118}} [[market socialism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Hain|1y=1995|2a1=Anderson|2a2=Herr|2y=2007|2p=448}} [[reformist socialism]]{{sfn|Alt|Chambers|Garrett|Kurian|2010|p=401}} and [[revolutionary socialism]]{{sfnm|1a1=Draper|1y=1966|1loc="The "Revisionist" Facade", "The 100% American Scene"|2a1=Alt|2a2=Chambers|2a3=Garrett|2a4=Kurian|2y=2010|2p=401}} as well as [[ethical socialism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Dearlove|1a2=Saunders|1y=2000|2a1=Gaus|2a2=Kukathas|2y=2004|2p=420|3a1=Thompson|3y=2006|pp=52–60}} [[liberal socialism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Adams|1y=1999|1p=127|2a1=Gaus|2a2=Kukathas|2y=2004|2p=420}} [[social democracy]]{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=1985|1p=289|2a1=Foley|2y=1994|2p=23|3a1=Eatwell|3a2=Wright|3y=1999|3p=80|4a1=Busky|4y=2000|4pp=7–8|5a1=Sargent|5y=2008|5pp=117–118}} and some forms of [[state socialism]]{{sfn|Busky|2000|p=93}} and [[utopian socialism]].{{sfn|Sargent|2008|p=118}}

Democratic socialism is contrasted to [[Marxism–Leninism]] which those socialists perceive as being authoritarian or undemocratic in practice.{{sfnm|1a1=Eatwell|1a2=Wright|1y=1999|1p=80|2a1=Busky|2y=2000|2pp=7–8|3a1=Prychitko|3y=2002|3p=72}} Democratic socialists oppose the [[Stalinist]] political system and the [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type]] economic system, rejecting the perceived authoritarian form of governance and the centralised [[administrative-command system]] that formed in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[List of socialist states|other Marxist–Leninist states]] during the 20th century.{{sfn|Prychitko|2002|p=72}} Democratic socialism is also distinguished from [[Third Way]] social democracy{{sfn|Whyman|2005|pp=1–5, 61, 215}} on the basis that democratic socialists are committed to systemic transformation of the economy from capitalism to socialism whereas social-democratic supporters of the Third Way were more concerned about challenging the [[New Right]] to win social democracy back to power.{{sfn|Lewis|Surender|2004|pp=3–4, 16}} This has resulted in analysts and democratic socialist critics alike arguing that in effect it endorsed capitalism, even if it was due to recognising that outspoken [[anti-capitalism]] in these circumstances was politically nonviable, or that it was not only anti-socialist and [[neoliberal]], but anti-social democratic in practice.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrientos|1a2=Powell|1y=2004|1pp=9–26|2a1=Cammack|2y=2004|2pp=151–166|3a1=Romano|3y=2006|4a1=Hinnfors|4y=2006|5a1=Lafontaine|5y=2009|6a1=Corfe|6y=2010}} Some maintain this was the result of their type of [[Socialist reformism|reformism]] that caused them to administer the system according to capitalist logic{{sfn|Romano|2007|p=114}} while others saw it as a liberal and modern form of democratic socialism theoretically fitting within market socialism, distinguishing it from classical democratic socialism, especially in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=127}}

While having socialism as a long-term goal,{{sfnm|1a1=Roemer|1y=1994|1pp=25–27|2a1=Berman|2y=1998|2p=57|3a1=Bailey|3y=2009|3p=77|4a1=Lamb|4y=2015|4pp=415–416}} some democratic socialists who follow social democracy are more concerned to curb capitalism's excesses and supportive of [[Progressivism|progressive]] reforms to humanise it in the present day.{{sfnm|1a1=Eatwell|1a2=Wright|1y=1999|1p=80|2a1=Alt|2a2=Chambers|2a3=Garrett|2a4=Kurian|2y=2010|2p=401}} In contrast, other democratic socialists believe that [[economic interventionism]] and similar policy [[reforms]] aimed at addressing [[social inequalities]] and suppressing the [[Criticism of capitalism|economic contradictions of capitalism]] would only exacerbate the contradictions,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1981|2a1=Bardhan|2a2=Roemer|2y=1992|2pp=101–116|3a1=Weisskopf|3y=1994|3pp=297–318}} causing them to emerge elsewhere under a different guise.{{sfnm|1a1=Ticktin|1y=1998|1pp=55–80|2a1=Hinnfors|2y=2006|3a1=Schweickart|3y=2007|3p=447}} Those democratic socialists believe that the fundamental issues with capitalism are systemic in nature and can only be resolved by replacing the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] with the [[socialist mode of production]], i.e. replacing [[private ownership]] with [[collective ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and extending democracy to the economic sphere in the form of [[industrial democracy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eatwell|1a2=Wright|1y=1999|1p=80|2a1=Anderson|2a2=Herr|2y=2007|2p=447|3a1=Schweickart|3y=2007|3p=448|4a1=Alt|4a2=Chambers|4a3=Garrett|4a4=Kurian|4y=2010|4p=401}} The main criticism of democratic socialism concerns the compatibility of democracy and socialism.{{sfn|Barrett|1978}} Academics, political commentators and other scholars tend to distinguish between authoritarian socialism and democratic socialism as a political ideology, with the first representing the [[Soviet Bloc]] and the latter representing the democratic socialist parties in the [[Western Bloc]] countries that have been democratically elected in countries such as Britain, France and Sweden, among others.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1978|2a1=Heilbroner|2y=1991|3a1=Kendall|3y=2011|3pp=125–127|4a1=Li|4y=2015|4pp=60–69}}

Democratic socialism is defined as having a [[socialist economy]] in which the [[means of production]] are [[Socialization (Marxism)|socially]] and [[collectively owned]] or controlled,{{sfn|Edelstein|1993}} alongside a democratic political system of government.{{sfnm|1a1=Sinclair|1y=1918|2a1=Busky|2y=2000|2p=7|3a1=Anderson|3a2=Herr|3y=2007|3pp=445–448|4a1=Abjorensen|4y=2019|4p=115}} Democratic socialists reject most [[self-described socialist state]]s and [[Marxism–Leninism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eatwell|1a2=Wright|1y=1999|1p=80|2a1=Busky|2y=2000|2pp=7–8|3a1=Prychitko|3y=2002|3p=72|4a1=Alt|4a2=Chambers|4a3=Garrett|4a4=Kurian|4y=2010|4p=401}} British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician [[Peter Hain]] classifies democratic socialism along with [[libertarian socialism]] as a form of [[anti-authoritarian]] [[Hal Draper#Legacy|socialism from below]] (using the concept popularised by American socialist activist [[Hal Draper]]){{sfn|Draper|1966|pp=57–84}} in contrast to [[authoritarian socialism]] and [[state socialism]].{{sfn|Hain|2000}} For Hain, this [[authoritarian]] and [[Democracy|democratic]] divide is more important than that between [[Reformist socialism|reformists]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionaries]].{{sfn|Hain|1995}} In democratic socialism, it is the active participation of the population as a whole and workers in particular in the [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] of the economy that characterises socialism{{sfn|Edelstein|1993}} while centralised [[economic planning]]{{sfnm|1a1=Wilhelm|1y=1985|1pp=118–130|2a1=Ellman|2y=2007|2p=22}} coordinated by the state and [[nationalisation]] do not represent socialism in itself.{{sfnm|1a1=Eatwell|1a2=Wright|1y=1999|1p=80|2a1=Busky|2y=2000|2pp=7–8|3a1=Alistair|3a2=Pyper|3y=2000|3p=677|4a1=Prychitko|4y=2002|4p=72|5a1=Alt|5a2=Chambers|5a3=Garrett|5a4=Kurian|5y=2010|5p=401}} A similar, more complex argument is made by [[Nicos Poulantzas]].{{sfn|Poulantzas|1978}} For Draper, revolutionary-democratic socialism is a type of socialism from below, writing in ''[[The Two Souls of Socialism]]'' that "the leading spokesman in the [[Second International]] of a revolutionary-democratic Socialism-from-Below [...] was [[Rosa Luxemburg]], who so emphatically put her faith and hope in the spontaneous struggle of a free working class that the myth-makers invented for her a '[[Revolutionary spontaneity|theory of spontaneity]].'"{{sfn|Draper|1966|loc="The "Revisionist" Facade"}} Similarly, he wrote about [[Eugene V. Debs]] that "'Debsian socialism' evoked a tremendous response from the heart of the people, but Debs had no successor as a tribune of revolutionary-democratic socialism."{{sfn|Draper|1966|loc="The 100% American Scene"}}

Some [[Marxist]] socialists emphasise [[Karl Marx]]'s belief in democracy{{sfnm|1a1=Megill|1y=1970|1p=45|2a1=Draper|2y=1974|2pp=101–124|3a1=Jossa|3y=2010|3pp=335–354|4a1=Sarkar|4y=2019}} and call themselves democratic socialists.{{sfn|Sargent|2008|p=118}} The [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] and the [[World Socialist Movement]] define ''[[Scientific socialism|socialism]]'' in its classical formulation as a "system of society based upon the common ownership and democratic control of the means and instruments for producing and distributing wealth by and in the interest of the community."{{sfn|Barker|2019|loc="Chapter V. The Aims and Policy of the Socialists"}} Additionally, they include classlessness, statelessness and the abolition of [[wage labour]] as characteristics of a socialist society, characterising it as a [[Stateless society|stateless]], [[property]]less, [[Post-capitalism|post-monetary economy]] based on [[calculation in kind]], a [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|free association of producers]], [[workplace democracy]] and free access to [[goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] produced solely for [[Use value|use]] and not for [[Trade|exchange]].{{sfnm|1a1=Socialist Party of Great Britain (Our Object and Declaration of Principles)|2a1=Socialist Party of Great Britain (FAQ)|3a1=Socialist Party of Great Britain (What is Socialism?)}} Although these characteristics are usually reserved to describe a communist society,{{sfn|Marx|1875|loc="Part I"}} this is consistent with the usage of Marx, [[Friedrich Engels]] and others, who referred to ''[[Communist society|communism]]'' and ''[[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]'' interchangeably.{{sfnm|1a1=Steele|1y=1992|1pp=44–45|2a1=Hudis|2a2=Prew|2a3=Rotta|2a4=Smith|2y=2008}}

As a democratic socialist definition, the political scientist [[Lyman Tower Sargent]] states:
{{quote|Democratic socialism can be characterised as follows:
* Much property held by the public through a democratically elected government, including most major industries, utilities, and transportation systems
* A limit on the accumulation of private property
* Governmental regulation of the economy
* Extensive publicly financed assistance and pension programs
* Social costs and the provision of services added to purely financial considerations as the measure of efficiency

Publicly held property is limited to productive property and significant infrastructure; it does not extend to personal property, homes, and small businesses. And in practice in many democratic socialist countries, it has not extended to many large corporations.{{sfn|Sargent|2008|p=117}}}}

Another example is the [[Democratic Socialists of America]] (DSA), with the organisation defining democratic socialism as a decentralised socially-owned economy and rejecting [[Central planning|centralised]], [[Soviet-type economic planning]], stating:
{{quote|Social ownership could take many forms, such as worker-owned cooperatives or publicly owned enterprises managed by workers and consumer representatives. Democratic socialists favour as much decentralisation as possible. While the large concentrations of capital in industries such as energy and steel may necessitate some form of state ownership, many consumer-goods industries might be best run as cooperatives.

Democratic socialists have long rejected the belief that the whole economy should be centrally planned. While we believe that democratic planning can shape major social investments like mass transit, housing, and energy, market mechanisms are needed to determine the demand for many consumer goods.{{sfn|Democratic Socialists of America (FAQ)|loc="Doesn't socialism mean that the government will own and run everything?"}}}}

The DSA has been critical of self-described socialist states, arguing that "[j]ust because their bureaucratic elites called them 'socialist' did not make it so; they also called their regimes 'democratic.'"{{sfn|Democratic Socialists of America (FAQ)|loc="Hasn't socialism been discredited by the collapse of Communism in the USSR and Eastern Europe?"}} While ultimately committed to instituting socialism, the DSA focuses the bulk of its political activities on reforms within capitalism, arguing: "As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people."{{sfn|Democratic Socialists of America (About)}}

Labour Party politician Peter Hain, who identifies with libertarian socialism,{{sfnm|1a1=Hain|1y=1995|2a1=Hain|2y=2000}} gives the following definition:
{{quote|Democratic socialism should mean an active, democratically accountable state to underpin individual freedom and deliver the conditions for everyone to be empowered regardless of who they are or what their income is. It should be complemented by decentralisation and empowerment to achieve increased democracy and social justice. [...]

Today democratic socialism's task is to recover the high ground on democracy and freedom through maximum decentralisation of control, ownership and decision making. For socialism can only be achieved if it springs from below by popular demand. The task of socialist government should be an enabling one, not an enforcing one. Its mission is to disperse rather than to concentrate power, with a pluralist notion of democracy at its heart.{{sfn|Hain|2015|pp=133–148}}}}

[[Tony Benn]], another prominent left-wing Labour Party politician,{{sfnm|1a1=Hall|1y=2011|1p=45|2a1=White|2y=2014}} described democratic socialism as a socialism that is "open, libertarian, pluralistic, humane and democratic; nothing whatever in common with the harsh, centralised, dictatorial and mechanistic images which are purposely presented by our opponents and a tiny group of people who control the mass media in Britain."{{sfn|Benn|Mullin|1979}}

Democratic socialism sometimes represents policies within capitalism as opposed to an ideology that aims to transcend and replace capitalism, although this is not always the case. Robert M. Page, a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in Democratic Socialism and Social Policy at the [[University of Birmingham]], wrote about transformative democratic socialism to refer to the politics of Labour Party [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] and its [[Attlee ministry|government]] ([[Redistribution of income and wealth|fiscal redistribution]], some degree of [[public ownership]] and a strong [[welfare state]]) and revisionist democratic socialism as developed by Labour Party politician Anthony Crosland and Labour Party Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], arguing:
{{quote|The most influential revisionist Labour thinker, Anthony Crosland, contended that a more "benevolent" form of capitalism had emerged since the Second World War. [...] According to Crosland, it was now possible to achieve greater equality in society without the need for "fundamental" economic transformation. For Crosland, a more meaningful form of equality could be achieved if the growth dividend derived from effective management of the economy was invested in "pro-poor" public services rather than through fiscal redistribution.{{sfn|Page|2007}}}}

The [[Socialist International]], of which almost all democratic socialist, labourist and social democratic parties are members, declares the goal of the development of democratic socialism.{{sfn|Busky|2000|p=8}} Some tendencies of democratic socialism advocate for [[social revolution]] in order to transition to [[socialism]], distinguishing it from some forms of [[social democracy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Edelstein|1y=1993|2a1=Alt|2a2=Chambers|2a3=Garrett|2a4=Kurian|2y=2010|2p=401|3a1=Abjorensen|3y=2019|3p=115}} In Soviet politics, democratic socialism is the version of the Soviet Union model that was reformed in a democratic way. Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] described [[perestroika]] as building a "new, humane and democratic socialism."{{sfn|Christensen|1990|pp=123–146}} Consequently, some former [[communist parties]] have rebranded themselves as being democratic socialists.{{sfnm|1a1=Sargent|1y=2008|1p=118|2a1=Lamb|2y=2015|2p=415}} This include parties such as [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] in Germany,{{sfnm|1a1=Borragan|1a2=Cini|1y=2013|1p=387|2a1=Nordsieck|2y=2017}} a party succeeding the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] which was itself the legal successor of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Tangian|2013|p=321}}

==== Overlap with social democracy ====
Democratic socialism has been described as the form of [[social democracy]] prior to the [[displacement of Keynesianism]] by [[neoliberalism]] and [[monetarism]] which caused many social-democratic parties to adopt the [[Third Way]] ideology, accepting [[capitalism]] as the current ''[[status quo]]'' and [[The powers that be (phrase)|powers that be]], redefining [[socialism]] in a way that it maintained the capitalist structure intact.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrientos|1a2=Powell|1y=2004|1pp=9–26|2a1=Cammack|2y=2004|2pp=151–166|3a1=Romano|3y=2006|4a1=Hinnfors|4y=2006|5a1=Lafontaine|5y=2009|6a1=Corfe|6y=2010}} The new version of [[Clause IV]] of the [[Labour Party Constitution]] uses ''democratic socialism'' to describe a modernised form of social democracy.{{sfnm|1a1=Lowe|1y=2004|2a1=Romano|2y=2007|2p=3|3a1=Ludlam|3a2=Smith|3y=2017|3p=3}} While affirming a commitment to democratic socialism,{{sfn|Adams|1998|pp=144–145}} it no longer definitely commits the party to public ownership of industry and in its place advocates "the enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition" along with "high quality public services [...] either owned by the public or accountable to them."{{sfn|Adams|1998|pp=144–145}} Much like modern social democracy, some forms of democratic socialism follow a gradual, reformist or evolutionary path to socialism rather than a revolutionary one,{{sfnm|1a1=Busky|1y=2000|1p=10|2a1=Heywood|2y=2012|2p=97}} a tendency that is captured in the statement of [[Labour revisionist]] [[Anthony Crosland]], who argued that the socialism of the pre-war world was now becoming increasingly irrelevant.{{sfnm|1a1=Hamilton|1y=1989|2a1=Pierson|2y=2005|2pp=145–163}} This tendency is invoked in an attempt to distinguish democratic socialism from [[Marxist–Leninist socialism]] as in [[Norman Thomas]]' ''Democratic Socialism: A New Appraisal'',{{sfn|Thomas|1953}} [[Roy Hattersley]]'s ''Choose Freedom: The Future of Democratic Socialism'',{{sfn|Hattersley|1987}} Malcolm Hamilton's ''Democratic Socialism in Britain and Sweden'',{{sfn|Hamilton|1989}} Jim Tomlinson's ''Democratic Socialism and Economic Policy: The Attlee Years, 1945–1951''{{sfn|Tomlinson|1997}} and Donald F. Busky's ''Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey''.{{sfn|Busky|2000}} A variant of this set of definitions is [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s argument set out in ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'' (1942){{sfn|Schumpeter|1942}} that [[liberal democracies]] were evolving from [[liberal capitalism]] into democratic socialism with the growth of [[industrial democracy]], [[Regulatory agency|regulatory institutions]] and [[Organisational self-management|self-management]].{{sfn|Medearis|1997}}

Democratic socialism has some degree of significant overlaps on practical policy positions with social democracy,{{sfnm|1a1=Denitch|1y=1981|2a1=Picard|2y=1985|3a1=Foley|3y=1994|3p=23|4a1=Busky|4y=2000|4p=8|5a1=Heywood|5y=2012|5p=97|6a1=Sunkara|6y=2020}} although they are often distinguished from each other.{{sfnm|1a1=Edelstein|1y=1993|2a1=Eatwell|2a2=Wright|2y=1999|2p=80|3a1=Eatwell|3a2=Wright|3y=1999|3p=100|4a1=Busky|4y=2000|4p=8|5a1=Anderson|5a2=Herr|5y=2007|6a1=Alt|6a2=Chambers|6a3=Garrett|6a4=Kurian|6y=2010|7a1=Sunkara|7y=2020}} Policies commonly supported by democratic socialists are [[Keynesian]] in nature, including significant [[Regulatory economics|economic regulation]] alongside a [[mixed economy]], extensive [[social insurance]] schemes, generous public [[pension]] programs and a gradual expansion of [[public ownership]] over strategic industries.{{sfn|Sargent|2008|p=117}} Policies such as free, universal [[Universal health care|health care]] and [[Universal education|education]] are described as "pure Socialism" because they are opposed to "the hedonism of capitalist society."{{sfn|Bevan|1952|p=106}} Partly because of this overlap, some political commentators occasionally use the terms interchangeably.{{sfnm|1a1=Sargent|1y=2008|1p=117|2a1=Heywood|2y=2012|2p=97|3a1=Hain|3y=2015|3p=3}} One difference is that modern social democrats tend to reject revolutionary means accepted by more [[Radical politics|radical]] socialists.{{sfn|Abjorensen|2019}} Another difference is that some democratic socialists and social democrats are mainly concerned with practical reforms within capitalism, with socialism relegated to the indefinite future.{{sfnm|1a1=Berman|1y=1998|1p=57|2a1=Bailey|2y=2009|2p=77}} Others want to go beyond mere meliorist reforms and advocate systemic transformation of the [[mode of production]] from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eatwell|1a2=Wright|1y=1999|1p=80|2a1=Anderson|2a2=Herr|2y=2007|2p=447|3a1=Alt|3a2=Chambers|3a3=Garrett|3a4=Kurian|3y=2010|3p=401}}

As social democracy originated as a [[revolutionary socialist]] or [[communist]] movement,{{sfn|Ely|1883|pp=204–205}} one distinction made to separate the modern versions of democratic socialism and social democracy is that the former can include revolutionary means{{sfnm|1a1=Duignan|1a2=Kalsang Bhutia|1a3=Mahajan|1y=2009|2a1=Abjorensen|2y=2019|2p=115}} while the latter asserts that the only acceptable constitutional form of government is [[representative democracy]] under the [[rule of law]].{{sfn|Hinchman|Meyer|2007|p=91}} Many social democrats "refer to themselves as socialists or democratic socialists" and some "use or have used these terms interchangeably."{{sfnm|1a1=O'Reilly|1y=2007|1p=91|2a1=Raza|2y=2012|2p=86|3a1=Gage|3y=2018}} Others argue that "there are clear differences between the three terms, and preferred to describe their own political beliefs by using the term 'social democracy' only."{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=7}} Social democracy is the evolutionary form of democratic socialism that aims to gradually and peacefully achieve socialism through established political processes such as the parliament.{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|2a1=Safra|2y=1998|2p=920|3a1=Stevens|3y=2000|3p=1504|4a1=Duignan|4a2=Kalsang Bhutia|4a3=Mahajan|4y=2014}} In political science, ''democratic socialism'' and ''social democracy'' are largely seen as synonyms and as overlapping or otherwise not being mutually exclusive{{sfnm|1a1=Busky|1y=2000|1p=8|2a1=Sargent|2y=2008|2p=118|3a1=Heywood|3y=2012|3p=97|4a1=Hain|4y=2015|4p=3}} while they are distinguished in journalistic use, in some cases sharply.{{sfnm|1a1=Qiu|1y=2015|2a1=Barro|2y=2015|3a1=Tupy|3y=2016|4a1=Cooper|4y=2018|5a1=Rodriguez|5y=2018|6a1=Levitz, April 2019}} While social democrats continue to call and describe themselves as ''democratic socialists'' or simply ''socialists'',{{sfnm|1a1=O'Reilly|1y=2007|1p=91|2a1=Raza|2y=2012|2p=86|3a1=Gage|3y=2018}} the meaning of ''democratic socialism'' and ''social democracy'' effectively reversed.{{sfn|Eatwell|Wright|1999|loc="Social Democracy and Democratic Socialism"}} ''Democratic socialism'' originally represented socialism achieved by democratic means and usually resulted in reformism whereas ''social democracy'' included both reformist and revolutionary wings.{{sfnm|1a1=Ely|1y=1883|1pp=204–205|2a1=Eatwell|2a2=Wright|2y=1999|2loc="Democratic Socialism and Social Democracy"|3a1=Ludlam|3a2=Smith|3y=2017|3p=5}} With the association of social democracy as policy regime{{sfn|Ludlam|Smith|2017|pp=1–15}} and the development of the Third Way,{{sfnm|1a1=Barrientos|1a2=Powell|1y=2004|1pp=9–26|2a1=Cammack|2y=2004|2pp=151–166|3a1=Romano|3y=2006|4a1=Hinnfors|4y=2006|5a1=Lafontaine|5y=2009|6a1=Corfe|6y=2010}} ''social democracy'' became almost exclusively associated with reformism{{sfnm|1a1=Eatwell|1a2=Wright|1y=1999|1p=80|2a1=Ludlam|2a2=Smith|2y=2017|2p=5}} while ''democratic socialism'' came to include communist and revolutionary tendencies.{{sfnm|1a1=Busky|1y=2000|1pp=8–10|2a1=Sargent|2y=2008|2p=117|3a1=Alt|3a2=Chambers|3a3=Garrett|3a4=Kurian|3y=2010|3p=401|4a1=Abjorensen|4y=2019|4p=115}}

==== Political party ====
While most social-democratic parties describe themselves as ''democratic socialists'', with ''democratic socialism'' representing the theory and ''social democracy'' the practice and vice versa, political scientists distinguish between the two. ''Social democratic'' is used for centre-left socialist parties,{{sfnm|1a1=Considère-Charondu|1y=2010|1p=157|2a1=Staab|2y=2011|2p=67}} "whose aim is the gradual amelioration of poverty and exploitation within a liberal capitalist society."{{sfn|Ludlam|2000|pp=264–276}} On the other hand, ''democratic socialist'' is used for more left-wing socialist parties, including [[left-wing populist]] parties such as [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]], [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] and [[Syriza]].{{sfn|Della Porta|Fernández|Kouki|Mosca|2017}} This is reflected at the European party level, where the centre-left ''social democratic'' parties are within the [[Party of European Socialists]] and the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]] while more left-wing ''democratic socialist'' parties are within the [[Party of the European Left]] and the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left]].{{sfn|Nordsieck|2019}} Aside from democratic socialism, the latter also include communist tendencies and communist parties in democratic socialist orientation.{{sfnm|1a1=Casier|1a2=Jongerden|1y=2010|1p=203|2a1=Trechsel|2y=2013|2p=72}}

According to Steve Ludlam, "the arrival of New Labour signalled an unprecedented and possibly final assault on the party’s democratic socialist tradition, that is to say the tradition of those seeking the transformation of capitalism into socialism by overwhelmingly legislative means. [...] It would be a while before some of the party's social democrats—those whose aim is the gradual amelioration of poverty and exploitation within a liberal capitalist society—began to fear the same threat to Labour's egalitarian tradition as the left recognised to its socialist tradition."{{sfn|Ludlam|2000|pp=264–276}} This was reflected similarly in ''Labour: A Tale of Two Parties'' by Hilary Wainwright.{{sfn|Wainwright|1987}}

According to Andrew Mathers, Hilary Wainwright's 1987 work ''Labour: A Tale of Two Parties'' provided "a different reading which contrasted the 'ameliorative, pragmatic' social democratic tradition expressed principally in the Parliamentary Labour Party with a 'transformative, visionary' democratic socialist tradition associated mainly with the grassroots members engaged closely with extra-parliamentary struggles."{{sfn|Mathers|2017|pp=389–444}}

=== Economics ===
Democratic socialists have promoted a variety of different models of [[socialism]] and [[Socialist economics|economics]], ranging from [[market socialism]] where [[socially owned]] enterprises operate in [[competitive markets]] and are [[Organizational self-management|self-managed]] by their workforce to non-market [[participatory socialism]] based on [[decentralised]] [[economic planning]].{{sfnm|1a1=Prychitko|1y=2002|1p=72|2a1=Anderson|2a2=Herr|2y=2007|2p=448}}

Democratic socialism is also committed to a decentralised form of economic planning where productive units are integrated into a single organisation and organised on the basis of self-management.{{sfn|Prychitko|2002|p=72}} [[Eugene V. Debs]] and [[Norman Thomas]], both of whom were United States presidential candidates for the [[Socialist Party of America]], understood socialism to be an economic system structured upon [[production for use]] and [[social ownership]] in place of the [[Production for profit|for-profit system]] and [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]].{{sfnm|1a1=Debs|1y=1912|2a1=Thomas|2y=1936}}

Democratic socialists and contemporary proponents of market socialism have argued that rather than socialism itself, the major reason for the economic shortcomings of [[Soviet-type economies]] were [[command economies]]. Their [[administrative-command system]] caused their failure to create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of state enterprises in their hierarchical allocation of resources and commodities and the lack of democracy in the political systems that the Soviet-type economies were combined with.{{sfn|Gregory|Stuart|2003|p=152}}

==== Democratic planning ====
A democratic [[planned economy]] has been proposed as a basis for socialism and variously advocated by some democratic socialists who support a non-market form of socialism whilst rejecting [[Soviet-type central planning]]. It has been argued that [[decentralised planning]] allows for a spontaneously self-regulating system of stock control (relying solely on [[calculation in kind]]) to come about and that in turn decisively overcomes the objections raised by the [[economic calculation argument]] that any large scale economy must necessarily resort to a system of market prices.{{sfn|Schweickart|2007|p=448}}

This form of [[economic planning]] implies some process of democratic and participatory decision-making within the economy and within firms itself in the form of [[industrial democracy]]. Computer-based forms of democratic economic planning and coordination between economic enterprises have also been proposed by various [[computer scientists]] and [[Radical politics|radical]] economists.{{sfnm|1a1=Lange|1y=1979|2a1=Cockshott|2a2=Cottrell|2y=1993|3a1=Medina|3y=2006|3pp=571–606}} Proponents present democratic or decentralized and participatory economic planning as an alternative to [[market socialism]] for a [[post-capitalist]] society.{{sfn|Kotz|2008}}

==== Market socialism ====
Some proponents of [[market socialism]] see it as an economic system compatible with the political ideology of democratic socialism.{{sfn|Miller|1990}} Advocates of market socialism such as [[Jaroslav Vaněk]] argue that genuinely free markets are impossible under conditions of [[private ownership]] of [[productive property]]. Vaněk contends that the [[class differences]] and [[unequal distribution of income]] and [[economic power]] that result from private ownership of industry enable the interests of the dominant class to skew the [[Market (economics)|market]] in their favour, either in the form of [[monopoly]] and [[market power]], or by utilising their [[wealth]] and [[resources]] to legislate government policies that benefit their specific business interests. Additionally, Vaněk states that workers in a socialist economy based on cooperative and self-managed enterprises have stronger incentives to maximise productivity because they would receive a share of the profits based on the overall performance of their enterprise, plus their fixed wage or salary.{{sfn|Perkins|2016}} Many [[pre-Marx socialists]] and [[proto-socialists]] were fervent anti-capitalists just as they were supporters of the free market, including the British philosopher [[Thomas Hodgskin]], the French [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] thinker and [[anarchist]] philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and the American philosophers [[Benjamin Tucker]] and [[Lysander Spooner]], among others.{{sfn|Braudel|1979}} Although capitalism has been commonly conflated with the free market, there is a similar ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic theory and system associated with socialism called [[left-wing laissez-faire]]{{sfnm|1a1=Manley 2014 (Part One)|2a1=Manley 2014 (Part Two)}} to distinguish it from [[laissez-faire capitalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carson|1y=2009|2a1=Chartier|2a2=Johnson|2y=2011}}

One example of this democratic market socialist tendency is mutualism, a democratic and libertarian socialist theory developed by Proudhon in the 18th century, from which [[individualist anarchism]] emerged. Benjamin Tucker is one eminent [[American individualist anarchist]], who adopted a [[laissez-faire socialist]] system he termed [[anarchistic socialism]] as opposed to [[state socialism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Tucker|1y=1972|2a1=Brown|2y=1997|2p=107}} This tradition has been recently associated with contemporary scholars such as [[Kevin Carson]],{{sfnm|1a1=Carson|1y=2008|2a1=Carson|2y=2010}} [[Gary Chartier]],{{sfn|Chartier|2009}} Charles W. Johnson,{{sfn|Johnson|2008|pp=155–188}} [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]],{{sfnm|1a1=Long|1y=2012|1p=227}} [[Roderick T. Long]],{{sfnm|1a1=Long|1y=2000|2a1=Kuskowski|2y=2008}} Sheldon Richman,{{sfnm|1a1=Richman|1y=2009|2a1=Richman|2y=2010|3a1=Richman|3y=2011}} [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]]{{sfn|Sciabarra|2000}} and Brad Spangler,{{sfn|Spangler|2006}} who stress the value of radically free markets, termed ''[[freed market]]s'' to distinguish them from the common conception which these [[left-libertarians]] believe to be riddled with [[statism]] and [[bourgeois]] privileges.{{sfn|Gillis|2011|pp=19–20}}

Referred to as left-wing market anarchists{{sfnm|1a1=Chartier|1a2=Johnson|1y=2011|2a1=Zwolinski|2y=2013}} or market-oriented left-libertarians,{{sfn|Richman|2011}} Proponents of this approach strongly affirm the [[classical liberal]] ideas of [[self-ownership]] and [[free markets]] while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support [[anti-capitalist]], [[anti-corporatist]], [[Social stratification|anti-hierarchical]] and [[pro-labour]] positions in economics, [[anti-imperialism]] in foreign policy and radically progressive views regarding sociocultural issues such as gender, sexuality and race.{{sfnm|1a1=Chartier|1a2=Johnson|1y=2011|2a1=Richman|2y=2011|3a1=Zwolinski|3y=2013}} Echoing the language of these market socialists, they maintain that radical market anarchism should be seen by its proponents and by others as part of the socialist tradition because of its heritage, emancipatory goals and potential and that market anarchists can and should call themselves socialists.{{sfnm|1a1=Chartier 2009 (Socialist Ends, Market Means)|2a1=Chartier|2y=2010|3a1=Chartier 2010 (Speech)}} Critics of the free market and ''laissez-faire'' as commonly understood argue that socialism is fully compatible with a [[Market socialist economy|market economy]] and that a truly free-market or ''laissez-faire'' system would be anti-capitalist and socialist in practice.{{sfnm|1a1=Manley 2014 (Part One)|2a1=Manley 2014 (Part Two)}}

According to its supporters, this would result in the society as advocated by democratic socialists, when socialism is not understood as state socialism and conflated with [[self-described socialist state]]s{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=2009|1p=95|2a1=Stossel|2y=2010|3a1=Kristof|3y=2011|4a1=Salsman|4y=2011|5a1=Chartier|5y=2018}} and the free market and ''laissez-faire'' are understood to mean as being free from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies and artificial scarcities.{{sfnm|1a1=Carson|1y=2009|2a1=Chartier|2a2=Johnson|2y=2011}} This is consistent with the [[classical economics]] view that [[economic rents]], i.e. profits generated from a lack of [[perfect competition]], must be reduced or eliminated as much as possible through free competition rather than free from regulation.{{sfn|Popper|1994}} [[David McNally (professor)|David McNally]], a professor at the [[University of Houston]], has argued in the Marxist tradition that the logic of the [[Market (economics)|market]] inherently produces [[social inequality]] and leads to [[unequal exchange]]s, writing that [[Adam Smith]]'s moral intent and moral philosophy espousing equal exchange was undermined by the practice of the free market he championed as the development of the market economy involved coercion, exploitation and violence that Smith's moral philosophy could not counteract. McNally criticises market socialists for believing in the possibility of fair markets based on equal exchanges to be achieved by purging parasitical elements from the market economy such as private ownership of the means of production, arguing that market socialism is an oxymoron when socialism is defined as an end to [[wage labour]].{{sfn|McNally|1993}}

=== Implementation ===
While ''socialism'' is commonly used to describe Marxism–Leninism and affiliated states and governments, there have also been several [[List of anarchist communities|anarchist]] and [[List of socialist states#Ephemeral|socialist]] societies that followed democratic socialist principles, encompassing [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] and democratic [[anti-capitalism]].{{sfn|Waxman|2018}} The most notable historical examples are the [[Paris Commune]], the various [[Soviet republic (system of government)|soviet republics]] established in the post-World War I period, early Soviet Russia before the abolition of [[Soviet (council)|soviet councils]] by the [[Bolsheviks]], [[Revolutionary Catalonia]] as noted by [[George Orwell]]{{sfn|Orwell|1980|pp=4–6}} and more recently [[Rojava]] in northern [[Syria]].{{sfn|Ramnath|2019|p=691}} Other examples include the [[kibbutzim]] in modern-day [[Israel]],{{sfn|Goldenberg|Wekerle|1972|pp=224–232}} [[Marinaleda]] in [[Spain]],{{sfn|Hancox|2013}} the [[Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities|Zapatistas]] of [[EZLN]] in [[Chiapas]]{{sfnm|1a1=Esteva|1y=2013|2a1=Vidal|2y=2018}} and to some extent the [[workers' self-management]] policies within the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and [[Cuba]].{{sfn|Al Jazeera|2019}} However, the best-known example is that of [[Presidential Republic (1925–1973)|Chile]] under [[President of Chile|President]] [[Salvador Allende]],{{sfnm|1a1=Mabry|1y=1975|2a1=BBC|2y=2003|3a1=Patsouras|3y=2005|3p=265|5a1=Winn|5y=2004|5p=16}} who was violently overthrown in a [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|military coup]] funded and backed by the [[CIA]] in 1973.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=7}}

When [[nationalisation]] of large industries was relatively widespread during the [[Keynesian]] [[post-war consensus]], it was not uncommon for some political commentators to describe several European countries as democratic socialist states seeking to move their countries toward a [[socialist economy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1978|2a1=Heilbroner|2y=1991|2pp=96–110|3a1=Kendall|3y=2011|3p=125|4a1=Li|4y=2015|4p=69}} In 1956, leading British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician [[Anthony Crosland]] claimed that capitalism had been abolished in Britain, although others such as Welshman [[Aneurin Bevan]], Minister of Health in the first [[Attlee ministry|post-war Labour government]] and the architect of the [[National Health Service]], disputed the claim that Britain was a socialist state.{{sfnm|1a1=Socialist Party of Great Britain|1y=1958|2a1=Crosland|2y=2006|2pp=9, 89}} For Crosland and others who supported his views, Britain was a socialist state. According to Bevan, Britain had a socialist [[National Health Service]] which stood in opposition to the [[hedonism]] of Britain's capitalist society.{{sfn|Bevan|1952|p=106}} Although the [[Capital accumulation|laws of capitalism]] still operated fully as in the rest of Europe and [[private enterprise]] dominated the economy,{{sfn|Batson|2017}} some political commentators claimed that during the post-war period, when socialist parties were in power, countries such as Britain and France were democratic socialist states and the same claim is now applied to Nordic countries with the [[Nordic model]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1978|2a1=Heilbroner|2y=1991|2pp=96–110|3a1=Kendall|3y=2011|3pp=125–127|4a1=Li|4y=2015|4pp=60–69}} In the 1980s, the government of President [[François Mitterrand]] aimed to expand [[dirigisme]] by attempting to nationalise all French banks, but this attempt faced opposition from the [[European Economic Community]] which demanded a [[capitalist free-market economy]] among its members.{{sfnm|1a1=Cobham|1y=1984|21pp=351–358|2a1=Cohen|2y=2010}} Nevertheless, [[public ownership]] in France and the United Kingdom during the height of nationalisation in the 1960s and 1970s never accounted for more than 15–20% of [[capital formation]].{{sfn|Batson|2017}}

The form of socialism practised by parties such as the Singaporean [[People's Action Party]] during its first few decades in power was of a pragmatic kind as it was characterised by its rejection of nationalisation. The party still claimed to be a [[socialist party]], pointing out its regulation of the private sector, activist intervention in the economy and its social policies as evidence of this claim.{{sfn|Morley|1993}} Singaporean Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] stated that he has been influenced by the democratic socialist British Labour Party.{{sfn|Kerr|1999}} Those confusions and disputes are caused not only by the socialist definition, but by the capitalist definition as well. [[Christian democrats]], [[social liberals]], [[National conservatism|national]] and [[social conservatives]] tend to support social democratic policies and generally see capitalism compatible with a [[mixed economy]] while [[classical liberals]], [[conservative liberal]]s, [[liberal conservative]]s, [[neoliberals]] and [[right-libertarians]] define capitalism as the [[free market]]. Those [[economic liberals]] support a [[small government]], ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalist market economy while opposing democratic socialist policies as well as economic interventionism and government regulations.{{sfn|Campbell|2009|p=95}} According to them, [[actually existing capitalism]] is [[corporatism]], [[corporatocracy]] or [[crony capitalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Stossel|1y=2010|2a1=Kristof|2y=2011|3a1=Salsman|3y=2011|4a1=Chartier|4y=2018}}

''Socialism'' has often been conflated with an [[administrative command economy]], [[authoritarian socialism]], a [[big government]], [[Marxist-Leninist state|Marxist–Leninist states]], [[Soviet-type economic planning]], [[state interventionism]] and [[state socialism]].{{sfn|Campbell|2009|p=95}} [[Austrian School]] economists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]] continually used ''socialism'' as a synonym for central planning and state socialism, conflating it with [[fascism]] and opposing democratic socialist policies, including the welfare state.{{sfnm|1a1=Mises|1y=1936|2a1=Hayek|2y=1944|3a1=Mises|3y=1962}} This is especially true in the United States, where ''socialism'' has become a pejorative used by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarians]] to taint [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] policies, proposals and public figures.{{sfnm|1a1=Truman|1y=1952|2a1=Jackson|2y=2012|3a1=Astor|3y=2019}}

=== Philosophy ===
[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Marx]], whose thought influenced the development of democratic socialism, with some endorsing it and others rejecting it{{refn|"Democratic Marxism is authentic Marxism — the Marxism which emphasizes the necessity for revolutionary action. Loyalty to the movement, not loyalty to any particular doctrine, is characteristic of the orthodox democratic Marxist."{{sfn|Megill|1970|p=45}} "There is considerable controversy among scholars regarding Marx's own attitude toward democracy, but two lines of thought developed from Marx: one emphasizing democracy and one, the dominant line, rejecting it."{{sfn|Sargent|2008|p=118}}|group=nb}}]]
Democratic socialism involves the entire population controlling the economy through some type of [[Economic democracy|democratic system]], with the idea that the [[means of production]] are owned and managed by the [[working class]] as a whole.{{sfn|Edelstein|1993}} The interrelationship between [[democracy]] and [[socialism]] extends far back into the socialist movement to ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the "battle of democracy",{{sfn|Engels|Marx|1848|p=52}} with [[Karl Marx]] writing that democracy is "the road to socialism."{{sfn|Arora|2017}} Socialist thinkers as diverse as [[Eduard Bernstein]], [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]{{sfnm|1a1=Luxemburg|1y=1900|1loc="Co-operatives, Unions, Democracy", "Conquest of Political Power"|2a1=Draper|2y=1966|2loc="The "Revisionist" Facade"}} also wrote that democracy is indispensable to the realisation of socialism.{{sfn|Isakhan|2015|p=354}} Philosophical support for democratic socialism can be found in the works of political philosophers such as [[Axel Honneth]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. Honneth has put forward the view that political and economic ideologies have a social basis, meaning they originate from intersubjective communication between members of a society. Honneth criticises the [[Liberalism|liberal]] state and ideology because it assumes that principles of [[individual liberty]] and [[private property]] are ahistorical and abstract when in fact they evolved from a specific social discourse on human activity. In contrast to [[liberal individualism]], Honneth has emphasised the intersubjective dependence between humans, namely that human well-being depends on recognising others and being recognised by them. With an emphasis on [[community]] and [[solidarity]], democratic socialism can be seen as a way of safeguarding this dependency.{{sfn|Honneth|1995|pp=231–247}}

While ''socialism'' is frequently used to describe [[socialist states]] and [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-style economies]], especially in the United States due to the [[First Red Scare|First]] and [[Second Red Scare|Second]] [[Red Scare]]s, democratic socialists use ''socialism'' to refer to their own tendency that rejects the ideas of [[authoritarian socialism]] and [[state socialism]] as socialism,{{sfnm|1a1=Eatwell|1a2=Wright|1y=1999|1p=80|2a1=Busky|2y=2000|2pp=7–8|3a1=Prychitko|3y=2002|3p=72|4a1=Alt|4a2=Chambers|4a3=Garrett|4a4=Kurian|4y=2010|4p=401}} regarding them as a form of [[state capitalism]] in which the state undertakes [[Profit (economics)|commercial economic activity]] and where the [[means of production]] are organised and managed as [[state-owned enterprises]], including the processes of [[capital accumulation]], [[centralised]] [[management]] and [[wage labour]].{{sfnm|1a1=Chomsky|1y=1986|2a1=Howard|2a2=King|2y=2001|2pp=110–126|3a1=Wolff|3y=2015}} Democratic socialists include those socialists who are opposed to [[Marxism–Leninism]] and social democrats who are committed to the abolishment of [[capitalism]] in favour of [[socialism]] and the institution of a [[post-capitalist]] economy.{{sfnm|1a1=Eatwell|1a2=Wright|1y=1999|1p=80|2a1=Busky|2y=2000|2pp=7–8|3a1=Prychitko|3y=2002|3p=72|4a1=Alt|4a2=Chambers|4a3=Garrett|4a4=Kurian|4y=2010|4p=401}} According to Andrew Lipow, thus wrote in 1847 the editors of the ''Journal'' of the [[Communist League]], directly influenced by Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]], whom Lipow describes as "the founders of modern revolutionary democratic socialism":
{{quote|We are not among those communists who are out to destroy personal liberty, who wish to turn the world into one huge  barrack or into a gigantic workhouse. There certainly are some communists who, with an easy conscience, refuse to countenance personal liberty and would like to shuffle it out of the world because they consider that it is a hindrance to complete harmony. But we have no desire to exchange freedom for equality. We are convinced that in no social order will freedom be assured as in a society based upon communal ownership.{{sfn|Lipow|1991|p=1}}}}

Theoretically and philosophically, socialism itself is democratic, seen as the highest democratic form by its proponents and at one point being one and the same with democracy.{{sfnm|1a1=Link|1y=1968|1pp=559–562|1loc="Socialism and Democracy"|2a1=Pestritto|2y=2005|2pp=77–78|2loc="Socialism and Democracy"|3a1=Schweickart|3y=2006}} Some argue that socialism implies democracy{{sfn|Socialist Party USA}} and that ''democratic socialism'' is a redundant term.{{sfnm|1a1=Sinclair|1y=1918|2a1=Laclau|2a2=Mouffe|2y=1985|3a1=Busky|3y=2000|3pp=7–8}} However, others such as [[Michael Harrington]] argue that the term ''democratic socialism'' is necessary to distinguish it from that of the Soviet Union and other self-declared socialist states. For Harrington, the major reason for this was due to the perspective that viewed the [[Stalinist]]-era Soviet Union as having succeeded in propaganda in usurping the legacy of Marxism and distorting it in propaganda to justify its politics.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=162}} Both Leninism and Marxism–Leninism have emphasised democracy,{{sfn|Busky|2000|p=8}} endorsing some form of democratic organisation of society and the economy whilst supporting [[democratic centralism]], with Marxist–Leninists and others arguing that socialist states such as the Soviet Union were democratic.{{sfnm|1a1=Webb|1a2=Webb|1y=1935|2a1=Sloan|2y=1937|3a1=Farber|3y=1992|4a1=Getzler|4y=2002}} Marxist–Leninists also tended to distinguish what they termed ''socialist democracy'' from ''democratic socialism'', a term which they associated pejoratively to "reformism" and "social democracy".{{sfnm|1a1=Busky|1y=2000|1p=8|2a1=Panfilov|2y=1979}} Ultimately, they are considered outside the democratic socialist tradition.{{sfnm|1a1=Eatwell|1a2=Wright|1y=1999|1p=80|2a1=Busky|2y=2000|2pp=7–8|3a1=Prychitko|3y=2002|3p=72}} On the other hand, [[anarchism]] (especially within its [[social anarchist]] tradition) and other ultra-left tendencies have been discussed within the democratic socialist tradition for their opposition to Marxism–Leninism and their support for more decentralised, direct forms of democracy.{{sfnm|1a1=Draper|1y=1966|1pp=57–84|2a1=Poulantzas|2y=1978|3a1=Hain|3y=1995|4a1=Hain|4y=2000|4p=118}}

While both anarchists and ultra-left tendencies have rejected the label as they tend to associate it to reformist and statist forms of democratic socialism, they are considered revolutionary-democratic forms of socialism and some anarchists have referred to ''democratic socialism''.{{sfn|Dongyoun|2016|pp=171–174}} Some Trotskyist organisations such as the Australian [[Socialist Alliance (Australia)|Socialist Alliance]], [[Socialist Alternative (Australia)|Socialist Alternative]] and [[Victorian Socialists]] or the French [[New Anticapitalist Party]], [[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|Revolutionary Communist League]] and [[Socialism from below]] have described their form of socialism as democratic and have emphasised democracy in their revolutionary development of socialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Murray|1y=2001|2a1=Debbaut|2y=2007|3a1=Agence France-Presse|3y=2008|4a1=Socialist Alternative|5a1=Victorian Socialists|5y=2019}} Similarly, several Trotskyists have emphasised [[Leon Trotsky]]'s revolutionary-democratic socialism.{{sfn|Taaffe|2019}} Some such as [[Hal Draper]] spoke of "revolutionary-democratic socialism".{{sfn|Draper|1966}} Those [[third camp]] revolutionary-democratic socialists advocated a socialist [[political revolution]] that would establish or re-establish socialist democracy in [[Deformed workers' state|deformed]] or [[degenerated workers' state]]s.{{sfnm|1a1=Lipow|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=LeBlanc|2y=2014|2p=202|3a1=Internationalist Marxist Tendency}} Draper also compared social democracy and Stalinism as two forms of [[socialism from above]], contraposed to his own socialism from below as being the purer, more Marxist version of socialism.{{sfn|Draper|1966}}

[[File:Chartist meeting on Kennington Common by William Edward Kilburn 1848 - restoration1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Photograph of the Great [[Chartism|Chartist]] Meeting on [[Kennington Common]], London, 1848]]
Socialist [[Socialist economics|models]] and [[Types of socialism|ideas]] espousing [[Common ownership|common]] or [[public ownership]] have existed since [[Ancient history|antiquity]], but the first self-conscious [[History of socialism|socialist movements]] developed in the 1820s and 1830s. Western European [[social critic]]s, including [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Louis Blanc]], [[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], were the first modern socialists who criticised the excessive poverty and inequality generated by the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The term was first used in English in the British ''Cooperative Magazine'' in 1827 and came to be associated with the followers of Owen such as the [[Rochdale Pioneers]], who founded the [[co-operative movement]]. Owen's followers stressed both [[participatory democracy]] and economic socialisation in the form of consumer [[co-operative]]s, [[credit unions]] and [[Mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] societies. In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}

[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E. P. Thompson]] in ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' by [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] groups like the [[London Corresponding Society]] and by polemicists such as [[Thomas Paine]].{{sfn|Monahan|2015}} Their concern for both [[democracy]] and [[social justice]] marked them out as key precursors of democratic socialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1963|2a1=Thrale|2y=1983|3a1=Taylor|3y=2007}} Democratic socialism also has its origins in the [[Revolutions of 1848]] and the French [[The Mountain (1849)|Democratic Socialists]], although [[Karl Marx]] disliked the movement because he viewed it as a party dominated by the middle class and associated to them the word ''Sozialdemokrat'', the first recorded use of the term ''[[social democracy]]''.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=53}}

[[File:Henry George.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henry George]], a social reformer whose [[geoist]] movement greatly influenced the development of democratic socialism]]
The Chartists gathered significant numbers around the [[People's Charter of 1838]] which demanded the extension of [[Universal manhood suffrage|suffrage to all male adults]]. Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege. Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term ''socialism''.{{sfn|Smitha}}

Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].{{sfn|Australian National University (Birth of the Socialist Idea)}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to the progress of human civilisation.{{sfn|Newman|2005}} This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress, embodying a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The British political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of economic socialism within a liberal context known as [[liberal socialism]].

In the United Kingdom, the democratic socialist tradition was represented by [[William Morris]]'s [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] and in the 1880s by the [[Fabian Society]] and later the [[Independent Labour Party]] founded by [[Keir Hardie]] in the 1890s, of which writer [[George Orwell]] would later become a prominent member.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1977|2a1=James|2a2=Jowitt|2a3=Laybourn|2y=1992|3a1=Reisman 1996 ('''3''')|4a1=Busky|4y=2000|4pp=83–85; 91–109|4loc="Democratic Socialism in Great Britain and Ireland"}} In the early 1920s, the [[guild socialism]] of [[G. D. H. Cole]] attempted to envision a socialist alternative to Soviet-style [[authoritarianism]] while [[council communism]] articulated democratic socialist positions in several respects, notably through renouncing the [[Vanguard party|vanguard]] role of the revolutionary party and holding that the system of the Soviet Union was not authentically socialist.{{sfn|Reisman 1996 ('''7''')}}

The Fabian Society is a British socialist organisation which was established with the purpose of advancing the principles of socialism via [[Gradualism#Politics and society|gradualist]] and [[reform]]ist means.{{sfn|Cole|1961}} Today, the society functions primarily as a [[think tank]] and is one of the fifteen [[Socialist society (Labour Party)|socialist societies]] affiliated with the Labour Party. Similar societies exist in Australia (the [[Australian Fabian Society]]), in Canada (the [[Douglas-Coldwell Foundation]] and the now disbanded [[League for Social Reconstruction]]) and in New Zealand. The society laid many of the foundations of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and subsequently affected the policies of states emerging from the [[decolonisation]] of the [[British Empire]], most notably India and Singapore. Originally, the Fabian Society was committed to the establishment of a [[socialist economy]], alongside a commitment to [[British imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] as a progressive and modernising force.{{sfn|Day|Gaido|2011|p=249}} In 1889 (the centennial of the French Revolution of 1789), the [[Second International]] was founded, with 384 delegates from twenty countries representing about 300 labour and socialist organisations.{{sfn|''Marxist History''}} It was termed the Socialist International and [[Friedrich Engels]] was elected honorary president at the third congress in 1893. [[Anarchists]] were ejected and not allowed in mainly due to pressure from [[Marxists]].{{sfn|Woodcock|1962|pp=263–264}} It has been argued that at some point the Second International turned "into a battleground over the issue of [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] versus [[Authoritarian socialism|authoritarian]] socialism. Not only did they effectively present themselves as champions of minority rights; they also provoked the German Marxists into demonstrating a dictatorial intolerance which was a factor in preventing the British labour movement from following the Marxist direction indicated by such leaders as [[Henry Hyndman|H.

[[File:Bernstein Eduard 1895.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Eduard Bernstein]], a socialist theorist within the [[German Social Democratic Party]] who proposed that socialism could be achieved by peaceful means through incremental legislative reforms in democratic societies]]
In Germany, democratic socialism became a prominent movement at the end of the 19th century, when the Eisenach's [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]] merged with Lassalle's [[General German Workers' Association]] in 1875 to form the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the "battle of democracy."{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247–259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181–196}}

[[File:Friedrich Engels portrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Engels]], a [[Marxist]] socialist who attempted to bring closer reformists and revolutionaries]]
In his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848–1850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181–196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that "revolution" and the "so-called socialist society" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made "us [socialists] all evolutionists", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be "suicidal" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen "as early as 1898."{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247–259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181–196}}

Engels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181–196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels responded to Kautsky:
{{quote|I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorwärts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs]. Which is all the more reason why I should like it to appear in its entirety in the ''Neue Zeit'' in order that this disgraceful impression may be erased. I shall leave Liebknecht in no doubt as to what I think about it and the same applies to those who, irrespective of who they may be, gave him this opportunity of perverting my views and, what's more, without so much as a word to me about it.{{sfn|Engels|2004|p=86}}}}

[[File:Karenskiy AF 1917.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Alexander Kerensky]], a moderate democratic socialist who led the [[Russian Provisional Government]]]]
In February 1917, revolution broke out in Russia in which workers, soldiers and peasants established [[Soviet (council)|soviets]], the monarchy was forced into exile fell and a [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]] was formed until the election of a [[constituent assembly]]. [[Alexander Kerensky]], a Russian lawyer and revolutionary, became a key political figure in the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917. After the [[February Revolution]], Kerensky joined the newly formed [[Russian Provisional Government]], first as [[Justice ministry|Minister of Justice]], then as [[Minister of War]] and after July as the government's [[List of heads of government of Russia#Provisional Government/Russian Republic (1917)|second]] [[Prime Minister of Russia|Minister-Chairman]]. A leader of the moderate socialist [[Trudoviks|Trudovik]] faction of the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]] known as the Labour Group, Kerensky was also the Vice-Chairman of the powerful [[Petrograd Soviet]]. After failing to sign a peace treaty with the German Empire to exit from World War I which led to massive popular unrest against the government cabinet, Kerensky's government was overthrown on 7 November by the [[Bolshevik]]s led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] in the [[October Revolution]]. Soon after the October Revolution, the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]] elected Socialist-Revolutionary leader [[Victor Chernov]] as [[List of heads of state of Russia|President of a Russian Republic]], but it rejected the Bolshevik proposal that endorsed the Soviet decrees on land, peace and workers' control and acknowledged the power of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies.{{sfn|Docherty|Lamb|2006}}

As a result of the [[1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election]] which saw a landslide victory for the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Bolsheviks declared on the next day that the assembly was elected based on outdated party lists which did not reflect the Socialist Revolutionary Party split into Left and Right Socialist-Revolutionary factions.

In 1922, the [[4th World Congress of the Communist International]] took up the policy of the [[united front]], urging communists to work with rank and file social democrats while remaining critical of their party leaders, whom they criticised for betraying the working class by supporting the war efforts of their respective capitalist classes. For their part, the social democrats pointed to the dislocation and chaos caused by revolution and later the growing authoritarianism of the [[communist parties]] after they achieved power. When the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] applied to affiliate with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1920, it was turned down. On seeing the Soviet Union's growing coercive power in 1923, a dying Lenin stated that Russia had reverted to a "[[bourgeois]] [[Tsarist autocracy|tsarist machine]] [...] barely varnished with socialism."{{sfn|Serge|1937|p=55}} After Lenin's death in January 1924, the communist party, increasingly falling under the control of [[Joseph Stalin]], rejected the theory that [[World revolution|socialism could not be built solely in the Soviet Union]] in favour of the concept of [[socialism in one country]].{{sfn|Stalin|1976}}

In other parts of Europe, many democratic socialist parties were united in the IWUSP in the early 1920s and in the [[London Bureau]] in the 1930s, along with many other socialists of different tendencies and ideologies. These socialist internationals sought to steer a centrist course between the revolutionaries and the social democrats of the Second International and the perceived anti-democratic Communist International. In contrast, the social democrats of the Second International were seen as insufficiently socialist and had been compromised by their support for World War I. The key movements within the IWUSP were the [[Austromarxists]] and the British [[Independent Labour Party]] while the main forces in the London Bureau were the Independent Labour Party and the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification]].{{sfnm|1a1=Polasky|1y=1995|2a1=Wagner|2y=1996}}

After World War II, democratic socialist, labourist and social-democratic governments introduced [[social reform]]s and [[wealth redistribution]] via [[welfare state]] [[Social welfare|social programmes]] and [[progressive taxation]]. Those parties dominated post-war politics in the Nordic countries and countries such as Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. At one point, France claimed the world's most state-controlled capitalist country, starting a period of unprecedented economic growth known as the [[Trente Glorieuses]], part of the [[post-war economic boom]] set in motion by the [[Keynesian consensus]].

This particular adaptation of the [[mixed economy]], better known as the [[Nordic model]], is characterised by more generous [[welfare states]] (relative to other [[developed countries]]) which are aimed specifically at enhancing individual autonomy, ensuring the universal provision of basic human rights and stabilising the economy.

The [[Rehn–Meidner model]] was adopted by the Swedish Social Democratic Party in the late 1940s. This economic model allowed capitalists who owned very productive and efficient firms to retain excess profits at the expense of the firm's workers, exacerbating income inequality and causing workers in these firms to agitate for a better share of the profits in the 1970s.

In the United States, the New Left was associated with the [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] and [[hippie]] movements as well as the [[Black Power|black liberation]] movements such as the [[Black Panther Party]].{{sfn|Pearson|1994|p=152}} While initially formed in opposition to the so-called [[Old Left]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], groups composing the New Left gradually became central players in the Democratic coalition, culminating in the nomination of the outspoken [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] [[George McGovern]] at the [[1972 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic Party primaries]]{{sfn|Gimpel|Hoffman|Kaufmann|2003|pp=457–476}} for the [[1972 United States presidential election]].{{sfn|Carmines|Layman|1997}}

The [[protest wave of 1968]] represented a worldwide escalation of social conflicts, predominantly characterised by popular rebellions against military dicatorships, capitalists and bureaucratic elites, who responded with an escalation of [[political repression]] and [[authoritarianism]]. These protests marked a turning point for the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States which produced revolutionary movements like the Black Panther Party. The prominent civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] organised the [[Poor People's Campaign]] to address issues of economic and social justice{{sfn|Isserman|2001|p=281}} while personally showing sympathy with democratic socialism.{{sfn|Franklin|1990|p=125}} The classic [[Port Huron Statement]] of the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] combined a stringent critique of the Stalinist model with calls for a democratic socialist reconstruction of society.{{sfnm|1a1=Students for a Democratic Society|1y=1962|2a1=Isserman|2a2=Kazin|2y=2000|2p=169|3a1=Dionne|3y=2007|3pp=5–9|4a1=Dreyer|4y=2012|5a1=''In These Times'', 25 April 2012}}

In reaction to the [[Tet Offensive]], protests also sparked a broad movement in opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] all over the United States and even into London, Paris, Berlin and Rome. Mass socialist or communist movements grew not only in the United States, but also in most European countries. The most spectacular manifestation of this was the [[May 1968 protests in France]] in which students linked up with strikes of up to ten million workers and the movement seemed capable of overthrowing the government, albeit for only a few days. In many other capitalist countries, struggles against dictatorships, state repression and colonisation were also marked by protests in 1968 such as the beginning of [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, the [[Tlatelolco massacre]] in Mexico City and the escalation of guerrilla warfare against the [[military dictatorship in Brazil]].{{sfn|''International Socialist Review''|2019}} Countries governed by Marxist–Leninist parties had protests against bureaucratic and military elites. In Eastern Europe, there were widespread protests that escalated particularly in the [[Prague Spring]] in Czechoslovakia.{{sfn|Bracke|2013}} In response, the Soviet Union occupied Czechoslovakia, but the occupation was denounced by the Italian and French communist parties as well as the [[Communist Party of Finland]].{{sfnm|1a1=Devlin|1y=1978|1p=4|2a1=Moghiorosi|2y=2015|2pp=22–37}}

In the late 1970s and in the 1980s, the [[Socialist International]] had extensive contacts and held discussion with the two powers of the [[Cold War]], the United States and the Soviet Union, regarding the relations between the East and West, along with arms control. Since then, the Socialist International has admitted as member parties the Nicaraguan [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] and the left-wing [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]] as well as former communist parties such as the Italian [[Democratic Party of the Left]] and the [[FRELIMO|Front for the Liberation of Mozambique]]. The Socialist International aided social democratic parties in re-establishing themselves after right-wing dictatorships were toppled in [[Carnation Revolution|Portugal]] and [[Spanish transition to democracy|Spain]], respectively in 1974 and 1975. Until its 1976 congress in Geneva, the Socialist International had few members outside Europe and no formal involvement with Latin America.{{sfn|Chamberlain|Gunson|Thompson|1989}}

In the United States, the [[Social Democrats, USA]], an association of reformist social democrats and democratic socialists, was founded in 1972. The [[Socialist Party of America]] had stopped running independent presidential candidates and begun reforming itself towards democratic socialism. Consequently, the party's name was changed because it had confused the public.

The rapid transition to neoliberal capitalism and privatisation in the former Soviet Union and [[Eastern Bloc]] was accompanied by a steep fall in standards of living as poverty, unemployment, income inequality and excess mortality rose sharply as Russia would be in recession until the depths of the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]].

By the 1980s, with the rise of conservative neoliberal politicians such as [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States, Margaret Thatcher in Britain, [[Brian Mulroney]] in Canada and [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile, the Western [[welfare state]] was attacked from within, but state support for the corporate sector was maintained.{{sfn|Teeple|2000|p=47}} According to [[Kristen Ghodsee]], the triumphalist attitudes of Western powers at the end of the Cold War and the fixation with linking all leftist and socialist ideals with the excesses of [[Stalinism]] allowed neoliberalism to fill the void. This undermined democratic institutions and reforms, leaving a trail of economic misery, unemployment, hopelessness and rising economic inequality throughout the former Eastern Bloc and much of the West in the following decades. With democracy weakened and the anti-capitalist left marginalised, the anger and resentment which followed the period of neoliberalism was channeled into extremist nationalist movements in both the former and the latter.{{sfnm|1a1=Ghodsee|1y=2014|1pp=115–142|2a1=Ghodsee|2y=2017|2pp=xix–xx, 134, 197–200}}

In 1989, the Socialist International adopted a new Declaration of Principles at its 18th congress in Stockholm, Sweden, stating: "Democratic socialism is an international movement for freedom, social justice, and solidarity. Its goal is to achieve a peaceful world where these basic values can be enhanced and where each individual can live a meaningful life with the full development of his or her personality and talents, and with the guarantee of human and civil rights in a democratic framework of society."{{sfn|Socialist International|1989}} Within the Labour Party, the ''democratic socialist'' label was used historically by those who identified with the tradition represented by the [[Independent Labour Party]], the [[soft left]] of non-Marxist socialists such as Michael Foot around the ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' magazine and some of the [[hard left]] in the [[Campaign Group]] around Tony Benn.{{sfnm|1a1=Mullin|1y=1985|2a1=Seyd|2y=1987}} The Campaign Group, along with the [[Socialist Society]] led by [[Raymond Williams]] and others, formed the [[Socialist Movement]] in 1987 which now produces the magazine ''[[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=O'Farrell|1y=1999|2a1=''The Guardian'', 28 June 2004|3a1=Cathcart|3y=2004}}

In the late 1990s, the Labour Party under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] enacted policies based on the liberal [[market economy]] with the intention of delivering public services via the [[private finance initiative]]. Influential in these policies was the idea of a [[Third Way]] which called for a re-evaluation and reduction of welfare state policies.{{sfn|Lewis|Surender|2004|pp=3–4, 16}} In 1995, the Labour Party re-defined its position on socialism by re-wording [[Clause IV]] of their [[Labour Party Rule Book|Constitution]], effectively removing all references to public, direct worker or municipal ownership of the means of production and now reading: "The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that, by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create, for each of us, the means to realise our true potential, and, for all of us, a community in which power, wealth, and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few."{{sfn|Adams|1998|pp=144–145}} New Labour eventually won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election]] in a landslide and Blair described New Labour as a "left of centre party, pursuing economic prosperity and social justice as partners and not as opposites."{{sfn|Toynbee|White|Wintout|2001}} It has been argued that the Labour Party under the [[First Blair ministry|Blair ministry]] effectively governed from the [[Radical centrism|radical centre]], something which Blair had promised to do in the 1997 general election.{{sfn|Nuttall|2006|p=193}}

=== 21st century ===

While opponents of Sanders have used the ''democratic socialist'' label to accuse him of being too left-leaning for American politics, the theoretical and practical applications of it are based on the precept of shifting responsibility away from the national level to local decision-makers, a fundamental principle shared by the system of [[federalism in the United States]].{{sfn|Ben-Meir|2020}} A democratic socialist perspective on government investment in infrastructure would support more projects with smaller-sized budgets on a local level instead of a few highly expensive ones.

In a 2018 poll conducted by [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]], a majority of people under the age of 30 in the United States stated that they approve of socialism. 57% of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-leaning voters viewed socialism positively and 47% saw capitalism positively while 71% of Republican-leaning voters who were polled saw capitalism under a positive light and 16% viewed socialism in a positive light.{{sfn|Newport|2018}} A 2019 [[YouGov]] poll found that 7 out of 10 millennials in the United States would vote for a socialist presidential candidate and 36% had a favorable view of [[communism]].{{sfn|Gregory|2019}} An earlier 2019 [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Harris Poll]] found that socialism is more popular with women than men, with 55% of women between the ages of 18 and 54 preferring to live in a socialist society while a majority of men surveyed in the poll chose capitalism over socialism.{{sfn|Klar|2019}}

Although there is no agreement on the meaning of socialism in those polls,{{sfn|Astor|2019}} there has been a steady increase of support for progressive reforms such as the [[United States National Health Care Act]]{{sfn|Conyers|2017}} to enact universal [[single-payer health care]] and the [[Green New Deal]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carlock|1a2=McElwee|1y=2018|2a1=Kaufman|2y=2018|3a1=Ocasio-Cortez|3y=2019|4a1=Rizzo|4y=2019}} In November 2018, [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]] and [[Rashida Tlaib]], who are members of the [[Democratic Socialists of America]] (DSA), a democratic socialist organization which advocates progressive reforms that "will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people",{{sfn|Democratic Socialists of America (About)}} were elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] while eleven DSA candidates were elected to [[List of United States state legislatures|state legislatures]].{{sfn|Vyse|2018}}

According to the ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]'', "the attempt by [[Salvador Allende]] to unite Marxists and other reformers in a socialist reconstruction of Chile is most representative of the direction that Latin American socialists have taken since the late 20th century. [...] Several socialist (or socialist-leaning) leaders have followed Allende's example in winning election to office in Latin American countries."{{sfn|Ball|Dagger|2020}} Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]], Nicaraguan President [[Daniel Ortega]], Bolivian President [[Evo Morales]] and Ecuadorian President [[Rafael Correa]] refer to their political programmes as ''socialist'' and Chávez adopted the term ''[[socialism of the 21st century]]''. After winning re-election in December 2006, Chávez stated: "Now more than ever, I am obliged to move Venezuela's path towards socialism."{{sfn|Bowman|2007}}

Chávez was re-elected in October 2012 for his third six-year term as president, but he suddenly died in March 2013 from advanced cancer. After [[Death of Hugo Chávez|Chávez's death]], [[Nicolás Maduro]], the Vice President of the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]], assumed the powers and responsibilities of the President on 5 March 2013. A [[2013 Venezuelan presidential election|special election]] to elect a new president was held on 14 April 2013 which Maduro won by a tight margin as the candidate of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. He was formally inaugurated on 19 April 2013.{{sfn|BBC|2013}} Most democratic socialist scholars and analysts have been sceptical of Latin America's examples. While citing their progressive role, they argue that the appropriate label for these governments is ''[[populism]]'' rather than ''[[socialism]]'' due to their authoritarian characteristics and occasional cults of personality.{{sfnm|1a1=Sargent|1y=2008|1p=118|2a1=Munck|2y=2012|2p=119|3a1=Iber|3y=2016}} On the socialist development in Venezuela, Chávez argued with the second government plan (''{{ill|Plan de la Patria|es}}'') that "socialism has just begun to implant its internal dynamism among us" whilst acknowledging that "the socio-economic formation that still prevails in Venezuela is [[Rentier capitalism|capitalist and rentier]]."{{sfn|Chávez|2012}} This same thesis is defended by Maduro,{{sfn|Izarra|2018}} who acknowledges that he has failed in the development of the [[productive forces]] while admitting that "the old model of corrupt and inefficient [[state capitalism]]" typical of traditional Venezuelan [[Rentier state|oil rentism]] has contradictorily combined with a statist model that "pretends to be a socialist."{{sfn|Venezolana de Televisión|2018}}

==== Europe ====
The [[United Nations]] ''[[World Happiness Report]]'' shows that the happiest nations are concentrated in Northern Europe, where the [[Nordic model]] (which democratic socialists want to strengthen against [[austerity]] and [[neoliberalism]]){{sfn|Gustavsen|2009|p=4}} is employed, with the list being topped by Denmark, where the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] led their first government in 1924 and governed Denmark for most of the 20th century. The [[Norwegian Labour Party]], the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland]] also led the majority of governments and were the most popular political parties in their respective countries during the 20th century. While not as popular like its counterparts, the Icelandic [[Social Democratic Party (Iceland)|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Alliance]] have also led several governments and have been part of numerous coalitions. This success is at times attributed to the social-democratic Nordic model in the region, where the aforementioned democratic socialist, labourist and social-democratic political parties have dominated the political scene and laid the ground to [[Welfare state#Three worlds of the welfare state|universalistic]] [[welfare state]]s in the 20th century, fitting the social-democratc type of "high socialism" which is described as favouring "a high level of decommodification and a low degree of stratification."{{sfnm|1a1=Esping-Andersen|1y=1985|2a1=Hicks|2y=1988|3a1=Moschonas|3y=2002|4a1=Rosser Jr.|4a2=Rosser|4y=2003|5a1=Ferragina|5a2=Seeleib-Kaiser|5y=2011|6a1=Brandal|6a2=Bratberg|6a3=Thorsen|6y=2013}} The Nordic countries, including Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden as well as Greenland and the Faroe Islands, also ranked highest on the metrics of real [[GDP per capita]], [[economic equality]], healthy [[life expectancy]], [[public health]], [[Solidarity|having someone to count on]], [[education]], perceived [[Freedom of choice|freedom to make life choices]], [[generosity]] and [[human development (economics)|human development]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gregoire|1y=2013|2a1=Conley|2y=2019}} The Nordic countries have ranked high on indicators such as [[civil liberties]],{{sfnm|1a1=Abramowitz|1y=2018|2a1=Aghekyan|2a2=Bhatia|2a3=Dunham|2a4=O'Toole|2y=2018|3a1=Abramowitz|3y=2019|4a1=Repucci|4y=2020}} [[democracy]],{{sfn|''The Economist''|2020}} [[Press freedom|press]],{{sfnm|1a1=Reporters Without Borders 2019 (table)|2a1=Reporters Without Borders 2019 (analysis)}} [[Labour rights|labour]] and [[Economic freedom|economic]] freedoms,{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1a2=Kim|1y=2016|2a1=The Heritage Foundation|2y=2017}} [[peace]]{{sfn|Vision of Humanity|2019}} and freedom from [[corruption]].{{sfnm|1a1=Transparency International 2020 (table)|2a1=Transparency International 2020 (analysis)}} Numerous studies and surveys have indicated that people tend to live happier lives in social democracies and welfare states as opposed to neoliberal and free-market economies.{{sfnm|1a1=Brown|1y=2009|2a1=Pani|2a2=Panic|2y=2011|2pp=109–141|3a1=Radcliff|3y=2013|4a1=Brown|4y=2014|5a1=Eskow|5y=2014}}

The objectives of the [[Party of European Socialists]], the [[European Parliament]]'s social democratic bloc, are now "to pursue international aims in respect of the principles on which the European Union is based, namely principles of freedom, equality, solidarity, democracy, respect of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and respect for the Rule of Law."

On 25 May 2014, the Spanish left-wing party [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] entered candidates for the [[2014 European Parliament election in Spain|2014 European parliamentary election]], some of which were unemployed. In a surprise result, it won 7.98% of the vote and was awarded five seats out of 54{{sfnm|1a1=Sky News Australia|1y=2014|2a1=BBC|2y=2014}} while the older [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] was the third largest overall force, obtaining 10.03% and five seats, four more than the previous elections.{{sfn|''Boletín Oficial del Estado''|2014}} Although losing seats in both the [[April 2019 Spanish general election|April 2019]] and [[November 2019 Spanish general election|November 2019]] general elections, the result of the latter being a failure of negotiations with the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE), Podemos reached an agreement with the PSOE for a full four-year coalition government, the first such government since the [[Spanish transition to democracy|country's transition to democracy]] in 1976.{{sfn|Castro|Riveiro|2019}} While failing to get the necessary 176 out of 350 majority investiture vote on 5 January 2020,{{sfn|Díez|Marcos|2020}} the PSOE–Unidas Podemos coalition government was able to get a simple majority (167–165) on 7 January 2020{{sfn|Casqueiro|Pérez|2020}} and the new [[Sánchez II Government|cabinet]] was sworn into office the following day.{{sfn|Aduriz|Castro|2020}}

The government of Portugal established on 26 November 2015 was a left-wing [[minority government]] led by Prime Minister [[António Costa]] [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]], who succeeded in securing support for the government by the [[Left Bloc]], the [[Portuguese Communist Party]] and the [[Ecologist Party "The Greens"]].{{sfn|''Presidência da República''|2015}} This was largely confirmed in the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|2019 legislative election]], where the Socialist Party returned to first place, forming another left-wing minority government, this time led only by the Socialist Party. Nonetheless, Costa said he would look to continue the [[confidence-and-supply agreement]] with the Left Bloc and the [[Unitary Democratic Coalition]].{{sfn|Ames|Oliveira|2019}}

In Australia, the labourist and socialist movements were gaining traction and the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) was formed in [[Barcaldine, Queensland]] in 1891 by striking pastoral workers. In 1889, a minority government led by the party was formed in [[Queensland]], with [[Anderson Dawson]] as the [[Premier of Queensland]], where it was founded and was in power for one week, becoming the world's first government led by democratic socialists. The ALP has been the main driving force for workers' rights and the welfare state in Australia, backed by Australian trade unions, in particular the [[Australian Workers' Union]]. Since the end of the [[Whitlam government]], the ALP has moved towards centrist policies and [[Third Way]] ideals which are supported by the ALP's [[Labor Unity|Right Faction]] members while the supporters of democratic socialism and social democracy lie within the ALP's [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Left Faction]]. There has been an increase in interest for socialism in recent years, especially among young adults.{{sfn|Boyle|2018}} Interest is strongest in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], where the [[Victorian Socialists]] party was founded.{{sfn|Pearce|2018}}

Current Prime Minister [[Jacinda Ardern]] of the democratic socialist{{sfnm|1a1=New Zealand Labour Party|1y=2016|2a1=New Zealand Labour Party|2y=2019|3a1=New Zealand Labour Party 2019 (Party Information)}} [[New Zealand Labour Party]], who has called capitalism a "blatant failure" due to the extent of [[homelessness in New Zealand]],{{sfn|Owen|Satherley|2017}} has been described and identified herself as democratic socialist,{{sfn|Dann|2017}} although others have disputed this.{{sfn|Mapp|2019}}

In Melanesia, [[Melanesian socialism]] was inspired by [[African socialism]] and developed in the 1980s. It aims to achieve full independence from Britain and France in Melanesian territories and creation of a Melanesian federal union. It is very popular with the [[Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front|New Caledonia independence movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Premadas|1y=1986|2a1=Cultural Survival|2y=1991|3a1=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|3y=2007}}

== Views on compatibility of democracy and socialism ==
=== Support ===
One of the major scholars who have argued that socialism and democracy are compatible is the Austrian-born American economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]], who was hostile to socialism.{{sfn|Horwitz|1994|p=255}} In his book ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'' (1942), Schumpeter emphasised that "political democracy was thoroughly compatible with socialism in its fullest sense",{{sfnm|1a1=Schumpeter|1y=1942|2a1=Medearis|2y=1997}} although it has been noted that he did not believe that democracy was a good political system and advocated republican values.{{sfn|Barrett|1978}}

In a 1963 address to the [[All India Congress Committee]], Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] stated: "Political democracy has no meaning if it does not embrace [[economic democracy]]. And economic democracy is nothing but socialism."{{sfn|Bilgrami|1965|pp=26–31}}

Political historian [[Theodore Draper]] wrote: "I know of no political group which has resisted totalitarianism in all its guises more steadfastly than democratic socialists."{{sfn|Barrett|1978}}

Historian and economist [[Robert Heilbroner]] argued that "[t]here is, of course, no conflict between such a socialism and freedom as we have described it; indeed, this conception of socialism is the very epitome of these freedoms", referring to open association of individuals in political and social life; the democratization and humanization of work; and the cultivation of personal talents and creativity.{{sfn|Barrett|1978}}

[[Bayard Rustin]], long-time member of the [[Socialist Party of America]] and National Chairman of the [[Social Democrats, USA]], wrote: "For me, socialism has meaning only if it is democratic. Of the many claimants to socialism only one has a valid title—that socialism which views democracy as valuable per se, which stands for democracy unequivocally, and which continually modifies socialist ideas and programs in the light of democratic experience. This is the socialism of the labor, social-democratic, and socialist parties of Western Europe."{{sfn|Barrett|1978}}

Economist and political theorist [[Kenneth Arrow]] argued: "We cannot be sure that the principles of democracy and socialism are compatible until we can observe a viable society following both principles. But there is no convincing evidence or reasoning which would argue that a democratic-socialist movement is inherently self-contradictory. Nor need we fear that gradual moves in the direction of increasing government intervention will lead to an irreversible move to '[[The Road to Serfdom|serfdom]].'"{{sfn|Barrett|1978}}

Journalist [[William Pfaff]] wrote: "It might be argued that socialism ineluctably breeds state bureaucracy, which then imposes its own kinds of restrictions upon individual liberties. This is what the Scandinavians complain about. But Italy's champion bureaucracy owes nothing to socialism. American bureaucracy grows as luxuriantly and behaves as officiously as any other."{{sfn|Barrett|1978}}

=== Oppose ===
Some politicians, economists and theorists have argued that socialism and democracy are incompatible. According to them, history is full of instances of [[List of socialist states|self-declared socialist states]] that at one point were committed to the values of [[personal liberty]], [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]] and [[freedom of association]], but then found themselves clamping down on such freedoms as they end up being viewed as inconvenient or contrary towards their political or economic goals.{{sfn|Barrett|1978}} [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]] economist [[Milton Friedman]] argued that a "society which is socialist cannot also be democratic" in the sense of "guaranteeing individual freedom."{{sfn|Barrett|1978}} Sociologist [[Robert Nisbet]], a philosophical conservative who began his career as a leftist, argued in 1978 that there is "not a single free socialism to be found anywhere in the world."{{sfn|Barrett|1978}}

[[Neoconservative]] [[Irving Kristol]] argued: "Democratic socialism turns out to be an inherently unstable compound, a contradiction in terms. Every social-democratic party, once in power, soon finds itself choosing, at one point after another, between the socialist society it aspires to and the liberal society that lathered it." Kristol added that "socialist movements end up [in] a society where liberty is the property of the state, and is (or is not) doled out to its citizens along with other contingent 'benefits.'"{{sfn|Barrett|1978}}

Similarly, [[anti-communist]] academic [[Richard Pipes]] argued: "The merger of political and economic power implicit in socialism greatly strengthens the ability of the state and its bureaucracy to control the population. Theoretically, this capacity need not be exercised and need not lead to growing domination of the population by the state. In practice, such a tendency is virtually inevitable. For one thing, the socialization of the economy must lead to a numerical growth of the bureaucracy required to administer it, and this process cannot fail to augment the power of the state. For another, socialism leads to a tug of war between the state, bent on enforcing its economic monopoly, and the ordinary citizen, equally determined to evade it; the result is repression and the creation of specialized repressive organs."{{sfn|Barrett|1978}}
