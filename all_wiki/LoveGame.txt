"'''LoveGame'''" is a song released by American singer [[Lady Gaga]] from her debut studio album, ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008). Produced by [[RedOne]], the track was released as the album's third single in North America and Europe and the fourth single in Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden after "[[Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)]]". "LoveGame" was also released as the fourth single in the United Kingdom, after "[[Paparazzi (Lady Gaga song)|Paparazzi]]".

Critics appreciated the song's rhythm and the "I wanna take a ride on your disco stick" [[Hook (music)|hook]]. Gaga had explained that the term "disco stick" is a euphemism for a penis and was inspired by her sexual attraction to a stranger at a night club. Musically carrying the vibe of underground New York discos, "LoveGame" talks about love, fame, and sexuality which was the central theme of the album. The song received a number of remixes, one of them featuring rock musician [[Marilyn Manson]]. "LoveGame" was a commercial success, charting within the top ten in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, France, Germany, and other European countries. It became Gaga's third consecutive number-one song on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart and achieved triple platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

The New York underground-inspired music video for the song was directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], and portrayed Gaga dancing at an underground subway station and in a parking lot. The music video was a tribute from the singer to the New York lifestyle including its glamour, fans and fashion. It was influenced by the music video for [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]", which also took place in a subway station, and features Gaga wearing [[Nazi chic]] fashion. The music video was banned from broadcast at the PG-rated time slots in Australian television channels because of its sexual content. "LoveGame" has been performed live a number of times by Gaga, including television appearances, such as ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' and ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', the [[2009 MuchMusic Video Awards]], and many of the singer's concert tours. She usually performs the song while holding her characteristic "disco stick" in one hand.

==Background and release==

Towards the end of 2007, Lady Gaga's management company introduced her to songwriter and producer [[RedOne]], whom they also managed.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_RedOne_Interview.html|title=Interview With RedOne|date=March 23, 2009|publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|accessdate=December 19, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113171226/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_RedOne_Interview.html|archivedate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> By 2008, Gaga relocated to Los Angeles in order to work extensively with her record label to complete her debut album, ''[[The Fame]]'', and set up her own creative team called the Haus of Gaga. "LoveGame" was one of the songs written by Gaga and RedOne who also produced the track.<ref name="ehqueenofpop">{{cite book|last=Herbert|first=Emily|year=2010|title=[[Lady Gaga: Queen of Pop]]|publisher=[[John Blake Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-84454-963-4}}</ref> With ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Gaga explained that she was at a nightclub and had a "sexual crush" on somebody. She went up to the person and uttered the line, "I wanna ride on your disco stick". Thinking it to be a thoughtful metaphor for [[penis]], Gaga went to the recording studio the next day and wrote the song in roughly four minutes. Gaga also had ideas for the live performance of the song where she used "an actual stick—it looks like a giant rock-candy pleasuring tool—that lights up".<ref name="inspiration">{{cite journal|title=The 'Just Dance' singer on leotards, the first lady and raunchy lyrics|last=Scaggs|first=Austin|date=February 19, 2009|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|issn=0035-791X}}</ref>

While commenting in regards to the lyrical content of the song on Australian talk show, ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove]]'', Gaga said that she was unrepentant about her "disco stick" metaphor, though it led to a banning of the music video on [[Network Ten]] in Australia. She added that the metaphor was not meant to be subtle and was clear what the lyrics constituted off. "If anything, I happen to think people are frivolously hard on me", Gaga generalized. She went on to relegate "lot of youth-oriented pop music" as much racier than hers with their sexually provocative lyrics, but Gaga felt that the whole context of her visuals alongside the music was what made people react. "It's the music in relation to the visual, in relation to the way I move and the way I articulate the lyrics. But if I wanted to make music to make people sing 'la di da' that would be very boring," she concluded.<ref name="heraldsun">{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/news/this-decades-biggest-thing/story-fna7dq6e-1225713905455|title=The world goes crazy for Lady Gaga|date=May 21, 2009|publisher=[[News.com.au]]|accessdate=May 27, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506152250/http://www.news.com.au/news/this-decades-biggest-thing/story-fna7dq6e-1225713905455|archivedate=May 6, 2014}}</ref>

==Critical reception==

The song received mostly positive reviews from critics. ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]]'' music editor Daniel Brockman said that "Gaga ups the ante in terms of catchy song writing and sheer high-in-the-club-banging-to-the-beat abandon." He also commented on the lyrics saying that "'Let's have some fun, this beat is sick / I wanna take a ride on your disco stick' might be the trashiest-yet-awesomest refrain I've heard on a major-label record this year."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thephoenix.com/Boston/Music/70309-LADY-GAGA-THE-FAME/|title=Lady GaGa:The Fame|first=Daniel|last=Brockman|date=October 22, 2008|accessdate=April 6, 2009|work=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304003127/http://thephoenix.com/Boston/Music/70309-LADY-GAGA-THE-FAME|archivedate=March 4, 2009}}</ref> Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine]] criticized the song for "cheap" lyrics and "painfully enunciat[ing] without any resemblance of actual sex appeal".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/lady-gaga-the-fame|title=Lady Gaga: The Fame review|first=Sal|last=Cinquemani|date=October 25, 2008|accessdate=April 6, 2009|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814220440/http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/lady-gaga-the-fame|archivedate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> While reviewing ''The Fame'', [[BBC]] said that the song sounded robotic in the line "I wanna take a ride on your disco stick", though deemed it a brilliant track which "leaves us awarding Gaga the yearbook title of 'pop star most likely to kill'."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/f6bd|title=Lady GaGa The Fame Review|first=Talia|last=Kraines|date=January 9, 2009|accessdate=April 6, 2009|publisher=BBC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405210433/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/f6bd|archivedate=April 5, 2009}}</ref>

Nick Levine from [[Digital Spy]] believed that lines like "I wanna take a ride on your disco stick" was a direct reason of Gaga's commercial success. Although he felt that the song was "attention-seeking", he knew that it would provoke reaction from the masses, be it good or bad.<ref name="spy">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/review/a177512/lady-gaga-lovegame.html#~oIMQ850WpcktGG|title=Lady GaGa: 'LoveGame'|last=Levine|first=Nick|date=September 16, 2009|accessdate=July 1, 2014|website=Digital Spy|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715001935/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/review/a177512/lady-gaga-lovegame.html#~oIMQ850WpcktGG|archivedate=July 15, 2014}}</ref> Genevieve Koski from ''[[The A.V.

Ben Hogwood from [[musicOMH]] declared the song as "top notch, diamond-encrusted pop" along with other tracks like "Starstruck" and "Paparazzi".

While reviewing ''The Fame'' on its fifth anniversary, Bradley Stern from [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] noted that "LoveGame" could "easily be erased from Gaga's back catalog with little consequence" since he felt it to be nothing more than an "electro-dance" track. But Stern believed that "LoveGame" was an important component of Gaga's career trajectory, since it was the last testament of her image as "that of the disco-stick wielding pop star from out of space"—the image was later deconstructed as the doomed starlet in the music video of "Paparazzi". He concluded by saying that the song "is a wonderful moment of pop frivolity which served to keep the upstart Lady Gaga machine chugging along at the beginning of her career."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7478449/lady-gaga-the-fame-stan-and-deliver/2|title=Lady Gaga's 'The Fame' Turns 5: Stan & Deliver|last=Stern|first=Bradley|date=August 19, 2013|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|accessdate=July 1, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228171844/http://www.idolator.com/7478449/lady-gaga-the-fame-stan-and-deliver/2|archivedate=February 28, 2014}}</ref>

He didn't just capture the fashion; he captured the artist."|source=—Gaga talking about the inspiration behind the video<ref name="revolution"/>}}

The music video of "LoveGame" was directed by [[Joseph Kahn]] and premiered on March 23, 2009, in Australia, and on August 13, 2009, in the UK on [[4Music]] channel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.promonews.tv/2009/03/23/lady-gaga%E2%80%99s-love-games-by-joseph-kahn/|title=Lady Gaga's Love Games by Joseph Kahn|last=Knight|first=David|date=March 23, 2009|publisher=Promo News|accessdate=November 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329103440/http://www.promonews.tv/2009/03/23/lady-gaga%E2%80%99s-love-games-by-joseph-kahn/|archivedate=March 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kissfmuk.com/2009/08/14/lady-gaga-love-game/|title=Lady Gaga: LoveGame UK video premiere|accessdate=August 13, 2009|publisher=[[KISS-FM]]|location=United Kingdom|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208091907/http://www.kissfmuk.com/2009/08/14/lady-gaga-love-game/|archivedate=December 8, 2012}}</ref> The video mainly takes place in a subway station, hence several scenes are reminiscent to [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" music video, which was also shot in a similar location.

Gaga spoke to Whitney Pastorek of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' during a "Behind the Scenes" episode of the shoot, about her inspirations for the video. She wanted to have a "giant" dance video with "LoveGame", describing it as "plastic, beautiful, gorgeous, sweaty, tar on the floor". There would be scary and dangerous looking men also in the video. Gaga had the idea of portraying herself and her co-actors as New York inhabitants taking on the role of designers, performance artists, dancers etc. She enlisted people from downtown New York as dancers, who normally would not get cast in a video.<ref name="QualityofBad"/>

One of the props developed for the video was a pair of sunglasses made of wire. According to Gaga, she imagined "a downtown, bad-ass kid walking down the street with his buddies, grabbing a pair of pliers, and making a pair of sunglasses out of a fence on the street". She wore them on the opening shot of the music video along with a chain link [[Hood (headgear)|hood garment]], saying that "they look so hard. It looks like I plied them right out of the fence and put them on my face".<ref name="QualityofBad"/>

The video starts with the heading "Streamline presents" and three men moving through [[Times Square]]. They open a manhole cover on which "Haus of Gaga" is written. Gaga is then shown naked with blue and purple paint and glitter on her body, frolicking with two men who have the words "Love" and "Fame" shaved into their heads. The scene shifts to a subway where Gaga starts singing in a grey-white [[leotard]] with a hood. She carries her characteristic disco stick and wears chain-linked glasses. The chorus starts with Gaga and her dancers progressing through the subway and dancing down a staircase. Two [[harlequin]] [[Great Dane]]s, are also shown on top of the staircase.<ref name="revolution">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1606964/lady-gagas-pop-revolution-continues-with-lovegame/|title=Lady Gaga's pop revolution continues with 'LoveGame'|accessdate=March 29, 2009|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=March 13, 2009|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202223648/http://www.mtv.com/news/1606964/lady-gagas-pop-revolution-continues-with-lovegame/|archivedate=December 2, 2014}}</ref>

The music video was censored in many countries after its release in 2009. The video faced censorship troubles in Australia where it was rated M by [[Network Ten]] for the "suggestive video footage involving [[bondage (sexual)|bondage]] and [[human sexual behavior|sexual acts]]". The channel demanded an edited version of the video which would not violate censorship rules.<ref name="videovcensor"/> ''Video Hits'' refused to air the video in its [[Motion picture rating system#Australia|G]]- and [[Motion picture rating system#Australia|PG]]-rated time slots. They cited "numerous sexual references both visually and lyrically" as the reason they could not create a child-friendly edit without bleeping the repeated hook "I wanna take a ride on your disco stick".<ref name="heraldsun"/> However, Australian programs like ''[[Rage (TV program)|Rage]]'' and cable networks [[Channel V Australia|Channel V]] and [[MTV Australia|MTV]] aired the video in its original form.<ref name="videovcensor">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/lady-gaga-love-game-video-banned-from-australian-tv/story-e6frewyr-1225696971822|title=Lady GaGa Love Game video banned from Australian TV|last=Adams|first=Cameron|date=April 7, 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Australian Daily Telegraph]]|page=1|accessdate=April 7, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922131831/http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/lady-gaga-love-game-video-banned-from-australian-tv/story-e6frewyr-1225696971822|archivedate=September 22, 2012}}</ref>

The video also faced a ban from [[MTV Arabia]] citing the same reason as Australia. Since it was very rare to ban videos on MTV, head of MTV Arabia Samer al Marzouki commented, "We represent the young generation's mentality and culture so we can't play something that conflicts with that.
