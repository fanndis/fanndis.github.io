'''Banco Español de Crédito, S.A.''' ({{IPA-es|ˈbaŋko espaˈɲol ðe kɾedito}}), “Spanish Credit Bank”) better known as '''Banesto''', was a Spanish multinational [[financial services]] company.

After the intervention, the team of managers from [[BBVA|BBV]], headed by Alfredo Sáenz, assumed initial control of the bank and were responsible for executing a sanitation plan. On April 25, 1994, [[Banco Santander]] gained control of the bank by winning an auction put forward by the Bank of Spain, thus becoming the largest Spanish financial group. It offered 313.5 million pesetas (US$2 billion), which meant an offer of 762 pesetas per share, compared to the 667 pesetas offered by BBV and 566 of [[Argentaria]].<ref>{{cite news| date=26 April 1994| title=Santander compra Banesto por 313,000 millones y se convierte en el líder bancario| newspaper=El País| trans-title=Santander acquires Banesto for 313,476 million| language=es| url =https://elpais.com/diario/1994/04/26/economia/767311228_850215.html| accessdate=12 June 2020}}</ref>

Outside of Spain, Banesto became well-known as the sponsor of the [[cycling team]] that featured [[Miguel Indurain]], the first rider to win five consecutive [[Tour de France|Tours de France]]. The team is currently known as [[Movistar Team (men's team)|Movistar Team]].

==History==

Banco Español de Crédito is rooted in a French-owned banking company which, promoted by Isaac Pereire, was established in [[Madrid]] on 28 January 1856, under the new Credit Companies Law, bearing the name of ''Spanish Furniture Credit Society''.<ref>{{cite book| last=Faus Mompart| first=Esteban María| title=Regulación y desregulación: notas para la historia de la banca española| trans-title=Regulation and Deregulation: Notes for the History of Spanish Banking| year=2001| publisher=Peninsula| location=Barcelona| pages=46–47| isbn=978-8483073810}}</ref> The company was primarily dedicated to covering the budget deficit of the [[Government of Spain]], through acquisitions of [[public debt]], and the granting of financial credits to public companies.

After the [[Spanish-American War]], the financial reforms of [[Raimundo Fernández Villaverde]] of 1900 and with the repatriation of the capitals of the former American colonies, the shareholders decide to liquidate the company and establish a new one, the ''Credit Bank of Spain'', on 1 May [[1902]], with a capital stock of 20 million [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] represented by 80,000 shares with a nominal value of 250 pesetas. The bank's promoter was a French group chaired by Gustavo Pereire, administrator of the Company of the Iron Roads of Northern Spain. This initiative was joined by Cayetano Sánchez Bustillo and León Cocagne (deputy director of Banco Hipotecario de España) on behalf of a group of Spanish investors. The first headquarters, the Building of the Furniture Credit Society, was located in [[Paseo de Recoletos]], Madrid.

From 1940, Banesto began an expansion and absorption process of other entities that placed it amongst the most prominent Spanish banks. In 1955, Banesto acquired [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Banco de Vitoria]], which it maintained as a subsidiary until its full integration in 2003, and in 1978 it acquired Banco Coca, then chaired by Ignacio Coca.

[[File:Banesto logo.svg|thumb|Former logo of Banesto]]

Banesto acquired [[Banco del Pacifico|Banco del Pacífico]] in 1991 and integrated it. In 1993 it bought Banco de Concepción, but the merger was suspended when the Bank of Spain intervened Banesto. When [[Banco Santander]] acquired Banesto in 1994, they sold Banesto [[Uruguay]], [[Chile]], and Banco Shaw in [[Argentina]]. Banesto Chile was sold to Banco Hipotecario de Fomento de Chile (BHIF). In 1998 [[BBVA]] bought BHIF.

[[Ana Patricia Botín]], daughter of Santander president [[Emilio Botín]], served as [[Executive director|executive]] [[Chair (official)|chair]] of the bank between 2002 and November 2010, when she moved to the position of CEO of [[Santander UK]].

The Santander Group announced in December 2012 that it would purchase the remaining 10% of Banesto that it does not currently own, and will merge the business with the existing Banco Santander business in Spain.<ref>{{cite news |title=Santander absorbs Banesto and Banif and shuts branches |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20754294 |work=BBC News |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref>

In December 1993, the Spanish National Stock Exchange Commission ([[Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores]]) suspended trading shares in Banesto following a fall in value estimated between 6.56% and 6.8%<ref name=":0">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/29/business/ambitious-bank-in-spain-stumbles-and-is-taken-over.html| title=Ambitious Bank in Spain Stumbles and Is Taken Over| last=Riding| first=Alan| date=29 December 1993| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=12 June 2012| language=en-US| issn=0362-4331}}</ref> from 2,135 to 1,995 [[Spanish peseta]]s and sharp increases in loan delinquencies observed by the Spanish government in the previous quarter, Quarter three of 1993.<ref name=":1">{{cite news| url=https://elpais.com/diario/1993/12/29/economia/757119637_850215.html| title=El 'agujero' de Banesto supera los 370.000 millones| trans-title=Banesto's 'hole' exceeds 370,000 million| date=29 December 1993| newspaper=El País| accessdate=12 June 2020| language=es| issn=1134-6582}}</ref>

Alfredo Pastor, then-Secretary of The State for the Economy stated that inspectors from the Bank of Spain had concluded that Banesto lacked resources to cover liabilities and that the management of the bank was not able to secure the necessary financing to remedy the situation.<ref name=":0" /> In addition to its suspension, the Spanish government removed its chairman [[Mario Conde]], replacing him with a board containing representatives of five other private banks: BBV, (now [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria|BBVA]]) , [[Banco Central Hispano|BCH]] (now Santander), Argentaria (now a part of BBVA), [[Santander Bank|Santander]] and [[Banco Popular Español|Popular]] (now Santander)<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the bank was also forced to admit it was directing profits and revenue from some sales of assets into reserves for losses from loans.<ref name=":0" /> The Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pais]]'' dubbed the shortfall in financial resources a "hole", which has had varying estimates.<ref name=":1" /> The British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' cited the shortfall as 605 billion Pesetas<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/black-sheep-banker-charged-with-banesto-fraud-1349714.html| title='Black sheep' banker charged with Banesto fraud| date=1996-05-29| newspaper=The Independent| location=London| first=Elizabeth| last=Nash| language=en| access-date=2019-01-05}}</ref> equating to $7.1 billion as of January 2019 (£5.6bn).<ref>According to Bank of England Data for 31 December 1991 (closest value to date provided).

3) Applying interest per the Bank of England data (£1 in 1993 is £1.94 in 2019)  = £2,891,499,469.49 * £1.94 = £5,609,508,970.8106

Roughly £5.6 billion and $7.1 billion.
