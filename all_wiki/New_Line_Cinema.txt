'''New Line Productions, Inc.''', [[trade name|trading as]] '''New Line Cinema''', is an American [[film production]] studio and a label of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group division of [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]]. It was founded in 1967 by [[Robert Shaye]] as an independent film distribution company, later becoming a film studio. It was acquired by [[Turner Broadcasting System]] in 1994; Turner later merged with Time Warner (now [[WarnerMedia]]) in 1996, and New Line was merged with Warner Bros. Pictures in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/New-Line-Cinema-Inc-company-History.html |title=History of New Line Cinema, Inc. – FundingUniverse |website=Fundinguniverse.com |date= |accessdate=January 17, 2016}}</ref> New Line continues to distribute its films albeit as a part of [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], rather than as a separate media company alongside the latter.

==History==
New Line Cinema was established in 1967 by the then 27-year-old [[Robert Shaye]] as a film distribution company, supplying [[World cinema|foreign]] and [[art film]]s for college campuses in the United States. Shaye operated New Line's offices out of his apartment at 14th Street and Second Avenue in New York City. One of the company's early successes was its distribution of the 1936 [[Cannabis (drug)|anti-cannabis]] propaganda film ''[[Reefer Madness]]'', which became a cult hit on American college campuses in the early 1970s. New Line also released many classic foreign-language films, like ''[[Stay As You Are]]'', ''[[Immoral Tales (film)|Immoral Tales]]'' and ''[[Get Out Your Handkerchiefs]]'' (which became the first New Line film to win an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]).<ref name=history>{{cite magazine| url=https://variety.com/2004/scene/markets-festivals/a-brief-history-2-1117909431/ | magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | title=A brief history | first=Keith | last=Collins | date=August 22, 2004|accessdate=January 10, 2020}}</ref> The studio has also released many of the films of [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]].

In 1976, New Line secured funding to produce its first full-length feature, ''[[Stunts (film)|Stunts]]'' (1977), directed by [[Mark Lester]]. Although not considered a critical success, the film performed well commercially on the international market and on television.<ref name="newline1">{{cite web|url=http://newline.com/aboutus.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103091820/http://newline.com/aboutus.html |archivedate=2012-01-03 |title=New Line Cinema : About Us |publisher=Newline.com |accessdate=2011-08-23}}</ref> 

In 1980, Shaye's law school classmate [[Michael Lynne]] became outside counsel and adviser to the company and renegotiated its debt.<ref name=history/><ref name=towers>{{cite magazine| url=https://variety.com/2004/scene/markets-festivals/the-two-towers-1117909426/ | magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | title=The Two Towers | first=David | last=Hafetz | date=August 22, 2004|accessdate=January 10, 2020}}</ref>

In 1983, [[Bryanston Distributing Company]], the company that originally distributed the original ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', lost the rights to that film, and the rights reverted back to the original owners, New Line bought the rights and re-released the film to theatres in that same year became very successful for the studio.<ref name="BozInterview">{{cite video|people= Bozman, Ron (Production manager)|date=2008|title= The Business of Chain Saw: Interview with Ron Bozman from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|medium=DVD|publisher= Dark Sky Films|location=|time=0:11:40–0:16:25}}</ref>

New Line expanded its film production in the early 1980s, producing or co-producing films including ''[[Alone in the Dark (1982 film)|Alone in the Dark]]'' and ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'', directed by [[John Waters]]. ''Polyester'' was one of the first films to introduce a novelty cinema experience named [[Odorama]], where members of the audience were provided with a set of "scratch and sniff" cards to be scratched and sniffed at specific times during the film, which provided an additional sensory connection to the viewed image.<ref name="newline1" /> In 1983, Lynne joined the board.<ref name=history/>

===A Nightmare on Elm Street===
''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' was produced and released by New Line in 1984. The resulting [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|franchise]] was New Line's first commercially successful series, leading the company to be nicknamed "The House that [[Freddy Krueger|Freddy]] Built". The film was made on a budget of $1.8 million and grossed over $57 million.<ref name=ww>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 10, 1992|page=36|first=Chris|last=Mitchell|title=Shrewd marketing fuels Freddy promotion}}</ref> A year later, ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]'' was released, and grossed $3.3 million in its first three days of release and over $30 million at the US box office. In 1986, the company went public.<ref name=history/>

The third film in the series, ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'', was released in 1987, the studio's first national release,<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=New Line Adds 2 In-House Pics To Production Schedule For '87|page=7|date=May 21, 1986|last=Silverman|first=Michael}}</ref> and opened at number one, grossing $8.9 million for the weekend, a record for an independent film at the time,<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title='Elm Street 3' Sets Indie B.O.

The first six grossed $500 million worldwide<ref name=ww/> and the next three $250 million, for a total of $750 million.

===Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles===
In 1990, Lynne became president and chief operating officer, with Shaye as chairman and chief executive officer.<ref name=history/> The same year, New Line released ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' which became the highest-grossing independent film of all-time with a gross of $135 million in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0100758/?ref_=bo_se_r_1 |title=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=January 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-untold-785653 |title='Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles': Untold Story of the Movie "Every Studio in Hollywood" Rejected |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 2, 2015|accessdate=January 10, 2020}}</ref>  It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'' (1991) which was the second highest-grossing<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/in-winner-s-circle-109686/|title=In Winners Circle|page=I-49|date=August 17, 1993}}</ref> with a gross of $78 million in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web | title=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II (1991) | website= [[Box Office Mojo]] | url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tnmt2.htm | accessdate=January 10, 2020}}</ref> A third, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III]]'' followed in 1993.

===Expansion===
In November 1990, New Line purchased a 52% stake in the television production company [[Sonar Entertainment|RHI Entertainment]] (now [[Sonar Entertainment]]), which would later be sold to [[Hallmark Cards]] in 1994.

In early 1991,  [[Fine Line Features]] was set up as a wholly owned subsidiary headed by [[Ira Deutchman]] and released films including [[Jane Campion]]'s ''[[An Angel at My Table]]'' and [[Gus van Sant]]'s ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Eller|first=Claudia|title=Fine Line Features Enters Coprod'n Arena Via 2 Pix|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=Oct 24, 1991|page=1}}</ref> Halfway through the year, [[Carolco Pictures]], entered into a joint venture with New Line to start Seven Arts, a distribution company which primarily released much of Carolco's low-budget output.<ref>[https://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-19/business/fi-141_1_budget-films Carolco, New Line in Distribution Agreement]</ref> In 1997, ''[[Shine (film)|Shine]]'' received the studio's first nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]<ref name=history/> and their second film to win an Academy Award with [[Geoffrey Rush]]'s win for [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=The Line on Laurels|pages=40–41|date=August 23, 2004}}</ref>

In May 1991, New Line purchased the home video and foreign rights to 600 films held by Sultan Entertainment Holdings (aka Nelson Entertainment Group). The deal also included an 11-film distribution deal with Turner subsidiary [[Castle Rock Entertainment]]. On November 27, 1991, New Line purchased Sultan outright.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1991-09-29/nightmares-turtles-and-profits |title=Nightmares, Turtles And Profits |website=Businessweek.com |date=1991-09-29 |accessdate=2016-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/100240/0000950144-94-000832.txt |format=TXT |title=COMPANY CONFORMED NAME: TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM INC |website=Sec.gov |accessdate=2016-01-17}}</ref>

In 1992, [[Michael De Luca]] became executive vice-president and chief executive officer of the production unit.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Shifts At New Line|page=6|date=October 26, 1992}}</ref>

===Acquisition by Turner and Time Warner===
On January 28, 1994, New Line Cinema was acquired by the [[Turner Broadcasting System]] for $500 million,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-28/business/fi-16459_1_production-schedule|title=New Line to Join Ted Turner Empire Today : Film: With more money, the company is likely to add a few big movies to its annual production schedule|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 28, 1994|accessdate=August 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=January 12, 1995|page=28|edition=61st anniversary|title=Robert Shaye}}</ref> which later merged with [[Time Warner]] in 1996. New Line Cinema was kept as its own separate entity, while fellow Turner-owned studios [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] and Castle Rock Entertainment eventually became units of [[Warner Bros.]] 

During its time as an entity separate from Warner Bros., New Line Cinema continued to operate several divisions, including theatrical distribution, marketing and home video. 

The company's fortunes took a downturn in 1996 after losses on ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996 film)|The Island of Dr. Moreau]]'' and ''[[The Long Kiss Goodnight]]''.<ref name=towers/> In 1999, ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'' became the company's highest grosser (and the highest-grossing independent film).

===''The Lord of the Rings''===
New Line produced [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] which became their most successful films to date, grossing over $2.9 billion worldwide.<ref name=history/> The films were nominated for 30 [[Academy Awards]], including nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] for each film, and won 17, with the final picture, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003) winning a (joint) record eleven, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]],<ref name=history/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/76th-winners.html |title=The 76th Academy Awards (2004) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=20 November 2011 |work=oscars.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929190645/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/76th-winners.html |archivedate=29 September 2012}}</ref> as well as being the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|second highest-grossing film of all time]] at the time of its release.<ref>{{cite web |title=All Time Worldwide Box Office |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040605104640/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/ |archivedate=5 June 2004}}</ref>

Despite the success of ''The Lord of the Rings'' films, ''[[Town and Country (film)|Town and Country]]'' (2001) generated a loss of $100 million and De Luca left as production head to be replaced by [[Toby Emmerich]].<ref name=towers/> In 2001, Shaye and Lynne became co-chairmen and co-CEO.<ref name=history/>

The studio was also a partner in founding a new distribution company named [[Picturehouse (company)|Picturehouse]] in 2005. Specializing in [[independent film]], Picturehouse was formed by Bob Berney, who left distributor [[Newmarket Films]], New Line, who folded their Fine Line division into Picturehouse, and [[HBO Films]], a division of [[HBO]] and a subsidiary of Time Warner, who was interested in getting into the theatrical film business.

===Merger with Warner Bros.===
On February 28, 2008, Time Warner's CEO at the time, [[Jeffrey Bewkes]], announced that New Line would be shut down as a separately operated studio. Shaye and Lynne said that they would step down with a letter to their employees. They promised, however, along with Time Warner and Jeffery Bewkes, that the company would continue to operate its financing, producing, marketing and distributing operations of its own films, but would do so as a part of Warner Bros. and be a smaller studio, releasing a smaller number of films than in past years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/02/28/its-official-new-line-cinema-is-dead |title=It's Official – New Line Cinema is Dead! |first=Alex |last=Billington |date=February 28, 2008 |publisher=FirstShowing.net}}</ref> The box office disappointment of ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]'' was largely blamed for the decision, in which New Line spent $180 million on its development, yet it only grossed $70 million in the United States market.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/dial-d-for-disaster-the-fall-of-new-line-cinema-809545.html | location=London |work=The Independent | title=Dial 'D' for disaster: The fall of New Line Cinema | date=April 16, 2008}}</ref> In March, Emmerich became president and chief operating officer, whilst both founders Robert Shaye and Michael Lynne had left the company.

On May 8, 2008, it was announced that Picturehouse would shut down in the fall.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.variety.com/VR1117985299.html | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | title=Picturehouse, WIP to close shop | first1=Dade | last1=Hayes | first2=Dave | last2=McNary | date=May 8, 2008}}</ref> Berney later bought the Picturehouse trademarks from Warner Bros. and relaunched the company in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/01/sundance-the-berneys-are-back-and-theyve-got-metallica|title=The Berneys are Back with Picturehouse, and Now They've got Metallica|last=Fleming|first=Mike|publisher=Deadline Hollywood|date= January 15, 2013|accessdate=2013-01-15}}</ref>

New Line moved from its long-time headquarters on Robertson Boulevard in Los Angeles in June 2014 to Warner Bros.' lot Building 76, formerly used by [[Legendary Entertainment]], a former Warner Bros. film co-financier.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=New Line Leaving Longtime Los Angeles HQ, Moving to Burbank|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/new-line-leaving-longtime-los-angeles-hq-moving-to-burbank-1201078769/|accessdate=October 30, 2014|work=Variety|date=January 30, 2014}}</ref> The last film released by New Line Cinema as a free-standing company was the [[Will Ferrell]] film ''[[Semi-Pro]]''.

As for the company's future, [[Alan Horn]], the Warner Bros. president at the time of the consolidation, stated, "There's no budget number required. They'll be doing about six per year, though the number may go from four to seven; it's not going to be 10." As to content, "New Line will not just be doing genre [...] There's no mandate to make a particular kind of movie."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117988209.html?categoryid=1019&cs=1 | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | title=New Line still has irons in fire | first=Dave | last=McNary | date=June 27, 2008}}</ref>
