On 9 March 2020, the [[government of Italy]] under [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] [[Giuseppe Conte]] imposed a national [[quarantine]], restricting the movement of the population except for necessity, work, and health circumstances, in response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Italy|growing pandemic]] of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in the country. Additional lockdown restrictions mandated the temporary closure of non-essential shops and businesses. This followed a restriction announced on the previous day which affected sixteen million people in the whole region of [[Lombardy]] and in fourteen largely-neighbouring provinces in [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Veneto]], [[Piedmont]] and [[Marche]], and prior to that a smaller-scale lockdown of ten municipalities in the [[province of Lodi]] and one in the [[province of Padua]] that had begun in late February. The restrictions were loosened in May 2020.

All non-essential shops and services were ordered to close, and police were granted powers to issue fines, send people home, especially persons suspected of being infected, and to break up gatherings of more than two people. The British population was instructed to stay home, except for exercise once a day (such as running, walking or cycling), shopping for essential items, any medical need, providing care to a vulnerable person, or travelling to work where the work in question was vital and could not be done from home.

These included not leaving their home at all, even for essential reasons, and keeping two meters apart from other household members.

The April lockdown left an significant impact on the economy, resulting in shrinking it by a fifth, i.e. 20%. The "circuit-breaker" lockdown, which is expected to be relatively less intense could hit the economy by 5% or more. As per Capital Economics, the estimated time required for the economy to get back to the pre-pandemic levels is a year to 2023.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54543654|title=How much economic damage would a circuit-breaker lockdown do?|access-date=14 October 2020|website=BBC News|archive-date=14 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201014142827/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54543654|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 11 May, the UK-wide rules fractured and separate rules were announced at various times for the country's constituent territories. In England, the slogan changed to "Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives" and those who could not work from home, including specifically construction and manufacturing workers, were encouraged to return to work albeit avoiding the use of public transport. Additionally, the once-a-day limit on exercise was lifted. The COVID-19 threat level system was introduced, and the "Stay Home" phase was announced to be equivalent to Level 4 (where 1 meant "COVID-19 is not known to be present in the UK", and 5 meant "The circulation of COVID-19 is high and rising exponentially and there is a material risk of healthcare being overwhelmed"). Meanwhile, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland retained "Stay home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives" for the time being.

On 13 May,  those in England were allowed to meet one other person not from their household outside whilst maintaining a 2-metre social distance,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52641373|title=House moves and viewings to resume in England|work=BBC News|date=12 May 2020|access-date=2020-11-03 |quote=''As the government has indicated, people can go outdoors with other members of their household, alone or with one other person from a different household.''}}</ref> and from 28 May groups of up to six from different households were allowed to meet outside, keeping a safe distance.

From 1 June, English primary schools were encouraged to re-open to Reception, Year 1 and Year 6, and extremely vulnerable people shielding at home were advised it was safe to go outside for once-daily, socially-distanced exercise, for the first time in approximately two months.

From 15 June, non-essential retail reopened, and English secondary schools were asked to prepare to provide Year 10 and Year 12 students with some face-to-face meetings to support their home learning for essential upcoming exams the next year. It also became mandatory to wear face coverings in healthcare settings and on public transport.

From 4 July, most other businesses were allowed to reopen, except for those considered to pose the highest risk such as indoor gyms, and social gathering rules were relaxed further. Most notably, the two-meter rule was relaxed to one meter apart, where other mitigations such as face coverings were being used. The only legal measure that remained, except for face coverings on public transport and in healthcare, was an upper legal limit of 30 on gatherings (except in 'local lockdown' areas, see below), but people were advised to limit gatherings to either two households in any indoor or outdoor, public or private setting, or to a maximum of six, outdoors only, when people gathering were from more than two households.

From 24 July, it became mandatory in England to wear a face covering in shops and supermarkets.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shearing |first=Hazel |title=Coronavirus: New face covering rules in force in England |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53522129 |work=www.bbc.co.uk |location=UK |date=24 July 2020 |access-date=2020-10-06 |archive-date=6 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201006170807/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53522129 |url-status=live }}</ref>

By 15 August, most other businesses, including indoor theatres, casinos and bowling alleys, had been allowed to reopen. Nightclubs and sexual entertainment venues, however, remained closed.

Schools reopened full-time from September, and from 9 September, the slogan changed once more, to "Hands, Face, Space" reminding the public to wash or sanitize hands often, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, and keep a space of one meter or more from others.

Through the month of November, mass asymptomatic testing brought the case rate in [[Liverpool]] down enough for it to move down from Tier 3 into Tier 2.

After that, a [[The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (All Tiers) (England) Regulations 2020|new tiered approach]] was put into place, to be reviewed on 16 December (with any changes coming into force three days later). For 5 days over the [[Christmas]] period (23–27 December), these restrictions are to be relaxed, allowing for three households to meet and form a protective "bubble" during this time period.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Belam |first1=Martin |title=Tier 3 lockdown rules in England: latest Covid restrictions explained |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/02/tier-3-lockdown-rules-in-england-latest-covid-restrictions-explained |access-date=2 December 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=2 December 2020}}</ref>

==Countries and territories without lockdowns==

Almost all countries and territories affected with COVID-19 have introduced and enforced some form of lockdown. However, countries like South Korea and Taiwan, which relied on contact tracing by cellphones, have far fewer cases and deaths. Among the countries not following this strategy is, most notably, Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/vodka-saunas-and-resisting-lockdown---the-countries-taking-a-different-approach-to-coronavirus-2020-04-07|title=Vodka, saunas, lockdown resistance and a gradual return to normal life: The countries taking a different approach to the coronavirus pandemic|website=Market Watch|language=en|access-date=26 April 2020|archive-date=28 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200428200322/https://www.marketwatch.com/story/vodka-saunas-and-resisting-lockdown---the-countries-taking-a-different-approach-to-coronavirus-2020-04-07|url-status=live}}</ref> Measures in Sweden included the closing of universities and high schools and asking older and at-risk residents to avoid social contact, while keeping restaurants, primary schools and kindergartens open.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/covid-19-still-no-sign-lockdown-sweden|title=Covid-19: Still No Sign of Lockdown for Sweden|website=Institut Montaigne|language=en|access-date=26 April 2020|archive-date=28 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200428003637/https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/covid-19-still-no-sign-lockdown-sweden|url-status=live}}</ref>

Economists generally supported increased government funding for mitigation efforts, even at the cost of tolerating a very large economic contraction.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, Google has consistently collected [https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/ data on movements], showing rapid declines in public activity long before legal restrictions were imposed. An [https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us04082020_uksb19.pdf April poll] found that 93% of Americans voluntarily chose to only leave home when necessary, regardless of legal restrictions.
