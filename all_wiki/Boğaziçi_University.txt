'''Boğaziçi University''' is a major research university located on the European side of the [[Bosphorus|Bosphorus strait]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]. It has four faculties and two schools offering undergraduate degrees, and six institutes offering graduate degrees. The language of instruction is English.

Founded in 1863, as [[Robert College]], it is the first [[Higher education in the United States|American higher education institution]] founded outside the [[United States]]. Though under entirely Turkish administration today, the university still maintains strong ties to the American educational system.

Boğaziçi University consistently ranks highest in Turkey, having the greatest number of applicants via the [[TYT-AYT]] Turkish university entrance examinations.<ref name="tanitim.boun.edu.tr">[https://tanitim.boun.edu.tr/2019-taban-puanlari] 2019 YKS SONUÇLARINA GÖRE BOĞAZİÇİ ÜNİVERSİTESİ BÖLÜMLERİNİN TAVAN-TABAN PUANLARI VE SIRALAMALARI</ref> The well-known programs are electrical and electronics engineering,<ref>[https://ee.boun.edu.tr/] BOUN EE</ref> computer engineering,<ref>[https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/] BOUN CmpE</ref> and industrial engineering.<ref>[http://www.ie.boun.edu.tr//] BOUN IE</ref> Only the top 800 of the approximately 1.8 million participants in the annual Turkish university entrance examination (TYT-AYT) are admitted to register for these subjects at the University.<ref name="tanitim.boun.edu.tr"/> To be admitted into other degree programs, one usually has to be in the top 1% of the university entrance exam as well.

In 1863, Robert College was founded in the [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]] by [[Christopher Robert]], a wealthy American philanthropist, and [[Cyrus Hamlin]], a [[missionary]] devoted to education. Six years after its foundation, with the permission ({{Lang-ota|[[Irade-i senniye|irade]]}}) of the [[Ottoman Sultan]], the first campus (the current-day South Campus) was built in [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]] at the ridge of the [[Rumelihisarı|Rumelian Castle]], very close to a [[Bektashi]] tekke, whose leaders maintained an excellent relationship with the [[Congregational church|Congregational]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] founders of Robert College, according to Dr. [[Friedrich Schrader]], a German lecturer at Robert College during the 1890s.<ref>[[Friedrich Schrader]] in: Robert College, Nord und Süd, November 1919, S. 165–169 (Article in German language)</ref>  The first building of the school was named "Hamlin Hall" in memory of [[Cyrus Hamlin]]. In 1878, [[Christopher Robert]] died. According to the article ''A Millionaire's Will,'' published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' (27 November 1878), Robert left a great portion of his wealth to the college.<ref name=news>{{cite news

A College Catalog was compiled in 1878–1879, giving general information and an outline of the courses of study. Defining the aims of the college the catalog stated: "The object of the College is to give to its students, without distinction of race or religion, a thorough educational equal in all respects to that obtained at a first-class American college and based upon the same general principles."{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

After Hamlin, Robert College was administrated by [[George Washburn (educator)|George Washburn]] (1877–1903)<ref>{{cite book

Robert College, in the past had [[junior high school]], [[high school]], and [[university]] sections under the names ''Robert Academy'', ''Robert Yüksek'' and ''American College for Girls''.

The [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]] campus and academic staff were turned over to the [[Republic of Turkey]] for use as a public university named Boğaziçi University, the renamed continuation of Robert College's university section.

{{quote|"Through the education of succeeding generations of students, Robert College has assisted the economic and social progress in the Near East. It has also brought direct benefits to several generations of Americans—faculty members, trustees, students, contributors, and other friends of the College. Their close association with the heroic and hospitable people of Turkey has led to a greater appreciation of Turkish life and culture and the strong foundations on which the Republic of Turkey, our close friend and partner in peace, has been built. I send my cordial congratulations to the officers and friends of Robert College on the century of service you are so deservedly celebrating."

Boğaziçi University operates on six campuses in Istanbul. Four of these campuses (South Campus, North Campus, Hisar Campus, and Uçaksavar Campus) are close to each other and located on a hill in the affluent district of [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]] on the European side of Istanbul, overlooking the Bosphorus (hence the name). The Kennedy Lodge, named after [[John F. Kennedy]], is located at the South Campus and operates as a welcoming facility for visiting professors and staff. The Kandilli Campus is right across from the shore, located on the Asian side of Istanbul (in [[Çengelköy]]) and hosts the [[Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute]] (KOERI). The newest campus is in [[Kilyos]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast and is home to a private beach. The South Campus is the most popular campus among students and visitors alike.

{{Cleanup|date=January 2020|reason=the section is disorganized and contains grammatical errors.|section}}
The University has ten [[Dormitory|dormitories]] on its different campuses. 1. Men's and 1. Women's Dorms are located on the South Campus and they are among the oldest buildings of the school. One other name of the 1. Men's Dorm building is Hamlin Hall and 1. Women's Dorm is also known by the name of Zeynep-Ayşe Birkan Women's Domitory. By accommodating at these two historical buildings, students get the chance of participating in the active social and historical life of Boğaziçi University.
There are 4 dormitories on the North Campus. 1st and 2nd North Dormitories were opened to service after the year of 1985. While the former serves as a female dorm, the latter is for males. They have similar architectural designs. 3rd North Dorm was opened in the year of 2010 and currently it has been serving for female students. The last dorm of the North Campus is 4th North Dorm, which has been in service since 2011. Some of the electricity energy consumed in the dorm is being met thanks to its solar panels located on the roof of the building.
On its Kilyos Campus, which is approximately one-hour away from the center, 1st and 3rd Kilyos Dormitories are located. 1st Kilyos Dorm serves to female students while the male students accommodate at the 3rd Kilyos Dorm. Opened to service in 2014, 3rd Kilyos Dorm building has a work and fitness room, laundry facilities, a computer lab, and a prayer room.
Apart from those mentioned above, Superdorm and Kandilli Dorm also provide accommodation to Boğaziçi University students. Put into service in the 1998–99 academic year, Superdorm enables the students to socialize and experience the dorm life with higher service quality. As to the Kandilli Dorm, it was opened to service in the year of 2017 on the Kandilli Campus right across the Bosphorus. Only female students accommodate at the Kandilli Campus. The waste water collected from the bathroom is reused in the toilet reservoirs after the treatment process.
