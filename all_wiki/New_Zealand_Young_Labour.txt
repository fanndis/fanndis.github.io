'''Young Labour''' ({{lang-mi|Te Rangatahi Reipa}}) is the combined [[youth wing]] and [[student wing]] of the [[New Zealand Labour Party]]. It hosts an annual conference and holds a range of additional national events, including fringe sessions at the Labour Party's annual conference. All Labour Party members aged 15 to 26 years old are members of Young Labour.<ref name="constitution">{{cite web|title=The Constitution of New Zealand Young Labour|url=http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/younglabournz/pages/33/attachments/original/1490089278/Young_Labour_Constitution.pdf|publisher=Young Labour|accessdate=15 June 2017|date=16 April 2016}}</ref>

==Activities==
Young Labour has worked on issues ranging from climate change and improved rental housing standards to liquor law reform and to opposing [[Voluntary student membership#The New Zealand situation|voluntary student membership]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Although Young Labour is not an organisation which necessarily leads to a political career in Parliament, many of the [[Fifth Labour Government]]'s Cabinet, including former [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Helen Clark]] and former Labour Party leader [[Phil Goff]] began their political activism in Young Labour, as did the current Prime Minister of the [[Sixth Labour Government]], [[Jacinda Ardern]].

===Conference===
The Young Labour Conference, held annually, typically in April, and doubling as the sector's [[Annual General Meeting]], is the highest decision-making body of Young Labour. It elects the Executive, alters the Constitution and decides the sector's policy priorities for the current year.<ref name="constitution"/> The Conference also functions as a social and activism highlight on the Young Labour calendar, with addresses from [[members of Parliament]] and activities such as [[canvassing]] commonly being a part of the programme.<ref>[http://younglabour.org.nz/conference YL Conference - Young Labour], Young Labour website. Accessed 18/06/2013.</ref>

===Policy Priorities===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
Each year Young Labour selects a number of policy priorities at its conference. These become the target for Young Labour members to ensure their passage at the Annual Conference of the Labour Party. These are advanced by Young Labour members playing an active role in debates at the Regional and Annual Conferences of the Party. In addition, Young Labour elects a representative to the Party's Policy Council who plays a role in ensuring Young Labour members' policy ideas are heard in the party.

===Campaigns===
Young Labour is an important part of the Labour Party's volunteer base at national and local elections. Young Labour members are involved in canvassing, election-day volunteering, and campaign managing across the country. Young Labour also runs public campaigns on certain political or policy issues that the sector deems important to young people. In addition, Young Labour runs an annual Campaign Leadership School to train members in the skills of executing successful political campaigns, and a Summer School (open to the wider party) to have discussions and workshops on the wider direction of Labour in government and in opposition.<ref>[http://younglabour.org.nz/campaign-leadership-school Campaign Leadership School - Young Labour] Young Labour website. Accessed 18/06/2013.</ref><ref>[http://younglabour.org.nz/summer-school Summer School - Young Labour] Young Labour website Accessed 18/06/2013.</ref>

===Clarion Tour===
In the week preceding Summer School, a group of Young Labour members travel to cities around New Zealand on a volunteer community service tour. Members play a role in assisting and highlighting the work that volunteer community groups play in New Zealand society by providing a day or half-day's labour at each organisation.<ref>[http://younglabour.org.nz/clarion-tour Clarion Tour - Young Labour] Young Labour website.

==Structure==

===Executive===
The Young Labour executive is elected annually at the Young Labour Conference and includes representatives from every region. There are currently 21 elected members.

===Regions and Branches===
In line with the organisation of the wider Labour Party, Young Labour is organised into six geographical regions for the purposes of campaigns and policy debate.<ref>[http://younglabour.org.nz/regions Regions - Young Labour] Young Labour website. Accessed 18/06/2013.</ref>

Within these regions, the primary unit of organisation are a number of Special Branches or University Branches of the Labour Party. Some, like [[Princes Street Labour]] and [[Vic Labour]] are based around universities, whereas others are based in regional centres. There are also branches catering for [[Māori people|Māori]], [[Pacific Islander]] or [[teenage]] members of the sector.<ref>[http://younglabour.org.nz/branches Branches - Young Labour] Young Labour website.

A Young Labour Summer School did not take place in 2019, which many commentators attributed to the controversy surrounding the previous year's summer camp.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed|date=September 2019}} The alleged perpetrator pleaded not guilty to six charges of indecent assault in July 2018 and was granted interim name suppression.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Livingston |first1=Tommy |title=Labour Party summer camp accused pleads not guilty |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/105222563/labour-party-summer-camp-accused-appears?rm=a |accessdate=4 September 2019 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=5 July 2018}}</ref> In September 2018, the Crown dropped two of these charges against the accused.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Owen |first1=Catrin |title=Two charges dropped against man accused of sexual assaults at Labour Party summer camp |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/107027711/two-charges-dropped-against-man-accused-of-sexual-assaults-at-labour-party-summer-camp?rm=a |accessdate=4 September 2019 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=12 September 2019}}</ref> On 2 September 2019, trial proceedings against the defendant began at the Auckland District Court.
