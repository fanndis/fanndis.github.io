'''{{Audio|De-Annette_Schavan.ogg|Annette Schavan}}''' (born 10 June 1955) is a German politician of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU). She was the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Minister of Education and Research]] in the government of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] from 2005 to 2013, when she resigned following the revocation of her doctorate due to plagiarism. From 2014 until 2018 she served as the German Ambassador to the [[Holy See]]. From April 2018, she also briefly served as first German Ambassador to the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.orderofmalta.int/2018/04/27/german-ambassador-credentials-lieutenant-grand-master/ |title=First german Ambassador presents her credentials to the Lieutenant of the Grand Master |publisher=[[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] |date=2018-04-27}}</ref>

Throughout her political career, Schavan was widely known to be a friend and a confidante of Merkel’s.<ref>Nicholas Kulish and Chris Cottrell (9 February 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/world/europe/german-education-chief-quits-in-scandal-reflecting-fascination-with-titles.html German Fascination With Degrees Claims Latest Victim: Education Minister] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref><ref>Ralf Neukirch (11 October 2005), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany-s-new-chancellor-merkel-s-surprising-rise-to-the-top-a-379211.html Germany's New Chancellor: Merkel's Surprising Rise to the Top] ''[[Spiegel Online]]''.</ref>

==Early life==
Schavan was born in [[Jüchen]] on 10 June 1955.<ref name="rtl">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rtl.de/themen/personen/annette-schavan-t9350.html |title=Alle Infos & News zu Annette Schavan |website=rtl.de |language=de |access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>

==Political career==
From 1995 until 2005, Schavan served as State Minister of Cultural Affairs, Youth, and Sports for the German state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] in the governments of successive minister-president [[Erwin Teufel]] and [[Günther Oettinger]]. During this time, she oversaw school education in Baden-Württemberg. One controversy that erupted during this time was when a Muslim teacher was banned from wearing a [[head scarf]] in school, as that was interpreted as a religious symbol, while at the same time allowing Catholic nuns to wear their traditional habits. The argument was that the habits of nuns and monks have an official function, while a Muslim headscarf is optional.

Schavan was regarded as a possible Christian Democratic candidate for [[President of Germany|Germany's presidency]] in 2004, but [[Horst Köhler]] was nominated and elected instead. In 2005, she attempted to succeed [[Erwin Teufel]] as Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg, but she was defeated by her rival [[Günther Oettinger]] in the internal elections of the CDU. Oettinger's referendum win – with 60.6 percent of the vote versus 39.4 percent for Schavan – was widely seen at the time as a defeat for Teufel, who had promoted Schavan as his preferred successor.

Under the leadership of party chairwoman [[Angela Merkel]], Schavan was re-elected vice-chairwoman of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] in November 2006, this time alongside minister-presidents [[Roland Koch]], [[Jürgen Rüttgers]] and [[Christian Wulff]].<ref>[http://www.n-tv.de/politik/dossier/Merkels-bunte-Truppe-article200886.html CDU-Stellvertreter: Merkels bunte Truppe] ''[[n-tv]]'', 27 November 2006.</ref>

Schavan served as Federal Minister of Education from 2005 to February 2013. Following the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal elections]], she was part of the [[CDU/CSU]] team in the negotiations with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] on a coalition agreement. She led her party's delegation in the working group on education and research policy; her co-chair of the FDP was [[Andreas Pinkwart]].

In an effort to increase the share of female university lecturers and tenured professors, Schavan introduced a €150 million equal-opportunities program under which the federal government paid the salary of between one and three additional posts for highly qualified female academics that proved a commitment to redressing the gender imbalance.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/sexism-in-germany-universities-rewarded-for-hiring-women-professors-a-576238.html Universities Rewarded for Hiring Women Professors] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', 4 September 2008.</ref>

In 2010, Schavan led efforts to enlist [[imam]]s educated at German universities to improve the integration of young Muslims. Under a plan devised by the [[German Council of Science and Humanities]], imams were to be trained at two or three German universities, in accordance with the German [[curriculum]]. In addition to theology, the new preachers would also study education and [[community organizing]]. In a competition, the universities of [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], [[University of Münster|Münster]] and [[University of Osnabrück|Osnabrück]] were selected for the program.<ref>Andrea Brandt and Maximilian Popp (16 September 2010), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/imams-made-in-germany-will-efforts-to-train-homegrown-muslim-leaders-fail-a-717512.html Imams Made in Germany: Will Efforts to Train Homegrown Muslim Leaders Fail?] ''[[Spiegel Online]]''.</ref>

On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the [[Germany–India relations|diplomatic relations]] between German and [[India]], Schavan participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the two countries' governments in [[Delhi]] in May 2011.<ref>Günther Bannas (30 May 2011), [https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/hoffnung-auf-eurofighter-geschaeft-erste-deutsch-indische-regierungskonsultationen-1640384.html Hoffnung auf „Eurofighter“-Geschäft: Erste deutsch-indische Regierungskonsultationen] ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''.</ref>

In 2012, Schavan chaired the Joint Science Conference (GWK), a body which deals with all questions of research funding, science and research policy strategies and the science system that jointly affect the federal government and the 16 federal states.

Following her resignation, Schavan was succeeded by [[Johanna Wanka]].<ref name=spie9213>{{cite news|title=Merkel Loses Minister: Schavan Steps Down amid Plagiarism Scandal|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-882398.html|accessdate=9 February 2013|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=9 February 2013}}</ref>

Ahead of the Christian Democrats' [[2018 Christian Democratic Union of Germany leadership election|leadership election]] in 2018, Schavan publicly endorsed [[Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer]] to succeed Angela Merkel as the party’s chair.<ref>Christian Rothenberg (5 December 2018), [https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/kampf-um-den-cdu-vorsitz-so-gross-sind-die-lager-der-unterstuetzer-fuer-merz-spahn-und-kramp-karrenbauer/23718502.html So groß sind die Lager der Unterstützer für Merz, Spahn und Kramp-Karrenbauer] ''[[Handelsblatt]]''.</ref><ref>Christopher Ziedler (4 December 2018), [https://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.cdu-vorsitz-umfragen-fuer-akk-wahlaufrufe-fuer-merz.14d21bed-8708-4cf0-86cb-720d36a9406d.html Umfragen für AKK, Wahlaufrufe für Merz] ''[[Stuttgarter Zeitung]]''.</ref><ref>Maria Stöhr (6 December 2018), [https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/cdu-parteitag-fuer-welchen-kandidaten-sich-prominente-politiker-aussprechen-a-1242253.html Kampf um die Merkel-Nachfolge: Wer wählt wen?] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.</ref>

==Plagiarism==
Amid the [[Causa Guttenberg|plagiarism scandal]] that led to the resignation of [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg]] as [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence of Germany]] on 1 March 2011, Schavan was quoted in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' as saying that "intellectual theft is not a small thing".<ref>Charles Hawley (1 March 2011), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/copy-paste-and-delete-the-downfall-of-defense-minister-guttenberg-a-748383.html The Downfall of Defense Minister Guttenberg] ''[[Spiegel Online]]''.</ref> In 2012, a [[blog]]ger with the [[pseudonym]] Robert Schmidt who is a member of the research-network [[VroniPlag Wiki]] alleged he had found plagiarism in Schavan's PhD thesis,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schavanplag.wordpress.com/|title=Schavanplag|publisher=Schavanplag|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> entitled "Character and conscience – Studies on the conditions, necessities, and demands on the development of conscience in the present day."<ref>{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Gretchen|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/05/german-research-minister-faces.html?ref=ra |title=German Research Minister Faces Plagiarism Allegations|publisher=ScienceInsider|date=May 2012|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref><ref>Christoph Titz: ''[http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/plagiat-verdacht-gegen-schavan-schavanplag-autor-im-interview-a-831459.html Anonymous Schavan-accuser: „I don't want this evidence to be suppressed“].''

Investigators found paraphrasing of secondary literature without naming the source in over 60 cases in the dissertation and thereby on 5 February 2013 revoked her doctorate degree because of "systematic and premeditated" deception.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.de/education/20130205-47785.html |title=Education minister loses doctorate for plagiarism|newspaper=The Local|date=5 February 2013|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Jörg Diehl & Oliver Trenkamp|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/education-minister-schavan-has-ph-d-revoked-in-plagiarism-scandal-a-881707.html |title=Plagiarism Accusations: Merkel's Education Minister Has PhD Title Revoked|newspaper=[[Spiegel Online]]|date=6 February 2013|accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref>

On 9 February 2013, it was reported that chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] had accepted Annette Schavan's resignation. Schavan continued to deny any wrongdoing and pursued a court appeal against the process by which [[University of Düsseldorf|the university]] had revoked her doctorate.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/09/german-education-minister-quits-phd-plagiarism German education minister quits over PhD plagiarism] [[The Guardian]], 9 February 2013</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://business-and-science.de/plagiatsaffaere/|title=Plagiatsaffäre - Alle Fälle von A-Z {{!}} Business And Science|language=de|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref> On 20 March 2014 {{ill|Verwaltungsgericht Düsseldorf|lt=a Düsseldorf court|de}} rejected her appeal, however.<ref name=SchavanUrteil>{{cite web|title=VG Düsseldorf · Urteil vom 20.
