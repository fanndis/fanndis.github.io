An '''independent''' or '''nonpartisan politician''' is a politician not affiliated with any [[political party]]. There are numerous reasons why someone may stand for office as an independent.

Some politicians have political views that do not align with the platforms of any political party, and therefore choose not to affiliate with them. Some independent politicians may be associated with a party, perhaps as former members of it, or else have views that align with it, but choose not to stand in its name, or are unable to do so because the party in question has selected another candidate. Others may belong to or support a political party at the national level but believe they should not formally represent it (and thus be subject to its policies) at another level.

In running for public office, independents sometimes choose to form a party or alliance with other independents, and may formally register their party or alliance. Even where the word "independent" is used, such alliances have much in common with a political party, especially if there is an organization which needs to approve the "independent" candidates.

{{Main|Independent politicians in Australia}}

Independents are a recurrent feature of the federal [[Parliament of Australia]], and they are more commonly elected to state parliaments. There have been up to five independents in every federal parliament since 1990, and independents have won twenty-eight times during national elections in that time. A large proportion of independents are former members of one of Australia's four main parties, the [[Australian Labor Party]], the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], the [[Australian Greens]], or the [[National Party of Australia]]. In 2013 a political party named the [[Australian Independents]] was registered with the [[Australian Electoral Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registered_parties/australian-independents.htm|title=Australian Independents|work=Australian Electoral Commission|access-date=19 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330041846/http://aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registered_parties/australian-independents.htm|archive-date=30 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the dissolution of parliament before the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 federal election]], four independents sat in the [[Australian House of Representatives]]: [[Andrew Wilkie]] (Member for [[Division of Denison|Denison]]), [[Cathy McGowan (politician)|Cathy McGowan]] (Member for [[Division of Indi|Indi]]), [[Kerryn Phelps]] (Member for [[Division of Wentworth|Wentworth]]), and [[Julia Banks]] (Member for [[Division of Chisholm|Chisholm]]). Of these, Wilkie had previously been a Greens candidate, McGowan had been a Liberal staffer, and Banks was elected as a Liberal MP before resigning from the party in November 2018. At the 2019 election, Wilkie was re-elected as the Member for [[Division of Clark|Clark]], while McGowan retired, and both Phelps and Banks lost their seats. However, two new independents entered parliament: [[Zali Steggall]] (Member for [[Division of Warringah|Warringah]]) and [[Helen Haines]] (Member for [[Division of Indi|Indi]]).

Independent [[Australian Senate|Senators]] are quite rare. In modern politics, Independent [[Brian Harradine]] served from 1975 to 2005 with considerable influence at times. [[Nick Xenophon]] was the only elected independent Senator after his election to the Senate at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]] and was re-elected for another six-year term at the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/results/senate/sa/|title=Senate Results: South Australia|work=ABC News|access-date=19 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021234552/http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/results/senate/sa/|archive-date=21 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>  He resigned from the Australian Senate in 2017 to contest a seat in the House of Assembly of South Australia.

==Bulgaria==
The [[President of Bulgaria]] [[Rumen Radev]] is an independent with support from the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]. Radev was elected in the [[2016 Bulgarian presidential election|2016 election]].

==Canada==
{{See also|Independent Liberal|Independent Conservative}}

Independent Members of Parliament were numerous in the last decades of the 19th century but diminished as the party system solidified. It remained common, however, to have a small number of [[Independent Liberal]] or [[Independent Conservative]] MPs into the 1950s. Today, election as an independent is far more common at the municipal level. Many municipalities have no tradition of political parties.

Candidates in federal elections who are not affiliated with a party have two options: independent or no affiliation. In the former case, they appear on the ballot with "Independent" following their name; in the second case, they appear with their name only. The two options are otherwise equivalent.

Independent politicians have on occasion held considerable sway in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in recent years, as Canada has been governed by successive [[minority government]]s with independent [[Member of parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) sometimes sharing in the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]. In the [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004 federal election]], [[Chuck Cadman]] was elected to federal parliament as an independent MP representing the [[British Columbia]] [[Riding (division)|riding]] of [[Surrey North]]. Independent [[André Arthur]] was elected in the [[Quebec]] riding of [[Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier]] in the [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006 federal election]], and was the only independent to win a seat in that election; he was re-elected in the [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 federal election]]. MP [[Bill Casey]], who had been expelled from the Conservative Party for voting against the 2007 budget, also ran as an independent in 2008 and retained his seat. In the [[2019 Canadian federal election|2019 federal election]], MP [[Jody Wilson-Raybould]] ran as an independent candidate in the riding of [[Vancouver Granville]] after being expelled from the Liberal Party over the [[SNC-Lavalin affair]]. She was returned to Parliament with 32% of the vote.

The territorial legislatures of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] are [[consensus government]]s with no political parties. All members sit as independents. There are a few independent members of the other provincial and territorial legislatures, which are similar in principle to the federal House of Commons; for example, in the [[2009 British Columbia general election]], independent candidate [[Vicki Huntington]] narrowly defeated incumbent [[Attorney General of British Columbia|Attorney General]] [[Wally Oppal]] in [[Delta South]]. In the [[2019 Newfoundland and Labrador general election|2019 Newfoundland and Labrador provincial election]], two independent candidates were elected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/eddie-joyce-wins-seat-1.5139625|title='Dwight Ball, you can dismiss me, but you can't defeat me': Eddie Joyce nabs seat once again|date=May 17, 2019 |publisher=CBC News|access-date=Oct 17, 2020}}</ref>

==Croatia==
After an inconclusive election in [[2015 Croatian parliamentary election|2015]], [[Tihomir Orešković (politician)|Tihomir Orešković]] was named the first non-partisan [[Prime Minister of Croatia]].

==Finland==
After serving six years on his first term as [[President of Finland]] in the [[National Coalition Party]] from 2012 to 2018, [[Sauli Niinistö]] was elected for his second term in 2018 after running as an independent candidate.

==France==
In France, independent politicians are frequently categorised as ''sans étiquette'' ("without label") in municipal or district elections.

In the nineteenth-century and first half of the twentieth century, most French national politicians were independents. The first modern French political parties date from the early 1900s (foundation of [[Popular Liberal Action|Action Libérale]] and the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]]). The first legislation on political parties dates from 1911, though it was not until 1928 that parliamentarians were required to select a political party for the parliamentary register (either by formally joining a group, or by loosely working with one as an ''apparenté'', or associate), and not until after 1945 that structured political parties came to dominate parliamentary work.

Once elected, independents tended to attach themselves to a parliamentary party. In some cases independent deputies banded together to form a technical group of their own. In 1932, for instance, there were four technical groups created: the left-of-centre [[Independent Left (France)|Independent Left]], with 12 deputies; the centre-right liberal [[Independents of the Left]], with 26 deputies; the right-wing [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Independents of Economic, Social and Peasant Action|Independents for Economic, Social and Peasant Action]], with six deputies; and the far-right [[Monarchism in France|monarchist]] [[Republican Independents|Independent Group]], with 12 deputies - these four technical groups thus accounted for one-tenth of deputies. In addition, the larger parliamentary parties, including the socialist SFIO, centre-left PRRRS, centre-right ARD and conservative FR all included a greater or lesser number of independents who sat with their group for parliamentary work (''apparentés'').

In 1920, [[Alexandre Millerand]] was elected [[President of France|president of the Republic]] under the banner "without label".

However, it is nowadays rare to have independent politicians at national level, if only because independents usually affiliate themselves to an existing political grouping. Noteworthy independents include [[José Bové]] in the 2007 presidential election. [[Emmanuel Macron]] was an independent politician as Minister, but formed his own party to stand in the 2016 presidential election.

From 2001 to 2008 "without label" was no longer used in the nomenclature of the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]]. Candidates and lists presenting themselves as "without label" are classified in DVG (various left), DVD (various right), DVC (various center) or AUT (other) according to their political sensitivity. Therefore, from 2008 onwards, the DIV (miscellaneous) or the LDIV code for the "miscellaneous" list has been created to group unclassifiable or categorical interests and, by default, mayors without a declared label claiming no political sensitivity, be it left, center or right. The AUT (other) grade replaces the DIV grade without changing its definition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/basile/visio.do?id=qSEQ080103109|title=Site du sénat|website=senat.fr|access-date=2017-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323092412/http://www.senat.fr/basile/visio.do?id=qSEQ080103109|archive-date=2019-03-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Georgia==
[[Salome Zourabichvili]] won the [[2018 Georgian presidential election]] as an independent candidate, becoming the first-ever female [[President of Georgia]].

==Germany==
[[Joachim Gauck]], [[President of Germany]] from March 2012 to March 2017 and the first Federal President without party affiliation, was to date the most prominent independent politician. In the [[2010 German presidential election|German presidential election of 2010]] he was the candidate of the  [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]], in [[2012 German presidential election|2012]] the candidate of all major parties except [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]]. His presidency—though his powers are limited—constitutes an exception, as Independent politicians have rarely held high office in German history, at least not since [[World War II]]. It has nevertheless happened that a presidential candidate without any chances of election by the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] was not a party member: for example, when in 1984 the Greens came up with the writer [[Luise Rinser]].

In the [[Bundestag]] parliament nearly all deputies belong to a political party. The voting system of [[mixed-member proportional representation|personalized proportional representation]] (since 1949) allows any individual holding the [[suffrage|passive right to vote]] to stand for a direct [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] in the [[electoral districts]]—299 of the seats in parliament are distributed by districts according to a [[plurality voting system]]. Such a candidate has to present 200 signatures in favor of his candidacy, the same as a candidate of a party that had no parliamentary presentation previously. The first [[1949 West German federal election|Bundestag election in 1949]] saw three independents elected; since then, no party-independent candidate has won a seat.<ref>[http://www.wahlrecht.de/lexikon/parteilose.html Unabhängige Direktkandidaten] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409045602/http://www.wahlrecht.de/lexikon/parteilose.html |date=2019-04-09 }}, last seen October 13th, 2012.</ref> At [[States of Germany|state]] level, the situation is more or less the same: only party members have a real chance to be elected to a [[Landtag]] legislature, and state ministers without party membership are just as rare as at the federal level. However, in [[local election]]s it may occur that an independent politician is elected deputy to [[Districts of Germany|districts]]', cities' and municipalities' assemblies, as well as member of a [[city council]] or even [[mayor]], especially in [[Northern Germany]]. In recent years, independents have formed [[Free Voters]] associations which have had success in local governments. Two such associations have managed to enter state parliaments: the [[Free Voters of Bavaria]] in 2008 and the [[Brandenburg United Civic Movements/Free Voters]] in 2019.

An independent member of parliament, who also is not a member of a voters' association, holds the status of ''fraktionsloser Abgeordneter'', i.e. not affiliated to any [[parliamentary group]]. A representative who leaves his party (and his parliamentary group) and does not join another becomes ''fraktionslos''. In 1989 the Bundestag MP [[Thomas Wüppesahl]], who had left the Green Party in 1987 and was excluded from the Green parliamentary group the next year, obtained more rights as a ''fraktionsloser Abgeordneter'', for example more talking time and representation in a subcommittee, when the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] decided partially in his favor.

After the [[Unification of Germany|German unification]] of 1871, the first [[Chancellor of Germany|Reich Chancellors]] ([[head of government|heads of government]]) ''de jure'' served as [[executive officer]]s of the [[German Empire|German Imperial states]] as non-partisans, usually recruited from the traditional bureaucratic, aristocratic and/or military elites. In the fierce political conflicts during the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] period after [[World War I]], several chancellors and Reich Ministers also had no party affiliation: these chancellors were [[Wilhelm Cuno]] (1922–1923), [[Hans Luther]] (1925–1926), the former [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre]] politician [[Franz von Papen]] (1932), and [[Kurt von Schleicher]] (1932–1933). The last two [[Cabinet of Germany|cabinets]] appointed by Reich President [[Paul von Hindenburg]], a non-partisan (though strongly [[Conservatism in Germany|Conservative]]) himself, were regarded as apolitical cabinets of experts with regard to the rise of the [[Nazi Party]]; many of the ministers were not party members.

Since World War II, only two ministers of (West) German cabinets have not been party members, though "on the ticket" of the major party in the coalition, the Social Democrats: Education Minister [[Hans Leussink]] (1969–1972), and Minister of Economy [[Werner Müller (politician)|Werner Müller]] (1998–2002). Minister of Justice [[Klaus Kinkel]] only shortly after his appointment joined the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democrats]] in 1991. A special case is the former Federal Minister and Chancellor [[Ludwig Erhard]], whose affiliation with the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) has not been conclusively established: although he served as Minister of Economics from 1949 to 1963 and as Federal Chancellor from 1963 to 1966, and was even elected CDU [[party chair]]man in 1966, it seems that he never signed a membership form or paid contributions. Researches by ''[[Der Stern]]'' magazine have revealed a record at the CDU party archives created only in 1968, with the faked date of entry of early March 1949.<ref>[http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/cdu-altkanzler-ludwig-erhard-war-nie-cdu-mitglied-587764.html Stern: Ludwig Erhard war nie CDU-Mitglied] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026225840/http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/cdu-altkanzler-ludwig-erhard-war-nie-cdu-mitglied-587764.html |date=2013-10-26 }}, April 25th, 2007, last seen August 7th, 2012.</ref>

==Hong Kong==
More than half of Hong Kong's [[Legislative Council (Hong Kong)|Legislative Council]] is made up of independents, or members whose political groups are represented by one sole member in the legislature. They are common in [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], and are not rare among [[geographical constituencies]].

==Iceland==
The [[President of Iceland]] (currently [[Guðni Th. Jóhannesson]]) is independent.

==India==
Independent candidates can contest elections on the basis of their personal appeal or to promote an ideology different from any party.Independents currently hold 6 seats in the Indian Parliament.

==Ireland==
{{Main|Independent politicians in Ireland}}

In Ireland, proportional representation, the comparative looseness of formal parties, and strong local sentiment have meant that independents have formed a significant part of the parliamentary landscape since the [[Irish Free State|foundation of the]] state: in the early elections to [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Free State)|Dáil Éireann]] (parliament), independents accounted for [[1922 Irish general election|7% of seats in 1922]], [[1923 Irish general election|8.5% in 1923]], [[June 1927 Irish general election|10.5% in 1927]], and [[1932 Irish general election|9% in 1932]], though with the development of relatively more structured parties their numbers declined thereafter. These were similar proportions to the number of independents elected to other interwar European democracies such as France (see above).

It was not until the 2010s that independents would see a similar electoral success, with record scores for independents surpassing the previous interwar highs.

After the [[2016 Irish general election|Irish general election in 2016]], there were 19 independent [[Teachtaí Dála|TDs]] (parliamentary deputies) in the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] (the lower house of the Irish parliament), representing 12% of the total. Two technical groups were formed by independent deputies to coordinate their activities: the [[Independents4Change]], with four deputies, opposed the government, while the [[Independent Alliance (Ireland)|Independent Alliance]] formed part of the minority government's working majority. A number of other individual independents similarly supported the government, and received cabinet positions.

There are fourteen independent senators in the [[Members of the 25th Seanad|25th]] [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]] (the upper house of the Irish parliament), representing 23% of the total. Three of these are elected by the graduates of the [[National University of Ireland]] and two from [[Trinity College Dublin|Dublin University]]. There are also five independent senators who were nominated by the [[Taoiseach]] and four elected by the technical panels.

==Israel==
The only Israeli politician elected to the [[Knesset]] by his own was [[Shmuel Flatto-Sharon]].

==Italy==
The Prime Ministers [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] (1993–1994), [[Lamberto Dini]] (1995–1996), [[Giuliano Amato]] (2000–2001), [[Mario Monti]] (2011–2013) and [[Giuseppe Conte]] (2018–present) were independent when they were in office. Ciampi was also the [[President of the Italian Republic]] between 1999 and 2006. President [[Sergio Mattarella]], despite being a former member of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] and of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]], was elected president in 2015 as an independent.

==Kosovo==
[[Atifete Jahjaga]] was elected the first female and Independent President of Kosovo{{ref label|status|a|}}. She was also the first female and independent elected leader in the whole of the [[Balkans]].

==Malaysia==
Independents have rarely been elected to the [[Dewan Rakyat]] and state legislative assemblies. In Malaysian elections, many independent candidates lose their election deposit because they had failed to secure at least 12.5% or one-eighth of the total votes cast. Independent [[List of members of the Dewan Negara|Senators]] are quite rare.

In 2010, a group of independent MPs who were sacked from the [[People's Justice Party]] formed a political block called ''[[:ms:Konsensus Bebas|Konsensus Bebas]]''.<ref>[https://weechookeong.com/2010/06/07/konsensus-bebas-formed/ Formation of KONSENSUS BEBAS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419184124/https://weechookeong.com/2010/06/07/konsensus-bebas-formed/ |date=2018-04-19 }} (media statement)</ref> The members were [[Zahrain Mohamed Hashim]] (Bayan Baru), [[Wee Choo Keong]] (Wangsa Maju), [[Zulkifli Noordin]] (Kulim-Bandar Bharu), [[Tan Tee Beng]] (Nibong Tebal) dan [[Mohsin Fadzli Samsuri]] (Bagan Serai). It did not last beyond the 12th General Elections.

{{as of|May 2018}}, three independent MPs were elected in [[Malaysian General Election|GE14]], but later joining [[Pakatan Harapan]] ([[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|PKR]]), thus causing no representation for independent MP for that time. However, as of June 2018 and December 2018, the number increased to 13 independent Members of Parliament that now currently sit in the [[Dewan Rakyat]] as of December 2018.

At the same time in December 2018, almost all members from Sabah [[UMNO]] quit the party and became independent politicians.

Maszlee Malik quit [[Homeland Fighters' Party]] and became an independent MP fighting for education activist.

==Mexico==
[[Jaime Rodríguez Calderón|Jaime Heliodoro Rodríguez Calderón]] (born in 1957), sometimes referred to by his nickname "Bronco", is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] politician who is the current governor for the northern state of [[Nuevo León]] and holds no political party affiliation. {{as of|2015|June|7|df=US}} elected Governor for Nuevo León, making history as the first independent candidate to win in the country.

==New Zealand==
Originally, there were no recognised parties in the New Zealand parliament, although loose groupings did exist informally (initially between supporters of central government versus provincial governments, and later between liberals and conservatives). The foundation of formal political parties, starting at the end of the 19th century, considerably diminished the number of unaffiliated politicians, although a smaller number of independent candidates continued to be elected up until the 1940s. Since then, however, there have been relatively few independent politicians in Parliament. No independent candidate has won or held a seat in a general election since [[1943 New Zealand general election|1943]], although two independent candidates have been successful in [[by-election]]s (in all cases after having held the seats in question as partisan candidates up until that point). Other politicians have become independents in the course of a parliamentary term, but not been voted into office as such.

The last person to be directly elected to Parliament as an independent in New Zealand was [[Winston Peters]], who won the {{By-election link|Tauranga|1993}} in {{NZ electorate link|Tauranga}} electorate as an independent after having previously held it a member of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]. By the time of the [[1993 New Zealand general election|next general election]], he had formed his own party ([[New Zealand First]]), and thus was no longer standing as an independent. Since that time, the only independents in Parliament have been people who quit or were expelled from their original party  but retained their seats without going through a by-election. Some have gone on to found or co-found their own parties, with varying levels of success — examples include [[Peter Dunne]], [[Taito Phillip Field]], [[Gordon Copeland]], [[Tau Henare]], and [[Alamein Kopu]]. Others have joined parties which were then outside Parliament, such as [[Frank Grover]] and [[Tuariki Delamere]].

There were two independent MPs in the [[49th New Zealand Parliament]]; [[Chris Carter (politician)|Chris Carter]] and [[Hone Harawira]]. Carter became an independent after his criticisms of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]'s leadership resulted in his being expelled from the Labour caucus, while Harawira resigned from the [[Māori Party]] and, after a short period as an independent, also resigned as an MP in order to force the {{By-election link|Te Tai Tokerau|2011}} when he was re-elected as representative of his new political party, [[Mana Party (New Zealand)|Mana]] and retained the seat in the 2011 General Election. There were also two other parties which had only a single MP: [[United Future]] with [[Peter Dunne]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] with [[David Seymour (New Zealand politician)|David Seymour]]. Neither Dunne nor Seymour was classed as an independent — Dunne's presence in Parliament was due to personal votes in his home electorate, and Seymour's presence was as the sole elected MP of ACT because of a collapse in their support in the {{NZ election link|2011}}. In the [[50th New Zealand Parliament]] there was one independent MP: [[Brendan Horan]], a former New Zealand First MP who was expelled from his party because of allegations of misappropriation of family assets.

Peter Dunne effectively became an Independent MP for a short period after his United Future political party was deregistered on 25 June 2013 by the Electoral Commission, as the party no longer had the required minimum of 500 members. The party was subsequently re-registered.

==Niue==
In [[Niue]], there have been no political parties since 2003, when the [[Niue People's Party]] disbanded, and all politicians are ''de facto'' independents. The government depends on an informal coalition.

==North Korea==
Parliamentary independent candidates: The system in place whither the DPRK allows for unserious independent politicians to launch their own campaigns to gain a seat in parliament. The candidates however must be approved by the Fatherland Front, being the primary party of the DPRK. To cast votes to independent candidates the voting population must do so at independent voting stations. At the stations Korean people can debate extensively on which independent candidates would do the best for the Korean country.
Nearly all electoral systems currently in practice in the DPRK that exist on a local level are made up of mostly independent Candidates. As the Fatherland Front and other major party's primarily operate in the urban heartland of the DPRK. These independent candidates will enjoy substantial debating in front of their local populations, before a vote is made. On the local level of North Korean elections, alliances between independent candidates is banned. {{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

==Pakistan==
Pakistan also has independent politicians standing in elections. Pakistan's Parliament has [[2008 Pakistani general election|General Elections, 2008]] elected 30 Members. In the 2011 four candidates won seats in the National Assembly. In the 2013 General Election nine seats were won by independents.

==Philippines==
[[Noli de Castro]], the Philippines' former [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]], [[2001 Philippine general election|ran as senator]] in 2001 with no political party affiliation. He was a guest candidate of the opposition [[Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino|Pwersa ng Masa coalition]] but he never joined their campaign rallies. He won in the senate race with the highest votes (then) in Philippine history. In 2004, he ran [[2004 Philippine presidential election|as vice president]] as a guest candidate of the administration [[Koalisyon ng Katapatan at Karanasan sa Kinabukasan|K-4 coalition]] and won with just under majority of the vote.

Starting in 2001, several [[Senate of the Philippines|senators]] had also resigned from their respective parties to become independents; at the start of the [[15th Congress of the Philippines|15th Congress]], there were more independent senators than any other single political party. However, in contesting elections, all elected independents had been members of either the administration or the opposition coalition, until in the [[2007 Philippine Senate election|2007 Senate election]] when [[Gregorio Honasan]] (a former senator) was elected as an independent while not a being member of any coalition. Honasan was earlier [[1995 Philippine Senate election|elected in 1995]] as an independent candidate and being adopted by the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]]-led coalition to become the first elected independent senator since [[Magnolia Antonino]] in [[1967 Philippine Senate election|1967]], although Antonino was a guest candidate of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] then.

In the local level, former priest [[Eddie Panlilio]] was elected as governor of [[Pampanga]] in 2007, defeating two administration candidates. When Panlilio eventually transferred to the Liberal Party in time for the 2010 election, it was ruled that he was beaten in the 2007 election; in 2010, he was defeated.

In the [[2010 Philippine House of Representatives elections|2010 House of Representatives elections]], seven independents were elected, although all but two joined a political party after the elections.

In contesting elections, independent candidates, while can spend as much as those with parties can under the law, they aren't able to tap in spending from a political party that nominated them.

==Poland==
The Polish [[Sejm]] is elected by party-list ordination, which does not allow lone candidates to run, although since 2001 there has been a possibility to create non-partisan ''Voters' Electoral Committee'' (pol. ''KWW'', ''komitet wyborczy wyborców''); they are by almost any means party lists, but no officially registered party is behind them. They can be unregistered parties, e.g. [[Kukiz'15]], or non-partisan movements, although the latter never reached the 5% threshold. National minorities candidates also form Voters' Electoral Committees (like [[German Minority Electoral Committee]], represented in Sejm since 1991), but they do not have to reach the nationwide threshold. However, during a Sejm term many members switch parties or become independents.

Tickets such as [[Civic Platform]] during the [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|2001 election]] were formally non-partisan, Civic Platform was widely viewed as a de facto political party, as it is now.

The situation in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] is different, as the voting system allows independents to run as single candidates and some are elected in their own right. In the last parliamentary election ([[2015 Polish parliamentary election|2015]]) four independents won seats in the Senate.

Three [[President of Poland|Presidents]] since 1990 have technically been independents. [[Lech Wałęsa]] was not an endorsed candidate of any party, but the chairman of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] and he was elected without full support of this union (Solidarity votes split between him and [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]]). [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] was a leader of the [[Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland]], but formally resigned from the party after he was elected, as did [[Lech Kaczyński]], who was the first leader of [[Law and Justice]], [[Bronisław Komorowski]] ([[Civic Platform|PO]]) and [[Andrzej Duda]] ([[Law and Justice|PiS]]). The resignation is required because the Constitution says that the president shall hold no other offices nor discharge any public functions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/konse.htm#5 |title=The Constitution of the Republic of Poland |publisher=Sejm |access-date=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216093821/http://sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/konse.htm#5 |archive-date=16 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The aforementioned presidents often participated in their party's campaigns (e.g. Andrzej Duda in the Law and Justice campaign three months after his resignation from the party).

==Portugal==
[[Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa]], the current [[president of Portugal]] since 6 March 2016, was elected on 24 January 2016 while being a leading member of the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]], but suspended his [[political affiliation]] on the day of his [[Swearing in|swearing-in]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://observador.pt/2016/04/01/marcelo-rebelo-sousa-suspendeu-militancia-do-psd/|title=Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa suspendeu a militância no PSD|last=Valente|first=Liliana|date=2016-04-01|work=Observador|access-date=2019-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417025221/http://observador.pt/2016/04/01/marcelo-rebelo-sousa-suspendeu-militancia-do-psd/|archive-date=2016-04-17|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Russia==
All of Russia's [[President of Russia|Presidents]] have been independents. Former president [[Dmitry Medvedev]] declined an offer to join [[United Russia]], saying that he believes the President should be an independent so that he serves the interests of the country rather than his political party.

[[Vladimir Putin]], the current president of Russia, was the head of the [[United Russia]] party until 26 May 2012, but even then was not its member, thus formally was and still is independent.

==Sweden==
The Swedish election system is based on parties nominating candidate MPs for their party ballots, and each party has to receive 4% or more of the national vote (or 12% in one region, which has never happened). This makes running as an independent MP impossible. Once elected, the seat is personal; MPs may resign their party membership, or be stripped of it, while retaining their Riksdag seats to become independent to become what is commonly referred to as a ''politisk vilde'' (''political savage'') symbol: (-).

In the executive branch, there is no requirement for ministers to be MPs, or even have a political affiliation (though this has overwhelmingly been the case in modern times). This means that even the prime minister could technically be an independent if chosen by the Riksdag.

==Taiwan (Republic of China)==
After the [[2018 Taiwanese local elections]], there is only one independent local head:
* [[Ko Wen-je]], Mayor of [[Taipei]].
In 2019, Ko Wen-je founded the [[Taiwan People's Party]], so there is no independent local head at the moment.

==United Kingdom==

The [[Registration of Political Parties Act 1998]] laid down the first specific rules in the United Kingdom relating to the use of the term 'independent' by election candidates. That Act was repealed with most of its contents covered by Part II of the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]]. Candidates standing for United Kingdom local elections and United Kingdom parliamentary elections, including the devolved parliaments and assemblies, can use the name of a registered political party, or the term 'Independent' (or its Welsh language equivalent ''annibynol'') or no ballot paper description at all<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to standing as a candidate|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/164109/intro-candidate.pdf|publisher=Electoral Commission|access-date=10 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202014634/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/164109/intro-candidate.pdf|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Electoral Administration Bill|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmbills/050/en/06050x-c.htm|website=United Kingdom parliament|publisher=United Kingdom parliament|access-date=10 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110235148/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmbills/050/en/06050x-c.htm|archive-date=10 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> (this latter choice was used, for example, by David Icke at the [[2008 Haltemprice and Howden by-election]]).

Some groups in the United Kingdom who are not affiliated to any national or regional party have registered locality-based political parties. Some English examples are the [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern]], the [[Epsom and Ewell Residents Association]], the [[Devizes Guardians]], the [[Derwentside Independents]], and the East Yorkshire Independents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.TheEYIP.co.uk|title=History of East YorkshireLearn about East Yorkshire|access-date=19 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143709/http://www.theeyip.co.uk/|archive-date=27 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===House of Commons===
{{see also|List of UK minor party and independent MPs elected}}
Before the twentieth century it was fairly common for independents to be elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], but there have been very few since 1945. [[S. O. Davies]], a veteran [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP, held his [[Merthyr Tydfil]] seat in the General Election of 1970, standing as an independent, after he had been deselected by the Labour Party.

Journalist [[Martin Bell]] was elected at [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]] in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1997]], having stood on an anti-corruption platform, defeating incumbent [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]]. He was the first independent to be newly elected to the Commons since 1951.<ref name="GuardianMartinBell">[[Martin Bell]]'s 1997 election was the first election of an Independent in the UK since 1951: {{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2007/jun/03/martinbell | title=Martin Bell Profile | publisher=Guardian | access-date=October 18, 2012 | location=London | date=3 June 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017203222/http://www.theguardian.com/global/2007/jun/03/martinbell | archive-date=17 October 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> He stood unsuccessfully in a different constituency in 2001.

At the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 General Election]], [[Richard Taylor (UK politician)|Dr Richard Taylor]] of the [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern]] party was elected for the constituency of [[Wyre Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Wyre Forest]]. Taylor was re-elected for Wyre Forest at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 General Election]], becoming the only independent in recent times to have been elected for a second term.

Two independent (or local party) members of parliament were elected in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election]], although both were defeated five years later. In the same election, [[Peter Law]] was elected as an independent at [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent]]. Law died on 25 April 2006: the resulting [[2006 Blaenau Gwent by-elections|by-election]] elected [[Dai Davies (politician)|Dai Davies]] of the local party [[Blaenau Gwent People's Voice]]. The by-election was unusual as it was the first time in over eighty years that an independent had held a seat previously occupied by another independent.

Only one independent was elected to the Commons in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]] and [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 elections]]: [[Sylvia Hermon]], the member for [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]], a [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] who left the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] because of its links with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]].

There have also been several instances of politicians being elected to the Commons as representatives of a political party, then resigning the party's whip, or having it withdrawn. Examples in this in the 2010-2015 parliament included [[Mike Hancock (British politician)|Mike Hancock]] (formerly a Liberal Democrat), [[Eric Joyce]] (formerly Labour) and [[Nadine Dorries]], a Conservative who had the whip withdrawn for part of the parliament and thus sat as an independent during that time.

Independent candidates often stand in British parliamentary elections, often with platforms about specific local issues, but usually without  success. An example from the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] was [[Aston Villa]] supporter Ian Robinson, who stood as an independent in the [[Sutton Coldfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sutton Coldfield constituency]] in protest at the way chairman [[Doug Ellis]] ran the football club. Another example an independent candidate, in the [[Salisbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Salisbury constituency]], is [[Arthur Uther Pendragon]], a local activist and self-declared reincarnation of [[King Arthur]].

Other independent candidates are associated with a political party and may be former members of it, but cannot stand under its label. For instance, after being expelled from the Labour Party but before the [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect Coalition]] was founded, British [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[George Galloway]] described himself as "Independent Labour".

On 23 March 2005 the [[Independent Network]] was set up to support independent candidates in the General Election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentnetwork.org.uk/Launch_news_release.html|title=Launchdate of the Independent Network}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Independent Network still supports Independent candidates in local, regional, national and European elections. It has an organic{{clarify|date=May 2014}} set of principles which are known as the Bell Principles and are very closely related to [[Committee on Standards in Public Life|Lord Nolan's Standards of Public Life]]. The Independent Network does not impose any [[ideology]] or political influence on their candidates.

In March 2009, the multi-millionaire [[Paul Judge]] established the [[Jury Team]], an umbrella organisation dedicated to increasing the number of independent candidates standing in Britain, in both national and European elections.<ref name=Independant8Mar09>{{cite news | last = Gourlay | first = Chris | title = Tycoon finances 'X Factor' party to clean up politics | publisher = [[The Sunday Times]] | date = 2009-03-08 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5864530.ece | access-date = 2009-05-10 | location = London | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090316004542/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5864530.ece | archive-date = 2009-03-16 | url-status = live }}</ref>

====Independent and undescribed candidates====

Part II of the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]] allows individuals who wish to stand as a candidate to all parliaments and assemblies in the UK, including the House of Commons, the right to use one of three ballot paper descriptions. Those descriptions are the name of a registered political party; the word "independent" or the Welsh equivalent; or no description at all, leaving the ballot paper description box blank.<ref>{{cite web|title=Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 - Part II "Registration of Political Parties"|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/part/II|website=Lesiglation.gov|access-date=22 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523011659/https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/part/II|archive-date=23 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Unless a candidate stands as "independent" or as a "No Description" candidate leaving the ballot paper description box blank, their candidature must be confirmed by a signed certificate from the relevant officer from a registered political party, as set out in Section 52 of the [[Electoral Administration Act 2006]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Electoral Administration Act 2006 - Explanatory Notes|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/22/notes/division/9/7/1?view=plain|website=Legislation.gov|access-date=22 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523082806/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/22/notes/division/9/7/1?view=plain|archive-date=23 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===House of Lords===
{{main|Crossbencher|Non-affiliated members of the House of Lords|Lords Spiritual}}
The [[House of Lords]] includes many peers independent from political parties. Some are simply [[Non-affiliated members of the House of Lords|not affiliated]] with any grouping, whilst another, larger, grouping is given the official designation of [[Crossbench#United Kingdom|crossbenchers]]. Additionally the [[Lords Spiritual]] (bishops of the [[Church of England]]) do not have party affiliations.

===Scottish Parliament, Welsh Parliament and Northern Irish Assembly===
In the [[2003 Scottish Parliament election|2003 Scottish Parliamentary elections]], three [[Members of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] were elected as Independents: [[Dennis Canavan]] ([[Falkirk West (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Falkirk West]]), [[Jean Turner|Dr Jean Turner]] ([[Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Strathkelvin and Bearsden]]) and [[Margo MacDonald]] ([[Lothians (Scottish Parliament region)|Lothians]]). In 2004 [[Campbell Martin]] ([[West of Scotland (Scottish Parliament region)|West of Scotland region]]) left the [[Scottish National Party]] to become an independent and in 2005 [[Brian Monteith]] ([[Mid Scotland and Fife (Scottish Parliament region)|Mid Scotland and Fife]]) left the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] to become an independent. At the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 Scottish Parliamentary elections]] Margo MacDonald was again returned as an independent MSP and was elected as an independent for the third time [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|four years later]]. She died in 2014 while still serving as member of the Parliament. As she was elected as an independent regional MSP, there could be no by-election and her seat remained vacant until the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election|2016 election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26883278|title=Independent MSP Margo MacDonald dies|publisher=bbc.co.uk|date=4 April 2014|access-date=4 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406023045/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26883278|archive-date=6 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Peter Law]] was expelled from the Labour Party after standing against an official Labour candidate in [[Blaenau Gwent]] at the 2005 UK general election and became an independent in the National Assembly and UK Parliament. In 2006 Peter Law died from a [[brain tumour]] and his wife, [[Trish Law]] campaigned and took the seat as an independent candidate at the sequent by-election and held onto the seat again in the [[2007 National Assembly for Wales election|2007 Welsh Assembly elections]].

In 2016, [[Nathan Gill]] as the then leader of UKIP Wales defected from the group to sit as an independent after a falling out with [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] who was elected UKIP Assembly group leader. [[Dafydd Elis-Thomas]] left the [[Plaid Cymru]] group later in 2016 after multiple fallings out with Plaid Cymru leader [[Leanne Wood]]. Elis-Thomas said his reason for leaving Plaid Cymru was that it not serious about working with the [[Welsh Labour]] Government.

===Local elections===
The introduction of [[Directly elected mayors in England and Wales|directly elected mayors]] in several parts of England has witnessed the election of independents to run councils in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Middlesbrough (borough)|Middlesbrough]], [[Borough of Bedford|Bedford]], [[Hartlepool (borough)|Hartlepool]] and [[Mansfield (district)|Mansfield]]. The first [[Mayor of London]], [[Ken Livingstone]], was [[2000 London mayoral election|first elected]] as an independent, having run against the official Labour candidate [[Frank Dobson]]. He was subsequently re-admitted to the Labour Party in December 2003 before his first re-election campaign.

Independent candidates frequently stand and are elected to local councils. There is a special Independent group of the [[Local Government Association]] to cater for them. A number of local authorities have been entirely or almost entirely composed of independent members, such as the [[City of London Corporation]], the [[2009 Council of the Isles of Scilly election|Isles of Scilly Council]], [[Orkney Islands Council]], [[Shetland Islands Council]] and [[Comhairle nan Eilean Siar]] (Western Isles Council) in the [[Outer Hebrides]].

Roughly a quarter of the [[police and crime commissioner]]s elected in England and Wales in the [[2012 England and Wales police and crime commissioner elections|2012 election]] were independents.<ref name=PCCs_uk>{{cite news|title=Q&A: Police and crime commissioners|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19504639|access-date=27 November 2014|work=BBC News|date=12 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015112020/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19504639|archive-date=15 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

==United States==
{{see also|Third party officeholders in the United States}}

===President===
[[George Washington]] is the only [[President of the United States|President]] elected as an independent to date. President Washington opposed the development of [[Political parties in the United States|political parties]], which had begun to solidify as the [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] faction centered around Vice President [[John Adams]] and [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] and the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] faction centered around [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]].

[[John Tyler]] was expelled from the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in September 1841, and effectively remained an independent for the remainder of his presidency. He later returned to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and briefly sought re-election in [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]] as a [[National Democratic Party (United States)|National Democrat]], but withdrew over fear he would split the Democratic vote.

Since 1900, notable candidates running as independents for U.S. president have included [[Rockefeller Republican|liberal Republican]] congressman [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] in [[1980 U.S. presidential election|1980]], billionaire entrepreneur [[Ross Perot]] in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[United States third party and independent presidential candidates, 1996|1996]], former [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Ralph Nader]] in the [[United States third party and independent presidential candidates, 1996|1996]] and [[United States third party and independent presidential candidates, 2000|2000]] elections, and [[Never Trump movement|"Never Trump"]] conservative candidate [[Evan McMullin]] in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]. Out of all independent candidates since Washington, Perot received the best performance, gaining no votes in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] but receiving 19 percent of the popular vote and at earlier points in the election season leading in polls against his opponents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W.

In 2008, Nader formed Independent Parties in [[New Mexico]], [[Delaware]], and elsewhere to gain ballot access in several states. This strategy has been pursued by several other candidates for federal races, including [[Joe Lieberman]] ([[Connecticut for Lieberman]]).

===Governor===
[[Illinois]], [[Maine]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Texas]], [[Alaska]] and [[Minnesota]] have elected formally independent candidates as governor: Illinois's first two governors, [[Shadrach Bond]] and [[Edward Coles]]; [[James B. Longley]] in 1974 as well as [[Angus King]] in 1994 and 1998 from Maine; [[Lincoln Chafee]] in 2010 from Rhode Island; [[Julius Meier]] in 1930 from Oregon; [[Sam Houston]] in 1859 from Texas; and [[Bill Walker (American politician)|Bill Walker]] in 2014 from Alaska. [[Lowell P. Weicker Jr.]] is sometimes mentioned as an independent governor, though this is not technically correct; he ran as an [[A Connecticut Party]] candidate (which gave him better ballot placement than an unaffiliated candidate would receive), defeating the Democratic and Republican party nominees.  Another former governor who is sometimes mentioned as an independent is [[Jesse Ventura]], who actually ran as a member of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party's]] Minnesota affiliate, which later disaffiliated from the party and reverted to their original name the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]].

In 1971, State Senator [[Henry Howell]] of [[Virginia]], a former Democrat, was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|lieutenant governor]] as an independent. Two years later, he campaigned for [[Governor of Virginia|governor]] as an independent, but lost by 15,000 votes.

There were several unsuccessful independent gubernatorial candidates in 2006 who impacted their electoral races. In [[Maine]], state legislator [[Barbara Merrill]] (formerly a Democrat) received 21% of the vote. In [[Texas]], [[country music]] singer and [[detective fiction|mystery novelist]] [[Kinky Friedman]] received 12.43% of the vote, and State [[Comptroller]] [[Carole Keeton Strayhorn]] received 18.13%. Strayhorn and Friedman's presence in the race resulted in a splitting of the ballot four ways between themselves and the two major parties.

In 2010, [[Florida]] [[Governor of Florida|governor]] [[Charlie Crist]] left the Republican party and became Independent (He later became a Democrat.)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/27/charlie-crist-senate-race_n_774589.html|work=Huffington Post|title=Charlie Crist Comes Under Fire For Pulling Party Switch|date=27 October 2010|access-date=26 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305231220/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/27/charlie-crist-senate-race_n_774589.html|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> rather than face former [[Florida House of Representatives|state house]] [[Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Marco Rubio]] in the Republican primary for Senate (Rubio won, though Crist came in ahead of Democratic nominee [[Kendrick Meek]]).

In 2014, former [[Honolulu]] mayor [[Mufi Hannemann]] ran as an independent candidate for the [[Governor of Hawaii|governorship]] of the State of [[Hawaii]] after previously campaigning in the state's Democratic primary. As a result, Democratic candidate [[David Ige]] was elected as governor with a plurality of 49%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kitv.com/politics/ige-takes-early-lead-in-hawaii-governors-race/29545058|title=Democrat David Ige elected Hawaii governor|date=4 November 2014|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105212441/http://www.kitv.com/politics/ige-takes-early-lead-in-hawaii-governors-race/29545058|archive-date=5 November 2014}}</ref>

===Congress – House of Representatives and Senate===
There have been several independents elected to the [[United States Senate]] throughout history. Notable examples include [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]] of [[Illinois]] (a former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) in the 19th century, and [[Harry F. Byrd Jr.]] of [[Virginia]] (who had been elected to his first term as a Democrat) in the 20th century.  Some officials have been elected as members of a party but became independent while in office (without being elected as such), such as [[Wayne Morse]] of [[Oregon]]. [[Nebraska]] senator [[George W. Norris]] was elected for four terms as a Republican before changing to an independent after the Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 1930. Norris won re-election as an independent in 1936, but later lost his final re-election attempt to Republican [[Kenneth S. Wherry]] in 1942. [[Vermont]] senator [[Jim Jeffords]] left the Republican Party to become an independent in 2001. Jeffords's [[party switching|change of party status]] was especially significant because it shifted the Senate composition from 50 to 50 between the Republicans and Democrats (with a Republican [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[Dick Cheney]], who would presumably break all ties in favor of the Republicans), to 49 Republicans, 50 Democrats, and one Independent. Jeffords agreed to vote for Democratic control of the Senate in exchange for being appointed chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment and Public Works Committee]], and the Democrats held control of the Senate until the [[2002 U.S. Senate election|Congressional elections in 2002]], when the Republicans regained their majority. Jeffords retired at the end of his term in 2007. Wayne Morse after two years as an independent became a Democrat. [[Dean Barkley]] of the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]] was appointed a day before the 2002 elections to fill the senate seat of [[Paul Wellstone]] who, while running for re-election, died weeks prior. Barkley refused to caucus with either party.

Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] is the longest-serving independent member of Congress in American history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/bernie-sanders-president-democrat-145640890.html |title=Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders says he may run for president as a Democrat |publisher=Yahoo! News |date=2014-09-14 |access-date=2014-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017230810/http://news.yahoo.com/bernie-sanders-president-democrat-145640890.html |archive-date=2014-10-17 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was an independent member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] for [[United States House of Representatives, Vermont At Large|Vermont-at-large]] from 1991 to 2007. Sanders later won the open Senate seat of [[Jim Jeffords]] as an independent. [[Joe Lieberman]] is a former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who, like [[Lowell P. Weicker Jr.]], ran under a third party ([[Connecticut for Lieberman|Connecticut for Lieberman Party]]) in the [[2006 United States Senate election in Connecticut|2006 election]]. Though both representatives are technically independent politicians, they often caucus with the Democrats. In 2006, Sanders and Lieberman were the only two victorious independent candidates for Congress, both caucusing with the Democrats. In 2012 [[Angus King]] was elected to the US Senate as an Independent from Maine. {{as of|2016}}, he has typically caucused with the Democrats.

The [[United States House of Representatives]] has also seen a handful of [[Third-party members of the United States House of Representatives|independent members]]. Examples include [[Bernie Sanders]] of [[Vermont]], [[Virgil Goode]] of [[Virginia]], [[Frazier Reams]] of [[Ohio]], [[Victor Berger]] of [[Wisconsin]], and [[Justin Amash]] of [[Michigan]].

===State and local offices===
In August 2008, there were 12 independents who held offices in state legislatures. There were four state senators, one from [[Kentucky Senate|Kentucky]], one from [[Oregon Senate|Oregon]], one from [[Tennessee Senate|Tennessee]], and one from [[New Mexico Senate|New Mexico]]. The representatives came from the states of [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana]] (two), [[Maine House of Representatives|Maine]] (two), [[Vermont House of Representatives|Vermont]] (two), and [[Virginia House of Delegates|Virginia]] (two). In the 2008 general elections, Wisconsin State Assemblyman Jeffrey Wood left the Republican Party and won reelection as an independent. After the 2008 primary election, New Mexico State Senator [[Joseph Carraro]] left the Republican Party and registered as an Independent. He did not run for reelection.

In November 2005, [[Manny Diaz (Florida politician)|Manny Diaz]] was elected Mayor of [[Miami, Florida]] as an independent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/mayors/miami_mayor.html |title=Manny Diaz - Mayor of Miami |publisher=City Mayors |date=2008-01-28 |access-date=2010-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104053525/http://citymayors.com/mayors/miami_mayor.html |archive-date=2010-11-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> On June 19, 2007, [[Mayor of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Michael Bloomberg]] switched his party affiliation from Republican to independent. [[Oscar Goodman]], Mayor of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] switched his affiliation to Independent from Democrat in December 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kxnt.com/Mayor-Goodman-Switches-Party-Affiliation/5902291|title=Goodman Switches Party Affiliation. KXNT, Ret. December 16th 2009}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Dan Hollingsworth has won four consecutive elections as an Independent since 1998 for mayor of the small city of [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]], [[Louisiana]], the home of [[Louisiana Tech University]]. In 2017, Maine State Representative Ralph Chapman, a Democrat, changed his registration to Maine Green Independent Party, which is the Maine chapter of the Green Party of the United States, giving the Green Party a seat in Maine's State Legislature.

The [[Nebraska Legislature]] is unique in that it is the only non-partisan state legislature. In the Legislature (which is additionally unique in that it is also the only state legislature that is [[unicameral]]), there are no formal party alignments or groups and the members are nominated in nonpartisan primary elections. Members are allowed to register with political parties but choose not to reveal their affiliation while seated, as a professional courtesy. However, the political affiliation of party-affiliated members are considered [[open secret]]s and the parties exist in the legislature on an unofficial basis. Some members, such as [[Ernie Chambers]] of [[Omaha]], are independent of party officially, while others have not publicly disclosed their affiliation.
