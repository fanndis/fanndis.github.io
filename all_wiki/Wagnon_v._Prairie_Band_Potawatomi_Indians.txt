'''''Wagnon v. Prairie Band Potawatomi Indians''''', 546 U.S. 95 (2005), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that a state's non-discriminatory fuel tax imposed on off-reservation distributors does not pose an affront to a tribe's sovereignty.<ref name=SCOTUS>''Wagnon v. Prairie Band Potawatomi Indians'', {{ussc|546|95|2005}}.</ref>

==Background==
The [[Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation|Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation]] is a federally recognized Indian (Native American) tribe with a reservation in [[Jackson County, Kansas|Jackson County]], [[Kansas]].  The tribe operates a gas station on the reservation, buying the fuel from off-reservation distributors.  Under Kansas law, the distributors pay state tax on receipt of the fuel and pass on the costs to their customers, including the tribe.  As a federally recognized tribe, a state may not directly tax the tribe absent the authorization of [[United States Congress|Congress]].<ref name=Spellmeier>Spellmeier, Luke R. (2004), A Winning Hand or Time to Fold? State Taxation of Fuel Sales on Kansas Indian Reservations, 43 Washburn Law J. 141</ref><ref name=Schraver>[[David M. Schraver|Schraver, David M.]] and Tennant, David H. (2012), Indian Tribal Sovereignty - Current Issues, 75 Albany Law R. 133</ref>

A previous Supreme Court case had struck down a state fuel tax imposed on gas sold by the [[Chickasaw Nation]] in 1995.<ref name=Chickasaw>''Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Chickasaw Nation'', {{ussc|515|450|1995}}</ref>  Kansas had, subsequent to the ''Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Chickasaw Nation'', {{ussc|515|450|1995}} decision, imposed the tax on the non-Indian distributors of fuel and not on the tribe as the retail seller.  The Potawatomi tribe viewed this as an attack on their tribal sovereignty and filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Kansas]].<ref name=Spellmeier /><ref name=District>{{cite court |litigants=Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation v. Richards |vol=241 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=1295 |pinpoint= |court=D.

The District Court upheld the state tax, and the tribe appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals]].  The appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court, ruling that the state's tax infringed on the tribe's right of self-government.  Kansas appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted [[certiorari]] to hear the case.<ref name=SCOTUS /><ref name=Spellmeier /><ref name=Circuit>{{cite court |litigants=Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation v. Richards |vol=379 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=979 |pinpoint= |court=10th Cir. |date=2004 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/379/979/475128/ |accessdate=2018-03-20 |quote=}}</ref><ref name=Kieval>Kieval, Shira (2009), Discerning Discrimination in State Treatment of American Indians Going Beyond Reservation Boundaries, 109 Columbia Law R. 94</ref>

==Opinion of the Court==

Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] delivered the opinion of the court.  Justice Thomas reasoned that the taxation took place off-reservation and was neither discriminatory nor an affront to tribal sovereignty.  Accordingly, the court reversed the decision of the Tenth Circuit and ruled that the tax was valid.<ref name=SCOTUS /><ref name=Spellmeier /><ref name=Kieval />
