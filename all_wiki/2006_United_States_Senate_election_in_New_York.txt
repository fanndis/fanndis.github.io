The '''2006 United States Senate election in New York''' was held on November 7, 2006. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] won re-election to a second term in office, by a more than two-to-one margin. Clinton was challenged by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[John Spencer (mayor)|John Spencer]], former [[Mayor]] of [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], and longtime political activist [[Howie Hawkins]] of the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]].

== Democratic nomination ==
=== Campaign ===
Hillary Clinton announced in November 2004 that she would seek a second term in the Senate, and began fundraising and campaigning.  Clinton faced opposition for the Democratic party nomination from the anti-war base of her own party, that had become increasingly frustrated with her support for the [[Iraq War]].

On October 12, 2005 [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz]] firefighter and activist [[Steven Greenfield]], a former [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] leader, announced he would run as a Democrat.  On December 6, 2005, labor advocate [[Jonathan Tasini]] announced that he would run as well,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nysun.com/article/24079 | title=Tasini Launches Bid To Defeat Clinton - December 7, 2005 - The New York Sun | publisher=Nysun.com | date=December 7, 2005 | accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref> running as an antiwar candidate, calling for immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq, [[universal health care]], expansion in [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] benefits, the creation of Universal Voluntary Accounts for pensions, and what he termed "New Rules For the Economy", a more labor-centric as opposed to the corporate-centric approach to economic matters espoused by Clinton. Tasini was president of [[Economic Future Group]] and former president of the National Writers Union.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051206030659/http://www.tasinifornewyork.org/ Jonathan Tasini for New York] Primary campaign site.</ref>  Tasini was supported by anti-war activist [[Cindy Sheehan]], who had in October said of Clinton, "I will resist her candidacy with every bit of my power and strength...I will not make the mistake of supporting another pro-war Democrat for president again."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.madison.com/tct/opinion/index.php?ntid=64347&ntpid=10 | title=Opinion | publisher=Madison.com | accessdate=December 14, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919050905/http://www.madison.com/tct/opinion/index.php?ntid=64347&ntpid=10 | archive-date=September 19, 2008 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On March 31, 2006, businessman [[Mark Greenstein]] announced his run for the seat.  Greenstein, endorsed by the New Democrats,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newdems2008.org | title=家具の運送は引っ越し業者にお任せ | publisher=Newdems2008.org | accessdate=July 18, 2016}}</ref> presented himself as a non-liberal Democrat who was campaigning to "bring the far left back to reality that Big Government is the source of most ongoing problems Democrat constituents face." He contended that Clinton was "too liberal" in her support for regulations, "too wishy-washy" on the Iraq war and on gay rights, and had lost integrity by using the Dubai Ports issue for political purposes.  Greenstein challenged Clinton to sign a pledge that she would serve out her full 6 year Senate term if re-elected.<ref>[http://www.greensteinforsenate.com/pledge.html ] {{webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101538/http://www.greensteinforsenate.com/pledge.html | date=September 28, 2007}}</ref>  However, in May 2006, Greenfield endorsed Tasini and essentially dropped out of the race.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thevillager.com/villager_157/attorneygeneralcontender.html | title=Attorney general contender says to give peace candidate a chance | publisher=Thevillager.com | accessdate=December 14, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612083053/http://www.thevillager.com/villager_157/attorneygeneralcontender.html | archive-date=June 12, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

On June 1, 2006, Clinton accepted the unanimous endorsement of the New York State Democratic Party's convention in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/state/ny-sthill0601,0,5553309.story | title=Regional & NY State News on | publisher=Newsday.com | date=December 1, 2010 | accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref>  Eight days later, Greenstein dropped out of the race.<ref>{{cite web | author=PaulKB | url=http://blogs.timesunion.com/capitol/?p=1390 | title=Senate Race Dropout - Capitol Confidential | publisher=Blogs.timesunion.com | date=June 9, 2006 | accessdate=December 14, 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013161254/http://blogs.timesunion.com/capitol/?p=1390 | archivedate=October 13, 2007 }}</ref>  Tasini pressed on, submitting 40,000 signatures to the State Election Commission on July 14, far more than the 15,000 needed to force a primary. Clinton's campaign said that she would not challenge the signatures.

== Republican nomination ==
=== Campaign ===
New York Republicans originally had high hopes of mounting a serious challenge to Clinton, and derailing her expected future presidential bid.<ref name="nbc090506"/>  However, Clinton was politically strong in the state and no major Republican entered the race, with Governor [[George Pataki]] and [[United States Senate election in New York, 2000|early 2000 senate opponent]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] both declining to run.<ref name="nbc090506"/>  The two most prominent Republicans contemplating a challenge to Clinton were [[lawyer]] [[Edward F. Cox|Ed Cox]] (the son-in-law of former President [[Richard M. Nixon]]) and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] [[District Attorney]] [[Jeanine Pirro]].

Pirro was considered the front-runner, but her campaign had immediate difficulties.  During her August 10, 2005 live televised candidacy announcement in New York City, she paused for more than thirty seconds looking for a missing part of her speech, then asked, on the air, "Do I have page 10?"<ref name="nbc090506">{{cite news | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14627661 | title=GOP unable to stop Hillary in 2006 | author=Murray, Mark | publisher=[[NBC News]] | date=September 5, 2006}}</ref><ref name="nyt122205"/>  Democrats re-aired the sequence as part of a [[Jeopardy theme|''Jeopardy!'' theme]] parody.<ref name="nbc090506"/>  The [[Conservative Party of New York]] was also reluctant to embrace Pirro.<ref name="nyt122205">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/22/nyregion/22pirro.html | title=Pirro Quits Senate Race to Run for Attorney General | author=Raymond Hernandez and Patrick J. Healy | publisher=The New York Times | date=December 22, 2005 | accessdate=November 11, 2008}}</ref>  On August 18, 2005, another Republican candidate, former Mayor of [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] [[John Spencer (mayor)|John Spencer]], gave a radio interview in which he attacked Pirro, calling her chances of winning the [[Conservative Party of New York State]] nomination "a Chinaman's chance." Spencer later apologized.<ref>[http://wcbs880.com/topstories/local_story_231113708.html ]{{dead link | date=December 2010}}</ref>

On October 14, 2005, Governor Pataki endorsed Pirro. Later that day, Cox withdrew from the race; his campaign had raised only $114,249 in contributions in the prior three months.<ref>[http://timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=408983&category=REGIONOTHER&BCCode=HOME&newsdate=10/14/2005 ]  {{webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218223718/http://timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=408983&category=REGIONOTHER&BCCode=HOME&newsdate=10%2F14%2F2005 | date=December 18, 2005}}</ref>
On October 18, 2005, remarks by Pirro that appeared to suggest that Democrats were indifferent to child molesters and murderers drew sharp criticism from the Clinton campaign and others.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/20/nyregion/metrocampaigns/20pirro.html | work=The New York Times | title=Pirro's Jab at the Assembly Infuriates State Democrats | first=Raymond | last=Hernandez | date=October 20, 2005 | accessdate=May 27, 2010}}</ref>

Pirro trailed Clinton badly in fund-raising and in polls; her campaign had failed to gain traction.<ref name="nyt122205"/>  Under pressure from state party officials, she dropped out of the race on December 21, 2005, to run for [[New York State Attorney General]] instead, leaving the Republicans without a well-known candidate.<ref name="nyt122205"/><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/21/ny.pirro/index.html | title = Sen. Clinton's GOP challenger quits race | publisher = CNN | date = December 21, 2005 | first = Phil | last = Hirschkorn | accessdate = August 22, 2006}}</ref>  The announcement was timed to coincide with the [[2005 New York City transit strike]], so as to draw minimal attention to the Republicans' difficulties.<ref name="nyt122205"/>  Pirro did not mention her campaign woes, but instead said, "I have concluded that my head and my heart remain in law enforcement, and that my public service should continue to be in that arena."<ref name="nyt122205"/>

Declared Republican nominees now included Spencer and [[Kathleen Troia McFarland|K. T. McFarland]], who was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs under President [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.politics1.com/ny.htm | title=Online Guide to New York Politics | publisher=Politics1 | accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref> Cox considered reentering the race but did not.  Politically, Spencer was generally opposed to abortion, against gun control, and a supporter of tighter border security.<ref name=Issues>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051027212328/http://www.joinspencer.com/site/c.euLPK3MNItG/b.1009951/k.C792/Issues/apps/nl/newsletter2.asp Issues - Spencer for Senate]. Retrieved April 17, 2006.</ref>  He supported the [[George W. Bush administration]] and its policies, including the [[war in Iraq]].  Spencer came out in favor of New York's Court of Appeals denying same-sex marriage to 42 gay and lesbian couples who challenged that denial as unconstitutional. Spencer said that marriage equality for same-sex couples equated to "special rights for gays."  Spencer was endorsed by Republican officials such as Congressman [[Vito Fossella]].  In contrast, McFarland was [[pro-choice]].<ref name="nbc090506"/>  However, McFarland ran into trouble with a March comment that appeared to allege that the Clinton campaign had been flying helicopters low over her [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]] house and spying on her; she later said she had been joking, but the episode upset her.<ref name="nbc090506"/>  In May, McFarland's campaign manager [[Ed Rollins]] made personal life charges against Spencer, to which the latter responded, "Shame on you."<ref name="nbc090506"/>

On May 31, 2006, Spencer won the endorsement of the state Republican Party organization but did not achieve the threshold of 75 percent he needed to prevent McFarland from gaining an automatic position on the primary ballot.  He received 63 percent and would thus have to face McFarland in the September 12 Republican primary.  Spencer called on McFarland to step aside after the vote, but McFarland said she would not.<ref>{{cite news | first=Marie | last=Horrigan | title=NY Senate: Spencer Wins GOP Nod, But Still Faces Primary | date=May 31, 2006 | publisher=[[Congressional Quarterly]] | url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/2006/05/ny_senate_spencer_wins_gop_nod.html | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829102819/http://www.cqpolitics.com/2006/05/ny_senate_spencer_wins_gop_nod.html | archivedate=August 29, 2006}}</ref>  In a June 2006 radio ad, Spencer attacked national Republicans for not funding his campaign.

== Third party nominations ==
=== Green ===
Howie Hawkins was the [[Green Party of New York|Green Party]]'s candidate for the United States Senate in the state of New York.

His signature campaign issue was the [[Iraq War]]. Specifically, Hawkins criticized Senator Clinton's endorsement of the Iraq war resolution, and continued support for an American troop presence in Iraq.

Hawkins pledged to implement what he described as a modern-day version of the [[McGovern–Hatfield Amendment|Hatfield–Kennedy Amendment]] (a proposed Senate resolution intended to cut off funding for the [[Vietnam War]]) which would defund military operations for the U.S. Armed Forces unless and until they were redeployed out of theater, and possibly replaced by an international peacekeeping force.

He called upon supporters of Tasini to vote for him in the general election.

=== Libertarian ===
[[Jeff Russell (Libertarian)|Jeff Russell]] was nominated as the official [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] candidate for United States Senate at the [[Libertarian Party of New York]] Convention on April 29, 2006, in [[Albany, New York|Albany]].

=== Results ===
The election was not close, with Clinton winning 58 of [[New York (state)|New York]]'s 62 counties. Clinton had a surprisingly strong performance in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] which tends to be tossup. When Clinton's upstate margins combined with her huge numbers out of [[New York City]], there was no coming back for the Republicans. Clinton was sworn in for what would be her last term in the senate serving from January 3, 2007 to January 21, 2009 when she assumed the office of [[United States Secretary of State]].

=== Analysis ===
[[File:NYSen06Counties.png|thumb|Election results by county.]]
Clinton's victory margin over her Republican opponent (67%&ndash;31%) was a significant gain over her showing in the 2000 senate race against [[Rick Lazio]] (55%&ndash;43%).  She carried all but four of New York's sixty-two counties.<ref>{{cite news | work=Newsweek | url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/44273 | title=Is America Ready? | date=December 25, 2006 | accessdate=September 27, 2007}}</ref>

It was the second-largest margin of victory for a Senate race in New York history,{{Citation needed | date=November 2008}} and the third-largest for a statewide race in New York.{{Citation needed | date=November 2008}} Clinton's 2006 margin did not quite equal the percentage received by [[Eliot Spitzer]] in the concurrent gubernatorial race (69%%&ndash;29%) nor by [[Charles Schumer]] in his 2004 Senate re-election campaign (71%%&ndash;24%), both of which had also been against little-known Republican opponents.

== Legacy ==
Jeanine Pirro would go on to get the Republican nomination for [[New York State Attorney General]], but lost in the [[New York attorney general election, 2006|2006 attorney general election]] to Democrat [[Andrew Cuomo]].<ref>[http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2006/general/2006_ag.pdf New York State Board of Elections: Attorney General] {{webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105210648/http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2006/general/2006_ag.pdf | date=November 5, 2013}}</ref>

Clinton was criticized by some Democrats for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008.<ref>{{cite news | author=Kornblut, Anne E. |author2=Zeleny, Jeff  | work=The New York Times | title=Clinton Won Easily, but Bankroll Shows the Toll | date=November 21, 2006}} page A1.</ref> In the following months she transferred $10&nbsp;million of her Senate funds toward [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|her 2008 presidential campaign]].<ref name="cnn040107">{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/04/01/clinton.money/index.html | title=Record millions roll in for Clinton White House bid | date=April 1, 2007 | publisher=CNN | accessdate=April 2, 2007}}</ref>

Following her Attorney General loss, Pirro left electoral politics and became a television judge and political commentator. Spencer left politics altogether. Tasani [[united States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2010|ran for a House seat in 2010]] but was not competitive. Clinton fell short in her 2008 presidential nomination bid, served as [[U.S. Secretary of State]] for four years, and then ran again in the [[2016 United States presidential election]] but suffered a general election loss. The candidate from this 2006 senate campaign whose officeholding instanced furthest into the future turned out to be McFarland, who in 2017 became [[Deputy National Security Advisor (United States)|U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor]].
