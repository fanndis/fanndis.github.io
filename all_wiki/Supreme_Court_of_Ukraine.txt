{{Politics of Ukraine}}
The '''Supreme Court of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Верховний Суд України}}, {{lang|uk-latn|Verkhovny Sud Ukrayiny}}) is the highest judicial body in the system of courts of general jurisdiction in [[Ukraine]].<ref name=SCU31717>[https://www.unian.info/politics/2057401-us-embassy-integrity-concerns-of-ukraine-supreme-court-nominees-remain.html U.S. Embassy: Integrity concerns of Ukraine Supreme Court nominees remain], [[UNIAN]] (31 July 2017)</ref>

The Court derives its authority from the [[Constitution of Ukraine]], but much of its structure is outlined in legislation. More detailed description of the Court's functions and authority may be found in the Law of Ukraine "On the Judiciary and the Status of Judges".

==Structure==
The Court consists of several judicial chambers (on criminal, civil, administrative, and arbitration (commercial) cases and the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Court).<ref name=SCU31717/> According to a judicial reform the Court consists of 48 justices.

Appointments to the Court are made after selected in a competition candidates are vetted by the [[Supreme Council of Justice]], who then draw up a final list of candidates for the  Supreme Court.<ref name=SCU31717/> After a relevant [[President of Ukraine|presidential]] decree, these candidates will become judges of the Supreme Court.<ref name=SCU31717/> Each member of the Court (as far as each [[judge]] in Ukraine) is obligated to retire at the age of 65.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The Chairman of the Supreme Court is elected to office and dismissed from office by the Plenary Assembly of the Court by secret ballot.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/119530 Petro Pylypchuk elected head of Supreme Court of Ukraine], [[Kyiv Post]] (23 December 2011)</ref>

In July 2010 functions of the Court was severely limited.<ref name=PBJF29512>[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=39430 Ukraine’s Opposition Program Requires Another Revolution], [[The Jamestown Foundation]] (29 May 2012)</ref> But in November 2011 the functions of Supreme Court were broadened; its number of judges became 48.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/116778/ Yanukovych signs law that broaden functions of Supreme Court], [[Kyiv Post]] (11 November 2011)</ref>

==History==
The first Supreme Court of Ukraine was established on December 15, 1917 as the General Court of the Ukrainian People's Republic. It was the first established national court since liquidation of Hetmanate in the 18th century. Soon after that on January 17, 1918 the Communist government of Ukraine [[People's Secretariat]] declared about creation of the People's Court of Ukraine.

The General Court consisted of 15 judges that were elected by the [[Central Council of Ukraine]] on proposition of the [[General Secretariat of Ukraine]]. The competence of the elected judges was extended until the adoption of the Constitution of Ukraine by the All-[[Ukrainian Constituent Assembly]]. Office of Prosecutor was established within the General Court and headed by the Senior Prosecutor who was appointed by the Secretary of Court Affairs (Minister of Justice).

The first judges to the court were elected on January 15, 1918 among which were M. Pukhtynsky, P. Achkasov, O. Butovsky, F. Popov, M. Radchenko, O. Khrutsky, [[Serhiy Shelukhin|S. Shelukhin]], and H. Shyianov and later were joined by P. Yatsenko, [[Mykola Vasylenko|M. Vasylenko]], [[Kostyantyn Tovkach|K. Tovkach]], [[Arnold D. Margolin|A. Margolin]], M. Cherniavsky, [[Bohdan Kistiakivsky|B. Kistiakivsky]], [[Ihor Kistiakivsky|I. Kistiakivsky]]. The Senior Prosecutor was appointed [[Dmytro Markovych]].

On July 8, 1918, the [[Hetman of Ukraine]] completely changed the upper echelon of judicial jurisdiction in the country.

The court in the Soviet Ukraine was established on March 11, 1923. It moved into the 18th-century [[Klov Palace]] in 2003.

According to a 2009 poll, the overall trust in the Court in Ukraine is very low.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/56034/ Poll: Citizens have low level of confidence in CEC and Supreme Administrative Court], [[Kyiv Post]] (December 28, 2009)</ref>

In the judicial reform introduced in 2016 the following three courts were abolished and its tasks transferred to special chambers of the Supreme Court of Ukraine.<ref>[http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=212fa5f8-4f4b-4b4d-9d5a-693579e0c95e Amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine passed: Ukraine takes a major step towards a European System of Justice], [[Lexology]] (9 June 2016)<br/>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/394662.html Poroshenko signs law on High Council of Justice], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (3 January 2017)<br/>[https://www.unian.info/m/society/2300259-new-editions-of-three-codes-put-into-force-new-supreme-court-launches-work-in-ukraine.html New Supreme Court launches work in Ukraine, 3 new codes put into force], [[UNIAN]] (15 December 2017)</ref>
