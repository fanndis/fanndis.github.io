The '''Association of Chief Police Officers of England, Wales and Northern Ireland''' ('''ACPO''') was a [[not-for-profit]] private limited company that for many years led the development of policing practices in [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]].<ref name="gardham"/> Established in 1948,<ref name="steele">{{cite news

| location=London}}</ref> ACPO provided a forum for chief police officers to share ideas and coordinate their strategic operational responses, and advised government in matters such as [[Terrorism in the UK|terrorist attacks]] and civil emergencies. ACPO coordinated national police operations, major investigations, cross-border policing, and joint law enforcement. ACPO designated Senior Investigative Officers for major investigations and appointed officers to head ACPO units specialising in various areas of policing and crime reduction.

ACPO was led by Chief Constable [[Sir Hugh Orde]], [[Queen's Police Medal|QPM]], who was, until 2009, the Chief Constable of the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]].  He was elected as president by fellow members of ACPO in April 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psni.police.uk/16-04-09_chief_constable_acpo_announcement |title=Sir Hugh Orde elected ACPO President |work=Police Service of Northern Ireland |date=16 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919161257/http://www.psni.police.uk/16-04-09_chief_constable_acpo_announcement |archivedate=19 September 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>

ACPO was funded by [[Home Office]] grants, profits from commercial activities and contributions from the 44 police authorities in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.<ref name="gardham">{{cite news | author = Duncan Gardham | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/4631631/ACPO-makes-18m-from-criminal-records-checks.html | title= ACPO makes £18m from criminal records checks | work =Daily Telegraph | location=London | date=15 February 2009}}</ref>

Following the Parker Review into ACPO, it was replaced in 2015 by a new body, the [[National Police Chiefs' Council]], set up under a police collaboration agreement under Section 22A of the [[Police Act 1996]].

==Background==

UK policing sprang from local communities in the 1800s. Since the origins of policing, chief officers have regularly associated to discuss and share policing issues. Although ACPO as now recognised was formed in 1948, records of prior bodies go back to the early 1900s. The UK retains a decentralised model of policing based around the settlement which emerged from the Royal Commission on the work of the Police in 1962.

ACPO continued to provide a forum for chief officers across 44 local police forces and 13 national areas across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and provided local forces with agreed national policies and guidelines.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.acpo.police.uk/about_pages/structure.html | title = Our Structure | work = Association of Chief Police Officers | accessdate = 2010-03-04 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100326043638/http://www.acpo.police.uk/about_pages/structure.html | archivedate = 26 March 2010 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Originally more of a gentleman's club, it soon evolved into an effective body for representing senior ranks in the police service.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Newburn|first=Tim|title=Criminology|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|edition=3rd|location=|pages=655}}</ref>

ACPO failed to convince its sponsors to contribute to its survival and in May 2011 the [[BBC]] reported that ACPO would run out of money in February 2012 without extra funding. ACPO was half-funded by the Home Office and half by 44 [[police authority|police authorities]]. A third of police authorities refused to pay in 2010 and another third were undecided. The [[Association of Police Authorities]] said the withdrawal of funding by police authorities was "partly due to a squeeze on their income".<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13462904 | title = Police chiefs' body Acpo 'may go bust' as funds dry up |accessdate=2011-12-05 | work=BBC News | date=20 May 2011}}</ref> ACPO was due to wind up formally in April 2015.

==Constitutional status==

Over time, demands for coordination across the police service increased as society changed,<ref>{{cite book
|title=Handbook of Policing
|author=Newburn, T
|year=2008
|isbn=978-0-571-15089-2
|publisher=Willan Publishing
|chapter=5
|authorlink=Tim Newburn}}</ref> for example to take account of new developments in international terrorism and organised crime, or roles such as monitoring offenders on release from prison or working with young people to divert them from crime.

In 1997 ACPO was incorporated as a private [[company limited by guarantee]]. As a private company, ACPO was not subject to [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom|freedom of information legislation]]. It was not a staff association; the staff association for senior police officers was a separate body, the Chief Police Officers Staff Association (CPOSA).

The change in structure from a "band of volunteers" to a limited company allowed the organisation to employ staff, enter into contracts for accommodation and publish accounts.

A number of options were considered for the status of ACPO, including charitable status, but all were discounted.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nypa.org.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=3953&p=0 |title=APA BOARD MEETING – WEDNESDAY 4 NOVEMBER 2009 |access-date=17 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313153128/http://nypa.org.uk/chttphandler.ashx?id=3953&p=0 |archive-date=13 March 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Chief Constables and Commissioners are responsible for the direction and control of policing in their force areas. Although a national body and recognized by the government for consultation, ACPO had no powers of its own, nor any mandate to instruct chief officers.  However, the organisation allowed chief officers to form a national policy rather than replicate the work in each of their forces. For example, after the 1980–81 riots in 27 British cities including in [[1980 St. Pauls riot|St. Pauls]] and [[1981 Brixton riot|Brixton]] ACPO began to prepare the [[Public Order Manual of Tactical Operations and Related Matters]].  Police forces began training in its tactics late in 1983.<ref>{{cite book

==Membership==
ACPO was not a staff association. It acted for the police service, not its members. The separate [[Chief Police Officers Staff Association]] acts for chief officers.

ACPO was composed of the [[chief police officer]]s of the 44 police forces in [[England & Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Deputy Chief Constable]] and [[Assistant Chief Constable]] of 42 of those forces and the [[Deputy Commissioner]], [[Assistant Commissioner]], [[Deputy Assistant Commissioner]] and [[Commander]]s of the remaining two - the [[Metropolitan Police]] and [[City of London Police]]. Certain senior non-police staff and senior members of national police agencies and certain other specialised and non-geographical forces in the UK, the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]] were also members.

As of March 2010 there were 349 members of ACPO.<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://www.acpo.police.uk |title=About ACPO |work=Association of Chief Police Officers |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050725074911/http://www.acpo.police.uk/ |archivedate=25 July 2005 |df=dmy }}</ref> The membership elected a full-time President, who held the office of Chief Constable under the Police Reform Act 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=all+primary&PageNumber=11&NavFrom=2&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112766&filesize=774 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805225723/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=all+primary&PageNumber=11&NavFrom=2&parentActiveTextDocId=112639&ActiveTextDocId=112766&filesize=774 |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 August 2012 |title=President of ACPO |work=Police Reform Act 2002 }}</ref>

==ACPO bodies==
ACPO was responsible for several ancillary bodies, which it either funded or which received Home Office funding but which reported to ACPO:

===ACPO Criminal Records Office===
The [[ACPO Criminal Records Office]] (ACRO) was set up in 2006 in response to a perceived gap in the police service's ability to manage criminal records and in particular to improve links to biometric data. The initial aim of ACRO was to provide operational support relating to criminal records and associated [[Biometrics|biometric]] data, including [[DNA]] and [[fingerprint recognition]].

It also issues police certificates, for a fee, needed to obtain immigration visas for countries including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Cayman Islands, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx |title=Police Certificates|work=ACRO Criminal Records Office|archivedate=7 June 2019 |df=dmy }}</ref>

The organization continues under the style "ACRO Criminal Records Office" under the control of [[Hampshire Constabulary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acro.police.uk/About_Us.aspx|title=About Us|work=ACRO Criminal Records Office|archivedate=7 June 2019 |df=dmy }}</ref>

===ACPO Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service===
The Association of Chief Police Officers Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (AVCIS), later the [[National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service]] (NAVCIS), was managed by ACPO, and was responsible for combating organised vehicle crime and the use of vehicles in crime.<ref name="about ACVIS">{{cite web|url=http://www.acpo.police.uk/avcis/aboutavcis.asp |title=About AVCIS |publisher=Association of Chief Police Officers |accessdate=2010-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326045759/http://www.acpo.police.uk/avcis/aboutavcis.asp |archivedate=26 March 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>

===National Community Tension Team===
The [[National Community Tension Team]] (NCTT) was an ACPO body which monitored religious, racial, or other tensions within communities, and provided liaison between police forces and community organisations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acpo.police.uk/NCTT/FLAC%20-%20FAQs.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109083838/http://www.acpo.police.uk/NCTT/FLAC%20-%20FAQs.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-11-09 |title=National Community Tension Team FAQ Leaflet |work=Association of Chief Police Officers |accessdate=2010-04-08 }}</ref>

===National Counter Terrorism Security Office===
The [[National Counter Terrorism Security Office]] was funded by, and reported to, ACPO and advised the British government on its counter terrorism strategy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nactso.gov.uk/ |title=National Counter Terrorism Security Office website |accessdate=2010-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114232020/http://www.nactso.gov.uk/ |archivedate=14 January 2010 }}</ref>

===Police National Information and Co-ordination Centre===
ACPO was responsible for coordinating the national mobilisation of police resources at times of national need through the [[Police National Information and Co-ordination Centre]] (PNICC), which it set up in 2003.<ref name="hansardjuly2009"/> This included ensuring policing resilience during major events such as emergency response to serious flooding or the investigation of a terrorist attack. PNICC sat alongside the government in COBR ([[Cabinet Office Briefing Room]]) to advise on national issues. PNICC also handled support to overseas crises involving UK nationals.

It employed three full-time staff, with other staff seconded to it as needed and is funded by contributions from each of the police forces.<ref name="hansardjuly2009">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090721/text/90721w0093.htm |title=Daily Hansard - Written Answers - Police National Intelligence and Co-ordination Centre |work=Hansard |publisher=United Kingdom Parliament |date=21 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605055155/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090721/text/90721w0093.htm |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit===
{{main|Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit}}
The [[Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit]] (CTIRU) was set up in 2010 by ACPO (and run by the [[Metropolitan Police]]) to [[Internet censorship in the United Kingdom|remove unlawful terrorist material content from the Internet]] with a focus on UK based material.

The December 2013 report of the [[Prime Minister's Extremism task force]]<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-extremism-in-the-uk-report-by-the-extremism-taskforce Tackling extremism in the UK: report by the Extremism Taskforce], GOV.UK, 2013-12-04</ref> said that it would "work with internet companies to restrict access to terrorist material online which is hosted overseas but illegal under UK law" and "work with the internet industry to help them in their continuing efforts to identify extremist content to include in [[Web blocking in the United Kingdom|family-friendly filters]]" which would likely involve lobbying ISPs to add the CTIRU list to their filters without the need for additional legislation.

===National Wildlife Crime Unit===
The [[National Wildlife Crime Unit]] is a national police unit that gathers intelligence on wildlife crime and provides analytical and investigative support to law enforcement agencies.

==Controversies==

===Freedom of information===
ACPO had been criticised as being unaccountable to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] or the public by virtue of its limited company status.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7053182.ece | title = Tories accuse senior police of giving political cover to Labour | author = Sean O’Neill | work = Times Online | date = 10 March 2010 | location=London}}</ref> In October 2009 [[Sir Hugh Orde]] stated that ACPO would be "more than happy" to be subject to the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]].<ref name="transcript">{{cite web | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmhaff/uc1006-i/uc100602.htm | title = Uncorrected transcript of oral evidence taken before the Home Affairs Committee - Sir Hugh Orde and Chief Constable Tim Hollis | publisher=United Kingdom Parliament | date = 13 October 2009}}</ref> On 30 March 2010, the [[Ministry of Justice]] announced that ACPO would be included under the FOI Act from October 2011.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/newsrelease300310a.htm | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130128112038/http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/newsrelease300310a.htm | url-status = dead | archive-date = 28 January 2013 | title = Greater transparency in Freedom of Information | publisher = UK Ministry of Justice | date = 30 March 2010 }}</ref> In its response, the organisation stated that "Although organisations cannot voluntarily comply with the Act, a large proportion of ACPO's work is public already or available under FOI through any police force".<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.acpo.police.uk/pressrelease.asp?PR_GUID=75F61D4B-1469-448B-B6B7-ECF70FC4BEAB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220247/http://www.acpo.police.uk/pressrelease.asp?PR_GUID=75F61D4B-1469-448B-B6B7-ECF70FC4BEAB |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 April 2014 |title=Comment on MOJ announcement for ACPO to come under FOI in October 2011 |publisher=Association of Chief Police Officers |date=30 March 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-01 |df=dmy }}</ref> In January 2011 its website still said it: "is unable to do is to respond to requests for information under the Act.

===Apartments===
The organisation was criticised in February 2010 for allegedly spending £1.6 million per year from government anti-terrorist funding grants on renting up to 80 apartments in the centre of London which were reported as being empty most of the time.<ref name="les">{{cite news | author = Felix Allen and Justin Davenport | url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23808461-police-chiefs-group-spent-pound-16m-on-westminster-flats.do | title = Police chiefs' group spent £1.6m on Westminster flats| work = London Evening Standard | date = 22 February 2010 | accessdate=2010-03-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100304082152/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23808461-police-chiefs-group-spent-pound-16m-on-westminster-flats.do| archivedate= 4 March 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The organisation responded that it had reviewed this policy and would reduce the number of apartments.<ref name="les"/>

===Undercover activities===
As a result of ''[[The Guardian]]'' articles with regards to the activities and accusations of [[Mark Kennedy (police officer)|PC Mark Kennedy]] of the [[National Public Order Intelligence Unit]] within the National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit, and the collapse of the subsequent trial of six activists, a number of initiatives and changes were announced:<ref name=Guard18Jan>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jan/18/covert-policing-cleanup-acpo|title=Clean-up of covert policing ordered after Mark Kennedy revelations|publisher=The Guardian|date=17 January 2011|accessdate=2011-01-19|location=London|first1=Alan|last1=Travis|first2=Paul|last2=Lewis|first3=Martin|last3=Wainwright| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110119031912/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jan/18/covert-policing-cleanup-acpo| archivedate= 19 January 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>

*The [[Association of Police Authorities]] said it was ending its annual £850,000 grant to ACPO.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

===DNA database===

ACPO has supervised the creation of one of the world's largest per-capita DNA databases, containing the DNA profiles of more than one million innocent people. ACPO's guidelines that these profiles should only be deleted in "exceptional circumstances" were found to be unlawful by the [[UK Supreme Court]] in May 2011.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13440012 | work=BBC News | title=DNA and fingerprint guidelines 'unlawful' | date=18 May 2011}}</ref> They were found to be incompatible with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], following the ruling by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in ''[[S and Marper v United Kingdom]]''. On 1 May 2012, the [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]] completed its passage through Parliament and received [[Royal Assent]]. To date, ACPO has not reissued revised guidelines to replace its unlawful DNA exceptional procedure. [[Big Brother Watch]], in a [http://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/files/DNA_REPORT_June2012.pdf report] of June 2012, concludes that despite the Protection of Freedoms Act, the retention of DNA in England and Wales remains an uncertain and illiberal regime.

===Fake uniforms===

During the summer of 2011, [[Hugh Orde]], then president of the ACPO, was seen wearing a dark blue police-style uniform with ACPO insignia, and was accused of wearing a fake uniform. Senior police officers claimed that the uniform was not that of any police force in the country but "closely resembled" the uniform worn by former [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], [[Paul Stephenson (police officer)|Paul Stephenson]]. [[Sam Leith]], an author, journalist and literary editor of ''[[The Spectator]]'', mocked Orde's decision "to wear this [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gadaffi-style]] pretend uniform on television", and suggested it was "a subliminal pitch for the Met Commissioner's job."<ref>{{cite news|title=Oh, how we love a man in fake uniform|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|location=London|date=22 August 2011|page=15|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A264939733/STND?sid=wikipedia|via=[[InfoTrac]]|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref> [[Brian Paddick, Baron Paddick|Brian Paddick]], at the time the [[Commander#British police rank|Police Commander]] for the [[London Borough of Lambeth]], said: "It's unusual for the president of ACPO to appear in all these interviews in uniform.

== Parker Review ==
In 2013, an independent review of ACPO by [[General (British Army)|General]] [[Sir Nick Parker]] was published.
