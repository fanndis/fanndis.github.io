Over the past 3,000 years, the city of Beijing has had [[names of Beijing|numerous other names]]. The name ''Beijing'', which means "Northern Capital" (from the [[Chinese characters]] {{lang|zh|北}} for ''north'' and {{lang|zh|京}} for ''capital''), was applied to the city in 1403 during the [[Ming dynasty]] to distinguish the city from [[Nanjing]] (the "Southern Capital").<ref name="minggov">{{Cite journal |jstor = 2718619|title = Governmental Organization of the Ming Dynasty|journal = Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume = 21|pages = 1–66|last1 = Hucker|first1 = Charles O.|year = 1958|doi = 10.2307/2718619}}</ref> The English spelling ''Beijing'' is based on the government's official [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]] (adopted in the 1980s) of the two characters as they are pronounced in [[Standard Mandarin]].

{{Main|History of Beijing}}

=== Early history ===
The earliest traces of human habitation in the Peking municipality were found in the caves of [[Dragon Bone Hill]] near the village of [[Zhoukoudian]] in [[Fangshan District]], where [[Peking Man]] lived. ''[[Homo erectus]]'' fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. [[Paleolithic]] ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' also lived there more recently, about 27,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/ext/field/beijing/whc/pkm-site.htm|title=The Peking Man World Heritage Site at Zhoukoudian|access-date=7 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309111645/http://www.unesco.org/ext/field/beijing/whc/pkm-site.htm|archive-date=9 March 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Archaeologists have found [[neolithic]] settlements throughout the municipality, including in [[Wangfujing]], located in central Peking.

The first [[ancient Chinese urban planning|walled city]] in Beijing was [[Jicheng (Beijing)|Jicheng]], the capital city of the [[state of Ji]] and was built in 1045 BC.<!--not BCE; see talk--> Within modern Beijing, Jicheng was located around the present [[Guang'anmen]] area in the south of [[Xicheng District]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |title=Beijing's History |url=http://china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/30785.htm |publisher=China Internet Information Center|access-date=1 May 2008|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080501152800/http://www1.china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/30785.htm|archive-date= 1 May 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> This settlement was later conquered by the [[state of Yan]] and made its capital.<ref>Haw, Stephen.

=== Early Imperial China ===
[[File:Tianning Temple Pagoda.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Pagoda of Tianning Temple (Beijing)|Tianning Pagoda]], built around 1120 during the [[Liao dynasty]].]]
After the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] [[Qin's wars of unification|unified China]], Jicheng became a [[zhou (region)|prefectural capital]] for the region.<ref name="hist"/> During the [[Three Kingdoms period]], it was held by [[Gongsun Zan]] and [[Yuan Shao]] before falling to the [[Cao Wei|Wei Kingdom]] of [[Cao Cao]]. The AD 3rd-century [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Western Jin]] demoted the town, placing the prefectural seat in neighboring [[Zhuo Prefecture|Zhuozhou]].

During the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] period when northern China was conquered and divided by the [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]], Jicheng was briefly the capital of the [[Xianbei]] [[Former Yan]] Kingdom.<ref name=Rene>{{cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |url=https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppes00grou |url-access=registration |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/empireofsteppes00grou/page/58 58]}}</ref>

After China was reunified during the [[Sui dynasty]], Jicheng, also known as [[Zhuo Commandery|Zhuojun]], became the northern terminus of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]]. Under the [[Tang dynasty]], Jicheng as [[Youzhou]], served as a military frontier command center. During the [[An-Shi Rebellion]] and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang, local military commanders founded their own short-lived Yan dynasties and called the city [[Yanjing]], or the "Yan Capital." Also in the Tang dynasty, the city's name Jicheng was replaced by Youzhou or Yanjing. In 938, after the fall of the Tang, the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]] ceded [[sixteen Prefectures|the entire northern frontier]] to the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]], which treated the city as [[Liao Nanjing|Nanjing]], or the "Southern Capital", one of four secondary capitals to complement its "Supreme Capital", Shangjing (modern [[Baarin Left Banner]] in [[Inner Mongolia]]). Some of the [[List of pagodas in Beijing|oldest surviving structures in Beijing]] date to the Liao period, including the [[Pagoda of Tianning Temple (Beijing)|Tianning Pagoda]].

The Liao fell to the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jurchen Jin dynasty]] in 1122, which gave the city to the [[Song dynasty]] and then retook it in 1125 during its [[Jin–Song Wars|conquest of northern China]].  In 1153, the Jurchen Jin made Beijing their "Central Capital", or [[Zhongdu]].<ref name="hist"/> The city was besieged by [[Genghis Khan]]'s invading [[Mongol Empire|Mongolian army]] in 1213 and [[battle of Zhongdu|razed to the ground]] two years later.<ref name="economist">{{cite news |title=Beijing – Historical Background |url=http://www.economist.com/cities/findstory.cfm?city_id=BJS&folder=Facts-History |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522144445/http://www.economist.com/cities/findstory.cfm?city_id=BJS&folder=Facts-History |archive-date=22 May 2007 |work=The Economist|year=2007}}</ref> Two generations later, [[Kublai Khan]] ordered the construction of [[Khanbaliq|Dadu]] (or Daidu to the Mongols, commonly known as [[Khanbaliq]]), a new capital for his [[Yuan dynasty]] to the northeast of the Zhongdu ruins.

Facilities for Manchu worship were introduced, but the Qing also continued the traditional state rituals. Signage was bilingual or Chinese. This early Qing Beijing later formed the setting for the [[Four Great Classical Novels|Chinese novel]] ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''. Northwest of the city, Qing emperors built several large palatial gardens including the [[Old Summer Palace]] and the [[Summer Palace]].

During the [[Second Opium War]], Anglo-French forces captured the outskirts of the city, looting and burning the [[Old Summer Palace]] in 1860. Under the [[Convention of Peking]] ending that war, Western powers for the first time secured the right to establish [[Beijing Legation Quarter|permanent diplomatic presences]] within the city. From 14 to 15 August 1900 the [[Battle of Peking (1900)|Battle of Peking]] was fought. This battle was part of the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. 
The attempt by the [[Boxers (group)|Boxers]] to eradicate this presence, as well as [[Chinese christian|Chinese Christian]] converts, led to Beijing's reoccupation by eight [[Eight-Nation Alliance|foreign powers]].<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|pp=119–120}}</ref> During the fighting, several important structures were destroyed, including the [[Hanlin Academy]] and the (new) [[Summer Palace]].
A [[peace agreement]] was concluded between the [[Eight-Nation Alliance ]]and representatives of the Chinese government [[Li Hongzhang|Li Hung-chang]] and [[Yikuang|Prince Ching]] on 7 September 1901. The treaty required China to pay an indemnity of US$335 million (over US$4 billion in current dollars) plus interest over a period of 39 years. Also required was the execution or exile of government supporters of the Boxers and the destruction of Chinese forts and other defenses in much of northern China. Ten days after the treaty was signed the foreign armies left Peking, although legation guards would remain there until [[World War II]].<ref>Preston, p. 310–311</ref>

With the treaty signed the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] returned to Peking from her "tour of inspection" on 7 January 1902 and the rule of the [[Qing]] dynasty over China was restored, albeit much weakened by the defeat it had suffered in the Boxer Rebellion and by the indemnity and stipulations of the peace treaty.<ref>Preston, pp. 312–315</ref> The Dowager died in 1908 and the dynasty imploded in 1911.

The fomenters of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 sought to replace Qing rule with a republic and leaders like [[Sun Yat-sen]] originally intended to return the capital to Nanjing. After the Qing general [[Yuan Shikai]] forced the abdication of the last Qing emperor and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries accepted him as president of the new [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].

He restored the name of the city, as the new capital, to Beijing,<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=168}}</ref> a decision that had been reached by the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] just a few days earlier.

In the 1950s, the city began to expand beyond the old walled city and its surrounding neighborhoods, with heavy industries in [[Shijingshan District|the west]] and residential neighborhoods in [[Hepingli Subdistrict, Beijing|the north]]. Many areas of the [[Beijing city fortifications|Beijing city wall]] were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the construction of the [[Beijing Subway]] and the [[2nd Ring Road]].

During the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976, the [[Red Guard (China)|Red Guard]] movement began in Beijing and the city's government fell victim to one of the first purges. By the autumn of 1966, all city schools were shut down and over a million Red Guards from across the country gathered in Beijing for eight rallies in Tian'anmen Square with Mao.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dangshi.people.com.cn/GB/85039/14329784.html |script-title=zh:毛主席八次接见红卫兵的组织工作 |script-work=zh:中国共产党新闻网 |date=7 April 2011 |language=zh-cn}} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706102741/http://dangshi.people.com.cn/GB/85039/14329784.html |date=6 July 2017 }}</ref> In April 1976, a large public gathering of Beijing residents against the [[Gang of Four]] and the Cultural Revolution in Tiananmen Square [[Tiananmen Incident|was forcefully suppressed]].

Since the early 1980s, the urban area of Beijing has expanded greatly with the completion of the 2nd Ring Road in 1981 and the subsequent addition of the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd]], [[4th Ring Road|4th]], [[5th Ring Road|5th]] and [[6th Ring Road]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=217}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=255}}</ref> According to one 2005 newspaper report, the size of newly developed Beijing was one-and-a-half times larger than before.<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=252}}</ref> [[Wangfujing]] and [[Xidan]] have developed into flourishing shopping districts,<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=149}}</ref> while [[Zhongguancun]] has become a major center of electronics in China.<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|pp=249–250}}</ref> In recent years, the expansion of Beijing has also brought to the forefront some problems of urbanization, such as [[Traffic congestion|heavy traffic]], [[Air pollution|poor air quality]], the loss of historic neighborhoods, and a significant influx of migrant workers from less-developed [[rural area]]s of the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|pp=255–256}}</ref>  Beijing has also been the location of many significant events in recent Chinese history, principally the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref name="BBC News">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4313282.stm Picture Power:Tiananmen Standoff] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217014228/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4313282.stm |date=17 February 2009 }} BBC News.</ref> The city has also hosted major international events, including the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2015 World Championships in Athletics]], and was chosen to host the [[2022 Winter Olympics]], making it the first city to ever host both Winter and Summer Olympics.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/entry/2022-winter-olympics_55bb4805e4b06363d5a1aa34|title=IOC: Beijing To Host 2022 Winter Olympics|agency=Associated Press|date=31 July 2015|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=11 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810230449/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2022-winter-olympics_55bb4805e4b06363d5a1aa34|archive-date=10 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{Main|Geography of Beijing}}
[[File:Large Beijing Landsat.jpg|thumb|left|[[Landsat 7]] Satellite image of Beijing Municipality with the surrounding mountains in dark brown]]
[[File:Jingshan.JPG|thumb|[[Jingshan Park|Jingshan]], the highest point in the old walled city of Beijing.]]
[[File:The Great Wall of China at Jinshanling-edit.jpg|thumb|right|Remnants of the [[Great Wall of China]] in the mountains north of the city.]]
Beijing is situated at the northern tip of the roughly triangular [[North China Plain]], which opens to the south and east of the city. Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially [[Yanqing County]] and [[Huairou District]], are dominated by the [[Jundu Mountains]], while the western part is framed by ''Xishan'' or the [[Western Hills]]. The [[Great Wall of China]] across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. [[Mount Ling (Beijing)|Mount Dongling]], in the Western Hills and on the border with [[Hebei]], is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of {{convert|2303|m}}.

Major rivers flowing through the municipality, including the [[Chaobai River|Chaobai]], [[Yongding River|Yongding]], [[Juma River (China)|Juma]], are all tributaries in the [[Hai River]] system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] to [[Hangzhou]], which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the [[South–North Water Transfer Project]], constructed in the past decade to bring water from the [[Yangtze River]] basin.

The urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of {{convert|40|to(-)|60|m|ft|abbr=off}}, occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric [[Ring Roads of Beijing|ring roads]].  The [[Second Ring Road (Beijing)|Second Ring Road]] traces the [[Beijing city wall|old city walls]] and the [[Sixth Ring Road]] connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. [[Tian'anmen]] and [[Tian'anmen Square]] are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the [[Forbidden City]], the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is [[Zhongnanhai]], the residence of China's current leaders. [[Chang'an Avenue]], which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main east–west axis.

=== Architecture ===
{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Beijing}}
Three styles of architecture are predominant in urban Beijing. First, there is the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive [[Tian'anmen]] (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the [[Forbidden City]], the [[Imperial Ancestral Temple]] and the [[Temple of Heaven]]. Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as the "Sino-Sov" style, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Business Buide to Beijing and North-East China |edition=2006–2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2TvFN9DmqkC&q=%22sino-sov%22+%2Barchitecture&pg=PA108 |page=108 |isbn=978-988-98673-3-1 |year=2006 |publisher=China Briefing Media |location=Hong Kong |access-date=22 July 2009}}</ref> Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms, most noticeably in the area of the [[Beijing CBD]] in east Beijing such as the new [[CCTV Headquarters]], in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the [[Beijing National Stadium]] and [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (China)|National Center for the Performing Arts]].

Since 2007, buildings in Beijing have received the [[CTBUH Skyscraper Award]] for best overall tall building twice, for the [[Linked Hybrid]] building in 2009 and the [[CCTV Headquarters]] in 2013. The CTBUH Skyscraper award for best tall overall building is given to only one building around the world every year.

In the early 21st century, Beijing has witnessed tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers, most pronounced in the CBD region. A mixture of both 1950s design and [[neofuturistic]] style of architecture can be seen at the [[798 Art Zone]], which mixes the old with the new. Beijing's current completed tallest building is the 330-meter [[China World Trade Center Tower III]], but will be surpassed by the 528-meter [[China Zun]] in 2018 when it is completed. Both buildings are in the [[Beijing CBD]].

[[File:Doujiao Hutong.jpg|thumb|The sign of Doujiao [[Hutong]], one of the many traditional alleyways in the inner city]]
Beijing is famous for its ''[[siheyuan]]s'', a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the [[Prince Gong Mansion]] and [[Former Residence of Soong Ching-ling (Beijing)|Residence of Soong Ching-ling]]. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called ''[[hutong]]s''. The ''hutongs'' are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good [[Feng Shui]]. They vary in width; some are so narrow only a few pedestrians can pass through at a time. Once ubiquitous in Beijing, ''siheyuans'' and ''hutongs'' are rapidly disappearing,<ref>

=== Environmental issues ===
Beijing has a long history of [[environmental problems]].<ref>[[J.R. McNeill]], ''Something New Under the Sun: An Environmental History of the 20th-Century World''. New York: Norton, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-14-029509-2}}.</ref> Between 2000 and 2009 Beijing's urban extent quadrupled, which not only strongly increased the extent of anthropogenic emissions, but also changed the meteorological situation fundamentally, even if [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] of human society are not included. For example, surface [[albedo]], wind speed and [[humidity]] near the surface were decreased, whereas ground and near-surface [[air temperature]]s, vertical air dilution and [[ozone]] levels were increased.<ref>[[Mark Z. Jacobson]], Son V. Nghiem, Alessandro Sorichetta, Natasha Whitney, ''Ring of impact from the mega-urbanization of Beijing between 2000 and 2009''. In: ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]: Atmospheres'' 120, Issue 12, (2015), 5740–5756, {{DOI|10.1002/2014JD023008}}.</ref> Because of the combined factors of urbanization and pollution caused by burning of [[fossil fuel]], Beijing is often affected by serious environmental problems, which lead to [[health]] issues of many inhabitants. In 2013 heavy [[smog]] struck Beijing and most parts of northern China, impacting a total of 600 million people. After this "pollution shock" [[air pollution]] became an important economic and social concern in China. After that the government of Beijing announced measures to reduce air pollution, for example by lowering the share of coal from 24% in 2012 to 10% in 2017, while the national government ordered heavily polluting vehicles to be removed from 2015 to 2017 and increased its efforts to transition the energy system to clean sources.<ref>Peter Sheehan, Enjiang Cheng, Alex English, Fanghong Sun, ''China's response to the air pollution shock''. In: ''[[Nature Climate Change]]'' 4, (2014), 306–309, {{DOI|10.1038/nclimate2197}}.</ref>

==== Air quality ====
Joint research between American and Chinese researchers in 2006 concluded that much of the city's pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces. On average 35–60% of the [[ozone]] can be traced to sources outside the city. [[Shandong]] Province and [[Tianjin]] Municipality have a "significant influence on Beijing's air quality",<ref>David G. Streetsa, Joshua S. Fub, Carey J.

More recently, however, the government has increased its usage of such measures as closing factories temporarily and implementing greater restrictions for cars on the road, as in the case of "[[APEC blue]]" and "parade blue," short periods during and immediately preceding the [[APEC China 2014]] and the [[2015 China Victory Day Parade]], respectively.<ref>{{cite news|title="Parade Blue" Joins "APEC Blue" as Distant Memories as Nasty Air Returns to Beijing|url=https://thenanfang.com/beijing-air-quality-quickly-deteriorates-september-3-parade/|work=The Nanfang|first=Charles|last=Liu|date=12 May 2016|access-date=28 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128194925/https://thenanfang.com/beijing-air-quality-quickly-deteriorates-september-3-parade/|archive-date=28 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> During and prior to these events, Beijing's air quality improved dramatically, only to fall back to unhealthy levels shortly after.

Beijing air quality is often poor, especially in winter. In mid-January 2013, Beijing's air quality was measured on top of [[Embassy of the United States, Beijing|the city's US embassy]] at a PM2.5 density of 755 micrograms per cubic meter, which is more than 75 times the safe level established by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]], and went off the US Environmental Protection Agency's air quality index. It was widely reported, originally through a Twitter account, that the category was "crazy bad". This was later changed to "beyond index".<ref>{{cite news|title=Beijing Air Pollution Off the Charts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/science/earth/beijing-air-pollution-off-the-charts.html|work=The New York Times|first=Edward|last=Wong|date=12 January 2013|access-date=21 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303183741/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/science/earth/beijing-air-pollution-off-the-charts.html|archive-date=3 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 8 and 9 December 2015 Beijing had its first [[smog]] alert which shut down a majority of the industry and other commercial businesses in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title = As Beijing Shuts Down Over Smog Alert, Worse-Off Neighbors Carry On|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/world/asia/beijing-air-pollution-red-alert.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 9 December 2015|access-date = 9 December 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = Edward|last = Wong|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151209190120/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/world/asia/beijing-air-pollution-red-alert.html|archive-date = 9 December 2015|url-status=live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Later in the month another smog "red alert" was issued.<ref name="abc-2nd-red">{{cite news |title=Beijing issues second red alert for choking smog |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-18/beijing-issues-second-red-alert-for-pollution/7042490?section=environment |access-date=18 December 2015 |work=ABC News |agency=ABC |date=18 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218153144/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-18/beijing-issues-second-red-alert-for-pollution/7042490?section=environment |archive-date=18 December 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

According to Beijing's environmental protection bureau's announcement in November 2016, starting from 2017 highly polluting old cars will be banned from being driven whenever Smog "red alerts" are issued in the city or neighboring regions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/beijing-ban-polluting-cars-smog-alerts/|title=Beijing to ban polluting cars during smog alerts|last=Reuters|date=22 November 2016|website=www.atimes.com|access-date=2 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202090234/http://www.atimes.com/article/beijing-ban-polluting-cars-smog-alerts/|archive-date=2 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Readings ===
Due to Beijing's high level of air pollution, there are various readings by different sources on the subject. Daily pollution readings at 27 monitoring stations around the city are reported on the website of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (BJEPB).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bjepb.gov.cn/ |script-title=zh:首页 |publisher=Beijing Municipal Web |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229060137/http://www.bjepb.gov.cn/ |archive-date=29 December 2015 }}</ref> The American Embassy of Beijing also reports hourly [[particulates|fine particulate (PM2.5)]] and [[ozone]] levels on Twitter.<ref name=Demick/> Since the BJEPB and US Embassy measure different pollutants according to different criteria, the pollution levels and the impact to human health reported by the BJEPB are often lower than that reported by the US Embassy.<ref name=Demick>{{cite news |title=U.S. Embassy air quality data undercut China's own assessment |author=Barbara Demick |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=29 October 2011 |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/29/world/la-fg-china-air-quality-20111030 |access-date=7 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107091929/http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/29/world/la-fg-china-air-quality-20111030 |archive-date=7 November 2011 |url-status=live  }} (login required)</ref>

Dust from the erosion of deserts in northern and northwestern China results in seasonal [[dust storm]]s that plague the city; the [[Beijing Weather Modification Office]] sometimes artificially induces rainfall to fight such storms and mitigate their effects.<ref>{{cite news |title=China says it made rain to wash off sand |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/12644965 |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=5 May 2006 |access-date=22 July 2009  }}</ref> In the first four months of 2006 alone, there were no fewer than eight such storms.<ref>

== Government ==
{{Main|Politics of Beijing}}

Municipal government is regulated by the local [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), led by the Beijing [[CPC Secretary]] ({{zh|北京市委书记}}). The local CPC issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.

Government officials include the [[Mayor of Beijing|mayor]] ({{zh|市长}}) and vice-mayor. Numerous bureaus focus on law, public security, and other affairs. Additionally, as the capital of China, Beijing houses all of the important national governmental and political institutions, including the [[National People's Congress]].<ref name="britannica government">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Beijing – Administration and society – Government |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/448956/Beijing/232381/Administration-and-society#toc=toc232382 |encyclopedia=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |year=2008 |access-date=16 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609035720/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/448956/Beijing/232381/Administration-and-society#toc=toc232382 |archive-date=9 June 2008 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

People native to urban Beijing speak the [[Beijing dialect]], which belongs to the Mandarin subdivision of [[Chinese spoken language|spoken Chinese]]. This speech is the basis for ''[[putonghua]]'', the standard spoken language used in mainland China and [[Taiwan]], and one of the four official languages of [[Singapore]]. Rural areas of Beijing Municipality have [[Jilu Mandarin|their own dialects]] akin to those of Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing Municipality.

Beijing or [[Peking opera]] is a traditional form of Chinese theater well known throughout the nation. Commonly lauded as one of the highest achievements of [[Chinese culture]], Beijing opera is performed through a combination of song, spoken dialogue, and codified action sequences involving gestures, movement, fighting and acrobatics. Much of Beijing opera is carried out in an archaic stage dialect quite different from Modern Standard Chinese and from the modern Beijing dialect.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Jingxi |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/112926/jingxi |encyclopedia=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |year=2008 |access-date=16 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503130136/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/112926/jingxi |archive-date=3 May 2008 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

[[Beijing cuisine]] is the local style of cooking. [[Peking Roast Duck]] is perhaps the best known dish. [[Fuling Jiabing]], a traditional Beijing snack food, is a pancake (''bing'') resembling a flat disk with a filling made from ''[[Fu Ling|fu ling]]'', a fungus used in traditional [[Chinese medicine]]. [[Teahouse]]s are also common in Beijing.

The [[cloisonné]] (or ''Jingtailan'', literally "Blue of [[Jingtai Emperor|Jingtai]]") metalworking technique and tradition is a Beijing art speciality, and is one of the most revered traditional crafts in China. Cloisonné making requires elaborate and complicated processes which include base-hammering, copper-strip inlay, soldering, enamel-filling, enamel-firing, surface polishing and gilding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khulsey.com/travel/china_beijing_crafts_cloisonne.html |title=Beijing – Chinese Cloisonné Enamelware |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611133538/http://www.khulsey.com/travel/china_beijing_crafts_cloisonne.html |archive-date=11 June 2008}}</ref> Beijing's [[lacquerware]] is also well known for its sophisticated and intricate patterns and images carved into its surface, and the various decoration techniques of lacquer include "carved lacquer" and "engraved gold".

Younger residents of Beijing have become more attracted to the nightlife, which has flourished in recent decades, breaking prior cultural traditions that had practically restricted it to the upper class.<ref>{{cite news |last=Levin |first=Dan |title=Beijing Lights Up the Night |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/fashion/15beijing.html |work=The New York Times |date=15 June 2008 |access-date=15 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417050902/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/fashion/15beijing.html |archive-date=17 April 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Today, [[Houhai]], [[Sanlitun]] and [[Wudaokou]] are Beijing's nightlife hotspots.

=== Chinese folk religion and Taoism ===
Beijing has many temples dedicated to [[Chinese gods and immortals|folk religious and communal deities]], many of which are being reconstructed or refurbished in the 2000s and 2010s. Yearly sacrifices to the [[Tian|God of Heaven]] ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|祭天}} |p=jìtiān}}<!--the term ''Tian'' has an article, but the different term "sacrifice to ''Tian''" does not-->) at the [[Temple of Heaven]] have been resumed by [[Confucianism|Confucian]] groups in the 2010s.

There are temples dedicated to the worship of the Goddess ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|娘娘}} |p=Niángniáng}}) in the city, one of them near the [[Beijing Olympic Village|Olympic Village]], and they revolve around a major cult center at [[Mount Miaofeng]]. There are also many temples consecrated to the [[Dragon King|Dragon God]], to the Medicine Master ({{zh|labels=no|s={{linktext|药|王}} |p=Yàowáng}}), to [[Guan Yu|Divus Guan (Guan Yu)]], to the Fire God ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|火神}} |p=Huǒshén}}), to the [[Caishen|Wealth God]], temples of the [[Chenghuangshen|City God]], and at least one temple consecrated to the [[Yellow Emperor|Yellow Deity]] of the [[Big Dipper|Chariot]] [[axis mundi|Shaft]] ({{zh|labels=no|s={{linktext|轩辕|黄帝}} |p=Xuānyuán Huángdì}}) in [[Pinggu District]]. Many of these temples are governed by the Beijing Taoist Association, such as the [[Huode Zhenjun Temple|Fire God Temple of the Shicha Lake]], while many others are not and are governed by popular committees and locals. A great Temple of Xuanyuan Huangdi will be built in Pinggu (possibly as an expansion of the already existing shrine) within 2020, and the temple will feature a statue of the deity which will be amongst the [[list of tallest statues|tallest in the world]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zsfh.org/a/cases/yuanquguihua/lvyoujingqu/2014/1217/1689.html |script-title=zh:平谷轩辕山国际旅游区概念性规划 |website=zsfh.org}}{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202063906/http://www.zsfh.org/a/cases/yuanquguihua/lvyoujingqu/2014/1217/1689.html |date=2 February 2017 }}.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fanhuazhida.com/cgal/lvyou-1240-1.html |script-title=zh:2020世界休闲大会战略规划 – 北京平谷旅游发展重大项目储备规划 |website=fanhuazhida.com}}{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121225057/http://fanhuazhida.com/cgal/lvyou-1240-1.html |date=21 January 2017 }}.</ref>

[[File:Dongcheng, Beijing, China - panoramio (84).jpg|thumb|[[Yonghe Temple]] of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]]]
11% of the population of Beijing practices [[East Asian Buddhism]]. The [[Buddhist Association of China]], the state's supervisory organ overseeing all [[Buddhist]] institutions in mainland China, is headquartered in the [[Guangji Temple (Beijing)|Guangji Temple]], a temple founded over 800 years ago during the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] in what is now [[Fuchengmen]]nei ({{lang|zh-hans|阜成门内}}). The Beijing Buddhist Association along with the Buddhist Choir and Orchestra are based in the [[Guanghua Temple (Beijing)|Guanghua Temple]], which dates to the Yuan dynasty over 700 years ago. The Buddhist Academy of China and its library are housed in the [[Fayuan Temple]] near [[Caishikou]]. The Fayuan Temple, which dates to the [[Tang dynasty]] 1300 years ago, is the oldest temple in urban Beijing. The [[Tongjiao Temple]] inside [[Dongzhimen]] is the city's only Buddhist nunnery.

The [[Xihuang Temple]] originally dates to the [[Liao dynasty]]. In 1651, the temple was commissioned by the [[Shunzhi Emperor|Qing Emperor Shunzhi]] to host the visit of the [[5th Dalai Lama|Fifth Dalai Lama]] to Beijing. Since then, this temple has hosted the [[13th Dalai Lama]] as well as the [[Lobsang Palden Yeshe, 6th Panchen Lama|Sixth]], [[Thubten Choekyi Nyima, 9th Panchen Lama|Ninth]] and [[Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama|Tenth]] [[Panchen Lama]]s. The largest Tibetan Buddhist Temple in Beijing is the [[Yonghe Temple]], which was decreed by the [[Qianlong Emperor|Qing Emperor Qianlong]] in 1744 to serve as the residence and research facility for his Buddhist preceptor of [[Changkya Rölpé Dorjé|Rölpé Dorjé]] the third [[Changkya Khutukhtu|Changkya]] (or living Buddha of [[Inner Mongolia]]). The Yonghe Temple is so-named because it was the childhood residence of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and retains the [[Chinese glazed roof tile|glazed tiles]] reserved for imperial palaces.

The [[Lingguang Temple (Beijing)|Lingguang Temple]] of [[Badachu]] in the [[Western Hills]] also dates to the Tang dynasty. The temple's Zhaoxian Pagoda ({{lang|zh-hans|招仙塔}}) was first built in 1071 during the Liao dynasty to hold a tooth relic of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The pagoda was destroyed during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and the tooth was discovered from its foundation. A new pagoda was built in 1964. The six aforementioned temples: Guangji, Guanghua, Tongjiao, Xihuang, Yonghe and Lingguang have been designated [[National Key Buddhist Temples in Han Chinese Area]].

In addition, other notable temples in Beijing include the [[Tanzhe Temple]] (founded in the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)]] is the oldest in the municipality), the [[Tianning Temple (Beijing)|Tianning Temple]] (oldest pagoda in the city), the [[Miaoying Temple]] (famed for [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]]-era white pagoda), the [[Wanshou Temple]] (home to the [[Beijing Art Museum]]) and the [[Big Bell Temple]] (Dazhong Temple).

Beijing is connected by road links to all parts of China as part of the National Trunk Road Network. Many [[expressways of China]] serve Beijing, as do 15 [[China National Highway]]s. Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the  "[[Ring Roads of Beijing|ring roads]]" that concentrically surround the city, with the [[Forbidden City]] area marked as the geographical center for the ring roads. The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. There is no official "1st Ring Road". The [[2nd Ring Road]] is located in the inner city. Ring roads tend to resemble [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] progressively as they extend outwards, with the [[5th Ring Road|5th]] and [[6th Ring Road]]s being full-standard national expressways, linked to other roads only by interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd Ring Road]] outward. A final outer orbital, the [[G95 Capital Area Loop Expressway|Capital Area Loop Expressway (G95)]], was fully opened in 2018 and will extend into neighboring [[Tianjin]] and [[Hebei]].

Within the urban core, city streets generally follow the checkerboard pattern of the ancient capital. Many of Beijing's boulevards and streets with "inner" and "outer" are still named in relation to gates in the city wall, though most gates no longer stand. Traffic jams are a major concern. Even outside of rush hour, several roads still remain clogged with traffic.

=== Taxi ===
Metered [[taxicab|taxi]] in Beijing start at ¥13 for the first {{convert|3|km}}, ¥2.3 [[Renminbi]] per additional {{convert|1|km}} and ¥1 per ride fuel surcharge, not counting idling fees which are ¥2.3 (¥4.6 during rush hours of 7–9 am and 5–7 pm) per 5 minutes of standing or running at speeds lower than {{convert|12|kph}}. Most taxis are [[Hyundai Elantra]]s, [[Hyundai Sonata]]s, [[Peugeot]]s, [[Citroën]]s and [[Volkswagen Jetta]]s. After {{convert|15|km}}, the base fare increases by 50% (but is only applied to the portion ''over'' that distance). Different companies have special colours combinations painted on their vehicles. Usually registered taxis have yellowish brown as basic hue, with another color of Prussian blue, hunter green, white, umber, tyrian purple, rufous, or sea green. Between 11&nbsp;pm and 5&nbsp;am, there is also a 20% fee increase. Rides over {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} and between 23:00 and 06:00 incur both charges, for a total increase of 80%. Tolls during trip should be covered by customers and the costs of trips beyond Beijing city limits should be negotiated with the driver. The cost of unregistered taxis is also subject to negotiation with the driver.

=== Bicycles ===

Beijing has long been well known for the number of bicycles on its streets. Although the rise of motor traffic has created a great deal of congestion and bicycle use has declined, bicycles are still an important form of local transportation. Many cyclists can be seen on most roads in the city, and most of the main roads have dedicated [[bicycle lanes]]. Beijing is relatively flat, which makes cycling convenient. The rise of [[electric bicycles]] and [[electric scooters]], which have similar speeds and use the same cycle lanes, may have brought about a revival in bicycle-speed two-wheeled transport. It is possible to cycle to most parts of the city. Because of the growing traffic congestion, the authorities have indicated more than once that they wish to encourage cycling, but it is not clear whether there is sufficient will to translate that into action on a significant scale.<ref>{{cite news |title=Campaign to boost cycling in Beijing |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/24/beijing-cycling-capital-plans/ |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=24 January 2010 |access-date=10 March 2011 |first=Jonathan |last=Watts |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909090335/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/24/beijing-cycling-capital-plans |archive-date=9 September 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> On Mar 30, 2019, a 6.5&nbsp;km bicycle-dedicated lane was opened, easing the traffic congestion between [[Huilongguan]] and [[Shangdi]] where there are many high-tech companies.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Xin |first1=Wen |title=Beijing's first dedicated bike lane eases traffic congestion |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201908/14/WS5d53d1d0a310cf3e35565c29.html |access-date=2020-05-31 |publisher=China Daily |date=2019-08-14}}</ref> Cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity spurred by the emergence of a large number of dockless app based [[Bicycle-sharing system|bikeshares]] such as [[Mobike]], [[Bluegogo]] and [[Ofo (bike sharing)|Ofo]] since 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.whatsonweibo.com/ofo-mobike-bluegogo-chinas-messy-bikeshare-market/|title=Ofo, Mobike, BlueGogo: China's Messy Bikeshare Market|work=What's on Weibo|access-date=13 August 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806025220/http://www.whatsonweibo.com/ofo-mobike-bluegogo-chinas-messy-bikeshare-market/|archive-date=6 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>
