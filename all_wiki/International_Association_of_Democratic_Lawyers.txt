==History==
The Association was founded in Paris in 1946. The IADL soon became communist-controlled and the United States became especially aggravated at IADL claims that they had documented proof of the US dropping poisoned mosquitos on [[North Korea]]ns and mass-torturing civilians during the [[Korean War]]. [[René Cassin]] resigned his presidency of the organization as a result in 1951, and the US successfully lobbied France to expel the headquarters of what it considered a [[communist front]] from Paris.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tolley, Jr. |first=Howard B. |date=2010 |title=The International Commission of Jurists: Global Advocates for Human Rights |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_msFY_uFcqUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |location= |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |pages=28–29 |isbn=978-0812203158 |author-link= }}</ref> As a response, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] started funding the [[International Commission of Jurists]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tolley, Jr. |first=Howard B. |date=2010 |title=The International Commission of Jurists: Global Advocates for Human Rights |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_msFY_uFcqUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |location= |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |page=31|isbn=978-0812203158 |author-link= }}</ref> Still in 1990 for example, the [[Soviet Union]] funded the organization with 100,000 US dollars.<ref name="Staar">Richard Felix Staar (1991).

At the end of 1967, there were 377 non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) which the United Nations Economic and Social Council could consult on questions with which they are concerned.

The organizations are divided into three groups: those in Category A, which have a basic interest in most of the activities of the Council; those in Category B, which have a special competence
but are concerned with only a few of the Council's activities; and those with a significant contribution to make to the Council's work, which are placed on a Register for ''ad hoc'' consultations. At the end of 1967, there were 143 NGOs with Category B status.<ref name="1967yun"/>
