It debuted on April 16, 2002, adopting the name, motto, and [[Nameplate (publishing)|masthead]] of the earlier New York paper, ''[[The Sun (New York City)|The Sun]]'' (1833–1950). It became the first general-interest [[broadsheet]] newspaper to be started in New York City in several decades. Its [[op-ed]] page became a prominent platform in the country for [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] viewpoints. Since 2009 ''The Sun'' has operated as an (occasional and erratic) online-only publisher of political and economic opinion pieces, as well as occasional arts content.

==History==
''The Sun'' was founded by a group of investors including publishing magnate [[Conrad Black]]. The goal was to provide an alternative to ''[[The New York Times]]'', featuring front page news about local and state events, in contrast to the emphasis on national and international news by the ''Times''. The Sun began business operations, prior to first publication, in October 2001.<ref name="ap-end"/>

The newspaper's president and editor-in-chief was [[Seth Lipsky]], former editor of ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]''. Managing editor [[Ira Stoll]] also served as company vice-president. Stoll had been a longtime critic of the ''Times'' in his media watchdog blog smartertimes.com.<ref name=bercovici>{{cite magazine

According to Scott Sherman, writing in ''[[The Nation]]'' in April 2007, ''The Sun'' was "a broadsheet that injects conservative ideology into the country's most influential philanthropic, intellectual and media hub; a paper whose day-to-day coverage of New York City emphasizes lower taxes, school vouchers and free-market solutions to urban problems; a paper whose elegant culture pages hold their own against the Times in quality and sophistication; a paper that breaks news and crusades on a single issue; a paper that functions as a journalistic SWAT team against individuals and institutions seen as hostile to Israel and Jews; and a paper that unapologetically displays the scalps of its victims."<ref name="Sherman">Sherman, Scott (2007-4-30). [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070430/sherman "''Sun''-rise in New York"]. ''[[The Nation]]''.</ref>

In the same article, [[Mark Malloch Brown]], [[Kofi Annan]]'s chief of staff at the [[United Nations]], described ''The Sun'' as "a pimple on the backside of American journalism." According to Sherman, Brown "accepts that the paper's obsession with the UN translates into influence ... he admitted ''The Sun'' "does punch way above its circulation number, on occasion". He goes on to say, "Clearly amongst its minuscule circulation were a significant number of diplomats. And so it did at times act as some kind of rebel house paper inside the UN. It fed the gossip mills and what was said in the cafeterias."<ref name="Sherman"/> Brown's insult was in the context of ''The Sun''{{'}}s reporting of the UN's central role in the [[Saddam Hussein]] [[Oil for food|Oil-for-Food scandal]].

In May 2007, ''[[Adweek]]'' columnist Tom Messner called ''The Sun'' "the best paper in New York", noting that "''The New York Sun'' is a conservative paper, but it gets the respect of the left. ''The Nation''{{'}}s April 30 issue contains an article on the ''Sun''{{'}}s rise by Scott Sherman that is as balanced an article as I have ever read in the magazine (not a gibe; you don't read ''The Nation'' for balance)."<ref>{{Cite web

Lance Esplund, Maureen Mullarkey, and David Cohen covered art, [[Francis Morrone]] art and architecture. Literature was extensively covered by [[Otto Penzler]] on mystery writing, [[Eric Ormsby]] on poetry, Carl Rollyson on biography. [[Amanda Gordon]] acted as society editor, [[Alan Wellikoff]] covered cars, and [[Will Friedwald]] wrote about jazz. Nathan Lee, Nicolas Rapold, Bruce Bennett, and Steve Dollar wrote on film.

''The Sun'' received critical praise for its sports section, writers for which included Steven Goldman, [[Thomas Hauser]], [[Sean Lahman]], Tim Marchman, and [[John Hollinger]]. Its [[crossword]] puzzle, edited by Peter Gordon, was called one of the two best in the United States.<ref name="Slate:crossword">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2145623/ |title=The Ultimate Crossword Smackdown.

==Financial problems, circulation, and end of print run==
''The Sun'' was started anew in 2002 in the face of a long-term decline of [[newspapers in the United States]], loss of advertising revenue to the Internet and the rise of [[new media]]. From the beginning, it struggled for existence.<ref name="ap-end"/><ref name=bercovici/><ref name="ap-mcshane"/> ''The Sun'' was the first new daily newspaper launched in New York since 1976, when [[News World Communications]], a company controlled by the [[Unification Church]], launched ''The News World'' (that was renamed the ''New York City Tribune'' in 1983 and folded in 1991).

At the time of its creation, one media financial analyst said the ''Sun's'' chances of survival were "pretty grim",<ref name="ap-mcshane">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K9IJAAAAIBAJ&pg=4827,1750906&dq=new-york-sun&hl=en | title=New York Sun will shine again | author=Larry McShane | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[The Bryan Times]] | date=April 14, 2002 | page=3}}</ref> while another media commentator characterized it as "the unlikeliest of propositions".<ref name=bercovici/>

==Related publication==
===''CityArts''===
In March 2009, a group of former contributors to ''The Sun''{{'}}s arts section, including Lance Esplund, [[Brice Brown]], Jay Nordlinger, Joel Lobenthal, and Marion Maneker, spearheaded a new paper, ''CityArts'', published by [[Manhattan Media]]. ''CityArts'' began as a monthly arts supplement in other Manhattan Media papers (including ''[[New York Press]]'', ''West Side Spirit'', and ''Our Town''), but soon changed to a stand-alone, twice-monthly free publication. A notice from 2009 claimed a distribution of 50,000 print copies.<ref>[http://www.manhattanmedia.com/press.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123050115/http://manhattanmedia.com/press.php |date=2012-11-23 }}. Accessed 24 October 2012.</ref> The paper's contents were published online at cityarts.info.

Due to low advertising revenue, ''CityArts'' reverted to a supplement in late 2012.<ref>{{cite web |author=Howard Mandel |url=http://www.artsjournal.com/jazzbeyondjazz/2012/09/demise-er-downsizing-of-an-new-york-city-arts-review.html |title=Demise — er, downsizing — of a New York City arts review |publisher=Artsjournal.com |date=2012-09-13 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720041743/http://www.artsjournal.com/jazzbeyondjazz/2012/09/demise-er-downsizing-of-an-new-york-city-arts-review.html |archive-date=2014-07-20 |url-status=live }}</ref>
