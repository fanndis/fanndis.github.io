==History==

===Predecessor companies===
In 1925, Fred C. Koch joined [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] classmate Lewis E. Winkler at an engineering firm in Wichita, Kansas, which was renamed the Winkler-Koch Engineering Company. In 1927, they developed a more efficient thermal cracking process for turning crude oil into gasoline. This process threatened the competitive advantage of established oil companies, which sued for patent infringement.<ref name=MrBig/>  Temporarily forced out of business in the United States, they turned to other markets, including the [[Soviet Union]], where Winkler-Koch built 15 cracking units between 1929 and 1932. During this time, Koch came to despise communism and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime.<ref name=MrBig>{{cite news |title=Mr. Big |author=Daniel Fisher |magazine=Forbes |date=March 13, 2006 |url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2006/0313/024.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812103027/https://www.forbes.com/global/2006/0313/024.html |archive-date=August 12, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=TSOS_Koch>{{cite book |title=The Science of Success: How Market-Based Management Built the World's Largest Private Company |last=Koch |first=Charles C. |author-link=Charles Koch |year=2007 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-0-470-13988-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/sciencesuccessho00koch/page/n21 6] |url=https://archive.org/details/sciencesuccessho00koch|url-access=limited }}</ref> In his 1960 book, ''A Business Man Looks at Communism'', Koch wrote that he found the USSR to be "a land of hunger, misery, and terror".<ref>{{cite book |title=A Business Man Looks at Communism |last=Koch |first=Fred C. |author-link=Fred C. Koch |year=1960 |location=Wichita, Kansas }}</ref> According to Charles Koch, "Virtually every engineer he worked with [there] was purged."<ref name=MrBig/>

In 1940, Koch joined new partners to create the Wood River Oil and Refining Company. In 1946, the firm acquired the Rock Island refinery and crude oil gathering system near [[Duncan, Oklahoma]]. Wood River was later renamed the Rock Island Oil & Refining Company.<ref name=Marshall/> Charles Koch joined Rock Island in 1961, having started his career at the management consulting firm [[Arthur D. Little]]. He became president in 1966 and chairman at age 32, upon his father's death the following year.<ref name=SEC_2005>{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/41077/000119312505225697/dex993.htm |title=Summary of Koch Industries History |date=November 14, 2005 |work=sec.gov |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |access-date=February 18, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604091428/http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/41077/000119312505225697/dex993.htm |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=101_Forbes>{{cite news |title=Creative destruction 101 |author=Bruce Upbin |author2=Brandon Copple |magazine=Forbes |date=December 14, 1998 }}</ref>

===Koch Industries===
Wood River Oil and Refining Company was renamed Koch Industries in 1968 in honor of Fred Koch, the year after his death. At that time, it was primarily an engineering firm with part interest in the [[Pine Bend Refinery]] in Minnesota, a crude oil-gathering system in Oklahoma,<ref name=MrBig/> and some cattle ranches.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rich Grass and Sweet Water | last=John | first=Lincoln | year=1989 | publisher=[[Texas A&M University Press]] | location=College Station |isbn=978-0-89096-387-6}}</ref> In 1968, Charles approached [[Unocal Corporation|Union Oil of California]] about buying their interest in Great Northern Oil Company and its Pine Bend Refinery but the discussions quickly stalled after Union asked for a large premium.<ref name=TSOS_Koch/> In 1969, Union Oil began trying to market their interest in Great Northern by telling potential buyers that Koch's controlling interest could be thwarted by currying favor with another owner, [[J. Howard Marshall|J. Howard Marshall II]]. When Marshall discovered this he threw his lot in with Koch, they together acquired a majority interest in the company and ultimately bought Union's interest.<ref name=Marshall>{{cite book |title=Done in Oil: An Autobiography |last=J. Howard |first=Marshall II |year=1994 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |location=College Station |isbn=978-0-89096-533-7 |page=254 }}</ref> Ownership of Pine Bend refinery led to several new businesses and capabilities, including chemicals, fibers, polymers, asphalt and other commodities such as [[petroleum coke]] and sulfur. These were followed by global commodity trading, gas liquids processing, real estate, pulp and paper, risk management and finance.<ref name=TSOS_Koch/>

In 1970, Charles was joined at the family firm by his brother [[David Koch]]. Having started as a technical services manager, David became president of Koch Engineering in 1979.

In 2005, the company acquired [[Georgia-Pacific]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Koch completes Georgia-Pacific tender offer | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2005/12/19/daily12.html | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=December 20, 2005 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428014435/https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2005/12/19/daily12.html | archive-date=April 28, 2018 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Koch Industries and Georgia-Pacific May Be a Perfect Fit | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/15/business/koch-industries-and-georgiapacific-may-be-a-perfect-fit.html | first=Leslie | last=Wayne | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 15, 2005 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302050209/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/15/business/koch-industries-and-georgiapacific-may-be-a-perfect-fit.html | archive-date=March 2, 2018 | df=mdy-all }}{{subscription required}}</ref>

In 2008, the company discovered that the French affiliate Koch-Glitsch had violated bribery laws allegedly securing contracts in [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[Morocco]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] after an investigation by Ethics Compliance officer, Egorova-Farines.<ref name="flout"/> After Koch Industries' investigative team looked into her findings, the four employees involved were terminated. According to journalist [[Jennifer Rubin (journalist)|Jennifer Rubin]], Koch Industries’ general counsel stated that Egorova-Farines failed to promptly share the findings, choosing instead to give the information to a manager at Koch-Glitsch who was later fired for bribery. According to Koch Industries’ general counsel, "Egorova-Farines was not fired but instead ran into performance problems, left the company to go on leave and never returned." Egorova-Farines sued Koch-Glitsch for wrongful termination in [[France]], lost, and "was ordered to pay costs for bringing a frivolous case".<ref name=Rubin>{{cite news |last=Rubin |first=Jennifer |author-link=Jennifer Rubin (journalist) |title=Koch responds to Bloomberg |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/koch-responds-to-bloomberg/2011/03/29/gIQA3KzNIL_blog.html |work=The Washington Post |access-date=October 5, 2011 |date=October 3, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006020013/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/koch-responds-to-bloomberg/2011/03/29/gIQA3KzNIL_blog.html |archive-date=October 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Koch Pipeline Company LP, which owns and operates {{convert|4,000|mi|km}} of pipeline used to transport oil, natural gas liquids and chemicals. Its pipelines are located across Wisconsin, Minnesota, Texas, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Alberta, Canada. The firm operates offices in Wichita, Kansas, [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], and [[Corpus Christi, Texas]].

In 1946 Wood River Oil Co. (a precursor company to Koch Industries) purchased Rock Island Oil and Refining Co. As a part of the transaction, it acquired a crude-oil pipeline in Oklahoma. As a result of construction and investments, Wood River acquired other pipelines in the US and Canada. "In the ensuing years," according to Koch Pipeline's website, "the company bought, sold and built pipeline systems transporting crude oil and refined products, as well as natural gas, natural gas liquids and [[anhydrous ammonia]] (for fertilizer)."<ref>{{cite web | title=Koch Pipeline | url=https://www.kochpipeline.com/ | publisher=Koch Industries | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018045407/https://www.kochpipeline.com/ | archive-date=October 18, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Koch Pipeline and its affiliates currently maintain a 4,000-mile network of pipelines.

In October, 1994, a pipeline broke and discharged over 90,000 gallons of crude oil into Gum Hollow Creek, in [[Refugio County, Texas]]. Heavy rains carried the oil to the [[Nueces River]] and on into Nueces and Corpus Christi Bays. The discharge oiled terrestrial and aquatic vegetation, birds, sediments, soils, and other biota. The Consent Decree was held up for some time, due to a DOJ criminal case with Koch Pipeline regarding non- and under-reporting of discharges. The criminal case was settled in March 2000 and the assessment completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/Docs/NRDAR_SiteInformation/Texas/KochGH.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-05-10 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706163830/https://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/Docs/NRDAR_SiteInformation/Texas/KochGH.pdf |archive-date=July 6, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
