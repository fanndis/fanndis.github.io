After the 2006 merger which created SIFMA, the organization had a co-[[CEO]] structure, with the SIA's Marc E. Lackritz and BMA's Micah S. Green filling the positions. As a 2007 report summarized it, "Lackritz [then 60] ha[d] been a friend, colleague and mentor of Green's [then 49] for two decades." However, with slower-than-hoped-for integration of the merged organization's operations, and with questions about the handling of executive loans by BMA, Green resigned abruptly that year and Lackritz assumed the role of sole CEO.<ref name="WP01">{{cite web | last = Birnbaum | first = Jeffrey | title = Lobby's Co-CEO Quit After Probe | work = Washington Post | date = May 7, 2007 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/16/AR2007051602427.html | accessdate = October 4, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite press release | title = Marc Lackritz Appointed CEO of SIFMA | publisher = SIFMA | date = March 29, 2007 | url = http://www.sifma.org/news/news.aspx?id=2312 | accessdate = October 18, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716151230/http://www.sifma.org/news/news.aspx?id=2312 | archive-date = 2011-07-16 | url-status = dead }}</ref>  Nine months later, Lackritz retired and Ryan was named CEO.<ref>{{Cite press release | title = Tim Ryan Appointed CEO of SIFMA | publisher = SIFMA | date = January 16, 2008 | url = http://www.sifma.org/news/news.aspx?id=1858 | accessdate = October 18, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716151453/http://www.sifma.org/news/news.aspx?id=1858 | archive-date = 2011-07-16 | url-status = dead }}</ref>
