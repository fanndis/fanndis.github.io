{{Terrorism}}
[[New Zealand]] has experienced few terrorist incidents in its short history and the threat is generally regarded as very low. However, the [[New Zealand Security Intelligence Service|Security Intelligence Service]] (SIS) has warned against complacency.<ref name="nzsis.govt.nz"/> This article serves as a list and compilation of past acts of terrorism, attempts of terrorism, and other such items pertaining to terrorist activities within New Zealand. Notable acts of terrorism include the [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior]] in 1985 (an act of [[state-sponsored terrorism]] by France), and the [[Christchurch mosque shootings]] in 2019, which killed 51 people and injured 40 others.

==Definition==

A common [[definition of terrorism]] is the "systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1= Jenkins|first1= John Philip|title= Terrorism|url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/terrorism|encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate= 7 February 2017|date= 4 August 2015}}</ref> However, unlike some other jurisdictions,<ref>

New Zealand has actually defined terrorism in an [[Act of Parliament]].

The major piece of terrorist-related legislation in New Zealand is the [[Terrorism Suppression Act 2002]].<ref name="definition">{{cite web|title= Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 No 34 (as at 04 April 2016), Public Act|url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0034/34.0/whole.html#DLM152702|website= legislation.govt.nz|publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office|accessdate= 7 February 2017|language= en-NZ}}</ref> The Act was introduced by the Government to strengthen its [[counter-terrorism]] powers, in response to the [[September 11 attacks| terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]] in the United States.<ref name="Beath1">

}}
</ref>
The Terrorism Suppression Act defines terrorism, in New Zealand or elsewhere, as an act that "is carried out for the purpose of advancing an ideological, political, or religious cause"<ref name="definition" /> and with the following intention:

# to induce terror in a civilian population; or
# to unduly compel or to force a government or an international organisation to do or abstain from doing any act.

:And if it results in one or more of the following outcomes:<ref name="definition" />
# the death of, or other serious bodily injury to, one or more persons (other than a person carrying out the act):
# a serious risk to the health or safety of a population:
# destruction of, or serious damage to, property of great value or importance, or major economic loss, or major environmental damage, if likely to result in one or more outcomes specified in points 1, 2 and 4:
# serious interference with, or serious disruption to, an infrastructure facility, if likely to endanger human life:
# introduction or release of a disease-bearing organism, if likely to devastate the national economy of a country.

Alternatively, instead of the listed outcomes, "it occurs in a situation of armed conflict and is, at the time and in the place that it occurs, in accordance with rules of international law applicable to the conflict".<ref name="definition" />

==Level of threat==
The [[New Zealand Security Intelligence Service|Security Intelligence Service]] (SIS) stated in its 2006 report that "the risk of a terrorist attack on New Zealand or New Zealand interests is low", but also warned against complacency.<ref name="nzsis.govt.nz">{{cite web|title=Report to the House of Representatives for the year ended 30 June 2006|url=http://www.nzsis.govt.nz/assets/media/annual-reports/nzsis-ar06.pdf|work=Annual Report NZSIS|publisher=New Zealand Security Intelligence Service|accessdate=7 February 2017|year=2006}}</ref> It has stated that there are individuals in New Zealand linked to international terrorism, although the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] and others have dismissed these claims.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kiwis should be sceptical Re: SIS terrorism claims|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0412/S00509.htm|accessdate=7 February 2017|publisher=scoop.co.nz|date=21 December 2004}}</ref> Once identified as a threat to New Zealand, [[Ahmed Zaoui]] became a citizen.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ahmed Zaoui a New Zealand citizen|first=Andrea|last=Vance|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/10073445/Ahmed-Zaoui-a-New-Zealand-citizen|accessdate=16 February 2019|work=Stuff|date=22 May 2014}}</ref> In another case, a man named [[Rayed Mohammed Abdullah Ali]] was deported from New Zealand after being linked to the hijacker of [[American Airlines Flight 77]] which hit the Pentagon on 11 September 2001.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Zealand deports friend of hijacker – Asia – Pacific – International Herald Tribune|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/12/world/asia/12iht-suspect.1951563.html|accessdate=7 February 2017|work=The New York Times|date=12 June 2006}}</ref>

==List of notable incidents==
Most attacks, or attempted acts, of terrorism in New Zealand have been bombings as a form of protest.<ref name="Beath-summary">{{cite web|last1=Beath|first1=Lance|title=Terrorism and counter-terrorism|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/terrorism-and-counter-terrorism|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=7 February 2017|date=20 June 2012}}</ref>

===Huntly rail bridge bombing===
{{Main|Huntly rail bridge bombing}}
On 30 April 1951, during an [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|industrial dispute]], a rail bridge was blown up near [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]], [[Waikato]]. The train drivers were warned in advance and the bombing severely disrupted coal supplies. [[Sidney Holland]], the Prime Minister of the time, called it an "infamous act of terrorism".<ref>[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/the-1951-waterfront-dispute/division-and-defeat New Zealand History online] – Division and defeat – 1951 waterfront dispute</ref> Academic Lance Beath writes that the bombing might not be considered a "terrorist" incident because there was no intent to kill or injure people and the only objective was blocking supplies.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Beath|first1=Lance|title=The historical background|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/terrorism-and-counter-terrorism/page-1|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=7 February 2017|date=20 June 2012}}</ref> 

===Vietnam War protests===
{{See also|New Zealand in the Vietnam War #Protest}}
In 1969–70 there were multiple bombings and attempted bombings of military bases and other sites related to the New Zealand military. The bombings were in protest against New Zealand's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name="Beath-summary" /> On one occasion, in 1969, four students who were protesting against the war attempted to blow up the flagpole at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]] treaty grounds,<ref name="Beath-summary" /> the site of [[Waitangi Day]] celebrations.

===Wanganui Computer Centre bombing===
{{Main|Wanganui Computer Centre bombing}}
On 18 November 1982, a [[suicide bombing|suicide bomb]] attack was made against a facility housing [[National Law Enforcement System|the main computer system]] of the [[New Zealand Police]], Courts, Ministry of Transport and other law enforcement agencies, in [[Wanganui]]. The attacker, a "punk rock" [[anarchism|anarchist]] named [[Neil Roberts (anarchist)|Neil Roberts]], was the only person killed, and the computer system was undamaged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/neil-roberts-wanganui-police-bomb|title=1982: The death of Neil Roberts}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://punkfest.orcon.net.nz/index2002.htm|title=Neil Roberts 20th Anniversary Memorial Punk Fest}}</ref>

===''Rainbow Warrior'' bombing===
{{main|Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior}}
On 10 July 1985, the [[Greenpeace]] vessel ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1978)|Rainbow Warrior]]'' was sunk by the French foreign intelligence service, the [[Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure]] (DGSE). Greenpeace had planned to use the ''Rainbow Warrior'' as part of protest efforts over French nuclear testing at [[Moruroa]], and DGSE divers sank the vessel by detonating mines against its hull while it was berthed in [[Auckland]]. The crew left the ship, but one person, [[Fernando Pereira]], was drowned when he returned to a cabin to retrieve his cameras, just before the vessel sank.<ref name="Rowell">{{cite book|last1=Rowell|first1=Andrew|title=Green Backlash: Global Subversion of the Environmental Movement|date=1996|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415128278|pages=232–234|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OtFhOGNoIHAC&pg=PA234|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=en}}</ref> 

France initially denied responsibility for the attack, but later admitted its role.<ref name="Rowell" /> Two of the French agents involved in the attack were arrested, convicted, and jailed, while several others escaped. French defence minister [[Charles Hernu]] eventually resigned over the affair.<ref name="Rowell" /> Prime Minister [[David Lange]] later referred to the sinking as "a sordid act of international state-backed terrorism."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Armstrong|first1=John|title=Reality behind the Rainbow Warrior outrage|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10333759|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=2 July 2005|language=en-NZ}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=King|first1=Michael|title=Death of the Rainbow Warrior|url=https://archive.org/details/deathofrainbowwa00king|url-access=registration|date=1986|publisher=Penguin Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/deathofrainbowwa00king/page/202 202]}}</ref>

==Counter-terrorism==
The principal government agencies responsible for countering the threat of terrorism are the [[New Zealand Police]] (who have responsibility for direct action) and the [[New Zealand Security Intelligence Service|SIS]] (who have responsibility for providing information on which action can be based). The counter-terrorism capabilities of the Police have been expanded in response to the 11 September attacks in the United States,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.police.govt.nz/advice/personal-community/counterterrorism|title=Counterterrorism|website=New Zealand Police|accessdate=3 May 2019}}</ref> and counter-terrorism also takes up a significant proportion of the SIS's budget.<ref name="nzsis.govt.nz"/> One observer has argued that New Zealand "already had in place a very comprehensive set of counter-measures" before that point.<ref>''"Before September: A History of Counter-terrorism in New Zealand"'', B.K. Greener-Barcham, 2002</ref>

===2007 anti-terror raids===
{{main|2007 New Zealand police raids}}
Seventeen people were arrested in co-ordinated raids on 15 October 2007 by Police [[Armed Offenders Squad]]s and [[Special Tactics Group]]. Those arrested included environmental activists and [[Māori people|Māori]] separatists, including noted activist [[Tame Iti]], but the raids also included roadblocks in the [[Te Urewera|Urewera]] area by armed police who searched and questioned everyone who passed through.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10470121|title=Valley locked down after dawn raids|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=16 October 2007|accessdate=16 October 2007|first=Juliet|last=Rowan}}</ref><ref name=hikoi>{{cite web | title = Anger mounts at police terror op | publisher = Stuff.co.nz | url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/4243621a10.html | date = 19 October 2007 | url-status = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5Skemn9eI?url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4243621a10.html | archivedate = 21 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}()</ref>

After lengthy legal proceedings, none of those arrested were convicted of anything more serious than violation of gun license rules under the [[Arms Act 1983|Arms Act]]. Although the search warrants used indicated that terrorism related offences were involved, no charges were laid under the 2002 Terrorism Suppression Act—with the [[Solicitor-General of New Zealand|Solicitor-General]] describing the legislation as "complex and incoherent".<ref name=nocharges>{{cite web | title = Terror legislation too complex – Collins | publisher = Stuff.co.nz | url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/4266436a25364.html | date = 9 November 2007}}</ref> Major amendments to the Act were being pushed through Parliament at the time of the raids, as well as legislation creating the charge of "participation in an organised criminal group", justified as necessary to address gang violence, a charge which was unsuccessfully applied to four of those arrested.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/17550 ''"...Within hours of Solicitor-General David Collins announcing his decision on charges under the Suppression of Terrorism Act, Parliament was debating a bill that will strengthen it..."''], 8 November 2007, stuff.co.nz</ref>
