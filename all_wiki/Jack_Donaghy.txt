'''John Francis''' "'''Jack'''" '''Donaghy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|n|ə|ɡ|iː}} {{respell|DON|ə-gee}}) is a [[fictional character]] on the [[NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[30 Rock]]'', airing from 2006 to 2013. The character was created by series creator [[Tina Fey]], and is portrayed by [[Alec Baldwin]]. He was introduced as the Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for [[General Electric]]. As Vice President, he serves as the protagonist [[Liz Lemon]]'s (Fey) boss as well as her personal mentor. As the series progresses, their relationship develops and informs their respective storylines. Donaghy climbs up the [[Corporate governance|corporate hierarchy]] to achieve his professional dream of leading General Electric as its president and chairman.

Donaghy's penchant for wealth, power, authority, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican values]], and social status has been acclaimed as a high point of the series and his characterization.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/10/30-rock-characters-ranked-anniversary-tina-fey-alec-baldwin-tracy-morgan-1201735477/|title=The 56 Most Important Characters of '30 Rock,' Ranked|last=Miller|first=Liz Shannon|date=October 11, 2016|work=IndieWire|access-date=April 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.moviefone.com/2017/04/02/jack-donaghy-30-rock-quotes/|title=16 Reasons Jack Donaghy Will Always Be the Best '30 Rock' Character|last=Horner|first=Rachael|date=April 2, 2017|work=Moviefone|access-date=April 26, 2018|language=en}}</ref> Fey intended for the character to serve as an oppositional but complementary counter to Lemon, expressed through various gender, social, and power dynamics.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/30-rock-character-study-why-416807|title='30 Rock' Character Study: Why Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin's Friendship-With-Benefits Worked|last=Carlson|first=Erin|date=January 31, 2013|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=April 26, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Baldwin received two [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], three [[Golden Globe Awards]], seven [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and one [[Television Critics Association Award]] for his portrayal of this character.

== Storylines and characteristics ==
John Francis Donaghy had an unhappy and impoverished childhood in [[South Boston]] and in the fictional suburb of Sadchester, [[Massachusetts]]. When he was two, Jack's presumed father lured him to the edge of a swimming pool with a puppy and pushed him in the pool, and later abandoned his family. His mother Colleen Murphy Donaghy has nagged him his whole life, even blaming him for [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[John F. Kennedy assassination|death]] and for his father leaving. However, she was also devoted to her children. For example, it was noted that she had traded sexual favors with (the fictional) [[F.A.O. Schwarz|Frederick August Otto Schwarz III]] for [[Christmas]] presents for Jack and his siblings. Young Jack took to calling his [[collie]] "Pop" until the dog was accidentally run over by the mailman and intentionally left to die in the street by his mother. The dog had earlier been neutered, causing Jack to charge his mother with "cutting Pop's balls off." His mother even tried to send him to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] when he was 12 to make a man out of him. He also played [[hockey]], the piano and the [[flute]] as a child, prompting his mother to embarrass him by having him play "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" on said flute in front of the hockey team, which he also captained.

Due to his family's poverty, Donaghy began working at the age of 12, as a [[stevedore]] at the [[Port of Boston]]. He attended [[Princeton University]] on a handsomeness scholarship,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Irwin |first1=Neil |title=Management lessons from Jack Donaghy |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/management-lessons-from-jack-donaghy/2012/10/05/93cab868-0dad-11e2-a310-2363842b7057_story.html |accessdate=9 March 2020 |work=Washington Post |date=October 6, 2012}}</ref> where he played football and baseball for the [[Princeton Tigers|Tigers]], joined the [[Princeton Charter Club]], played Maria in an all-male production of ''[[West Side Story]]'', was a member of the "Twig and Plums" secret society, and was a classmate of [[Michelle Obama]]. In addition to the [[Amory Blaine]] Handsomeness Scholarship, his jobs during college included "the day shift at a graveyard, and the graveyard shift for the [[Days Inn]]"; working as a janitor at a primate laboratory; and a job for the linguistics department recording every word in the English language, to preserve the perfect American accent in case of [[nuclear war]].  He laments that his voice has been dragged into various things like ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine]]'' and [[Wu-Tang Clan]] songs. (This joke refers to Alec Baldwin's role as a storyteller for ''[[Thomas and Friends]]'' in the U.S., seasons 5 and 6. He was also cast in the role of Mr. Conductor in ''[[Thomas and the Magic Railroad]]'' in 2000.) Subsequently, the linguistics department sold his voice to GE for use in their microwaves.  He later attended [[Harvard Business School]], which he paid for by working as a [[Swan Boats (Boston, Massachusetts)|Swan Boat]] operator, and where he was voted "Most" by his classmates.

Post-college, Jack worked as an intern for [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Ted Kennedy]], where Jack displayed an extremely liberal political world-view, even by the standards of a young [[Al Gore]]. At some point, though as yet unexplained, he underwent a complete reversal of his philosophy and became a [[conservative]] [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]]. Jack participated in [[Hands Across America]] and at some point personally coined the phrase "what's the upside?" He confessed that [[Carly Simon]]'s 1972 hit song "[[You're So Vain]]" was, in fact, written by him.

In the years after working for Kennedy, Jack "thrived" on fear, bow hunting [[polar bear]]s, climbing [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], once driving a rental car into the [[Hudson River]] to practice escaping, showering with [[Greta Van Susteren]] and overcoming a [[peanut allergy]] through sheer willpower. Jack once practiced [[martial arts]] under [[Chuck Norris]], but they had a falling out after he switched to another [[dojo]].

It is revealed in "[[Live from Studio 6H]]" that, as a young employee in the GE poisons division in 1986, Jack answered phones during a live telethon. During that broadcast, [[Tracy Jordan]] realized his talent for getting laughs as a performer. A 16-year-old [[Liz Lemon]] made a prank call, claiming to have been a nurse in the war who was impregnated by General Electric when he was ''Colonel'' Electric. Jack's loyalty to GE and his handsomeness impressed Don Geiss, who transferred Jack to the microwave ovens division. At some point, he also rotated through GE's plastics division, where he befriended the "brilliant plastics engineer / lesbian", [[List of 30 Rock characters#Gretchen Thomas|Gretchen Thomas]]. After years of [[market research]], he finally made his "greatest triumph" in the form of the [[Trivection oven]], a product he created at [[General Electric]], having first envisioned it while responding to Liz Lemon's prank call in 1986. It was on the strengths of the Trivection oven that, in mid-2006, he replaced recently deceased Gary to become Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming.

Jack was the architect of bringing [[Tracy Jordan]] on board the [[NBC]] sketch show ''The Girlie Show'', despite the objections of head writer /creator [[Liz Lemon]] and producer [[Pete Hornberger]]. Jack made sure that Tracy was the main star and ensured the show's name was changed to ''[[TGS with Tracy Jordan]]'' after [[bribery|bribing]] a [[focus group]] with [[pizza]].

Jack's mother still constantly calls him and she wants to move in with him, away from her [[retirement home]] in [[Jupiter, Florida]], which has rocks made of foam because she tends to fall down a lot. However, at the end of the episode, he [[blackmail]]s [[Josh Girard]] into taking all his mother's calls for him for the rest of Josh's life (Jack says that his mother will outlive Josh - "she's like [[Fidel Castro|Castro]]"), since Josh has a flawless "Jack Donaghy" impersonation. In the wake of the episode "[[Fireworks (30 Rock episode)|Fireworks]]," Jack is demoted to Vice President of East Coast Television when CEO Don Geiss takes his microwave oven programming duties away from him, although a comment to Liz suggests that it may have been given back to him. At some point, he wrote a book entitled ''Jack Attack: The Art of Aggression in Business''.

Acting on Don Geiss' advice, Jack gets engaged to [[Christie's]] auctioneer [[List of 30 Rock characters#Phoebe|Phoebe]]. However, Liz later discovers that Phoebe is actually an unscrupulous gold digger who is pretending to be English. Jack refuses to believe this since Phoebe had told him that Liz is infatuated with him and he decides to continue with their wedding. The situation is resolved when Jack has a [[heart attack]] while in bed with Phoebe, and realizes while recovering in the hospital during a conversation with Liz, Phoebe and his mother that he is in fact not in love with Phoebe. During this conversation, Jack's mother uses his heart monitor as a lie detector. Jack recovers from his heart attack and becomes a candidate to succeed Don Geiss as CEO of GE, competing against his arch-rival, Vice-President of West Coast Television [[List of 30 Rock characters#Devon Banks|Devon Banks]], who, despite being openly [[gay]], has gotten engaged to Geiss' oblivious daughter [[List of 30 Rock characters#Kathy Geiss|Kathy]]. Jack momentarily wins the coveted job of Geiss' replacement, only to lose it when Geiss slips into a [[diabetes|diabetic]] [[coma]]. Banks makes a power grab, convincing the board of directors that the CEO's seat should stay with the family and getting his fiancée Kathy appointed, with Banks as the power behind the throne. Jack is demoted and humiliated, and leaves GE for a position in [[George W. Bush]]'s [[George W. Bush administration|administration]]. This proves to be hopeless, and Jack attempts to get himself fired. He succeeds this by funding a "[[gay bomb]]," a weapon that would cause enemy soldiers to "go totally gaybones for each other."  The [[chemical warfare]] is accidentally released in a secret war bunker, and it is implied that Jack has sex with [[Dick Cheney]]. This implication is furthered when Jack later confesses his sins to an ill-prepared priest.

Jack starts out again at GE — in the mailroom. He works his way up to the top again in amazingly rapid fashion, however. Jack contemplates sleeping with Kathy Geiss to save the company from Banks' plan to shut GE down completely for two years, but is able to avoid this with Liz's help. In the end, Kathy signs a contract making Jack her main business advisor, and Banks takes off. Don Geiss emerges from his coma shortly thereafter, but stuns Jack with the news that he has decided to stay on as GE's chairman after all. Jack remains in his position as head of NBC, telling Liz Lemon how many times an episode she can use the phrase "cat anus". Jack discovers that Jimmy Donaghy is not his real father. Similar to the plot of ''[[Mamma Mia!|Mamma Mia]]'', Jack finds that he has three possible fathers. Liz invites them to ''TGS'' saying they won a contest, and Jack quickly finds that his father is Milton Greene, a [[Bennington College]] professor. Getting in an argument with Milton about politics, he says to Liz that he does not want to tell Milton, but Liz convinces him otherwise. After Jack tells Milton that he is Milton's son, Milton tells Jack he needs a [[kidney]] or he will die. Jack finds that he is not a match and organizes a "[[We Are the World]]"-type charity called "Kidney Now," with celebrities singing a song that asks anyone who is a match to give Milton a kidney. One of the celebrities, [[Elvis Costello]], ultimately proves to be a match and saves Milton's life himself.

Devon Banks comes back at Jack with a revenge plan involving the United States government trying to shut down GE. Jack is able to get out of it, however. Jack is described by his assistant [[List of 30 Rock characters#Jonathan|Jonathan]] as being the "best gift giver in the world." One year, Jonathan bought Jack a $95 bottle of [[olive oil]] for Christmas and in return Jack had Jonathan's sister released from a [[North Korea]]n jail. When Liz and Jack finally agree to exchange gifts, they agree on spending zero dollars for each other (with both trying to one-up the other). Jack has Jonathan drive all over [[Pennsylvania]] to find a program of Liz's production of ''[[The Crucible]]'', framed in wood from her stage and not reimbursing Jonathan for gas. Liz calls in a bomb threat at [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] (getting [[Frank Rossitano|Frank]], [[Toofer Spurlock|Toofer]], and [[J.D. Lutz|Lutz]] arrested in the process) to keep Jack's high school crush, [[List of 30 Rock characters#Nancy Donovan|Nancy]], in town. Finally, Jack brings in Liz's childhood crush, [[Larry Wilcox]] (in-costume as [[CHiPs|Jon Baker]]), as a date for her.

Donaghy's goal is to lead "the General" and become CEO of General Electric, like his mentors Geiss and [[Jack Welch]]. This appears to become impossible in 2010 when he learns from his girlfriend [[List of 30 Rock characters#Avery Jessup-Donaghy|Avery]] that [[Comcast NBC merger|Philadelphia-based cable company Kabletown has bought NBC]] from GE. At first, Jack doubts the story because he hasn't heard anything, but then he finds out from Welch that the sale is happening and that Geiss is dead. Jack connects with an old colleague from GE who left to join Kabletown, and discovers that NBC's new owners don't make anything, they get over 90% of their revenue from men ordering porn on demand. This worries Jack, until he has an idea for Kabletown to create "porn for women," essentially women paying to have men on their TV screens listen to them talk and nod approvingly.

Still, Jack is less than satisfied at Kabletown, in large part because the company manufactures no tangible goods. He misses his days developing products and visiting factory floors during his tenures in GE's poisons, plastics, and microwave ovens divisions. He attempts to remedy his malaise by convincing Kabletown's chairman, [[List of 30 Rock characters#Hank Hooper|Hank Hooper]], to increase corporate synergy by establishing a subsidiary, Kouchtown to manufacture couches and market them to NBC's & Kabletown's viewers. Comically sub-par American craftsmanship and production values, however, doom his initiative. He is able to recover some of the investment by selling the otherwise unmarketable to the [[United States Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] as torture devices; doing so serendipitously benefits Jack when one of the couches causes an interrogated [[North Korea]]n to reveal information vital to Avery's rescue.

Through triple-dealing and misdirection that put [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] to shame, Jack manages to finally dispatch his precocious young nemesis, [[List of 30 Rock characters#Kaylie Hooper|Kaylie Hooper]] on her grandfather's ("Poppop"'s) birthday and secure the appointment to Kabletown's chairmanship from the retiring Hank. Despite his substantially increased power, wealth, and the hatred from liberals, Jack finds himself even less content than he was prior to the Kouchtown fiasco. After a quick series of innovations at the start of his chairmanship (appointing NBC's ultimately [[Kenneth Parcell|longest-serving president]], effectively eliminating Kabletown's worthless Indian customer service call centre to provide the same service at zero cost, and introducing GE's ''[[Six Sigma]]'' process in place of Kabletown's kitten in spaghetti), Jack abruptly resigns and sets off to sail the world alone in search of happiness. His trip succeeds within a matter of seconds; having barely left the riverbank, he  conceives of his greatest innovation: transparent dishwashers that allow the consumer to observe the cleaning action. Within months, he has sold the idea to his former employer, General Electric, and finds himself in his lifelong dream job: chairman of GE.

Despite Jack's belief in the value of change and innovation, he is obsessed with his preferred office design and recreates it wherever he goes. When he takes over as NBC's Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Programming, he orders the late Gary's former office to be immediately remodelled. For a week-long junket to [[Boston]] to visit Nancy, Jack uses an "office replication service" to recreate the interior design for his temporary workspace at [[WHDH (TV)|the local affiliate]]'s studios and is surprised that Liz has not done likewise. When he executive produces ''Kidnapped by Danger: The Avery Jessup Story, brought to you with limited commercial interruptions by Pride Bladder Control Pants. Pride: Make every room a bathroom'', he ensures that his office is meticulously recreated on-set for an accurate depiction. Upon moving upstairs as the new chairman of Kabletown (eschewing Kabletown's primary headquarters in [[Philadelphia]], Jack has Hank Hooper's former suite remodelled to perfectly duplicate the office which Jack had left to Kenneth, the only differences being the greater exterior view, more assistants in the anteroom, and a Kabletown sign behind one assistant's desk. Months later, as chairman of General Electric, he likewise remodels [[List of 30 Rock characters#Kathy Geiss|Kathy Geiss]]' former suite into yet another duplicate, with the GE logo behind the same assistant's desk in the anteroom.

===Relationships===
Long before the events of the series, Jack had married an [[Italian people|Italian]] woman named [[List of 30 Rock characters#Bianca|Bianca]] ([[Isabella Rossellini]]), with whom he made love on the floor of the [[Concorde]] shortly after their wedding, though he claims his mother deliberately had a [[heart attack]] to prevent him from going on his [[honeymoon]]. He and Bianca were eventually [[legal separation|legally separated]] in 1989 because, in his words, he "couldn't keep up with her on any level." Though they weren't legally [[divorce]]d, Jack went on to introduce Bianca as though they were. When Bianca shows up, Jack passes Liz off as his girlfriend to make Bianca jealous. When Liz pretends Jack has proposed to her, Bianca attacks her and Jack is finally satisfied that Bianca still wants him. The couple finally officially divorce after 18 years of legal separation. Jack acquires "full stake in the [[Arby's]] franchises [he and Bianca] bought outside of [[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]]" in the divorce settlement.

Jack had a brief relationship with [[List of 30 Rock characters#Phoebe|Phoebe]] ([[Emily Mortimer]]), an allegedly English auctioneer, and goes as far as proposing marriage. Even after Liz discovers that Phoebe is a gold-digger, it is only during a heart-attack-causing argument with his mother Colleen that Jack realizes that he does not love Phoebe, and calls off the engagement at the end of Season 1.

Jack begins a relationship with liberal [[United States House of Representatives|Congresswoman]] [[List of 30 Rock characters#C. C.|Celeste "CC" Cunningham]] ([[Edie Falco]]). In spite of their ideological differences, they are a well-matched pair and, after a period of secrecy, eventually go public. Their bliss does not last long, as their long-distance relationship begins to negatively affect both their jobs, and they break up.

After accidentally breaking both of his mother's hips, Jack is forced to allow her to move in with her. He hires an attractive [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] nurse, [[List of 30 Rock characters#Elisa Pedrera|Elisa Padriera]] ([[Salma Hayek]]), to care for his mother. Jack falls in love with Elisa and proposes marriage to her. Later, after Elisa confesses to murdering her former husband, they choose to not marry.
[[File:Elizabeth Banks 2012 Shankbone 4.JPG|left|thumb|[[Elizabeth Banks]] portrays [[List of 30 Rock characters#Avery Jessup-Donaghy|Avery Jessup]]]]
Jack has a reunion with [[List of 30 Rock characters#Nancy Donovan|Nancy Doherty (née Donovan)]] ([[Julianne Moore]]), his old high school crush. He is torn between her and his new flame, CNBC anchor [[List of 30 Rock characters#Avery Jessup-Donaghy|Avery Jessup]] ([[Elizabeth Banks]]). After having sex with Nancy, he confesses that he is in love with both Nancy and another woman. Avery and Nancy meet by chance, and Nancy discovers that Avery is pregnant. Nancy is the one who tells Jack. Unbeknownst to Avery, Liz and Jack are accidentally married to each other in the Caribbean. The officiant whom Jack and Avery had hired for their wedding did not speak English and in due course honestly mistook Liz for the bride because she answered his request for a vow of commitment "oui" while wearing a white tennis dress and a white mosquito net (her clothes having been lost in an luggage mishap) and standing next to Jack at the altar (as best man after [[Robert Ballard|Bob Ballard]] failed to make it). Liz uses the situation to blackmail Jack into restoring ''TGS''{{'}}s budget, in exchange for signing the annulment documents and ceasing to give his [legally ''their''] money away to fund projects like The Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, The Arts, and Feelings. With Jack and Avery properly married, their daughter is born while in [[Canada]] (despite their efforts to cross the border and ensure she is born in America so she will be [[United States Constitution|constitutionally]] eligible to become [[President of the United States|President]]). Despite Avery's concerns about the closeness of Jack and Liz's mentor-protégé relationship, the couple name their daughter Elizabeth Donaghy. They, however, call her "Liddy" as an honor to [[Elizabeth Dole|Elizabeth "Liddy" Dole]], [[G. Gordon Liddy]], and Jack's martial arts teacher, Lih De. Their [[pediatrician]] is, by unhappy coincidence, named [[Jack Kevorkian|Dr. Kevorkian]].  Avery is kidnapped and held hostage in [[North Korea]].  While Avery is held captive, Jack finds consolation in Avery's mother, [[List of 30 Rock characters#Guest characters|Diana]]. The two end up sharing a kiss in the days before Avery returns home. Jack never masturbates during Avery's absence, as he claims to have never "Mommy Daddy sheet monstered" himself. Avery returns to the United States in exchange for a North Korean spy, Jack having unwittingly facilitated the exchange when he sold horribly uncomfortable Kouchtown couches to the [[United States Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] as interrogation tools. Jack and Avery plan to renew their vows but eventually divorce each other because of Jack's relationship with Avery's mother and Avery's relationship with Scott Scottsman, a fellow former captive. Jack also admits that he and Avery only married because of Avery's pregnancy.

After his marriage ends, Jack settles into a pattern of casual sexual relationships, including dating several women at once, each to fulfill a different need — including heiress [[Sbarro|Pizzarina Sbarro]] ([[Nina Arianda]]) —  which he calls "[[The Great Escape (film)|Great Escaping]]". He also admits to Liz that he slept with Jenna "a lot" in Season 3. In the series finale, He reconnects with ex-girlfriends Nancy and Elisa, convincing them to embark in a group relationship despite both women's devout Catholicism and Elisa's imprisonment in a Puerto Rican prison.

==Personality==
In a 2008 interview  with ''[[Playboy]]'', as well in various other interviews, [[Tina Fey]] has said that Jack Donaghy is inspired by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' creator and showrunner [[Lorne Michaels]]. In a different interview on [[NPR]]'s "[[Wait Wait Don't Tell Me]]", Baldwin stated some of his inspiration for Donaghy was drawn from Michaels.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_IQQkfyhwk Unscripted with Alec Baldwin and Tina Fey] – 1:56-2:38. Retrieved September 5, 2010</ref>

Despite being brilliant and slick, Jack is portrayed as a scrupulous network executive with an affinity for overtly backhanded compliments which are usually directed towards ''TGS'' head writer [[Liz Lemon]] (whom he refers to by her surname more often than not). Although his first priority is to run a successful business, Jack often shows a human side, as when he doesn't fire [[Kenneth Parcell]] after beating him at [[poker]] when Kenneth bet his job, or when he rushes to take Liz home after oral surgery despite being with his then girlfriend, Avery. He has made it clear that he respects Liz's abilities and considers her a friend, albeit by calling for her advice at odd times. He briefly tried to develop a friendly relationship with the writers, particularly Liz, and made it clear that his feelings were hurt when Liz told him to stay out of the writers' room (although he apparently couldn't let go of his pride to say this directly).

However, he still has distinct personality flaws. For example, he changes the name of ''The Girlie Show'' without consulting Liz and then refuses to tell Jenna that Liz had nothing to do with it, because he thinks Liz needs to learn how to handle her employees. After discovering that a product he helped create for Tracy Jordan was dangerous, he decides to sell it overseas to get around U.S. safety regulations. At the very least, however, he said he admired Tracy's integrity for choosing to back out of the enterprise.

Nevertheless, Jack remains close enough to his NBC coworkers to attend their social functions. In asking Avery to be his "plus+one" at the wedding of ''TGS'' receptionist [[List of 30 Rock characters#Cerie|Cerie Xerox]], Jack notes "You do not want to miss this wedding, it's going to be New York royalty: the [[Astor family|Astors]], the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], the [[Sbarro]]s," to which a delighted Avery replies "I know Jack. You think I don't want to know what Pizzerina Sbarro is going to be wearing?" <ref>http://www.tvfanatic.com/quotes/the-astors-the-rockefellers-the-sbarros-i-know-jack-you-th/#ixzz25cVggd00 reviewed Sept 5, 2012.</ref>
[[File:President Reagan poses at the White House 1984.jpg|thumb|239x239px|An icon among [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] is regarded to Jack as a spiritual leader akin to [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].]]
Jack is a conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] (initially supporting [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008|Mitt Romney]]). Jack idolizes [[Ronald Reagan]] who, prior to holding elected office, had been a corporate spokesman for [[General Electric]] and host of the [[General Electric Theater]]. However, contrary to some conservative stereotypes, he apparently has no issue with [[homosexuality]]; he sets up Liz Lemon on a date with his [[lesbian]] friend, [[List of 30 Rock characters#Gretchen Thomas|Gretchen Thomas]], and [[List of 30 Rock characters#Devon Banks|Devon Banks]]' homosexuality is immaterial to Jack's intense loathing of, and rivalry with, him; Jack considers Devon to be the "gay me". Jack himself participated in a gay orgy under the influence of nerve agent being developed for a "gay bomb" during his brief tenure in the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]. He convinces Hank Hooper to purchase the gay-themed network, TWINKS, and attempts to run it. Jack speaks disparagingly of most demographics; his mockery of Northern liberals and Southern conservatives in the same sentence in "[[Stone Mountain (30 Rock)|Stone Mountain]]" prompts Liz to remark, "Wow, you just don't like anyone, do you?" Despite his supposedly Conservative values, in the episode [[Greenzo]], former Vice President [[Al Gore]] reveals that Jack was once an intern for [[Ted Kennedy]] and started to describe him as "the most liberal" before being cut off by Jack.

Jack is ostensibly [[Irish Catholic]],<ref>Jack's statement to Tracy in "[[The Fighting Irish]]"</ref> and names his fists after [[St. Patrick]] and [[St. Michael]] (though he later states that he "has no faith, only capitalism"). He is a firm believer in [[capitalism]], stating that "business [[orgasm|gets me off]]", and that [[negotiation (process)|negotiation]] is his favorite thing in the world since it is, in his words, "the essence of capitalism." Jack's business background clashed with the show's staff when he insisted on having the show use [[product placement]] (or "product integration" as he calls it).  Citing ''[[Six Sigma]]'', Jack has also tried to involve himself with the staff. Much to Liz' annoyance, he has even tried to "help" her with issues in her personal life, his reasoning that the quality of her life will reflect the quality of her work. He starts his own [[winery]], "Donaghy Estates", after purchasing a [[vineyard]] on the north fork of [[Long Island]]. Despite the wine being reviewed in ''[[Robert M. Parker, Jr.|Robert Parker]]'s Wine Newsletter'' as tasting like "the [[urine]] of [[Satan]] after a hefty portion of [[asparagus]]," he attempts to market it to the [[hip-hop]] community as a replacement for [[Cristal (champagne)#Rap controversy|Cristal champagne]].

Jack dyes his hair and has it cut every two days (he declares that "your hair is your head-suit"), and is shown to be very formal. So far, he has almost always appeared on the show in suits and he considers [[tuxedo]]s appropriate evening wear for any occasion ("It's after six.  What am I, a farmer?"). In contrast, Liz and the other writers wear casual clothing most of the time and appear generally laid-back. Liz suggests that Jack finds [[Asian people|Asian women]] in their twenties especially attractive, though he has intimate relationships with women of other races including African-American [[List of 30 Rock characters#Condoleezza Rice|Condoleezza Rice]], Puerto Rican [[List of 30 Rock characters#Elisa Pedrera|Elisa Pedrera]] and numerous Caucasians. He appears to agree with the other Kabletown executives that the most desirable [[trophy wife|trophy wives]] are half-Asian women. Jack collected cookie jars and displayed them at conventions using the alias "Victor Nightingale", but gave his collection to Kenneth when a [[private investigator]] told him that it could hurt his chances at getting Don Geiss's job as Chairman of GE.

According to Liz, Jack "goes to [[Sbarro]] when he's angry, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] when he's horny, and [[Christie's]] when he's [[clinical depression|depressed]]." He states in an ''NBC Business News'' interview that the individuals first on his speed dial are [[Warren Buffett]] on his [[BlackBerry]] and [[Jimmy Buffett]] on his [[iPhone]]. Jack is a talented painter and flautist, and can also do a [[backflip (acrobatic)|backflip]], which he states is "90% confidence." Jack has also expressed an interest in science and admits that as a child he wanted to be a [[marine biology|marine biologist]] until his father discouraged him.

Though several characters on the show are portrayed as high-functioning [[alcoholism|alcoholics]], Jack appears to be the only one who is chemically dependent on alcohol. This is evidenced by the fact that he experiences physical withdrawal symptoms when he attempts to stop drinking. Jack also appears to be an opportunistic [[substance abuse]]r, given that, in various episodes, he drinks Kenneth's cough syrup in lieu of alcohol, sniffs paint (and Jenna's breath) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms, scoffs at the notion of sober air travel, takes mysterious purple pills offered to him by Dr. Spaceman, and is shown on the cover of a 1985 GE Quarterly Newsletter claiming that a wheelbarrow full of [[cocaine]] was just out of view. While trying to adjust to life as a housewife, Liz finally realises that Jack did not have everything figured out and was "just an alcoholic with a great voice."

==Family==
The Donaghys come from [[Counties of Ireland|County Steve, Ireland]], where they were "whiskey testers and [[goblin]]s." The family dispute how to pronounce their surname, with some pronouncing it as "Donag-ee", "Dona-hee" or even "Dona-fee". Jack's very eccentric family sees much drama and infighting, and includes:

*Jimmy Donaghy ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|n|ə|f|iː}}, {{respell|DON|ə-fee}}; [[Brian Murray (actor)|Brian Murray]])<ref>first name revealed in episode "Goodbye, My Friend"</ref> – Jack's father is closely allied with Eddie. Jack considers both of them a disgrace to the Donaghy name (which they both pronounce differently from Jack and each other). Jack also believes his father belongs in the "Smiling Irish Bastard Hall of Fame".<ref>episode "Rosemary's Baby"</ref> It is later revealed that Jimmy is not Jack's biological father, as he was absent when Jack was conceived. Jack's mother had a sexual relationship with a man named Milton Green during this time, making him Jack's biological father.
*[[List of 30 Rock characters#Colleen Donaghy|Colleen Donaghy]] ([[Elaine Stritch]]) – Jack's overbearing mother who lives in a [[Florida]] retirement home; her [[maiden name]] was Murphy, a family Jack considers to be "a bunch of mud farmers and [[bestiality|sheep rapists]]".<ref>episode "The Source Awards"</ref> Despite Colleen being overbearing she actually likes Liz Lemon. She mistook Liz for Jack's fiancée, which was actually Phoebe; when Jack told her that it wasn't Liz whom he was marrying, Colleen's response was "Why the hell not?"
*Eddie Donaghy ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|n|ə|h|iː}}, {{respell|DON|ə-hee}}; [[Nathan Lane]]) – Jack's brother with whom he's been in constant rivalry for years and who apparently works as a [[confidence trick|swindler]]. It is revealed that they both played very harsh tricks on each other during their childhood, such as Eddie blinding Jack with a bottle rocket, and Jack [[microwave|microwaving]] Eddie's [[parakeet]]. He also thinks that Liz could be "pretty...if [she] didn't scowl so much."
*Patrick Donaghy ([[Boris McGiver]]) – another brother.
*Patricia Donaghy ([[Siobhan Fallon Hogan|Siobhan Fallon]]) – Jack's sister.
*Katherine Catherine Donaghy ([[Molly Shannon]]) – Jack's other sister; married to a man named Bobby.
*Margaret (Alice Kremelberg) – a teenage relative seen sitting silently and scowling through the family reunion; she is implied to be his illegitimate sister, but it is also mentioned that she "certainly has Mom's smile." Her grin seems to imply that she enjoys when her new-found family fights.
* [[Tim Donaghy]] – Jack's cousin, a former [[NBA]] referee who bet on, and/or fixed, professional basketball games.
*[[List of 30 Rock characters#Milton Greene|Milton Green]] ([[Alan Alda]]) - Jack's affable biological father. Milton is a professor at [[Bennington College]], and in desperate need of a new kidney when they first meet. Jack mounts a celebrity event to find Green a kidney. He subsequently receives one from [[Elvis Costello]]. Milton is a stereotypically liberal Vermont resident and a devotee of [[Jimmy Carter]], on whom he is writing a multi-volume biography; this causes the conservative Jack no end of embarrassment and consternation. [[Betty White]] reads at least one volume.
*Spider-Man Green - Milton Green's son and Jack's half-brother. He named himself, a tradition in Milton's family at which both Jack and Avery scoff.
*[[List of 30 Rock characters#Avery Jessup-Donaghy|Avery Jessup]] ([[Elizabeth Banks]]) - Jack's ex-wife and mother to their daughter, Liddy. She is kidnapped to [[North Korea]] and involuntarily married to [[Kim Jong-un]]. Avery was the First Lady of North Korea from 29 December 2011 until 10 May 2012. Avery returns to the United States in exchange for a North Korean spy. Jack and Avery plan to renew their vows, but eventually divorce each other because of Jack's relationship with Avery's mother and Avery's relationship with Scott Scottsman, a fellow former captive. Jack also admits that he and Avery got married because of their baby.
*Elizabeth "Liddy" Donaghy - Jack's Canadian-American daughter whom he sired with Avery. She is called Liddy in honour of [[Elizabeth Dole|Liddy Dole]], [[G. Gordon Liddy]], and Jack's martial arts instructor Li Di. Jack trains her to say his trademark, "Good God, Lemon," and she attends baby leadership conferences.
*[[Liz Lemon|Elizabeth "Liz" Lemon]] [briefly '[[Liz Lemon|Elizabeth Donaghy]]']<ref>Liz uses the Donaghy surname when establishing The Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, The Arts, and Feelings in "[[Mrs. Donaghy]]".</ref> ([[Tina Fey]]) - Jack's accidental ex-wife to whom he is technically married when the officiant of his and Avery's wedding mistook Liz as the bride because she was wearing tennis whites and a mosquito net. In the course of a feud between them during their brief marriage, Liz holds a press conference (dressed as [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] and impersonating Drew Barrymore's impression of [[Edith Bouvier Beale|"Little Edie" Beale]]) and announces that she and Jack have donated $5 million to The Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, The Arts, and Feelings. During a meeting with NBC human resource mediator [[List of 30 Rock characters#Jeffrey Weinerslav|Jeffrey Weinerslav]], the two realize that they have had the longest and most meaningful relationship either of them has ever had, and apologize to each other with Liz agreeing to sign the annulment papers and Jack promising to restore ''TGS''’s budget.

==Celebrity love interests==
Before his marriage, Jack usually dated women who are [[celebrity|celebrities]] or powerful figures in the media. Often, he hints that he is having or has had a relationship with them, but it is rarely explicitly stated. These women include:

* [[Greta Van Susteren]], journalist (implied in "[[Jack-Tor]]" that Jack "showered with" her, before her head transplant)
* [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[U.S. Secretary of State]] (possibly alluded to in "[[Pilot (30 Rock)|Pilot]]"; implied in "[[The Break Up (30 Rock episode)|The Break Up]]"; confirmed in "[[The Source Awards (30 Rock episode)|The Source Awards]]" and "[[Everything Sunny All the Time Always]]")

* [[Nikki Finke]], journalist (mentioned in "[[Alexis Goodlooking and the Case of the Missing Whisky]]")
