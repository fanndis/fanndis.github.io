The '''U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary''', also called the '''House Judiciary Committee''', is a [[Standing committee (United States Congress)|standing committee]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. It is charged with overseeing the [[administration of justice]] within the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]], administrative agencies and Federal law enforcement entities. The Judiciary Committee is also the committee responsible for [[impeachment]]s of federal officials. Because of the legal nature of its oversight, committee members usually have a legal background, but this is not required.

In the [[116th Congress]], the chairman of the committee is [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Jerrold Nadler|Jerry Nadler]] of [[New York (state)|New York]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Estepa|first1=Jessica|title=Rep. Jerrold Nadler takes over as top Democrat on House Judiciary|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/11/29/rep-jerrold-nadler-takes-over-top-democrat-house-judiciary/907341001/|access-date=5 December 2017|newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=November 29, 2017}}</ref> and the ranking minority member is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Jim Jordan (American politician)|Jim Jordan]] of [[Ohio]].

== History ==
{{United States House of Representatives}}
The committee was created on June 3, 1813<ref>https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1800-1850/The-creation-of-the-Judiciary-Comm-1813_June_1/</ref> for the purpose of considering legislation related to the [[judicial system]]. This committee approved articles of impeachment against Presidents in four instances: [[impeachment of Andrew Johnson|Andrew Johnson]] (1867 and 1868), [[impeachment process against Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon]] (1974), [[impeachment of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton]] (1998), and [[impeachment process against Donald Trump|Donald Trump]] (2019).

In the [[115th Congress]], the chairman of the committee was [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Bob Goodlatte]] of [[Virginia]], and the ranking minority member was initially [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[John Conyers]] of [[Michigan]]. On November 26, 2017, Conyers stepped down from his position as ranking member, while he faced an ethics investigation.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wilkinson |first=Tracy |date=November 26, 2017 |title=Rep.

In the [[116th Congress]], the House flipped from Republican to Democratic control. [[Doug Collins (politician)|Doug Collins]], a Republican from [[Georgia's 9th congressional district]], became ranking member and served from 2019 to 2020. In early 2020, Collins stepped down from his leadership position when he became a candidate in the [[2020–21 United States Senate special election in Georgia|2020 special election held to replace retiring Georgia Senator]] [[Johnny Isakson]]. Under House Republican rules, members must relinquish leadership positions if they launch a bid for another office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/481933-jim-jordan-selected-to-replace-doug-collins-on-judiciary-committee|title=House Republicans move Jordan to Judiciary, Meadows to Oversight|date=2020-02-06|last=Beavers|first=Olivia|last2=Brufke|first2=Juliegrace|website=The Hill|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref> Collins was succeeded as ranking member by [[Jim Jordan (American politician)|Jim Jordan]], who represents [[Ohio's 4th congressional district]].

== Task forces ==
=== Antitrust Task Force: 108th Congress ===
Chairman: [[Jim Sensenbrenner]] (R-WI); Ranking member: [[John Conyers]] (D-MI)

The Antitrust Task Force during the 108th Congress existed from March 26, 2003, to September 26, 2003. All Judiciary Committee Members also served as members of the Task Force,<ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/committeestructure.aspx?committee=2 Judiciary Task Force on Antitrust]</ref> and conducted hearings and investigations into consolidation of the [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]] Companies.<ref>[http://www.antitrustreview.com/archives/864 House Antitrust Task Force], [http://www.antitrustreview.com/ Antitrust Review.com]</ref>

=== Antitrust Task Force: 110th Congress ===
Chairman: [[John Conyers]] (D-MI); Ranking member: [[Steve Chabot]] (R-OH)

The Antitrust Task Force during the 110th Congress was established February 28, 2007, as a temporary subcommittee to examine the pending [[merger]] between [[XM Radio]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]].<ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/newscenter.aspx?A=770 Anti-Trust Panel to Examine XM-Sirius Merger] United States House Committee on the Judiciary Press Release, February 27, 2007</ref> The task force operated like any other subcommittee, except that it only has a six-month term. House Rules limit each full committee to just five subcommittees, and any task force, special subcommittee, or other subunit of a standing committee that is established for a cumulative period longer than six months in a Congress counts against that total.<ref>[http://rules.house.gov/ruleprec/110th.pdf Rules of the House of Representatives], Rule X(b)(C), Page 12</ref> A longer term for the task force would cause the Judiciary Committee to exceed this limit.
