'''Human rights in Cuba''' are under the scrutiny of human rights organizations, which accuse the [[Cuba]]n government of committing systematic human rights abuses against the Cuban people, including [[arbitrary imprisonment]] and unfair trials.<ref name="hrw1999" /><ref>{{cite web|date=April 7, 1967 |url=http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/Cuba67sp/indice.htm |title=Information about human rights in Cuba |publisher=Comision Interamericana de Derechos Humanos |language=es |access-date=2006-07-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614143826/http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/Cuba67sp/indice.htm |archive-date=June 14, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=November 16, 2005 |url=http://newsfromrussia.com/world/2005/11/16/67822.html |title=Castro sued over alleged torture |publisher=News from Russia |access-date=2006-07-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214150400/http://newsfromrussia.com/world/2005/11/16/67822.html |archive-date=February 14, 2006 }}</ref> International human rights organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] have drawn attention to the actions of the human rights movement and designated members of it as [[Prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]], such as [[Óscar Elías Biscet]].

[[Cuban law]] limits freedom of expression, association, assembly, movement, and the press. Concerns have also been expressed about the operation of [[due process]]. According to Human Rights Watch, even though Cuba, officially [[state atheism|atheist]] until 1992, now "permits greater opportunities for religious expression than it did in past years, and has allowed several religious-run humanitarian groups to operate, the government still maintains tight control on religious institutions, affiliated groups, and individual believers".<ref name="hrw1999" /> [[Censorship in Cuba]] has also been at the center of complaints.<ref name="RWB-Index2008"/><ref name="cubaonline">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/rapport_gb_md_1.pdf |title=Going online in Cuba: Internet under surveillance |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |year=2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303221407/http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/rapport_gb_md_1.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-03}}</ref> According to the report of Human Rights Watch from 2017 the [[government]] continues to rely on arbitrary detention to harass and intimidate critics, independent activists, [[Dissident|political opponents]], and others.

Amnesty International's 2017–2018 Annual Report also noted more [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary detentions]], discriminatory layoffs by state agencies and harassments in [[self-employment]] with the aim of making them silent in criticism. Regarding any progress in [[education]], Amnesty International reported that advances in education were undermined by ongoing online and offline censorship. Cuba remained mostly closed to independent human rights monitors.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/americas/cuba/report-cuba/|title=Cuba 2017/2018|publisher=Amnesty International}}</ref>

Relating to arbitrary arrests and [[Detention (imprisonment)|detentions]] the report added that human rights and political activists continued to be harassed, [[Intimidation|intimidated]] and arbitrarily detained in high numbers. The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, a Cuban [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] not officially recognized by the state, recorded 5,155 arbitrary detentions in 2017, compared to 9,940 in 2016.

== History ==
{{Politics of Cuba}}
During [[Spanish colonization]], the oppression of the indigenous populations was chronicled at length by clergyman [[Bartolomé de las Casas]]. The subsequent transportation of African slaves to the island, which lasted over 300 years, led to [[United Kingdom|British]] military intervention and a determination "to put a stop to these abuses".<ref>"Report from the British commissionary judge, Havana, to the Foreign secretary (Lord Stanley)." September 30, 1866. Thomas, Hugh. ''Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom''. p.1050.</ref> Since Cuba achieved independence in 1902, successive Cuban governments have been criticised and condemned by various groups, both within Cuba and internationally, for human rights violations on the island. During the latter part of the Spanish colonial era in Cuba, human rights on the island became a particular international concern. After a visit to the region in 1898, [[U.S. Senator]] [[Redfield Proctor]] estimated that up to 200,000 Cubans had died from starvation and disease within "[[Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rubí#Cuba|Spanish forts]]", essentially [[concentration camps]].<ref>[http://hcs.harvard.edu/~rhetoric/proctor.htm Harvard Rhetorical Society]</ref> The concern was a contributory factor in garnering support for the [[Spanish–American War]] in the U.S.

After independence, and following a sustained period of instability, the 1924–33 government of [[Gerardo Machado]] proved to be authoritarian. Machado extended his rule until [[Fulgencio Batista]] led an uprising called the Revolt of the Sergeants, as part of a coup which deposed Machado in 1933. Batista then became the strongman behind a succession of puppet presidents until he was himself elected president in 1940. According to [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]], the post-Machado period was marked by violent reprisals, mass lynchings and a deterioration towards corruption and ''gansterismo'' throughout the island.<ref>[[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]]. ''Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom''. p.388</ref>

From 1940, Cuba had a multiparty electoral system until [[Fulgencio Batista]] (President from 1940–1944) staged a coup with military backing on March 10, 1952.<ref name="Bethell-Cuba">{{cite book|title=Cuba|first=Leslie|last=Bethell}}</ref><ref name="Sweig-Inside">{{cite book|title=Inside the Cuban Revolution|first=Julia E.|last=Sweig|year=2002|isbn=978-0-674-01612-5|url=https://archive.org/details/insidecubanrevol00juli}}</ref>

In 1958, ''Time'' magazine wrote: "Cuba's fanatic, poorly armed rebels last week tried to smash President Fulgencio Batista with the ultimate weapon of civilian revolutions: the general strike.&nbsp;... Fulgencio Batista got ready for the strike by offering immunity to anyone who killed a striker and by threatening to jail any employer who closed shop." During the strike, militants and youths stole guns, and threw bombs (one of which may have set up a gas-mains fire), after which some people were killed in clashes.

The strike was short-lived: "With the upper hand, Batista drove boldly around the city while his cops proceeded to make their supremacy complete. When a patrol car radioed that it had clashed with rebels and had 'a dead man and a prisoner', the dispatcher ordered: 'Shoot him.' At midafternoon, cops burst into a boardinghouse, grabbed three young men who were leaders of Cuba's lay Catholic Action movement, which sympathizes with Castro. Two hours later their stripped, [[torture]]d and bullet-torn bodies were turned over to relatives. Total dead: 43."{{attribution needed|date=November 2016}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,810279,00.html |work=Time |title=CUBA: Strongman's Round |date=April 21, 1958 |access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

In 1959, [[Fidel Castro]] and his forces succeeded in displacing Batista from power. At that time there were fundamental changes in the judicial and political process. During this transitional period there were some concerns voiced about [[due process]].<ref>The Day After — Cuba: His Brother's Keeper Foreign Policy archive.</ref><ref>[http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/castro_year1/castroyr1.ruleoflaw.html The End of the Rule of Law March 1959] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312142726/http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/castro_year1/castroyr1.ruleoflaw.html |date=March 12, 2013 }} Fidel Castro, by Robert E. Quirk 1993</ref>

The "Cuban National Reconciliation movement", a U.S.-based organisation that claims to act as a forum for discussing Cuban society, has detailed what it believes are complex variables when analysing human rights immediately after the revolution. In the 1960s, violent confrontations known as the [[Escambray Rebellion]] between the Cuban government and armed opposition were ongoing, but had declined by the early 1970s. The group asserts that by the time international human rights movements flourished in the 1970s, the most severe period of repression was over, making non-partisan retrospective assessments of the period difficult. The reconciliation movement also cite the difficulties in assessing accounts of abuses that are commonly split upon partisan lines. According to the group, [[Cuban exiles]] who were often the first to denounce the Cuban government, largely shared an anti-Communist ideology and overlooked violations committed by other regimes, whilst many left leaning observers did not give the claims of Cuban victims due consideration.<ref>[http://memoria.fiu.edu/memoria/documents/Book_English.pdf ''Cuban National Reconciliation movement''] Task force report 2003</ref>

After coming to power in 1959, Fidel Castro's government built a highly effective machinery of [[Political repression|repression]], according to Human Rights Watch.<ref name="hrw1999">{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/cuba/Cuba996-01.htm#P348_12349|title=Cuba's repressive machinery|publisher=Human Rights Watch|year=1999}}</ref>

=== Political executions ===
Various estimates have been made in order to ascertain the number of political executions carried out on behalf of the Cuban government since the revolution.  Within the first two months of the 1959, Castro's government executed more than 300 Batista officials,<ref name="APfeb59">{{cite news|last1=Berrellez|first1=Robert|title=True Picture Of Batista Regime's Atrocities In Cuba Begins To Emerge|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&dat=19590223&id=NP1XAAAAIBAJ&pg=2501,4729775|access-date=19 March 2017|work=[[Spokane Daily Chronicle]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=23 February 1959}}</ref> with Latin American historian Thomas E.

The vast majority of those executed directly following the 1959 revolution were policemen, politicians and informers for the Batista regime who were accused of crimes such as torture and murder, and their public trials and executions enjoyed widespread popular support among the Cuban population. Most scholars agree that those executed were probably guilty as charged, but their trials did not follow [[due process]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Chase|first=Michelle|editor-first1=Greg|editor-last1=Grandin|editor1-link=Greg Grandin|editor-first2=Joseph|editor-last2=Gilbert|encyclopedia=A Century of Revolution|title=The Trials|url=http://read.dukeupress.edu/content/a-century-of-revolution|access-date=2 October 2015|year=2010|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|location=Durham, NC|isbn= 978-0822347378|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YJ7ZBGy0wsIC&lpg=PP1&dq=a%20century%20of%20revolution&pg=PA163#v=onepage&q&f=false 163–198]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue25/farber25.htm|title=The Resurrection of Che Guevara|website=nova.wpunj.edu|access-date=2017-02-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129121500/http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue25/farber25.htm|archive-date=2011-11-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Cuban Government justified such measures on the grounds that the application of the death penalty in Cuba against war criminals and others followed the same procedure as the one previously followed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during the [[Nuremberg trials]].

=== Refugees ===
According to the US government, some 1,200,000 Cubans (about 10% of the current population) left the island for the United States between 1959 and 1993,<ref name="census.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/000797.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090709154810/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/000797.html |archive-date=2009-07-09 }}</ref> often by sea in small boats and [[Balseros (rafters)|fragile rafts]].

=== Forced labor camps and abuse of prisoners ===
In 1987 a "Tribunal on Cuba" was held in [[Paris]] in order to present testimonies by former prisoners of [[Cuban penal system|Cuba's penal system]] to the international media. The gathering was sponsored by Resistance International and The Coalition of Committees for the Rights of Man in Cuba. The testimonies which were presented at the tribunal, before an international panel, alleged that a pattern of [[torture]] existed in Cuba's prisons and "hard labor camps". These included beatings, biological experiments in diet restrictions, violent interrogations and extremely unsanitary conditions. The jury concurred with allegations of arbitrary arrest; sentencing by court martial with no public audience or defender; periods spent in hard labour camps without sufficient food, clothing or medical care; and the arrest of children who were over nine years old.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070610074457/http://polarch.sas.ac.uk/pdf_documents/TropicalGulag.pdf Tribunal on Cuba] Paris April 1986</ref>

The number of reported executions in Cuba declined during the 1970s and by the 1980s they were restricted to rare and high-profile cases, notably the execution of General [[Arnaldo Ochoa]] in 1989. Ochoa, who had once been proclaimed a "Hero of the Revolution" by Fidel Castro, along with three other high-ranking officers, was brought to trial for [[drug trafficking]]. This offense carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, but Ochoa and the others were convicted of [[treason]] and promptly executed. Opponents of the Castro government who live outside Cuba expressed skepticism about the legitimacy of Ochoa's arrest and execution.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Political abuse of psychiatry ===
Although Cuba has been politically connected to the Soviet Union since the United States broke off relations with Cuba shortly after its prime minister [[Fidel Castro]] came to power in 1959, few considerable allegations regarding the [[political abuse of psychiatry]] in that country emerged before the late 1980s.<ref name="Medicine betrayed">{{cite book|title=Medicine betrayed: the participation of doctors in human rights abuses|year=1992|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=1-85649-104-8|pages=74–76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMTu_oIfVsIC}}</ref>{{rp|74}} [[Americas Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] published reports which alluded to cases of possible unwarranted hospitalization and ill-treatment of political prisoners.<ref name="Medicine betrayed" />{{rp|75}} These reports concerned the Gustavo Machin hospital in [[Santiago de Cuba]] in the southeast of the country and the major mental hospital in [[Havana]].<ref name="Medicine betrayed" />{{rp|75}} In 1977, a report on the alleged abuse of psychiatry in Cuba presenting cases of ill-treatment in mental hospitals going back to the 1970s came out in the United States.<ref name="Medicine betrayed" />{{rp|75}} It presents grave allegations that prisoners end up in the forensic ward of mental hospitals in Santiago de Cuba and Havana where they undergo ill-treatment including [[electroconvulsive therapy]] without [[muscle relaxant]]s or [[anaesthesia]].<ref name="Medicine betrayed" />{{rp|75}} The reported application of ECT in the forensic wards seems, at least in many of the cited cases, not to be an adequate clinical treatment for the diagnosed state of the prisoner—in some cases the prisoners seem not to have been diagnosed at all.<ref name="Medicine betrayed" />{{rp|75}} Conditions in the forensic wards have been described in repulsive terms and apparently are in striking contrast to the other parts of the mental hospitals that are said to be well-kept and modern.<ref name="Medicine betrayed" />{{rp|75}}

===Censorship===
{{Main|Censorship in Cuba}}

Cuba officially adopted the civil and political rights enumerated in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948. One of the key principles in the declaration was the insistence on [[Freedom of Speech|Freedom of expression and opinion]].

Human rights groups and international organizations believe that these articles subordinate the exercise of freedom of expression to the state. The [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] assess that: "It is evident that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression under this article of the Constitution is governed by two fundamental determinants: on the one hand, the preservation and strengthening of the communist State; on the other, the need to muzzle any criticism of the group in power."<ref>[http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/IACHR.html#II Inter-American Commission on Human Rights Report on Cuba] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128091641/http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/IACHR.html#II |date=January 28, 2013 }}</ref> Human rights group [[Amnesty International]] assert that the universal state ownership of the media means that freedom of expression is restricted.

===Society===
In 2001 an attempt was made by [[Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas]] and others from the Christian Liberation Movement, operating as the [[Varela Project]], to have a national [[plebiscite]] using provisions in the [[Constitution of Cuba]] which provided for [[initiative|citizen initiative]]. If accepted by the government and approved by public vote, the amendments would have established such things as [[freedom of association]], [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of press]], as well as starting private businesses. The [[petition]] was refused by the National Assembly and in response a referendum was held in support of socialism being a permanent fixture of the constitution, for which the government claimed 99% voter approval.

Another important project is the establishment of the Assembly to Promote Civil Society. The Assembly to Promote Civil Society in Cuba is a coalition of 365 independent civil society groups with the stated aims of forming a democratic culture, developing a social movement, strengthening the Assembly's organization, communicating among groups to promote the civil society, using all available means to combat poverty and seeking the betterment of the community's life conditions, developing a true knowledge of Cuba's history, in all its dimensions: economic, social and political, undertaking activities and projects aimed at the protection and conservation of natural resources and the ecosystem, and promoting a true culture on labor rights.<ref>[http://www.asambleasociedadcivilcuba.info/Asamblea/Asamblea-en.htm Sitio Oficial de la Asamblea para Promover la Sociedad Civil en Cuba<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615070735/http://www.asambleasociedadcivilcuba.info/Asamblea/Asamblea-en.htm |date=June 15, 2007 }}</ref> The Assembly had its first meeting in May 2005.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/05/20/world/main697016.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Cuban Dissidents Cry 'Freedom' | date=May 20, 2005}}</ref>

===Capital punishment===
{{main|Capital punishment in Cuba}}
Cuba placed a moratorium on the use of [[capital punishment]] in 1999. However, an exception was made when, in 2003, three Cubans were executed for a ferry hijacking in which Cuban passengers and two young French female tourists were held at gunpoint. The hijackers were attempting to reach Florida, USA in order to seek asylum. No one was harmed in the incident but the gang held knives to the throats and threatened to kill them if the vessel was not given enough fuel to carry them to the United States.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2941041.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Cuba ferry hijackers executed |date=11 April 2003}}</ref>

===Acts of repudiation===
{{Main|Acts of repudiation}}
Human rights groups including Amnesty International have long been critical of what the Cuban authorities have termed "Acts of repudiation" (''actos de repudio''). These acts occur when large groups of citizens verbally abuse, intimidate and sometimes physically assault and throw stones and other objects at the homes of Cubans who are considered [[counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]]. Human rights groups suspect that these acts are often carried out in collusion with the security forces and sometimes involve the [[Committees for the Defence of the Revolution]] or the Rapid Response Brigades. The level of violence of these acts have increased significantly since 2003.<ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR250012006 Amnesty International report 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718170319/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR250012006 |date=2008-07-18 }}</ref>

===Notable prisoners of conscience===
* In 1960, [[Armando Valladares]] was working at the Cuban Postal Savings Bank when agents of the Ministry of Communications handed him a card bearing a communist slogan and told him to put it on his worktable. The 23-year-old Valladares refused. Astonished, the agents asked him if he had anything against Castro. Valladares answered that if Castro was a communist, he did. Valladares was convicted on a charge of placing bombs in public places and was sentenced to thirty years in prison. His supporters contend that he was never part of the Batista police as alleged by Castro supporters (because Valladares was only 19 at the time of the revolution), and that his imprisonment was the result of his vocal opposition to the Castro government. Conservative author [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]] has called him a "Human Rights Hero." Valladares claims to have been tortured and humiliated while he was on a [[hunger strike]] in order to protest against prison abuses; he claims the guards denied him water until he became delirious, and they proceeded to urinate in his mouth and on his face. Valladares was released from prison after serving twenty-two years of his sentence upon the intercession of France's Socialist President [[François Mitterrand]].
* In 1973, gay writer [[Reinaldo Arenas]] was sent to prison after being charged and convicted of 'ideological deviation' and for publishing abroad without official consent. He escaped from prison and tried to leave Cuba by launching himself from the shore on a tire inner tube. The attempt failed and he was re-arrested near Lenin Park and imprisoned at the notorious El Morro Castle alongside murderers and rapists. After escaping from Cuba, Arenas described the horrors he endured under the Cuban government in his autobiography ''Antes que anochezca'' (1992), English translation ''Before Night Falls'' (1993).
* On August 28, 1998, a Havana court sentenced [[Reynaldo Alfaro García]], a member of the [[Democratic Solidarity Party]], to three years in prison for "spreading enemy propaganda" and "rumour-mongering".
* Desi Mendoza, a Cuban doctor, was imprisoned for making statements criticizing Cuba's response to an [[epidemic]] of [[dengue fever]] in [[Santiago de Cuba]] which he alleged had caused several deaths. Dr. Mendoza had previously been fired from his job in a Cuban hospital three years earlier for establishing an independent medical association. He was later released due to ill-health, subject to his leaving the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR250281997?open%26of%3DENG-348 |title=MEDICAL LETTER WRITING ACTION {{!}} Dr Desi MENDOZA Rivero {{!}} CUBA |website=Amnesty International |access-date=2005-09-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415060951/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR250281997?open&of=ENG-348 |archive-date=2006-04-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aaas.org/program/scientific-responsibility-human-rights-law|title=Scientific Responsibility, Human Rights & Law Program|date=17 June 2013|website=AAAS - The World's Largest General Scientific Society}}</ref>
* [[Óscar Elías Biscet]], a medical doctor, has been sentenced to jail for 25 years for his non-violent, but vocal opposition to Castro.
* In early 2003, dozens of persons, including independent journalists, librarians and other opponents of the Castro government were jailed after summary [[show trial]]s, with some sentences in excess of 20 years, on the charge of receiving money from the United States in order to carry out anti-government activities.
* An [[Amnesty International]] report, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060518055507/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR250012006?open&of=ENG-CUB CUBA: fundamental freedoms still under attack] from [[Amnesty International]] calls for the "Cuban authorities to release all prisoners of conscience immediately and unconditionally" and to "revoke all legislation that restricts freedom of expression, assembly and association, and to put a halt to all actions to harass and intimidate dissidents, journalists, and [[human rights defender]]s".
* [[Jorge Luis García Pérez]] was reported to have been released from prison in April 2007 after serving his full sentence of 17 years and 34 days for having, at the age of 25, shouted slogans against Fidel Castro. García Antúnez was convicted of sabotage after authorities accused him of setting fire to sugar cane fields, sabotage, spreading "enemy propaganda", and being in illegal possession of a weapon.<ref>{{cite news |title=Castro opponent free after 17 years in jail | date=April 24, 2007

=== Travel and immigration ===

As of January 14, 2013, all Cuban government-imposed travel restrictions and controls have been abolished.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/internacionales/275273-reforma-migratoria-favorece-militantes-cubanos/|title=Reforma migratoria también favorece a los militantes cubanos|date=January 23, 2013|website=El Nuevo Diario|access-date=January 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Cuba: What Everyone Needs to Know|last=Sweig|first=Julia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|location=New York, NY|pages=264–265}}</ref> Since that date, any Cuban citizen, with a valid passport, can leave the country at will, without let or hindrance from the Cuban authorities. Visa requirements for Cuban citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Cuba. In 2014, Cuban citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 61 countries and territories, ranking the Cuban passport 69th in the world. Persons holding dual Spanish and Cuban citizenships are now allowed to travel freely, using their Spanish passport in lieu of a visa for countries normally requiring a visa for the Cuban passport. Moreover, ever since that date, the Cuban government extended the allowable time abroad from 11 to 24 months, allowing Cubans who return within the 24-month time frame to retain their status and benefits of "Cuban Resident of the Interior". Should the citizen remain out of Cuba for more than 24 months, then his status would change to "Cuban Resident of the Exterior" and he would lose his privileges within. By this change, there is no longer such a thing as "illegal" or "unauthorized" travel, and therefore persons who leave Cuba via unconventional means (boats etc.) are no longer violating Cuban law, and therefore not subject to detention or imprisonment.

Prior to January 13, 2013, Cuban citizens could not travel abroad, leave or return to Cuba without first obtaining official permission along with applying for a government issued passport and travel visa, which was often denied.<ref name="travel">{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/cuba12207.htm|title=Essential Background: Overview of human rights issues in Cuba |website=Human Rights Watch |date=31 December 2005}}</ref> Unauthorized travel abroad had sometimes resulted in criminal prosecution. It was common, in those days, that certain citizens who were authorized travel (primarily medical personnel and other professionals deemed essential to the country) were not permitted to take their children with them overseas. In the event that Cuban doctors defect to the United States when they are sent to a "mission" out of Cuba to any foreign country, any children left behind would not be allowed to join their defector parent for a minimum of ten years, even if they had received a foreign visa, and regardless of their age.<ref name="travel"/> Castro opposition leader [[Oswaldo Payá]] has been allowed to travel abroad to receive his [[Sakharov Prize]], but [[Ladies in White]] was not.

Even discussing unauthorized travel carried a six-month prison sentence.<ref name="kobayashi"/>

From 1959 through 1993, some 1.2 million Cubans (about 10% of the current population) left the island for the United States,<ref name="census.gov"/> often by sea in small boats and fragile rafts. In the early years, a number of those who could claim dual Spanish-Cuban citizenship left for [[Spain]]. Over time a number of [[Cuban Jews]] were allowed to emigrate to [[Israel]] after quiet negotiations; the majority of the 10,000 or so Jews who were in Cuba in 1959 have left. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, many Cubans now reside in a diverse number of countries, some ending up in countries of the [[European Union]]. A large number of Cubans live in [[Mexico]] and [[Canada]].

At times the exodus was tolerated by the Cuban government as a "release valve"; at other times the government has impeded it. Some Cubans left for economic reasons and some for political ones. Others emigrated by way of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Naval Base]] at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]], which is blocked on the Cuban (land) side by barbed-wired fences and land mines.

In 1995 the US government entered into an agreement with the Cuban government to resolve the emigration crisis that created the [[Mariel Boatlift]] of 1980, when Castro opened the docks to anyone who wanted to leave. The result of the negotiations was an agreement under which the United States was required to issue 20,000 visas annually to Cuban emigrants. This quota is rarely filled; the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] refused to comply with the act, issuing only 505 visas to Cubans in the first six months of 2003. It also blocked some Cubans who have visas.

On July 13, 1994, 72 Cubans attempted to leave the Island on a [[World War II]] era [[tugboat]] named the ''[[13 de Marzo Incident|13 de Marzo]]''. In an attempt by the Cuban Navy to stop the tugboat, patrol boats were sent out to intercept the tug. Crewmen and survivors reported that the interception vessels rammed the tugboat and sprayed its passengers with high-pressure fire hoses, sweeping many overboard.

The US Coast Guard reported that the interceptions in high seas have been characterized as violent confrontations with authorities and by the deaths of immigrants. According to the same authorities, the Cubans are taken to the US on speed boats by a network of criminals specialized in human trafficking, former drug traffickers, based in southern Florida which now find contraband of humans more lucrative than drugs. These criminals charge 8 to 12 thousand dollars per person, overcrowding the small vessels. The majority of those that attempt to emigrate are individuals that have relatives in the United States, others who do not qualify to be considered as legal immigrants in the US, or those who do not want to wait their turn in the annual quota, assigned under the migratory treaties for legal immigrants <ref name="Gomez">{{cite web |date=February 2006 | url = https://groups.yahoo.com/group/CubaNews/message/46114 | title =Washington's Weapon to Create a Migratory Crisis | publisher =AIN }}</ref>

Since November 1966, the [[Cuban Adjustment Act]] provides automatic permanent residency for almost all Cubans arriving legally or illegally after one year and one day in the US. No immigrant from any other nation has this privilege. Controversy over this policy centers around the loss of Cuba's scientists, professionals, technicians and other skilled individuals, but it has also prompted concerns of a migratory crisis.

At the end of the 2005 fiscal year which ended September 30, the US Coast Guard Service reported having intercepted 2,712 Cubans at sea, more than double the 1,225 reported in 2004<ref name="Gomez"/> The figure for 2005 is the third highest of Cubans intercepted in the Florida straights during the last 12 years. The highest had been reported in 1993 with 3,656 and 1994 when over 30,000 Cubans emigrated illegally due to the so-called migratory crisis between the two countries.<ref name="Gomez"/>

The 1994 and 1995 migratory accords signed between Havana and Washington, and which emerged due to the crisis in August 1994, are still in effect. These accords force the US to return all those intercepted at sea by US authorities to Cuba, except the cases in which political persecution can be proven to justify exile in the United States.

The accords were designed to discourage those who would consider emigrating illegally by sea but the Bush administration has not complied with Washington's part of the agreements.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Although the Coast Guard says that only 2.5 percent of the Cubans intercepted are granted political asylum, the public understanding, the public perception in Cuba and among the Cuban community in Miami, is not the same. And since that is not the perception, more and more people continue to illegally leave the island by sea causing fatal consequences. According to studies carried out by Cuban experts on the island, it is estimated that at least 15 percent of those that attempt to cross the sea die before reaching the US.<ref name="Gomez"/>

However, figures of those fleeing other Latin American or Caribbean countries of origin compare similarly with those of Cuba. During the 2005 fiscal year, 3,612 Dominicans were picked up at high seas attempting to illegally reach the US (900 more than Cubans intercepted) and in 2004, 3,229 Haitians were also picked up (2,000 more than the 1,225 Cubans that fiscal year). The Brazilian daily ''O Globo'' published an article on illegal immigrants in the US, quoting official sources, pointing out that during the first semester of 2005, 27,396 Brazilians were stopped from illegally crossing US borders, an average of 4,556 per month and 152 a day. In 2004, a total of 1,160,000 foreigners, were stopped when attempting to illegally enter the US, 93 percent of them (close to 1,080,000) were Mexicans.<ref name="Gomez"/>

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Cuba}}
Education in Cuba is normally free at all levels and controlled by the Ministry for Education. In 1961 the government nationalized all private educational institutions and introduced a state-directed education system. The system has been criticized for political indoctrination and for monitoring the political opinions of the students.

Strong ideological content is present. The constitution states that educational and cultural policy is based on Marxism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/TestFrame/e7d25838f4d76da08025666700335f64?Opendocument|title=unhchr.ch|website=www.unhchr.ch}}</ref>

===Healthcare===
{{Main|Healthcare of Cuba}}
The Cuban government operates on national health system and assumes full fiscal and administrative responsibility for the health care of its citizens. The government prohibits any private alternatives to the national health system. In 1976, Cuba's healthcare program was enshrined in Article 50 of the revised constitution which states, "Everyone has the right to health protection and care". Healthcare in Cuba is also free.

However, there is no right to privacy, or a patient's informed consent, or the right to protest or sue a doctor or clinic for malpractice.<ref name="Hirschfeld">{{cite journal|url=http://www.miscelaneasdecuba.net/media/pdf/Article-Hirschfeld-Press.pdf |title=Re-examining the Cuban Health Care System: Towards a Qualitative Critique |first=Katherine |last=Hirschfeld |journal=Cuban Affairs |volume=2 |issue=3 |date=July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317225912/http://www.miscelaneasdecuba.net/media/pdf/Article-Hirschfeld-Press.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-17 }}</ref><ref name="Hirschfeld-since1898"/> Moreover, the patient does not have right to refuse treatment (for example, a [[Rastafarian]] cannot refuse an [[amputation]] on grounds that his religion forbids it.)<ref name="Hirschfeld"/><ref name="Hirschfeld-since1898">{{cite book|title=Health, politics, and revolution in Cuba since 1898|first=Katherine|last=Hirschfeld}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2016}}</ref> Many Cubans complain about politics in medical treatment and health care decision-making.<ref name="Hirschfeld"/>

After spending nine months in Cuban clinics, anthropologist Katherine Hirschfeld wrote "My increased awareness of Cuba’s criminalization of dissent raised a very provocative question: to what extent is the favorable international image of the Cuban health care system maintained by the state’s practice of suppressing dissent and covertly intimidating or imprisoning would-be critics?"<ref name="Hirschfeld"/>

Family doctors are expected to keep records of their patients' "political integration."<ref name="Hirschfeld-since1898"/> Epidemiological surveillance has become juxtaposed with political surveillance.<ref name="Hirschfeld-since1898"/>

=== Religious freedom ===
{{Main|Religion in Cuba}}
In the years following the [[Cuban Revolution]], the activities of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] were severely limited and in 1961 all property held by religious organizations was confiscated without compensation. Hundreds of members of the [[clergy]], including a [[bishop]], were permanently expelled from the nation. The Cuban leadership was officially [[atheism|atheist]] until 1992 when the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]] agreed to allow religious followers to join the party. In 1998, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the island and was allowed to conduct large outdoor [[mass (liturgy)|masses]] and
[[Visa (document)|visas]] were issued for nineteen foreign priests taking up residence in the country. In addition, other religious groups in Cuba such as the [[Jew]]ish community are now permitted to hold public services and to import religious materials and [[kosher]] food for [[Passover]], as well as to receive [[rabbi]]s and other religious visitors from abroad.

About the torture in Cuba, in 2005 a group of culture personalities, including several [[Nobel Prize]] laureates, have signed an appeal on ''[[The Guardian]]'' in defense of Cuba, claiming that "the government of the US has no moral authority to elect itself as the judge over human rights in Cuba, where there has not been a single case of disappearance, torture or extra-judicial execution since 1959, and where despite the economic blockade, there are levels of health, education and culture that are internationally recognised."

==Black Spring==
{{Main|Black Spring (Cuba)}}
In March 2003, the government of Cuba arrested dozens of people (including self-identified journalists and [[human rights activist]]s), and charged them with [[sedition]] due to their alleged cooperation with [[James Cason]], head of the [[United States Interests Section in Havana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hermanos.org/docs/tmh032103.html|title=35 Cuban dissidents arrested |date=20 March 2003 |first=Nancy |last=San Martin |work=The Miami Herald}}</ref> The accused were tried and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 15 to 28 years. In all, 75 people were given lengthy sentences averaging 17 years each. Among those sentenced were [[Raúl Rivero]], [[Marta Beatriz Roque]], and [[Oscar Elías Biscet]]. [[Amnesty International]] described the trials as "hasty and manifestly unfair."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://takeaction.amnestyusa.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item=10678 |title=Welcome to Amnesty International USA's Online Action Center! |website=Amenesty International USA |access-date=2004-05-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040427121421/http://takeaction.amnestyusa.org/action/index.asp?step=2 |archive-date=2004-04-27 }}</ref>

Cuban Foreign Minister [[Felipe Pérez Roque]] denied these accusations and responded: "Cuba has the right to defend itself and apply punishment just like other nations do, like the United States punishes those who cooperate with a foreign power to inflict damage on their people and territory."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ain.cubaweb.cu/2004/marzo/25cmconferencia.htm |title=Cuba Responds to Rough Lies on 75 Imprisoned Mercenaries |access-date=2004-09-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050108055623/http://www.ain.cubaweb.cu/2004/marzo/25cmconferencia.htm |archive-date=2005-01-08 }}</ref>

During the trial, evidence was presented that the defendants had received funds from the U.S. Interests Section. Cuban officials claim that the goal of this funding was to undermine the Cuban state, disrupt internal order, and damage the Cuban economy. For his part, Cason denies offering funds to anyone in Cuba.

On November 29, 2004, the Cuban government released three of those arrested in the March 2003: [[Oscar Espinosa Chepe]], [[Marcelo López]], and [[Margarito Broche]].

==Campaigns against homosexual behavior==
{{Main|LGBT rights in Cuba|Military Units to Aid Production}}

Thousands of [[homosexual]]s, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], conscientious objectors, and dissidents were forced to conduct their compulsory military service in the 1960s at UMAP camps, where they were subject to political "[[:wikt:reeducation|reeducation]]".<ref name="Hirschfeld-since1898"/><ref>{{cite book|title=World Police Encyclopedia|author=Dilip K.

The camps became increasingly crowded as the methods of arrest became more expedient".<ref name="Hirschfeld-since1898"/>

In the late 1960s, because of "revolutionary social hygiene", the Castro government claimed to cleanse the arts of "fraudulent sodomitic" writers and "sick effeminate" dancers.<ref name="Lumsden" /> Additionally, men with long hair were locked up and their hair was cut.<ref name="Lumsden" />

In a 2010 interview with Mexican newspaper ''La Jornada'', the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba]], Fidel Castro, called the persecution of homosexuals whilst he was in power "a great injustice, great injustice!" Taking responsibility for the persecution, he said, "If anyone is responsible, it's me&nbsp;... We had so many and such terrible problems, problems of life or death. In those moments I was not able to deal with that matter [of homosexuals]. I found myself immersed, principally, in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Crisis of October]], in the war, in policy questions." Castro personally believed that the negative treatment of gays in Cuba arose out of the country's pre-revolutionary attitudes toward homosexuality.<ref>{{Cite news

==United Nations Human Rights Commission==
Cuban human rights have been repeatedly discussed and debated in the [[United Nations Human Rights Commission]] since the Cuban Revolution. It would become a recurring flashpoint in the backdrop of international dynamic during the [[Cold War]] and into the years following.

The organized and sustained international effort launched by prominent Cuban dissident groups (e.g. Miami's Center for Human Rights,<ref name="Verdeja">Sam Verdeja, Guillermo Martinez, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k186e30BHmgC&pg=PT232 Cubans, an Epic Journey: The Struggle of Exiles for Truth and Freedom]'' (2012). p. 241, {{ISBN|1935806203}}.</ref> UNIDAD Cubana,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Emergency intervention of world leaders urged in favor of Cuban political prisoners|url=http://www.cubdest.org/0312/c0307marthae.html|access-date=2020-10-14|website=www.cubdest.org}}</ref> [[Christian Democratic Party of Cuba]], and others) and affiliated [[NGOs]]  (such as [[Human Rights Watch]]) made their way to the UNHRC and would become a growing presence in [[Geneva]]. These groups sometimes represented a spectrum of different Cuban interests, such as [[religious liberty]] (e.g. [[Christian-Democrat]] movements, parties, and organizations)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/172070/files/E_CN.4_1995_INF.1-EN.pdf|title=United Nations Economic and Social Council, Commission on Human Rights, Fifty-First Session, E/CN.4/1995/INF.1|publisher=United Nations|date=9 March 1995|access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/169318/files/E_CN.4_1995_Misc.2-ES.pdf|title=United Nations Economic and Social Council, Commission on Human Rights, Fifty-First Session, E/CN.4/1995/MISC.2|publisher=United Nations|date=10 February 1995|access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> and education (e.g. the International Association of Educators for World Peace),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/1996/19960412.hrcn733.html|title=Commission begins consideration of rights of indigenous peoples; Press Release HR/CN/733|publisher=[[United Nations]]|date=April 12, 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/236707/files/E_CN.4_Sub.2_1996_Misc.1-ES.pdf|title=Commission on Human Rights; Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, Forty-Eighth Session, E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/Misc.1|date=9 August 1996|access-date=June 25, 2019}}</ref> that coalesced around the issue of human rights. An influential force credited with crafting and spearheading the international Cuban human rights effort, particularly in the [[United Nations]], was activist and Cuban community leader [[Jesus Permuy]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Robert|date=2018-10-01|title=Ros-Lehtinen, other community leaders salute Jesús Permuy|url=https://communitynewspapers.com/coral-gables-news/ros-lehtinen-other-community-leaders-salute-jesus-permuy/|access-date=2020-10-14|website=Miami's Community News|language=en-US}}</ref> [[The Miami Herald]]'s profile of the Cuban Christian Democrat Movement stated that Permuy spearheaded the international diplomatic strategy to call out the Castro regime's human rights abuses and work with other [[Christian-Democrat]]ic governments to withhold international support until governmental changes were made to address human rights abuses.<ref name="Ducassi">{{cite news|first1=Jay|last1=Ducassi|title=Exile Group Fights Castro With Words|work=The Miami Herald|date=June 17, 1984|pages=1B}}</ref> Though the coalition's NGO-driven human rights effort for Cuba initially struggled to gain traction in the UNHRC, their influence gradually grew, especially as key groups secured Consultative Status which significantly expanded their resources and exposure there.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Congressional Record House Articles|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2017/10/11/house-section/article/H7959-4|access-date=2020-10-14|website=www.congress.gov}}</ref> A significant turning point in these efforts came in 1984 when Permuy's Miami-based Center for Human Rights successfully lobbied to have Cuba's diplomatic representative, Luis Sola Vila, removed from a key subcommittee of the United Nations Human Rights Commission and replaced with a representative from [[Ireland]], a Christian-Democratic ally in oppostion of the Castro government.<ref name="Ducassi"/> Another key moment came in 1987 when US President [[Ronald Reagan]] appointed [[Armando Valladares]], former Cuban political prisoner of 22 years, as the US Ambassardor to the Commission. By 1992, there had been a substantial change in Geneva as the UNHRC representatives had shifted from initial rejection, then indifference and towards embrace of the anti-Castro Cuban human rights movement's diplomatic efforts.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Juan O.|last1=Tamayo|title=Exiles' Message Embraced at U.N.|work=The Miami Herald|date=March 3, 1992|pages=7A}}</ref>

Since 1990, the United States itself has presented various resolutions to the annual [[UN Human Rights Commission]] criticizing Cuba's human rights record. The proposals and subsequent diplomatic disagreements have been described as a "nearly annual ritual".<ref name="Herald">[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/human-rights/un-vote.htm U.N. panel condemns Cuba for rights abuses] Miami Herald April 19, 2001</ref> Long-term consensus between Latin American nations has not emerged.<ref name = "coha-OAS-UNHRC">[http://www.coha.org/2005/05/02/cuba-the-un-human-rights-commission-and-the-oas-race/ Cuba, the U.N.

In the Americas, some governments back the criticism, others oppose it, seeing it as a cynical manipulation of a serious human rights issue in order to promote the isolation of the island and to justify the decades-old embargo.<ref name = "coha-OAS-UNHRC"/> European Union nations have universally voted against Cuba since 1990, though requests that the resolution should contain references to the negative effects of the economic embargo have been made.<ref>[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/human-rights/panel.htm U.N. rights panel votes to criticize Cuba] Miami Herald 2000</ref>
