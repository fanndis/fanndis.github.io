== Plot ==
Reuben Tishkoff invests in building a hotel-casino on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]; against advice from his friend and erstwhile criminal partner, [[Danny Ocean (character)|Danny Ocean]], he involves himself with wealthy investor and casino mogul Willy Bank, whose thugs strongarm him into signing over his ownership stake. Tishkoff suffers a [[heart attack]] and becomes bedridden. Ocean offers Bank a chance to set things right, given his long history in [[Las Vegas]] and the fact that he "shook [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]]'s hand", but Bank refuses and completes construction of the hotel, renamed "The Bank". To avenge Tishkoff, Ocean gathers his partners-in-crime and plans to ruin Bank on the opening night of the hotel. 

The crew develops a plan with two objectives: The first is to prevent The Bank from winning the prestigious Five Diamond Award, which all of Bank's previous hotels have won. Saul Bloom will stand in as the anonymous Diamond reviewer, while Ocean and his associates will treat the real reviewer horribly. The second objective is to rig all of the casino's games to pay out millions in winnings; Bank's casino has to make $500 million in order to stay open, otherwise he would have to cede control of the casino to the [[Nevada Gaming Commission|gaming board]]. While they can implement various rigging mechanisms into the casino, Danny and his crew know they would be easily stopped by The Greco, a state-of-the-art computer system that monitors the gamblers' biometric responses and predicts when cheating is happening. To disrupt the Greco, they plan to use a [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]] disguised as a new cell phone as a gift to Bank. They also obtain the [[Tunnel boring machine|drilling machine]] used to bore the [[Channel Tunnel]] to simulate an earthquake under the casino, ensuring that Bank will implement safety protocols to evacuate the premises. Their plan on opening night is to have Bank inadvertently disrupt Greco by using his new phone, initiate their rigged machines and dealers on their payroll, and then simulate the earthquake to force the evacuation and have players leave with their winnings.

Shortly before opening night, the drill breaks down, forcing Danny to ask Terry Benedict, whom Danny has slighted in the past, for funds to buy a replacement. Benedict, who also seeks retribution against Bank, offers the funds for a portion of his share of the take and demands that Ocean also steal Banks' private diamond collection in celebration of his Five Diamond Awards. These are valued at over $250 million and secured in a case at the top of The Bank. Ocean has Linus Caldwell get romantically close to Bank's assistant, Abigail Sponder, to gain access to the case. Secretly, Benedict contracts master thief François "The Night Fox" Toulour to intercept the diamonds.

On opening night, Ocean institutes the final part of the plan by having [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents on his payroll arrive at the hotel and arrest Livingston Dell on suspicion of rigging the card-shuffling machines, allowing them to be replaced with actual rigged ones. Another FBI agent arrests Linus for switching the diamonds with fakes. The agent takes Linus away but reveals himself to be his father, Robert Caldwell, also in on Ocean's plan. They try to evacuate from the roof but are intercepted by Toulour, who takes the diamonds and parachutes off the roof. However, Ocean anticipated this, and never had Linus make the switch. Linus and his father escape in a helicopter piloted by Basher, tearing the case from the roof and taking the diamonds with them.

The remainder of Ocean's plan goes as expected; as they trigger the earthquake, the players evacuate with millions of dollars of winnings. Ocean approaches a devastated Bank and tells him that he did everything and that it was for Reuben. Ocean also reminds Bank that he cannot get revenge, since Danny knows all of Bank's associates and they prefer him over Bank, and that he cannot go to the police due to Bank's illegal activities. With their share of the winnings, Ocean's crew buy property on the Strip for Reuben to build his own casino. Ocean donates Benedict's $72 million portion of the take to charity in Benedict's name, forcing him to admit his philanthropy on broadcast television. As Ocean, Rusty, and Linus prepare to depart from the airport, Rusty rigs one of the slot machines there to allow the real Diamond reviewer to win $11 million, compensating him for how they treated him.

In January 2006, it was reported that producers were in discussions about setting and shooting most of the film at the [[Wynn Las Vegas]].

=== Critical reception===
On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 70% based on 199 reviews, and an average rating of 6.38/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Ocean's Thirteen'' reverts to the formula of the first installment, and the result is another slick and entertaining heist film."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/oceans_thirteen/|title=Ocean's Thirteen|access-date=October 13, 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/oceans-thirteen|title=Ocean's Thirteen Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=March 13, 2018}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.

In his review for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', David Edelstein wrote, "As the plotting gets knottier, [Soderbergh]'s technique gets more fluid—the editing jazzier, the colors more luscious, the whip-pans more whizbang.
