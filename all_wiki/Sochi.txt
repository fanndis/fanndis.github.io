==History==
{{Main|History of Sochi}}

=== Early history ===
Before the whole area was conquered by [[Cimmerian]], [[Scythian]] and [[Sarmatian]] invaders, the [[Zygii]] (Proto-[[Circassians|Adyghe]]) people lived in [[Lesser Abkhazia]] under the [[Kingdom of Pontus]], then the [[Roman Empire]]'s influence in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. From the 6th to the 11th centuries, the area successively belonged to the Georgian kingdoms of [[Lazica]] and [[Kingdom of Abkhazia|Abkhazia]], who built a dozen churches within the city boundaries, the later was [[Kingdom of Georgia#Unification of the Georgian State|unified]] under the single [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian monarchy]] in 11th-century, forming one of the [[Saeristavo]], known as [[Duchy of Tskhumi|Tskhumi]] extending its possessions up to [[Nicopsis]]. The Christian settlements along the coast were destroyed by the invading [[Alans]], [[Khazars]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] and other [[nomadic empire]]s whose control of the region was slight. The northern wall of an 11th-century [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] [[basilica]] still stands in the [[Loo Microdistrict]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arch-sochi.ru/2012/05/vizantiyskiy-hram-v-loo/|script-title=ru:Византийский храм в Лоо|publisher=Архитектура Сочи|language=ru|accessdate=January 30, 2014|date=2012-05-16}}</ref>

Between the [[13th century|13th]] and [[15th century|15th centuries]], the [[Republic of Genoa]] had the monopoly of the trade on the shores of the Black Sea, and established colonies and trading posts in the region of the present-day Sochi, the large ones were [[Adler Microdistrict|Layso]] and [[Khosta Microdistrict|Costa]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Генуэзцы|url=http://edemkavkaza.ru/enciklopediasochi/179-genuezcy.html|access-date=2020-11-18|website=edemkavkaza.ru}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-05-19|title=Крепость Годлик, Сочи – описание, история, фотография, а также интересные факты {{!}} Nicko.ru|url=https://nicko.ru/крепость-годлик/|access-date=2020-11-18|language=ru-RU}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Фунтиков|first=Илья|date=2017-04-26|title=Генуэзская крепость в Хосте|url=https://sochinews.io/2017/04/26/genuezskaya-krepost-v-hoste/|access-date=2020-11-18|website=Новости Сочи Sochinews.io|language=ru-RU}}</ref>

From the 14th to the 19th centuries, the region was dominated by the [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]], [[Ubykh people|Ubykh]] and [[Adyghe people|Adyghe]] tribes, the current location of the city of Sochi known as [[Ubykhia]] was part of historical [[Circassia]], and was controlled by the native people of the local mountaineer clans of the north-west Caucasus, nominally under the sovereignty of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which was their principal trading partner in the Muslim world.

=== Russian Empire ===
The coastline was ceded to [[Russia]] in 1829 as a result of the [[Caucasian War]] and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russo-Turkish War]], 1828–1829; however, the [[Circassians]] did not admit the Russian control over [[Circassia]] and kept resisting the newly established Russian outposts along the [[Circassian coast]] ({{lang-ady|Адыгэ хы аушу}}).<ref name="Mus">Exposition of the Historical Museum of Sochi, partly reflected in Russian in{{cite web|url=http://www.sochiadm.ru/content/section/35/detail/31/ |title=История Сочи |accessdate=October 11, 2010 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011234131/http://www.sochiadm.ru/content/section/35/detail/31/ |archive-date=October 11, 2010  }}  (History of Sochi) at the official site of the city</ref><ref name="Mus2">[http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/07/05/11511062.html Sochi – from ancient sites to 2014 Olympics], information from the Historical Museum of Sochi</ref> Provision of weapons and ammunition from abroad to the Circassians caused a diplomatic conflict between the [[Russian empire|Russian Empire]] and the [[Britain's Imperial Century|British Empire]] that occurred in 1836 over the [[mission of the Vixen|mission of the ''Vixen'']].<ref>[[Peter Hopkirk]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=1_41VGoCYU8C&pg=PA158 ''The great game: On Secret Service in High Asia''], Chapter 12 "The Greatest Fortress in the World", pp. 158–159, Oxford University Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0-19-280232-1}}</ref>

The Russians had no detailed knowledge of the area until Baron [[Feodor Tornau]] investigated the coastal route from [[Gelendzhik]] to [[Gagra]], and across the mountains to [[Kabarda]], in the 1830s.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} In 1838, the fort of Alexandria, renamed Navaginsky a year later, was founded at the mouth of the [[Sochi River]] as part of the Black Sea coastal line, a chain of seventeen fortifications set up to protect the area from recurring Circassian resistance. At the outbreak of the [[Crimean War]], the garrison was evacuated from Navaginsky in order to prevent its capture by the Turks, who effected a landing on [[Adler, Russia|Cape Adler]] soon after.

The last battle of the [[Caucasian War]] took place at the Godlikh river on March 18, 1864 [[Old Style|O.S.]], where the Ubykhs were defeated by the Dakhovsky regiment of the Russian Army. On March 25, 1864, the Dakhovsky fort was established on the site of the Navaginsky fort. The end of Caucasian War was proclaimed at Kbaade tract (modern [[Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi, Krasnodar Krai|Krasnaya Polyana]]) on June 2 (21 May [[Old Style|O.S.]]), 1864, by the manifesto of [[Emperor]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;II]] read aloud by [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia]].<ref name="Mus" />

After the end of Caucasian War (during the period of 1864–1870) almost all Ubykhs and a major part of the [[Shapsugs]], who lived on the territory of modern Sochi, were either killed in the [[Circassian Genocide]] or expelled to the [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Circassian Genocide]]). Starting in 1866 the coast was actively colonized by Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Greeks, Germans, Georgians and other people from inner Russia.<ref name="Mus" /><ref name="Mus2" />

In 1874–1891, the first [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox church]], [[Saint Michael's Church, Sochi|St.&nbsp;Michael's Church]], was constructed, and the Dakhovsky settlement was renamed ''Dakhovsky'' [[Posad]] on April 13, 1874 ([[Old Style|O.S.]]). In February 1890, the Sochi Lighthouse was constructed. In 1896, the Dakhovsky [[Posad]] was renamed ''Sochi'' [[Posad]] (after the name of local river) and incorporated into the newly formed [[Black Sea Governorate]]. In 1900–1910, Sochi burgeoned into a sea resort. The first resort, "Kavkazskaya Riviera", opened on June 14, 1909 ([[Old Style|O.S.]]). Sochi was granted town status in 1917.<ref name="Mus" />

=== Soviet time===
During the [[Russian Civil War]], the littoral area saw [[Sochi conflict|sporadic armed clashes]] involving the [[Red Army]], [[White movement]] forces, and the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]]. As a result of the war Sochi has become Russian territory. In 1923, Sochi acquired one of its most distinctive features, a [[North Caucasus Railway|railway which runs]] from [[Tuapse]] to Georgia within a kilometer or two of the coastline. Although this branch of the [[Northern Caucasus Railway]] may appear somewhat incongruous in the setting of beaches and sanatoriums, it is still operational and vital to the region's transportation infrastructure.<ref name="Mus" />

Sochi was established as a fashionable resort area under [[Joseph Stalin]], who had his favorite [[dacha]] built in the city. Stalin's study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public.<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/2007-02-07-stalins-ghost-haunts-black-sea-hotel ''Stalin's ghost haunts Black Sea hotel''] at Mail & Guardian Online, Retrieved February 7, 2014</ref> During Stalin's reign the coast became dotted with imposing [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is [[Alexey Shchusev|Shchusev]]'s [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivist]] Institute of Rheumatology (1927–1931). The area was continuously developed until the demise of the Soviet Union.<ref name="Mus" />

=== Modern Russia ===
Following Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the [[Crimean Peninsula]] ([[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] from the [[Russian SFSR]] to the [[Ukrainian SSR]] in 1954 by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]), Sochi emerged as the unofficial [[summer capital]] of the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/26138/3027662/|script-title=ru:Олимпийская столица - и для спортсменов, и для бизнесменов|last=Голубева|first=Елена|newspaper=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]|language=ru|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref> In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a ''Greater Sochi'' which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of [[Tuapse]] to [[Adler Microdistrict|Adler]]. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process.<ref name="FA">{{cite journal|title=Sochi in the Russian Imagination|journal=[[Foreign Affairs]]|date=February 2014|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2014-02-23/sochi-russian-imagination|last1=Koenker|first1=Diane P.}}{{subscription required|via=Foreign Affairs}}</ref> Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many [[Sochi agreement|treaties]], especially those between the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]], separatist [[Abkhazia]]n, and separatist [[South Ossetia]]n governing authorities.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The vast majority of the population of Sochi lives in a narrow strip along the coast and is organized in independent microdistricts (formerly settlements). The biggest of these microdistricts, from the northwest to the southeast, are [[Lazarevskoye Microdistrict|Lazarevskoye]], [[Loo Microdistrict|Loo]], [[Dagomys]], central Sochi ([[Tsentralny City District, Sochi|Tsentralny City District]]), [[Khosta Microdistrict|Khosta]], [[Matsesta Microdistrict|Matsesta]], and [[Adler Microdistrict|Adler]]. The whole city is located on the slopes of the [[Western Caucasus]] which descend to the Black Sea and are cut by the rivers. The biggest rivers in Sochi are the [[Mzymta River|Mzymta]], which is in fact the longest Black Sea tributary in Russia, and the [[Shakhe River|Shakhe]]. Other rivers include the Ashe, the Psezuapse, the [[Sochi River|Sochi]], the Khosta, and the [[Matsesta River|Matsesta]]. The [[Psou River]] makes the border with Abkhazia.

The northeastern part of the city belongs to the [[Caucasian Biosphere Reserve]] which is a [[World Heritage Site]] spanning vast areas in Krasnodar Krai and Adygea.

===Lazarevsky City District===
{{Further|Lazarevsky City District|:Category:Lazarevsky City District}}
[[File:Letniy theatre Sochi.jpg|thumb|210px|The Summer Theater]]

[[Lazarevsky City District]] lies to the northwest from the city center; the 2010 Census showed the population of 63,894 people.<ref name="2010Census"/> It is the largest city district by area, covering some {{convert|1744|km2|sp=us}} and comprising several [[microdistrict]]s:
*[[Lazarevskoye Microdistrict|Lazarevskoye]], {{convert|59|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city center, contains a [[delphinarium]], an old church (1903), and a new church (1999). The settlement was founded as a Russian military outpost in 1839 and was named after Admiral [[Mikhail Lazarev]].
*[[Loo Microdistrict|Loo]], {{convert|18|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city center, was once owned by Princes Loov, a noble Abkhazian family. The district contains the ruins of a medieval church, founded in the 8th century, rebuilt in the 11th century, and converted into a fortress in the Late Middle Ages.
*[[Dagomys]], {{convert|18|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city center, has been noted for its [[botanical garden]], established by order of [[Nicholas II]], as well as tea plantations and factories. A sprawling hotel complex was opened there in 1982. Dagomys adjoins [[Bocharov Ruchey]], a [[dacha]] built for [[Kliment Voroshilov]] in the 1950s, but later upgraded into a country residence of the [[President of Russia]], where he normally spends his vacations and often confers with leaders of other states.
*[[Golovinka]] is a historic location at the mouth of the Shakhe River. Formerly marking the border between the [[Ubykhs]] and the [[Shapsugs]], the settlement was noted by Italian travelers of the 17th century as Abbasa. On May 3, 1838, it was the site of the [[Subashi landing]] of the Russians, who proceeded to construct Fort Golovinsky where many convicted [[Decembrists]] used to serve. The fort was intentionally destroyed by Russian forces at the beginning of the [[Crimean War]], so as to avoid its capture by the enemy.
*[[Fort Godlik]], of which little remains, had a turbulent history. It was built at the mouth of the Godlik River in the Byzantine period (5th to 8th centuries), was destroyed by the [[Khazars]] and revived by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] in the High Middle Ages.

===Khostinsky City District===
{{Further|Khostinsky City District|:Category:Khostinsky City District}}
[[File:Dendrarium Sochi Mauritanian arbour.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Sochi Arboretum]]]]

===Adlersky City District===
{{Further|Adlersky City District|:Category:Adlersky City District}}

[[Adlersky City District]], with an area of {{convert|1352|km2|sp=us}} and a population of 76,534 people as of the 2010 Census,<ref name="2010Census"/> is the southernmost district of the city, located just north of the border with Abkhazia. Until the establishment of Greater Sochi in 1961, it was administered as a separate town, which had its origin in an ancient [[Sadz]] village and a medieval [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] trading post.

Among the natural wonders of the district is the Akhshtyr Gorge with a 160-meter-long cave that contains traces of human habitation from about 30,000 years ago. The upland part of the district includes a network of remote mountain villages ([[aul]]s), the [[Estonia]]n colony at [[Estosadok]], and the ski resort of [[Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi, Krasnodar Krai|Krasnaya Polyana]] which hosted the events (Alpine and Nordic) of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].

The state-controlled [[RAO UES]] announced in July 2007 that it might spend 30&nbsp;billion roubles (about US$1.2 billion) on upgrading the electrical power system in the Sochi area by 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p780519/public_utilities/ |title=Power Supply to Be Stepped Up to Sochi by 2014 |accessdate=October 12, 2012 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012020448/http://www.kommersant.com/p780519/public_utilities/ |archive-date=October 12, 2012  }}. ''Kommersant''. July 6, 2007</ref> The power generating companies [[Inter RAO UES]] and [[RusHydro]] would have to build or modernize four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants—and the federal grid company [[FGC UES]] has to replace the Central-Shepsi electricity transmission line, which reportedly often fails in bad weather. The new power line would run partly on power towers and partly across the bottom of the Black Sea. By 2011, the power supply of the resort area would increase by 1129 MW—of which 300 MW would be used for Olympic sports facilities. "The cost of the work is estimated at 83.6&nbsp;billion rubles (about US $3.26&nbsp;billion), of which 50&nbsp;billion rubles (about US$2&nbsp;billion) will go to investments in the electricity grid," the power companies announced. They did not say how much of the bill the state would foot. In February 2007, when UES had planned to spend 48.8&nbsp;billion rubles (about US$1.9&nbsp;billion) on the Sochi area, the share the state had been ready to pay 38&nbsp;billion roubles (about US$1.48&nbsp;billion) of that.
