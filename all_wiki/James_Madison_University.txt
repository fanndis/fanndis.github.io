'''James Madison University''' (also known as '''JMU''', '''Madison''', or '''James Madison''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]], [[Virginia]]. Founded in 1908 as the '''State Normal and Industrial School for Women''' at Harrisonburg, the institution was renamed '''Madison College''' in 1938 in honor of [[James Madison|President James Madison]] and then James Madison University in 1977.<ref name="Timeline">{{cite web |url=http://www.jmu.edu/centennialcelebration/timeline.shtml|title=JMU Historical Timeline|access-date=December 5, 2006 |publisher=JMU Centennial Office}}</ref> The university is situated in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], just west of [[Massanutten Mountain]].

==History==
[[File:JMU aerial photograph, 1937.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of campus from 1937, showing the original campus plan, prior to major expansions of the campus.]]

Founded in 1908 as a [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]], James Madison University was established by the [[Virginia General Assembly]]. It was originally called '''The State Normal and Industrial School for Women''' at Harrisonburg. In 1914, the name of the university was changed to the '''State [[Normal school|Normal School]] for Women at Harrisonburg.''' At first, academic offerings included only today's equivalent of technical training or junior college courses, but authorization to award bachelor's degrees was granted in 1916. During this initial period of development, the campus plan was established and six buildings were constructed.<ref name="JMU History">{{cite news|title=History of James Madison University |url=http://www.jmu.edu/president/about/history.shtml|work=Office of the President|date=March 31, 2005| access-date=July 17, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827105522/http://www.jmu.edu/president/about/history.shtml|archive-date=August 27, 2007}}</ref>

The university became the '''State Teachers College at Harrisonburg''' in 1924 and continued under that name until 1938, when it was named '''Madison College''' in honor of [[James Madison]], the fourth [[President of the United States]], whose [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier estate]] is in nearby [[Orange, Virginia]]. In 1976, the university's name was changed to James Madison University.<ref name="JMU History" />

The first president of the university was [[Julian Ashby Burruss]]. The university opened its doors to its first student body in 1909 with an enrollment of 209 students and a faculty of 15. Its first 20 graduates received diplomas in 1911.<ref name="JMU History" />

In 1919, Burruss resigned the presidency to become president of [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Polytechnic Institute]]. [[Samuel Page Duke]] was then chosen as the school's second president. During Duke's administration, nine major buildings were constructed.<ref name="JMU History" /> Duke served as president from 1919 to 1949.

In 1946, men were first enrolled as regular day students. [[G. Tyler Miller]] became the third president in 1949, following Duke's retirement. During Miller's administration, from 1949 to 1970, the campus was enlarged by {{convert|240|acre|km2}} and 19 buildings were constructed. Major curriculum changes were made and the university was authorized to grant master's degrees in 1954.<ref name="JMU History" />

In 1966, by action of the Virginia General Assembly, the university became a coeducational institution. [[Ronald E. Carrier]], JMU's fourth president, headed the institution from 1971 to 1998. During his administration, student enrollment and the number of faculty and staff tripled, doctoral programs were authorized, more than 20 major campus buildings were constructed and national publications recognized JMU as one of the finest institutions of its type in America. Carrier Library is named after him.<ref name="JMU History" />

[[File:JMU ISAT-CS Building.jpg|thumb|The ISAT/CS Building, on the east side of campus]]

During the first decade of the 21st century, under JMU's fifth President Linwood H. Rose, the university continued to rapidly expand, not only through new construction east of [[Interstate 81 in Virginia|Interstate 81]], but also on the west side of campus. In early 2005, JMU purchased the Rockingham Memorial Hospital campus just north of the main JMU campus for over $40 million. The hospital has since moved, and JMU now occupies the site after having made substantial renovations to it.<ref name="RMH">{{cite news|first=Sarah|last=Shahmoradian|title=Legislature approves hospital purchase|url=http://www.thebreeze.org/archives/3.31.05/news/news2.shtml|work=The Breeze|date=March 31, 2005 |access-date=October 19, 2006|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927101234/http://www.thebreeze.org/archives/3.31.05/news/news2.shtml|archive-date=September 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In June 2005, the university expanded across South High Street by leasing the former Harrisonburg High School building from the City of Harrisonburg.

==Student activities and involvement==
James Madison University has over 350 clubs and organizations for students to choose from. The goal is to provide students with a unique experience that will help them to grow in community and in engagement outside of the classroom.<ref name="JMU Office of Student Activities and Involvement about page">[http://info.jmu.edu/osai/about-us/ Retrieved on February 27, 2011.]</ref>

===Organizations===

====Student Government Association====
The JMU [[Student Government Association]] (SGA) was founded in 1915 and stood as the first organization on campus. Their goal was to become an organization whose role was to be the voice for the JMU student population and advocate on behalf of the students to the administration and the rest of the community.

SGA consists of two governing bodies, the Executive Council and the Student Senate. The Executive Council consists of the [[Student government president|Student Body President]], Student Body Vice President, and SGA Treasurer, positions that are elected by the JMU Student Body each academic year. The fourth member of the Executive Council is the Speaker of the Senate who is voted on by the Student Senate. Meanwhile, the Senate consists of Academic Senators and Class Council members who form the various committees within the Senate.

SGA can be attributed to many of the traditions known to JMU, such as [[Homecoming]]'s Purple Out, Mr. and Ms. Madison, Ring Premiere, the Annual Tree Lighting, the Big Event, and SafeRides. They also vote on Front End Budgeted (FEB) organizational budgets each year as well as allocate contingency funds to other organizations throughout the school year. In 2015, the organization celebrated its 100th year since being founded.

====Marching Royal Dukes====
James Madison University has the largest collegiate marching band in the nation, with 535 members as of Fall 2018.

Bush, the NFC title game between Washington and Dallas in 1983, Bands of America Grand National Championships in 1988 and 1991.  The band has made four appearances in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]], first in 2001, again in 2008, 2013 and most recently in 2018. In the past decade, the band has taken trips to Europe during the school's winter break, featuring Athens, Dublin, Monaco, London, and Rome.<ref name="JMU-MRDs">{{cite web

==John C. Wells Planetarium==
James Madison University is home to the John C. Wells Planetarium. The planetarium first opened at JMU in 1956 under the direction of Dr. John C. Wells, head of the Physics Department. The facility was then moved to Miller Hall and renovated in 1975, later named in honor of Wells on the occasion of his retirement in 1980.<ref name=":0">James Madison University Physics Department (1979). ''The James Madison University Planetarium''. Print, retrieved from the James Madison University Archives</ref>

The planetarium seats 72 individuals within a 30-ft dome. It features a GOTO Chronos star projector together with [[Evans & Sutherland]] Digistar 5 digital projectors.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=James Madison University|year=2015|title=Visiting the John C. Wells Planetarium|url=http://www.jmu.edu/planetarium/index.shtml}}</ref> The John C. Wells Planetarium also employs students enrolled at James Madison University to operate the system and host shows to the public.

===Timeline===
* '''Late 1940s''': James Madison University, then Madison College, purchased its first planetarium to be installed in the attic of Burruss Hall<ref name=":0" />
* '''1956''': Planetarium first installed on JMU's campus by Dr. John C. Wells, who was a professor in the JMU Physics Department (1947â€“1988), Department Head (1956â€“1974), and Planetarium Curator (1979â€“1988). It was placed in the attic of Burruss Hall during the fall semester. The cost of the installation was $500 for the Spitz Model A star projector, and about $850 for the 20-ft fabric dome. Dr. John C. Wells built the console at the cost of approximately $100.<ref name=":0" /> Usage was mainly for school groups and college classes.
* '''1975''': Moved to Miller Hall, where it is still currently located. A Goto II star projector replaced the obsolete equipment in Burruss, manufactured in Japan and installed at a cost of $47,000 by Planetariums Unlimited, a branch of Viewlex Audio-Visual, Inc. The cost of $47,000 was considerably lower than the other two bids offered by Minolta and Spitz because Viewlex was preparing to cease marketing Goto planetarium projectors in the country. Spitz is now the U.S. Goto representative. The old Spitz Model A, the dome, and console were given to the [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta County]] School Division in hopes that it would be installed at the county educational center at Fishersville, VA.<ref name=":0" />
* '''1979:''' Dr. John Wells retired from the Physics Department June 30, 1979, continuing to work at the Planetarium until 1980.<ref name=":0" />
* '''1980:''' Planetarium is officially named after Dr. Wells
* '''2005''': Renovations made to the Planetarium; closed to the public for the following three years (3-year Hiatus)
* '''2008''': Renovations complete; Planetarium opened to the public, Rededicated to Dr. Wells due to his death in 2005. A Digistar 3 full-dome projector system was installed alongside GOTO, which allowed for full-dome movies in conjunction with a traditional star talk about the constellations.
* '''Summer 2013''': [[Evans & Sutherland]] Digistar 5 ultra-high definition digital projection system is added to the Planetarium.

===Usage===
In the early years of the Miller Hall Planetarium, not yet named after Dr. John Wells, all laboratories in the General Studies astronomy course met in the planetarium as well as other astronomy classes such as "Controversies in Astronomy" and "Planetary Astronomy".<ref name=":0" /> As the Planetarium grew older, it began scheduling astronomy instruction for off-campus groups. The planetarium also hosts regular public shows and special events such as Starry Nights Harrisonburg, Space Explorers Camp, and Bad Science Movie Nights as well.<ref name="James Madison University">{{cite web |title=James Madison University:John C.
