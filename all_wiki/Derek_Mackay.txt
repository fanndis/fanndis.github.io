'''Derek Mackay''' (born 1977)<ref>https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17286114.profile-derek-mackay-ex-fundie-tipped-next-snp-leader/</ref> is a Scottish politician who served as [[Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Constitution]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Economy and Fair Work]] from 2018 to 2020. A former member of the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), he has served as [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] for [[Renfrewshire North and West (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Renfrewshire North and West]] since [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011]].

Raised in [[Renfrewshire (historic)|Renfrewshire]], Mackay studied social work at the [[University of Glasgow]] but dropped out. He was elected to [[Renfrewshire Council]] in 1999 and was [[Leader of the Council]] from 2007 to 2011. Elected to the Scottish Parliament at the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election]], he served as [[Minister for Transport and Islands]] from 2011 to 2014 and [[Minister for Local Government and Planning]] from 2014 to 2016, as well as [[Scottish National Party|Chairman and Business Convener of the Scottish National Party]] from 2011 to 2018.

Mackay became Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Constitution in 2016, succeeding Deputy First Minister [[John Swinney]]. In 2018, during a Cabinet reshuffle, Mackay's post was enlarged, absorbing the responsibilities of the previous role of [[Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work]] to become [[Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Economy and Fair Work]]. In February 2020, he resigned as Finance Secretary after the [[The Sun (United Kingdom)#The Scottish Sun|''Scottish Sun'']] reported he had messaged a 16-year-old boy on [[social media]], describing the boy as "cute" and offering to meet with him. He was also suspended from the SNP to sit as an [[Independent politician|independent]] MSP.

==Early life and career==
Mackay attended Kirklandneuk Primary School and [[Renfrew High School]].<ref name="BBCwhoismackay" /> He later studied at the [[University of Glasgow]], pursuing but ultimately abandoning a course in social work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.holyrood.com/inside-politics/view,the-fixer-derek-mackay-talks-budget_12849.htm|title='The Fixer': Derek Mackay talks budget|date=4 October 2019|website=Holyrood Website}}</ref> He joined the SNP at 16 and was involved in both the [[Young Scots for Independence|youth]], where he served as National Convener from 1998â€“2002, and [[Federation of Student Nationalists|student movements]].<ref name="BBCwhoismackay">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-51397825|title=Who is Derek Mackay?|first=Philip|last=Sim|date=6 February 2020|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> He was first elected as a councillor for Renfrewshire Council at the age of 21 in 1999, making him at the time the youngest male councillor in Scotland.<ref name="BBCwhoismackay"/>

==Political career==
Mackay was first elected as a councillor in 1999, representing the Blythswood Ward on Renfrewshire Council. After his election in 1999, he won three successive ward elections and became leader of Renfrewshire Council in May 2007, taking the SNP from opposition to lead the administration for the first time.<ref name=cabsec>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.scot/about/who-runs-government/cabinet-and-ministers/cabinet-secretary-finance-economy-fair-work/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115095633/https://www.gov.scot/about/who-runs-government/cabinet-and-ministers/cabinet-secretary-finance-economy-fair-work/|archivedate=15 January 2020|title=Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Economy and Fair Work|website=[[Scottish Government]]}}</ref> He became a national figure in local government, leading the SNP group in the [[Convention of Scottish Local Authorities]] (COSLA) from 2009 to 2011.<ref name=cabsec/> He coordinated the SNP campaign in the [[2012 Scottish local elections|2012 Scottish local government elections]] and the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]].<ref name=riseandfall>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/02/06/derek-mackay-rise-fall-man-touted-scotlands-next-first-minister/|title=Derek Mackay: The rise and fall of the man touted to be Scotland's next First Minister|first=Simon|last=Johnson|date=6 February 2020|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}{{registration required}}</ref>

At the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 election]], Mackay was adopted for the new constituency of [[Renfrewshire North and West (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Renfrewshire North and West]] while also being placed third on the SNP regional list for [[West Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|West Scotland]] region. Upon his election as the constituency MSP for Renfrewshire North and West, he was placed on the [[Committees of the Scottish Parliament|Finance Committee]] and also appointed as the SNP's Business Convener and Parliamentary Liaison Officer to the Cabinet Secretary for Parliamentary Business and Government Strategy [[Bruce Crawford]] MSP.

Following a mini-reshuffle Mackay replaced [[Aileen Campbell]] as Minister for Local Government and Planning on 7 December 2011. When [[Nicola Sturgeon]] became [[First Minister of Scotland]] he was appointed as Minister for Transport and Islands.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-30138550 |title=Nicola Sturgeon announces new Scottish cabinet |work=BBC News |date=21 November 2014}}</ref>

Following the Scottish Parliament election in 2016, Mackay was promoted to the Scottish Cabinet to serve as Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Constitution.<ref name=cabsec/> After a reshuffle in June 2018, Economy and Fair Work was added to his portfolio.<ref name=cabsec/>

In June 2011, Mackay was appointed as the SNP's Business Convener (party chair), succeeding [[Bruce Crawford]]. The Business Convener is responsible for chairing the SNP's Party Conference and the National Executive Committee; overseeing the party's management, administration and operations, as well as the coordination of [[election campaign]]s; working with the Chief Executive of Headquarters in setting priorities. Mackay stepped down from the role in October 2018.

===Resignation===
On 5 February 2020, the [[The Sun (United Kingdom)#The Scottish Sun|''Scottish Sun'']] alerted the office of Nicola Sturgeon about a story they were planning to run revealing Mackay had sent a 16-year-old boy messages via [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] in which he described the boy as "cute" and offered to meet up with the boy in person.<ref name=carrell>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/07/derek-mackay-scottish-government-challenge-nicola-sturgeon-messages-the-sun|title=Sturgeon's office 'tried to stop publication of Mackay schoolboy story'|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 February 2020|first=Severin|last=Carrell}}</ref><ref name="BBC 7 February 2020">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-51411259|title=Derek Mackay's downfall: How the story unfolded|website=[[BBC News]]|date=7 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=quits>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-51397956 |title=Derek Mackay: Scottish finance secretary quits amid messages claims |work=[[BBC News]]|date=6 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/derek-mackay-quits-resigns-snp-teenage-boy-finance-secretary-latest-a9320476.html|title=Scotland's finance secretary quits after allegedly sending hundreds of messages to 16-year-old boy|date=6 February 2020|website=[[The Independent]]|first=Chris|last=Baynes}}</ref> The paper told the BBC they had been approached by the boy's mother who had become aware of the messages in the week prior.<ref name="BBC 7 February 2020"/>

The Scottish Government was accused of trying to stop publication of the ''Scottish Sun'' article, questioning the "justification" of intruding into Mackay's private life and claiming the ''Scottish'' ''Sun'' had a â€œmoral obligation" to share the material in order for them "to offer any form of substantive response or view". The paper defended its position, stating that Alan Muir, its Scottish editor, had read out the "most significant and damaging messages" to Sturgeonâ€™s office in two 15-minute phone conversations.<ref name="carrell" />

On 6 February, Mackay resigned hours before the [[Scottish budget]] was due to be announced. Sturgeon announced he had been suspended from the SNP and she had accepted his resignation, recognising his "significant contribution to government" but admitting his behaviour "failed to meet the standards required". [[Scottish Conservatives|Scottish Conservative]] acting leader [[Jackson Carlaw]] suggested the messages could "constitute the [[child grooming|grooming]] of a young individual" and called for Mackay to resign from the Scottish Parliament.<ref name=quits/>

On 8 February, [[Police Scotland]] said that it had spoken to the schoolboy and that while it had not "received any complaint of criminality", it was "assessing available information".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-51425591|title=Police speak to boy sent messages by Derek Mackay|date=8 February 2020|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> It subsequently announced that it had reviewed the case and that Mackay would not face any charges, as no laws had been broken with 16 being [[Age of consent|of age]] in Scotland.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mega|first=Marcello|date=2020-02-17|title=Police won't charge SNP text pest Derek Mackay over messages sent to boy|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-wont-charge-snp-text-21510239|access-date=2020-10-11|website=Daily Record}}</ref>

In February 2020, it was reported by a former senior SNP staff member that Nicola Sturgeon had banned Mackay from drinking at SNP conferences, because of reports around his behaviour. Mackay joked to attendees at the 2017 party conference that they would not see him later as, "Nicola won't let me".<ref>{{cite news|last=Rodger|first=Hannah|date=7 February 2020|title=Nicola Sturgeon 'banned shamed Derek Mackay from drinking at SNP conferences'|website=[[The Herald (Glasgow)]]|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18217581.nicola-sturgeon-banned-shamed-derek-mackay-drinking-snp-conferences/}}</ref><ref name="carrell" /> It was also reported that Mackay had sent unwanted private social media messages to an activist aged 21 in 2016, which continued over the next four years.<ref name="carrell" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Green|first=Chris|date=7 February 2020|title=Derek Mackay: Fresh allegations emerge about the former Finance Secretary's online behaviour|website=[[I (newspaper)]]|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/scotland/derek-mackay-fresh-allegations-emerge-about-the-former-finance-secretarys-online-behaviour-1392571}}</ref>
