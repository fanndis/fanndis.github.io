The '''National Advisory Council''' (NAC) of [[India]] was an advisory body set up by the first [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA) government to advise the Prime Minister of India. [[Sonia Gandhi]] served as its Chairperson for much of the tenure of the UPA. [[BJP]], its allies and many citizens criticised it claiming that it was unconstitutional.

The concept of a NAC has been criticised by opposition parties and some scholars as not being in keeping with India's [[constitution of India|constitution]], because of the possibility that it might emerge as an alternative [[Council of Ministers, India|cabinet]].<ref>[http://go4quiz.com/vincent/2010/india/national-advisory-council-is-unnecessary/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922120327/http://go4quiz.com/vincent/2010/india/national-advisory-council-is-unnecessary/ |date=22 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Mathew Idiculla |url=http://governancenow.com/views/columns/nac-think-tank-super-cabinet-or-unconstitutional |title=NAC: think tank, super cabinet or unconstitutional? |publisher=GovernanceNow.com |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/formation-of-nac-unconstitutional-sonia-super-pm/110695/ |title=‘Formation Of Nac Unconstitutional; Sonia Super PM’ |work=Financial Express |date=2004-07-19 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/soniabenisthemostpopularpoliticianinindia/597734/ |title=Sonia as NAC head is psuedo-Constitutional &#91;sic&#93; power centre: BJP |work=Indian Express |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2016-06-09 | quote=BJP on Tuesday said that Congress President Sonia Gandhi's appointment as Chairperson of National Advisory Council has created a 'psuedo-Constitutional power centre' which would lead to 'redundancy' of the post of Prime Minister.}}</ref> However an alternative view was that the existence of the NAC could deepen democracy by facilitating greater pre-legislative/pre-policy consultation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2011/624/624_comment.htm |title=624 Comment |publisher=India-seminar.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref> The NAC also finalised draft recommendations for a mandatory pre-legislative consultative process<ref>[http://nac.nic.in/plp_press.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812235127/http://nac.nic.in/plp_press.htm |date=12 August 2013 }}</ref> which have remarkable potential to democratise lawmaking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/laws-for-citizens-and-by-them-too/1117995/0 |title=Laws for citizens, and by them too |work=Indian Express |date=2013-05-20 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref> It was heavily criticised for drafting the communal violence bill in 2011.<ref>R.
