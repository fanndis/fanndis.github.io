}}{{History of Berlin}}

The '''fall of the Berlin Wall''' ({{lang-de|Mauerfall}}) on 9 November 1989 was a pivotal event in world history which marked the falling of the [[Iron Curtain]] and the start of the fall of communism in Eastern and Central Europe. The [[fall of the inner German border]] took place shortly afterwards. An end to the [[Cold War]] was declared at the [[Malta Summit]] three weeks later, and the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]] took place in October the following year.

==Background==
===Opening of the Iron Curtain===
{{Further|Pan-European Picnic|Removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria}}
The opening of the [[Iron Curtain]] between Austria and Hungary at the Pan-European Picnic on August 19, 1989 set in motion a peaceful chain reaction, at the end of which there was no longer an [[East Germany]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]] had disintegrated. Extensive advertising for the planned picnic was made by posters and flyers among the GDR holidaymakers in Hungary. It was the largest escape movement from East Germany since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. After the picnic, which was based on an idea by [[Otto von Habsburg]] to test the reaction of the [[USSR]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to an opening of the border, tens of thousands of media-informed East Germans set off for Hungary. [[Erich Honecker]] dictated to the ''Daily Mirror'' for the Paneuropa Picnic: "Habsburg distributed leaflets far into Poland, on which the East German holidaymakers were invited to a picnic. When they came to the picnic, they were given gifts, food and Deutsche Mark, and then they were persuaded to come to the West." The leadership of the GDR in East Berlin did not dare to completely block the borders of their own country and the USSR did not respond at all. Thus the bracket of the Eastern Bloc was broken.<ref>Otmar Lahodynsky "Eiserner Vorhang: Picknick an der Grenze" (Iron curtain: picnic at the border – German), in Profil 13 June 2019.</ref><ref>Thomas Roser: DDR-Massenflucht: Ein Picknick hebt die Welt aus den Angeln (German – Mass exodus of the GDR: A picnic clears the world) in: Die Presse 16 August 2018.</ref><ref>Andreas Rödder, Deutschland einig Vaterland – Die Geschichte der Wiedervereinigung (2009).</ref><ref>Miklós Németh in Interview, Austrian TV – ORF "Report", 25 June 2019.</ref><ref>Hilde Szabo: ''Die Berliner Mauer begann im Burgenland zu bröckeln'' (The Berlin Wall began to crumble in Burgenland – German), in Wiener Zeitung 16 August 1999; Otmar Lahodynsky: ''Paneuropäisches Picknick: Die Generalprobe für den Mauerfall'' (Pan-European picnic: the dress rehearsal for the fall of the Berlin Wall – German), in: ''Profil'' 9 August 2014.</ref><ref>Ludwig Greven "Und dann ging das Tor auf", in Die Zeit, 19 August 2014.</ref>

Following the summer 1989, by early November refugees were finding their way to [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] via Czechoslovakia or via the [[Embassy of Germany, Prague|West German embassy in Prague]]. 

The emigration was initially tolerated because of long-standing agreements with the communist Czechoslovak government, allowing free travel across their common border. However, this movement of people grew so large it caused difficulties for both countries. In addition, East Germany was struggling to meet loan payments on foreign borrowings; [[Egon Krenz]] sent [[Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski]] to unsuccessfully ask West Germany for a short-term loan to make interest payments.<ref name="Revolution1989" />{{Rp|344}}

===Political changes in East Germany===
On 18 October 1989, longtime [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) leader [[Erich Honecker]] stepped down in favor of Krenz. Honecker had been seriously ill, and those looking to replace him were initially willing to wait for a "biological solution", but by October were convinced that the political and economic situation was too grave.<ref name="Revolution1989" />{{Rp|339}} Honecker approved the choice, naming Krenz in his resignation speech,<ref>{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTG-zE6l27A |work=Honecker| title=Resignation Speech | access-date= 6 July 2019}}</ref> and the  [[Volkskammer]] duly elected him. Although Krenz promised reforms in his first public speech,<ref>{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIxKrYqo0B4 |work=zeitzeugenportal| title=Günter Schabowski: Honeckers Absetzung | access-date= 6 July 2019}}</ref> he was considered by the East German public to be following his predecessor's policies, and public protests demanding his resignation continued.<ref name="Revolution1989" />{{Rp|347}} Despite promises of reform, public opposition to the regime continued to grow.

On 1 November, Krenz authorized the reopening of the border with [[Czechoslovakia]], which had been sealed to prevent East Germans from fleeing to West Germany.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/special_report/1999/09/99/iron_curtain/timelines/egermany_93.stm |work=BBC News | title=Communism – East Germany | access-date=1 April 2010}}</ref> On 4 November the [[Alexanderplatz demonstration]] took place.{{sfn|Sarotte|2014|p=96}}

On 6 November, the Interior Ministry published a draft of new travel regulations, which made cosmetic changes to Honecker-era rules, leaving the approval process opaque and  maintaining uncertainty regarding access to foreign currency. The draft enraged ordinary citizens, and was denounced as "complete trash" by [[Governing Mayor of Berlin|West Berlin Mayor]] [[Walter Momper]].{{sfn|Sarotte|2014|p=97}} Hundreds of refugees crowded onto the steps of the West German embassy in Prague, enraging the Czechoslovaks, who threatened to seal off the East German-Czechoslovak border.{{sfn|Sarotte|2014|p=99}}

On 7 November, Krenz approved the resignation of Prime Minister [[Willi Stoph]] and two-thirds of the Politburo; however Krenz was unanimously re-elected as General Secretary by the Central Committee.<ref name="Revolution1989" />{{Rp|341}}

===New East German immigration policy===
On 19 October, Krenz asked [[:de:Gerhard Lauter|Gerhard Lauter]] to prepare a new travel policy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/1.2654876|title=Mauerfall am 9. November 1989: "Und im Übrigen: Die Grenze ist auf"|first=Stefan|last=Locke|via=www.faz.net|newspaper=Faz.net}}</ref>

At a Politburo meeting on 7 November it was decided to enact a portion of the draft travel regulations addressing permanent emigration immediately. Initially, the Politburo planned to create a special border crossing near [[Schirnding]] specifically for this emigration.{{sfn|Sarotte|2014|pp=99–100}} The Interior and [[Stasi]] bureaucrats charged with crafting the new text, however, concluded this was not feasible, and crafted a new text relating to both emigration and temporary travel. It stipulated that East German citizens could apply for permission to travel abroad without having to meet the previous requirements for those trips.{{sfn|Sarotte|2014|pp=107–108}} To ease the difficulties, the Politburo led by Krenz decided on 9 November to allow refugees to exit directly through crossing points between East Germany and West Germany, including between East and West Berlin. Later the same day, the ministerial administration modified the proposal to include private, round-trip, travel. The new regulations were to take effect the next day.<ref name="Schäfer, 2015">{{cite book | title=Deutsche Geschichte in 100 Objekten | publisher=Piper | author=Schäfer, Hermann | year=2015 | location=München, Berlin, Zürich | pages=570 | isbn=978-3-492057028}}</ref>

1. The decree from 30 November 1988 about travel abroad of East German citizens will no longer be applied until the new travel law comes into force.

2. Starting immediately, the following temporary transition regulations for travel abroad and permanent exits from East Germany are in effect:

b) The responsible departments of passport and registration control in the [[Volkspolizei|People's Police]] district offices in East Germany are instructed to issue visas for permanent exit without delays and without presentation of the existing requirements for permanent exit. It is still possible to apply for permanent exit in the departments for internal affairs [of the local district or city councils].

c) Permanent exits are possible via all East German border crossings to West Germany and (West) Berlin.

d) The temporary practice of issuing (travel) authorizations through East German consulates and permanent exit with only an East German personal identity card via third countries ceases.

3. The attached press release explaining the temporary transition regulation will be issued on 10 November.</small>

Berlin ([[Allgemeiner Deutscher Nachrichtendienst|ADN]])

As the Press Office of the Ministry of the Interior has announced, the East German Council of Ministers has decided that the following temporary transition regulation for travel abroad and permanent exit from East Germany will be effective until a corresponding law is put into effect by the [[Volkskammer]]:

1) Applications by private individuals for travel abroad can now be made without the previously existing requirements (of demonstrating a need to travel or proving familial relationships). The travel authorizations will be issued within a short period of time. Grounds for denial will only be applied in particularly exceptional cases.

2) The responsible departments of passport and registration control in the People's Police district offices in East Germany are instructed to issue visas for permanent exit without delays and without presentation of the existing requirements for permanent exit. It is still possible to apply for permanent exit in the departments for internal affairs [of the local district or city councils].

3) Permanent exits are possible via all East German border crossings to West Germany and (West) Berlin.

4) This decision revokes the temporary practice of issuing (travel) authorizations through East German consulates and permanent exit with only an East German personal identity card via third countries ceases.

===Misinformed public announcements===

Riccardo Ehrman is sitting on the floor of the podium with the table just behind him.<ref name="transcript" />]]
The announcement of the regulations which brought down the wall took place at an hour-long press conference led by [[Günter Schabowski]], the party leader in East Berlin and the top government spokesman, beginning at 18:00 CET on 9 November and broadcast live on [[Fernsehen der DDR|East German television]] and [[Radio DDR 1|radio]]. Schabowski was joined by Minister of Foreign Trade [[Gerhard Beil]] and [[Socialist_Unity_Party_of_Germany#Central_Committee|Central Committee]] members [[:de:Helga Labs|Helga Labs]] and [[:de:Manfred Banaschak|Manfred Banaschak]].<ref name="transcript" /><ref name="Revolution1989">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe|quote=isbn:9780375425325.|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|last=Sebestyen|first=Victor|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-375-42532-5|location=New York City|url-access=registration}}</ref>{{Rp|352}}

Schabowski had not been involved in the discussions about the new regulations and had not been fully updated.<ref name="Schabowski">Sarotte, Mary Elise (1 November 2009) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/30/AR2009103001846.html "How it went down: The little accident that toppled history"] ''The Washington Post''. Retrieved 2 November 2009.</ref> Shortly before the press conference, he was handed a note from Krenz announcing the changes, but given no further instructions on how to handle the information. The text stipulated that East German citizens could apply for permission to travel abroad without having to meet the previous requirements for those trips, and also allowed for permanent emigration between all border crossings—including those between East and West Berlin.{{sfn|Sarotte|2014|pp=107–108}}

At 18:53, near the end of the press conference, [[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]'s [[Riccardo Ehrman]] asked if the draft travel law of 6 November was a mistake. Schabowski gave a confusing answer that asserted it was necessary because West Germany had exhausted its capacity to accept fleeing East Germans, then remembered the note he had been given and added that a new law had been drafted to allow permanent emigration at any border crossing. This caused a stir in the room; amid several questions at once, Schabowski expressed surprise that the reporters had not yet seen this law, and started reading from the note.<ref name="transcript" /> After this, a reporter, either Ehrman or ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'' reporter Peter Brinkmann, both of whom were sitting in the front row at the press conference,<ref>Walker, Marcus (21 October 2009) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125597721400194603 "Did Brinkmannship Fell Berlin's Wall?

Crucially, a journalist then asked if the regulation also applied to the crossings to [[West Berlin]]. Schabowski shrugged and read item 3 of the note, which confirmed that it did.<ref name="yt" /><ref name="transcript" />

After this exchange, [[Daniel Johnson (journalist)|Daniel Johnson]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' asked what this law meant for the Berlin Wall. Schabowski sat frozen before giving a rambling statement about the Wall being tied to the larger disarmament question.{{sfn|Sarotte|2014|p=118}}<ref>Walker, Marcus (21 October 2009) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125597721400194603 "Did Brinkmannship Fell Berlin's Wall?

After the press conference, Schabowski sat for an interview with [[NBC]] news anchor [[Tom Brokaw]] in which he repeated that East Germans would be able to emigrate through the border and the regulations would go into effect immediately.<ref>Schabowski replied to Brokaw in broken English that East Germans were "not further forced to leave GDR by transit through another country," and could now "go through the border." When Brokaw asked if this meant "freedom of travel," Schabowski replied, "Yes of course," and added that it was not "a question of tourism," but "a permission of leaving GDR.”; Sarotte, p. 129.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/nbcnews-com/brokaw-reports-from-the-berlin-wall-337455683615|work=NBC NEWS|date=9 November 1989|title=Brokaw reports from the Berlin Wall|access-date=18 June 2019}}</ref>

===Spreading news===
[[File:Dpa-Eilmeldung_zum_Mauerfall,_09.11.1989.jpg|thumb|right|DPA bulletin]]
The news began spreading immediately: the West German [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] issued a bulletin at 19:04 which reported that East German citizens would be able to cross the inner German border "immediately". Excerpts from Schabowski's press conference were broadcast on West Germany's two main news programs that night—at 19:17 on [[ZDF]]'s ''[[heute]]'', which came on the air as the press conference was ending, and as the lead story at 20:00 on [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]'s ''[[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]]''. As ARD and ZDF had broadcast to [[Tal der Ahnungslosen|nearly all of East Germany]] since the late 1950s, were far more widely viewed than the East German channels, and had become accepted by the East German authorities, this is how most of the population heard the news. Later that night, on ARD's ''[[Tagesthemen]]'', anchorman [[Hanns Joachim Friedrichs]] proclaimed, "This 9 November is a historic day. The GDR has announced that, starting immediately, its borders are open to everyone. The gates in the Wall stand open wide."<ref name="Revolution1989" />{{Rp|353}}<ref name="Schabowski" />

In 2009, Ehrman claimed that a member of the Central Committee had called him and urged him to ask about the travel law during the press conference, but Schabowski called that absurd.<ref name="time_stephanie_kirchner_2009_04_19" /> Ehrman later recanted this statement in a 2014 interview with an Austrian journalist, admitting that the caller was [[:de:Günter Pötschke|Günter Pötschke]], head of the East German news agency [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Nachrichtendienst|ADN]], and he only asked if Ehrman would attend the press conference.<ref>{{cite news |title=Der verschwiegene Mauerfall |url=https://www.diepresse.com/4574715/der-verschwiegene-mauerfall |work=Die Presse |date=31 October 2014 |language=de}}</ref>

===Crowding of the border===
After hearing the broadcast, East Germans began gathering at the Wall, at the [[Berlin border crossings#Border crossings up to 1990|six checkpoints between East and West Berlin]], demanding that [[border guard]]s immediately open the gates.<ref name="Schabowski" /> The surprised and overwhelmed guards made many hectic telephone calls to their superiors about the problem. At first, they were ordered to find the "more aggressive" people gathered at the gates and stamp their passports with a special stamp that barred them from returning to East Germany—in effect, revoking their citizenship. However, this still left thousands of people demanding to be let through "as Schabowski said we can".<ref name="Revolution1989" />{{Rp|353}} It soon became clear that no one among the East German authorities would take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force, so the vastly outnumbered soldiers had no way to hold back the huge crowd of East German citizens. [[Mary Elise Sarotte]] in a 2009 ''Washington Post'' story characterized the series of events leading to the fall of the wall as an accident, saying "One of the most momentous events of the past century was, in fact, an accident, a semicomical and bureaucratic mistake that owes as much to the Western media as to the tides of history."<ref name="Schabowski" />

===Border openings===
Finally, at 10:45&nbsp;p.m. (alternatively given as 11:30&nbsp;p.m.) on 9 November, [[Harald Jäger]], commander of the [[Bornholmer Straße border crossing]], yielded, allowing guards to open the checkpoints and letting people through with little or no identity-checking.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Guard Who Opened the Berlin Wall: 'I Gave my People the Order – Raise the Barrier'|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-guard-who-opened-the-berlin-wall-i-gave-my-people-the-order-raise-the-barrier-a-660128.html| access-date=14 October 2014| work=[[Spiegel Online]]| date=9 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Wroe|first1=David|title=It was the best and worst night|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/theberlinwall/2009/11/2009117102629473523.html|access-date=14 October 2014|publisher=[[Al Jazeera America]]|date=8 November 2009}}</ref> As the ''[[Ossi (East Germans)|Ossis]]'' swarmed through, they were greeted by ''[[Wessi]]s'' waiting with flowers and champagne amid wild rejoicing.

==="Wallpeckers" demolition===
[[File:Berlin Wall segment in Los Angeles.webm|thumb|upright=1.4|A Berlin Wall segment in Los Angeles at 5900 Wilshire Boulevard. 46 second video]]

Removal of the Wall began on the evening of 9 November 1989 and continued over the following days and weeks, with people nicknamed {{lang|de|Mauerspechte}} (wallpeckers) using various tools to chip off souvenirs, demolishing lengthy parts in the process, and creating several unofficial border crossings.<ref name="History.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/berlin-wall|title=Berlin Wall|publisher=History.com|access-date=19 June 2013}}</ref>

Television coverage of citizens demolishing sections of the Wall on 9 November was soon followed by the East German regime announcing ten new [[Berlin Border Crossings|border crossings]], including the historically significant locations of [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[Glienicker Brücke]], and [[Bernauer Straße]]. Crowds gathered on both sides of the historic crossings waiting for hours to cheer the bulldozers that tore down portions of the Wall to reconnect the divided roads. While the Wall officially remained guarded at a decreasing intensity, new border crossings continued for some time.  Initially the [[Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic|East German Border Troops]] attempted repairing damage done by the "wallpeckers"; gradually these attempts ceased, and guards became more lax, tolerating the increasing demolitions and "unauthorized" border crossing through the holes.{{sfn|Sarotte|2014|pp=xx–xxi}}

===Prime ministers meet===
The [[Brandenburg Gate]] in the Berlin Wall was opened on 22 December 1989; on that date, West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] walked through the gate and was greeted by East German Prime Minister [[Hans Modrow]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/22/newsid_2539000/2539765.stm|title=1989: Brandenburg Gate re-opens|date=22 December 1989|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>  West Germans and West Berliners were allowed visa-free travel starting 23 December.{{sfn|Sarotte|2014|pp=xx–xxi}} Until then, they could only visit East Germany and East Berlin under restrictive conditions that involved application for a visa several days or weeks in advance and obligatory exchange of at least 25 [[Deutsche mark|DM]] per day of their planned stay, all of which hindered spontaneous visits. Thus, in the weeks between 9 November and 23 December, East Germans could actually travel more freely than Westerners.{{sfn|Sarotte|2014|pp=xx–xxi}}

===Official demolition===
On 13 June 1990, the East German Border Troops officially began dismantling the Wall,<ref name="Chicago Tribune 1">{{cite web| url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-myths-berlin-wall-fall-reagan-east-west-perspec-1102-20141031-story.html| title= Untangling 5 myths about the Berlin Wall| work= [[Chicago Tribune]]| date= 31 October 2014| access-date= 1 November 2014}}</ref><ref name="25ago">{{cite news| title= In Photos: 25 years ago today the Berlin Wall Fell| url= http://www.thejournal.ie/berlin-wall-anniversary-1762450-Nov2014/| date= 9 November 2014| work= [[TheJournal.ie]]}}</ref> beginning in [[Bernauer Straße]] and around the Mitte district. From there, demolition continued through Prenzlauer Berg/Gesundbrunnen, Heiligensee and throughout the city of Berlin until December 1990. According to estimates by the border troops, a total of around 1.7&nbsp;million tonnes of building rubble was produced by the demolition. Unofficially, the demolition of the [[Bornholmer Straße]] began because of construction work on the railway. This involved a total of 300 GDR border guards and—after 3 October 1990—600 Pioneers of the Bundeswehr. These were equipped with 175 trucks, 65 cranes, 55 excavators and 13 bulldozers. Virtually every road that was severed by the Berlin Wall, every road that once linked from West Berlin to East Berlin, was reconstructed and reopened by 1 August 1990. In Berlin alone, {{cvt|184|km}} of wall, {{cvt|154|km}} border fence, {{cvt|144|km}} signal systems and {{cvt|87|km}} barrier ditches were removed. What remained were six sections that were to be preserved as a memorial. Various military units dismantled the Berlin/Brandenburg border wall, completing the job in November 1991. Painted wall segments with artistically valuable motifs were put up for auction in 1990 in [[Berlin]] and [[Monte Carlo]].{{sfn|Sarotte|2014|pp=xx–xxi}}

On 1 July 1990, the day East Germany adopted the [[Deutsche Mark|West German currency]], all ''de jure'' border controls ceased, although the inter-German border had become meaningless for some time before that.{{sfn|Sarotte|2014|pp=189–190}} The demolition of the Wall was completed in 1992.<ref name="Chicago Tribune 1" /><ref name="25ago" />

The fall of the Wall marked the first critical step towards [[German reunification]], which formally concluded a mere 339 days later on 3 October 1990 with the dissolution of East Germany and the official reunification of the German state along the democratic lines of the West German [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]].<ref name="History.com" />

===International opposition===
[[French President]] [[François Mitterrand]] and British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] both opposed the fall of the Berlin Wall and the eventual reunification of Germany, fearing potential German designs on its neighbours using its increased strength. In September 1989, Margaret Thatcher privately confided to [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] that she wanted the Soviet leader to do what he could to stop it.<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news |last1=Roberts |first1=Andrew |title=Was Margaret Thatcher right to fear a united Germany? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/6179595/Was-Margaret-Thatcher-right-to-fear-a-united-Germany.html |access-date=24 May 2020 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=13 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6829735.ece |title=Thatcher told Gorbachev Britain did not want German reunification |access-date=8 November 2009 |date=11 September 2009 |work=[[The Times]] |location=London |first1=Ruth |last1=Gledhill |first2=Simon |last2=de Bruxelles}}</ref>

On 9 November 2009, Berlin celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall with a "Festival of Freedom" with dignitaries from around the world in attendance for an evening celebration around the Brandenburg Gate. A high point was when over 1,000 colourfully designed foam domino tiles, each over {{convert|8|ft|m}} tall, that were stacked along the former route of the Wall in the city center were toppled in stages, converging in front of the Brandenburg Gate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mauerfall09.de |title=20 Jahre Mauerfall |access-date=9 April 2009 | author=unknown | year=2009| publisher=Kulturprojekte Berlin GmbH|language=de}}</ref>

An international project called ''Mauerreise'' (Journey of the Wall) took place in various countries. Twenty symbolic Wall bricks were sent from Berlin starting in May 2009, with the destinations being Korea, Cyprus, Yemen, and other places where everyday life is characterised by division and border experience. In these places, the bricks would become a blank canvas for artists, intellectuals and young people to tackle the "wall" phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/ges/prj/mar/enindex.htm |title=The Wall in the World 2009 – 20th anniversary of the Fall of the Wall – Goethe-Institut |publisher=Goethe.de |access-date=9 November 2009}}</ref>
