The "West Bank" name was given to the territory after it was captured by [[Jordan]] in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] because it sits on the west side of the [[Jordan river]].

The name ''West Bank'' is a translation of the Arabic term ''ad-Diffah I-Garbiyyah'', given to the territory west of the [[Jordan River]] that fell, in 1948, under occupation and administration by [[Jordan]], which subsequently [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|annexed]] it in 1950. This annexation was considered illegal and was recognized only by Britain, Iraq and Pakistan.<ref>[[Eyal Benvenisti]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JKgeX_sdQG0C&pg=PA204 ''The International Law of Occupation''], Oxford University Press 2012 p. 204:"The so-called West Bank (of the Jordan river), including the eastern part of Jerusalem, has been since 1948 under Jordanian administration, and Jordan claimed to have annexed it in 1950. This purported annexation of parts of the former Mandatory Palestine was, however, widely regarded, including by the Arab League, as illegal and void, and was recognized only by Britain, Iraq and Pakistan."</ref> The term was chosen to differentiate the west bank of the River Jordan from the "[[East Bank|east bank]]" of this river.

===Cisjordan===
The neo-[[Latin]] name ''Cisjordan'' or ''Cis-Jordan'' (literally "on this side of the River Jordan") is the usual name for the territory in the [[Romance languages]] and [[:hu:Ciszjordánia|Hungarian]]. The name ''West Bank'', however, has become the standard usage for this [[geopolitical]] entity in English and some of the other Germanic languages since its creation following the [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian army's conquest]].

In English, the name ''Cisjordan'' is occasionally used to designate the entire region between the [[Jordan River]] and the Mediterranean, particularly in the historical context of the British Mandate and earlier times.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The analogous ''[[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]]'' (literally "on the other side of the River Jordan") has historically been used to designate the region now roughly comprising the state of Jordan, which lies to the east of the Jordan River.

From 1517 through 1917, the area now known as the West Bank was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule as part of the provinces of [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]].

[[File:Cave of the Patriarchs8.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|The Cave of the Patriarchs is one of the most famous holy sites in the region.]]
At the 1920 [[San Remo conference]], the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] (France, UK, USA, etc.) allocated the area to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] (1920–47). The San Remo Resolution adopted on 25 April 1920 incorporated the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Balfour Declaration]] of 1917. It and Article 22 of the Covenant of the [[League of Nations]] were the basic documents upon which the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] was constructed. The British proclaimed [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]] [[emir]] of [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] on 11 April 1921. He declared it an independent Hashemite kingdom on 25 May 1946.

In 1947, it was subsequently designated as part of a proposed Arab state by the [[United Nations]] (UN) [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partition plan for Palestine]]. The [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181|resolution]] recommended partition of the British Mandate into a Jewish State, an Arab State, and an [[corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|internationally administered enclave of Jerusalem]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7f0af2bd897689b785256c330061d253 |title=A/RES/181(II) of 29 November 1947 |work=domino.un.org |year=1947 |accessdate=9 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524094913/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7f0af2bd897689b785256c330061d253 |archive-date=24 May 2012 }}</ref> a broader region of the modern-day West Bank was assigned to the Arab State.

A two-state option, dividing Palestine, as opposed to a binary solution arose during the [[Mandatory Palestine|period of the British mandate]] in the area. The United Nations Partition Plan had envisaged two states, one Jewish and the other Arab/Palestinian, but in the wake of the war only one emerged at the time.<ref>Rochelle Davis, Mimi Kirk (eds.)

Many refugees continued to live in camps and relied on [[UNRWA]] assistance for sustenance. Palestinian refugees constituted more than a third of the kingdom's population of 1.5&nbsp;million.
The last Jordanian elections in which West Bank residents would vote were those of April 1967, but their parliamentary representatives would continue in office until 1988, when West Bank seats were finally abolished. Palestinians enjoyed equal opportunities in all sectors of the state without discrimination.<ref name=jifa />
Agriculture remained the primary activity of the territory. The West Bank, despite its smaller area, contained half of Jordan's agricultural land. In 1966, 43% of the labor force of 55,000 worked in agriculture, and 2,300&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> were under cultivation. In 1965, 15,000 workers were employed in industry, producing 7% of the GNP. This number fell after the 1967 war, and would not be surpassed until 1983.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.rviewer.com/main/articles/Chapter8.html |title=Assessing the Viability of a Palestinian State |author=Paul H.

On the eve of occupation the West Bank accounted for 40% of Jordanian GNP, between 34% and 40% of its agricultural output and almost half of its manpower, though only a third of Jordanian investment was allocated to it and mainly to the private housing construction sector.{{sfn|Mansour|2015|pp=73–74}} Though its per-capita product was 10 times greater than that of the West Bank, the Israeli economy on the eve of occupation had experienced two years (1966-1967) of a sharp recession. Immediately after the occupation, from 1967 to 1974, the economy boomed. In 1967 the Palestinian economy had a gross domestic product of $1,349 per capita for a million people,{{sfn|Unctad|2016|p=5}} with the West Bank population at 585,500,{{efn|According to Mansour, the population stood at 803,600,{{sfn|Mansour|2015|p=71}}}} of whom 18% were refugees, and was growing annually by 2%. West Bank growth, compared to Gaza (3%), had lagged, due to the effect of mass emigration of West Bankers seeking employment in Jordan.{{sfn|Tuma|Darin-Drabkin|1978|pp=47,50}} As agriculture gave way to industrial development in Israel, in the West Bank the former still generated 37% of domestic product, and industry a mere 13%.{{sfn|Van Arkadie|1977|p=104}}

The growth rate of the West Bank economy in the period of the Jordanian Occupation of the West Bank before Israeli occupation had ticked along at an annual rate of 6-8%. This rate of growth was indispensable if the post-war West Bank were to achieve [[Self-sustainability|economic self-reliance]]. 80% of Jordan's fruit-growing land and 40% of its vegetables lay in the West Bank, and, with the onset of the occupation, the area could no longer produce export earnings.{{sfn|Cooley|1984|p=13}}

===Israeli Military Governorate and Civil Administration===
{{main|Israeli Military Governorate|Israeli Civil Administration}}
In June 1967, the West Bank and [[East Jerusalem]] were captured by Israel as a result of the [[Six-Day War]]. With the exception of East Jerusalem and the former [[No man's land (West Bank)#Israel–Jordan|Israeli-Jordanian no man's land]], the West Bank was not [[Annexation|annexed]] by Israel; it remained under [[Israeli Military Governorate|Israeli military control]] until 1982.

Although the [[1974 Arab League summit]] resolution at [[Rabat]] designated the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO) as the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people", Jordan did not officially relinquish its claim to the area until 1988,<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWhgIe3Hq98C&pg=PA247| title= The Palestine Yearbook of International Law 1987-1988| editor= Anis F.

In 1982, as a result of the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|Israeli{{ndash}}Egyptian peace treaty]], the direct military rule was transformed into a [[Israeli Civil Administration|semi-civil authority]], operating directly under the Israeli Ministry of Defense, thus taking control of civil matters of Palestinians from the IDF to civil servants in the Ministry of Defense. The Israeli settlements were, on the other hand, administered subsequently as [[Judea and Samaria Area]] directly by Israel.

Since the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]], the [[Palestinian Authority]] officially controls a geographically non-contiguous territory comprising approximately 11% of the West Bank (known as [[Area A]]) which remains subject to Israeli incursions. Area B (approximately 28%) is subject to joint Israeli-Palestinian military and Palestinian civil control. [[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]] (approximately 61%) is under full Israeli control.

After the [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|2007 split]] between [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]], the West Bank areas under [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian control]] are an exclusive part of the Palestinian Authority, while the [[Gaza Strip]] is [[Hamas Government in Gaza|ruled by Hamas]].

===Early economic impact===
The Jordanians neglected to invest much in the area during their time governing the area, although there was some investment in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem.

Soon after the 1967 war, [[Yigal Allon]] produced the [[Allon Plan]], which would have annexed a strip along the Jordan River valley and excluded areas closer to the pre-1967 border, which had a high density of Palestinians. [[Moshe Dayan]] proposed a plan which [[Gershom Gorenberg]] likens to a "photo negative of Allon's."{{efn|"In fact, Dayan had submitted his own secret plan. Predictably, it was the photo negative of Allon's. The mountain ridge – not the lowlands along the Jordan – was the strategic land Israel needed, Dayan asserted."{{sfn|Gorenberg|2007|pp=81–83}}}} The Allon plan evolved over a period of time to include more territory. The final draft dating from 1970 would have annexed about half of the West Bank.{{sfn|Lein|Weizman|2002|pp=12–13}} Israel had no overall approach for integrating the West Bank:{{efn|[[Ilan Pappe]] holds a dissenting view, claiming that a Shacham Plan existed for the occupation and administration of the West Bank before 1967.{{sfn|Pappe|2017}}}}

The early occupation set severe limits on public investment and comprehensive development programmes in the territories. British and Arab commercial banks operating in the West Bank were closed down soon after Israel assumed power there. [[Bank Leumi]] then opened nine branches, without successfully replacing the earlier system. Farmers could get loans, but Palestinian businessmen avoided taking out loans from them since they charged 9% compared to 5% interest in Jordan.{{sfn|Cohen|1985|p=245}}{{sfn|Van Arkadie|1977|pp=112–113}} By June 1967, only a third of West Bank land had been registered under Jordan's ''Settlement of Disputes over Land and Water Law'' and in 1968 Israel moved to cancel the possibility of registering one's title with the Jordanian Land Register.{{sfn|Nicoletti|Hearne|2012|p=14}} [[Ian Lustick]] states that Israel "virtually prevented" Palestinian investment in local industry and agriculture.{{sfn|Lustick|2018|p=11}} At the same time, Israel encouraged Arab labour to enter into Israel's economy, and regarded them as a new, expanded and protected market for Israeli exports. Limited export of Palestinian goods to Israel was allowed.{{sfn|Van Arkadie|1977|pp=104,111}} Expropriation of prime agricultural land in an economy where two thirds of the workforce had farmed is believed to account for the flight of labourers to work in Israel.{{sfn|Kadri|1998|p=518}} As much as 40% of the workforce commuted to Israel on a daily basis finding only poorly paid menial employment.{{sfn|Bergman|2018|p=309}} Remittances from labourers earning a wage in Israel were the major factor in Palestinian economic growth during the 1969–73 boom years,{{sfn|Van Arkadie|1977|p=110}} but the migration of workers from the territories had a negative impact on local industry by creating an internal labour scarcity in the West Bank and consequent pressure for higher wages there;{{sfn|Van Arkadie|1977|pp=110–111}} the contrast between the quality of their lives and Israelis' growing prosperity stoked resentment.{{sfn|Bergman|2018|p=309}}

Attempting to impose governmental authority, Israel established a licensing system according to which no industrial plant could be built without obtaining a prior Israeli permit. With Military Order No. 393 (14 June 1970), the local commander was given the power and authority to block any construction if, in his evaluation, the building might pose a danger to Israel's security. The overall effect was to obstruct manufacturing development and subordinate any local industrial activity to the exigencies of Israel's economy, or to block the creation of industries that might compete with Israel's. For example, entrepreneurs were denied a permit for a cement factory in Hebron. In order to protect Israeli farmers, melon production was forbidden, imports of grapes and dates were banned, and limits were set to how many cucumbers and tomatoes could be produced.{{sfn|Quigley|2005|p=186}} Israeli milk producers exerted pressure on the [[Ministry of Economy (Israel)|Ministry for Industry and Trade]] to stop the establishment of a competitive dairy in [[Ramallah]].{{sfn|El-Farra|MacMillen|2000|pp=161–161}}

The sum effect after two decades was that 15% of all Palestinian firms in the West Bank (and Gaza) employing over eight people, and 32% with seven or less, were prohibited from selling their products in Israel.{{sfn|El-Farra|MacMillen|2000|p=164}} Israeli [[Protectionism|protectionist policies]] thus distorted wider trade relations to the point that, by 1996, 90% of all West Bank imports came from Israel, with consumers paying more than they would for comparable products had they been able to exercise commercial autonomy.{{sfn|Kadri|1998|pp=517–518}}

From 1517 to 1917 the West Bank was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Turkey, successor state to the Ottoman Empire, [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|renounced]] its territorial claims in 1923, signing the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]], and the area now called the West Bank became an integral part of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]].

The future status of the West Bank, together with the [[Gaza Strip]] on the Mediterranean shore, has been the subject of negotiation between the Palestinians and Israelis, although the 2002 [[Road Map for Peace]], proposed by the "[[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]]" comprising the United States, Russia, the [[European Union]], and the United Nations, envisions an independent Palestinian state in these territories living side by side with [[Israel]] (see also [[proposals for a Palestinian state]]). However, the "Road Map" states that in the first phase, Palestinians must end all attacks on Israel, whereas Israel must dismantle all outposts.

The [[Palestinian Authority]] believes that the West Bank ought to be a part of their sovereign nation, and that the presence of Israeli military control is a violation of their right to Palestinian Authority rule. The United Nations calls the West Bank and Gaza Strip ''[[Israeli-occupied territories]]''. The United States State Department also refers to the territories as ''occupied''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3464.htm |title=Jordan (03/08) |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=9 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/t/pm/64711.htm |title=Israel |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=9 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90212.htm#OT |title=Israel and the Occupied Territories |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=9 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The 1993 [[Oslo Accords]] declared the final status of the West Bank to be subject to a forthcoming settlement between [[Israel]] and the Palestinian leadership. Following these interim accords, Israel withdrew its military rule from some parts of the West Bank, which was divided into three [[administrative divisions of the Oslo Accords]]:

Through the [[Jerusalem Law]], Israel extended its administrative control over [[East Jerusalem]].

:"Between the Jordan and the Mediterranean there is no longer a clear Jewish majority. And so, fellow citizens, it is not possible to keep the whole thing without paying a price. We cannot keep a Palestinian majority under an Israeli boot and at the same time think ourselves the only democracy in the Middle East.

Typical of these is UN Security Council resolution 446 which states ''[the] practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity'', and it calls on Israel ''as the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by the [[Fourth Geneva Convention|1949 Fourth Geneva Convention]].''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/d744b47860e5c97e85256c40005d01d6/ba123cded3ea84a5852560e50077c2dc |title=UNSC Resolution 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510095515/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/d744b47860e5c97e85256c40005d01d6/ba123cded3ea84a5852560e50077c2dc |archive-date=10 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention held in Geneva on 5 December 2001 called upon "the Occupying Power to fully and effectively respect the Fourth Geneva Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to refrain from perpetrating any violation of the Convention." The High Contracting Parties reaffirmed "the illegality of the settlements in the said territories and of the extension thereof."<ref>[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList325/D86C9E662022D64E41256C6800366D55 Implementation of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied Palestinian territories: history of a multilateral process (1997–2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929074057/http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList325/D86C9E662022D64E41256C6800366D55 |date=29 September 2006 }}, ''International Review of the Red Cross'', 2002 – No. 847.</ref>

The West Bank is further divided into 8 administrative regions: Menashe ([[Jenin]] area), HaBik'a ([[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]), [[Samaria|Shomron]] ([[Shechem]] area, known in Arabic as [[Nablus]]), Efrayim ([[Tulkarm]] area), Binyamin ([[Ramallah]]/[[al-Bireh]] area), Maccabim ([[Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut|Maccabim]] area), [[Gush Etzion|Etzion]] ([[Bethlehem]] area) and [[Judea|Yehuda]] ([[Hebron]] area).

== Crossing points ==

[[Allenby Bridge]], or ‘King Hussein Bridge’, is the main port for the Palestinian in the West Bank to the Jordanian borders. This crossing point is controlled by Israel since 1967. It was inaugurated on 11 December 2011 under the military order "175" entitled ‘An order concerning transition station’. Later, Order ‘446’ was issued which annexed the [[Damia Bridge]] crossing point to the Allenby Bridge as a commercial crossing point only. Goods were exported to Jordan, while the import was banned for security purposes.<ref name="Euro-Mid">{{cite web|url=http://www.euromid.org/uploads/reports/Restricted_Hopes.pdf|title=Restricted Hopes: On The Breach Of West Bank Palestinians' Right To Travel By Israeli Authorities|date=December 2011|publisher=Euro-Mediterranean Observer for Human Rights|accessdate=16 December 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102018/http://www.euromid.org/uploads/reports/Restricted_Hopes.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 1993, the Palestinian National Authority, according to Oslo Accord assigned by PLO and the Israeli government, became a partial supervisor over the [[Rafah Border Crossing]] to Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Authority was responsible for issuing passports to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. However, Israel remained the major responsible party for this crossing point. According to the agreement, Israel has the right to independently inspect luggage and to maintain security. In addition, it can prevent anyone from using the crossing.<ref name="Euro-Mid"/><ref>{{Cite journal|title = معبر الكرامة – نبذة تاريخية|last = المرصد الأورومتوسطي لحقوق الإنسان|date = 15 December 2015|journal = آمال مقيدة|language=ar}}</ref>

{{Main|Economy of the Palestinian territories}}
As of the early-21st century, the economy of the Palestinian territories is chronically depressed, with [[unemployment]] rates constantly over 20% since 2000 (19% in the West Bank in first half of 2013).<ref name=AUS2922p2a>{{cite web |url= http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/10/18836847/west-bank-gaza-area-c-future-palestinian-economy |title= West Bank and Gaza – Area C and the future of the Palestinian economy |page= 2 |date= 2 October 2013 |publisher= World Bank |quote= Consequently, unemployment rates have remained very high in the Palestinian territories...After initial post-Oslo rates of about 9 percent in the mid-1990s, unemployment rose to 28 percent of the labor force in 2000 with the onset of the second intifada and the imposition of severe movement and access restrictions; it has remained high ever since and is currently about 22 percent. What is more, almost 24 percent of the workforce is employed by the PA, an uncommonly high proportion that reflects the lack of dynamism in the private sector. |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140801210703/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/01/23/000442464_20140123122135/Rendered/PDF/AUS29220REPLAC0EVISION0January02014.pdf |archive-date= 1 August 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

==Consequences of occupation==

===Economic consequences===
According to a 2013 World Bank report, Israeli restrictions hinder Palestinian economic development in Area C of the West Bank.<ref name=AUS2922p2b>{{cite web |url= http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/10/18836847/west-bank-gaza-area-c-future-palestinian-economy |title= West Bank and Gaza – Area C and the future of the Palestinian economy |page= 2 |date= 2 October 2013 |publisher= World Bank |quote= While internal Palestinian political divisions have contributed to investor aversion to the Palestinian territories, Israeli restrictions on trade, movement and access are clearly the binding constraint to investment: these restrictions substantially increase the cost of trade and make it impossible to import many production inputs into the Palestinian territories, as illustrated, for instance, on the example of the telecommunications sector. For Gaza, the restrictions on import and export are in particular severe. In addition to the restrictions on labor movement between the Palestinian territories, the restrictions on movement of labor within the West Bank have been shown to have a strong impact on employability, wages, and economic growth. Israeli restrictions render much economic activity very difficult or impossible to conduct on about 61 percent of the West Bank territory, called Area C. Restrictions on movement and access, and the stunted potential of Area C. |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140801210703/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/01/23/000442464_20140123122135/Rendered/PDF/AUS29220REPLAC0EVISION0January02014.pdf |archive-date= 1 August 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> A 2013 [[World Bank]] report calculates that, if the [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip|Interim Agreement]] was respected and restrictions lifted, a few key industries alone would produce US$2.2&nbsp;billion per annum more (or 23% of 2011 Palestinian GDP) and reduce by some US$800&nbsp;million (50%) the Palestinian Authority's deficit; the employment would increase by 35%.<ref name=AUS2922pviii>{{cite web |url= http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/10/18836847/west-bank-gaza-area-c-future-palestinian-economy |title= West Bank and Gaza – Area C and the future of the Palestinian economy |page= viii |date= 2 October 2013 |publisher= World Bank |quote= [...] assumed that the various physical, legal, regulatory and bureaucratic constraints that currently prevent investors from obtaining construction permits, and accessing land and water resources are lifted, as envisaged under the Interim Agreement. [...] It is understood that realizing the full potential of such investments requires other changes as well – first, the rolling back of the movement and access restrictions in force outside Area C, which prevent the easy export of Palestinian products and inhibit tourists and investors from accessing Area C; and second, further reforms by the Palestinian Authority to better enable potential investors to register businesses, enforce contracts, and acquire finance. [...] Neglecting indirect positive effects, we estimate that the potential additional output from the sectors evaluated in this report alone would amount to at least USD 2.2 billion per annum in valued added terms – a sum equivalent to 23 percent of 2011 Palestinian GDP. The bulk of this would come from agriculture and Dead Sea minerals exploitation. [...] x. Tapping this potential output could dramatically improve the PA's fiscal position. Even without any improvements in the efficiency of tax collection, at the current rate of tax/GDP of 20 percent the additional tax revenues associated with such an increase in GDP would amount to some USD 800 million. Assuming that expenditures remain at the same level, this extra resource would notionally cut the fiscal deficit by half – significantly reducing the need for donor recurrent budget support. This major improvement in fiscal sustainability would in turn generate significant positive reputational benefits for the PA and would considerably enhance investor confidence. xi. The impact on Palestinian livelihoods would be impressive. An increase in GDP equivalent to 35 percent would be expected to create substantial employment, sufficient to put a significant dent in the currently high rate of unemployment. If an earlier estimated one-to-one relationship between growth and employment was to hold, this increase in GDP would lead to a 35 percent increase in employment. This level of growth in employment would also put a large dent in poverty, as recent estimates show that unemployed Palestinians are twice as likely to be poor as their employed counterparts. |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140801210703/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/01/23/000442464_20140123122135/Rendered/PDF/AUS29220REPLAC0EVISION0January02014.pdf |archive-date= 1 August 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

===Water supply===
{{main|Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories}}
Amnesty International has criticized the way that the Israeli state is dealing with the regional water resources:

{{quote|Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) do not have access to adequate, safe water supplies...Discriminatory Israeli policies in the OPT are the root cause of the striking disparity in access to water between Palestinians and Israelis...The inequality is even more pronounced between Palestinian communities and unlawful Israeli settlements, established in the OPT in violation of international law. Swimming pools, well-watered lawns and large irrigated farms in Israeli settlements in the OPT stand in stark contrast next to Palestinian villages whose inhabitants struggle even to meet their essential domestic water needs. In parts of the West Bank, Israeli settlers use up to 20 times more water per capita than neighbouring Palestinian communities, who survive on barely 20 litres of water per capita a day– the minimum amount recommended by the WHO for emergency situations response.<ref>[http://www.amnesty.eu/static/Water_report_digest.pdf Amnesty International Report on water supply in the West Bank (summary)] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170318144348/http://www.amnesty.eu/static/Water_report_digest.pdf |date=18 March 2017 }}, p. 2, Retrieved 03.15.2017</ref>}}

Israeli settlers in the West Bank have seized dozens of [[well]]s from Palestinians.

===Israeli garbage disposal===
Israel ratified the international [[Basel Convention]] treaty on Israel on 14 December 1994, according to which, any transfer of waste must be performed with an awareness of the dangers posed to the disempowered occupied people. It forbids the creation among them of "environmental sacrifice zones."{{sfn|Aloni|2017|p=16}} Israel, it is argued, uses the West Bank as a "sacrifice" zone for placing 15 waste treatment plants, which are there under less stringent rules that those required in Israel because a different legal system has been organized regarding hazardous materials that can be noxious to local people and the environment. The military authorities do not render public the details of these operations. These materials consist of such things as sewage sludge, infectious medical waste, used oils, solvents, metals, electronic waste and batteries.{{sfn|Aloni|2017|pp=5–6}}

In 2007 it was estimated that 38% (35 mcm a year) of all wastewater flowing into the West Bank derived from settlements and Jerusalem.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|p=7}} Of the 121 settlements surveyed, 81 had wastewater treatrment plant, much of it inadequate or subject to breakdown, with much sewage flowing into lowland streams and terrain where Palestinian villages are located. Only 4 of 53 indictments for waste pollution were made over the years from 2000 to 2008, whereas in Israel the laws are strictly applied and, in 2006 alone, 230 enforcements for the same abuse were enforced.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|pp=8–12}} At the same time 90–95% of Palestinian wastewater was not treated, with only 1 of 4 Israeli plants built in the 1970s to that purpose functioning, and the neglect to improve the infrastructure is attributed to Israeli budgetary problems.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|pp=19–21}} After the Oslo Accords, the global community earmarked $250,000,000 for West Bank wastewater infrastructure. Israel at times insisted its approval was conditional on linking the grid to Israeli settlements, which neither the donors nor Palestinians accepted. Most of the infrastructure was subsequently destroyed by IDF military operations.{{sfn|Weizman|2012|p=273,n.11}} The PA did raise funds from Germany for 15 plants, but only managed to build one, at [[al-Bireh]], within Area B, though even there Israel insisted the plant process waste from the settlement of [[Psagot]], though refusing to pay fees for the treatment.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|pp=19–21}} Palestinian towns like [[Salfit]] have been deeply affected by sewage overflow channeled past the town from the settlement of Ariel.{{sfn|Ashly|2017}}{{sfn|Weizman|2012|p=273,n.14}}

Unlike the data available for sewage treatment within Israel, the Israeli Water Commission refuses to provide public reports on 15&nbsp;million cubic metres of sewage flowing from Israeli settlements in the West Bank. It claims 75% is treated adequately but independent Israeli studies (2000) suggest that only 6% met Israeli treatment standards, while 48% was either not treated adequastely or discharged raw. Since then some improvements have been implemented.{{sfn|Tagar|Keinen|Bromberg|2007|pp=419–420}}

The landfill near [[Al-Jiftlik]] in the [[Jericho Governorate]], built on [[Israeli land and property laws|absentee Palestinian property]] without planning or an environment impact analysis, is for the exclusive use of waste, 1,000 tons per day, produced by Israeli settlements and cities within Israel.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} Palestinians are restricted to 3 landfills, and permits for more have been denied unless the sites can be used to dump settlement garbage. Even if a permit is given without this agreement, settler waste under military escort is still dumped there.{{sfn|HRW|2016}}

===Resource extraction===
Based on the number of quarries per km<sup>2</sup> in Areas A and B, it is calculated that, were Israel to lift restrictions, a further 275 quarries could be opened in Area C.  The World Bank estimates that Israel's virtual ban on issuing Palestinians permits for quarries there costs the Palestinian economy at least US$241&nbsp;million per year.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|p=58}}
In International law drawing on the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] (Article 55), it is established that an occupying power may reap some value from the resources of the country occupied but not deplete its assets, and that the [[usufruct]] must benefit the people under occupation. The Oslo Accords agreed to hand over mining rights to the Palestinian Authority. Israel licenses eleven settlement quarries in the West Bank and they sell 94% of their material to Israel, which arguably constitutes "depletion" and pays royalties to its West Bank military government and settlement municipalities.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} Thus the German [[HeidelbergCement|cement firm quarrying at Nahal Raba]] paid out €430,000 ($479,000) in taxes to the [[Samaria Regional Council]] in 2014 alone.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} The Israeli High Court rejected a petition that such quarrying was a violation by stating that after 4 decades Israeli law must adapt to "the realities on the ground". The state did undertake not to open more quarries.{{sfn|Gross|2011}} As an illustrative example, a Human Rights Watch report contrasts the difference between a Palestinian-owned quarry company in [[Beit Fajar]] and that of a European one working on what Israeli considers its state land. The European company obtained a concession and license to harvest stone, whereas Israel refuses permits for most of the roughly 40 Beit Fajar quarries, or nearly any other Palestinian-owned quarry in the West Bank under Israeli administration.{{sfn|HRW|2016}}

Israel had denied Palestinians permits to process minerals in that area of the West Bank.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|p=58}} The products of the Israeli cosmetics firm [[Ahava]], established in 1988, were developed in laboratories at the West Bank Dead Sea settlements of [[Mitzpe Shalem]] and [[Kalya]]. 60% of their production is sold in the EU market.{{sfn|Nicoletti|Hearne|2012|pp=21–22}} In 2018 The UN, stating that the violations were both "pervasive and devastating" to the local Palestinian population, identified some 206 companies which do business with Israeli settlements in the West Bank.{{sfn|Nebehay|2018}}
Roughly 73 percent of global [[bromine]] production comes from Israeli and Jordanian exploitation of the Dead Sea. The potential incremental value that could accrue to the Palestinian economy from the production and sales of [[potash]], bromine and magnesium has been conservatively estimated at US$918&nbsp;million per annum, or 9 percent of GDP.{{sfn|World Bank|2013|pp=12–13}}{{sfn|Beckouche|2017|p=156}} The lost earnings from not being allowed to process Dead Sea minerals such as potash, and for making bromide-based flame retardants, based on calculations of comparable use by Israel and Jordan, suggest a figure of $642&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|pp=58–60}}

===Loss of cultural property===
Albert Glock argued that Israel is responsible for the disappearance of significant parts of the Palestinian cultural patrimony, by confiscating Arab cultural resources. In 1967 it appropriated the Palestine Archaeological Museum{{efn|"The one center of archaeological activity that might have provided a base for Palestinian archaeologists was the Palestine Archaeological Museum in Jerusalem, which was under the control not of Jordan but of trustees made up of the directors of the several foreign schools of archaeology in the city. It is therefore not clear why persons like [[Dimitri Baramki]] did not continue their work as archaeologists employed by the Palestine Museum. In any event, Jordan nationalized the museum only months before the June 1967 war, enabling the Israelis to claim it as theirs by right of conquest,"{{sfn|Glock|1994|p=77}}}} and its library in East Jerusalem.{{efn|"Fourth, the disappearance of the Palestinian patrimony (material evidence) through the deliberate confiscation of Arab cultural resources by Israelis (such as the large library of Dr. [[Tawfiq Canaan]] in 1948, the [[Rockefeller Museum|Palestine Archaeological Museum]] and its library in Jerusalem in 1967, and the library of the Palestine Research Center in Beirut in 1982), as well as the destruction of cultural property in the form of entire villages in 1948–49. This last is particularly crucial, since the Palestinians' link to their past is largely through the villages, few towns, and fewer cities that predominated in their land during the last thirteen centuries."{{sfn|Glock|1994|p=71}}}} Often these losses are personal, as when homes are ransacked and looted of their valuables. The journalist Hamdi Faraj, jailed for endangering public order, had his 500-volume library confiscated, including copies of the Bible and Qur'an and, when he applied for their restitution, was told all the books had been accidentally burnt.{{sfn|Friedman|1983|p=96}}
The Israeli occupation has wrought a profound change in Palestinian identity, which clings to a sense of a "paradise lost" before the changes brought out by the 1967 conquest.{{sfn|Kamrava|2016|p=116}}{{efn|Israeli settlers forced to evacuate their settlements have also called their prior state as one of a "lost paradise".{{sfn|Perugini|2014|p=55}}}}

===Tourism===
{{main|Tourism in the Palestinian territories}}
The Palestinian territories contain several of the most significant sites for Muslims, Christians and Jews, and are endowed with a world-class heritage highly attractive to tourists and pilgrims.{{sfn|World Bank|2013|p=20}} The West Bank Palestinians themselves have difficulties in accessing the territory for recreation.

Based on 1967 figures, the Palestinian [[Dead Sea]] Coastline is roughly 40&nbsp;km in length, of which 15% (6&nbsp;kilometres) could lend itself to the same tourist infrastructure developed by Jordan and Israel in their respective areas. Were Israel to permit a parallel development of this Palestinian sector, the World Bank estimates that 2,900 jobs would be added, allowing the Palestinian economy a potential value-added input of something like $126&nbsp;million annually.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|pp=65–66}} It is also the only maritime recreational outlet for West Bankers, but according to an [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel|Acri]] complaint to the Israeli Supreme Court in 2008 Palestinians are often barred or turned away from the beaches at their only access point, the [[Beit HaArava|Beit Ha'arava checkpoint]] on [[Highway 90 (Israel–Palestine)|Route 90]]. Acri claimed the ban responds to fears by settlers who operate tourist concessions in this West Bank area that they will lose Jewish customers if there are too many West Bank Palestinians on the beaches.{{efn|'The ban came to light after the testimony of two Israeli army reservists who said that at the beginning of their tour of duty in May they were told that the purpose of the checkpoint was to "prevent Palestinians coming from the Jordan Valley to the Dead Sea beaches".. One of the reservists, Doron Karbel, testified that as a "side note", the Jordan Valley Brigade Commander, Colonel Yigal Slovik, had said the reason for the checkpoint was that "when Jews and Palestinian vacationers were sitting on the beaches side by side it hurt the business of the surrounding [[yishuv]]im (Jewish communities)." {{sfn|Macintyre|2008}} }}
The key Palestinian towns in the West Bank for tourism are East Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Jericho. All access points are controlled by Israel and the road system, checkpoints and obstacles in place for visitors desiring to visit Palestinian towns leaves their hotels half-empty.{{sfn|Isaac|2013|p=147}} From 92 to 94 cents in every dollar of the tourist trade goes to Israel.{{sfn|Isaac|2013|p=144}} The general itineraries under Israeli management focus predominantly on Jewish history. Obstacles placed in the way of Palestinian-managed tourism down to 1995 included withholding licenses from tour guides, and hotels, for construction or renovation, and control of airports and highways, enabling Israel to develop a virtual monopoly on tourism.{{sfn|Isaac|2013|p=144}}

==Transportation and communications==

===Road system===
[[File:Road 5066 A.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Road in the West Bank]]
{{main|Palestinian freedom of movement#Restriction of movement in the West Bank}}
In 2010, the West Bank and Gaza Strip together had {{convert|4686|km|mi|-0|abbr=on}} of roadways.<ref name="CIA"/>

It has been said that for "Jewish settlers, roads ''connect''; for Palestinians, they ''separate''."{{sfn|Kamrava|2016|p=86}} Between 1994 and 1997, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) built 180 miles of bypass roads in the territories, on appropriated land because they ran close to Palestinian villages.{{sfn|Efrat|2006|p=85}} The given aim was said to be to afford protection to settlers from Palestinian sniping, bombing, and drive-by shootings.{{sfn|Galchinsky|2004|p=117}} For [[Tel Aviv University|TAU]] emeritus professor of geography Elisha Efrat, they ignored the historical topography, road systems and environmental characteristics of the West Bank, and simply formed an apartheid network of "octopus arms which hold a grip on Palestinian population centres".{{efn|"This imposed network of roads could be characterized by lack of consideration for the existing historical road network in the region; by inappropriateness of topography; by construction in marginal areas for a small population; by land confiscation of Arab villages; by lack of a logical hierarchy of roads with defined traffic functions; and above all by the development of a new road system as a means of territorial dominance of the region."{{sfn|Efrat|2006|p=85}}}}

A large number of embankments, concrete slabs and barriers impeded movement on primary and secondary roads.  The result was to [[Canton (country subdivision)|cantonize]] and fragment Palestinian townships, and cause endless obstacles to Palestinians going to work, schools, markets and relatives.{{efn|" With Palestinian traffic banned from all the main and secondary roads, clusters of yellow group taxis gather at each such barrier, and groups of people trying to get to work, school, clinics, universities, relatives houses, or markets clamber up and down sand embankments or across ditches to circumvent concrete slabs and soldiers, who sometimes shoot at them."{{sfn|Hass|2002|p=6}}}} Ramallah was cut off from all of its feeder villages in 2000.{{sfn|Hass|2002|p=6}}

Though prohibited by law, confiscation of Palestinian identity cards at checkpoints is a daily occurrence. At best drivers must wait for several hours for them to be returned, when, as can happen, the IDs themselves are lost as soldiers change shifts, in which case Palestinians are directed to some regional office the next day, and more checkpoints to get there.{{sfn|Efrat|2006|p=85}} Even before the Al Aqsa Intifada, [[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]] estimated that 20% of pregnant West Bank women were unable to access [[prenatal care]] because of the difficulties and delays caused by crossing checkpoints, and dozens were forced to deliver their children on the roadside.{{sfn|Aswad|2007}}
Constant uncertainty and the inability to plan are the results for Palestinians of the Israeli military rules governing their movements.  The [[World Bank]] noted that additional costs arising from longer travelling caused by restrictions on movement through three major routes in the West Bank alone ran to (2013) USD 185&nbsp;million a year, adding that other, earlier calculations (2007) suggest restrictions on the Palestinian labour market cost the West Bank approximately US$229&nbsp;million per annum. It concluded that such imposed restrictions had a major negative impact on the local economy, hindering stability and growth.{{sfn|World Bank|2013|p=30}} In 2007, official Israeli statistics indicated that there were 180,000 Palestinians on Israel's secret travel ban list. 561 roadblocks and checkpoints were in place (October), the number of Palestinians licensed to drive private cars was 46,166 and the annual cost of permits was $454.{{sfn|Makdisi|2010|pp=63–64}} These checkpoints, together with the separation wall and the restricted networks restructure the West Bank into "land cells", freezing the flow of normal everyday Palestinian lives.{{sfn|Handel|2010|pp=259,261}} Israel sets up [[Random checkpoint|flying checkpoints]] without notice. Some 2,941 flying checkpoints were rigged up along West Bank roads, averaging some 327 a month, in 2017. A further 476 unstaffed physical obstacles, such as dirt mounds, concrete blocks, gates and fenced sections had been placed on roads for Palestinian use. Of the gates erected at village entrances, 59 were always closed.{{sfn|B'Tselem|2017b}} The checkpoint system did not ease up after the Oslo Accords, but was strengthened after them, which has been interpreted as suggesting their function is to assert control over Palestinians, and as a sign of an unwillingness to yield ground in the West Bank.{{sfn|Efrat|2006|p=86}} According to [[Health Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|PA Health Ministry statistics]] relating to the period from 2000 to 2006, of 68 Palestinian women who gave birth to their children while held up at checkpoints, 35 miscarried and 5 died while delivering their child there.{{sfn|BBC|2008}} [[Machsom Watch]] accumulated over a mere five years (2001–2006)  some 10,000 eyewitness reports and testimonies regarding the innumerable difficulties faced by Palestinians trying to negotiate West Bank checkpoints.{{sfn|Keshet|2013|p=viii}}

Transportation infrastructure is particularly problematic as Palestinian use of roads in Area C is highly restricted, and travel times can be inordinate; the Palestinian Authority has also been unable to develop roads, airports or railways in or through Area C,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/10/18344690/west-bank-gaza-area-c-future-palestinian-economy|title=West Bank and Gaza – Area C and the future of the Palestinian economy|author=World Bank|publisher=World Bank, Washington DC|accessdate=18 January 2014|year=2013|quote=UNOCHA analysis suggests that less than one percent of the land in Area C is currently available to Palestinians for construction; permit data also shows that it is almost impossible to obtain permission to build in Area C. Less than 6 percent of all requests made between 2000 and 2007 secured approval. This situation applies not only to housing but to public economic infrastructure (roads, water reservoirs, waste treatment plants) and industrial plant, and to the access roads and utility lines needed to connect Areas A and B across Area C. [...] The outbreak of the second Intifada in 2000 interrupted this trend, bringing increased violence and uncertainty – and most significantly, the intensification by Israel of a complex set of security-related restrictions that impeded the movement of people and goods and fragmented the Palestinian territories into small enclaves lacking economic cohesion.

There is a road, [[Route 4370]], which has a concrete wall dividing the two sides, one designated for Israeli vehicles, the other for Palestinian.

{{As of|2012|2}}, a plan for 475-kilometer rail network, establishing 11 new rail lines in West Bank, was confirmed by Israeli Transportation Ministry. The West Bank network would include one line running through Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah, Jerusalem, Ma'aleh Adumim, Bethlehem and Hebron. Another would provide service along the Jordanian border from Eilat to the Dead Sea, Jericho and Beit She'an and from there toward Haifa in the west and in also in a northeasterly direction. The proposed scheme also calls for shorter routes, such as between Nablus and Tul Karm in the West Bank, and from Ramallah to the Allenby Bridge crossing into Jordan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-draws-plan-for-475-kilometer-rail-network-in-west-bank-1.414976|title=Israel draws plan for 475-kilometer rail network in West Bank|publisher=haaretz|date=February 2012|accessdate=23 December 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103102753/http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-draws-plan-for-475-kilometer-rail-network-in-west-bank-1.414976|archive-date=3 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Airports===
The only airport in the West Bank is the [[Atarot Airport]] near [[Ramallah]], but it has been closed since 2001.

===Telecom===
{{Main|Telecommunications in the Palestinian territories}}
The Palestinian [[Paltel]] telecommunication companies provide communication services such as [[landline]], [[cellular network]] and Internet in the West Bank and [[Gaza Strip]]. Dialling code [[+970]] is used in the West Bank and all over the Palestinian territories. Until 2007, the Palestinian mobile market was monopolized by [[Jawwal]]. A new [[mobile operator]] for the territories launched in 2009 under the name of [[Wataniya Telecom]]. The number of Internet users increased from 35,000 in 2000 to 356,000 in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/me/ps.htm |title=Palestine Internet Usage and Telecommunications Report |publisher=Internetworldstats.com |accessdate=4 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120204035341/http://www.internetworldstats.com/me/ps.htm |archive-date=4 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Radio and television===
The [[Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation]] broadcasts from an AM station in Ramallah on 675&nbsp;kHz; numerous local privately owned stations are also in operation. Most Palestinian households have a radio and TV, and satellite dishes for receiving international coverage are widespread. Recently, PalTel announced and has begun implementing an initiative to provide ADSL broadband internet service to all households and businesses. Israel's cable television company [[Hot (Israel)|HOT]], satellite television provider ([[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]]) [[Yes (Israel)|Yes]], AM and FM radio broadcast stations and public television broadcast stations all operate. Broadband internet service by Bezeq's ADSL and by the cable company is available as well.
The [[Al-Aqsa Voice]] broadcasts from Dabas Mall in [[Tulkarem]] at 106.7 FM. The [[Al-Aqsa TV]] station shares these offices.

Most universities in the West Bank have politically active student bodies, and elections of student council officers are normally along party affiliations. Although the establishment of the universities was initially allowed by the Israeli authorities, some were sporadically ordered closed by the Israeli Civil Administration during the 1970s and 1980s to prevent political activities and violence against the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Some universities remained closed by military order for extended periods during years immediately preceding and following the first Palestinian Intifada, but have largely remained open since the signing of the Oslo Accords despite the advent of the Al-Aqsa Intifada (Second Intifada) in 2000.

The founding of Palestinian universities has greatly increased education levels among the population in the West Bank. According to a Birzeit University study, the percentage of Palestinians choosing local universities as opposed to foreign institutions has been steadily increasing; as of 1997, 41% of Palestinians with bachelor's degrees had obtained them from Palestinian institutions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.birzeit.edu/dsp/research/publications/2002/49e.pdf |title=Education and Human Development |publisher=Birzeit University |year=2002 |accessdate=9 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926023114/http://home.birzeit.edu/dsp/research/publications/2002/49e.pdf |archive-date=26 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> According to UNESCO, Palestinians are one of the most highly educated groups in the Middle East "despite often difficult circumstances".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17238&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20050928211016/http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17238&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 September 2005 |title=UNESCO &#124; Education – Palestinian Authority |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |accessdate=9 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The literacy rate among Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip according to the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS) is 94.6% for 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Illiteracy_2010E.pdf|title=On the Eve of the International Illiteracy day, 8th of September|publisher=Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics|date=7 September 2010|accessdate=3 March 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510022249/http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Illiteracy_2010E.pdf|archive-date=10 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
