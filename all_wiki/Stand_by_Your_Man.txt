"'''Stand by Your Man'''" is a song co-written by [[Tammy Wynette]] and [[Billy Sherrill]] and originally recorded by Wynette, released as a single in the [[United States]] on September 20, 1968. It proved to be the most successful record of Wynette's career, and is one of the most familiar songs in the history of [[country music]]. The song was placed at number one on [[Country Music Television|CMT's]] list of the Top 100 Country Music Songs.

Released as a [[single (music)|single]], it stayed number one on the U.S. country charts for three weeks.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944-2006, Second edition|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=399}}</ref> "Stand by Your Man" crossed over to the U.S. [[pop music|pop charts]], peaking at number nineteen.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits: Eighth Edition |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=690}}</ref> It elevated Wynette—then one of many somewhat successful female country recording artists—to superstar status.

The song earned Wynette the 1970 [[12th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance|Best Country Vocal Performance, Female]] - her second Grammy win in that category - and was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 1999.

Vocal accompaniment is provided by [[The Jordanaires]], who provided background vocals on most of Wynette's hit recordings.
 
The song was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] as a 2010 addition to the [[National Recording Registry]], which selects recordings annually that are "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2010reg.html | title=The National Recording Registry 2010 | accessdate=April 10, 2011 | publisher=Library of Congress}}</ref>

==Background and writing==
"Stand by Your Man" was reportedly written in 1968 at Columbia Recording Studios in Nashville in all of 15 minutes. The song came from an idea that originated with Wynette's producer, Billy Sherrill, who along with Wynette is one of the two writers credited. Tammy was not very fond of the song at first because it was unlike anything she had ever written before, and because there is a high note that was hard for her to sing. She said that, over time, she got to love the song, and came to the point where she "couldn't do a show without it." Sherrill originally stated that, before "Stand by Your Man"'s release, he thought that Wynette's "D-I-V-O-R-C-E" would be Wynette's signature song. However, after witnessing how successful the song came to be in America during that time, Sherrill then agreed that "Stand by Your Man" was definitely Wynette's career-defining hit.

==Content==
Derided by the [[feminist movement]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s, Wynette in later years defended the song as not a call for women to place themselves second to men, but rather a suggestion that women attempt to overlook their husbands' shortcomings and faults if they truly love them (and in fact, the last line in the final verse says "after all, he's ''just'' a man"). Wynette always defended her signature song. The song remained contentious into the early 1990s, when soon-to-be First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] told [[CBS]]' ''[[60 Minutes]]'' during the "[[Gennifer Flowers]] interview" that she "wasn't some little woman 'standing by my man' like Tammy Wynette." The condemnation from the public was immediate, even coming from Wynette herself.

==In popular culture==
The song appeared at the beginning of the Academy-Award nominated 1970 film ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]'', starring [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Karen Black]]. It also appeared in ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980) (in which it was sung by [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]]), 1987 film ''[[The Fourth Protocol]]'', starring [[Michael Caine]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]], and at the end of the Academy-Award-winning 1992 film ''[[The Crying Game]]'' (in which it was sung by [[Lyle Lovett]]). The song resurfaced again in a string of other early 1990s films, including ''[[My Cousin Vinny]]'' (1992), ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]'' (1993), ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' (1993), ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994), and ''[[GoldenEye]]'' (1995).

A 1976 [[answer song]] by [[Ronnie Milsap]] "[[(I'm A) Stand by My Woman Man]]" also topped the country music charts.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PMpOGoVFGFoC&pg=PA102 |title=Understanding Popular Music |author=Roy Shuker |year=1994 |page=102 |isbn=9780415107228 |accessdate=2016-10-02}}</ref>

In 1968, Italian singer Palma Calderoni recorded this song with Italian text, written by [[Mogol (lyricist)|Mogol]] and [[Claudio Daiano]] (title is ''Io voglio te'').

The song was spoofed on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' as "Stand By Your Can". It was performed by Hammy Swinette, a porcine parody of Wynette, who—with the help of a [[The Muppets|Muppet]] [[Waste container|trash can]]—urges people to put their [[Waste|trash]] in a [[Waste container|trash can]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZlCyOk70W8 |title=Sesame Street: Stand By Your Can |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-03-27}}</ref>

The song was also used during the episode "Hatless" of the first season of ''[[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]''.

The song also appears in an episode of the popular 2008 show ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', where an embarrassing video of Blair Waldorf singing "Stand By Your Man" is played at her 20th birthday party.

In 2016, the song appeared in the fourth-season premiere of ''[[Masters of Sex (season 4)|Masters of Sex]]'' where a drunk [[Virginia E. Johnson|Virginia Johnson]] (played by [[Lizzy Caplan]]) is shown singing along in a hotel bar.

"Stand by Your Man" was one of the songs used in the 2018 South Korean television series ''[[Something in the Rain]]'' starring [[Son Ye-jin]] and [[Jung Hae-in]], using the version covered by Italian-French singer and former French [[First Lady]] [[Carla Bruni]].

On 2018's CMT Artist Of The Year [[Carrie Underwood]] with [[Maddie & Tae]] and [[Runaway June]] performed this song with another women hits country song.
==="Stand by The JAMs" featuring Tammy Wynette===
{{main|Justified & Ancient}}

In November 1991, nearly [[The KLF#23|23 years]] after the original song,<ref>{{LibraryOfMu|mu-id=263|first=Terry|last=Staunton|title=Stand By Your Van|work=[[New Musical Express]]|date=23 November 1991|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916114722/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=263|archive-date=September 16, 2016}}</ref> the single "Justified & Ancient (Stand by The JAMs)" was released, with Tammy introduced in the sleevenotes as "the first lady of country". [[The KLF]]'s [[Bill Drummond]] flew to [[Nashville]] to personally produce the recording of Wynette's vocals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p05df1zd|publisher=[[BBC Sounds]]|author=The Tom Robinson Show|title=When The KLF's Bill Drummond met Tammy Wynette|type=Extract from audio interview with Bill Drummond|access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref>

In April 1992, Wynette collapsed while on tour in Australia; for this she cited overwork during the promotion of "Justified & Ancient".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Tammy lays blame on KLF|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=6 April 1992}}</ref>

The single reached number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>McAleer, David, 'Top 40 Charts', Virgin Books, Pgs 638-639, 2009</ref> It also reached number 11 in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4694|pure_url=yes}}|url-status=dead<!--there no longer appears to be any awards tab-->|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|title=The KLF > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702015223/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-klf-mn0000074853/awards|archive-date=2 July 2012}}</ref>, returning Wynette to the top-40 on that chart for the first time since 1969.

It appears in [[Stephen King]]'s 2020 [[If It Bleeds]] novel in a short story called "Mr Harrigan's Phone" as Mr Harrigan's ringtone.
