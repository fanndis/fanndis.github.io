== Career ==

===Drudge Report===
{{Main|Drudge Report}}
Drudge was unknown before he began the news aggregation site, the [[Drudge Report]].<ref name="siklos">{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/06/06/technology/drudge_report.fortune/index.htm?section=money_news_newsmakers|title=The Web 2.0-defying logic of Drudge|accessdate=2008-06-28|publisher=CNN|author=Richard Siklos |date=2008-06-06}}</ref> For many years, he took odd jobs such as night counterman at a [[7-Eleven]] convenience store, [[telemarketing|telemarketer]] for [[Time-Life]] books, [[McDonald's]] manager, and sales assistant at a [[New York City]] grocery store. In 1989, he moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he took up residence in a small [[Hollywood]] apartment. He took a job in the gift shop of [[CBS]] studios, eventually working his way up to manager. Here, he was apparently privy to some inside gossip, part of the inspiration for founding the Drudge Report. Worried about his son’s aimlessness, Drudge's father insisted on buying him a [[Packard Bell]] computer in 1994.<ref name="nymagx" /> The Drudge Report began as email notes sent out to a few friends.

The original issues were part gossip and part opinion. They were distributed as an email newsletter and posted to alt.showbiz.gossip [[Usenet]] forum. In 1996, the newsletter transitioned slowly from entertainment gossip to political gossip and moved from email to the [[World Wide Web|Web]] as its primary distribution mechanism.

In March 1995, the Drudge Report had 1,000 email subscribers; by 1997, Drudge had 85,000 subscribers to his email service. Drudge's website gained in popularity in the late 1990s after a number of stories which he reported before the mainstream media. Drudge first received national attention in 1996 when he broke the news that [[Jack Kemp]] would be [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Bob Dole]]'s running mate in the 1996 presidential election. In 1998, Drudge gained popularity when he published the reporting of then ''[[Newsweek]]'' reporter Michael Issikoff, becoming the first media outlet to publish the news that later became the [[Monica Lewinsky scandal]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-119251631/matt-drudge-finds-internet.html |title=Article: Matt Drudge finds Internet success |work=AccessMyLibrary |accessdate=2009-11-24 |first=Richard |last=Pachter |date=2003-08-29}}</ref>

Drudge met [[Andrew Breitbart]] in Los Angeles during the 1990s and became his mentor, with Breitbart later helping to run the Drudge Report.<ref name="sappell" /><ref name="breit-cash">{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Breitbart.com+has+Drudge+to+thank+for+his+success/2100-1025_3-5976096.html |title=Breitbart.com has Drudge to thank for its success |accessdate=2007-08-07 |publisher=cnet news |date=2005-11-30 |author=Greg Sandoval |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119143204/http://news.cnet.com/Breitbart.com-has-Drudge-to-thank-for-his-success/2100-1025_3-5976096.html |archivedate=2013-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Breitbart announced in 2005 that he was "amicably leaving the Drudge Report after a long and close working relationship with Matt Drudge" but still helped run Drudge's website from Los Angeles by working the afternoon shift, in addition to running [[Breitbart (website)|Breitbart]].<ref name="breit-simon">{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerlsimon.com/mt-archives/2005/04/breitbart_state.php|title=April 26, 2005: Breitbart Statement|accessdate=2007-08-07|date=2005-04-26|author=Andrew Breitbart|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061012031049/http://www.rogerlsimon.com/mt-archives/2005/04/breitbart_state.php|archivedate=October 12, 2006}}</ref><ref name="biyatch">{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/122048.html|title=Lists: What's Your Source for That?

A story by ''[[Business 2.0]]'' magazine from April 2003 estimated that Drudge's website received $3,500 a day (almost $1.3 million a year) in [[advertising]] revenues. Subtracting his relatively minor server costs, the magazine estimated that The Drudge Report website netted $800,000 a year.<ref name="cnnmoney">{{cite news|last=Keighley|first=Geoff|title=The Secrets of Drudge Inc.

During an April 30, 2004 appearance on [[C-SPAN]], Drudge confirmed that he earns over $1 million. For many years, Drudge was based out of his one-bedroom apartment in [[Hollywood]]. Today, Drudge maintains the website from his two properties in [[Miami]].<ref name="nymagx"/><ref name="sappell">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-drudge4aug04,0,4136919,full.story?coll=la-home-center|title=Hot links served up daily|accessdate=2007-08-04|work=Los Angeles Times |date=2007-08-04|author=Joel Sappell}}</ref> In updating the site, he reportedly monitors multiple television news channels and a number of websites on several computers in his home office.<ref name=TNR.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=33037aaf-848f-4b79-8a75-34d6c793457e&p=2|title=Underground Man |work=The New Republic |accessdate=2009-04-22 |last=Sherman |first=Gabriel|quote=One source relays that, these days, the only media figures he talks to regularly are a select group that includes Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, and Andrew Breitbart ...

===Fox News television show===
From June 1998 to November 1999, Drudge hosted a Saturday night television show called ''[[Drudge (TV program)|Drudge]]'' on the [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]]. The show ended by joint consent. Drudge had refused to go on air, charging Fox News with [[censorship]] when the network prevented him from showing photos of surgery on [[Samuel Armas]]. Drudge, who is [[pro-life]], wanted to use a picture of a tiny hand reaching out from the womb to dramatize his argument against late-term [[abortion]], but Fox's [[John Moody (journalist)|John Moody]] decided that that would be misleading because the photo was not of an abortion but an emergency operation on the fetus for [[spina bifida]].<ref name="abort">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-11/15/021r-111599-idx.html|title=The Going Gets Tough, and Matt Drudge Gets Going|accessdate=2007-07-29|work=The Washington Post|date=1999-11-15|author=Howard Kurtz}}</ref> Fox News alleged breach of contract but, after Drudge issued an apology,<ref name="cathlik">{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/abortion/ab0018.html|title=Photo Drudges Up Cries of Doubles Standard|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=National Catholic Register|year=1999}}</ref> Fox issued a statement calling the parting "amicable."<ref name="cathlik" />

===Radio talk show===
Drudge hosted a Sunday night [[talk radio]] show&nbsp;– "The only time anyone will let me on the air," he claimed. The show, which was also named the Drudge Report, was syndicated by [[Premiere Radio Networks]]. He guest hosted for the [[Conservative talk|conservative radio talk]] show host [[Rush Limbaugh]]. Drudge gained notice in the early 2000s by becoming a frequent reference for news material on Limbaugh's, [[Sean Hannity]]'s, and [[Mark Levin]]'s radio shows. He was often acknowledged by [[Michael Savage (commentator)|Michael Savage]] as a source of topics for ''[[The Savage Nation]]''. [[Lynn Samuels]], for a time, served as Drudge's call screener.

Drudge left his position as radio host with Premiere effective September 30, 2007. He was replaced by [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], radio station [[WLW]]'s [[Bill Cunningham (talk show host)|Bill Cunningham]] on the network and in most markets,<ref>Kiesewetter, John. [http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070904/ENT/70904026 Cunningham Goes National]. Cincinnati Enquirer. 5 September 2007.</ref> though in a few larger markets, [[John Batchelor]] replaced him instead.

===Books===
[https://www.amazon.com/Drudge-Revolution-Internet-Connection-Mainstream/dp/1948836963 The Drudge Revolution: The Inside Story of How Talk Radio, Fox News, and a Gift Shop Clerk with an Internet Connection Took Down the Mainstream Media], was published on July 28th, 2020. In the book, author and investigative journalist [[Matthew Lysiak]] interviews more than 200 former friends and associates, including former Drudge Report editor Joseph Curl, to reveal the first inside look at Drudge and his website. 
Drudge wrote a book with [[Julia Phillips]] in 2000 titled ''Drudge Manifesto''.  It reached the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/29/books/best-sellers-october-29-2000.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm New York Times] Best Seller List 29 October 2000</ref><ref name="manifesto">{{cite book | title=Drudge Manifesto| last=Drudge| first=Matt| date=2001-09-05| publisher=NAL Trade| isbn=978-0-451-20491-2}}</ref>  The book features a transcript of a Q&A session conducted at the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] on June 2, 1998, which lays out Drudge's
''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]''. It also contains copies of e-mails sent to Drudge by his readers, dialogues between Drudge and his cat, and extensive descriptions of parties Drudge has attended and how the celebrities there reacted to him. A review in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' said "Indeed, while Drudge Manifesto runs 247 pages ...  Which leaves, in the end, 112 pages of new material, including nine pages of poetry."<ref name="beato1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com|title=Drudge Manifesto|accessdate=2007-08-09|work=The Washington Post|date=2000-10-09|author=Greg Beato}}</ref><ref name="beato2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.soundbitten.com/DrudgeBook.html|title=Drudge Manifesto review|accessdate=2007-08-09|date=2000-10-09|author=G. Beato}}</ref>  A review from the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', said: "By any standard, Drudge's book is padded," and: "It is a weird, stream-of-conscious mixture of telling readers how he got his stories and mocking his critics."

==Influence==
In the 2020 book [https://www.amazon.com/Drudge-Revolution-Internet-Connection-Mainstream/dp/1948836963 "Drudge Revolution,"] author Matthew Lysiak describes how every major presidential campaign dating back to the late 90s had a staffer whose responsibility was to make a connection and potentially influence Drudge. Ahead of the 2008 Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton communication director Tracy Sefl befriended Drudge, a relationship which she describes in the book as "scary" due to the power of the Drudge Report.

In their 2006 book ''The Way To Win'', [[Mark Halperin]] and [[John F. Harris|John Harris]] report that [[Republican National Convention]] chairman [[Ken Mehlman]] "kind of brags" (as then [[CNN]] host [[Howard Kurtz]] put it) about utilizing the Drudge channel.<ref name="cnn-transcript">{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0610/15/rs.01.html|title=CNN Reliable Sources: Coverage of the Mark Foley Scandal|accessdate=2007-08-05|publisher=CNN|date=2006-10-15}}</ref> They also wrote that "Drudge, with his droll [[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]] name, was not the only media or political agent whose actions led to [[John Kerry]]'s defeat.

[[ABC News]] concluded that the Drudge Report sets the tone for national political coverage.<ref name="abctone">{{cite news| title = Drudge Report Sets Tone for National Political Coverage| publisher = ABC News| date = 2006-10-01| url = https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2514276&page=1| accessdate = 2006-10-01}}</ref> The article says "[[United States Republican Party|Republican]] operatives keep an open line to Drudge, often using him to attack their opponents."

In October 2006, ''[[Washington Post]]'' editor [[Len Downie]], speaking at the [[Online News Association]]'s annual convention in [[Washington, D.C.]], said "Our largest driver of traffic is Matt Drudge."<ref name="epwapotraffic">{{cite web| last = Hirschman| first = David S.| title = 'Wash Post' Editor Downie: Everyone in Our Newsroom Wants to Be a Blogger| publisher = Editor & Publisher| date = 2006-10-06| url = http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003221716| accessdate = 2006-10-08 }}</ref>

On October 22, 2007, ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[Jim Rutenberg]] wrote that Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, including [[Hillary Clinton]], were cooperating with Drudge and "working harder than ever to get favorable coverage for their candidates&nbsp;– or unfavorable coverage of competitors&nbsp;– onto the Drudge Report’s home page, knowing that television producers, radio talk show hosts and newspaper reporters view it as a bulletin board for the latest news and gossip."<ref name="thenewyorktimes">{{cite news| last = Rutenberg| first = Jim| title = Clinton Finds Way to Play Along With Drudge| work = The New York Times| date = 2007-10-22| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/us/politics/22drudge.html?ei=5065&en=8e8c56803a2a987c&ex=1193630400&partner=MYWAY&pagewanted=print| accessdate = 2007-10-22}}</ref> Rutenberg stated that Nielsen/NetRatings shows that the Drudge Report gets three million unique visitors over the course of a month, or approximately one percent of the population of the [[United States]].

During the [[2012 Republican presidential primaries]], Drudge was described by some, including former presidential candidate [[Fred Thompson]], as having a pro-[[Mitt Romney]] slant.<ref name="mitt">{{cite news |last= Epstein| first= Jennifer | publisher= Politico| date=2012-01-29|accessdate=2014-05-03 | url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2012/01/fred-thompson-attacks-romney-campaign-for-having-drudge-112714.html|title=Thompson: Mitt campaign has 'Drudge in their back pocket'}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Drudge previously lived in [[Hollywood]]. As of 2007, he owned two properties in [[Miami]]&nbsp;– a $1.4 million Mediterranean-style stucco house on [[Rivo Alto Island]],<ref name="nymagx"/> and a $1 million-plus condominium in Miami's [[Four Seasons Hotel Miami|Four Seasons hotel]].<ref name="sappell"/> By early 2009, Drudge earned millions of dollars a year, traveled extensively and moved to another property in Miami and had become reclusive.<ref name=TNR.com/> In 2003 he said his one indulgence, apart from travel, was his [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/16/1063625009939.html |title=Pushing others' news for profit&nbsp;– smh.com.au |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=2009-10-04 | date=2003-09-16}}</ref>
