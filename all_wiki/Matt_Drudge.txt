== Career ==

===Drudge Report===
{{Main|Drudge Report}}
Drudge was unknown before he began the news aggregation site, the [[Drudge Report]].<ref name="siklos">{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/06/06/technology/drudge_report.fortune/index.htm?section=money_news_newsmakers|title=The Web 2.0-defying logic of Drudge|accessdate=2008-06-28|publisher=CNN|author=Richard Siklos |date=2008-06-06}}</ref> For many years, he took odd jobs such as night counterman at a [[7-Eleven]] convenience store, [[telemarketing|telemarketer]] for [[Time-Life]] books, [[McDonald's]] manager, and sales assistant at a [[New York City]] grocery store. In 1989, he moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he took up residence in a small [[Hollywood]] apartment. He took a job in the gift shop of [[CBS]] studios, eventually working his way up to manager. Here, he was apparently privy to some inside gossip, part of the inspiration for founding the Drudge Report. Worried about his sonâ€™s aimlessness, Drudge's father insisted on buying him a [[Packard Bell]] computer in 1994.<ref name="nymagx" /> The Drudge Report began as email notes sent out to a few friends.

The original issues were part gossip and part opinion. They were distributed as an email newsletter and posted to alt.showbiz.gossip [[Usenet]] forum. In 1996, the newsletter transitioned slowly from entertainment gossip to political gossip and moved from email to the [[World Wide Web|Web]] as its primary distribution mechanism.

In March 1995, the Drudge Report had 1,000 email subscribers; by 1997, Drudge had 85,000 subscribers to his email service. Drudge's website gained in popularity in the late 1990s after a number of stories which he reported before the mainstream media. Drudge first received national attention in 1996 when he broke the news that [[Jack Kemp]] would be [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Bob Dole]]'s running mate in the 1996 presidential election. In 1998, Drudge gained popularity when he published the reporting of then ''[[Newsweek]]'' reporter Michael Issikoff, becoming the first media outlet to publish the news that later became the [[Monica Lewinsky scandal]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-119251631/matt-drudge-finds-internet.html |title=Article: Matt Drudge finds Internet success |work=AccessMyLibrary |accessdate=2009-11-24 |first=Richard |last=Pachter |date=2003-08-29}}</ref>

Drudge met [[Andrew Breitbart]] in Los Angeles during the 1990s and became his mentor, with Breitbart later helping to run the Drudge Report.<ref name="sappell" /><ref name="breit-cash">{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Breitbart.com+has+Drudge+to+thank+for+his+success/2100-1025_3-5976096.html |title=Breitbart.com has Drudge to thank for its success |accessdate=2007-08-07 |publisher=cnet news |date=2005-11-30 |author=Greg Sandoval |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119143204/http://news.cnet.com/Breitbart.com-has-Drudge-to-thank-for-his-success/2100-1025_3-5976096.html |archivedate=2013-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Breitbart announced in 2005 that he was "amicably leaving the Drudge Report after a long and close working relationship with Matt Drudge" but still helped run Drudge's website from Los Angeles by working the afternoon shift, in addition to running [[Breitbart (website)|Breitbart]].<ref name="breit-simon">{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerlsimon.com/mt-archives/2005/04/breitbart_state.php|title=April 26, 2005: Breitbart Statement|accessdate=2007-08-07|date=2005-04-26|author=Andrew Breitbart|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061012031049/http://www.rogerlsimon.com/mt-archives/2005/04/breitbart_state.php|archivedate=October 12, 2006}}</ref><ref name="biyatch">{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/122048.html|title=Lists: What's Your Source for That?

A story by ''[[Business 2.0]]'' magazine from April 2003 estimated that Drudge's website received $3,500 a day (almost $1.3 million a year) in [[advertising]] revenues. Subtracting his relatively minor server costs, the magazine estimated that The Drudge Report website netted $800,000 a year.<ref name="cnnmoney">{{cite news|last=Keighley|first=Geoff|title=The Secrets of Drudge Inc.

During an April 30, 2004 appearance on [[C-SPAN]], Drudge confirmed that he earns over $1 million. For many years, Drudge was based out of his one-bedroom apartment in [[Hollywood]]. Today, Drudge maintains the website from his two properties in [[Miami]].<ref name="nymagx"/><ref name="sappell">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-drudge4aug04,0,4136919,full.story?coll=la-home-center|title=Hot links served up daily|accessdate=2007-08-04|work=Los Angeles Times |date=2007-08-04|author=Joel Sappell}}</ref> In updating the site, he reportedly monitors multiple television news channels and a number of websites on several computers in his home office.<ref name=TNR.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=33037aaf-848f-4b79-8a75-34d6c793457e&p=2|title=Underground Man |work=The New Republic |accessdate=2009-04-22 |last=Sherman |first=Gabriel|quote=One source relays that, these days, the only media figures he talks to regularly are a select group that includes Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, and Andrew Breitbart ...

===Fox News television show===
From June 1998 to November 1999, Drudge hosted a Saturday night television show called ''[[Drudge (TV program)|Drudge]]'' on the [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]]. The show ended by joint consent. Drudge had refused to go on air, charging Fox News with [[censorship]] when the network prevented him from showing photos of surgery on [[Samuel Armas]]. Drudge, who is [[pro-life]], wanted to use a picture of a tiny hand reaching out from the womb to dramatize his argument against late-term [[abortion]], but Fox's [[John Moody (journalist)|John Moody]] decided that that would be misleading because the photo was not of an abortion but an emergency operation on the fetus for [[spina bifida]].<ref name="abort">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-11/15/021r-111599-idx.html|title=The Going Gets Tough, and Matt Drudge Gets Going|accessdate=2007-07-29|work=The Washington Post|date=1999-11-15|author=Howard Kurtz}}</ref> Fox News alleged breach of contract but, after Drudge issued an apology,<ref name="cathlik">{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/abortion/ab0018.html|title=Photo Drudges Up Cries of Doubles Standard|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=National Catholic Register|year=1999}}</ref> Fox issued a statement calling the parting "amicable."<ref name="cathlik" />

===Radio talk show===
Drudge hosted a Sunday night [[talk radio]] show&nbsp;â€“ "The only time anyone will let me on the air," he claimed. The show, which was also named the Drudge Report, was syndicated by [[Premiere Radio Networks]]. He guest hosted for the [[Conservative talk|conservative radio talk]] show host [[Rush Limbaugh]]. Drudge gained notice in the early 2000s by becoming a frequent reference for news material on Limbaugh's, [[Sean Hannity]]'s, and [[Mark Levin]]'s radio shows. He was often acknowledged by [[Michael Savage (commentator)|Michael Savage]] as a source of topics for ''[[The Savage Nation]]''. [[Lynn Samuels]], for a time, served as Drudge's call screener.

Drudge left his position as radio host with Premiere effective September 30, 2007. He was replaced by [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], radio station [[WLW]]'s [[Bill Cunningham (talk show host)|Bill Cunningham]] on the network and in most markets,<ref>Kiesewetter, John. [http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070904/ENT/70904026 Cunningham Goes National]. Cincinnati Enquirer. 5 September 2007.</ref> though in a few larger markets, [[John Batchelor]] replaced him instead.

===Books===
[https://www.amazon.com/Drudge-Revolution-Internet-Connection-Mainstream/dp/1948836963 The Drudge Revolution: The Inside Story of How Talk Radio, Fox News, and a Gift Shop Clerk with an Internet Connection Took Down the Mainstream Media], was published on July 28th, 2020. In the book, author and investigative journalist [[Matthew Lysiak]] interviews more than 200 former friends and associates, including former Drudge Report editor Joseph Curl, to reveal the first inside look at Drudge and his website. 
Drudge wrote a book with [[Julia Phillips]] in 2000 titled ''Drudge Manifesto''.  It reached the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/29/books/best-sellers-october-29-2000.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm New York Times] Best Seller List 29 October 2000</ref><ref name="manifesto">{{cite book | title=Drudge Manifesto| last=Drudge| first=Matt| date=2001-09-05| publisher=NAL Trade| isbn=978-0-451-20491-2}}</ref>  The book features a transcript of a Q&A session conducted at the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] on June 2, 1998, which lays out Drudge's
''[[wikt:raison d'Ãªtre|raison d'Ãªtre]]''. It also contains copies of e-mails sent to Drudge by his readers, dialogues between Drudge and his cat, and extensive descriptions of parties Drudge has attended and how the celebrities there reacted to him. A review in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' said "Indeed, while Drudge Manifesto runs 247 pages ...  Which leaves, in the end, 112 pages of new material, including nine pages of poetry."<ref name="beato1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com|title=Drudge Manifesto|accessdate=2007-08-09|work=The Washington Post|date=2000-10-09|author=Greg Beato}}</ref><ref name="beato2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.soundbitten.com/DrudgeBook.html|title=Drudge Manifesto review|accessdate=2007-08-09|date=2000-10-09|author=G. Beato}}</ref>  A review from the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', said: "By any standard, Drudge's book is padded," and: "It is a weird, stream-of-conscious mixture of telling readers how he got his stories and mocking his critics."

==Influence==
In the 2020 book [https://www.amazon.com/Drudge-Revolution-Internet-Connection-Mainstream/dp/1948836963 "Drudge Revolution,"] author Matthew Lysiak describes how every major presidential campaign dating back to the late 90s had a staffer whose responsibility was to make a connection and potentially influence Drudge. Ahead of the 2008 Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton communication director Tracy Sefl befriended Drudge, a relationship which she describes in the book as "scary" due to the power of the Drudge Report.

In their 2006 book ''The Way To Win'', [[Mark Halperin]] and [[John F. Harris|John Harris]] report that [[Republican National Convention]] chairman [[Ken Mehlman]] "kind of brags" (as then [[CNN]] host [[Howard Kurtz]] put it) about utilizing the Drudge channel.<ref name="cnn-transcript">{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0610/15/rs.01.html|title=CNN Reliable Sources: Coverage of the Mark Foley Scandal|accessdate=2007-08-05|publisher=CNN|date=2006-10-15}}</ref> They also wrote that "Drudge, with his droll [[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]] name, was not the only media or political agent whose actions led to [[John Kerry]]'s defeat.

[[ABC News]] concluded that the Drudge Report sets the tone for national political coverage.<ref name="abctone">{{cite news| title = Drudge Report Sets Tone for National Political Coverage| publisher = ABC News| date = 2006-10-01| url = https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2514276&page=1| accessdate = 2006-10-01}}</ref> The article says "[[United States Republican Party|Republican]] operatives keep an open line to Drudge, often using him to attack their opponents."

In October 2006, ''[[Washington Post]]'' editor [[Len Downie]], speaking at the [[Online News Association]]'s annual convention in [[Washington, D.C.]], said "Our largest driver of traffic is Matt Drudge."<ref name="epwapotraffic">{{cite web| last = Hirschman| first = David S.| title = 'Wash Post' Editor Downie: Everyone in Our Newsroom Wants to Be a Blogger| publisher = Editor & Publisher| date = 2006-10-06| url = http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003221716| accessdate = 2006-10-08 }}</ref>

On October 22, 2007, ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[Jim Rutenberg]] wrote that Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, including [[Hillary Clinton]], were cooperating with Drudge and "working harder than ever to get favorable coverage for their candidates&nbsp;â€“ or unfavorable coverage of competitors&nbsp;â€“ onto the Drudge Reportâ€™s home page, knowing that television producers, radio talk show hosts and newspaper reporters view it as a bulletin board for the latest news and gossip."<ref name="thenewyorktimes">{{cite news| last = Rutenberg| first = Jim| title = Clinton Finds Way to Play Along With Drudge| work = The New York Times| date = 2007-10-22| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/us/politics/22drudge.html?ei=5065&en=8e8c56803a2a987c&ex=1193630400&partner=MYWAY&pagewanted=print| accessdate = 2007-10-22}}</ref> Rutenberg stated that Nielsen/NetRatings shows that the Drudge Report gets three million unique visitors over the course of a month, or approximately one percent of the population of the [[United States]].

During the [[2012 Republican presidential primaries]], Drudge was described by some, including former presidential candidate [[Fred Thompson]], as having a pro-[[Mitt Romney]] slant.<ref name="mitt">{{cite news |last= Epstein| first= Jennifer | publisher= Politico| date=2012-01-29|accessdate=2014-05-03 | url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2012/01/fred-thompson-attacks-romney-campaign-for-having-drudge-112714.html|title=Thompson: Mitt campaign has 'Drudge in their back pocket'}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Drudge previously lived in [[Hollywood]]. As of 2007, he owned two properties in [[Miami]]&nbsp;â€“ a $1.4 million Mediterranean-style stucco house on [[Rivo Alto Island]],<ref name="nymagx"/> and a $1 million-plus condominium in Miami's [[Four Seasons Hotel Miami|Four Seasons hotel]].<ref name="sappell"/> By early 2009, Drudge earned millions of dollars a year, traveled extensively and moved to another property in Miami and had become reclusive.<ref name=TNR.com/> In 2003 he said his one indulgence, apart from travel, was his [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/16/1063625009939.html |title=Pushing others' news for profit&nbsp;â€“ smh.com.au |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=2009-10-04 | date=2003-09-16}}</ref>
