{{Executive}}

The '''president''' is a common title for the [[head of state]] in most republics.

The functions exercised by a president vary according to the form of [[government]]. In [[parliamentary republic]]s, they are usually, but not always, limited to those of the head of state, and are thus largely ceremonial. In [[presidential republic|presidential]], selected parliamentary (e.g. [[Botswana]] and [[South Africa]])<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 - Chapter 5: The President and National Executive|website=www.gov.za|url=https://www.gov.za/documents/constitution-republic-south-africa-1996-chapter-5-president-and-national-executive|date=2012|accessdate=17 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Allard |first1=P |title=Government social advertising and ethno-politics in a small, ethnically diverse nation |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324005565 |website=ResearchGate |accessdate=17 April 2019 |date=2016|page=67}}</ref> and [[semi-presidential republic]]s, the role of the president is more prominent, encompassing also (in most cases) the functions of the [[head of government]].<ref name="Comparative-Exec-Leg-relat">{{cite book |author1=Shugart, MS |editor1-last=Binder |editor1-first=SA |editor2-last=Rhodes |editor2-first=RAW |editor3-last=Rockman |editor3-first=BA |title=The Oxford handbook of political institutions |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-199548460 |url=https://calgara.github.io/Pol1_Fall2017/Shugart%202016.pdf |accessdate=17 April 2019 |chapter=Comparative Executive–Legislative Relations|year=2008 |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199548460.003.0018}}</ref> In authoritarian regimes, a [[dictator]] or leader of a [[one-party state]] may also be called a president.

== Description ==
The title ''president'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''prae-'' "before" + ''sedere'' "to sit." As such, it originally designated the officer who presides over or "sits before" a gathering and ensures that debate is conducted according to the [[rules of order]] (''see also'' [[chairman]] and [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]), but today it most commonly refers to an executive official in any social organization. Early examples are from the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (from 1464) and the founding [[president of the Royal Society]] [[William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker|William Brouncker]] in 1660. This usage survives today in the title of such offices as "[[President of the Board of Trade]]" and "[[Lord President of the Council]]" in the [[United Kingdom]], as well as "President of the Senate" in the [[United States]] (one of the roles constitutionally assigned to the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]). The officiating priest at certain [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] religious services, too, is sometimes called the "president" in this sense. However, the most common modern usage is as the title of a [[head of state]] in a [[republic]].

In pre-revolutionary [[France]], the president of a ''[[Parlement]]'' evolved into a powerful [[magistrate]], a member of the so-called ''[[noblesse de robe]]'' ("[[nobility]] of the gown"), with considerable judicial as well as administrative authority. The name referred to his primary role of presiding over trials and other hearings. In the 17th and 18th centuries, seats in the ''Parlements,'' including presidencies, became effectively hereditary, since the holder of the office could ensure that it would pass to an heir by paying the crown a special tax known as the ''[[paulette (tax)|paulette]]''. The post of "first president" (''premier président''), however, could only be held by the [[King of France|King]]'s nominees. The ''Parlements'' were abolished by the [[French Revolution]]. In modern France the chief judge of a court is known as its president (''président de la cour'').

The word "presidents" is also used in the [[King James Bible]] at [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 6:2 to translate the [[Aramaic]] term סָרְכִ֣ין ''(sā·rə·ḵîn)'', a word of likely Persian origin, meaning "officials", "commissioners", "overseers" or "chiefs".

The first usage of the word ''president'' to denote the highest official in a government was during the [[Commonwealth of England]]. After the abolition of the monarchy the English [[English Council of State|Council of State]], whose members were elected by the House of Commons, became the [[executive (government)|executive]] government of the Commonwealth. The Council of State was the successor of the [[Privy Council]], which had previously been headed by the [[Lord President of the Council|lord president]]; its successor the Council of State was also headed by a lord president, the first of which was [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]]. However, the lord president alone was not head of state, because that office was vested in the council as a whole.

The modern usage of the term ''president'' to designate a single person who is the [[head of state]] of a [[republic]] can be traced directly to the [[United States Constitution]] of 1787, which created the office of [[President of the United States]]. Previous American governments had included "presidents" (such as the [[president of the Continental Congress]] or the president of the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]]), but these were presiding officers in the older sense, with no executive authority. It has been suggested that the executive use of the term was borrowed from early American colleges and universities, which were usually headed by a ''president.'' British universities were headed by an official called the "[[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]]" (typically a ceremonial position) while the chief administrator held the title of "[[Vice-Chancellor]]". But America's first institutions of higher learning (such as [[Harvard University]] and [[Yale University]]) didn't resemble a full-sized university so much as one of its constituent colleges. A number of colleges at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] featured an official called the "president". The head, for instance, of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]] was called the ''master'' and his second the ''president.'' The first president of Harvard, [[Henry Dunster]], had been educated at Magdalene. Some have speculated that he borrowed the term out of a sense of humility, considering himself only a temporary place-holder. The presiding official of Yale College, originally a "rector" (after the usage of continental European universities), became "president" in 1745.

A common style of address for presidents, "[[Mr. President (title)|Mr/Mrs. President]]," is borrowed from British Parliamentary tradition, in which the presiding Speaker of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] is referred to as "Mr/Mrs. Speaker." Coincidentally, this usage resembles the older French custom of referring to the president of a ''parlement'' as "''Monsieur/Madame le Président''", a form of address that in modern France applies to both the [[President of the French Republic|president of the Republic]] and to chief judges. Similarly, the Speaker of the [[House of Commons of Canada]] is addressed by [[francophone]] parliamentarians as "''Monsieur/Madame le/la Président(e)''". In [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]]'s novel ''[[Les Liaisons Dangereuses]]'' of 1782, the character identified as ''Madame la Présidente de Tourvel'' ("Madam President of Tourvel") is the wife of a magistrate in a ''parlement''. The fictional name Tourvel refers not to the ''parlement'' in which the magistrate sits, but rather, in imitation of an aristocratic title, to his private estate.

Once the United States adopted the title of "president" for its republican head of state, many other nations followed suit. [[Haiti]] became the first presidential republic in [[Latin America]] when [[Henri Christophe]] assumed the title in 1807. Almost all of the American nations that became independent from [[Spain]] in the early 1810s and 1820s chose a US-style president as their chief executive. The first European president was the president of the [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic of 1802]], a [[Sister Republic|client state]] of revolutionary France, in the person of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. The first [[Africa]]n president was the [[president of Liberia]] (1848),<ref>Emma J.

In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the powers of presidencies have varied from country to country. The spectrum of power has included presidents-for-life and hereditary presidencies to ceremonial heads of state.

Presidents in the countries with a democratic or representative form of [[government]] are usually elected for a specified period of time and in some cases may be re-elected by the same process by which they are appointed, i.e. in many nations, periodic popular elections. The powers vested in such presidents vary considerably. Some presidencies, such as that of [[President of Ireland|Ireland]], are largely ceremonial, whereas other systems vest the president with substantive powers such as the appointment and dismissal of [[prime minister]]s or [[Cabinet (government)|cabinets]], the power to declare [[war]], and powers of [[veto]] on legislation. In many nations the president is also the [[commander-in-chief]] of the nation's armed forces, though once again this can range from a ceremonial role to one with considerable authority.

===Presidential systems===
{{main|President of the Republic}}
[[File:Dilma and Obama 2011.jpg|thumb|Presidents [[Barack Obama]] and [[Dilma Rousseff]] of the United States and Brazil.]]
In almost all states with a [[presidential system]] of government, the president exercises the functions of [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], i.e. the president directs the executive branch of government. When a president is not only head of state, but also head of government, this is known in Europe as a ''President of Counsel'' (from the French ''Présidente du Conseil''), used 1871-1940 and 1944–1958 in the [[Third French Republic|Third]] and [[Fourth French Republic]]s. In the [[United States]] the president has always been both Head of State and Head of Government and has always had the title of President.

Presidents in this system are either directly elected by popular vote or indirectly elected by an electoral college or some other democratically elected body.

In the [[United States]], the [[President of the United States|president]] is indirectly elected by the [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]] made up of electors chosen by voters in the presidential election. In most states of the United States, each elector is committed to voting for a specified candidate determined by the popular vote in each state, so that the people, in voting for each elector, are in effect voting for the candidate. However, for various reasons the numbers of electors in favour of each candidate are unlikely to be proportional to the popular vote. Thus, in five close United States elections ([[1824 U.S. presidential election|1824]], [[1876 U.S. presidential election|1876]], [[1888 U.S. presidential election|1888]], [[2000 U.S. presidential election|2000]], and [[2016 U.S. presidential election|2016]]), the candidate with the most popular votes still lost the election.
[[File:President Bush and President Johnson Sirleaf, 2008.jpg|thumb|Presidents [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf|Johnson-Sirleaf]] and [[George W. Bush|Bush]] of Liberia and the United States.]]
In [[Mexico]], the [[President of Mexico|president]] is directly elected for a six-year term by popular vote. The candidate who wins the most votes is elected president even without an absolute majority. The president may never get another term. The [[2006 Mexican general election|2006 Mexican elections]] had a fierce competition, the electoral results showed a minimal difference between the two most voted candidates and such difference was just about the 0.58% of the total vote. The [[Federal Electoral Tribunal]] declared an elected president after a controversial post-electoral process.

In [[Brazil]], the [[President of Brazil|president]] is directly elected for a four-year term by popular vote. A candidate has to have more than 50% of the valid votes. If no candidates achieve a majority of the votes, there is a [[runoff election]] between the two candidates with most votes. Again, a candidate needs a majority of the vote to be elected. In Brazil, a president cannot be elected to more than two consecutive terms, but there is no limit on the number of terms a president can serve.

Many [[South America]]n, [[Central America]]n, [[Africa]]n and some [[Asia]]n nations follow the presidential model.

===Semi-presidential systems===
[[File:Macron Digital Summit.jpg|alt=|thumb|253x253px|[[Emmanuel Macron]], President of France]]
A second system is the [[semi-presidential system]], also known as the [[France|French]] model. In this system, as in the parliamentary system, there are both a president and a prime minister; but unlike the parliamentary system, the president may have significant day-to-day power. For example, in France, when their party controls the majority of seats in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], the [[President of France|president]] can operate closely with the parliament and [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]], and work towards a common agenda. When the National Assembly is controlled by their opponents, however, the president can find themselves marginalized with the opposition party prime minister exercising most of the power. Though the prime minister remains an appointee of the president, the president must obey the rules of parliament, and select a leader from the house's majority holding party. Thus, sometimes the president and prime minister can be allies, sometimes rivals; the latter situation is known in France as [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]. Variants of the French semi-presidential system, developed at the beginning of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] by [[Charles de Gaulle]], are used in [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Sri Lanka]] and several [[post-colonial]] countries which have emulated the French model. In Finland, although the 2000 constitution moved towards a ceremonial presidency, the system is still formally semi-presidential, with the [[president of Finland]] retaining e.g. foreign policy and appointment powers.

===Parliamentary republics===

{{see also|Parliamentary system|Parliamentary republic}}
The [[parliamentary republic]], is a parliamentary system in which the presidency is largely ceremonial with either ''[[de facto]]'' or no significant executive authority (such as the [[president of Austria]]) or ''[[de jure]]'' no significant executive power (such as the [[president of Ireland]]), and the executive powers rests with the [[Prime Minister|prime minister]] who automatically assumes the post as head of a majority party or coalition, but takes oath of office administered by the president. However, the president is head of the civil service, commander in chief of the armed forces and in some cases can dissolve parliament. Countries using this system include [[Austria]], [[Armenia]], [[Albania]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]],<ref>But presidential moral suasion is increasingly confirming that the "neutral powers", in this country, often find in the head of state the best defender from executive interference: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero |title = Autorità indipendenti e sistema costituzionale |journal= L'Ago e Il Filo|date=2014| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89422474}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> [[Malta]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Singapore]].

A variation of the [[parliamentary republic]] is a system with an [[executive president]] in which the president is the head of state and the government but unlike a [[presidential system]], is elected by and accountable to a parliament, and referred to as president. Countries using this system include [[Botswana]], [[Nauru]] and [[South Africa]].

===Dictatorships===
{{multiple image|align=right|direction=horizontal|caption_align=center|image1=Jenderal_TNI_Soeharto.png|width1=132|footer=[[Suharto]] (L) and [[Saddam Hussein]] (R) are examples of dictatorial leaders who used the title "President".|image2=Saddam Hussain 1980 (cropped).jpg|width2=131}}
In [[dictatorship]]s, the title of president is frequently taken by self-appointed or military-backed leaders. Such is the case in many states: [[Idi Amin]] in [[Uganda]], [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in [[Zaire]], [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in the [[Philippines]], [[Suharto]] in [[Indonesia]], and [[Saddam Hussein]] in [[Iraq]] are some examples. Other presidents in authoritarian states have wielded only symbolic or no power such as [[Craveiro Lopes]] in [[Portugal]] and [[Joaquín Balaguer]] under the "Trujillo Era" of the [[Dominican Republic]].

[[President for Life]] is a title assumed by some [[dictator]]s to try to ensure that their authority or legitimacy is never questioned. Ironically, most leaders who proclaim themselves president for life do not in fact successfully serve a life term. On the other hand, presidents like [[Alexandre Pétion]], [[Rafael Carrera]], [[Josip Broz Tito]] and [[François Duvalier]] died in office. [[Kim Il-sung]] was named [[Eternal President of the Republic]] after his death.

===Collective presidency===
[[File:Bundesrat der Schweiz 2015.jpg|thumb|The seven-member [[Swiss Federal Council]] serves as collective [[head of government]] and [[head of state|state]] of [[Switzerland]].]]

Only a tiny minority of modern republics do not have a single head of state. Some examples of this are:
* [[Switzerland]], where the headship of state is collectively vested in the seven-member [[Swiss Federal Council]], although there is also a [[President of the Swiss Confederation|president of the Confederation]], who is a member of the Federal Council elected by the [[Federal Assembly of Switzerland|Federal Assembly]] (the Swiss [[parliament]]) for a year ([[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] mandates that the post rotates every [[New Year's Day]]).
* The [[Captains Regent]] of [[San Marino]] elected by the [[Grand and General Council]].
* In the former [[Soviet Union]] 1922–1938 there existed an office of collective head of state known as [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union]] that consisted of four and later seven chairmen representing all [[union republics]] central executive committees from Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Trans-Caucasus and from 1925 Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan.
* In the former [[Soviet Union]], while the real power was exercised by the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Soviet Communist Party]], the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] executed powers of collective [[head of state]], and its [[Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|chairman]] was often called "president" in the [[Western Bloc|West]].
* [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] after the [[Death and state funeral of Josip Broz Tito|death]] of [[Josip Broz Tito]], where a [[Presidency of Yugoslavia|presidency]] consisting of members from each [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia#Federal subjects|federal unit]] ruled the country until its [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|breakup]].
* [[Ukraine]], in 1918 – 1920 there existed [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] composed of seven leaders of parliamentary factions and served as a collective head of state.
* The [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]
* [[National Council of Government (Uruguay)|National Council of Government]] in [[Uruguay]] from 1952 until 1967
* [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] in [[Nicaragua]] from 1979 until 1985

=== One-party states ===
The [[President of the People's Republic of China|President of China]] is the [[head of state]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Under the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|country's constitution]], the presidency is a largely [[Figurehead|ceremonial office]] with limited power. However, since 1993, as a matter of convention, the presidency has been held simultaneously by the [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party]], the [[Paramount leader|top leader]] in the [[One-party state|one party system]].

Between 1982 and 2018, the constitution stipulated that the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms. During the Mao era and also since 2018, there were no [[term limits]] attached to this office. In 2018, the term limits of the presidency were abolished, but its powers and ceremonial role were unchanged.

=== Presidential symbols ===
As the country's head of state, in most countries the president is entitled to certain perquisites, and may have a prestigious residence, often a lavish mansion or palace, sometimes more than one (e.g. summer and winter residences, or a country retreat) Customary symbols of office may include an official uniform, decorations, a presidential seal, coat of arms, flag and other visible accessories, as well as military honours such as [[gun salute]]s, [[ruffles and flourishes]], and a presidential guard. A common presidential symbol is the [[presidential sash]] worn most often by presidents in [[Latin America]] and [[Africa]] as a symbol of the continuity of the office.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCullough|first1=J.

== Titles for non-heads of state ==

=== As head of government ===
Some countries with parliamentary systems use a term meaning/translating as "president" (in some languages indistinguishable from chairman) for the head of parliamentary government, often as President of the Government, [[President of the Council of Ministers]] or [[President of the Executive Council (disambiguation)|President of the Executive Council]].

However, such an official is explicitly not the president of the ''country''. Rather, he/she is called a president in an older sense of the word, to denote the fact that he/she heads the ''[[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]''. A separate [[head of state]] generally exists in their country that instead serves as the president or monarch of the country.

Thus, such officials are really [[premier]]s, and to avoid confusion are often described simply as 'prime minister' when being mentioned internationally.

There are several examples for this kind of presidency:
* The [[Prime Minister of Spain]] is officially referred to as the president of the Government of [[Spain]], and informally known as the "president". Spain is also a kingdom with a reigning [[King of Spain|king]].
* The official title of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]] is [[President of the Council of Ministers]] (''[[Italian language|Italian]] Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri'')
* Under the French [[French Third Republic|Third]] and the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republics]], the "[[President of the Council of Ministers|President of the Council]]" (of ministers – or prime minister) was the head of government, with the [[President of the French Republic|President of the Republic]] a largely symbolic figurehead.
* The [[Prime minister]] of the [[Irish Free State]] from 1922 to 1937 was titled [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State]]. At the same time, the Irish Free State was a constitutional monarchy with a reigning monarch, the [[Monarchy in the Irish Free State|King of Ireland]], as well as a resident [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]] carrying out many head of state functions.
* Under the [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] of [[Brazil]] and [[Portugal]], the president of the Council of Ministers (''[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] Presidente do Conselho de Ministros'') was the head of government, with the [[Monarch]] being the head of State. Under the [[Portuguese First Republic|Portuguese First]] and [[New State (Portugal)|Second Republics]], the head of government was the president of the [[Ministry (collective executive)|Ministry]] (''Portuguese Presidente do Ministério'') and then the president of the Council of Ministers, with the [[President of Portugal|president of the Republic]] as the head of State.
* The official title of the [[Prime Minister of Croatia|Croatian prime minister]] is President of the Government of the Republic of Croatia ({{lang-hr|Predsjednik Vlade Republike Hrvatske}}).
* The official title of the [[Prime Minister of Poland|Polish prime minister]] is [[President of the Council of Ministers]] (''[[Polish language|Polish]] Prezes Rady Ministrów'').
* In British constitutional practice, the chairman of an [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]], acting in such a capacity, is known as a president of the Executive Council. Usually this person is the [[Governor]] and it always stays like that.
* Between 1918 and 1934, [[Estonia]] had no separate head of state. Both [[Prime Minister of Estonia|prime ministers]] (1918-1920) and [[State Elder|state elder]]s (1920-1934) often translated as "presidents") were elected by the parliament.

=== Other executive positions ===

==== Sub-national ====
''President'' can also be the title of the chief executive at a lower administrative level, such as the [[Parish President|parish president]]s of the [[parish]]es of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Louisiana]], the presiding member of city council for villages in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Illinois]], or the [[municipal president]]s of [[Mexico]]'s [[municipio (Mexico)|municipalities]]. Perhaps the best known sub-national presidents are the [[borough president]]s of the [[borough (New York City)|five boroughs]] of [[New York City]].

=====Poland=====
In Poland the ''President of the City'' ({{lang-pl|Prezydent miasta}}) is the executive authority of the municipality elected in direct elections, the equivalent of the [[mayor]]. The Office of the President (Mayor) is also found in Germany and Switzerland.

=====Russia=====
Governors of [[Russian republics|ethnic republics]] in the [[Russian Federation]] used to have the title of President, occasionally alongside other, secondary titles such as ''Chairman of the Government'' (also used by [[Prime Minister of Russia]]). This likely reflects the origin of Russian republics as homelands for various ethnic groups: while all [[federal subjects of Russia]] are currently ''[[de jure]]'' [[Symmetric federalism|equal]], their predecessors, the [[Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics of the Soviet Union|ASSR]]s, used to [[asymmetric federalism|enjoy more privileges]] than the ordinary krais and oblasts of the [[RSFSR]] (such as greater representation in the [[Soviet of Nationalities]]). Thus, the ASSRs and their eventual successors would have more in common with [[nation-state]]s than with ordinary administrative divisions, at least in spirit, and would choose titles accordingly.

Over the course of the 2010s the presidents of Russian republics would progressively change their title to that of [[Head]] ({{lang-ru|глава}}), a proposition suggested by the [[president of Chechnya]] [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] and later made law by the [[Parliament of Russia]] and President [[Dmitriy Medvedev]] in 2010. Despite this, however, presidents of [[Tatarstan]] would reject this change and, as of 2017, retain their title in defiance of Russian law. The new title did not result in any changes in the powers wielded by the governors.

=====United Kingdom=====
The [[Lord President of the Council|lord president of the Council]] is one of the [[Great Officer of State|Great Officers of State]] in [[England]] who presides over meetings of British [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]; the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] headed by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] is technically a committee of the Council, and all decisions of the Cabinet are formally approved through [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]]. Although the lord president is a member of the Cabinet, the position is largely a ceremonial one and is traditionally given to either the [[leader of the House of Commons]] or the [[leader of the House of Lords]].

Historically the [[president of the Board of Trade]] was a cabinet member.

======Dependencies======
In [[Alderney]], the elected head of government is called the [[president of the States of Alderney]].

In the [[Isle of Man]], there is a [[president of Tynwald]].

=====Spain=====
In [[Spain]], the executive leaders of the [[autonomous communities]] (regions) are called presidents. In each community, they can be called ''Presidente de la Comunidad'' or ''Presidente del Consejo'' among others. They are elected by their respective regional assemblies and have similar powers to a state president or governor.

====Deputies====
Below a president, there can be a number of or "vice presidents" (or occasionally "deputy presidents") and sometimes several "assistant presidents" or "assistant vice presidents", depending on the organisation and its size. These posts do not hold the same power but more of a subordinate position to the president. However, power can be transferred in special circumstances to the deputy or vice president. Normally vice presidents hold some power and special responsibilities below that of the president. The difference between vice/deputy presidents and assistant/associate vice presidents is the former are legally allowed to run an organisation, exercising the same powers (as well as being second in command) whereas the latter are not.

===Legislatures===
In some countries the speaker of their unicameral legislatures, or of one or both houses of bicameral legislatures, the speakers have the title of president of "the body", as in the case of [[Spain]], where the Speaker of the Congress is the [[president of the Congress of Deputies]] and the Speaker of the Senate is the [[President of the Spanish Senate|president of the Senate]].

===Judiciary===
====France====
In [[France|French]] legal terminology, the president of a court consisting of multiple [[judge]]s is the foremost judge; he chairs the meeting of the court and directs the debates (and this thus addressed as "Mrs President", "Madame la Présidente", Mr President", or ''Monsieur le Président''. In general, a court comprises several chambers, each with its own president; thus the most senior of these is called the "first president" (as in: "the First President of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] is the most senior judge in France"). Similarly in English legal practice the most senior judge in each division uses this title (e.g. President of the Family Division, President of the Court of Appeal).

====Spain====
In the [[Spanish Judiciary]], the leader of a court of multiples judges is called President of the Court. The same happens with the different bodies of the Spanish judicial system, where we can find a [[President of the Supreme Court of Spain|president of the Supreme Court]], a [[Audiencia Nacional|president of the National Court]] and presidents in the [[Superior Court of Justice of Spain|Regional High Courts of Justice]] and in the Provincial Courts. The body that rules over the Judiciary in Spain is the [[General Council of the Judiciary]], and its president is the president of the Supreme Court, which is normally called ''President of the Supreme Court and of the GCJ''.

The [[Constitutional Court of Spain|Constitutional Court]] is not part of the Judiciary, but the leader of it is called [[President of the Constitutional Court (Spain)|President of the Constitutional Court]].

====United Kingdom====
In the recently established [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], the most senior judge is called the [[President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|president of the Supreme Court]]. The lady/lord president of the Court of Session is head of the judiciary in [[Scotland]], and presiding judge (and Senator) of the [[College of Justice]] and [[Court of Session]], as well as being Lady/Lord Justice General of Scotland and head of the [[High Court of Justiciary]], the offices having been combined in 1784.
