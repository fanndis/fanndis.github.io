Georgia is defined by a diversity of landscapes, flora, and fauna. The state's northernmost regions include the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the larger [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian Mountain]] system. The [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] plateau extends from the [[foothills]] of the Blue Ridge south to the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]], an [[escarpment]] to the [[coastal plain]] defining the state's southern region. Georgia's highest point is [[Brasstown Bald]] at 4,784 feet (1,458 m) above sea level; the lowest is the Atlantic Ocean. With the exception of some high-altitude areas in the Blue Ridge, the entirety of the state has a [[humid subtropical climate]].

==History==

{{Main|History of Georgia (U.S. state)}}

Before settlement by Europeans, Georgia was inhabited by the [[Mound builder (people)|mound building]] cultures. The British colony of Georgia was founded by [[James Oglethorpe]] on February 12, 1733.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgia.gov/georgia-facts-and-symbols|title=Georgia Facts and Symbols—Georgia.gov|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524123552/http://georgia.gov/georgia-facts-and-symbols|archivedate=May 24, 2014}}</ref> The colony was administered by the [[Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America]] under a charter issued by (and named for) [[King George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. The Trustees implemented an elaborate plan for the colony's settlement, known as the [[Oglethorpe Plan]], which envisioned an agrarian society of [[Yeoman|yeoman farmers]] and prohibited slavery. The colony was [[Invasion of Georgia (1742)|invaded by the Spanish]] in 1742, during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]]. In 1752, after the government failed to renew subsidies that had helped support the colony, the Trustees turned over control to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|crown]]. Georgia became a [[Crown colony#History|crown colony]], with a governor appointed by the king.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-816 |title=Trustee Georgia, 1732–1752 |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=July 27, 2009 |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref>

The [[Province of Georgia]] was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that revolted against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] rule in the [[American Revolution]] by signing the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. The State of Georgia's first constitution was ratified in February 1777. Georgia was the 10th state to ratify the Articles of Confederation on July 24, 1778,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/articles.html |title=The Articles of Confederation: Primary Documents of American History (Virtual Programs & Services, Library of Congress) |publisher=Loc.gov |date=July 10, 2014 |accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref> and was the 4th state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]] on January 2, 1788.

After the [[Creek War|Creek War (1813–1814)]], General [[Andrew Jackson]] forced the [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Muscogee (Creek) tribes]] to surrender land to the state of Georgia, including in the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson|Treaty of Fort Jackson (1814)]], surrendering 21 million acres in what is now southern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and central Alabama, and the [[Treaty of Indian Springs (1825)]].<ref name="Remini">{{cite book|last=Remini|first=Robert|title=Andrew Jackson: The Course of American Empire, 1767–1821. Vol. 1|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1998|isbn=0801859115|chapter=The Creek War: Victory|origyear=1977}}</ref> In 1829, gold was discovered in the [[North Georgia mountains]] leading to the [[Georgia Gold Rush]] and establishment of a [[United States mint|federal mint]] in [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], which continued in operation until 1861. The resulting influx of white settlers put pressure on the government to take land from the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]]. In 1830, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Jackson]] signed the [[Indian Removal Act]], sending many eastern Native American nations to [[Indian reservation|reservations]] in present-day Oklahoma, including all of Georgia's tribes. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'' (1832) that U.S. states were not permitted to redraw Indian boundaries, President Jackson and the state of Georgia ignored the ruling. In 1838, his successor, [[Martin Van Buren]], dispatched federal troops to gather the tribes and deport them west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]. This forced relocation, known as the [[Trail of Tears]], led to the death of more than four thousand Cherokees.

In early 1861, Georgia joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] (with secessionists having a slight majority of delegates)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/government-politics/georgia-secession-convention-1861|title=Georgia Secession Convention of 1861|last=|first=|date=|website=georgiaencyclopedia.org|publisher=Georgia Humanities|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190127205831/https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/government-politics/georgia-secession-convention-1861|archive-date=January 27, 2019|url-status=|accessdate=January 27, 2019}}</ref> and became a major [[Theater (warfare)|theater]] of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Major battles took place at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]], [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain|Kennesaw Mountain]], and [[Atlanta]]. In December 1864, a large swath of the state from [[Atlanta]] to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] was destroyed during General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]. 18,253 Georgian soldiers died in service, roughly one of every five who served.<ref>"[http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/versions/hr989_LC_94_5133_a_2.htm A Resolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030065659/http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/versions/hr989_LC_94_5133_a_2.htm |date=October 30, 2012 }}".

An Atlanta-born [[Baptists|Baptist minister]] who was part of the educated middle class that had developed in Atlanta's African-American community, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] emerged as a national leader in the [[civil rights movement]]. King joined with others to form the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) in Atlanta in 1957 to provide political leadership for the Civil Rights Movement across the South.

On February 5, 1958, during a training mission flown by a [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|B-47]], a [[Mark 15 nuclear bomb]], also known as the [[Tybee Bomb]], was lost off the coast of [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Tybee Island]] near Savannah.

By the 1960s, the proportion of African Americans in Georgia had declined to 28% of the state's population, after waves of migration to the North and some in-migration by whites.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}, accessed March 13, 2008</ref> With their voting power diminished, it took some years for African Americans to win a state-wide office. [[Julian Bond]], a noted civil rights leader, was elected to the state House in 1965, and served multiple terms there and in the state senate.

Atlanta Mayor [[Ivan Allen, Jr.]] testified before Congress in support of the Civil Rights Act, and Governor [[Carl Sanders]] worked with the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration to ensure the state's compliance. [[Ralph McGill]], editor and syndicated columnist at the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'', earned admiration by writing in support of the Civil Rights Movement. In 1970, newly elected Governor [[Jimmy Carter]] declared in his inaugural address that the era of racial segregation had ended. In 1972 Georgians elected [[Andrew Young]] to Congress as the first African American Congressman since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].

In 1980, construction was completed on an expansion of what is now named [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] (ATL). The busiest and most efficient airport in the world, it accommodates more than a hundred million passengers annually.<ref name=HJAA>{{cite web |title=Atlanta's Hartsfield–Jackson International: Facts About The World's Busiest Airport |url=http://amaconferencecentersspeak.com/atlantas-hartsfield-jackson-international-facts-about-the-worlds-busiest-airport/ |website=amaconferencecentersspeak.com |publisher=American Management Association |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |date=March 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128044530/http://amaconferencecentersspeak.com/atlantas-hartsfield-jackson-international-facts-about-the-worlds-busiest-airport/ |archive-date=January 28, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Employing more than 60,000 people, the airport became a major engine for economic growth.<ref name=HJAA/> With the advantages of cheap real estate, low taxes, [[right-to-work law]]s and a regulatory environment limiting government interference, the Atlanta metropolitan area became a national center of [[finance]], [[insurance]], [[technology]], [[manufacturing]], [[real estate]], [[logistics]], and [[transportation]] companies, as well as the film, convention, and trade show businesses. As a testament to the city's growing international profile, in 1990 the [[International Olympic Committee]] selected [[Atlanta]] as the site of the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. Taking advantage of Atlanta's status as a transportation hub, in 1991 [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] established its headquarters in a suburb. In 1992, construction finished on [[Bank of America Plaza (Atlanta)|Bank of America Plaza]], the tallest building in the U.S. outside of New York or Chicago.

===Boundaries===

Beginning from the Atlantic Ocean, the state's eastern border with South Carolina runs up the [[Savannah River]], northwest to its origin at the [[confluence]] of the [[Tugaloo River|Tugaloo]] and [[Seneca River (South Carolina)|Seneca Rivers]]. It then continues up the Tugaloo (originally Tugalo) and into the [[Chattooga River]], its most significant [[tributary]]. These bounds were decided in the 1797 [[Treaty of Beaufort]], and tested in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in the two ''[[Georgia v. South Carolina]]'' cases in 1923 and 1989.{{fact|date=May 2020}}

The border then takes a sharp turn around the tip of [[Rabun County, Georgia|Rabun County]], at [[35th parallel north|latitude 35°N]], though from this point it diverges slightly south (due to inaccuracies in the original survey). This northern border was originally the Georgia and North Carolina border all the way to the [[Mississippi River]], until [[Tennessee]] was divided from [[North Carolina]], and the Yazoo companies induced the legislature of Georgia to pass an act, approved by the governor in 1795, to sell the greater part of Georgia's territory presently comprising [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcoybLve0aQC&pg=PA30 |author=Ulrich Bonnell Phillips|title= Georgia and state rights: a study of the political history of Georgia from the Revolution to the Civil War|publisher=Annual Report of American Historical Association for the 57th US Congress, 1901|page=30|accessdate=October 23, 2012|year=1902}}</ref>

The state's western border runs in a straight line south-southeastward from a point southwest of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], to meet the [[Chattahoochee River]] near [[West Point, Georgia|West Point]]. It continues downriver to the point where it joins the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]] (the confluence of the two forming Florida's [[Apalachicola River]]); the southern border goes almost due east and very slightly south, in a straight line to the [[St. Marys River (Florida/Georgia)|St. Mary's River]], which then forms the remainder of the boundary back to the ocean.{{fact|date=May 2020}}

The water boundaries are still set to be the original [[thalweg]] of the rivers. Since then, several have been inundated by lakes created by dams, including the [[ACF River Basin|Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint]] point now under [[Lake Seminole]].{{fact|date=May 2020}}

Georgia state legislators have claimed that in an 1818 survey the state's border with Tennessee was erroneously placed one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) farther south than intended, and they [[Tennessee-Georgia water dispute|still dispute it]].

===Geology and terrain===

{{Main|Geology of Georgia (U.S. state)}}
[[File:Map of Georgia elevations.png|thumb| ]]

Each region has its own distinctive characteristics. For instance, the Ridge and Valley, which lies in the northwest corner of the state, includes limestone, sandstone, shale, and other sedimentary rocks, which have yielded construction-grade limestone, barite, ocher, and small amounts of coal.

===Ecology===

===Flora===

The state of Georgia has approximately 250 tree species and 58 protected plants. Georgia's native trees include [[Juniperus virginiana|red cedar]], a variety of pines, oaks, hollies, [[Taxodium|cypress]], [[Liquidambar styraciflua|sweetgum]], scaly-bark and white [[hickory|hickories]], and [[sabal palmetto]]. East Georgia is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and conifer species as other broadleaf evergreen flora make up the majority of the southern and coastal regions. [[Gelsemium sempervirens|Yellow jasmine]] and [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] make up just a few of the flowering shrubs in the state.

===Fauna===

[[White-tailed deer|White-tailed (Virginia) deer]] are in nearly all counties. The [[northern mockingbird]] and [[brown thrasher]] are among the 160 bird species that live in the state.<ref name="city-data">{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/states/Georgia-Flora-and-fauna.html |title=Georgia—Flora and fauna |publisher=City-data.com |date= |accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref>

Reptiles include the [[eastern diamondback]], [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]], and [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|cottonmouth]] snakes as well as [[alligator]]s; amphibians include [[salamander]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s. There are about 79 species of reptile and 63 amphibians known to live in Georgia.<ref name="city-data"/>

The most popular freshwater game fish<!-- not sure "gamefish" should be here per se. More under tourism perhaps. --> are [[trout]], [[bream]], [[bass (fish)|bass]], and [[catfish]], all but the last of which are produced in state hatcheries for restocking. Popular saltwater game fish include [[red drum]], [[spotted seatrout]], [[flounder]], and [[tarpon]]. [[Porpoise]]s, whales, [[shrimp]], [[oyster]]s, and [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crabs]] are found inshore and offshore of the Georgia coast.<ref name="city-data"/>

[[File:Storm of the century satellite.gif|thumb|upright|Image of March [[1993 Storm of the Century]] covering the length of the east coast. The outline of Georgia is discernible in the center of the image.]]

The majority of the state is primarily a [[humid subtropical climate]]. Hot and humid summers are typical, except at the highest elevations. The entire state, including the [[North Georgia mountains]], receives moderate to heavy precipitation, which varies from 45&nbsp;inches (1143&nbsp;mm) in central Georgia<ref>[http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0346?from=search Monthly Averages for Macon, GA] ''The Weather Channel''.</ref> to approximately 75&nbsp;inches (1905&nbsp;mm) around the northeast part of the state.<ref>[http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0118?from=search Monthly Averages for Clayton, GA] ''The Weather Channel''.</ref> The degree to which the weather of a certain region of Georgia is subtropical depends on the latitude, its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean or [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the elevation. The latter factor is felt chiefly in the mountainous areas of the northern part of the state, which are farther away from the ocean and can be 4500 feet (1350 m) above sea level. The USDA plant [[hardiness zone]]s for Georgia range from zone 6b (no colder than {{convert|-5|F}} ) in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] to zone 8b (no colder than {{convert|15|F}} ) along the [[Atlantic]] coast and Florida border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-georgia-usda-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php |title=Georgia USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |accessdate=November 11, 2010}}</ref>

The highest temperature ever recorded is 112&nbsp;°F (44.4&nbsp;°C) in [[Louisville, Georgia|Louisville]] on July 24, 1952,<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/weather/wheat7.htm Each state's high temperature record] ''USA Today, last updated August 2004''.</ref> while the lowest is −17&nbsp;°F (−27.2&nbsp;°C) in northern [[Floyd County, Georgia|Floyd County]] on January 27, 1940.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/weather/wcstates.htm Each state's low temperature record] ''USA Today, last updated August 2006''</ref> Georgia is one of the leading states in frequency of [[tornado]]es, though they are rarely stronger than [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF1]].

With a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean, Georgia is also vulnerable to [[hurricane]]s, although direct hurricane strikes were rare during the 20th century. Georgia often is affected by hurricanes that strike the [[Florida Panhandle]], weaken over land, and bring strong [[tropical storm]] winds and heavy rain to the interior, a recent example being [[Hurricane Michael]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/ffc/2018_hurricane_michael|title=Hurricane Michael Hits Georgia|last=US Department of Commerce|first=NOAA|website=www.weather.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=May 5, 2019}}</ref> as well as hurricanes that come close to the Georgia coastline, brushing the coast on their way north without ever making landfall. [[Hurricane Matthew|Hurricane Matthew of 2016]] and [[Hurricane Dorian|Hurricane Dorian of 2019]] did just that.

{{as of|2004}}, 7.7% of Georgia's population was reported as under 5{{nbsp}}years of age, 26.4% under 18, and 9.6% were 65 or older. Also, {{as of|2004|lc=y}}, females made up approximately 50.6% of the population and African Americans made up approximately 29.6%.

Historically, about half of Georgia's population was composed of African Americans who, before the Civil War, were almost exclusively enslaved. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of hundreds of thousands of blacks from the rural South to the industrial North from 1914 to 1970 reduced the African American population.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.brookings.edu/urban/pubs/20040524_Frey.pdf |first=William H |last=Frey |title=The New Great Migration: Black Americans' Return to the South, 1965–2000 |publisher=The Brookings Institution |date=May 2004 |accessdate=May 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428042235/http://www.brookings.edu/urban/pubs/20040524_Frey.pdf |archivedate=April 28, 2008 }}</ref>

The colonial settlement of large numbers of [[Scottish American]], [[English American]] and [[Scotch-Irish American]]s in the mountains and piedmont, and coastal settlement by some [[English American]]s and African Americans, have strongly influenced the state's culture in food, language and music. The concentration of Africans imported to coastal areas in the 18th century repeatedly from rice-growing regions of West Africa led to the development of [[Gullah]]-Geechee language and culture in the Low Country among African Americans. They share a unique heritage in which African traditions of food, religion and culture were continued more than in some other areas. In the creolization of Southern culture, their foodways became an integral part of all Southern cooking in the Low Country.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Georgia | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080504151611/http://www.georgia.org/Travel/Early%2BMountain%2BLife.htm | archivedate = May 4, 2008 | url = http://www.georgia.org/Travel/Early+Mountain+Life.htm | title = Travel | contribution = Early Mountain Life | url-status=dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.well.com/~mp/gAmOrigins.html | publisher = The well | title = Who are Americans}}</ref>

As with all other U.S. states and the federal government, Georgia's government is based on the [[Separation of powers|separation of legislative, executive, and judicial power]].<ref>[http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2007_08/senate/senkids.htm Senate Kids]. Retrieved December 30, 2007. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222060944/http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2007_08/senate/senkids.htm |date=December 22, 2007 }}</ref> Executive authority in the state rests with the [[Governor (United States)|governor]], currently [[Brian Kemp]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]). Both the [[List of Governors of Georgia|Governor of Georgia]] and [[Lieutenant Governor of Georgia|lieutenant governor]] are elected on separate ballots to four-year terms of office. Unlike the federal government, but like many other U.S. States, most of the executive officials who comprise the governor's cabinet are elected by the citizens of Georgia rather than appointed by the governor.

Legislative authority resides in the [[Georgia General Assembly|General Assembly]], composed of the [[Georgia State Senate|Senate]] and [[Georgia House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Lieutenant Governor [[President of the Senate|presides over the Senate]], while members of the House of Representatives select their own Speaker. The [[Georgia (U.S. state) Constitution|Georgia Constitution]] mandates a maximum of 56 senators, elected from single-member districts, and a minimum of 180 representatives, apportioned among representative districts (which sometimes results in more than one representative per district); there are currently 56 senators and 180 representatives. The term of office for senators and representatives is two years.<ref>[http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/conart3.htm Constitution of Georgia Article III Section II].

State judicial authority rests with the state [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court]] and [[Georgia Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]], which have statewide authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gasupreme.us/court-information/history |title= The Supreme Court of Georgia History |website= [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]]|accessdate=November 26, 2016}}</ref> In addition, there are smaller courts which have more limited geographical jurisdiction, including Superior Courts, State Courts, Juvenile Courts, Magistrate Courts and Probate Courts. Justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals are elected statewide by the citizens in non-partisan elections to six-year terms. Judges for the smaller courts are elected to four-year terms by the state's citizens who live within that court's jurisdiction.

{{Further|List of counties in Georgia}}

Georgia consists of 159 [[County (United States)|counties]], second only to Texas, with 254.<ref>[http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/countyhistory.htm A Brief History of Georgia Counties].

Some counties have been named for prominent figures in both American and Georgian history, and many bear names with Native American origin. Counties in Georgia have their own elected legislative branch, usually called the Board of Commissioners, which usually also has executive authority in the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=/GovernmentPolitics/Government/LocalGovernment&id=h-589 |title=Georgia's County Governments |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=June 5, 2014 |accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref> Several counties have a [[sole Commissioner]] form of government, with legislative and executive authority vested in a single person. Georgia is the only state with current Sole Commissioner counties. Georgia's Constitution provides all counties and cities with "[[Home rule in the United States|home rule]]" authority. The county commissions have considerable power to pass legislation within their county, as a municipality would.

Georgia recognizes all local units of government as cities, so every incorporated town is legally a city. Georgia does not provide for [[township (United States)|townships]] or [[Independent city (United States)|independent cities]], though there have been bills proposed in the Legislature to provide for townships;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/townships-proposed-as-an-alternative-to-cities-in-/np8zh/ | title=Townships proposed as an alternative to cities in Georgia | work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=January 21, 2016 | accessdate=April 8, 2016 | author=Niesse, Mark}}</ref> it does allow [[consolidated city-county]] governments by local [[referendum]]. All of Georgia's second-tier cities except [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] have now formed consolidated city-county governments by referendum: [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]] (in 1970), [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]] (1990), [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] (1995), and [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] (2012). (Augusta and Athens have excluded one or more small, incorporated towns within their consolidated boundaries; Columbus and Macon eventually absorbed all smaller incorporated entities within their consolidated boundaries.) The small town of [[Cusseta, Georgia|Cusseta]] adopted a consolidated city-county government after it merged with unincorporated [[Chattahoochee County, Georgia|Chattahoochee County]] in 2003. Three years later, in 2006, the town of [[Georgetown, Quitman County, Georgia|Georgetown]] consolidated with the rest of [[Quitman County, Georgia|Quitman County]].

There is no true [[metropolitan government]] in Georgia, though the [[Atlanta Regional Commission]] (ARC) and [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority]] do provide some services, and the ARC must approve all major [[land development]] projects in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]].

===Elections===

{{Main|Elections in Georgia (U.S. state)}}
{{See also|Political party strength in Georgia (U.S. state)}}

Georgia had voted [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in six consecutive presidential elections from [[United States presidential election in Georgia, 1996|1996]] to [[United States presidential election in Georgia, 2016|2016]], a streak that was broken when the state went for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|Joe Biden]] in [[United States presidential election in Georgia, 2020|2020]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Georgia 2020 presidential election results|url=https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/state/georgia/president|access-date=2020-11-14|website=www.cnn.com|language=en}}</ref>

Until 1964, Georgia's state government had the longest unbroken record of single-party dominance, by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], of any state in the Union. This record was established largely due to the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement of most blacks]] and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws in the early 20th century. Some elements, such as requiring payment of poll taxes and passing literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted into the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early 20th century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://umich.edu/~lawrace/votetour6.htm | title=Race, Voting Rights, and Segregation | work=University of Michigan | accessdate=October 15, 2016}}</ref>

White Democrats regained power after Reconstruction due in part to the efforts of some using intimidation and violence, but this method came into disrepute.<ref name="auto1">{{cite book|last1=Saye|first1=Albert B.|title=A Constitutional History of Georgia, 1732–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kwD3PrldCfUC&q=1908%20georgia%20constitutional%20amendment&pg=PA336|publisher=University of Georgia Press|accessdate=May 18, 2016|isbn=9780820335544|date=May 1, 2010}}</ref> In 1900, shortly before Georgia adopted a disfranchising constitutional amendment in 1908, blacks comprised 47% of the state's population.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia]. Retrieved March 15, 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}</ref>

The whites dealt with this problem of potential political power by the 1908 amendment, which in practice disenfranchised blacks and poor whites, nearly half of the state population. It required that any male at least 21 years of age wanting to register to vote must also: (a) be of good character and able to pass a test on citizenship, (b) be able to read and write provisions of the U.S. and Georgia constitutions, or (c) own at least 40 acres of land or $500 in property. Any Georgian who had fought in any war from the [[American Revolution]] through the [[Spanish–American War]] was exempted from these additional qualifications. More importantly, any Georgian descended from a veteran of any of these wars also was exempted. Because by 1908 many white Georgia males were grandsons of veterans and/or owned the required property, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only well-to-do whites to vote. The qualifications of good character, citizenship knowledge, and literacy (all determined subjectively by white registrars), and property ownership were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering to vote. The voter rolls dropped dramatically.<ref name="auto1"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Georgia's 1908 Disfranchisement Constitutional Amendment|url=https://raycityhistory.wordpress.com/tag/georgias-1908-disfranchisement-constitutional-amendment/|website=Ray City History|publisher=Ray City Community Library|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}</ref> In the early 20th century, [[Progressivism|Progressives]] promoted electoral reform and reducing the power of ward bosses to clean up politics. Their additional rules, such as the eight-box law, continued to effectively close out people who were illiterate.<ref name="auto"/> White, one-party rule was solidified.

For more than 130 years, from 1872 to 2003, Georgians nominated and elected only white Democratic governors, and white Democrats held the majority of seats in the General Assembly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ourgeorgiahistory.com/history101/gahistory10.html |title=A State Divided |publisher=Ourgeorgiahistory.com |date= |accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref> Most of the Democrats elected throughout these years were [[Southern Democrats]], who were fiscally and socially conservative by national standards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17467202 |title=The long goodbye |publisher=Economist.com |date=November 11, 2010 |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/history/postwar.html |title=The Confident Years |publisher=Ngeorgia.com |date= |accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref> This voting pattern continued after the segregationist period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/07/us-usa-campaign-georgia-congress-idUSBRE8A61MZ20121107 |title=Last white Democrat in House from Deep South wins re-election |publisher=Reuters.com |date= 2012|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref>

Legal segregation was ended by passage of federal legislation in the 1960s. According to the 1960 census, the proportion of Georgia's population that was African American was 28%; hundreds of thousands of blacks had left the state in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to the North and Midwest. New white residents arrived through migration and immigration. Following support from the national Democratic Party for the civil rights movement and especially civil rights legislation of 1964 and 1965, most African-American voters, as well as other minority voters, have largely supported the Democratic Party in Georgia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/georgias-white-voters-elude-democrats/nSdq4 |title=White voters solidly in for GOP in Georgia (October 16, 2012) |publisher=Ajc.com |date=October 16, 2012 |accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref> In the decades since the late 20th century, the conservative white-majority voters have increasingly supported Republicans for national and state offices.

In 2002, incumbent moderate Democratic Governor [[Roy Barnes]] was defeated by Republican [[Sonny Perdue]], a state legislator and former Democrat. While Democrats retained control of the State House, they lost their majority in the Senate when four Democrats switched parties. They lost the House in the 2004 election. Republicans then controlled all three partisan elements of the state government.

Even before 2002, the state had become increasingly supportive of Republicans in Presidential elections. It has supported a Democrat for president only three times since 1960. In 1976 and 1980, native son [[Jimmy Carter]] carried the state; in 1992, the former Arkansas governor [[Bill Clinton]] narrowly won the state. Generally, Republicans are strongest in the predominantly white suburban (especially the Atlanta suburbs) and rural portions of the state.<ref name="CNN.com: Election 2004">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004//pages/results/states/GA/P/00/epolls.0.html |title=Election 2004 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref> Many of these areas were represented by conservative Democrats in the state legislature well into the 21st century. One of the most conservative of these was U.S. Congressman [[Larry McDonald]], former head of the [[John Birch Society]], who died when the [[Soviet Union]] shot down [[KAL 007]] near [[Sakhalin Island]]. Democratic candidates have tended to win a higher percentage of the vote in the areas where black voters are most numerous,<ref name="CNN.com: Election 2004"/> as well as in the cities among liberal urban populations (especially Atlanta and Athens), and the central and southwestern portion of the state.

The ascendancy of the Republican Party in Georgia and in the South in general resulted in Georgia [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] member [[Newt Gingrich]] being elected as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] following the election of a Republican majority in the House in 1994. Gingrich served as Speaker until 1999, when he resigned in the aftermath of the loss of House seats held by members of the GOP. Gingrich mounted an unsuccessful bid for president in the 2012 election, but withdrew after winning only the South Carolina and Georgia primaries.

In 2008, Democrat [[Jim Martin (Georgia politician)|Jim Martin]] ran against incumbent Republican Senator [[Saxby Chambliss]]. Chambliss failed to acquire the necessary 50 percent of votes due to a Libertarian Party candidate receiving the remainder of votes. In the [[runoff election]] held on December 2, 2008, Chambliss became the second Georgia Republican to be reelected to the U.S. Senate.

In the 2018 elections, the [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor]] remained a Republican (by 54,723 votes against a democratic [[African Americans|black]] [[female]], [[Stacey Abrams]]), Republicans lost eight seats in the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] (winning 106), while Democrats gained ten (winning 74), Republicans lost two seats in the [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia Senate]] (winning 35 seats), while Democrats gained two seats (winning 21), and five Democrat [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] were elected with Republicans winning nine seats (one winning with just 419 votes over the Democratic challenger, and one seat being lost).<ref>{{cite web |title=Georgia Election Results |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/election-results/georgia/ |website=washingtonpost.com |publisher=The Washington Post |access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Georgia House of Representatives elections, 2018 |url=https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2018 |website=ballotpedia.org |publisher=Ballotpedia |access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Georgia State Senate elections, 2018 |url=https://ballotpedia.org/Georgia_State_Senate_elections,_2018 |website=ballotpedia.org |publisher=Ballotpedia |access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref>

In the last three presidential elections as of 2018, the Republican candidate has won Georgia by approximately five to eight points over the Democratic nominee, at least once for each election being narrower than margins recorded in some states that have flipped within that timeframe, such as [[United States presidential elections in Michigan|Michigan]], [[United States presidential elections in Ohio|Ohio]] and [[United States presidential elections in Wisconsin|Wisconsin]]. Therefore, it could potentially be regarded as a [[swing state]] in future elections should voter preferences only shift slightly.

===Politics===

{{Main|Politics of Georgia (U.S. state)}}

During the 1960s and 1970s, Georgia made significant changes in civil rights and governance. As in many other states, its legislature had not reapportioned congressional districts according to population from 1931 to after the 1960 census. Problems of malapportionment in the state legislature, where rural districts had outsize power in relation to urban districts, such as Atlanta's, were corrected after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Wesberry v. Sanders]]'' (1964). The court ruled that congressional districts had to be reapportioned to have essentially equal populations.

A related case, ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), required state legislatures to end their use of geographical districts or counties in favor of "one man, one vote"; that is, districts based upon approximately equal populations, to be reviewed and changed as necessary after each census. These changes resulted in residents of Atlanta and other urban areas gaining political power in Georgia in proportion to their populations.<ref name="epstein">[https://books.google.com/books?id=CmPKNI2z5-AC&pg=PA753&lpg=PA753?+Apportionment?#v=onepage&q=Was%20Georgia%20dominated%20by%20rural%20districts%3F%20Apportionment%3F Lee Epstein, Thomas G. Walk, ''Constitutional Law: Rights, Liberties and Justice 8th Edition''], SAGE, 2012, p. 753</ref> From the mid-1960s, the voting electorate increased after African Americans' rights to vote were enforced under civil rights law.

Economic growth through this period was dominated by Atlanta and its region. It was a bedrock of the emerging "[[New South]]". From the late 20th century, Atlanta attracted headquarters and relocated workers of national companies, becoming more diverse, liberal and cosmopolitan than many areas of the state.

In the 21st century, many conservative Democrats, including former U.S. Senator and governor [[Zell Miller]], decided to support Republicans. The state's socially conservative bent results in wide support for such measures as restrictions on abortion. In 2004, a state constitutional amendment banning [[same-sex marriage]]s was approved by 76% of voters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Georgia_Constitutional_Amendment_1_%282004%29 |title=Georgia Marriage Amendment, Question 1 (2004) |publisher=Ballotpedia |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> However, after the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in ''[[Obergefell v.
