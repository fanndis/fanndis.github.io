The '''Embassy of the United States of America in Jerusalem''' is the [[diplomatic mission]] of the [[United States|United States of America]] to the [[Israel|State of Israel]], located in the [[Talpiot]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]]. In mid-October 2018, the [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Mike Pompeo]] announced that the Embassy in Jerusalem would be merging with the [[Consulate General of the United States, Jerusalem|US Consulate-General in Jerusalem]] into a single mission. Relations with the [[Palestinians]] would still be conducted through a special Palestinian Affairs Unit inside the Embassy.<ref name="State Department Oct 2018">{{cite web |last1=Pompeo |first1=Mike |title=On the Merging of U.S. Embassy Jerusalem and U.S. Consulate General Jerusalem |url=https://jru.usconsulate.gov/on-the-merging-of-u-s-embassy-jerusalem-and-u-s-consulate-general-jerusalem/ |publisher=U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem |accessdate=21 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211211903/https://jru.usconsulate.gov/on-the-merging-of-u-s-embassy-jerusalem-and-u-s-consulate-general-jerusalem/|archive-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>

==History==
===Background===
The Embassy opened at its [[Jerusalem]] location on May 14, 2018, the 70th [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] anniversary of [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|the creation of the modern State of Israel]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/israel-palestine-declaration-of-independence-70th-anniversary-benjamin-netanyahu-jerusalem-a8348856.html|title=Editorial: On the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Israel, its people would do well to reflect on the peaceful spirit of the agreement|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|date=May 12, 2018|access-date=May 15, 2018}}</ref> It was relocated from [[Tel Aviv Branch Office of the Embassy of the United States|its previous site in Tel Aviv]] by the [[Trump Administration|Donald Trump Administration]] and is situated in the Arnona section of the [[Consulate General of the United States, Jerusalem|US Consulate]]. The opening prayer was delivered by the Evangelical Reverend [[Robert Jeffress]], and the closing prayer was given by the Evangelical Reverend [[John C. Hagee]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Shatz |first1=Adam |title=The sea is the same sea |magazine=[[London Review of Books]] |date=August 30, 2018 |volume=40 |issue=16 |pages=24–28 |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n16/adam-shatz/the-sea-is-the-same-sea |accessdate=October 21, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Haag |first1=Matthew |title=Robert Jeffress, Pastor Who Said Jews Are Going to Hell, Led Prayer at Jerusalem Embassy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/world/middleeast/robert-jeffress-embassy-jerusalem-us.html |accessdate= October 21, 2018 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Harkov |first1=Lahav |title=Pastor at Jerusalem Embassy event said Jews, Mormons, Muslims going to Hell |url=https://www.jpost.com/American-Politics/Pastor-at-Jerusalem-US-Embassy-event-said-Jews-and-others-going-to-hell-556334 |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=May 14, 2018}}</ref>

The move came 23 years after the passage of the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]] of October 23, 1995, which set a deadline of May 31, 1999, for the move.<ref>Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, {{USPL|104|45}}, November 8, 1995, 109 Stat. 398.</ref> The Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations had all deferred the move. [[Eugene Kontorovich]] claimed that the decision to shift the US embassy to this area is tantamount to the United States recognizing Israeli sovereignty over land that it captured in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967.<ref name="Kershner" />

However, despite the move of the Embassy to Jerusalem, President Trump signed on June 4, 2018 an executive order postponing the move of the Embassy to Jerusalem, although it already moved to that city. He was required to sign the order since the Jerusalem Embassy Act requires the US Ambassador to have a permanent residence in Jerusalem, a condition not yet fulfilled.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Diamond |first1=Jeremy |title=Trump again signs embassy waiver despite move to Jerusalem |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/05/politics/trump-us-embassy-jerusalem/index.html |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=June 5, 2018}}</ref>
