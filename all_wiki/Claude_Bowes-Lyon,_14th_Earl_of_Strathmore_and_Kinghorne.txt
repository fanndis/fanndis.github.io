'''Claude George Bowes-Lyon, 14th and 1st Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KG|KT|GCVO|TD}} (14 March 1855 – 7 November 1944), styled as '''Lord Glamis''' from 1865 to  1904, was a British peer and landowner who was the father of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] and the maternal grandfather of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].

==Life and family==
The Earl was born in [[Lowndes Square]], London, the son of [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 13th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]], and his wife, the former [[Frances Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Frances Smith]].<ref name="cp">White, Geoffrey and [[George Edward Cokayne|Cokayne, G. E.]], ''The Complete Peerage'', St Catherine's Press, London, 1953; vol. XII, pp. 402–3.</ref> His younger brother [[Patrick Bowes-Lyon (tennis player)|Patrick Bowes-Lyon]] was a tennis player who won the 1887 [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] doubles.

After being educated at [[Eton College]], he received a commission in the 2nd [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] in 1876 and served for six years until the year after his marriage.<ref name="times">''The Times'' (London), Wednesday, 8 November 1944, p. 7, col. C.</ref> He was an active member of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] and served as honorary colonel of the 4th/5th Battalion of the [[Black Watch]].<ref name="times" />

Upon succeeding his father to the Earldom on 16 February 1904, he inherited large estates in [[Scotland]] and England, including [[Glamis Castle]], [[St Paul's Walden Bury]], [[Gibside|Gibside Hall]] and [[Streatlam Castle]] in [[County Durham]] and [[Woolmers Park]], near [[Hertford]].<ref name="times" /> He was made [[Lord Lieutenant of Angus]],<ref group="nb">The [[county of Angus]] was called Forfarshire until 1928.</ref> an office he resigned when his daughter became Queen. He had a keen interest in [[forestry]] and was one of the first to grow [[larch]] from seed in Britain. His estates had a large number of smallholders, and he had a reputation for being unusually kind to his tenants.<ref>Grant, F. J., revised by K. D. Reynolds,  "Lyon, Claude George Bowes-, fourteenth earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne in the peerage of Scotland, and first earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne in the peerage of the United Kingdom (1855–1944)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref> His contemporaries described him as an unpretentious man, often seen in "an old macintosh tied with a piece of twine".<ref>Forbes, p. 7.</ref> He worked his own land and enjoyed physical labour on the grounds of his estates; visitors often mistook him for a common labourer.<ref>Forbes, pp. 8–9.</ref> He made his own cocoa for breakfast, and always had a jug of water by his place at dinner so he could dilute his own wine.<ref name=v5/>

Despite the Earl's reservations about royalty,<ref>Forbes, p. 166; Vickers, p. 45.</ref> in 1923 his youngest daughter, Elizabeth, married [[Prince Albert, Duke of York]], the second son of [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. Lord Strathmore was made a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Royal Victorian Order]] to mark the marriage. Five years later he was made a [[knight of the Thistle]].<ref name="bp">Mosley, Charles, (ed.) ''Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition'', Burke's Peerage and Gentry LLC, 2003; vol. III, pp. 3783–4.</ref>

In 1936, his son-in-law became king and assumed the name George VI. As the father of the new queen, he was created a [[knight of the Garter]] and Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]] in the Coronation Honours of 1937. This enabled him to sit in the [[House of Lords]] as an earl (because members of the [[peerage of Scotland]] did not automatically sit in the House of Lords, he had previously sat only as a [[baron]] through the [[Barony of Bowes]] created for his father).<ref name="bp" /> At the [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth|coronation of his daughter and son-in-law]], the Earl and Countess sat in the royal box with Queen Mary and their shared granddaughters, Princesses [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret|Margaret]].

Later in life he became extremely deaf.<ref name=v5>Vickers, p. 5.</ref> Lord Strathmore died of [[bronchitis]] on 7 November 1944, aged 89, at [[Glamis Castle]].<ref>Vickers, p. 247.</ref> (Lady Strathmore had died in 1938.<ref name="times" />) He was succeeded by his son [[Patrick Bowes-Lyon, 15th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Patrick Bowes-Lyon, Lord Glamis]].

==Marriage and issue==
He married [[Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck]] on 16 July 1881 in [[Petersham, London|Petersham]], Surrey.<ref name="cp" /> The couple had ten children. The Earl would part his moustache in a theatrical but courteous gesture before kissing them:<ref>Vickers, p. 4.</ref>
