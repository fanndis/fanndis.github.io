== Malware infection in downloads ==
With a catalog of more than 400,000 titles, the Downloads section of the website allows users to download popular software.

CNET claims that this software is free of [[spyware]], but independent sources have confirmed that this is not the case. While [[Download.com]] is overall a safe place to download programs, precautions should be taken before downloading from the site, as some downloads do contain malware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=5bd70802c051fd95d0d78ac168385cd504705c00526ded2fd5edebdcc32d48f6-1323123804|title=Antivirus scan for 5bd70802c051fd95d0d78ac168385cd504705c00526ded2fd5edebdcc32d48f6 at 2011-12-05 22:23:24 UTC - VirusTotal|access-date=November 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107200634/http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=5bd70802c051fd95d0d78ac168385cd504705c00526ded2fd5edebdcc32d48f6-1323123804|archive-date=January 7, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://seclists.org/nmap-announce/2011/5|title=Nmap Announce: C-Net Download.Com is now bundling Nmap with malware!}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/93504-download-com-wraps-downloads-in-bloatware-lies-about-motivations|title=Download.com wraps downloads in bloatware, lies about motivations - ExtremeTech}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://botcrawl.com/cnet-downloads-a-cesspool-for-privacy-invading-malware/|title=Warning: Download.com (CNET Downloads) A cesspool for privacy invading malware and rogue software - Botcrawl|date=December 9, 2012|accessdate=March 5, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/198622/heres-what-happens-when-you-install-the-top-10-download.com-apps/|title=Here's What Happens When You Install the Top 10 Download.com Apps}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insecure.org/news/download-com-fiasco.html|title=Download.com Caught Adding Malware to Nmap & Other Software}}</ref>

==Hopper controversy==
In January 2013, CNET named [[Dish Network]]'s "Hopper with [[Slingbox|Sling]]" [[digital video recorder]] as a nominee for the [[International CES|CES]] "Best in Show" award (which is decided by CNET on behalf of its organizers), and named it the winner in a vote by the site's staff. However, CBS abruptly disqualified the Hopper, and vetoed the results because the company was in [[Auto Hop|active litigation]] with Dish Network. CNET also announced that it could no longer review any product or service provided by companies that CBS are in litigation with (which also includes [[Aereo]]). The new vote subsequently gave the Best in Show award to the [[Razer USA|Razer Edge]] tablet instead.<ref name="wsj-hopper">{{cite news|title=Dish Recorder Snubbed for CNET Award Over CBS Legal Scuffle|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/01/10/dish-recorder-snubbed-for-cnet-award-over-cbs-legal-scuffle/|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}</ref><ref name=pcmag-cnethopper/><ref name=verge-cescbs/>

Dish Network's CEO Joe Clayton said that the company was "saddened that CNET's staff is being denied its editorial independence because of CBS' heavy-handed tactics."<ref name="wsj-hopper"/> On January 14, 2013, editor-in-chief Lindsey Turrentine addressed the situation, stating that CNET's staff were in an "impossible" situation due to the [[conflict of interest]] posed by the situation, and promised that she would do everything within her power to prevent a similar incident from occurring again. The conflict also prompted one CNET senior writer, Greg Sandoval, to resign.<ref name=pcmag-cnethopper>{{cite magazine|last=Albanesius|first=Chloe|title=CNET Picked Dish Hopper as 'Best of CES' ... Until CBS Stepped In|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2414276,00.asp |magazine=PC Magazine|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}</ref>

The decision also drew the ire of staff from the [[Consumer Electronics Association]], the organizers of CES; CEO [[Gary Shapiro]] criticized the decision in a ''[[USA Today]]'' [[op-ed]] column and a statement by the CEA, stating that "making television easier to watch is not against the law. It is simply pro-innovation and pro-consumer." Shapiro felt that the decision also hurt the confidence of CNET's readers and staff, "destroying its reputation for editorial integrity in an attempt to eliminate a new market competitor." As a result of the controversy and fearing damage to the show's brand, the CEA announced on January 31, 2013 that CNET will no longer decide the CES Best in Show award winner due to the interference of CBS (the position has been offered to other technology publications), and the "Best in Show" award was jointly awarded to both the Hopper with Sling and Razer Edge.<ref name=verge-cescbs>{{cite web|title=CNET loses CES awards following Dish Hopper controversy; DVR named 'Best In Show'|url= https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/31/3937476/cnet-loses-ces-awards-following-dish-hopper-controversy-dvr-named|website=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=January 31, 2013}}</ref>
