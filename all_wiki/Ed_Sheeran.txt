===2004–2010: Career beginnings===
[[File:12 - Ed Sheeran.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Sheeran performing at the Ipswich Arts Festival in July 2010]]

Sheeran began recording music in 2004 and independently released his first collection of work ''Spinning Man''.{{efn|group=upper-alpha|"In 2004, I made my very first album, ''Spinning Man'', named after a picture that my dad had. I burnt the CDs myself and made the covers. There were 14 songs and they were all songs that rhymed. One lyric went: ''‘I’m a typical average teen, if you know what I mean.’'' There are probably 20 copies of Spinning Man in existence and I have 19 of them. I don’t want anyone else to get hold of a copy. Most of the songs were about a girl named Claire. She was my first love when I was 13. It was a very innocent love and we only ever held hands, but it lasted a fair amount of time. Then came my first devastating break-up. Looking back, it really wasn’t that bad, but at the time it was soul-shattering. When she left me, I wrote a lot of songs off the back of it – my first love songs."<ref>''Ed Sheeran: A Visual Journey'', pg 38</ref>}} He has been friends with fellow English singer, [[Passenger (singer)|Passenger]], since he was 15, with the two playing the same gig in Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2012/12/07/passenger_aka_mike_rosenberg_grateful_for_ed_sheerans_support.html|title=Passenger, a.k.a.

==Politics==
Sheeran publicly opposed [[Brexit]] (UK leaving the [[European Union]]), and supported the "remain" option. Following the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|June 2016 referendum result]] where the British public marginally voted to leave, Sheeran was among a group of British musicians (which included [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], [[Pink Floyd]] drummer [[Nick Mason]] and [[Damon Albarn]] of [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Gorillaz]]) who signed a letter to the Prime Minister [[Theresa May]], drafted by [[Bob Geldof]] in October 2018, calling for “[[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|a 2nd vote]]”. Stating that Brexit will “impact every aspect of the music industry. From touring to sales, to copyright legislation to royalty collation”, the letter adds: “We dominate the market and our bands, singers, musicians, writers, producers and engineers work all over Europe and the world and in turn, Europe and the world come to us. Why? Because we are brilliant at it ... [Our music] reaches out, all inclusive, and embraces anyone and everyone. And that truly is what Britain is.”<ref>{{cite news |title=UK music stars rail against Brexit in open letter to Theresa May |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/06/uk-musician-warn-botched-brexit |accessdate=30 May 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>
