The name Mattel is a [[portmanteau]] of Harold "Matt" Matson and [[Elliot Handler]], two of the company's founders.

==History==
[[File:Mattel-brand.svg|150px|thumb|left|Mattel logo (1969–2019)]]
Harold "Matt" Matson and Elliot Handler founded Mattel in 1945. The company sold picture frames, and later dollhouse furniture. Matson sold{{when|date=November 2017}} his share to Handler due to poor health, and Handler's wife [[Ruth Handler|Ruth]] took Matson's role. In 1947, the company had its first hit toy, a [[ukulele]] called "Uke-A-Doodle".

The company incorporated the next year in California. Mattel became the first year-round sponsor of the ''[[Mickey Mouse Club]]'' TV series in 1955. The [[Barbie]] doll debuted in 1959, becoming the company's best-selling toy in history. In 1960, Mattel introduced [[Chatty Cathy]], a talking doll revolutionizing the toy industry, which led to pull-string talking dolls and toys flooding the market throughout the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=idc>{{cite web|title=Mattel, Inc.

The company went public in 1960, and the [[New York Stock Exchange]] listed them in 1963. Mattel also acquired a number of companies during the 1960s (see table).<ref name=idc/> In 1965, the company built on its success with the Chatty Cathy doll to introduce the [[See 'n Say]] talking toy, spawning a line of products.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=Allie|title=All-TIME 100 Greatest Toys: See 'N Say|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2049243_2048656_2049201,00.html|access-date=June 6, 2016|work=Time|date=February 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623174214/http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2049243_2048656_2049201,00.html|archive-date=June 23, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> They released [[Hot Wheels]] to the market on May 18, 1968.<ref name=idc/> In May 1970, Mattel formed a joint venture film production company Radnitz/Mattel Productions with producer [[Robert B.

Mattel added a princess-themed Barbie line in 2010, and the fair and fantasy store-based [[Ever After High]] line in 2013. Barbie sales began plummeting in 2012, thus removing focus from the Disney Princess line. Mattel had only sold Cinderella, Ariel, Belle, and the two Frozen princesses during the last year or so of its license. With these competing lines and an expiration of the brand license at the end of 2015, Disney gave [[Hasbro]] a chance to gain the license given their work on Star Wars, which led to a ''[[Descendants (2015 film)|Descendants]]'' license. Disney Consumer Products also made an attempt to evolve the brand from "damsels" to "heroines." In September 2014, Disney announced Hasbro would be the licensed doll maker for the Disney Princess line starting on January 1, 2016.<ref name=bbw/>
