The '''Police Federation of England and Wales''' (PFEW) is the statutory staff association for police [[Constable#United Kingdom|Constables]], [[Sergeant#Police 7|Sergeants]], [[Inspector#United Kingdom|Inspectors]] and [[Chief inspector#United Kingdom|Chief Inspectors]] in the [[List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom#Territorial police forces|43 territorial police forces]] in [[England and Wales]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Leadership and standards in the police: follow-up tenth report of session 2013-14: Vol. 1|author=Great Britain Parliament House of Commons Home Affairs Committee|id=House of Commons papers 756-I 2013-14|publisher=[[The Stationery Office]]|location=London|date=3 November 2013|page=10}}</ref> Under [[UK labour law]], the police are prohibited from joining ordinary [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade unions]] to defend pay and working conditions, by the [[Police Act 1996]], because of the view that a police strike would pose an exceptional public safety risk.

==History==
{{Law enforcement in the United Kingdom}}{{Essay-like|date=June 2020}}
The Police Federation of England and Wales was set up by the [[Police Act 1919]] after two [[British police strikes in 1918 and 1919]]. The government of the day were frightened by the prospect of the police going on strike and created the Police Federation of England and Wales and withdrew the right of officers in the UK to strike.<ref name=metfed>{{cite web|url=http://www.metfed.org.uk/about |title=About the Metropolitan Police Federation |publisher=Metropolitan Police Federation |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513130343/http://www.metfed.org.uk/about |archivedate=13 May 2012 }}</ref>

Police officers [[Official|hold office]] and are not employees.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Who is Protected by Employment Law|work=Your Rights|publisher=[[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]]|url=http://www.yourrights.org.uk/yourrights/rights-of-workers/who-is-protected-by-employment-law.html|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> Each officer is an independent legal official and not an "agent of the police force, police authority or government".<ref>{{Cite news|title=What is the Office of Constable?|page=7|work=The Office of Constable: The bedrock of modern day British policing|publisher=Police Federation of England and Wales| location=Leatherhead| url=https://www.metfed.org.uk/support/uploads/1214552596Office%20Constable.pdf|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> This allows the police their unique status and notionally provides the citizens of the UK a protection from any government that might wish unlawfully to use the police as an instrument against them.  Many observers mistakenly equate the Police Federation with a [[trade union]]. This is technically an incorrect assumption, as it was set up specifically by the government of the day not to be a trade union; however in reality the Federation does function in a similar manner. It negotiates with the Official Side{{clarify|date=May 2020}} on all matters concerning its membership's pay, allowances, hour of duty, annual leave, pensions and other conditions of service. However, unlike a union, the Federation is controlled entirely by serving police officers, has no political affiliations, and has no powers to call a strike.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kentpolfed.org.uk/about/about.htm |title=About Us, What We Stand For |publisher=Kent Police Federation}}</ref> That is not to say that the Federation remains aloof from applying political pressure, as the successful 1976 ballot regarding the right to strike<ref name=metfed /> and the 2012/13 "[[Plebgate]]" affair.

==Organisation==
Each of the 43 police forces in England and Wales has its own federation branch board and council. The 43 forces are grouped into eight regions. Due to its size, the Metropolitan Police federation branch board is structured differently.

At the end of December 2012, the PFEW announced it would be independently reviewed.  The review was conducted by Sir David Normington and the Police Federation accepted all 36 recommendations of the review in May 2014 and is currently working through making these organisational changes. 

As such, an Interim National Board (INB) was set up (formerly the Joint Central Committee) which had responsibility for national pay negotiations on behalf of its members. This has now been superseded by the National Board. It also performs many other functions, such as training, administering legal representation and liaising with government and other national bodies on policy and legislative matters. The present National Board Chair is John Apter.

The PFEW's HQ is at [[Leatherhead]], [[Surrey]], in a complex which also incorporates the federation's national training centre and a hotel facility for federation members.

==Past turbulence==

Chair and general secretary of Police Federation of England and Wales both retired after "turbulent period" on 7 April 2014. Steve Williams and Ian Rennie announced their plans to retire from the police service at the end of May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polfed.org/newsroom/1963.aspx|title=Chair and General Secretary of the Police Federation to retire at the end of the Federation Annual Conference in May|website=www.polfed.org}}</ref>  Steve White was elected as Chair and Andy Fittes elected as General Secretary at the Police Federation's Annual Conference in May 2014. 

At the same conference (on 21 May 2014), the Home Secretary Theresa May announced that public funding of the Police Federation would end in August 2014.

==In popular culture==
In the police drama ''[[Line of Duty]]'', officers under investigation are often shown accompanied by a "Fed rep" during interviews.
