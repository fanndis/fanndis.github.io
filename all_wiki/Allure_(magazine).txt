'''''Allure''''' is an American women's magazine focused on beauty, published monthly by [[Condé Nast]] in [[New York City]]. It was founded in 1991 by [[Linda Wells]]. [[Michelle Lee (editor)|Michelle Lee]] replaced Wells in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Steigrad| first = Alexandra| title = Linda Wells' 24-Year Run at Allure Comes to an End| work = WWD| accessdate = 2016-01-30| date = 2015-11-12| url = http://wwd.com/media-news/fashion-memopad/linda-wells-allure-michelle-lee-depart-nylon-editor-in-chief-10277608/}}</ref> A signature of the magazine is its annual Best of Beauty awards—accolades given in the October issue to beauty products deemed the best by Allure's staff.

==History==
In 1990, [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr.|S.I. Newhouse Jr.]], chairman of Condé Nast, and then editorial director [[Alexander Liberman]] approached [[Linda Wells]] to develop a concept they had for a beauty magazine. At the time, Wells was the beauty editor and the food editor at ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''.<ref name="WWD">Smith, Stephanie D., "''Allure'' Survives Early Blemishes and Turns 15", ''Women's Wear Daily'', October 20, 2006.</ref>

The magazine's prototype was shredded shortly before the scheduled launch date and, after overhauling everything (including the logo), ''Allure'' made its debut in March 1991<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 100 U.S. Magazines by Circulation|url=http://www.psaresearch.com/images/TOPMAGAZINES.pdf|work=PSA Research Center|accessdate=February 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115225953/http://www.psaresearch.com/images/TOPMAGAZINES.pdf|archive-date=November 15, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Greg Allard|title=The Top 20 Selling Fashion Magazines|url=http://tunegroover.com/the-top-20-selling-fashion-magazines/|accessdate=September 18, 2016|work=Tune Groover|date=October 3, 2015}}</ref>  designed by Lucy Sisman. The magazine's original format was oversize, but this prevented it from fitting into slots at grocery-store checkouts and required advertisers to resize their ads or create new ones. After four issues, ''Allure'' changed to a standard-size glossy format.<ref name="WWD" />

==Impact==
''Allure'' focuses on beauty, fashion, and women's health. ''Allure'' was the first women's magazine to write about the health risks associated with [[silicone]] [[breast implants]], and has reported on other controversial health issues.

After Lee took the helm in late 2015, the brand was celebrated for promoting diversity and inclusivity. In 2017, ''Adweek'' named Allure Magazine of the Year and awarded Lee as Editor of the Year.<ref>[https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/17-magazines-shaking-up-the-publishing-industry-one-reinvention-at-a-time/ "14 Magazines Shaking Up the Publishing Industry, One Reinvention at a Time"], ''[[Adweek]]''.

Retrieved 2 June 2018.</ref>

The magazine's circulation, initially 250,000 in 1991, is over 1 million as of 2011.

Many  writers have contributed to ''Allure''. Among them are [[Arthur Miller]], [[John Updike]], [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], [[Michael Chabon]], [[Kathryn Harrison]], [[Frank McCourt]], [[Isabel Allende]], and [[Francine du Plessix Gray]]. [[Elizabeth Gilbert]]’s essay “The Road to Rapture,” published in ''Allure'' in 2003, was the precursor to her memoir, ''[[Eat, Pray, Love]]'' (Viking Adult). Photographers who have shot for ''Allure'' include [[Michael Thompson (photographer)|Michael Thompson]], [[Mario Testino]], [[Patrick Demarchelier]], [[Tina Barney]], [[Marilyn Minter]], Carter Smith, [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]], [[Steven Meisel]], and [[Helmut Newton]]. Cover subjects have included [[Demi Lovato]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Helen Mirren]], [[Zendaya]], [[Julia Roberts]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen]], [[Victoria Beckham]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Kate Hudson]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Rihanna]], and [[Gwen Stefani]].

==Best of Beauty Awards==
''Allure'' began its Best of Beauty awards program in the mid-1990s, at the initiative of Wells, to help readers choose among the vast array of makeup, skin-care, and hair-care products on the market.

''Allure'' has two sets of awards, one judged by the magazine's editors and the other by readers. A “winners’ seal” logo, developed by ''Allure'', appears on many of the winning products. To ensure that its judgments are neutral, ''Allure'''s ad department isn't involved in the selections.

In 2010, the magazine developed an [[iPhone app]] that highlights the winning products and tells users where they can buy them based on their location.<ref>[http://www.allure.com/beauty/iphone-apps iPhone Apps] Allure</ref>

==Controversy==
There was an outrage when the magazine showed Marissa Neitling with an [[Afro]] haircut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/682999/twitter-takes-down-allure-for-telling-white-women-you-yes-you-can-have-an-afro-even-if-you-have-straight-hair|title=Allure Uses White Model for Afro Tutorial, Backlash Ensues|date=August 4, 2015|website=E!
