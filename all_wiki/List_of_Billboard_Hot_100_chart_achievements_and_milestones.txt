This is a comprehensive listing that highlights '''significant achievements and milestones''' based upon [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]]'s singles charts, most notably the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. This list spans the period from the issue dated January 1, 1955 to present. The ''Billboard'' Hot 100 began with the issue dated August 4, 1958, and is currently the standard popular music chart in the [[United States]].

Prior to the creation of the Hot 100, ''Billboard'' published four singles charts: "Best Sellers in Stores", "Most Played by Jockeys", "Most Played in Jukeboxes" and "The Top 100". These charts, which ranged from 20 to 100 slots, were phased out at different times between 1957 and 1958. Though technically not part of the Hot 100 chart history, select data from these charts are included for computational purposes, and to avoid unenlightening or misleading characterizations.

All items listed below are from the Hot 100 era, unless otherwise noted (pre-Hot 100 charts).

==All-time achievements==
In 2008, for the 50th anniversary of the Hot 100, ''Billboard'' magazine compiled a ranking of the 100 best-performing songs on the chart over the 50 years, along with the best-performing artists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044122/hot-100-anniversary-find-out-the-top-songs-of-all-time|title=Hot 100 Anniversary: Find Out The Top Songs Of All Time|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|date=October 10, 2008|access-date=January 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315002736/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044122/hot-100-anniversary-find-out-the-top-songs-of-all-time|archive-date=March 15, 2015|url-status=live}} This contains the heading of the article only, no charts.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Silent_Mike/billboard_hot_100_chart__50th_anniversary/|title=Billboard Hot 100 Chart: 50th Anniversary|access-date=January 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112214920/http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Silent_Mike/billboard_hot_100_chart__50th_anniversary/|archive-date=January 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2013, ''Billboard'' revised the rankings for the chart's 55th anniversary edition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/5557802/hot-100-55th-anniversary-central|title=Hot 100 55th Anniversary Central|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|date=August 2, 2013|access-date=January 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122171013/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/5557802/hot-100-55th-anniversary-central|archive-date=January 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2015, ''Billboard'' revised the rankings again.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/greatest-of-all-time/6760687/chubby-checker-the-beatles-greatest-artists-hot-100|title=Greatest Hot 100 Songs & Artists of All Time: Chubby Checker's 'The Twist' & The Beatles Reign|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|date=November 12, 2015|access-date=October 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805064308/http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/greatest-of-all-time/6760687/chubby-checker-the-beatles-greatest-artists-hot-100|archive-date=August 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2018, the rankings were revised again for the ''Billboard'' chart's 60th anniversary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/hot-100-turns-60/8468142/hot-100-all-time-biggest-hits-songs-list|title=The Biggest Hits of All: The Hot 100's All-Time Top 100 Songs|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|date=August 2, 2018|access-date=August 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515110750/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/hot-100-turns-60/8468142/hot-100-all-time-biggest-hits-songs-list|archive-date=May 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Shown below are the top 10 songs and top 10 artists over the 60-year period of the Hot 100, through July 2018.

†† – "Purple Rain" and "When Doves Cry" reappeared on the Hot 100 for two weeks in 2016, and the above reflects their re-entries only. When the songs originally charted in 1984, their chart positions in their final week on the Hot 100 were well below the top 10.

:Prior to 2008, the biggest drop off the Hot 100 was "[[Nights in White Satin]]" by [[The Moody Blues]], which ranked at #17 in its final week on the chart in December 1972. This high drop-off position was matched in January 1975 by "[[Junior's Farm]]" by [[Wings (band)|Paul McCartney and Wings]]. The record descent held for over three decades.  Each song above dropped off the Hot 100 upon four or fewer weeks; "Nights in White Satin" and "Junior's Farm" dropped off after 18 and 12 weeks, respectively.

====Seasonal songs====
During the holiday season, which includes Christmas, these songs regularly appear on the Hot 100, generally departing from the chart after the holiday season ends. In recent years, seasonal songs have reached into the top ten, and in 2019, for only the second time ever on the Hot 100 (the first since 1958), made it to number one. This has led to all-time records for dropping off the Hot 100, including from number one, as the songs depart the chart regardless of their final chart positions during the season.

† The biggest number-one listed by each artist reflects its overall performance on the Hot 100, as calculated by ''Billboard'', and may not necessarily be the single which spent the most weeks at #1 for the artist, such as Madonna's "Like a Virgin" (six weeks at #1, compared to seven for "[[Take a Bow (Madonna song)|Take a Bow]]"), Mariah Carey's "We Belong Together" (fourteen weeks at #1, compared to sixteen for her duet with Boyz II Men, "One Sweet Day") and Michael Jackson's duet with Paul McCartney, "Say Say Say" (six weeks at #1, compared to seven for both his solo singles "Billie Jean" and "[[Black or White]]").

‡ Pre-Hot 100 charts and Hot 100.
* ''Billboard'' now credits the dual #1 Presley single "Don't Be Cruel"/"Hound Dog" as a single chart entity, and credits Presley with 17 number one singles.<ref name="presley">{{cite web|last1=Bronson|first1=Fred|title=Chart Beat: Fred discusses chart action on Mariah Carey/Madonna/Elvis Presley, James Brown, Fantasia and more!|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045979/chart-beat|website=Billboard|access-date=14 March 2018|date=3 April 2008|quote=Elvis collected his 17th No. 1 in November 1969 when "Suspicious Minds" became the final Hot 100 chart-topper of his career.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180521093932/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045979/chart-beat|archive-date=May 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> "Don't Be Cruel"/"Hound Dog" spent 11 weeks at #1, "Hound Dog" for 6 weeks, "Don't Be Cruel" for 5 weeks. Many chart statisticians however, such as [[Joel Whitburn]], still list Presley as having 18 number ones.

<!-- Note to any future editors: We rely on Billboard's computational criteria here. Because of this, there is no need to footnote the previous or subsequent number ones by each of the solo Beatles, Diana Ross, or the Jackson Five.

:† Pre-Hot 100 charts and Hot 100. Presley is sometimes credited with an "80th week" that occurred when "All Shook Up" spent a ninth week on top of the "Most Played in Jukeboxes" chart. Although ''Billboard''{{'}}s chart statistician Joel Whitburn still counts this 80th week based on preexisting research, ''Billboard'' magazine itself has since revised its methodology and officially credits Presley with 79 weeks.<ref name="presley"/> Much of Presley's total factors in pre-Hot 100 data. If counting from the August 1958 Hot 100 inception, Presley totaled 22 weeks at #1.

:* Houston's "[[Thinking About You (Whitney Houston song)|Thinking About You]]" is not counted as interrupting  the streak, as it never appeared on the Hot 100, due to not being released to Pop radio. Likewise, Perry's "[[Not Like the Movies]]" and "[[Circle the Drain]]" were only promotional singles, not radio singles.
:* With the streak spanning from her debut single "Vision of Love" until "Emotions," Mariah Carey became the first artist in Hot 100 history to have their first 5 solo singles reach #1 on the chart.

===Most top ten singles from one album===
<!-- IMPORTANT:  Regarding the albums "Confessions" by Usher, and "Fearless" by Taylor Swift, each of which appears in the Billboard source cited at the end of this section, please do not include those albums in the listing at this time. Each generated five top ten Hot 100 singles, but one of those songs from each was not included on the ORIGINAL releases of the albums, and if we go by only songs on the original release, they would each have four and thus not qualify for this list. Katy Perry's "Teenage Dream" is credited with just six top tens, instead of eight, which would be the tally if material from the re-issue as "The Complete Confection" were to count, and Billboard considers the re-release of that album as separate from the original. This matter is being brought up on the talk page for further discussion. -->
