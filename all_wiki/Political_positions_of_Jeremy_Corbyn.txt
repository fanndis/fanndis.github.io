In June 2018, during his first international trip outside Europe since he was elected Labour leader, Corbyn said: "I think there has to be a recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people to their own state which we as a Labour Party said we would recognise in government as a full state as part of the United Nations."<ref name="independent">{{cite news |last=Baynes|first=Chris|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/palestine-state-recognition-jeremy-corbyn-labour-government-israel-soon-a8413796.html|title=UK would 'recognise Palestine as state' under Labour government, Jeremy Corbyn says|location= |work=The Independent|date=24 June 2018|accessdate=24 June 2018}}</ref>

He said that he does not condone the actions of either organisation: <blockquote>"Does it mean I agree with Hamas and what it does? No. Does it mean I agree with Hezbollah and what they do? No. What it means is that I think to bring about a peace process, you have to talk to people with whom you may profoundly disagree ...

In 2014, Corbyn spoke at the [[Islamic Centre of England]] at an event celebrating the 35th anniversary of the [[Iranian Revolution]].

Corbyn has criticised Britain's close ties with [[Saudi Arabia]] and British involvement in the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]]. In January 2016, after a United Nations panel ruled Saudi-led bombing campaign of Yemen contravened international humanitarian law, Corbyn called for an independent inquiry into the UK's arms exports policy to Saudi Arabia.

In November 2014, Corbyn questioned subjective "legal obstacles" put in place for UK fighters returning from the Syrian Civil War, including those who had fought for [[ISIS]] and the Syrian Government as well as the Free Syrian Army, arguing that "There are an awful lot of contradictions surrounding how we decide who is a good fighter and who is a terrorist; who is struggling for liberation and who is a terrorist". Corbyn said "I have no support for ISIS whatsoever, and obviously that should apply to someone who has committed crimes, but we should bear in mind that expressing a political point of view is not in itself an offence". He called on the Government to think about this rather more carefully and avoid the knee-jerk reaction of saying, "These are bad fighters and those are good fighters, so we will ban these and allow those in".<ref>{{cite news|title=Jeremy Corbyn said Isil supporters should not be prosecuted for 'expressing a political point of view'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/05/jeremy-corbyn-said-isil-supporters-should-not-prosecuted-expressing/|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=5 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824123202/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/05/jeremy-corbyn-said-isil-supporters-should-not-prosecuted-expressing/|archivedate=24 August 2017}}</ref>

In April 2017, the United States' airstrikes on a Syrian air base, in response to the use of chemical weapons by Assad, were opposed by Corbyn, saying it risked "escalating the war in Syria still further" and "unilateral military action without legal authorisation or independent verification risks intensifying a multi-sided conflict that has already killed hundreds of thousands of people". He instead suggested the international community should "reconvene the [[Geneva Convention|Geneva]] peace talks and unrelenting international pressure for a negotiated settlement of the conflict".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-us-missile-strikes-syria-airbase-escalate-civil-war-labour-leader-russia-bashar-al-a7671941.html|title=Jeremy Corbyn: US missile strikes on Syrian airbase risk escalating the civil war still further|work=The Independent|date=7 April 2017|access-date=9 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810104819/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-us-missile-strikes-syria-airbase-escalate-civil-war-labour-leader-russia-bashar-al-a7671941.html|archivedate=10 August 2017}}</ref> He later added: "it's nobody's interests for this war to continue.

{{Further|Reactions to the death of Osama bin Laden}}
In an interview with ''[[Press TV]]'', he stated about Osama bin Laden's death that there was "no attempt whatsoever that I can see to arrest him and put him on trial, to go through that process" and that "this was an assassination attempt, and is yet another tragedy, upon a tragedy, upon a tragedy". Corbyn said his view about the desirability of putting bin Laden on trial was shared by [[Boris Johnson]] and [[Barack Obama]].<ref name="Demianyk 2017">{{cite web | last=Demianyk | first=Graeme | title=5 Times Jeremy Corbyn Sailed Through Jeremy Paxman's 'Over The Top' Interview | website=The Huffington Post |location=United Kingdom | date=29 May 2017 | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jeremy-corbyn-brushed-off-jeremy-paxman-interview-sky-channel-4_uk_592c8102e4b0df57cbfcb939 | access-date=30 May 2017 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530002004/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jeremy-corbyn-brushed-off-jeremy-paxman-interview-sky-channel-4_uk_592c8102e4b0df57cbfcb939 | archivedate=30 May 2017 }}</ref><ref name="Bush 2017">{{cite web | last=Bush | first=Stephen | title=What did Jeremy Corbyn really say about Bin Laden? | website=New Statesman | date=31 August 2015 | url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2015/08/what-did-jeremy-corbyn-really-say-about-bin-laden | access-date=30 May 2017 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508075105/http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2015/08/what-did-jeremy-corbyn-really-say-about-bin-laden | archivedate=8 May 2017 }}</ref><ref name="the Guardian 2015">{{cite news | title=Jeremy Corbyn said Osama bin Laden should have been tried, not killed | work=The Guardian | date=31 August 2015 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/31/jeremy-corbyn-said-osama-bin-laden-should-have-been-tried-not-killed | access-date=30 May 2017 | via=Press Association | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530184540/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/31/jeremy-corbyn-said-osama-bin-laden-should-have-been-tried-not-killed | archivedate=30 May 2017 }}</ref>

==== Kurdistan and Kurds ====
[[Firat News Agency]] reported in 2016 that, in a meeting organised by British Kurdish People's Assembly, Corbyn said that "if peace is wanted in the region, the Kurdish people's right to self-determination must be accepted." Commenting on the status of [[Abdullah Öcalan]], it was reported he remarked "if there will be a peace process and solution, Öcalan must be free and at the table."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://anfenglish.com/news/british-main-opposition-leader-ocalan-must-be-free-for-peace-16426|title=British main opposition leader: Öcalan must be free for peace|last=|first=|date=16 September 2016|work=Firat News Agency|access-date=24 August 2018}}</ref>

At [[Chatham House]] in 2017 he was asked if he would "condemn the genocide which is going on against the Kurds in Syria and in Turkey", Corbyn responded with "I would be very strong with the Turkish government on its treatment of Kurdish people and minorities and the way in which it's denied them their decency and human rights". On warfare by Turkey against the Kurds, Corbyn stated, "If arms are being used to oppress people internally in violation of international law then they simply should not be supplied to them".<ref>{{Citation|title=Jeremy Corbyn on Labour's Defence and Foreign Policy Priorities|date=12 May 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGzPo8Wx1n0&t=3076|publisher=Chatham House|access-date=24 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/world/14052017|title=UK Labour leader: All Mideast settlements must ensure Kurdish rights|last=|first=|date=14 May 2017|work=Rudaw Media Network|access-date=24 August 2018}}</ref>

===Russia===
Following the poisoning in Salisbury in March 2018 of [[Sergei Skripal]] by a Novichok nerve agent, the UK Government expelled a number of Russian diplomats. However, Corbyn indicated that he would still be prepared to engage with [[Vladimir Putin]], and suggested that further actions against Russia should be avoided until evidence against direct [[Kremlin]] involvement in the attack could be verified. He acknowledged, however, that the material was manufactured by the Russian state but told the [[BBC]]: "Would I do business with Putin? Sure.

===NATO and Ukraine===
{{Further|Ukraine–United Kingdom relations}}
Corbyn has been a long-time critic of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO). In May 2012 he authored a piece in the ''Morning Star'' titled "High time for an end to NATO" where he described the organisation as an " instrument of cold war manipulation". He further expanded both in the same piece, saying, "The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, with the ending of the Warsaw Pact mutual defence strategy, was the obvious time for Nato to have been disbanded.",<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=High time for an End to Nato|last=Corbyn|first=Jeremy|date=23 May 2012|work=Morning Star|access-date=}}</ref> and elsewhere in a 2014 speech where he called the organisation an "engine for the delivery of oil to the oil companies" and called for it to "give up, go home and go away."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/19/jeremy-corbyn-called-for-nato-to-be-closed-down-and-members-to-g/|title=Jeremy Corbyn called for Nato to be closed down and members to 'give up, go home and go away'|last1=Hughes|first1=Laura|date=2016-08-19|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-08-05|last2=Swinford|first2=Steven|issn=0307-1235|last3=Farmer|first3=Ben}}</ref>

For these comments and a refusal to answer whether he would defend a NATO ally in the case of attack he was criticised by [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], the former Prime Minister of Denmark and [[Secretary General of NATO|Nato Secretary General]], who said Corbyn's opinions were "tempting President [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] to aggression" and made comparisons between his views and those of the American president [[Donald Trump]]. He was also criticised by [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen|George Robertson]], former Labour party defence secretary, who said "It beggars belief that the leader of the party most responsible for the collective security pact of Nato should be so reckless as to undermine it by refusing to say he would come to the aid of an ally.".<ref name=":0" />

In April 2014, Corbyn wrote another article for the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]'' in which he attributed the [[crisis in Ukraine]] to the actions of NATO. He said the "root of the crisis" lay in "the US drive to expand eastwards" and described Russia's actions as "not unprovoked".<ref name="MS140417">{{cite web|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-972b-Nato-belligerence-endangers-us-all|title=Nato belligerence endangers us all|first=Jeremy|last=Corbyn|work=Morning Star Online|date=17 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923060138/http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-972b-Nato-belligerence-endangers-us-all|archivedate=23 September 2015}}</ref> He has said it "probably was" a mistake to allow former [[Warsaw Pact]] countries to join NATO: "NATO expansion and Russian expansion&nbsp;– one leads to the other, and one reflects the other".<ref name="MS140417" /><ref name="Gn150807">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/07/jeremy-corbyn-interview-we-are-not-doing-celebrity-personality-or-abusive-politics|title=Jeremy Corbyn: 'We are not doing celebrity, personality or abusive politics&nbsp;– this is about hope'|first=Nicholas|last=Watt|work=The Guardian|date=7 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407085709/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/07/jeremy-corbyn-interview-we-are-not-doing-celebrity-personality-or-abusive-politics|archivedate=7 April 2017}}</ref>

Corbyn said in an international meeting that, "Essentially what we’re looking at is a group of people who did not enjoy their rights during a period of decolonisation, did not enjoy the rights bestowed to them by the UN charter and by the statutes on decolonisation", adding "It’s about a political strategy that brings to worldwide recognition the plight of the people of West Papua, forces it onto a political agenda, forces it to the UN, forces an exposure of it and ultimately that allows the people of West Papua to make the choice of the kind of government they want and the kind of society in which they want to live. That is a fundamental right."<ref name="sbs.com.au"/><ref name="theguardian.com"/>

Corbyn has said he would want with the [[US]] a "strong and friendly relationship", while "not be[ing] afraid to speak our mind".

In June 2016, in the run-up to the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|EU referendum]], Corbyn said that there was an "overwhelming case" for staying in the EU. In a speech in London, Corbyn said "We, the Labour Party, are overwhelmingly for staying in, because we believe the European Union has brought investment, jobs and protection for workers, consumers and the environment". Corbyn also criticised media coverage and warnings from both sides, saying that the debate had been dominated too much by "myth-making and prophecies of doom".<ref name="autogenerated1"/> In the same speech,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://labourlist.org/2016/06/fighting-ttip-defending-workers-rights-and-protecting-refugees-corbyns-eu-speech |title=Jeremy Corbyn speech "The EU referendum is era-defining moment for workers' rights" transcript, 2nd June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816173446/http://labourlist.org/2016/06/fighting-ttip-defending-workers-rights-and-protecting-refugees-corbyns-eu-speech/ |archivedate=2016-08-16 }}</ref> Corbyn listed various criticisms of the EU, and stated: "that’s not to say we can be satisfied with the European Union as it is".<ref name="PressLabourEngineer">{{cite web|title=Jeremy Corbyn MP leader of the Labour Party, speech at the Institute of Engineering Technology, London|url=http://press.labour.org.uk/post/145299237434/jeremy-corbyn-mp-leader-of-the-labour-party|website=Labour Press|accessdate=12 May 2017|date=2 June 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912052125/http://press.labour.org.uk/post/145299237434/jeremy-corbyn-mp-leader-of-the-labour-party|archivedate=12 September 2016}}</ref> He also rejected the claims that leaving the European Union would lead to a "year-long recession", implying that George Osborne had made the claim in error, adding "This is the same George Osborne who predicted [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|his austerity policies]] would close the deficit by 2015.

===Support for leaving the single market due to state aid rules===

In September 2016, Corbyn urged the government to abandon existing EU rules on state aid, saying the rules will be "no longer valid", after Britain leaves the bloc.<ref>{{cite news|last=Staunton|first=Denis|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/jeremy-corbyn-urges-government-to-tear-up-eu-state-aid-rules-1.2792878|title=Jeremy Corbyn urges government to tear up EU state aid rules|website=The Irish Times|date=16 September 2016|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref>

In May 2017 the European Union said they would not accept a customs deal that involved changes to the existing EU rules on state aid.

In July 2017, Corbyn said that Britain could not remain in the single market after leaving the EU, saying that membership of the single market was "dependent on membership of the EU". Shadow Minister Barry Gardiner later clarified that Corbyn meant that Labour interpreted the referendum result as wanting to leave the single market, with others pointing out that several countries are in the single market but not in the EU.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/jeremy-corbyn/news/87767/jeremy-corbyn-insists-uk-cannot-be |title=Jeremy Corbyn insists UK cannot be part of single market after Brexit |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807193404/https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/jeremy-corbyn/news/87767/jeremy-corbyn-insists-uk-cannot-be |archivedate=2017-08-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/15428436.Transitional_Brexit_trade_deal____may_last_until_2022___/ |title=Transitional Brexit trade deal 'may last until 2022' |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203131841/http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/15428436.Transitional_Brexit_trade_deal____may_last_until_2022___/ |archivedate=2017-12-03 }}</ref>

In 2018, Corbyn said his main reason for not committing to remaining in the single market was freedom from EU rules on state aid to industry. He said the UK government should not be "held back, inside or outside the EU, from taking the steps we need to support cutting edge industries and local business".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stone |first1=Jon |title=Brexit: Public backs Jeremy Corbyn's plan to abandon EU state aid rules, poll shows |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-state-aid-plan-brexit-restrictions-public-support-britain-eu-trade-a8297616.html |accessdate=6 October 2018 |publisher=The Independent |date=10 April 2018}}</ref> An anonymous senior EU official interviewed by ''The Times'' said that state subsidisation would be a red line in negotiations, as it would lead to a possible trade war between the UK and EU. The senior figure told ''The Times'': "We have to protect ourselves and the single market ... If a Corbyn government implements his declared policies the level playing field mechanism will lead to increased costs for Britain to access the single market because of distortions caused by state aid."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waterfield |first1=Bruno |last2=Fisher |first2=Lucy |title=Fear of Jeremy Corbyn-led government prompts tough EU line on Brexit |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fear-of-corbyn-prompts-tough-eu-line-on-brexit-lrcmwgvlx |accessdate=6 October 2018 |work=[[The Times]] |url-access=subscription |date=7 May 2018}}</ref>
