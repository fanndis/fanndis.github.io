The '''Committee on Armed Services''' (sometimes abbreviated SASC for ''Senate Armed Services Committee'' on its Web site) is a [[committee of the United States Senate]] empowered with [[Congressional oversight|legislative oversight]] of the [[Military of the United States|nation's military]], including the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], military [[research and development]], [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] (as pertaining to [[national security]]), benefits for members of the military, the [[Selective Service System]] and other matters related to defense policy. The Armed Services Committee was created as a result of the [[Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946]] following U.S. victory in the [[Second World War]]. It merged the responsibilities of the '''Committee on Naval Affairs''' (established in 1816) and the '''Committee on Military Affairs''' (also established in 1816). 

Considered one of the most powerful Senate committees, its broad mandate allowed it to report some of the most extensive and revolutionary legislation during the [[Cold War]] years, including the [[National Security Act of 1947]].  The committee tends to take a more bipartisan approach than other committees, as many of its members formerly served in the military or have major defense interests located in the   states they come from.<ref>Steinhauer, Jennifer.
