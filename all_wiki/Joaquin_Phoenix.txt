Arlyn moved to California, meeting Phoenix's father while hitchhiking. They married in 1969; years later, they joined a religious cult called the [[Family International|Children of God]] and began traveling throughout South America and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean, where Phoenix was born. They eventually became disenchanted with the cult and decided to leave the group, returning to the U.S. in 1977 when Phoenix was three years old.<ref name="Google Books"/><ref name="VanityFair2019"/> They changed their last name to Phoenix, after the [[Phoenix (mythology)|mythical bird]] that rises from its own ashes, symbolizing a new beginning.<ref name="aleka_phoeni53"/> Phoenix began calling himself "Leaf" around this time, having been inspired by spending time outdoors raking leaves and desiring to have a nature-related name like his siblings. This became the name he used as a child actor, until he changed it back to Joaquin at age 15.<ref name="hellomagazine.com"/>

===1995–1999: Return to acting===
Following the comeback of his acting career, Phoenix was often cast in supporting roles as conflicted, insecure characters with a dark side. In 1995, he co-starred in ''[[To Die For]]'', as a disturbed young man who is seduced by a woman ([[Nicole Kidman]]) to commit murder. Directed by [[Gus Van Sant]], the film was screened out of competition at the [[1995 Cannes Film Festival]] and became a financial and critical success, resulting in a domestic box office total of $21&nbsp;million. ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Janet Maslin]] praised Phoenix's performance, writing "So pity poor Jimmy. Rivetingly played by Mr Phoenix with a raw, anguished expressiveness that makes him an actor to watch for, Jimmy is both tempted and terrified by Suzanne's slick amorality. In that, he speaks for us all."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CEFDC103BF934A1575AC0A963958260|title=To Die For (1995) FILM REVIEW; She Trusts in TV's Redeeming Power|last=Maslin|first=Janet|date=September 27, 1995|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=March 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403040407/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CEFDC103BF934A1575AC0A963958260|archive-date=April 3, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3361/year/1995.html|title=Festival de Cannes:To Die For|accessdate=September 8, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822191002/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3361/year/1995.html|archive-date=August 22, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=todiefor.htm|title=To Die For(1995)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}</ref>

In 1997, Phoenix played a small-town troublemaker in [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[U Turn (1997 film)|U Turn]]'', and a poor man in love with a rich woman in ''[[Inventing the Abbotts]]''. The films were received with mostly mixed and negative reviews, respectively, and neither performed well at the box office.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971003/REVIEWS/710030303/1023 |title=U-Turn|publisher=[[Sun Times]] |date= October 3, 1997|accessdate=December 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/inventing-the-abbotts-1997|title=INVENTING THE ABBOTTS|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=April 4, 1997|work=[[Sun Times]]|accessdate=March 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313190542/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/inventing-the-abbotts-1997|archive-date=March 13, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The following year, Phoenix starred in ''[[Clay Pigeons]]'' (1998) as a young man in a small town who befriends a serial killer.

On January 26, 2006, while driving down a winding canyon road in Hollywood, Phoenix veered off the road and flipped his car. The crash was reportedly caused by brake failure. Shaken and confused, he heard someone tapping on his window and telling him to "just relax". Unable to see the man, Phoenix replied, "I'm fine. I am relaxed." The man replied, "No, you're not." The man then stopped Phoenix from lighting a cigarette while gasoline was leaking into the car cabin. Phoenix realized that the man was German filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]]. While Herzog helped Phoenix out of the wreckage by breaking the back window of the car, bystanders called an ambulance. Phoenix approached Herzog to express his gratitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Joaquin-Phoenix-rescued-from-car-crash-by-director-Werner-Herzog-17481.shtml |title=Joaquin Phoenix Rescued from Car Crash by Director Werner Herzog |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216000511/http://news.softpedia.com/news/Joaquin-Phoenix-rescued-from-car-crash-by-director-Werner-Herzog-17481.shtml |archive-date=February 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media |date=August 24, 2010 |title=My Son My Son, What Have Ye Done – Werner Herzog |medium=Video-recorded Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQzvpnmh4H8 |access-date=February 11, 2020 |publisher=[[Alchemy (company)|Millennium Entertainment]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215071448/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQzvpnmh4H8 |archive-date=February 15, 2018 |url-status=live }} (Herzog tells the story about the car crash while promoting his collaboration with David Lynch.

Phoenix unexpectedly announced in late 2008 that he had retired from acting to pursue a career in rap music, and that the forthcoming ''[[Two Lovers (2008 film)|Two Lovers]]'' would be his last film. On February 11, 2009, he appeared on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'' to promote ''Two Lovers''.

Phoenix is famous for his [[anxiety]] when acting and receiving awards. During a 2012 interview with [[Interview (magazine)|''Interview'']] magazine, he said, "I still get nauseous the day before and have weeks of incredible anxiety.
