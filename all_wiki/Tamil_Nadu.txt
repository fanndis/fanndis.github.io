'''Tamil Nadu''' ({{IPA-ta|ˈtamiɻ ˈnaːɽɯ|lang|Tamil Nadu.ogg}}) is one of the [[States and union territories of India|28 states of India]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Chennai]]. Tamil Nadu lies in the southernmost part of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and is bordered by the [[union territory]] of [[Puducherry]] and the [[South India]]n states of [[Kerala]], [[Karnataka]], and [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is bounded by the [[Eastern Ghats]] on the north, by the [[Nilgiri Mountains]], the [[Meghamalai]] Hills, and [[Kerala]] on the west, by the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the east, by the [[Gulf of Mannar]] and the [[Palk Strait]] on the southeast, and by the [[Indian Ocean]] on the south. The state shares a [[maritime border]] with the nation of [[Sri Lanka]].

The region was ruled by several empires, including the [[Three Crowned Kings|three great empires]] – [[Chera dynasty|Chera]], [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] and [[Pandya dynasty|Pandyan]] empires, which shape the region's [[Tamil cuisine|cuisine]], [[Tamil culture|culture]], and [[Architecture of Tamil Nadu|architecture]]. After the fall of [[Kingdom of Mysore]], the [[British Empire|British Colonial rule]] during the modern period led to the emergence of [[Chennai]], then known as Madras, as a metropolitan city. Modern-day Tamil Nadu was formed in 1956 after the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|reorganisation of states]] on linguistic lines. The state is home to a number of historic buildings, multi-religious pilgrimage sites, [[hill station]]s and three [[World Heritage site]]s.{{sfn|UNESCO|2012}}{{sfn|Press Information Bureau releases|2012}}<ref>{{Cite journal|date=March 1984|title=The Living culture of the Tamils; The UNESCO Courier: a window open on the world|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000746/074678eo.pdf|journal=The UNESCO Courier|volume=XXXVII, 3; 1984|access-date=28 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417120704/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000746/074678eo.pdf|archive-date=17 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Indus valley script between 2000 and 1500 BCE ===
A Neolithic stone [[Celt (tool)|celt]] (a hand-held axe) with the [[Indus script]] on it was discovered at Sembian-Kandiyur near [[Mayiladuthurai]] in Tamil Nadu. According to epigraphist [[Iravatham Mahadevan]], this was the first datable artefact bearing the Indus script to be found in Tamil Nadu. According to Mahadevan, the find was evidence of the use of the [[Harappan language]], and therefore that the "Neolithic people of the Tamil country spoke a [[Harappan language]]". The date of the celt was estimated at between 1500 BCE and 2000 BCE. Though this finding remains contested, like the claim of historian Michel Danino who rubbishes the theory of the latter's southward migration in a paper he presented at the International Symposium on Indus Civilisation and Tamil Language in 2007. He wrote: ‘There is no archaeological evidence of a southward migration through the Deccan after the end of the urban phase of the Indus Valley Civilisation The only actual evidence of movements at that period is of Late Harappans migrating towards the Ganges plains and towards Gujarat... Migration apart, there is a complete absence of Harappan artefacts and features south of the Vindhyas: no Harappan designs on pottery, no Harappan seals, crafts and ornaments, no trace of Harappan urbanism… Cultural continuity from Harappan to historical times has been increasingly documented in North India, but not in the South… This means, in effect, that the south-bound Late Harappans would have reverted from an advanced urban bronze-age culture to a Neolithic one! Their migration to South would thus constitute a double “archaeological miracle”: apart from being undetectable on the ground, it implies that the migrants experienced a total break with all their traditions. Such a phenomenon is unheard of.’

The early history of the people and rulers of Tamil Nadu is a topic in Tamil literary sources known as [[Sangam literature]]. Numismatic, archaeological and literary sources corroborate that the Sangam period lasted for about eight centuries, from 500 BCE to 300 CE. The recent excavations in [[Alagankulam]] archaeological site suggests that Alagankulam is one of the important trade centres or port cities of the Sangam Era.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/excavation-begins-at-alagankulam-archaeological-site/articleshow/58593108.cms |title=Excavation begins at Alagankulam archaeological site |access-date=26 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902082624/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/excavation-begins-at-alagankulam-archaeological-site/articleshow/58593108.cms |archive-date=2 September 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

During the 4th to 8th centuries, Tamil Nadu saw the rise of the [[Pallava dynasty]] under [[Mahendravarman I]] and his son ''Mamalla'' [[Narasimhavarman I]].{{sfn|Sastri|2008| pp= 91–92}} The Pallavas ruled parts of [[South India]] with [[Kanchipuram]] as their capital. [[Tamil architecture]] reached its peak during Pallava rule. [[Narasimhavarman II]] built the [[Shore Temple]] which is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

Much later, the [[Pallavas]] were replaced by the [[Chola dynasty]] as the dominant kingdom in the 9th century and they in turn were replaced by the [[Pandyan Dynasty]] in the 13th century. The Pandyan capital [[Madurai]] was in the deep south away from the coast. They had extensive trade links with the southeast Asian maritime empires of [[Srivijaya]] and their successors, as well as contacts, even formal diplomatic contacts, reaching as far as the [[Roman Empire]]. During the 13th century, [[Marco Polo]] mentioned the Pandyas as the richest empire in existence. Temples such as the [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] at [[Madurai]] and [[Nellaiappar Temple]] at [[Tirunelveli]] are the best examples of Pandyan temple architecture.{{sfn|Sastri|1970|pp=18–182}} The Pandyas excelled in both trade and literature. They controlled the pearl fisheries along the south coast of India, between Sri Lanka and India, which produced some of the finest pearls in the known ancient world.

{{Main|Chola dynasty}}
[[File:Rajendra map new.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The [[Chola Empire]] at its greatest extent, during the reign of [[Rajendra Chola I]] in 1030]]
During the 9th century, the Chola dynasty was once again revived by [[Vijayalaya Chola]], who established [[Thanjavur]] as Chola's new capital by conquering central Tamil Nadu from [[Mutharaiyar]] and the Pandya king [[Varagunavarman II]]. [[Aditya I]] and his son [[Parantaka I]] expanded the kingdom to the northern parts of Tamil Nadu by defeating the last Pallava king, [[Aparajitavarman]]. [[Parantaka Chola II]] expanded the Chola empire into what is now interior Andhra Pradesh and coastal Karnataka, while under the great [[Rajaraja Chola]] and his son [[Rajendra Chola]], the Cholas rose to a notable power in southeast Asia. Now the [[Chola Empire]] stretched as far as [[Bengal]] and Sri Lanka. At its peak, the empire spanned almost {{convert|3600000|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Rajaraja Chola conquered all of peninsular [[South India]] and parts of Sri Lanka. Rajendra Chola's navy went even further, occupying coasts from Burma (now ) to Vietnam, the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], Lakshadweep, [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], Philippines<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tamilculturewaterloo.org/tamillanguage.htm |title=Tamil Cultural Association&nbsp;– Tamil Language |publisher=Tamilculturewaterloo.org |access-date=23 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413062503/http://tamilculturewaterloo.org/tamillanguage.htm |archive-date=13 April 2015 }}</ref> in South East Asia and Pegu islands. He defeated [[Mahipala]], the king of Bengal, and to commemorate his victory he built a new capital and named it [[Gangaikonda Cholapuram]].

The Cholas were prolific temple builders right from the times of the first medieval king [[Vijayalaya Chola]]. These are the earliest specimen of Dravidian temples under the Cholas. His son Aditya I built several temples around the Kanchi and Kumbakonam regions. The Cholas went on to becoming a great power and built some of the most imposing religious structures in their lifetime and they also renovated temples and buildings of the [[Pallavas]], acknowledging their common socio-religious and cultural heritage. The celebrated [[Nataraja]] temple at [[Chidambaram]] and the [[Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam|Ranganathaswamy Temple]] at [[Srirangam]], [[Tiruchirappalli]], held special significance for the Cholas which have been mentioned in their inscriptions as their tutelary deities. [[Rajaraja Chola I]] and his son [[Rajendra Chola]] built temples such as the [[Brihadeshvara Temple]] of Thanjavur and Brihadeshvara Temple of [[Gangaikonda Cholapuram]], the [[Airavatesvara Temple]] of [[Darasuram]] and the [[Sarabeswara]] (Shiva) Temple, also called the Kampahareswarar Temple at [[Thirubuvanam|Thirubhuvanam]], the last two temples being located near Kumbakonam. The first three of the above four temples are titled [[Great Living Chola Temples]] among the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]].

=== Vijayanagar and Nayak period (1336–1646) ===
{{Main|Vijayanagara Empire}}

The Muslim invasions of southern India triggered the establishment of the [[Hindu]] [[Vijayanagara Empire]] with [[Vijayanagara]] in modern [[Karnataka]] as its capital. The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c. 1370 and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the [[Battle of Talikota]] in 1565 by a confederacy of [[Deccan sultanates]]. Subsequently, as the Vijayanagara Empire went into decline after the mid-16th century, many local rulers, called [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]], succeeded in gaining the trappings of independence. This eventually resulted in the further weakening of the empire; many Nayaks declared themselves independent, among whom the [[Nayaks of Madurai]] and Tanjore were the first to declare their independence, despite initially maintaining loose links with the Vijayanagara kingdom.{{sfn|Sastri|1970|pp=18–182}} The Nayaks of Madurai and [[Nayaks of Thanjavur]] were the most prominent Nayaks of the 17th century. They reconstructed some of the well-known temples in Tamil Nadu such as the [[Meenakshi Temple]].

=== Power struggles of the 18th century (1688–1802) ===
By the early 18th century, the political scene in Tamil Nadu saw a major change-over and was under the control of many minor rulers aspiring to be independent. The fall of the Vijayanagara empire and the Chandragiri Nayakas gave the [[sultanate of Golconda]] a chance to expand into the Tamil heartland. When the sultanate was incorporated into the Mughal Empire in 1688, the northern part of current-day Tamil Nadu was administrated by the [[Nawab of the Carnatic]], who had his seat in [[Arcot]] from 1715 onward. Meanwhile, to the south, the fall of the [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] led to a short-lived [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The fall of the [[Madurai Nayaks]] brought up many small Nayakars of southern Tamil Nadu, who ruled small parcels of land called Palayams. The chieftains of these Palayams were known as [[Palaiyakkarar]] (or 'polygar' as called by British) and were ruling under the nawabs of the Carnatic.

In 1762, a tripartite treaty was signed between Thanjavur Maratha, Carnatic, and the British by which Thanjavur became a vassal of the Nawab of the Carnatic which eventually ceded to the British.

In the south, Nawabs granted taxation rights to the British which led to conflicts between British and the Palaiyakkarar, which resulted in series of wars called [[Polygar war]] to establish independent states by the aspiring Palaiyakkarar.

Legislative powers are given to the Governor's council under the Indian Councils Act 1861 and 1909 [[Minto-Morley Reforms]] eventually led to the establishment of the [[Madras Legislative Council]]. Failure of the summer monsoons and administrative shortcomings of the [[Ryotwari]] system resulted in two severe famines in the Madras Presidency, the [[Great Famine of 1876–78]] and the [[Indian famine of 1896–97]]. The famine led to the migration of people as bonded labourers for the British to various countries which eventually formed the present [[Tamil diaspora]].

=== Post-Independence (1947–present) ===
When India became independent in 1947, Madras presidency became [[Madras State]], comprising present-day Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra Pradesh up to Ganjam district in Odisha, South Canara district Karnataka, and parts of Kerala. The state was subsequently split up along linguistic lines. In 1969, Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning "Tamil country".<ref>{{cite book |title=Migrant women and urban labour market: concepts and case studies |page=105 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uMlVGtjbcSIC&q=madras+state+became+Tamilnadu&pg=PA105|isbn=9788176299664 |last1=Sundari |first1=Dr. S. |year=2007 }}</ref>

Tamil Nadu covers an area of {{convert|130058|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and is the tenth-largest state in India. The bordering states are [[Kerala]] to the west, [[Karnataka]] to the north-west and [[Andhra Pradesh]] to the north. To the east is the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the state encircles the [[union territory]] of [[Puducherry]]. The southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula is [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]] which is the meeting point of the [[Arabian Sea]], the Bay of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean.

The western, southern, and the northwestern parts are hilly and rich in vegetation. The [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Eastern Ghats]] meet at the [[Nilgiri Hills]]. The Western Ghats traverse the entire western border with Kerala, effectively blocking much of the rain-bearing clouds of the south-west monsoon from entering the state. The eastern parts are fertile coastal plains and the northern parts are a mix of hills and plains. The central and the south-central regions are arid plains and receive less rainfall than the other regions.

Tamil Nadu is mostly dependent on monsoon rains and thereby is prone to droughts when the monsoons fail. The climate of the state ranges from dry sub-humid to semi-arid. The state has two distinct periods of rainfall:
* [[Monsoon|South west monsoon]] from June to September, with strong southwest winds;
* [[Monsoon#Late in Year|North east monsoon]] from October to December, with dominant northeast winds;

The annual rainfall of the state is about {{convert|945|mm|in|abbr=on}} of which 48 per cent is through the northeast monsoon, and 32 per cent through the southwest monsoon. Since the state is entirely dependent on rains for recharging its water resources, monsoon failures lead to acute [[water scarcity]] and [[2016–17 Drought in Tamil Nadu|severe drought]].{{sfn|UN, system of organisations|2012}} Tamil Nadu is divided into seven agro-climatic zones: northeast, northwest, west, southern, high rainfall, high altitude hilly, and [[Kaveri]] Delta (the most fertile agricultural zone).

{{Main|Protected areas of Tamil Nadu}}
Tamil Nadu has a wide range of [[biomes]] extending east from the [[South Western Ghats montane rain forests]] in the [[Western Ghats]] through the [[South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests]] and [[Deccan thorn scrub forests]] to [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]] and then to the beaches, [[estuaries]], [[salt marsh]]es, [[mangrove]]s, [[seagrass]]es and [[coral reef]]s of the [[Bay of Bengal]].
The state has a range of flora and fauna with many species and habitats. To protect this diversity of wildlife there are [[Protected areas]] of Tamil Nadu as well as [[Biosphere reserves of India|biospheres]] which protect larger areas of natural habitat often include one or more national parks. The [[Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve]] established in 1986 is a marine ecosystem with seaweed seagrass communities, coral reefs, salt marshes, and mangrove forests.

Tamil Nadu has been a pioneering state of [[E-Governance]] initiatives in India. A large part of the government records like land ownership records are digitised and all major offices of the state government like [[Urban Local Bodies]]&nbsp;– all the corporations and municipal office activities&nbsp;– revenue collection, land registration offices, and transport offices have been computerised. Tamil Nadu is one of the states where law and order has been maintained largely successfully.{{sfn|Tamil Nadu Police|2011}} The [[Tamil Nadu Police]] Force is over 140 years old. It is the fifth-largest state police force in India (as of 2015, total police force of TN is 1,11,448) and has the highest proportion of women police personnel in the country (total women police personnel of TN is 13,842 which is about 12.42%) to specifically handled [[violence against women in Tamil Nadu]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/data/women-police-personnel-face-bias-says-report/article7554550.ece?theme=true |title=Women police personnel face bias, says report |author=Rukmini S. |newspaper=The Hindu |access-date=29 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016041856/http://www.thehindu.com/data/women-police-personnel-face-bias-says-report/article7554550.ece?theme=true |archive-date=16 October 2015 |url-status=live  |date=19 August 2015 }}</ref>{{sfn|TN Police strength|2011}} In 2003, the state had a total police population ratio of 1:668, higher than the national average of 1:717.

=== Administrative subdivisions ===
{{Main|Districts of Tamil Nadu|Local government bodies in Tamil Nadu}}
[[File:Tamil Nadu District Map.png|alt=|thumb|315x315px|Districts of Tamil Nadu]]
Tamil Nadu is divided in to four major divisions as per the ancient Tamil kings namely [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava Nadu]] division, [[Chera Nadu]] division, [[Chola Nadu]] division and [[Pandya Nadu]] division and the four divisions are further subdivided into 38 [[Districts of India|districts]], which are listed below. A district is administered by a [[District Collector]] who is mostly an [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS) member, appointed by State Government. Districts are further divided into 226 [[Tehsil|Taluks]] administrated by [[Tehsildar|Tahsildars]] comprising 1127 [[Revenue block]]s administrated by Revenue Inspector (RI). A District has also one or more Revenue Divisions (in total 76) administrated by Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO), constituted by many Revenue Blocks. 16,564 Revenue villages ([[Village Panchayat]]) are the primary grassroots level administrative units which in turn might include many villages and administered by a Village Administrative Officer (VAO), many of which form a Revenue Block.

===Demand for new districts===
Due to increased population and for administrative purposes, there is an increase in demands for new districts:
*[[Kongunadu Makkal Desia Katchi]] general secretary [[E. R. Eswaran]] reiterated his demand for creation of new districts splitting [[Coimbatore district|Coimbatore]] and [[Erode district|Erode]]. Eswaran argued that both these districts had a large number of factories.<ref name="NIE2019"/>

=== Pre-Independence ===
Prior to Indian independence, Tamil Nadu was under British colonial rule as part of the [[Madras Presidency]]. The main party in Tamil Nadu at that time was the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC). [[List of political parties in India|Regional parties]] have dominated state politics since 1916. One of the earliest regional parties, the South Indian Welfare Association, a forerunner to [[Dravidian parties]] in Tamil Nadu, was started in 1916. The party was called after its English organ, [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], by its opponents. Later, [[South Indian Liberal Federation]] was adopted as its official name. The reason for the victory of the Justice Party in elections was the non-participation of the INC, demanding complete independence of India.

The Justice Party which was under [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|E. V. Ramasamy]] was renamed [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] in 1944. It was a non-political party which demanded the establishment of an independent state called [[Dravida Nadu]]. However, due to the differences between its two leaders E. V. Ramasamy and [[C. N. Annadurai]], the party was split.

=== Post-Independence ===
C. N. Annadurai left the party Dravida Kazhagam to form the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK). The DMK decided to enter politics in 1956. After the demise of C. N. Annadurai, [[M. Karunanidhi]] became the leader of the party which was supported by majority leaders including then famous actor [[M. G. Ramachandran]]. As a breakaway faction of the DMK. In 1972, M. G. Ramachandran founded the new Dravidian party [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK) named after his political mentor C. N. Annadurai popularly called "Anna".

Most early Tamil literary works are in verse form, with prose not becoming more common until later periods. The Sangam literature collection contains 2381 poems composed by 473 poets, some 102 of whom remain anonymous.<ref>George L. Hart III, ''The Poems of Ancient Tamil,'' U of California P, 1975.</ref> Sangam literature is primarily secular, dealing with everyday themes in a [[Tamilakam]] context.<ref>The only religious poems among the shorter poems occur in ''[[paripaatal]]''. The rest of the corpus of Sangam literature deals with human relations and emotions. See K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, ''A History of South India'', OUP (1955) pp. 330–335</ref> The Sangam literature also deals with human relations and emotions.{{sfn|Sastri|2008|pp=330–335}} The available literature from this period was categorised and compiled in the 10th century into two categories based roughly on chronology. The categories are: [[Pathinenmaelkanakku]] (''The Major Eighteen Anthology Series'') comprising [[Ettuthokai|Eṭṭuttokai]] (''The Eight Anthologies'') and the [[Pattupattu]] (''Ten Idylls'') and [[Pathinenkilkanakku]] (''The Minor Eighteen Anthology Series'').

Much of Tamil grammar is extensively described in the oldest known grammar book for the Tamil language, the ''[[Tolkāppiyam]].''Modern Tamil is largely based on the 13th-century grammar book ''{{IAST|Naṉṉūl}}'' which restated and clarified the rules of the ''Tolkāppiyam'', with some modifications. Traditional Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely ''{{IAST|eḻuttu}}'', ''sol'', ''{{IAST|poruḷ}}'', ''yāppu'', ''{{IAST|aṇi}}''. Of these, the last two are mostly applied in poetry.<ref name="five_parts_grammar">{{Citation |url=http://www.southasia.upenn.edu/tamil/lit.html |title=Five fold grammar of Tamil |work=University of Pennsylvania |access-date=8 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609115617/http://www.southasia.upenn.edu/tamil/lit.html |archive-date=9 June 2007 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Notable example of Tamil poetry include the ''[[Tirukkural]]'' written by [[Tiruvalluvar]].

In 1578, the Portuguese published a Tamil book in old Tamil script named 'Thambiraan Vanakkam', thus making Tamil the first Indian language to be printed and published.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-saw-its-first-book-in-1578/article476102.ece |title=Tamil saw its first book in 1578 |author=Karthik Madhavan |newspaper=The Hindu |access-date=8 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101181012/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-saw-its-first-book-in-1578/article476102.ece |archive-date=1 January 2016 |url-status=live  |date=21 June 2010 }}</ref> ''[[Tamil Lexicon]]'', published by the [[University of Madras]], is the first among the [[dictionary|dictionaries]] published in any Indian language.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kolappan |first=B. |title=Delay, howlers in Tamil Lexicon embarrass scholars |newspaper=The Hindu |location=Chennai |date=22 June 2014 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/delay-howlers-in-tamil-lexicon-embarrass-scholars/article6138747.ece |access-date=25 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704063848/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/delay-howlers-in-tamil-lexicon-embarrass-scholars/article6138747.ece |archive-date=4 July 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> During the [[Indian Independence Movement]], many Tamil poets and writers sought to provoke national spirit, social equity and secularist thoughts among the common man, notably [[Subramanya Bharathy]] and [[Bharathidasan]].

[[Pongal (festival)|Pongal]], also called ''Tamizhar Thirunaal'' (festival of Tamils) or Makara Sankranti elsewhere in India, a four-day [[harvest festival]] is one of the most widely celebrated festivals throughout Tamil Nadu.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tamilnadu.com/arts/pongal.html |title=Pongal&nbsp;– Tamil festival |publisher=Tamilnadu.com |date=4 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208233319/http://tamilnadu.com/arts/pongal.html |archive-date=8 February 2014}}</ref> The Tamil language saying ''Thai Pirandhal Vazhi Pirakkum''&nbsp;– literally meaning, the birth of the month of Thai will pave way for new opportunities&nbsp;– is often quoted with reference to this festival. The first day, Bhogi Pongal is celebrated by throwing away and destroying old clothes and materials by setting them on fire to mark the end of the old and emergence of the new. The second day, Surya Pongal is the main day which falls on the first day of the tenth Tamil month of Thai (14 January or 15 January in the western calendar). On the third day, Maattu Pongal is meant to offer thanks to the cattle, as they provide milk and are used to plough the lands. [[Jallikattu]], a bull-taming contest, marks the main event of this day. [[Alanganallur]] is famous for its Jallikattu<ref>{{cite web |author=Alanganallur-Jallikattu |url=http://shadowchief.com/alanganallur-jallikattu/ |title=Alanganallur-Jallikattu, Madurai, Tamil Nadu |publisher=Shadow Chief |access-date=23 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927220438/http://shadowchief.com/alanganallur-jallikattu/ |archive-date=27 September 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/keyword/alanganallur |work=The Times of India |title=Alanganallur |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127035608/http://www.cwet.tn.nic.in/html/information_isw.html |archive-date=27 November 2006}}</ref> contest usually held on the third day of Pongal. During this final day, Kaanum Pongal&nbsp;– the word ''kaanum'', means 'to view' in Tamil. In 2011 the [[Madras High Court]] Bench ordered the cockfight at Santhapadi and Modakoor Melbegam villages permitted during the Pongal festival while disposing of a petition filed attempting to ban the cockfight.{{sfn|''The Hindu''|14 January 2011}}
The first month in the Tamil calendar is Chittirai and the first day of this month in mid-April is celebrated as Tamil New Year. The Thiruvalluvar calendar is 31 years ahead of the [[Gregorian calendar]], i.e. Gregorian 2000 is Thiruvalluvar 2031. Aadi Perukku is celebrated on the 18th day of the Tamil month Aadi, which celebrates the rising of the water level in the river [[Kaveri]]. Apart from the major festivals, in every village and town of Tamil Nadu, the inhabitants celebrate festivals for the local gods once a year and the time varies from place to place. Most of these festivals are related to the goddess [[Maariyamman]], the mother goddess of the rain. Other major Hindu festivals including [[Deepavali]] (Death of Narakasura), Ayudha Poojai, Saraswathi Poojai ([[Navratri|Dasara]]), [[Krishna]] Jayanthi and [[Vinayaka Chathurthi]] are also celebrated. [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Bakrid]], [[Milad un Nabi]], [[Aashurah|Muharram]] are celebrated by Muslims whereas [[Christmas]], [[Good Friday]], [[Easter]] are celebrated by Christians in the state. Mahamagam a bathing festival at [[Kumbakonam]] in Tamil Nadu is celebrated once in 12 years. People from all the corners of the country come to [[Kumbakonam]] for the festival. This festival is also called Kumbamela of South.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mahamagam Festival |url=http://blessingsonthenet.com/indian-festival/festival/id/227/mahamagam-festival/ |access-date=7 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209192800/http://blessingsonthenet.com/indian-festival/festival/id/227/mahamagam-festival/ |archive-date=9 February 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Fairs and Festivals of India |page=326 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAbgAAAAMAAJ&q=maha+magam|last1=Bezbaruah |first1=Madan Prasad |last2=Krishna Gopal |first2=Dr |last3=Girota |first3=Phal S. |year=2003 |isbn=9788121208093 }}</ref>
