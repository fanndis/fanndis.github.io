'''''Irreemplazable''''' is the first [[extended play]] (EP) by American singer [[Beyoncé]]. Comprising [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]] and [[Spanglish]] re-recordings of songs from her second [[studio album]] ''[[B'Day (Beyoncé album)|B'Day]]'' (2006), it featured as a bonus disc for the North American deluxe edition of ''B'Day'', before being released separately on August 28, 2007 through [[Columbia Records]] and [[Music World Entertainment]]. It was produced by Cuban American musician [[Rudy Pérez]] who also helped with writing the songs in Spanish. Copies purchased from [[Walmart]] also contain a [[DVD]] featuring a Beyoncé's concert, television performances and behind-the-scenes footage.

''Irreemplazable'' received a mixed review from [[AllMusic]]'s Andy Kellman, who criticized its lack of content and the fact that the EP was released several months after the deluxe edition of ''B'Day''. ''Irreemplazable'' peaked at number one-hundred-and-five on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and has sold 57,000 copies in the United States. It also appeared on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], the [[Top Latin Albums]] and the [[Latin Pop Albums]] charts. "[[Beautiful Liar|Bello Embustero]]", the Spanish version of "[[Beautiful Liar]]" (a duet with Colombian singer [[Shakira]]) was nominated for [[Latin Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] at the [[8th Annual Latin Grammy Awards]] (2007).

==Background==
Growing up in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], Beyoncé was surrounded by the [[Spanish language]], and learned some Spanish as a child, which she later forgot. When re-recording songs for ''Irreemplazable'', Beyoncé's vocal coach provided the Spanish lyrics phonetically, and each line was recorded up to four times for the EP. Beyoncé has stated that she intends to take up Spanish lessons in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spanish.about.com/b/2007/04/05/beyonc-adds-spanish-tracks-to-hit-album.htm |title=Beyoncé adds Spanish tracks to hit album |first=Gerald |last=Erichsen |publisher=[[About.com]]. [[The New York Times Company]] |date=April 5, 2007 |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref> She said of the EP's recording, "This is such an honor for me to be able to connect with all my fans. I had so much fun singing in Spanish. It reminded me of growing up in Houston".<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.hispanicprwire.com/news.php?l=in&id=9164 |title=Beyoncé has a Special Gift for MTV Tr3s Fans |publisher=[[Music World Entertainment]] |date=August 1, 2007 |location=New York |accessdate=April 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829002716/http://www.hispanicprwire.com/news.php?l=in&id=9164 |archivedate=August 29, 2007 }}</ref> ''[[The Denver Post]]''{{'s}} John Wenzel interpreted the release of ''Irreemplazable'' as "an effort to meet the exploding market for Spanish language music".<ref name="marketing"/>

==Music and lyrics==
''Irreemplazable'' is primarily a [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Latin pop]] album. The Spanish-language songs from the EP were written by Cuban American composer [[Rudy Pérez]] and he wrote the lyrics phonetically to help Beyoncé perform the songs in Spanish. "We spent hours and hours working on it. She wanted to make it perfect. She worked hard. That's why people are saying it sounds like she's fluent in Spanish", Perez added.<ref name="rudyperez">{{cite web|last=du Lac|first=J.

He assisted with Beyoncé on pronouncing her r's in Spanish.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cobo|first1=Leila|authorlink1=Leila Cobo|title=Translation Tricks Rudy Teaches Beyoncé Spanish|journal=Billboard|date=January 20, 2007|volume=119|issue=3|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12|accessdate=August 12, 2015|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> ''Irreemplazable'' opens with "[[Amor Gitano]]", a duet with [[Alejandro Fernández]] originally from Fernández' fifteenth studio album, ''[[Viento a Favor (Alejandro Fernández album)|Viento a Favor]]''. "[[Listen (Beyoncé song)|Listen]]", a theme song from ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'', in which Beyoncé appears, was re-recorded under the title "Oye". The EP's title track is a Spanish version of "[[Irreplaceable]]", a song that was highly successful in its English recording.<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=beyoncé|chart=all}} |title=Irreplaceable – Beyoncé |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://hitparade.ch/showitem.asp?interpret=Beyonc%E9&titel=Irreplaceable&cat=s |title=Beyoncé – Irreplaceable |publisher=Hitparade.ch. Hung Medien |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref> Three recordings of "[[Beautiful Liar]]" appear on ''Irreemplazable'': a Spanish version (titled "Bello Embustero"), a remixed English version and a [[Spanglish]] version. A [[norteño (music)|norteña]] remix of "Irreemplazable" is the EP's seventh track, while [[Timbaland]]'s remix of "Get Me Bodied", which features [[vocals]] from [[Voltio]], closes ''Irreemplazable''.

==Critical reception==
Giving it two and a half stars, Andy Kellman of [[AllMusic]] said that "there's not that much to the disc," and alleged that it was unnecessary, concluding "if you're a die-hard Beyoncé fan, you'll probably feel jerked around a bit — especially if you bought ''B'Day'' when it came out in September 2006 and bought the deluxe edition seven months later, only to find out that the bonus material would later come out on its own (with a track not on the second disc of the deluxe edition!)." Kellman selected "Amor Gitano", "Irreemplazable" and the "Get Me Bodied" remix as the highlights of the EP.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1087822 |tab=review|accessdate=April 14, 2011|first=Andy|last=Kellman}}</ref> The EP led to Beyoncé receiving a nomination for [[Lo Nuestro Award for Pop New Artist of the Year|Pop New Artist of the Year]] at the [[Premio Lo Nuestro 2008|2008]] [[Lo Nuestro Awards]],<ref name="univision-lonuestro-2008">{{cite news|url=http://m.peopleenespanol.com/article/nominees-premio-lo-nuestro-2008-announced|title=Nominees for Premio Lo Nuestro 2008 Announced|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc]]|date=December 13, 2007|accessdate=September 27, 2013}}</ref> and "[[Beautiful Liar|Bello Embustero]]" was nominated for [[Latin Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] at the [[Latin Grammy Awards of 2007|8th Annual]] [[Latin Grammy Awards]].<ref name="LatinGrammys">{{cite news|title=Beyonce, Fergie Get Latin Grammy Nods|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/beyonce-fergie-get-latin-grammy-nods/|accessdate=August 12, 2015|work=[[CBS News]]|publisher=[[CBS]]|date=August 29, 2007}}</ref>
