===The Manhattan Company===
{{main|Bank of the Manhattan Company}}
Chase traces its history back to the founding of The Manhattan Company by [[Aaron Burr]] on September 1, 1799, in a house at 40 Wall Street:<ref name=1799hist/>

{{quote|After an epidemic of yellow fever in 1798, during which coffins had been sold by itinerant vendors on street corners, [[Aaron Burr]] established the Manhattan Company, with the ostensible aim of bringing clean water to the city from the [[Bronx River]] but in fact, designed as a front for the creation of New York's second bank, rivaling [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s [[Bank of New York]].|''[[The Economist]]''<ref name="economist">{{cite news| title=Soaking the poor| url=http://www.economist.com/node/330993| work=[[The Economist]]| first=Gerard T.| last=Koeppel| date=March 16, 2000| accessdate=October 14, 2011}}</ref>}}

===Chase National Bank===
Chase National Bank was formed in 1877 by [[John Thompson (banker)|John Thompson]].<ref name=1799hist/> It was named after former [[United States Treasury Secretary]] and Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]],<ref name=history/> although Chase did not have a connection with the bank.<ref name=1799hist/>

The Chase National Bank acquired a number of smaller banks in the 1920s through its Chase Securities Corporation. In 1926, for instance, it acquired [[Mechanics and Metals National Bank]]. [[File:The Chase National Bank of the City of New York, Specimen Stock Certificate.jpg|thumb|Specimen Stock Certificate]]

However, its most significant acquisition was that of the Equitable Trust Company of New York in 1930, the largest stockholder of which was [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]]<ref name="memoirs">{{cite book| title=David Rockefeller: Memoirs| first=David| last=Rockefeller| place=New York| publisher=Random House| date=October 15, 2002| isbn=978-0-679-40588-7| pages=[https://archive.org/details/davidrockefeller00davi/page/124 124–25]| url=https://archive.org/details/davidrockefeller00davi/page/124}}</ref> This made Chase the largest bank in America and indeed, in the world.

Chase was primarily a [[wholesale banking|wholesale bank]], dealing with other prominent financial institutions and major corporate clients, such as [[General Electric]],<ref>[[Ron Chernow|Chernow, R.]], ''The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance'' (New York: [[Grove Atlantic]], 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgNUEqkgctEC&pg=PT450 p. 450].</ref>{{rp|450}} which had, through its [[RCA]] subsidiary, leased prominent space and become a crucial first tenant of [[Rockefeller Center]], rescuing that major project in 1930. The bank is also closely associated with and has financed the [[oil industry]], having longstanding connections with its board of directors to the successor companies of [[Standard Oil]], especially [[ExxonMobil]], which are also Rockefeller holdings.

[[File:Chase 1962 logo.png|thumb|200px|The 1961–1976 logo]]
In 1955, Chase National Bank and The Manhattan Company merged to create The Chase Manhattan Bank.<ref name=1799hist/> As Chase was a much larger bank, it was first intended that Chase acquire the "Bank of Manhattan", as it was nicknamed, but it transpired that Burr's original charter for the Manhattan Company had not only included the clause allowing it to start a bank with surplus funds, but another requiring unanimous consent of shareholders for the bank to be taken over. The deal was therefore structured as an acquisition by the Bank of the Manhattan Company of Chase National, with [[John J. McCloy]] becoming chairman of the merged entity. This avoided the need for unanimous consent by shareholders.

For Chase Manhattan Bank's new logo, [[Chermayeff & Geismar]] designed a stylized octagon in 1961, which remains part of the bank's logo today.<ref name="Chermayeff">{{cite web| title=Chase Manhattan Bank| url=http://cgstudionyc.com/identities/chase| publisher=Chermayeff & Geismar| accessdate=October 14, 2011}}</ref> It has been reported that the Chase logo was a stylized representation of the primitive water pipes laid by the Manhattan Company,<ref name="tett">{{cite book| last=Tett| first=Gillian| authorlink=Gillian Tett| title=Fool's Gold: How the Bold Dream of a Small Tribe at J.P.

According to Chermayeff, the Chase logo was merely intended to be distinctive and geometric, and was not intended at all to resemble a cross-section of a wooden water pipe.<ref>{{cite news |title=Correction: Badillo’s World, One Tenement’s Tale and Eau N.Y.C. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/nyregion/thecity/28corr1.html |accessdate=4 September 2020 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=27 January 2007}}</ref>  

The bank included an asset management business called the Chase Investors Management Corporation.  Under McCloy's successor, George Champion, the bank relinquished its antiquated 1799 state charter for a modern one. In 1969, under the leadership of [[David Rockefeller]], the bank became part of a [[bank holding company]], the [[Chase Manhattan Corporation]].<ref name=history/>

The mergers and acquisitions during this period allowed Chase Manhattan to expand its influence over many non-financial corporations.

===Mergers with Chemical, J.P. Morgan===
[[File:Chase logo pre merger.png|thumb|The 1976–2005 logo]]

In August 1995, [[Chemical Bank]] of New York and Chase Manhattan Bank announced plans to merge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/08/29/chase-chemical-to-merge-creating-largest-us-bank/dc919233-bfe4-4b73-b321-286a243d9540/|title=Chase, Chemical to Merge, Creating Largest U.S. Bank|last=Mathews|first=Jay|date=29 August 1995|website=The Washington Post}}</ref> The merger was completed in August 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/1996/09/02/story6.html|title=Bank president leaves post in wake of wedding|last=Pinckney|first=Barbara|date=2 September 1996|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref> Chemical's previous acquisitions included [[Manufacturers Hanover Corporation]], in 1991, and [[Texas Commerce Bank]], in 1987. Although Chemical was the nominal survivor, the merged company retained the Chase name since not only was it was better known (particularly outside the United States), but the original charter of Chase required that the name be retained in any future business ventures.  Hence, even today, it is known as JPMorgan Chase.

In December 2000, the combined Chase Manhattan completed the acquisition of [[J.P. Morgan & Co.]] in one of the largest banking mergers to date. The combined company was renamed [[JPMorgan Chase]]. In 2004, the bank acquired [[Bank One]], making Chase the largest credit card issuer in the United States. JPMorgan Chase added [[Bear Stearns]] and [[Washington Mutual]] to its acquisitions in 2008 and 2009 respectively. After closing nearly 400 overlapping branches of the combined company, less than 10% of its total, Chase will have approximately 5,410 branches in 23 states as of the closing date of the acquisition.<ref name="bloomberg">{{cite news|title=WaMu lists debt of $8B in bankruptcy |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a_WW5ZH_P_A0&refer=home |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412064207/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a_WW5ZH_P_A0&refer=home |archivedate=April 12, 2012 |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=September 27, 2008 |first1=Jef |last1=Feeley |first2=Steven |last2=Church |accessdate=October 14, 2011 |publisher=Bloomberg |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="expect">{{cite news| url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/biz/6026107.html| title=Q&A What former WaMu customers can expect| work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date=September 26, 2008| via=[[Houston Chronicle]]| accessdate=October 14, 2011}}</ref> According to data from SNL Financial (data as of June 30, 2008), this places Chase third behind [[Wells Fargo]] and [[Bank of America]] in terms of total U.S. retail bank branches.

===Bank One Corporation===
{{Main|Bank One Corporation}}

In 2004, JPMorgan Chase merged with [[Chicago]]-based [[Bank One Corporation|Bank One Corp.]], bringing on board its current chairman and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Jamie Dimon]] as president and [[Chief operating officer|COO]] and designating him as CEO [[William B. Harrison, Jr.]]'s successor. Dimon's pay was pegged at 90% of Harrison's. Dimon quickly made his influence felt by embarking on a cost-cutting strategy and replaced former JPMorgan Chase executives in key positions with Bank One executives—many of whom were with Dimon at [[Citigroup]]. Dimon became CEO in January 2006 and Chairman in December 2006 after Harrison's resignation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Touryalai |first1=Halah |title=4 Reasons JPMorgan Needs Jamie Dimon As CEO And Chairman Right Now |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2013/05/07/4-reasons-jpmorgan-needs-jamie-dimon-as-ceo-and-chairman-right-now/#128df573671c |website=Forbes |accessdate=22 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

[[Bank One Corporation]] was formed upon the 1998 merger between Banc One of [[Columbus, Ohio]] and [[First Chicago Bank|First Chicago NBD]]. These two large banking companies were themselves created through the merger of many banks. JPMorgan Chase completed the acquisition of [[Bank One]] in Q3 2004. The merger between Bank One and JPMorgan Chase meant that corporate headquarters were now in New York City while the retail bank operations of Chase were consolidated in New York.<ref name="merger">{{cite press release| title=JPMorgan Chase, Bank One complete merger| date=July 1, 2004| publisher=JPMorgan Chase| url=http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=144508| accessdate=October 14, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216155756/http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=144508| archive-date=February 16, 2016| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Henry, D., [https://in.reuters.com/article/jpmorgan-ceo-lake/insight-how-jpmorgans-cfo-became-the-top-prospect-to-succeed-dimon-idINKCN1LV02X "Insight: How JPMorgan's CFO became the top prospect to succeed Dimon"], [[Reuters]], September 15, 2018.</ref>

===Washington Mutual===
{{Main|Washington Mutual}}
On September 25, 2008, JPMorgan Chase bought most banking operations of Washington Mutual from the [[receivership]] of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC).<ref>Dutton, R., ''Financial Meltdown'' ([[Oxton, Merseyside|Oxton]]: Infodial, 2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KEJeCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA115 p. 115].</ref>{{rp|115}} That night, the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]], in what was by far the largest bank failure in American history, seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into receivership. The FDIC sold the bank's assets, secured debt obligations and deposits to JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA for $1.888 billion, which re-opened the bank the following day. As a result of the takeover, Washington Mutual shareholders lost all their [[Equity investment|equity]].<ref name="Ellis">{{cite news| first1=David| last1=Ellis| first2=Jeanne| last2=Sahadi| url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/09/25/news/companies/JPM_WaMu/index.htm?postversion=2008092519| title=JPMorgan buys WaMu| publisher=CNN| date=September 25, 2008| accessdate=October 14, 2011}}</ref> Through the acquisition, JPMorgan became owner of the former accounts of [[Providian Financial]], a credit card issuer [[Washington Mutual|WaMu]] acquired in 2005. The company completed the rebranding of Washington Mutual branches to Chase in late 2009.

===Other recent acquisitions===
In the first-quarter of 2006, Chase purchased [[Collegiate Funding Services]], a portfolio company of private equity firm [[Lightyear Capital]], for $663 million. CFS was used as the foundation for the Chase Student Loans, previously known as Chase Education Finance.<ref name="Collegiate">{{cite news| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20051215005717/en/Chase-Acquire-Collegiate-Funding-Services| title=Chase to Acquire Collegiate Funding Services| publisher=Business Wire| date=December 15, 2005| accessdate=October 14, 2011}}</ref>

In April of that same year (2006), Chase acquired the [[Bank of New York Mellon|Bank of New York Co.]]'s retail and small business banking network. This gave Chase access to 338 additional branches and 700,000 new customers in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana.<ref>{{cite web |title=JPMorgan Chase completes acquisition of The Bank of New York's consumer, small-business and middle-market banking businesses |url=https://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=212961 |website=Investor.shareholder.com |accessdate=February 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122224058/https://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=212961 |archive-date=November 22, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==Controversies==

===Purchase of Nazi Germany's Reichsmarks during WWII===
A press release from the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA) in 2004 announced that many of the new [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) files had become declassified. This declassification enabled the discovery that before and during the early years of [[World War II]], the [[Nazi Germany|German government]] sold a special kind of [[Reichsmark]], known as Rückwanderer [returnee] Marks, to American citizens of German descent. Chase National Bank, along with other businesses, were involved in these transactions. Through Chase, this allowed Nazi sympathizers to purchase Marks with [[American dollar|dollars]] at a discounted rate. Specifically, "The financial houses understood that the German government paid the commissions (to its agents, including Chase) through the sale of discounted, blocked Marks that came mainly from [[Jews]] who had fled [[Germany]]." In other words, Nazi Germany was able to offer these Marks below face-value because they had been stolen from [[emigré]]s fleeing the Nazi regime. Between 1936 and 1941, the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] amassed over $20 million, and the businesses enabling these transactions earned $1.2 million in commissions. Of these commissions, over $500,000 went to Chase National Bank and its subagents.

These facts were discovered when the FBI began its investigation in October 1940. The purpose of the investigation was to follow German-Americans who had bought the Marks. However, Chase National Bank's executives were never federally prosecuted because Chase's lead attorney threatened to reveal [[FBI]], [[United States Army|Army]], and [[United States Navy|Navy]] "sources and methods" in court.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Publicly naming the sources and methods could have posed security risks and threatened future [[intelligence gathering]]. To avoid such revelations, the executives' violations of the [[Johnson Act]], the [[Espionage Act]], and the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] were never prosecuted.<ref name="opened">{{cite press release| publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]| title=Thousands of Intelligence Documents Opened under the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act| date=May 13, 2004| accessdate=September 13, 2012| url=https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2004/nr04-55.html}}</ref><ref name="goda">{{cite book| first2=Norman| last2=Goda| first3=Timothy| last3=Naftali| first4=Robert| last4=Wolfe| last1=Breitman| first1=Richard| chapter=Banking on Hitler: Chase National Bank and the Rückwanderer Mark Scheme, 1936–1941| title=U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| date=April 4, 2005| pages=173–202| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnkBYN8ipYcC| isbn=978-0521617949| accessdate=September 13, 2013}}</ref><ref name="hydra">{{cite book| last2=Hawkins| first2=John| title=The Nazi Hydra in America: Suppressed History of a Century| first1=Glen| last1=Yeadon| publisher=Progressive Press| date=June 1, 2008| location=Joshua Tree, California| page=195| accessdate=September 13, 2013| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh7sx2xtjGEC| isbn=9780930852436}}</ref>

===Release of funds for Nazi Germany during WWII===
Besides the controversial Rückwanderer Mark Scheme, NARA records also revealed another controversy during the [[occupation of France]] by the Nazis. From the late 1930s until June 14, 1941, when President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (FDR) issued an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] freezing German assets, Chase National Bank worked with the Nazi government. The order blocking any access to French accounts in the U.S. by anyone, but especially by the Nazis was issued by [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]], with the approval of FDR. Within hours of the order, Chase unblocked the accounts and the funds were transferred through [[South America]] to Nazi Germany.<ref name=hydra />

===Refusal to release funds belonging to Jews in Occupied France===
[[US Treasury]] officials wanted an investigation of French subsidiaries of American banks, such as Chase Bank, [[J.P. Morgan & Co]], [[National City Corporation]], [[Guaranty Trust Company of New York|Guaranty Bank]], [[Bankers Trust]], and [[American Express]]. Of these banks, only Chase and Morgan remained open in France during the [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|Nazi occupation]]. The Chase branch chief in Paris, France, Carlos Niedermann, told his supervisor in New York that there had been an "expansion of deposits". Also, Niedermann was, "very vigorous in enforcing restrictions against Jewish property, even going so far as to refuse to release funds belonging to Jews in anticipation that a decree with [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]] provisions prohibiting such release might be published in the near future by the occupying Nazi authorities".

In 1998, Chase general counsel William McDavid said that Chase did not have control over Niedermann. Whether that claim was true or not, Chase Manhattan Bank acknowledged seizing about 100 accounts during the [[Vichy government|Vichy regime]]. Kenneth McCallion, a partner in the New York firm Goodkind Labaton Rudoff & Sucharow,<ref>Beckett, P., [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB914454880838898000 "Chase Manhattan, J.P. Morgan Are Named in Suit on Holocaust"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', December 24, 1998.</ref> led a lawsuit against [[Barclays Bank]] for the illegal seizure of assets during WWII and has since turned his attention toward Chase. The [[World Jewish Congress]] (WJC), entered into discussions with Chase and a spokesperson for the WJC said, "Nobody at Chase today is guilty. They were not involved in whatever happened, but they do accept that they have an institutional responsibility." A Chase spokesman said, "This is a moral issue that we take very seriously." Chase general counsel McDavid added, "that Chase intends to compensate Jewish account holders whose assets were illegally plundered". In 1999, the French government formed a commission to report findings to [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Lionel Jospin]]. Claire Andrieu, a commission member and history professor at the [[Sorbonne]], said that under the Vichy regime, French banks received visits from Nazi officials but U.S. banks did not. At that time, they did not have to report Jewish accounts, but they did just as the French banks did. She goes on to say that an American [[ambassador]] protected the U.S. subsidiaries.<ref name="siemaszko">{{cite news| last=Siemaszko| first=Corky| title=Chase Banked On Nazis - Report| work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location=New York| via=newsmine.org| date=December 7, 1998| url=http://newsmine.org/content.php?ol=cabal-elite/families/rockefeller/chase-rockefellers-banked-on-nazis.txt| accessdate=September 13, 2013}}</ref><ref name="bbc">{{cite news| title=Barclays to Compensate Jews |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=December 17, 1998| accessdate=September 13, 2013| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/237392.stm}}</ref><ref name="yanowitch">{{cite news| title=World: Europe US banks gave Jewish money to Nazis| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/270849.stm|  date=February 3, 1999 |publisher=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=September 13, 2013}}</ref>

===Recent controversies===
JPMorgan Chase has paid $16 billion in fines, settlements, and other litigation expenses from 2011 to 2013. Of the $16 billion JPMorgan Chase has paid, about $8.5 billion were for fines and settlements resulting from illegal actions taken by bank executives, according to Richard Eskow at the Campaign for America's Future, who cited a new report from Joshua Rosner of Graham Fisher & Co.

The $16 billion total does not include a recent settlement that calls for JPMorgan Chase to pay $100 million to waive $417 million in claims it had made against clients of the firm [[MF Global]].

The [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]]'s [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] found that JPMorgan had illegally aided dictatorships in [[Government of Cuba|Cuba]], [[Government of Sudan|Sudan]], [[Government of Liberia|Liberia]] and [[Government of Iran|Iran]], including transferring 32,000 ounces of [[gold bullion]] (valued at approximately $20,560,000) to the benefit of a bank in Iran. JPMorgan did not voluntarily self-disclose the Iranian matter to [[OFAC]].<ref>[[List of CNBC personalities#Reporters|Javers, E.]], [https://www.cnbc.com/id/44276107 "JPMorgan to Pay $88 Million for Violating US Sanctions"], [[CNBC]], August 25, 2011.</ref>

====Targeted account closures====
During 2013 and 2014, Chase and other banks received media attention for the practice of canceling the personal and business accounts of hundreds of legal [[sex workers]], citing in some instances the "[[Morals clause|morality clause]]" of their account agreement.<ref name=2014Hilton>{{cite web|last=Hilton|first=Perez|title=EXCLUSIVE!

In addition to closing accounts for sex workers, the bank has also been using its "morality clause" to disassociate from other types of businesses.<ref name=2014AVNClosures>{{cite news|last=Kernes|first=Mark|title=JPMorgan Chase Closes Porn Star Accounts, Citing ...

The bank later reversed its decision and invited Gaines to submit an application citing that was already doing business with a "wide variety of merchants, including grocers and drug stores, that sell similar products".<ref name=2014HuffLuvCondom>{{cite news|last=Kingkade|first=Tyler|title=Chase Will Process Payments For Lovability Condoms After All|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/31/chase-condom-payments_n_5051636.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=April 26, 2014|date=March 31, 2014}}</ref>

In 2019 the bank faced growing criticism for its alleged practice of arbitrarily targeting the personal accounts of outspoken online personalities such as Martina Markota and [[Proud Boys]] chairman Enrique Tarrio. Although the specific motives behind the closures were not officially disclosed the assumption among many on the right was that they were political in nature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2019/05/25/jpmorgan-chase-accused-of-purging-accounts-of-conservative-activists/|title=JPMorgan Chase accused of purging accounts of conservative activists|author=John Aiden Byrne|publisher=New York Post|date=2019-05-25|accessdate=2019-05-28}}</ref>

==== Parental leave policy ====
JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $5 million to compensate their male employees who did not receive the same paid parental leave as women from 2011 to 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2019/05/30/dad-reaches-historic-paid-leave-settlement-with-jpmorgan-chase/|title=Dad reaches historic paid leave settlement with JPMorgan Chase|last=Lapin|first=T.|date=2019-05-30|website=[[New York Post]]|language=en|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> In December 2017, the bank "clarified its policy to ensure equal access to men and women looking to be their new child's main caregiver".<ref>Gibson, K., [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pmorgan-chase-to-pay-5-million-to-male-employees-who-say-they-were-unfairly-denied-parental-leave "Dad sued employer JPMorgan Chase over parental leave pay—and won"], [[CBS News]], May 30, 2019.</ref> According to the involved attorneys, this is the biggest recorded settlement in a U.S. parental leave discrimination case.
