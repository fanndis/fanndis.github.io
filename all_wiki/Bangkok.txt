It is known in [[Thai language|Thai]] as '''Krung Thep Maha Nakhon'''{{efn|1={{lang|th|กรุงเทพมหานคร}}, {{IPA-th|krūŋ tʰêːp mahǎː nákʰɔ̄ːn|pron|Th-Krung Thep Maha Nakhon.ogg}}}} or simply '''Krung Thep'''.{{efn|1={{Audio|Th-Krung Thep.ogg|Thai pronunciation}}}} The city occupies {{convert|1568.7|km2}} in the [[Chao Phraya River]] delta in [[central Thailand]] and has an estimated population of 10.539&nbsp;million as of 2020, 15.3 percent of the country's population. Over fourteen million people (22.2 percent) lived within the surrounding [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]] at the 2010 census, making Bangkok an extreme [[primate city]], dwarfing Thailand's other urban centres in both size and importance to the national economy.

Bangkok traces its roots to a small trading post during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] in the 15th century, which eventually grew and became the site of two capital cities: [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] in 1768 and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin]] in 1782. Bangkok was at the heart of the modernization of Siam, later renamed Thailand, during the late-19th century, as the country faced pressures from the West. The city was at the centre of Thailand's political struggles throughout the 20th century, as the country abolished absolute monarchy, adopted constitutional rule, and underwent numerous coups and several uprisings. The city, incorporated as a special administrative area under the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] in 1972, grew rapidly during the 1960s through the 1980s and now exerts a significant impact on Thailand's politics, economy, education, media and modern society.

The [[Tiger Cub Economies|Asian investment boom]] in the 1980s and 1990s led many multinational corporations to locate their regional headquarters in Bangkok. The city is now a regional force in finance and business. It is an international hub for transport and health care, and has emerged as a centre for the arts, fashion, and entertainment. The city is known for its street life and cultural landmarks, as well as its [[red-light district]]s. The [[Grand Palace]] and [[Buddhist temple]]s including [[Wat Arun]] and [[Wat Pho]] stand in contrast with other tourist attractions such as the nightlife scenes of [[Khaosan Road]] and [[Patpong]]. Bangkok is among the world's top tourist destinations, and has been named the world's most visited city consistently in several international rankings.

Bangkok's rapid growth coupled with little [[urban planning]] has resulted in a haphazard cityscape and inadequate infrastructure. Despite an extensive [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]], an inadequate road network and substantial private car usage have led to chronic and crippling [[traffic congestion]], which caused severe air pollution in the 1990s. The city has since turned to public transport in an attempt to solve the problem, operating [[Rapid transit in Bangkok|five rapid transit lines]] and building other public transit, but congestion still remains a prevalent issue. The city faces long-term environmental threats such as land [[subsidence]], which contributes to frequent flooding, an issue expected to be exacerbated by the effects of climate change.

==History==
{{Main|History of Bangkok}}
[[File:La Loubere map of Bangkok (English).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An engraved map titled &quot;A Map of Bancock&quot;, showing a walled settlement on the west of a river, and a fort on the east|Map of 17th-century Bangkok, from [[Simon de la Loubère]]'s ''Du Royaume de Siam'']]

The history of Bangkok dates at least back to the early 15th century, when it was a village on the west bank of the [[Chao Phraya River]], under the rule of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]].<ref name="Tipawan"/> Because of its strategic location near the mouth of the river, the town gradually increased in importance. Bangkok initially served as a customs outpost with forts on both sides of the river, and was the site of [[Siege of Bangkok|a siege in 1688]] in which the French were expelled from Siam. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the [[Konbaung dynasty|Burmese Empire]] in 1767, the newly crowned King [[Taksin]] established his capital at the town, which became the base of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]]. In 1782, King [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]] (Rama I) succeeded Taksin, moved the capital to the eastern bank's [[Rattanakosin Island]], thus founding the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]]. The [[City Pillar]] was erected on 21 April 1782, which is regarded as the date of foundation of the present city.<ref name="200 years"/>

Bangkok's economy gradually expanded through international trade, first with China, then with Western merchants returning in the early-to-mid 19th century. As the capital, Bangkok was the centre of Siam's modernization as it faced pressure from Western powers in the late-19th century. The reigns of Kings [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV, 1851–68) and [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V, 1868–1910) saw the introduction of the steam engine, printing press, rail transport and utilities infrastructure in the city, as well as formal education and healthcare. Bangkok became the centre stage for power struggles between the military and political elite as the country [[Siamese revolution of 1932|abolished absolute monarchy in 1932]].<ref name="History of Thailand" />

[[File:View of the city of Bangkok 1822.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving of the city from British diplomat [[John Crawfurd]]'s embassy in 1822]]
As Thailand allied with Japan [[Thailand in World War II|in World War II]], Bangkok was subjected to [[Bombing of Bangkok in World War II|Allied bombing]], but rapidly grew in the post-war period as a result of US aid and government-sponsored investment. Bangkok's role as a US military [[R&R (military)|R&R]] destination boosted its tourism industry as well as firmly establishing it as a sex tourism destination. Disproportionate urban development led to increasing income inequalities and migration from rural areas into Bangkok; its population surged from 1.8&nbsp;million to 3&nbsp;million in the 1960s.<ref name="History of Thailand" />

Following the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973, Japanese businesses took over as leaders in investment, and the expansion of export-oriented manufacturing led to growth of the financial market in Bangkok.<ref name="History of Thailand">Baker & Pongpaichit 2005, pp. 37–41, 45, 52–71, 149–150, 162, 199–204.</ref> Rapid growth of the city continued through the 1980s and early 1990s, until it was stalled by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. By then, many public and social issues had emerged, among them the strain on infrastructure reflected in the city's notorious traffic jams. Bangkok's role as the nation's political stage continues to be seen in strings of popular protests, from the student uprisings in [[14 October 1973 uprising|1973]] and [[6 October 1976 massacre|1976]], anti-military demonstrations [[Black May (1992)|in 1992]], and [[History of Thailand since 2001|frequent street protests since 2006]], including those by groups opposing and supporting former prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] from 2006 to 2013, and a renewed student-led movement [[2020 Thai protests|in 2020]].<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Beech|first1=Hannah|last2=Suhartono|first2=Muktita|date=2020-10-14|title=As Motorcade Rolls By, Thai Royal Family Glimpses the People's Discontent|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/world/asia/thailand-protests-queen-king.html|access-date=2020-10-15|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Administration of the city was first formalized by King Chulalongkorn in 1906, with the establishment of [[Monthon]] Krung Thep Phra Maha Nakhon ({{lang|th|มณฑลกรุงเทพพระมหานคร}}) as a national subdivision. In 1915, the ''monthon'' was split into several provinces, the administrative boundaries of which have since further changed. The city in its current form was created in 1972 with the formation of the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] (BMA), following the merger of Phra Nakhon Province on the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya and Thonburi Province on the west during the previous year.<ref name="200 years"/>

==Name==
The origin of the name ''Bangkok'' ({{lang|th|บางกอก}}, pronounced in Thai as {{IPA-th|bāːŋ kɔ̀ːk||Th-Bangkok.ogg}}), is unclear. ''Bang'' is a Thai word meaning 'a village on a stream',<ref>{{cite web|script-title=th:พจนานุกรม ฉบับราชบัณฑิตยสถาน พ.ศ. ๒๕๔๒ |trans-title=Royal Institute Dictionary, B.E. 1999 (online edition)|url=http://rirs3.royin.go.th/word24/word-24-a3.asp |publisher=Royal Institute |language=Thai |accessdate=12 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112051933/http://rirs3.royin.go.th/word24/word-24-a3.asp |archivedate=12 November 2013 }}</ref> and the name might have been derived from ''Bang Ko'' ({{lang|th|บางเกาะ}}), ''ko'' meaning 'island', stemming from the city's watery landscape.<ref name="Tipawan">{{cite web|last1=Chandrashtitya|first1=Tipawan|script-title=th:ประวัติเมืองธนบุรี |trans-title=History of Thonburi City|url=http://dit.dru.ac.th/home/012/attractions_history.html|website=Arts & Cultural Office|publisher=Dhonburi Rajabhat University|accessdate=11 December 2011|first2=Chiraporn |last2=Matungka|language=Thai |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713001017/http://dit.dru.ac.th/home/012/attractions_history.html|archivedate=13 July 2010}}</ref> Another theory suggests that it is shortened from ''Bang Makok'' ({{lang|th|บางมะกอก}}), ''makok'' being the name of ''[[Elaeocarpus hygrophilus]]'', a plant bearing olive-like fruit.{{efn|Two plants are known in Thai by the name ''makok'': ''E. hygrophilus'' (''makok nam'', 'water ''makok''{{'}}) and ''[[Spondias pinnata]]'' (''makok pa'', 'jungle ''makok''{{'}}). The species that grew in the area was likely ''makok nam''.}} This is supported by the former name of [[Wat Arun]], a historic temple in the area, that used to be called ''Wat Makok''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Sujit |last=Wongthes |authorlink=Sujit Wongthes|script-title=th:กรุงเทพฯ มาจากไหน? |trans-title=Bangkok: A Historical Background |isbn=9786167686004 |year=2012 |publisher=Dream Catcher |location=Bangkok |url=http://www.sujitwongthes.com/2012/03/nonfiction2555-1/ |language=Thai  |access-date=9 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217125517/http://www.sujitwongthes.com/2012/03/nonfiction2555-1/ |archive-date=17 December 2014 |url-status = dead|page=37}}</ref>

Officially, the town was known as ''Thonburi Si Mahasamut'' ({{lang|th|ธนบุรีศรีมหาสมุทร}}, from [[Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]], literally 'city of treasures gracing the ocean') or ''Thonburi'', according to the ''[[Ayutthaya Chronicles]]''.<ref name="Wang Derm-Thonburi">{{cite web|script-title=th:สาระน่ารู้กรุงธนบุรี |trans-title=Interesting facts about the city of Thonburi |url=http://www.wangdermpalace.org/thonburi/index_thai.html |website=Phra Racha Wang Derm|publisher=Phra Racha Wang Derm Restoration Foundation |accessdate=11 December 2011 |language=Thai |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302033915/http://www.wangdermpalace.org/thonburi/index_thai.html |archivedate=2 March 2012 }}</ref> ''Bangkok'' was likely a colloquial name, albeit one widely adopted by foreign visitors, who continued to use it to refer to the city even after the new capital's establishment.

When King Rama I established his new capital on the river's eastern bank, the city inherited Ayutthaya's ceremonial name, of which there were many variants, including ''Krung Thep Thawarawadi Si Ayutthaya'' ({{lang|th|กรุงเทพทวารวดีศรีอยุธยา}}) and ''Krung Thep Maha Nakhon Si Ayutthaya'' ({{lang|th|กรุงเทพมหานครศรีอยุธยา}}).<ref name="Chanchai">{{cite journal|last=Phakathikhom |first=Chanchai |script-title=th:นามพระนคร "ศรีอยุธยา" มาแต่ไหน |journal=Senathipat |year=2005 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=114–123 |url=http://cdsd-rta.net/images/stories/valasan/valsan%20y54%20b3%20year2548/155403.pdf |accessdate=31 July 2013 |trans-title=What were the origins of the capital name "Si Ayutthaya"? |language=Thai |issn=0857-3891 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]], visiting the city as envoy of the United States in 1833, noted that the city, since becoming capital, was known as ''Sia-Yut'hia'', and this is the name used in international treaties of the period.<ref name="Roberts">{{cite book

Today, the city is known in Thai as ''Krung Thep Maha Nakhon'' (กรุงเทพมหานคร) or simply ''Krung Thep'' (กรุงเทพฯ), a shortening of the ceremonial name which came into use during the reign of King Mongkut. The full name reads as follows:{{efn|While this ceremonial name is generally believed, based on writings by the Somdet Phra Wannarat (Kaeo), to have originally been given by King Rama I and later modified by King Mongkut, it did not come into use until the latter reign.<ref name="Chanchai"/>}}<ref name="200 years">{{cite book|last=Committee for the Rattanakosin Bicentennial Celebration|title=จดหมายเหตุการอนุรักษ์กรุงรัตนโกสินทร์ |trans-title=Rattanakosin City conservation archives|publisher=Department of Fine Arts|year=1982}} Reproduced in {{cite web|title=กว่าจะมาเป็นกรุงเทพฯ |trans-title=The path to become Bangkok |url=http://203.155.220.230/info/passbkk/frame.asp |publisher=BMA Data Center |accessdate=1 August 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219220002/http://203.155.220.230/info/passbkk/frame.asp |archivedate=19 December 2014 }}</ref>

The city is now officially known in Thai by a shortened form of the full ceremonial name, ''Krung Thep Maha Nakhon'', which is colloquially further shortened to ''Krung Thep''. (''[[wikt:กรุง|Krung]]'' is a Thai word of [[Khmer language|Khmer]] origin, meaning 'capital',<ref>{{Cite book|last=Askew|first=Marc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bt6FAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA18|title=Bangkok: Place, Practice and Representation|date=2004-08-02|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-65986-9|language=en}}</ref> while ''[[wikt:เทพ|thep]]'' is from Pali/Sanskrit, meaning 'deity' or 'god' and corresponding to ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]''.) Bangkok is the city's official English name, as reflected in the name of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration.

The city of Bangkok is locally governed by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA). Although its boundaries are at the provincial (''[[changwat]]'') level, unlike the other 76 provinces Bangkok is a special administrative area whose governor is directly elected to serve a four-year term. The governor, together with four appointed deputies, form the executive body, who implement policies through the BMA civil service headed by the Permanent Secretary for the BMA. In separate elections, each district elects one or more city councillors, who form the Bangkok Metropolitan Council. The council is the BMA's legislative body, and has power over municipal ordinances and the city's budget.<ref>Thavisin et al. (eds) 2006, p.&nbsp;86.</ref> However, after the [[2014 Thai coup d'état|coup of 2014]] all local elections have been cancelled and the council was appointed by the government on 15 September 2014. The current Bangkok Governor is Police General [[Aswin Kwanmuang]], who was appointed by the military government on 26 October 2016<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Royal Gazette|volume=133|issue=พิเศษ 238 ง|pages=9–10|script-title=th:คำสั่งหัวหน้าคณะรักษาความสงบแห่งชาติ ที่ ๖๔/๒๕๕๙ เรื่อง การให้ผู้ว่าราชการกรุงเทพมหานครพ้นจากตำแหน่ง และการแต่งตั้งผู้ว่าราชการกรุงเทพมหานคร|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2559/E/238/9.PDF|date=2016-10-18|language=Thai}}</ref> following the suspension of the last elected governor M.R. [[Sukhumbhand Paribatra]].

Bangkok is divided into [[Districts of Bangkok|fifty districts]] (''khet'', equivalent to ''[[amphoe]]'' in the other provinces), which are further subdivided into 180 sub-districts (''khwaeng'', equivalent to ''[[tambon]]''). Each district is managed by a district director appointed by the governor. District councils, elected to four-year terms, serve as advisory bodies to their respective district directors.

The BMA is divided into sixteen departments, each overseeing different aspects of the administration's responsibilities. Most of these responsibilities concern the city's infrastructure, and include city planning, building control, transportation, drainage, waste management and city beautification, as well as education, medical and rescue services.<ref>Thavisin et al. (eds) 2006, pp.&nbsp;80–82.</ref> Many of these services are provided jointly with other agencies. The BMA has the authority to implement local ordinances, although civil law enforcement falls under the jurisdiction of the [[Metropolitan Police Bureau (Thailand)|Metropolitan Police Bureau]].

The seal of the city shows [[Hindu]] god [[Indra]] riding in the clouds on [[Airavata]], a divine [[white elephant]] known in Thai as Erawan. In his hand Indra holds his weapon, the ''[[vajra]]''.<ref>Thavisin et al. (eds) 2006, p.&nbsp;78.</ref> The seal is based on a painting done by [[Prince Naris]].

As the capital of Thailand, Bangkok is the seat of all branches of the [[Government of Thailand|national government]]. The [[Government House (Thailand)|Government House]], [[Parliament House (Thailand)|Parliament House]] and [[Supreme Court of Thailand|Supreme]], [[Administrative Court of Thailand|Administrative]] and [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional]] Courts are all in the city. Bangkok is the site of the [[Grand Palace]] and [[Dusit Palace]], respectively the official and ''de facto'' residence of the king. Most government ministries also have headquarters and offices in the capital.

===Calls to move the capital===

Bangkok is faced with multiple problems—including congestion (see ({{Section link||Transport}} below), and especially subsidence and flooding (see {{Section link||Geography}})—which have raised the issue of moving the nation's capital elsewhere. The idea is not new: during World War II Prime Minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] planned unsuccessfully to relocate the capital to [[Phetchabun]]. In the 2000s, the [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] administration assigned the [[Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council]] (NESDC) to formulate a plan to move the capital to [[Nakhon Nayok Province]]. The [[2011 Thailand floods|2011 floods]] revived the idea of moving government functions from Bangkok. In 2017, the military government assigned NESDC to study the possibility of moving government offices from Bangkok to [[Chachoengsao Province]] in the east.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rossman |first1=Vadim |title=Capital Cities: Varieties and Patterns of Development and Relocation |date=2018 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=9781317562856 |pages=103–4}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Lamb |first1=Kate |title=Thailand PM considers moving capital as Bangkok congestion takes toll |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/30/thailand-pm-considers-moving-capital-as-bangkok-congestion-takes-toll |accessdate=30 September 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=30 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Katharangsiporn |first1=Kanana |last2=Theparat |first2=Chatrudee |title=A capital idea |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1761309/a-capital-idea |accessdate=30 September 2019 |work=Bangkok Post |date=30 September 2019}}</ref>

===Topography===
Bangkok is in the Chao Phraya River delta in Thailand's [[Central Thailand|central plain]]. The river meanders through the city in a southerly direction, emptying into the [[Gulf of Thailand]] approximately {{convert|25|km}} south of city centre. The area is flat and low-lying, with an average elevation of {{convert|1.5|m}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].<ref name="Sinsakul">{{cite journal|last=Sinsakul|first=Sin|title=Late Quaternary geology of the Lower Central Plain, Thailand|journal=Journal of Asian Earth Sciences|date=August 2000|volume=18|issue=4|pages=415–426|doi=10.1016/S1367-9120(99)00075-9 |bibcode=2000JAESc..18..415S}}</ref>{{efn|The BMA gives an elevation figure of {{convert|2.31|m}}.<ref name="BMA geo"/>}} Most of the area was originally [[swampland]], which was gradually drained and irrigated for agriculture by the construction of canals (''[[khlong]]'') which took place from the 16th to 19th centuries. The course of the river as it flows through Bangkok has been modified by the construction of [[Chao Phraya River#River engineering|several shortcut canals]].

[[File:Chaophrayashortcut.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bangkok's major canals are shown in this map detailing the original course of the river and its shortcut canals.]]

The city's waterway network served as the primary means of transport until the late 19th century, when modern roads began to be built. Up until then, most people lived near or on the water, leading the city to be known during the 19th century as the "[[Venice]] of the East".<ref>{{cite book|first=H. Warrington |last=Smyth|title=Five years in Siam: from 1891 to 1896|year=1898|place=New York|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|volume=II|page=9}} Quoted in Baker & Phongpaichit 2005, p.&nbsp;90.</ref> Many of these canals have since been filled in or paved over, but others still criss-cross the city, serving as major drainage channels and transport routes. Most canals are now badly polluted, although the BMA has committed to the treatment and cleaning up of several canals.<ref>Thavisin et al. (eds) 2006, p.&nbsp;35.</ref>

The geology of the Bangkok area is characterized by a top layer of soft [[marine clay]], known as "Bangkok clay", averaging {{convert|15|m}} in thickness, which overlies an [[aquifer]] system consisting of eight known units. This feature has contributed to the effects of [[subsidence]] caused by extensive ground water pumping. First recognized in the 1970s, subsidence soon became a critical issue, reaching a rate of {{convert|120|mm}} per year in 1981. Ground water management and mitigation measures have since lessened the severity of the situation, although subsidence is still occurring at a rate of {{convert|10|to|30|mm}} per year, and parts of the city are now {{convert|1|m}} below sea level.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Phien-wej |first1=N. |first2=P.H. |last2=Giao |first3=P |last3=Nutalaya |title=Land subsidence in Bangkok, Thailand|journal=Engineering Geology|date=2 February 2006 |volume=82|issue=4|pages=187–201|doi=10.1016/j.enggeo.2005.10.004}}</ref> There are fears that the city may be submerged by 2030.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/TECH/science/10/22/thailand.water.rising.ap/index.html |title=Rising seas, sinking land threaten Thai capital |website=CNN International|accessdate=24 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030034936/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/TECH/science/10/22/thailand.water.rising.ap/index.html|archivedate=30 October 2007|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2084358,00.html|title=Thailand, Sinking: Parts of Bangkok Could Be Underwater in 2030|first=Bruno|last= Philip| work=Time|date=21 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Sattaburuth|first1=Aekarach|title=Bangkok 'could be submerged in 15 years'|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/learning-news/632520/bangkok-could-be-submerged-in-15-years|accessdate=23 January 2017|work=Bangkok Post|date=2015-07-23}}</ref> A study published in October 2019 in ''[[Nature Communications]]'' corrected earlier models of coastal elevations<ref>{{cite book |title=Climate Risks and Adaptation in Asian Coastal Megacities |date=September 2010 |publisher=The World Bank |location=Washington DC |pages=23–31 |chapter-url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/Resources/226300-1287600424406/coastal_megacities_fullreport.pdf |accessdate=1 November 2019 |chapter=3.

There are no mountains in Bangkok. The closest mountain range is the [[Khao Khiao Massif]], about {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast of the city. Phu Khao Thong, the only hill in the metropolitan area, originated with a very large [[stupa|chedi]] that King [[Rama III]] (1787–1851) built at Wat Saket. The chedi collapsed during construction because the soft soil could not support its weight. Over the next few decades, the abandoned mud-and-brick structure acquired the shape of a natural hill and became overgrown with weeds. The locals called it ''phu khao'' ({{lang|th|ภูเขา}}), as if it were a natural feature.<ref>[http://dlxs.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=sea;cc=sea;sid=fd258f1374ff0bf467cbfbf937e68f4e;rgn=full%20text;idno=sea141;view=image;seq=14 Old photo (around 1900) of dilapidated prang from the collection of Cornell University Library] (last access 2009-09-24).</ref> In the 1940s, enclosing concrete walls were added to stop the hill from eroding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/11129/Temple-of-the-Golden-Mount-or-Phu-Khao-Thong-%E0%B8%A0%E0%B8%B9%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87|title=Phu Khao Thong (Golden Mount)|website=wikimapia.org}}</ref>

===Climate===
Like most of Thailand, Bangkok has a [[tropical savanna climate]] (Aw) under the [[Köppen climate classification]] and is under the influence of the [[South Asian monsoon]] system. It experiences three seasons: hot, rainy, and cool, although temperatures are fairly hot year-round, ranging from an average low of {{convert|22.0|C}} in December to an average high of {{convert|35.4|C}} in April. The rainy season begins with the arrival of the southwest monsoon around mid-May. September is the wettest month, with an average rainfall of {{convert|334.3|mm}}. The rainy season lasts until October, when the dry and cool northeast monsoon takes over until February. The hot season is generally dry, but also sees occasional summer storms.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Climate of Thailand |url=http://www.tmd.go.th/en/archive/thailand_climate.pdf |last=Climatological Group, Meteorological Development Bureau |publisher=Thai Meteorological Department |date=January 2012 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> The surface magnitude of Bangkok's [[urban heat island]] has been measured at {{convert|2.5|C-change|sigfig=2}} during the day and {{convert|8.0|C-change|sigfig=2}} at night.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Assessment with satellite data of the urban heat island effects in Asian mega cities |first1=Hung |last1=Tran |first2=Daisuke |last2=Uchihama |first3=Shiro |last3=Ochi |first4=Yoshifumi |last4=Yasuoka|journal=International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation |volume=8|issue=1|date=January 2006 |pages=34–48 |doi=10.1016/j.jag.2005.05.003 |bibcode=2006IJAEO...8...34T }}</ref> The highest recorded temperature of Bangkok metropolis was {{convert|40.1|C}} in March 2013,<ref name="BP-20180715">{{cite news |last1=Wangkiat |first1=Paritta |title=Strong Cities Needed |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/special-reports/1503802/strong-cities-needed |accessdate=16 July 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=15 July 2018 |format=in Spectrum}}</ref> and the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|9.9|C}} in January 1955.<ref>{{cite web|title=Extreme minimum temperature during winter season in Thailand 60-year period (1951–2010)|url=http://www.tmd.go.th/programs/uploads/tempstat/min_stat_latest_en.pdf|website=TMD website|author=Thai Meteorological Department}}</ref>

Bangkok's districts often do not accurately represent the functional divisions of its neighbourhoods or land usage. Although [[urban planning]] policies date back to the commission of the "Litchfield Plan" in 1960, which set out strategies for land use, transportation and general infrastructure improvements, zoning regulations were not fully implemented until 1992. As a result, the city grew organically throughout the period of its rapid expansion, both horizontally as [[ribbon development]]s extended along newly built roads, and vertically, with increasing numbers of high rises and skyscrapers being built in commercial areas.<ref>{{cite book|first=Medhi |last=Krongkaew |chapter=The changing urban system in a fast-growing city and economy: The case of Bangkok and Thailand |editor1-first=Fu-chen |editor1-last=Lo |editor2-first=Yue-man |editor2-last=Yeung |title=Emerging World Cities in Pacific Asia |publisher=United Nations University Press |year=1996|isbn=978-92-808-0907-7|page=322}}</ref> The city has grown from its original centre along the river into a sprawling metropolis surrounded by swaths of suburban residential development extending north and south into neighbouring provinces. The highly populated and growing cities of [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]], [[Pak Kret]], [[Rangsit (city)|Rangsit]] and [[Mueang Samut Prakan District|Samut Prakan]] are effectively now suburbs of Bangkok. Nevertheless, large agricultural areas remain within the city proper at its eastern and western fringes. Land use in the city consists of 23 percent residential use, 24 percent agriculture, and 30 percent used for commerce, industry, and government.<ref name="BMA geo"/> The BMA's City Planning Department (CPD) is responsible for planning and shaping further development. It published master plan updates in 1999 and 2006, and a third revision is undergoing public hearings in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokplan.org/website/index.php?option=com_wrapper&view=wrapper&Itemid=54&lang=en |title=History |website=CPD |publisher=City Planning Department|accessdate=25 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101120642/http://www.bangkokplan.org/website/index.php?option=com_wrapper&view=wrapper&Itemid=54&lang=en |archivedate=1 January 2013 }}</ref>

[[File:พระบรมรูปทรงม้า เขตดุสิต กรุงเทพมหานคร (22) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large plaza with a bronze statue of a man riding on horseback; beyond the plaza is a large two-storey building with a domed roof, arched windows and columns |The [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] in Dusit District was inspired by King Chulalongkorn's visits to Europe.]]

Bangkok's historic centre remains the [[Rattanakosin Island]] in Phra Nakhon District. It is the site of the Grand Palace and the City Pillar Shrine, primary symbols of the city's founding, as well as important Buddhist temples. Phra Nakhon, along with the neighbouring Pom Prap Sattru Phai and Samphanthawong Districts, formed what was the city proper in the late 19th century. Many traditional neighbourhoods and markets are found here, including the Chinese settlement of Sampheng. The city was expanded toward Dusit District in the early 19th century, following King Chulalongkorn's relocation of the royal household to the new [[Dusit Palace]]. The buildings of the palace, including the neoclassical [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]], as well as the [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] and [[Ratchadamnoen Avenue]] which leads to it from the Grand Palace, reflect the heavy influence of European architecture at the time. Major government offices line the avenue, as does the [[Democracy Monument]]. The area is the site of the country's seat of power as well as the city's most popular tourist landmarks.

[[File:View from Baiyoke Sky Hotel, Bangkok (7053110333) cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=A lot of high-rise buildings|The [[Sukhumvit Road|Sukhumvit]] area appears as a sea of high-rise buildings from [[Baiyoke Tower II]], the third-tallest building in Bangkok.]]

In contrast with the low-rise historic areas, the business district on [[Si Lom Road|Si Lom]] and [[Sathon Road|Sathon]] Roads in Bang Rak and Sathon Districts teems with skyscrapers. It is the site of many of the country's major corporate headquarters, but also of some of the city's [[red-light district]]s. The [[Siam area|Siam]] and [[Ratchaprasong]] areas in Pathum Wan are home to some of the largest shopping malls in [[Southeast Asia]]. Numerous retail outlets and hotels also stretch along [[Sukhumvit Road]] leading southeast through Watthana and Khlong Toei Districts. More office towers line the streets branching off Sukhumvit, especially [[Asok Montri Road|Asok Montri]], while upmarket housing is found in many of its [[soi|''soi''s]] ('alley' or 'lane').

Bangkok lacks a single distinct [[central business district]]. Instead, the areas of Siam and Ratchaprasong serve as a "central shopping district" containing many of the bigger malls and commercial areas in the city, as well as [[Siam Station]], the only transfer point between the city's two elevated train lines.<ref name="McGrath CSD">{{cite book |last1=McGrath |first1= Brian |editor1-last= Benites |editor1-first= Cecilia |editor2-last= Lyster |editor2-first= Clare |title= Regarding Public Space |date=2005 |publisher= Princeton Architectural Press |location= New York|isbn= 9781568985442 |pages=46–53 |chapter= Bangkok's CSD}}</ref> The [[Victory Monument (Bangkok)|Victory Monument]] in Ratchathewi District is among its most important road junctions, serving over 100 bus lines as well as an elevated train station. From the monument, [[Phahonyothin Road|Phahonyothin]] and [[Ratchawithi Road|Ratchawithi]]&nbsp;/ Din Daeng Roads respectively run north and east linking to major residential areas. Most of the high-density development areas are within the {{convert|113|km2|adj=on}} area encircled by the [[Ratchadaphisek Road|Ratchadaphisek]] inner ring road. Ratchadaphisek is lined with businesses and retail outlets, and office buildings also cluster around Ratchayothin Intersection in Chatuchak District to the north. Farther from the city centre, most areas are primarily mid- or low-density residential. The Thonburi side of the city is less developed, with fewer high rises. With the exception of a few secondary urban centres, Thonburi, in the same manner as the outlying eastern districts, consists mostly of residential and rural areas.

While most of Bangkok's streets are fronted by vernacular [[shophouse]]s, the largely unrestricted building euphoria of the 1980s has transformed the city into an urban area of skyscrapers and high rises of contrasting and clashing styles.<ref>Hamilton 2000, pp.&nbsp;465–466.</ref> There are 581 skyscrapers over {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} tall in the city.

Following its establishment as capital city in 1782, Bangkok grew only slightly throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries. British diplomat [[John Crawfurd]], visiting in 1822, estimated its population at no more than 50,000.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Crawfurd|title=Journal of an embassy from the governor-general of India to the courts of Siam and Cochin China; exhibiting a view of the actual state of those kingdoms |year=1830|volume=2|place=London|publisher=H.

This growth became even more pronounced in the 1930s, following the discovery of antibiotics. Although family planning and birth control were introduced in the 1960s, the lowered birth rate was more than offset by increased migration from the provinces as economic expansion accelerated. Only in the 1990s have Bangkok's population growth rates decreased, following the national rate. Thailand had long since become highly centralized around the capital. In 1980, Bangkok's population was fifty-one times that of [[Hat Yai]] and [[Songkhla]], the second-largest urban centre, making it the world's most prominent [[primate city]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=The growth of the population of the world's pre-eminent "primate city": Bangkok at its bicentenary|first=Larry|last=Sternstein|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume=15|issue=1|doi=10.1017/S0022463400012200 |pmid=12266027|date=March 1984|pages=43–68}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fong|first1=Jack|title=Political Vulnerabilities of a Primate City: The May 2010 Red Shirts Uprising in Bangkok, Thailand.|journal=Journal of Asian and African Studies|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270425419|date=May 2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=332–347|url-access=subscription |doi=10.1177/0021909612453981|s2cid=145515713}}</ref>

The majority (91 percent) of the city's population is Buddhist. Other religions include Islam (4.7 percent), Christianity (2 percent), Hinduism (0.5 percent), Sikhism (0.1 percent) and Confucianism (0.1 percent).<ref name="2010 census 4">{{cite web|title=Table 4 Population by religion, region and area: 2010 |url=http://service.nso.go.th/nso/nso_center/project/table/files/C-pop/2553/000/00_C-pop_2553_000_010000_00400.xls |publisher=National Statistics Office|website=National Statistical Office|accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref>

Apart from Yaowarat, Bangkok also has several other distinct ethnic neighbourhoods. The Indian community is centred in [[Phahurat]], where the Gurdwara Siri Guru Singh Sabha, founded in 1933, is located. [[Ban Khrua]] on Saen Saep Canal is home to descendants of the [[Cham people|Cham]] who settled in the late 18th century. Although the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] who settled during the Thonburi period have ceased to exist as a distinct community, their past is reflected in [[Santa Cruz Church (Bangkok)|Santa Cruz Church]], on the west bank of the river. Likewise, [[Assumption Cathedral, Bangkok|Assumption Cathedral]] on Charoen Krung Road is among many European-style buildings in the Old [[Farang]] Quarter, where European diplomats and merchants lived in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Nearby, the Haroon Mosque is the centre of a Muslim community. Newer expatriate communities exist along Sukhumvit Road, including the Japanese community near Soi Phrom Phong and Soi [[Thong Lo]], and the Arab and North African neighbourhood along Soi Nana. Sukhumvit Plaza, a mall on Soi Sukhumvit 12, is popularly known as Korea Town.

==Economy==

Bangkok is the [[Economy of Thailand|economic centre of Thailand]], and the heart of the country's investment and development. In 2010, the city had an economic output of 3.142&nbsp;trillion [[baht]] (US$98.34&nbsp;billion), contributing 29.1 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). This amounted to a per-capita GDP value of 456,911 [[Thai baht|baht]] ($14,301), almost three times the national average of 160,556 baht ($5,025). The Bangkok Metropolitan Region had a combined output of 4.773&nbsp;trillion baht ($149.39&nbsp;billion), or 44.2 percent of GDP.<ref>NESDB 2012, pp.&nbsp;26, 39–40, 48–49, 62–63, 218–219.</ref> Bangkok's economy ranked as the sixth among Asian cities in terms of per-capita GDP, after Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Osaka–Kobe and Seoul, as of 2010.<ref>Naudin (ed.) 2010, p.&nbsp;85.</ref>{{Update inline|date=November 2020}}

Wholesale and retail trade is the largest sector in the city's economy, contributing 24 percent of Bangkok's gross provincial product. It is followed by manufacturing (14.3 percent); real estate, renting and business activities (12.4 percent); transport and communications (11.6 percent); and financial intermediation (11.1 percent). Bangkok alone accounts for 48.4 percent of Thailand's service sector, which in turn constitutes 49 percent of GDP. When the Bangkok Metropolitan Region is considered, manufacturing is the most significant contributor at 28.2 percent of the gross regional product, reflecting the density of industry in the Bangkok's neighbouring provinces.<ref>NESDB 2012, pp.48–49, 62–63, 218–219.</ref> [[Automotive industry in Thailand|The automotive industry]] based around Greater Bangkok is the largest production hub in Southeast Asia.<ref>Naudin (ed.) 2010, p.&nbsp;83.</ref> Tourism is also a significant contributor to Bangkok's economy, generating 427.5&nbsp;billion baht ($13.38&nbsp;billion) in revenue in 2010.<ref name="internal tourism"/>

The [[Stock Exchange of Thailand]] (SET) is on Ratchadaphisek Road in inner Bangkok. The SET, together with the Market for Alternative Investment (MAI) has 648 listed companies as of the end of 2011, with a combined market capitalization of 8.485&nbsp;trillion baht ($267.64&nbsp;billion).<ref>Stock Exchange of Thailand 2012, pp.&nbsp;22, 25.</ref> Due to the large amount of foreign representation, Thailand has for several years been a mainstay of the Southeast Asian economy and a centre of Asian business.

Bangkok is home to the headquarters of all of Thailand's major commercial banks and financial institutions, as well as the country's largest companies. Many multinational corporations base their regional headquarters in Bangkok due to the lower cost of labour and operations relative to other major Asian business centres. Seventeen Thai companies are listed on the [[Forbes 2000]], all of which are based in the capital,<ref>{{cite web|title=The World's Biggest Public Companies |url=https://www.forbes.com/global2000/ |date=April 2012|accessdate=25 September 2012|website=Forbes.com|publisher=Forbes.com LLC}}</ref> including [[PTT Public Company Limited|PTT]], the only [[Fortune Global 500]] company in Thailand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fortune's annual ranking of the world's largest corporations|url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2012/full_list/index.html |date=July 2012 |accessdate=23 July 2012|website=CNN}}</ref>

Income inequality is a major issue in Bangkok, especially between relatively unskilled lower-income immigrants from rural provinces and neighbouring countries, and middle-class professionals and business elites. Although absolute poverty rates are low—only 0.64 percent of Bangkok's registered residents were living under the poverty line in 2010, compared to a national average of 7.75 percent—economic disparity is still substantial.<ref>{{cite web |title=ตารางที่ 1.2 สัดส่วนคนจนด้านรายจ่าย จำแนกตามภาคและพื้นที่ ปี พ.ศ. 2531–2553 (Poverty rates by expenses, sorted by region and area, 1988–2010) |url=http://social.nesdb.go.th/SocialStat/StatReport_Final.aspx?reportid=299&template=2R1C&yeartype=M&subcatid=31 |language=Thai |publisher=Office of the National Economic and Social Development Board |date=26 September 2011 |accessdate=25 September 2012 |website=Social and Quality of Life Database System |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904061248/http://social.nesdb.go.th/SocialStat/StatReport_Final.aspx?reportid=299&template=2R1C&yeartype=M&subcatid=31 |archive-date=4 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The city has a [[Gini coefficient]] of 0.48, indicating a high level of inequality.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Eduardo López |last1=Moreno |first2=Oyebanji |last2=Oyeyinka |first3=Gora |last3=Mboup |title=State of the World's Cities 2010/2011 – Cities for All: Bridging the Urban Divide |series=State of the World's Cities |publisher=Earthscan |place=London, Sterling, VA |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84971-176-0 |accessdate=25 September 2012 |url=http://www.unhabitat.org/pmss/getElectronicVersion.aspx?nr=2917&alt=1|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523102723/http://www.unhabitat.org/pmss/getElectronicVersion.aspx?nr=2917&alt=1 |archivedate=23 May 2012 |page=194}}</ref>

Bangkok is one of the world's top tourist destinations.

As the main gateway through which visitors arrive in Thailand, Bangkok is visited by the majority of international tourists to the country. Domestic tourism is also prominent. The Department of Tourism recorded 26,861,095 Thai and 11,361,808 foreign visitors to Bangkok in 2010. Lodgings were made by 15,031,244 guests, who occupied 49.9 percent of the city's 86,687 hotel rooms.<ref name="internal tourism">{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.go.th/2010/upload/filecenter/file/stat_2554/Sep/Update53%20on%206sep/bangkok.pdf |title=Internal tourism in Bangkok |publisher=Department of Tourism |accessdate=22 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207064853/http://www.tourism.go.th/2010/upload/filecenter/file/stat_2554/Sep/Update53%20on%206sep/bangkok.pdf |archivedate=7 December 2013 }}</ref> Bangkok also topped the list as the world's most popular tourist destinations in 2017 rankings.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandratalty/2017/09/26/bangkok-named-most-popular-city-for-international-tourists-in-2017/#6fc3021725a2|title=Bangkok Named Most Popular City For International Tourists in 2017|date=26 September 2017|accessdate=2 October 2017|author=Talty, Alexandra |magazine=Forbes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://qz.com/1086848/bangkok-london-and-paris-are-the-most-popular-tourist-destinations-in-the-world/|title=The overwhelming majority of popular tourist destinations are in Asia|author=Hao, Karen |date=26 September 2017|accessdate=2 October 2017|work=Quartz}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/most-popular-cities-international-travel-2017-mastercard/index.html|publisher=CNN Travel ([[Cable News Network]])|title=10 most popular cities for international travelers in 2017|author=Hunter, Marnie |date=26 September 2017|accessdate=2 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-06-03/the-10-most-visited-cities-of-2015-london-bangkok-new-york|title=The ten most visited cites of 2017|author=Morton, Caitlin |website=Conde Nast Traveler|date=26 September 2017|accessdate=2 October 2017}}</ref>

Bangkok's multi-faceted sights, attractions and city life appeal to diverse groups of tourists. Royal palaces and temples as well as several museums constitute its major historical and cultural tourist attractions. Shopping and dining experiences offer a wide range of choices and prices. The city is also famous for its dynamic nightlife. Although Bangkok's [[sex tourism]] scene is well known to foreigners, it is usually not openly acknowledged by locals or the government.

[[File:2016 Bangkok, Dystrykt Phra Nakhon, Ulica Khaosan (08).jpg|thumb|left|alt=|[[Khao San Road]] is lined by budget accommodation, shops and bars catering to tourists.]]
Among Bangkok's well-known sights are the Grand Palace and major Buddhist temples, including [[Wat Phra Kaew]], [[Wat Pho]], and [[Wat Arun]]. The [[Giant Swing]] and [[Erawan Shrine]] demonstrate Hinduism's deep-rooted influence in Thai culture. [[Vimanmek Mansion]] in Dusit Palace is famous as the world's largest teak building, while the [[Jim Thompson House]] provides an example of traditional [[Thai architecture]]. Other major museums include the [[Bangkok National Museum]] and the [[Royal Barge National Museum]]. Cruises and boat trips on the Chao Phraya and Thonburi's canals offer views of some of the city's traditional architecture and ways of life on the waterfront.<ref>Thavisin et al. (eds) 2006, pp.&nbsp;63–69.</ref>

Shopping venues, many of which are popular with both tourists and locals, range from the shopping centres and department stores concentrated in Siam and Ratchaprasong to the sprawling [[Chatuchak Weekend Market]]. [[Taling Chan Floating Market]] is among the few such markets in Bangkok. Yaowarat is known for its shops as well as street-side food stalls and restaurants, which are also found throughout the city. [[Khao San Road]] has long been famous as a destination for [[backpacker tourism]], with its budget accommodation, shops and bars attracting visitors from all over the world.

Bangkok has a reputation overseas as a major destination in the sex industry. Although [[Prostitution in Thailand|prostitution is technically illegal]] and is rarely openly discussed in Thailand, it commonly takes place among massage parlours, saunas and hourly hotels, serving foreign tourists as well as locals. Bangkok has acquired the nickname "Sin City of Asia" for its level of sex tourism.<ref name="EmmonsEveland2011">{{cite book|last1=Emmons|first1=Ron|last2=Eveland|first2=Jennifer|last3=White|first3=Daniel|title=Frommer's Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OnMMOZhn54C&pg=PA79|accessdate=8 April 2012|date=28 June 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-00979-6|page=79}}</ref>

Issues often encountered by foreign tourists include scams, overcharging and dual pricing. In a survey of 616 tourists visiting Thailand, 7.79 percent reported encountering a scam, the most common of which was the [[gem scam]], in which tourists are tricked into buying overpriced jewellery.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Robert W. |last=Howard|title=Risky business?

==Culture==
[[File:Bangkok Art Biennale 2018 03.jpg|thumb|Temporary art display at [[Siam Discovery]] during the [[Bangkok Art Biennale]] 2018]]

The culture of Bangkok reflects its position as Thailand's centre of wealth and modernisation. The city has long been the portal of entry of Western concepts and material goods, which have been adopted and blended with Thai values to various degrees by its residents. This is most evident in the lifestyles of the expanding middle class. [[Conspicuous consumption]] serves as a display of economic and social status, and shopping centres are popular weekend hangouts.<ref>Hamilton 2000, p.&nbsp;468.</ref> Ownership of electronics and consumer products such as mobile phones is ubiquitous. This has been accompanied by a degree of secularism, as religion's role in everyday life has rather diminished. Although such trends have spread to other urban centres, and, to a degree, the countryside, Bangkok remains at the forefront of social change.

A distinct feature of Bangkok is the ubiquity of [[street vendor]]s selling goods ranging from food items to clothing and accessories. It has been estimated that the city may have over 100,000 hawkers. While the BMA has authorised the practice in 287 sites, the majority of activity in another 407 sites takes place illegally. Although they take up pavement space and block pedestrian traffic, many of the city's residents depend on these vendors for their meals, and the BMA's efforts to curb their numbers have largely been unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Street Vendors in Asia: A Review|first=Sharit K |last=Bhowmik |journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=28 May – 4 June 2005 |pages=2256–2264}}</ref>

In 2015, however, the BMA, with support from the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (Thailand's ruling military junta), began cracking down on street vendors in a bid to reclaim public space. Many famous market neighbourhoods were affected, including [[Khlong Thom, Bangkok|Khlong Thom]], [[Saphan Lek]], and the flower market at [[Pak Khlong Talat]]. Nearly 15,000 vendors were evicted from 39 public areas in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nualkhair|first1=Chawadee|title=Bangkok's street food under threat from gentrification|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/feb/12/bangkok-street-food-stalls-under-threat|accessdate=13 February 2017|work=The Guardian|date=12 February 2017}}</ref> While some applauded the efforts to focus on pedestrian rights, others have expressed concern that [[gentrification]] would lead to the loss of the city's character and adverse changes to people's way of life.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mokkhasen|first1=Sasiwan|title=Vanishing Bangkok: What is the Capital Being Remade Into, And For Whom?|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/bangkok/2016/07/05/reorganization/|accessdate=3 February 2017|work=Khaosod English|date=5 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Sauers|first1=Craig|title=Bangkok's disappearing street food|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160817-bangkoks-disappearing-street-food|accessdate=3 February 2017|work=BBC Travel|date=23 August 2016}}</ref>

===Festivals and events===
[[File:Ratchadamnoen King80 arch.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An elaborate double archway above a road, with pictures of King Bhumibol Adulyadej; trees decorated with lights|[[Ratchadamnoen Avenue]] is annually decorated with lights and displays in celebration of [[King Bhumibol]]'s birthday.]]
The residents of Bangkok celebrate many of Thailand's annual festivals. During [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] on 13–15 April, traditional rituals as well as water fights take place throughout the city. [[Loi Krathong]], usually in November, is accompanied by the Golden Mount Fair. New Year celebrations take place at many venues, the most prominent being the plaza in front of [[CentralWorld]]. Observances related to the royal family are held primarily in Bangkok. Wreaths are laid at King Chulalongkorn's equestrian statue in the Royal Plaza on 23 October, which is King Chulalongkorn Memorial Day. The present king's and queen's birthdays, respectively on 5 December and 12 August, are marked as Thailand's national Father's Day and national Mother's Day. These national holidays are celebrated by royal audiences on the day's eve, in which the king or queen gives a speech, and public gatherings on the day of the observance. The king's birthday is also marked by the [[Thai Royal Guards parade|Royal Guards' parade]].

[[Sanam Luang]] is the site of the Thai Kite, Sport and Music Festival, usually held in March, and the [[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]] which takes place in May. The Red Cross Fair at the beginning of April is held at Suan Amporn and the Royal Plaza, and features numerous booths offering goods, games and exhibits. The [[Chinese New Year]] (January–February) and [[Vegetarian Festival]] (September–October) are celebrated widely by the Chinese community, especially in Yaowarat.<ref>Thavisin et al. (eds) 2006, p.&nbsp;72.</ref>

===Media===
Bangkok is the centre of [[Media of Thailand|Thailand's media industry]]. All national newspapers, broadcast media and major publishers are based in the capital. Its 21 national newspapers had a combined daily circulation of about two million in 2002. These include the mass-oriented ''[[Thai Rath]]'', ''[[Khao Sod]]'' and ''[[Daily News (Thailand)|Daily News]]'', the first of which currently prints a million copies per day,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thairath.co.th/corp/index?subMenu=info |title=ข้อมูลทั่วไป (General information) |website=Thai Rath Online |publisher=Wacharapol |accessdate=23 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911034352/http://www.thairath.co.th/corp/index?subMenu=info |archivedate=11 September 2012 }}</ref> as well as the less sensational ''[[Matichon]]'' and ''[[Krungthep Thurakij]]''. The ''[[Bangkok Post]]'' and ''[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]'' are the two national English language dailies. Foreign publications including ''[[The Asian Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''[[The Straits Times]]'' and the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' also have operations in Bangkok.<ref name="Kavi">{{cite book|first=Kavi |last=Chongkittavorn |chapter=The Media and Access to Information in Thailand|pages=255–266|title= The Right to Tell: The Role of Mass Media in Economic Development|editor-first=Roumeen |editor-last=Islam|series=WBI Development Studies|place=Washington, D.C.|publisher=The World Bank|isbn=978-0-8213-5203-8|year=2002 }}</ref> The large majority of Thailand's more than 200 magazines are published in the capital, and include news magazines as well as lifestyle, entertainment, gossip and fashion-related publications.

Bangkok is also the hub of [[Television in Thailand|Thailand's broadcast television]]. All six national terrestrial channels, Channels [[Channel 3 (Thailand)|3]], [[Channel 5 (Thailand)|5]] and [[Channel 7 (Thailand)|7]], [[Modernine TV|Modernine]], [[National Broadcasting Services of Thailand Television|NBT]] and [[Thai PBS]], have headquarters and main studios in the capital. With the exception of local news segments broadcast by the NBT, all programming is done in Bangkok and repeated throughout the provinces. However, this centralised model is weakening with the rise of cable television, which has many local providers. There are numerous cable and satellite [[List of television stations in Bangkok|channels based in Bangkok]]. [[TrueVisions]] is the major subscription television provider in Bangkok and Thailand, and it also carries international programming. Bangkok was home to 40 of Thailand's 311 FM radio stations and 38 of its 212 AM stations in 2002.<ref name="Kavi"/> Broadcast media reform stipulated by the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]] has been progressing slowly, although many community radio stations have emerged in the city.

Likewise, Bangkok has dominated the [[Thai film industry]] since its inception. Although film settings normally feature locations throughout the country, the city is home to all major film studios. Bangkok has dozens of [[List of cinemas in Thailand|cinemas and multiplexes]], and the city hosts two major film festivals annually, the [[Bangkok International Film Festival]] and the [[World Film Festival of Bangkok]].

===Art===
[[File:BKK Art and Culture Centre (II).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A modern-looking building with a smooth curved exterior on the corner of a road junction with several paintings on the wall|The [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], the city's major public contemporary art venue, was opened in 2008 after many delays.]]

Traditional [[Thai art]], long developed within religious and royal contexts, continues to be sponsored by various government agencies in Bangkok, including the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]]' Office of Traditional Arts. The SUPPORT Foundation in Chitralada Palace sponsors traditional and folk handicrafts. Various communities throughout the city still practice their traditional crafts, including the production of ''[[khon]]'' masks, alms bowls, and classical musical instruments. The [[National Gallery of Thailand|National Gallery]] hosts permanent collection of traditional and modern art, with temporary contemporary exhibits. Bangkok's [[contemporary art]] scene has slowly grown from relative obscurity into the public sphere over the past two decades. Private galleries gradually emerged to provide exposure for new artists, including the [[Patravadi Theatre]] and [[H Gallery]]. The centrally located [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]], opened in 2008 following a fifteen-year lobbying campaign, is now the largest public exhibition space in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Center Stage|first=John|last=Krich |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123623705280938041|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> There are also many other [[List of museums and art galleries in Bangkok|art galleries and museums]], including the privately owned [[Museum of Contemporary Art (Bangkok)|Museum of Contemporary Art]].

The city's performing arts scene features traditional theatre and dance as well as Western-style plays. ''Khon'' and other traditional dances are regularly performed at the [[National Theatre (Thailand)|National Theatre]] and [[Salachalermkrung Royal Theatre]], while the [[Thailand Cultural Centre]] is a newer multi-purpose venue which also hosts musicals, orchestras and other events. [[List of theatres in Bangkok|Numerous venues]] regularly feature a variety of performances throughout the city.

The arts in Bangkok have developed almost exclusively and anonymously in the services of Theravada Buddhism since the Ayutthaya period and continuing to the present day by incorporating Western elements which is called the [[Rattanakosin style|Rattanakosin]] or Bangkok style. Nowadays, the modern art scene is centred around Bangkok as the capital of [[contemporary art]] in the region, while traditional art can be found in many commercial areas in the old city as well as temples and palaces throughout the city. There are also a number of artists who prefer to live and work outside the metropolis. The number of artists is constantly on the rise, so an increasing variety of works are available on the art market. Many art galleries in Bangkok tend to sell work restricted to traditional rural motifs. The artists creating this type of art are often influenced by traditional Buddhist beliefs and motifs, and are popular among the general Thai public. Nevertheless, some Thai artists are breaking away from these norms by addressing more controversial issues in their work, for example the loss of traditional values and the obsession with money in today's society.

While [[sepak takraw]] can be seen played in open spaces throughout the city, football and other modern sports are now the norm. Western sports introduced during the reign of King [[Chulalongkorn]] were originally only available to the privileged, and such status is still associated with certain sports. Golf is popular among the upwardly mobile, and there are several courses in Bangkok. [[Horse racing]], highly popular at the mid-20th century, still takes place at the [[Royal Bangkok Sports Club]].

There are many public [[List of sport venues in Bangkok|sporting facilities located throughout Bangkok]]. The two main centres are the [[National Stadium (Thailand)|National Stadium]] complex, which dates to 1938, and the newer [[Hua Mak Sports Complex]], which was built for the [[1998 Asian Games]]. Bangkok had also hosted the games in [[1966 Asian Games|1966]], [[1970 Asian Games|1970]] and [[1978 Asian Games|1978]]; the most of any city. The city was the host of the inaugural [[1959 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games|Southeast Asian Games in 1959]], the [[2007 Summer Universiade]] and the [[2012 FIFA Futsal World Cup]].

Although Bangkok's canals historically served as a major mode of transport, they have long since been surpassed in importance by land traffic. [[Charoen Krung Road]], the first to be built by Western techniques, was completed in 1864. Since then, the road network has vastly expanded to accommodate the sprawling city. A complex elevated [[Thai expressway system|expressway network]] helps bring traffic into and out of the city centre, but Bangkok's rapid growth has put a large strain on infrastructure, and traffic jams have plagued the city since the 1990s. Although rail transport was introduced in 1893 and [[Trams in Bangkok|trams served the city]] from 1888 to 1968, it was only in 1999 that Bangkok's first [[rapid transit]] system began operation. Older [[public transport]] systems include an extensive bus network and [[Water transport in Bangkok|boat services]] which still operate on the Chao Phraya and two canals. Taxis appear in the form of cars, motorcycles, and "''[[tuk-tuk]]''" auto rickshaws.

Bangkok is connected to the rest of the country through the [[Thai highway network|national highway]] and [[Rail transport in Thailand|rail networks]], as well as by domestic flights to and from the city's two international airports. Its centuries-old maritime transport of goods is still conducted through Khlong Toei Port.

The BMA is largely responsible for overseeing the construction and maintenance of the road network and transport systems through its Public Works Department and Traffic and Transportation Department. However, many separate government agencies are also in charge of the individual systems, and much of transport-related policy planning and funding is contributed to by the national government.

===Roads===
Road-based transport is the primary mode of travel in Bangkok. Due to the city's organic development, its streets do not follow an organized grid structure. Forty-eight major roads link the different areas of the city, branching into smaller streets and lanes (''[[soi]]'') which serve local neighbourhoods. Eleven bridges over the Chao Phraya link the two sides of the city, while several expressway and [[Thai motorway network|motorway]] routes bring traffic into and out of the city centre and link with nearby provinces.

[[File:Sukhumwit Road with BTS Asok and Asok Montri Rd.jpg|thumb|left|Traffic jams, seen here on [[Sukhumwit Road]], are common in Bangkok.]]

Bangkok's rapid growth in the 1980s resulted in sharp increases in vehicle ownership and traffic demand, which have since continued—in 2006 there were 3,943,211 in-use vehicles in Bangkok, of which 37.6 percent were private cars and 32.9 percent were motorcycles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Developing Integrated Emission Strategies for Existing Land-transport |url=http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |publisher=Clean Air Initiative |accessdate=15 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603110642/http://cleanairinitiative.org/portal/system/files/articles-72628_Ch3.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2013 }}</ref> These increases, in the face of limited carrying capacity, caused severe traffic congestion evident by the early 1990s. The extent of the problem is such that the Thai Traffic Police has a unit of officers trained in basic midwifery in order to assist deliveries which do not reach hospital in time.<ref>{{cite news|title=In Bangkok gridlock, Thai traffic police double as midwives |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jMfzhH0cMlYhkVxkytUzlBScCrDQ |agency=Agence France-Presse|date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=22 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060147/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jMfzhH0cMlYhkVxkytUzlBScCrDQ |archivedate=27 May 2013 }}</ref> While Bangkok's limited road surface area (8 percent, compared to 20–30 percent in most Western cities) is often cited as a major cause of its traffic jams, other factors, including high vehicle ownership rate relative to income level, inadequate public transport systems, and lack of [[transportation demand management]], also play a role.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tanaboriboon|first=Yordphol|title=Bangkok traffic|journal=IATSS Research|year=1993|volume=7|issue=1|url=http://iatss.or.jp/english/research/17-1/pdf/17-1-02.pdf|accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref> Efforts to alleviate the problem have included the construction of intersection bypasses and an extensive system of elevated highways, as well as the creation of several new rapid transit systems. The city's overall traffic conditions, however, remain poor.

{{anchor|Air pollution}}Traffic has been the main source of [[air pollution]] in Bangkok, which reached serious levels in the 1990s. But efforts to improve air quality by improving fuel quality and enforcing emission standards, among others, had visibly ameliorated the problem by the 2000s. [[Atmospheric particulate matter]] levels dropped from 81 micrograms per cubic metre in 1997 to 43 in 2007.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fuller|first=Thomas|title=Bangkok's template for an air-quality turnaround|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/23/world/asia/23iht-bangkok.html|accessdate=15 September 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 February 2007}}</ref> However, increasing vehicle numbers and a lack of continued pollution-control efforts threatens a reversal of the past success.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Thin Lei Win|title=Choked by traffic, Bangkok revs up to beat air pollution|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bangkok-environment-pollution/choked-by-traffic-bangkok-revs-up-to-beat-air-pollution-idUSKCN18E0KB|accessdate=15 February 2018|agency=Reuters|date=18 May 2017}}</ref> In January–February 2018, weather conditions caused bouts of haze to cover the city, with particulate matter under 2.5 micrometres (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) rising to unhealthy levels for several days on end.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/planning-a-vacation-in-bangkok-don-t-forget-your-pollution-mask|title=There's a New Contender for Title of Asia's Most Polluted City|last1=Chuwiruch|first1=Natnicha|date=15 February 2018|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=15 February 2018|last2=Suwannakij|first2=Supunnabul}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=City smog worsens to danger level|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1412290/city-smog-worsens-to-danger-level|accessdate=15 February 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=15 February 2018}}</ref>

Although the BMA has created thirty signed bicycle routes along several roads totalling {{convert|230|km}},<ref>Traffic and Transportation Department, p.&nbsp;154.</ref> cycling is still largely impractical, especially in the city centre. Most of these bicycle lanes share the pavement with pedestrians. Poor surface maintenance, encroachment by hawkers and street vendors, and a hostile environment for cyclists and pedestrians, make cycling and walking unpopular methods of getting around in Bangkok.

===<span id="Bus services"></span><span id="Buses"></span>Buses and taxis===
[[File:Bangkok Mercedes-Benz bus.jpg|thumb|alt=A partial view of a large traffic circle, with many vehicles on the road, including buses, cars, minibuses, brightly painted taxis and a tuk-tuk|Many buses, minibuses and taxis share the streets with private vehicles at Victory Monument, a major public transport hub.]]

Bangkok has an extensive bus network providing local transit services within the Greater Bangkok area. The [[Bangkok Mass Transit Authority]] (BMTA) operates a monopoly on bus services, with substantial concessions granted to private operators. Buses, minibus vans, and [[song thaeo]] operate on a total of [[List of bus routes in Bangkok|470 routes]] throughout the region.<ref>Traffic and Transportation Department, p.&nbsp;112.</ref> A separate [[bus rapid transit]] system owned by the BMA has been in operation since 2010. Known simply as the [[Bangkok BRT|BRT]], the system currently consists of a single line running from the business district at Sathon to Ratchaphruek on the western side of the city. [[The Transport Co., Ltd.]] is the BMTA's long-distance counterpart, with services to all provinces operating out of Bangkok.

Taxis are ubiquitous in Bangkok, and are a popular form of transport. {{As of|2012|August}}, there are 106,050 cars, 58,276 motorcycles and 8,996 [[auto rickshaw|tuk-tuk]] motorized tricycles cumulatively registered for use as taxis.<ref>{{cite web|last=Transport Statistics Sub-division, Planning Division|title=Number of Vehicles Registered in Thailand as of 31 August 2012|url=http://apps.dlt.go.th/statistics_web/st1/bkk_Aug12.xls|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904061249/http://apps.dlt.go.th/statistics_web/st1/bkk_Aug12.xls|url-status = dead|archive-date=4 September 2015|website=Department of Land Transport website|publisher=Department of Land Transport|accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> Meters have been required for car taxis since 1992, while tuk-tuk fares are usually negotiated. [[Motorcycle taxi]]s operate from regulated ranks, with either fixed or negotiable fares, and are usually employed for relatively short journeys.

Despite their popularity, taxis have gained a bad reputation for often refusing passengers when the requested route is not to the driver's convenience.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sereemongkonpol|first=Pornchai|title=Bangkok's best taxi drivers|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/feature/people/312301/bangkok-s-best-taxi-drivers|accessdate=16 September 2012|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=14 September 2012}}</ref> Motorcycle taxis were previously unregulated, and subject to extortion by organized crime gangs. Since 2003, registration has been required for motorcycle taxi ranks, and drivers now wear distinctive numbered vests designating their district of registration and where they are allowed to accept passengers.

===Rail systems===
{{main|Rail transport in Bangkok}}

Bangkok is the location of [[Hua Lamphong Railway Station]], the main terminus of the national rail network operated by the [[State Railway of Thailand]] (SRT). In addition to long-distance services, the SRT also operates a few daily commuter trains running from and to the outskirts of the city during the rush hour.

Bangkok is served by three rapid transit systems: the [[BTS Skytrain]], the [[MRT (Bangkok)|MRT]], and the elevated [[Airport Rail Link (Bangkok)|Airport Rail Link]]. Although proposals for the development of rapid transit in Bangkok had been made since 1975,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Bangkok transport system development: what went wrong?|first=Wiroj|last=Rujopakarn|journal=Journal of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies|volume=5|date=October 2003|pages=3302–15}}</ref> it was only in 1999 that the BTS finally began operation.

The BTS consists of two lines, [[Sukhumvit Line|Sukhumvit]] and [[Silom Line|Silom]], with 43 stations along {{convert|51.69|km}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Company's Profile |url=https://www.bts.co.th/eng/info/info-history.html |website=Bangkok Mass Transit System PCL Ltd.|accessdate=30 July 2019}}</ref> The MRT opened for use in July 2004, and currently consists of two lines, the [[MRT Blue Line|Blue Line]] and [[MRT Purple Line|Purple Line]]. The Airport Rail Link, opened in August 2010, connects the city center to Suvarnabhumi Airport to the east. Its eight stations span a distance of {{convert|28|km}}.

Although initial passenger numbers were low and their service area was limited to the inner city until the 2016 opening of the [[MRT Purple Line|Purple Line]], which serves the [[Nonthaburi]] area, these systems have become indispensable to many commuters. The BTS reported an average of 600,000 daily trips in 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/BTS-Group-Holding-Plc-30176106.html|title=BTS Group Holdings – The Nation}}</ref> while the MRT had 240,000 passenger trips per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/New-BMCL-boss-eyes-boosting-commercial-revenue-30172472.html|title=New BMCL boss eyes boosting commercial revenue – The Nation}}</ref>

{{As of|September 2020}}, construction work is ongoing to extend the city-wide transit system's reach, including the construction of the [[SRT Light Red Line|Light Red]] grade-separated commuter rail line. The entire [[Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan in Bangkok Metropolitan Region]] consists of eight main lines and four feeder lines totaling {{convert|508|km}} to be completed by 2029. In addition to rapid transit and heavy rail lines, there have been proposals for several [[monorail]] systems.

===Water transport===
[[File:Bangkok RiverExpressBoat Flip666.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Chao Phraya Express Boat]] serves over 35,000 passengers daily.]]

Although much diminished from its past prominence, water-based transport still plays an important role in Bangkok and the immediate upstream and downstream provinces. Several [[water bus]]es serve commuters daily. The [[Chao Phraya Express Boat]] serves thirty-four stops along the river, carrying an average of 35,586 passengers per day in 2010, while the smaller [[Khlong Saen Saep boat service]] serves twenty-seven stops on [[Saen Saep Canal]] with 57,557 daily passengers. [[Long-tail boat]]s operate on fifteen regular routes on the Chao Phraya, and passenger ferries at thirty-two river crossings served an average of 136,927 daily passengers in 2010.<ref>Traffic and Transportation Department, pp.&nbsp;113–122.</ref>

Bangkok Port, popularly known by its location as [[Khlong Toei Port]], was Thailand's main international port from its opening in 1947 until it was superseded by the deep-sea [[Laem Chabang Port]] in 1991. It is primarily a cargo port, though its inland location limits access to ships of 12,000 deadweight tonnes or less. The port handled {{convert|11936855|tonne}} of cargo in the first eight months of the 2010 fiscal year, about 22 percent the total of the country's international ports.<ref>{{cite web|title=ท่าเรือกรุงเทพ |first=Sumalee |last=Sukdanont |date=July 2011 |publisher=Transportation Institute, Chulalongkorn University |accessdate=19 September 2012 |url=http://www.tri.chula.ac.th/triresearch/bangkokport/bangkokport.html |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305120205/http://www.tri.chula.ac.th/triresearch/bangkokport/bangkokport.html |archivedate=5 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=สรุปผลการดำเนินงานของกทท. 8 เดือน ปีงบประมาณ 2553 (ต.ค.52-พ.ค.53) |website=PAT website |publisher=Port Authority of Thailand |url=http://www.port.co.th/pat/topic7/stat_012.pdf |accessdate=19 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120152600/http://www.port.co.th/pat/topic7/stat_012.pdf |archivedate=20 November 2012}}</ref>

===Airports===
[[File:HS-TGA (15495092647).jpg|thumb|right|Suvarnabhumi Airport is home to flag carrier [[Thai Airways International]].]]

Bangkok is one of Asia's busiest [[Airline hub|air transport hubs]]. Two commercial airports serve the city, the older [[Don Mueang International Airport]] and the newer [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]].

Bangkok has long been the centre of modern education in Thailand. The first schools in the country were established here in the later 19th century, and there are now 1,351 [[List of schools in Bangkok|schools in the city]].<ref>{{cite book|authors=Bureau of Information and Communication Technology, OPS, MOE|title=Educational Statistics in Brief 2011|publisher=Ministry of Education|pages=28–29|url=http://www.mis.moe.go.th/mis-th/images/news-2555/260555/EIS/stat54/html/T001.html|accessdate=15 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010035137/http://www.mis.moe.go.th/mis-th/images/news-2555/260555/EIS/stat54/html/T001.html|archive-date=10 October 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref> The city is home to the country's five oldest universities, [[Chulalongkorn University|Chulalongkorn]], [[Thammasat University|Thammasat]], [[Kasetsart University|Kasetsart]], [[Mahidol University|Mahidol]] and [[Silpakorn University|Silpakorn]], founded between 1917 and 1943. The city has since continued its dominance, especially in higher education; the majority of the country's universities, both public and private, [[List of universities in Bangkok|are located in Bangkok]] or the Metropolitan Region. Chulalongkorn and Mahidol are the only Thai universities to appear in the top 500 of the ''[[QS World University Rankings]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=QS World University Rankings |url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2012 |publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds Limited |accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> [[King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi]], also located in Bangkok, is the only Thai university in the top 400 of the 2012–13 ''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=King Mongkut's University of Technology, Thonburi |website=Times Higher Education World University Rankings|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2012-13/world-ranking/institution/king-mongkuts-university-of-technology-thonburi|publisher=TSL Education|accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref>

Over the past few decades the general trend of pursuing a university degree has prompted the founding of new universities to meet the needs of Thai students. Bangkok became not only a place where immigrants and provincial Thais go for job opportunities, but also for a chance to receive a university degree. [[Ramkhamhaeng University]] emerged in 1971 as Thailand's first open university; it now has the highest enrolment in the country. The demand for higher education has led to the founding of many other universities and colleges, both public and private. While many universities have been established in major provinces, the Greater Bangkok region remains home to the greater majority of institutions, and the city's tertiary education scene remains over-populated with non-Bangkokians. The situation is not limited to higher education, either. In the 1960s, 60 to 70 percent of 10- to 19-year-olds who were in school had migrated to Bangkok for secondary education. This was due to both a lack of secondary schools in the provinces and perceived higher standards of education in the capital.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Sukanya|last=Nitungkorn |title=The problems of secondary education expansion in Thailand |journal=Southeast Asian Studies|volume=26|issue=1|date=June 1988 |url=http://kyoto-seas.org/pdf/26/1/260102.pdf|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> Although this discrepancy has since largely abated, tens of thousands of students still compete for places in Bangkok's leading schools. Education has long been a prime factor in the centralization of Bangkok and will play a vital role in the government's efforts to decentralize the country.

Bangkok has a relatively moderate crime rate when compared to urban counterparts around the world.<ref name="OSAC"/> Traffic accidents are a major hazard<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1376875/thailand-tops-road-death-ranking-list|title=Thailand tops road death ranking list|work=Bangkok Post|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> while natural disasters are rare. Intermittent episodes of political unrest and occasional terrorist attacks have resulted in losses of life.

Although the crime threat in Bangkok is relatively low, non-confrontational crimes of opportunity such as pick-pocketing, purse-snatching, and credit card fraud occur with frequency.<ref name="OSAC">{{Include-USGov |agency=Overseas Security Advisory Council |source={{cite web|title=Thailand 2012 Crime and Safety Report: Bangkok|date=14 March 2012 |url=https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=12189 |website=Overseas Security Advisory Council website |publisher=Bureau of Diplomatic Security, U.S. Department of State|accessdate=24 September 2012}}}}</ref> Bangkok's growth since the 1960s has been followed by increasing crime rates partly driven by urbanisation, migration, unemployment and poverty.<!--Supported by following reference.--> By the late 1980s, Bangkok's crime rates were about four times that of the rest of the country.<!--Supported by following reference.--> The police have long been preoccupied with street crimes ranging from housebreaking to assault and murder.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Urban Crime in the Changing Thai Society: The Case of Bangkok Metropolis |first=Prathan |last=Watanavanich |pages=193–210 |title=Crime Prevention in the Urban Community |editor1-first=Koichi |editor1-last=Miyazawa |editor2-first=Setsuo |editor2-last=Miyazawa |year=1995 |publisher=Kluwer Law and Taxation Publishers |place=Deventer, The Netherlands}}</ref> The 1990s saw the emergence of vehicle theft and organized crime, particularly by foreign gangs.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/magazine/2000/1013/nat.thailand.html |first=Antony|last=Davis|title=Bangkok as Crime Central |journal=Asiaweek |date=13 October 2000|volume=26|issue=40|accessdate=24 September 2012}}</ref> Drug trafficking, especially that of ''[[ya ba]]'' methamphetamine pills, is also chronic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frontiermyanmar.net/en/thai-police-seize-45-million-worth-of-meth-from-convoy-in-bangkok|title=Thai police seize $45&nbsp;million worth of meth from convoy in Bangkok|last=AFP|website=Frontier Myanmar|language=en|access-date=2018-12-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/thai/drug-raids-07052017163506.html|title=Thai Police Seize $20 Million Worth of 'Yaba' Meth Pills|website=BenarNews|language=en|access-date=2018-12-25}}</ref>

According to police statistics, the most common complaint received by the Metropolitan Police Bureau in 2010 was housebreaking, with 12,347 cases. This was followed by 5,504 cases of motorcycle thefts, 3,694 cases of assault and 2,836 cases of embezzlement. Serious offences included 183 murders, 81 gang robberies, 265 robberies, 1 kidnapping and 9 arson cases. Offences against the state were by far more common, and included 54,068 drug-related cases, 17,239 cases involving prostitution and 8,634 related to gambling.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=th:สถิติคดีอาญา 5 กลุ่ม ปี 2553 |trans-title=5-group criminal case statistics, 2010 |url=http://statistic.police.go.th/stat/40_50/MONTH53.xls |website=สถิติคดีอาญา (Criminal case statistics) |publisher=Office of Information and Communication Technology, Royal Thai Police |format=XLS |language=Thai |accessdate=24 September 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827062830/http://statistic.police.go.th/stat/40_50/MONTH53.xls |archivedate=27 August 2011 }}</ref> The Thailand Crime Victim Survey conducted by the Office of Justice Affairs of the Ministry of Justice found that 2.7 percent of surveyed households reported a member being victim of a crime in 2007.

Political demonstrations and protests are common in Bangkok. The historic uprisings of 1973, 1976 and 1992 are infamously known for the deaths from military suppression. Most events since then have been peaceful, but the series of major protests since 2006 have often turned violent. Demonstrations during March–May 2010 ended in a [[2010 Thai military crackdown|crackdown in which 92 were killed]], including armed and unarmed protesters, security forces, civilians and journalists. Terrorist incidents have also occurred in Bangkok, most notably the [[2015 Bangkok bombing|bombing in 2015]] at the [[Erawan shrine]], which killed 20, and also a [[2006 Bangkok bombings|series of bombings]] on the 2006–07 New Year's Eve.

Traffic accidents are a major hazard in Bangkok. There were 37,985 accidents in the city in 2010, resulting in 16,602 injuries and 456 deaths as well as 426.42&nbsp;million baht in damages. However, the rate of fatal accidents is much lower than in the rest of Thailand. While accidents in Bangkok amounted to 50.9 percent of the entire country, only 6.2 percent of fatalities occurred in the city.<ref>Traffic and Transportation Department, pp.&nbsp;138–144.</ref> Another serious public health hazard comes from [[Stray dogs in Bangkok|Bangkok's stray dogs]]. Up to 300,000 strays are estimated to roam the city's streets,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090608-thailand-straydogs-video-ap.html|title=Stray Dogs Overwhelming Bangkok|agency=Associated Press|work=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic Society|date=8 June 2009|accessdate=24 September 2012}}</ref> and dog bites are among the most common injuries treated in the emergency departments of the city's hospitals. Rabies is prevalent among the dog population, and treatment for bites pose a heavy public burden.{{efn|A 1993 study found dog bites to constitute 5.3 percent of injuries seen at Siriraj Hospital's emergency department.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Kasian |last1=Bhanganada |first2=Henry |last2=Wilde |first3=Piyasakol |last3=Sakolsataydorn |first4= Pairoj |last4=Oonsombat |title=Dog-bite injuries at a Bangkok teaching hospital |journal=Acta Tropica |volume=55|issue=4|pages=249–255|date=December 1993 |doi=10.1016/0001-706X(93)90082-M|pmid=8147281 }}</ref>}}

==International relations==

The city's formal international relations are managed by the International Affairs Division of the BMA. Its missions include partnering with other major cities through [[sister city]] agreements, participation and membership in international organizations, and pursuing cooperative activities with the many foreign diplomatic missions based in the city.<ref name="IAD mission">{{cite web|url=http://iad.bangkok.go.th/en/node/334|title=Project Plan|author=International Affairs Division|website=International Affairs Division website|publisher=International Affairs Division, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration|accessdate=12 September 2012}}</ref>
