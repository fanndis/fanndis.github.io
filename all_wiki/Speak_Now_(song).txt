"'''Speak Now'''" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. The song is produced by Swift and [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]], was released as a [[promotional recording|promotional single]] on October 5, 2010, by [[Big Machine Records]] from her [[Speak Now|2010 album of the same name]]. Swift wrote the song about interrupting a wedding, after conversing with her friend, whose [[Ex (relationship)|ex-boyfriend]] would soon [[wedding|wed]] someone else, and having a dream about one of her own ex-boyfriends marrying another girl. The song relies on [[acoustic guitar]] and is a narration from the perspective of a person who crashes her former love's wedding in an attempt to win him back.

The song opened to critical acclaim for its lyrical detail. "Speak Now" had successful commercial outcomes in Canada and the United States, debuting and peaking at number eight on both the [[Canadian Hot 100]] and the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Its appearance on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 marked Swift's sixth top ten debut, which made her the artist with the most top ten debuts in the history of the chart. "Speak Now" also managed to garner enough airplay to chart on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart.

==Background==
"Speak Now" was written by Swift, as were all the tracks for the album.<ref name="announcesalbum">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/17386/183729|title= Taylor Swift Announces Third Album, 'Speak Now'|first=Daniel|last=Kreps|date=July 21, 2010|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref> The song was inspired by the story of her friend and her high school boyfriend. The couple went their separate ways after high school – with the idea that they would get back together. One day, Swift's friend informed Swift that her high school boyfriend would soon wed. "He had met this girl who's just this horrible, mean person who made him completely stop talking to all of his friends, cut off his family. She had him so completely isolated," said Swift.<ref name="xfinity">{{cite web|url=http://www.fancast.com/tv/Taylor-Swift/141083/1603978994/The-Songs-of-Speak-Now%3A-Speak-Now/videos|title=Songs of Speak Now: Speak Now|work=Xfnitytv.com|publisher=[[Comcast]]|accessdate=October 15, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105102858/http://www.fancast.com/tv/Taylor-Swift/141083/1603978994/The-Songs-of-Speak-Now%3A-Speak-Now/videos|archivedate=November 5, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She asked her friend if she would "speak now." Perplexed, her friend asked for an explanation, and she answered, "You know, storm the church. 'Speak now or forever hold your peace.' I'll go with you. I'll play guitar. It'd be great."<ref name="xfinity" /> Swift's friend found this to be humorous, laughing at the idea.<ref name="xfinity" />

After speaking with her friend, Swift became deeply fixated on the idea of how tragic it would be for the person one loved to wed someone else. That night, Swift experienced a [[dream]] where one of her own ex-boyfriends married another girl. To her, this signaled that she had to compose a song about interrupting a wedding. In retrospect, she concluded, "For me, I like to think of it as good versus evil. And this girl is just completely – just the evil one."<ref name="xfinity" /> Swift entitled the album after "Speak Now" because it fit the album's concept, with each song being a different confession to a person.<ref name="announcesalbum" /> "It's called ''Speak Now'', and that pertains to the album as a concept and as an entire theme of the record more than I can even tell you," she said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1644110/20100720/swift__taylor.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Reveals Next Album, Speak Now, Is Due October 25|first=James|last=Dinh|date=July 20, 2010|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=[[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref> The song was released as a [[promotional recording|promotional single]] on October 5, 2010, as part of Countdown to ''Speak Now'', an exclusive campaign launched by the [[iTunes Store]].<ref name="itunes">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/speak-now/id396214115?i=396214117&v0=WWW-NAUS-ITSTOP100-SONGS&ign-mpt=uo%3D2|title=Speak Now – Single by Taylor Swift|work=[[iTunes Store]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012063054/http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/speak-now/id396214115?i=396214117&v0=WWW-NAUS-ITSTOP100-SONGS&ign-mpt=uo%3D2|archivedate=October 12, 2010|publisher=[[Apple, Inc]]|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/taylor-swift-countdown-to/id396466660|title=Countdown to Speak Now|work=iTunes Store|publisher=Apple, Inc|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref> During the opening week of ''Speak Now'', Swift performed "Speak Now" on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Late Show with David Letterman |series=Late Show with David Letterman |serieslink=Late Show with David Letterman |credits= |network=CBS|airdate=October 26, 2010}}</ref>

In the lyrics of "Speak Now", Swift sings about crashing her former love's wedding in attempt to win him back.<ref name="billboardrelease" /> The opening lines acknowledge that, although out of character, Swift is still in love with her ex-boyfriend and wants to make sure he does not marry the wrong girl. Throughout the song's [[verse (popular music)|verse]]s, Swift sneaks in the wedding and describes her observations, such as the [[bride]]-to-be's wearing of a poofy [[wedding gown]] shaped like a pastry, her cumulative family, and an organist playing "[[Bridal Chorus]]".<ref name="ew" /><ref name="mtvpreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1649313/20101005/swift__taylor.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Previews 'Speak Now'|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|date=October 5, 2010|work=MTV News|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref> In "Speak Now"'s [[refrain]]s, Swift pleads her ex-boyfriend to not say his vows in order to run away with her.<ref name="billboardrelease" /><ref name="mtvpreview" /> The [[bridge (music)|bridge]] has Swift responding to the priest's calling of "Speak now or forever hold your peace" before repeating the opening lines.

==Critical reception==
The song received critical acclaim. Simon Vozick-Levinson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' deemed "Speak Now" one of Swift's best songs yet. He also said, "Her expressive delivery of the lyrics makes up for any shortcomings as a technical vocalist" and that it was "expertly catchy". He concluded that he was unable to stop playing the song after he heard it.<ref name="ew" /> Bill Lamb of [[About.com]] said the song was "brilliant". He continued, "The song is sweet, funny, bratty, and edgy all at the same time. Taylor Swift remains one of our most gifted young lyricists."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/b/2010/10/05/taylor-swift-drops-brilliant-speak-now-title-song-from-upcoming-album-and-storms-the-charts.htm|title=Taylor Swift Drops Brilliant "Speak Now" Title Song From Upcoming Album and Storms the Charts|first=Bill|last=Lamb|date=October 5, 2010|work=[[About.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref> Jonathan Keefe of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' thought that "Speak Now" exemplified Swift's inability to "write authoritatively about anything other than how great boys are or how much boys suck or how dreams about boys will take her somewhere better than where she is now."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/taylor-swift-speak-now/2300|first=Jonathan|last=Keefe|date=October 25, 2010|title=Taylor Swift – Speak Now|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]|accessdate=July 29, 2011}}</ref>
