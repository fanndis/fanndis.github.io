'''Brown University''' is a [[private university|private]] [[Ivy League]] [[research university]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. Founded in 1764 as the ''College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations'', it is the [[List of colonial colleges|seventh-oldest institution]] of [[higher education]] in the United States and one of the nine [[colonial colleges]] chartered before the [[American Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=B0180 |title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana &#124; Bicentennial celebration |publisher=Brown University |accessdate=July 9, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528014708/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=B0180 |archive-date=May 28, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

}}
The origin of Brown University can be dated to 1761, when three residents of [[Newport, Rhode Island]], drafted a petition to the [[Rhode Island General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the colony:<ref>[[#Dexter|Dexter (1916)]], pp. 24–25.</ref>

<blockquote>Your Petitioners propose to open a literary institution or School for instructing young Gentlemen in the Languages, Mathematics, Geography & History, & such other branches of Knowledge as shall be desired. That for this End ... it will be necessary ... to erect a public Building or Buildings for the boarding of the youth & the Residence of the Professors.</blockquote>

The three petitioners were [[Ezra Stiles]], pastor of Newport's [[Clarke Street Meeting House|Second Congregational Church]] and future president of [[Yale University|Yale]]; [[William Ellery|William Ellery, Jr.]], future [[Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence|signer]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]; and [[Josias Lyndon]], future governor of the colony. Stiles and Ellery were co-authors of the Charter of the College two years later. The editor of Stiles's papers observes, "This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr. Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown University."<ref>[[#Dexter|Dexter (1916)]], p. 25.</ref>

There is further documentary evidence that Stiles was making plans for a college in 1762. On January 20, Chauncey Whittelsey, pastor of the First Church of New Haven, answered a letter from Stiles:<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 13–14.</ref>

<blockquote>The week before last I sent you the Copy of Yale College Charter ... Should you make any Progress in the Affair of a Colledge, I should be glad to hear of it; I heartily wish you Success therein.</blockquote>

The Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches also had an eye on Rhode Island, home of the mother church of their denomination: the [[First Baptist Church in America]], founded in Providence in 1638 by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]. The Baptists were as yet unrepresented among colonial colleges; the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalists]] had [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]], the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] had the College of New Jersey (later [[Princeton University|Princeton]]), and the [[Church of England|Episcopalians]] had the [[College of William and Mary]] and King's College (later [[Columbia University|Columbia]]). Isaac Backus was the historian of the New England Baptists and an inaugural Trustee of Brown, writing in 1784. He described the October 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:<ref>Isaac Backus, ''A History of New-England'', 3 vols. (Boston, 1777–96), vol. 2, quoted in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 8.</ref>

<blockquote>The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ... Mr. [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]], who took his first degree in [[Princeton University|New-Jersey college]] in September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader in this important work.</blockquote>{{Multiple image

}}
Manning arrived at [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the Charter for the college. Stiles's first draft was read to the [[Rhode Island General Assembly|General Assembly]] in August 1763 and rejected by Baptist members who worried that the College Board of Fellows would under-represent the Baptists. A revised Charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Assembly on March 3, 1764.

In September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the College Corporation was held at Newport. Governor [[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]] was chosen chancellor, former and future governor [[Samuel Ward (American statesman)|Samuel Ward]] was vice chancellor, [[John Tillinghast]] treasurer, and Thomas Eyres secretary. The Charter stipulated that the Board of Trustees be composed of 22 Baptists, five [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], five Episcopalians, and four Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight should be Baptists—including the College president—"and the rest indifferently of any or all Denominations."<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 502–503; the Charter and its drafts and associated documents are printed in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 493–507; and in [[#Guild|Guild (1867)]], pp. 119–146.</ref>

The Charter was not the grant of [[King George III]], as is sometimes supposed, but rather an Act of the colonial General Assembly. In two particulars, the Charter may be said to be a uniquely progressive document. First, other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing doctrines, while Brown's Charter asserted, "Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Part of the Public and Classical Instruction." Second, according to Brown University historian Walter Bronson, "the instrument governing Brown University recognized more broadly and fundamentally than any other the principle of denominational cooperation."<ref name="Bronson, pp. 29-33"/> The oft-repeated statement is inaccurate that Brown's Charter alone prohibited a religious test for College membership; other college charters were also liberal in that particular.

[[File:Brown University 1792 engraving.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|[[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]] (right) and president's house, engraving 1792|alt=]]
[[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]] was sworn in as the college's first president in 1765 and served until 1791. In 1770, the College moved from [[Warren, Rhode Island]], to the crest of [[College Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|College Hill]] overlooking Providence. [[Solomon Drowne]], a freshman in the class of 1773, wrote in his diary on March 26, 1770:<ref>Quoted in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 54–55.</ref>

<blockquote>This day the Committee for settling the spot for the College, met at the New-Brick School House, when it was determined it should be set on ye Hill opposite Mr. John Jenkes; up the Presbyterian Lane.</blockquote>

Presbyterian Lane is the present College Street. The eight-acre site had been purchased in two parcels by the corporation for £219, mainly from [[Moses Brown]] and [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John Brown]], the parcels having "formed a part of the original home lots of their ancestor, [[Chad Brown (minister)|Chad Brown]], and of George Rickard, who bought them from the Indians." [[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]] was known as "The College Edifice" until 1823; it was modelled on [[Nassau Hall]] at the College of New Jersey. Its construction was managed by the firm of Nicholas Brown and Company, which spent £2,844 in the first year building the College Edifice and the adjacent President's House.<ref>[[#Guild|Guild (1867)]], pp. 233–236 & 299.</ref><ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 55–56.</ref>

Brown exhibit traces links to slave trade] Reuters, March 29, 2007.</ref> his son [[Nicholas Brown, Jr.]] (class of 1786), [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John Brown]], [[Joseph Brown (astronomer)|Joseph Brown]], and [[Moses Brown]] were all instrumental in moving the college to Providence and securing its endowment. Joseph became a professor of natural philosophy at the college; John served as its treasurer from 1775 to 1796; and Nicholas Junior succeeded his uncle as treasurer from 1796 to 1825.

On September 8, 1803, the Corporation voted, "That the donation of $5000 Dollars, if made to this College within one Year from the late Commencement, shall entitle the donor to name the College." That appeal was answered by College treasurer Nicholas Brown, Junior, in a letter dated September 6, 1804, and the Corporation honored its promise. "In gratitude to Mr. Brown, the Corporation at the same meeting voted, 'That this College be called and known in all future time by the Name of Brown University'."<ref name="Bronson, pp. 29-33">[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 29–33.</ref> Over the years, the benefactions of Nicholas Brown, Jr., totaled nearly $160,000, an enormous sum for that period, and included the buildings Hope College (1821–22) and Manning Hall (1834-35).

It is sometimes erroneously supposed that Brown University was named after John Brown, whose commercial activity included the transportation of African slaves. In fact, Brown University was named for Nicholas Brown, Jr., philanthropist, founder of the [[Providence Athenaeum]], co-founder of [[Butler Hospital]], and an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]. Nicholas Brown, Jr., became a financier of the movement under the guidance of his uncle [[Moses Brown]], one of the leading abolitionists of his day.<ref>{{cite web |author= Howell, Ricardo |date=July 2001 |url= https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Info/Slavery.html |title= Slavery, the Brown Family of Providence and Brown University |publisher= Brown University News Service |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080409001105/https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Info/Slavery.html |archive-date= April 9, 2008 }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2016}}<ref>The opposing attitudes to the slave trade within the Brown family—from John Brown's unapologetic participation to Moses and Nicholas Brown's activist opposition—are described in Ricardo Howell, "Slavery, the Brown Family of Providence and Brown University" (2001, published online at Brown.edu), and in Charles Rappleye, ''Sons of Providence: The Brown Brothers, the Slave Trade, and the American Revolution'' (New York, 2006).</ref>

==== The American Revolution ====
The College library was moved out of Providence for safekeeping in the fall of 1776, with British vessels patrolling Narragansett Bay. On December 7, 1776, six thousand British and Hessian troops sailed into Newport harbor under the command of Sir Peter Parker. College President Manning said in a letter written after the war:<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 66–67.</ref>

<blockquote>The royal Army landed on Rhode Island & took possession of the same: This brought their Camp in plain View from the College with the naked Eye; upon which the Country flew to Arms & marched for Providence, there, unprovided with Barracks they marched into the College & dispossessed the Students, about 40 in Number.</blockquote>

"In the claim for damages presented by the Corporation to the United States government," says the university historian, "it is stated that the American troops used it for barracks and hospital from December 10, 1776, to April 20, 1780, and that the French troops used it for a hospital from June 26, 1780, to May 27, 1782."<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 68.</ref> The French troops were those of the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]].

The GISP was inspired by student-initiated experimental schools, especially [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]], and sought ways to "put students at the center of their education" and "teach students how to think rather than just teaching facts."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2005/03/02/the-new-curriculum-then/|title=The New Curriculum Then|last=Leubsdorf|first=Ben|date=2005-03-02|work=Brown Daily Herald|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110005326/http://www.browndailyherald.com/2005/03/02/the-new-curriculum-then/|archive-date=November 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Members of the GISP, Ira Magaziner and Elliot Maxwell published a paper of their findings entitled, "Draft of a Working Paper for Education at Brown University."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dl.lib.brown.edu/libweb/papers/maxwell.php|title=Draft of a working paper for education at Brown University|author=Ira magaziner with Elliot Maxwell|publisher=Brown University Library|accessdate=December 6, 2007|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> The paper made proposals for the new curriculum, including [[interdisciplinary]] freshman-year courses that would introduce "modes of thought," with instruction from faculty from different disciplines as well as for an end to letter grades. The following year Magaziner began organizing the student body to press for the reforms, organizing discussions and protests.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=1993|title=Curriculum|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Brunoniana|publisher=Brown University Library|location=Providence, Rhode Island|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=C0780|accessdate=December 6, 2007|last=Mitchell|first=Martha|oclc=31085279|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911102040/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=C0780|archive-date=September 11, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1969, University President Ray Heffner Special Committee on Curricular Philosophy in response to student rallies held support of curriculum reform. The committee was tasked with developing specific reforms and the resulting report was called the Maeder Report after the committee's chairman. The report was presented to the faculty, which voted the New Curriculum into existence on May 7, 1969. Its key features included:<ref name="bdh_newcurr">{{cite news|url=http://media.www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2005/03/02/Focus/The-New.Curriculum.Then-882258.shtml|title=The New Curriculum Then|last=Leubsdorf|first=Ben|date=March 2, 2005|accessdate=December 5, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328030651/http://media.www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2005/03/02/Focus/The-New.Curriculum.Then-882258.shtml|archive-date=March 28, 2009|url-status=dead|newspaper=Brown Daily Herald|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
* Modes of Thought courses for first-year students
* The introduction of interdisciplinary courses
* The abandonment of "general education" distribution requirements
* The Satisfactory/No Credit (S/NC) grading option
* The ABC/No Credit grading system, which eliminated pluses, minuses, and D's; a grade of "No Credit" (equivalent to F's at other institutions) would not appear on external transcripts.

The Modes of Thought course was discontinued early on, but the other elements are still in place. In 2006, the reintroduction of plus/minus grading was broached by persons concerned about grade inflation. The idea was rejected by the College Curriculum Council after canvassing alumni, faculty, and students, including the original authors of the Magaziner-Maxwell Report.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Sheridan_Center/pubs/teachingExchange/jan2002/grade_inflat.shtml|title=Grade Inflation and the Brown Grading System: 2001–2002 Sheridan Center Research Project|work=The Teaching Exchange|publisher=Sheridan Center for Teaching, Brown University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204090048/https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Sheridan_Center/pubs/teachingExchange/jan2002/grade_inflat.shtml|archive-date=February 4, 2007|url-status=live|accessdate=December 5, 2007|df=mdy}}; {{cite news|url=http://media.www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2006/03/15/CampusNews/Plusminus.Fails.Key.Test-1686967.shtml|title=Plus/minus fails key test: Faculty could still vote to change grading system|last=Lutts|first=Chloe|date=March 15, 2006|accessdate=December 11, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328034948/http://media.www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2006/03/15/CampusNews/Plusminus.Fails.Key.Test-1686967.shtml|archive-date=March 28, 2009|url-status=dead|newspaper=Brown Daily Herald|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, President Christina Paxson has noted that grade inflation clearly exists at Brown, with 53.4% of grades given at Brown being As during the 2012–2013 academic year.<ref name="browndailyherald.com">https://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/03/12/fighting-grade-inflation-cause-without-rebel/</ref> Another unique feature of the grading system at Brown is that failures are erased from the student's transcript; as a result, some students have asked a professor for a failing grade, rather than having a C on his or her transcript.<ref name="browndailyherald.com"/> While erasure of failing grades from external transcripts is unique to Brown, it is important to note that grade inflation also exists at other U.S. universities.

===Slavery and Justice report===
[[File:94_Waterman_Street_(Brown).jpg|thumb|The Slavery and Justice report prompted the establishment of the [[Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice]] ]]
In 2003, then-University president [[Ruth Simmons]] launched a steering committee to research the school's eighteenth-century ties to slavery.

==Coat of arms==
[[File:Brown_1834_Seal.png|alt=|thumb|The Third College Seal, adopted in September 1834|120x120px]]
Brown University's coat of arms was created in 1834. The prior year, president [[Francis Wayland]] had commissioned a committee to update the school's logo to match the name the university had adopted in 1804.

Central in the coat of arms is a white [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] divided into four sectors by a red cross; within each sector is an open book. Above the shield is a crest consisting of the upper half of a [[sun in splendor]] among the clouds atop a red and white [[torse]]. 

The sun and clouds represent "learning piercing the clouds of ignorance," while the cross is believed to be a [[Saint George's Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Brown University: Visual Identity and Graphic Standards|url = https://www.brown.edu/webmaster/visual_identity/logo.html|website = www.brown.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-24|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160331121834/http://www.brown.edu/webmaster/visual_identity/logo.html|archive-date = March 31, 2016|url-status = live}}</ref> The seal's four open books symbolize learning, and are rumored to represent Harvard, Yale, Cambridge and Oxford.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Object Biography: Brown University's Seal – Archaeology of Brown University and College Hill|url=https://blogs.brown.edu/archaeology250/2015/11/13/object-biography-brown-universitys-seal/|access-date=2020-11-01|language=en-US}}</ref>

}}</ref> The College Hill campus was built contemporarily with the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century precincts that surround it, so that university buildings blend with the architectural fabric of the city. The only indicator of "campus" is a brick and wrought-iron fence on Prospect, George, and Waterman streets, enclosing the College Green and Front Green. The character of Brown's urban campus is then European organic rather than American landscaped.

=== Main campus ===
{{further|List of Brown University buildings}}
The main campus, comprising 235 buildings and {{convert|143|acre|km2}}, is on College Hill in Providence's [[East Side, Providence, Rhode Island|East Side]]. It is reached from downtown principally by three extremely steep streets—College, Waterman, and [[Angell Street|Angell]]—which run through the Benefit Street historic district and the campus of the [[Rhode Island School of Design]]. College Street, culminating with Van Wickle Gates at the top of the hill, is especially beautiful and is the setting for the Convocation and Commencement processions.

'''Van Wickle Gates'''
{{Main|Van Wickle Gates}}
The Van Wickle Gates, dedicated on June 18, 1901, have a pair of smaller side gates that are open year-round, and a large central gate that is opened two days a year for Convocation and Commencement. At Convocation the gate opens inward to admit the procession of new students. At Commencement, the gate opens outward for the procession of graduates.<ref>Mitchell, Martha. (1993). "[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=V0020 Van Wickle Gates] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171141/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=V0020 |date=March 3, 2016 }}." ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana''</ref> A Brown superstition is that students who walk through the central gate a second time prematurely will not graduate, although walking backward is said to cancel the hex. Members of the [[Brown University Band]] famously flout the superstition by walking through the gate three times too many, as they annually play their role in the Commencement parade.

The core green spaces of the main campus are the Front (or "Quiet") Green, the college (or "Main") Green, and the Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle (until 2012 called Lincoln Field). The old buildings on these three greens are the most photographed. The College Green includes sculptures by noted artists [[Henry Moore]] and [[Giuseppe Penone]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/travel/where-to-see-really-see-the-art-of-maya-lin.html|title=Where to See (Really See) the Art of Maya Lin|last=Rubinton|first=Noel|date=2017-10-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206001909/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/travel/where-to-see-really-see-the-art-of-maya-lin.html|archive-date=December 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Adjacent to this older campus are, to the south, academic buildings and residential quadrangles, including Wriston, Keeney, and Gregorian quadrangles; to the east, Sciences Park occupying two city blocks; to the north, connected to Simmons Quadrangle by The Walk, academic and residential precincts, including the life sciences complex and the Pembroke Campus; and to the west, on the slope of College Hill, academic buildings, including List Art Center and the Hay and Rockefeller libraries. The perimeter of the old campus contains the university's four significant examples of [[Brutalist architecture]], the [[John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library]], the [[Sciences Library (Brown University)|Sciences Library]], the List Art Building, and the Graduate Center. Also on the slope of College Hill, contiguous with Brown, is the campus of the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].

'''John Hay Library'''
{{Main|John Hay Library}}
The John Hay Library is the second oldest library on campus. It was opened in 1910 and named for [[John Hay]] (class of 1858, private secretary to [[Abraham Lincoln]] and Secretary of State under two Presidents) at the request of his friend [[Andrew Carnegie]], who contributed half of the $300,000 cost of the building.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=J0080 |title=From Martha Mitchell's ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana'': John Hay Library |publisher=Brown.edu |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217214933/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=J0080 |archive-date=February 17, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is now the repository of the university's archives, rare books and manuscripts, and special collections.

It houses a very large percentage of the titles published before that date about the discovery, settlement, history, and natural history of the New World. The "JCB", as it is known, published the 29-volume ''Bibliotheca Americana'', a principal bibliography in the field.

The JCB holdings comprise more than 50,000 early titles and about 16,000 modern books, as well as prints, manuscripts, maps, and other items in the library's specialty. Manning now houses the [[Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology]].

[[File:Manning Chapel.jpg|thumb|The galleries of the Haffenreffer Museum are located in Manning Hall ( 1834).|alt=|220x220px]]

===Haffenreffer Museum===
{{Main|Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology}}
The exhibition galleries of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, Brown's teaching museum, are located in Manning Hall on the campus's main green. Its one million artifacts, available for research and educational purposes, are located at its Collections Research Center in Bristol, RI. The museum's goal is to inspire creative and critical thinking about culture by fostering an interdisciplinary understanding of the material world. It provides opportunities for faculty and students to work with collections and the public, teaching through objects and programs in classrooms and exhibitions. The museum sponsors lectures and events in all areas of anthropology, and also runs an extensive program of outreach to local schools.

=== Annmary Brown Memorial ===
{{Main|Annmary Brown Memorial}}
The Annmary Brown Memorial was constructed from 1903 to 1907 by the politician, Civil War veteran, and book collector General [[Rush Hawkins]], as a mausoleum for his wife, Annmary Brown, a member of the Brown family. In addition to its crypt—the final repository for Brown and Hawkins—the Memorial includes works of art from Hawkins's private collection, including paintings by [[Angelica Kauffman]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Gilbert Stuart]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], [[Benjamin West]], and [[Eastman Johnson]], among others. His collection of over 450 [[Incunable|incunabula]] (materials printed in Europe before 1501) was relocated to the John Hay Library in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=A0370|title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana {{!}} Annmary Brown Memorial|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2019-02-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190123220353/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=A0370|archive-date=January 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Today the Memorial is home to Brown's Medieval Studies and Renaissance Studies programs.

=== The Walk ===
The "Walk" connects Pembroke Campus to the main campus. It is a succession of green spaces extending from Ruth Simmons Quadrangle (Lincoln Field) in the south to the Pembroke College monument on Meeting Street in the north. It is bordered by departmental buildings and the [[Perry and Marty Granoff Center for the Creative Arts|Granoff Center for the Creative Arts]]. A focal point of The Walk is [[Maya Lin]]'s water-circulating topographical sculpture of Narragansett Bay, entitled "Under the Laurentide." Installed in 2015, it is next to the Institute for the Study of Environment and Society.<ref name=":1" />

===Pembroke campus===
[[File:Brown_University_Pembroke_campus_(crop_and_straighten).jpg|thumb|The three dormitories of Metcalf Hall (1919), Andrews Hall (1947), and Miller Hall (1910) formed the heart of Pembroke College]]
The [[Pembroke College in Brown University|Women's College in Brown University]], known as Pembroke College, was founded in October 1891. When it merged with Brown in 1971, the Pembroke Campus was absorbed into the Brown campus. The Pembroke campus is centered on a quadrangle that fronts on Meeting Street, where a garden and monument—with scale-model of the quadrangle in bronze—compose the formal entry to the campus. The Pembroke campus is among the most pleasing spaces at Brown, with noteworthy examples of Victorian and Georgian architecture. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907, formerly Pembroke Gymnasium), and Metcalf Hall (1919); the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910); the quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947) and its terrace and garden. Pembroke Hall, originally a classroom building and library, now houses the Cogut Center for the Humanities.

East Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, was originally the site of [[Bryant University]]. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to move to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown bought their Providence campus for $5 million. This expanded the Brown campus by {{convert|10|acre|m2}} and 26 buildings, included several historic houses, notably the Isaac Gifford Ladd house, built 1850 (now Brown's Orwig Music Library), and the Robert Taft House, built 1895 (now King House). The area was named East Campus in 1971.

[[Thayer Street]] runs through Brown's main campus, north to south, and is College Hill's reduced-scale counterpart to [[Harvard Square]] or Berkeley's [[Telegraph Avenue]]. Restaurants, cafes, bistros, taverns, pubs, bookstores, second-hand shops, and the like abound. Tourists, people-watchers, buskers, and students from Providence's six colleges make the scene. Half a mile south of campus is Thayer Street's hipper cousin, [[Wickenden Street]]. More picturesque and with older architecture, it features galleries, pubs, specialty shops, artist-supply stores, and a regionally famous coffee shop that doubles as a film set (for [[Woody Allen]] and others).
[[File:Game_at_Brown_Stadium,_Providence_Rhode_Island.jpg|thumb|Football game between Brown and [[Cornell University]] at Brown Stadium]]
[[Brown Stadium]], which was built in 1925 and is home to the football team, is located approximately a mile to the northeast of the main campus. Marston Boathouse, the home of the crew teams, lies on the Blackstone/Seekonk River, to the southeast of campus. Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School is situated in the historic [[Jewelry District (Providence)|Jewelry District of Providence]], near the medical campus of Brown's teaching hospitals, [[Rhode Island Hospital]], [[Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island|Women and Infants Hospital]], and Hasbro Children's Hospital. Other university research facilities in the Jewelry District include the Laboratories for Molecular Medicine.

Brown's School of Public Health occupies a landmark modernist building overlooking Memorial Park on the Providence Riverwalk. Brown also owns {{convert|376|acre|km2|adj=on}} the [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)|Mount Hope Grant]] in Bristol, Rhode Island, an important [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[King Philip's War]] site. Brown's [[Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology]] Collection Research Center, particularly strong in Native American items, is located in the Mount Hope Grant.

==Academics==

===The College===
{{Main|College of Brown University}}
Founded in 1764, the college is the oldest school of Brown University. About 7,200 undergraduate students are currently enrolled in the college, and 81 concentrations (majors) are offered. Completed concentrations of undergraduates by area are social sciences 42 percent, humanities 26 percent, life sciences 17 percent, and physical sciences 14 percent.<ref name="brown.edu">{{cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Institutional_Research/documents/QuickReference09-10.pdf|title=Home|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=October 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010151729/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Institutional_Research/documents/QuickReference09-10.pdf|archive-date=October 10, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The concentrations with the greatest number of students are Biology, History, and International Relations. Brown is one of the few schools in the United States with an undergraduate concentration (major) in [[Egyptology]]. Undergraduates can also design an independent concentration if the existing programs do not align with their curricular focus.

35 percent of undergraduates pursue graduate or professional study immediately, 60 percent within 5 years, and 80 percent within 10 years.<ref name="admit-facts">{{cite web |author=Brown University |url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/factsandfigures.html |title=Brown University Office of Admission facts and figures |publisher=Brown.edu |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606233934/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/admission/gettoknowus/factsandfigures.html |archive-date=June 6, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> For the Class of 1998, 75 percent of all graduates have since enrolled in a graduate or professional degree program.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Institutional_Research/documents/UndergraduateOutcomes2008.pdf|title=Home|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=October 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010151717/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Institutional_Research/documents/UndergraduateOutcomes2008.pdf|archive-date=October 10, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The degrees acquired were doctoral 22 percent, master's 35 percent, medicine 28 percent, and law 14 percent.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Brown/RISD Dual Degree Program===
Brown's near neighbor on College Hill is the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (RISD). Brown and RISD students can cross-register at the two institutions, with Brown students permitted to take as many as four courses at RISD that count towards a Brown degree. The two institutions partner to provide various student-life services and the two student bodies compose a synergy in the College Hill cultural scene.

After several years of discussion between the two institutions and several students pursuing dual degrees unofficially, Brown and RISD formally established a five-year dual degree program in 2007, with the first class matriculating in the fall of 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2007-08/07-013.html|title=07-013 (Brown/RISD Joint Degree)|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2018-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818025835/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2007-08/07-013.html|archive-date=August 18, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> The Brown/RISD Dual Degree Program, among the most selective in the country, offered admission to 19 of the 707 applicants for the class entering in autumn 2018, an acceptance rate of 2.7 percent.<ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite web|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/03/admission|title=News from Brown - With record applications, Brown admits 2,566 to Class of 2022|website=www.brown.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504155559/https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/03/admission|archive-date=May 4, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It combines the complementary strengths of the two institutions, integrating studio art and design at RISD with the entire spectrum of Brown's departmental offerings. Students are admitted to the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree from Brown and the Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must apply to the two schools separately and be accepted by separate admissions committees. Their application must then be approved by a third Brown/RISD joint committee.

Admitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD completing its first-year Experimental and Foundation Studies curriculum, while taking up to three Brown classes. The second year is spent in residence at Brown, during which students take mainly Brown courses while starting on their RISD major requirements. In the third, fourth, and fifth years, students can elect to live at either school or off-campus, and course distribution is determined by the requirements of each student's unique combination of Brown concentration and RISD major. Program participants are noted for their creative and original approach to cross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example, industrial design with engineering, or anatomical illustration with human biology, or philosophy with sculpture, or architecture with urban studies. An annual "BRDD Exhibition" is a well-publicized and heavily attended event, drawing interest and attendees from the wider world of industry, design, the media, and the fine arts.

===Theatre and playwriting===
Brown's theatre and playwriting programs are among the best-regarded in the country. Since 2003, eight different Brown graduates have either won (five times) or been nominated for (six times) the [[Pulitzer Prize]]—including winners [[Lynn Nottage]] '86 (twice—2009, 2017), [[Ayad Akhtar]] '93, [[Nilo Cruz]] '94, [[Quiara Alegría Hudes]] '04, [[Jackie Sibblies Drury]] MFA '04; and nominees [[Sarah Ruhl]] '97 (twice), [[Gina Gionfriddo]] '97 (twice), [[Stephen Karam]] '02, and [[Jordan Harrison]] '03. In ''American Theater'' magazine's 2009 ranking of the most-produced American plays, Brown graduates occupied four of the top five places—Peter Nachtrieb '97, Rachel Sheinkin '89, Sarah Ruhl '97, and Stephen Karam '02.<ref>Kathy Borchers, "Brown University turning out one exceptional playwright after another," Associated Press (''Providence Journal''), December 18, 2009; {{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/most-produced-plays |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903071900/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/most-produced-plays |archive-date=September 3, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/news/2019-04-15/pulitzer|title=Brown alumna, emeritus faculty member capture Pulitzers for drama, poetry {{!}} Brown University|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2019-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416045850/https://www.brown.edu/news/2019-04-15/pulitzer|archive-date=April 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The undergraduate concentration (major) encompasses programs in theatre history, performance theory, playwriting, dramaturgy, acting, directing, dance, speech, and technical production. Applications for doctoral and master's degree programs are made through the University Graduate School. Master's degrees in acting and directing are pursued in conjunction with the Brown/Trinity Rep MFA program, which partners with one of the country's great regional theatres, [[Trinity Repertory Company]], home of the last longstanding resident acting company in the country.<ref>Molly Lederer, "Trinity Rep is still shining after 50 years," ''East Side Monthly'', Oct. 2013, p. 17</ref> Trinity Rep's present artistic director [[Curt Columbus]] succeeded [[Oskar Eustis]] in 2006, when Eustis was chosen to lead New York's [[The Public Theater|Public Theater]].

The many performance spaces available to Brown students include the Chace and Dowling theaters at Trinity Rep; the McCormack Family, Lee Strasberg, Rites and Reason, Ashamu Dance, Stuart, and Leeds theatres in university departments; the Upstairs Space and Downstairs Space belonging to the wholly student-run [[Production Workshop]]; and Alumnae Hall, used by Brown University Gilbert & Sullivan and by [[Brown Opera Productions]]. Production design courses utilize the John Street Studio of [[Eugene Lee (designer)|Eugene Lee]], three-time [[Tony Award]]-winner

===Writing programs===
Writing at Brown—fiction, non-fiction, poetry, playwriting, screenwriting, electronic writing, mixed media, and the undergraduate writing proficiency requirement—is catered for by various centers and degree programs, and a faculty that has long included nationally and internationally known authors. The undergraduate concentration (major) in literary arts offers courses in fiction, poetry, screenwriting, literary hypermedia, and translation. Graduate programs include the fiction and poetry MFA writing programs in the literary arts department, and the MFA playwriting program in the theatre arts and performance studies department. The non-fiction writing program is offered in the English department. Screenwriting and cinema narrativity courses are offered in the departments of literary arts and modern culture and media. The undergraduate writing proficiency requirement is supported by the Writing Center.

===Author prizewinners===
Alumni authors take their degrees across the spectrum of degree concentrations, but a gauge of the strength of writing at Brown is the number of major national writing prizes won. To note only winners since the year 2000: [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]]-winners [[Jeffrey Eugenides]] '82 (2003), [[Marilynne Robinson]] '66 (2005), and [[Andrew Sean Greer]] '92 (2018); British [[Orange Prize]]-winners [[Marilynne Robinson]] '66 (2009) and [[Madeline Miller]] '00 (2012); [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]]-winners [[Nilo Cruz]] '94 (2003), [[Lynn Nottage]] '86 (twice, 2009, 2017), [[Quiara Alegría Hudes]] '04 (2012), and [[Ayad Akhtar]] '93 (2013); [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Pulitzer Prize for Biography]]-winners [[David Kertzer]] '69 (2015) and [[Benjamin Moser]] '98; [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize for Journalism]]-winners [[James Risen]] '77 (twice, 2002, 2006), [[Mark Maremont]] '80 (twice, 2003, 2007), [[Gareth Cook]] '91 (2005), [[Tony Horwitz]] '80 (2005), Peter Kovacs '77 (2006), Stephanie Grace '86 (2006), Mary Swerczek '98 (2006), Jane B.

[[File:Watson_Center_for_Information_Technology_(Brown).jpg|thumb|The Watson Center for Information Technology, built 1988, designed by [[Cambridge Seven Associates]]. It is named for Thomas J. Watson, Jr., Brown class of 1937, who led the global rise of [[IBM]].]]
Brown began offering computer science courses through the departments of Economics and Applied Mathematics in 1956 when it acquired an IBM machine. Brown added an [[IBM 650]] in January 1958, the only one of its type between Hartford and Boston. In 1960, Brown opened its first dedicated computer building. The building, designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and opened on George Street, received an [[IBM 7070]] computer the next year. Brown granted computer sciences full Departmental status in 1979. In 2009, IBM and Brown announced the installation of a supercomputer (by teraflops standards), the most powerful in the southeastern New England region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2009/11/supercomputer|title=Brown, IBM Unveil Multimillion-Dollar Supercomputer - News from Brown|work=brown.edu|accessdate=July 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724123003/https://news.brown.edu/articles/2009/11/supercomputer|archive-date=July 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 1960s, [[Andries van Dam]] along with [[Ted Nelson]], and [[Bob Wallace]] invented The [[Hypertext Editing System]]s, [[Hypertext Editing System|HES]] and [[FRESS]] while at Brown. Nelson coined the word ''[[hypertext]]''. Van Dam's students helped originate [[XML]], [[XSLT]], and related Web standards. Other Brown alumni have distinguished themselves in the computer sciences. They include a principal architect of the [[Classic Mac OS]], a principal architect of the [[Intel 80386]] microprocessor line, the [[Windows 95|Microsoft Windows 95]] project chief, a CEO of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], the former head of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], the inaugural chair of the [[Computing Community Consortium]], and design chiefs at [[Pixar]] and [[Industrial Light & Magic]], protegees of graphics guru [[Andries van Dam]]. The character "Andy" in the animated film ''Toy Story'' is taken to be an homage to Van Dam from his students employed at Pixar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/trivia|title=IMDB trivia for Toy Story page|work=IMDb|accessdate=October 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413141839/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/trivia|archive-date=April 13, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Van Dam denies this, but a copy of his book (''Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice'') appears on Andy's bookshelf in the film. Brown computer science graduate and ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' actor [[Masi Oka]] '97, was an animator at [[Industrial Light & Magic]].

The department today is home to [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|The CAVE]]. This project is a [[virtual reality]] room used for everything from three-dimensional drawing classes to tours of the [[circulatory system]] for medical students. In 2000, students from Brown's Technology House converted the south face of the Sciences Library into a [[Tetris]] game, the first high-rise-building Tetris ever attempted. Code named La Bastille, the game used a [[personal computer]] running [[Linux]], a radio-frequency video game controller, eleven circuit boards, a 12-story data network, and over 10,000 Christmas lights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bastilleweb.techhouse.org/ |title=La Bastille: A Tech House Art Installation |publisher=Bastilleweb.techhouse.org |date=April 14, 2000 |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412124533/http://bastilleweb.techhouse.org/ |archive-date=April 12, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macobserver.com/news/00/april/000425/wozontetris.shtml |title=Play Tetris On A Building Wall ...

===The Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World===
The [[Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World]] pursues fieldwork and excavations, regional surveys, and academic study of the archaeology and art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, and Western Asia from the Levant to the Caucasus. The institute has a very active fieldwork profile, with faculty-led excavations and regional surveys presently in Petra, Jordan, in West-Central Turkey, at Abydos in Egypt, and in Sudan, Italy, Mexico, Guatemala, Montserrat in the West Indies, and Providence, Rhode Island.

The institute's faculty includes cross-appointments from the departments of Egyptology, Assyriology, Classics, Anthropology, and History of Art and Architecture. Faculty research and publication areas include Greek and Roman art and architecture, landscape archaeology, urban and religious architecture of the Levant, Roman provincial studies, the Aegean Bronze Age, and the archaeology of the Caucasus. The institute offers visiting teaching appointments and postdoctoral fellowships which have, in recent years, included Near Eastern Archaeology and Art, Classical Archaeology and Art, Islamic Archaeology and Art, and Archaeology and Media Studies.

'''Egyptology and Assyriology'''

Facing the Joukowsky Institute, across the Front Green, is the Department of Egyptology and Assyriology, formed in 2006 by the merger of Brown's renowned departments of Egyptology and History of Mathematics. It is one of only a handful of such departments in the United States. The curricular focus is on three principal areas: Egyptology (the study of the ancient languages, history, and culture of Egypt), Assyriology (the study of the ancient lands of present-day Iraq, Syria, and Turkey), and the history of the ancient exact sciences (astronomy, astrology, and mathematics). Many courses in the department are open to all Brown undergraduates without prerequisite, and include archaeology, languages, history, and Egyptian and Mesopotamian religions, literature, and science. Students concentrating (majoring) in the department choose a track of either Egyptology or Assyriology. Graduate level study comprises three tracks to the doctoral degree: Egyptology, Assyriology, or the History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity.

The institute's curricular interest is organized into the principal themes of development, security, and governance—with further focuses on globalization, economic uncertainty, security threats, environmental degradation, and poverty. Three Brown undergraduate concentrations (majors) are hosted by the Watson Institute—Development Studies, International Relations, and Public Policy. Graduate programs offered at the Watson Institute include the Graduate Program in Development (Ph.D.) and the Public Policy Program (M.P.A). The institute also offers Post Doctoral, professional development and global outreach programming. In support of these programs, the Institute houses various centers, including the Brazil Initiative, Brown-India Initiative, China Initiative, Middle East Studies center, The Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) and the Taubman Center for Public Policy. In recent years, the most internationally cited product of the Watson Institute has been its [[Casualties of the Iraq War|Costs of War Project]], first released in 2011 and continuously updated. The Project comprises a team of economists, anthropologists, political scientists, legal experts, and physicians, and seeks to calculate the economic costs, human casualties, and impact on civil liberties of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan since 2001.

===The School of Engineering===
{{main|Brown University School of Engineering}}
[[File:Brown_University_Engineering_Research_Center.jpg|thumb|The Brown University Engineering Research Center, completed in 2018 and designed by [[KieranTimberlake]]]]
Established in 1847, Brown's engineering program is the oldest in the Ivy League and the third oldest civilian engineering program in the country, preceded only by [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (1824) and [[Union College]] (1845). In 1916, the departments of electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering were merged into a Division of Engineering, and in 2010 the division was elevated to a School of Engineering.

Engineering at Brown is especially interdisciplinary. The School is organized without the traditional departments or boundaries found at most schools, and follows a model of connectivity between disciplines—including biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, the humanities and the social sciences. The School practices an innovative clustering of faculties in which engineers team with non-engineers to bring a convergence of ideas.

===IE Brown Executive MBA Dual Degree Program===
Since 2009, Brown has developed an Executive MBA program in conjunction with one of the leading Business Schools in Europe; [[IE Business School]] in Madrid. This relationship has since strengthened resulting in both institutions offering a dual degree program.<ref>{{cite web |author= Brown's website |date= October 2014 |url= https://brown.edu/professional/executive/iebrown-mba/ |title= IE Brown Executive MBA |publisher= Brown University News Service |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141107114344/http://brown.edu/professional/executive/iebrown-mba/ |archive-date= November 7, 2014 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref> In this partnership, Brown provides its traditional coursework while IE provides most of the business-related subjects making a differentiated alternative program to other Ivy League's EMBAs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Patrick|title=Brown University Gets Into the MBA Game|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-05-23/brown-university-gets-into-the-mba-game|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=9 March 2015|date=May 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308052742/http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-05-23/brown-university-gets-into-the-mba-game|archive-date=March 8, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The cohort typically consists of 25-30 EMBA candidates from some 20 countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iebrown.com/faqs.php |title=IE Brown Executive MBA - Faqs - IE Brown Executive MBA |work=iebrown.com |accessdate=July 24, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217091212/http://www.iebrown.com/faqs.php |archive-date=December 17, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>

===The Pembroke Center===
{{Main|Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women}}
The Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women was established at Brown in 1981 by [[Joan Wallach Scott]] as a research center on gender. It was named for Pembroke College, the former women's coordinate college at Brown, and is affiliated with Brown's [[Sarah Doyle Women's Center]]. It supports the undergraduate concentration in [[Gender]] and [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]] Studies, post-doctoral research fellowships, the annual Pembroke Seminar, and other academic programs. The center also manages various collections, archives, and resources, including the Elizabeth Weed Feminist Theory Papers and the Christine Dunlap Farnham Archive.

===The Graduate School===
{{Main|Brown University Graduate School}}
Established in 1887, the Graduate School has around 2,000 students studying over 50 disciplines. 20 different [[master's degrees]] are offered as well as [[Ph.D.]] degrees in over 40 subjects ranging from [[applied mathematics]] to [[public policy]]. Overall, admission to the Graduate School is most competitive with an acceptance rate of about 10 percent.

===Alpert Medical School===
{{Main|Alpert Medical School}}
[[File:Alpert_Medical_School,_Providence,_Rhode_Island.jpg|thumb|The [[Alpert Medical School]] building on Richmond Street]]The university's medical program started in 1811, but the school was suspended by President Wayland in 1827 after the program's faculty declined to live on campus (a new requirement under Wayland). In 1975, the first M.D. degrees from the new Program in Medicine were awarded to a graduating class of 58 students. In 1991, the school was officially renamed the Brown University School of Medicine, then renamed once more to Brown Medical School in October 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://med.brown.edu/timeline/ |title=History of the Brown Medical School |publisher=Med.brown.edu |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504102538/http://med.brown.edu/timeline/ |archive-date=May 4, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In January 2007, Warren Alpert donated $100 million to Brown Medical School, in recognition of which its name was changed to the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

In 2020, ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' ranked Brown's medical school the 9th most selective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 2.8 percent.<ref name=usnews.com>{{cite web|last1=Smith-Barrow|first1=Delece|title=10 Medical Schools With the Lowest Acceptance Rates|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/the-short-list-grad-school/articles/2014/03/27/10-medical-schools-with-the-lowest-acceptance-rates|publisher=U.S. News and World Report LP|date=March 27, 2014|access-date=August 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316192021/http://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/the-short-list-grad-school/articles/2014/03/27/10-medical-schools-with-the-lowest-acceptance-rates|archive-date=March 16, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
''U.S. News'' ranks it 38th for research and 35th for primary care.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/primary-care-rankings?int=af3309&int=b3b50a&int=aac509 |title=Best Medical Schools (Primary Care) Ranked in 2019 - US News Rankings |publisher=Grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |accessdate=December 15, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808235910/https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/primary-care-rankings?int=af3309&int=b3b50a&int=aac509 |archive-date=August 8, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The medical school is known especially for its eight-year [[Program in Liberal Medical Education]] (PLME), inaugurated in 1984. One of the most selective and renowned programs of its type in the country, it offered admission to 90 of the 2,290 applicants for the class entering in autumn 2015, an acceptance rate of 3.9 percent.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Since 1976, the Early Identification Program (EIP) has encouraged Rhode Island residents to pursue careers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from [[Providence College]], [[Rhode Island College]], the [[University of Rhode Island]], and [[Tougaloo College]]. In 2004, the school once again began to accept applications from premedical students at other colleges and universities via [[AMCAS]] like most other medical schools. The medical school also offers combined degree programs leading to the M.D./[[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], M.D./[[Master of Public Health|M.P.H.]] and M.D./[[Master of Public Policy|M.P.P.]] degrees.

===Online Programs===
The Brown University School of Professional Studies currently offers [[blended learning]] Executive master's degrees in Healthcare Leadership, Cyber Security, and Science and Technology Leadership.<ref>{{citation|title=Brown School of Professional Studies|url=https://professional.brown.edu/|accessdate=May 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413123935/https://professional.brown.edu/|archive-date=April 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The master's degrees are designed to help students who have a job and life outside of academia to progress in their respective fields. The students meet in [[Providence, RI]] every 6–7 weeks for a week seminar each trimester.

The university has also invested in [[MOOC]] development starting in 2013, when two courses, ''Archeology's Dirty Little Secrets'' and ''The Fiction of Relationship'', both of which received thousands of students.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brown launches two free online courses|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2013/06/coursera|accessdate=May 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514141420/https://news.brown.edu/articles/2013/06/coursera|archive-date=May 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> However, after a year of courses, the university broke its contract with [[Coursera]] and revamped its online persona and MOOC development department. By 2017, the university released new courses on [[EdX|edx]], two of which were ''The Ethics of Memory'' and ''Artful Medicine: Art's Power to Enrich Patient Care''. In January 2018, Brown published its first "game-ified" course called '' Fantastic Places, Unhuman Humans: Exploring Humanity Through Literature'', which featured out of platform games to help learners understand materials, as well as a story-line that immerses users into a fictional world to help characters along their journey.<ref>{{citation|title=BrownX|url=https://www.edx.org/school/brownx|accessdate=May 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514065004/https://www.edx.org/school/brownx|archive-date=May 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Campus safety===
In 2014, Brown University tied with the University of Connecticut for the highest number of reported rapes in the nation, with its "total of reports of rape" on their main campus standing at 43.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/06/07/these-colleges-have-the-most-reports-of-rape/|title=These colleges have the most reports of rape|first=Nick|last=Anderson|date=June 7, 2016|via=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=June 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609215517/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/06/07/these-colleges-have-the-most-reports-of-rape/|archive-date=June 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Spring weekend===
The weekend includes an annual spring concert festival that has featured numerous famous artists.

=== Residential and Greek societies ===
[[File:Taft_House.jpg|thumb|King House is home to the Brown chapter of [[St. Anthony Hall]]]]
About 12 percent of Brown students are in fraternities and sororities. There are 11 residential Greek houses: six fraternities (Beta Rho Pi, [[Delta Phi]], Delta Tau, [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Sigma Chi]], and [[Theta Delta Chi]]; four sororities ([[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], [[Delta Gamma]], and [[Kappa Delta]]), one co-ed house ([[Zeta Delta Xi]]), and one co-ed literary society ([[Alpha Delta Phi Society|Alpha Delta Phi]]). [[Phi Sigma Kappa]] fraternity was present on campus from 1906 to 1939, but was unable to reactivate after World War II due to wartime losses.<ref name="ATPS">{{cite book |last1= Rand |first1= Frank Prentice |last2= Watts |first2= Ralph |last3= Sefton |first3= James E. |title= All The Phi Sigs – A History |publisher= Grand Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa |year= 1993}}</ref> All recognized Greek-letter organizations are located on campus in Wriston Quadrangle in university-owned housing. They are overseen by the Greek Council.

An alternative to Greek-letter organizations are the program houses organized by themes. As with Greek houses, the residents of program houses select their new members, usually at the start of the spring semester. Examples of program houses are [[St. Anthony Hall]] (located in King House), Buxton International House, the Machado [[French language|French]]/[[Hispanic]]/Latinx House, Technology House, Harambee (African culture) House, Social Action House and [[Interfaith]] House.

Currently,{{When|date=May 2017}} there are three student cooperative houses at Brown. Two of them, Watermyn and Finlandia on Waterman Street, are owned by the [[Brown Association for Cooperative Housing]] (BACH), a non-profit corporation owned by its members. The third co-op, West House, is located in a Brown-owned house on Brown Street. The three organizations run a vegetarian co-op for the larger community.

All students not in program housing enter a lottery for general housing. Students form groups and are assigned time slots during which they can pick among the remaining housing options.

=== Societies and clubs ===
[[File:Ladd_Observatory_at_Brown.jpg|thumb|[[Ladd Observatory]], built 1890–1891, is used by Brown Space Engineering, a student group focused on [[Aerospace engineering]]]]
The earliest societies at Brown were devoted to oration and debate. The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of [[Solomon Drowne]], class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771. It seems to have disappeared during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. We next hear of the Misokosmian Society, founded in 1794 and renamed the Philermenian Society in 1798. This was effectively a secret society with membership limited to 45. It met fortnightly to hear speeches and debate and thrived until the Civil War; in 1821 its library held 1594 volumes. In 1799, a chapter of the Philandrian Society, also secret, was established at the college. In 1806, the United Brothers was formed as an egalitarian alternative to the Philermenian Society. "These two great rivals," says the university historian, "divided the student body between them for many years, surviving into the days of President Sears. A tincture of political controversy sharpened their rivalry, the older society inclining to the aristocratic Federals, the younger to the Republicans, the democrats of that day. ... The students continuing to increase in number, they outran the constitutional limits of both societies, and a third, the Franklin Society, was established in 1824; it never had the vitality of the other two, however, and died after ten years."<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 181.</ref> Other nineteenth century clubs and societies, too numerous to treat here, are described in Bronson's history of the university.<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 120, 147–148, 180–182, 239–244, 348–349 & 483–484.</ref>

[[File:BrownUniversity-Poster1914.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.75|The sesquicentennial poster]]
The Cammarian Club—founded in 1893 and taking its name from the Latin for lobster, its members' favorite dinner food—was at first a semi-secret society which "tapped" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the Club served as the ''de facto'' undergraduate student government. In 1971, unaccountably, it voted the name Cammarian Club out of existence, thereby amputating its tradition and longevity. The successor and present-day organization is the generically-named Undergraduate Council of Students.

[[Societas Domi Pacificae]], known colloquially as "Pacifica House," is a present-day, self-described secret society, which nonetheless publishes a website and an email address. It claims a continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824, citing a supposed intermediary "Franklin Society" traceable in the nineteenth century. But the intermediary turns out to be, on closer inspection, the well-known Providence Franklin Society, a civic organization unconnected to Brown whose origins and activity are well-documented. It was founded in 1821 by merchants William Grinnell and Joseph Balch, Jr., and chartered by the General Assembly in January 1823.<ref>Rhode Island Historical Society, "Providence Franklin Society Records, 1826-1922," published online at [http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss162.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091221/http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss162.htm |date=September 24, 2015 }}</ref> The "Pacifica House" account of this (conflated) Franklin Society cites published mentions of it in 1859, 1876, and 1883. But the first of these (Rhees 1859, see footnote ''infra'') is merely a sketch of the 1824 Brown organization; the second (Stockwell 1876) is a reference-book article on the Providence Franklin Society itself; and the third is the Providence Franklin Society's own publication, which the "Pacifica House" reference mis-ascribes to the "Franklin Society," dropping the word "Providence."<ref>The three cited items of "evidence" in Pacifica House publicity are William J. Rhees, ''Manual of Public Libraries, Institutions and Societies in the United States'' (Philadelphia, 1859), pp. 437-8; Thomas B. Stockwell, ''A History of Public Education in Rhode Island, from 1636 to 1876'' (Providence, 1876), p. 246; and Providence Franklin Society, ''Report on the Geology of Rhode Island'' (Providence, 1887, commissioned 1883), for which see, e.g., ''Bulletin of the United States Geological Survey'', no. 127 (Washington, 1896), p. 821)</ref>

Brown University has several resource centers on campus. The centers often act as sources of support as well as safe spaces for students to explore certain aspects of their identity. Additionally, the centers often provide physical spaces for students to study and have meetings. Although most centers are identity-focused, some provide academic support as well.

The [[Brown Center for Students of Color]] (BCSC) is a space that provides support for students [[People of color|of color]]. Established in 1972 at the demand of student protests, the BCSC encourages students to engage in critical dialogue, develop leadership skills, and promote [[social justice]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/students-of-color/about/frequently-asked-questions-faqs|website=Brown Center for Students of Color|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=November 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123094123/http://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/students-of-color/about/frequently-asked-questions-faqs|archive-date=November 23, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The center houses various programs for students to share their knowledge and engage in discussion. Programs include the Third World Transition Program, the Minority Peer Counselor Program, the Heritage Series, and other student-led initiatives. Additionally, the BCSC hopes to foster community among the students it serves by providing spaces for students to meet and study.

The [[Sarah Doyle Women's Center]] aims to provide a space for members of the Brown community to examine and explore issues surrounding [[gender]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Sarah Doyle Women's Center|url=https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/sarah-doyle-center/|website=Sarah Doyle Women's Center|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=November 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202235132/http://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/sarah-doyle-center/|archive-date=December 2, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The center was named after one of the first women to attend Brown University, [[Sarah Doyle]].

=== Activism ===
====The 1968 Black Student Walkout====
On December 5th of 1968, several Black women from Pembroke College initiated a walkout in protest an atmosphere at the colleges described by Black students as a “stifling, frustrating, [and] degrading place for Black students” after feeling the colleges were non-responsive to their concerns. In total, 65 Black students participated in the walk out. Their principal demand was to increase Black student enrollment to 11% of the student populace, in an attempt to match that of the proportion in the US. This ultimately resulted in a 300% increase in Black enrollment the following year, but some demands have yet to be met.<ref>{{Cite web|title=TWC History at Brown {{!}} Brown Center for Students of Color|url=https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/students-of-color/history|access-date=2020-09-08|website=www.brown.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Podugu|first=Trisha Thacker,Katherine Bennett,Priyanka|date=2018-12-07|title=Students commemorate legacy, impact of 1968 walkout|url=https://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/12/07/students-commemorate-legacy-impact-1968-walkout/|access-date=2020-09-08|website=Brown Daily Herald|language=en-US}}</ref>
