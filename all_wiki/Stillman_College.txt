==History==
[[File:Stillman Institute (Main Building) in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, 1914.jpg|thumb|right|The Main Building in 1914.]]
Stillman College, authorized by the General Assembly of the [[Presbyterian Church]] in the United States in 1875,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.stillman.edu/index.php/about-us/history-and-mission|title=stillman.edu - History and Mission|website=www.stillman.edu|access-date=2016-10-22}}</ref> held its first classes in 1876 and was chartered as a legal corporation by the State of Alabama in 1895. At that time, the name was changed from Tuscaloosa Institute to Stillman Institute. The institute was a concept initiated by the Reverend Dr. Charles Allen Stillman, pastor of First Presbyterian Church of Tuscaloosa, "for the training of colored men for the ministry".<ref>{{cite book |title=Where to educate, 1898-1899. A guide to the best private schools, higher institutions of learning, etc., in the United States |last=Thomas |first=Grace Powers |year=1898 |publisher=Brown and Company |location=Boston |page=4 |accessdate=August 17, 2012 |url=https://archive.org/stream/wheretoeducate1800thomrich#page/4/mode/1up}}</ref>  The mandate for the Institution expanded over the years and it acquired its present campus tract of over {{convert|100|acre|km2}}. A junior and senior high school was organized and the Institute established a junior college program, which was accredited in 1937. In addition, between 1930 and 1946, it operated a hospital and nurse training school. 
[[File:Stillman College Library students.jpg|thumb|right|The Stillman College library.]]
Under the administration of Dr. Samuel Burney Hay (1948–1965), the school sought to expand into a senior liberal arts institution and in 1948 the name was officially changed to Stillman College. The following year, Stillman expanded into a four-year college and graduated its first baccalaureate class in 1951. The college was accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] in 1953.<ref name=":1" /> Under Dr. Hay, seven new buildings were constructed: a gymnasium, a library, an administration-classroom building, two women's residence halls, a prayer chapel, and a student center.

When John Rice became the Dean of Students at Stillman College in 1966, he lived on campus with his wife and daughter, [[Condoleezza Rice]], who later served as the 66th [[United States Secretary of State]].<ref name="tuscaloosanewshortoneducatorsrecall">{{cite news|last1=Horton|first1=Ebony|title=Stillman College educators recall Rice's ties to town|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/DA/20041206/news/606118308/TL/|accessdate=January 1, 2018|work=The Tuscaloosa News|date=December 6, 2004|quote=Rice moved from Titusville, near Birmingham, to Tuscaloosa in 1966 when her father, John Rice, became the dean of students at Stillman. The family resided on campus in a brick home behind Hay Residence Hall, while Rice, then 11, attended what is now Central High School.}}</ref>
 
Dr. Harold N. Stinson (1967–1980) was the first African American to assume the presidency. Under his dynamic leadership, new programs designed to improve educational quality were instituted, and the physical plant was expanded with the addition of two men's residence halls, faculty apartments, a maintenance building, and a mathematics-science center. Snedecor Hall, Batchelor Building, and Birthright Auditorium were renovated.

Constance M. Rizzi (1974–1978) was the 1st non-black (Italian American)graduate of Stillman College in 1978. Recruited out of Woodrow Wilson High School, Beckley, West Virginia by Samuel Merriweather, she was also the 1st non-black cheerleader; the 1st non-black Associate Editor of the campus newspaper, "The Tiger's Paw;" and one of the original founders of the Stillman College Dance Team (CADA) under the direction of Dr. Betty Smith. After graduating from Stillman, she went on to serve in the United States Army, worked for the federal government and in government contracting for Lockheed Martin as an IT Project Manager. Later, while serving in the Army National Guard, she was an instructor at the DC Military Academy. She has a Masters in Human Environmental Services from The University of Alabama and also a Graduate Certificate in Consumer Conflict Management, she earned a 2nd Masters from Central Michigan University. She is an active member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated. Currently, she is a licensed Realtor of 17 years.
 
Under the leadership of the college's fourth president, Dr. Cordell Wynn (1982–1997), the appearance of the campus improved dramatically; Winsborough and John Knox Halls were renovated; and the Marie Lundy Wynn Hall and Johnson/Robinson Student Health Center were erected. The enrollment grew beyond 1,000 students; the endowment increased significantly; and the educational program was broadened to include the Stillman Management Institute and a community-service component.

On July 1, 1997, Dr. Ernest McNealey (1997–2013) was named the fifth president. During his tenure, Stillman garnered national attention in the areas of technology, athletics and scholarly pursuits. One of the leaders in wireless computing, the college received the National Innovation in Technology Award by Apple Computers and continues to be on the cusp of technological innovations in higher education. The college's football program and marching band were revitalized and the College experienced its largest enrollment in the history of the institution. Dr. McNealey infused new life into the academic component by strengthening the curriculum, and attracting a highly qualified faculty, improving admissions standards, and enhancing the value of a Stillman education with the addition of guaranteed outcome programs. In 2004 the college received its first-ever ranking among top-tier schools in U.S. News & World Report.  During Dr. McNealey's tenure, four new structures were erected (School of Education building, Wynn Fine Arts Center, Roulhac Residence Hall, and the stadium with accompanying playing fields, buildings, and an NCAA regulation track). The sense of place was further manifested in the  construction of the Thomas E. Lyle Band Center and NCAA regulation tennis complex.

On June 26, 2014 at a press conference in Birthright Alumni Hall, Stillman Board of Trustees named interim president Dr. Peter E. Millet the sixth president of the school.  In August 2014, Stillman was awarded a donation of $2 million by an unknown donor to help with the long term stability of the college.  On December 29, 2014 President Dr. Peter E. Millet announced via school email that tuition for the small liberal arts school would be reduced from $22,500 to $17,500 in an effort to boost enrollment and make college more affordable.  On January 1, 2015, Stillman became a smoke-free campus in an effort to keep with its theme of promoting a healthier lifestyle.  In December 2015, Stillman cut its current sports from 12 to 2. Currently, Stillman has four intercollegiate sports teams, Men's and Women's Basketball, Baseball, and Softball.[[File:Dr. Cynthia Warrick.jpg|thumb|Dr. Cynthia Warrick at SGA Installation in September 2018]]
On December 14, 2016 Stillman College Board of Trustees announced the appointment of Dr. Cynthia Warrick as the new Interim President for Stillman College. She took office on January 3, 2017.  On April 24, 2017 Dr. Cynthia Warrick (2017-) was named the seventh president and the first female president of Stillman College. Dr. Warrick is a native of San Antonio, Texas and graduated from Howard University with the Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy, and completed the Masters of Science in Public Policy from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Doctorate in Environmental Science & Public Policy from George Mason University. With over 20 years of service in higher education through the faculty ranks, administrative and executive positions, Dr. Warrick's focus is on connecting students and the college to opportunities that advance academic excellence, degree completion, admissions into graduate and professional schools and fruitful careers.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
