'''Gerald Michael Boyd''' (October 3, 1950 &ndash; November 23, 2006) was an American [[journalist]] and editor. He was the first [[African Americans|African-American]] metropolitan editor and managing editor at ''[[The New York Times]]'', after joining the newspaper in 1983 in its Washington, D.C. bureau. A controversy in 2003 about the reporting of [[Jayson Blair]] forced both Boyd and the Executive Editor, [[Howell Raines]], to resign that year. 

Boyd had started his journalism career in 1973 at the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', in his hometown city, after graduating from the [[University of Missouri]]. In 1977 he and a colleague, George Curry, founded the Greater St. Louis Association of Black Journalists. In addition, they established a program to train black high school students in the business. Raines received a [[Nieman Fellowship]] in 1979.

He won a full [[scholarship]] to the [[University of Missouri]] sponsored by the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', which also guaranteed him a job after graduation.<ref name="boydobit"/>
