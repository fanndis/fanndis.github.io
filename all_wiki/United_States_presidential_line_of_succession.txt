{{Presidential orders of succession}}

The '''United States presidential line of succession''' is the [[order of succession|order]] in which officials of the [[United States]] [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] assume the powers and duties of the office of [[president of the United States]] if the [[incumbent]] president becomes [[Capacity (law)|incapacitated]], dies, resigns, or is removed from office. The [[order of succession]] specifies that the office passes to the [[vice president of the United States|vice president]]; if the vice presidency is simultaneously vacant, or if the vice president is also incapacitated, the powers and duties of the presidency pass to the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House of Representatives]], [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore of the Senate]], and then [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet secretaries]], depending on eligibility.

Presidential succession is referred to multiple times in the [[U.S. Constitution]]{{snd}}[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Vacancy and disability|Article II, Section 1, Clause 6]], as well as the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]], [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|20th Amendment]], and [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]]. The vice president is designated as first in the presidential line of succession by the Article II succession clause, which also authorizes [[United States Congress|Congress]] to provide for a line of succession beyond the vice president; it has done so on three occasions. The current [[Presidential Succession Act]] was adopted in 1947, and last revised in 2006. The 25th Amendment also establishes procedures for filling an intra-term vacancy in the office of the vice president. 

The Presidential Succession Act refers specifically to officers beyond the vice president [[Acting president of the United States|''acting as'' president]] rather than ''becoming'' president when filling a vacancy. The Cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the [[Secretary of State of the United States|secretary of state]] is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order of when their departments (or the department of which their department is the successor) were created. Those heads of department who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the president through succession, and skipped to the next in line. Since 1789, the vice president has succeeded to the presidency intra-term on nine occasions: eight times due to the incumbent's death, and once due to resignation. No one lower in the line of succession has ever been called upon to act as president.

Widely considered a settled issue during the late 20th century, the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]] demonstrated the potential for a [[decapitation strike]] that would kill or incapacitate multiple individuals in the presidential line of succession in addition to many members of Congress and the federal judiciary. In the years immediately following the attacks, numerous wide-ranging discussions were started, in Congress, among academics and within the public policy community about [[continuity of government]] concerns including the existing constitutional and statutory provisions governing presidential succession. These discussions remain ongoing. One effort put forward by the [[Continuity of Government Commission]], a [[Nonpartisanism in the United States|nonpartisan]] [[think tank]], produced three reports (2003, 2009 and 2011), the second of which focused on the implicit ambiguities and limitations in the current succession act, and contained recommendations for amending the laws for succession to the presidency.

== Constitutional provisions ==

=== Presidential eligibility ===
[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article II, Section 1, Clause 5]] of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency: they must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen]] of the United States, be at least 35 years of age and have been a [[Residency (domicile)#United States|resident in the United States]] for at least fourteen years.<ref>{{cite web | title=Article II.

=== Presidential succession ===

The presidential line of succession is mentioned in four places in the Constitution:

* Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 makes the vice president first in the line of succession and allows the [[United States Congress|Congress]] to provide by law for cases in which neither the president nor vice president can serve.<ref name=A2essayPS>{{cite web | last=Feerick | first=John | title=Essays on Article II: Presidential Succession | work=The Heritage Guide to the Constitution | url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/83/presidential-succession | publisher=The Heritage Foundation | accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref>
* The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]] provided that the vice president would also fill any vacancy of the presidency arising from failure of the House of Representatives to choose a president in a [[contingent election]].<ref name=Feerick2011FLR>{{cite journal | last=Feerick | first=John D. | date=2011 | title=Presidential Succession and Inability: Before and After the Twenty-Fifth Amendment | url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4695&context=flr | journal=Fordham Law Review | volume=79 | issue=3 | pages=907–949 | accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref>
* The [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|20th Amendment]], Section 3, supersedes the above 12th Amendment provision, by declaring that if the [[President-elect of the United States|president-elect]] dies before his term begins, the vice president-elect becomes president on [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]] and serves for the full term to which the president-elect was elected, and also that, if on Inauguration Day, a president has not been chosen or the president-elect does not qualify for the presidency, the vice president-elect acts as president until a president is chosen or the president-elect qualifies. It also authorizes Congress to provide for instances in which neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect have qualified.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Twentieth Amendment | last1=Larson | first1=Edward J. | last2=Shesol | first2=Jeff | url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xx | work=The Interactive Constitution | publisher=The National Constitution Center | location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | accessdate=June 15, 2018}}</ref>
* The [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]], Section 1, clarifies Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, by stating unequivocally that the vice president is the direct successor of the president, and becomes president if the incumbent dies, resigns or is removed from office. It also, in sections 3 and 4, provides for situations where the president is temporarily disabled, such as if the president has a surgical procedure or becomes mentally unfit, establishing procedures whereby the vice president can become acting president. Additionally, in Section 2, the amendment provides a mechanism for intra-term vice presidential succession, establishing that a [[Vice President of the United States#Vacancies|vice presidential vacancy]] will be filled by a president's nominee upon confirmation by a majority vote of both houses of Congress.{{efn-ua|This section 2 of the 25th Amendment has been invoked twice: {{Nowrap|1973—}}[[Gerald Ford]] was [[1973 United States vice presidential confirmation|nominated and confirmed]] to office following [[Spiro Agnew]]'s resignation. {{Nowrap|1974—}}[[Nelson Rockefeller]] was [[1974 United States vice presidential confirmation|nominated and confirmed]] to office after Gerald Ford became president upon [[Richard Nixon]]'s resignation.<ref name=CRSsuccession05>{{cite web | last=Neale | first=Thomas H. | title=Presidential and Vice Presidential Succession: Overview and Current Legislation | page=5 | work=CRS Report for Congress | url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL31761.pdf | publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]], the [[Library of Congress]] | location=Washington, D.C. | date=September 27, 2004 | accessdate=June 16, 2018}}</ref>}} Previously, whenever a vice president had succeeded to the presidency or had died or resigned from office, the vice presidency remained vacant until the next presidential and vice presidential terms began; there were 16 such vacancies prior to 1967.<ref name=NCC25th>{{cite web | title=The Twenty-fifth Amendment | last1=Kalt | first1=Brian C. | last2=Pozen | first2=David | url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxv | work=The Interactive Constitution | publisher=The National Constitution Center | location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | accessdate=June 15, 2018}}</ref>

== Succession acts ==
{{Main|Presidential Succession Act}}

===Act of 1792===
The Presidential Succession Act of 1792 ({{Cws | title=Full text | link=Presidential Succession Act 1792 | nobullet=yes}}) provided for succession after the president and vice president: first, the president pro tempore of the Senate, followed by the speaker of the House.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://time.com/4071416/house-speaker-presidential-succession/ | title=America's System for Presidential Succession is Ridiculous | last=Spivak | first=Joshua | date=October 14, 2015 | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> The statute provided that the presidential successor would serve in an acting capacity, holding office only until a new president could be elected.<ref name=CRS2005continuity>{{cite web | last=Relyea | first=Harold C. | title=Continuity of Government: Current Federal Arrangements and the Future | work=CRS Report for Congress | url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/secrecy/RS21089.pdf | publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]], the [[Library of Congress]] | location=Washington, D.C. | pages=2–4 | date=August 5, 2005 | accessdate=June 16, 2018}}</ref> A special election was to be held in November of the year in which dual vacancies occurred (unless the vacancies occurred after the first Wednesday in October, in which case the election would occur the following year; or unless the vacancies occurred within the last year of the presidential term, in which case the next election would take place as regularly scheduled). The persons elected president and vice president in such a special election would have served a full four-year term beginning on March 4 of the next year. No such election ever took place.

Various framers of the Constitution, such as [[James Madison]], criticized the arrangement as being contrary to their intent. The decision to build the line of succession around those two officials was made after a long and contentious debate. In addition to the president pro tempore and the speaker, both the secretary of state and the [[Chief Justice of the United States|chief justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] were also suggested. Including the secretary of state was unacceptable to most [[Federalist Party|Federalists]], who did not want the then secretary of state, [[Thomas Jefferson]], who had become the leader of the opposition [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]], to follow the vice president in the succession, and many objected to including the chief justice due to [[separation of powers]] concerns.<ref name=A2essayPS/><ref name=65FFH5762>{{cite book | title=From Failing Hands: the Story of Presidential Succession | last1=Feerick | first1=John D. | last2=Freund | first2=Paul A. | date=1965 | url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=twentyfifth_amendment_books | publisher=Fordham University Press | location=New York City | pages=57–62 | lccn=65-14917}}</ref>

===Act of 1886===
The Presidential Succession Act of 1886 ({{Cws | title=Full text | link=Presidential Succession Act 1886 | nobullet=yes}}) established succession to include the members of the president's cabinet in the order of the establishment of the various departments, beginning with the Secretary of State,{{efn-ua|Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of War, Attorney-General, Postmaster-General, Secretary of the Navy, and Secretary of the Interior.}} and stipulated that any official discharging the powers and duties of the presidency must possess the constitutional qualifications to hold the office.<ref name=CRS2005continuity/> The president pro tempore and speaker were excluded from the new line, and the provision mandating a special presidential election when a double vacancy arose was also dropped.

The need for increasing the number of presidential successors was abundantly clear to Congress, for twice within the span of four years it happened that there was no one in the presidential line of succession. In September 1881, when [[Chester A. Arthur]] succeeded to the presidency following [[James A. Garfield]]'s death, there was no vice president, no president pro tempore of the Senate, and no speaker of the House of Representatives.<ref name=Feerick2011FLR/> Then, in November 1885, [[Grover Cleveland]] faced a similar situation, following the death of Vice President [[Thomas A. Hendricks]], as the Senate and the House had not convened yet to elect new officers.<ref name="harpers">{{cite book | title=Harper's Book of Facts: a Classified History of the World; Embracing Science, Literature, and Art | last1=Lewis | first1=Charlton Thomas | last2=Willsey | first2=Joseph H. | year=1895 | publisher=Harper & Brothers | location=New York | page=884 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcwGAAAAYAAJ&q=country+without+any+one+in+the+line+of+succession&pg=PA884 | accessdate=April 24, 2011 | lccn=01020386}}</ref>

=== Act of 1947 ===
The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 ({{Cws | title=Full text | link=Presidential Succession Act 1947 | nobullet=yes}}), which was signed into law on July 18, 1947,<ref name=CRS2005continuity/> restored the speaker of the House and president pro tempore of the Senate to the line of succession—but in reverse-order from their 1792 positions—and placed them ahead of the members of the Cabinet, positioned, as before, in the order of the establishment of their department.<ref name=wftvAPOTUS/>{{efn-ua|Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of War, Attorney General, Postmaster General, Secretary of the Navy, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor.}} 

Placing the speaker and the president pro tempore (both elected officials) back in the succession and placing them ahead of cabinet members (all of whom are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate), was [[Harry S. Truman]]'s idea. Personally conveyed to Congress in June 1945, two months after becoming president upon [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s death, the proposal reflected Truman's belief that the president should not have the power to appoint to office "the person who would be my immediate successor in the event of my own death or inability to act," and that the presidency should, whenever possible, "be filled by an elective officer."<ref name=CRS2005continuity/><ref>{{cite web | last=Truman | first=Harry S. | title=Special Message to the Congress on the Succession to the Presidency | date=June 19, 1945 | others=Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

===Further amendments===
The 1947 Act has been modified several times, with changes being made as the face of the federal bureaucracy has changed over the ensuing years.

== Ambiguities regarding succession and inability ==
[[File:John Tyler.jpg|thumb | upright=.80|In April 1841, [[John Tyler]] became the first person to succeed to the presidency intra-term upon the death of [[William Henry Harrison]].]]
Although the Presidential Succession Clause in Article II of the Constitution clearly provided for the vice president to take over the "powers and duties" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability, left unclear was whether the vice president became president of the United States or simply [[Interim|temporarily acted]] as president in a case of succession.<ref name=A2essayPS/> Some historians, including [[Edward Samuel Corwin|Edward Corwin]] and [[John Feerick|John D. Feerick]],<ref name="Schlesinger"/> have argued that the framers' intention was that the vice president would remain vice president while executing the powers and duties of the presidency until a new president could be elected.<ref name=justiaPS>{{cite web | url=https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-2/05-presidential-succession.html | title=Presidential Succession | work=US Law | publisher=Justia | location=Mountain View, California | accessdate=June 15, 2018}}</ref>

The hypothetical debate about whether the office or merely the powers of the office devolve upon a vice president who succeeds to the presidency between elections became an urgent constitutional issue in 1841, when President William Henry Harrison died in office, only {{age in days|Mar 4, 1841|Apr 4, 1841}} days into his term. Vice President [[John Tyler]] claimed a constitutional mandate to carry out the full powers and duties of the presidency, asserting he was the president and not merely a temporary acting president, by taking the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath of office]].<ref name=JTDA>{{cite web | title=John Tyler: Domestic Affairs | last=Freehling | first=William | url=https://millercenter.org/president/tyler/domestic-affairs | publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia | location=Charllotesville, Virginia | accessdate=June 15, 2018}}</ref>

Even after the precedent regarding presidential succession due to the president's death was set, the part of the Presidential Succession Clause that provided for replacing a disabled president remained unclear. What constituted an "inability"? Who determined the existence of an inability? Did a vice president become president for the rest of the presidential term in the case of an inability; or was the vice president merely "acting as President"? Due to this lack of clarity, later vice presidents were hesitant to assert any role in cases of presidential inability.<ref name=XXVHeritage>{{cite web | title=Essays on Amendment XXV: Presidential Succession | work=The Heritage Guide to the Constitution | last=Feerick | first=John | url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/amendments/25/essays/187/presidential-succession | publisher=The Heritage Foundation | accessdate=June 22, 2018}}</ref> Two situations are noteworthy:

*  On July 2, 1881, [[James Garfield]] was shot; hit from behind by two bullets (one grazing his arm and the other lodging in his back).<ref name=65FFH11827>{{cite book | title=From Failing Hands: the Story of Presidential Succession | last1=Feerick | first1=John D. | last2=Freund | first2=Paul A. | date=1965 | url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=twentyfifth_amendment_books | publisher=Fordham University Press | location=New York City | pages=118–127 | lccn=65-14917}}</ref> The president wavered between life and death for 80 days after the shooting; it was the first time that the nation as a whole experienced the uncertainties associated with a prolonged period of presidential inability.<ref name=Feerick2011FLR/> Most disconcerting, especially for [[Garfield administration]] personnel and members of Congress, was the lack of constitutional guidance on how to handle the situation. No one was sure who, if anyone, should exercise presidential authority while the president was disabled; many urged Vice President [[Chester Arthur]] to step up, but he declined, fearful of being labeled a usurper. Aware that he was in a delicate position and that his every action was placed under scrutiny, Arthur remained secluded in his [[Chester A. Arthur Home|New York City home]] for most of the summer. Members of the Garfield Cabinet conferred daily with the president's doctors and kept the vice president informed of significant developments on the president's condition.<ref name=65FFH11827/>
*  In October 1919, [[Woodrow Wilson]] suffered a debilitating [[stroke]]. Nearly blind and partially paralyzed, he spent the final 17 months of [[Presidency of Woodrow Wilson|his presidency]] sequestered in the White House.<ref>{{cite web | last=Amber | first=Saladin | title=Woodrow Wilson: Life After The Presidency | url=https://millercenter.org/president/wilson/life-after-the-presidency | publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia | location=Charllotesville, Virginia | accessdate=June 23, 2018}}</ref> Vice President [[Thomas R. Marshall|Thomas Marshall]], the cabinet, and the nation were kept in the dark over the severity of the president's illness for several months. Marshall was pointedly afraid to ask about Wilson's health, or to preside over cabinet meetings, fearful that he would be accused of "longing for his place". Though members of both parties in Congress pledged to support him if he asserted his claim to the presidency, Marshall declined to act, or to do anything that might seem ambitious or disloyal to Wilson.<ref>{{cite web | title=Thomas R.

Cooper (historian) | title=Woodrow Wilson: A Biography | page=555 | date=2009 | publisher=Alfred A. Knopf | isbn=978-0-307-26541-8}}</ref>

When [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] suffered a heart attack in September 1955, he and Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] developed an informal plan authorizing Nixon to assume some administrative duties during Eisenhower's recovery. Although it did not have the force of law, the plan helped to reassure the nation. The agreement also contained a provision whereby Eisenhower could declare his own inability and, if unable to do so, empowered Nixon, with appropriate consultation, to make the decision.<ref name=XXVHeritage/> Had it been invoked, Nixon would have served as acting president until the president issued a declaration of his recovery. Moved forward as a consequence of President Kennedy's November 1963 assassination, this informal plan evolved into constitutional procedure a decade later through Sections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which resolved the uncertainties surrounding presidential disability.<ref name=NCC25th/>

Additionally, two vice presidents have temporarily assumed the powers and duties of the presidency as acting president, as authorized by Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment: [[George H. W.

On a vacancy occurring in the office of vice president, for example upon the vice president assuming the office of president, the person next in line of presidential succession assumes the office of vice president on an [[Acting Vice President of the United States|acting vice president]] basis. The next in line would be the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and not the President pro tempore of the Senate.

== Presidential succession beyond the vice president ==

While several vice presidents have succeeded to the presidency upon the death or resignation of the president, and a number of them have died or resigned, the offices of president and vice president have never been simultaneously vacant;{{efn-ua|Various friends and colleagues of Senator [[David Rice Atchison]] asserted that both offices were vacant on March 4–5, 1849, because the [[Term of office|terms]] of President [[Zachary Taylor]] and Vice President [[Millard Fillmore]] began on March 4, but neither took their oath of office on that day{{snd}}following precedent as the day fell on a Sunday. The [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]] was held the next day, Monday, March 5.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.inaugural.senate.gov/about/past-inaugural-ceremonies/16th-inaugural-ceremonies/ | title=The 16th Presidential Inauguration: Zachary Taylor, March 5, 1849 | publisher=Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies | accessdate=June 28, 2018}}</ref> Consequently, they considered [[David Rice Atchison]], by virtue of being the last [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President ''pro tempore'' of the Senate]] in the out-going Congress, to have been Acting President of the United States during the day-long [[Interregnum]] in accordance with the [[Presidential Succession Act#Presidential Succession Act of 1792|Presidential Succession Act of 1792]]. Historians, constitutional scholars and biographers all dismiss the claim. Atchison did not take the presidential oath of office either, and his term as president ''pro tempore'' had expired on March 4.<ref>{{cite book | title=From Failing Hands: the Story of Presidential Succession | last1=Feerick | first1=John D. | last2=Freund | first2=Paul A. | date=1965 | url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=twentyfifth_amendment_books | publisher=Fordham University Press | location=New York City | pages=100–101 | lccn=65-14917}}</ref>}}{{efn-ua|[[1940 United States presidential election|1940]] Republican presidential nominee [[Wendell Willkie]] and vice presidential nominee [[Charles L. McNary]] both died in 1944 (October 8, and February 25, respectively); the first, and to date only time both members of a major-party presidential ticket died during the term for which they sought election. Had they been elected, Willkie's death would have resulted in the Secretary of State becoming acting president for the remainder of the term ending on January 20, 1945 in accordance with the [[Presidential Succession Act#Presidential Succession Act of 1886|Presidential Succession Act of 1886]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Brewer|first=F.|date=1945|title=Succession to the presidency|work=Editorial research reports 1945 (Vol. II)|publisher=CQ Press|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/cqresrre1945092000|url-access=registration|accessdate=July 12, 2018|quote=If the Republican ticket had been elected in 1940, the plan of succession adopted in 1886 would probably have come into operation for the first time in 1944.

There was potential for such a ''double vacancy'' when [[John Wilkes Booth]] assassinated President [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1865, as Vice President [[Andrew Johnson]] was also targeted (along with Secretary of State [[William Seward]] and possibly General [[Ulysses S.

Ratification of the 25th Amendment, with its mechanism for filling an intra-term vice presidential vacancy, has made calling on the speaker, president pro tempore, or a cabinet member to serve as acting president unlikely to happen, except in the aftermath of a catastrophic event.<ref name=CRSsuccession05/> Only a few years after the amendment went into effect, in October 1973, at the height of [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]], Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] resigned. With Agnew's unexpected departure, and the state of [[Richard Nixon]]'s presidency, Speaker of the House [[Carl Albert]] was suddenly first in line to become acting president.

== Contemporary issues and concerns ==

In 2003, the [[Continuity of Government Commission]] suggested that the current law has "at least seven significant issues ... that warrant attention," specifically:

# The reality that all figures in the current line of succession work and reside in the vicinity of Washington, D.C. In the event of a nuclear, chemical, or biological attack, it is possible that everyone on the list would be killed or incapacitated.
# Doubt that the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate are constitutionally eligible to act as president.
# A concern about the wisdom of including the president pro tempore in the line of succession as the "largely honorific post traditionally held by the longest-serving senator of the majority party". For example, from January 20, 2001, to June 6, 2001, the president pro tempore was then-98-year-old [[Strom Thurmond]].
# A concern that the current line of succession can force the presidency to abruptly switch parties mid-term, as the president, speaker, and the president pro tempore are not necessarily of the same party as each other.
# A concern that the succession line is ordered by the dates of creation of the various executive departments, without regard to the skills or capacities of the persons serving as secretary.
# The fact that, should a Cabinet member begin to act as president, the law allows the House to elect a new speaker (or the Senate to elect a new president pro tempore), who could in effect remove the Cabinet member and assume the office themselves at any time.
# The absence of a provision where a president is disabled and the vice presidency is vacant (for example, if an assassination attempt simultaneously wounded the president and killed the vice president).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.continuityofgovernment.org/pdfs/FirstReport.pdf | title=The Continuity of Congress: The First Report of the Continuity of Government Commission | series=Preserving Our Institutions | page=4 | publisher=Continuity of Government Commission | location=Washington, D.C. | date=May 2003 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625015852/http://www.continuityofgovernment.org/pdfs/FirstReport.pdf | archive-date=June 25, 2008 |url-status = dead| accessdate=December 28, 2008 | via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

In 2009, the Continuity of Government Commission commented on the use of the term "Officer" in the 1947 statute,

{{quote|The language in the current Presidential Succession Act is less clear than that of the 1886 Act with respect to Senate confirmation. The 1886 Act refers to "such officers as shall have been appointed by the advice and consent of the Senate to the office therein named …" The current act merely refers to "officers appointed, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate." Read literally, this means that the current act allows for acting secretaries to be in the line of succession as long as they are confirmed by the Senate for a post (even for example, the second or third in command within a department). It is common for a second in command to become acting secretary when the secretary leaves office. Though there is some dispute over this provision, the language clearly permits acting secretaries to be placed in the line of succession. (We have spoken to acting secretaries who told us they had been placed in the line of succession.)<ref name=continuity2brookings/>}}
 
In 2016–17, the Second [[Fordham University School of Law]] Clinic on Presidential Succession developed a series of proposals to "resolve succession issues that have received little attention from scholars and commissions" over the past several decades; its recommendations included:

* Removing legislators and several Cabinet members from the line of succession and adding four officials, or "Standing Successors", outside of Washington, D.C. The line of succession would be: {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|1}}—}}Secretary of State, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|2}}—}}Secretary of Defense, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|3}}—}}Attorney General, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|4}}—}}Secretary of Homeland Security, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|5}}—}}Secretary of the Treasury, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|6}}—}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 1,}} {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|7}}—}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 2,}} {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|8}}—}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 3,}} and {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|9}}—}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 4;}}
* If legislators are not removed from the line of succession, only designate them as successors in cases where the president dies or resigns, not where he is disabled (to protect legislators from being forced to resign to act as president temporarily) or removed from office;
* Eliminate the "bumping provision" in the Succession Act of 1947;
* Clarify the ambiguity in the Succession Act of 1947 as to whether acting Cabinet secretaries are in the line of succession;
* That the outgoing president nominate and the Senate confirm some of the incoming president's Cabinet secretaries prior to Inauguration Day, which is a particular point of vulnerability for the line of succession;
* Establish statutory procedures for declaring 1) a dual inability of the president and the vice president, including where there is no vice president and 2) a sole inability of the vice president.<ref name=50after25th>{{cite journal | title=Second Fordham University School of Law Clinic on Presidential Succession, Fifty Years After the Twenty-Fifth Amendment: Recommendations for Improving the Presidential Succession System | journal=Fordham Law Review | url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5454&context=flr | volume=86 | issue=3 | year=2017 | pages=917–1025 | accessdate=June 25, 2018}}</ref>
