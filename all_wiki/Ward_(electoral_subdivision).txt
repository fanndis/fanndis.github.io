A '''ward''' is a local authority area, typically used for electoral purposes. Wards are usually named after [[neighbourhood]]s, [[thoroughfare]]s, [[parish]]es, [[landmark]]s, geographical features and in some cases historical figures connected to the area (e.g. William Morris Ward in the London Borough of Waltham Forest). It is common in the [[United States]] for wards to simply be numbered.

In Swahili/Kiswahili Local Ward is called Kata.

In [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Monaco]], [[New Zealand]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[South Africa]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]], they are an [[electoral district]] within a district or [[municipality]], used in [[local government]] elections. In the United States, wards are usually subdivided into [[electoral precinct|precinct]]s for [[Polling place|polling]] purposes.
