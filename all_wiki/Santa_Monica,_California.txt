'''Santa Monica''' ({{langnf||Spanish|[[Saint Monica]]}}) is a beachfront city in western [[Los Angeles County, California]], United States. Situated on [[Santa Monica Bay]], it is bordered on five sides by different neighborhoods of the city of [[Los Angeles]]: [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] to the north, [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] on the northeast, [[West Los Angeles]] on the east, [[Mar Vista, Los Angeles|Mar Vista]] on the southeast, and [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]] on the south. The 2010 [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census]] population was 89,736. Due to a favorable climate and close proximity to Los Angeles, Santa Monica became a famed [[resort town]] by the early 20th century attracting many celebrities, like [[Marion Davies]], to build magnificent beach front homes on Roosevelt Highway (AKA [[California State Route 1|Pacific Coast Highway]] (PCH)). 

The city has experienced a boom since the late 1980s through the revitalization of its downtown core, significant job growth and increased tourism. Popular tourists sites include [[Pacific Park]] on the [[Santa Monica Pier]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://time.com/4144194/these-were-the-most-popular-places-to-check-in-on-facebook-in-2015/ |title=The Most Popular Places to Check In on Facebook in 2015 |first=Sarah |last=Begley |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 10, 2015 |access-date=January 27, 2016 }}</ref> and [[Palisades Park (Santa Monica)|Palisades Park]] atop a bluff over the Pacific Ocean. Santa Monica's environmental and sustainability strategies are focused on community-wide [[carbon neutrality]] by 2050 or sooner.<ref name=":0" />

== History ==
{{More citations needed|date=July 2020}}{{Main|History of Santa Monica, California}}
Santa Monica was inhabited by the [[Tongva people]]. Santa Monica was called '''Kecheek''' in the [[Tongva language]].<ref>Munro, Pamela, et al. ''Yaara' Shiraaw'ax 'Eyooshiraaw'a. Now You're Speaking Our Language: Gabrielino/Tongva/Fernandeño''. Lulu.com: 2008.{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} The first non-indigenous group to set foot in the area was the party of explorer [[Gaspar de Portolà]], who camped near the present-day intersection of Barrington and Ohio Avenues on August 3, 1769. Named after the Christian [[saint Monica]], there are two different accounts of how the city's name came to be. One says it was named in honor of the [[feast day]] of [[Monica of Hippo|Saint Monica]] (mother of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]), but her feast day is May 4. Another version says it was named by [[Juan Crespí]] on account of a pair of springs, the Kuruvungna Springs ([[Serra Springs]]), that were reminiscent of the tears Saint Monica shed over her son's early impiety.<ref name=Scott>Paula A. Scott, ''Santa Monica: a history on the edge. Making of America series'' (Arcadia Publishing, 2004), 17–18.</ref>

Following the Mexican–American War, Mexico signed the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which gave Mexicans and Californios living in state certain unalienable rights. US government sovereignty in California began on February 2, 1848.

In the 1870s, the [[Los Angeles and Independence Railroad]] connected Santa Monica with Los Angeles, and a wharf out into the bay. The first town hall was an 1873 brick building, later a beer hall, and now part of the Santa Monica [[Hostel]]. It is Santa Monica's oldest extant structure. By 1885, the town's first hotel was the Santa Monica Hotel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterandpower.org/museum/Early_Views_of_Santa_Monica.html|title=Water and Power Associates|website=waterandpower.org}}</ref>

Amusement piers became popular in the first decades of the 20th century and the extensive [[Pacific Electric Railroad]] brought people to the city's beaches from across the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]].

Around the start of the 20th century, a growing population of [[Asian American]]s lived in and around Santa Monica and Venice. A [[Japanese people|Japanese]] fishing village was near the Long Wharf while small numbers of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] lived or worked in Santa Monica and Venice.

Two planes returned after covering {{convert|27553| miles|km }} in 175 days, and were greeted on their return September 23, 1924, by a crowd of 200,000. The Douglas Company (later [[McDonnell Douglas]]) kept facilities in the city until the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

The [[Great Depression]] hit Santa Monica deeply. One report gives citywide employment in 1933 of just 1,000. Hotels and office building owners went bankrupt. In the 1930s, corruption infected Santa Monica (along with neighboring [[Los Angeles]]). The federal [[Works Project Administration]] helped build several buildings, most notably City Hall. The main [[Post Office]] and Barnum Hall ([[Santa Monica High School]] auditorium) were also among other WPA projects.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Douglas's business grew with the onset of [[World War II]], employing as many as 44,000 people in 1943. To defend against air attack, [[set designer]]s from the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Studios]] prepared elaborate camouflage that disguised the factory and airfield.<ref>Herman, Arthur.

[[Beach volleyball]] is believed to have been developed by [[Duke Kahanamoku]] in Santa Monica during the 1920s.<ref>[https://www.kingofthebeach.com/pages/history-of-beach-volleyball-king-of-the-beach-and-queen-of-the-beach History of Beach Volleyball] Retrieved August 1, 2020</ref>

Santa Monica has two hospitals: [[Saint John's Health Center]] and [[Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center]]. Its cemetery is [[Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery, Santa Monica|Woodlawn Memorial]].

Santa Monica has several local newspapers including ''[[Santa Monica Daily Press]]'', ''[[Santa Monica Mirror]]'', ''Santa Monica Star'', and ''Santa Monica Observer''.

== Geography ==
The city of Santa Monica rests on a mostly flat slope that angles down towards [[Ocean Avenue (Santa Monica)|Ocean Avenue]] and towards the south. High bluffs separate the north side of the city from the beaches. Santa Monica borders the L.A. neighborhoods of [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] to the north and [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]] to the south. To the west, Santa Monica has the 3-mile coastline fronting the [[Santa Monica Bay]], and to the east of the city borders are the Los Angeles communities of [[West Los Angeles]] and [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]].

=== Climate ===
[[File:Santamonicadowntownsunset.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wilshire Boulevard in downtown Santa Monica at twilight.]]
Santa Monica has a [[Mediterranean climate|coastal Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb''). Santa Monica enjoys an average of 310 days of sunshine a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=159227&refer=| title=Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Los Angeles, California, United States of America| publisher=Weatherbase.com| access-date=August 13, 2009}}</ref> It is in [[USDA plant hardiness zone]] 10a.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-california-usda-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php | title=Interactive USDA Gardening and Plant Hardiness Zone Map for California | publisher=Plantmaps.com | access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref> Because of its location, nestled on the vast and open Santa Monica Bay, morning fog is a common phenomenon in May, June, July and early August (caused by ocean temperature variations and currents). Like other inhabitants of the greater Los Angeles area, residents have a particular terminology for this phenomenon: the "May Gray", the "[[June Gloom]]" and even “Fogust”. Overcast skies are common during June mornings, but usually the strong sun burns the fog off by noon. In the late winter/early summer, daily fog is a phenomenon too. It happens suddenly and it may last some hours or past sunset time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santabarbara.com/community/weather/junegloom.asp| title = Santa Barbara.com: June Gloom| publisher=SantaBarbara.com| access-date=August 13, 2009}}</ref> Nonetheless, it will sometimes stay cloudy and cool all day during June, even as other parts of the Los Angeles area enjoy sunny skies and warmer temperatures. At times, the sun can be shining east of 20th Street, while the beach area is overcast. As a general rule, the beach temperature is from 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3 to 6 degrees Celsius) cooler than it is inland during summer days, and 5–10 degrees warmer during winter nights.

It is also in September highest temperatures tend to be reached. It is winter, however, when the hot, dry winds of the [[Santa Ana wind|Santa Anas]] are most common. In contrast, temperatures exceeding 10 degrees below average are rare.

The rainy season is from late October through late March. Winter storms usually approach from the northwest and pass quickly through the Southland. There is very little rain during the rest of the year. Yearly rainfall totals are unpredictable as rainy years are occasionally followed by droughts. There has never been any snow or frost, but there has been hail.

Santa Monica usually enjoys cool breezes blowing in from the ocean, which tend to keep the air fresh and clean. Therefore, smog is less of a problem for Santa Monica than elsewhere around Los Angeles. However, in the autumn months of September through November, the Santa Ana winds will sometimes blow from the east, bringing smoggy and hot inland air to the beaches.

==== Gang activity ====
The Pico neighborhood of Santa Monica (south of the Santa Monica Freeway) experiences some gang activity. The city estimates there are about 50 gang members based in Santa Monica, although some community organizers dispute this claim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surfsantamonica.com/ssm_site/the_lookout/news/News-2006/March-2006/03_16_06_Police_Chief_Calls_for_Regional_Approach.htm |title=Police Chief Calls for Regional Approach to Gang Violence |publisher=Surfsantamonica.com |access-date=June 13, 2012}}</ref> Gang activity has been prevalent for decades in the Pico neighborhood.

In 1999, there was a double homicide in the Westside Clothing store on Lincoln Boulevard. During the incident, Culver City gang members David "Puppet" Robles and Jesse "Psycho" Garcia entered the store masked and began opening fire, killing Anthony and Michael Juarez. They then ran outside to a getaway vehicle driven by a third Culver City gang member, who is now also in custody.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.santamonicapd.org/press_info/PressReleases/2006/PressRelease-2006-0415-HomicideInv.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905145222/http://www.santamonicapd.org/press_info/PressReleases/2006/PressRelease-2006-0415-HomicideInv.htm|url-status=dead|title=Suspects Charged in Westside Clothing Store Shooting|archive-date=September 5, 2009}}</ref> The clothing store was believed to be a local hang out for Santa Monica gang members. The dead included two men from Northern California who had merely been visiting the store's owner, their cousin, to see if they could open a similar store in their area. Police say the incident was in retaliation for a shooting committed by the Santa Monica 13 gang days before the Juarez brothers were gunned down.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/2003/110603PARA.HTML |title='Gangster's Paradise Lost' |publisher=Streetgangs.com |date=October 27, 1998 |access-date=June 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130111100637/http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/2003/110603PARA.HTML |archive-date=January 11, 2013  }}</ref>

Aside from the rivalry with the Culver City gang, gang members also feud with the Venice and [[West Los Angeles]] gangs. The main rivals in these regions include [[Venice 13]], [[Crips|Graveyard Gangster Crips]], [[Bandidos Motorcycle Club|Hell's Bandidos]] and [[Crips|Venice Shoreline Crips]] gangs in the Oakwood area of [[Venice, California]].

==== Motorized vehicles ====
[[File:Santa Monica PCH.jpg|thumb|[[Pacific Coast Highway (California)|Pacific Coast Highway]] running through Santa Monica]]
The [[Santa Monica Freeway]] ([[Interstate 10 (California)|Interstate 10]]) begins in Santa Monica near the Pacific Ocean and heads east. The Santa Monica Freeway between Santa Monica and downtown Los Angeles has the distinction of being one of the busiest highways in all of North America. After traversing the [[Greater Los Angeles]] area, I-10 crosses seven more states, terminating at [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. In Santa Monica, there is a road sign designating this route as the Christopher Columbus Transcontinental Highway. [[State Route 2 (California)|State Route 2]] ([[Santa Monica Boulevard]]) begins in Santa Monica, barely grazing [[State Route 1 (California)|State Route 1]] at [[Lincoln Boulevard (Southern California)|Lincoln Boulevard]], and continues northeast across Los Angeles County, through the [[Angeles National Forest]], crossing the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] as the [[Angeles Crest Highway]], ending in [[Wrightwood, California|Wrightwood]]. Santa Monica is also the western terminus of Historic [[U.S. Route 66 (California)|U.S. Route 66]]. Close to the eastern boundary of Santa Monica, [[Sepulveda Boulevard]] reaches from [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] at the south, to the northern end of the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Just east of Santa Monica is [[Interstate 405 (California)|Interstate 405]], the San Diego Freeway, a major north–south route in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange]] counties.

The [[City of Santa Monica]] has purchased the first [[ZeroTruck]] [[all-electric vehicle|all-electric]] [[medium-duty truck]]. The vehicle will be equipped with a Scelzi utility body, it is based on the Isuzu N series chassis, a [[UQM]] PowerPhase 100 advanced electric motor and is the only US built electric truck offered for sale in the United States in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=21244 |title=Santa Monica Introduces Electric Zero Truck Into City Fleet: #evworld |publisher=Evworld.com |date=June 21, 2009 |access-date=June 13, 2012}}</ref>

==== Bus ====
The city of Santa Monica runs its own bus service, the [[Big Blue Bus]], which also serves much of [[West Los Angeles (region)|West Los Angeles]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). A Big Blue Bus was featured prominently in the action movie ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]''.

The city of Santa Monica is also served by the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]'s (Metro) bus lines. Metro also complements Big Blue service, as when Big Blue routes are not operational overnight, Metro buses make many Big Blue Bus stops, in addition to MTA stops.

==== Light rail ====
Design and construction on the {{convert|6.6|mile|km|adj=mid |extension}} of the [[E Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Expo Line]] from Culver City to Santa Monica started in September 2011, with service beginning on May 20, 2016. Santa Monica [[Metro Rail (Los Angeles County)|Metro]] stations include [[26th Street/Bergamot (Los Angeles Metro station)|26th Street/Bergamot]], [[17th Street/Santa Monica College (Los Angeles Metro station)|17th Street/Santa Monica College]], and [[Downtown Santa Monica (Los Angeles Metro station)|Downtown Santa Monica]]. Travel time between the downtown Santa Monica and the downtown Los Angeles termini is approximately 47 minutes.

Historical aspects of the Expo line route are noteworthy. It uses the former Los Angeles region's electric interurban Pacific Electric Railway's right-of-way that ran from the Exposition Park area of Los Angeles to Santa Monica. This route was called the [[Santa Monica Air Line]] and provided electric-powered freight and passenger service between Los Angeles and Santa Monica beginning in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.erha.org/pewal.htm |title=Santa Monica Air Line |publisher=Electric Railway Historical Association of Southern California}}</ref> Passenger service was discontinued in 1953, but diesel-powered freight deliveries to warehouses along the route continued until March 11, 1988.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morgenthaler|first=Anne |title=END OF THE LINE—The last train out of SM blows a final whistle |newspaper=Santa Monica Outlook |date=March 14, 1988}}</ref> The abandonment of the line spurred future transportation considerations and concerns within the community, and the entire right-of-way was purchased from [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] by Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The line was built in 1875 as the steam-powered [[Los Angeles and Independence Railroad]] to bring mining ore to ships in Santa Monica harbor and as a passenger excursion train to the beach.

==== Subway ====
Since the mid-1980s, various proposals have been made to extend the [[D Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Purple Line]] subway to Santa Monica under Wilshire Boulevard. There are no current plans to complete the "subway to the sea," an estimated $5&nbsp;billion project.{{Citation needed|reason=Cannot verify this figure |date=February 2019}}

==== Airport and ports ====
[[File:KSMO east.jpg|thumb|Landing craft at Santa Monica Airport. Looking east towards [[Century City, California|Century City]].]]

The city owns and operates a [[general aviation]] airport, [[Santa Monica Airport]], which has been the site of several important aviation achievements. Commercial flights are available for residents at [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]], a few miles south of Santa Monica.

Like other cities in Los Angeles County, Santa Monica is dependent upon the [[Port of Long Beach]] and the [[Port of Los Angeles]] for international ship cargo. In the 1890s, Santa Monica was once in competition with [[Wilmington, Los Angeles, California|Wilmington, California]], and [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]] for recognition as the "Port of Los Angeles" (see [[History of Santa Monica, California]]).
