'''Howard Jay Phillips''' (February 3, 1941&nbsp;– April 20, 2013) was a three-time [[United States]] [[President of the United States|presidential]] candidate who served as the chairman of [[The Conservative Caucus]], a [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] public policy advocacy group which he founded in 1974. Phillips was a founding member of the [[U.S. Taxpayers Party]], which later became known as the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]].

==Personal life==
Phillips was born into a [[Jewish]] family in Boston in 1941,<ref>[http://www.issues2000.org/Profile_Howard_Phillips.htm Profile of Howard Phillips], [[Ontheissues.org]]</ref> Phillips converted to [[evangelical Christianity]] as an adult in the 1970s<ref>Simon, Barbara [http://www.reformjudaismmag.net/rjmag-90s/1096bs.html "Strange Bedfellows: Jews, Apostates, and the Christian Right"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510080250/http://www.reformjudaismmag.net/rjmag-90s/1096bs.html |date=2017-05-10 }}, ''[[Reform Judaism (magazine)|Reform Judaism]]''.

A 1962 graduate of [[Harvard College]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts, where he was twice elected chairman of the [[Students' union|Student Council]], Phillips was president of Policy Analysis, Inc., a public policy research organization which publishes the bimonthly ''Issues and Strategy Bulletin''.

Phillips resided in [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]] in the [[Washington, D.C.]], suburbs with his wife, the former Margaret "Peggy" Blanchard.

==Republican years==
During the [[Nixon Administration]], Phillips headed two [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] agencies, ending his [[Executive Branch]] career as director of the U.S. [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] (OEO) in the [[Executive Office of the President]] for five months in 1973, a position from which he resigned when U.S. President [[Richard M. Nixon]] reneged on his commitment to [[veto]] further funding for [[Great Society]] programs begun in the administration of Nixon's predecessor, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].<ref name="lion">Smith, Peter Jesserer (May 6, 2013) [http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/catholics-bid-farewell-to-pro-life-lion-howard-phillips/ "Catholics Bid Farewell to Pro-Life Lion Howard Phillips"], ''[[National Catholic Register]]''.

Retrieved 2013-05-06</ref>

Nixon's appointment of Phillips as [[Acting (law)|Acting]] Director of OEO in January 1973 touched off a national controversy culminating in a court case in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] (''Williams v. Phillips'', 482 F.2d 669) challenging the legality of Phillips' appointment, since the statute establishing the office did not specifically establish a Presidential right to make an interim appointment (one not confirmed by the Senate) under the existing circumstances.  The Court ruled (and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2nd Circuit]] subsequently affirmed) that the President had no right to make the interim appointment and voided it, declaring his time in it to have been illegal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/482/f2d/669/williams-v-j-phillips |title=482 F2d 669 Williams v. J Phillips |publisher=OpenJurist |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>

==Formation of the Conservative Caucus==
Phillips left the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] in 1974 after some two decades of service to the GOP as precinct worker, election warden, campaign manager, [[United States Congress|congressional]] aide, Boston municipal Republican chairman, and assistant to the chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]]. In [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1970|1970]], he was the Republican nominee for [[Massachusetts's 6th congressional district]]. In [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1978|1978]], Phillips finished fourth in the Democratic [[primary election|primary]] for the [[List of United States senators from Massachusetts|U.S. Senate in Massachusetts]].<ref name="stalwart">Weber, Bruce (2013-04-23) [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/us/politics/howard-j-phillips-dies-72-stalwart-conservative.html?_r=0 "Howard J. Phillips, Stalwart Conservative, Dies at 72"], ''[[The New York Times]]. Retrieved 2013-04-24.</ref>

In 1974, Phillips founded the Conservative Caucus, a nationwide, grass-roots public policy advocacy group.<ref name="stalwart"/><ref name="losestowin">Black, Chris (1992-09-25) [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/61858523.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+25%2C+1992&author=Chris+Black%2C+Globe+Staff&pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=Political+activist+loses+to+win+Conservative+takes+defeats+in+stride+in+effort+to+build+national+antitax+party&pqatl=google "Political activist loses to win Conservative takes defeats in stride in effort to build national antitax party"], ''[[Boston Globe]]''. Retrieved 2013-05-06.</ref> The group opposed the 1978 [[Panama Canal]] treaties and the [[Jimmy Carter]]-[[Leonid Brezhnev]] [[SALT II]] treaties in 1979, supported the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] and major tax reductions during the 1980s, and fought to end Federal subsidies to activist groups under the banner of "defunding the [[political left|Left]]."<ref name="lion"/>

In 1982, Phillips joined the political activist [[Clymer Wright]] of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], Texas, in an unsuccessful effort to convince U.S. President [[Ronald W. Reagan]] to dismiss Houston [[attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] [[James A. Baker, III]], from the position of presidential chief of staff. Phillips and Wright claimed that Baker, a former Democrat and a political intimate of then [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H. W. Bush]], was undercutting conservative initiatives in the Reagan administration. Reagan rejected the Wright-Phillips request, and in 1985, named Baker as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], at Baker's request in a job-swap with then Secretary [[Donald T. Regan]], a former [[Merrill Lynch]] officer who became chief of staff. Reagan also rebuked Phillips and Wright for waging a "campaign of sabotage" against Baker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/05/us/briefing-186924.html|title=Phil Gailey and Warren Weaver, Jr., "Briefing"|publisher=[[The New York Times]], June 5, 1982|accessdate=January 27, 2011|date=June 5, 1982}}</ref>

The fight against Baker was not Phillips' first clash with Reagan. The year before in 1981, he had joined other conservatives, including the Reverend [[Jerry Falwell]], in opposing the nomination of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. According to Phillips, "People say you can't tell how a Supreme Court nominee will turn out once on the bench. I respectfully disagree. In most cases, it's very clear. I opposed the nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor because it was very clear that she had a pro-abortion record in the [[Arizona State Senate]] and as a judge in [[Arizona]]. She was also allied with [[Planned Parenthood]]."<ref name="lion"/><ref name=flynnf>[[Daniel J.

In addition, he was a trustee of two hospitals: Dartmouth Hitchcock and Concord Memorial. He successfully changed the policy of those two hospitals from zero abortion to convenience abortion."<ref name=flynnf/>

Other Conservative Caucus campaigns have involved opposition to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and the [[World Trade Organization]], support for a national version of [[California]]'s [[California Proposition 187 (1994)|Proposition 187]] (to end mandated subsidies for [[Alien (law)|illegal aliens]]), as well as continuing efforts to oppose [[publicly funded health care]], [[abortion]] and [[gay rights]]. Phillips was the host of ''[[Conservative Roundtable]]'', a weekly [[Public affairs programming|public affairs]] [[television program]].

==Role in formation of the New Right==
{{Further|New Right#United States}}
Phillips played an instrumental role in the leadership of the New Right, and in the founding of the [[Christian right|religious right]] in the 1970s.<ref name="lion"/> He worked with fellow conservatives [[Paul Weyrich]] of [[The Heritage Foundation]] and both former [[Christian Voice (United States)|Christian Voice]] co-activists [[Richard Viguerie]] and [[Terry Dolan (activist)|Terry Dolan]] to persuade the Reverend [[Jerry Falwell]] to form the [[Moral Majority]], and helped [[Judie Brown]] form the [[American Life League]].<ref name="lion"/>

==U.S. Taxpayers Party/Constitution Party==
Phillips was one of the founders of the [[U.S. Taxpayers Party]] (which changed its name to the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] in 1999), a [[third political party|third party]] associated with conservative,  [[anti-abortion]] issues, and [[U.S. Constitution|constitutional]] government ideas on both social and fiscal issues.<ref name="losestowin"/> He was that party's [[President of the United States|presidential]] candidate in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992]], [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|1996]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000]] elections for U.S. President.<ref name="stalwart"/><ref name="Princeton">{{cite book |last1= Kazin| first1= Michael |last2= Edwards |first2= Rebecca |last3= Rothman |first3= Adam |title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4hqpJEJp7cUC&pg=PA196 |year= 2009|publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |isbn= 9781400833566|page= 196}}</ref>
