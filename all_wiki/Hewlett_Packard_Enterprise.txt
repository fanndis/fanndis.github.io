The '''Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company''' ('''HPE''') is an American multinational enterprise [[information technology]] company based in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]], founded on November 1, 2015, as part of the splitting of the [[Hewlett-Packard]] company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hpe.com/us/en/ww-office-locations.html |title=Office Locations HPE WW Office Locations|website=HPE|language=en-US|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref> HPE is a business-focused organization with two divisions: Enterprise Group, which works in servers, storage, networking, consulting and support, and Financial Services. On October 31, HPE reported FY2019 annual revenue of $29.135 billion, down 5.57% from the prior year period.<ref name="2019-revenue-macrotrends">{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/HPE/hewlett-packard-enterprise/revenue|title=Hewlett Packard Enterprise Revenue 2013-2019 {{!}} HPE|access-date=February 7, 2020|website=Macrotrends}}</ref>

The split was structured so that the former Hewlett-Packard Company would change its name to [[HP Inc.]] and spin off Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a newly created company. HP Inc. retained the old HP's personal computer and printing business, as well as its stock-price history and original [[NYSE]] ticker symbol for Hewlett-Packard; Enterprise trades under its own ticker symbol: HPE. According to notes from 2015,<ref name="2019-revenue-macrotrends"/> HPE's revenue was slightly less than that of HP Inc. In 2017, it spun off its Enterprise Services business and merged it with [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] to become [[DXC Technology]]. It also spun off its software business and merged it with [[Micro Focus]]. HPE was ranked No. 107 in the 2018 [[Fortune 500]] list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/|title=Fortune 500 Companies 2018: Who Made the List|website=Fortune|language=en-US|access-date=November 10, 2018}}</ref>

==Naming==
The full name for the company is "Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company", which drops the hyphen that previously existed between the "Hewlett" and "Packard" of the former Hewlett-Packard Company. The company is commonly referred to as "Hewlett Packard Enterprise" or by its initials "HPE". The company has also been referred to as "HP Enterprise" by some media outlets<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/hp-inc-hp-enterprise-launch-questions-abound-for-both/|title=HP Inc., HPE launch: Questions abound for both|last=Dignan|first=Larry|date=November 2, 2015|work=ZDNet|access-date=September 28, 2017}}</ref> and has even been incorrectly referred to as "HP Enterprises".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/9/15/hp-to-jettison-up-to-30000-jobs-as-part-of-spinoff.html|title=HP to Cut Up to 30,000 Jobs|agency=Al Jazeera America|date=September 15, 2015|access-date=September 28, 2017}}</ref>
