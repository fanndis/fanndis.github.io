The '''Nehru–Gandhi Family''' is an [[India]]n [[Political families of India|political family]] that has occupied a prominent place in the [[politics of India]]. The involvement of the family has traditionally revolved around the [[Indian National Congress]], as various members have traditionally led the party. Three members of the family: [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Indira Gandhi]], and [[Rajiv Gandhi]], have served as the [[Prime Minister of India]], while several others have been [[Member of Parliament|members]] of [[Parliament of India|the parliament]].

''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote in 2007, "The Nehru brand has no peer in the world — a member of the family has been in charge of India for 40 of the 60 years since independence. The allure of India's first family blends the right to rule of [[British monarchy]] with the tragic glamour of America's [[Kennedy family|Kennedy clan]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2007/may/09/india?picture=329818381#/?picture=329818414&index=1 |title=The making of the Ghandy dynasty &#124; News &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref>

The Gandhi surname came from [[Feroze Gandhi]], a politician of [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] [[Parsi]] ancestry, who changed the spelling of his surname, from Ghandy to Gandhi, after joining the [[Indian independence movement|independence movement]] to bring it in line with that of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].<ref name="Guha">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8FKepYC6wzwC&pg=PA33|title=India after Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy|last=Guha|first=Ramachandra|publisher=Pan Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=978-0330540209|at=p.&nbsp;33, footnote 2 (chapter 14)}}: "Feroze Gandhi was also from the Nehrus' home town, Allahabad.

===Earliest record===
[[File:Anand Bhawan, Allahabad.jpg|244px|thumb|[[Anand Bhavan]], ancestral home of the Nehru-Gandhi Family in [[Allahabad]], now a museum.]]

*[[Raj Kaul]] (late 1600s to early 1700s) a [[Kashmiri Pandit]], he is the earliest recorded ancestor of the Nehru family. He is believed to have moved from Kashmir to Delhi in 1716 AD.

''Kaul'' was the original family name; this changed to Kaul-Nehru; and, in later years, Kaul was dropped out and the family name became only "Nehru".<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Shashi Tharoor]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ds1RXSyRevYC&q=raj+kaul+nehru&pg=PA1900|title=Nehru: The Invention of India|isbn=9789351180180|date=16 October 2007}}</ref>
