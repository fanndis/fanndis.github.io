==Political career==
After graduating [[Kyiv University]], Bezsmertnyi became a school [[history]] teacher in [[Makariv]]. Soon after Ukraine gained independence he switched to politics and made a successful career within the [[Ukrainian Republican Party]], becoming its member of parliament in 1994. Later he left the party but continued his career as a member of parliament. From 2002 to 2006 he was a member of the parliamentary Committee for State Development and Local Self-Governance.

Bezsmertnyi was one of the leaders of the 2004 [[Orange Revolution]]. After [[Viktor Yuschenko]]'s victory on the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|2004 presidential elections]], Bezsmertnyi became the main organizer of the [[People's Union "Our Ukraine"]] party. The "Our Ukraine"s formal chair is Yuschenko himself, so Bezsmertnyi, as the Head of party's Political Council, became its factual leader.

In 2005 Bezsmertnyi was [[Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine]], responsible for administrative and territorial reform, in the [[first Tymoshenko government]].<ref name="first Tymo cabinet ministersB1"/>
