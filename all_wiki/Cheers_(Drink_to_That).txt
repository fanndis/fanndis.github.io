The video begins with Rihanna's fans screaming and cheering her name before a concert is about to start, while Rihanna is shown walking to her dressing room, preparing to perform by doing her make-up and changing outfits. As a firework explodes in the sky, scenes of Rihanna driving through her hometown and having a drink at the bar are intercut. As the song starts to play, Rihanna is seen in a variety of different outfits from various parts of the concert, whilst also showing clips of the audience dancing and singing. Rihanna is also seen holding a handheld camera, which she uses to film herself and other people, as well as goings-on backstage. [[Avril Lavigne]], who makes a cameo appearance in the video, is seen raising her glass to the camera before being pushed fully clothed into a swimming pool while on a skateboard. [[Jay-Z]], [[Kanye West]] and [[CeeLo Green]] are also featured in the various clips of the video, as the former two were special guests at Rihanna's tour on certain dates, while the latter was an opening act on selected dates during the North American leg of the tour. Shots of Rihanna flying on a private jet, avoiding paparazzi and participating in the Barbados Kadooment Day are also intercut throughout the video.<ref name="Rap-Up">{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/08/25/video-rihanna-cheers-drink-to-that/|title= Video: Rihanna – 'Cheers (Drink to That)'|work=Rap-Up|publisher=Devine Lazerine|date=2011-08-26|access-date=2011-08-26}}</ref> The video ends with Rihanna on a boat shouting "Rihanna Navy!", referring to her fan group.<ref name="RollingStone">{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/videos/new-and-hot/rihanna-cheers-drink-to-that-20110826|title= Rihanna – 'Cheers (Drink to That)' (video)|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=2011-08-26|access-date=2011-08-26}}</ref>
