The need for a ''people's car'' ({{lang|de|Volkswagen}} in German, and in the English-speaking world in the early 20th century as "folks' wagon"), its concept and its functional objectives were formulated by the leader of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Adolf Hitler]], who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country's new road network ([[Reichsautobahn]]). Members of the National Socialist party, with an additional dues surcharge, were promised the first production, but [[Spanish civil war|civil war in Spain]] shifted most production resources to military vehicles instead to support [[Francisco Franco]]. Lead engineer [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. [[Béla Barényi]]<ref name="hof"/> is credited with first conceiving the original design for this car in 1925, notably by Mercedes-Benz, on their website, including his original technical drawing,<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20181002102349/https://www.mercedes-benz.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/09/HISTORIE_Bela_Barenyi_der_Lebensretter_04-710x396.jpg</ref><ref name=BenzLife/> five years before Porsche claimed to have done his initial version.<ref>Barényi's thesis anticipated the key design principles of the VW in 1925/1926.

Although designed in the 1930s, due to [[World War II]], civilian Beetles only began to be produced in significant numbers by the end of the 1940s. The car was then internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen. Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302, or 1303, the former three indicating [[engine displacement]], the latter two derived from the model number. The car became widely known in its home country as the ''Käfer'' (German for "[[beetle]]", cognate with English [[Wikt:chafer|chafer]]) and was later marketed under that name in Germany,<ref name= samba-1973-de-super/> and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the {{lang|fr|Coccinelle}}<!--was that an official VW model name or just a common nickname?--> (French for [[coccinellidae|ladybug]]).<ref name="samba-1970-ca-full"/><ref name="samba-1970-us-super"/> In 1943, [[Roy Fedden]] applied for a patent,<ref>https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/010067840/publication/GB570814A</ref> GB570814, 'Improvements relating to road vehicles', a car identical to VW Käfer.

The original 25&nbsp;hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph), which would be a viable cruising speed on the ''[[Reichsautobahn]]'' system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40&nbsp;hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle gave rise to multiple variants: mainly the 1950 [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2 'Bus']], the 1955 [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|Karmann Ghia]], as well as the 1961 [[Volkswagen Type 3|Type 3 'Ponton']] and the 1968 [[Volkswagen Type 4|Type 4 (411/412)]] [[family car]]s, ultimately forming the basis of an entirely rear-engined VW product range. The Beetle thus marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, and then by [[Fiat]] and [[Renault]], whereby the [[rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]] increased from 2.6&nbsp;percent of continental Western Europe's car production in 1946 to 26.6&nbsp;percent in 1956.<ref name=SmallCar196501>{{cite journal |authorlink= Laurence Pomeroy |title=BMC's Mini: The Background story: Part one: The Volkswagen cometh |journal=[[Car Magazine|Small Car]] |pages=42–47 |date=January 1965}}</ref> In 1959 even General Motors launched an air-cooled, rear-engined car, the [[Chevrolet Corvair]]—which even shared the Beetle's flat engine and [[swing axle]] architecture.

Over time, [[front-wheel drive]], and frequently [[hatchback]]-bodied cars would come to dominate the European small-car market. In 1974, Volkswagen's own front-wheel drive [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] hatchback succeeded the Beetle. In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the [[Volkswagen New Beetle#History|Concept One]], a "retro"-themed [[concept car]] with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "[[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]]", built on the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|contemporary Golf]] platform with styling recalling the original Type 1. It remained in production through 2010, and was succeeded in 2011 by the [[Volkswagen Beetle (A5)|Beetle (A5)]], the last variant of the Beetle, which was also more reminiscent of the original Beetle. Production ceased altogether by 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45516677|title=VW Beetle comes to the end of the road|date=2018-09-14|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref>

In the 1999 [[Car of the Century]] competition, to determine the world's most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the [[Ford Model T]], the [[Mini]], and the [[Citroën DS]].<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news |title=This Just In: Model T Gets Award |first=James G. |last=Cobb |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E1DF1439F937A15751C1A96F958260 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=24 December 1999}}</ref>

The original concept behind the first Volkswagen, the company, and its name is the notion of a ''people’s car'' – a car affordable and practical enough for common people to own.<ref name=Jalopnik>{{Cite web|url=https://jalopnik.com/the-real-story-behind-the-nazis-and-volkswagen-1733943186|title=The Real Story Behind The Nazis And Volkswagen|website=Jalopnik}}</ref> Hence the name, which is literally "people's car" in German, pronounced {{IPA-de |ˈfɔlksvaːɡən|}}).

Contrary to the situation in the United States, where the [[Ford Model T]] had become the first car to motorize the masses, contributing to household car ownership of about 33% in 1920 and some 46% in 1930, in the early 1930s, the German auto industry was still mostly limited to luxury models, and few Germans could afford anything more than a motorcycle: one German out of 50 owned a car.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oldurbanist.blogspot.com/2013/02/was-rise-of-car-ownership-responsible.html|title=Old Urbanist: Was the Rise of Car Ownership Responsible for the Midcentury Homeownership Boom in the US?|first=Charlie|last=Gardner|date=17 February 2013}}</ref>

In April 1934, Hitler gave the order to Porsche to develop a ''Volkswagen''.<ref group=note>''"Car where they can stay two soldiers with a machine gun, or two parents and one child."'' (Hitler's orders to Porsche).</ref> The epithet ''Volks-'' literally, "people's-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods as well, such as the ''[[Volksempfänger]]'' ("people's radio").

In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin's [[Hotel Kaiserhof (Berlin)|Kaiserhof Hotel]], Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at {{convert |100|km/h|mph|0| abbr=on}} while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100&nbsp;km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK).<ref name="Wood"/> The engine had to be powerful enough for sustained cruising on Germany's ''[[Autobahn]]en''. Everything had to be designed to ensure parts could be quickly and inexpensively exchanged. The engine had to be [[Air-cooled engine|air-cooled]] because, as Hitler explained, not every country doctor had his own garage. ([[Ethylene glycol]] [[antifreeze]] was only just beginning to be used in high-performance [[Water cooling|liquid-cooled]] aircraft engines. In general, water in radiators would freeze unless the vehicle was kept in a heated building overnight or drained and refilled each morning.)<ref name=Spiegel331955>{{cite magazine|url = http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-31970946.html |title= In König Nordhoffs Reich |accessdate=2013-05-17 |magazine= Der Spiegel | editor-first = Rudolf | editor-last = Augstein | editor-link = Rudolf Augstein | volume =33/1955 | page = 16|date= 10 August 1955}}</ref>

The "People's Car" would be available to citizens of Germany through a savings scheme, or ''Sparkarte'' (savings booklet),<ref>Gilmore, p.45.</ref> at 990 [[Reichsmark]], about the price of a small motorcycle. (The average weekly income was then around 32''RM''.)<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Ferdinand Porsche developed the [[Porsche Type 12|Type 12]], or "''Auto für Jedermann''" (car for everybody) for [[Zündapp]] in 1931. Porsche already preferred the [[flat-four engine]], and selected a [[swing axle]] rear suspension (invented by [[Edmund Rumpler]]), while Zündapp insisted on a [[water cooling|water-cooled]] five-cylinder [[radial engine]]. In 1932 three prototypes were running;<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/album_search.php?search_keywords=porsche+type12&search_terms=all |title=The samba |date=2003-08-15 |accessdate= 2011-12-03}}</ref> all were lost during [[World War II]], the last in a [[Bombing of Stuttgart in World War II|bombing raid in Stuttgart]] in 1945.

The Zündapp prototypes were followed by the Porsche Type 32, designed in 1933 for ''[[NSU Motorenwerke AG]]'', another motorcycle company.  The Type 32 was similar in design to the Type 12, but it had a flat-four engine. NSU discontinued car manufacturing, and the Type 32 was abandoned at the prototype stage.<ref name="ltvvwc-2002">{{cite web|title=The History of the Beetle—The Earliest Beginnings pt.1|url=http://www.ltv-vwc.org.uk/wheelspin/Ws_dec_2002/Beetle-early-history.htm|work=Wheelspin|publisher=London & Thames Valley VW Club|accessdate=1 November 2010|date=December 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516151212/http://www.ltv-vwc.org.uk/wheelspin/Ws_dec_2002/Beetle-early-history.htm|archive-date=16 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Initially designated Type 60 by Porsche, the design team included [[Erwin Komenda]] and [[Karl Rabe]].

The first volume-produced versions of the car's running-gear and [[chassis]] were military vehicles, the Type 82 [[Volkswagen Kübelwagen|''Kübelwagen'']] (approximately 52,000 built) and the amphibious Type 128 and 166 [[Volkswagen Schwimmwagen|''Schwimmwagen'']] (about 14,000 built).

=== Wartime production{{anchor|pre-1945}} ===
[[File:VW "Käfer" 82 E Military vehicle, frontal.JPG|thumb|Front view of a Wehrmacht Typ 82E in ''dunkelgelb''.]]

A handful of KdF-Wagen were produced, primarily for the [[Nazism|Nazi]] elite, from 1941 to 1944, as the Typ 60. During World War II, the factory primarily built the ''[[Kübelwagen]]'' (Typ 82), the ''[[Schwimmwagen]]'' (Typ 166), and a handful of other [[Military light utility vehicle|light wheeled vehicles]], all mechanically derived from the Typ 1, for the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''. These included several hundred [[Volkswagen Kommandeurswagen|''Kommandeurswagen'']] (Typ 87), with a Typ 1 Beetle body mounted on the rugged chassis of the [[four-wheel drive]] Typ 86 Kübelwagen prototype, and fitted with [[portal axle]] and a ''Schwimmwagen'' [[drive train]], with wider fenders., to accommodate oversize ''Kronprinz'' all-terrain tires (reminiscent of the later [[Baja Bug]]s).<ref>Mayer, Hans-Georg.

Much of the essential equipment had already been moved to underground bunkers for protection, which let production resume quickly after hostilities ended. Due to gasoline shortages late in the war, a few "''Holzbrenner''" Beetles were built, which were fueled with logs of wood. The logs were converted into combustible gases using [[pyrolysis]] [[Wood gas generator|gas producers]] located under the front hood, so the car could retain its carbureted Otto engine.

=== Post-war production and boom ===

In occupied Germany, the Allies followed the [[Morgenthau plan]] to remove all German war potential by complete or partial pastoralization. As part of this, in the [[Industrial plans for Germany]], the rules for which industry Germany was to be allowed to retain were set out. German car production was set at a maximum of 10 percent of the 1936 car production numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=10&documentid=22&documentdate=1947-03-24&studycollectionid=mp&nav=OK |title=Draft, The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria, Report 3, March, 1947; OF 950B: Economic Mission as to Food...; Truman Papers |publisher=Truman Library |accessdate= 30 September 2010}}</ref>

Mass production of civilian VW cars did not start until [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|post-war occupation]]. The Volkswagen factory was handed over by the Americans to British control in 1945; it was to be dismantled and shipped to Britain.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/mar/18/guardianobituaries |title=Ivan Hirst, News |work= The Guardian |location=UK |date= 18 March 2000 |accessdate= 30 September 2010}}</ref> However, no British car manufacturer was interested in the factory; an official report included the phrases "the vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirement of a motor-car… it is quite unattractive to the average buyer…  To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise."<ref name="autogenerated3" /> The factory survived by producing cars for the [[British Army]] instead.<ref name="autogenerated3" /> Allied dismantling policy changed in late 1946 to mid-1947, although heavy industry continued to be dismantled until 1951.

The re-opening of the factory is largely accredited to British Army officer Major [[Ivan Hirst]]. Hirst was ordered to take control of the heavily bombed factory, which the Americans had captured. His first task was to remove an unexploded bomb that had fallen through the roof and lodged itself between some pieces of irreplaceable production equipment; if the bomb had exploded, the Beetle's fate would have been sealed.

The first 1,785&nbsp;Type 1s were made in 1945.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

After initially building mostly Beetles for the British military, in 1947 production transitioned to purely civilian Beetles, for the first time featuring chromed bumpers, hubcaps, and body and running board trim.<ref name=HowStuffWorks>{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1945-1959-volkswagen-beetle.htm|title=1945-1959 Volkswagen Beetle|date=29 October 2007|website=HowStuffWorks}}</ref> Aside from some remaining military production, civilian output reached almost 9,000 units in 1947, and for 1948 total production increased to 19,244 cars. The late 1940s Beetles still had an understressed 1131 cc engine with just 25 horsepower, but it could effortlessly maintain cruising at the car's {{convert|60|mph|adj=on}} top speed.<ref name=HowStuffWorks/>

[[File:1000000th Beetle.jpg|thumb|left|The jeweled one-millionth Type 1]]
Following the British Army-led restart of production and Hirst's establishment of sales network and exports to Netherlands, former [[Opel]] manager (and formerly a detractor of the Volkswagen) [[Heinrich Nordhoff|Heinz Nordhoff]] was appointed director of the Volkswagen factory in 1949.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref name="autogenerated3" /> Under Nordhoff, production increased dramatically over the following decade, with the one-millionth car coming off the assembly line by 1955. During this post-war period, the Beetle had superior performance in its category with a top speed of {{convert |115|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and {{convert|0|–|100|km/h}} in 27.5&nbsp;seconds with fuel consumption of {{convert|6.7|l/100 km}} for the standard {{convert |25|kW|hp|abbr=on}} engine. This was far superior to the [[Citroën 2CV]], which was aimed at a low speed/poor road rural peasant market, and [[Morris Minor]], designed for a market with no motorways or freeways; it was even competitive with more advanced small [[city car]]s like the [[Mini|Austin Mini]].

In ''Small Wonder'', Walter Henry Nelson wrote:
{{Quote |The engine fires up immediately without a choke. It has tolerable road-handling and is economical to maintain. Although a small car, the engine has great elasticity and gave the feeling of better output than its small nominal size.{{citation needed|date= June 2016}}}}

There were other, less-numerous models, as well. The [[Hebmüller]] cabriolet (officially [[Volkswagen Type 14A (Hebmüller Cabriolet)|Type 14A]]), a sporty two-seater, was built between 1949 and 1953; it numbered 696. The [[Volkswagen Type 18A|Type 18A]], a fixed-top cabriolet, was produced by [[Austro-Tatra]] as a police and fire unit; 203 were assembled between January 1950 and March 1953.<ref>''Hot VWs'', 7/84, p.38.</ref>

[[File:Quatro vistas do fusca.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Four views.]]
Though extremely successful in the 1960s, experiencing its greatest sales growth in North America between 1960 and 1965, the Beetle was increasingly faced with stiff competition from more modern designs globally. The Japanese had refined rear-wheel-drive, water-cooled, front-engine, small cars including the [[Datsun 510]] and [[Toyota Corona]], whose sales in the North American market grew rapidly at the expense of Volkswagen in the late 1960s. [[Honda]] introduced the [[Honda N360|N600]], based on the space-efficient transverse-engine, front-wheel-drive layout of the original [[Austin Mini]], to the North American market in late 1969, and upgraded the model to the [[Honda Civic]] in 1972.  The Japanese "big three" would soon dominate compact auto sales in North America.  In 1971 [[Ford]] introduced its [[Ford Pinto|Pinto]], which had some market impact as a low cost alternative in the wake of the [[Nixon shock|drop of the US Dollar against the Deutsche Mark]] that same year.  As the 1960s came to a close, Volkswagen faced increasingly stiff competition from European cars as well.  The Beetle was faced with competition from new designs like the [[Fiat 127]] and [[Renault 5]], and more robust designs based on the Austin Mini layout such as the [[supermini car|Superminis]]. German competitors, [[Ford]] and [[Opel]] also enjoyed strong sales of modern smaller cars like the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] and [[Opel Kadett]].  Volkswagen's attempts to boost the power of their air-cooled motor to meet the demands of higher highway speeds in the late 1960s, then comply with new pollution control regulations, caused problems for reliability and fuel efficiency that impaired the reputation of the aging design.  Safety issues with the Beetle came under increasing scrutiny, culminating in the 1972 release of a rather scathing report.<ref>{{cite book|author=Center for Auto Safety|title=Small on Safety:The designed-in dangers of the Volkswagen|date= 1972|isbn=978-0670652495}}</ref> During the early 1970s, sales of the Beetle in Europe and North America plummeted.

VW introduced other models to supplement the Beetle throughout the 1960s; the [[VW Type 3|Type 3]], [[VW Type 4|Type 4]], and the NSU-based and larger [[VW K70|K70]].  None of these models, aimed at more upscale markets, achieved the level of success of the Beetle. The over-reliance on a single model, now in decline, meant that Volkswagen was in financial crisis by 1974. It needed German government funding to produce the Beetle's replacement.

Production lines at Wolfsburg switched to the new water-cooled, front-engined, [[front-wheel-drive]] [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] in 1974, sold in North America at the time as the "Rabbit".  The Golf eventually became Volkswagen's most successful model since the Beetle. It was periodically redesigned over its lifetime, with only a few components carried over between generations, entering its seventh generation in 2012; the Beetle had only minor refinements of its original design.

The Golf did not kill Beetle production, nor did the smaller [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]] which was launched a year later. Production of the Beetle continued in smaller numbers at other German factories until 19 January 1978, when mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico: markets where low operating cost was an important factor. After this shift in production, sales in Europe did not stop, but became very low. Beetle sedans were produced for U.S. markets until July 1977<ref name="TheSamba.com">Beetle VIN / Chassis Numbers - TheSamba.com {{cite web|url=http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/info/bugchassisdating.php|title=Beetle VIN / Chassis Numbers - TheSamba.com}}</ref> and for European markets until 1985, with other companies continuing to import cars produced in Mexico after 1985. The Beetle convertible/Cabriolet ended production (as 1979 models) on 31 January 1980.<ref name="TheSamba.com"/>

The last Beetle was produced in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], Mexico, in July 2003.<ref name="AutoMotoruSport200313"/> The final batch of 3,000 Beetles were sold as 2004 models and badged as the ''Última Edición'', with [[whitewall tires]], a host of previously discontinued chrome trim, and the choice of two special paint colors taken from the [[New Beetle]]. Production in Brazil ended in 1986, then started again in 1993 and continued until 1996.

The Beetle outlasted most other cars which had adopted the rear-engine, air-cooled layout such as those by [[Subaru 360|Subaru]], [[Fiat]], and [[Chevrolet Corvair|General Motors]]. Porsche's 356 series which originally used some Volkswagen-sourced parts, continued to use the classic rear-engine layout (which later became water cooled) in the [[Porsche 911]] 996 series, which remains competitive in the third decade of the 21st century.

=== Worldwide end of production ===
[[File:Volkswagen Bubbla sista bilen.jpg|thumb|"Última Edición" (Final Edition) in Aquarius Blue (2003).]]
By 2002, over 21 million Type 1s had been produced, but by 2003, annual production had dropped to 30,000 from a peak of 1.3&nbsp;million in 1971. VW announced the end of production in June 2003, citing decreasing demand, and the final original Type 1 VW Beetle (No. 21,529,464) rolled off the production line at [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], Mexico, on 30 July 2003,<ref name=AutoMotoruSport200313>{{cite journal| authorlink =Bernd Ostmann (Ed) | title =Am 9.

This last Beetle, nicknamed ''El Rey'' (Spanish for "The King" after a legendary Mexican song by [[José Alfredo Jiménez]]) was delivered to the company's museum in [[Wolfsburg]], Germany.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

To celebrate the occasion, Volkswagen marketed a final, special series of 3,000 Beetles marketed as "Última Edición" (Final Edition) in light blue (Aquarius Blue) or beige (Harvest Moon Beige). Each car included the 1.6 engine, whitewall tires, a CD player with four speakers, chrome bumpers, trim, hub caps and exterior mirrors, a Wolfsburg emblem above the front trunk's handle, an all-cloth interior, chrome glove box badge, body coloured wheels, tinted glass, a rear parcel shelf, and VW Última Edición plaque.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/accidentally-like-a-martyr-2003-vw-beetle-ltima-edicin/|website=www.hemmings.com|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>

A [[mariachi]] band serenaded production of the last car. In Mexico, there was an advertising campaign as a goodbye for the Beetle. In one of the ads was a very small parking space on the street, and many big cars tried to use it, but could not. After a while, a sign appears in that parking space saying: "''Es increíble que un auto tan pequeño deje un vacío tan grande''" (It is incredible that a car so small can leave such a large void). Another depicted the rear end of a 1954 Beetle (the year Volkswagen was established in Mexico) in the left side of the ad, reading "''Erase una vez''..." (Once upon a time...) and the last 2003 Beetle in the right side, reading "''Fin''" (The end). Other ads also had the same nostalgic tone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5829730936290376436 |url-status=dead |title=Mexican VW Beetle TV Ad |accessdate=2010-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607114331/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5829730936290376436 |archive-date=7 June 2011 }}</ref>

In 1951, Volkswagen prototyped a 1.3&nbsp;L [[diesel engine]]. Volkswagen made only two of these naturally aspirated, air-cooled boxer diesel engines, and installed one engine in a Type 1 and another in a [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2]]. The diesel Beetle was time tested on the [[Nürburgring]] and achieved 0–100&nbsp;km/h (0–62&nbsp;mph) in 60 seconds.<ref name="ltv-vwc.org.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.ltv-vwc.org.uk/wheelspin/ws_aug-sept-2003/diesel-beetle.html|title=The Diesel Beetle|accessdate=3 April 2008|work=ltv-vwc.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720172027/http://www.ltv-vwc.org.uk/wheelspin/ws_aug-sept-2003/diesel-beetle.html|archive-date=20 July 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:1962 Volkswagen Beetle Engine (3564060578).jpg|right|thumb|1962 Volkswagen Beetle Engine]]
The Beetle featured a rear-located, rear-wheel drive, air-cooled four-cylinder, [[boxer engine]] in a two-door bodywork featuring a flat front windscreen, accommodating four passengers and providing luggage storage under the front bonnet and behind the rear seat—and offering a [[coefficient of drag]] of 0.48;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Etzold |first1=H.R. |title=The Beetle: The Chronicles of the People's Car |year=1988 |publisher=Haynes |isbn=0854298452 |page=136}}</ref> to this relatively good C<sub>d</sub>, the also streamlined rear of the car was of help. The bodywork attached with eighteen bolts to its nearly flat [[platform chassis]] which featured a central structural tunnel. Front and rear suspension featured [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] along with front stabilizer bar—providing independent suspension at all wheels. Certain initial features were subsequently revised, including mechanical drum brakes, split-window rear windows, mechanical direction-indicators, and the non-synchronized gearbox.  Other features, including its distinctive overall shape, endured. In fact, the Beetle was prized for its seemingly unchanged appearance and "marketed to American consumers as the anti-GM and Ford: 'We do not believe in [[planned obsolescence]]. We don't change a car for the sake of change.'"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279–298|doi=10.2752/175470812X13361292229078|s2cid=143319829}}</ref>

Its engine, transmission, and cylinder heads were constructed of light alloy. An engine oil cooler (located in the engine fan's shroud) ensured optimal engine operating temperature and long engine life, optimized by a thermostat that bypassed the oil cooler when the engine was cold. Later models featured an automatic [[choke valve|choke]]. Engine intake air passed through a metallic filter, while heavier particles were captured by an oil bath. After 1960, steering featured a hydraulic damper that absorbed steering irregularities.

Indicative of the car's utilitarian design, the interior featured painted metal surfaces, a metal dash consolidating instruments in a single, circular [[binnacle]], adjustable front seats, a fold-down rear seat, optional swing-out rear windows, front windows with pivoting vent windows, heating via air-to-air exchange manifolds operating off the engine's heat, and a windshield washer system that eschewed the complexity and cost of an additional electric pump and instead received its pressurization from the car's spare tire (located in the front luggage compartment) which was accordingly overinflated to accommodate the washer function.

Throughout its production, VW marketed the Beetle with a four-speed manual transmission. From 1961 (and almost exclusively in Europe),<ref>{{cite web|title=Käfer 1200 Limousine (1954–1973): Modellpflege |trans-title=Beetle 1200 sedan (1954–1973): Model changes |language=German |publisher=Volkswagen |work=Volkswagen Classic |url=http://www.volkswagen-classic.de/modelle/kaefer-1200-limousine-1954-1965 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130212214136/http://www.volkswagen-classic.de/modelle/kaefer-1200-limousine-1954-1965 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-02-12 |at="''Modellpflege''" tab }}</ref> VW offered an optional version of the [[Saxomat]] [[semi-automatic transmission]]: a regular 4-speed manual transaxle coupled to an [[electromagnetic clutch]] with a [[centrifugal clutch]] used for idle. Subsequently, (beginning in 1967 in Europe and 1968 in the United States), VW offered an optional [[semi-automatic transmission]] (marketed as ''Automatic Stick Shift'' and also called ''[[AutoStick]]'',{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}) which was a 3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] coupled to an [[Electric current|electro]]-[[pneumatic]] clutch and torque converter.<ref name="autostick">{{cite web | title = Volkswagen New Beetle History | publisher = Edmunds.com  | url = http://www.edmunds.com/volkswagen/new-beetle/history.html}}</ref>

While the overall appearance of the Beetle changed little over its life span, it received over 78,000&nbsp;incremental changes during its production.<ref name="willson"/>

=== Beetle cabriolet ===
[[File:12-02-02-autostadt-wolfsburg-070.jpg|thumb|1960 VW 1200 Cabriolet]]
It was in 1948 that Wilhelm Karmann first bought a VW Beetle [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] and converted it into a four-seated [[convertible (car)|convertible]].  After successfully presenting it at VW in Wolfsburg the Beetle Cabriolet began production in 1949 by [[Karmann]] in [[Osnabrück]].

The convertible was more than a Beetle with a folding top. To compensate for the strength lost in removing the roof, the sills were reinforced with welded U-channel rails, a transverse beam was fitted below the front edge of the rear seat cushion, and the side cowl-panels below the instrument panel were double-wall. In addition, the lower corners of the door apertures had welded-in curved gussets, and the doors had secondary alignment wedges at the B-pillar.

The top was cabriolet-style with a full inner headliner hiding the folding mechanism and crossbars. In between the two top layers was {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} of insulation. The rear window was tempered safety glass, and after 1968, heated. Due to the thickness of the top, it remained quite tall when folded. To enable the driver to see over the lowered top, the inside rearview was mounted on an offset pivot. By twisting the mirror 180 degrees on a longitudinal axis, the mirror glass would raise approximately {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on}}.

The convertible was generally more lavishly equipped than the sedan with dual rear ashtrays, twin map pockets, a visor vanity mirror on the passenger side, rear stone shields, and through 1969, wheel trim rings. Many of these items did not become available on other Beetles until the advent of the optional "L" (Luxus) Package of 1970.

After a number of stylistic and technical alterations made to the Karmann cabriolet,<ref>{{cite web |author=Jon Gilbert |url=http://www.volksworld.com/news/cars/279437/1963-vw-beetle-cabriolet.html |title=volksworld.com |publisher=volksworld.com |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2012-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809014310/http://www.volksworld.com/news/cars/279437/1963-vw-beetle-cabriolet.html |archive-date=9 August 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> (corresponding to the many changes VW made to the Beetle throughout its history), the last of 331,847 cabriolets came off the production line on 10 January 1980.

===1950–1959 models===
[[File:VW Käfer blue 1956 vr TCE.jpg|thumb|1956 Volkswagen Beetle]]

During this period, myriad changes were made throughout the vehicle beginning with the availability of hydraulic brakes and a folding fabric sunroof in 1950.  The rear window of the VW Beetle evolved from a divided or "split" oval, to a singular oval. The change occurred between October 1952 and March 1953.<ref name="Ponchard">{{cite journal|last=Ponchard|first=Nathan|title=Auction Action|journal=Unique Cars|date=27 February 2013|issue=347|page=22|url=http://www.uniquecarsmag.com.au|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref> Beetles built during this time were known as a "Zwitter", or "hybrid", as they used the split-window bodyshell with oval-model chrome trim, vent windows and dashboard.<ref name="Ponchard" />

1953 models received a redesigned instrument panel.  The one-piece "Pope's Nose" combination license plate/brake light was replaced by a smaller flat-bottomed license plate light. The brake light function was transferred to new heart-shaped lamps located in the top of the taillight housings.<ref>{{cite book|  title=Vintage Volkswagens |  url=https://archive.org/details/vintagevolkswage00flat |  url-access=registration |publisher=Flat 4 Project/Chronicle Books| location=San Francisco| year=1985}}</ref>

In 1954, Volkswagen added {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} to the cylinder bore, increasing the [[engine displacement|displacement]] from 1,131 (1100)&nbsp;cc to 1,192 (1200)&nbsp;cc.<ref name=PracticalMotorist1961>{{cite journal|journal=Practical Motorist |volume = 7 | issue = 81  |title =Knowing your Volkswagen | page = 943|date=May 1961}}</ref> This coincided with upgrades to various key components including a redesign of the crankshaft. This increased power from {{convert|30|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} to {{convert|36|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} and improved the engine's free revving abilities without compromising torque at lower engine speeds.<ref name=PracticalMotorist1961/> At the same time, compression ratios were progressively raised as, little by little, the octane ratings of available fuel was raised in major markets during the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name=PracticalMotorist1961/>

In 1955, the separate brake lights were discontinued and were combined into a new larger taillight housing.  The traditional VW semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional flashing directional indicator lamps for North America.

For 1956, the Beetle received what would become one of its more distinctive features, a set of twin chrome tailpipes. Models for North America gained taller bumper guards and tubular overrider bars.

For 1958, the Beetle received a revised instrument panel, and a larger rectangular rear window replaced the previous oval design.

===1960–1969 models===

1960 models received a front [[sway bar|anti roll bar]] along with hydraulic [[steering damper]].

For 1961, significant technical advances occurred in the form of a new engine and transmission. The engine remained at {{cvt|1192|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} but the power increased to {{convert|40|bhp|PS kW|abbr=on}} at 3900 rpm and {{convert|88|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 2400 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.conceptcarz.com/s7533/Volkswagen-Beetle.aspx|website=conceptcarz|title=1963 Volkswagen Beetle Technical Specifications and Dimensions|accessdate=1 July 2018}}</ref> primarily due to an increase in [[compression ratio]] to 7.1:1. The single-barrel [[Solex Carburetor|Solex]] [[carburetor]] received an electric automatic choke and the transmission was now [[Manual transmission#Synchromesh|synchronized]] on all forward gears. The traditional semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional flashing directional indicators worldwide. The standard model called the TYPE 111–112, continued to use the 36&nbsp;hp 1200 engine of the old architecture that dates back to Franz Reimspiess original design of 1937 all the way until the end of the 1965 model year. 1965 standard model in 1965 is called the "A" sedan.

For 1962, the Beetle received a mechanical fuel level gauge in place of the former fuel tap. The Standard model continued without a gas gauge until the end of the 1965 model year. At the rear, larger tail lights were introduced incorporating a separate amber turn signal section to meet new European standards (these turn signals remained red in the US market until 1973). The former hand-pump style windscreen washer was replaced by a new design using compressed air. A [[Schrader valve]] located on the washer fluid tank allowed the system to be charged at a filling station to the recommended {{convert|35|psi|bar|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Beetle: The Chronicles of the People's Car| author=H.R. Etzold| publisher = Haynes Publishing Group |date= 1988 | page = 77 }}</ref>

1964 models could be identified by a widened light housing on the engine lid over the rear license plate, however the standard model continued to use the old teardrop style to the end of the 1965 model run.

The largest change to date for the Beetle was in 1965: the majority of the body stampings were revised, which allowed for significantly larger windows. The windshield increased in area by 11% and was now slightly curved, rather than flat. Door windows increased accordingly by 6% (and door vent window edges were canted slightly back), rear side windows 17.5%, and the rear window 19.5%. The result was a more open, airy, modern look.<ref name="Small Wonder">{{Cite book | title = Small Wonder| author=Walter Henry Nelson| publisher = Little, Brown and Co. |date= 1970 | page = 308 }}</ref>

For 1966, the big news was an optional new 1300cc {{convert|50|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} engine in lieu of the previous 1200cc engine that had been the sole engine since 1954. Models so equipped carried a "1300" badge on the engine lid. The 1300cc engine was standard for North America.

For 1967, a yet-again larger-[[engine displacement|displacement]] engine was made available: [[Volkswagen air-cooled engine|1500cc]], {{convert|53|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} at 4,200&nbsp;rpm.<ref name="TAM67">{{Cite book | title = Quattroruote Speciale: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1967 | publisher = Editoriale Domus S.p.A |date=February 1967 | language = Italian | pages = 296–298 | location = Milano }}</ref> 1200 and 1300 engines continued to be available, as many markets based their taxation on engine size.<ref name="TAM67"/> 1500cc Beetles were equipped with front disc brakes and were identified with a "VW 1500" badge on the engine lid. North America received the 1500 engine as standard equipment, but did not receive front disc brakes. These models were identified by a "Volkswagen" badge on the engine lid.

The rear suspension was significantly revised and included a widened track, softer torsion bars and the addition of a unique ''Z-configuration'' equalizing torsion spring. On US, UK and Ireland models, the generator output was increased from 180 to 360&nbsp;watts, and the entire electrical system was upgraded from 6 to 12 volts. The clutch disc also increased in size and changes were made to the [[flywheel]]. New equipment included a driver's armrest on the door and locking buttons on both doors. Safety improvements included two-speed [[windscreen wiper]]s, reversing lights (in some markets), and a driver's side mirror. In accord with the newly enacted US [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108]], North American models received a dual-circuit brake system, the clear glass [[headlamp]] covers were deleted; the headlamps were brought forward to the leading edge of the front fenders, and the sealed-beam units were exposed and surrounded by chrome bezels. In the rest of the world markets the 1967 model retained the older headlights. Another oddity of the 1967 North American market Beetle is the rear bumper overriders (towel rails) – the overriders have a different shape than the older models besides the one-year only engine decklid.{{clarify|reason=what does the end of this sentence (from "besides") mean?|date=October 2018}} The Brazilian market model (Volkswagen Fusca) retained the pre-1967 headlamps until 1972.{{Citation needed|reason=Entire paragraph needs a source, please|date=October 2018}}

[[File:'68 VW 1500.jpg|thumb|1968 Type 1]]
1968 was a year of major change. The most noticeable of which were the new larger, higher mounted C-section bumpers. At the rear, new larger taillamps were adopted and were able to accommodate reversing lamps, which were previously separate bumper-mounted units. Beetles worldwide received the '67 North American style vertical headlamp placement, but with replaceable-bulb headlamps compliant with [[ECE regulations]] rather than the US sealed beams. Other improvements were a new outside gas filler with spring-loaded flap, eliminating the need to open the trunk to refuel. The fuel gauge was integrated with the speedometer and was now electrically actuated rather than cable-operated. The windscreen washer was now pressured by the spare tire, which was to be maintained at a pressure of {{convert|42|psi|bar|abbr=on}}. A pressure valve in the connecting hose closed airflow to the fluid reservoir if spare tire pressure fell below {{convert|30|psi|bar|abbr=on}}, which was above the recommended pressures for the road tires.<ref>">{{Cite book | title = The Beetle: The Chronicles of the People's Car| author=H.R. Etzold| publisher = Haynes Publishing Group |date= 1988 | page = 123 }}</ref> A ventilation system was introduced, which drew fresh air into the cabin from louvres on the front decklid.  For improved shifting, the shift lever was shortened, stiffened and moved rearward by {{convert|78|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

A number of safety improvements were made in order to comply with new American safety regulations: these included trigger-operated outside door handles, a secondary front hood latch, collapsing steering column, soft vent window latches, rotary glove compartment latch and instrument panel knobs labeled with [[pictographs]]. US models received a padded instrument panel that was optional in other markets. To meet North American head restraint requirements, VW developed the industry's first high-back bucket seat.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Standard model 111–112, called the 1200 "A" still used the 1200 engine but for the first time for Europe it came with a 12 volt system.

[[File:'68 Volkswagen AutoStick Badge.jpg|thumb|'68–'69 Automatic ''StickShift'' badge]]

A new 3-speed [[semi-automatic transmission]] with [[torque converter]] and vacuum-operated clutch became available mid-production year. The semi-automatic models received a vastly improved [[Trailing arm|semi-trailing-arm]] rear suspension (also known as "independent rear suspension" although the earlier swing axle Beetles were also [[Suspension (vehicle)#Independent suspension|independent]]) and eliminated the need for the equalizing torsion spring. This new rear suspension layout would eventually become an option on later models. Beetles equipped with the automatic were identified with a "VW Automatic" badge on the engine lid and a matching decal in the rear window. In North America, the badging and decal were later revised to read, "Automatic ''Stick Shift''".

For 1969, the only exterior change was the fuel filler flap no longer had a finger indentation due to a new interior-mounted fuel door release. For North America, the Beetle received a heated rear window, day/night mirror and the semi-trailing, independent suspension with double jointed swing axles as standard equipment. In other markets, manual transmission models retained a swing axle independent suspension which would continue until the end of German Beetle production.

===1970–1979 models===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2020}}
In 1970, a new "L" (Luxus) Package was introduced including, among other items, twin map pockets, dual rear ashtrays, full carpeting, a passenger-side visor vanity mirror, and rubber bumper moldings. The optional 1500&nbsp;cc engine now came with an engine lid having two rows of cooling louvers, while the convertible's engine lid gained two additional sets for a total of four. For North America, the 1500&nbsp;cc engine was enlarged to 1600&nbsp;cc engine and produced {{convert|57|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}

There were two Beetles for the first time in 1971, the familiar standard Beetle and a new, larger version, different from the windscreen forward. All Beetles received an engine upgrade: the optional 1500 cc engine was replaced by a 1600 cc with twin-port cylinder heads and a larger, relocated oil cooler. The new engine produced {{convert|60|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}. The ventilation system was improved with the original dash-top vents augmented by a second pair aimed directly at the driver and passenger. For the first time the system was a flow-through design with crescent-shaped air exits fitted behind the rear quarter windows. Airflow could be increased via an optional 2-speed fan. The standard Beetle was now badged as the VW 1300; when equipped with the 1600 engine, it was badged 1300 S, to avoided confusion with the Type 3, which wore VW 1600 badges.

The new, larger Beetle was sold as the 1302/1302 S, offering nearly 43% more luggage capacity, up from 140 liters in front to 260 (remaining at 140 in back)<ref name="The Beetle: The Chronicles of the People's Car.">{{Cite book | title = The Beetle: The Chronicles of the Peoples' Car | author= Volkswagen of America| publisher = Haynes Publishing. |date= 1988 | pages = 140}}</ref> A new [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension was incorporated, similar to what was used in the Type 4, and the front track was widened. The new suspension layout allowed the spare tire to be positioned flat under the trunk floor. Although the car had to be lengthened slightly to accomplish this, it allowed a reduction in turning radius. To gain additional trunk volume, the under-dash panel{{clarify|date=May 2017|what is that, exactly?}} was lowered, allowing the fuel tank to be shifted rearward. From the windscreen back the big Beetle was identical to its smaller progenitor, except for having the also new [[trailing-arm suspension|semi-trailing arm]] rear suspension as standard equipment. Overall, the bigger Beetle was {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} longer, {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} wider, and rode on a {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}}-longer wheelbase. Both Beetles were available with or without the L Package. The convertible was now based on the 1302 body. In North America, the 1302 was marketed as the Super Beetle and came only with the L Package and 1600 cc engine. While it lacked the front disc brakes that normally accompanied the larger motor, it was fitted with brake drums that were slightly larger than the standard Beetle. With the Super Beetle being sold as the premium model in North America, the standard Beetle, while retaining the same 1600 cc engine, was stripped of many of its earlier features in order to reduce the selling price. Bright window and running board moldings disappeared, along with the day/night mirror, horn ring, map pocket, locking glove box and miscellaneous other items.

1972 models had an 11% larger rear window ({{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} taller), and the convertible engine lid with four rows of louvres was now used on all Beetles. Inside the vehicle, a four-spoke energy-absorbing steering wheel was introduced, the windshield wiper/washer knob was replaced in favor of a steering column stalk, and intermittent wipers were a new option available in selected markets. An engine compartment socket for the proprietary VW Diagnosis system was also introduced. The rear luggage area was fitted with a folding parcel shelf. A limited-edition Commemorative model was launched in celebration of the Beetle's passing the record of the Ford Model T as the world's most-produced automobile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sebeetles.com/marathon/ |title=1972 Marathon Beetle - All the VW Beetle Special Editions |publisher=SE Beetles |date=2016-05-20 |accessdate=2016-07-10}}</ref> The Commemorative Beetle was a 1302 S finished in a special Marathon Blue Metallic paint and unique 4.5 x 15 styled steel wheels. In the U.S., it was marketed as the Super Beetle Baja Champion SE.

[[File:Volkswagen Beetle .jpg|thumb|1973 1303/Super Beetle]]
[[File:1973-1974 Volkswagen "1303 Big", Istanbul.jpg|left|thumb|1973–74 1303/Super Beetle "Big"]]

1973 models featured significantly enlarged "elephant foot" taillamps mounted in reshaped rear fenders. In the engine bay, the oil-bath air cleaner gave way to a dry element filter, and the generator was replaced with an alternator. The 1302/Super became the 1303 with a new taller wrap-around windscreen. The changes to the cowl and windshield resulted in slight redesign of the front hood. The instrument panel, formerly shared with the standard Beetle, was all-new and incorporated a raised speedometer pod, rocker-style switches and side-window defrosters.  The limited-edition GSR (Gelb-Schwarzer Renner; German for "Yellow-Black Racer") was a 1303 S available only in Saturn Yellow paint equipped with special {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels fitted with 175/70-15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36 high-performance radial tires. Front and rear deck lids were finished in matte black, as was all exterior trim with the exception of the chrome headlamp bezels. Inside were [[corduroy]] and leatherette high-bolstered sport seats and a small diameter three-spoke steering wheel with padded leather rim and a small red VW logo on the bottom spoke. In North America, the GSR was sold as the Super Beetle Sports Bug. The North American model had body-color deck lids and was available in Marathon Blue Metallic in addition to Saturn Yellow. In some markets, the sport wheels (in both 4.5-inch and 5.5-inch widths), sport steering wheel and sport seats became available as stand-alone options.

For 1974, North American models received newly required {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} impact bumpers mounted on self-restoring energy absorbers, which added approximately {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} to the car's overall length. On the Super Beetle, the steering knuckle, and consequently the lower attachment point of the strut, was redesigned to improve handling and stability in the event of a tire blowout. A limited-edition Big Beetle was introduced based on the 1303 LS. Available in unique metallic paint colors, the car featured styled-steel {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels wrapped in 175/70-15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36 tires, corduroy seat inserts, upgraded loop-pile carpet, wood-look instrument panel trim and a padded steering wheel with bright accents. In the North American market, a limited-edition Sun Bug was introduced as a standard Beetle or Super Beetle. Both were finished in metallic gold and featured styled-steel {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}-wide sport wheels. Inside were brown corduroy and leatherette seats, loop-pile carpet, and padded four-spoke deluxe steering wheel. The Super Beetle Sun Bug included a sliding-steel sunroof. Mid-year, the Love Bug was introduced for North America: based on the standard Beetle, it was available only in Phoenix Red or Ravenna Green (both colors shared with the [[Porsche 914|VW-Porsche 914]]) with all exterior trim finished in matte black. A price leader, the Love Bug retailed for less than a standard Beetle.

In 1975, front turn indicators were moved from the top of the front fenders down into the bumper. At the rear, the license plate light housing was now molded of plastic with a ribbed top surface. To comply with tightening emission standards, the 1600 cc engine in Japanese and North American markets received Bosch [[Jetronic#L|L-Jetronic]] fuel injection, rather than the [[Jetronic#D|D-Jetronic]] system formerly used in the VW Type 3 and Type 4. The injected engine received a new muffler and in California a catalytic converter. This necessitated a bulge in the rear apron under the rear bumper and replaced the distinctive twin "pea shooter" tailpipes with a single offset pipe, making injected models identifiable at a glance.  {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} bumper-equipped North American models retained fender-top front indicators. The 1303 received rack and pinion steering. In North America, the 1303/Super Beetle sedan was moved upmarket and was now christened La Grande Bug. Similar to the Big Beetle of 1974, La Grande Bug was available in blue or green metallic paint in the U.S. and blue, green or gold metallic in Canada and was equipped with the same features as the 1974 Sun Bug. The "Volkswagen" script on the engine lid of all North American Beetles was replaced with a "Fuel Injection" badge.

In 1976, the 1303/La Grande Bug was discontinued, with the larger body continuing only in convertible form. To make up for the loss in North American markets, the standard Beetle was upgraded, regaining some of the features that were removed in 1971. In addition, the 2-speed ventilation fan was included, previously available in North America only on the larger Beetle. The automatic stickshift option was discontinued as well.

1977 models received new front seats with separate head restraints.  This was the final model year for the Beetle sedan in North America. The convertible was offered in a "triple white" Champagne Edition in Alpine White with white top and interior with the padded deluxe steering wheel, tiger maple wood-grain dash trim and {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels. Approximately 1,000 Champagne Editions were produced.

For 1978, a new Champagne 2nd Edition convertible was launched, available in blue or red metallic paint with white leatherette interior. Features included the {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide styled steel sport wheels, AM/FM radio, analog [[quartz clock]], padded deluxe steering wheel and rosewood-grain instrument panel trim. Approximately 1,100 were produced.

In 1979, VW offered an Epilogue Edition of the convertible in triple black with features similar to the 1978 Champagne Edition. This would be the last year of convertible production worldwide as well as the final year for the Beetle in the US and Canada.

=== United Kingdom ===
In 1952, John Colborne-Baber began to import small numbers of Beetles largely to satisfy demand from US Air Force personnel stationed in [[Kent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/timeline/index?decade=1950&q=&&#list|publisher=Vollkswagen Group UK |title = The Volkswagen Timeline | accessdate = 30 September 2012}}</ref> Today, Colborne Garages still hold the Volkswagen franchises for [[Guildford]] and [[Walton-on-Thames]]. In 1953 J.Gilder & Co. Ltd. in [[Sheffield]], began selling Beetles. Jack Gilder had been fascinated by both the design and engineering of the Beetle when he came across one in Belgium during the war.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} He applied for the franchise as soon as the opportunity presented itself and became Volkswagen's representative in the North of England. In 2013 the Gilder Group was acquired by [[JCT600]].

=== Japan ===
The Type 1 was introduced to Japan in 1953, and was imported by [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase]] dealerships in Japan. Its exterior dimensions and engine displacement were in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|regulations]], which helped sales. Several Japanese vehicles were introduced after the Beetle was sold in Japan, using an air-cooled engine and rear mounting of the engine, such as the [[Subaru 360]], or an engine installed in the front, like the [[Honda N360]], the [[Suzuki Fronte]], and the [[Mitsubishi Minica]].

== International production ==
German production of the Beetle took place initially at the parent Wolfsburg plant until the Golf's introduction in 1974, later expanding to the newer Emden and Hanover plants.  Volkswagen's takeover of [[Auto Union]] in 1964 saw 60,000 cars per year<ref name=Motor19710724>{{cite journal| first=Philip |last=Turner| title = Turner's Travel [to Wolfsburg]| journal=Motor| pages = 28–30|date = 24 July 1971}}</ref> being produced on the [[Audi]] assembly lines in [[Ingolstadt]] until 1971. The last German made cars were assembled at Emden in 1978, after which the Puebla, Mexico plant became the principal source of Beetle production.  Other countries produced Beetles from CKD (complete [[knockdown kit]]s): Ireland, Thailand, Indonesia, South Africa, Australia, Yugoslavia (city of Sarajevo), and Nigeria have assembled Beetles under license from VW.<ref>{{Citation | title = Volkswagens of the World}}</ref>

Beetles produced in Mexico and Brazil had several differences:

=== Brazil ===
[[File:1969 Volkswagen 1300.jpg|thumb|1969 Brazilian 1300 Sedan (''Fusca'')]]

Brazilian assembly of the Beetle, where it is called "'''Fusca'''", started in 1953, with parts imported from Germany. By January 1959 the cars were built in the new [[São Bernardo do Campo]] plant, although they originally had 60% German parts content.<ref name=Stern136>{{cite journal| journal = [[Stern (magazine)|Der Stern]] | title = VW-Tochter: Erfolg mit Fusca | trans-title = VW-daughter: Fusca success | language = German | url = http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46414589.html | date = 1966-09-19 | page = 136 | ref = stern | publisher = Rudolf Augstein | number = 39 }}</ref> By the mid-sixties, the cars had 99.93% Brazilian parts content, with four German parts of a combined value of about one US dollar still being imported.<ref name=Stern136/> Production continued until 1986. In 1993 production resumed and continued to 1996. The Brazilian version retained the 1958–64 body style (Europe and U.S. version) with the thick door pillars and smaller side windows. This body style was also produced in Mexico until 1971. Around 1973, all Brazilian Beetles (1300 and 1500 series) were updated with the 1968-up sheet metal, bumpers, and four-lug rims; although the five-stud rims and "bugeye" headlights were produced as late as 1972 (the base VW 1200 and 1300 manufactured in Brazil was similar to the 1964 European/U.S. 1200 until the 1970 model year but came with vented wheels since the mid-1960s). The 1971 and 1972 1300s had the 1964-era taillights and headlights, fuel tank, but fitted with the 1968-up raised bumpers. Brazilian CKD kits were shipped to Nigeria between 1975 and 1987 where Beetles were locally assembled. The Brazilian-produced versions have been sold in neighboring South American nations bordering Brazil, including Argentina, Uruguay, and Peru.

The Brazilian Type 1s have four different engines: 1,200&nbsp;cc, 1,300&nbsp;cc, 1,500&nbsp;cc, and 1,600&nbsp;cc. In the 1970s, Volkswagen made the SP-2 (derived from the Type 1 pan and the Type 3 powertrain) with a 1,700&nbsp;cc engine (a [[cylinder bore|bored-out]] 1,600&nbsp;cc). In Brazil, the Type 1 never received electronic fuel injection, instead retaining carburetors (one or two one-barrels) throughout its entire life, although the carburetion differs from engines of different years and specification.

The production of the air-cooled engine finally ended in 2006, after more than 60 years.  It was last used in the Brazilian version of the [[Volkswagen Type 2|VW Bus]], called the "Kombi", and was replaced by a 1.4&nbsp;L water-cooled engine with a front-mounted cooling system. [[Volkswagen do Brasil]] engaged in some string pulling in the early sixties when a law requiring taxis to have four doors and five seats was being considered.

{{Main|Volkswagen Beetle in Mexico}}
Mexican production began in 1955 because of agreements with companies such as [[Chrysler]] in Mexico and the [[Studebaker-Packard Corporation]] which assembled cars imported in CKD form. In 1964, they began to be locally produced.  These models have the larger windshield, rear window, door and quarter glass starting in 1972; and the rear window from 1965 to 1971 German built models was used on the Mexican models from 1972 to 1985, when it was replaced with the larger rear window used on 1972 and later German built Beetles. This version, after the mid-1970s, saw little change with the incorporation of electronic ignition in 1988, an anti-theft alarm system in 1990, a [[catalytic converter]] in 1991 (as required by law), as well as electronic [[Digifant]] [[fuel injection]], hydraulic valve lifters, and a spin-on oil filter in 1993. The front turn signals were located in the bumper instead of the Beetle's traditional placement on top of the front fenders from the 1977 model year on, as they had been on German Beetles sold in Europe from 1975 onwards. Starting in 1995, the Mexican Beetle included front disc brakes, an alternator instead of a generator, and front automatic seat belts. During the 1995 model year, the chrome moldings disappeared leaving body colored bumpers and black moldings instead on some models. By the start of the 1996 model year, exterior chrome or matt moldings were dropped altogether and Volkswagen de Mexico (VWdM) dropped the Sedan's flow-through ventilation system with all its fittings, notably the exterior crescent-shaped vents behind the rear side windows the same year.

In mid-1996, front drum brakes and fixed front seat belts were re-launched in a new budget version called the "Volkswagen Sedán City", which was sold alongside the upscale version "Volkswagen Sedán Clásico" which had front disc brakes, automatic seat belts, right side mirror, velour upholstery, optional metallic colors and wheel covers in matte finish (also found on some 1980s Beetles and Buses). These two versions were sold until mid 1998. From mid 1998–2003, The Sedán Clásico was discontinued and the Sedán City lost its prefix and gained disc brakes, automatic seat belts and optional metallic colors. This last version was named the "Volkswagen Sedán Unificado" or simply the "Volkswagen Sedán".

[[File:Vochol09MAP.jpg|thumb|left| A Beetle decorated in the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] style of beading now on display at the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City]]

Independent importers continued to supply several major countries, including Germany, France, and the UK until the end of production in 2003.  Devoted fans of the car even discovered a way to circumvent US safety regulations by placing more recently manufactured Mexican Beetles on the [[floorpan]]s of earlier, US-registered cars. The Mexican Beetle (along with its Brazilian counterpart) was on the US DOT's (Department of Transportation) hot list of [[grey market]] imports after 1978 as the vehicle did not meet safety regulations.

In the Southwest US ([[Arizona]], California, [[New Mexico]], Texas), Mexican Beetles (and some [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T2)|Brazilian T2c Transporters]]) are a fairly common sight since Mexican nationals can legally operate the vehicle in the United States, provided the cars remain registered in Mexico. Some of the Mexican Beetles have been registered in the United States since the 1998 NHTSA amendment granting the 25-year cutoff where it (and its Brazilian counterpart including the T2C) can be legally registered in any of the 50 states (this means a 1995 or earlier Mexican Beetle as of 2020 can be registered under the current NHTSA 25-year cutoff exemption).

The end of production in Mexico can be attributed primarily to Mexican political measures: the Beetles no longer met [[emission standard]]s for Mexico City, in which the ubiquitous Beetles were used as taxicabs; and the government outlawed their use as taxicabs because of rising crime rates, requiring only four-door vehicles be used. The last Vocho taxis in Mexico City were retired at the end of 2012.<ref name=Hemmings>{{cite journal | title = Vochos No Mas | journal = Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car |date=June 2012 | last = Shea | first = Terry | page = 48 | issue = 10 | volume = 7 | publisher = [[Hemmings Motor News]] | location = Bennington, VT | issn = 1555-6867 }}</ref> In addition, Volkswagen (now Germany's largest automaker) has been attempting to cultivate a more upscale, premium brand image, and the humble Beetle clashed with this identity, as seen in the [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]] and [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] luxury vehicles. In the late 1990s consumers strongly preferred more modern cars such as the [[Opel Corsa#Opel Corsa B|Mexican Chevy]], the [[Nissan Tsuru#B13 (1991–1994)|Nissan Tsuru]], and the [[Volkswagen Gol#Gol G2 to G4 (1994-2008)|Volkswagen Pointer]] and [[Volkswagen Fox|Lupo]].

However, demand for the Beetle was relatively high, especially in the 1990s, with the workforce increasing at the start of the decade. The price of the base model (without even a radio) was pegged with the official minimum wage, by an agreement between the company and the government. In 1990 it cost US$5,300.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/20/world/mexico-city-journal-miss-the-vw-bug-it-lives-beyond-the-rio-grande.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Mark A. | last=Uhlig | title=Mexico City Journal; Miss the VW Bug?

=== Australia ===
Official importation of the Volkswagen Beetle into Australia began in 1953, with local assembly operations commencing the following year. Volkswagen Australia was formed in 1957, and by 1960 locally produced body panels were being used for the first time. When the European Type One body received the larger windows for the 1965 model year, Volkswagen Australia decided not to update, but continued to produce the smaller-windowed bodies, with unique features to the Australian versions. This was due to the limited size of the market and the costs involved in retooling. Australian content had reached almost 95% by this time.<ref name="clubvw.org.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.clubvw.org.au/history004 |title=1965 - 1969 - Club VeeDub |publisher=Clubvw.org.au |accessdate=2016-07-10}}</ref> The Australian subsidiary continued to produce the earlier body style until 1967, when declining sales forced a switch to CKD assembly using imported components the following year. In 1968, Volkswagen Australia released its own locally designed utilitarian version of the Type 1, the [[Volkswagen Country Buggy]] or Type 197.

The last Australian-assembled Beetle was produced in July 1976 with assembly of other models ending in February 1977.<ref name=clubvw>[http://www.clubvw.org.au/austvw001 Australian Volkswagens,www.clubvw.org.au] Retrieved 25 March 2018</ref> All Volkswagens for the Australian market have been fully imported since then.<ref name=clubvw/>

=== South Africa ===

The Beetle was also produced in South Africa at the Uitenhage plant from 31 August 1951 to 1979.  Several features from the Super Beetle were grafted onto the South African Beetle 1600S, such as curved windshield, new dashboard, and larger taillights, while retaining the Beetle chassis and mechanicals. The 1600 model was introduced to South Africa in 1972; it was marketed as the cheapest 1.6-liter car available there. In late 1976, the sporty SP 1600 Beetle arrived – this version received bright red, yellow, or silver paint with black stripes, a front spoiler, wide tyres, and a more powerful engine with twin carburettors and a freer flowing exhaust.<ref name=SAM1276>{{cite journal | ref = SAM1276 | journal = SA Motor | title = New VWs reflect determinedly cheerful mood | pages = 31–32 | last = Howard | first = Tony | publisher = Scott Publications | location = Cape Town, South Africa | date = December 1976 }}</ref> The interior was also sporty, with red tartan upholstery, a small steering wheel, and much matte black. Power crept up to {{convert|43|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}}, from 50&nbsp;PS. Also new for 1977 were rubber bumper strips for all 1600s, and the same taillights with backup lights were now fitted across the range.<ref name=SAM1276/>

The bigger-engined model was then phased out around August 1978, leaving only the 1300 model in production.<ref name=CarZA0778>{{cite magazine | magazine = CAR (South Africa) | title = by the way | author = Cotter | editor-last = Wright | editor-first = Cedric | volume = 22 | number = 7 | date = August 1978 | ref = DNLCV | page = 9 | publisher = Ramsay, Son & Parker (Pty) ltd. }}</ref>

==Influence claims==
Various cars and designs have each claimed to have been the original "influencers" of Porsche's Volkswagen concept.

===Béla Barényi===

[[Image:Barényi Béla-biztonsági fejlesztés.jpg|thumb|[[Béla Barényi]]]]
The Austro-Hungarian automotive engineer [[Béla Barényi]] is credited with designing a similarly shaped car in 1925, as early as five years before Porsche's People's car concept was unveiled.

===Standard Superior===
[[File:Standard Superior 1933.jpg|thumb|First model of the [[Standard Superior]], as introduced at the IAMA in Berlin in 1933]]

German engineer [[Josef Ganz]] designed a car, the "May Bug", that is very similar to the Volkswagen Beetle. Hitler saw the car in 1933 at an auto show.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hitler stole Beetle design from a Jew|url=http://books.hindustantimes.com/2012/01/hitler-stole-beetle-design-from-a-jew/|accessdate=16 January 2012|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=16 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119040355/http://books.hindustantimes.com/2012/01/hitler-stole-beetle-design-from-a-jew/|archivedate=19 January 2012}}</ref> There is a strong resemblance to the [[Standard Superior]], an automobile produced from 1933 to 1935 by Standard Fahrzeugfabrik of Ludwigsburg, Germany, founded by motorcycle maker Wilhelm Gutbrod and unrelated to the Standard Motor Company of England. These small cars were designed according to the patents by Josef Ganz and featured transverse, two-stroke, two-cylinder engines mounted in front of the rear axle.<ref name=ludvigsen>{{cite book

===Tatra===
[[File:V570a.jpg|thumb|[[Tatra V570]] prototype (1933)]]

The Austrian car designer [[Hans Ledwinka]] was a contemporary of Porsche working at the Czechoslovakian company [[Tatra (car)|Tatra]]. In 1931, Tatra built the [[Tatra V570|V570]] prototype, which had an [[air-cooled]] [[flat-twin engine]] mounted at the rear.<ref name="willson">Willson, Quentin ''The Ultimate Classic Car Book''. New York, NY: DK, 1995. {{ISBN|0-7894-0159-2}}. pp 214–15</ref> This was followed in 1933 by a second V570 prototype with a streamlined body similar to that of the Porsche Type 32.<ref name=ukcar>{{cite web|title=Brief History of Tatra|url=http://www.ukcar.com/history/Tatra/ |work=UKCar |accessdate=27 January 2011}}</ref> The [[rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout]] was a challenge for effective air cooling, and during development of the much larger [[V8 engine]]d [[Tatra 77]] in 1933 Tatra registered numerous patents related to air flow into the rear engine compartment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volny.cz/tatra.oldtimer/t77.htm |title = Tatra oldtimer: T77 |accessdate= 17 May 2010}}</ref> The use of Tatra's patented air cooling designs later became one of ten issues for which Tatra filed suit against VW.

Both Hitler and Porsche were influenced by the Tatras.<ref name="willson"/> Hitler was a keen automotive enthusiast, and had ridden in Tatras during political tours of Czechoslovakia.<ref name="willson"/> He had also dined numerous times with Ledwinka.<ref name="willson"/> After one of these dinners Hitler remarked to Porsche, "This is the car for my roads".<ref name="willson" /><ref name="mantle">{{Citation | title = Car Wars | first = Jonathan | last = Mantle | publisher = Arcade | year = 1997}}</ref> From 1933 onwards, Ledwinka and Porsche met regularly to discuss their designs,<ref name= ukcar /> and Porsche admitted "Well, sometimes I looked over his shoulder and sometimes he looked over mine" while designing the Volkswagen.<ref name="willson"/><ref name="mantle" /> The [[Tatra 97]] of 1936 had a 1,749&nbsp;cc, rear-located, rear-wheel drive, air-cooled four-cylinder [[boxer engine]].<ref name=ludvigsen/> It cost 5,600&nbsp;RM and accommodated five passengers<ref name=ludvigsen/> in its extensively streamlined four-door body, which provided luggage storage under the front bonnet and behind the rear seats. It also featured a similar central structural tunnel found in the Beetle.<ref name=ukcar/>

Just before the start of the Second World War, Tatra had ten legal claims filed against VW for infringement of patents.<ref name=ukcar/> Although Ferdinand Porsche was about to pay a settlement to Tatra, he was stopped by Hitler who said he would "solve his problem".<ref name=ukcar/> Tatra launched a lawsuit, but this was stopped when [[Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia|Germany invaded Czechoslovakia]] in 1938, resulting in the Tatra factory coming under Nazi administration in October 1938.<ref name=ludvigsen/> The T97, along with the T57, were ordered by Hitler to be removed from the Tatra display at the 1939 Berlin Autosalon<ref name=ukcar/> and Tatra was later directed to concentrate on heavy trucks and diesel engines, with all car models, except for the V8-engined [[Tatra 87]], being discontinued.<ref name=ludvigsen/> The matter was re-opened after World War II and in 1965 [[Volkswagen]] paid Ringhoffer-Tatra 1,000,000 ''[[Deutsche Mark]]s'' in an out of court settlement.<ref name=schmarbeck>{{cite book|last=Schmarbeck|first=Wolfgang|title=Hans Ledwinka: Seine Autos - Sein Leben|year=1997|publisher=H.

===Fedden===
[[File:Briggs or Tjaarda car Patent Application Drawing 5.jpg|{{largethumb}}|John Tjaarda's rear engine Briggs show car from 1933, patent drawings]]
On Sept 28, 1943, Roy Fedden, most known by his participation in the Bristol Single [[Sleeve valve]] engine research, headed by [[Harry Ricardo]], applied for a British patent 'Improvements related to road vehicles', granted GB570814, 24 July 1945, describing a 2-door, rear-engined car, identical in arrangement and look to VW 'Käfer'.

===Tjaarda's 'Briggs Dream Car'===
It has also been pointed out that the VW Beetle bears a striking resemblance to [[John Tjaarda]]'s 1933 design for a streamlined, rear-engined car, that he created working for [[Briggs Manufacturing Company]].<ref name=CARakoom>{{Cite web|url=http://carakoom.com/blog/15440|title=Who Really Styled the VW Beetle?|website=carakoom.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://carakoom.com/data/blogs/2299/15440/image/1_large.jpg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180630212349/http://carakoom.com/data/blogs/2299/15440/image/1_large.jpg|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 June 2018|date=30 June 2018}}</ref> At Briggs, a Detroit-based manufacturer of automobile bodies for Ford Motor Company, Chrysler Corporation and other U.S. and European automobile manufacturers, Tjaarda was developing a radical car for Ford to use as a new Lincoln. Ford displayed the show car at the 1933–34 Century of Progress Exhibition in Chicago as the "Briggs Dream Car".<ref name=CARakoom/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vorkriegsklassikerrundschau.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/briggs_prototyp_1933.jpg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701150911/https://vorkriegsklassikerrundschau.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/briggs_prototyp_1933.jpg|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 July 2018|date=1 July 2018}}</ref> One of the later designs looked almost exactly like the Beetle, if you shortened the wheelbase, and took out two side windows. It is even claimed that Porsche had visited Briggs automobiles one summer, when Tjaarda was head of R&D there, and several auto historians claim Porsche's People's Car was influenced by Tjaarda's designs, including the "Sterkenburg series" of the late twenties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coachbuilt.com/des/t/tjaarda/tjaarda_john.htm|title=Coachbult.com - John Tjaarda van Sterkenburg|website=www.coachbuilt.com}}</ref>

== Motorsport ==
=== Drag racing ===

The Beetle has been modified for use in [[drag racing]];<ref>[http://www.aftenposten.no/webtv/Dragrace-i-folkevogn-7671021.html VW Beetle drag racing video] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083815/http://www.aftenposten.no/webtv/Dragrace-i-folkevogn-7671021.html |date=19 August 2014 }} – in Norwegian</ref> its rearward ([[RR layout]]) weight distribution keeps the weight over the rear wheels, maximizing grip off the starting line. The car's weight is reduced for a full competition drag Beetle, further improving the grip and also the power-to-weight ratio. Combined with the Beetle's RR layout, [[wheelie]]s can be achieved easily, but time "in the air" worsens 1/4-mile time. To prevent this, "wheelie bars" were added. A notable version, campaigned in the USA was the EMPI Inch Pincher.<ref>[https://www.hotrod.com/articles/hrdp-0708-volkswagen Hot Rod Magazine - Jun 14, 2007 - Retrieved 5/24/20]/</ref>

=== Formula Vee ===

The Beetle is also used as the basis for the [[Formula Vee]] [[open-wheel]] racing category: specifically, the front suspension crossmember assembly (the [[shock absorber]] mounts are sometimes removed, depending on regulations in the class), and the engine and [[transaxle]] assembly (usually the earlier swing-axle type, not the later double-jointed axle).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formulavee.us/what_is_fv.htm |title=Formula Vee Specifications |publisher=Formulavee.us |accessdate=2016-07-10}}</ref>
In original 1,200&nbsp;cc Formula Vee spec, upgrades to the cars would only be allowed sparsely, so that the wheels, tires and engines didn't differ very much from the original Beetle. At the end of the 1960s, Vee Beetle engine output on a single carburetor would reach up to 70 BHP; top speeds would gradually rise to nearly {{Convert|200|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. In this configuration, FV would become one of the most popular entry-level motorsports classes of its time.

Later on, double carbs and more extensive modification would be allowed, leading to the more powerful Super Vee class featuring wings for downforce and {{Convert|123|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} engines, which in the end had fairly little in common with the original VW Beetle. Around 2000, worldwide Vee racing had re-established itself as a 1,200/1,300&nbsp;cc beginner class with wingless cars and VW engines outputting about {{Convert|60|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, but incorporating more modern chassis and tyres.

=== Uniroyal Fun Cup ===

Volkswagen Beetle-style bodies are fitted to space frame racing chassis, and are used in the [[Uniroyal Fun Cup]], which includes the longest continuous motor-race in the world, the 25 Hours of Spa. It is an affordable entry-level series that gentleman drivers race.

=== Rally and Rallycross ===
Especially the Austrian sole distributor Porsche Salzburg (now Porsche Austria) seriously entered the Volkswagen in local and European contests in the 1960s and early 1970s. Starting with the VW 1500, in the mid-1960s the peak of their racing performance was achieved with the VW 1302S and VW 1303S (known as the Salzburg Rally Beetle) from 1971 to 1973. The vehicles were entered in such famous races as TAP (Portugal), Austrian Alpine, Elba, Acropolis etc. Drivers were top performers such as [[Tony Fall]] (GB), Guenter Janger (AUT), [[Harry Källström]] (S), [[Achim Warmbold]] (D), Franz Wurz (A), etc. The engines were highly modified 1600s delivering {{convert|125|hp|abbr=on}}, later on mated to a Porsche 914 five-speed manual gearbox. Victories were achieved in 1973 on Elba for overall and class, Acropolis for class (5th overall), Austrian championship 1972, 1973 January Rallye for overall and class. Rally of 1000 minutes for overall 2nd (1st in class).

The fuel crisis, along with the arrival of the [[Volkswagen Golf]] (Rabbit), put an end to the days of unofficially supported rallying in 1974. All vehicles either used for training or actual racing were sold off to privateers, many kept racing with noticeable results until the early 1980s.

=== Trans-Am Series ===

Beetles were used in the [[Trans-Am Series]] for the two-litre class from 1966 to 1967 and again in 1972.

===Armstrong 500===
A Volkswagen won its class in the [[Armstrong 500]] in [[Australia]] in both [[1962 Armstrong 500|1962]] and [[1963 Armstrong 500|1963]].

=== Baja 1000 ===
[[File:Baja Bug.jpg|thumb|[[Baja Bug]]-style modified Beetle]]
The [[Baja 1000]] [[off-road racing|off-road race]] in the [[Baja California Peninsula]], Mexico includes specific vehicle classes for both standard Beetles and [[Baja Bug]]s. These can be seen in the documentary movie ''[[Dust to Glory]]''.

The classes are:
*[[SCORE Class 5|Class 5]]: Unlimited Baja Bugs
*[[SCORE Class 5-1600|Class 5-1600]]: 1,600 cc Baja Bugs
*[[SCORE Class 11|Class 11]]: Stock VW sedans

=== Beetle Challenge ===

The Beetle Challenge is a UK-based circuit racing championship for classic air-cooled Volkswagen Beetles. The general concept is to take any Beetle, of any age or model from the 40s through to 1303s, and with minimal restrictions, allowing parts from various years to be interchanged, and of course the cars being prepared to the MSA safety requirements (cage, restraints, fire system etc.) Essentially the cars must be air-cooled Beetles (any age and parts can be swapped between years and models), with a 15-inch x 6-inch max wheel size with a control tyre. Engines must be based on a Type 1 case, with no electronic fuel injection or ignition and no forced induction, with an unlimited capacity. Other regulations apply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beetlechallenge.com |title=Beetle Challenge |publisher=Beetle Challenge |accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref>

== Retrofit program ==
Volkswagen has joined up with eClassics to allow beetle owners to convert their car to electric. The battery will have a total capacity of 36.8 kWh, which should be good for a range of about {{convert|200|km}}. It reaches a top speed of {{convert|150|km/h}} and charging for an hour allows to store enough energy for a journey of over {{convert|150|km}}.<ref>[https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/premiere-new-energy-for-the-beetle-5312 Premiere: New energy for the Beetle]</ref><ref>[https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851784/vw-beetle-electric-conversion-frankfurt-motor-show VW beetle electric conversion]</ref>
