'''The Charles Schwab Corporation'''<ref>{{cite web|title=2020 Proxy Statement|url=https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/Charles_Schwab_2020_Proxy.pdf|publisher=The Charles Schwab Corporation|date=May 26, 2020|accessdate=June 27, 2020}}</ref> is an American multinational [[Financial institution|financial services company]] founded and based in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]. Headquartered in the SOMA District, San Francisco, Charles Schwab is the [[List of largest banks in the United States|14th largest banking institution]] in the United States with over [[United States dollar|US$]]3.3 trillion in client assets (as of 2019). It is the [[List of asset management firms|third largest asset manager]] in the world, behind [[BlackRock]] and [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard]]. The firm is known for its [[Electronic trading platform|electronic trading platforms]], investor education, and [[Broker|discount brokerage]] services, particularly reduced and free [[Stock trader|trading commission]] charges.   

Founded as '''Charles Schwab & Co.''' in 1971 by its namesake [[Charles R. Schwab|Charles Schwab]], the broker-dealer capitalized on the financial [[Deregulation#United States|deregulation of the 1970s]] to pioneer [[Discounts and allowances|discount sales]] of equity securities. After a flagship opening in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], the bank expanded into [[Seattle]] before the [[Economy of the United States#History|1980s economic expansion]] financed the bank's investments in technology, automation, and digital record keeping. The first to offer round-clock order entry and quotation, it was purchased by [[Bank of America]] in 1983 for $55 million. Three years later, the profitability of the bank's no-charge [[mutual fund]]s prompted the founder to buy his company back for $280 million. In line with the [[Digital Revolution]], Charles Schwab offered online trading in 1994 which allowed them to drop and even eliminate account fees by 2005, and introduce commission-free funds by 2011.

Charles Schwab offers commercial banking, stock brokerage, and [[Wealth management|wealth management advisory]] services to both retail and institutional clients. Despite their online presence, the company also has a large network of physical branches mostly in metropolitan [[Financial centre|financial centers]]. Their total national footprint includes 345 branches, primarily in the United States and Britain. It is known for its corporate marketing programs, especially their [[Electric blue (color)|electric blue]] nameplate, television commercials, and slogans. In 2020, the bank announced their intention to move to [[Westlake, Texas]] in conjunction with their large-scale mergers with and acquisitions of [[TD Ameritrade]] (for $26 billion) and the brokerage and investment businesses of [[USAA]] (for $1.8 billion). <ref>[https://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-releases/press-release/2019/The-Charles-Schwab-Corporation-to-Acquire-TD-Ameritrade Schwab press release]</ref>

==History==
[[File:Charles_Schwab_on_Nassau_Street.jpg|thumb|A Charles Schwab location in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].]]
In 1963, [[Charles R. Schwab]] and two other partners launched ''Investment Indicator'', an investment newsletter.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2013/04/11/schwab-icon-of-the-small-investor/2070573/ | title=Icons: Schwab still roots for the small investor | first=John | last=Waggoner | newspaper=[[USA Today]] | date=April 11, 2013 }}</ref> At its height, the newsletter had 3,000 subscribers, each paying $84 a year to subscribe. In April 1971, the firm was incorporated in California as First Commander Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Commander Industries, Inc., for traditional brokerage services and to publish the Schwab investment newsletter. In November of that year, Schwab and four others purchased all the stock from Commander Industries, Inc., and in 1972, Schwab bought all the stock from what was once Commander Industries. In 1973, the company name changed to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Og1VaPhkwwC | title=Charles Schwab: How One Company Beat Wall Street and Reinvented the Brokerage Industry | first=John | last=Kador | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | year= 2002| isbn=978-0471434313|page= }}{{page?|date=May 2020}}</ref>

In 1975, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] allowed for negotiated commission rates and Schwab set up a [[stockbroker]]age. In September 1975, Schwab opened its first branch in Sacramento, CA, and started offering discount brokerage services. In 1977, Schwab began offering seminars to clients, and by 1978, Schwab had 45,000 client accounts total, doubling to 84,000 in 1979. In 1979, Schwab risked $500,000 on a back-office settlement system called BETA (which was short for Brokerage Execution and Transaction Analysis), enabling Schwab to become the first discount broker to bring automation inhouse. In 1980, Schwab established the industry's first 24-hour quotation service, and the total of client accounts grew to 147,000. In 1981, Schwab became a member of the [[NYSE]], and the total of client accounts grew to 222,000. In 1982, Schwab became the first to offer 24/7 order entry and quote service, its first international office was opened in Hong Kong, and the number of client accounts totaled 374,000.

In 1983, [[Stephen McLin]] purchased the company for [[Bank of America]] for $55 million. In 1984, the company launched 140 no-load [[mutual fund]]s. In 1987, management, including Charles R. Schwab, bought the company from Bank of America for $280 million.<ref name=selling>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/03/business/bank-america-is-selling-schwab-unit-to-founder.html |title = Bank America Is Selling Schwab Unit to Founder |first=Lawrence M. | last=Fisher |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 3, 1987 |url-access=subscription }}</ref> In 1991, the company acquired Mayer & Schweitzer, a market making firm, allowing Schwab to execute its customers' orders without sending them to an exchange.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/06/business/company-news-charles-schwab-in-an-acquisition.html | title =Company News; Charles Schwab In an Acquisition |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 6, 1991 }}</ref> In 1997, it was fined $200,000 for failing to arrange the best trades for its customers.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/22/business/schwab-unit-agrees-to-pay-200000-fine.html |title=Schwab Unit Agrees to Pay $200,000 Fine | agency=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date=October 22, 1997 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> The unit was renamed Schwab Capital Markets in 2000.<ref>{{cite press release |url = https://www.td.com/document/PDF/investor/2001/2001-01-31-TDW%20Aitken%20Campbell%20JV%20with%20Schwab.pdf |title = Schwab and TD Waterhouse Join Forces to Build New UK Market Making Firm | publisher=[[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] | date=January 31, 2001 }}</ref> In 1993, the company opened an office in [[London]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Pottruck, who had spent the majority of his 20 years at the brokerage as Charles R. Schwab's right-hand man, shared the CEO title with the company's founder from 1998 to 2003. In May 2003, Mr. Schwab stepped down, and gave Pottruck sole control as CEO. On July 24, 2004, the company's board fired Pottruck, replacing him with its founder and namesake. News of Pottruck's removal came as the firm had announced that overall profit had dropped 10%, to $113 million, for the second quarter, driven largely by a 26% decline in revenue from customer stock trading.

After coming back into control, Mr. Schwab conceded that the company had "lost touch with our heritage", and quickly refocused the business on providing financial advice to individual investors. He also rolled back Pottruck's fee hikes. The company rebounded, and earnings began to turn around in 2005, as did the stock. The share price was up as high as 151% since Pottruck's removal, ten times since the return of Charles Schwab.<ref name="down">{{cite news| title=Charles Schwab steps down as CEO of his brokerage | url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2008/07/charles-r-schwa.html| work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=July 22, 2008}}</ref> The company's net transfer assets, or assets that come from other firms, quadrupled from 2004 to 2008.

==Schwab Charitable Fund==
The '''Schwab Charitable Fund''' is a [[donor advised fund]] which preserves the anonymity of donors by not disclosing individual donor names. Professionally managed accounts are only available through independent investment advisors working with Schwab Advisor Services, a business segment of The Charles Schwab Corporation. It accepts contributions of real estate, private equity or other non-cash assets via a charitable intermediary, with proceeds of the donation transferred to a donor-advised account upon liquidation. This intermediary considers donations on a case-by-case basis, with a typical requirement that assets be valued at $250,000 or more.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170710005264/en/Schwab-Charitable-Facilitates-1.5-Billion-Grants-Fiscal | title=Schwab Charitable Facilitates More Than $1.5 Billion in Grants in Fiscal Year 2017 | publisher=Charles Schwab Corp | via=[[Business Wire]] | date=July 10, 2017}}</ref>
