In particular, Melithafa advocates for the inclusion of diverse voices in climate activism:  <blockquote>"It’s very important for poor people and people of colour to go to these protests and marches because they are feeling the wrath of climate change the most. It’s important for them to have a say, for their voice and their demands to be heard." --- Ayakha Melithafa<ref name=":1" /></blockquote>
