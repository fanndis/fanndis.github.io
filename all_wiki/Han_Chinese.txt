Prior to the Han dynasty, ancient Chinese scholars used the term [[Huaxia]] ({{zh|s=华夏|t=華夏|c=|p=Huá Xià|first=st|labels=no}}, "the magnificent [[Xia dynasty|Xia]]") in texts to describe [[China proper]], while the Chinese populus were referred to as either the "various Hua" ({{zh|s=诸华|t=諸華|c=|p=|labels=no|first=st}}) or the "various Xia" ({{zh|s=诸夏|t=諸夏|c=|p=|labels=no|first=st}}). This gave rise to a term commonly used nowadays by [[overseas Chinese]] as an ethnic identity for the Chinese diaspora – ''Huaren'' ({{zh|s={{linktext|华人}}|t={{linktext|華人}}|c=|p=Huá Rén|first=st|links=no|labels=no}}, "the Chinese people"), ''Huaqiao'' ({{zh|s=华侨|t=華僑|c=|p=Huáqiáo|first=st|labels=no}}, "the Chinese immigrant" meaning [[overseas Chinese]])<ref name="hack" /> as well as a [[Names of China|literary name for China]] – ''Zhonghua'' ({{zh|s={{linktext|中华}}|t={{linktext|中華}}|c=|p=Zhōnghuá|first=st|links=no|labels=no}}, "the Central Chinese").<ref name=":0" /> ''Zhonghua'' refers more to the culture of Chinese people, although it may also be seen as equivalent to ''[[Zhonghua minzu]]''.<ref name="chang" /> The overseas Chinese use ''Huaren'' or ''Huaqiao'' instead of ''Zhongguoren'' ({{zh|s=中国人|t=中國人|c=|p=|first=st|links=no|labels=no}}), which commonly refers to citizens of the People's Republic of China.<ref name="sheng" />

Among some southern Han Chinese varieties such as [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Southern Min|Minnan]], a different term exists – Tang Chinese ({{zh|t=唐人|p=Táng Rén}}, literally "the people of Tang"), derived from the later [[Tang dynasty]], regarded as another zenith of Chinese civilization.  The term is used in everyday conversation and is also an element in one of the words for [[Chinatown]]: "street of the Tang people" ({{zh|c={{linktext|唐人街}}|p=Táng Rén Jiē|j=tong4 jan4 gaai1}}).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Leung |first1=Genevieve Y. |last2=Wu |first2=Min-Hsuan |title=Linguistic landscape and heritage language literacy education |journal=Written Language & Literacy |date=2012 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=114–140 |doi=10.1075/wll.15.1.06leu}}</ref> The phrase {{transl|zh|Huá Bù}}, {{zh|s=华埠|t=華埠|c=|p=|first=st|labels=no}} is also used to describe the same area).

In Taiwan, Han Chinese (including both the earlier Han Taiwanese settlers and the recent Mainland Chinese that arrived in Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek in 1949) constitute over 95% of the population.

== History ==
{{Main|History of China}}

Because of the overwhelming numerical and cultural dominance of Han culture in China, most of the written [[history of China]] can be read as "a history of the Han Chinese".<ref>{{cite book|first=John A.G|last=Roberts|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2001|title=A History of China|page=5}}</ref><ref name="auto"/>

=== Prehistory ===
{{Main|Huaxia|Yanhuang}}

The prehistory of the Han Chinese is closely intertwined with both archaeology, biology, historical textual records and mythology.  The ethnic stock to which the Han Chinese originally trace their ancestry from were confederations of late [[Neolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]] agricultural tribes known as the [[Huaxia]] that lived along the [[Guanzhong]] and [[Yellow River]] basins in Northern China.<ref name="auto10">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20083309 |title=A Point Of View: How China sees a multicultural world |last=Jacques  |first=Martin  |date=October 26, 2012 |website=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Ethnic Groups of North, East, and Central Asia: An Encyclopedia |last=Minahan |first=James |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-61069-017-1 |publication-date=February 10, 2014 |page=90}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Interpreters in Early Imperial China |last= Lung |first=Rachel |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2011 |isbn=978-90-272-2444-6 |page=5}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to Chinese History and Culture |last=Zhang |first=Qizhi |publisher=Springer |year=2016 |isbn=978-3-662-51507-5 |page=26}}</ref><ref name="auto4"/><ref name="Guo 2016 66–67">{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to the Chinese Economy: The Driving Forces Behind Modern Day China  |last= Guo  |first=  Rongxing   |publisher= Wiley |year= 2016 |isbn=978-3-319-32305-3   |pages=66–67}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0022002795039003004 |title=War and Politics in Ancient China, 2700 B.C.

The Yellow Emperor is traditionally credited to have united with the neighbouring [[Shennong]] tribes after defeating their leader, the [[Yan Emperor]], at the [[Battle of Banquan]]. The newly merged [[Yanhuang]] tribes then combined forces to defeat their common enemy from the east, [[Chiyou]] of the Jiuli ({{lang|zh|九黎}}) tribes, at the [[Battle of Zhuolu]], and established their cultural dominance in the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] region.  To this day, modern Han Chinese refer themselves as "[[Yan Huang Zisun|Descendants of Yan and Huang]]".

Although study of this period of history is complicated by the absence of contemporary records, the discovery of [[archaeological site]]s has enabled a succession of [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|Neolithic cultures]] to be identified along the Yellow River. Along the central reaches of the Yellow River were the [[Jiahu]] culture (c. 7000 to 6600 BCE), the [[Yangshao culture]] (c. 5000 to 3000 BCE) and the [[Longshan culture]] (c. 3000 to 2000 BCE). Along the lower reaches of the river were the Qingliangang culture (c. 5400 to 4000 BCE), the [[Dawenkou culture]] (c. 4300 to 2500 BCE), and the [[Yueshi culture]] (c. 1900 to 1500 BCE).

=== Early history ===
{{Main|Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors}}
Early ancient Chinese history is largely legendary, consisting of mythical tales intertwined with sporadic annals written centuries to millennia later. Sima Qian's ''Records of the Grand Historian''  recorded a period following the Battle of Zhuolu, during the reign of successive generations of confederate overlords ({{zh|t=共主}}) known as the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]] (c. 2852–2070 BCE), who, allegedly, were elected to power among the tribes.  This is a period for which scant reliable archaeological evidence exists – these sovereigns are largely regarded as [[cultural hero]]es.

==== Xia dynasty ====
{{Main|Xia dynasty}}
The first dynasty to be described in Chinese historical records is the Xia dynasty (c. 2070–1600 BCE), established by [[Yu the Great]] after [[Emperor Shun]] abdicated leadership to reward Yu's work in taming the [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]].  Yu's son, [[Qi of Xia|Qi]], managed to not only install himself as the next ruler, but also dictated his sons as heirs by default, making the Xia dynasty the first in recorded history where [[order of succession|genealogical succession]] was the norm.  The civilizational prosperity of the Xia dynasty at this time is thought to have given rise to the name "Huaxia" ({{zh|s=华夏|t=華夏|p=Huá Xià}}, "the magnificent Xia"), a term that was used ubiquitously throughout history to define the Chinese nation.<ref>{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to the Chinese Economy: The Driving Forces Behind Modern Day China  |last= Guo  |first=  Rongxing   |publisher= Wiley |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0-470-82604-1 |page=10}}</ref>

Conclusive archaeological evidence predating the 16th century BCE is, however, rarely available.  Recent efforts of the [[Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project]] drew the connection between the [[Erlitou culture]] and the Xia dynasty, but scholars could not reach a consensus regarding the reliability of such history.

==== Shang dynasty ====
{{Main|Shang dynasty}}
The Xia dynasty was overthrown after the [[Battle of Mingtiao]], around 1600 BCE, by [[Cheng Tang]], who established the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE).  The earliest archaeological examples of Chinese writing date back to this period – from characters inscribed on [[oracle bone]]s used for divination – but the well-developed characters hint at a much earlier origin of writing in China.

During the Shang dynasty, people of the [[Wu (region)|Wu area]] in the [[Yangtze River Delta]] were considered a different tribe, and described as being scantily dressed, tattooed and speaking a distinct language. Later, [[Taibo of Wu|Taibo]], elder uncle of [[King Wen of Zhou|Ji Chang]] – on realising that his younger brother, Jili, was wiser and deserved to inherit the throne – fled to Wu<ref name="chinaknowledge.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/rulers-wu.html|title=The Feudal State of Wu 吳 (www.chinaknowledge.de)|first=Ulrich|last=Theobald|website=Chinaknowledge.de|access-date=12 December 2017}}</ref> and settled there. Three generations later, [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]] of the Zhou dynasty defeated [[King Zhou of Shang|King Zhou]] (the last Shang king), and [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] the descendants of Taibo in Wu<ref name="chinaknowledge.de"/> – mirroring the later history of [[Nanyue]], where a Chinese king and his soldiers ruled a non-Han population and mixed with locals, who were [[sinicization|sinicized]] over time.

==== Zhou dynasty ====
{{Main|Zhou dynasty}}
After the [[Battle of Muye]], the Shang dynasty was overthrown by [[Predynastic Zhou|Zhou]] (led by [[Ji Fa]]), which had emerged as a western state along the [[Wei River]] in the 2nd millennium BCE.  The [[Zhou dynasty]] shared the language and culture of the Shang people, and extended their reach to encompass much of the area north of the [[Yangtze River]].<ref>{{cite web|title= China The Zhou Period|url= http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_chinathezhouperiod.htm|website=Ancienthistory.about.com|access-date=12 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="China The Zhou Period">{{cite web|title= China The Zhou Period|url= http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cn0015)|website=Lcweb2.loc.gov|access-date=12 December 2017}}</ref>  Through conquest and colonization, much of this area came under the influence of sinicization, and this culture extended south.<ref name="China The Zhou Period"/>  However, the power of the Zhou kings fragmented not long afterwards, and many autonomous vassal states emerged.  This dynasty is traditionally divided into two eras – the Western Zhou (1046–771 BCE) and the [[Eastern Zhou]] (770–256 BCE) – with the latter further divided into the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] (770–476 BCE) and the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] (476–221 BCE) periods.  It was a period of significant cultural and philosophical diversification (known as the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]) and [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] are among the most important surviving philosophies from this era.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

=== Imperial history ===

==== Qin dynasty ====
{{Main|Qin dynasty}}
The chaotic Warring States period of the Eastern Zhou dynasty came to an end with the unification of China by the western state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] after its [[Qin's wars of unification|conquest of all other rival states]]{{when|date=February 2015}} under King [[Ying Zheng]].  King Zheng then gave himself a new title "[[First Emperor of Qin]]" ({{zh|c=秦始皇帝|p=Qín Shǐ Huángdì}}), setting the precedent for the next two millennia.  To consolidate administrative control over the newly conquered parts of the country, the First Emperor decreed a nationwide standardization of currency, writing scripts, and measurement units, to unify the country economically and culturally.  He also ordered large-scale infrastructure projects such as the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], the [[Lingqu Canal]] and the Qin road system to militarily fortify the frontiers.  In effect, he established a centralized bureaucratic state to replace the old feudal confederation system of preceding dynasties, making Qin the first [[Qin dynasty|imperial dynasty]] in Chinese history.

This dynasty, sometimes phonetically spelt as the "Ch'in dynasty", has been proposed in the 17th century by [[Martin Martini]] and supported by later scholars such as [[Paul Pelliot]] and [[Berthold Laufer]] to be the etymological origin of the modern English word "China".

==== Han dynasty ====
{{Main|Han dynasty}}
[[File:China.Terracotta statues007.jpg|thumb|upright|A female servant and male advisor dressed in [[Han Chinese clothing|silk robes]], ceramic figurines from the Western Han era]]

The reign of the first imperial dynasty was to be short-lived. Due to the First Emperor's autocratic rule and his massive labor projects, which fomented rebellion among the populace, the Qin dynasty fell into chaos soon after his death. Under the corrupt rule of his son and successor [[Huhai]], the Qin dynasty collapsed a mere three years later. The Han dynasty (206 BC–220 CE) then emerged from the ensuing [[Chu-Han contention|civil wars]] and succeeded in establishing a much longer-lasting dynasty.  It continued many of the institutions created by the Qin dynasty, but adopted a more moderate rule. Under the Han dynasty, arts and culture flourished, while the Han Empire [[History of the Han dynasty|expanded militarily in all directions]]. Many Chinese scholars such as [[Ho Ping-ti]] believe that the concept ([[ethnogenesis]]) of Han ethnicity, though an ancient one, was formally entrenched in the Han dynasty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claytonbrown.org|title=Clayton D. Brown Research on Chinese History: Ethnology, Archaeology, and Han Identity|website=Claytonbrown.org|access-date=12 December 2017}}</ref> The Han dynasty is considered one of the [[golden age]]s of Chinese history, and to this day, the modern Han Chinese people have since taken their ethnic name from this dynasty and the Chinese script is referred to as "[[Chinese characters|Han characters]]".{{sfnp|Schaefer|2008|p=279}}

==== Three Kingdoms to Tang ====
{{Main|Three Kingdoms|Sixteen Kingdoms|Southern and Northern Dynasties|Sui dynasty|Tang dynasty}}
[[File:China, 742.svg|320px|thumb|Map of Tang China in 742, showing the [[Administrative divisions of the Tang dynasty|major provinces]] of the empire|alt=]]The fall of the Han dynasty was followed by an age of fragmentation and several centuries of disunity amid warfare among rival kingdoms. During this time, areas of northern China were overrun by [[Five Barbarians|various non-Han nomadic peoples]], which came to establish kingdoms of their own, the most successful of which was [[Northern Wei]] (established by the [[Xianbei]]). Starting from this period, the native population of China proper began to be referred to as Hanren, or the "People of Han", to distinguish them from the nomads from the steppe. Warfare and invasion led to one of the first great migrations of Han populations in history, as they fled south to the [[Yangtze|Yangzi]] and beyond, shifting the Chinese demographic center and speeding up sinicization of the far south. At the same time most of the nomads in northern China came to be sinicized as they ruled over large Chinese populations and adopted elements of their culture and administration. Of note, the Xianbei rulers of Northern Wei ordered a policy of systematic sinicization, [[Change of Xianbei names to Han names|adopting Han surnames]], institutions, and culture.

The Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) dynasties saw the continuation of the complete sinicization of the south coast of what is now China proper, including what are now the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]]. The later part of the Tang era, as well as the Five Dynasties period that followed, saw continual warfare in north and central China; the relative stability of the south coast made it an attractive destination for refugees.

The next few centuries saw successive invasions of Han and non-Han peoples from the north. In 1279, the [[Mongols]] conquered all of China, becoming the first non-Han ethnic group to do so, and established the [[Yuan dynasty]]. The Mongols divided society into four classes, with themselves occupying the top class and Han Chinese into the bottom two classes. [[Emigration]], seen as disloyal to ancestors and ancestral land, was banned by the Song and Yuan dynasties.<ref>{{Cite book|first1 = Pál|last1 = Nyíri|first2 =  Igorʹ|last2 = Rostislavovich Savelʹev|title = Globalizing Chinese migration: trends in Europe and Asia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=77F23y4RrnUC&pg=PA208|publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year = 2002|page = 208|isbn = 978-0-7546-1793-8}}

In 1644, the Ming capital, [[Beijing]], was captured by [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasant rebels and the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide. The [[Manchu people|Manchus]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] then allied with former Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] and seized control of Beijing. Remnant Ming forces led by [[Koxinga]] fled to [[Taiwan]] and established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], which eventually capitulated to Qing forces in 1683. Taiwan, previously inhabited mostly by non-Han aborigines, was sinicized during this period via large-scale migration accompanied by assimilation, despite efforts by the Manchus to prevent this, as they found it difficult to maintain control over the island. In 1681, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] ordered construction of the [[Willow Palisade]] to prevent Han Chinese migration to the three northeastern provinces, which nevertheless had harbored a significant Chinese population for centuries, especially in the southern [[Liaodong]] area. The Manchus designated Jilin and Heilongjiang as the Manchu homeland, to which the Manchus could hypothetically escape and regroup if the Qing dynasty fell.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Mark C. |last1=Elliott |date=August 2000 |title=The Limits of Tartary: Manchuria in Imperial and National Geographies |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=603–46 |jstor=2658945 |doi=10.2307/2658945|s2cid=162684575 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e8f4099cf98dc5bebc32205a4b8ed91689dfc70b }}</ref> Because of increasing Russian territorial encroachment and annexation of neighboring territory, the Qing later reversed its policy and allowed the consolidation of a demographic Han majority in northeast China.

== Culture and society==
{{Main|Chinese culture}}

China is one of the world's oldest and most complex [[civilization]]s, whose culture dates back thousands of years. Overseas Han Chinese maintain cultural affinities to Chinese territories outside of their host locale through [[ancestor worship]] and [[Chinese clan|clan]] associations, which often identify famous figures from Chinese history or myth as ancestors of current members.<ref name="Cohen"/> Such patriarchs include the Yellow Emperor and the [[Yan Emperor]], who according to legend lived thousands of years ago and gave Han people the sobriquet "''[[Descendants of Yan and Huang Emperor]]''" ({{lang|zh-hant|炎黃子孫}}; {{lang|zh-hans|炎黄子孙}}), a phrase which has reverberative connotations in a divisive political climate, as in that of between [[Cross-Strait relations|Mainland China and Taiwan]]. [[File:Along the River During the Qingming Festival (detail of original).jpg|thumb|[[Zhang Zeduan]]'s painting ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' captures the daily life of people from the Song dynasty at the capital, Bianjing, today's [[Kaifeng]].]]

[[Chinese art]], [[Chinese architecture]], [[Chinese cuisine]], [[Chinese fashion]], [[Chinese festivals]], [[Chinese language]], [[Chinese literature]], [[Chinese mythology]], and [[Chinese philosophy]] all have undergone thousands of years of development, while numerous Chinese sites, such as the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] and the [[Terracotta Army]], are [[World Heritage Site]]s. Since the start of the program in 2001, aspects of Chinese culture have been listed by [[UNESCO]] as [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]. Throughout the [[history of China]], Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by [[Confucianism]]. Credited with shaping much of Chinese thought, [[Confucianism]] was the official [[philosophy]] throughout most of [[Imperial Chinese|Imperial China]]'s history, institutionalizing values like [[filial piety]], which implied the performance of certain [[Li (Confucian)|shared rituals]]. Thus, villagers lavished on [[Chinese funeral rituals|funeral]] and [[Chinese wedding|wedding]] ceremonies that imitated the Confucian standards of the Emperors.<ref name="Cohen"/> Mastery of Confucian texts provided the primary criterion for [[Imperial examination|entry into the imperial bureaucracy]], but even those degree-holders who did not enter the bureaucracy or who left it held increased social influence in their home areas, contributing to the homogenizing of Han Chinese culture. Other factors contributing to the development of a shared Han culture included [[urbanization]] and geographically vast but integrated commodity markets.<ref name="Cohen"/>

=== Language ===
{{Main|Chinese language}}
{{see also|Standard Chinese}}

Han Chinese speak various forms of the Chinese language that are descended from a common early language;<ref name="Cohen"/> one of the names of the language groups is ''Hanyu'' ({{zh|t={{linktext|漢語}} |s={{linktext|汉语}} |links=no}}), literally the "Han language". Similarly, [[Chinese characters]], used to write the language, are called ''Hanzi'' ({{zh|t={{linktext|漢字}} |s={{linktext|汉字}} |links=no}}), or "Han characters".

In the late imperial period, more than two-thirds of the Han Chinese population used a variant of [[Mandarin Chinese]] as their native tongue.<ref name="Cohen">{{cite book|title=Kinship, Contract, Community, And State: Anthropological Perspectives on China|first=Myron L|last=Cohen|chapter=Late Imperial China and Its Legacies|pages=41–45, 50}}</ref> However, there was a larger variety of languages in certain areas of southeast China, like [[Shanghai]], [[Guangzhou]], and [[Guangxi]].<ref name="Cohen"/> Since the Qin dynasty, which standardized the various forms of writing that existed in China, a standard [[Classical Chinese|literary Chinese]] had emerged with vocabulary and grammar that was significantly different from the various [[varieties of Chinese|forms of spoken Chinese]]. A simplified and elaborated version of this written standard was used in business contracts, notes for [[Chinese opera]], ritual texts for [[Chinese folk religion]], and other daily documents for educated people.<ref name="Cohen" />

During the early 20th century, [[written vernacular Chinese]] based on Mandarin dialects, which had been developing for several centuries, was standardized and adopted to replace literary Chinese. While written vernacular forms of other varieties of Chinese exist, such as [[written Cantonese]], written Chinese based on Mandarin is widely understood by speakers of all varieties and has taken up the dominant position among written forms, formerly occupied by literary Chinese. Thus, although residents of different regions would not necessarily understand each other's speech, they generally share a common written language, Standard Written Chinese and Literary Chinese (these two writing styles can merge into a 半白半文 writing style).

From the 1950s, [[Simplified Chinese characters]] were adopted in mainland China and later in Singapore and Malaysia, while Chinese communities in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and overseas countries continue to use [[Traditional Chinese characters]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Although significant differences exist between the two character sets, they are largely [[mutually intelligible]].

=== Family ===
[[Chinese kinship|Han Chinese families]] throughout China have had certain traditionally prescribed roles, such as the family head ({{lang|zh-Hant|家長}}, ''jiāzhǎng''), who represents the family to the outside world, and the family manager ({{lang|zh-Hant|當家}}, ''dāngjiā''), who is in charge of the revenues. Because farmland was commonly bought, sold, or [[mortgage]]d, families were run like enterprises, with set rules for the allocation ({{lang|zh|分家}}, ''fēnjiā'') of pooled earnings and assets.<ref name="Cohen"/>

Han Chinese houses differ from place to place. In Beijing, the whole family traditionally lived together in a large rectangle-shaped house called a ''[[siheyuan]]''. Such houses had four rooms at the front – guest room, [[kitchen]], [[Toilet (room)|lavatory]], and [[servants' quarters]]. Across large double doors was a wing for the elderly in the family. This wing consisted of three rooms: a central room where the four tablets – heaven, earth, ancestor, and teacher – were worshipped, and two rooms attached to the left and right, which were [[bedrooms]] for the grandparents. The east wing of the house was inhabited by the eldest son and his family, while the west wing sheltered the second son and his family. Each wing had a [[veranda]]; some had a "sunroom" made with surrounding fabric and supported by a wooden or [[bamboo]] frame. Every wing was also built around a central courtyard that was used for study, exercise, or nature viewing.<ref>{{cite conference |author = Montgomery County Public Schools Foreign Language Department |title = Si-he-yuan |pages = 1–8 |publisher = Montgomery County Public Schools |date = August 2006 |url = http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/ }}</ref>

=== Food ===
{{Main|Chinese cuisine}}

There is no specific one uniform cuisine of the Han people since the food eaten varies from [[Sichuan]]'s famously [[Szechuan cuisine|spicy food]] to Guangdong's [[dim sum]] and fresh seafood. Analyses have revealed their main staple to be rice and noodles (different kinds of wheat foods). During China's Neolithic period, southwestern rice growers transitioned to millet from the northwest, when they could not find a suitable northwestern ecology – which was typically dry and cold – to sustain the generous yields of their staple as well as it did in other areas, such as along the eastern Chinese coast.<ref>{{cite journal|title= The expansion of Setaria farmers in East Asia: A linguistic and archaeological model|journal= Past Human Migrations in East Asia: Matching …|url= https://www.academia.edu/3077307|page=137|last1= Sagart|first1= Laurent}}</ref>

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
[[File:Vinegar tasters.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A traditional representation of ''[[The Vinegar Tasters]]'', an allegorical image representing Buddhists, Confucianists, and Taoists]]

Chinese culture has been long characterized by [[religious pluralism]] and Chinese folk religion has always maintained a profound influence. Indigenous Confucianism and Taoism share aspects of being a philosophy or a religion, and neither demand exclusive adherence, resulting in a culture of tolerance and [[syncretism]], where multiple religions or belief systems are often practiced in concert with local customs and traditions. Han Chinese culture has for long been influenced by [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, while in recent centuries Christianity has also gained a foothold among the population.{{Citation needed|date = November 2018}}

Chinese folk religion is a set of worship traditions of the ethnic deities of the Han people. It involves the worship of various figures in [[Chinese mythology]], folk heroes such as [[Guan Yu]] and [[Qu Yuan]], mythological creatures such as the [[Chinese dragon]], or family, clan and national ancestors. These practices vary from region to region, and do not characterize an organized religion, though many [[traditional Chinese holidays]] such as the [[Duanwu Festival|Duanwu (or Dragon Boat) Festival]], [[Qingming Festival|Qingming]], and the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] come from the most popular of these traditions.

Taoism, another indigenous religion, is also widely practiced in both its folk forms and as an organized religion, and has influenced Chinese art, poetry, philosophy, [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicine]], [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], alchemy and chemistry, cuisine, [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]], and [[Chinese architecture|architecture]]. Taoism was the state religion of the early Han Dynasty, and also often enjoyed state patronage under subsequent emperors and dynasties.

Confucianism, although sometimes described as a religion, is a governing philosophy and moral code with some religious elements like ancestor worship. It is deeply ingrained in Chinese culture and was the official state philosophy in China during the Han Dynasty and unto the fall of imperial China in the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date = November 2018}}

During the Han Dynasty, [[Confucian]] ideals were the dominant ideology.  Near the end of the dynasty, Buddhism entered China, later gaining popularity. Historically, Buddhism alternated between periods of state tolerance (and even patronage) and [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|persecution]]. In its original form, Buddhism was at odds with the native Chinese religions, especially with the elite, as certain Buddhist values often conflicted with Chinese sensibilities. However, through centuries of assimilation, adaptation, and syncretism, [[Chinese Buddhism]] gained an accepted place in the culture. Mahayana would come to be influenced by Confucianism and Taoism, and exerted influence in turn – such as in the form of [[Neo-Confucianism]].

Though [[Christianity in China|Christian influence in China]] existed as early as the 7th century, Christianity did not begin to gain a significant foothold in China until the establishment of contact with Europeans during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties. Chinese practices at odds with Christian beliefs resulted in the [[Chinese Rites controversy]], and a subsequent reduction in Christian influence. Christianity grew considerably following the [[First Opium War]], after which foreign missionaries in China enjoyed the protection of the Western powers and engaged in widespread proselytising.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

The estimated contribution of northern Han to southern Han is substantial in both paternal and maternal lineages and a geographic [[cline (biology)|cline]] exists for mtDNA. As a result, the northern Han are the primary contributors to the gene pool of the southern Han. However, it is noteworthy that the expansion process was dominated by males, as is shown by a greater contribution to the Y-chromosome than the mtDNA from northern Han to southern Han. These genetic observations are in line with historical records of continuous and large migratory waves of northern China inhabitants escaping warfare and famine, to southern China. Aside from these large migratory waves, other smaller southward migrations occurred during almost all periods in the past two millennia.<ref name="table"/>  A study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences into the gene frequency data of Han subpopulations and ethnic minorities in China, showed that Han subpopulations in different regions are also genetically quite close to the local ethnic minorities, meaning that in many cases, blood of ethnic minorities had mixed into Han, while at the same time, the blood of Han had also mixed into the local ethnic minorities.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18726285 |year=1997 |last1=Du |first1=R |last2=Xiao |first2=C |last3=Cavalli-Sforza |first3=LL |title=Genetic distances between Chinese populations calculated on gene frequencies of 38 loci |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=613–21 |doi=10.1007/BF02882691 |journal=Science China Life Sciences|s2cid=1924085 }}</ref> A study on Armenian admixture in varied populations found 3.9% Armenian-like DNA in some northern Chinese Han.<ref>{{cite web |title = World ancestry |url = http://admixturemap.paintmychromosomes.com/ |website = admixturemap.paintmychromosomes.com |access-date = 2016-02-09 }}</ref>

A recent, and to date the most extensive, genome-wide association study of the Han population, shows that geographic-genetic stratification from north to south has occurred and centrally placed populations act as the conduit for outlying ones.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.10.016 |title=Genetic Structure of the Han Chinese Population Revealed by Genome-wide SNP Variation |year=2009 |last1=Chen |first1=Jieming |last2=Zheng |first2=Houfeng |last3=Bei |first3=Jin-Xin |last4=Sun |first4=Liangdan |last5=Jia |first5=Wei-hua |last6=Li |first6=Tao |last7=Zhang |first7=Furen |last8=Seielstad |first8=Mark |last9=Zeng |first9=Yi-Xin |last10=Zhang |first10=X |last11=Liu |first11=J |display-authors=9 |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=85 |issue=6 |pages=775–85 |pmid=19944401 |pmc=2790583 }}</ref> Ultimately, with the exception in some [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] branches of the Han Chinese, such as [[Pinghua]] and [[Tanka people]],<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/0035-9203(71)90185-4 | volume=65 | title=Cooley's anaemia among the tanka of South China | year=1971 | journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | pages=59–62 | author=McFadzean A.J.S., Todd D. | pmid=5092429 | issue=1}}</ref> there is "coherent genetic structure"<!-- "coherent genetic structure" doesn't seem to have a standard, formal definition--> in all Han Chinese populace.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Pinghua population as an exception of Han Chinese's coherent genetic structure |doi=10.1007/s10038-008-0250-x |pmid=18270655 |journal=Journal of Human Genetics|volume=53|issue=4|pages=303–13 |year=2008 |last1=Gan |first1=Rui-Jing |last2=Pan |first2=Shang-Ling |last3=Mustavich |first3=Laura F. |last4=Qin |first4=Zhen-Dong |last5=Cai |first5=Xiao-Yun |last6=Qian |first6=Ji |last7=Liu |first7=Cheng-Wu |last8=Peng |first8=Jun-Hua |last9=Li |first9=Shi-Lin |last10=Xu |first10=Jie-Shun |last11=Jin |first11=Li |last12=Li |first12=Hui |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Typical Y-DNA haplogroups of present-day Han Chinese include [[Haplogroup O-M122]] and [[Haplogroup Q-M242|Haplogroup Q-M120]], and these haplogroups also have been found to predominate (alongside some members of [[Haplogroup N-M231]], [[Haplogroup O-M95]], and unresolved [[Haplogroup O-M175]]) among a selection of ancient human remains recovered from the Hengbei archeological site in Jiang County, Shanxi Province, China, an area that was part of the suburbs of the capital (near modern Luoyang) during the Zhou dynasty.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhao|first1=Yong-Bin|last2=Zhang|first2=Ye|last3=Zhang|first3=Quan-Chao|last4=Li|first4=Hong-Jie|last5=Cui|first5=Ying-Qiu|last6=Xu|first6=Zhi|last7=Jin|first7=Li|last8=Zhou|first8=Hui|last9=Zhu|first9=Hong|date=2015-05-04 |title=Ancient DNA Reveals That the Genetic Structure of the Northern Han Chinese Was Shaped Prior to 3,000 Years Ago |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=10|issue=5 |pages=e0125676 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0125676 |issn=1932-6203 |pmc=4418768 |pmid=25938511 |bibcode=2015PLoSO..1025676Z }}</ref>
