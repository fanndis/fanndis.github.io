Eliphalet Bulkeley blocked a move to liquidate the company during the economic downturn.<ref name=history/>
* The Aetna Insurance Company issued [[life insurance]] policies on an undetermined number of [[African-American]] [[slaves]], naming their owners as [[beneficiaries]].<ref name="usatoday. com">{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/general/2002/03/25/slave-reparations.htm | work=[[USA Today]] | title=Aetna, CSX, FleetBoston face slave reparations suit | date=March 24, 2002 | access-date=May 2, 2010}}</ref>
* ''1861'' - Aetna began offering participating life insurance policies which paid [[dividend]]s to policyholders just as the mutual life insurance policies did.

However, the death toll of the war coupled with the booming wartime economy caused an expansion of the life insurance business to match Aetna's expansion.<ref name=history/>
* ''1865'' - By 1864 Aetna had increased its volume of business by 600% over 1861 and its annual premium income ninefold, exceeding one million dollars.

* ''1867'' - Company income rose from $78,000 in 1861 to $5.129 million by 1867. Aetna moved to its third home office at 670 Main Street, Hartford. By 1924, Aetna had $94{{nbsp}}million, 43% of its assets, invested in farm mortgages.<ref name=history/>
* ''1868'' Aetna altered its business practices, hiring its first [[actuary]] and abandoning the half-note premium system in favor of an all-cash premium plan.

* On November 3, US Senator [[Tom Harkin]], chairman of the [[Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions]], launched an investigation into health insurance pricing, asking Aetna and three other major insurers to justify their pricing practices.

* Aetna filed a $4.9{{nbsp}}billion correction to its 2008 health insurance regulatory filings on December 7, 2009. The new filings show that Aetna spends less on small business health care than previously reported. "Health insurance companies have a duty to provide accurate financial information both to consumers and to their regulators about how much money they actually spend on health care and how much they spend on profits, on executive salaries, and on figuring out how to deny care to people when they really need it, " said Senator [[Jay Rockefeller]], Chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]]. "Unfortunately, it looks like Aetna and other health insurers haven't been taking this duty very seriously. I'm disappointed that my Committee had to launch a full-scale congressional investigation to get these companies to meet their basic reporting obligations.

== Life insurance policies on slaves ==

In 2000 Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, head of the nonprofit Restitution Study Group of Hoboken, New Jersey, disclosed that from approximately 1853 to approximately 1860 Aetna had issued life insurance policies to slaveowners covering the lives of their slaves.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/nyregion/slave-policies.html | work=The New York Times | title=Slave Policies | first=Virginia | last=Groark | date=May 5, 2002 | access-date=May 2, 2010}}</ref>

Aetna acknowledged that concrete evidence exists for Aetna issuing coverage for the lives of slaves and released a public apology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalethics.org/newsline/2000/03/13/aetna-apologizes-for-pre-civil-war-policies-issued-on-lives-of-slaves/ |title=Ethics Newsline® » News » Aetna Apologizes For Pre-Civil-War Policies Issued On Lives Of Slaves |publisher=Globalethics.org |date=2000-03-13 |access-date=2011-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017235053/http://www.globalethics.org/newsline/2000/03/13/aetna-apologizes-for-pre-civil-war-policies-issued-on-lives-of-slaves/ |archive-date=2013-10-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2002, Farmer-Paellmann brought suit against Aetna and two other companies in federal court asking for reparations for the descendants of slaves. The lawsuit said Aetna, [[CSX]] and Fleet were "unjustly enriched" by "a system that enslaved, tortured, starved and exploited human beings." It argued that [[African-American]]s are still suffering the effects of 2½ centuries of enslavement followed by more than a century of institutionalized racism. The complaint blamed slavery for present-day disparities between blacks and whites in income, education, literacy, health, life expectancy and crime.<ref name="usatoday. com"/>

This suit was dismissed, and the dismissal largely upheld on appeal.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/regulation/2004-01-26-reparations_x.htm?csp=34 | work=USA Today | title=Judge rejects lawsuit seeking reparations | first1=James | last1=Cox | date=January 26, 2004 | access-date=May 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/31/opinion/oe-olson31?pg=2 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=So long, slavery reparations | first=Walter | last=Olson | date=October 31, 2008 | access-date=May 2, 2010}}</ref>
