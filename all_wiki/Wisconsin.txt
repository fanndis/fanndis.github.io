'''Wisconsin''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Wisconsin.ogg|w|ᵻ|ˈ|s|k|ɒ|n|s|ᵻ|n}}) is a [[U.S. state]] in the north-central, [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes]] regions of the country. It is bordered by [[Minnesota]] to the west, [[Iowa]] to the southwest, [[Illinois]] to the south, [[Lake Michigan]] to the east, [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Michigan]] to the northeast, and [[Lake Superior]] to the north. Wisconsin is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|23rd-largest state by total area]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|20th-most populous]]. The state capital is [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], and its largest city is [[Milwaukee]], which is on the western shore of Lake Michigan. The state is divided into [[List of counties in Wisconsin|72 counties]].

Wisconsin's geography is diverse, having been greatly impacted by glaciers during the [[Last glacial period|Ice Age]] with the exception of the [[Driftless Area]]. The [[Northern Highland]] and [[Western Upland]] along with a part of the [[Central Plain (Wisconsin)|Central Plain]] occupies the western part of the state, with lowlands stretching to the shore of [[Lake Michigan]]. Wisconsin is third to [[Ontario]] and [[Michigan]] in the length of its Great Lakes coastline.

At the time of European contact, the area that is now Wisconsin was inhabited by [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] and [[Siouan peoples|Siouan]] nations. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, many European settlers entered the state, many of whom emigrated from Germany and Scandinavia. Like neighboring Minnesota, the state remains a center of [[German American]] and [[Scandinavian American]] culture.

The state is one of the nation's leading [[Dairy farming|dairy producers]] and is known as "America's Dairyland"; it is particularly famous for [[Wisconsin cheese|its cheese]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wisconsin.uk/ | title=wisconsin.uk | access-date=October 25, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025193722/https://wisconsin.uk/ | archive-date=October 25, 2019 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Our Fifty States}}</ref> Manufacturing (especially paper products), information technology, cranberries, ginseng,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/ginseng-continues-rebound-in-central-wisconsin/article_5dd63657-78ac-5cfe-ac88-419af3e9bf09.html|title=Ginseng continues rebound in central Wisconsin|last=Journal|first=Barry Adams {{!}} Wisconsin State|work=madison.com|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811195428/https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/ginseng-continues-rebound-in-central-wisconsin/article_5dd63657-78ac-5cfe-ac88-419af3e9bf09.html|archive-date=August 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and tourism are also major contributors to the state's economy.

==Etymology==

The word ''Wisconsin'' originates from the name given to the [[Wisconsin River]] by one of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups living in the region at the time of [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/topics/wisconsin-name/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028075712/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/topics/wisconsin-name/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 28, 2005 |title=Wisconsin's Name: Where it Came from and What it Means |access-date=July 24, 2008 |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society }}</ref> French explorer [[Jacques Marquette]] was the first [[Europe]]an to reach the [[Wisconsin River]], arriving in 1673 and calling the river ''Meskousing'' in his journal.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Marquette | first = Jacques | author-link = Jacques Marquette | year = 1673 | contribution = The Mississippi Voyage of Jolliet and Marquette, 1673 | contribution-url = http://www.americanjourneys.org/aj-051/ | editor-last = Kellogg | editor-first = Louise P. | title = Early Narratives of the Northwest, 1634–1699 | place = New York | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons | page = 235 | oclc = 31431651 }}</ref> Subsequent [[France|French]] writers changed the spelling from ''Meskousing'' to ''Ouisconsin'', and over time this became the name for both the Wisconsin River and the surrounding lands.

The legislature of [[Wisconsin Territory]] made the current spelling official in 1845.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Smith | first = Alice E. | title = Stephen H.

The [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for Wisconsin and its original meaning have both grown obscure. While interpretations vary, most implicate the river and the red sandstone that lines its banks. One leading theory holds that the name originated from the [[Miami-Illinois language|Miami]] word ''Meskonsing'', meaning "it lies red", a reference to the setting of the Wisconsin River as it flows through the reddish sandstone of the [[Dells of the Wisconsin River|Wisconsin Dells]].<ref>McCafferty, Michael. 2003.

===Early history===

[[File:Wisconsin in 1718.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Wisconsin in 1718, [[Guillaume de L'Isle]] map, with the approximate state area highlighted]]

Wisconsin has been home to a wide variety of cultures over the past 14,000 years. The first people arrived around 10,000 BCE during the [[Wisconsin Glaciation]]. These early inhabitants, called [[Paleo-Indians]], hunted now-extinct [[Pleistocene#Fauna|ice age animals]] such as the [[Boaz mastodon]], a prehistoric [[mastodon]] skeleton unearthed along with spear points in southwest Wisconsin.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Theler | first1=James | last2=Boszhardt | first2=Robert | title=Twelve Millennia: Archaeology of the Upper Mississippi River Valley | year=2003 |publisher=University of Iowa Press |location= Iowa City, Iowa |isbn=978-0-87745-847-0|page=59 }}</ref> After the ice age ended around 8000 BCE, people in the subsequent [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering food from wild plants. Agricultural societies emerged gradually over the [[Woodland period]] between 1000 BCE to 1000 CE. Toward the end of this period, Wisconsin was the heartland of the "[[Effigy Mound]] culture", which built thousands of animal-shaped mounds across the landscape.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Birmingham|first1=Robert|last2=Eisenberg|first2=Leslie|title=Indian Mounds of Wisconsin|year=2000 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0-299-16870-4|pages=100–110}}</ref> Later, between 1000 and 1500 CE, the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] and [[Oneota]] cultures built substantial settlements including the fortified village at [[Aztalan State Park|Aztalan]] in southeast Wisconsin.<ref>Birmingham 2000, pp. 152–56</ref> The Oneota may be the ancestors of the modern [[Ioway]] and [[Ho-Chunk]] nations who shared the Wisconsin region with the [[Menominee]] at the time of European contact.<ref>Birmingham 2000, pp. 165–67</ref> Other Native American groups living in Wisconsin when Europeans first settled included the [[Ojibwa]], [[Sauk people|Sauk]], [[Fox people|Fox]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], and [[Pottawatomie]], who migrated to Wisconsin from the east between 1500 and 1700.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boatman|first=John|editor-first=Donald| editor-last=Fixico|title=An Anthology of Western Great Lakes Indian History|publisher=University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee|year=1987|chapter=Historical Overview of the Wisconsin Area: From Early Years to the French, British, and Americans|oclc=18188646}}</ref>

The first European to visit what became Wisconsin was probably the French explorer [[Jean Nicolet]]. He canoed west from [[Georgian Bay]] through the [[Great Lakes]] in 1634, and it is traditionally assumed that he came ashore near [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] at [[Red Banks, Brown County, Wisconsin|Red Banks]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean Nicolet|url=http://www.uwgb.edu/wisfrench/library/articles/nicolet.htm|author=Rodesch, Gerrold C.|year=1984|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin–Green Bay]]|access-date=March 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117084337/http://www.uwgb.edu/wisfrench/library/articles/nicolet.htm|archive-date=January 17, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Pierre Radisson]] and [[Médard des Groseilliers]] visited Green Bay again in 1654–1666 and [[Chequamegon Bay]] in 1659–1660, where they traded for fur with local Native Americans.<ref>{{cite web|title=Turning Points in Wisconsin History: Arrival of the First Europeans|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-006/?action=more_essay|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|access-date=March 13, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DRA27BFV?url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-006/?action=more_essay|archive-date=January 5, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1673, Jacques Marquette and [[Louis Jolliet]] became the first to record a journey on the [[Fox-Wisconsin Waterway]] all the way to the [[Mississippi River]] near [[Prairie du Chien]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jaenen|first=Cornelius|year=1973|title=French colonial attitudes and the exploration of Jolliet and Marquette|journal=Wisconsin Magazine of History|volume=56|issue=4|pages=300–310|url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/ref/collection/wmh/id/26553|access-date=January 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202080523/http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/ref/collection/wmh/id/26553|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[French people|Frenchmen]] like [[Nicholas Perrot]] continued to ply the [[fur trade]] across Wisconsin through the 17th and 18th centuries, but the French made no permanent settlements in Wisconsin before [[British Empire|Great Britain]] won control of the region following the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763. Even so, French traders continued to work in the region after the war, and some, beginning with [[Charles Michel de Langlade|Charles de Langlade]] in 1764, settled in Wisconsin permanently, rather than returning to British-controlled [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dictionary of Wisconsin History: Langlade, Charles Michel|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2266&search_term=Langlade%2C+Charles+Michel|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|access-date=March 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204150014/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2266&search_term=Langlade%2C+Charles+Michel|archive-date=December 4, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

The British gradually took over Wisconsin during the [[French and Indian War]], taking control of Green Bay in 1761 and gaining control of all of Wisconsin in 1763. Like the French, the British were interested in little but the fur trade. One notable event in the fur trading industry in Wisconsin occurred in 1791, when two free African Americans set up a fur trading post among the Menominee at present day [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]]. The first permanent settlers, mostly [[French Canadian]]s, some Anglo-[[New England]]ers and a few [[African American]] freedmen, arrived in Wisconsin while it was under British control. [[Charles Michel de Langlade]] is generally recognized as the first settler, establishing a trading post at Green Bay in 1745, and moving there permanently in 1764.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dictionary of Wisconsin History: Langlade, Charles Michel|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2266&search_term=Langlade%2C+Charles+Michel|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|access-date=March 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204150014/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2266&search_term=Langlade%2C+Charles+Michel|archive-date=December 4, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Settlement began at [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin|Prairie du Chien]] around 1781. The French residents at the trading post in what is now Green Bay, referred to the town as "La Baye", however British fur traders referred to it as "Green Bay", because the water and the shore assumed green tints in early spring. The old French title was gradually dropped, and the British name of "Green Bay" eventually stuck. The region coming under British rule had virtually no adverse effect on the French residents as the British needed the cooperation of the French fur traders and the French fur traders needed the goodwill of the British. During the French occupation of the region licenses for fur trading had been issued scarcely and only to select groups of traders, whereas the British, in an effort to make as much money as possible from the region, issued licenses for fur trading freely, both to British and to French residents. The fur trade in what is now Wisconsin reached its height under British rule, and the first self-sustaining farms in the state were established as well. From 1763 to 1780, Green Bay was a prosperous community which produced its own foodstuff, built graceful cottages and held dances and festivities.<ref>Wisconsin, a Guide to the Badger State page 188</ref>

===U.S. territory===

{{Main|American Revolutionary War|Treaty of Paris (1783)|Northwest Ordinance|Northwest Territory|Indiana Territory|Illinois Territory|Michigan Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Wisconsin Territory}}

Wisconsin became a territorial possession of the United States in 1783 after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In 1787, it became part of the [[Northwest Territory]]. As territorial boundaries subsequently developed, it was then part of [[Indiana Territory]] from 1800 to 1809, [[Illinois Territory]] from 1809 to 1818, and [[Michigan Territory]] from 1818 to 1836. However, the British remained in control until after the [[War of 1812]], the outcome of which finally established an American presence in the area.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wisconsin: A History|last=Nesbit|first=Robert|year=1973|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, WI|isbn=978-0-299-06370-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/wisconsinhistory0000nesb/page/62 62–64]|url=https://archive.org/details/wisconsinhistory0000nesb/page/62}}</ref> Under American control, the economy of the territory shifted from fur trading to lead mining. The prospect of easy mineral wealth drew [[immigrants]] from throughout the U.S. and Europe to the lead deposits located at [[Mineral Point, Wisconsin|Mineral Point]], [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin|Dodgeville]], and nearby areas. Some miners found shelter in the holes they had dug, and earned the nickname "badgers", leading to Wisconsin's identity as the "Badger State".<ref>{{cite web|title=Badger Nickname|url=http://www.uwbadgers.com/trads/nickname.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323002815/http://www.uwbadgers.com/trads/nickname.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 23, 2011|publisher=University of Wisconsin|access-date=March 14, 2010}}</ref> The sudden influx of white miners prompted tension with the local Native American population.

Following these conflicts, [[Wisconsin Territory]] was created by an act of the [[United States Congress]] on April 20, 1836. By fall of that year, the best prairie groves of the counties surrounding what is now Milwaukee were occupied by farmers from the [[New England]] states.<ref>Wisconsin, a Guide to the Badger State page 197</ref>

The [[Erie Canal]] facilitated the travel of both [[Yankee]] settlers and European immigrants to Wisconsin Territory. Yankees from [[New England]] and [[upstate New York]] seized a dominant position in law and politics, enacting policies that marginalized the region's earlier Native American and French-Canadian residents.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 9781107052864| last = Murphy| first = Lucy Eldersveld| title = Great Lakes Creoles: a French-Indian community on the northern borderlands, Prairie du Chien, 1750–1860| location = New York| date = 2014| pages=108–147}}</ref> Yankees also speculated in real estate, platted towns such as Racine, Beloit, Burlington, and Janesville, and established schools, civic institutions, and [[Congregationalist Church|Congregationalist]] churches.<ref>The Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620–1865 by Lois Kimball Mathews page 244</ref><ref>New England in the Life of the World: A Record of Adventure and Achievement By Howard Allen Bridgman page 77</ref><ref>"When is Daddy Coming Home?": An American Family During World War II By Richard Carlton Haney page 8</ref> At the same time, many [[Germans]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Norwegians]], and other immigrants also settled in towns and farms across the territory, establishing [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] institutions.

The growing population allowed Wisconsin to gain statehood on May 29, 1848, as the 30th state. Between 1840 and 1850, Wisconsin's non-Indian population had swollen from 31,000 to 305,000. More than a third of residents (110,500) were foreign born, including 38,000 Germans, 28,000 British immigrants from England, Scotland, and Wales, and 21,000 Irish. Another third (103,000) were [[Yankee]]s from New England and western New York state. Only about 63,000 residents in 1850 had been born in Wisconsin.<ref>Robert C. Nesbit.

Politics in early Wisconsin were defined by the greater national debate over [[slavery in the United States|slavery]]. A free state from its foundation, Wisconsin became a center of northern [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. The debate became especially intense in 1854 after [[Joshua Glover]], a runaway slave from [[Missouri]], was captured in [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]]. Glover was taken into custody under the Federal [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]], but a mob of abolitionists stormed the prison where Glover was held and helped him escape to Canada. In a trial stemming from the incident, the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] ultimately declared the Fugitive Slave Law unconstitutional.<ref>{{cite book|title=Leading Events of Wisconsin History|last=Legler|first=Henry|year=1898|publisher=Sentinel|location=Milwaukee, Wis.|pages=226–229|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/WIReader/WER1124.html|chapter=Rescue of Joshua Glover, a Runaway Slave|access-date=October 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018071024/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/WIReader/WER1124.html|archive-date=October 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], founded on March 20, 1854, by anti-slavery expansion activists in [[Ripon, Wisconsin]], grew to dominate state politics in the aftermath of these events.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nesbit|year=1973|isbn=978-0-299-06370-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/wisconsinhistory0000nesb/page/238 238–239]|title=Wisconsin: a history|url=https://archive.org/details/wisconsinhistory0000nesb/page/238}}</ref> During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], around 91,000 troops from Wisconsin fought for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Turning Points in Wisconsin History: The Iron Brigade, Old Abe and Military Affairs|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-023/?action=more_essay|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|access-date=March 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204150829/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-023/?action=more_essay|archive-date=December 4, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Economic progress===

[[File:Looking over Milwaukee from Bay View in 1882.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Drawing of Industrial Milwaukee in 1882]]

Wisconsin's economy also diversified during the early years of statehood. While lead mining diminished, agriculture became a principal occupation in the southern half of the state. Railroads were built across the state to help transport grains to market, and industries like [[Case Corporation|J.I. Case & Company]] in Racine were founded to build agricultural equipment. Wisconsin briefly became one of the nation's leading producers of wheat during the 1860s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nesbit|year=1973|isbn=978-0-299-06370-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/wisconsinhistory0000nesb/page/273 273]|title=Wisconsin: a history|url=https://archive.org/details/wisconsinhistory0000nesb/page/273}}</ref> Meanwhile, the lumber industry dominated in the heavily forested northern sections of Wisconsin, and sawmills sprang up in cities like [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]], [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]], and [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]]. These economic activities had dire environmental consequences. By the close of the 19th century, intensive agriculture had devastated soil fertility, and lumbering had deforested most of the state.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nesbit|year=1973|isbn=978-0-299-06370-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/wisconsinhistory0000nesb/page/281 281, 309]|title=Wisconsin: a history|url=https://archive.org/details/wisconsinhistory0000nesb/page/281}}</ref> These conditions forced both wheat agriculture and the lumber industry into a precipitous decline.
[[File:Chase Stone Barn - Green Grass.jpg|thumb|The [[Daniel E. Krause Stone Barn]] in [[Chase, Wisconsin|Chase]] was built in 1903, as dairy farming spread across the state.]]

Beginning in the 1890s, farmers in Wisconsin shifted from wheat to dairy production in order to make more sustainable and profitable use of their land. Many immigrants carried cheese-making traditions that, combined with the state's suitable geography and dairy research led by [[Stephen Moulton Babcock|Stephen Babcock]] at the [[University of Wisconsin]], helped the state build a reputation as "America's Dairyland".<ref>{{cite book|title= The Progressive Era, 1893–1914|series=History of Wisconsin|volume=4|first=John|last=Buenker|publisher=State Historical Society of Wisconsin|location=Madison, WI|year=1998|editor-first=William Fletcher|editor-last=Thompson|isbn=978-0-87020-303-9|pages=25, 40–41, 62}}</ref> Meanwhile, conservationists including [[Aldo Leopold]] helped re-establish the state's forests during the early 20th century,<ref>{{cite web|title=Turning Points in Wisconsin History: The Modern Environmental Movement|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-048/?action=more_essay|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|access-date=March 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204150526/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-048/?action=more_essay|archive-date=December 4, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> paving the way for a more renewable lumber and [[paper mill]]ing industry as well as promoting recreational tourism in the northern woodlands. Manufacturing also boomed in Wisconsin during the early 20th century, driven by an immense immigrant workforce arriving from Europe. Industries in cities like Milwaukee ranged from brewing and food processing to heavy machine production and tool-making, leading Wisconsin to rank 8th among U.S. states in total product value by 1910.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Progressive Era, 1893–1914|series=History of Wisconsin|volume=4|first=John|last=Buenker|publisher=State Historical Society of Wisconsin|location=Madison, WI|year=1998|editor-first=William Fletcher|editor-last=Thompson|isbn=978-0-87020-303-9|pages=80–81}}</ref>

The early 20th century was also notable for the emergence of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] politics championed by [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert M. La Follette]].

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, citizens of Wisconsin were divided over things such as creation of the United Nations, support for the European recovery, and the growth of the Soviet Union's power. However, when Europe divided into Communist and capitalist camps and the Communist revolution in China succeeded in 1949, public opinion began to move towards support for the protection of democracy and capitalism against Communist expansion.<ref>A Short History of Wisconsin By Erika Janik page 149</ref>

Wisconsin took part in several political extremes in the mid to late 20th century, ranging from the [[McCarthyism|anti-communist]] crusades of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in the 1950s to the radical antiwar protests at UW-Madison that culminated in the [[Sterling Hall bombing]] in August 1970. The state undertook [[welfare reform]] under Republican Governor [[Tommy Thompson]] during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tommy Thompson: Human Services Reformer|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122179&page=1|date=September 4, 2004|access-date=March 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130132917/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122179&page=1|archive-date=January 30, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The state's economy also underwent further transformations towards the close of the 20th century, as heavy industry and manufacturing declined in favor of a [[service economy]] based on medicine, education, agribusiness, and tourism.

Two U.S. Navy battleships, [[USS Wisconsin (BB-9)|BB-9]] and [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|BB-64]], were named for the state.

==Geography==

{{Main|Geography of Wisconsin}}
[[File:Wisconsin geographic provinces.svg|left|thumb|Wisconsin is divided into five geographic regions.]]
[[File:Bluff.jpg|thumb|The [[Driftless Area]] of southwestern Wisconsin is characterized by bluffs carved in [[sedimentary]] rock by water from melting [[Ice Age]] glaciers.]]
[[File:Timms Hill, Wisconsin.JPG|thumb|[[Timms Hill]] is the highest natural point in Wisconsin at {{convert|1951.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}; it is located in the Town of [[Hill, Wisconsin|Hill]], [[Price County, Wisconsin|Price County]].]]

Wisconsin is bordered by the [[Montreal River (Wisconsin–Michigan)|Montreal River]]; [[Lake Superior]] and [[Michigan]] to the north; by [[Lake Michigan]] to the east; by [[Illinois]] to the south; and by [[Iowa]] to the southwest and [[Minnesota]] to the northwest. A border dispute with [[Michigan]] was settled by two cases, both [[Wisconsin v. Michigan]], in 1934 and 1935. The state's boundaries include the [[Mississippi River]] and [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin–Minnesota)|St. Croix River]] in the west, and the [[Menominee River]] in the northeast.

With its location between the [[Great Lakes]] and the Mississippi River, Wisconsin is home to a wide variety of geographical features. The state is divided into five distinct regions. In the north, the [[Lake Superior Lowland]] occupies a belt of land along Lake Superior. Just to the south, the [[Northern Highland]] has massive mixed hardwood and coniferous forests including the {{convert|1500000|acre|km2}} [[Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest]], as well as thousands of glacial lakes, and the state's highest point, [[Timms Hill]]. In the middle of the state, the [[Central Plain (Wisconsin)|Central Plain]] has some unique [[sandstone]] formations like the [[Dells of the Wisconsin River]] in addition to rich farmland. The [[Eastern Ridges and Lowlands]] region in the southeast is home to many of Wisconsin's largest cities. The ridges include the [[Niagara Escarpment]] that stretches from [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Black River Escarpment (Wisconsin)|Black River Escarpment]] and the Magnesian Escarpment.<ref name=Martin1965>{{cite book|isbn=978-0-299-03475-7|url=https://archive.org/details/physicalgeograph0000mart|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/physicalgeograph0000mart/page/247 247]|quote=Black River Escarpment.|title=The physical geography of Wisconsin|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Press]]|year=1965|author=Lawrence Martin|access-date=September 14, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wisconline.com/wisconsin/geoprovinces/easternridges.html|title=The Eastern Ridges and Lowlands of Wisconsin|publisher=Wisconsin Online|access-date=September 14, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010209021338/http://www.wisconline.com/wisconsin/geoprovinces/easternridges.html|archive-date=February 9, 2001|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010209021338/http://www.wisconline.com/wisconsin/geoprovinces/easternridges.html Webcitation.org], Wisconline.com, September 14, 2010.</ref>

In the southwest, the [[Western Upland]] is a rugged landscape with a mix of forest and farmland, including many bluffs on the [[Mississippi River]]. This region is part of the [[Driftless Area]], which also includes portions of [[Iowa]], [[Illinois]], and [[Minnesota]]. This area was not covered by [[glacier]]s during the most recent ice age, the [[Wisconsin Glaciation]]. Overall, 46% of Wisconsin's land area is covered by forest. [[Langlade County, Wisconsin|Langlade County]] has a soil rarely found outside of the county called [[Antigo (soil)|Antigo silt loam]].<ref>{{Cite document|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_019841.pdf|title=Wisconsin State Soil: Antigo Silt Loam|author=United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service|date=April 1999|access-date=October 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516155048/https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_019841.pdf|archive-date=May 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Climate===

[[File:Wisconsin Köppen.svg|thumb|right|Köppen climate types of Wisconsin]]

Most of Wisconsin is classified as warm-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), while southern and southwestern portions are classified as hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] (Köppen ''Dfa'').

Since its founding, Wisconsin has been ethnically heterogeneous. Following the period of French fur traders, the next wave of settlers were miners, many of whom were [[Cornish American|Cornish]], who settled the southwestern area of the state. The next wave was dominated by "Yankees", migrants of [[English American|English descent]] from [[New England]] and [[upstate New York]]; in the early years of statehood, they dominated the state's heavy industry, finance, politics, and education. Between 1850 and 1900, the immigrants were mostly [[German Americans|Germans]], [[Scandinavian Americans|Scandinavians]] (the largest group being [[Norwegian American|Norwegian]]), [[Irish Americans|Irish]], and [[Polish Americans|Poles]]. In the 20th century, a number of [[African Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans|Mexicans]] settled in [[Milwaukee]]; and after the end of the [[Vietnam War]] came an influx of [[Hmong Americans|Hmongs]].

The various ethnic groups settled in different areas of the state. Although German immigrants settled throughout the state, the largest concentration was in Milwaukee. Norwegian immigrants settled in lumbering and farming areas in the north and west. Irish, Italian, and Polish immigrants settled primarily in urban areas.<ref>Miller, Frank H., [http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/tp&CISOPTR=14489 "The Polanders in Wisconsin"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829135614/http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Ftp&CISOPTR=14489 |date=August 29, 2009 }}, Parkman Club Publications No. 10.

African Americans came to Milwaukee, especially from 1940 on. 86% of Wisconsin's African-American population live in four cities: [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]], [[Beloit, Wisconsin|Beloit]], [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]], with Milwaukee home to nearly three-fourths of the state's black Americans. In the [[Great Lakes]] region, only Detroit and [[Cleveland]] have a higher percentage of African-American residents. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Government==

[[File:Capitol Madison, WI.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wisconsin State Capitol]] is located on the [[isthmus]] between [[Lake Mendota]] and [[Lake Monona]], in the city of [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]].]]

[[Wisconsin Constitution|Wisconsin's Constitution]] outlines the structure and function of state government, which is organized into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The [[Wisconsin Blue Book]] is the primary published reference about the government and politics of the state. Re-published every two years, copies are available from state legislators.

===Executive===

The executive branch is headed by the [[Governor of Wisconsin|governor]]. The current governor, [[Tony Evers]], assumed office on January 7, 2019. In addition to the governor, the executive branch includes five other elected constitutional officers: [[Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin|Lieutenant Governor]], [[Wisconsin Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Wisconsin Attorney General|Attorney General]], [[List of State Treasurers of Wisconsin|Treasurer]], and [[Superintendent of Public Instruction of Wisconsin|State Superintendent of Public Instruction]]. Four members of the Wisconsin executive branch are Democrats. The [[Superintendent of Public Instruction of Wisconsin]] is a non-partisan position.

===Legislative===

The [[Wisconsin State Legislature]] is Wisconsin's legislative branch. The Legislature is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of the [[Wisconsin State Assembly|Assembly]] and the [[Wisconsin State Senate|Senate]].

===Judicial===

Wisconsin's court system has four levels: municipal courts, circuit courts, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. Municipal courts typically handle cases involving [[local ordinance]] matters. The [[Wisconsin Circuit Court|circuit courts]] are Wisconsin's [[Court of First Instance|trial courts]], they have [[original jurisdiction]] in all civil and criminal cases within the state. Challenges to circuit court rulings are heard by the [[Wisconsin Court of Appeals]], consisting of sixteen judges who typically sit in three-judge panels. As the state's highest appellate court, the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] may hear both appeals from lower courts and original actions. In addition to deciding cases, the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] is responsible for administering the state's court system and regulating the practice of law in Wisconsin.<ref name="Wisconsin Court System">{{cite web|url=http://www.wicourts.gov/courts/overview/overview.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System—court system overview|publisher=Wicourts.gov|date=September 28, 2011|access-date=February 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214080934/http://www.wicourts.gov/courts/overview/overview.htm|archive-date=February 14, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Federal===

In the [[Us senate|United States Senate]] Wisconsin is represented by [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]] and [[Tammy Baldwin]]. Wisconsin is divided into eight [[Wisconsin Congressional Districts|congressional districts]].

===Taxes===

{{main|Sales taxes in the United States|Property tax in the United States|State income tax}}

Wisconsin collects personal [[income tax]]es (based on five [[income bracket]]s) which range from 4% to 7.65%. The state [[sales tax|sales]] and [[use tax]] rate is 5.0%. Fifty-nine counties have an additional sales/use tax of 0.5%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revenue.wi.gov/esd/cotax07.html|title=County Sales Tax Distribution-2007|access-date=March 24, 2007|date=March 6, 2007|publisher=Wisconsin Department of Revenue|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513134039/http://www.revenue.wi.gov/esd/cotax07.html|archive-date=May 13, 2008}}</ref> [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] and four surrounding counties have an additional temporary 0.1% tax that helps fund the [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] baseball stadium, which was completed in 2001.

The most common property tax assessed on Wisconsin residents is the real [[property tax]], or their residential property tax. Wisconsin does not impose a property tax on vehicles, but does levy an annual registration fee. Property taxes are the most important tax revenue source for Wisconsin's local governments, as well as major methods of funding school districts, vocational technical colleges, special purpose districts and tax incremental finance districts. Equalized values are based on the full market value of all taxable property in the state, except for agricultural land. In order to provide property tax relief for farmers, the value of agricultural land is determined by its value for agricultural uses, rather than for its possible development value. Equalized values are used to distribute state aid payments to counties, municipalities, and technical colleges. Assessments prepared by local assessors are used to distribute the property tax burden within individual municipalities.

Wisconsin does not assess a tax on [[intangible property]]. Wisconsin does not collect [[inheritance tax]]es. Until January 1, 2008, Wisconsin's [[estate tax]] was decoupled from the federal estate tax laws; therefore the state imposed its own estate tax on certain large estates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revenue.wi.gov/faqs/ise/estate.html#ret3|title=Wisconsin Department of Revenue|publisher=Revenue.wi.gov|access-date=July 25, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722063948/http://www.revenue.wi.gov/faqs/ise/estate.html#ret3|archive-date=July 22, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

There are no [[toll road]]s in Wisconsin; highway construction and maintenance are funded in part by [[motor fuel tax]] revenues, and the remaining balance is drawn from the State General Fund. Non-highway road construction and maintenance are funded by local governments (municipalities or [[County|counties]]).

===International relations===

A [[Mexican consulate]] opened in Milwaukee on July 1, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/business/mexican-consulate-to-open-in-milwaukee-on-july-1-b99750361z1-384305021.html|title=Mexican Consulate to open in Milwaukee on July 1|website=jsonline.com|access-date=March 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303110303/http://archive.jsonline.com/business/mexican-consulate-to-open-in-milwaukee-on-july-1-b99750361z1-384305021.html|archive-date=March 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Wisconsin has had a diplomatic relationship with the Japanese prefecture of [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]] since 1990.<ref name="iw2006">{{cite web|url=http://international.wi.gov/SisterStates.html|title=Sister-States and Cities|access-date=February 23, 2012|date=February 4, 2010|publisher=International Wisconsin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204165758/http://international.wi.gov/SisterStates.html|archive-date=February 4, 2010}}</ref>

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Wisconsin was a [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] state; in fact it is the state that gave birth to the Republican Party, although ethno-religious issues in the late 19th century caused a brief split in the coalition. The [[Bennett Law]] campaign of 1890 dealt with foreign language teaching in schools. Many Germans switched to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] because of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party's]] support of the law.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kellogg|first1=Louise Phelps|title=The Bennett Law in Wisconsin|journal=Wisconsin Magazine of History|date=September 1918|volume=2|issue=1|pages=3–25|jstor=4630124}}</ref>

Wisconsin's political history encompasses, on the one hand, [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|"Fighting Bob" La Follette]] and the [[Progressive movement]]; and on the other, the Republican and anti-Communist [[Joseph McCarthy|Joe McCarthy]]. From the early 20th century, the [[Socialist Party of America]] had a base in Milwaukee. The phenomenon was referred to as "[[sewer socialism]]" because the elected officials were more concerned with public works and reform than with revolution (although revolutionary socialism existed in the city as well). Its influence faded in the late 1950s, largely because of the [[Second Red Scare|red scare]] and racial tensions.<ref name="smith2003">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kevin D.|date=Spring 2003|title=From Socialism to Racism: The Politics of Class and Identity in Postwar Milwaukee|journal=Michigan Historical Review|volume=29|issue=1|pages=71–95|doi=10.2307/20174004|jstor=20174004}}</ref> The first Socialist mayor of a large city in the United States was [[Emil Seidel]], elected mayor of Milwaukee in 1910; another Socialist, [[Daniel Hoan]], was mayor of Milwaukee from 1916 to 1940; and a third, [[Frank P. Zeidler]], from 1948 to 1960. Succeeding Frank Zeidler, the last of Milwaukee's Socialist mayors, ([[Henry Maier]]), a former Wisconsin State Senator and member of the Democratic Party was elected mayor of Milwaukee in 1960. Maier remained in office for 28 years, the longest-serving mayor in Milwaukee history. Socialist [[newspaper editor]] [[Victor Berger]] was repeatedly elected as a U.S. Representative, although he was prevented from serving for some time because of his opposition to the First World War.

Through the first half of the 20th century, Wisconsin's politics were dominated by [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]] and his sons, originally of the [[Republican Party of Wisconsin|Republican Party]], but later of the revived [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]]. Since 1945, the state has maintained a close balance between Republicans and [[Democratic Party of Wisconsin|Democrats]]. Recent leading Republicans include former Governor [[Tommy Thompson]] and Congressman [[Jim Sensenbrenner]]; prominent Democrats include Senators [[Herb Kohl]] and [[Russ Feingold]], the only [[United States Senate|Senator]] to vote against the [[Patriot Act]] in 2001, and Congressman [[David Obey]].<ref name="conant2006">{{cite book|last=Conant|first=James K.|title=Wisconsin Politics and Government: America's Laboratory of Democracy|date=March 1, 2006|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|isbn=978-0-8032-1548-1|chapter=1}}</ref>

===Federal elections===
{{See also|United States presidential elections in Wisconsin}}
[[File:Paul Ryan Carroll University 3.jpg|thumb|left|Wisconsin congressman [[Paul Ryan]] was the 2012 Republican Party nominee for vice-president.|alt=A middle-aged man in a white shirt and black and yellow striped tie speaks into a microphone on stage in front of a crowd.]]

Wisconsin has leaned [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] in recent presidential elections, although [[Donald Trump]] managed to win the state in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] by a narrow margin of 0.8%. This marked the first time Wisconsin voted for a Republican presidential candidate since [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], when every state except Minnesota and Washington D.C. went Republican. In [[2012 United States presidential election in Wisconsin|2012]], Republican presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]] chose Wisconsin Congressman [[Paul Ryan]], a native of [[Janesville, Wisconsin|Janesville]], as his running mate against incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama and Vice President [[Joe Biden]]. Obama nevertheless carried Wisconsin by a margin of 53% to 46%. Both the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections were quite close, with Wisconsin receiving heavy doses of national advertising, in accord with its status as a "swing", or pivot, state. [[Al Gore]] carried the presidential vote in 2000 by 5,700 votes, and [[John Kerry]] won Wisconsin in 2004 by 11,000 votes. [[Barack Obama]] carried the state in 2008 by 381,000 votes (56%).

Republicans had a stronghold in the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox Valley]], but elected a Democrat, [[Steve Kagen]], of [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]], for the 8th Congressional District in 2006. However, Kagen survived only two terms and was replaced by Republican Reid Ribble in the Republican Party's sweep of Wisconsin in November 2010, the first time the Republican Party had taken back both chambers of the state legislature and the governorship in the same election. The City of Milwaukee heads the list of Wisconsin's Democratic strongholds, which also includes Madison and the state's Native American [[Indian reservations|reservations]]. Wisconsin's largest Congressional district, the 7th, had voted Democratic since 1969. Its representative, David Obey, chaired the powerful House Appropriations Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=400300|title=David Obey, former U.S. Representative|publisher=GovTrack.us|access-date=February 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303180914/http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=400300|archive-date=March 3, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> However, Obey retired and the once-Democratic seat was taken by Republican [[Sean Duffy]] in November 2010. The 2010 elections saw a huge Republican resurgence in Wisconsin. Republicans took control of the governor's office and both houses of the state legislature. Republican [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]] defeated Democratic incumbent U.S. Senator [[Russ Feingold]] and Republicans took two previously Democratic-held House seats, creating a 5–3 Republican majority House delegation.

===State elections===

[[File:2011 Wisconsin Budget Protests 1 JO.jpg|thumb|The [[2011 Wisconsin Act 10]] led to large protests around the state capitol building in Madison.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-wisconsin-protests-20110227,0,3378088.story|author=Abby Sewell|title=Protesters out in force nationwide to oppose Wisconsin's anti-union bill|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 27, 2011|access-date=February 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303124853/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-wisconsin-protests-20110227,0,3378088.story|archive-date=March 3, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>]]

At the statewide level, Wisconsin is competitive, with control regularly alternating between the two parties. In 2006, Democrats gained in a national sweep of opposition to the Bush administration, and the Iraq War. The retiring GOP 8th District Congressman, Mark Green, of Green Bay, ran against the incumbent Governor [[Jim Doyle]]. Green lost by 8% statewide, making Doyle the first Democratic governor to be re-elected in 32 years. The Republicans lost control of the state Senate. Although Democrats gained eight seats in the state Assembly, Republicans retained a five-vote majority. In 2008, Democrats regained control of the State Assembly by a 52–46 margin, marking the first time since 1986 that the governor and state legislature were both Democratic.<ref>{{Cite news|title=ELECTION 2008 Darling Wins Despite Tough Day for GOP Democrats to Control Assembly for First Time in 14 Years|last1=Walters|first1=S.|date=November 9, 2008|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|last2=Marley|first2=P.|page=Z3|via=ProQuest}}</ref>

With the election of [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] in 2010, Republicans won both chambers of the legislature and the governorship, the first time all three changed partisan control in the same election. His first year in office saw the introduction of the [[2011 Wisconsin Act 10]], which removed collective bargaining rights for state employees. On February 14, 2011, the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]] [[2011 Wisconsin protests|erupted with protests]] when the Legislature took up a bill that would end most collective bargaining rights for state employees, except for wages, to address the $3.6 bil. deficit. The protests attracted tens of thousands of people each day,{{when|date=November 2011}} and garnered international attention. The Assembly passed the bill 53–42 on March 10 after the State Senate passed it the night before, and sent it to the Governor for his signature.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/03/10/wisconsin.budget/index.html?hpt=T1&iref=BN1|title=Wisconsin Assembly passes bill to curb collective bargaining|publisher=CNN|date=March 10, 2011|access-date=April 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219092853/http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/03/10/wisconsin.budget/index.html?hpt=T1&iref=BN1|archive-date=February 19, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In response to the [[2011 Wisconsin Act 10|bill]], enough signatures were gathered to force a [[Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election|recall election]] against [[Scott Walker (politician)|Governor Walker]]. [[Tom Barrett (Wisconsin politician)|Tom Barrett]], the mayor of Milwaukee and Walker's 2010 opponent, won the Democratic primary and faced Walker again. Walker won the election by 53% to 46% and became the first governor in United States history to retain his seat after a recall election.

Following the 2014 general election on November 4, 2014, the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, State Attorney General and State Treasurer were all Republicans, while the Secretary of State was a Democrat.<ref>[http://wisconsinvote.org Wisconsin 2014 election results] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102143923/https://www.wisconsinvote.org/ |date=January 2, 2018 }}, wisconsinvote.org; accessed November 5, 2014.</ref> However, Walker was defeated for a third term in [[Wisconsin gubernatorial election, 2018|2018]] by Democrat [[Tony Evers]]. Democratic U.S. Senator [[Tammy Baldwin]] was also elected to a second term and Democrats won all constitutional statewide offices on the ballot including Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, and State Treasurer, the first time this happened in Wisconsin since 1982. Later however, in April 2019, conservative judge [[Brian Hagedorn]] defeated his liberal opponent [[Lisa Neubauer]] by 6,100 votes.

===Manufacturing===

Wisconsin is home to a very large and diversified manufacturing economy, with special focus on transportation and capital equipment. Major Wisconsin companies in these categories include the [[Kohler Company]]; [[Mercury Marine]]; [[Rockwell Automation]]; [[Johnson Controls]]; [[John Deere]]; [[Briggs & Stratton]]; [[Milwaukee Electric Tool Company]]; [[Miller Electric]]; [[Caterpillar Inc.]]; [[Joy Global]]; [[Oshkosh Corporation]]; [[Harley-Davidson]]; [[Case IH]]; [[S. C. Johnson & Son]]; [[Ashley Furniture]]; [[Ariens]]; and [[Evinrude Outboard Motors]].

===Consumer goods===

Wisconsin is a major producer of paper, packaging, and other consumer goods. Major consumer products companies based in the state include SC Johnson & Co., and Diversey, Inc. Wisconsin also ranks first nationwide in the production of paper products; the lower Fox River from [[Lake Winnebago]] to [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]] has 24 [[paper mill]]s along its {{convert|39|mi|km}} stretch.

The development and manufacture of health care devices and software is a growing sector of the state's economy, with key players such as [[GE Healthcare]], [[Epic Systems]], and [[TomoTherapy]].

===Tourism===

[[File:Wisconsin welcome sign.JPG|thumb|State welcome sign]]

Tourism is a major industry in Wisconsin—the state's third largest, according to the Department of Tourism. Tourist destinations such as the [[House on the Rock]] near [[Spring Green, Wisconsin|Spring Green]], [[Circus World Museum]] in [[Baraboo, Wisconsin|Baraboo]], and The [[Dells of the Wisconsin River]] draw thousands of visitors annually, and festivals such as [[Summerfest]] and the [[Oshkosh Airshow|EAA Oshkosh Airshow]] draw international attention, along with hundreds of thousands of visitors.<ref>Birgit Leisen, "Image segmentation: the case of a tourism destination". ''Journal of services marketing'' (2001) 15#1 pp: 49–66 on Oshkosh.</ref>

Given the large number of lakes and rivers in the state, water recreation is very popular. In the North Country, what had been an industrial area focused on timber has largely been transformed into a vacation destination. Popular interest in the environment and environmentalism, added to traditional interests in hunting and fishing, has attracted a large urban audience within driving range.<ref>Aaron Shapiro, ''The Lure of the North Woods: Cultivating Tourism in the Upper Midwest'' (University of Minnesota Press, 2015).</ref>

The distinctive [[Door Peninsula]], which extends off the eastern coast of the state, contains one of the state's tourist destinations, [[Door County, Wisconsin|Door County]]. Door County is a popular destination for boaters because of the large number of natural harbors, bays, and boat launches on both the Green Bay and Lake Michigan sides of the peninsula that forms the county. The area draws more than two million visitors yearly<ref>[http://map.co.door.wi.us/planning/Comp-Plan/Completed/Town%20of%20Sevasopol%20Comprehensive%20Plan.pdf Town of Sevastopol Comprehensive Plan 2028] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029161327/http://map.co.door.wi.us/planning/Comp-Plan/Completed/Town%20of%20Sevasopol%20Comprehensive%20Plan.pdf |date=October 29, 2014 }}, November 2008, Chapter 4, page 11, (page 64 of the pdf).</ref> to its quaint villages, seasonal cherry picking, and [[fish boil]]s.<ref>William H.

On January 1, 2008, a new [[tax incentive]] for the film industry came into effect. The first major production to take advantage was [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]]'s [[Public Enemies (2009 film)|''Public Enemies'']]. While the producers spent $18&nbsp;million on the film, it was reported that most of it went to out-of-state workers and for out-of-state services; Wisconsin taxpayers had provided $4.6&nbsp;million in subsidies, and derived only $5&nbsp;million in revenues from the film's making.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2009/03/30/daily29.html |title="Commerce study slams film incentives law" ''The Business Journal of Milwaukee'' March 31, 2009 |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=March 31, 2009 |access-date=July 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609210524/http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2009/03/30/daily29.html |archive-date=June 9, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Education==

{{See also|List of colleges and universities in Wisconsin|List of high schools in Wisconsin|List of school districts in Wisconsin}}

Wisconsin, along with Minnesota and Michigan, was among the [[Midwestern]] leaders in the emergent American state university movement following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in the United States. By the start of the 20th century, education in the state advocated the "[[Wisconsin Idea]]", which emphasized service to the people of the state. The "Wisconsin Idea" exemplified the Progressive movement within colleges and universities at the time.<ref name=nye>{{cite book|last=Rudolph|first=Frederick|title=The American College and University: A History|publisher=The [[University of Georgia Press]], Athens and London|year=1990}}</ref>

Today, public post-secondary education in Wisconsin includes both the 26-campus [[University of Wisconsin System]], with the flagship university [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and the 16-campus [[Wisconsin Technical College System]]. Private colleges and universities include Alverno College, [[Beloit College]], [[Cardinal Stritch University]], [[Carroll University]], [[Carthage College]], [[Concordia University Wisconsin]], [[Edgewood College]], [[Lakeland College (Wisconsin)|Lakeland College]], [[Lawrence University]], [[Marquette University]], [[Medical College of Wisconsin]], [[Milwaukee School of Engineering]], [[Ripon College (Wisconsin)|Ripon College]], [[St. Norbert College]], [[Wisconsin Lutheran College]], [[Viterbo University]], and others.

Residents of Wisconsin are referred to as Wisconsinites. The traditional prominence of references to [[dairy farming]] and [[cheesemaking]] in Wisconsin's rural economy (the state's [[license plates]] have read "America's Dairyland" since 1940)<ref>Christopulos, Mike and Joslyn, Jay.

====Architecture====

The [[Milwaukee Art Museum]], with its ''[[brise soleil]]'' designed by [[Santiago Calatrava]], is known for its interesting architecture. [[Monona Terrace]] in Madison, a convention center designed by Taliesin architect Anthony Puttnam, is based on a 1930s design by Wisconsin native [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].<ref>[http://www.purecontemporary.com/Interview/article/11 Pure Contemporary interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012181448/http://purecontemporary.com/Interview/article/11 |date=October 12, 2007 }} with Anthony Puttnam</ref> Wright's home and studio in the 20th century was at [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]], south of Spring Green. Decades after Wright's death, Taliesin remains an architectural office and school for his followers.

===Alcohol culture===

Drinking has long been considered a significant part of Wisconsin culture, and the state ranks at or near the top of national measures of per-capita alcohol consumption, consumption of alcohol per state, and proportion of drinkers. Consumption per-capita per-event, however, ranks low among the nation; number of events (number of times alcohol is involved) is significantly higher or highest, but consumption at each event smaller, marking Wisconsin's consumption as frequent and moderate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/31237904.html|author=Rick Romell|title=Drinking deeply ingrained in Wisconsin's culture|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=October 19, 2008|access-date=August 18, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114133501/http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/31237904.html|archive-date=January 14, 2012}}</ref> Factors such as cultural identification with the state's heritage of German immigration, the long-standing presence of major breweries in Milwaukee, and a cold climate are often associated with the prevalence of drinking in Wisconsin.

In Wisconsin, the legal drinking age is 21, except when accompanied by a parent, guardian, or spouse who is at least 21 years old. Age requirements are waived for possessing alcohol when employed by a brewer, brewpub, beer and/or liquor wholesaler, or producer of alcohol fuel. The minimum legal age to purchase alcohol is 21, with no exceptions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dor.state.wi.us/faqs/ise/atundrg.html|title=Wisconsin Department of Revenue, Alcohol Age Questions|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213022814/http://www.dor.state.wi.us/faqs/ise/atundrg.html|archive-date=December 13, 2014}}</ref> The Absolute Sobriety law states that any person not of legal drinking age (currently 21) may not drive after consuming alcohol.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.uwplatt.edu/files/police/absolutesobriety.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109083553/https://www.uwplatt.edu/files/police/absolutesobriety.pdf |archive-date=January 9, 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

[[File:Lambeau Field panorama.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|[[Lambeau Field]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] is home to the [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]].]]

Wisconsin is represented by major league teams in three sports: football, baseball, and basketball. [[Lambeau Field]], located in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], is home to the [[National Football League]]'s [[Green Bay Packers]]. The Packers have been part of the NFL since the league's second season in 1921 and hold the record for the most NFL titles, earning the city of Green Bay the nickname "Titletown USA". The Packers are the smallest city franchise in the NFL and the only one owned by shareholders statewide. The franchise was founded by "Curly" Lambeau who played and coached for them. The Green Bay Packers are one of the most successful small-market professional sports franchises in the world and have won 13 NFL championships, including the first two AFL-NFL Championship games ([[Super Bowl]]s [[Super Bowl I|I]] and [[Super Bowl II|II]]), [[Super Bowl XXXI]] and [[Super Bowl XLV]]. The state's support of the team is evidenced by the 81,000-person waiting list for season tickets to Lambeau Field.<ref>Green Bay Packers, Inc., [http://www.packers.com/fan_zone/faq/ Fan Zone FAQ], accessed February 28, 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318031051/http://www.packers.com/fan_zone/faq/ |date=March 18, 2010 }}</ref>

The [[Milwaukee Brewers]], the state's only major league baseball team, play in [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] in Milwaukee, the successor to [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] since 2001. In 1982, the Brewers won the [[American League]] Championship, marking their most successful season. The team switched from the American League to the National League starting with the 1998 season. Before the Brewers, Milwaukee had two prior Major League teams. The first team, also called the Brewers, played only one season in the newly founded American League in 1901 before moving to St. Louis and becoming the Browns, who are now the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. Milwaukee was also the home of the [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] franchise when they moved from Boston from 1953 to 1965, winning the [[World Series]] in 1957 and the National League pennant in 1958, before they moved to Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/history/story_of_the_braves.jsp|title=Story of the Braves—History|website=Atlanta Braves|access-date=May 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030062629/http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/history/story_of_the_braves.jsp|archive-date=October 30, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>
