[[Turkey]] emits about 500 million [[tonnes]] of human-made [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) every year, which is around one percent of the world's total. '''Greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey''' are mainly [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) from burning [[coal in Turkey|coal]], [[Energy_in_Turkey#Oil|oil]] and [[Energy_in_Turkey#Gas|natural gas]]. Most coal is burnt in [[List of power stations in Turkey|the nation's power stations]]. Oil is refined and fuels almost all [[Transport in Turkey|Turkey's cars, trucks. and planes]], Natural gas heats buildings and generates [[electricity sector in Turkey|electricity]]. Growing forests take up some carbon dioxide, but not nearly as much as is being discharged into the air.  

Far less [[methane]] (unburnt natural gas) and [[nitrous oxide]] ({{N2O}}) is emitted, but they are more potent than carbon dioxide in the short-term. Methane leaks from some coal mines and is belched by cattle. Nitrous oxide is given off by manure and fertilised soil. Whereas carbon dioxide emissions stay in the atmosphere for centuries, methane is broken down in years and nitrous oxide in decades. 

In 2019 of [[List of countries by greenhouse gas emissions|emissions by country]] Turkey was the 15th largest emitter,<ref name=":11" /> and the main influence on emissions is the government through national [[Energy_in_Turkey#Policy|policy on energy]], [[Turkish construction and contracting industry|construction]], transport, and [[Agriculture in Turkey|agriculture]].
