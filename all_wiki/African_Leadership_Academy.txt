To achieve this goal, ALA teaches a two-year curriculum in [[African Studies]] and [[Entrepreneurial Leadership]], as well as the usual academic core subjects.

== History ==
The founders of ALA, around 2004 launched [[Global Leadership Adventures]], a summer program that would be a precursor to ALA.

In 2006, Swaniker and Bradford were recognized, by [[Echoing Green]], who described them as ''two of the 15 best emerging social entrepreneurs in the world''.<ref>[http://www.echoinggreen.org/fellows/christopher-bradford-and-frederick-swaniker Echoing Green] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519011408/http://www.echoinggreen.org/fellows/christopher-bradford-and-frederick-swaniker |date=19 May 2009 }}</ref> In 2007 the initial campus was confirmed, and [[Christopher Khaemba]] was announced as the inaugural Dean of the School while the current dean is Hatim Eltayeb.

== ALA campus ==
The campus is located in Honeydew, on the outskirts of Johannesburg. Students share a [[dormitory]], and there are modern facilities including a sports field, 350 seater auditorium, classrooms and dining hall. In 2014, construction began on new dormitories that will allow ALA to increase new student numbers to 120 in 2016.

== Admission process ==

=== Anzisha Prize ===
The Anzisha Prize seeks to award young entrepreneurs who have developed and implemented innovative solutions to social challenges or started successful businesses within their communities. 15 finalists from across Africa win a spot in a lifelong fellowship what will help to accelerate their path to entrepreneurship success. The first step in this journey is that they win an all-expenses paid trip to South Africa to be a part of a ten day long entrepreneurship workshop and conference at the African Leadership Academy campus on the outskirts of Johannesburg.  The grand prize winners, selected from these finalists, will share prizes worth US$100,000. The fellowship continues thereafter, offering them business consulting services to unlock growth potential in their venture, connecting them to a global network of leaders, providing access to global speaking opportunities, and supporting their professional development.

In addition to the $100 000 competition, the Anzisha Prize seeks to fundamentally and significantly increase the number of job generative entrepreneurs in Africa. They believe that a key to doing so is to test, implement and then share models for identifying, training and connecting high potential, very young entrepreneurs (15 to 22 year olds) so that many more organisations have better collective success in creating a pipeline entrepreneurs with the capabilities for scale.

The Anzisha strategy has three pillars:
* Celebrate very young entrepreneurs and actively share their stories, to increase the likelihood that others will choose to emulate their success. (Watch our recent Gala Awards Highlights, an Anzisha Prize explainer video and read our latest magazine)
* Train and accelerate very young entrepreneurs, such that we develop and then share models of entrepreneur education and support more likely to succeed with teens and very young adults. (Read about our fellowship experience, and meet our fellows)
* Influence entrepreneurship education (secondary and tertiary levels) to not only increase the likelihood of more young entrepreneurs, but empathy and support for entrepreneurship as a choice by others. (Watch a video about our high-school Student Enterprise Program)

=== Africa Careers Network ===
Africa Careers Network (ACN) is a platform that connects young African talent from ALA and the MasterCard Foundation Scholars Program to high-impact internship and job opportunities across the African continent.

== Global Advisory Council ==

The Global Advisory Council provides strategic input and guidance to the ALA management team.
