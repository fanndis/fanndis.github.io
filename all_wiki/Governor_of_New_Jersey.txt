The '''Governor of the State of New Jersey''' is head of the executive branch of [[Government of New Jersey|New Jersey's state government]]. The office of [[Governor (United States)|governor]] is an elected position, for which elected officials serve four-year terms. Governors cannot be elected to more than two ''consecutive'' terms, but there is no limit on the total number of terms they may serve.<ref name=FAQ>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nj.gov/faqs/gov/index.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}</ref> The official residence for the governor is [[Drumthwacket]], a mansion located in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]; the office of the governor is at the [[New Jersey State House]] in Trenton. 
The first Governor of New Jersey was [[William Livingston]], who served from August 31, 1776, to July 25, 1790. The current governor is [[Phil Murphy]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who assumed office on January 16, 2018.

==Role==
The governor is directly elected by the voters to become the political and ceremonial head of the state. The governor performs the [[executive (government)|executive]] functions of the state, and is not directly subordinate to the federal authorities. The governor assumes additional roles, such as being the [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs|New Jersey National Guard]] forces (when they are not federalized).

Unlike many other states that have elections for some [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]-level positions, under the [[Constitution of New Jersey|New Jersey Constitution]] the governor and [[Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey|lieutenant governor]] are the only officials elected on a statewide basis.  Much like the [[President of the United States]], the governor appoints the entire cabinet, subject to confirmation by the [[New Jersey Senate]].  More importantly, under the New Jersey constitution, the governor appoints all superior court judges and county prosecutors, although this is done with strong consideration of the preferences of the individual state senators who represent the district where vacancies arise.

The governor is also responsible for appointing two constitutionally created officers, the [[New Jersey Attorney General]] and the [[Secretary of State of New Jersey]], with the approval of the senate.<ref>[[Wikisource:New Jersey Constitution of 1947#SECTION IV 2]]</ref>

==Lieutenant governor==
{{Main|Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey}}
On Tuesday, November 8, 2005, the voters passed an amendment to the [[Constitution of New Jersey|New Jersey State Constitution]] that created the position of [[Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey]], effective with the [[New Jersey gubernatorial election, 2009|2009 elections]]. Before this amendment was passed, the [[President of the Senate|president of the]] [[New Jersey Senate]] would have become governor or acting governor in the event that office of governor became vacant. This dual position was more powerful than that of an elected governor, as the individual would have had a major role in legislative and executive processes. As a result of the constitutional amendment passed in 2005, Governor [[Richard Codey]], serving from November 2004 to January 2006 as governor, was the final person to wield such power.

[[Kim Guadagno]], a former prosecutor, was sworn in as New Jersey's first lieutenant governor on January 19, 2010 under Governor Christie. Succeeding Guadagno, former assemblywoman [[Sheila Oliver]] was sworn in on January 16, 2018 under Governor Murphy.

Currently, the program features extensive archives of documents and pictures from the Byrne and Kean administrations, video interviews with many members of the respective administrations, some information on other American governors, and news updates on current governors (of all 50 states). The project is in the process of creating new archives, similar to the Byrne and Kean archives, for later administrations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://governors.rutgers.edu/about.php|author=[[Eagleton Institute of Politics]]|title=About the Center on the American Governor|publisher=[[Rutgers University]]|location=[[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], USA|year=2011|work=Center on the [[Governor (United States)|American Governor]]|accessdate=November 10, 2011}}</ref>
