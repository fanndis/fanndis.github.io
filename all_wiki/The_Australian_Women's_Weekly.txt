==History and profile==
The magazine was started in 1933 by [[Frank Packer]] as a weekly publication. The first editor was [[George Warnecke]] and the initial dummy was laid out by [[William Edwin Pidgeon]] who went on to do many famous covers over the next 25 years.<ref>Spearritt, Peter (2012). [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/pidgeon-william-edwin-wep-15454 "Pidgeon, William Edwin (Wep) (1909–1981)"]. ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Vol. 18. Melbourne University Press. Online version Retrieved 29 September 2016.</ref> It was to have two distinctive features: firstly it would be a newspaper with an element of topicality in all its features.  Secondly it would be an attempt to appeal to all Australian women, regardless of class, and have a national focus. Wanting it to appeal to a mass audience, Warnecke hoped that it would be a material sign that Australia was coming out of the [[Great Depression in Australia|depression]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffen-Foley, Bridget, 1970-|title=Sir Frank Packer, the young master : a biography|date=2000|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-7322-6422-7|location=Sydney|pages=79|oclc=48945204}}</ref>

''The Weekly'' celebrated its 50th anniversary of publication in June 1983 and its 75th anniversary in the October 2008 issue. PBL launched ''Women's Weekly'' versions in Singapore and Malaysia, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, which follow ''The Weekly''{{'s}} style while containing largely local content.

In 2012 the parent company of the magazine, [[ACP Magazines]], a subsidiary of [[Nine Entertainment]], was acquired by the [[Bauer Media Group]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New ownership for ACP Magazines|url=http://www.nowtolove.com.au/news/latest-news/new-ownership-for-acp-magazines-5906|accessdate=18 February 2017|work=Now to Love|date=5 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219011727/http://www.nowtolove.com.au/news/latest-news/new-ownership-for-acp-magazines-5906|archive-date=19 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="smh"/>
Audited circulation under Nene King was 980,000. The 60th anniversary edition sold in excess of one-million. 
Audited circulation in June 2013 was 459,175 copies monthly.<ref>{{cite web |title=ABC CIRCULATION RESULTS - AUG 2013 |url=http://www.adnews.com.au/files/dmfile/ABC_circulation_Aug2013.pdf |website=Ad News |publisher=Ad News |accessdate=3 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222024522/http://www.adnews.com.au/files/dmfile/ABC_circulation_Aug2013.pdf |archive-date=22 February 2014 |date=August 2013}}</ref> Readership numbers for September 2014 were estimated to be 1,828,000.<ref name="roymorgan1">{{cite web |title=Australian Magazine Readership, 12 months to September 2014 |url=http://www.roymorgan.com/industries/media/readership/magazine-readership |publisher=[[Roy Morgan Research]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206093150/http://www.roymorgan.com:80/industries/media/readership/magazine-readership |archive-date=6 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

In mid-June 2020, the [[Sydney]]&ndash;based investment company [[Mercury Capital]] acquired the ''Australian Women's Weekly'' as part of its acquisition of Bauer Media's Australian and New Zealand magazine brands.<ref name="Mumbrella June 2020" /><ref name="AFR 19 June 2020" />

=== Cultural Impact ===
The overall popularity of the magazine between the 1930s-1980s meant that articles and advertisements published in it were widely read across [[Australia]], not only by women, but men as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=J|date=2013|title=Putting Dad in the Picture: Fatherhood in the Popular Women's Magazines of the 1950's Australia|journal=Women's History Review|volume=22|pages=901–929}}</ref> The magazines power to influence and shape culture across the nation intersected with the rise of various women’s and parenting issues. In review of issues published between the 1930s-1980s, historians have argued that Australian Women’s Weekly promoted school uniforms for children at a time when school uniforms were not mandatory across the country.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weaver|first=Heather|last2=Proctor|first2=Helen|date=May 2018|title=The Question of the Spotted Muumuu: How the Australian Women's Weekly Manufactured a Vision of the Normative School Mother and Child, 1930s–1980s|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0018268018000043/type/journal_article|journal=History of Education Quarterly|language=en|volume=58|issue=2|pages=229–260|doi=10.1017/heq.2018.4|issn=0018-2680}}</ref> This promotion, mainly through targeted coverage of school aged children, shaped views of motherhood and child-rearing throughout Australia. Publications in the magazine focused on products, children’s fashion, and celebrity children continue to shape readers views of motherhood and child-rearing.

==Format and frequency==
The magazine is usually 240 pages long and printed on glossy paper trimmed to [[A4 paper size|A4 page size]], although it was originally a Tabloid in size and layout.   It typically contains feature articles about the modern Australian woman. For many years, it included a lift-out TV guide.

In 1982, publication frequency was reduced from weekly to monthly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://researchdata.ands.org.au/australian-womenaposs-weekly-index/1305535/?refer_q=rows=15/sort=score%20desc/class=collection/p=1/q=australian%20womens%20weekly%20index/|title=Australian Women's Weekly Index|work=Research Data Australia|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en}}</ref> "Weekly" was retained in the name for reasons of familiarity and because a woman's "monthly" was a slang term for [[menstruation]]. The final weekly edition was dated 15 December 1982,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anna|first=Anisimova|date=2018-01-12|title=Australian Women's Weekly Index 1950-2011 v20180101|chapter=120307 Visual Communication Design (Incl.

The TV guide was discontinued on introduction of the monthly format.

=== Recipes and cookbooks ===
The Australian Women's Weekly Test Kitchen (then known as the Leila Howard Test Kitchen) was established just after World War I. From 1965, it continued to be on the same site of the [[ACP Magazines|Australian Consolidated Press]] (ACP) building (corner of Park and Castlereagh Streets) in Sydney. The Test Kitchen's first 'Best Ever' recipes compilation was published in 1976, collating the most-requested recipes from the issues of the Weekly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Food we love: favourite recipes from our test kitchen|publisher=ACP Publishing|year=2006|isbn=1863964770|location=Sydney|pages=7|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> The  cookbook sold out in days and had many reprints.<ref>{{Cite book|title=1000 best-ever recipes from AWW: the Australian women's weekly|publisher=ACP Books|year=2008|isbn=9781863968478|location=Sydney|pages=7|chapter=Introduction}}</ref>

The Test Kitchen had a team of 16 people in 2006, composed of chefs, home economists, food editors and support staff.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Food we love: favourite recipes from our test kitchen|publisher=ACP Publishing|year=2006|isbn=1863964770|location=Sydney|pages=16}}</ref>

In 2012, ACP was sold to Bauer Media Group. The Test Kitchen triple-tests recipes which are then published in the magazine, as well as Woman's Day and the AWW cookbooks. Surveys have shown that over 90 per cent of readers buy the magazine for the recipes.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Testing... Testing...|last=Hall|first=Necia|date=1 June 1999|work=The Age|page=1}}</ref>
