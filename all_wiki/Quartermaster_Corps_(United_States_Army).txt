The '''United States Army Quartermaster Corps''', formerly the '''Quartermaster Department''', is a [[Sustainment (military)|Sustainment]], formerly [[combat service support]] (CSS), branch of the [[United States Army]]. It is also one of three U.S. Army logistics branches, the others being the [[Transportation Corps]] and the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Corps]].

The U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps mission is to support the development, production, acquisition, and sustainment of general supply, [[Mortuary Affairs]], [[subsistence]]s, [[petroleum]] and [[water]], material and distribution management during peace and war to provide combat power to the U.S. Army. The officer in charge of the branch for doctrine, training, and professional development purposes is the [[Quartermaster General (United States)|Quartermaster General]].

The Quartermaster Corps is the U.S. Army's oldest logistics branch, established 16 June 1775. On that date, the [[Second Continental Congress]] passed a resolution providing for "one [[Quartermaster General]] of the grand army and a deputy, under him, for the separate army".  

In 1802 under President Thomas Jefferson the size of the US Army was reduced with the Quartermaster Department being disbanded.  In its place the nation was divided into three departments, each with its own agent and subordinates who were responsible for quartermaster functions within each Department<ref>p. 123 ''American Military History: The United States Army and the forging of a nation, 1775-1917'' Government Printing Office</ref>  The Quartermaster Corps was re-established in 1812.

From 1775 to 1912, this organization was known as the Quartermaster Department. In 1912, Congress consolidated the former Subsistence, Pay, and Quartermaster Departments to create the Quartermaster Corps. [[Quartermaster#United States Army|Quartermaster]] [[Military organization#Units, Formations & Commands|units]] and soldiers have served in every U.S. military operation from the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] to current operations in [[Iraq]] ([[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]]) and [[Afghanistan]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom]]).

==Insignia==
* The Regimental Insignia was authorized in 1986 and revised in 1994 to the current insignia.  The insignia is described as a gold color metal and enamel device 1 inch in height consisting of a gold eagle with wings spread and head lowered looking to his right and standing upon a wheel with a blue felloe set with thirteen gold stars, having thirteen gold spokes and the hub white with a red center; superimposed on the wheel a gold sword and key crossed diagonally hilt and bow up, all on a black background and resting upon a wreath of green laurel terminating at either side below the eagle's wings at the upper end of the sword and key. Attached below the device is a gold scroll inscribed ''SUPPORTING VICTORY'' in black. The original regimental insignia was all gold and approved on 31 March 1986. The design was changed on 7 June 1994 to add color to the insignia. The Regimental DUI is worn on the Soldier's right side above the name tag and any unit awards on the [[Army Service Uniform]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/Heraldry.aspx?HeraldryId=15359&CategoryId=9362&grp=2&menu=Uniformed |title=Services&ps=24&p=0 US Army Institute of Heraldry Quartermaster page |access-date=13 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113233311/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/Heraldry.aspx?HeraldryId=15359&CategoryId=9362&grp=2&menu=Uniformed |archive-date=13 January 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
* The Branch Insignia was approved in its present form in 1913.  The sword is characteristic of military forces and symbolized the Quartermaster Corps control of military supplies. The key is representative of the Corps traditional storekeeping function. The wheel is styled after a six-mule-wagon wheel and represents transportation and delivery of supplies. The wheel has thirteen spokes, a red and white hub and a blue felloe (the outer edge of the wheel) embedded with thirteen gilt (gold) stars. The thirteen stars and spokes of the wheel represent the original colonies and the origin of the Corps which occurred during the Revolutionary War. The gilt (gold) eagle is the national bird and is symbolic of our nation. The colors red, white and blue are the national colors.  The Branch Insignia is worn on the lapel of the [[Army Service Uniform]], singly on a brass disk for Enlisted personnel and in pairs for Officers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/Heraldry.aspx?HeraldryId=15359&CategoryId=9362&grp=2&menu=Uniformed |title=Services&ps=24&p=0 US Army Institute of Heraldry Quartermaster page |access-date=13 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113233311/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/Heraldry.aspx?HeraldryId=15359&CategoryId=9362&grp=2&menu=Uniformed |archive-date=13 January 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.qmfound.com/qm.html US Army Quartermaster Foundation]</ref>

==In the media==
The Quartermaster Corps provides a host of vital services to the U.S. Army. But, because these jobs are often not glamorous, very little is mentioned about Quartermaster soldiers in the mainstream media. The Global [[War on Terrorism]] and the 11 September attack on the Pentagon, as well as operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, have brought several Quartermasters briefly into the spotlight. Here are a few who have recently gained attention:

*MAJ Steve V. Long, a Quartermaster Officer who was serving as Secretary of the General Staff Office of the Commanding General US Total Army Personnel Command, was one of the casualties of the 11 September 2001 attack on the Pentagon.[http://www.091101memorial.org/Pentagon/Long.html]
*Members of the [[507th Maintenance Company]] which was ambushed at An Nasiriyah, Iraq, on 23 March 2003, during Operation Iraqi Freedom:
**[[Sergeant]] (SGT) [[Donald Walters]], killed in action – [[Silver Star]] recipient
**[[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] (SPC) Edgar Hernandez, captured
**SPC [[Shoshana Johnson]], captured
**[[Private First Class]] (PFC) [[Howard Johnson II]], killed in action
**PFC [[Jessica Lynch]], captured
**PFC [[Lori Piestewa]], killed in action
**[[Private (rank)|Private]] (PVT) [[Brandon Sloan]], killed in action
**PVT [[Ruben Estrella-Soto, Jr]], killed in action
*During [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]], the [[14th Quartermaster Detachment]], a [[U.S. Army Reserve]] unit from [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]], gained world-wide media exposure. The 14th suffered the greatest number of casualties of any allied unit in the war due to a [[SCUD]] [[missile]] attack on 25 February 1991.

|quote=

I am Quartermaster. My story is enfolded in the history of this nation. Sustainer of Armies...

My forges burned at Valley Forge. Down frozen, rutted roads my oxen hauled the meager foods a bankrupt Congress sent me... Scant rations for the cold and starving troops, gunpowder, salt, and lead.

In 1812 we sailed to war in ships my boatwrights built. I fought beside you in the deserts of our great Southwest. My pack mules perished seeking water holes, and I went on with camels. I gave flags to serve. The medals and crest you wear are my design.

Since 1862, I have sought our fallen brothers from Private to President. In war or peace I bring them home and lay them gently down in fields of honor.

Provisioner, transporter. In 1898 I took you to Havana harbor and the Philippines. I brought you tents, your khaki cloth for uniforms. When yellow fever struck, I brought the mattresses you lay upon.

In 1918, soldier... like you. Pearl Harbor, too. Mine was the first blood spilled that day. I jumped in darkness into Normandy, D-Day plus 1. Bataan, North Africa, Sicily. I was there. The 'chutes that filled the gray Korean skies were mine; I led the endless trains across the beach in Vietnam.

By air and sea I supported the fight for Grenada. Helicopters above the jungles of Panama carried my supplies. In Desert Storm, I was there when we crossed the border into Iraq...sustaining combat and paying the ultimate sacrifice as we liberated Kuwait.

I AM QUARTERMASTER.
I can shape the course of combat, change the outcome of battle. Look to me: Sustainer of Armies...Since 1775.

I AM QUARTERMASTER. I AM PROUD.
