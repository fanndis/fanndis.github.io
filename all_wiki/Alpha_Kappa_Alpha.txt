'''Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.''' ('''ΑΚΑ''') is the first historically [[African American]] [[Greek alphabet|Greek-lettered]] [[Fraternities and sororities|sorority]].<ref>[http://www.aka1908.com/membership/honorary-members.html Honorary Members]. Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019005421/http://www.aka1908.com/membership/honorary-members.html |date=October 19, 2012 }}</ref> The organization was founded on five basic tenets:

<blockquote>To cultivate and encourage high scholastic and ethical standards, to promote unity and friendship among college women, to study and help alleviate problems concerning girls and women in order to improve their social stature, to maintain a progressive interest in college life, and to be of 'Service to All Mankind'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://orgsync.com/114412/chapter|title=Alpha Kappa Alpha|website=orgsync.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710201223/https://orgsync.com/114412/chapter|archive-date=2018-07-10|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>

The sorority was founded on January 15, 1908, at the [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black]] [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], by a group of sixteen students led by [[Ethel Hedgeman Lyle]]. Forming a sorority broke barriers for African-American women in areas where they had little power or authority due to a lack of opportunities for minorities and women in the early 20th century.<ref>Tamara L. Brown, Gregory Parks, Clarenda M. Phillips, ''African American Fraternities and Sororities: The Legacy and the Vision''. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2005. p. 342</ref> Alpha Kappa Alpha was [[Corporation (university)|incorporated]] on January 29, 1913.

The sorority is one of the nation's largest Greek-letter organizations consisting of college-educated women of many diverse backgrounds from around the world, it serves through a membership of more than 300,000 women in 1,024 chapters in the United States and several other countries.<ref name=members/><ref>https://www.campusexplorer.com/college-advice-tips/9756A6EE/10-Largest-Sororities/</ref> Women may join through undergraduate chapters at a college or university or they may also join through a graduate chapter after acquiring an undergraduate or advanced college degree.<ref name=AKAint>{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.akainternational.org/main/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=34|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323174020/http://www.akainternational.org/main/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=34|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-03-23|title=Historical Overview|publisher=Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated.&nbsp;– International Region|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>

Since the organization's establishment, Alpha Kappa Alpha has helped to improve social and economic conditions through community service programs. Members have improved education through independent initiatives, contributed to community-building by creating programs and associations, such as the Mississippi Health Clinic, and influenced federal legislation by [[U.S. Congress|Congressional]] lobbying through the National Non-Partisan Lobby on Civil and Democratic Rights. The sorority works with communities through service initiatives and progressive programs relating to education, family, health, and business.

Alpha Kappa Alpha is part of the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] (NPHC). The current International President is Dr. [[Glenda Glover]] and the sorority's document and pictorial archives are located at [[Moorland-Spingarn Research Center]].

===Beginnings: 1907–1912===
In spring 1907, Ethel Hedgeman led efforts to create a sisterhood at Howard University. Howard faculty member, Ethel Robinson, encouraged Hedgeman by relating her own observances of sorority life at the Women's College at [[Brown University]], even though she was not a member of any sorority while a student at Brown.<ref name="Ross-166">Ross, Jr., ''The Divine Nine'', p. 166.</ref><ref name="delta">{{cite book |last=Giddings |first=Paula |title=In Search of Sisterhood: Delta Sigma Theta and the Challenge of the Black Sorority Movement |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] Publishers |year=1988 |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-688-13509-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/insearchofsister00gidd/page/44 44] |url=https://archive.org/details/insearchofsister00gidd/page/44 }}</ref> Hedgeman was also inspired by her mentors at Howard. To implement her idea, Hedgeman began recruiting interested classmates during the summer of 1907.<ref name="McNealey19">McNealey, E., ''Pearls of Service'', p. 19.</ref>

Eventually, nine women including Hedgeman were instrumental in organizing Alpha Kappa Alpha in the fall of 1907.<ref name=Ross-166/><ref name="McNealey19" /> With Hedgeman serving as the temporary chairperson,<ref name=delta /> the women wrote the sorority's constitution, devised the motto, chose the favorite colors, and named the sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha.<ref name=Ross-166 /> Later in 1908, seven sophomore [[honor student]]s expressed interest in joining and were accepted without initiation.<ref name=Ross-166 /><ref name="Parker12">Parker, M., ''Past is Prologue'', p. 12.</ref> The first initiation was held in a wing of Miner Hall on Howard University on February 11, 1909.<ref name=lambdaeta-1>{{cite web|date=2005-04-21 |url=http://www.msstate.edu/org/aka/n08.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129143342/http://www.msstate.edu/org/aka/n08.html |archivedate=2006-11-29 |title=History of AKA |publisher=Lambda Eta Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated |accessdate=2007-05-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=akatimeline>{{cite web |url=http://aka1908.com/centennial/pdf/timeline_pdf.pdf |format=PDF |title=Alpha Kappa Alpha Timeline |publisher=Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated |accessdate=2007-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630203447/http://aka1908.com/centennial/pdf/timeline_pdf.pdf |archive-date=2007-06-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On May 25, 1909, Alpha Kappa Alpha held its first "Ivy Week," a celebration that included planting ivy at Miner Hall.<ref name="VCU">{{cite web|url=http://www.studentorg.vcu.edu/thetarho/mowbray.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829161442/http://www.studentorg.vcu.edu/thetarho/mowbray.html |archivedate=2006-08-29 |title=Ethel Jones Mowbray |publisher=Theta Rho Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated |accessdate=2007-10-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Struggles and incorporation: 1912–1913===

Alpha Kappa Alpha continued to grow at Howard. By the end of the 1911–12 school year, there were more than twenty members of the sorority and the organization had become an influential part of student life at Howard.<ref>McNealey, E., ''Pearls of Service''.</ref> Following her graduation in 1912, while attending a meeting with current chapter members in October 1912,  former President Nellie Quander learned that all of the newly initiated members of the sorority planned to change the colors, letters, and constitution of the sorority.<ref>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/author-rohulamin-quander-writes-about-the-first-african-american-sorority-12625967/</ref> Quander actively worked with the women who had become ΑΚΑs during the four years of the sorority's existence to maintain the integrity and tenets of Alpha Kappa Alpha. On January 13, 1913, the members who wanted to transform Alpha Kappa Alpha left the organization and formed [[Delta Sigma Theta]]. Quander set up a three-person committee that successfully petitioned to incorporate ΑΚΑ as a perpetual entity. Alpha Kappa Alpha was nationally incorporated on January 29, 1913; the 1st African-American sorority to do so.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aka1908.com/centennial/pdf/quickfacts_pdf.pdf |title=Centennial Celebration Quick Facts |access-date=2014-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121150928/http://www.aka1908.com/centennial/pdf/quickfacts_pdf.pdf |archive-date=2015-01-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In April 1933, during the [[Great Depression]], International President Ida Jackson visited All Saints Industrial School in [[Lexington, Mississippi|Lexington]], [[Mississippi]]. She found difficult conditions in the [[Mississippi Delta]]. Some of the teachers did not have an education past the seventh grade.

On March 22, 2012, a forensic audit of Alpha Kappa Alpha's 2010 financial records revealed troubling concerns with past president, Barbara McKinzie's development and access to a "secret" bank account. The audit of the sorority led to findings that supported the claims in the previous lawsuit. The audit also found two former officials continued to use sorority credit cards after their service ended, failing to appropriately document charges. Another lawsuit against the organization, the former president McKinzie and other officials contained similar allegations. The audit found that McKinzie and the other officials secretly created a second set of financial books to get around the sorority's accounting policies. According to the audit, "(n)early $1.7 million in payments were made to the former president, Barbara McKinzie, without authorization. Approximately $282,000 in credit card charges on a second set of books appear to be fraudulent, including personal charges the sorority wasn't reimbursed for."<ref name="Audit pdf">[http://www.fileden.com/files/2007/7/31/1311456/Audit.pdf Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Information, Year Ended December 31, 2010.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225215259/http://www.fileden.com/files/2007/7/31/1311456/Audit.pdf |date=December 25, 2014 }}</ref> The sorority later expelled McKinzie<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aka1908.com/membership/expelled-members|title=Expelled and Revoked Members as of July 2016 (PDF)|last=|first=|date=|website=Alpha Kappa Alpha, Inc.|access-date=}}</ref> and won an arbitration award of $1.6 million against her, which (as of January 2017) was challenged by McKinzie in court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/511075753-ex-sorority-president-seeks-to-overturn-1-6m-arbitration-award-over-embezzlement-claims|title=Ex-sorority president seeks to overturn $1.6M arbitration award over embezzlement claims {{!}} Cook County Record|website=cookcountyrecord.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-28}}</ref>

===Sigma Chapter hazing death lawsuit===
On September 9, 2002, Kristin High (22) and Kenitha Saafir (24) from [[California State University, Los Angeles|California State University – Los Angeles]] (CSULA), died following an illegal hazing activity. The women were instructed by members of Alpha Kappa Alpha to perform a series of activities blindfolded on [[Dockweiler State Beach]] when a high tide came and eventually drowned both of them.  The next day when the women brought Kristin's car and cellphone to her mother, she noticed her pledge journal missing from the car and numbers deleted from her cellphone. Prior to Kristin's death, Kristin's mother encouraged her to fully disassociate herself with the sorority after Kristin discussed inappropriate behavior by members of AKA. A year after the incident, the families of the deceased settled with Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated after filing a $100 million civil [[wrongful death|wrongful death lawsuit]].

In a 2019 lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court of Illinois, the family of Jordan Hankins blames Alpha Kappa Alpha, Inc. for her 2017 [[suicide]].  Hankins was a sophomore basketball player at Northwestern University while pledging the sorority.  And while pledging, Hankins "was subjected to physical abuse including paddling, verbal abuse, mental abuse, financial exploitation, sleep deprivation, items being thrown and dumped on her, and other forms of hazing intended to humiliate and demean her," according to the lawsuit.  An official statement from Alpha Kappa Alpha, Inc. says the sorority is “deeply saddened” by Hankins’ death and declined to comment on the details of the complaint and her suicide due to the “sensitive nature” of the incident and “the ongoing grief her family is experiencing.”<ref>https://dailynorthwestern.com/2019/01/11/campus/alpha-kappa-alpha-sorority-headquarters-speaks-on-jordan-hankins-after-days-of-silence/</ref><ref>https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/10/us/jordan-hankins-northwestern-aka-sorority-lawsuit/index.html</ref><ref>https://dailynorthwestern.com/2019/01/09/campus/mother-of-jordan-hankins-claims-alpha-kappa-alpha-sorority-responsible-for-daughters-death/</ref>

In ''Our Kind of People: Inside America's Upper Class,'' [[Lawrence Otis Graham]] tells of his aunt's experience in joining the Ivy Leaf Pledge Club:

{{quote|We had to learn a lot more about the historic beginnings of the AKAs, and we did it by writing long letters of application to the Ivy Leaf Pledge Club—the senior wing of the sorority that regulated the admissions process—and then attending monthly meetings where the older students tutored us on the history.<ref name="log">{{cite book

In addition, according to Graham, the sorority would have "Pledge Week", a period where a candidate's grades and behavior were reviewed by chapter members. Candidates who withstood this period were initiated into the sorority.<ref name=log/> Membership interest is processed by an interest meeting, known as a "rush". After the candidate receives an official letter from the sorority, she can participate in the membership intake process. Prospective members must have a C+ average or better prior to their membership submission, as well as a record of community service. If a prospective member has graduated, she could be invited to join the sorority at the discretion of the graduate chapter.<ref name=prospective>{{cite web

====History and donations====
The foundation was the brainchild of Constance Holland, the sister of former Alpha Kappa Alpha International President Dr. Barbara Phillips, in 1978.  The foundation had official beginnings in 1980 and the sorority donated US$10,000 for the project. Eight years later, the organization first awarded $10,000 to fourteen students.  In 1991, EAF first awarded mini-grants to community organizations.  In 1998, EAF provided the first Youth Partners Accessing Capital (PAC) award to an undergraduate member.

At the organization's twentieth anniversary in 2000, EAF published ''Perpetuating Our Posterity: A Blueprint for Excellence.'' The book served as a comprehensive history of the organization and as a source of advice for other beginning philanthropies. EAF went online with a [[website]] in 2003.

The organization celebrated a silver anniversary in [[Nassau, Bahamas]], in 2005. EAF is incorporated into the International President's centennial program for funding under '''E'''xcellent '''S'''cholarly '''P'''erformance.

Partnerships in Mathematics and Science (PIMS) began in Eva Evans's administration in 1994, and was a part of the SPIRIT program during the [[Linda White]] administration.<ref name="mcnealey152">McNealey, E., ''Pearls of Service'', p. 152.</ref> Eva Evans mentioned the need for a math and science program, "As a college sorority, we've always advanced an educational agenda. We always had high GPA requirements.  And more than ever, we're pushing the importance of math and science for our girls.  We need more black women in those fields."<ref name="log2">Graham, L., ''Our Kind of People'', p. 91.</ref> The program's purpose is to increase the successes of youth in mathematics and science, as well as technology. Campaigns to highlight the program's importance were sponsored by the [[National Science Foundation]] and historically black colleges from across the country.<ref name="mcnealey152"/> Several chapters provided two-week math and science summer camps on college and day school campuses, which consisted of hands-on-learning through laboratory interactions, field trips to important sites, youth camps, and speeches from influential experts in specific areas of studies.<ref name=programs/><ref name="McNealey153"/> For example, a PIMS program at Park Street Elementary School in [[Marietta, Georgia]], consisted of third through fifth grade girls and provided educational field trips in order to stimulate involvement in math and science.<ref name=NI/><ref name=marietta>{{cite web

===Young Authors Program===
In Linda White's administrations, the Young Authors Program was born.  The purpose of the program is to encourage and raise involvement in reading and writing in kindergarten through third grade school children. Each of the ten regions in the sorority had the opportunity to choose a child's story to be published in a two volume anthology entitled, ''The Spirit Within: Voices of Young Authors''.<ref name=programs/> In 2004, twenty children were honored in the first anthology.<ref name=Jet>{{cite news

On July 15, 2004, First Lady [[Laura Bush]] spoke on the Ivy AKAdemy's dedication to reading initiatives, "Teaching our children to read is the most critical educational priority facing our country. Children who do not learn to read by third grade continue to find reading a challenge throughout their lives. These expectations increase in amount and complexity each year."<ref name=Jet/><ref name=LauraBush>{{cite web |date=2004-07-15|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/07/20040715-11.html|title=
