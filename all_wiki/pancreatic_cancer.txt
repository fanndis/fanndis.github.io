<!-- Definition and types -->
'''Pancreatic cancer''' arises when [[cell (biology)|cells]] in the [[pancreas]], a glandular organ behind the [[stomach]], begin to multiply out of control and form a [[Neoplasm|mass]].

==Types==
[[File:2424 Exocrine and Endocrine Pancreas.jpg|thumb|320px|The pancreas has many functions, served by the endocrine cells in the [[islets of Langerhans]] and the exocrine [[acinar cell]]s. Pancreatic cancer may arise from any of these and disrupt any of their functions.]]
The many types of pancreatic cancer can be divided into two general groups. The vast majority of cases (about 95%) occur in the part of the pancreas that produces [[digestive enzymes]], known as the [[Exocrine component of pancreas|exocrine component]]. Several subtypes of exocrine pancreatic cancers are described, but their diagnosis and treatment have much in common.  The small minority of cancers that arise in the [[hormone]]-producing ([[endocrine]]) tissue of the pancreas have different clinical characteristics and are called [[pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor]]s, sometimes abbreviated as "PanNETs". Both groups occur mainly (but not exclusively) in people over 40, and are slightly more common in men, but some rare subtypes mainly occur in women or children.<ref name=Harris-2013>{{cite book| vauthors = Harris RE | title=Epidemiology of Chronic Disease| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJLEIvX4wzoC&pg=PA182| year=2013| publisher=Jones & Bartlett| isbn=978-0-7637-8047-0| pages=181–190| chapter=Epidemiology of pancreatic cancer| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624065516/https://books.google.com/books?id=KJLEIvX4wzoC&pg=PA182| archive-date=24 June 2016| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=pmid22997445>{{cite journal | vauthors = Öberg K, Knigge U, Kwekkeboom D, Perren A | collaboration = ESMO Guidelines Working Group | title = Neuroendocrine gastro-entero-pancreatic tumors: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up | journal = Annals of Oncology | volume = 23 Suppl 7 | issue = suppl 7 | pages = vii124-30 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22997445 | doi = 10.1093/annonc/mds295 | doi-access = free }} ([http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/suppl_7/vii124/T5.expansion.html Table 5] outlines the proposed TNM staging system for PanNETs.)</ref>

===Exocrine cancers===
The exocrine group is dominated by pancreatic [[adenocarcinoma]] (variations of this name may add "invasive" and "ductal"), which is by far the most common type, representing about 85% of all pancreatic cancers.<ref name="NEJM14" /> Nearly all these start in the ducts of the pancreas, as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Pancreatic Cancer|date=2009|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-77497-8|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NmBB5ZoKkk4C&pg=PA288|access-date=12 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910175002/https://books.google.com/books?id=NmBB5ZoKkk4C&pg=PA288|archive-date=10 September 2017}}</ref> This is despite the fact that the tissue from which it arises – the pancreatic ductal [[epithelium]] – represents less than 10% of the pancreas by cell volume, because it constitutes only the ducts (an extensive but capillary-like duct-system fanning out) within the pancreas.<ref name="DeVita2011">{{cite book|author= Govindan R |title=DeVita, Hellman, and Rosenberg's Cancer: Cancer: Principles & Practice of Oncology |edition=9th |date=2011|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-1-4511-0545-2|at= Chapter 35: Cancer of the Pancreas: Surgical Management}} Online edition, with updates to 2014</ref>  This cancer originates in the ducts that carry secretions (such as [[enzymes]] and [[bicarbonate]]) away from the pancreas. About 60–70% of adenocarcinomas occur in the [[Pancreas#Structure|head of the pancreas]].<ref name="NEJM14" />

The next-most common type, [[acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas]], arises in the [[Acinus|clusters of cells]] that produce these enzymes, and represents 5% of exocrine pancreas cancers.<ref name="Tobias">{{cite book |vauthors=Tobias JS, Hochhauser D |title= Cancer and its Management |page=297 |year= 2014 |edition= 7th |isbn=  978-1-118-46871-5}}</ref> Like the 'functioning' endocrine cancers described below, acinar cell carcinomas may cause over-production of certain molecules, in this case digestive enzymes, which may cause symptoms such as skin rashes and joint pain.

[[Cystadenocarcinoma]]s account for 1% of pancreatic cancers, and they have a better prognosis than the other exocrine types.<ref name="Tobias" />

[[Pancreatoblastoma]] is a rare form, mostly occurring in childhood, and with a relatively good prognosis.  Other exocrine cancers include [[adenosquamous carcinoma]]s, [[signet ring cell carcinoma]]s, [[hepatoid carcinoma]]s, colloid carcinomas, [[Anaplasia|undifferentiated]] carcinomas, and undifferentiated carcinomas with [[osteoclast]]-like [[giant cell]]s. [[Solid pseudopapillary tumor]] is a rare low-[[Grading (tumors)|grade]] neoplasm that mainly affects younger women, and generally has a very good prognosis.<ref name="NEJM14" /><ref name="JHM-SGPCRC">{{cite web |publisher= Johns Hopkins Medicine |website= The Sol Goldman Pancreas Cancer Research Center |url= http://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/BasicTypes2.php?area=ba |title= Types of Pancreas Tumors |date= 2012 |access-date= 18 November 2014 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141008022815/http://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/BasicTypes2.php?area=ba |archive-date= 8 October 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

[[Pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasm]]s are a broad group of pancreas tumors that have varying malignant potential.

===Neuroendocrine===
{{main|Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor}}
The small minority of tumors that arise elsewhere in the pancreas are mainly [[pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor]]s (PanNETs).<ref name=nomenclature>The PanNET denomination is in line with [[WHO]] guidelines for the classification of tumors of the digestive system {{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/101553728 |title=WHO classification of tumours of the digestive system – NLM Catalog – NCBI |access-date=7 September 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909110134/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/101553728 |archive-date=9 September 2017  }} published in 2010. Historically, PanNETs have also been referred to by a variety of terms, and are still commonly called "pancreatic endocrine tumors". See: {{cite journal | vauthors = Klimstra DS, Modlin IR, Coppola D, Lloyd RV, Suster S | title = The pathologic classification of neuroendocrine tumors: a review of nomenclature, grading, and staging systems | journal = Pancreas | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 707–12 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20664470 | doi = 10.1097/MPA.0b013e3181ec124e | s2cid = 3735444 }}<!-- likely to remain a valid source for nomenclature until the 2010 WHO classification of digestive system tumors is superseded --></ref> [[Neuroendocrine tumor]]s (NETs) are a diverse group of [[Benign tumor#Benign vs malignant|benign or malignant]] tumors that arise from the body's [[neuroendocrine cell]]s, which are responsible for integrating the [[Nervous system|nervous]] and endocrine systems. NETs can start in most organs of the body, including the pancreas, where the various malignant types are all considered to be [[Rare disease|rare]].  PanNETs are grouped into 'functioning' and 'nonfunctioning' types, depending on the degree to which they produce hormones. The functioning types secrete hormones such as [[insulin]], [[gastrin]], and [[glucagon]] into the bloodstream, often in large quantities, giving rise to serious symptoms such as [[low blood sugar]], but also favoring relatively early detection. The most common functioning PanNETs are [[insulinoma]]s and [[gastrinoma]]s, named after the hormones they secrete. The nonfunctioning types do not secrete hormones in a sufficient quantity to give rise to overt clinical symptoms, so nonfunctioning PanNETs are often diagnosed only after the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.<ref name="Burns2012"/>

As with other neuroendocrine tumors, the history of the terminology and classification of PanNETs is complex.<ref name=nomenclature/> PanNETs are sometimes called "islet cell cancers",<ref>The [[Medical Subject Headings]] indexing system refers to "islet cell carcinoma", which is subdivided into gastrinoma, [[glucagonoma]], [[somatostatinoma]], and [[VIPoma]].

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Jaundice08.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.3|[[Jaundice]] can be a symptom, due to [[bile duct|biliary]] obstruction from a pancreatic tumor.]]
Since pancreatic cancer usually does not cause recognizable symptoms in its early stages, the disease is typically not diagnosed until it has spread beyond the pancreas itself.<ref name="Lancet">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vincent A, Herman J, Schulick R, Hruban RH, Goggins M | title = Pancreatic cancer | journal = Lancet | volume = 378 | issue = 9791 | pages = 607–20 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21620466 | pmc = 3062508 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62307-0 | url = http://m-learning.zju.edu.cn/G2S/eWebEditor/uploadfile/20111127193405_869876397245.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150112190623/http://m-learning.zju.edu.cn/G2S/eWebEditor/uploadfile/20111127193405_869876397245.pdf | df = dmy-all | archive-date = 12 January 2015 }}</ref>  This is one of the main reasons for the generally poor survival rates. Exceptions to this are the functioning PanNETs, where over-production of various active hormones can give rise to symptoms (which depend on the type of hormone).<ref name="Sol PanNET" />

Bearing in mind that the disease is rarely diagnosed before the age of 40, common symptoms of pancreatic adenocarcinoma occurring before diagnosis include:
* [[Abdominal pain|Pain in the upper abdomen]] or back, often spreading from around the stomach to the back. The location of the pain can indicate the part of the pancreas where a tumor is located. The pain may be worse at night and may increase over time to become severe and unremitting.<ref name=Tobias/> It may be slightly relieved by bending forward. In the UK, about half of new cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed following a visit to a hospital emergency department for pain or jaundice. In up to two-thirds of people, abdominal pain is the main symptom, for 46% of the total accompanied by jaundice, with 13% having jaundice without pain.<ref name="Bond-Smith"/>
* [[Jaundice]], a yellow tint to the [[sclera|whites of the eyes]] or skin, with or without pain, and possibly in combination with darkened urine, results when a cancer in the head of the pancreas obstructs the [[common bile duct]] as it runs through the pancreas.<ref name="Cruz" />
* [[Cachexia|Unexplained weight loss]], either from [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], or loss of exocrine function resulting in [[Dyspepsia|poor digestion]].<ref name="Bond-Smith" />
* The tumor may compress neighboring organs, disrupting digestive processes and making it difficult for the [[stomach]] to empty, which may cause [[nausea]] and a feeling of fullness. The undigested fat leads to foul-smelling, [[Steatorrhea|fatty feces]] that are difficult to flush away.<ref name="Bond-Smith" /> [[Constipation]] is also common.<ref name=Alberts/>
* At least 50% of people with pancreatic adenocarcinoma have [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] at the time of diagnosis.<ref name="NEJM14"/> While long-standing diabetes is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer (see [[#Risk factors|Risk factors]]), the cancer can itself cause diabetes, in which case recent onset of diabetes could be considered an early sign of the disease.<ref name=Pannala2009>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pannala R, Basu A, Petersen GM, Chari ST | title = New-onset diabetes: a potential clue to the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer | journal = The Lancet.

===Other findings===
* [[Trousseau sign of malignancy|Trousseau's syndrome]], in which blood clots form spontaneously in the [[portal venous system|portal blood vessels]], the deep veins of the extremities, or the superficial veins anywhere on the body, may be associated with pancreatic cancer, and is found in about 10% of cases.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/>
* [[Clinical depression]] has been reported in association with pancreatic cancer in some 10–20% of cases, and can be a hindrance to optimal management.  The depression sometimes appears before the diagnosis of cancer, suggesting that it may be brought on by the biology of the disease.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/>

Other common manifestations of the disease include weakness and tiring easily, [[Xerostomia|dry mouth]], sleep problems, and a [[Palpation|palpable]] [[abdominal mass]].<ref name=Alberts>{{cite book | vauthors = Alberts SR, Goldberg RM | veditors = Casciato DA, Territo MC |title=Manual of clinical oncology|date=2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-6884-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/manualofclinical00casc_0/page/188 188–236]|ref=Alberts|chapter=Chapter 9: Gastrointestinal tract cancers|chapter-url-access=registration|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/manualofclinical00casc_0|url=https://archive.org/details/manualofclinical00casc_0/page/188}}</ref>

===Symptoms of spread===
[[File:Secondary tumor deposits in the liver from a primary cancer of the pancreas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Cross-section of a human [[liver]], at [[autopsy]], showing many large pale tumor deposits, that are [[metastasis|secondary tumors]] derived from pancreatic cancer]]
The spread of pancreatic cancer to other organs ([[cancer metastasis|metastasis]]) may also cause symptoms. Typically, pancreatic adenocarcinoma first spreads to nearby [[lymph node]]s, and later to the [[liver]] or to the [[peritoneal cavity]], [[large intestine]], or lungs.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/> Uncommonly, it spreads to the bones or brain.<ref name="AJCC2-PANC">{{cite book |title= Manual for Staging of Cancer |publisher= American Joint Committee on Cancer |edition= 2nd |chapter= Chapter 15; Pancreas |pages= 95–98 |chapter-url= https://cancerstaging.org/references-tools/deskreferences/Documents/AJCC2ndEdCancerStagingManual.pdf |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023729/https://cancerstaging.org/references-tools/deskreferences/Documents/AJCC2ndEdCancerStagingManual.pdf |archive-date= 29 November 2014 |df= dmy-all }} See p. 95 for citation regarding "...&nbsp;lesser degree of involvement of bones and brain and other anatomical sites."</ref>

Cancers in the pancreas may also be [[secondary cancer]]s that have spread from other parts of the body.  This is uncommon, found in only about 2% of cases of pancreatic cancer. [[Kidney cancer]] is by far the most common cancer to spread to the pancreas, followed by [[colorectal cancer]], and then cancers of the [[melanoma|skin]], [[breast cancer|breast]], and [[lung cancer|lung]].  Surgery may be performed on the pancreas in such cases, whether in hope of a cure or to alleviate symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sperti C, Moletta L, Patanè G | title = Metastatic tumors to the pancreas: The role of surgery | journal = World Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = 381–92 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25320654 | pmc = 4197429 | doi = 10.4251/wjgo.v6.i10.381 }}</ref>

:Pancreatic cancer has been associated with these other rare hereditary syndromes: [[Peutz–Jeghers syndrome]]  due to mutations in the ''[[STK11]]'' [[tumor suppressor gene]] (very rare, but a very strong risk factor); [[dysplastic nevus syndrome]] (or familial atypical multiple mole and melanoma syndrome, FAMMM-PC) due to mutations in the ''[[p16|CDKN2A]]'' tumor suppressor gene; [[autosomal recessive]] [[ataxia-telangiectasia]] and autosomal dominantly inherited mutations in the ''[[BRCA2]]'' and ''[[PALB2]]'' genes; [[hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer]] (Lynch syndrome); and [[familial adenomatous polyposis]].

===Alcohol===
Drinking alcohol excessively is a major cause of [[chronic pancreatitis]], which in turn predisposes to pancreatic cancer, but considerable research has failed to firmly establish alcohol consumption as a direct risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Overall, the association is consistently weak and the majority of studies have found no association, with smoking a strong [[confounding]] factor.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Pancreas adenocarcinoma (4) Case 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (the most common type of pancreatic cancer), [[H&E stain]]]]

===Precancer===

[[File:Pancreas neoplasia carcinoma sequence.png|thumb|[[Micrograph]]s of normal pancreas, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (precursors to pancreatic carcinoma) and pancreatic carcinoma. [[H&E stain]]]]

Exocrine cancers are thought to arise from several types of [[precancer]]ous [[lesion]]s within the pancreas, but these lesions do not always progress to cancer, and the increased numbers detected as a byproduct of the increasing use of CT scans for other reasons are not all treated.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/>  Apart from [[pancreatic serous cystadenoma]]s, which are almost always benign, four types of precancerous lesion are recognized.

The first is pancreatic [[intraepithelial neoplasia]]. These lesions are microscopic abnormalities in the pancreas and are often found in [[autopsy|autopsies]] of people with no diagnosed cancer. These lesions may progress from [[cancer grading|low to high grade]] and then to a tumor. More than 90% of cases at all grades carry a faulty ''[[KRAS]]'' gene, while in grades&nbsp;2 and 3, damage to three further genes&nbsp;– ''[[p16|CDKN2A]]'' (''p16''), ''[[p53]]'', and ''[[SMAD4]]''&nbsp;– are increasingly often found.<ref name="NEJM14"/>

A second type is the [[intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm]] (IPMN). These are macroscopic lesions, which are found in about 2% of all adults. This rate rises to about 10% by age 70. These lesions have about a 25% risk of developing into invasive cancer. They may have ''KRAS'' gene mutations (40–65% of cases) and in the GNAS [[Gs alpha subunit]] and RNF43, affecting the [[Wnt signaling pathway]].<ref name="NEJM14"/> Even if removed surgically,  a considerably increased risk remains  of pancreatic cancer developing subsequently.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/>

The third type, [[pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasm]] (MCN), mainly occurs in women, and may remain benign or progress to cancer.<ref name=Delpu2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Delpu Y, Hanoun N, Lulka H, Sicard F, Selves J, Buscail L, Torrisani J, Cordelier P | display-authors = 6 | title = Genetic and epigenetic alterations in pancreatic carcinogenesis | journal = Current Genomics | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–24 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21886451 | pmc = 3129039 | doi = 10.2174/138920211794520132 }}</ref> If these lesions become large, cause symptoms, or have suspicious features, they can usually be successfully removed by surgery.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/>

A fourth type of cancer that arises in the pancreas is the intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm. This type was recognised by the WHO in 2010 and constitutes about 1–3% of all pancreatic neoplasms.  Mean age at diagnosis is 61 years (range 35–78 years). About 50% of these lesions become invasive. Diagnosis depends on histology, as these lesions are very difficult to differentiate from other lesions on either clinical or radiological grounds.<ref name=Rooney2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rooney SL, Shi J | title = Intraductal Tubulopapillary Neoplasm of the Pancreas: An Update From a Pathologist's Perspective | journal = Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine | volume = 140 | issue = 10 | pages = 1068–73 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27684978 | doi = 10.5858/arpa.2016-0207-RA | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Invasive cancer===

The genetic events found in ductal adenocarcinoma have been well characterized, and complete [[exome sequencing]] has been done for the common types of tumor. Four genes have each been found to be mutated in the majority of adenocarcinomas: ''KRAS'' (in 95% of cases), ''[[CDKN2A]]'' (also in 95%), ''[[TP53]]'' (75%), and ''SMAD4'' (55%).  The last of these is especially associated with a poor prognosis.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/>  ''[[SWI/SNF]]'' mutations/[[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]] occur in about 10–15% of the adenocarcinomas.<ref name=NEJM14/>  The genetic alterations in several other types of pancreatic cancer and precancerous lesions have also been researched.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/> Transcriptomics analyses and mRNA sequencing for the common forms of pancreatic cancer have found that 75% of human genes are [[Gene expression|expressed]] in the tumors, with some 200 genes more specifically expressed in pancreatic cancer as compared to other tumor types.<ref name="proteinatlas.org">{{Cite web|url=https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanpathology/pancreatic+cancer|title=The human pathology proteome in pancreatic cancer – The Human Protein Atlas|website=www.proteinatlas.org|access-date=28 September 2017}}</ref><ref name="Uhlen eaan2507">{{cite journal | vauthors = Uhlen M, Zhang C, Lee S, Sjöstedt E, Fagerberg L, Bidkhori G, Benfeitas R, Arif M, Liu Z, Edfors F, Sanli K, von Feilitzen K, Oksvold P, Lundberg E, Hober S, Nilsson P, Mattsson J, Schwenk JM, Brunnström H, Glimelius B, Sjöblom T, Edqvist PH, Djureinovic D, Micke P, Lindskog C, Mardinoglu A, Ponten F | display-authors = 6 | title = A pathology atlas of the human cancer transcriptome | journal = Science | volume = 357 | issue = 6352 | pages = eaan2507 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28818916 | doi = 10.1126/science.aan2507 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Regardless of a tumor's location, the most common symptom is unexplained weight loss, which may be considerable. A large minority (between 35% and 47%) of people diagnosed with the disease will have had nausea, vomiting, or a feeling of weakness.  Tumors in the head of the pancreas typically also cause jaundice, pain, [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], dark urine, and light-colored stools. Tumors in the body and tail typically also cause pain.<ref name="Cruz" />

People sometimes have recent onset of atypical type 2 diabetes that is difficult to control, a history of recent but unexplained blood vessel inflammation caused by blood clots ([[thrombophlebitis]]) known as [[Trousseau sign of malignancy|Trousseau sign]], or a previous attack of [[pancreatitis]].<ref name="Cruz" /> A doctor may suspect pancreatic cancer when the onset of diabetes in someone over 50 years old is accompanied by typical symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, persistent abdominal or back pain, indigestion, vomiting, or fatty feces.<ref name="Bond-Smith" /> Jaundice accompanied by a painlessly swollen [[gallbladder]] (known as [[Courvoisier's law|Courvoisier's sign]]) may also raise suspicion, and can help [[differential diagnosis|differentiate]] pancreatic cancer from [[gallstone]]s.<ref name="Fitzgerald-2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fitzgerald JE, White MJ, Lobo DN | title = Courvoisier's gallbladder: law or sign? | journal = World Journal of Surgery | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 886–91 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19190960 | doi = 10.1007/s00268-008-9908-y | s2cid = 21799234 }}</ref>

[[Medical imaging]] techniques, such as [[computed tomography]] (CT scan) and [[endoscopic ultrasound]] (EUS) are used both to confirm the diagnosis and to help decide whether the tumor can be surgically removed (its "[[Resection (surgery)|resectability]]").<ref name="Bond-Smith" /> On [[CT scan#Contrast|contrast CT scan]], pancreatic cancer typically shows a gradually increasing radiocontrast uptake, rather than a fast washout as seen in a normal pancreas or a delayed washout as seen in chronic pancreatitis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Piraka C, Scheiman JM | title = New diagnostic imaging modalities for pancreatic disease | journal = Current Opinion in Gastroenterology | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 475–80 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21743318 | doi = 10.1097/MOG.0b013e328349e30c | s2cid = 38963685 }}</ref> [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[positron emission tomography]] may also be used,<ref name="NEJM14" /> and [[magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography]] may be useful in some cases.<ref name="Cruz" /> [[Abdominal ultrasound]] is less sensitive and will miss small tumors, but can identify cancers that have spread to the liver and build-up of fluid in the peritoneal cavity ([[ascites]]).<ref name="Bond-Smith" />  It may be used for a quick and cheap first examination before other techniques.<ref name="ESMOPA" />

The disorganization, nuclear overlapping, and lack of uniform nuclear spacing provides a clue that is this adenocarcinoma (as opposed to non-neoplastic duct epithelium).]]
A biopsy by [[fine needle aspiration]], often guided by endoscopic ultrasound, may be used where there is uncertainty over the diagnosis, but a [[Histology|histologic]] diagnosis is not usually required for removal of the tumor by surgery to go ahead.<ref name="Bond-Smith" />

[[Liver function test]]s can show a combination of results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised [[conjugated bilirubin]], [[Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase|γ-glutamyl transpeptidase]] and [[alkaline phosphatase]] levels). [[CA19-9]] (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a [[tumor marker]] that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks [[sensitivity and specificity]], not least because 5% of people lack the [[Lewis antigen system|Lewis (a) antigen]] and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.<ref name="NEJM14" /><ref name="Bond-Smith"/>

===Histopathology===
The most common form of pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma) is typically characterized by moderately to [[Anaplasia|poorly differentiated]] glandular structures on microscopic examination. There is typically considerable [[desmoplasia]] or formation of a dense fibrous [[Stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]] or structural tissue consisting of a range of [[cell type]]s (including [[myofibroblast]]s, [[macrophage]]s, [[lymphocyte]]s and [[mast cell]]s) and deposited material (such as [[type I collagen]] and [[hyaluronic acid]]).  This creates a [[tumor microenvironment]] that is short of [[blood vessel]]s (hypovascular) and so of [[oxygen]] ([[tumor hypoxia]]).<ref name="NEJM14" />  It is thought that this prevents many chemotherapy drugs from reaching the tumor, as one factor making the cancer especially hard to treat.<ref name="NEJM14" /><ref name="Wolfgang2013"/>

===Staging===

====Exocrine cancers====
Pancreatic cancer is usually [[cancer staging|stage]]d following a [[CT scan]].<ref name="Cruz" />  The most widely used cancer staging system for pancreatic cancer is the one formulated by the [[American Joint Committee on Cancer]] (AJCC) together with the [[Union for International Cancer Control]] (UICC).<!-- ref: Cascinu-2010 --> The AJCC-UICC staging system designates four main overall stages, ranging from early to advanced disease, based on [[TNM staging system|TNM classification]] of '''T'''umor size, spread to lymph '''N'''odes, and '''M'''etastasis.<ref name=Cascinu-2010>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cascinu S, Falconi M, Valentini V, Jelic S | title = Pancreatic cancer: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up | journal = Annals of Oncology | volume = 21 Suppl 5 | issue = Supplement 5 | pages = v55-8 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20555103 | doi = 10.1093/annonc/mdq165 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

To help decide treatment, the tumors are also divided into three broader categories based on whether surgical removal seems possible: in this way, tumors are judged to be "resectable", "borderline resectable", or "unresectable".<ref name="cancer.org">{{cite web|title=Staging of pancreatic cancer |url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreaticcancer/detailedguide/pancreatic-cancer-pdf |website=American Cancer Society|date= 11 June 2014 |access-date=29 September 2014}}</ref> When the disease is still in an early stage (AJCC-UICC stages I and II), without spread to large blood vessels or distant organs such as the liver or lungs, surgical resection of the tumor can normally be performed, if the patient is willing to undergo this major operation and is thought to be sufficiently fit.<ref name="Bond-Smith" /> The AJCC-UICC staging system allows distinction between stage III tumors that are judged to be "borderline resectable" (where surgery is technically feasible because the [[celiac axis]] and [[superior mesenteric artery]] are still free) and those that are "unresectable" (due to more locally advanced disease); in terms of the more detailed TNM classification, these two groups correspond to T3 and T4 respectively.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/>

Locally advanced adenocarcinomas have spread into neighboring organs, which may be any of the following (in roughly decreasing order of frequency): the [[duodenum]], [[stomach]], [[transverse colon]], [[spleen]], [[adrenal gland]], or [[kidney]]. Very often they also spread to the important blood or [[lymphatic vessel]]s and nerves that run close to the pancreas, making surgery far more difficult. Typical sites for metastatic spread (stage IV disease) are the liver, peritoneal cavity and [[lung]]s, all <!-- request clarification: "all" (ie all three together) or "each"? --> of which occur in 50% or more of fully advanced cases.<ref name="Silberman2010">{{cite book|editor1-last=Silberman |editor1-first=Howard |editor2-last=Silberman |editor2-first=Allan W. |last1=Zyromski |first1=Nicholas J. |last2=Nakeeb |first2=Attila |last3=Lillemoe |first3=Keith D. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Principles and practice of surgical oncology : multidisciplinary approach to difficult problems |date=2010 |publisher=Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-7817-6546-6 |at=Chapter 35 |edition=online |url=http://lwwoncology.com/Textbook/Toc.aspx?id=11008 |access-date=3 November 2014 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206115602/http://lwwoncology.com/Textbook/Toc.aspx?id=11008 |archive-date=6 February 2015 }}</ref>

====PanNETs====
The 2010 WHO classification of tumors of the digestive system grades all the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) into three categories, based on their degree of [[cellular differentiation]] (from "NET G1" through to the poorly differentiated "NET G3").<ref name=pmid22997445/> The U.S. [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]] recommends use of the same AJCC-UICC staging system as pancreatic adenocarcinoma.<ref name="NCCN_NET201501"/>{{rp|52}} Using this scheme, the stage-by-stage outcomes for PanNETs are dissimilar to those of the exocrine cancers.<ref name="NCI_FIG1">National Cancer Institute.

==Prevention and screening==
Apart from not smoking, the [[American Cancer Society]] recommends keeping a healthy weight, and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and [[whole grain]]s, while decreasing consumption of red and [[processed meat]], although there is no consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically.<ref>{{cite web|title=Diet and activity factors that affect risks for certain cancers: Pancreatic cancer section|url=http://www.cancer.org/healthy/eathealthygetactive/acsguidelinesonnutritionphysicalactivityforcancerprevention/acs-guidelines-on-nutrition-and-physical-activity-for-cancer-prevention-dietand-activity|website=[[American Cancer Society]]|date=20 August 2012|access-date=4 November 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104234940/http://www.cancer.org/healthy/eathealthygetactive/acsguidelinesonnutritionphysicalactivityforcancerprevention/acs-guidelines-on-nutrition-and-physical-activity-for-cancer-prevention-dietand-activity|archive-date=4 November 2014}}</ref> A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of [[citrus fruit]]s and [[curcumin]] reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, [[folate]], [[selenium]], and non-fried fish.<ref name="Pericleous" />

==Management==

===Exocrine cancer===
A key assessment that is made after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see [[#Staging|Staging]]), as this is the only cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/>

Chemotherapy and, to a lesser extent, radiotherapy are likely to be offered to most people, whether or not surgery is possible. Specialists advise that the management of pancreatic cancer should be in the hands of a [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary team]] including specialists in several aspects of [[oncology]], and is, therefore, best conducted in larger centers.<ref name="NEJM14" /><ref name="Wolfgang2013"/>

====Surgery====
[[File:Diagram showing the parts removed with a Whipple's operation CRUK 337.svg|thumb|Parts of the body removed in Whipple's operation]]

Surgery with the intention of a cure is only possible in around one-fifth (20%) of new cases.<ref name="Bond-Smith" />  Although CT scans help, in practice it can be difficult to determine whether the tumor can be fully removed (its "resectability"), and it may only become apparent during surgery that it is not possible to successfully remove the tumor without damaging other vital tissues. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on various factors, including the precise extent of local anatomical adjacency to, or involvement of, the [[vein|venous]] or [[artery|arterial]] blood vessels,<ref name="NEJM14" /> as well as surgical expertise and a careful consideration of projected post-operative recovery.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gurusamy KS, Kumar S, Davidson BR, Fusai G | title = Resection versus other treatments for locally advanced pancreatic cancer | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = CD010244 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24578248 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010244.pub2 }}</ref><ref name="Mollberg2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mollberg N, Rahbari NN, Koch M, Hartwig W, Hoeger Y, Büchler MW, Weitz J | title = Arterial resection during pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Annals of Surgery | volume = 254 | issue = 6 | pages = 882–93 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22064622 | doi = 10.1097/SLA.0b013e31823ac299 | s2cid = 42685174 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/16000db7fb7c0acf022968a09cfece839fa3444f }}</ref> The age of the person is not in itself a reason not to operate, but their general [[performance status]] needs to be adequate for a major operation.<ref name="Bond-Smith" />

One particular feature that is evaluated is the encouraging presence, or discouraging absence, of a clear layer or plane of fat creating a barrier between the tumor and the vessels.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/>  Traditionally, an assessment is made of the tumor's proximity to major venous or arterial vessels, in terms of "abutment" (defined as the tumor touching no more than half a blood vessel's circumference without any fat to separate it), "encasement" (when the tumor encloses most of the vessel's circumference), or full vessel involvement.<ref name="NCCN-PANC201501">{{cite web|title=Pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

[[File:Diagram showing how the pancreas and bowel is joined back together after a Whipple's operation CRUK 140.svg|thumb|How the pancreas and bowel are joined back together after a Whipple's operation]]

For cancers involving the head of the pancreas, the [[Pancreaticoduodenectomy|Whipple procedure]] is the most commonly attempted curative surgical treatment. This is a major operation which involves removing the pancreatic head and the curve of the duodenum together ("pancreato-duodenectomy"), making a [[Bypass surgery|bypass]] for food from the stomach to the [[jejunum]] ("gastro-jejunostomy") and attaching a loop of jejunum to the [[cystic duct]] to drain bile ("cholecysto-jejunostomy"). It can be performed only if the person is likely to survive major surgery and if the cancer is localized without invading local structures or metastasizing. It can, therefore, be performed only in a minority of cases.  Cancers of the tail of the pancreas can be resected using a procedure known as a [[distal pancreatectomy]], which often also entails [[Splenectomy|removal of the spleen]].<ref name="NEJM14" /><ref name="Wolfgang2013"/> Nowadays, this can often be done using [[Laparoscopic surgery|minimally invasive surgery]].<ref name="NEJM14" /><ref name="Wolfgang2013"/>

Although curative surgery no longer entails the very high death rates that occurred until the 1980s, a high proportion of people (about 30–45%) still have to be treated for a post-operative sickness that is not caused by the cancer itself.  The most common [[Complication (medicine)|complication]] of surgery is difficulty in emptying the stomach.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/>  Certain more limited surgical procedures may also be used to ease symptoms (see [[#Palliative care|Palliative care]]): for instance, if the cancer is invading or compressing the duodenum or [[Large intestine|colon]]. In such cases, bypass surgery might overcome the obstruction and improve quality of life but is not intended as a cure.<ref name="Bond-Smith" />

====Chemotherapy====
After surgery, [[Adjuvant therapy|adjuvant]] chemotherapy with [[gemcitabine]] or [[5-FU]] can be offered if the person is [[performance status|sufficiently fit]], after a recovery period of one to two months.<ref name="Lancet"/><ref name=ESMOPA />  In people not suitable for curative surgery, chemotherapy may be used to extend life or improve [[quality of life|its quality]].<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/> Before surgery, [[neoadjuvant]] chemotherapy or [[chemoradiotherapy]]  may be used in cases that are considered to be "borderline resectable" (see [[#Staging|Staging]]) in order to reduce the cancer to a level where surgery could be beneficial. In other cases neoadjuvant therapy remains controversial, because it delays surgery.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/><ref name="Lancet"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Heinemann V, Haas M, Boeck S | title = Neoadjuvant treatment of borderline resectable and non-resectable pancreatic cancer | journal = Annals of Oncology | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 2484–92 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23852311 | doi = 10.1093/annonc/mdt239 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Gemcitabine was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1997, after a [[clinical trial]] reported improvements in quality of life and a 5-week improvement in [[Survival rate#median survival|median survival duration]] in people with advanced pancreatic cancer.<ref name=thota>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thota R, Pauff JM, Berlin JD | title = Treatment of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a review | journal = Oncology | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 70–4 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24683721 }}</ref> This was the first chemotherapy drug approved by the FDA primarily for a nonsurvival clinical trial endpoint.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Ryan DP |url= http://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-for-advanced-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer |title= Chemotherapy for advanced exocrine pancreatic cancer: Topic 2475, Version 46.0 |website= [[UpToDate]] |publisher= [[Wolters Kluwer Health]] |date= 8 July 2014 |access-date= 18 November 2014 |format= subscription required |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141208225612/http://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-for-advanced-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer |archive-date= 8 December 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>  Chemotherapy using gemcitabine alone was the standard for about a decade, as a number of trials testing it in combination with other drugs failed to demonstrate significantly better outcomes. However, the combination of gemcitabine with [[erlotinib]] was found to increase survival modestly, and erlotinib was licensed by the FDA for use in pancreatic cancer in 2005.<ref name="FDA2005">{{cite web |url= http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/fda-erlotinib-hydrochloride#Anchor-Pancreati-44285 |website= National Cancer Institute |publisher= National Institutes of Health |title= Cancer Drug Information: FDA Approval for Erlotinib Hydrochloride |date= 3 July 2013 |access-date= 5 December 2014 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141129135814/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/fda-erlotinib-hydrochloride#Anchor-Pancreati-44285 |archive-date= 29 November 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

The [[FOLFIRINOX]] [[chemotherapy regimen]] using four drugs was found more effective than gemcitabine, but with substantial side effects, and is thus only suitable for people with good performance status.  This is also true of [[protein-bound paclitaxel]] (nab-paclitaxel), which was licensed by the FDA in 2013 for use with gemcitabine in pancreas cancer.<ref name="Borazanci2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Borazanci E, Von Hoff DD | title = Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer | journal = Expert Review of Gastroenterology & Hepatology | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = 739–47 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24882381 | doi = 10.1586/17474124.2014.925799 | s2cid = 31633898 }}</ref> By the end of 2013, both FOLFIRINOX and nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine were regarded as good choices for those able to tolerate the side-effects, and gemcitabine remained an effective option for those who were not.  A head-to-head trial between the two new options is awaited, and trials investigating other variations continue.  However, the changes of the last few years have only increased survival times by a few months.<ref name=thota />  Clinical trials are often conducted for novel adjuvant therapies.<ref name="Lancet"/>

====Radiotherapy====
The role of [[radiation therapy|radiotherapy]] as an auxiliary (adjuvant) treatment after potentially curative surgery has been controversial since the 1980s.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/> The [[European Society for Medical Oncology]] recommends that adjuvant radiotherapy should only be used for people enrolled in clinical trials.<ref name=ESMOPA />  However, there is a continuing tendency for clinicians in the US to be more ready to use adjuvant radiotherapy than those in Europe.  Many clinical trials have tested a variety of treatment combinations since the 1980s, but have failed to settle the matter conclusively.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/><ref name="Lancet" />

Radiotherapy may form part of treatment to attempt to shrink a tumor to a resectable state, but its use on unresectable tumors remains controversial as there are conflicting results from clinical trials.  The preliminary results of one trial, presented in 2013, "markedly reduced enthusiasm" for its use on locally advanced tumors.<ref name="NEJM14" />

===PanNETs===

Radiation therapy is occasionally used if there is pain due to anatomic extension, such as [[metastasis]] to bone.

===Palliative care===
[[Palliative care]] is medical care which focuses on treatment of symptoms from serious illness, such as cancer, and improving quality of life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Palliative or Supportive Care|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/palliativecare/index|publisher=American Cancer Society|date=2014|access-date=20 August 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821054618/http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/palliativecare/index|archive-date=21 August 2014}}</ref>  Because pancreatic adenocarcinoma is usually diagnosed after it has progressed to an advanced stage, palliative care as a treatment of symptoms is often the only treatment possible.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Buanes TA | title = Pancreatic cancer-improved care achievable | journal = World Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 20 | issue = 30 | pages = 10405–18 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25132756 | pmc = 4130847 | doi = 10.3748/wjg.v20.i30.10405 }}</ref>

Palliative care focuses not on treating the underlying cancer, but on treating symptoms such as [[cancer pain|pain]] or nausea, and can assist in decision-making, including when or if [[hospice care]] will be beneficial.<ref>{{cite web|title=If treatment for pancreatic cancer stops working|url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreaticcancer/detailedguide/pancreatic-cancer-after-no-longer-working|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022070844/http://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreaticcancer/detailedguide/pancreatic-cancer-after-no-longer-working|archive-date=22 October 2014|publisher=American Cancer Society|date= 11 June 2014 |access-date=20 August 2014}}</ref>  Pain can be managed with medications such as [[opioid]]s or through procedural intervention, by a [[nerve block]] on the [[celiac plexus]] (CPB).  This alters or, depending on the technique used, destroys the nerves that transmit pain from the abdomen.  CPB is a safe and effective way to reduce the pain, which generally reduces the need to use opioid painkillers, which have significant negative side effects.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arcidiacono PG, Calori G, Carrara S, McNicol ED, Testoni PA | title = Celiac plexus block for pancreatic cancer pain in adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD007519 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21412903 | pmc = 6464722 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007519.pub2 | veditors = Arcidiacono PG }}</ref>

Other symptoms or complications that can be treated with palliative surgery are obstruction by the tumor of the intestines or [[Bile drainage|bile ducts]].  For the latter, which occurs in well over half of cases, a small metal tube called a [[stent]] may be inserted by [[endoscope]] to keep the ducts draining.<ref name="Cruz" />  Palliative care can also help treat depression that often comes with the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.<ref name="Wolfgang2013"/>

Both surgery and advanced inoperable tumors often lead to [[digestive system]] disorders from a lack of the exocrine products of the pancreas (exocrine insufficiency).  These can be treated by taking [[pancreatin]] which contains manufactured pancreatic enzymes, and is best taken with food.<ref name="Bond-Smith" />  Difficulty in emptying the stomach (delayed gastric emptying) is common and can be a serious problem, involving hospitalization. Treatment may involve a variety of approaches, including draining the stomach by [[nasogastric aspiration]] and drugs called [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s or [[H2 antagonist]]s, which both reduce production of [[gastric acid]].<ref name="Bond-Smith" /> Medications like [[metoclopramide]] can also be used to clear stomach contents.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of pancreatic cancer}}

===Recognition and diagnosis===
The earliest recognition of pancreatic cancer has been attributed to the 18th-century Italian scientist [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni]], the historical father of modern-day [[anatomic pathology]], who claimed to have traced several cases of cancer in the pancreas. Many 18th and 19th-century physicians were skeptical about the existence of the disease, given the similar appearance of pancreatitis. Some [[case report]]s were published in the 1820s and 1830s, and a genuine [[histopathologic]] diagnosis was eventually recorded by the American clinician [[Jacob Mendes Da Costa]], who also doubted the reliability of Morgagni's interpretations. By the start of the 20th century, cancer of the head of the pancreas had become a well-established diagnosis.<ref name=Busnardo-1983/>

Regarding the recognition of PanNETs, the possibility of cancer of the islet cells was initially suggested in 1888. The first case of [[hyperinsulinism]] due to a tumor of this type was reported in 1927. Recognition of a non-insulin-secreting type of PanNET is generally ascribed to the American surgeons, R.&nbsp;M. Zollinger and E.&nbsp;H. Ellison, who gave their names to [[Zollinger–Ellison syndrome]], after postulating the existence of a gastrin-secreting pancreatic tumor in a report of two cases of unusually severe [[peptic ulcer]]s published in 1955.<ref name=Busnardo-1983>{{cite journal | vauthors = Busnardo AC, DiDio LJ, Tidrick RT, Thomford NR | title = History of the pancreas | journal = American Journal of Surgery | volume = 146 | issue = 5 | pages = 539–50 | date = November 1983 | pmid = 6356946 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9610(83)90286-6 }}</ref> In 2010, the WHO recommended that PanNETs be referred to as "neuroendocrine" rather than "endocrine" tumors.<ref name=nomenclature/>

Small precancerous neoplasms for many pancreatic cancers are being detected at greatly increased rates by modern medical imaging. One type, the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) was first described by Japanese researchers in 1982. It was noted in 2010 that: "For the next decade, little attention was paid to this report; however, over the subsequent 15&nbsp;years, there has been a virtual explosion in the recognition of this tumor."<ref name="Silberman2010" />

===Surgery===
The first reported partial pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed by the Italian surgeon [[Alessandro Codivilla]] in 1898, but the patient only survived 18&nbsp;days before succumbing to complications. Early operations were compromised partly because of mistaken beliefs that people would die if their duodenum were removed, and also, at first, if the flow of pancreatic juices stopped. Later it was thought, also mistakenly, that the pancreatic duct could simply be tied up without serious adverse effects; in fact, it will very often leak later on. In 1907–1908, after some more unsuccessful operations by other surgeons, experimental procedures were tried on corpses by French surgeons.<ref name="History">{{cite journal | vauthors = Are C, Dhir M, Ravipati L | title = History of pancreaticoduodenectomy: early misconceptions, initial milestones and the pioneers | journal = HPB | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 377–84 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21609369 | pmc = 3103093 | doi = 10.1111/j.1477-2574.2011.00305.x }}</ref>

In 1912 the German surgeon [[Walther Kausch]] was the first to remove large parts of the duodenum and pancreas together (''en bloc''). This was in Breslau, now [[Wrocław]] in Poland. In 1918 it was demonstrated, in operations on dogs, that it is possible to survive even after complete removal of the duodenum, but no such result was reported in human surgery until 1935, when the American surgeon [[Allen Oldfather Whipple]] published the results of a series of three operations at [[Columbia Presbyterian Hospital]] in New York. Only one of the patients had the duodenum entirely removed, but he survived for two years before dying of metastasis to the liver. The first operation was unplanned, as cancer was only discovered in the operating theater. Whipple's success showed the way for the future, but the operation remained a difficult and dangerous one until recent decades. He published several refinements to his procedure, including the first total removal of the duodenum in 1940, but he only performed a total of 37&nbsp;operations.<ref name="History" />

The discovery in the late 1930s that [[vitamin&nbsp;K]] prevented [[Vitamin K deficiency|bleeding with jaundice]], and the development of [[blood transfusion]] as an everyday process, both improved post-operative survival,<ref name="History" /> but about 25% of people never left hospital alive as late as the 1970s.<ref name="Thousand" >{{cite journal | vauthors = Cameron JL, Riall TS, Coleman J, Belcher KA | title = One thousand consecutive pancreaticoduodenectomies | journal = Annals of Surgery | volume = 244 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–5 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16794383 | pmc = 1570590 | doi = 10.1097/01.sla.0000217673.04165.ea }}</ref> In the 1970s a group of American surgeons wrote urging that the procedure was too dangerous and should be abandoned.

In 2006 a report was published of a series of 1,000&nbsp;consecutive pancreatico-duodenectomies performed by a single surgeon from [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] between 1969 and 2003. The rate of these operations had increased steadily over this period, with only three of them before 1980, and the median operating time reduced from 8.8&nbsp;hours in the 1970s to 5.5&nbsp;hours in the 2000s, and mortality within 30&nbsp;days or in hospital was only 1%.<ref name="History" /><ref name="Thousand"/> Another series of 2,050&nbsp;operations at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] between 1941 and 2011 showed a similar picture of improvement.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fernández-del Castillo C, Morales-Oyarvide V, McGrath D, Wargo JA, Ferrone CR, Thayer SP, Lillemoe KD, Warshaw AL | display-authors = 6 | title = Evolution of the Whipple procedure at the Massachusetts General Hospital | journal = Surgery | volume = 152 | issue = 3 Suppl 1 | pages = S56-63 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22770961 | pmc = 3806095 | doi = 10.1016/j.surg.2012.05.022 }}</ref>
