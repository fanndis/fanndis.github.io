==History==
Beginning in the 1950s, Yale University started to expand coursework offerings in business and organization management. A precursor to the School of Management, the Department of Industrial Administration, grew out of the [[Yale Labor and Management Center|Labor and Management Center]], and conferred the master in industrial administration from 1958 through 1973. Professors Thomas Holmes, [[Chris Argyris]], and David Votaw were instrumental in founding the MIA. In 1971, Yale University received a donation establishing a program in management from Frederick W. Beinecke, PhB 1909. Two years later, the Yale Corporation approved the establishment of a School of Organization and Management.{{Copyright violation|date=March 2017}} Arriving in 1976, the first class of the two-year program that awarded a master's degree in public and private management (MPPM) attended the campus on Hillhouse Avenue.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.yale.edu/printer/bulletin/pdffiles/som.pdf | page = 19 | title = School of Management 2016–2017 | publisher = BULLETIN OF YALE UNIVERSITY Series 112 Number 6 July 20, 2016 | accessdate = 25 October 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Yale School of Management, 135 Prospect Street.jpg|thumb|right|Founders Hall, the school's former main building]]
Historically known for its strength in studies regarding nonprofits and the public sector, the school's focus began to evolve and changed its name to the Yale School of Management in 1994.<ref name="yale.edu2">{{cite web|url=http://som.yale.edu/our-approach/about-yale-som/history|title=History|website=Yale School of Management|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref> Shortly thereafter in 1999, the School began offering a master of business (MBA) degree and discontinued the MPPM degree.<ref name="yale.edu2"/>

==Academics==
===Integrated Curriculum===
For the 2006–07 academic year, the School introduced its Integrated Curriculum, an effort to move away from the typical "siloed" teaching approach to a more cross-disciplinary curriculum.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9149115 |title=MBA curriculum changes at Yale and Stanford |publisher=The Economist Magazine |accessdate=2007-06-08 |date=2007-05-10}}</ref> This new curriculum is composed of two components: foundational skills classes in a program called "Orientation to Management" that take place during the first semester of the MBA program and a set of classes called "Organizational Perspectives" that take place during the second through fourth quarters of the first academic year and are case- and lecture-focused courses that decompose business components into the perspectives of different stakeholders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://som.yale.edu/programs/mba/curriculum/integrated-curriculum|title=Our Integrated Curriculum|website=Yale School of Management|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115257738700702887?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=M.B.A. Programs Blend Disciplines To Yield Big Picture |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=2007-06-29 | first=Ronald | last=Alsop | date=2006-07-11}}</ref>

===Silver Scholars===
Initiated in 2001, it was originally open only to Yale undergraduates and was intended to attract more non-traditional MBA candidates with experience outside business and finance. It has since expanded to consider applications from college seniors around the world. Even so, the program remains small. In 2014, SOM admitted only 15 Silver Scholars.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://poetsandquants.com/2014/10/31/yale-may-expand-silver-scholars-admits/|title=Yale May Expand Silver Scholar Admits|date=2014-10-31|work=Poets&Quants|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}</ref>

Despite conventional wisdom that MBA programs require previous work experience, Silver Scholars' job placement and scholarship statistics are at least as good as Yale's traditional MBAs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/9ee03a88-09fa-11e0-9bb4-00144feabdc0|title=Young ‘Silver scholars’ defy the sceptics|date=2010-12-20|website=Financial Times|access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref> With an approximately 5% admit rate, the program is more selective than the traditional MBA program at Yale, as well as most other early admission MBA programs, including those at [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] and [[Harvard Business School]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gyanone.com/blog/yale-silver-scholars/|title=Yale Silver Scholars - why it is unique|date=2014-04-05|work=MBA Admissions Consultant India|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US}}</ref>

Silver Scholars matriculate immediately from undergrad into the School of Management and participate in a one-year, full-time internship after completing the first year of the Integrated Core Curriculum.<ref name="yale.edu3" /> Following their internship, Silver Scholars return to campus to complete their second year of MBA coursework.<ref name="yale.edu3" /> At SOM, that second year has minimal requirements, and students may take courses across all Yale's grad schools. In some circumstances, Silver Scholars receive permission to defer their matriculation as a result of fellowships or other extraordinary circumstances or extend their internships by an additional year.<ref name="yale.edu3" />  A total of 17 Silver Scholars matriculated in the fall of 2019.<ref name="Ethier"/>
