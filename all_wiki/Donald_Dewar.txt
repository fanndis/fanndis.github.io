'''Donald Campbell Dewar''' (21 August 1937 – 11 October 2000) was a Scottish politician who served as [[First Minister of Scotland]] and [[Scottish Labour Party#Leader of the Scottish Labour Party|Leader of the Scottish Labour Party]] from 1999 to 2000. He previously served as [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] from 1997 to 1999. He was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Aberdeen South (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen South]] from [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]] to [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]] and for [[Glasgow Anniesland (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Anniesland]], formerly [[Glasgow Garscadden (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Garscadden]], from [[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|1978]] to [[2000 Glasgow Anniesland by-elections|2000]]. He was also [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for the [[Glasgow Anniesland (Scottish Parliament constituency)|equivalent seat]] from [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999]] to 2000.

Dewar first entered politics in the early 1960s, and was elected as the Labour [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Aberdeen South (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen South]] following the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]]. After losing his seat in [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]], he served in the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] again from [[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|1978]] until his death in 2000. Dewar was an advocate of [[History of Scottish devolution|Scottish devolution]]. He served as [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] in British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] from 1997 to 1999, successfully campaigning for a [[Scottish Parliament]] in the [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum]].

Having led the Labour campaign in the run up to the first [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|Scottish Parliament election]], he subsequently became the [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for [[Glasgow Anniesland (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Anniesland]] on 6 May 1999, and was appointed [[Scottish Labour Party#Organisation|Leader of the Scottish Labour Party]] a day later and became the first Scottish First Minister as the head of a devolved coalition government with the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]]. In October 2000, Dewar died of a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|brain hemorrhage]] at the age of 63 while still in office. He was succeeded as First Minister and Scottish Labour leader by [[Henry McLeish]].

==Early life and career==
Dewar was born in [[Glasgow]] on 21 August 1937 as the only child of Alasdair (1897–1973) and Mary Dewar (''née'' Bennett). His father was a [[dermatologist]] and a former general practitioner. Both Dewar's parents had ill health during his childhood; his father contracted [[tuberculosis]] and his mother suffered from a benign brain tumour when Donald was young.<ref>Allan 2000, para. 5</ref>

He attended [[The Glasgow Academy]], and was admitted to the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1957, where he gained an [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]] degree in History in 1961, a second-class [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]] degree in 1964, and was an editor of the ''[[Glasgow University Guardian]]''.

Dewar met several future politicians at the university [[Glasgow University Dialectic Society|Dialectic Society]], including [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] (who would later become leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]), [[Sir Menzies Campbell]] (who would later become leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]) and [[Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg|Lord Irvine of Lairg]] (who would serve as [[Lord Chancellor]] in the same [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as Dewar). At university, he also served as chair of Glasgow University Labour Club and president of the [[Glasgow University Union]].

== Early political career ==

===Member of Parliament===
He worked as a solicitor in Glasgow after graduating from university, and was also a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and soon turned his sights towards being elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]]. In 1962, he was selected as the Labour candidate for the [[Aberdeen South (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen South]] constituency. In the 1964 general election, he failed to win the seat, but won it at the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 general election]] at the age of 28—defeating [[Priscilla Tweedsmuir]] by 1,799 votes.<ref>Chambers Biographical Dictionary, 2007</ref>

In his maiden speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the same year, Dewar spoke against a proposed increase on potato tax. His speech became his first political success: as the tax was repealed the following year in 1967. Also in 1967, Dewar was made a [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Education Secretary]] [[Anthony Crosland]], with whom Dewar later confessed to having never establishing a rapport with, as Dewar said Crosland was a "very odd man".

Dewar remained in that position at the Department of Education until 1969, in which year he opposed a visit to Aberdeen by the Springbok rugby team and staged a silent vigil near the team's ground. In April 1968, he was proposed for a [[Minister of State]] position by [[Roy Jenkins]], but was not appointed. Dewar lost his constituency seat to the Conservative candidate [[Iain Sproat]] at the 1970 general election by over 1,000 votes.

===Out of parliament===
Dewar spent much of the 1970s looking for another parliamentary seat. He hosted a Friday evening talk show on [[Radio Clyde]], and in June 1971 was beaten by [[Dennis Canavan]] when he applied for the seat of [[West Stirlingshire]]. He worked as a solicitor for much of that decade and became a reporter on children's panels and was involved with the Lanarkshire local authority. Dewar became a partner in Ross Harper Murphy, in 1975.

===Return to Westminster===
Donald Dewar was selected for the seat [[Glasgow Garscadden (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Garscadden]] by a majority of three, after Dewar's friend in the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers MP [[William Small (Scottish politician)|Willie Small]] died unexpectedly. He was returned to parliament at a [[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|by-election]] on 13 April 1978, a crucial victory which was seen as halting the rise of the [[Scottish National Party]]. In [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|Scotland's first referendum on devolution]], held in March 1979, he campaigned for a "Yes" vote alongside the Conservative [[Alick Buchanan-Smith (1932–1991)|Alick Buchanan-Smith]] and the Liberal [[Russell Johnston (politician)|Russell Johnston]]. Though they won a narrow majority, it fell short of the 40% required, contributing to the downfall of the Callaghan Government, in May 1979.

===Opposition===
Dewar gained a parliamentary platform as chairman of the [[Scottish Affairs Select Committee]]. After a year honing his inquisitorial skills, he joined the front bench in November 1980 as a Scottish affairs spokesman when [[Michael Foot]] became party leader. In 1981, as the Labour Party divided itself further due to internal disagreement, Dewar was almost deselected in his constituency by hard left activists, but he successfully defended himself against this threat.

He rose quickly through the ranks, becoming Shadow Scottish Secretary in November 1983. On 21 December 1988, Dewar was in Lockerbie after the bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]],<ref>The Scottish Government, 1998</ref> as the member of the Shadow Cabinet in charge of Scottish affairs. In 1992, [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] made him Shadow [[Social security]] Secretary and three years later, Dewar was made a Chief Whip for the Labour Party by [[Tony Blair]].

===In government===
At the 1997 general election, he became MP for [[Glasgow Anniesland (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Anniesland]], which was mostly the same constituency with minor boundary changes. Labour won this election by a landslide, and Dewar was given the post of [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. He was able to start the devolution process he dreamt of years earlier, and worked tirelessly on creating the [[Scotland Act 1998|Scotland Act]], popularly referred to as "Smith's unfinished business". When ratified, this was to give Scotland its first [[Scottish Parliament|Parliament]] for nearly 300 years.

In January 1998, he confirmed that he would stand for a seat in the [[Scottish Parliament]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/45789.stm |title=Dewar to stand for Scottish parliament |work=BBC News |date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=5 March 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030409214033/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/45789.stm |archivedate=9 April 2003 }}</ref> The [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first elections to the Scottish Parliament]] were held on 6 May 1999, with Dewar leading the Scottish Labour Party against their main opponents, the Scottish National Party led by [[Alex Salmond]].

He was elected as the [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for [[Glasgow Anniesland (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Anniesland]], having the unusual distinction of being both an MP and MSP for the same constituency. Although Scottish Labour won more seats than any other party, they did not have a majority in Parliament to allow them to form an Executive without the help of a smaller party. A deal was agreed with the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] to form a coalition, with Dewar agreeing to their demand for the abolition of up front tuition fees for university students.<ref>''The Guardian'', 1999</ref>

{{Quote box|quote='There shall be a Scottish parliament.' Through long years, those words were first a hope, then a belief, then a promise. Now they are a reality.|source=—Dewar, at the official opening of the Scottish Parliament on 1 July 1999.<ref>Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations</ref>|width=22em}}

On 13 May 1999, Dewar was nominated as First Minister, and was officially appointed by the Queen on 17 May at a ceremony in the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]]. He later travelled to the [[Court of Session]] to be sworn in by the Lord President and receive the [[Great Seal of Scotland]].<ref>''BBC News'', 1999a</ref>

On 16 June, Dewar set out the legislative programme for the Executive which included: an Education bill to improve standards in Scottish schools; land reform to give right of access to the countryside, a bill to abolish the feudal system of land tenure; and a bill to establish [[National Parks]] in Scotland.<ref>''BBC News'', 1999b</ref>

One of the first scandals to hit the new Scottish Parliament occurred when allegations that the lobbying arm of public relations company Beattie Media had privileged access to ministers were published, prompting Dewar to ask the standards committee to investigate the reports.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/458002.stm "Probe launched into lobbying allegations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222115148/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/458002.stm|date=22 December 2007}}, ''BBC News''</ref> The Minister for Finance, [[Jack McConnell]], was called to appear before the standards committee during the investigation although he was later cleared of any wrongdoing and the committee declared there was no evidence he had been influenced from lobbying by Beattie Media.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/492536.stm "Scotland Standards watchdog clears McConnell"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031215052412/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/492536.stm|date=15 December 2003}} ''BBC News''</ref>

Dewar also threatened to sack any minister or aide who briefed the media against another member of the Scottish Executive, following public rows between Jack McConnell and the [[Minister of Health and Community Care]], [[Susan Deacon]] over the budget allocated to health .<ref>[http://www.cipfa.org.uk/publicfinance/search_details.cfm?News_id=5659&keysearch=McConnell Public Finance- 14 July 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007215718/http://www.cipfa.org.uk/publicfinance/search_details.cfm?News_id=5659&keysearch=McConnell|date=7 October 2007}}</ref>

==Death and funeral==
In April 2000, Dewar was admitted to hospital for tests on his heart, following a previous test where a minor irregularity was discovered.<ref>''BBC News'' 2000a</ref> In May 2000, he had surgery to repair a leaking heart valve, and was forced to take a three-month break from Parliament, with Deputy First Minister [[Jim Wallace, Baron Wallace of Tankerness|Jim Wallace]] taking over as Acting First Minister.<ref>''BBC News'' 2000b</ref> He returned to work on 14 August 2000.<ref>''BBC News'' 2000c</ref>

Dewar dealt with the [[SQA examinations controversy|2000 exam results fiasco]] and the lorry drivers' strike, and attended the Labour Party conference in Brighton, but at the end of September he told the historian Tom Devine in [[Dublin]] that if there was no surge of the energy of old, he would have to reappraise the situation within a few months.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/donald_dewar.htm "Donald Dewar"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513102041/http://www.electricscotland.com/history/donald_dewar.htm |date=13 May 2012 }}, ''Electronic Scotland'', October 2000''</ref>

On 10 October 2000 around lunchtime, Dewar sustained a fall. He seemed fine at first, but later that day suffered a massive [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|brain haemorrhage]] which was possibly triggered by the [[anticoagulant]] medication he was taking following heart surgery. He died the following day in Edinburgh's [[Western General Hospital]], never having regained consciousness. He was 63 years old.

Dewar's funeral service was held at [[Glasgow Cathedral]], amid scenes of mourning unknown for a politician in Scotland's largest city. He was cremated on 18 October 2000, and his ashes were scattered at [[Lochgilphead]] in [[Argyll]].

<blockquote>"Although he has become something of a political legend, Donald would have abhorred any attempt to turn him into some kind of secular saint. He would have been horrified at a Diana-style out-pouring of synthetic grief at his untimely death."&nbsp;— [[Iain MacWhirter]], ''[[Sunday Herald]]'', 15 October 2000.</blockquote>

Dewar's work for the [[Scottish Parliament]] has led him to be called the "[[Father of the Nation]]".<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/966880.stm | work=BBC News | title='Father of nation' dies | date=11 October 2000 | accessdate=29 March 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217180818/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/966880.stm | archivedate=17 December 2006 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics-made-good-on-the-unfinished-business-of-devolution-634618.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=The Father of the Nation, who made good on the unfinished business of devolution | first=Andrew | last=Grice | date=12 October 2000 | accessdate=29 March 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917082516/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-father-of-the-nation-who-made-good-on-the-unfinished-business-of-devolution-634618.html | archivedate=17 September 2009 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In May 2002, then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] unveiled a statue of Donald Dewar at the top of Glasgow's [[Buchanan Street]], a street in [[Glasgow city centre]]. In keeping with his famous unkempt appearance, it showed Dewar wearing a slightly crushed jacket.

The statue was taken down in October 2005 to be cleaned, and was re-erected on {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} high plinth in December in an effort to protect it from vandalism. On the base of the statue were inscribed the opening words of the Scotland Act: "There Shall Be A Scottish Parliament", a phrase to which Dewar himself famously said, "I like that!"

Dewar called the [[Old Royal High School]] on [[Calton Hill]] in Edinburgh a "[[Scottish nationalist|nationalist]] [[shibboleth]]", mainly because it had been the proposed site of the [[Scottish Assembly]] in the [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|1979 referendum]]. Dewar's opposition to the Calton Hill site partly contributed to the selection of the [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]] site, [[Scottish Parliament Building#Problems|which proved expensive]].

The First ScotRail [[British Rail Class 334|Class 334]] train ''334001'' was named ''Donald Dewar'' in his memory. The "Dewar Arts Award" was created by the Scottish Executive in 2002 dedicated to his memory. This award supports talented young Scottish artists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dewarawards.org/about|title=The Dewar Awards|website=Dewar Awards|access-date=25 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624200409/http://www.dewarawards.org/about|archivedate=24 June 2016}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
On 20 July 1964, Dewar married Alison Mary McNair, with whom he had two children: a daughter, Marion, and a son, Ian. In 1972, McNair separated from Dewar and entered a relationship with the then [[Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg|Derry Irvine]], a prominent Scottish [[barrister]] in London. Dewar and his wife divorced in 1973, and he never remarried.{{cn|date=November 2020}} Dewar and Lord Irvine of Lairg never reconciled, even though they later served in the same [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] from May 1997 until 1999.

In September 2009, Dennis Canavan said Dewar reacted callously when his son was diagnosed with [[skin cancer]] in 1989. The disease eventually killed him. Canavan said Dewar remarked, "Oh no! That's all we need. He was mad enough before but I shudder to think what he'll be like now."<ref>''The Herald'' 2009</ref>

Dewar amassed a personal fortune in excess of £2,000,000 including public utility shares, antiques and artwork with a value of over £400,000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Womersley|first=Tara|date=2 July 2001|title=£2m legacy of Dewar, the canniest of Scots|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1332575/2m-legacy-of-Dewar-the-canniest-of-Scots.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323001617/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1332575/2m-legacy-of-Dewar-the-canniest-of-Scots.html|archivedate=23 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
