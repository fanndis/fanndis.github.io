{{short description|Popular music act featuring several young female singers}}
A '''girl group''' is a music act featuring several [[women in music|female singers]] who generally [[vocal harmony|harmonize]] together. The term "girl group" is also used in a narrower sense in the United States to denote the wave of American female [[pop music]] singing groups, many of whom were influenced by [[doo-wop]] and which flourished in the late [[1950s in music|1950s]] and early [[1960s in music|1960s]] between the [[Rock and roll#Decline|decline of early rock and roll]] and start of the [[British Invasion]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rutledge |first=Meredith E. |url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6655_the-fabulous-girl-groups-women-who-rock/ |title=The Fabulous Girl Groups &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=2013-04-15 |access-date=2014-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/g_g-history.htm |title=Girl Groups - A Short History |publisher=History-of-rock.com |access-date=2014-06-04}}</ref> [[All-female band]]s, in which members also play instruments, are usually considered a separate phenomenon.

With the advent of the [[music industry]] and radio broadcasting, a number of girl groups emerged, such as the [[Andrews Sisters]].

==History==
===Vaudeville and close harmonies===
One of the first major all-female groups was the [[Three X Sisters|Hamilton Sisters and Fordyce]], an American trio who successfully toured England and parts of Europe in 1927, recorded and appeared on BBC radio{{snd}} they toured the US variety and big-time theaters extensively, and later changed their stage name to the [[Three X Sisters]].  The ladies were together from 1923 until the early 1940s, and known for their close harmonies, as well as barbershop style or novelty tunes, and utilized their 1930s radio success.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19351104&id=QLIhAAAAIBAJ&pg=4476,855160|title=Reading Eagle - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref> The Three X Sisters were also especially a notable addition to the music scene, and predicted later girl group success by maintaining their popularity throughout the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://threexsistersharmony.angelfire.com/|title=Three X Sisters|website=threexsistersharmony.angelfire.com|access-date=2016-05-16}}</ref> [[The Boswell Sisters]], who became one of the most popular singing groups from 1930 to 1936, had over twenty hits.  [[The Andrews Sisters]] started in 1937 as a Boswell tribute band and continued recording and performing through the 1940s into the late-1960s, achieving more record sales, more Billboard hits, more million-sellers, and more movie appearances than any other girl group to date.<ref>"Swing It! The Andrews Sisters Story," John Sforza, University Press of Kentucky, 2000</ref> The Andrews Sisters had musical hits across multiple genres, which contributed to the prevalence and popularity of the girl group form.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmgww.com/music/andrews/|title=The Andrews Sisters - The Official Site|website=www.cmgww.com|access-date=2016-05-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701012546/http://www.cmgww.com/music/andrews/|archive-date=2011-07-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The rise of girl groups appeared out of and was influenced by other musical movements of the time period. [[Vaudeville]] created an environment of entertainment in which the appearance of the girl group was not unfriendly, and musical forms like [[a cappella]] and [[barbershop quartet]] singing provided inspiration for the structure of the songs and types of harmonies sung by initial girl groups. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Importantly, the first successful girl groups of this era were typically white, but capitalized on using music such as ragtime that had originated in the African American community.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} This era was also advantageous to the beginnings of girl group music because of the newfound prevalence of the radio as well, which allowed this style of music to spread.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===1955–1970: The golden age of girl groups===
As the rock era began, [[close harmony]] acts like [[the Chordettes]], [[the Fontane Sisters]], the [[McGuire Sisters]] and [[the DeCastro Sisters]] remained popular, with the first three acts topping the pop charts and the last reaching number two, at the end of 1954 to the beginning of 1955.<ref>{{cite book

Other songwriters and producers in the US and UK quickly recognized the potential of this new approach and recruited existing acts (or, in some cases, created new ones) to record their songs in a girl-group style.

====Emergence of Asian dance-pop girl groups====
Although the emergence of dance-pop focused acts in Asia paralleled their British counterparts in the 1990s, girl groups in Asia sustained as a successful format through the 2010s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williamson |first=Lucy |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13760064 |title=BBC News - The dark side of South Korean pop music |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2011-06-14 |access-date=2014-06-04}}</ref> Many of these girl groups practice highly choreographed dances with studio-produced playback.

Since 2009, [[Hallyu]] (Korean wave) and [[K-pop]] has become increasingly significant in the entertainment industry, with its influence breaking the confinements of Asia and spreading to the Middle East, North Africa, Europe and the Americas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/18/3516562/k-pop-invades-america-south-korea-pop-music-factory|title=K-Pop takes America: how South Korea's music machine is conquering the world|work=The Verge|date=18 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://times.uos.ac.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1241|title=K-POP Hits the Europe|work=The UOS Times|date=31 August 2011}}</ref> Girl groups are considered one of the leaders of this "Hallyu" wave, with popular groups consistently topping the [[Gaon Album Chart]]s.

The influence of the original girl groups of the United States was not lost on this era of artists, as many adopted visual influences through their "retro" concepts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/82982/20140310/kpop-fashion-trend-report-retro-vintage.htm |title=K-Pop Fashion Trend Report: Retro-Vintage |first=Jody |last=C. |date= March 10, 2014 |publisher=KpopStarz |access-date=2014-06-04}}</ref> such as the international 2008 hit "[[Nobody (Wonder Girls song)|Nobody]]" by [[Wonder Girls]].

==Themes==
Girl groups have a wide array of subject matter in their songs, depending on time and place and who was producing. Songs also had a penchant for reflecting the political and cultural climate around them. For instance, songs with abusive undertones were somewhat common during the 1950s–1970s. One notable example was the song "[[He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)]]" by [[the Crystals]]. During the "golden age of girl groups", lyrics were disparate, ranging from songs about mean dogs to underage pregnancy. However, common sentiments were also found in ideas like new love, pining after a crush or lover, and heartache. Some songs sounded upbeat or cheerful and sang about falling in love, whereas others took a decidedly more melancholic turn. Groups like [[The Shangri-Las]], with the song "[[I Can Never Go Home Anymore]]" sang about the darker side of being in love.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jul/23/girl-groups-10-of-the-best-ronettes-supremes-shangri-las|title=60s girl groups: 10 of the best|last=Jonze|first=Tim|date=2014-07-23|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref>

===Adolescence===
An especially prevalent theme was adolescence. Since most of the girl groups were composed of young singers, often still in high school, songs mentioned parents in many cases. Adolescence was also a popular subject because of an emerging audience of young girls listening to and buying records. Adolescence was also reinforced by girl groups in cultivation of a youthful image, since "an unprecedented instance of teenage girls occupying center stage of mainstream commercial culture".<ref name="Buckingham">{{Cite web|url=https://storyofaphoenix.wordpress.com/2014/12/26/the-evolving-presence-of-feminism-and-women-in-rock-and-roll/|title=The Evolving Presence of Feminism and Women in Rock and Roll|last=Buckingham|first=Kathryn|date=2014-12-26|website=Story of a Phoenix|access-date=2016-05-23|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413070240/https://storyofaphoenix.wordpress.com/2014/12/26/the-evolving-presence-of-feminism-and-women-in-rock-and-roll/|archive-date=2016-04-13}}</ref> An example of this youth branding might be [[Emma Bunton|Baby Spice]] from the [[Spice Girls]]. This was shown through flourishes like typically matching outfits for mid-century girl groups and youthful content in songs. Girl groups of the 1950s era would also give advice to other girls, or sing about the advice their mothers gave to them, which was a similarity to some male musical groups of the time (for example, [[the Miracles]]' "[[Shop Around]]").

Adolescence was also important (especially starting in the 1950s) from the other end: the consumers were "teenagers [with] disposable income, ready access to automobiles, and consolidated high schools that exposed them to large numbers of other teens. Mass teen culture was born."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thelearnedfangirl.com/2016/04/sisters-with-voices-a-brief-history-of-girl-groups/|title=Sisters With Voices: A Brief History of Girl Groups|date=2016-04-07|website=The Learned Fangirl|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref> This was a symbiotic relationship with the girl groups in that these groups sang youthful content to appeal to their teen audience, and the teens, especially girls, bought the girl group records accordingly. Girls were also more easily exploited and more accessible to a youth, as well as broader audiences.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Feminism===
Additionally, as the girl group structure persisted through further generations, popular cultural sentiments were incorporated into the music. The appearance of "[[girl power]]" and feminism was also added, even though beginning groups were very structured in their femininity.<ref name="Buckingham"/> Girl groups would give advice to their audience, or there would be a back-and-forth dialogue between the backup singers and the main singer. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}} It would be simplistic to imply that girl groups only sang about being in love; on the contrary, many groups expressed complex sentiments in their songs. There were songs of support, songs that were gossipy, etc.; like any other musical movement, there was much variation in what was being sung. A prominent theme was often teaching "what it meant to be a woman".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Selling an Image: Girl Groups of the 1960s|last=Cyrus|first=Cynthia J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=May 2003|pages=173–193}}</ref> Girl groups would exhibit what womanhood looked like from the clothes they were wearing to the actual lyrics in their songs. Of course this changed over the years (what the Supremes were wearing was different from the Spice Girls), but girl groups still served as beacons and examples of certain types of identities to their audiences through the years.

Girl groups in earlier generations like the 1950s were perhaps more exploited (at least overtly) than more recent girl groups.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In the 1990s through the present, with the prevalence of such groups as the Spice Girls, there has been a strong emphasis on women's independence and a sort of feminism. At the very least, the music is more assertive lyrically and relies less on innuendo.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} This more recent wave of girl groups is more sexually provocative as well, which makes sense within pop music within this time frame as well.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4W7hAQAAQBAJ|title=Girl Groups, Girl Culture: Popular Music and Identity in the 1960s|date=20 February 2007|first=Jacqueline|last=Warwick|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415971133}}</ref>
