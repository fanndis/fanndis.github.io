'''Walter Frederick''' "'''Fritz'''" '''Mondale''' (born January 5, 1928) is an American politician, diplomat and lawyer who served as the [[List of vice presidents of the United States|42nd]] [[vice president of the United States]] from 1977 to 1981. A [[United States Senator|United States senator]] from [[Minnesota]] (1964–1976), he was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Walter Mondale 1984 presidential campaign|nominee]] in the [[1984 United States presidential election]], but lost to incumbent [[Ronald Reagan]] in an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] and popular vote [[Landslide victory|landslide]]. Reagan won 49 states while Mondale carried his home state of [[Minnesota]] and the [[District of Columbia]]. In October 2002, Mondale became the last-minute choice of the [[Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party]] to run for [[2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota|Senate]] after the death of Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], but was defeated by [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. Mondale became the [[List of vice presidents of the United States by age#Timeline of oldest living vice presidents|oldest living]] former U.S. vice president after the death of [[George H. W. Bush]] in 2018.

Mondale was born in [[Ceylon, Minnesota]], and graduated from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1951 after attending [[Macalester College]]. He then served in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]] before earning a [[law degree]] in 1956. He married [[Joan Mondale|Joan Adams]] in 1955. Working as a lawyer in [[Minneapolis]], Mondale was appointed [[Minnesota Attorney General]] in 1960 by Governor [[Orville Freeman]] and was elected to a full term as attorney general in 1962 with 60% of the vote. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor [[Karl Rolvaag]] upon the resignation of Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] following Humphrey's election as vice president in 1964. Mondale was elected to a full Senate term in 1966 and reelected in 1972, resigning in 1976 as he prepared to succeed to the vice presidency in 1977. While in the Senate, he supported [[consumer protection]], [[fair housing]], [[tax reform]], and the [[desegregation]] of schools. Importantly, he served as a member of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities ("[[Church Committee]]").<ref>[https://fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm Staff Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003144646/http://www.fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm |date=October 3, 2009 }} of Church Committee, archived by [[Federation of American Scientists]], Retrieved October 22, 2014.</ref>

In [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]], [[Jimmy Carter]], the Democratic presidential nominee, chose Mondale as his vice-presidential running mate. The Carter–Mondale ticket defeated incumbent president [[Gerald Ford]] and his vice presidential running mate, [[Bob Dole]]. Carter and Mondale's time in office was marred by a worsening economy and they lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 election]] to Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], Mondale won the Democratic presidential nomination and campaigned for a [[nuclear freeze]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], an increase in taxes, and a reduction of [[U.S. public debt]]. His vice presidential nominee was [[Geraldine Ferraro]], a Congresswoman from [[New York (state)|New York]], the first female vice-presidential nominee of any major party. Mondale and Ferraro lost the election to the incumbents Reagan and Bush.

After his defeat, Mondale joined the Minnesota-based law firm [[Dorsey & Whitney]] and the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]] (1986–93). President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Mondale [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] in 1993; he retired in 1996. In [[2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota|2002]], Mondale ran for his old Senate seat, agreeing to be the last-minute replacement for Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], who died in a plane crash less than two weeks before the election. Mondale narrowly lost the race to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. He then returned to working at Dorsey & Whitney and remained active in the Democratic Party. Mondale later took up a part-time teaching position at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Up Close with Walter Mondale|url=https://give.umn.edu/content/close-walter-mondale|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106134345/http://give.umn.edu/content/close-walter-mondale|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 6, 2015|website=UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA FOUNDATION|publisher=University of Minnesota|access-date=May 2, 2016}}</ref>

==Entry into politics==
Mondale became involved in national politics in the 1940s. At age 20, he was visible in Minnesota politics by helping organize [[Hubert Humphrey]]'s successful Senate campaign in [[U.S. Senate election, 1948|1948]]. Humphrey's campaign assigned Mondale to cover the staunchly Republican [[Minnesota's 2nd congressional district|2nd district]]. Mondale, who had grown up in the region, was able to win the district for Humphrey by a comfortable margin.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mondale Future|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1977/01/20/mondale-future/71e2133e-17e0-4da3-852c-b9c785ecac59/|work=The Washington Post|date=January 20, 1977}}</ref>

After working with Humphrey, Mondale went on to work on several campaigns for [[Orville Freeman]]. Mondale worked on Freeman's unsuccessful [[Minnesota gubernatorial election, 1952|1952 campaign for governor]] as well as his successful campaign in [[Minnesota gubernatorial election, 1954|1954]] and his [[Minnesota gubernatorial election, 1958|1958]] reelection campaign.<ref name=thegoodfight>{{cite book|last1=Mondale|first1=Walter|title=The Good Fight: A Life in Liberal Politics|date=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781439171684}}</ref>{{rp|14}}

In 1960, Freeman appointed Mondale [[Minnesota Attorney General]] following the resignation of [[Miles Lord]]. At the time he was appointed, Mondale was 32 years old and had been practicing law for four years. He was elected to the post in his own right in 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collections.mnhs.org/mondale/index.php/10001325|title=Walter F. Mondale : mnhs.org|work=mnhs.org}}</ref>

During his tenure as Minnesota Attorney General, the case ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' (which ultimately established the right of defendants in state courts to have a lawyer) was being heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. When those opposed to the right to counsel organized a [[Amicus Curiae|Friend of the Court]] brief representing several state attorneys general for that position, Mondale organized a countering Friend of the Court brief from many more state attorneys general, arguing that defendants must be allowed a lawyer.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Kevin S.|title=Happy anniversary, Clarence Gideon|url=https://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2013/03/happy-anniversary-clarence-gideon|website=MinnPost}}</ref> He also continued the investigation of former Minneapolis mayor [[Marvin L. Kline]] and the mismanagement of the [[Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute|Sister Kenny Foundation]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cohn|first1=Victor|title=Sister Kenny: The Woman Who Challenged the Doctors|date=1976|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816657339|page=244}}</ref>

At the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]], Mondale played a major role in the proposed but ultimately unsuccessful compromise by which the national Democratic Party offered the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] two at-large seats.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Olson|first1=Dan|title=The Mondale Lectures: Atlantic City Revisited|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200002/11_olsond_mondalelectures/|website=Minnesota Public Radio}}</ref>

Mondale also served as a member of the President's Consumer Advisory Council from 1960 to 1964.<ref name=congressbio/>

==U.S. Senator==
{{Missing information|Mondale's stance on tax reform, school desegregation, as stated in the introduction|date=March 2011}}
[[File:Mondale as Senator.jpg|thumb|left|Senator Walter F. Mondale]]
On December 30, 1964, [[Governor of Minnesota|Minnesota Governor]] [[Karl Rolvaag]] appointed Mondale to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by [[Hubert Humphrey]]'s resignation after being elected [[Vice President of the United States]]. Mondale was elected to the Senate for the first time in [[United States Senate elections, 1966|1966]], defeating [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate Robert A. Forsythe, 53.9% to 45.2%.

In [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]], Democratic presidential candidate [[George McGovern]] offered Mondale an opportunity to be his vice-presidential running mate, which he declined.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lin|first=Judy|title=George McGovern: the personal and political toll of mental illness|url=http://www.today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/george-mcgovern-semel-173090.aspx?ncid=10386|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121211161941/http://www.today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/george-mcgovern-semel-173090.aspx?ncid=10386|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 11, 2012|access-date=September 6, 2012|newspaper=UCLA Today|date=October 7, 2010|quote=Six colleagues—from [[Ted Kennedy]] to Walter Mondale—turned him down for reasons ranging from "My mother just couldn't take it" (Kennedy, referring to [[Rose Kennedy]]'s grief following the assassinations of her sons [[John F. Kennedy|John]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]]) to "I'm getting married tomorrow, and I don't know if my marriage will survive a presidential campaign" ([[Abe Ribicoff]]).}}</ref> That year, Mondale was [[United States Senate elections, 1972|reelected to the Senate]] with over 57% of the vote, even as [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] carried Minnesota. He served in the [[88th United States Congress|88th]], [[89th United States Congress|89th]], [[90th United States Congress|90th]], [[91st United States Congress|91st]], [[92nd United States Congress|92nd]], [[93rd United States Congress|93rd]], and [[94th United States Congress|94th congresses]].

===Policies===
Mondale worked hard to build up the center of the party on economic and social issues. Unlike his father, a fervent liberal, he was not a crusader for the New Deal. Instead he realized the Democratic base (especially ethnic blue-collar workers) was gradually moving to the right and he worked to keep their support.<ref>Steven M. Gillon, ''The Democrats' Dilemma: Walter F. Mondale and the Liberal Legacy'' (1992) pp. xxiii, xxvi, 8, 303</ref> Mondale showed little or no interest in foreign policy until about 1974, when he realized that some knowledge was necessary if he had loftier aspirations than the Senate. He developed a centrist position, avoiding alignment with either the party's hawks (such as [[Henry M. Jackson]]) or its doves (such as McGovern).<ref>Steven M. Gillon, ''The Democrats' Dilemma: Walter F. Mondale and the Liberal Legacy'' pp 149–51</ref> He took a liberal position on civil rights, which proved acceptable in Minnesota, a state with "a minuscule black population".<ref>Steven M. Gillon, ''The Democrats' Dilemma'', pp 68–69, 111, quote p. 69</ref> Mondale was a chief sponsor of the federal [[Fair Housing Act]], which prohibits discrimination in housing and created [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]]'s [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] as the primary enforcer of the law.<ref>http://www.huduser.org/Periodicals/CITYSCPE/VOL4NUM3/mathias.pdf</ref>

During Johnson's presidency, Mondale supported the [[Vietnam War]], but after Nixon became president in 1969, he began to oppose it and participated in legislation to restrict Nixon's ability to prolong it. Mondale supports abortion rights.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZ6QAQAAQBAJ&pg=PR19|title=Can a Catholic be a Democrat?|work=google.com|isbn=9781933184197|last1=Carlin|first1=David R.|date=September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url = http://millercenter.org/president/carter/essays/vicepresident/1829 | title = American President: A Reference Resource | publisher = [[Miller Center of Public Affairs]] | access-date = June 16, 2015 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150319120855/http://millercenter.org/president/carter/essays/vicepresident/1829 | archive-date = March 19, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

===Committees===
Mondale rotated on and off numerous committees, including the [[United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences|Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee]]; the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Finance Committee]]; the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Labor and Public Welfare Committee]]; the [[United States Senate Committee on the Budget|Budget Committee]]; and the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee]]. He also served as chairman of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Equal Education Opportunity|Select Committee on Equal Education Opportunity]] and the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence Committee]]'s Domestic Task Force. He additionally served as chairman of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee's subcommittee on Children and Youth and the Senate subcommittee on social security financing.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Nation: The Straightest Arrow|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914370,00.html|date=July 26, 1976|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url-access=subscription|access-date=November 4, 2011}}</ref>

=== Apollo 1 accident (1967) ===
In 1967, Mondale served on the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, then chaired by [[Clinton P. Anderson]], when astronauts [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger Chaffee]] were killed in a fire on January 27 while testing the Apollo 204 (later renumbered [[Apollo 1]]) spacecraft. [[NASA]] Administrator [[James E. Webb]] secured President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s approval for NASA to internally investigate the cause of the accident according to its established procedures, subject to Congressional oversight. NASA's procedure called for Deputy Administrator (and de facto general manager) [[Robert C. Seamans]] to appoint and oversee an investigative panel.

In February, a reporter leaked to Mondale the existence of [[Phillips Report|an internal NASA report]] issued in 1965 by Apollo program director [[Samuel C. Phillips]], detailing management, cost, delivery, and quality problems of the Apollo prime contractor [[North American Aviation]]. In the February 27 hearing, Mondale asked Webb if he knew of such a report. Webb had not yet seen the December 1965 written report, so he responded in the negative. Seamans had passed along to Webb neither the written report nor the briefing presentation made to him in January 1966 by Phillips and Phillips's boss, Manned Space Flight Administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]].<ref name="wamu">{{Cite episode|title=Washington Goes to the Moon (Part 2) |url=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|access-date=March 15, 2011|series=Soundprint |network=NPR|station=WAMU 88.5 FM|location=Washington D.C.|airdate=May 24, 2001|transcript=yes |transcript-url=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/d/programs/special/moon/fire_show.txt|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728170238/http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|archive-date=July 28, 2011}}</ref>

Both Seamans and Mueller had also been called to testify at this session. Mueller denied the report's existence, though he must have been aware of it, as he had appended his own strongly worded letter to the copy sent to North American president [[Lee Atwood]].<ref name="phillips_report">{{cite web|last=Garber|first=Steve|title=NASA Apollo Mission Apollo-1 – Phillips Report |publisher=NASA History Office|date=February 3, 2003|url=https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/phillip1.html|access-date=April 14, 2010}}</ref>

Seamans was afraid Mondale might be in possession of a copy (he was not), so he admitted that NASA often reviewed its contractors' performance, with both positive and negative results, but claimed that was nothing extraordinary. Under repeated questioning from Mondale, Webb promised that he would investigate whether the "Phillips Report" existed, and if so, whether a controlled release could be made to Congress. Immediately after the hearing, Webb saw the Phillips report for the first time.<ref name="wamu"/>

The controversy spread to both houses of Congress and grew (through the efforts of three of Mondale's fellow committee members, Republicans [[Margaret Chase Smith]], [[Edward Brooke]] and [[Charles H. Percy]]) to include the second-guessing of NASA's original selection in 1961 of North American as the prime Apollo spacecraft contractor, which Webb became forced to defend. The House NASA oversight committee, which was conducting its own hearings and had picked up on the controversy, was ultimately given a copy of the Phillips report.

While the Committee, as a whole, believed that NASA should have informed Congress of the Phillips review results in 1966, its final report issued on January 30, 1968, concluded (as had NASA's own accident investigation completed on April 5, 1967), that "the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident". Yet Mondale wrote a minority opinion accusing NASA of "evasiveness,... lack of candor, ... patronizing attitude exhibited toward Congress, ... refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries, and ... solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy".<ref name="as204_senate">{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Clinton P.|author-link=Clinton P.

Mondale explained his actions in a 2001 interview: "I think that by forcing a public confrontation about these heretofore secret and deep concerns about the safety and the management of the program, it forced NASA to restructure and reorganize the program in a way that was much safer."<ref name="wamu"/> (In the 1998 miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', Mondale is portrayed (by [[John Slattery]]) as being entirely against the space program and wanting to shut it down following the disaster, but after moving testimony by astronaut [[Frank Borman]] ([[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]]), Mondale acquiesces.)

===Church intelligence committee===
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In 1975, Mondale served on the [[Church Committee|Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities]], chaired by Idaho Senator [[Frank Church]], that investigated alleged abuses by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].

Documents declassified in 2017 show that the [[National Security Agency]] had created a file on Mondale as part of its monitoring of prominent US citizens whose names appeared in [[Signals intelligence]].<ref>{{cite news |title=National Security Agency Tracking of U.S. Citizens – "Questionable Practices" from 1960s & 1970s |url=https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/cybervault-intelligence-nuclear-vault/2017-09-25/national-security-agency-tracking-us |access-date=January 3, 2020 |publisher=National Security Archive |date=September 25, 2017}}</ref>

==Vice President of the United States (1977–1981)==
{{Further|Presidency of Jimmy Carter}}
When [[Jimmy Carter]] won the Democratic nomination for [[president of the United States|president]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976]], he chose Mondale as his running mate. The ticket was narrowly elected on November 2, 1976, and Mondale was inaugurated as [[Vice President of the United States]] on January 20, 1977. He became the fourth vice president in four years, after [[Spiro Agnew]] (1969–73), [[Gerald Ford]] (1973–74), and [[Nelson Rockefeller]] (1974–77).

Under Carter, Mondale traveled extensively throughout the nation and the world advocating the administration's foreign policy. His travels also included a visit to the {{USS|Midway|CV-41}}, which was on station at the time in the Indian Ocean, during the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. Mondale was the first vice president to have an office in the White House and established the concept of an "activist Vice President." He began the tradition of weekly lunches with the president, which continues to this day. More importantly, he expanded the vice president's role from figurehead to presidential advisor, full-time participant, and troubleshooter for the administration. Subsequent vice presidents followed this model.<ref>Paul Kengor, ''Wreath Layer or Policy Player: The Vice President's Role in Foreign Policy'' (2000) p. 85</ref> In 1979, [[Twin Cities PBS|Twin Cities Public Television]] produced a documentary about his trip to Norway, titled ''Walter Mondale: There's a [[Fjord]] in Your Past'', a play on the well-known advertising slogan "There's a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in Your Future".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kelter|first=Bill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cRwwnLnP_RcC&pg=PA220|title=Veeps|date=2008|publisher=Top Shelf Productions|isbn=978-1-60309-095-7|pages=220|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Vick|first=Karl|date=June 5, 1979|title='Fjord in Past' sells Mondale's future|page=2C|work=The Minneapolis Star|department=Variety|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/50340565/p-2c/|access-date=May 6, 2020}}</ref>

===1980 election===
{{Further|1976 United States presidential election|1980 United States presidential election}}
[[File:Mondale and Carter.JPG|thumb|Walter Mondale and Jimmy Carter, in front of Presidential helicopter [[Marine One]] in January 1979]]
Carter and Mondale were renominated at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]], but soundly lost to the Republican ticket of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]]. That year, Mondale opened the [[XIII Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Lake Placid, New York]].

Carter and Mondale are the longest-living post-presidential team in American history. On May 23, 2006, they had been out of office for 9,254 days (25 years, 4 months and 3 days), surpassing the former record established by President [[John Adams]] and Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]], both of whom died on July 4, 1826. On September 8, 2012, Carter surpassed [[Herbert Hoover]] as the president with the longest retirement from office. On April 23, 2014, Mondale surpassed [[Richard Nixon]] as the vice president with the longest retirement from office at 12,146 days (33 years, 3 months and 3 days). With [[George H. W. Bush]]'s death on November 30, 2018, Mondale became the [[List of vice presidents of the United States by age#Timeline of oldest living vice presidents|oldest living U.S vice president]] and Carter the [[List of presidents of the United States by age#Oldest living|oldest living U.S. president]].

==Post-vice presidency (1981–present)==
===1984 presidential campaign===
{{Main|1984 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1984 United States presidential election}}
After losing the 1980 election, Mondale returned briefly to the practice of law at [[Winston and Strawn]], a large Chicago-based law firm, but he intended to return to politics before long.

Mondale ran for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1984|Democratic Party presidential nomination]] in the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 election]], and was soon the front-runner. His opposition included Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] and Senator [[Gary Hart]] from [[Colorado]]. Hart won the New Hampshire primary in March, but Mondale had much of the party leadership behind him. To great effect, Mondale used the [[Wendy's]] slogan "[[Where's the beef?]]" to describe Hart's policies as lacking depth. Jackson, widely regarded as the first serious African-American candidate for president, held on longer, but Mondale gained the nomination with the majority of delegates on the first ballot.

[[File:Carter and Mondale celebrate primary victories in Minneapolis, MN. 3-13-84..jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mondale celebrates victories in the 1984 primaries with Carter.]]

At the Democratic Convention, Mondale chose [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Geraldine Ferraro]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] as his running mate, making her the first woman nominated for that position by a major party. Aides later said that Mondale was determined to make a historic choice with his vice presidential candidate, having considered San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] (female and Jewish); Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], an African American; and [[San Antonio]] Mayor [[Henry Cisneros]], a Mexican American, as finalists.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926644,00.html Trying to Win the Peace], by Even Thomas, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.</ref> Others preferred Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]] because he would appeal to the Deep South, or even nomination rival [[Gary Hart]]. Ferraro, as a Catholic, was criticized by some Catholic Church leaders for being [[pro-choice]]. Much more controversy erupted over her changing positions about the release of her husband's tax returns, and her own ethics record in the House. Ferraro was on the defensive throughout much of the campaign, largely negating her breakthrough as the first woman on a major national ticket. She was also the first [[Italian American]] to reach that level in American politics.

When Mondale made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, he said: "By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two‑thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did."<ref name=":0">[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/chicago/facts/famous.speeches/mondale.84.shtml Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984], AllPolitics</ref> While this was meant to show that Mondale would be honest with voters, it was instead largely interpreted as a campaign pledge to raise taxes to spend on domestic programs, which was unappealing to many voters.

[[File:Mondale Ferraro.svg|thumb|One of the logos of the Mondale campaign]]
Mondale ran a [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] campaign, supporting a [[nuclear freeze]] and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). He spoke against [[Reaganomics|Reagan's economic policies]] and in support of reducing federal [[budget deficit]]s. But the incumbent was popular and his campaign was widely considered ineffective. Mondale was also perceived as supporting the poor at the expense of the middle class. Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who [[Reagan Democrat|usually voted Democratic]] supported Reagan because they credited him with the economic boom and saw him as strong on [[national security]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In the first televised debate, Mondale performed unexpectedly well, which led many to question Reagan's age and capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency (Reagan was the oldest person to serve as president—73 at the time—while Mondale was 56). In the next debate on October 21, 1984, Reagan deflected the issue by quipping, "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."

Mondale was defeated in a landslide, receiving 37,577,352 votes (40.6% of the popular vote), and winning only the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] and his home state of Minnesota (even there his margin of victory was fewer than 3,800 votes),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |title=1984 Presidential Election Data—Minnesota |access-date=April 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010711205902/http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |archive-date=July 11, 2001}}</ref> securing only 13 electoral votes to Reagan's 525. The result was the worst electoral college defeat for any Democratic Party candidate in history, and the worst for any major-party candidate since [[Alf Landon]]'s loss to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]].

===Private citizen and ambassador===
Mondale returned to private law practice with [[Dorsey & Whitney]] in Minneapolis in 1987. From 1986 to 1993, he chaired the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]]. During Bill Clinton's presidency, he was [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] from 1993 to 1996, chaired a bipartisan group to study [[campaign finance reform]], and was Clinton's [[Diplomatic rank|special envoy]] to [[Indonesia]] in 1998.

Until his appointment as Ambassador to Japan, Mondale was a Distinguished University Fellow in Law and Public Affairs at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]. In 1990, he established the Mondale Policy Forum at the Humphrey Institute. The forum has brought together leading scholars and policymakers for annual conferences on domestic and international issues. He also served on nonprofit boards of directors for the [[Guthrie Theater]] Foundation, the [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo Foundation]], the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Diogenes Institute of Higher Learning, the Prince Hall Masonic Temple, the [[RAND Corporation]], and the University of Minnesota Foundation. His corporate board memberships included BlackRock Advantage Term Trust and other BlackRock Mutual Funds, [[Cargill]] Incorporated, [[CNA Financial]], the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], First Financial Fund, and other Prudential Mutual Funds, [[Northwest Airlines]], and United HealthCare Corporation.

Mondale spoke before the Senate on September 4, 2002, delivering a lecture on his service, with commentary on the transformation of the office of the Vice President during the Carter administration, the Senate [[cloture]] rule for ending debate, and his view of the future of the Senate. The lecture was a part of a continuing Senate "Leaders Lecture Series" that ran from 1998 to 2002.<ref>

===2002 U.S. Senate election and beyond===
{{Main|2002 United States Senate elections|2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota}}
[[File:Mondale speech.jpg|thumb|left|Former Vice President Mondale giving a lecture in the Senate in 2002]]
In 2002, Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] from Minnesota, who was running for reelection, died in a [[plane crash]] 11 days before the November 5 election. Mondale replaced Wellstone on the ballot at the urging of Wellstone's relatives. The Senate seat was the one Mondale had held before resigning to become Vice President in 1977.

During his debate with the Republican nominee, former [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]], Mondale emphasized his experience in foreign affairs while painting Coleman as a finger-in-the-wind opportunist. "We have seen you shift around, Norman", Mondale said, alluding to Coleman's past as an antiwar college activist and, more recently, as a Democrat who had changed his party allegiance to the GOP while serving as mayor of St. Paul.

Mondale lost the election, receiving 1,067,246 votes (47.34%) to Coleman's 1,116,697 (49.53%), earning him the unique distinction of having lost a statewide general election in all 50 states as the nominee of a major party (he lost the other 49 in the 1984 presidential election; George McGovern also lost statewide elections in all 50 states, 49 of them as a major party nominee in the 1972 presidential election, but the only statewide election he lost in Massachusetts was the ''primary'' in 1984). Upon conceding defeat, Mondale said, "At the end of what will be my last campaign, I want to say to Minnesota, you always treated me well, you always listened to me."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/mondale-concedes-to-coleman|title=Mondale Concedes to Coleman|publisher=[[Fox News]] |access-date=28 November 2020}}</ref>

In 2004, Mondale became co-chairman of the [[Constitution Project]]'s bipartisan Right to Counsel Committee.<ref>[http://www.constitutionproject.org/righttocounsel/article.cfm?messageID=73&categoryId=6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814000144/http://www.constitutionproject.org/righttocounsel/article.cfm?messageID=73&categoryId=6|date=August 14, 2007}}</ref> He endorsed Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] for president in [[Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|2008]].<ref>[http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=4039] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127223358/http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=4039|date=November 27, 2008}}</ref> On June 3, 2008, following the final primary contests, Mondale endorsed Senator [[Barack Obama]], who had clinched the nomination the previous evening, and won the presidency.

Following the [[2004 United States presidential election|presidential election of 2004]] and the midterm elections of 2006, Mondale is seen talking with [[Al Franken]] about the possibility of the latter running against Coleman for Senate in 2008 in the documentary ''[[Al Franken: God Spoke]]''.<ref>''Al Franken: God Spoke'' at the Internet Movie Database</ref> In the film, Mondale encourages Franken to run, but cautions him, saying that Coleman's allies and the Republican Party would look for anything they could use against him. Franken ultimately ran and won the [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008|2008 Senate election]] by 312 votes, with Coleman contesting the election results until June 30, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/senate/42221767.html|title=Senate recount trial: Judges' ruling is boon to Franken|work=Star Tribune}}</ref> Mondale and Senator [[Amy Klobuchar]] stood with Franken in the [[United States Senate chamber]] when Franken was sworn in on July 7, 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Democrat Franken sworn in as Minnesota senator|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=8024266&page=1|last=Kim|first=Seung Min|date=July 7, 2009|publisher=ABC News|language=en|access-date=May 6, 2020}}</ref>

Mondale then stood again with Senator [[Amy Klobuchar]] when [[Tina Smith]] was sworn in on January 3, 2018. He endorsed Klobuchar for president in February 2019.<ref>https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/government-and-politics/4567736-mondale-backs-klobuchar-bid-former-vp-likes-senators-chances</ref>

==Family and personal life==
His wife, [[Joan Mondale]], was a national advocate for the arts and was the Honorary Chairman of the Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities during the Carter Administration. On February 3, 2014, she died at a hospice in Minneapolis surrounded by members of their family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2014/02/03/news/joan-mondale-obit |title=Joan Mondale, wife of former VP Walter, dies at 83 |publisher=Mprnews.org |date=December 15, 2011 |access-date=February 4, 2014}}</ref>

The Mondales' eldest son [[Ted Mondale|Ted]] is an entrepreneur and the CEO of Nazca Solutions, a technology fulfillment venture. He is also a former Minnesota state senator. In 1998, Ted Mondale unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for Minnesota governor, running as a fiscal moderate who had distanced himself from labor.

The Mondales' daughter, [[Eleanor Mondale|Eleanor]], was a television personality. She also had radio talk shows in [[Chicago]] and a long-running program on [[WCCO (AM)]] in [[Minneapolis]]. She died of brain cancer at her home in Minnesota on September 17, 2011, at age 51.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-mondale-kennedy-obits-story,0,3709527.story |title=Kara Kennedy, Eleanor Mondale dead at 51 |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=September 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918212020/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-mondale-kennedy-obits-story,0,3709527.story |archive-date=September 18, 2011  }}</ref>

Their younger son is William Hall Mondale, former assistant [[Attorney General of Minnesota]] (1990–2000).

Mondale has a residence near [[Lake of the Isles]] in Minneapolis. He is a [[Presbyterian]]. He enjoys fishing, reading [[Shakespeare]] and historical accounts, barbecuing, skiing, watching ''[[Monty Python]]'', and playing tennis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnc.net/norway/Mondale.htm|title=Biography of Walter F. Mondale|work=mnc.net}}</ref>

Mondale has maintained strong ties to the [[University of Minnesota Law School]]. In 2002 the school renamed its building Walter F. Mondale Hall. Mondale has contributed cameo appearances to the law school's annual T.O.R.T. ("Theater of the Relatively Talentless") productions and has allowed his name to be used as the nickname of the school's hockey team: the "Fighting Mondales".

Mondale has deep connections to his ancestral [[Norway]]. Upon entering the Senate in 1964, he took over the seat of vice president [[Hubert Humphrey]], another [[Norwegian Americans|Norwegian-American]]. In later years, Mondale served on the executive committee of the Peace Prize Forum, an annual conference co-sponsored by the [[Norwegian Nobel Institute]] and five Midwestern colleges of Norwegian heritage. During Norway's Centennial Celebration in 2005, he chaired the committee to promote and develop cultural activities between Norway and Norwegian-American organizations.

On December 5, 2007, Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Jonas Gahr Støre]] announced that Mondale would be named Honorary Consul-General of Norway, representing the Norwegian state in Minnesota.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/ud/Press-Contacts/News/2007/mondale_gc.html?id=493351|title=Walter Mondale to be new Consul General in Minneapolis|work=Government.no}}</ref>

In 2015, Mondale, who lost both his wife and daughter to brain diseases, was awarded the Public Leadership in Neurology Award from the [[American Academy of Neurology]] for raising awareness for brain health.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Former Vice President Walter Mondale Receives Public Leadership in Neurology Award|url=https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/1374|access-date=2020-11-20|website=www.aan.com}}</ref>

==People who have portrayed Mondale in visual media==
* [[Bill Murray]] played Mondale on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the late 1970s, as did [[Gary Kroeger]], [[Dana Carvey]], and [[Jon Lovitz]] in the mid‑1980s.
* In the 1998 [[HBO]] miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', Mondale is portrayed by [[John Slattery]].
