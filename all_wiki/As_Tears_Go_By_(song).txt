"'''As Tears Go By'''" is a song written by [[Jagger/Richards|Mick Jagger, Keith Richards]], and [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones']] manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]]. [[Marianne Faithfull]] recorded and released it as a single in the United Kingdom in 1964. Her song peaked at number nine on both the UK and Irish singles charts. Later, the Rolling Stones recorded their own version, which was included on the American album ''[[December's Children (And Everybody's)]]''.  [[London Records]] released it as a single, which reached number six in the ''Billboard'' [[Hot 100]] singles chart.<ref name=pc38>{{Pop Chronicles|38|3|Mick Jagger}}</ref>

==History==
"As Tears Go By" was one of the first original compositions by Jagger and Richards; previously the Rolling Stones had chiefly been performing American blues and R&B tunes. By one account, Rolling Stones manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] locked Jagger and Richards in a kitchen in order to force them to write a song together, even suggesting what type of song he wanted: "I want a song with brick walls all around it, high windows and no sex." The result was initially named "As Time Goes By", the title of the song [[Dooley Wilson]] sings in the film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''. It was Oldham who replaced "Time" with "Tears".
{{quote|We thought, what a terrible piece of tripe.  We came out and played it to Andrew [Oldham], and he said "It's a hit." We actually sold this stuff, and it actually made money. Mick and I were thinking, this is money for old rope!<ref>Richards, Keith (2010), ''Life,'' p. 172</ref>}}

According to Jagger biographer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], the song was mainly created by Jagger, in co-operation with session guitarist [[Big Jim Sullivan]].<ref>Philip Norman, Mick Jagger, biography, 2012, p. 143, Dutch translation</ref> Oldham subsequently gave the ballad (a format that the Stones were not yet known for) to Faithfull, then 17, for her to record as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. Oldham played a demo for her with Jagger singing and Big Jim Sullivan on acoustic guitar. "He handed me a scrawled lyric sheet and I went back into the studio and did it. As soon as I heard the [[cor anglais]] playing the opening bars I knew it was going to work. After a couple of takes it was done. Andrew came and gave me a big hug. 'Congratulations darling. You've got yourself a number six,' he said."

The success of the recording caused [[Decca Records]] to switch the song to an A-side, where it became a popular single. The melody features a distinctive [[oboe]] line.<ref>Everett, Walter, 2009, ''The Foundations of Rock : From "Blue Suede Shoes" to "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes"'', Oxford: [[OUP]], {{ISBN|0-1953-102-41}} p. 95</ref> It reached number nine in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and launched Faithfull's career as a major singer.  The song entered the [[Billboard Hot 100]] the week ending 28 November 1964, where it stayed for nine weeks peaking at number 22. In Canada, it peaked at number two on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' chart.<ref name="Muziek Expres">{{cite web |url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.5573&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.5573.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.5573|title=RPM Magazine |work=RPM Weekly|date=2013-07-17 }}</ref> Faithfull performed the song on the television show ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]'', in the segment presented by [[The Beatles|Beatles]] manager [[Brian Epstein]] from London.

It is unclear if the song was written especially for Faithfull or an out-take from the Stones' repertoire. Author Mark Hodkinson writes in his biography ''As Tears Go By'' that she contradicts herself. "All that stuff about how Mick wrote it for me was awfully nice but untrue" she told ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' in 1980, writes Hodkinson. "Ten years later, on the sleeve notes for the ''[[Blazing Away]]'' album Marianne contradicted herself by referring to the record as "the song that Mick Jagger and Keith Richard wrote for me," concludes Hodkinson.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

However, in her own autobiography, ''Faithfull'' (1994), written together with David Dalton, she says "'As Tears Go By' was not, contrary to popular folklore, written for me, but it fitted me so perfectly it might as well had been". Originally, the A-side of her first record should have been a song written by Lionel Bart, "I Don't Know (How To Tell You)." But that song was "awful", she writes. "It was one of those showbiz songs that needed the proper register.  My voice was just plain wrong! We did take after agonizing take{{nbsp}}... but I could not simply do it. In desperation Andrew got me to try the song that originally had been planned for the B-side, 'As Tears Go By'."

She admits that she "was never that crazy about 'As Tears Go By.'" "God knows how Mick and Keith wrote it or where it came from{{nbsp}}... In any case, it is an absolutely astonishing thing for a boy of 20 to have written a song about a woman looking back nostalgically on her life."

The Rolling Stones recorded their own version of "As Tears Go By" in 1965, changing the arrangement from Faithful's 1964 version: her 1964 version features percussion and strings throughout; the Rolling Stones' version completely lacks percussion and opens with acoustic guitar followed by strings entering in the second verse.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The string [[arrangement]] on the Stones' version was done by [[Mike Leander]].

"As Tears Go By" was one of the three songs (including "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]" and "[[19th Nervous Breakdown]]") that the band performed live during their third appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. It was released as a single in December 1965 by their North American record label, [[London Records]], due to popular demand after radio DJs across the country started playing it from the band's recently released album ''[[December's Children (And Everybody's)]]''. It peaked at number six on the American [[Billboard Hot 100]], and at number 10 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Easy Listening chart, years before the seemingly more wholesome Beatles would see their first entry. The song was later released in the UK in 1966 as the B-side to the single, "19th Nervous Breakdown".

The Stones released a version with Italian lyrics as a single in Italy, under the title "Con Le Mie Lacrime"<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Prato|first1= Paolo|year= 2007|title= Selling Italy by the sound: cross-cultural interchanges through cover records|journal= Popular Music|volume= 26|issue= 3|pages= 441â€“462|doi= 10.1017/S0261143007001377|url= https://zenodo.org/record/1021387}}</ref> with the lyrics written by [[:it:Danpa|Danpa]].

The song was performed live on tour for the first time in November 2005 on the Stones' [[A Bigger Bang Tour]]. A performance from the 2006 leg of the tour was captured for the 2008 concert film ''[[Shine a Light (film)|Shine a Light]]'' and the accompanying [[Shine a Light (The Rolling Stones album)|soundtrack album]]. On 11 July in Milan the Stones performed it with the Italian lyrics.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nme.com/news/rolling-stones/23578|title= The Rolling Stones cover The White Stripes! |author= |date= 12 July 2006|work= NME News|publisher= New Musical Express|accessdate=  7 April 2011}}</ref> The song was performed as a duet between Jagger and [[Taylor Swift]] on 3 June 2013 at the [[United Center]] in Chicago, Illinois, for the band's [[50 & Counting]] tour.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/taylor-swift-joins-rolling-stones-for-as-tears-go-by-20130604 |title=Taylor Swift Joins Rolling Stones for 'As Tears Go By' |last=Blistein |first=Jon |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=4 June 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref>
