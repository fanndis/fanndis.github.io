The '''[[2019 United Kingdom general election]]''' was held on Thursday 12 December 2019,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50229318 |title=UK set for 12 December general election |date=29 October 2019 |via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> two-and-a-half years after the previous [[2017 United Kingdom general election|general election in June 2017]]. The Scottish National Party (SNP) received the most votes (45%, up 8.1% from the previous election) and won 48{{refn|name=hanvey|group=n|Includes [[Neale Hanvey]], who was suspended from the party at the time of his election and thus took his seat as an independent.}} out of 59 seats — a gain of 13 over those won in 2017, and 81% of the Scottish seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].<ref>{{cite news |accessdate=2019-12-13 |title=Sturgeon says SNP landslide 'mandate for indyref2' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50766014 |date=2019-12-13 |via=www.bbc.com}}</ref>

SNP gains came at the expense of both Labour and the Conservatives. The Tories remained the largest unionist party in Scotland even though they lost more than half of their Scottish seats, winning six compared to thirteen in 2017. Labour was reduced to only one seat, down from seven. The Liberal Democrats managed to win four Scottish seats for no net change, although party leader [[Jo Swinson]] (herself the only major party leader to stand for election in Scotland) was unseated in her bid for re-election by her SNP challenger.

Labour’s vote share was its lowest at a Westminster election in Scotland since December 1910.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/14986/analysis-gathering-storm-why-2020-set-be-year-tension-between-edinburgh-and-london|title=Analysis: Gathering storm – why 2020 is set to be a year of tension between Edinburgh and London|last=Jamieson|first=David|date=17 December 2019|website=CommonSpace|accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.scot/news/18110549.london-looking-scotland-anew-envy-hope-future/|title=Lesley Riddoch: London is looking at Scotland with envy|last=Riddoch|first=Lesley|date=19 December 2019|website=The National|accessdate=21 December 2019|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

==Political context==
The [[2017 United Kingdom general election|June 2017 general election]] in [[Scotland]] was fought in the aftermath of the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]], in which the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] won a third term in government but lost its overall majority in the Scottish Parliament. The [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 EU referendum]] was held a month later on Thursday 23 June, and the final result was for the United Kingdom to leave the EU, despite Scotland voting 62.0% Remain. Negotiations then began after the [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union]] in March 2017, which was expected to dominate the snap general election campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/britain-gears-up-for-one-issue-election-1492536807 |title=Brexit Set to Dominate U.K.'s Snap Election |last=Fidler |first=Stephen |date=18 April 2017 |work=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref> At the 2017 general election the SNP remained the largest party, but their number of seats was much reduced, while the [[Scottish Conservatives]] increased their number of MPs, overtaking [[Scottish Labour|Labour]] as the second largest party.

In the [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2019 European Parliament election]], Scottish Labour lost its two MEPs, the SNP increased its number to three, the Scottish Conservatives held theirs and the [[Brexit Party]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] gained one each.
