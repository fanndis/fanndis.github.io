In the [[United States Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] and [[United States Space Force|U.S. Space Force]], '''lieutenant colonel''' is a [[field grade officer]] rank, just above the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]] and just below the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. It is equivalent to the naval rank of [[Commander (United States)|commander]] in the other [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]].

The [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades|pay grade]] for the rank of lieutenant colonel is O-5. In the United States armed forces, the insignia for the rank are a silver oak leaf, with slight stylized differences between the version of the Army and the Air Force and that of the Navy and the Marine Corps.

Promotion to lieutenant colonel is governed by Department of Defense policies derived from the [[Defense Officer Personnel Management Act]] (DOPMA) of 1980, for officers in the Active Component, and its companion Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA), for officers in the Reserve Component (e.g., Reserve and [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]). DOPMA guidelines suggest that 70 percent of majors be promoted to lieutenant colonel after serving at least three years at their present rank and after 15–17 years of cumulative commissioned service.

==Etymology==
The U.S. Army uses the three letter abbreviation "LTC," while the Marine Corps and Air Force use the abbreviations of "LtCol" and "Lt Col" (note the space), respectively.  These abbreviation formats are also outlined in ''The Naval Institute Guide to Naval Writing''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shenk |first1=Robert |title=The Naval Institute Guide to Naval Writing |date=2008 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Md. |isbn=978-1-59114-822-7 |edition=3rd}}</ref> and in Air Force Handbook 33-337 (AFH 33-337), ''The Tongue and Quill''.<ref>https://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/saf_cn/publication/afh33-337/afh33-337.pdf</ref>

The [[United States Government Publishing Office]] recommends the abbreviation "LTC" for U.S. Army usage, "LtCol" for Marine Corps usage, and "Lt.&nbsp;Col." for the Air Force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2008_style_manual&docid=f:chapter9.pdf |title=Preliminary-cloth.indd |format=PDF |accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref> The [[Associated Press Stylebook]] recommends the abbreviation "Lt.&nbsp;Col." for the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jack |url=http://apstylebook.blogspot.com/2009/05/military-titles.html |title=AP Style Book |publisher=Apstylebook.blogspot.com |date=21 May 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref>

[[Slang]] terms for the rank historically used by the U.S. military include "light colonel", "short colonel", "light bird", "half colonel", "bottlecap colonel" (referring to the silver oak leaf insignia), and "telephone colonel" (from self-reference as "colonel" when using a telephone).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In British practice, regiments were actually commanded by their lieutenant colonels, as the [[Colonel (United Kingdom)#History|colonel]] was a titular position <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/060/60-4-1/index.html |title=The Continental Army |publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History |page=48) |date=1 May 1982 |accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref> (with the incumbent absent from the regiment serving as a senior [[Staff (military)|staff officer]], a [[general officer]], or as a [[Colonel-in-chief|member of the nobility]]). Since the British [[Colonel (United Kingdom)#Ceremonial usage|colonel]] was not a "combat" officer, beginning in May 1778 to simplify prisoner of war exchanges, American regiments began to eliminate colonels by attrition and replace them with a lieutenant colonel commandant. The conversion was never completely effected and some regiments remained commanded by colonels throughout the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/060/60-4-1/index.html |title=The Continental Army |publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History |pages=127–128 ff.) |date=1 May 1982 |accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref> From 1784 until 1791, there was only one lieutenant colonel in the US Army ([[Josiah Harmar]]), who acted as the army's commanding officer.

In the Continental Army [[Washington's Aides-de-Camp|aides]] to the [[Commander in Chief#United States|Commander in Chief]], viz., [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George Washington]], were lieutenant colonels. Additionally, certain officers serving under the [[United States Army Adjutant General's Corps|Adjutant General]], [[Structure of the United States Army#The Office of the Inspector General|Inspector General]], and [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|Judge Advocate General]], ranked as lieutenant colonels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/060/60-4-1/index.html |title=The Continental Army |pages=128 & 145) |publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History |date=1 May 1982 |accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>

During the 19th century, lieutenant colonel was often a terminal rank for many officers, since the rank of "full colonel" was considered extremely prestigious reserved only for the most successful officers. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War, the rank of lieutenant colonel became much more common and was used as a "stepping stone" for officers who commanded small [[regiment]]s or [[battalion]]s and were expected, by default, to be promoted to full colonel once the manpower of a regiment grew in strength. Such was the case of [[Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain]], who commanded a Maine regiment as both a lieutenant colonel and later as a colonel.

After the Civil War ended, those officers remaining in the military found lieutenant colonel to again be a terminal rank, although many lieutenant colonels were raised to higher positions in a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] status. Such was the case with [[George Armstrong Custer|George A. Custer]], who was a lieutenant colonel in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]], but held the brevet rank of [[Major General (United States)|major general]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://all-biographies.com/soldiers/george_a_custer.htm |title=Lieutenant-Colonel And Brevet Major-General George A. Custer, U.S.A |website=All-biographies.com |accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/brevetrank.htm |title=Brevet Rank In The Civil War |website=Civilwarhome.com |accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref>

The 20th century saw lieutenant colonel in its present-day status although, during the 1930s, many officers again found the rank to be terminal as the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] was reserved for only a select few officers.

==Modern usage==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2020}}
In the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), a lieutenant colonel typically commands a [[battalion]]- or [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]]-sized unit (300 to 1,200 Soldiers or Marines), with a [[Major (United States)|major]] as [[executive officer]] (XO) and a [[command sergeant major]] or [[sergeant major]] (USMC) as principal [[non-commissioned officer]] (NCO) or [[senior enlisted adviser]] (SEA). A lieutenant colonel may also serve as a [[brigade]]/[[brigade combat team]], [[regiment]]/[[regimental combat team]], [[List of United States Marine Corps aircraft groups|Marine Aviation Group]] (MAG), [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]] (MEU), or battalion [[task force]] [[executive officer]]. Lieutenant colonels routinely serve as principal staff officers, under a colonel as chief of staff, on a [[Staff (military)#Continental staff system|general staff]] ("G" staff) of a [[Division (military)#United States|division]], [[Marine Expeditionary Brigade]] (MEB), [[List of United States Marine Corps aircraft wings|Marine Aircraft Wing]] (MAW), or [[Marine Logistics Group]] (MLG). These staff positions include G-1 (administration and personnel), G-2 (intelligence), G-3 (operations), G-4 (logistics), G-5 (planning), G-6 (computers and communications), G-9 (Civil Affairs). "The G-''n''" may mean either a specific staff section or the staff officer leading a section. Lieutenant colonels may also be junior staff at a variety of higher echelons.

In the [[United States Air Force]], a lieutenant colonel is generally a squadron commander in the operations group, mission support group, or maintenance groups, or a squadron commander or division chief in a medical group. The lieutenant colonel also may serve as a Deputy Commander for Operations (DO) in a squadron in the operations group before assuming command of his or her own squadron (this is common for aeronautically rated officers in flying units), or as a deputy commander of a squadron in the maintenance, mission-support, or medical group. Lieutenant colonels may serve also on general staffs and may be the heads of some wing staff departments. Senior lieutenant colonels occasionally serve as group commanders, most commonly in units of the [[Air Force Reserve Command]] and the [[Air National Guard]].

In U.S. Army [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] detachments, the commander is typically a lieutenant colonel, with several majors, captains, and non-commissioned officers serving as assistants.  In the U.S. Air Force, [[Air Force ROTC]] detachments may be commanded by full colonels or lieutenant colonels, depending on the size of the detachment and the size of the associated college or university.

===Non-military use===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2020}}
The rank of lieutenant colonel is also used by many large American municipal police departments, county sheriff's offices/departments, state highway patrols, state police, and other law-enforcement agencies for officers in senior administrative positions. The rank is not always called "lieutenant colonel"; and in many cases—especially in municipal police agencies—another term, such as "assistant chief" or "commander", is used, and only the insignia are retained. In some organizations, however, especially state police agencies, both the title and insignia are used. Occasionally, the rank is used ''with'', rather than ''instead of'', an official title. For example, in the [[Texas Department of Public Safety]], the head of the agency's patrol division is titled "Chief of the [[Texas Highway Patrol|Highway Patrol]]" but holds the rank of a lieutenant colonel: this officer therefore is called "lieutenant colonel," not "chief".
