'''Rahul Gandhi''' ({{audio|Rahul Rajiv Gandhi.ogg|pronunciation}} {{IPA-hns|ˈraːɦʊl ˈɡaːnd̪ʱi|}}) (born 19 June 1970) is an Indian politician and a  [[member of the Indian Parliament]], representing the constituency of [[Wayanad (Lok Sabha constituency)|Wayanad]], [[Kerala]] in the [[17th Lok Sabha]]. A member of the [[Indian National Congress]], he served as the [[List of Presidents of the Indian National Congress|President of the Indian National Congress]] from 16 December 2017 to 3 July 2019. Gandhi is the chairperson of the [[Indian Youth Congress]] and the [[National Students Union of India]]. He is also a [[trustee]] of [[Rajiv Gandhi Foundation]] and [[Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust]].

Born in [[New Delhi]], Gandhi spent his early childhood between Delhi and Dehradun and stayed away from the [[public sphere]] for much of his childhood and early youth. He attained primary education in [[New Delhi]] and [[Dehradun]] but was later [[homeschool]]ed because of security concerns. Gandhi began his undergraduate career at [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi|St. Stephens college]] before moving to [[Harvard University]]. Gandhi transferred to [[Rollins College]] in Florida due to security threats following his father’s, the late Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]]’s, assassination. He graduated in 1994, the year after Gandhi obtained M.Phil. from  [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Cambridge]]. After graduation, Gandhi began his professional career with the [[Monitor Group]], a management consulting firm in London. He soon returned to India and established the Mumbai-based technology outsourcing firm, Backops Services Private Ltd.

In 2004, Gandhi announced to enter in active politics and successfully contested the [[2004 Indian general elections|general elections held that year]] from Amethi, a seat that was earlier held by his father; he won again from the constituency in [[2009 Indian general elections|2009]] and [[2014 Indian general elections|2014]]. Amidst calls from Congress party veterans for his greater involvement in party politics and national government, Gandhi was elected Congress Vice-President in 2013, having served as the General Secretary previously. Rahul Gandhi led [[Indian National Congress campaign for Indian general election, 2014|the INC's campaign in the 2014 Indian general elections]]; the party suffered its worst electoral result in its history, winning only 44 seats compared to 206 seats won previously in the 2009 general election.

===Indian general election (2009) ===
In the [[2009 Lok Sabha elections]], Gandhi retained his Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival by a margin of over 370,000 votes.

In May 2011, Rahul Gandhi was arrested by the [[Uttar Pradesh Police]] at Bhatta Parsaul village after he turned out in support of [[2011 land acquisition protests in Uttar Pradesh|agitating farmers]] demanding more compensation for their land being acquired for a highway project.

In December 2010 during the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]], [[WikiLeaks]] leaked a cable dated 3 August 2009, where the Prime Minister of India, [[Manmohan Singh]] had hosted a lunch on 20 July 2009 for Rahul Gandhi, then the General Secretary of the AICC. One of the guests who was invited for the lunch was the [[United States Ambassador to India]], [[Timothy J. Roemer]]. In a "candid conversation" with Roemer, he said that he believes [[Hindu]] [[extremists]] pose a greater threat to his country than [[Muslim]] militants. Rahul Gandhi referred specifically to more-polarising figures in the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]. Also responding to the ambassador's query about the activities in the region by the [[Islam]]ist militant organisation [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT), Rahul Gandhi said there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India's indigenous [[Islam in India|Muslim]] population.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reaching Out to Rahul Gandhi and Other Young Parliamentarians|url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09NEWDELHI1624|work=Wikileaks|accessdate=10 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Copy of diplomatic cable dated | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/219238|title=US Embassy Cables: Ambassador Warned That Radical Hindu Groups May Pose Bigger Threat Than LeT in India|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 December 2010|accessdate=17 December 2010|location=London}}</ref> In a response to this, the BJP heavily criticised Rahul Gandhi for his statements. BJP spokesperson [[Ravi Shankar Prasad]] slammed Rahul Gandhi, saying that his language was a bigger threat to India, dividing the people of the country on communal grounds. Speaking to reporters, Prasad said, "In one stroke Mr. Rahul Gandhi has sought to give a big leverage to the propaganda to all the extremist and terrorist groups in [[Pakistan]], and also some segments of Pakistani establishment. It would also seriously compromise India's fight against terror as also our strategic security. "Adding that terrorism has no religion, he said that Rahul Gandhi had shown his lack of understanding India.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rahul Gandhi Responds to WikiLeaks Controversy on Hindu Extremism Remarks|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/wikileaks-revelations/rahul-gandhi-responds-to-wikileaks-controversy-on-hindu-extremism-remarks-73162|accessdate=10 January 2011|newspaper=NDTV|date=17 December 2010}}</ref> Gandhi has also been critical of groups like the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]] and has compared them to terrorist organisations like [[Students Islamic Movement of India|SIMI]].<ref name="Isfanatical">[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/RSS-is-fanatical-like-banned-outfit-SIMI--Rahul/articleshow/6699305.cms RSS is 'fanatical' like banned outfit SIMI: Rahul].

===Lokpal===
Rahul Gandhi opines that the [[Lokpal]] should be made a constitutional body and it should be made accountable to the Parliament, just like the Election Commission of India. He also feels that Lokpal alone cannot root out corruption. This statement came out on 25 August 2011, on the 10th day of [[Anna Hazare]]'s fast. This statement was considered as a delaying tactic by the opposition and [[Team Anna]]'s members. It was consequently slammed by prominent opposition leaders [[Sushma Swaraj]] and [[Arun Jaitley]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Sulekha news|date=27 August 2011|url=http://post.jagran.com/Sushma-tears-into-Rahuls-address-on-Lokpal-others-appeal-Anna-to-end-fast-1314441531|title=Sushma tears into Rahul's address on Lokpal|accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> The Parliamentary Standing Committee led by Abhishek Manu Singhvi tabled the [[Jan Lokpal Bill]] report in the Rajya Sabha on 9 December 2011. The report recommended the Lokpal to be made into a constitutional body. In response, Hazare attacked Rahul Gandhi, claiming he had made the bill "weak and ineffective".<ref>{{cite news |author= DNA correspondent |date=9 December 2011 |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_anna-hazare-blames-rahul-gandhi-for-ineffective-lokpal-bill_1623889|title=Anna Hazare blames Rahul Gandhi for 'ineffective' Lokpal Bill|accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>
