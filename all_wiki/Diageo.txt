==Controversies==
[[File:JohnnieWalker2012.jpg|thumb|right|Diageo received major backlash from the public and the [[Scottish Government]] following the decision to close Johnnie Walker production in Kilmarnock, Scotland, the birthplace of the brand's founder and production hub since 1820]]
In December 2003, Diageo provoked controversy over its decision to change its [[Cardhu]] brand Scotch whisky from a [[Single malt Scotch|single malt]] to a [[blended malt]] whilst retaining the original name and bottle style. Diageo took this action because it did not have sufficient reserves to meet demand in the Spanish market, where Cardhu had been successful. After a meeting of producers, Diageo agreed to make changes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Whiskey packaging whips up controversy |url=http://www.beveragedaily.com/news/ng.asp?id=48233-whisky-packaging-whips |website=Beverage Daily |access-date=5 December 2003}}</ref> In 2006, the Cardhu brand changed back to being a single malt.<ref>{{cite web |title=Scottish Whisky: Cardhu |url=http://www.scotchwhisky.net/distilleries/cardhu.htm |website=Scotchwhisky.net |access-date=18 April 2011}}</ref>

In July 2009, Diageo announced that, after nearly 200 years of association with the town of [[Kilmarnock]], Scotland, they would be closing the [[Johnnie Walker]] blending and bottling plant<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.packaging-gateway.com/projects/diageobottling/ |title=Diageo Bottling Plant Refurbishment |publisher=Packaging-gateway.com |access-date=18 April 2011}}</ref> as part of restructuring to the business. This would make 700 workers unemployed and caused outrage from press, local people and politicians. A campaign against this decision was launched by the local [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] MSP [[Willie Coffey]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Des Browne]]. A petition was drawn up against the plans, which also involved the closure of the historic [[Port Dundas]] grain distillery in Glasgow.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.savejohnniewalker.org |title=Kilmarnock Town fights to protect their heritage |publisher=Savejohnniewalker.org |access-date=18 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129045513/http://www.savejohnniewalker.org/ |archive-date=29 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
