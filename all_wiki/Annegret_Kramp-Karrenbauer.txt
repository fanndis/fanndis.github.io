[[File:KAS-Kramp-Karrenbauer, Annegret-Bild-2610-6.jpg|thumb|left|Election poster for Kramp-Karrenbauer's 1994 candidacy in Saarland]]
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer joined the CDU while still in high school in 1981. In 1984 she was elected to the [[city council]] of [[Püttlingen]], and in 1985 became chairwoman of the city's CDU association. From 1985 to 1988 she was also a member of the regional board of the [[Young Union]] in Saarland. From 1991 to 1998 she served as a policy and planning officer for the CDU in Saarland under environment minister [[Klaus Töpfer]]. In 1998, Kramp-Karrenbauer replaced another member in the federal [[Bundestag]], serving seven months before losing that seat in the [[1998 German federal election|national elections]] the same year.<ref name="auto"/> In 1999, she was an advisor to [[Peter Müller (politician)|Peter Müller]], then chairman of the CDU parliamentary group in the [[Landtag of Saarland]] and later Minister-President. That same year she became a chairwoman of the [[Women's Union]].

===Minister and Minister-President, 1999–2018===
Kramp-Karrenbauer was elected to the [[Landtag of Saarland]] in 1999. She served as Minister of the Interior in the government of Peter Müller; the first woman to hold that office in Germany.<ref name="spiegel.de">Siobhán Dowling (25 January 2011), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/letter-from-berlin-germany-s-new-generation-of-female-political-leaders-a-741348.html Letter from Berlin: Germany's New Generation of Female Political Leaders] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.</ref> She took on more responsibilities in 2004, and changed roles in 2007 following a cabinet reshuffle, becoming Minister of Education and again in 2009, becoming Minister of Labor in the so-called [[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition government]]. In 2008, she was elected chairwoman of the ''[[Kultusministerkonferenz]]''. Throughout her time in state government, she also served at various times as minister responsible for women, sports, family, and culture.<!--uncontroversial and verifiable, inferred from German article, but needs citation--> In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] following the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal election]], Kramp-Karrenbauer was part of the CDU–CSU delegation in the working group on education and research policy, led by [[Annette Schavan]] and [[Andreas Pinkwart]].

In 2011, after months of difficult negotiations with the coalition partners, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] and [[Alliance 90/The Greens|The Greens]], Kramp-Karrenbauer was elected Minister-President of the Saarland in a special session of parliament, replacing Müller, who resigned to become a judge at the [[Federal Constitutional Court]].<ref name="spiegel.de"/> Shortly afterwards, she ended the coalition and triggered an election, blaming the party for "dismantling itself" and arguing that the three-party coalition had lost the necessary "trust, stability, and capacity to act".<ref name="bloomberg.com">Anthony Czuczka and Brian Parkin (16 April 2012), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-04-15/merkel-seen-turning-to-euro-bond-backing-spd-to-secure-2013-win Merkel Seen Turning to Euro Bond-Backing SPD to Win in 2013] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> Kramp-Karrenbauer and the CDU won the [[2012 Saarland state election|state election]] soon afterwards, in what was widely regarded as the first electoral test of Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]'s crisis-fighting policy since the beginning of the [[European debt crisis]];<ref>Anthony Czuczka and Brian Parkin (26 March 2012), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-03-25/merkel-s-cdu-wins-saarland-elections-zdf-exit-poll-shows Merkel’s Party Wins Saarland State in Show of Crisis Backing] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> meanwhile, the FDP was ejected from the state parliament after taking just 1.2% of the vote.<ref name="bloomberg.com"/>
Under Kramp-Karrenbauer’s leadership, the CDU won 40.7% of the vote in the [[2017 Saarland state election|2017 state elections]], up from 35.2% in 2012.<ref>Paul Carrel and Hakan Erdem (26 March 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-election-saarland-idUSKBN16X00S Merkel's conservatives win Saarland vote in boost for national campaign] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

While serving as Minister-President, Kramp-Karrenbauer, who speaks French, was also [[France–Germany relations|Commissioner of the Federal Republic of Germany for Cultural Affairs under the Treaty on Franco-German Cooperation]] between 2011 and 2014. She continued to be a member of the German-French Friendship Group that was set up by the upper chambers of the German and French national parliaments, respectively the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] and the [[Senate (France)|Senate]]. Furthermore, as one of the state's representatives at the federal Bundesrat, she served on the Committee on Cultural Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Defence. Kramp-Karrenbauer was a CDU delegate to the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] to elect the [[president of Germany]] in 2012 and in 2017. She was also for a short time part of the CDU–CSU delegation's leadership team in the negotiations to form a "[[Große Koalition|grand coalition]]" following the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal elections]]. She again played a role in the negotiations to form a [[Fourth Merkel cabinet|fourth]] coalition government under Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2018, leading a working group on education policy alongside [[Stefan Müller (politician)|Stefan Müller]], [[Manuela Schwesig]] and [[Hubertus Heil]].

As Minister-President of Saarland, Kramp-Karrenbauer promoted the French language, aiming to make the state fully bilingual in German and French and thus promote Saarland as a bicultural European region similar to neighbouring [[Luxembourg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.faz.net/1.2764278|title=Zweisprachigkeit im Saarland: Kramp-Karrenbauers Frankreich-Coup|first=Thomas|last=Holl|access-date=9 December 2018|via=www.faz.net|archive-date=17 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117154505/https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/zweisprachigkeit-im-saarland-kramp-karrenbauers-frankreich-coup-12764278.html|url-status=live}}</ref> While Saarland had rejoined Germany five years before Kramp-Karrenbauer's birth when a majority voted against becoming an independent state, it has a long history of association with France dating back to the late 18th century.

===Secretary General of the CDU, 2018===
In February 2018, Merkel nominated Kramp-Karrenbauer as the new secretary general of the CDU.<ref name="auto1"/> She was confirmed at the CDU party conference on 26 February, securing 98.87% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/cdu-parteitag-kramp-karrenbauer-mit-grosser-mehrheit-zur-cdu-generalsekretaerin-gewaehlt-1.3883118|title=Kramp-Karrenbauer mit großer Mehrheit zur CDU-Generalsekretärin gewählt|first1=Barbara Galaktionow, Sebastian Gierke, Matthias|last1=Kolb|first2=Benedikt|last2=Peters|date=26 February 2018|via=Sueddeutsche.de}}</ref> As secretary general, she managed the party and oversaw its election campaigns.<ref>Patrick Donahue and Arne Delfs (19 February 2018), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-19/merkel-names-loyalist-to-key-party-post-amid-succession-rumors Merkel Sets Up Potential Successor With Key Party Appointment] [[Bloomberg News]].</ref> She also embarked on a major listening tour of the country, holding more than 40 meetings with local CDU associations and working on a new political manifesto for the party.<ref>{{cite news | first=Guy | last=Chazan | date=7 November 2018 | url=https://www.ft.com/content/b53b81e4-e268-11e8-8e70-5e22a430c1ad | title=Merkel's favoured successor declares new chapter | newspaper=[[Financial Times]]}}</ref>

===2018 CDU leadership election===
In October 2018, following bad results for the CDU/CSU in state elections in [[2018 Bavarian state election|Bavaria]] and [[2018 Hessian state election|Hesse]], Chancellor Merkel announced she would not stand for re-election as party leader in the CDU convention at the end of the year, triggering a [[2018 Christian Democratic Union of Germany leadership election|leadership election]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/29/europe/angela-merkel-germany-election-intl/index.html|title=Angela Merkel says she will not seek re-election as German Chancellor|date=2018-10-29|work=CNN International}}</ref> Former Bundestag leader of the CDU and businessman [[Friedrich Merz]] jumped into the race immediately while Health Minister [[Jens Spahn]] and Kramp-Karrenbauer announced their bids shortly after. Kramp-Karrenbauer was perceived to be Merkel's chosen heir and a continuation of her style and centrist ideology while Merz was an old rival from Merkel's early days as party leader and was very open about his intention to move the party in a more conservative direction. Nevertheless, the Chancellor did not state her preferences.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/world/europe/germany-conservatives-angela-merkel.html|title=Who Will Replace Angela Merkel as German Conservatives' Leader?|last=Eddy|first=Melissa|date=2018-12-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

As the vote approached, opinion polls showed that Kramp-Karrenbauer was favoured by CDU voters and the general public alike. The contest was held on 7 December and after coming out on top in the first round, Kramp-Karrenbauer narrowly defeated Merz in a run-off, becoming the new leader of the CDU.<ref name="faz1">{{cite news |title=Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer ist neue Vorsitzende der CDU |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/liveblog-die-cdu-waehlt-einen-neuen-vorsitzenden-15929379.html|language=de |access-date=7 December 2018 |publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|date=7 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Merkel's choice elected ruling party leader |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46487246 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=7 December 2018 |date=7 December 2018}}</ref>

===Leader of the CDU, 2018–present===
In the immediate aftermath of her election, surveys showed an increase in the CDU's vote share; however, it was short-lived. In the first months of her tenure, there were a series of gaffes and according to the press a failure to connect with voters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/1.6075636|title=Politischer Aschermittwoch: Der Gegenangriff der AKK|last1=Lohse|first1=Eckart|access-date=2019-06-22|last2=Wyssuwa|first2=Matthias|language=de|issn=0174-4909|last3=Demmin|journal=Frankfurter Allgemeine Magazin|archive-date=17 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117154451/https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/cdu-vorsitzende-annegret-kramp-karrenbauer-reagiert-auf-kritik-16075636.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In the run-up to the [[2019 European Parliament election]], which was seen as her first major electoral test, the CDU's campaign was embroiled by a row between the party and [[YouTube]] personality [[Rezo]]. It was caused by a viral YouTube video posted by Rezo in which he called out{{clarify|date=February 2020}} the parties of the governing Grand Coalition (CDU/CSU and SPD) and urged viewers not to vote for them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20190523/how-a-youtuber-is-shaking-up-german-politics-with-controversial-video|title=German YouTuber shakes up mainstream politics with viral video|date=2019-05-23|website=www.thelocal.de|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref> Kramp-Karrenbauer reacted, stating that the electoral law should be changed to prevent social media personalities like Rezo from influencing the voters' choice in the midst of a campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/akk-ueber-rezo---ein-schlag-ins-gesicht-von-menschen--die-sich-fuer-dieses-land-engagieren---8729422.html|title=Die Frage stellt sich mit Blick auf Meinungsmache: Was sind eigentlich die Regeln?|date=2019-05-27|website=stern.de|language=de|access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref> The statement was harshly criticized as an attack on freedom of expression and damaged the image of Kramp-Karrenbauer among young people.

The European Elections resulted in the CDU's worst national showing ever, below 30%. After the underwhelming result, rumors emerged that some CDU politicians planned to shun Kramp-Karrenbauer and put up another Chancellor candidate for the next Bundestag election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.noz.de/deutschland-welt/politik/artikel/1770445/laschet-cdu-hat-mehrere-kandidaten-mit-kanzlerformat|title=Diskussion um AKK: Laschet: CDU hat mehrere Kandidaten mit Kanzlerformat|last=dpa|website=NOZ|access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref> Tilman Meyer, a political scientist at [[University of Bonn]], told ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' that the mounting pressure on Kramp-Karrenbauer could lead to the CDU going into the next election with a more conservative candidate such as [[Friedrich Merz]], a former CDU parliamentary leader, in response to the rise of the far-right.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/29/doubts-over-angela-merkel-successor-ahead-of-german-elections|title=Pressure mounts on Merkel's heir apparent before state elections|date=2019-08-29|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2019-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/08/28/germanys-far-right-is-creeping-ever-closer-to-power-afd-merkel-saxony-brandenburg/|title=Germany's Far-Right Is Creeping Ever Closer to Power|date=2019-08-28|website=[[Foreign Policy]]|access-date=2019-09-16}}</ref>

Kramp-Karrenbauer announced her resignation as leader of the CDU on 10 February 2020 as a result of the [[2020 Thuringian government crisis]]. The former plan was that she would resign in the summer and her successor would be [[2021 Christian Democratic Union of Germany leadership election|elected]], but this was postponed to December due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51441993|title=Favourite to replace Merkel stands down|date=2020-02-10|website=[[BBC News]]|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-01|title=Backroom bravado: Who will succeed Angela Merkel|url=http://www.german-times.com/backroom-bravado-who-will-succeed-angela-merkel/|access-date=2020-10-24|website=The German Times|language=en-US}}</ref>{{Update|date=October 2020}}

Kramp-Karrenbauer is perceived as a moderate<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/world/europe/germany-cdu-annegret-kramp-karrenbauer.html|title=Merkel's Party Picks Successor in Her Image: Wry, Moderate and a Woman|first1=Katrin|last1=Bennhold|first2=Melissa|last2=Eddy|date=7 December 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> or centrist Christian Democrat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/angela-merkels-cdu-successor-annegret-kramp-karrenbauer/a-46622513|title=Angela Merkel's CDU successor: Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer – DW – 07.12.2018|website=DW.COM}}</ref> She has been described as socially conservative, but on the CDU's left wing in economic policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/merkel-successor-annegret-kramp-karrenbauer-friedrich-merz-jens-spahn-could-change-the-political-landscape-or-not/|title=How Merkel's successor could change the political landscape (or not)|publisher=Politico|author=Emma Anderson|date=6 December 2018|access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref> She is regarded as more conservative than Angela Merkel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article185188372/USA-Fuer-viele-Amerikaner-ist-Merkel-schon-Geschichte.html|title=USA: Für viele Amerikaner ist Merkel schon Geschichte|first=Daniel Friedrich|last=Sturm|date=8 December 2018|access-date=9 December 2018|via=www.welt.de}}</ref> Nevertheless, in the German press, her often used nickname is "Mini-Merkel", reflecting both her size and her political views.

Kramp-Karrenbauer opposes [[same sex marriage]], having compared it to [[incest]] and [[polygamy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20150603/state-leader-equates-gay-marriage-with-incest|title=State leader equates gay marriage with incest|date=3 June 2015|website=www.thelocal.de|access-date=9 December 2018}}</ref> However, when the [[Mayor of Hamburg]] [[Olaf Scholz]] submitted a motion for a mandatory gender quota for supervisory boards to the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] in 2012, Kramp-Karrenbauer joined the state governments controlled by the Social Democrats (the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]), voting in favour of the draft legislation; in doing so, she supported an initiative opposed by Merkel and state governments controlled by the CDU.<ref>Markus Dettmer, Peter Müller and René Pfister (23 April 2013), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-labor-minister-ursula-von-der-leyen-stands-up-to-merkel-a-895940.html Rebel in the Ranks: Gutsy Minister Gives Glimpse of Life After Merkel] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.</ref>

Amid her party's campaign for the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal elections]], Kramp-Karrenbauer suggested Germany return to a top income tax rate of more than 53%, setting off a fierce debate in her party. In her view, Merkel's predecessor [[Gerhard Schröder]] had gone too far in reducing the top rate from 53% to 42% in the 1990s.<ref>Noah Barkin (24 March 2013), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/24/us-germany-merkel-taxes-idUSBRE92N0BJ20130324 Merkel ally backs double-digit hike in top tax rate] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> In May 2014, she was among leading members of Merkel's CDU who called for reductions to offset fiscal drag—the automatic increases in the tax-take that occur as inflation and income growth push wage-earners further into their marginal higher tax-bracket.<ref>Stefan Wagstyl (8 May 2014), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1efb3060-d6c6-11e3-b95e-00144feabdc0.html Angela Merkel sees no ‘room for manoeuvre’ on tax cuts] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

When the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] ruled in favour of tax equality for same-sex couples in 2013, Kramp-Karrenbauer voiced her concerns about also granting [[LGBT adoption|full adoption rights for same-sex couples]], stating: "The traditional family unit is the core of not only Germany but all nations".<ref>Melanie Amann, Dietmar Hipp and Peter Müller (11 June 2013), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/gay-adoption-debate-flusters-german-conservatives-a-904875.html Vater and Vater: Gay Adoption Debate Flusters Conservatives] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330073654/http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/gay-adoption-debate-flusters-german-conservatives-a-904875.html |date=30 March 2019 }} ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.</ref> In 2015, she caused a public controversy by arguing that "if we open up [the definition of marriage] to become a long-term responsible partnership between two adults, then other demands can't be ruled out, such as a marriage between close relatives or between more than two people".

Kramp-Karrenbauer criticised the German-supported [[Nord Stream 2]] [[gas pipeline]] that would allow Germany to effectively double the amount of gas it imports from [[Russia]], saying that Nord Stream 2 "is not just an economic project but a political one".<ref>{{cite news |title=Frontrunners to succeed Merkel raise questions over Russian pipeline |url=https://www.ft.com/content/1093d276-f6eb-11e8-8b7c-6fa24bd5409c |work=Financial Times |date=3 December 2018}}</ref> In January 2019, U.S. Ambassador to Germany [[Richard Grenell]] sent letters to German companies involved in the construction of Nord Stream 2, threatening [[Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act|CAATSA sanctions]].<ref>{{cite news |title=US threatens sanctions over Russia-Germany gas pipeline |url=https://www.thelocal.de/20190113/us-threatens-sanctions-over-russia-germany-gas-pipeline |work=The Local |date=13 January 2019}}</ref> In response, Kramp-Karrenbauer stated that "the American ambassador operates in a, shall I say, somewhat unusual diplomatic manner."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-14/merkel-ally-pushes-back-on-trump-envoy-s-russian-pipeline-threat| title=Merkel Ally Pushes Back on Trump Envoy's Russian Pipeline Threat| author=Patrick Donahue| publisher=Bloomberg.com| date=2019-01-14| access-date=2019-01-14}}</ref>

Kramp-Karrenbauer has supported arms exports to [[Saudi Arabia]], which has been [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|waging war in Yemen]] and was condemned for massive [[Human rights in Saudi Arabia|human rights violations]]. Kramp-Karrenbauer accused the Social Democrats (SPD) of jeopardising German industry and jobs,<ref>{{cite news |title=German conservative leader takes aim at SPD over Saudi arms embargo: media |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-saudi-arms/german-conservative-leader-takes-aim-at-spd-over-saudi-arms-embargo-media-idUSKCN1QH2S9 |agency=Reuters |date=28 February 2019}}</ref> saying that, with Germany's ban on arms exports to Saudi Arabia, "Germany is not very credible at the moment" in European security and defence policy and was "making common European projects practically impossible".<ref>{{cite news |title=Arms war in Berlin triggers tensions with France |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/arms-war-in-berlin-triggers-tensions-with-france-1.3842096 |work=The Irish Times |date=28 March 2019}}</ref>

In late 2020, Kramp-Karrenbauer proposed that the European Union should try again to reach a trade agreement with the United States after the [[2020 United States elections|elections]].<ref>Sabine Siebold (October 30,  2020), [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27F20H Germany suggests new EU trade talks with U.S. after elections] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

====Migrants and refugees====
Kramp-Karrenbauer supports stricter immigration policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Migration-darf-nicht-unser-Hartz-IV-werden-article20726903.html|title=Migration darf nicht unser Hartz IV werden|first=n-tv|last=Nachrichten|website=n-tv.de|access-date=9 December 2018|archive-date=17 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117154526/https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Migration-darf-nicht-unser-Hartz-IV-werden-article20726903.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Kramp-Karrenbauer supported Angela Merkel's refugee policies and her decision to let [[European migrant crisis|migrants into Germany in 2015–2016]], many fleeing wars in the Middle East, but demanded more toughness in some cases.<ref>{{cite news |title=Merkel gives pivotal job to conservative Catholic, sparking succession talk |url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/today/politics/surprise-appointment-merkel-gives-pivotal-job-to-conservative-catholic-sparking-succession-talk/23581182.html |work=[[Handelsblatt]] |date=19 February 2018 |access-date=5 December 2018 |archive-date=28 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200528193643/https://www.handelsblatt.com/today/politics/surprise-appointment-merkel-gives-pivotal-job-to-conservative-catholic-sparking-succession-talk/23581182.html?ticket=ST-6581121-SAlY14EO1aFfW2Gjn6v0-ap5 |url-status=live }}</ref>  At the beginning of 2016, she declared herself against a unilateral closure of German borders, since she feared a break-up of the European Union. In December 2017, Kramp-Karrenbauer remarked: "Bei unbegleiteten Minderjährigen sollte eine verbindliche Altersprüfung eingeführt werden." (A mandatory age investigation should be initiated for all unaccompanied minors.) She said refugees may often provide a false age in order to be treated as youths rather than adult asylum-seekers. She added, "Jemand, der seine Identität verschleiert oder Papiere vernichtet hat, muss mit harten Konsequenzen rechnen." (Anyone who conceals their identity or has destroyed papers must face harsh consequences.)  According to her, data sources like mobile phones should be checked, in order to establish a person's identity. Furthermore, instead of carrying out deportations with commercial airplanes, she said it may be necessary to use their separate aircraft.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kramp-Karrenbauer will härteren Umgang mit Asylbewerbern|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article171869703/Annegret-Kramp-Karrenbauer-fuer-verbindliche-Altersfeststellung-bei-minderjaehrigen-Fluechtlingen.html |work=[[Die Welt]] |date=25 December 2017}}</ref> She demanded in November 2018 that after expulsion offenders must be refused re-entry for life, not only to Germany but also throughout the Schengen area, and cited the [[2018 Freiburg gang rape|2018 gang rape in Freiburg]] as an example.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kandidatin Kramp-Karrenbauer mit harter Linie gegen straffällige Asylbewerber|url=https://www.msn.com/de-de/news/politik/kandidatin-kramp-karrenbauer-mit-harter-linie-gegen-straff-c3-a4llige-asylbewerber/ar-BBPuvrx|work=[[Berliner Zeitung]]|date=8 November 2018|access-date=8 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402185015/https://www.msn.com/de-de/news/politik/kandidatin-kramp-karrenbauer-mit-harter-linie-gegen-straff-c3-a4llige-asylbewerber/ar-BBPuvrx|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>
