"'''Believe in the Stars'''" is the [[List of 30 Rock episodes|second episode]] of the [[30 Rock (season 3)|third season]] of the American television comedy series ''[[30 Rock]]''. The 38th overall episode of the series was written by executive producer [[Robert Carlock]] and directed by series producer [[Don Scardino]]. The episode originally aired on the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC) network in the United States on November 6, 2008. Guest stars in this episode include [[Remy Auberjonois]], Todd Buonopane, [[Raven Goodwin]], and [[Oprah Winfrey]].

The episode's plot concerns a feud between [[Tracy Jordan]] ([[Tracy Morgan]]) and [[Jenna Maroney]] ([[Jane Krakowski]]) over royalties from Tracy's pornographic video game ''Gorgasm: The Legend of Dong Slayer''. [[Liz Lemon]] ([[Tina Fey]]) attempts to settle the fight with the help of Oprah Winfrey, whom she meets on a return flight from Chicago. Meanwhile, [[NBC page]] [[Kenneth Parcell]] ([[Jack McBrayer]]) is stung by the revelation that most events from the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] were staged to boost America's image and NBC's ratings. [[Jack Donaghy]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]) attempts to break Kenneth of his [[moral absolutism]].

"Believe in the Stars" received generally positive reception from television critics, with Neal Justin of the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' concluding it was "the most brilliant episode in the series' history".<ref name="neal justin" /> According to the [[Nielsen ratings]] system, the episode was watched by 8.0&nbsp;million households during its original broadcast, and received a 3.9 rating/9 share among viewers in the 18–49 demographic.

On June 22, 2020, it was revealed that this was one of three episodes being pulled from syndication and repeats due to the scene of Jenna wearing blackface.<ref name="vulture">{{cite web|last=Adalian|first=Josef|date=June 22, 2020|title=''30 Rock'' Is Pulling Blackface Episodes From Streaming Platforms and TV Reruns|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/06/30-rock-blackface-episodes-removed.html|accessdate=June 22, 2020|work=Vulture}}</ref>

==Plot==
The episode starts with [[Liz Lemon]] ([[Tina Fey]]) announcing to her boss, [[Jack Donaghy]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]), that she needs to go to [[Chicago]] for [[jury duty]] because she is still registered to vote there. Jack gives Liz a powerful [[sedative]] for the trip. Later, [[NBC page]] [[Kenneth Parcell]] ([[Jack McBrayer]]) walks in on a meeting between Jack and the American silver medalist in [[tetherball]], Tyler Brody ([[Remy Auberjonois]]). Tyler is angry at Jack for not selecting him as the gold medalist, and is threatening to go public with the revelation that there was no Olympic tetherball competition during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], as it was staged to boost NBC's ratings. Jack makes a deal with Brody, but is bothered when Kenneth tells him that he no longer looks up to him over the morally grey actions. In an attempt to break Kenneth's [[moral absolutism]], Jack stages a gambit where nine people are trapped in an elevator with enough air for eight, and Kenneth shows no hesitation in sacrificing himself. Jack concedes that Kenneth is better than him, and gives him a big screen television as a gift, but no cable hookup. Kenneth steals cable and later confesses to Jack, asking if ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' "is supposed to be terrifying".

Meanwhile, [[Jenna Maroney]] ([[Jane Krakowski]]) demands compensation for her [[voice acting|voice work]] in [[Tracy Jordan]]'s ([[Tracy Morgan]]) pornographic video game, ''Gorgasm: The Legend of Dong Slayer''. The argument escalates and Liz orders them to stop their bickering. After Liz leaves for Chicago, Jenna and Tracy decide to conduct a [[social experiment]] to see whether Tracy can survive better as a white woman than Jenna can as a black man, after arguing respectively that black men and white women have it harder in society. Later, while on her flight, Liz takes Jack's sedative. Liz realizes that the woman sitting next to her is [[Oprah Winfrey]]. When Liz arrives back at the 30 Rock studios, Tracy is dressed in [[Drag (clothing)|female drag]] with his body covered in white makeup and soon after, Jenna enters in [[blackface]] and male drag. Jack worries that the situation has gone out of control, but Liz assures him that Oprah, who is coming to the studios, will be able to make them come to terms. As it turns out, her inflight conversation with Oprah was a [[hallucination]]. The person who Liz thought was Oprah is actually a 12-year-old girl named Pam ([[Raven Goodwin]]). Even so, Pam engages Tracy and Jenna in a heart-to-heart, and manages to settle their differences.
