'''Rascal Flatts''' is an American [[Country music|country music]] group formed in [[Columbus, Ohio]] in 1999. Its members are [[Gary LeVox]] (lead vocals), [[Jay DeMarcus]] (bass guitar, background vocals), and [[Joe Don Rooney]] (lead guitar, background vocals). DeMarcus is LeVox's second cousin, a brother-in-law of country music singer [[James Otto]], and a former member of the [[contemporary Christian music]] duo [[East to West]].

From 2000 to 2010, they recorded for [[Disney Music Group]]'s [[Lyric Street Records]]. While on that label, they released six studio albums, all of which have been [[RIAA certification|certified]] platinum or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). In order of release, they are ''[[Rascal Flatts (album)|Rascal Flatts]]'' (2000), ''[[Melt (Rascal Flatts album)|Melt]]'' (2002), ''[[Feels Like Today]]'' (2004), ''[[Me and My Gang]]'' (2006), ''[[Still Feels Good]]'' (2007), and ''[[Unstoppable (Rascal Flatts album)|Unstoppable]]'' (2009). After Lyric Street closed in 2010, they moved to [[Big Machine Records]], for which they have released four studio albums and one Christmas album: ''[[Nothing Like This (album)|Nothing Like This]]'' (2010), ''[[Changed (album)|Changed]]'' (2012), ''[[Rewind (Rascal Flatts album)|Rewind]]'' (2014), ''[[The Greatest Gift of All]]'' (2016), and their final studio album, ''[[Back to Us]]'' (2017).

They have charted forty singles, sixteen of which have reached No.&nbsp;1 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]], [[Country Airplay]] or [[Canada Country]]. Their longest-lasting No.&nbsp;1 single, a cover of [[Marcus Hummon]]'s "[[Bless the Broken Road#Rascal Flatts version|Bless the Broken Road]]", spent five weeks in that position in 2005. Through 2006–07, "[[What Hurts the Most#Rascal Flatts version|What Hurts the Most]]" was No.&nbsp;1 on both the Hot Country Songs and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts, and peaked at No.&nbsp;6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

On January 7, 2020, the band announced that they would be disbanding following a farewell tour after 21 years together.<ref name="2020 Farewell Tour">{{cite web|last1=Reuter|first1=Annie|title=Rascal Flatts Announce 2020 Farewell Tour, Promise New Music|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8547454/rascal-flatts-tour-dates-2020|website=Billboard|date=January 7, 2020|access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref> On May 19, 2020, the farewell tour was indefinitely postponed due to the [[COVID-19]] pandemic.<ref name=5mininterview>[https://news.yahoo.com/rascal-flatts-cancelled-farewell-tour-151140617.html Rascal Flatts on Cancelled Farewell Tour and How They Want to Be Remembered | Billboard's 5-Minute Interview] retrieved July 31, 2020</ref>

==History==
{{quote box|quote=We're not just business partners, we are good friends. That's why we have had the longevity we have.|source=Joe Don Rooney, 2006, ''People'' magazine<ref name=longevity>11/8/2006 "Rascal Flatts". ''People''. '''66''':60</ref>|width=315px}}

Rascal Flatts' founding was at Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar in Nashville, Tennessee. [[Gary LeVox]] and [[Jay DeMarcus]] are second cousins from a musical family.<ref name="allmusic"/> DeMarcus moved to Nashville in 1992, earning his first record deal as part of a Christian group called [[East to West]]; his brother-in-law, [[James Otto]], is also a country music singer. In 1997, DeMarcus called LeVox, and convinced him to come to Nashville and provide some harmonies on [[Michael English (American singer)|Michael English]]'s album ''Gospel'', which he was producing. They engineered the album together, and became English's back-up band.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mueller|first=Walt|title=Rascal Flatts: Taking kids to the country|url=http://www.cpyu.org/Page.aspx?id=149895|publisher=Center for Parent/Youth Understanding|access-date=30 May 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830110647/http://www.cpyu.org/Page.aspx?id=149895|archive-date=30 August 2013}}</ref>

At the same time, DeMarcus had become the bandleader of [[Chely Wright]]'s band, where he met [[Joe Don Rooney]], the guitarist in that band. DeMarcus and LeVox were working in a [[Printer's Alley]] nightclub<ref name="allmusic"/> and when their part-time guitarist could not make it one night, DeMarcus invited Rooney to join them. [[Jim Riley (drummer)|Jim Riley]] was the drummer and bandleader for the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moderndrummer.com/site/2012/01/jim-riley|title=Jim Riley|work=Modern Drummer Magazine}}</ref> The group covered the hit [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]] single "[[The Church on Cumberland Road]]" that night. To the group's recollection, a bond was formed instantly.

Singer [[Mila Mason]] recommended the group to record producers [[Mark Bright (record producer)|Mark Bright]] and Marty Williams,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.voxmagazine.com/stories/2004/02/05/ruckus-raising-rascals-sorry-spanky-not-so-little-/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130205160619/http://www.voxmagazine.com/stories/2004/02/05/ruckus-raising-rascals-sorry-spanky-not-so-little-/ |archive-date=2013-02-05 }}</ref> who played [[Lyric Street Records]] A&R Doug Howard a three-song demo and Howard thought they were "just incredible." After he'd heard the demos, the band went into the Lyric Street offices the next day, sat down with acoustic guitars, and played a couple of songs. According to Howard in an interview with [[HitQuarters]]: "The vocals and harmonies, it was all there—I was just blown away. The lead singer has such a unique and compelling voice."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Doug_Howard_Interview.html |title=Interview with Doug Howard |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=10 Jul 2006 |access-date=23 Nov 2010}}</ref> The band was signed to Lyric Street in late 1999.

==Career==

===2000–2005: ''Rascal Flatts'', ''Melt'', and ''Feels Like Today''===
In early 2000, the group made its debut with the single "[[Prayin' for Daylight]]". This song had been on the three-song demo that had gotten the band signed.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> The song, which reached No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' country charts, was the first single from their [[Rascal Flatts (album)|self-titled debut]], which was issued in early 2000 on Lyric Street.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p429157|pure_url=yes}} |title=Rascal Flatts biography |access-date=2007-10-04 |last=Cohoon |first=Rick |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Following "Prayin' for Daylight", the album's other three singles all made the Top 10 on that chart with "[[This Everyday Love]]", "[[While You Loved Me]]", and "[[I'm Movin' On (Rascal Flatts song)|I'm Movin' On]]", which respectively peaked at numbers 9, 7, and 4. "I'm Movin' On" was awarded Song of the Year by the Academy of Country Music in 2002. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] reviewed the album with favor, calling it "a sunny, pleasing modern country-pop album".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/rascal-flatts-r484829/review|title=''Rascal Flatts'' review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=Allmusic|access-date=1 September 2011}}</ref>

Their second album, entitled ''[[Melt (Rascal Flatts album)|Melt]]'', was released in 2002. Unlike their previous album, Rascal Flatts co-produced this one.<ref name="allmusic"/> The album's first single, "[[These Days (Rascal Flatts song)|These Days]]", became the band's first number one hit on the U.S. country charts.<ref name="allmusic"/> The album included two more Top 10 hits with "[[Love You Out Loud]]" "[[I Melt]]", and "[[Mayberry (Rascal Flatts song)|Mayberry]]". The latter became the band's second number one. The [[music video]] for "I Melt" featured partial nudity<ref name="cmt">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1473779/20030714/rascal_flatts.jhtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-02-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414201146/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1473779/20030714/rascal_flatts.jhtml |archive-date=2009-04-14 }}</ref> and was banned from the [[Great American Country]] (GAC) network.

Rascal Flatts's third album, ''[[Feels Like Today]]'', was released in late 2004. The album's [[Feels Like Today (song)|title track]] was released as its first single. Following it was "[[Bless the Broken Road]]". That song was originally recorded by its co-writer, [[Marcus Hummon]], and had also been recorded by [[Melodie Crittenden]] (whose version made the country chart in 1998), the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], and [[Sons of the Desert (band)|Sons of the Desert]]. In early 2005, Rascal Flatts's version became the band's third number one hit on the U.S. country charts and spent five weeks at that position. The third single, "[[Fast Cars and Freedom]]", hit number one as well. While the latter was climbing the charts, some radio stations began playing a [[hidden track]] on the album, titled "Skin". This airplay caused "Skin" to enter the top 40. The song was released as a single under the title "[[Skin (Sarabeth)]]" and officially added to the album's track list.

===2005–2007: ''Me and My Gang'' and ''Still Feels Good''===
Rascal Flatts's thirteenth chart entry, "[[What Hurts the Most]]", was released in December 2005. This song had previously been recorded by [[Mark Wills]] in 2003. Rascal Flatts' version of that song was released as the first single from their fourth album ''[[Me and My Gang]]'', which was released in 2006. For this album, the band worked with producer [[Dann Huff]]. They switched producers to create a more band-oriented album. Rascal Flatts' rendition of "What Hurts the Most" was a crossover hit for the band, reaching No. 1 on both the country and adult contemporary charts, as well as peaking with the top 10 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. After it, the album's [[Me and My Gang (song)|title track]] was released as the second single and charted in the Top 10 at number 6. The third and fourth singles, "[[My Wish]]" and "[[Stand (Rascal Flatts song)|Stand]]", both reached number one.

Also in 2006, the group charted in the top 10 of the Hot 100 with a cover of [[Tom Cochrane]]'s "[[Life Is a Highway]]", which they recorded for the [[Pixar]] film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''. Although "Life Is a Highway" was not released to country radio, several country stations did begin playing the song, causing it to chart within the top 20 of Hot Country Songs. ''Me and My Gang'' had the highest US debut of 2006, with 722,000 units in April.<ref>Christman, Ed (2006-10-07), "Million-Unit Question". ''Billboard''. '''118''' (40):7</ref> The album spent 15 weeks at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums chart and was the second-best selling album of 2006 (behind ''[[High School Musical]]''), with sales totaling to about 3.5 million by year's end.<ref name=tucker>Tucker, Ken (2007-08-25), "Can Rascal Repeat?"

[[Carrie Underwood]] and Rascal Flatts performed together at the 2007 Grammy Awards ceremony.<ref>No byline (2007-02-09), "Performances dwarf the awards". ''USA Today''</ref> Later the same year, the group released the single "[[Take Me There (Rascal Flatts song)|Take Me There]]", a song which [[Kenny Chesney]] co-wrote and had initially planned to record himself. That song became a number-one country hit in September and served as the first single from the album ''[[Still Feels Good]]''. It was followed by "[[Winner at a Losing Game]]", which was the first single which the band wrote themselves.<ref name="country">{{cite journal |last=Horner |first=Marianne |date=24 March 2008 |title=Story Behind the Song: "Winner at a Losing Game" |journal=[[Country Weekly]] |volume=15 |issue=6 |page=64 }}</ref> Both it and its followup "[[Every Day (Rascal Flatts song)|Every Day]]" peaked at No. 2 on the country charts. The fourth single from the album, "[[Bob That Head]]", became the band's first single to miss the Top 10 on the chart. The fifth and final single, "[[Here (Rascal Flatts song)|Here]]", was released in August 2008 and became the band's ninth Number One hit on the chart week of January 3, 2009.

===2008–2010: ''Greatest Hits Volume 1'' and ''Unstoppable''===
Rascal Flatts released their first compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits Volume 1 (Rascal Flatts album)|Greatest Hits Volume 1]]'', on October 28, 2008.

That song debuted at No. 57 and topped out at No. 2 on the country charts. The group performed "Summer Nights" at the ''[[CMT Music Awards]]'', ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]''{{'}}s Kickoff Party, and the finale of ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.
