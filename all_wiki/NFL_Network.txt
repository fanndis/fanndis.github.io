'''NFL Network''' (occasionally abbreviated on-air as '''NFLN''') is an [[United States|American]] [[sports channel|sports-oriented]] [[pay television]] [[television network|network]] that is owned by the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and is part of NFL Media, which also includes NFL.com, [[NFL Films]], NFL Mobile, NFL Now and [[NFL RedZone]]. Dedicated to [[American football]], the network features game telecasts from the NFL, as well as NFL-related content including analysis programs, [[television special|specials]] and [[documentary film|documentaries]]. The network is headquartered in the [[Los Angeles]] suburb of [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], [[California]], and broadcasts its worldwide feed from Encompass Digital Media (formally Crawford Communications) in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref>[http://broadcastengineering.com/news/crawford-distribuites-nfl-network-via-satellite-services-1128/ Crawford distributes NFL Network via satellite services] ''Broadcast Engineering'' November 28, 2008</ref> The NFL Media Campus, as well as the Network's headquarters, is scheduled to relocate to [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], [[California]] by summer of 2021, where a new office building and studio will be located next to [[SoFi Stadium]].

As of February 2015, NFL Network is available to approximately 71,867,000 pay television households in the United States (totaling 61.7% of U.S. households with at least one television set).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223220414/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 23, 2015|title=List of how many homes each cable network is in as of February 2015|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=February 22, 2015|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref>

== History ==
NFL Network was launched on November 4, 2003, only eight months after the owners of the league's 32 teams voted [[Unanimity|unanimously]] to approve its formation. The league invested $100 million to fund the network's operations. [[NFL Films]], which produces commercials, television programs, and feature films for the NFL, is a key supplier of NFL Network's programming, with more than 4,000 hours of footage available in its library. As a result, much of the network's highlights and recaps feature NFL Films' [[NFL Films#Style|trademark style]] of slow-motion game action, sounds of the game, and sideline conversations between players and/or team staff.

Beginning with the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]], the network began to broadcast eight regular-season NFL games during Thursday [[prime time]], branded as ''[[Thursday Night Football]]''. In addition, to live games, the network has provided coverage of the [[NFL Draft]] since 2006; its coverage competes with that provided by [[ESPN]] and [[ESPN2]]. It was simulcast in a co-production with [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] for the [[2018 NFL Draft|2018 edition]], though this was only a one-year agreement as exclusive over-the-air broadcast rights will go to [[American Broadcast Company|ABC]] for the 2019 edition, which will see ESPN produce a different broadcast for 'casual' fans.

In 2021, the network will move with the rest of NFL Media to a 200,000 square foot space on the campus of ''Hollywood Park'', a development that also features [[SoFi Stadium]] in [[Inglewood, California]]. In addition to office and studio space, the new facility also will feature NFL Media's first outdoor studio and space to host studio audiences.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/nfl-media-set-to-move-to-new-la-rams-chargers-stadium/|title=NFL Media Set to Move to New LA Rams, Chargers Stadium in 2021|date=March 26, 2018|work=TheWrap|access-date=March 27, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Branding ==

At the [[2008 NFL Draft]], NFL Network unveiled a revised logo that was updated to match the revised NFL logo introduced around the same time. Unlike the updated logo for the league, the NFL Network's logo included subtle changes such as using a darker shade of blue and changing the "NFL" lettering to match that of the new league logo. During the [[2012 NFL Draft]], the network debuted an overhauled logo resembling that used by sister network NFL Red Zone; the network also began to play down the "HD" branding used on-air, as the vast majority of cable providers currently carrying NFL Network transmit the channel's [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] feed as a [[downscaling|downscaled]] [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] version of the [[High-definition television|high definition]] feed. The logo underwent another minor change during the [[2015 NFL season]] when as part of the league's year-long celebration of [[Super Bowl 50]], the logo took a gold hue in line with the league celebrating the game's golden anniversary.

The network unveiled an updated ticker at the start of the 2017 season, replacing the one used since the 2012 rebranding.

{{Main|List of programs broadcast by NFL Network}}

=== NFL game telecasts ===
{{Main|Thursday Night Football}}
Prior to the 2012 season, the NFL Network aired live primetime games on Thursdays beginning in mid-November. Starting with the [[2012 NFL season|2012 season]], the network began televising one live Thursday night game each week from Weeks 2 through 15 (excluding Thanksgiving Day), as well as one live Saturday night game during Week 16. As a result of the addition of these extra games, every NFL team now appears in at least one timeslot-exclusive nationally televised game (either a Thursday, Sunday, or Monday Night contest, a Thanksgiving game, or a 9:30 a.m ET London game). As with the games broadcast by ESPN's ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', the NFL Network telecasts are also aired on a designated broadcast television station in the primary [[media market|markets]] of the participating teams, although prior to the suspension of blackout rules in 2015 stations in the home team's market only carried it if the televised game [[NFL on television#Blackout policies|sold out all remaining available tickets 72 hours prior to the game's start time]].

When ''Thursday Night Football'' premiered, veteran television announcer [[Bryant Gumbel]] served as [[play-by-play]] announcer, with former [[NFL on Fox|Fox]] and current [[Football Night in America|NBC]] analyst [[Cris Collinsworth]] serving as [[color commentator]] for the broadcasts.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/nflnetwork/story/9398370 Bryant Gumbel, Cris Collinsworth to announce NFL Network games] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430234917/http://www.nfl.com/NFL |date=April 30, 2006 }} NFL Network.</ref> Collinsworth won the Sports [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for best game analyst for his work on the NFL Network telecasts. [[Dick Vermeil]] replaced Collinsworth for two games in 2006; [[Marshall Faulk]] and [[Deion Sanders]] replaced Collinsworth when needed in 2007.

In August 2007, the network televised the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]] between the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and the [[New Orleans Saints]] as NBC opted to cover that year's preseason game in [[China]], which was later canceled. The 2007 schedule began on November 22 ([[Thanksgiving]] night), with a game between the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and the [[Atlanta Falcons]] at the [[Georgia Dome]] in [[Atlanta]]. Gumbel and Collinsworth returned as the booth announcers.

[[Bob Papa]], also the radio voice of the [[New York Giants]] on local [[sports talk]] station [[WFAN]], announced the games starting in 2008. Former [[Detroit Lions]] general manager [[Matt Millen]] was named Collinsworth's replacement at the same time. Former [[Washington Redskins]] quarterback [[Joe Theismann]] joined Papa and Millen in the booth for the 2010â11 season. In May 2011, NFL Network announced that [[Brad Nessler]] and [[Mike Mayock]] would serve as the announcers for that season's game broadcasts.

In the 2014 season, [[CBS Sports]] took over the production of all of the games in the package, and gained the right to simulcast 8 of the games on broadcast television.<ref name=cbs-nflthursday>{{cite web|title=CBS to broadcast eight Thursday night football games in 2014|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24431657/cbs-to-take-eight-thursday-night-games-in-2014|work=CBS Sports|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name=usatoday-nflcbs>{{cite web|title=CBS to broadcast NFL games on Thursday in 2014|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/02/05/cbs-thursday-tv-games-nfl-network/5227869/|work=USA Today|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref> In 2016, [[NBC Sports]] also gained a portion of the package under a similar arrangement.<ref name="deadline-tnf2016nbccbs">{{cite web|title=CBS & NBC To Share âThursday Night Footballâ With NFL Network; League Eyes "Tri-Cast" With Digital Partner|url=https://deadline.com/2016/02/thursday-night-football-cbs-nbc-share-nfl-network-1201694273/|website=Deadline.com|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name="wp-tnfnbccbs">{{cite news|title=NFL reaches deal with CBS, NBC to split âThursday Night Footballâ|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/02/01/nfl-reaches-deal-with-cbs-nbc-to-split-thursday-night-football/|accessdate=February 1, 2016|work=Washington Post}}</ref> [[Fox Sports]] took over the package in 2018.<ref name="espn-foxtnf">{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/22273473/fox-broadcast-thursday-night-football-next-five-seasons|title=Fox gets Thursday Night Football through '22|work=ESPN.com|access-date=January 31, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/01/31/thursday-night-football-reportedly-will-move-to-fox-next-season/|title=âThursday Night Footballâ will move to Fox next season|last=Bonesteel|first=Matt|date=January 31, 2018|work=Washington Post|access-date=January 31, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

=== Preseason coverage ===

NFL Network televises all 65 [[National Football League preseason|preseason games]] each August. Some of the games air live on the network, however a majority of these contests air on a [[broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] basis and use the local broadcast of one of the teams involved. Live preseason game broadcasts on NFL Network are blacked out in the home markets of both participating teams, where the game is broadcast on a local station; in those affected areas, an alternate feed of NFL Network is shown instead with a different preseason game or a previously aired game. Prior to 2014, NFL Network occasionally broadcast selected preseason games as special editions of ''Thursday Night Football''.

=== Studio shows ===

On weekdays, ''[[Good Morning Football]]'' airs live from 7-10 am, followed by a repeat from 10 am-1 pm.

On Sundays, the ''NFL GameDay Morning'' pre-game show airs from 9 am-1 pm, ''NFL GameDay Live'' from 1-7:30 pm, ''NFL GameDay Highlights'' from 7:30-8:30, and ''NFL GameDay Prime'' from 11:30 pmâ12:30 am.

=== Other football ===

==== Arena Football League ====
NFL Network held the broadcast rights to the revived [[Arena Football League]] from 2010 to 2012. Starting with the 2010 season, the network broadcast a weekly ''Friday Night Football'' game each week during the regular season and playoff games at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] from March to August, in addition to rights to playoff games and the [[ArenaBowl]]. The NFL stated that unlike when the NFL last showed interest in arena football, there would be no attempts to buy into the league.<ref>Lombardo, John and John Ourand (February 8, 2010). [http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/64774 NFL Network to broadcast new arena leagueâs games]. Sports Business Journal.</ref> Broadcasters for the games included [[Kurt Warner]], [[Tom Waddle]], [[Paul Burmeister]], [[Fran Charles]], [[Charles Davis (defensive back)|Charles Davis]] and [[Ari Wolfe]].

Starting with the 2010 season, the network obtained the broadcast rights to the [[Arena Football League]]. Each Friday, the NFL Network aired a ''Game of the Week'' from the AFL through the league's playoffs and culminating with the [[ArenaBowl]]. Also beginning in 2010, the channel began to broadcast 14 regular-season games as well as the [[Grey Cup]] from the [[Canadian Football League]].

NFL Network ceased airing Arena Football League games partway through the [[2012 Arena Football League season|2012 season]] as a result of ongoing labor problems within the league. The season's remaining games were carried on a [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] before the network terminated the league broadcast contract outright at the end of the season; the rights were then obtained by [[CBS Sports Network]].

==== College football ====
In 2006, NFL Network began a foray into televising [[college football]] [[bowl game]]s, acquiring rights to the newly-established [[Texas Bowl]] in Houston (whose management rights were held by the [[Houston Texans]] at the time), the [[Insight Bowl]], as well as two all-star eventsâthe [[Senior Bowl]] (which features NFL prospects that had completed their college eligibility) and the [[Las Vegas All-American Classic]] (which, however, was cancelled at the last minute due to financial and sponsorship issues). These games were intended to help make NFL Network more attractive to television providers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2724668|title=Las Vegas All-American Classic canceled at last minute|date=2007-01-08|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/nflnetwork/story/9563385 |title=NFL Network gets bowl game in Houston |website=NFL.com |date=20 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823012236/http://www.nfl.com/nflnetwork/story/9563385 |archive-date=23 August 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/nfl-net-adds-fourth-game-28485|title=NFL Net Adds Fourth Game|last=Grossman|first=Ben|website=Broadcasting & Cable|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1024487-senior-bowl-more-than-just-an-all-star-game|title=Senior Bowl: More Than Just an All-Star Game|last=Shuck|first=Barry|website=Bleacher Report|language=en|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref> The [[2006 Insight Bowl]], played between [[2006 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]] and [[2006 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|Texas Tech]], would also achieve notoriety for featuring the largest comeback victory in [[Division I FBS]] bowl game history, with Texas Tech coming back from a 38â7 third-quarter deficit to win 44â41 in overtime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/list/biggest-comebacks-college-football-history-ucla-texas-am-tcu-oregon-auburn-alabama/pliviosg8u8s1xhzr8js9xg4d|title=10 of the greatest comebacks in college football history|last=Zarett|first=E.

On April 14, 2007, the network televised the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska Cornhuskers]]' spring football game. The network again aired the Insight, Texas and Senior bowls in late 2007 and early 2008. In addition, it carried two games between [[historically black colleges and universities]] during the 2007 season, including the [[Circle City Classic]] at the [[RCA Dome]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. Rights to the Insight and Texas Bowls were later acquired by [[ESPN]] (with the former later moving to [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]).

The Senior Bowl and a fellow all-star game, the [[East-West Shrine Game]], remained the only college football games to be regularly shown by NFL Network until May 2019, when it announced a four-year deal with the [[Conference USA]] to air a weekly regular-season game on Saturday afternoons beginning in the [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2019 season]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/league-networks/nfl-network-conference-usa-four-year-deal.html|title=NFL Network signs a four-year deal with Conference USA|date=2019-05-20|website=Awful Announcing|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref>

==== High school football ====
NFL Network aired two high school all-star games in June 2007: the [[Bayou Bowl]] between players from [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]] on June 9 (via a live feed from [[regional sports network]] [[Fox Sports Southwest|FSN Southwest]]), and the [[Big 33 Football Classic]] between players from [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Ohio]] on June 16 (sharing its feed with CN8 (now the [[Comcast Network]]) and cable outlets in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] and Ohio).

==== Canadian Football League ====
On July 1, 2010, NFL Network began airing live [[Canadian Football League]] games simulcast from Canadian sports network [[The Sports Network|TSN]]. NFL Network aired the league's Thursday games, three Saturday games during the month of July, and then Friday night games beginning in September (after [[ArenaBowl XXIII]]). NFL Network did not air CFL games during August as it carried a heavy amount of NFL preseason game broadcasts.<ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/454382-NFL_Network_Going_Canadian.php NFL Network Going Canadian â CFL games begin airing on network July 1] ''Broadcasting & Cable'' July 1, 2010</ref><ref>[https://www.cfl.ca/article/cfl-to-air-on-nfl-network CFL to air on NFL Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304062718/http://www.cfl.ca/article/cfl-to-air-on-NFL-network |date=March 4, 2014 }} CFL Official Site June 30, 2010</ref> In addition, NFL Network did not carry any playoff games, including the [[Grey Cup]] championship, as those games are all played on Sundays opposite NFL regular season games. Those games were instead broadcast on the [[ESPN3]] online service (ESPN owns a 20% interest in TSN, in a [[joint venture]] with majority parent [[Bell Media]]). On May 25, 2012, NFL Network announced it would not renew its contract with the CFL.<ref>McMillan, Ken (May 25, 2012). [http://blogs.hudsonvalley.com/hudson-valley-sports-tv/2012/05/25/no-cfl-on-nfln-eh/ No CFL on NFLN, eh?]. ''HudsonValley.com''. Retrieved June 14, 2012.</ref> The package was subsequently acquired by the [[NBC Sports Network]], then by the [[ESPN Inc.|ESPN networks]].

NFL Network expressed interest in picking up CFL games again beginning in the 2019 season after its previous deal with ESPN expired. To accommodate this, the NFL insisted that the CFL move its schedule over a month earlier than it currently runs, so that the network can use the league to fill air time between the [[NFL Draft]] and [[National Football League training camp|training camp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ottawasun.com/sports/football/cfl/grey-cup-in-october-tv-deal-with-nfl-cfl-commish-speaks|first=Tim|last=Baines|title=Grey Cup in October?

==== Alliance of American Football ====
On January 31, 2019, NFL Network signed a multi-year deal to air [[Alliance of American Football]] games, broadcasting two games per week, most of them on Saturday and Sunday nights.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ourand|first=John|url=https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Morning-Buzz/2019/01/31/AAF.aspx|title=Alliance Of American Football Signs Deals With Turner, NFL Net|work=SportsBusiness Daily|date=January 31, 2019|accessdate=January 31, 2019}}</ref> The league ultimately folded in the middle of its [[2019 AAF season|inaugural season]].<ref name=leagueonfire>{{cite web|first=Conor|last=Orr|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/04/30/alliance-american-football-aaf-collapse-charlie-ebersol-tom-dundon|title=League on Fire: The Curious Rise and Spectacular Crash of the Alliance of American Football|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=May 1, 2019|accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref>

== High definition ==
NFL Network HD is a [[1080i]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed of NFL Network that launched in August 2004. It is available nationally on satellite providers [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]], and regionally on [[Verizon FiOS]], [[AT&T U-verse]] and most [[Comcast]] and [[Cogeco]] Cable systems.

In mid-October 2008, in-studio programs began to air in "enhanced HD", featuring contained additional scores and statistics on a dedicated wing on the right side of the screen that was only visible on the HD feed. Content that is presented in [[4:3]] [[standard definition television|standard definition]] is shown with [[Pillarbox#Stylized pillarboxing on television|stylized pillarboxes]], or for some footage, blurred pillarbox wings. On May 1, 2009, ''NFL Total Access'' began airing in full HD without pillarboxing or enhanced graphics; this was followed by the upgrade of ''NFL GameDay'' to HD the following September.

Most providers began to exclusively carry the HD feed of the network during 2011, transmitting a [[downscaling|downscaled]] and [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] version of the HD feed to provide the channel in 4:3 standard definition for analog viewers without any deviation, including the "NFL HD" logo. The standard definition feed was discontinued entirely in July 2012, concurrent with the introduction of the network's current logo.

== NFL RedZone channel ==
{{Main|NFL RedZone}}

The '''NFL RedZone channel''' is a special game-day only channel that broadcasts on Sundays during the regular season from 1:00 to 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time (10:00&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]]). ''RedZone'' provides "whip around" coverage of all Sunday afternoon games airing in-progress on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] and [[NFL on Fox|Fox]] . Whenever a team enters the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]], the coverage will switch full-screen over to the live feed of that game's television broadcast, and attempt to cover a potential scoring result (touchdown or field goal). The coverage is hosted by [[Scott Hanson]]. This is not to be confused with the completely separate and different Red Zone channel available only on [[NFL Sunday Ticket]].

Starting in 2016 NFL Network during the offseason replayed one week of NFL RedZone every Sunday from the previous season.

== International distribution ==
===Canada===
NFL Network was approved for distribution on Canadian television providers by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] in 2004;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2004/pb2004-88.htm|title=Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2004-88|date=2007-09-20|publisher=CRTC|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref> ''Thursday Night Football'' games are blacked out on the feed distributed in Canada to protect local rightsholder [[The Sports Network|TSN]].

=== United Kingdom ===
It was reported that the network would be made available in the United Kingdom in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfluk.com/features-display.php?id=2915|title=NFLUK.com â Features: Display Features<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}</ref>

=== Germany ===
Since the 2017 season, NFL Network is a part of the IPTV subscription service [[DAZN]], which also offers the full ''Sunday Ticket'' package to German viewers.

== Carriage and distribution complications ==
The launch of the ''Thursday Night Football'' package led NFL Network to increasingly insist on carriage on lower subscription tiers of television providers; in particular, demanding carriage on a basic package and a carriage fee of $0.61 per subscriber. Time Warner Cable and other major cable providers wished to place it on a sports tier. Cable companies felt that a channel with such marginal interest, few live games, and filler programming, would be tough to sell outside of the football season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6394522.html|title=Outlook Dim for NFL Network, MSOs â 11/22/2006 3:56:00 PM â Multichannel News<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=July 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907002556/http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6394522.html|archive-date=September 7, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> In February 2008, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that the NFL had been in discussion with [[Disney]] executives over the possibility of partnering with [[ESPN Inc.|ESPN]] to bolster NFL Network; one analyst suggested the possibility of NFL Network being combined into its lesser-viewed, but better-carried [[ESPN Classic]] channel.<ref name ="ESPN">{{cite web |url= http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6572116.html |title= ESPN, NFL Network To Partner: Report |accessdate= January 13, 2016 |date= June 20, 2008 |last= Barrett|first= Larry|publisher= Multichannel News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624173130/http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6572116.html|archive-date=June 24, 2008}}</ref>

=== 2006 free preview ===
NFL Network offered a free preview from December 24 to 30, 2006 to [[Suddenlink Communications]] systems in [[West Texas]], and to [[Time Warner Cable]] and [[Cablevision (US)|Cablevision]] systems in the New York City area. The package included the [[2006 Texas Bowl|Texas Bowl]] and [[Cheez-It Bowl|Insight Bowl]], but excluded that week's NFL game between the [[New York Giants]] and [[Washington Redskins]] (which was already scheduled to air on a local broadcast station under existing NFL policy). However, Time Warner Cable and Cablevision were only interested in showing the Texas Bowl, which featured the [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights]], who developed strong local appeal in 2006 and barely missed a berth in the [[Bowl Championship Series]]. The NFL denied that request and would only offer the free preview if Cablevision and/or Time Warner Cable made the entire preview week available to customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestate.com/mld/thestate/sports/colleges/16253149.htm|title=Columbia, SC Breaking News, Sports, Weather & More â TheState.com & The State|website=www.thestate.com|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

TWC then offered to carry the free preview on a digital tier. Cablevision, however, continued to refuse to carry any NFL Network programming other than the Texas Bowl. It even announced that Cablevision would put it on channel 14 (normally occupied by a television listings channel that was used as an overflow feed for [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]] and [[MSG Plus|FSN New York]]) at 6:00&nbsp;p.m. until the end of the network's postgame coverage. The NFL, however, stated that it would not accept that request.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i8b4e2c24bf2df48e5601a0466f77a42f Cablevision, NFL in new Rutgers war of words]''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''</ref>

On December 21, however, after New Jersey legislators threatened legal action, Cablevision changed its mind and indeed showed not only the game between Rutgers and [[Kansas State Wildcats|Kansas State]], but also the entire free preview schedule. Time Warner had made a similar announcement only hours earlier.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls06/news/story?id=2706450 Cablevision to broadcast Texas Bowl] ESPN.</ref> Suddenlink agreed on December 22 to carry the entire free preview for their customers in West Texas.<ref name="NFLSudd">[http://texastech.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/122206aab.html NFL Network and Suddenlink Cable Reach Agreement] Texas Tech website</ref> The free preview did not lead to long-term carriage deals, and the standoff continued between all three cable companies and the NFL Network.

=== 2007 Packers vs. Cowboys controversy ===
2007 saw fresh controversy about the NFL Network. That year, the network happened to hold the rights to some match-ups with major implications. The first came in late November when one-loss [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]] hosted one-loss [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]]. Green Bay's [[Brett Favre]] was also having one of the best seasons of his career and would eventually lead the resurgent Packers to the [[NFC Championship Game]]. Most fans could not see the game because of carriage restrictions, more noticeable because it involved nationally respected teams in a highly anticipated match-up. This controversy would pale in comparison to the final game the NFL Network would broadcast that season.

==== 2007 Patriots vs. Giants controversy ====
{{Main|2007 New England Patriots â New York Giants game}}
In December 2007, [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[John Kerry]] of [[Massachusetts]] wrote a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell asking for the league to settle their differences in time for the [[New England Patriots]]-[[New York Giants]] game on December 29 that would be broadcast on ''[[Run to the Playoffs|Saturday Night Football]]''. The game was the Patriots' record-sealing win that made them the first undefeated team through the regular season in 35 years. Kerry urged for a solution to be decided upon in time so that Americans could witness "a historic event".<ref>Reiss, Mike. [https://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/12/kerry_presses_t.html Kerry presses on NFL Network] ''The Boston Globe'', December 6, 2007.</ref> An agreement was worked out between the NFL and two of the league's television partners, NBC and CBS, to allow the NFL Network broadcast of the game to be [[simulcast]] on those networks, resulting in the first NFL simulcast since [[Super Bowl I]] and the first three-network simulcast in the history of the league.<ref name="07PatriotsGiants">{{cite web | last = Donohue | first = Steve | title = NFL to Simulcast Patriots-Giants Game on CBS, NBC | publisher = Multichannel News | date = December 26, 2007 | url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6515305.html | accessdate = December 26, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071229075239/http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6515305.html | archive-date = December 29, 2007 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

In addition, [[New York City]] area [[MyNetworkTV]] owned-and-operated station [[WWOR-TV]] (channel 9), and [[Hearst Television]]-owned [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliates [[WCVB-TV]] (channel 5) in [[Boston]] and [[WMUR-TV]] (channel 9) in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], expressed dissatisfaction over the CBS/NBC simulcast, stating it violated their agreements with the network. The stations had already been scheduled to air the game, as per NFL rules. Greg Aiello, an NFL spokesperson, stated that NBC and CBS would not have agreed to present the simulcast without clearing the game nationally, including the aforementioned markets. WWOR came to an agreement with the network and showed the game along with WNBC and [[WCBS-TV]] (channel 2) in the New York City market. WCVB also would still televise the game and stated that it was still working toward resolving issues with the NFL Network over additional coverage rights.<ref name="07PatriotsGiants2">{{cite web | last = Reynolds | first = Mike | title = NFL Working Toward Local Accords Over Patriots Game | publisher = Multichannel News | date = December 28, 2007 | url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6515726.html | accessdate = December 29, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080101123638/http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6515726.html | archive-date = January 1, 2008 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The result of these arrangements was that viewers in the New York, Boston and New Hampshire areas could see the game on up to four networks.

[[RCN Corporation]], the 12th-largest cable provider in the U.S., stated that the league's deal with CBS and NBC "devalues its contract with the leagueâs in-house service." Greg Aiello, an NFL spokesperson, said he was unaware of dissatisfaction among NFL Network affiliates over the simulcast and if any were seeking a rebate or other form of compensation because the game was being more widely distributed. If that were the case, he said, those discussions would âtake place privately with our TV partners.â<ref name="07RCNNFL">{{cite web | last = Reynolds | first = Mike | title = RCN Calls For Penalty On NFL Network Simulcast | publisher = Multichannel News | date = December 28, 2007 | url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6515727.html | accessdate = December 29, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080108053212/http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6515727.html | archive-date = January 8, 2008 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

=== Comcast ===
On November 10, 2006, [[Comcast]] announced it would add NFL Network on its digital tier in time for the debut of ''Thursday Night Football''.<ref name ="MultiC">[http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6390422.html Cox Adds NFL Network Game Package] Multichannel</ref> On August 6, 2007, Comcast moved NFL Network from the digital tiers to the ''Sports Entertainment Package''. This led to a court battle between NFL Network and Comcast, with the ruling in favor of Comcast; the NFL Network later appealed the ruling.<ref>[http://www.mediabuyerplanner.com/2007/05/11/nfl-network-to-appeal-court-ruling-for-comcast/ NFL Network to Appeal Court Ruling for Comcast] Media Buyer Planner</ref> Comcast sent NFL Network a cease-and-desist letter to stop encouraging subscribers to drop their Comcast service.<ref name="USACom">[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-11-20-comcast-letter_N.htm?csp=34 Comcast sends NFL Network cease-and-desist note] Media Buyer Planner</ref> Comcast's carriage agreement with the NFL Network ended in mid-2009.<ref name ="MultiCom">[http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6501908.html Jones: Comcastâs NFL Network Deal Expires In 18 Months] Multichannel</ref> On February 26, 2008, a New York appellate court reversed course on a May 2007 judgment that allowed Comcast to move the network from its second-most distributed tier to the company's sports tier.

The message said: "In spite of our efforts to continue carrying NFL Network/NFL Network HD, the NFL may terminate our rights. As a result these networks may be removed from lineups as soon as 5/1." On April 10, 2009, it was confirmed that Comcast would remove the channel on that date due to failing to reach a carriage agreement. However, on April 30, 2009, NFL Network announced that it would continue to be carried on Comcast in the interim while both sides tried to reach an agreemenet on a new contract.<ref>[https://www.boston.com/sports/football/articles/2009/04/10/comcast_to_sack_nfl_network Comcast to Sack NFL Network], ''The Boston Globe'', April 10, 2009</ref> On July 30, 2009, NFL Network was made available to lower-tiered Comcast digital cable subscribers.

NFL Network later filed a discrimination case against Comcast with the [[Federal Communications Commission]], claiming that since Comcast does not charge an extra fee for the sports channels it owns, [[NBC Sports Network|Versus]] and [[Golf Channel]], it considered Comcast's move to charge extra for NFL Network unfair. On October 10, 2008, the FCC ruled as follows:
{{quote|In the Second Report and Order, the Commission emphasized that the statute âdoes not explicitly prohibit multichannel distributors from acquiring a financial interest or exclusive rights that are otherwise permissible,â and thus, that âmultichannel distributors [may] negotiate for, but not insist upon such benefits in exchange for carriage on their systems.â The Commission stated, however, that âultimatums, intimidation, conduct that amounts to exertion of pressure beyond good faith negotiations, or behavior that is tantamount to an unreasonable refusal to deal with a vendor who refuses to grant financial interests or exclusivity rights for carriage, should be considered examples of behavior that violates the prohibitions set forth in Section 616.â We find that the NFL has presented sufficient evidence to make a [[prima facie]] showing that Comcast indirectly and improperly demanded a financial interest in the NFLâs programming in exchange for carriage. We further find that the pleadings and documentation present several factual disputes as to whether Comcastâs retiering of the NFL Network is the result of Comcastâs failure to obtain a financial interest in the NFLâs programming. Accordingly, we direct an Administrative Law Judge to hold a hearing, issue a recommended decision on the facts underlying the financial interest claim and a recommended remedy, if necessary, and then return the matter to the Commission within 60 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6604711.html|title=FCC: Programmers make case for discrimination|accessdate=22 July 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-08-2269A1.pdf FCC Order DA 08-2269]</ref>}}

==== Comcast trial ====
The trial before an administrative law judge (as ordered above) began on April 14, 2009.<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/196111-NFL_Network_s_FCC_Program_Access_Complaint_Against_Comcast_Kicks_Off_Tuesday.php NFL Network's FCC Program-Access Complaint Against Comcast Kicks Off Tuesday â ALJ Will Hear Network's Case Against Operator; Other Huddles To Follow], ''MultiChannel News'', April 13, 2009</ref> On April 17, 2009, Comcast chairman and CEO Brian Roberts testified that the provider was willing to move the channel from the Sports Entertainment Package to a lower-priced base package if the subscriber fee was reduced to 25Â¢ per month (at that time, NFL Network was charging 75Â¢ per month). He claimed that overall, Comcast saved $50 million a year in license fees by leaving the channel on its Sports Package, which in turn led to savings for its customers.<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/209442-Updated_Comcast_Would_Move_NFL_Network_Off_Tier_If_Service_Drops_Price_Roberts.php Updated: Comcast Would Move NFL Network Off Tier If Service Drops Price: Roberts â Monthly License Fee Of 25 Cents Could Trigger Broader Distribution] ''Multichannel News'' April 17, 2009</ref>

On April 30, 2009, NFL Network ''Total Access'' correspondent [[Lindsey Soto]] reported Comcast would continue to carry the network after its contract expired at midnight as negotiations proceeded. On May 19, 2009, the NFL and Comcast reached a ten-year agreement to place NFL Network on Comcast's Digital Classic package by August 1, 2009 for a monthly price between 45 and 50Â¢, instead of the 70Â¢ fee that the NFL originally requested.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/nflnetwork/story?id=09000d5d81065fa0&template=without-video&confirm=true NFL, Comcast reach long-term carriage agreement for NFL Network] ''NFL.com'', May 19, 2009</ref> This deal led to speculation that other cable operators would end their holdouts and try to reach deals that would bring the network to a wider audience. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

{{As of|2011|1|3}}, the NFL Network was available only on the Digital Preferred or Sports package on Comcast's Xfinity system in Atlanta, Georgia, and not on a Digital Classic package (which does not exist). This is contrary to the above-mentioned agreement between Comcast and the NFL.

=== Time Warner Cable ===
On December 20, 2007, the NFL Network proposed to [[Time Warner Cable]] to enter into binding [[arbitration]], which would have a neutral third party determine the price and tier for NFL Network on the provider's systems, based on fair market value of the service. The NFL Network noted that the process could take some time and offered to make the December 29, 2007 game between the then unbeaten [[New England Patriots]] and New York Giants immediately available to Time Warner Cable subscribers, upon âwritten agreement to participate in the arbitration process and to be bound by its result.â The network was willing to make the binding arbitration available to cable providers not carrying the NFL Network and for an extension of Comcast's current contract.<ref name="NFLTWCArb">{{cite web | last = Reynolds | first = Mike | title = NFL Network Play Call: Time Warner Cable Arbitration | publisher = Multichannel News | date = December 20, 2007 | url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6514693.html | accessdate = December 20, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071225184527/http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6514693.html | archive-date = December 25, 2007 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

Time Warner Cable denied the binding arbitration proposal, saying "the operator has successfully reached agreements with hundreds of programming networks without the use of arbitration. We continue to believe that the best way to achieve results is to privately seek a resolution and not attempt to negotiate through the press or elected officials.â TWC stated that it would be willing to make the network available on its sports tier, as a premium service, or make the game available to its subscribers on a per-game basis, at a retail price set by the NFL, with 100% of attendant revenue going to the league.<ref name="NFLTWCArb2">{{cite web | last = Reynolds | first = Mike | title = Britt Balks At NFL Networkâs Arbitration Play | publisher = Multichannel News | date = December 20, 2007 | url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6514749.html | accessdate = December 20, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224165207/http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6514749.html | archive-date = December 24, 2007 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

=== Cogeco ===
On November 10, 2006, Canadian cable provider Cogeco Cable announced that it had reached a carriage agreement with the NFL Network to carry the network on its "Sports & Information Tier". NFL Network had previously insisted that it would only allow cable providers to carry the network on basic tiers; Time Warner Cable stated it would only carry the network on a digital sports tier.<ref name="MultiC" /> This makes Cogeco the only major cable provider to reach an agreement with the NFL Network by placing it directly on a digital sports tier without any repercussions from the network. When it was announced that NFL Network would carry ''Run to the Playoffs'' on Cogeco but not on a digital basic tier, it was stated that Cogeco's ''Sports & Information Tier'' "has about 30% penetration across all Cogeco subscribers and 60% penetration among Cogeco [[digital cable|digital-cable]] homes."<ref name ="MultiChr3">[http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6393309.html NFL Network Is Still Plugging Holes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116130246/http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6393309.html |date=November 16, 2007 }} Multichannel</ref>

=== Dish Network ===
On February 20, 2008, [[Dish Network]] moved the NFL Network from its "America's Top 100" package to the "America's Top 200" package.
