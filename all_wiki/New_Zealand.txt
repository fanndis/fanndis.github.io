'''New Zealand''' ({{lang-mi|[[Aotearoa]]}} {{IPA-mi|aɔˈtɛaɾɔa|}}) is an [[island country]] in the southwestern [[Pacific Ocean]]. It consists of two main landmasses—the [[North Island]] (''Te Ika-a-Māui'') and the [[South Island]] (''Te Waipounamu'')—and around 600 [[List of islands of New Zealand|smaller islands]], covering a total area of {{convert|268021|km2|-2}}. New Zealand is about {{convert|2000|km|-2}} east of [[Australia]] across the [[Tasman Sea]] and {{convert|1000|km|-2}} south of the islands of [[New Caledonia]], [[Fiji]], and [[Tonga]]. The country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the [[Southern Alps]], owe much to [[tectonic uplift]] and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's [[Capital of New Zealand|capital city]] is [[Wellington]], and its most populous city is [[Auckland]].

Owing to their remoteness, the islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable lands to be settled by humans. Between about 1280 and 1350, [[Polynesians]] began to settle in the islands and then developed a distinctive [[Māori culture]]. In 1642, Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]] became the first European to sight New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and [[Māori people|Māori]] chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841, New Zealand [[Colony of New Zealand|became a colony]] within the [[British Empire]], and in 1907 it [[Dominion of New Zealand|became a dominion]]; it gained [[Independence of New Zealand|full statutory independence]] in 1947, and the British monarch remained the [[head of state]]. Today, the majority of [[New Zealand's population]] of 5 million is of [[European New Zealanders|European descent]]; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by [[Asian New Zealanders|Asians]] and [[Pacific Islander]]s. Reflecting this, [[New Zealand's culture]] is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers, with recent broadening arising from increased [[Immigration to New Zealand|immigration]]. The [[Languages of New Zealand|official languages]] are [[English language|English]], [[Māori language|Māori]], and [[New Zealand Sign Language]], with English being very dominant.

A [[developed country]], New Zealand [[international rankings of New Zealand|ranks highly]] in international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, education, protection of [[civil liberties]], government transparency, and [[economic freedom]]. New Zealand underwent [[Rogernomics|major economic changes]] during the 1980s, which transformed it from a [[protectionist]] to a [[economic liberalization|liberalised]] [[free-trade]] economy. The service sector dominates the [[Economy of New Zealand|national economy]], followed by the industrial sector, and [[Agriculture in New Zealand|agriculture]]; international [[tourism in New Zealand|tourism]] is a significant source of revenue. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, [[unicameral]] [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], while executive political power is exercised by the [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]], led by the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]], currently [[Jacinda Ardern]]. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is the [[monarchy of New Zealand|country's monarch]] and is represented by a [[Governor-General of New Zealand|governor-general]], currently [[Dame Patsy Reddy]]. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 [[Regions of New Zealand|regional councils]] and 67 [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authorities]] for local government purposes. The [[Realm of New Zealand]] also includes [[Tokelau]] (a [[dependent territory]]); the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] (self-governing states in [[Associated state|free association]] with New Zealand); and the [[Ross Dependency]], which is New Zealand's [[territorial claim in Antarctica]].

New Zealand is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[ANZUS]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], [[ASEAN#ASEAN Plus Six|ASEAN Plus Six]], [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]], the [[Pacific Community]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]].
