The '''United States embargo against Cuba''' prevents American businesses, and businesses with commercial activities in the United States, from conducting trade with Cuban interests. It is the most enduring [[trade embargo]] in modern history. The United States first imposed an embargo on the sale of arms to Cuba on March 14, 1958, during the [[Fulgencio Batista]] regime. Again on October 19, 1960 (almost two years after the [[Cuban Revolution]] had led to the deposition of the Batista regime) the U.S. placed an embargo on exports to Cuba except for food and medicine after Cuba [[nationalization|nationalized]] American-owned Cuban oil refineries without compensation. On  February 7, 1962 the embargo was extended to include almost all exports. The embargo does not prohibit the trade of food and humanitarian supplies.<ref>{{cite web|title= Case Studies in Economic Sanctions and Terrorism: US v.

{{As of|2018}}, the embargo is enforced mainly through six statutes: the [[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917]], the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] of 1961, the [[Cuban Assets Control Regulations]] of 1963, the [[Cuban Democracy Act]] of 1992, the [[Helms–Burton Act]] of 1996, and the [[Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act]] of 2000.<ref name=amnesty>{{cite web|title= The US Embargo Against Cuba: Its Impact on Economic and Social Rights|url= https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr25/007/2009/en/|publisher= Amnesty International|accessdate= December 29, 2013|date= September 2009|df= mdy-all}}</ref> The stated purpose of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 is to maintain sanctions on Cuba as long as the Cuban government refuses to move toward "democratization and greater respect for human rights".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://1997-2001.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/democ_act_1992.html |title= Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 |publisher= U.S. Department of State }}</ref> The Helms-Burton Act further restricted United States citizens from doing [[commerce|business]] in or with Cuba, and mandated restrictions on giving public or private assistance to any successor government in [[Havana]] unless and until certain claims against the Cuban government were met. In 1999 President [[Bill Clinton]] expanded the trade embargo by also disallowing foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies to trade with Cuba. In 2000, Clinton authorized the sale of food and "humanitarian" products to Cuba.

In Cuba, the embargo is called '''{{lang|es|el bloqueo}}''' (the blockade), despite there being no [[naval blockade]] of the country by the United States since the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKWHA-144.aspx |title= 515 - The President's News Conference November 20, 1962 |work= White House Audio Recordings, 1961-1963 |publisher= John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum}}</ref> The Cuban government frequently blames the US "blockade" for the economic problems of Cuba. The United States has threatened to stop financial aid to other countries if they trade non-food items with Cuba. However, because the embargo is not popularly supported internationally and other countries are not under the jurisdiction of U.S. law, U.S. attempts to discourage its allies from trading with Cuba have not been successful. The US's attempts to do so have been vocally condemned by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] as an extraterritorial measure that contravenes "the sovereign equality of States, non-intervention in their internal affairs and freedom of trade and navigation as paramount to the conduct of international affairs".<ref name="un.org">{{cite web|url= https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/ga11162.doc.htm |title= Speakers Denounce Cuban Embargo as 'Sad Echo' of Failed Cold War Politics; General Assembly, for Twentieth Year, Demands Lifting of Economic Blockade |publisher= Un.org |accessdate= December 6, 2013}}</ref>{{pb}}Despite the existence of the embargo, Cuba can, and does, conduct international trade with many countries, including many US allies; however, US based companies which trade in Cuba do so at the risk of US sanctions.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/isdb_results/factsheets/country/details_cuba_en.pdf |title= European Union, Trade in goods with Cuba |publisher= European Commission |accessdate= July 9, 2019}}</ref> Cuba has been a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] since 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/cuba_e.htm |title= Cuba - Member information |publisher= WTO |accessdate= December 6, 2013}}</ref> The European Union is Cuba's largest trading partner, and the United States is the fifth-largest exporter to Cuba (6.6% of Cuba's imports come from the US).<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cu.html |title=Cuba |work=The World Factbook |publisher= Cia.gov |accessdate= June 9, 2012 }}</ref> Cuba must, however, pay cash for all imports, as credit is not allowed.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8232907.stm | publisher= BBC News | title= End embargo on Cuba, US is urged | date= September 2, 2009 | accessdate= May 26, 2010 }}</ref>

==History==

=== Eisenhower era ===
[[File: Fidel Castro - UN General Assembly 1960.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Fidel Castro]] at a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly (1960)]]
The United States imposed an arms embargo on Cuba on March 14, 1958, during the armed conflict of 1953-1958 between rebels led by [[Fidel Castro]] and the [[Fulgencio Batista]] régime. Arms sales violated U.S. policy which had permitted the sale of weapons to Latin-American countries which had signed the 1947 [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]] (Rio Treaty) as long as the weapons were not used for hostile purposes.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/cuban-rebels/4-3-58-embargo.htm|title= U.S. Embargo Set on Arms to Cuba; Shipment Halted|last= Wiskari|first= Werner|date= April 3, 1958|newspaper= The New York Times|access-date= February 8, 2017|via= latinamericanstudies.org}}</ref> The arms embargo had more of an impact on Batista than on the rebels. After the Castro socialist government came to power on January 1, 1959, Castro made overtures to the United States but was rebuffed by the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] administration, which by March began making plans to help overthrow him. Congress did not want to lift the embargo.

In May 1960 the Cuban government began regularly and openly purchasing armaments from the [[Soviet Union]], citing the US arms embargo. In July 1960 the United States reduced the import quota of [[brown sugar]] from Cuba to 700,000 tons under the ''Sugar Act of 1948'';<ref>Haass, Richard N. Economic Sanctions and American Diplomacy. 1998.</ref> and the Soviet Union responded by agreeing to purchase the sugar instead.

In October 1960 a key incident occurred: Eisenhower's government refused to export oil to the island, leaving Cuba reliant on Soviet crude oil, which the American companies in Cuba refused to refine. This led the Cuban government to [[nationalize]] all three American-owned oil refineries in Cuba in response. The refinery owners were not compensated for the nationalization of their property. The refineries became part of the state-run company, [[Cupet| Unión Cuba-Petróleo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/|title= Chicago Tribune - Historical Newspapers|website= Chicago Tribune}}

|quote = The embargo against Cuba started in October 1960 after Cuba exercised its sovereign right to nationalize U.S. properties. The move came as a response to the Eisenhower administration's cancellation of the sugar quota, which stipulated the import of 700,000 tons of sugar to Cuba. The administration had also prohibited delivery of oil to the island, forcing Cuba to buy from the Soviet Union. On Washington's orders, multinational oil companies refused to refine the Soviet oil, leaving Cuba no choice but to nationalize the companies.

This prompted the Eisenhower administration to launch the first trade embargo—a prohibition against selling all products to Cuba except food and medicine. The Cuban regime responded with nationalization of all American [[companies | businesses]] and most American privately owned properties on the island. No compensation was given for the seizures, and a number of diplomats were expelled from Cuba.

The second wave of nationalizations prompted the Eisenhower administration, in one of its last actions, to sever all diplomatic relations with Cuba in January 1961. The U.S. partial trade embargo with Cuba continued under the ''[[Trading with the Enemy Act 1917]]''.

===Kennedy era===

==== The Bay of Pigs invasion and Cuba's declaration of Marxism ====
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--only one citation in section-->
After the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in April 1961, which had been largely planned under the Eisenhower administration, but which Kennedy had been informed of and approved during the months preceding his presidency and in his first few months as president, the Cuban government declared that it now considered itself Marxist and socialist, and aligned with the Soviet Union. On September 4, 1961, partly in response, Congress passed the ''[[Foreign Assistance Act]]'', a [[Cold War]] Act (among many other measures) which prohibited aid to Cuba and authorized the President to impose a complete trade embargo against Cuba.

On January 21, 1962, Cuba was suspended by the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), by a vote of 14 in favor, one (Cuba) against with six abstentions. (See [[Cuba–OAS relations]].) Mexico and Ecuador, two abstaining members, argued that the expulsion was not authorized in the OAS Charter.<ref>''[[CounterPunch]]'', June 18, 2009, {{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/sandels06182009.html |title=U.S. Cuba Policy: A Case of Post Diplomatic Stress Disorder }}</ref> Multilateral sanctions were imposed by OAS on July 26, 1964, which were later rescinded on July 29, 1975. [[Cuba–OAS relations|Cuban relations with OAS]] have since improved, and suspension of membership was lifted on June 3, 2009.

President [[John F. Kennedy]] extended measures by [[Executive order]], first widening the scope of the trade restrictions on February 8, 1962 (announced on February 3 and again on March 23, 1962). These measures expanded the embargo to include all imports of products containing Cuban goods, even if the final products had been made or assembled outside Cuba.

On August 3, 1962, the ''Foreign Assistance Act'' was amended to prohibit aid to any country that provides assistance to Cuba.

On September 7, 1962, Kennedy formally expanded the Cuban embargo to include all Cuban trade, except for the non-subsidized sale of food and medicines

====Cuban Missile Crisis====
Following the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (October 1962), Kennedy imposed travel restrictions on February 8, 1963, and the ''[[Cuban Assets Control Regulations]]'' were issued on July 8, 1963, again under the ''[[Trading with the Enemy Act 1917|Trading with the Enemy Act]]'' in response to Cubans hosting Soviet nuclear weapons. Under these restrictions, Cuban assets in the U.S. were frozen and existing restrictions were consolidated.

=== Temporary lapse of restrictions, and reinstatement ===
The restrictions on U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba lapsed on March 19, 1977;<ref>{{cite book |last=Franklin |first=Jane |title=Cuba and the United States: A Chronological History |url=https://archive.org/details/cubaunitedstates0000fran/page/132 |accessdate=September 28, 2014 |year=1997 |publisher=Ocean Press |isbn=9781875284924 |page=[https://archive.org/details/cubaunitedstates0000fran/page/132 132] }}</ref> the regulation was renewable every six months, but President [[Jimmy Carter]] did not renew it and the regulation on spending [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] in Cuba was lifted shortly afterwards.<ref>http://www.historyofcuba.com/embargo/EmbargoTimeline.pdf</ref><ref name=castroban>http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a487629.pdf</ref> President [[Ronald Reagan]] reinstated the trade embargo on April 19, 1982, though it was now only restricted to business and tourist travel and did not apply to travel by U.S.

engaging in professional research, or persons visiting their close relatives.<ref name=castroban />  This has been modified subsequently with the present regulation, effective June 30, 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/actions/20040616.html |title=Recent OFAC Actions |publisher=Office of Foreign Assets Control, United States Department of the Treasury |date=June 16, 2004 |accessdate=November 5, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102043211/http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/actions/20040616.html |archive-date=November 2, 2006 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> being the [[Cuban Assets Control Regulations]], 31 C.F.R. part 515.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=fb4974a82c28f07b7b95587729bf21e1;rgn=div5;view=text;node=31%3A3.1.1.1.3;idno=31;cc=ecfr |title=Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 515}}</ref>

The current regulation does not prohibit travel by U.S. citizens to Cuba ''per se'', but it makes it illegal for U.S. citizens to have transactions (spend money or receive gifts) in Cuba under most circumstances without a US government [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] issued license.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs/cuba/gls/cuba_gl.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=May 30, 2008 |publisher=Office of Foreign Assets Control |title=Cuban Assets Control Regulations |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528150713/http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs/cuba/gls/cuba_gl.pdf |archive-date=May 28, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> Since even paying unavoidable airfare ticket taxes into a Cuban airport would violate this transaction law, it is effectively impossible for ordinary tourists to visit Cuba without breaking the monetary transaction rule.

===Helms–Burton Act===
The embargo was reinforced in October 1992 by the ''[[Cuban Democracy Act]]'' (the "Torricelli Law") and in 1996 by the ''Cuban Liberty and Democracy Solidarity Act'' (known as the [[Helms–Burton Act]]) which penalizes foreign companies that do business in Cuba by preventing them from doing business in the U.S. Justification provided for these restrictions was that these companies were trafficking in stolen U.S. properties, and should, thus, be excluded from the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} However, President Obama tried to lift the embargo, but congress did not allow it.

The European Union resented the Helms-Burton Act because it felt that the U.S. was dictating how other nations ought to conduct their trade and challenged it on that basis. The EU eventually dropped its challenge in favor of negotiating a solution.<ref>{{cite news | date = April 22, 1998 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/81461.stm | title = EU suspends challenge against controversial US law | publisher = BBC News | accessdate =October 29, 2006  }}</ref>

After Cuba shot down two unarmed brothers planes in 1996, killing three Americans and a U.S. resident, a bi-partisan coalition in the United States Congress approved the Helms-Burton Act.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The Title III of this law also states that any non-U.S. company that "knowingly trafficks in property in Cuba confiscated without compensation from a U.S. person" can be subjected to litigation and that company's leadership can be barred from entry into the United States. Sanctions may also be applied to non-U.S. companies trading with Cuba. This restriction also applies to maritime shipping, as ships docking at Cuban ports are not allowed to dock at U.S. ports for six months. It's important to note that this title includes waiver authority, so that the President might suspend its application. This waiver must be renewed every six months and traditionally it has been.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In response to pressure from some American farmers and [[agribusiness]], the embargo was relaxed by the [[Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act]], which was passed by the [[United States Congress|Congress]] in October 2000 and signed by President [[Bill Clinton]]. The relaxation allowed the sale of agricultural goods and medicine to Cuba for [[humanitarian]] reasons. Although Cuba initially declined to engage in such trade (having even refused U.S. food aid in the past,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/168987.stm|title=Cuba to reject US aid|publisher=BBC|date=September 11, 1998  }}</ref> seeing it as a half-measure serving U.S. interests), the Cuban government began to allow the purchase of food from the U.S. as a result of [[Hurricane Michelle]] in November 2001. These purchases have grown since then{{dubious|date=January 2015}}, even though all sales are made in cash. In 2007, the U.S. was the largest food supplier of Cuba, which nevertheless is largely self-sufficient,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/CubaVerdad/message/36022|title=US Remains Cuba's Top Food Source, Exported $600M in Agricultural Products to Island in 2007|agency=Associated Press|date=January 22, 2008 }}</ref> and its fifth largest trading partner.

In some tourist spots across the island, American brands such as [[Coca-Cola]] can be purchased. Ford tankers refuel planes in airports and some computers use Microsoft software.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displayStory.cfm?story_id=11920925 |title=Patchy blockade|publisher=The Economist|date=August 14, 2008 }}</ref> The origin of the financing behind such goods is not always clear. The goods often come from third parties based in countries outside the U.S., even if the product being dealt originally has U.S. shareholders or investors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.autentico.org/oa09537.php|title=U.S. goods, people, cash pour into Cuba|website=www.autentico.org}}</ref> This can be seen, for example, with [[Nestlé]] products (which have a 10% US ownership) that can be bought in Cuba with [[Cuban convertible peso]]s (CUCs). These CUC pesos are hard currency that are traded in foreign exchange against the US dollar, Euro and other currencies.

===Easing the embargo===

====Cuban-Americans====
On April 13, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] eased the travel ban, allowing Cuban-Americans to travel freely to Cuba;<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/13/some-cuba-travel-restrict_n_186197.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Obama Lifting Cuba Travel Restrictions | date=April 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/memorandum-promoting-democracy-and-human-rights-cuba | work=White House | title= Memorandum: Promoting Democracy and Human Rights in Cuba | date=April 13, 2009 }}</ref> and on January 14, 2011, he further eased the ban, by allowing students and religious missionaries to travel to Cuba if they meet certain restrictions.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Reaching Out to the Cuban People |publisher= The White House|date=January 14, 2011 |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/14/reaching-out-cuban-people }}</ref>

====General changes====
On July 16, 2012, the ''[[Ana Cecilia]]'' became the first officially sanctioned direct ship to sail from Miami to Cuba.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/07/20127147196482238.html |title=Cuba receives first US shipment in 50 years - Americas |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=December 6, 2013}}</ref> It carried food, medicine and personal hygiene goods sent by Cuban-Americans to family members.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris Arsenault |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/07/2012716113551153900.html |title=US aid ship in Cuba: Ending the embargo? - Features |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=December 6, 2013}}</ref>

In 2014, the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] announced its intention to re-establish relations with Cuba.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/17/world/americas/cuba-sanctions.html?smid=pl-share&_r=0 | title=How America's Relationship With Cuba Will Change}}</ref> In January 2015, the Administration lightened restrictions on U.S. citizen travel to Cuba. While restrictions on travel for missionary work and education have been loosened, visits for tourism remain banned. President Obama and President [[Raúl Castro]] of Cuba met on April 11, 2015, which was the first meeting between distinct leaders of the two countries in over fifty years.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> In May 2015, several American companies reported they had been granted licenses to establish ferry travel between Florida and Cuba,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-32602923 | title=US approves ferry service between Cuba and Florida}}</ref> with a U.S. Department of Treasury spokeswoman confirming they had begun issuing licenses.

On September 21, 2015, the Commerce and Treasury Departments took additional coordinated actions in support of the President's Cuba policy. These actions included a rule published by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) that amended the terms of existing license exceptions that are available for Cuba, increased the number of license exception provisions that are available for Cuba, created a new Cuba licensing policy to help ensure the safety of civil aviation and the safe operation of commercial passenger aircraft, and made the deemed export and deemed reexport license requirements for Cuba consistent with other sanctioned destinations.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/country-guidance/sanctioned-destinations/cuba | title=US Department of Commerce guidance on Cuba}}</ref>

====Investment in Cuba by Americans====
In February 2016, the U.S. Government allowed two American men from Alabama to build a factory that will assemble as many as 1,000 small tractors a year for sale to private farmers in Cuba. The $5 million to $10 million plant would be the first significant U.S. business investment on Cuban soil since 1959. They expect to start making deliveries in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Obama administration has approved the first U.S. factory in Cuba in more than half a century, allowing a pair of former software engineers to build a plant assembling as many as 1,000 small tractors a year|url = https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2016-02-15/apnewsbreak-us-oks-first-factory-in-cuba-since-revolution|website = US News & World Report|date = February 15, 2016|access-date = February 15, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = US OK's first factory in Cuba since revolution|agency=Associated Press| first= Michael | last = Weissenstein | url = http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/nation-world/world/article60440516.html|website = thenewstribune|access-date = February 15, 2016}}</ref>

===Reestablishment of diplomatic relations===

===Impacts===
In November 1991, the Cuban ambassador, [[Ricardo Alarcón]], in a speech to the UN General Assembly, cited 27 recent cases of trade contracts interrupted by US pressure.  The British journal [[Cuba Business]] claimed that [[British Petroleum]] was seemingly dissuaded by US authorities from investing in offshore oil exploration in Cuba despite being initially keenly interested.  The Petroleum economist claimed, in September 1992, that the [[US State Department]] vigorously discouraged firms like [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and [[Clyde Petroleum]] from investing in Cuba. This pressure did not work in all cases. According to the Mexican Newspaper [[El Financiero]], the US ambassador to Mexico, [[John Negroponte]] travelled to meet two Mexican business men who had signed a textile deal with Cuba on October 17, 1992.  Despite the representation, the deal went ahead and was eventually worth $500 million in foreign capital.  All of this happened before the signing of the Cuban Democracy Act.<ref>Cuba in the International System: Normalization and integration, 1995 - editors Archibald Ritter and John Kirk, St. Martin's Press {{ISBN|0-312-12653-0}} - article by Andrew Zimbalist</ref>

=== Economic impacts ===
The [[U.S. sanctions]] on Cuba and their economic impacts can be traced back to when they were first implemented in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Economic Impact of U.S. Sanctions With Respect to Cuba|author=U.S. International Trade Commission|publisher=U.S. International Trade Commission|year=February 2001|location=Washington, DC|pages=332–414}}</ref>

In 2009, the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]] estimated that the embargo was costing the United States economy $1.2 billion per year as a result of the legal structures that prevented American exporters from entering Cuban markets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2009/0309pepper.html|title=The Costs of the Embargo {{!}} Dollars & Sense|website=www.dollarsandsense.org|access-date=2017-03-07}}</ref> The Cuba Policy Foundation (CPF) has provided more extreme data; its estimates put the cost of the embargo at $4.84 billion per year while costing Cuba $685 million per year.[[United States embargo against Cuba#cite note-36|[3]]] Cuba is estimated to have lost over $28.6 billion in trade, according to a 1992 study published by the Cuban Central Planning Board's Institute of Economic Research.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coha.org/blockade-harms-us-more-than-cuba/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317022046/https://www.coha.org/blockade-harms-us-more-than-cuba/|archive-date=2018-03-17|title=Blockade Harms U.S. More Than Cuba|language=en-US}}</ref>

Between 1954 and 1959, trade between Cuba and the United States was at a higher level than what it is today, with 65% of Cuba's total exports sent to the United States while American imports totaled 74% percent of Cuba's international purchases. After the formal implementation of the embargo and the passage of Proclamation 3355, there was a 95% decrease in Cuba's sugar quota, which canceled roughly 700,000 tons of the 3,119,655 tons previously allotted to the United States.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Caraway|first=Rose|year=2004|title=Post-embargo Cuba: Economic Implications and the Future of Socialism|url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/etext/llilas/ilassa/2004/caraway.pdf|journal=Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies|pages=30}}</ref> A year later, Cuba's sugar quota was reduced to zero when [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] issued Proclamation 3383. This substantially affected Cuba's total exports, as Cuba was one of the world's leading sugar exporters at the time.<ref name=":0" />

In 1989, with the collapse of the [[Soviet Bloc|Soviet bloc]], Cuba witnessed its most devastating economic crises. Cuba's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] plummeted 34% and trade between the nations apart from the [[Council of Mutual Economic Assistance]] (CMEA) declined by 56%.<ref name=":0" /> Between 1989 and 1992, the termination of traditional trade partnerships with the Soviet bloc caused the total value of Cuba's exports to fall by 61% and imports to drop by approximately 72%. This period is known as the [[Special Period]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Failed sanctions: why the U.S. embargo against Cuba could never work|last=Spadoni|first=Paolo|publisher=University Press of Florida|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8130-3515-4|location=Gainesville|pages=xvi}}</ref> Supporters of the embargo and many international economists believed that the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the resultant economic crisis would lead to the downfall of Fidel Castro's government. However, Cuba's government instituted a campaign of macroeconomic adjustment and liberalization, which helped significant economic recovery.<ref name=":0" />

According to a 2001 [[United States International Trade Commission|U.S. International Trade Commission]] report in response to a request made by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], the total value of U.S. exports of selected agricultural products, intermediate goods, and manufactured goods to Cuba in the absence of U.S. sanctions was estimated to be at $146 and $658 million for U.S. imports from Cuba between 1996 and 1998.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=U.S. International Trade Commission|year=February 2001|title=The Economic Impact of U.S. Sanctions With Respect to Cuba|url=https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub3398.pdf|journal=U.S. International Trade Commission Investigation|volume=Investigation No. 332-413|pages=390|via=U.S. International Trade Commission Website}}</ref>

Recently, the United States Commerce's [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] (BIS) has become more lenient with some of the sanctions imposed upon Cuba by introducing new streamlined procedures to expedite processing of license applications for exporting eligible agricultural commodities to Cuba. As a result, annual U.S. exports to Cuba have risen from $6 million to about $350 million between 2000 and 2006. Over this period, U.S. exports to Cuba have totaled more than $1.5 billion. As of 2006, agricultural products comprised 98% of total U.S. exports to Cuba.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0880.pdf|title=Economic Sanctions: Agencies Face Competing Priorities in Enforcing the U.S. Embargo on Cuba|author=United States Government Accountability Office|date=November 2007|website=U.S. Governmental Accountability Office|access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref>

===Socio-economic effects===
The [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] estimates that the embargo costs the U.S. economy $1.2 billion per year in lost sales and exports, while the Cuban government estimates that the embargo has cost the island itself $753.69 billion.<ref>{{cite web| last =Pepper| first =Margot|date=March–April 2009 | url =http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2009/0309pepper.html| title =The Costs of the Embargo: The 47-year-old blockade now costs the United States far more than it costs Cuba.| publisher =[[Dollars & Sense]]| accessdate =May 1, 2009

The 1998 [[U.S. State Department]] report ''Zenith and Eclipse: A Comparative Look at Socio-Economic Conditions in Pre-Castro and Present Day Cuba''<ref>[https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/wha/ci/14776.htm ]</ref> attributed Cuba's economic penury not as a result of the embargo, but instead the lack of foreign currency due to the unwillingness of Cuba to liberalize its economy and diversify its export base during the years of abundant Soviet aid. Cuba also amassed substantial debts owed to its Japanese, European, and Latin American trading partners during the years of abundant Soviet aid.

According to critics, one of the major problems with the embargo is that the United States is the only major country that has such an embargo against Cuba in place. Cuba still receives tourists and trade from other countries making the embargo appear both illegitimate and pointless.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2013/01/16/its-time-for-the-u-s-to-end-its-senseless-embargo-of-cuba/|title=It's Time For The U.S. To End Its Senseless Embargo Of Cuba|date=January 16, 2013|work=Forbes|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}</ref>

===Restrictions on tourism by U.S. citizens and residents===
[[File:Cuba-Florida map.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cuba]] is 90 miles (145 kilometres) south of [[Florida]]]]
Under the [[Cuban Assets Control Regulations]] persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction must obtain a licence to engage in any travel-related transactions pursuant to travel to, from, and within Cuba. Transactions related solely to tourist travel are not licensable.

Spurred by a burgeoning interest in the assumed untapped product demand in Cuba, a growing number of [[free-market]]ers in Congress, backed by [[American West|Western]] and [[Great Plains]] lawmakers who represent agribusiness, have tried each year since 2000 to water down or lift regulations preventing Americans from traveling to Cuba. Four times over that time period the [[United States House of Representatives]] has adopted language lifting the travel ban, and in 2003 the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] followed suit for the first time. Each time President [[George W. Bush]] threatened to [[veto]] the bill. Faced with a veto threat, each year Congress dropped its attempt to lift the travel ban before sending legislation to the president.

Some United States nationals circumvent the ban by traveling to Cuba from a different country, such as Mexico, The Bahamas, Canada or Costa Rica. Cuban immigration authorities do not routinely stamp passports, instead stamping a Cuban visa page which is provided, and not permanently affixed to the passport. However, the practice still opens U.S. citizens to a risk of prosecution and fines by the U.S. government if discovered. Until July 20, 2015 there was no U.S. Embassy or consulate in Cuba and United States representation was limited to a [[United States Interests Section in Havana|United States Interests Section]].

The United States Treasury Department's [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC) considers any visit of more than one day to be ''[[prima facie]]'' proof of violation. OFAC also holds that U.S. citizens may not receive goods or services for free from any Cuban national, eliminating any attempts to circumvent the regulation based on that premise. On July 25, 2011, OFAC declared that the "people to people" relaxation of restrictions on travel conceded by the Obama administration should not be mistakenly interpreted as promoting tourism.

On October 10, 2006, the United States announced the creation of a task force will pursue more aggressively violations of the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba, with severe penalties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=146094|title=US tightens Cuba embargo enforcement|publisher=Agence France Presse|work=turkishpress.com|date=October 10, 2006|accessdate=November 5, 2006 }}</ref> The regulations are still in force and are administered by OFAC. Criminal penalties for violating the embargo range up to ten years in prison, $1 million in corporate fines, and $250,000 in individual fines; civil penalties up to $55,000 per violation.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In September 2016, ''Newsweek'' reported that then future President [[Donald Trump]]'s hotel company violated the embargo, spending a minimum of $68,000 for its 1998 foray into Cuba without U.S. government approval. With Trump's knowledge, executives funneled the cash for the Cuba trip through an American consulting firm called Seven Arrows Investment and Development Corp. Once the business consultants traveled to Cuba and incurred the expenses for the venture, Seven Arrows instructed senior officers with Trump's company—then called Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts—how to make it appear legal by linking it after the fact to a charitable effort.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Eichenwald|first1=Kurt|title=How Donald Trump's Company Violated the United States Embargo Against Cuba|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2016/10/14/donald-trump-cuban-embargo-castro-violated-florida-504059.html|accessdate=6 January 2017|agency=Newsweek|date=29 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Eichenwald|first1=Kurt|title=Donald Trump Still Won't Tell the Truth About Cuba|url=http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-cuba-embargo-florida-fidel-castro-cuban-americans-havana-505067|accessdate=6 January 2017|agency=Newsweek|date=30 September 2016}}</ref>

{{quote box
| quote  = Future students of American history will be scratching their heads about this case for decades to come. Our embargo and refusal to normalize diplomatic relations has nothing to do with communism. Otherwise, we wouldn't have had diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War, with China since Nixon, and with Vietnam despite our bitter war there. No, Cuba was pure politics. Though it started out to be a measure of an administration's resistance to Castro's politics, it very soon became a [[straitjacket]] whereby first-generation Cuban-Americans wielded inordinate political power over both parties and constructed a veto over rational, mature diplomacy.

The Helms-Burton Act has been the target of criticism from Canadian and European governments in particular, who object to what they say is the extraterritorial pretensions of a piece of legislation aimed at punishing non-U.S. corporations and non-U.S. investors who have economic interests in Cuba. In the [[House of Commons of Canada]], Helms-Burton was mocked by the introduction of the [[Godfrey-Milliken Bill]], which called for the return of property of [[United Empire Loyalists]] seized by the American government as a result of the [[American Revolution]] (the bill never became law). The [[European Council]] has stated that it:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&mode=XML&reference=A4-1996-0329&language=EN |title=Report on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) on protecting against the effects of the application of certain legislation of certain third countries, and actions based thereon or resulting therefrom (COM(96)0420 - C4-0519/96 - 96/0217(CNS))}} European Parliament Official Report</ref>

It called upon President Clinton to waive the provisions of Title III and expressed serious concern at the measures already taken to implement Title IV of the Act. The Council identified a range of measures which could be deployed by the EU in response to the damage to the interests of EU companies resulting from the implementation of the Act. Among these are the following:
# a move to a WTO dispute settlement panel;
#'changes in the procedures governing entry by representatives of US companies to EU Member States;
# the use/introduction of legislation within the EU to neutralize the extraterritorial effects of the US legislation;
# the establishment of a watch list of US companies filing Title III actions.}}

Some critics say that the embargo actually helps the regime more than it hurts it, by providing it with a bogeyman for all of Cuba's misfortunes. [[Hillary Clinton]] publicly shared the view that the embargo helps the Castros, noting that "It is my personal belief that the Castros do not want to see an end to the embargo and do no want to see normalization with the United States." Clinton said in the same interview that "we're open to changing with them."

In a 2005 interview, [[George P.

Some American business leaders openly call for an end to the embargo. They argue, as long as the embargo continues, non-U.S. foreign businesses in Cuba that violate the embargo, do not have to compete with U.S. businesses, and thus, will have a head start when and if the embargo is lifted.<ref>{{cite web | last =Chirinos | first =Fanny S.| date =March 30, 2006| url =http://www.caller.com/ccct/local_news/article/0,1641,CCCT_811_4582172,00.html| title =Bonilla calls for end to Cuba trade embargo| publisher =caller.com| accessdate =October 22, 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012195201/http://caller.com/ccct/local_news/article/0,1641,CCCT_811_4582172,00.html |archive-date = October 12, 2007}}</ref>

=== Proponents ===
Proponents of the embargo argue that the Cubans have done much to antagonize the United States and Cuba deserves to be under an embargo as they have been an especially unfriendly government. The Cubans backed, armed, and fought with militant movements that attempted to overthrow U.S. allies and targeted U.S. interests throughout Latin America and Africa for decades. One example of this was Cuba's assistance to FARC in their operations through several South American countries, especially Colombia.  Another example is Cuba's shooting down of unarmed American civilian aircraft whose pilots were known for protesting the Castro regime.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Furthermore, proponents argue that Cuba has little to offer the United States economically. From the United States viewpoint, Cuba's one party semi-dictatorial form of government is especially undesirable due to characteristics such as its crackdowns on religious freedom, repression of the press, and repression of almost all criticism of the government. These policies are allegedly designed to ensure one party, dictatorial rule for as long as possible.{{According to whom|date=February 2020}} Many in the United States profoundly disagree with Cuba's historical policies of severely limiting private property ownership and property rights in order to attain a more communistic society. The danger that Cuba will try to export its form of government, especially into the United States, is a national security threat due to Cuba's close proximity to the United States. This is not an unfounded threat as Cuba has launched several military campaigns, by itself and with other usually hostile nations, designed to export its undesirable form of government in the past.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Cuba does not have an advanced industrial base and manufactures little of value that could be traded with the United States if the embargo was lifted. U.S. demand for products that Cuba does export are generally easily covered by domestic production or trade relations with more economically reliable and friendlier nations. It is true that Cuba's state medical program has indigenously made some advancements in the treatments of some cancer and heavily state subsidized medical industries from Cuba have driven down costs, even to poor foreigners, for those who could not otherwise afford medical treatment. Despite this exception, benefits from lifting the embargo would be very one sided in Cuba's favor. Cuban benefits would include the easing of the frequent shortages of goods the island experiences, additional low cost services not readily available in Cuba, and access to new and better technology for personal consumption and economic development.

For these reasons proponents argue that lifting the embargo is not advantageous to the United States or Cuba's population, until economic or political reforms are enacted by the Cubans.

==Polling data and public opinion==
A 2008 [[USA Today]]/Gallup Poll indicated that Americans believed that diplomatic relations "should" be re-established with Cuba.

In January 2012 an [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]] poll showed that 57% of Americans called for ending the travel ban that prevented most Americans from visiting Cuba, with 27% disagreeing and 16% not sure.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://angusreid.org/most-americans-willing-to-re-establish-ties-with-cuba/ |title= Most Americans Willing to Re-establish Ties with Cuba |publisher= Angus-reid.com |accessdate= December 6, 2013}}</ref>

Polls show declining support for sanctions among [[Cuban Americans]]. A June 2014 poll showed 52% of Cuban Americans in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]], opposed the embargo and 48% supported it; 56% of Cuban Americans in Miami-Dade County had supported the embargo in 2011, while 87% had supported it in 1991.<ref>
