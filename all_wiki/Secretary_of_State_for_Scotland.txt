The '''Secretary of State for Scotland''' ({{lang-gd|Rùnaire Stàite na h-Alba}}, {{lang-sco|Secretar o State fir Scotland}}), also referred to as the '''Scottish Secretary''', is the [[secretary of state]] and principal [[government minister]] for [[Scotland]] in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] of [[Her Majesty's Government]] of the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. The Scottish Secretary heads the [[Scotland Office]] (formerly the [[Scottish Office]]), a [[Departments of the Government of the United Kingdom|government department]] based in [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]].

==Post history==
===Prior to devolution (before 1999)===

The post was first created after the [[Acts of Union 1707]] created the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] from the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. It was abolished in 1746, following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]. Scottish affairs thereafter were managed by the [[Lord Advocate]] until 1827, when responsibility passed to the [[Home Office]]. In 1885 the post of Secretary for Scotland was re-created, with the incumbent usually a member of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. In 1926 this post was upgraded to a full [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] appointment.

===After devolution (since 1999)===

After the [[History of Scottish devolution|1999 Scottish]] [[devolution]], the powers of the [[Scottish Office]] were divided, with most transferred to the [[Scottish Government]] or to other [[British government departments]], leaving only a limited role for the [[Scotland Office]]. From June 2003 and October 2008, the holder of the office of Secretary of State for Scotland from 13 June 2003 through to 3 October 2008 also held another Cabinet post concurrently, leading to claims that the Scottish role was seen as a part-time ministry.

The current Secretary of State for Scotland is [[Alister Jack]], who was appointed by [[Boris Johnson]], replacing [[David Mundell]].

==Responsibilities==
With the advent of legislative devolution for Scotland in 1999, the role of Secretary of State for Scotland was diminished. Most of the functions vested in the office since administrative devolution in the 19th century were transferred to the newly-established Scottish Ministers upon the opening of the Scottish Parliament, or to other UK government ministers. However the Secretary of State does represent Scotland in the Cabinet on matters that are not devolved to Holyrood and also holds Scotland Questions on the first Wednesday of every month between 11:30 am and 12 noon, when any Member of Parliament can ask a question on any matter relating to Scotland. However devolved issues are not usually raised by MPs. The Secretary is also the group leader of the Scottish MPs from the government party.

As a result of this, the office mainly acts as a go-between for the UK and Scottish Governments and Parliaments.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/secretary-of-state-for-scotland|title=Secretary of State for Scotland - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref> However, due to the Secretary's position as a minister in the British government, the convention of [[Cabinet collective responsibility]] applies, and as such the post is usually viewed as being a partisan one to promote the UK government's decision-making in Scotland, as adherence to the convention precludes doing anything else.

With the rise of the Scottish National Party in the Scottish and British parliaments and the resultant interest in Scottish Independence, the Secretary of State's role has also subsequently increased in prominence. The Scotland Office itself has received a cumulative increase in budget of 20% from 2013 to 2017, with a 14.4% increase in 2015/16 alone.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://stv.tv/news/politics/1376731-snp-questions-budget-of-zombie-department-scotland-office/|title=SNP questions budget of 'zombie department' Scotland Office|website=STV News|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref>

The UK government's website lists the Secretary of State for Scotland's responsibilities as being:<blockquote>"''The main role of the Scottish Secretary is to promote and protect the devolution settlement.

Other responsibilities include promoting partnership between the UK government and the Scottish government, and relations between the 2 Parliaments.''"<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>
This seeming lack of responsibility has in recent years seen calls from opposition MPs for the scrapping of the role and the Scotland Office.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7111200.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} UK {{!}} Scotland {{!}} Scrap Scotland Office, SNP urging|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> Robert Hazell has suggested merging the offices of [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], Scotland and [[Secretary of State for Wales|Wales]] into one Secretary of State for the Union,<ref>{{Cite news|last=LETTERS@THETIMES.CO.UK|first=WRITE TO|title=Times letters: Mark Sedwill’s call for a cull of the cabinet|language=en|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/times-letters-mark-sedwills-call-for-a-cull-of-the-cabinet-6x2kgqdhc|access-date=2020-11-30|issn=0140-0460}}</ref> in a department into which [[Rodney Brazier]] has suggested adding a Minister of State for England with responsibility for [[Local government in England|English local government]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=UKCLA|date=2020-09-07|title=Rodney Brazier: Why is Her Majesty’s Government so big?|url=https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2020/09/07/rodney-brazier-why-is-her-majestys-government-so-big/|access-date=2020-11-30|website=UK Constitutional Law Association|language=en}}</ref>
