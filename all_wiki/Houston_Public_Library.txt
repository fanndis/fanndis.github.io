'''Houston Public Library''' is the [[public library]] system serving [[Houston]], [[Texas]], [[United States]].

==History==
===Houston Lyceum and the Carnegie Library===
[[File:Sanborn1907 McK Travis Hou.png|thumb|1907 Sanborn map showing the location of the Carnegie Library and Houston Lyceum.]]
[[File:HPLIdesonBuilding0.JPG|thumb|[[Julia Ideson Building]] in Downtown]]
The Houston Public Library system traces its founding to the creation of the second Houston [[Lyceum]] in 1854.<ref name="chapmanvii">{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=Betty T.|title=100 Years-100 Stories: Houston Public Library 1904–2004|location=Houston|year=2004|publisher=Houston Public Library|page=vii}} {{ISBN|0-9753242-0-9}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/lch02|title=Houston Public Library|last=Kleiner|first=Diana J.|date=2010-06-15|website=Texas State Historical Association|access-date=2017-03-04}}</ref>  The lyceum was preceded by a [[Debate|debating society]], a special-interest mechanics' lyceum, and a [[circulating library]]. The lyceum's library eventually split into a separate institution at the end of the 19th century.<ref name=":0" />

In 1892, [[William Marsh Rice]], a Houston businessman and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] who later chartered [[Rice University]], donated $200,000 for the construction of a free public library.<ref name=":0" /> The facility opened in 1895 and obtained its own building in 1904 with financial assistance from [[Andrew Carnegie]].<ref>Chapman, Betty T. "[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-27941445_ITM Story of public libraries took long time to write in Houston]." ''[[Houston Business Journal]]''. June 2, 2000. Retrieved on January 27, 2009.</ref> Betty Trapp Chapman wrote in ''[[The Houston Review]]'' that the city's women "were instrumental" in the library's establishment and that the educated women "had long recognized the need for a library to serve the community."<ref>{{cite web|author=Chapman, Betty Trapp|url=https://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/walking-in-the-footsteps-of-houst-women-historic-tour-of-down.pdf|title=Walking in the Footsteps of Houston Women: A Historic Tour of Downtown Houston|work=[[The Houston Review]]|volume=1|issue=1|pages=59–62}} - Cited: p. 59 (PDF p. 1/4)</ref> [[Julia Ideson]] was named its first [[librarian]] and she hired one employee. Located at the corner of Travis and McKinney in what is now known as Downtown Houston, it originally housed 10,000 volumes. By 1907, 10,000 Houstonians held accounts at the library. By 1913, the library counted seven persons on its payroll.<ref>Chapman (2004), pp. 6{{endash}}9.</ref> The city changed the name from Carnegie Library to Houston Public Library in 1921. By this time, they had outgrown their space and relocated several staff members to the Harris County Courthouse. A few years later, the library sold its property to raise money for a larger facility.<ref>Chapman (2004), pp. 14{{endash}}15.</ref>

===Julia Ideson Library===
The library board selected a lot once occupied by [[Thomas M. Bagby]], a co-founder of the 1848 Houston Lyceum. They commissioned Cram and Ferguson as design architects, in consultation with [[William Ward Watkin]] and Louis A. Glover. The building was completed in two years and at a cost of $500,000. The Spanish Renaissance design draws from regional history, and includes carvings of explorers and missionaries of Texas. The second floor hall lay under a rotunda, fronted by an interior oaken gate with carved columns and entablatures. The new building opened with a collection of more than thirty thousand volumes.<ref>Chapman (2004), pp. 21{{endash}}25.</ref> The building constructed as Houston's Central Library in 1926 was later named the [[Julia Ideson Building]] in her honor.<ref name=":0" />

===Carnegie Colored Library===
The board for the Houston Carnegie Library had planned for universal access to the facilities. However, those working at the library turned away African-Americans educators who visited in 1907, while ostensibly referring the matter to the trustees. A group of African-American educators led by [[Ernest O. Smith]] lobbied local white leaders and the Carnegie Foundation for a library to serve the black community. The [[Colored Carnegie Library of Houston]] opened in 1913 with an African American board of trustees and management. It was transferred to the management as a branch library of Houston Public Library in 1921.<ref name="malone">{{cite journal|journal=Libraries & Culture|volume=34|issue=2|year=1999|pages=95–112|title=Autonomy and Accommodation: Houston's Colored Carnegie Library, 1907–1922|jstor=25548712|last1=Malone|first1=Cheryl Knott}}</ref>

===Partnership libraries===
In addition, HPL has a partnership with the [[Harris County Public Library]]'s Clear Lake City-County Freeman Branch Library in the [[Clear Lake City, Houston, Texas|Clear Lake City]] community of Houston.

Also, the Parent Resource Library in the [[Children's Museum of Houston]] is considered part of the Houston Public Library system; however, its staff are employed by the museum, rather than the City of Houston.

In partnership with the Harris County Public Library, which will operate the branch, the Kingwood Branch in [[Kingwood, Houston, Texas|Kingwood]] is a "City-County" branch in exchange for $4.2 million to fund the building of a new {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility. At the time of its completion, the existing branch will be converted into a [[community center]].<ref>{{cite news
