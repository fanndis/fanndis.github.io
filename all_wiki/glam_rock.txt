'''Glam rock''' is a style of [[rock music]] that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s performed by musicians who wore outrageous costumes, [[makeup]], and hairstyles, particularly [[platform shoes]] and [[glitter]].<ref name=Encarta>{{cite encyclopedia|work=[[Encarta]] |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561509274/glam_rock.html |title=Glam Rock |accessdate=21 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828224412/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561509274/glam_rock.html |archivedate=28 August 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Glam artists drew on diverse sources across music and [[throwaway culture|throwaway pop culture]],<ref name=lester>{{cite news|last1=Lester|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul Lester|title=Franz and Sparks: this town is big enough for both of us|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/11/franz-and-sparks-this-town-is-big-enough-for-both-of-us|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 June 2015}}</ref> ranging from [[bubblegum pop]] and 1950s [[rock and roll]] to [[cabaret]], [[science fiction]], and complex [[art rock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/glam-rock-ma0000002619 |title=Glam Rock &#124; Significant Albums, Artists and Songs |website=AllMusic |accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref><ref name="P.

==Characteristics==
[[File:David-Bowie Early.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Bowie]] as his alter-ego [[Ziggy Stardust (character)|Ziggy Stardust]] during the 1972–73 [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]] ]]
Glam rock can be seen as a fashion as well as musical subgenre.<ref name="Shuker2005pp124-5"/> Glam artists rejected the [[revolutionary]] rhetoric of the late 1960s rock scene, instead glorifying [[decadence]], superficiality, and the simple structures of earlier pop music.<ref name="fe"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Glam Rock|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/glam-rock|website=[[Britannica]]|accessdate=12 November 2016}}</ref> In response to these characteristics, scholars such as I.Taylor and D. Wall characterized Glam rock as "offensive, commercial, and cultural emasculation".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gregory|first=Georgina|date=2002|title=Masculinity, Sexuality, and the Visual Culture of Glam Rock|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/11875/1/11875_gregory.pdf|journal=Culture and Communication - University of Central Lancashire|volume=5|pages=37}}</ref>

Artists drew on such musical influences as [[bubblegum pop]], the brash [[guitar riff]]s of [[hard rock]], stomping rhythms, and 1950s [[rock and roll]], filtering them through the [[recording technology|recording innovations]] of the late 1960s.<ref name="fe">{{cite web|last1=Reynolds|first1=Simon|title=Simon Reynolds Speaks at Fordham on History of Glam Rock|url=http://fordhamenglish.com/news1/2016/10/25/simon-reynolds-speaks-on-glam-rock|website=Fordham English|accessdate=12 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music|date=2001|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|page=3}}</ref><ref name="nyt">{{cite web|last1=Farber|first1=Jim|title=Growing Up Gay to a Glam Rock Soundtrack|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/fashion/mens-style/growing-up-gay-glam-rock-queen-bowie-freddie-mercury.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=11 November 2016}}</ref> Ultimately it became very diverse, varying between the simple rock and roll revivalism of figures like [[Alvin Stardust]] to the complex [[art pop]] of [[Roxy Music]].<ref name="Shuker2005pp124-5" /> In its beginning, however, it was a youth-oriented reaction to the creeping dominance of [[progressive rock]] and [[concept album]]s – what ''[[Bomp!]]'' called the "overall denim dullness" of "a deadly boring, prematurely matured music scene".<ref name="Barnes">{{Cite magazine |last=Barnes |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Barnes (writer) |date=March 1978 |title=The Glitter Era: Teenage Rampage |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/the-glitter-era-teenage-rampage |magazine=[[Bomp!]] |access-date=26 January 2019 |via=[[Rock's Backpages]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

Visually it was a mesh of various styles, ranging from 1930s [[Hollywood]] glamour, through 1950s pin-up sex appeal, pre-war [[cabaret]] theatrics, [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] literary and [[symbolist]] styles, [[science fiction]], to ancient and occult [[mysticism]] and [[mythology]]; manifesting itself in outrageous clothes, makeup, hairstyles, and platform-soled boots.<ref name="P. Auslander, 2006 pp. 57, 63"/> Glam is most noted for its sexual and gender ambiguity and representations of [[androgyny]], beside extensive use of theatrics.<ref name=AllmusicGR>[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d388|pure_url=yes}} "Glam rock"], AllMusic. Retrieved 26 June 2009.</ref>

It was prefigured by the flamboyant English composer [[Noël Coward]], especially his 1931 song "[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]", with music writer Daryl Easlea stating, "Noël Coward's influence on people like Bowie, Roxy Music and Cockney Rebel was absolutely immense. It suggested style, artifice and surface were equally as important as depth and substance. ''Time'' magazine noted Coward's 'sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise'. It reads like a glam manifesto."<ref name="Independent"/> Showmanship and [[gender bender|gender identity manipulation]] acts included [[the Cockettes]] and [[Alice Cooper]], the latter of which combined glam with [[shock rock]].<ref>P.

A heavier variant of glam rock, emphasising guitar riff centric songs, driving rhythms and live performance with audience participation, were represented by bands like [[Slade]] and [[Mott the Hoople]], with later followers such as [[Def Leppard]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Bon Jovi]], and [[Quiet Riot]], some of which either covered Slade compositions or composed new songs based on Slade templates. While highly successful in the single charts in the UK, very few of these musicians were able to make a serious impact in the US; David Bowie was the major exception, becoming an international superstar and prompting the adoption of glam styles among acts like [[Lou Reed]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[New York Dolls]] and [[Jobriath]], often known as "glitter rock" and with a darker lyrical content than their British counterparts.<ref name=Auslander2006p80>P.

In the UK, the term glitter rock was most often used to refer to the extreme version of glam pursued by [[Gary Glitter]] and the independent band with whom he often performed known as the [[Glitter Band]].

[[New Romantic]] acts in the UK such as [[Adam and the Ants]] and [[Flock of Seagulls]] extended glam, and its androgyny and sexual politics were picked up by acts including [[Culture Club]], [[Bronski Beat]] and [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]].<ref name=Auslander2006p79>P.
