The [[Sandia Mountains]] run along the eastern side of Albuquerque, and the [[Rio Grande]] flows north to south through its center, while the [[West Mesa]] and [[Petroglyph National Monument]] make up the western part of the city.

The civic apex is found in an undeveloped area within the Albuquerque Open Space; there, the terrain rises to an elevation of approximately 6880+&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(2,097&nbsp;m)</span>.

The economy of Albuquerque centers on science, medicine, technology, commerce, education, entertainment, and culture outlets. The city is home to [[Kirtland Air Force Base]], [[Sandia National Laboratories]], [[Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute]], [[Presbyterian Health Services]], and both the [[University of New Mexico]] and [[Central New Mexico Community College]] have their main campuses in the city. Albuquerque is the center of the New Mexico Technology Corridor, a concentration of high-tech institutions, including the metropolitan area being the location of [[Intel]]'s [[List of Intel manufacturing sites|Fab 11X]] In [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]] and a [[Facebook]] Data Center in [[Los Lunas, New Mexico|Los Lunas]], Albuquerque was also the founding location of [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]] and [[Microsoft]]. Film studios have a major presence in the state of New Mexico, for example [[Netflix]] has a main production hub at Albuquerque Studios. There are numerous shopping centers and malls within the city, including [[ABQ Uptown]], [[Coronado Mall|Coronado]], [[Cottonwood Mall (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Cottonwood]], [[Nob Hill, Albuquerque, New Mexico|Nob Hill]], and [[Winrock Mall|Winrock]]. The city is the location of a [[horse racing]] track and [[casino]] called The Downs Casino and Racetrack, and the [[Pueblo]]s surrounding the city feature [[resort]] casinos, including [[Sandia Resort and Casino|Sandia Resort]], [[Santa Ana Star Casino|Santa Ana Star]], [[Isleta Pueblo|Isleta]] Resort, and [[Laguna Pueblo]]'s Route 66 Resort.

The city hosts the [[Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta|International Balloon Fiesta]], the world's largest gathering of hot-air balloons, taking place every October at a venue referred to as Balloon Fiesta Park, with its 47-acre launch field.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/20/travel/escapes/20Ahead.html|title=Up, Up and Gently Away|last=Dixon|first=Chris|access-date=15 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915084723/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/20/travel/escapes/20Ahead.html|archive-date=September 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Another large venue is Expo New Mexico where other annual events are held, such as North America's largest [[pow wow]] at the [[Gathering of Nations]], as well as the [[New Mexico State Fair]]. While other major venues throughout the metropolitan area include the [[National Hispanic Cultural Center]], the University of New Mexico's Popejoy Hall, [[Santa Ana Star Center]], and [[Isleta Amphitheater]]. [[Old Town Albuquerque]]'s Plaza, Hotel, and [[San Felipe de Neri Church]] hosts traditional fiestas and events such as weddings, also near Old Town are the [[New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science]], [[Albuquerque Museum of Art and History]], [[Indian Pueblo Cultural Center]], [[Explora (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Explora]], and [[Albuquerque Biological Park]]. Located in [[Downtown Albuquerque]] are historic theaters such as the [[KiMo Theater]], and near the [[Albuquerque Plaza|Civic Plaza]] is the [[Al Hurricane]] Pavilion and [[Albuquerque Convention Center]] with its Kiva Auditorium. Due to its population size, the metropolitan area regularly receives most national and international music concerts, [[Broadway show]]s, and other large traveling events, as well as [[New Mexico music]], and [[Music of New Mexico|other local music performances]].

Likewise, due to the metropolitan size, it is home to a diverse restaurant scene from various [[global cuisine]]s, and the state's distinct [[New Mexican cuisine]]. Being the focus of the [[Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District]] gives an agricultural contrast, along [[acequia]]s, to the otherwise heavily urban setting of the city. Crops such as [[New Mexico chile]] are grown along the entire Rio Grande, the red or green chile pepper is a staple of the aforementioned New Mexican cuisine. The Albuquerque metro is a major contributor of the [[Middle Rio Grande Valley AVA]] with [[New Mexico wine]] produced at several vineyards, it is also home to several [[List of breweries in New Mexico|New Mexican breweries]]. The river also provides trade access with the [[Mesilla Valley]] (containing [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]] and [[El Paso, Texas]]) region to the south, with its [[Mesilla Valley AVA]] and the adjacent [[Hatch, New Mexico|Hatch Valley]] which is well known for its New Mexico chile peppers.

[[Petroglyphs]] carved into basalt in the western part of the city bear testimony to an early Native American presence in the area, now preserved in the [[Petroglyph National Monument]].

The [[Tanoan languages|Tanoan]] and [[Keres languages|Keresan]] peoples had lived along the Rio Grande for centuries before European settlers arrived in what is now Albuquerque. By the 1500s, there were around 20 [[Tiwa people|Tiwa]] [[Puebloans|pueblos]] along a {{convert|60|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of river from present-day [[Algodones, New Mexico|Algodones]] to the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande tributary)|Rio Puerco]] confluence south of [[Belen, New Mexico|Belen]].

After 1821, Mexico also had a military presence there. The town of Alburquerque was built in the traditional Spanish villa pattern: a central [[plaza]] surrounded by government buildings, homes, and a church. This central plaza area has been preserved and is open to the public as a cultural area and center of commerce. It is referred to as "[[Old Town Albuquerque]]" or simply "Old Town". Historically it was sometimes referred to as "La Placita" (''Little Plaza'' in Spanish). On the north side of Old Town Plaza is [[San Felipe de Neri Church]]. Built in 1793, it is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the city.<ref>{{cite web

After the New Mexico Territory became a part of the United States, Albuquerque had a federal garrison and quartermaster depot, the Post of Albuquerque, from 1846 to 1867. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Albuquerque was occupied in February 1862 by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] troops under General [[Henry Hopkins Sibley]], who soon afterward advanced with his main body into northern New Mexico. During his retreat from [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops into [[Texas]] he made a stand on April 8, 1862, at Albuquerque and fought the [[Battle of Albuquerque]] against a detachment of Union soldiers commanded by Colonel [[Edward Canby|Edward R. S. Canby]]. This daylong engagement at long range led to few casualties.

When the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad]] arrived in 1880, it bypassed the Plaza, locating the passenger depot and railyards about <span style="white-space:nowrap">2&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(3&nbsp;km)</span> east in what quickly became known as New Albuquerque or New Town.

By 1900, Albuquerque boasted a population of 8,000 inhabitants and all the modern amenities, including an electric street railway connecting Old Town, New Town, and the recently established University of New Mexico campus on the East Mesa. In 1902, the famous [[Alvarado Hotel]] was built adjacent to the new passenger depot, and it remained a symbol of the city until it was razed in 1970 to make room for a parking lot. In 2002, the [[Alvarado Transportation Center]] was built on the site in a manner resembling the old landmark. The large metro station functions as the downtown headquarters for the city's transit department. It also serves as an intermodal hub for local buses, [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] buses, [[Amtrak]] passenger trains, and the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|Rail Runner]] commuter rail line.

New Mexico's dry climate brought many [[tuberculosis]] patients to the city in search of a cure during the early 20th century, and several sanitaria sprang up on the [[West Mesa]] to serve them. Presbyterian Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital, two of the largest hospitals in the Southwest, had their beginnings during this period. Influential [[New Deal]]–era governor [[Clyde Tingley]] and famed Southwestern architect [[John Gaw Meem]] were among those brought to New Mexico by tuberculosis.

The first travelers on [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] appeared in Albuquerque in 1926, and before long, dozens of motels, restaurants, and gift shops had sprung up along the roadside to serve them. Route 66 originally ran through the city on a north–south alignment along Fourth Street, but in 1937 it was realigned along [[Central Avenue (Albuquerque)|Central Avenue]], a more direct east–west route. The intersection of Fourth and Central downtown was the principal crossroads of the city for decades. The majority of the surviving structures from the Route 66 era are on Central, though there are also some on Fourth. Signs between Bernalillo and Los Lunas along the old route now have brown, historical highway markers denoting it as ''Pre-1937 Route 66.''

The establishment of [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] in 1939, [[Sandia Base]] in the early 1940s, and [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in 1949, would make Albuquerque a key player of the Atomic Age. Meanwhile, the city continued to expand outward into the Northeast Heights, reaching a population of 201,189 by 1960. In 1990, it was 384,736 and in 2007 it was 518,271.

Albuquerque's downtown entered the same phase and development (decline, "[[urban renewal]]" with continued decline, and [[gentrification]]) as nearly every city across the United States. As Albuquerque spread outward, the downtown area fell into a decline. Many historic buildings were razed in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for new plazas, high-rises, and parking lots as part of the city's urban renewal phase. {{as of|2010}}, only recently has Downtown Albuquerque come to regain much of its urban character, mainly through the construction of many new loft apartment buildings and the renovation of historic structures such as the [[KiMo Theater]], in the gentrification phase.

During the 21st century, the Albuquerque population has continued to grow rapidly. The population of the city proper was estimated at 528,497 in 2009, up from 448,607 in the 2000 census.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Erick |last=Siermers |title=Managing Albuquerque's growth |url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/sep/17/albuquerque-metro-area-population-projected-reach-/ |date=September 17, 2007 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222005227/http://abqtrib.com/news/2007/sep/17/albuquerque-metro-area-population-projected-reach-/ |archivedate=February 22, 2010  }}</ref> During 2005 and 2006, the city celebrated its tricentennial with a diverse program of cultural events.

Urban sprawl is limited on three sides—by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] to the north, the [[Pueblo of Isleta|Isleta Pueblo]] and Kirtland Air Force Base to the south, and the Sandia Mountains to the east. Suburban growth continues at a strong pace to the west, beyond the Petroglyph National Monument, once thought to be a natural boundary to sprawl development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/petr/ |title=Petroglyph National Monument |publisher=Nps.gov |date=June 10, 2010 |accessdate=July 2, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100828110802/http://www.nps.gov/petr/| archivedate=August 28, 2010| url-status= live}}</ref>

Because of less-costly land and lower taxes, much of the growth in the metropolitan area is taking place outside of the city of Albuquerque itself. In Rio Rancho to the northwest, the communities east of the mountains, and the incorporated parts of [[Valencia County]], population growth rates approach twice that of Albuquerque. The primary cities in Valencia County are [[Los Lunas, New Mexico|Los Lunas]] and [[Belen, New Mexico|Belen]], both of which are home to growing industrial complexes and new residential subdivisions. The mountain towns of [[Tijeras, New Mexico|Tijeras]], [[Edgewood, New Mexico|Edgewood]], and [[Moriarty, New Mexico|Moriarty]], while close enough to Albuquerque to be considered suburbs, have experienced much less growth compared to Rio Rancho, Bernalillo, Los Lunas, and Belen. Limited water supply and rugged terrain are the main limiting factors for development in these towns. The [[Mid Region Council of Governments]] (MRCOG), which includes constituents from throughout the Albuquerque area, was formed to ensure that these governments along the middle Rio Grande would be able to meet the needs of their rapidly rising populations. MRCOG's cornerstone project is currently the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]]. In October 2013, the ''Albuquerque Journal'' reported Albuquerque as the third best city to own an investment property.<ref>Metcalf, Richard.

===Landforms and drainage===
Albuquerque has one of the highest elevations of any major city in the United States, though the effects of this are greatly tempered by its southwesterly continental position. The elevation of the city ranges from <span style="white-space:nowrap">4,900&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(1,490&nbsp;m)</span> [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] near the Rio Grande (in the Valley) to over <span style="white-space:nowrap">6,700&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(1,950&nbsp;m)</span> in the foothill areas of [[Sandia Heights, New Mexico|Sandia Heights]] and Glenwood Hills. At the airport, the elevation is <span style="white-space:nowrap">5,352&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(1,631&nbsp;m)</span> above sea level.

The Rio Grande is classified, like the [[Nile]], as an "exotic" river. The New Mexico portion of the Rio Grande lies within the [[Rio Grande Rift]] Valley, bordered by a system of [[fault (geology)|fault]]s, including those that lifted up the adjacent [[Sandia Mountains|Sandia]] and [[Manzano Mountains]], while lowering the area where the life-sustaining Rio Grande now flows.

===Geology===
Albuquerque lies in the [[Albuquerque Basin]], a portion of the [[Rio Grande rift]].<ref>{{cite web

The [[Sandia Mountains]] are the predominant geographic feature visible in Albuquerque. ''Sandía'' is Spanish for "[[watermelon]]", and is popularly believed to be a reference to the brilliant coloration of the mountains at sunset: bright pink (melon meat) and green (melon rind). The pink is due to large exposures of [[granodiorite]] cliffs, and the green is due to large swaths of [[conifer]] forests. However, Robert Julyan notes in ''The Place Names of New Mexico'', "the most likely explanation is the one believed by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] Indians: the Spaniards, when they encountered the Pueblo in 1540, called it Sandia, because they thought the squash growing there were watermelons, and the name Sandia soon was transferred to the mountains east of the pueblo."<ref name="julyan">Robert Julyan, ''The Place Names of New Mexico'' (revised edition), UNM Press, 1998.</ref> He also notes that the Sandia Pueblo Indians call the mountain ''Bien Mur'', "big mountain."<ref name="julyan"/>

The Sandia foothills, on the west side of the mountains, have soils derived from that same rock material with varying sizes of decomposed granite, mixed with areas of clay and [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]] (a [[calcium carbonate]] deposit common in the arid southwestern USA), along with some exposed [[granite]] bedrock.

Below the foothills, the area usually called the "Northeast Heights" consists of a mix of clay and [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]] soils, overlaying a layer of decomposed granite, resulting from long-term outwash of that material from the adjacent mountains. This [[bajada (geography)|bajada]] is quite noticeable when driving into Albuquerque from the north or south, due to its fairly uniform slope from the mountains' edge downhill to the valley. Sand hills are scattered along the I-25 corridor and directly above the Rio Grande Valley, forming the lower end of the Heights.

The Rio Grande Valley, due to long-term shifting of the actual river channel, contains layers and areas of soils varying between [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]], clay, loam, and even some sand. It is the only part of Albuquerque where the [[water table]] often lies close to the surface, sometimes less than {{convert|10|ft|m}}.

The last significant area of Albuquerque geologically is the [[West Mesa]]: this is the elevated land west of the Rio Grande, including "West Bluff", the sandy terrace immediately west and above the river, and the rather sharply defined volcanic escarpment above and west of most of the developed city. The west mesa commonly has soils often referred to as "blow sand", along with occasional clay and caliche and even basalt, nearing the escarpment.

===Potential and former native flora===
Flora or vegetation surrounding the built portions of the city are typical of their desert southwestern and interior west setting, within the varied elevations and terrain. The limits are by significant urbanization, including much infill development occurring in the last quarter of the twentieth century.

Sandy soils include scrub and mesa vegetation such as sand sagebrush (''Artemisia filifolia''), fourwing saltbush (''Atriplex canescens''). Some similar grass and seasonal wildflower species occur that also occur in areas east of the Rio Grande, but in much lower densities. Sparsely as well, sandy soil grasses occur such as Indian ricegrass (''Oryzopsis hymenoides''), sand dropseed (''Sporobolus cryptandrus''), and mesa dropseed (''Sporobolus flexuosus''). Arroyos contain desert willow (''Chilopsis linearis'') while breaks and the prominent volcanic escarpment include threeleaf sumac with less frequent stands of oneseed juniper (''Juniperus monosperma''), netleaf hackberry (''Celtis reticulata''), mariola (''Parthenium incanum''), and beebrush or oreganillo (''Aloysia wrightii''). Isolated littleleaf sumac (''Rhus microphylla'') occurs on the hillsides above Taylor Ranch and at the Petroglyph National Monument Visitor's Center.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bonap.net/NAPA/Genus/Traditional/County|title=2014 BONAP North American Plant Atlas|website=bonap.net|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200111013950/http://bonap.net/NAPA/Genus/Traditional/County|archive-date=January 11, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Other areas of Albuquerque have more fine clay and caliche soils, plus more rainfall and slightly cooler temperatures, so natural vegetation is dominated by grassland species such as fluffgrass (''Erioneuron pulchellum''), purple threeawn (''Hilaria mutica'' or ''Pleuraphis mutica''), bush muhly (''Muhlenbergia porteri''), and black grama (''Bouteloua eriopoda''). Some woody plants occur in overall grassy areas, mainly fourwing saltbush (''Atriplex canescens'') and snakeweed (''Gutierrezia microcephala''). Isolated stands of creosote bush (''Larrea tridentata'') were reported by long-time residents on gravelly, desert pavement soils existing above arroyos and warm breaks, prior to urbanization in the Northeast Quadrant of Albuquerque.{{cn|date=August 2020}} Today only remnants of creosote bush scrub remain in similar soils in foothill areas of Kirtland Air Force Base according to "Biologic Surveys for the Sandia National Laboratories Coyote Canyon Test Complex – Kirtland Air Force Base Albuquerque, New Mexico (Marron and Associates, Inc., May 1994)",<ref>{{Cite document|title=Biologic surveys for the Sandia National Laboratories, Coyote Canyon Test Complex, Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico|first1=R.

In the lower foothills of the Sandia Mountains loose or granitic soils help provide habitat for other species, such as feather dalea (''Dalea formosa''), mariola (''Parthenium incanum''), and beebrush or oreganillo (''Aloysia wrightii'').<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npsnm.org/pdfs/Sandia_cl_Sivinski.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902003239/https://www.npsnm.org/pdfs/Sandia_cl_Sivinski.pdf |archive-date=September 2, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Soaptree (''Yucca elata'') and broom dalea (''Psorothamnus scoparius'') are currently found or were once existing on sand hills and breaks on both sides of the Rio Grande Valley, roughly below the present-day locations of the Petroglyph Escarpment west of Coors Road and along Interstate 25 south of Sunport Boulevard.

The Rio Grande Valley proper bisects Albuquerque, and it has been urbanized the longest of all areas of the city. Some botanists and longtime residents{{cn|date=August 2020}} recall riparian vegetation, including screwbean mesquite or tornillo (''Prosopis pubescens''), Gooding's willow (''Salix goodingii''), and saint sacaton (''Sporobulus wrightii''). The present bosque or gallery forest of Rio Grande cottonwood (''Populus deltoides var. wislizeni'') and coyote willow (''Salix exigua'') is theorized to have been more savannah-like, prior to replanting in the 1930s. Grass and low cactus cover of many areas is typical of a broader region of the intermontane west riparian zones, such as saltgrass (''Distychilis spp.'') and alkali sacaton (''Sporobulus airoides''). Discontinuous, small stands of New Mexico olive (''Forestiera pubescens var. neomexicana''), Arizona walnut (''Juglans major''), and Arizona ash (''Fraxinus velutina'') can be seen near bosque areas and near former river bends in central New Mexico just north and south of the Albuquerque city limits in the Corrales bosque and along former channels of the Rio Grande in Valencia and Socorro counties. The forest now has a large proportion of non-native species including [[Ulmus pumila|Siberian elm]], [[Elaeagnus angustifolia|Russian olive]], [[Tamarix|saltcedar]], [[Morus (plant)|mulberries]], [[Ailanthus altissima|Ailanthus]], and [[Saccharum ravennae|ravenna grass]]. Some restoration to native species is occurring, similar to the limited species of ''Populus'' and ''Salix'' used in the 1930s.

One prominent species of native Mountainous trees is the [[pinyon pine|piñon pine]]. At the east end of the city, the Sandia foothills receive about 50 percent more precipitation than most of the city, and with granitic, coarse soils, rock outcrops, and boulders dominant, they have a greater and different diversity of flora in the form of savanna and chaparral, dominated by lower and middle zones of New Mexico Mountains vegetation, with a slight orientation at lower elevations. Dominant plants include shrub or desert live oak (''Quercus turbinella''), gray oak (''Quercus grisea''), hairy mountain mahogany (''Cercocarpus breviflorus''), oneseed juniper (''Juniperus monosperma''), piñon (''Pinus edulis''), threeleaf sumac (''Rhus trilobata''), Engelmann prickly pear (''Opuntia engelmannii''), juniper prickly pear (''Opuntia hystricina var. juniperiana''), and beargrass (''Nolina greenei'', formerly considered ''Nolina texana''). Similar grasses occur that are native to the eastern half of the city, but often of a higher density owing to increased precipitation. The foothills of Albuquerque are much less urbanized, the vegetation altered or removed than anywhere else in the city, though the lower areas have been mostly developed in a more dense suburban pattern in mostly developed communities including North Albuquerque Acres, Tanoan, High Desert, Glenwood Hills, Embudo Hills, Supper Rock, and Four Hills.

===Native and other fauna===
An iconic bird often seen in Albuquerque is the [[greater roadrunner]]. Other birds include the common raven, American crow, great-tailed grackle, Gambel's and scaled quail, several species of hummingbirds, house finch, pigeon, mourning dove, [[White-winged dove|white wing]] and [[Eurasian collared dove|European collared doves]] (both recent appearances), curve-billed thrasher, pinyon jay, and Cooper's, Swainson's, and red-tail hawks. The valley hosts [[sandhill crane]]s each winter.

Within city limits, the [[southwestern fence lizard]] and [[Aspidoscelis|whiptails]] are common. Snakes include the [[Common garter snake|New Mexico garter snake]] and the [[bullsnake]] in the [[Bosque|Rio Grande Bosque]], and at the edges of the city, the venomous [[Western diamondback rattlesnake]]. [[Woodhouse's toad|Woodhouse toads]] and non-native [[American bullfrog|bullfrogs]] are common around the Rio Grande. Retention ponds within the city often serve as breeding pools for [[New Mexico spadefoot toad]]s and [[Notostraca|tadpole shrimp]] ("Triops").

Commonly seen mammals include the [[coyote]], [[rock squirrel]], [[Gunnison's prairie dog]], [[desert cottontail]], and [[black-tailed jackrabbit]]. Striped skunks, raccoons, and several mouse species can be found in the city, and mule deer and [[Pack rat|woodrats]] occur in the foothills. The broader area is home to bobcat, black bear, and mountain lion, and is at the north end of the range of the [[ring-tailed cat|ringtail]] and [[Collared peccary|javelina]].

Larger arthropods include the [[Neotibicen dealbatus|plains cicada]], [[Mastigoproctus giganteus|vinegaroon]], [[Scolopendra polymorpha|desert centipede]], [[Hyles lineata|white-lined sphynx]] (hummingbird moth), [[Papilio multicaudata|two-tailed swallowtail]], [[Figeater beetle|fig beetle]], [[Stagmomantis limbata|New Mexico mantis]], and [[Pogonomyrmex|harvester ant]].

===Cityscape===
{{wide image|Albuquerque_pano_sunset.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of the city of Albuquerque}}

====Quadrants====
Albuquerque is geographically divided into four [[Address (geography)#Quadrants|quadrants]] that are officially part of mailing addresses. They are NE (northeast), NW (northwest), SE (southeast), and SW (southwest). The north-south dividing line is Central Avenue (the path that [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] took through the city), and the east-west dividing line is the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|Rail Runner]] tracks.

=====Northeast=====

This quadrant has been experiencing a housing expansion since the late 1950s. It abuts the base of the Sandia Mountains and contains portions of the foothills neighborhoods, which are significantly higher, in elevation and price range, than the rest of the city. Running from Central Avenue and the railroad tracks to the [[Sandia Peak Tramway|Sandia Peak Aerial Tram]], this is the largest quadrant both geographically and by population. Martineztown, the University of New Mexico, the [[Maxwell Museum of Anthropology]], Nob Hill, the Uptown area which includes three shopping malls ([[Coronado Center]], ABQ Uptown, and Winrock Town Center), Hoffmantown, Journal Center, [[Cliff's Amusement Park]], and Balloon Fiesta Park are all in this quadrant.

Some of the most affluent neighborhoods in the city are here, including: [[High Desert, Albuquerque, New Mexico|High Desert]], Tanoan, Sandia Heights, and North Albuquerque Acres. Parts of Sandia Heights and North Albuquerque Acres are outside the city limits proper. A few houses in the farthest reach of this quadrant lie in the [[Cibola National Forest]], just over the line into [[Sandoval County, New Mexico|Sandoval County]].

=====Northwest=====
[[File:KiMo Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|KiMo Theatre in Downtown]]

This quadrant contains historic [[Old Town Albuquerque]], which dates to the 18th century, as well as the [[Indian Pueblo Cultural Center]]. The area has a mixture of commercial districts and low to high-income neighborhoods. Northwest Albuquerque includes the largest section of [[Downtown Albuquerque|Downtown]], [[Rio Grande Nature Center State Park]] and the [[Bosque]] ("woodlands"), Petroglyph National Monument, [[Double Eagle II Airport]], the Paradise Hills neighborhood, Taylor Ranch, and [[Cottonwood Mall (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Cottonwood Mall]].

This quadrant also contains the [[North Valley, New Mexico|North Valley]] settlement, outside the city limits, which has some expensive homes and small ranches along the [[Rio Grande]]. The city of Albuquerque engulfs the village of [[Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, New Mexico|Los Ranchos de Albuquerque]]. A small portion of the rapidly developing area on the west side of the river south of the Petroglyphs, known as the "[[West Mesa]]" or "Westside", consisting primarily of traditional residential subdivisions, also extends into this quadrant. The city proper is bordered on the north by the North Valley, the village of [[Corrales, New Mexico|Corrales]], and the city of [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]].

=====Southeast=====
[[File:Lobo Theater, Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|Lobo Theater in Nob Hill]]

Kirtland Air Force Base, Sandia National Laboratories, Sandia Science & Technology Park, [[Albuquerque International Sunport]], [[Eclipse Aerospace]], [[American Society of Radiologic Technologists]], Central New Mexico Community College, Albuquerque Veloport, [[University Stadium, Albuquerque|University Stadium]], [[Rio Grande Credit Union Field at Isotopes Park]], [[The Pit (arena)|The Pit]], [[Mesa del Sol]], [[The Pavilion (amphitheatre)|The Pavilion]], Albuquerque Studios, Isleta Resort & Casino, the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History, New Mexico Veterans' Memorial, and Talin Market are all in the Southeast quadrant.

The upscale neighborhood of Four Hills is in the foothills of Southeast Albuquerque. Other neighborhoods include [[Nob Hill, Albuquerque|Nob Hill]], Ridgecrest, Willow Wood, and Volterra.

=====Southwest=====
Traditionally consisting of agricultural and rural areas and suburban neighborhoods, the Southwest quadrant comprises the south-end of Downtown Albuquerque, the [[Barelas]] neighborhood, the rapidly growing west side, and the community of [[South Valley, New Mexico]], often called "The South Valley". Although the South Valley is not within Albuquerque's city limits, the quadrant extends through it all the way to the Isleta Indian Reservation. Newer suburban subdivisions on the [[West Mesa]] near the southwestern city limits join homes of older construction, some dating as far back as the 1940s. This quadrant includes the old communities of Atrisco, Los Padillas, Huning Castle, Kinney, Westgate, Westside, Alamosa, Mountainview, and Pajarito. The Bosque ("woodlands"), the [[National Hispanic Cultural Center]], the [[Rio Grande Zoo]], and [[Tingley Beach]] are also here.

A new adopted development plan, the Santolina Master Plan, will extend development on the west side past 118th Street SW to the edge of the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande)|Rio Puerco Valley]] and house 100,000 by 2050. It is unclear whether the Santolina development will be annexed by the City of Albuquerque or incorporated as its own city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernco.gov/planning/proposed-santolina-level-a-master-plan.aspx|title=Adopted Santolina Level A Master Plan-Bernalillo County, New Mexico|work=bernco.gov|access-date=September 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907040938/http://www.bernco.gov/planning/proposed-santolina-level-a-master-plan.aspx|archive-date=September 7, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Albuquerque is located at the crossroads of several ecoregions. According to the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregion-download-files-state-region-6|title=Ecoregion Download Files by State - Region 6|first=ORD|last=US EPA|date=March 9, 2016|website=US EPA|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191215174613/https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregion-download-files-state-region-6|archive-date=December 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the city is located in the southeastern edge of the [[Arizona/New Mexico Plateau]], with the [[Arizona/New Mexico Mountains ecoregion]] defining the adjacent Sandia-Manzano mountains, including the foothills in the eastern edges of the city proper east of Juan Tabo or Tramway boulevards. Though the city lies to the north of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], parts of Albuquerque shares a similar aridity, temperature regime, and natural vegetation to that of the Chihuahuan Desert, namely the upper elevations with desert grassland and sand scrub plant communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_circulars/CR374/#1|title=NMSU: New Mexico Range Plants|website=aces.nmsu.edu|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503163417/https://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_circulars/CR374/#1|archive-date=May 3, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> The eastern areas of the Greater Albuquerque Area, known as the East Mountain Area, lie the [[Southwestern Tablelands]] and are sometimes considered a southern extension of the central high plains and northeast New Mexico highlands. To the north is the [[Southern Rockies]] ecoregion in the Jemez Mountains.

The average annual precipitation is less than half of evaporation providing an arid climate, and no month's daily temperature averages below freezing. Daytime weather is typically rather mild compared to parts of the country further north or further south. However, due to the city's high elevation, daily temperature differences can vary widely and low temperatures in winter typically dip well below freezing. The daily average temperatures in December and January, the coldest months, are slightly above freezing at {{convert|36.3|°F}} and {{convert|36.4|°F}} respectively.

Albuquerque's climate is usually sunny and dry, with an average of 3,415 sunshine hours per year.<ref name="noaasun" /><ref name="NOAA">{{cite web

Winter typically consists of cool days and cold nights, except following passage of the strongest cold fronts and arctic airmasses when daytime temperatures remain colder than average; overnight temperatures tend to fall below freezing between about 10 pm and 8 am in the city, except during colder airmasses, plus colder spots of the valley and most of the East Mountain areas.

Spring is windy, sometimes unsettled with rain, though spring is usually the driest part of the year in Albuquerque. March and April tend to experience many days with the wind blowing at {{convert|20|to|30|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and afternoon gusts can produce periods of blowing sand and dust. In May, the winds tend to subside as a summer-like airmass and temperatures begin to occur with regularity.

Summer is lengthy and very warm to hot, relatively tolerable for most people because of low humidity and air movement. The exception is some days during the [[North American Monsoon]], when daily humidity remains relatively high, especially in July and August. 2.7 days of {{convert|100|°F|0}} or warmer highs occur annually on average, mostly in June and July and rarely in August due in part to the monsoon; an average of 60 days experience {{convert|90|°F|0}} or warmer highs. 28 days with highs at or above {{convert|100|°F|0}} occurred in the summer of 1980 at Albuquerque's Sunport,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/abq/clifeatures_100degrees|title=100° Facts for Albuquerque and New Mexico|first=NOAA|last=US Department of Commerce|website=www.weather.gov|accessdate=April 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215231250/https://www.weather.gov/abq/clifeatures_100degrees|archive-date=February 15, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref> though such temperatures are a rare occurrence. Portions of the valley and West Mesa locations experience more high temperatures above {{convert|90|°F|0}} and {{convert|100|°F|0}} as part of normal or extreme weather each summer.

Fall is generally cool in the mornings and nights but sees less rain than summer, though the weather can be more unsettled closer to winter, as colder airmasses and weather patterns build in from the north and northwest with more frequency.

Precipitation averages about 9.5 inches per year using recent 30-year periods, but during the period of record beginning in 1897, the average is 8.7 inches.<ref name="wrcc.dri.edu"/> On average, January is the driest month, while July and August are the wettest months, as a result of shower and thunderstorm activity produced by the [[North American Monsoon]] prevalent over the Southwestern United States. Most rain occurs during the late summer monsoon season, typically starting in early July and ending in mid-September.

Locations in the Northeast Heights and Eastern Foothills tend to receive more snowfall due to each region's higher elevation and proximity to the mountains.

Such large snowfalls are rare occurrences during the period of record, and they greatly impact traffic movement and the workforce throughout the city due to their rarity.

The mountains and highlands east of the city create a [[rain shadow]] effect, due to the drying of air descending the mountains; the city usually receives very little rain or snow, averaging 8–9&nbsp;inches (216&nbsp;mm) of precipitation per year. Valley and west mesa areas, farther from the mountains are drier, averaging 6–8&nbsp;inches of annual precipitation; the Sandia foothills tend to lift any available moisture, enhancing precipitation to about 10–17&nbsp;inches annually.

Traveling west, north, and east of Albuquerque, one quickly rises in elevation and leaves the sheltering effect of the valley to enter a noticeably cooler and slightly wetter environment. One such area is considered part of Albuquerque Metropolitan Area, commonly called the East Mountain area; it is covered in woodlands of juniper and piñon trees, a common trait of southwestern uplands and the southernmost Rocky Mountains.

===Hydrology===
{{see also|Kirtland Air Force Base#Environmental contamination due to jet fuel spill}}

Albuquerque's [[drinking water]] comes from a combination of Rio Grande water (river water diverted from the [[Colorado River]] basin through the [[San Juan-Chama Project]]<ref>{{cite web| title=Your Drinking Water| url=http://www.abcwua.org/Your_Drinking_Water.aspx| accessdate=August 1, 2013| website=Albuquerque Bernalillo Water Authority| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805163835/http://abcwua.org/Your_Drinking_Water.aspx| archive-date=August 5, 2013| url-status=dead}}</ref>) and a delicate [[aquifer]] that has been described as an "underground [[Lake Superior]]". The Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority (ABCWUA) has developed a water resources management strategy that pursues [[water conservation|conservation]] and the direct extraction of water from the Rio Grande for the development of a stable underground aquifer in the future.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Odenwald |first=Arlene Cinelli |date=April 1993 |title=Protecting the aquifer: Albuquerque reacting |journal=New Mexico Business Journal |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=38–39 |issn=0164-6796 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5092/is_n4_v17/ai_13856429 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109101124/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5092/is_n4_v17/ai_13856429 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-11-09 |accessdate=December 23, 2008}}</ref><ref name="water strategy">{{cite web| title=Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority: Water Resource Management Strategy |website=Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority |date=January 10, 2007 |url=http://www.abcwua.org/pdfs/WRMS_Update_101207.pdf |accessdate=October 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029020514/http://www.abcwua.org/pdfs/WRMS_Update_101207.pdf |archivedate=October 29, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Tingley Beach Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|Tingley Beach in Old Town, Albuquerque, a pond in a former watercourse by the Rio Grande]]

The aquifer of the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande)|Rio Puerco]] is too [[brackish water|saline]] to be cost-effectively used for drinking. Much of the [[rain]]water Albuquerque receives does not recharge its aquifer. It is diverted through a network of paved channels and [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]s and empties into the [[Rio Grande]].

Of the {{convert|62780|acre.ft}} per year of the water in the upper [[Colorado River]] basin entitled to municipalities in New Mexico by the [[Colorado River Compact|Upper Colorado River Basin Compact]], Albuquerque owns 48,200. The water is delivered to the Rio Grande by the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan]]–[[Rio Chama (Rio Grande)|Chama]] Project. The project's construction was initiated by legislation signed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1962, and was completed in 1971. This diversion project transports water under the [[continental divide]] from [[Navajo Lake]] to Lake Heron on the Rio Chama, a tributary of the Rio Grande. In the past much of this water was resold to downstream owners in Texas. These arrangements ended in 2008 with the completion of the ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project.<ref>The project's page at the United States Bureau of Reclamation's website {{cite web |url=http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925123715/http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project |archivedate=September 25, 2012 }}</ref>

The ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project uses a system of adjustable-height dams to skim water from the Rio Grande into [[sluice]]s that lead to [[water treatment]] facilities for direct [[Water purification|conversion to potable water]]. Some water is allowed to flow through central Albuquerque, mostly to protect the endangered [[Rio Grande Silvery Minnow]]. [[Sewage treatment|Treated]] effluent water is recycled into the Rio Grande south of the city. The ABCWUA expects river water to comprise up to seventy percent of its water budget in 2060. [[Groundwater]] will constitute the remainder. One of the policies of the ABCWUA's strategy is the acquisition of additional river water.<ref name="water strategy"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abcwua.org/content/view/34/27/ |title=The Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority |publisher=Abcwua.org |date=December 7, 2008 |accessdate=July 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507020947/http://www.abcwua.org/content/view/34/27/ |archivedate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> {{Rp|Policy G, 14}}

=== Religion ===
According to a study by [[Sperling's BestPlaces]], the majority of the religious population in Albuquerque are Christian.<ref name=":0">{{cite web| url=https://www.bestplaces.net/religion/city/new_mexico/albuquerque| title=Albuquerque, New Mexico Religion| website=bestplaces.net| access-date=15 September 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915123408/https://www.bestplaces.net/religion/city/new_mexico/albuquerque| archive-date=September 15, 2018| url-status=dead}}</ref>

Being a historical Spanish and Mexican city, the [[Catholic Church]] is the largest Christian church in Albuquerque. The Catholic population of Albuquerque is served by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe]], whose administrative center is located in the city. Collectively, other Christian churches and organizations such as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and others make up the second largest group in the city. [[Baptists]] form the third largest Christian group, followed by the [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saints]], [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] and [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]].

The second largest religious population in the city are [[eastern religions]] such as [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]], and [[Hinduism]].<ref name=":0" /> The Albuquerque Sikh Gurudwara and Guru Nanak Gurdwara Albuquerque serve the city's Sikh populace; the Hindu Temple Society of New Mexico serves the Hindu population; several Buddhist temples and centers are located in the city limits.

Local museums, galleries, shops and other points of interest include the [[Albuquerque Biological Park]], [[Albuquerque Museum]], [[New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science]], and [[Old Town Albuquerque]]. Albuquerque's live music/performance venues include [[The Pavilion (amphitheatre)|Isleta Amphitheater]], [[Tingley Coliseum]], [[Sunshine Building|Sunshine Theater]] and the [[KiMo Theater]].

[[New Mexican cuisine|Local cuisine]] prominently features [[New Mexico chile|green chile]], which is widely available in restaurants, including national fast-food chains. Albuquerque has an active restaurant scene, and [[:Category:Restaurants in Albuquerque, New Mexico|local restaurants]] receive statewide attention, several of them having become statewide [[restaurant chain|chains]].

The [[Sandia Peak Tramway]], adjacent to Albuquerque, is the world's second-longest passenger aerial tramway. It also has the world's third-longest single span. It stretches from the northeast edge of the city to the crestline of the [[Sandia Mountains]]. Elevation at the top of the tramway is roughly {{convert|10300|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level.

===Architecture===
{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Albuquerque}}[[John Gaw Meem]], credited with developing and popularizing the [[Pueblo Revival]] style, was based in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] but received an important Albuquerque commission in 1933 as the architect of the [[University of New Mexico]]. He retained this commission for the next quarter-century and developed the university's distinctive Southwest style.<ref name="Simmons" /> {{Rp|317}} Meem also designed the [[Cathedral Church of St. John (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Cathedral Church of St. John]] in 1950.<ref name="diocese">{{cite web| url=http://www.dioceserg.org/pages/view/history_of_the_diocese| title=History of the Diocese|publisher=Diocese of the Rio Grande| accessdate=January 3, 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328194349/http://www.dioceserg.org/pages/view/history_of_the_diocese| archivedate=March 28, 2014| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Albuquerque boasts a unique nighttime cityscape. Many building exteriors are illuminated in vibrant colors such as green and blue. The Wells Fargo Building is illuminated green. The DoubleTree Hotel changes colors nightly, and the Compass Bank building is illuminated blue. The [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] of the county courthouse is illuminated yellow, while the tops of the Bank of Albuquerque and the Bank of the West are illuminated reddish-yellow. Due to the nature of the soil in the Rio Grande Valley, the skyline is lower than might be expected in a city of comparable size elsewhere.

[[File:Albuquerque Roosevelt Park.JPG|thumb|right|[[Roosevelt Park (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Roosevelt Park]] is a historic park in central Albuquerque]]Albuquerque has expanded greatly in area since the mid-1940s. During those years of expansion, the planning of the newer areas has considered that people drive rather than walk. The pre-1940s parts of Albuquerque are quite different in style and scale from the post-1940s areas. The older areas include the North Valley, the South Valley, various neighborhoods near downtown, and Corrales. The newer areas generally feature four- to six-lane roads in a <span style="white-space:nowrap">1&nbsp;mile&nbsp;(1.61&nbsp;km)</span> grid. Each <span style="white-space:nowrap">1&nbsp;square mile&nbsp;(2.59&nbsp;km{{sup|2}})</span> is divided into four {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} neighborhoods by smaller roads set <span style="white-space:nowrap">0.5&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(0.8&nbsp;km)</span> between major roads. When driving along major roads in the newer sections of Albuquerque, one sees strip malls, signs, and cinderblock walls. The upside of this planning style is that neighborhoods are shielded from the worst of the noise and lights on the major roads. The downside is that it is virtually impossible to go anywhere without driving.

===Libraries===
The [[Albuquerque Bernalillo County Library|Albuquerque and Bernalillo County Library System]] consists of eighteen libraries to serve Albuquerque, New Mexico.<ref>https://abqlibrary.org/about-us/mission</ref> The Old Main Library was the first library of Albuquerque and from 1901 until 1948 it was the only public library. The original library was donated to the state by Joshua and Sarah Raynolds. After suffering some fire damage in 1923 the city decided it was time to construct a building for the library to be moved to, however, by 1970 even after additions were made the population and library needs had outgrown the building for its use as a main library and it was turned into Special Collections. The Old Main Library was recognized as a landmark in September 1979. 
It was not until 1974 with the movement of the South Valley Library into a new building that the Bernalillo built and administered a public library. Not long after, in 1986, the Bernalillo and Albuquerque government decided that joint powers would work best to serve the needs of the community and created the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Library System.<ref>https://abqlibrary.org/libraryhistory</ref>

===Parks and recreation===
According to the Trust for Public Land, Albuquerque has 291 public parks as of 2017, most of which are administered by the city Parks and Recreation Department. The total amount of parkland is 42.9 square miles (111 km2), or about 23% of the city's total area—one of the highest percentages among large cities in the U.S. About 82% of city residents live within walking distance of a park.

Albuquerque has a botanical and zoological complex called the [[Albuquerque Biological Park]], consisting of the Rio Grande Botanic Garden, Albuquerque Aquarium, Tingley Beach, and the Rio Grande Zoo.

The judicial system in Albuquerque includes the [[Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court]].

===Police department===

The [[Albuquerque Police Department]] (APD) is the police department with jurisdiction within the city limits, with anything outside of the city limits being considered the unincorporated area of [[Bernalillo County, New Mexico|Bernalillo County]] and policed by the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department. It is the largest municipal police department in [[New Mexico]], and in September 2008 the US Department of Justice recorded the APD as the 49th largest police department in the United States.<ref>{{cite web| title=Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies| year=2008| website=[[United States Department of Justice]]| url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/csllea08.pdf| accessdate=March 31, 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226051352/http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/csllea08.pdf| archive-date=February 26, 2013| url-status=live}}</ref>

In November 2012, the [[United States Department of Justice]] launched an investigation into APD's policies and practices to determine whether APD engages in a pattern or practice of use of excessive force in violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141 ("Section 14141").<ref name="auto">{{cite web|title=United States V.

The investigation included tours of APD facilities and Area Commands; interviews with Albuquerque officials, APD command staff, supervisors, and police officers; a review of numerous documents; and meetings with the Albuquerque Police Officers Association, residents, community groups, and other stakeholders.<ref name="auto"/>
When the Department of Justice concluded its investigation, it issued a scathing report that uncovered a "culture of acceptance of the use of excessive force" involving significant harm or injury by APD officers against people who posed no threat and which was not justified by the circumstances. The DOJ recommended a nearly complete overhaul of the department's use-of-force policies. Among several systematic problems at APD were an aggressive culture that undervalued civilian safety and discounted the importance of crisis intervention.<ref>Mike Gallagher, "[http://www.abqjournal.com/382534/news/feds-seek-consent-decree-on-reforms.html Scathing Report on APD Use of Force] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204060749/http://www.abqjournal.com/382534/news/feds-seek-consent-decree-on-reforms.html |date=February 4, 2016 }}," ''Albuquerque Journal'', April 11, 2014.

Albuquerque lies at the center of the New Mexico Technology Corridor, a concentration of high-tech private companies and government institutions along the Rio Grande. Larger institutions whose employees contribute to the population are numerous and include [[Sandia National Laboratories]], [[Kirtland Air Force Base]], and the attendant contracting companies which bring highly educated workers to a somewhat isolated region. [[Intel]] operates a large semiconductor factory or "[[Fab (semiconductors)|fab]]" in suburban [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]], in neighboring [[Sandoval County, New Mexico|Sandoval County]], with its attendant large capital investment. [[Northrop Grumman]] is located along I-25 in northeast Albuquerque, and [[Tempur-Pedic]] is located on the West Mesa next to I-40.

The [[solar power|solar energy]] and architectural-design innovator [[Steve Baer]] located his company, Zomeworks, to the region in the late 1960s; and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], [[Sandia National Laboratories|Sandia]], and [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] cooperate here in an enterprise that began with the [[Manhattan Project]]. In January 2007, Tempur-Pedic opened an {{convert|800000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} mattress factory in northwest Albuquerque. SCHOTT Solar, Inc., announced in January 2008 they would open a {{convert|200000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility manufacturing receivers for concentrated solar thermal power plants (CSP) and 64MW of photovoltaic (PV) modules. The facility closed in 2012.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Main highways====
Some of the main highways in the metro area include:

* [[Interstate 25 in New Mexico|Pan-American Freeway]]:<ref name="Bryan">{{cite book| last=Bryan| first=Howard| title=Albuquerque Remembered| publisher=[[University of New Mexico Press]]| location=Albuquerque| year=1989| isbn=0-8263-3782-1| oclc=62109913| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rSQAbMtClsYC&q=%22Pan%20American%20Freeway%22%20%22Coronado%20Freeway%22&pg=PA248|accessdate=August 5, 2009}}</ref>{{Rp|248}} More commonly known as [[Interstate 25]] or "I-25", it is the main north–south highway on the city's eastern side of the [[Rio Grande]]. It is also the main north–south highway in the state (by connecting Albuquerque with [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]]) and a plausible route of the eponymous [[Pan American Highway]]. Since [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] was decommissioned in the 1980s, the only remaining US highway in Albuquerque, unsigned [[US-85]], shares its alignment with I-25. [[US-550]] splits off to the northwest from I-25/US-85 in [[Bernalillo, New Mexico|Bernalillo]].[[File:Albuquerque - aerial - I-40 east from Juan Tabo Blvd NE.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Interstate 40]]]]
* [[Interstate 40 in New Mexico|Coronado Freeway]]:<ref name="Bryan" />{{Rp|248}} More commonly known as [[Interstate 40]] or "I-40", it is the city's main east–west traffic artery and an important transcontinental route. The freeway's name in the city is in reference to 16th century [[conquistador]] and explorer [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]].
* [[Paseo del Norte]]: (aka; New Mexico State Highway 423): This 6-lane [[controlled-access highway]] is approximately five miles north of Interstate 40. It runs as a surface road with at-grade intersections from Tramway Blvd (at the base of the Sandia Mountains) to Interstate 25, after which it continues as a controlled-access freeway through Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, over the Rio Grande to North Coors Boulevard. Paseo Del Norte then continues west as a surface road through the Petroglyph National Monument until it reaches Atrisco Vista Blvd and the Double Eagle II Airport. The interchange with Interstate 25 was reconstructed in 2014 to improve traffic flow.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cabq.gov/mayor/priorities-initiatives/initiatives/abq-the-plan/paseo-del-norte-at-i-25-interchange |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 October 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013206/https://www.cabq.gov/mayor/priorities-initiatives/initiatives/abq-the-plan/paseo-del-norte-at-i-25-interchange |archivedate=October 13, 2017  }} Paseo del Norte at I-25 Interchange Reconstruction Project – City of Albuquerque</ref>
* [[Coors Boulevard]]: Coors is the main north-south artery to the west of the Rio Grande in Albuquerque. There is one full [[interchange (road)#Complete interchanges|interchange]] where it connects with Interstate 40; The rest of the route connects to other roads with at-grade intersections controlled by [[stoplight]]s. The Interstate 25 underpass has no access to Coors. Parts of the highway have [[sidewalk]]s, [[bike lane]]s, and [[Median strip|median]]s, but most sections have only dirt shoulders and a center turn lane. To the north of Interstate 40, part of the route is numbered as [[New Mexico State Road 448|State Highway 448]], while to the south, part of the route is numbered as [[New Mexico State Road 45|State Highway 45]].
* [[New Mexico State Road 500|Rio Bravo Boulevard]]: The main river crossing between Westside Albuquerque and the [[Sunport]], Rio Bravo is a four-lane [[divided highway]] that runs from University Boulevard in the east, through the South Valley, to Coors Boulevard in the west where it is contiguous with Dennis Chaves Blvd. It follows [[New Mexico State Road 500|NM-500]] for its entire route.
* [[Central Avenue (Albuquerque)|Central Avenue]]: Central is one of the historical routings of [[US Highway 66|Route 66]], it is no longer a main through highway, its usefulness having been supplanted by Interstate 40.<ref name="Bryan" />{{Rp|248}}
* [[New Mexico State Road 528|Alameda Boulevard]]: The main road between Rio Rancho and North Albuquerque, Alameda Blvd. stretches from Tramway Rd. to Coors. Blvd. The route is designated as the eastern portion of [[New Mexico State Road 528|NM-528]].
* [[New Mexico State Road 556|Tramway Boulevard]]: Serves as a bypass around the northeastern quadrant, the route is designated as [[New Mexico State Road 556|NM-556]]. Tramway Boulevard starts at I-25 near Sandia Pueblo, and heads east as a two-lane road. It turns south near the base of the [[Sandia Peak Tramway]] and becomes an expressway-type divided highway until its terminus near I-40 and Central Avenue by the western entrance to [[Tijeras Canyon]].

The [[interchange (road)|interchange]] between I-40 and I-25 is known as the "[[Big I]]".<ref name="Bryan" />{{Rp|248}} Originally built in 1966, it was rebuilt in 2002. The Big I is the only [[Stack interchange#Five-level stack|five-level stack interchange]] in the state of New Mexico.

====Bridges====
There are six road bridges that cross the [[Rio Grande]] and serve the municipality on at least one end if not both. The eastern approaches of the northernmost three all pass through adjacent unincorporated areas, the Village of [[Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, New Mexico|Los Ranchos de Albuquerque]], or the [[North Valley, New Mexico|North Valley]]. In downstream order they are:
* '''Alameda Bridge'''
* '''Paseo del Norte Bridge'''
* '''Montaño Bridge'''
* ''' I-40 Bridge'''
* '''Central at Old Town Bridge'''
* '''Barelas Bridge'''

Two more bridges serve [[Urban area#United States|urbanized area]]s contiguous to the city's perforated southern boundary.
* '''Rio Bravo Bridge''' ([[New Mexico State Road 500|NM-500]])
* '''I-25 Bridge''' (near [[Isleta Pueblo]])

====Rail====
[[File:Downtown Albuquerque stn look south.JPG|thumb|Rail Runner Express Downtown Albuquerque station train platform]]
The state owns most of the city's rail infrastructure which is used by a commuter rail system, long distance passenger trains, and the freight trains of the [[BNSF Railway]].

====Freight service====
[[BNSF Railway]] operates a small yard operation out of Abajo yard, located just south of the César E. Chávez Ave. overpass and the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]] yards. Most freight traffic through the Central New Mexico region is processed via a much larger hub in nearby [[Belen, New Mexico]].

====Intercity rail====
[[Amtrak]]'s [[Southwest Chief]], which travels between Chicago and Los Angeles, serves the Albuquerque area daily with one stop in each direction at the [[Alvarado Transportation Center]] in downtown.

====Commuter rail====
The [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]], a [[commuter rail]] line, began service between [[Sandoval County]] and Albuquerque in July 2006 using an existing [[BNSF Railway|BNSF]] right-of-way which was purchased by New Mexico in 2005. Service expanded to [[Valencia County]] in December 2006 and to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on December 17, 2008.

====Local mass transit==== <!-- Albuquerque Traction Company, and City Electric Company redirect here -->
[[File:Albuquerque Alvarado Transportation Hub.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alvarado Transportation Center]], an intermodal transportation hub in downtown Albuquerque]]

Albuquerque was one of two cities in New Mexico to have had electric street railways. Albuquerque's horse-drawn streetcar lines were electrified during the first few years of the 20th century. The Albuquerque Traction Company assumed operation of the system in 1905. The system grew to its maximum length of {{convert|6|mi|km}} during the next ten years by connecting destinations such as [[Old Town Albuquerque|Old Town]] to the west and the [[University of New Mexico]] to the east with the town's urban center near the former [[Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway]] depot. The Albuquerque Traction Company failed financially in 1915 and the vaguely named City Electric Company was formed. Despite traffic booms during the first world war, and unaided by lawsuits attempting to force the streetcar company to pay for paving, that system also failed later in 1927, leaving the [[streetcar]]'s "motorettes" unemployed.<ref name="Myrick">{{cite book| last=Myrick| first=David F| title=New Mexico's Railroads --- An Historical Survey| publisher=Colorado Railroad Museum| location=Golden, Colorado| year=1970| id=Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 70-116915}}</ref>{{Rp|177–181}}

Today, Alvarado Station provides convenient access to other parts of the city via the city bus system, [[ABQ RIDE]]. ABQ RIDE operates a variety of bus routes, including the [[Rapid Ride]] express bus service.

In 2006, the City of Albuquerque under the administration of Mayor [[Martin Chavez]] had planned and attempted to "fast track" the development of a "Modern Streetcar" project. Funding for the US$270&nbsp;million system was not resolved as many citizens vocally opposed the project. The city and [[ABQ RIDE|its transit department]] maintain a policy commitment to the [[streetcar]] project.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2006/dec/04/council-streetcar-project-rushed/ |title=Council: Streetcar project rushed |last=Gisick |first=Michael |date=December 4, 2006 |newspaper=Albuquerque Tribune |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004065158/http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2006/dec/04/council-streetcar-project-rushed/ |archivedate=October 4, 2010  }}</ref> The project would run mostly in the southeast quadrant on Central Avenue and Yale Boulevard.

{{as of|2011}}, the city is working on a study to develop a [[bus rapid transit]] system through the Central Ave. corridor. This corridor carried 44% of all bus riders in the ABQ Ride system, making it a natural starting point for enhanced service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cabq.gov/transit/planning-for-the-future-bus-rapid-transit-brt-service-on-central-avenue |title=Planning for the Future: Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Service on Central Avenue |publisher=CABQ.gov |accessdate=October 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011184639/http://cabq.gov/transit/planning-for-the-future-bus-rapid-transit-brt-service-on-central-avenue |archivedate=October 11, 2011 }}</ref> In 2017, the city moved forward with the plans, and began construction on [[Albuquerque Rapid Transit]], or ART, including dedicated bus lanes between Coors and Louisiana Boulevards.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.brtabq.com/| title=Albuquerque Rapid Transit| accessdate=December 22, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181222173649/https://www.brtabq.com/| archive-date=December 22, 2018| url-status=dead}}</ref>
