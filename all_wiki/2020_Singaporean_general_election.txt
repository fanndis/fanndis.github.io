===Changes in election process===
The Elections Department introduced several new features for this election to help ease the election process for voters, candidates and election volunteers. Registration of voters on polling day will be done electronically and election officials need not manually strike out a voter's particulars from a hardcopy register of electors.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Electronic registration, self-inking pen among new features to be rolled out at next General Election|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/slew-improvements-voters-candidates-next-general-election|last=Cheng|first=Kenneth|date=29 November 2019|work=Today|location=Singapore|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=4 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705140843/https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/slew-improvements-voters-candidates-next-general-election|archive-date=5 July 2020}}</ref> Voters will be able to mark their candidate(s) choices more clearly using self-inking pens and enjoy shorter queuing time with the introduction of the e-registration system. Candidates are able to fill in most of the necessary documents online while election volunteers are able to count the number of votes within a shorter duration with the help of counting machines, enabling election results to be released at least 50 minutes earlier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/faster-ballot-counting-e-registration-at-next-ge|title=Faster ballot counting, e-registration at next GE|last=Lim|first=Adrian|date=23 November 2018|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123004706/https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/faster-ballot-counting-e-registration-at-next-ge|archive-date=23 November 2018|access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/self-inking-pens-prototype-polling-booths-among-changes-for-singapores-next-general|title=Self-inking pens, new polling booths among changes for Singapore's next general election|last=Lai|first=Linette|date=29 November 2019|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191208041101/https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/self-inking-pens-prototype-polling-booths-among-changes-for-singapores-next-general|archive-date=8 December 2019|access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref> In addition, there will be more polling stations, reducing the average number of voters per polling station from 3,000 to about 2,400. Senior citizens above the age of 65 will be given priority to vote between 8&nbsp;am and 12&nbsp;pm on Polling Day.<ref>{{Cite web|title=How voting will be safely conducted if done during COVID-19 situation|url=http://www.gov.sg/article/how-voting-will-be-safely-conducted-if-done-during-covid-19-situation|access-date=18 June 2020|website=gov.sg|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200621074205/https://www.gov.sg/article/how-voting-will-be-safely-conducted-if-done-during-covid-19-situation|archive-date=21 June 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Election recount]] can occur if the margin of results for a constituency are within a 2% range (or scores between 49% and 51%). Unlike the previous elections, the recount is now triggered automatically rather than being called out manually from the candidates or counting agents, which was previously seen in 1991 ([[Nee Soon Central SMC]]), 2011 (both [[2011 Singaporean presidential election|Presidential]] and Potong Pasir SMC) and 2015 (Aljunied GRC); additionally, a standby counting machine would be used for recount instead of being manually counted. Similar to past elections, overseas votes is disregarded during a recount of votes as it does not cause any impact from the eventual results, unless if the total overseas electorate is greater than the difference of votes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Singapore GE2020: Automatic recount if difference in votes between candidates is 2% or less|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-automatic-recount-if-difference-in-votes-between-candidates-is-2-or-less|access-date=1 July 2020|website=The Straits Times|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200702020655/http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-automatic-recount-if-difference-in-votes-between-candidates-is-2-or-less|archive-date=2 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=GUIDE FOR COUNTING AGENTS FOR GENERAL ELECTION 2020|url=https://www.eld.gov.sg/pdf/GE2020/Guide_for_Counting_Agents_for_General_Election_2020.pdf|access-date=1 July 2020|website=elections department|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200708122355/https://www.eld.gov.sg/pdf/GE2020/Guide_for_Counting_Agents_for_General_Election_2020.pdf|archive-date=8 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Non-constituency Member of Parliament===
{{Main|Non-constituency Member of Parliament|l1 = Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP)}}
On 27 January 2016, a bill was passed for the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]], increasing the total number of members by three to 12 members. This is the first increase for the number of members allocated since the [[2011 Singaporean general election]], where it was increased from three members to nine.<ref name=ncmp>{{Cite web|title=PM Lee Hsien Loong: NCMPs to get equal voting rights as MPs; opposition MPs to increase from 9 to 12 next GE|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ncmps-to-get-equal-voting-rights-as-mps-number-of-opposition-mps-to-go-up-to-12-from-9-from|date=2 January 2016|access-date=26 June 2020|website=The Straits Times|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627120020/https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ncmps-to-get-equal-voting-rights-as-mps-number-of-opposition-mps-to-go-up-to-12-from-9-from|archive-date=27 June 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> As in the case for previous elections, NCMPs are offered to the best-performing non-elected opposition candidates, with the number determined by the total number of opposition candidates elected; if there are at least 12 oppositions-elect, then NCMPs will not be offered, as previously seen in the [[1991 Singaporean general election|1991 election]].

The Electoral Boundaries Review Committee is made up of senior civil servants and charged with adjusting the boundaries of electoral divisions prior to an election. The government officially claims this as necessary to ensure minority participation in Parliament amidst demographic changes while ensuring an equitable number of voters represented per MP, though critics have raised allegations of [[gerrymandering]] to disadvantage the opposition.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jun Seng |first1=Ng |title=Explainer: Who's on the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee and how it draws up the GE battle lines |url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/whos-electoral-boundaries-review-committee-and-how-it-draws-ge-battle-lines |accessdate=7 June 2020 |work=Today |date=5 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200607054923/https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/whos-electoral-boundaries-review-committee-and-how-it-draws-ge-battle-lines |archive-date=7 June 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Singapore poised for election amid slowing economy|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Singapore-poised-for-election-amid-slowing-economy|access-date=23 June 2020|website=Nikkei Asian Review|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200624140120/https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Singapore-poised-for-election-amid-slowing-economy|archive-date=24 June 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=How Gerrymandering Creates Unfair Elections in Singapore|url=https://newnaratif.com/research/how-gerrymandering-creates-unfair-elections-in-singapore/share/orireyl.n.q.onq/beb68af93319772eaea025a2bc04ac89/|access-date=23 June 2020|website=New Naratif|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200625192655/https://newnaratif.com/research/how-gerrymandering-creates-unfair-elections-in-singapore/share/orireyl.n.q.onq/beb68af93319772eaea025a2bc04ac89/|archive-date=25 June 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=GE2020 analysis: Why election during Covid-19 outbreak disadvantages S'pore's opposition even more|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/03/pap-calling-for-ge-2020-covid/|access-date=23 June 2020|website=mothership.sg|language=en}}</ref> As of 2015, there were 16 GRCs and 13 SMCs.

A new [[Sengkang Group Representation Constituency|Sengkang GRC]] was formed from portions of the former Punggol East and Sengkang West SMCs and the boundaries of Tampines GRC were altered for the first time since [[2001 Singaporean general election|2001]], due to the increase in population in the northeastern area of Singapore. Four new SMCs were also carved out ([[Kebun Baru Single Member Constituency|Kebun Baru]], [[Yio Chu Kang Single Member Constituency|Yio Chu Kang]], [[Marymount Single Member Constituency|Marymount]] and [[Punggol West Single Member Constituency|Punggol West]]), three former SMCs were absorbed into neighbouring GRCs ([[Fengshan Single Member Constituency|Fengshan]], [[Punggol East Single Member Constituency|Punggol East]] and [[Sengkang West Single Member Constituency|Sengkang West]]), while two SMCs ([[Hong Kah North SMC|Hong Kah North]] and [[Potong Pasir SMC|Potong Pasir]]) had their boundaries modified. The remaining SMCs and four GRCs ([[Aljunied GRC|Aljunied]], [[Holland–Bukit Timah GRC|Holland–Bukit Timah]], [[Jurong GRC|Jurong]] and [[Tanjong Pagar GRC|Tanjong Pagar]]) were left untouched, though the Workers' Party raised questions on the abolition of SMCs that it had previously contested and lost by a narrow margin. The changes saw about 13% of voters being allocated to a new constituency and increased the number of seats from 89 to 93.<ref name="ebrc_report" />

== Political issues ==
=== Criticisms of the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic ===
Many opposition parties criticized the PAP government's handling of the pandemic. SDP's chairman Dr [[Paul Tambyah]], who is an infectious disease expert and president-elect of the [[International Society for Infectious Diseases]], claimed that the government was more concerned over a shortfall of masks than public health when it issued advisories not to wear masks unless a person was unwell. People's Voice chief Lim Tean also charged that the PAP had failed to act with "speed and decisiveness" despite having reportedly learnt the lessons from [[SARS]] 17 years ago. PSP candidate Ang Yong Guan questioned the belated "one-month delay" response after a foreign worker was admitted to hospital, which saw the virus rapidly spreading within their dormitories unchecked, leading to Singapore having the highest number of cases within [[ASEAN]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yan Liang |first1=Lim |title=Singapore GE2020: Opposition slams PAP leaders' handling of Covid-19 pandemic |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/opposition-slams-pap-leaders-handling-of-covid-19-pandemic |accessdate=11 July 2020 |agency=The Straits Times |date=11 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200708015111/https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/opposition-slams-pap-leaders-handling-of-covid-19-pandemic |archive-date=8 July 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> PSP chief Dr Tan Cheng Bock, in his 2 July Party Political Broadcast said the PAP government's "boasting in January failed to prepare Singapore for the explosion of dormitory cases in April."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/07/psp-tan-cheng-bock-pap-lost-its-way/|title=PSP's Tan Cheng Bock: I'm contesting this GE because PAP has lost its way|website=mothership.sg}}</ref>

=== 10 million population controversy===
During the English-language debate, SDP Secretary-General [[Chee Soon Juan]] touched on one of its campaign promises of saying no to a 10&nbsp;million population in Singapore, citing a 2019 article from ''[[The Straits Times]]'', to which PAP representative [[Vivian Balakrishnan]] replied that the [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Prime Minister's Office]] had issued a statement that day "advising people like you not to indulge in falsehoods" and denied that there would be a population of 10&nbsp;million in Singapore, adding that the figure was a "strawman".<ref name="1JulyFullDebateCNA">{{cite news |author1=Jalelah Abu Baker |author2=Lianne Chia |title=GE2020: PAP, PSP, WP and SDP candidates take part in 'live' General Election debate |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-live-broadcast-political-debate-pap-wp-sdp-psp-12891964 |accessdate=3 July 2020 |work=CNA |date=2 July 2020 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200702112709/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-live-broadcast-political-debate-pap-wp-sdp-psp-12891964 |archive-date=2 July 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

PAP candidate and Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat denied saying that Singapore should plan to increase its population to 10&nbsp;million people. He reiterated the Singapore government's stance that it had "never proposed or targeted for Singapore to increase the population to 10 million". PAP candidate Vivian Balakrishnan also called for the SDP to clarify its claim.

The first results were announced at 1:22&nbsp;am for Bukit Panjang SMC where PAP's Liang Eng Hwa was elected with a vote of 53.74%. The last results came at 3:44&nbsp;am in which Aljunied GRC and Nee Soon GRC are retained by WP and PAP with 59.93% and 61.90% respectively.

The end result saw PAP's vote share reduced island-wide at 61.24%, down from 69.86% in the last election in 2015. Aside from WP retaining the six seats it held in the last election, they also went on to win the new [[Sengkang GRC]], making it the second GRC to be won by an opposition party and the first time in history a new constituency was captured by an opposition party on their first attempt, and also having the largest representation for any opposition party with 10; that victory also lead to the defeat of cabinet minister [[Ng Chee Meng]], who became the third cabinet minister to lose his re-election since independence after [[Lim Hwee Hua]] and [[George Yeo]] lost Aljunied in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/historyogi/status/1281804032684593152|title=The ten seats won by WP in #GE2020 marks the first time we've had that many fully elected opposition MPs since January 1966 when there were 10 Barisan MPs.

For the second consecutive election, the [[Safe seat|PAP safe seat]] of [[Jurong GRC]] won the best-performing result of the election with 74.62%.<ref name="Jurong">{{Cite web|title=GE2020 official results: Tharman leads PAP to thumping win in Jurong GRC with 75 % of votes against RDU|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ge2020-results-tharman-leads-pap-to-thumping-win-in-jurong-grc-with-75-of-the-votes-rdu|access-date=12 July 2020|website=Straits Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200711143702/http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ge2020-results-tharman-leads-pap-to-thumping-win-in-jurong-grc-with-75-of-the-votes-rdu|archive-date=11 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Excluding overseas electorate, the voter turnout was 95.54%, or 2,535,565 voters, the highest turnout rate of any election (in both general and presidential elections) since the [[1997 Singaporean general election|1997 general election]] when 95.91% voted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.singapore-elections.com/general-election/1997/|title=PARLIAMENTARY GENERAL ELECTION 1997|author=Singapore Elections|access-date=13 July 2020}}</ref>

1.81% of votes cast were invalid votes, the lowest rate in a general election of Singapore's post-independence history, and lowest since the [[1963 Singaporean general election|1963 election]] when 0.99% were invalid (when Singapore was still a state in Malaysia).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.singapore-elections.com/general-election/1963/|title=LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY GENERAL ELECTION 1963|author=Singapore Elections|access-date=13 July 2020}}</ref>

===PAP's response===
In a press conference held in the early hours of 11 July following the results, Prime Minister Lee described PAP's 61.24% of the popular vote as "respectable" and reflected "broad-based support for the PAP" but "was not as strong a mandate as [he] had hoped for". He pledged to use the "clear mandate" responsibly to take Singapore "safely through the (COVID-19) crisis and beyond". Lee also acknowledged that there was a "clear desire" for alternative voices in parliament especially from young and first time voters and called the loss of three incumbent office holders in Sengkang as a "major loss" to his team. In an unprecedented move, Lee announced that Workers' Party leader [[Pritam Singh (Singaporean politician)|Pritam Singh]] would be designated as the official [[Leader of the Opposition (Singapore)|Leader of the Opposition]] and "will be provided with appropriate staff support and resources" to perform his role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/pm-lee-pap-will-designate-pritam-as-opposition-leader-urges-all-sporeans-to-put-aside|title=GE2020: Election results a clear mandate for PAP but also reflects desire for more diversity of voices in Parliament, says PM|date=11 July 2020|website=The Straits Times|access-date=11 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200711092648/https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/pm-lee-pap-will-designate-pritam-as-opposition-leader-urges-all-sporeans-to-put-aside|archive-date=11 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlhusR7McMg |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200712020524/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlhusR7McMg |archive-date=12 July 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/07/pritam-singh-leader-of-opposition-pm-lee/|title=Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh to be formally designated as Leader of the Opposition: PM Lee|website=mothership.sg|access-date=11 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200711132559/https://mothership.sg/2020/07/pritam-singh-leader-of-opposition-pm-lee/|archive-date=11 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Lee added that 24 newly elected first-time PAP MPs will "reinforce the renewal process" of the party. Lee added that he was "determined" to hand over to a new team of leaders in good working order after the COVID-19 crisis is overcome. Finally, PM Lee also suggested that disruption caused by the circuit breaker and the safe distancing restrictions just before the election which led to loss of income and jobs was reflected in the results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-result-pap-lee-hsien-loong-general-election-12922974|title=GE2020: PAP has a 'clear mandate', but popular vote share 'not as high' as hoped: PM Lee|date=11 July 2020|website=Channel Newsasia|access-date=11 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200711061113/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-result-pap-lee-hsien-loong-general-election-12922974|archive-date=11 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

PM Lee added that a thorough review into the conduct of the election would take place, acknowledging that the arrangements "could have been done better" following the reports of long queues at polling stations caused by additional arrangements for COVID-19.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/ge2020-voting-arrangements-could-have-been-done-better-thorough-review-be-conducted-says|title=GE2020: Voting arrangements 'could have been done better', thorough review to be conducted, says PM Lee|date=11 July 2020|website=Today|access-date=11 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200711190331/https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/ge2020-voting-arrangements-could-have-been-done-better-thorough-review-be-conducted-says|archive-date=11 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Speaking later in the day while thanking voters with his successful GRC team in Nee Soon GRC, Law and Home Affairs Minister [[K. Shanmugam]] said "a lot of soul searching and reflection" would be required to understand the message sent by the voters in the swing against PAP. When asked on his view of the PAP statement which questioned Sengkang GRC WP candidate [[Raeesah Khan]] of whether she was "worthy of consideration as an MP" which was said to have backfired and resulted in a WP victory, Shanmugam suggested that the older generation of Singaporeans takes a different approach with the younger generation of how race and religion is discussed in Singapore. Shanmugam added there "needs to be a way in which the viewpoints of younger Singaporeans" are addressed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-pap-shanmugam-clear-messages-voters-soul-searching-12924404?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter|title=Clear messages sent by voters in GE2020, 'soul searching and reflection' needed: Shanmugam|date=11 July 2020|website=Channel Newsasia}}</ref> In a radio interview with [[Money FM 89.3]] on 28 July, he mentioned that the results reflected the strain in the economy amid COVID-19, and adding that he was keenly aware of the voters' desire, especially younger ones, for diversity of representation in Parliament, with a difference between perception and reality.<ref>{{cite web |title=Two key messages from GE2020: Shanmugam |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/two-key-messages-from-ge2020-shanmugam |website=Straits Times |accessdate=28 July 2020}}</ref>

Former prime minister Goh Chok Tong called PAP's victory a "clear mandate" and called PM Lee's move to designate Pritam Singh as official leader of the opposition a "very significant move". He added opposition MPs and NCMPs will now have to "go beyond merely serving as a check-and-balance" and "put forward their alternative policies and solutions" to Singaporeans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/07/goh-chok-tong-pritam-singh/|title=Appointment of opposition leader 'a very significant move': ESM Goh|website=mothership.sg}}</ref>

On 17 July, [[Lawrence Wong]] mentioned on a separate virtual conference for the multi-task force relating to the social distancing in Hougang Avenue 5 after the polling hours ended that featured a large group of WP supporters making close contacts despite wearing masks and safe distancing, which produced a safe-distancing risks by individuals. Wong told that Singaporeans should not be complacent and added a warning that "anyone decides to abandon caution, thinks that, ‘It's okay'" could "put the whole country at risk". Despite the warning, however, there was no change in the enforcement and Wong believed that polling was conducted in open spaces and there was no close contact in terms of touching and talking, and had arranged voters different safety protocols while they cast their votes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/07/ge-celebration-covid-19-risk/|title=Those who abandon caution put themselves & country at risk: Lawrence Wong on GE celebration|website=mothership.sg}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/covid-19-election-night-crowds-will-potentially-have-consequence-says-lawrence-wong-122001227.html|title=COVID-19: Election Night crowds will potentially have 'consequence', says Lawrence Wong|website=sg.yahoo.com}}</ref>

On 19 July, [[Senior Minister]] and [[Co-ordinating Minister for Social Policies]] Tharman Shanmugaratnam mentioned that the politics had been changed permanently after the election, one with a solid mandate and one for a changing electorate, adding a fact on the results that "were also good for opposition politics", especially the performance for the WP and "reflected a discerning public and a political culture that bodes well for Singapore." Tharman aimed to achieve the balance and having a "vigorous and informed" debate between PAP and the oppositions in the upcoming government to improve efficiency and democracy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-tharman-politics-in-singapore-has-changed-permanently-12945272|title=Politics in Singapore has changed permanently following GE2020: Tharman|date=19 July 2020|website=Channel Newsasia}}</ref>

===Opposition parties' response===
Workers' Party leader [[Pritam Singh (Singaporean politician)|Pritam Singh]] said he was "grateful" and "humbled" at the support WP received, adding that he was "not feeling euphoric at all" and acknowledged "a lot of work to do". He reminded the successful candidates to keep their feet "firmly grounded" after the WP secured a second GRC in Sengkang and held onto Aljunied and Hougang with increased margins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-workers-party-pritam-singh-sengkang-aljunied-hougang-12922950?fbclid=IwAR2_Ftq36XGlTmYxOr7Shc5ZKfoWEM2KzU9w9z1XxKMAOJp-BWzW49I074Q|title=GE2020: Workers' Party candidates need to keep their feet 'firmly grounded', says Pritam Singh|date=11 July 2020|website=Channel Newsasia|access-date=11 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200711174145/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-workers-party-pritam-singh-sengkang-aljunied-hougang-12922950?fbclid=IwAR2_Ftq36XGlTmYxOr7Shc5ZKfoWEM2KzU9w9z1XxKMAOJp-BWzW49I074Q|archive-date=11 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> In a Facebook post, he wrote that he looked forward to doing his best serving as leader of the opposition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ge2020-workers-partys-pritam-singh-says-he-will-do-his-best-as-leader-of-the-opposition|title=Singapore GE2020: Workers' Party's Pritam Singh vows to do his best as leader of the opposition|date=11 July 2020|website=The Straits Times}}</ref>

Progress Singapore Party leader Tan Cheng Bock said he was proud that his party achieved an average vote share of 40.85% in the seats it contested on their maiden election despite being founded a year prior. He called it "the beginning of a new chapter for PSP", and believes the "movement" that he created will grow. He added that the party executive committee will discuss sending two candidates from West Coast GRC to serve the NCMP role in Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/ge2020-psp-average-40-score-head-start-future-says-tan-cheng-bock|title=GE2020: PSP's credible maiden showing a 'head start' for the future, says Tan Cheng Bock|date=11 July 2020|website=Today}}</ref>

Singapore Democratic Party leader Chee Soon Juan said the SDP ran a "very good campaign" focused on policies and issues but "came up short" on winning. He thanked voters and said the SDP "will continue to press on". SDP chairman Paul Tambyah added they could "hold (their) heads high for a strong campaign under the circumstances" and "will do better the next time". Tambyah accused the PAP government of "recklessness and opportunism" for holding the election during a pandemic, and also called the long queues of voters due to the requirement to wear gloves when casting ballots and lack of personal protective equipment for polling agents when voters on stay home orders came to vote as a "fiasco".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge-2020-sdps-paul-tambyah-criticises-glove-and-ppe-fiasco-says-his-party-ran|title=Singapore GE2020: SDP's Paul Tambyah criticises glove and PPE 'fiasco', says his party ran strong campaign|website=The Straits Times}}</ref>

===NCMP allocation===
Under the current constitution, opposition will be guaranteed 12 parliamentary seats which may consist of elected members of parliament (MP) from the opposition team and unsuccessful candidates in this election from the best-performing losing opposition party or parties. The number of NCMPs offered will be 12 less the number of elected MPs; there are 10 opposition-elects and thus two NCMPs will be offered after the election. Additional rules also states there could be up to two NCMPs from the best performing GRC and one from the best performing SMC.

Since the [[Progress Singapore Party]] (PSP) team led by Tan Cheng Bock contesting in the [[West Coast Group Representation Constituency|West Coast GRC]] were the best-performing losing opposition team by garnering 48.31% of valid votes, both NCMPs seats were offered to PSP.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/ge2020-2-ncmp-seats-be-offered-psps-west-coast-grc-team|title=2 NCMPs seat offered to PSP|website=Today Online}}</ref> On 14 July, PSP announced that [[Hazel Poa]] and [[Leong Mun Wai]] will take up the two NCMP positions, making them the third and fourth NCMPs that were not from WP, and a parliament with three parties representing since the [[12th Parliament of Singapore|12th Parliament]]; it also marked the first election since [[2001 Singaporean general election|2001]] the NCMPs are not awarded to WP.<ref name=PSPNCMP1>{{cite web |last1=Koh |first1=Fabian |title=GE2020: PSP chooses assistant secretary-general Leong Mun Wai and vice-chairman Hazel Poa as NCMPs |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ge2020-psp-chooses-assistant-secretary-general-leong-mun-wai-and-vice-chairman-hazel-poa-as |website=The Straits Times |accessdate=14 July 2020 |date=14 July 2020}}</ref><ref name="PSPNCMP" /> Leong and Poa's election as NCMPs were finalised by the Returning Officer Tan on 16 July.<ref name=PSPNCMP3>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eld.gov.sg/press/2020/Press_Statement_on_Election_of_Non-Constituency_Members_of_Parliament.pdf|title=Press Statement on Election of Non-Constituency Members of Parliament}}</ref>

===Election Department responses===
On 14 July, Koh Siong Ling, the head of the Election Department, issued an apology to the public and senior voters, while conducting a review on what when wrong during the election, such as long queues during voting in the early morning hours (a timing block reserved for senior voters) unlike previous elections, and the queues which was likely caused by an unnecessary, additional step on equipping disposable gloves, as voters had sanitised their hands a few times prior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/forum/forum-long-queues-of-voters-eld-looking-into-causes|title=Forum: Long queues of voters: ELD looking into causes|date=14 July 2020|website=Straits Times}}</ref> ELD also acknowledged the procedures needed to ensure safety of the voters while revealed that they have removed a mandatory step on wearing gloves in the midst of election and there were difficulties experienced by voters on its station layout, though revealed that the queues were mostly improved by 2&nbsp;pm and the extension of polling hours, despite adopting safe distancing practices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/ge-2020-eld-apologises-to-do-thorough-review-of-polling-day-long-queues-004855476.html|title=GE2020: ELD apologises, to do thorough review of Polling Day long queues|date=14 July 2020|website=Yahoo!

===Town Council===
The Ministry of National Development (MND) announced on 30 July that there were 17 town councils formed, with each town council formed from one GRC and at least one SMC in 11 out of 17 towns. Among which, Sengkang Town Council (SKTC) was brand new which was formed from the standalone Sengkang GRC, while 11 towns had changes in at least one of the areas due to [[redistricting]] and carving out divisions into SMCs, such as Ang Mo Kio Town Council (AMKTC) which was formed along with Kebun Baru SMC (transferred from Nee Soon Town Council (NSTC)) and Yio Chu Kang SMC, and Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council (BTPTC) and Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council (PRPTC) which were formed from its namesake GRCs and the newly carved Marymount SMC<ref>{{cite web |title=New town council formed to serve Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC and Marymount SMC |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/new-town-council-formed-to-serve-bishan-toa-payoh-grc-and-marymount-smc |website=Straits Times |accessdate=30 July 2020}}</ref> and Punggol West SMC, respectively. The boundaries for the five town councils were untouched from the last parliament term, namely Aljunied-Hougang (AHTC), East Coast-Fengshan (ECTC; renamed to East Coast), Holland-Bukit Panjang (HBPTC), Jurong-Clementi (JCTC) and Tanjong Pagar (TPTC), with the exception of East Coast GRC due to Fengshan SMC being absorbed into, four out of the five GRCs had experienced no boundary changes. 15 out of 17 towns were managed by PAP with the exception of AHTC and SKTC, which were managed by WP.

Under the Town Council Act, each town have until 28 October, 90 days from the date of the order issued, to effectively transfer services to the required towns applicable, though it can also mutually agree to an earlier date.<ref>{{cite web |title=17 town councils formed, including new Sengkang town council: MND |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/17-town-councils-formed-including-new-sengkang-town-council-mnd-12976222 |website=CNA |accessdate=30 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=GE2020: MND issues order to form 17 town councils, including new one in Sengkang |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ge2020-mnd-issues-order-to-form-17-town-councils |website=Straits Times |accessdate=30 July 2020}}</ref>

On 17 July, two weeks ahead of the announcement, [[He Ting Ru]] requested to manage their own Sengkang Town Council without any merging of other town councils as a chairwoman of the town council, and added that she also wrote to both AMKTC and PRPTC on 11 July to request a preliminary meeting to discuss the handover, as most of the divisions in Sengkang were under PRPTC in the last election, except Anchorvale, which is based on [[Sengkang West SMC]] (part of AMKTC).<ref>{{cite web |title=New Sengkang Town Council to be run on its own, WP's He Ting Ru to be chairman |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/new-sengkang-town-council-to-be-run-on-its-own-wps-he-ting-ru-to-be-chairman |website=Straits Times |accessdate=30 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=GE2020: WP team to establish new town council in Sengkang |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/wp-team-to-establish-new-town-council-in-sengkang |website=Straits Times |accessdate=30 July 2020}}</ref>

==Analysis==
===Media and commentator analysis===
Veteran journalist PN Balji suggested that voters sent a message to the PAP that a new style of politics and governance was needed. He added that newly elected Sengkang GRC MP [[Jamus Lim]]'s warning during the televised election debate not to give the PAP a "[[blank cheque]]" had resonated with many voters. A desire for alternative voices in parliament drove the swing to the opposition and the tactics against [[Raeesah Khan]] has backfired on PAP especially for younger voters in Sengkang, where more than 65% of residents are aged below 45 and less than 10% are aged above 65.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/ge2020-sengkang-residents-give-reasons-why-they-plumped-wp-including-better-connection-candidates|title=GE2020: Sengkang residents give reasons why they plumped for WP, including a better connection with its candidates|website=Today}}</ref> He added that the PAP had no central figure in charge of its campaign and PAP's plea for a "strong mandate" to lead Singapore out of the COVID-19 crisis had failed to resonate with voters. Historically, PAP tended to do well when there was a crisis such as in the [[2001 Singaporean general election|2001 election]], held following the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States which led to a recession where PAP secured 75.29% of the vote. Pritam Singh's handling of WP's election campaign and his response to the police report into Raeesah Khan was praised, by moving quickly to stand by the candidate.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/pn-balji-maturing-singaporean-voter-ge2020|title=PN Balji: The maturing of the Singaporean voter in GE2020|website=asiaone.com}}</ref>

The election was also seen as a rebuke to the PAP's "fourth generation" (4G) leaders<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-election-succession/singapore-ruling-party-stung-by-poll-setback-faces-succession-questions-idUSKCN24C09B|title=Singapore ruling party, stung by poll setback, faces succession questions|website=Reuters}}</ref> which saw their vote majorities slashed, such the "prime minister in waiting" Heng Swee Keat narrowly retaining East Coast GRC with a marginal 53.41% and the defeat of [[Ng Chee Meng]] and his team in Sengkang GRC. In contrast, senior PAP leaders' constituencies fared better such as Jurong GRC (74.62%), Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC (64.15%) and Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC (67.26%) despite seeing an anti-PAP vote swing. Speculation rose that PAP will be forced to rethink the issue of leadership transition given the lacklustre results for the 4G leaders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3092762/singapore-election-5-key-takeaways-voters-deny-ruling-pap-blank|title=Singapore election: 5 key takeaways as voters deny ruling PAP a ‘blank cheque’|website=[[South China Morning Post]]|access-date=12 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200712021929/https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3092762/singapore-election-5-key-takeaways-voters-deny-ruling-pap-blank|archive-date=12 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Former PAP MP [[Inderjit Singh (Singaporean politician)|Inderjit Singh]] criticised the PAP for running personal attacks instead of focusing on the issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/07/inderjit-singh-pap-ge2020-criticism/?fbclid=IwAR3tlS88vLtgeHw5pUGrcOaOhZIzjv3846_DZI2r_mvuikxmuCT5RjXdbEs|title=Ex-PAP MP Inderjit Singh: PAP focused more on opposition candidates rather than explaining policies|website=mothership.sg}}</ref> He added that there was a perception that the PAP had failed to adequately address issues of contention during the last term like the [[Presidential elections in Singapore#Reserved elections|reserved presidential elections]], [[Public housing in Singapore#Asset enhancement policy|expiring Housing and Development Board (HDB) leases]], population and job policies, and rising cost of living. There was also a perception that the PAP's fourth generation (4G) leaders were arrogant and elitist, a "natural aristocracy who project a “we know best" attitude".<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/kbinderjit/posts/3642116785815028|title=Reflections on GE 2020 (Part 2 of 2)|website=facebook.com}}</ref> Singh suggested that Prime Minister Lee saved the PAP from losing more votes to below 60% when he said in his lunchtime rally that he would delay handing over to the 4G until the COVID-19 crisis was over, along with Tharman Shanmugaratnam presenting the government's strategy for the next term during the final days of campaigning, adding the fact that "the GRC system is no longer an advantage for the PAP" as PAP fared better even with first time candidates in SMCs but performing below expectations in GRCs with strong credible opposition candidates.<ref name="auto1"/>

Finally, Inderjit Singh suggested the results for Aljunied GRC was a sign that Singaporeans have matured on the question of race where three elected WP candidates were minorities.<ref name="auto3">{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/07/inderjit-singh-workers-party-brand-recognition/?fbclid=IwAR0OXDjHGHghnDjwweS8YFPXP6CrOyFyd3SkMKvtlgCvROMEZA4imb1L8xQ|title=Ex-PAP MP Inderjit Singh: The Workers' Party has gained 'brand recognition' as a reputable party|website=mothership.sg}}</ref> Under the tenure of former leader Low Thia Khiang, WP established a Chinese-speaking support base. 
There were concerns citing that the fielding of more minority candidates and the failure to send a representative to the Chinese language televised election debate which may hamper WP's chances from holding Aljunied for a third term,<ref name="auto3"/> but WP held on with a 9%-swing and expanded its support under Pritam Singh;<ref name="auto1"/><ref name="auto"/> Inderjit went on to praise WP on the quality of its selection of candidates and voters "are therefore willing to vote on the brand name" of the party instead of looking at the candidates' merits.<ref name="auto3"/>

Other analysts said that the election showed that Singaporeans are beginning to move away from "bread and butter" issues which have been typically discussed in past election campaigns, towards topics like social inequality and government accountability. The swing against the government during a crisis was seen as "unprecedented", as Singaporeans were usually seen as "traditionally risk-averse".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-opposition-vote-swing-bread-butter-issues-pap-wp-12924252?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter|title=GE2020: Opposition vote swing shows people are looking beyond bread and butter issues, analysts say|website=[[Channel Newsasia]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-11/singapore-s-version-of-a-political-shock-upends-the-old-playbook|title=Singapore’s Version of a Political Shock Upends the Old Playbook|website=[[Bloomberg News]]|access-date=12 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200711094915/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-11/singapore-s-version-of-a-political-shock-upends-the-old-playbook|archive-date=11 July 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Citi economist Kit Wei Zheng argued that as a result of the election among other things, due to discontent related to foreign workers (especially those white collar workers who compete with locals, such as the author, in industries such as financial services), the government could shrink this portion of the workforce which would affect both long term growth as well as property prices. He also believed it would shift the country towards more left-leaning policies.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-07-13|title=Singapore Vote Result May Prompt Tweaks to Foreign Labor Rules|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-13/singapore-vote-result-may-see-tweaks-to-foreign-labor-rules-gst|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 July 2020|website=Bloomberg.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=WEE|first=RAE|date=14 July 2020|title=GE results could tilt some policies further left: Citi|url=https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/ge-results-could-tilt-some-policies-further-left-citi|access-date=14 July 2020|website=The Business Times|language=en}}</ref> Others such as Chua Hak Bin and Associate Professor Lawrence Loh took a more nuanced view, suggesting that voters were swayed more by the quality of the opposition candidates and a shift from basic needs to social responsibilities.<ref>{{Cite web|last=hermes|date=12 July 2020|title=Singapore GE2020: A watershed election and new normal?|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/a-watershed-election-and-new-normal|access-date=14 July 2020|website=The Straits Times|language=en}}</ref>

Group Representation Constituencies were traditionally regarded as a PAP "fortress" in the past, but [[The Straits Times]] political analyst Linette Lai mentioned that GRCs now no longer became a "haven" but cited that the scheme is still a dilemma to win, regardless if the GRC is helmed by an anchor minister or not. In another analysis through an interview, NUS economics professor Ivan Png mentioned that PAP outperformed more in single-member constituencies than in GRCs, while another NUS political professor Bilveer Singh cited the opposition success like how WP managed to retain Aljunied GRC for two terms (nine years) up until the election. Observers noted a pattern that overstates the degree to which GRCs are now vulnerable, even to opposition parties that fielded credible teams, such as in the case for PSP's Tan and WP's Pritam contesting in West Coast GRC and Aljunied GRC respectively. Law professor Eugene Tan explained the GRCs are "not invincible" and "The PAP may well win big in GRCs, but it must not be forgotten that it has lost, and can lose big, in GRCs." Risk analyst Harrison Cheng mentioned the GRC system is meant to be difficult to lose to the oppositions though not impossible.<ref>{{Cite web|date=17 July 2020|title=GE2020: Are GRCs still PAP fortresses after this GE?|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/are-grcs-still-pap-fortresses-after-this-ge|website=The Straits Times|language=en}}</ref>

In an survey conducted by the [[Institute of Policy Studies (Singapore)|Institute of Policy Studies]] on 1 October, the PAP's opinion ratings has dropped by 93% from the last election down to 86%, while WP came second with ratings rising from 71% to 79%, and the new PSP have ratings of 60%.<ref>{{cite web |title=GE2020: PAP’s credibility dipped, WP's went up from previous polls, says IPS post-election survey |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-pap-wp-credibility-ips-post-election-survey-13169044 |accessdate=6 October 2020}}</ref>

In another observation according to Analytix Labs chief data analyst Chua Chin Hon, [[Facebook]] has became a widely used social media platform that tackle serious questions, and increasing its trend starting on April and overtaking the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] topics, based on a 8 October's analysis report.<ref>{{cite web |title=GE2020 results less surprising if parties paid attention to Facebook interactions, says researcher |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-results-less-surprising-parties-paid-attention-facebook-13230140 |publisher=CNA |accessdate=9 October 2020}}</ref>

===PAP's analysis of result===
In a press conference on July 18, [[Lawrence Wong]] stated while 61.2% was a "clear mandate", it was below what PAP expected at 65% of the popular vote. He acknowledged that the Workers' Party ran a good campaign with a message of more checks and balances in Parliament resonating with many voters and the PSP had strong appeal in some parts of Singapore such as their western strongholds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-lawrence-wong-pap-to-do-more-win-young-middle-aged-voters-12943628|title=GE2020: PAP to do more to win back support from middle-aged voters feeling economic pain, says Lawrence Wong|website=[[Channel Newsasia]]}}</ref> He attributed a fall in support amongst voters aged in the 40s and 50s, and perhaps those in their early 60s driving the swing against the government. He added that the swing against PAP was not concentrated solely amongst younger voters while acknowledging unhappiness about the PAP style of campaigning, or how race issues were discussed and also the use of POFMA against opposition candidates. Middle-aged voters, he specified, voted against PAP due to economic hardship from business disruptions, job and income losses and also professionals who were displaced and forced into jobs with lower pay. Wong concluded that it was unlikely that PAP would win more than 65% in future due to increased desire for diversity in Parliament and for checks and balances, calling it a "new reality". He added that PAP had to better understand and connect with younger voters by being "a party that is able to represent their aspirations and bond with them" and address the “real economic pain” that a substantial segment of people in their 40s and 50s are feeling, also known as the "sandwiched generation" who are looking after elderly parents and also caring for young children.<ref>{{Cite web|date=18 July 2020|title=GE2020 results a ‘clear mandate’ although 61.2 per cent vote share lower than 65 per cent PAP hoped for: Lawrence Wong|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-results-a-clear-mandate-though-61-2-per-cent-vote-share-was-lower-than-65|website=The Straits Times|language=en}}</ref>

===Use of social media and technology===
As the first election where physical rallies are not allowed due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], social media, internet and [[internet memes|memes]], and for the first time in the history of elections, Constituency Political Broadcasts have been heavily used in terms on campaigning, and thus the increase of the election expenses, where it was capped at S$4 per voter per the number of electoral division by average.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1 July 2020|title=ELD Campaigning |url=https://www.eld.gov.sg/candidate_parliamentary_campaign.html|website=Elections Department|language=en}}</ref> An analyst company, Circus Social suggested that candidates with a higher credibility or mention during the election generally performed better, such as in the case of WP's Aljunied GRC and Sengkang GRC teams and PSP's West Coast GRC team.<ref>{{Cite web|date=18 June 2020|title=Singapore GE: Maximum spending for election stays at $4 per voter|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge-maximum-spending-for-election-stays-at-4-per-voter|website=The Straits Times|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=18 July 2020|title=IN FOCUS: At Singapore’s first pandemic election, did parties do enough to win support online?|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-covid-19-pandemic-election-parties-win-support-online-12941118|website=CNA|language=en}}</ref>

In another data analysis website [[Meltwater]], the volume for social media conversations has increased by at least four-fold compared to the previous election in 2015, with the volume peaked on polling day where it had 128,311 conversations as compared to 8,071. PAP took up nearly half of the entire conversations during the entire election period, followed by WP which garnered more than a quarter of conversations and the most [[Facebook]] interactions, then PSP and SDP at about 8% each. Analysis however reported that it was currently 'unclear' if whether social media interactions do necessarily translate into votes, but heavily praised on the efficiency of resources and campaigning and would continue to do so in future elections.<ref>{{cite web |title=Most talked-about SG political parties and politicians on social media |url=https://www.marketing-interactive.com/study-finds-most-talked-about-political-parties-were-active-on-social-media |website=Marketing Interative |accessdate=26 July 2020}}</ref> [[Institute of Policy Studies (Singapore)|Institute of Policy Studies]] researcher and vice-chairman of Media Literacy Council Carol Soon mentioned the evolving use of technology but most features were lesser used when writing posts, and noted that the smaller parties, such as RDU and RP, were putting at a disadvantage due to a smaller supporter's base. Associate Professor [[Eugene Tan]] emphasises that receiving viral headlines or highlights during election, such as Jamus Lim and Raeesah Khan, and the [[blooper]] made by [[Heng Swee Keat]] during his acceptance speech about the "East Coast plan",<ref>{{cite news |author1=Anna Maria Romero |title=Going viral: GE meme comparing Nicole Seah with Heng Swee Keat – The Independent News |url=http://theindependent.sg/going-viral-ge-meme-comparing-nicole-seah-with-heng-swee-keat/ |accessdate=4 July 2020 |publisher=The Independent Singapore |date=4 July 2020 |language=en}}</ref> contributed a crucial factor on canvassing votes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Social media volume increased four-fold for GE2020: Data |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/social-media-volume-increased-four-fold-for-ge2020-data-video-12935628 |website=CNA |accessdate=26 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Singapore GE2020: Lessons learnt from Singapore's first true Internet election |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/lessons-learnt-from-singapores-first-true-internet-election |website=Straits Times |accessdate=26 July 2020}}</ref>

===Expenditure spent by candidates===
Under the rules by the Election Department, each candidate's spending limit is S$4 per voter multiplied by the total electorate in an electoral division (with no maximum spending cap), and participating candidates were required to declare their election expenses within 31 days after the election (all 192 candidates managed to declare it on 15 August<ref>[https://www.eld.gov.sg/gazettes/2020/Inspection_of_Election_Expenses_Return_for_General_Election_2020.pdf Inspection of Election Expenses Return for General Election 2020.pdf]</ref>), after which inspection are allowed from that date onwards until six months later on 20 February 2021. A report published on 21 August that S$9,164,967 were spent from all 192 candidates in total, more than the figure of S$7,136,943 compared from the 2015 election;<ref>{{cite web |title=GE2015 spending: PAP candidates spent $5.3m while the eight opposition parties' expenses totalled $1.8m |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ge2015-spending-pap-candidates-spent-53m-while-the-eight-opposition-parties-expenses |publisher=Straits Times |accessdate=21 August 2020}}</ref> among the expenditure, PAP spent the largest at S$6,972,369, followed by PSP at S$781,275, then WP with S$705,647, and SDP S$323,292. The figure also accounted to a combined S$7.82 million for election advertising (mostly through internet), and about S$5.6 million for prints, but other details that specified the purchases for services and items for the candidates or parties were not mentioned. Analyst [[Eugene Tan]] highlighted PSP's expenditure in a statement for a new party "the need to get the message out there in what is a very crowded opposition space in a very short time probably necessitated that sort of higher spending".<ref>{{cite web |title=GE2020 expenses: PAP candidates spent nearly S$7 million, while opposition candidates used S$2.2 million |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-expenses-pap-wp-candidates-voters-general-election-13042388?cid=fbcna |publisher=CNA |accessdate=21 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=$9.1 million spent by candidates on GE2020 campaign |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/91-million-spent-by-candidates-on-ge2020-campaign |publisher=Straits Times |accessdate=21 August 2020}}</ref>
