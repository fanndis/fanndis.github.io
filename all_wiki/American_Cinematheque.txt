The '''American Cinematheque''' is an independent, [[non-profit|nonprofit]] cultural organization in [[Los Angeles]] dedicated exclusively to the public presentation of the [[Film|moving image]] in all its forms.<ref>[http://www.laweekly.com/location/aero-theatre-2184664 LA Weekly]</ref>

The Cinematheque was created in 1981 as an offshoot of the annual [[Filmex]] Los Angeles Film Festival, which ran every year from 1971 to 1983. After five years of fundraising and planning, the Cinematheque launched its first series of screenings in 1987. It presents festivals and retrospectives that screen the best of worldwide cinema, video, and television from the past and present, ranging from the classics to the outer frontiers of the art form. In addition to presenting and celebrating all aspects of the moving picture on the big screen, the Cinematheque also provides a forum where film lovers and students can hear the world's leading filmmakers, actors, writers, editors, cinematographers, and others discussing their craft.

==The Cinematheque's Theaters==

Between 1987 and 1998, the Cinematheque presented its programs at a variety of venues, including the [[Directors Guild of America]] theater and the Raleigh Studios complex in Hollywood. In December 1998, it opened its own permanent home at the Egyptian in [[Hollywood]], and in 2004 added a second theater, the [[Aero Theatre]], in [[Santa Monica]]. It now presents festivals, retrospectives, and assorted programs at these two theaters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://entertainment.inquirer.net/366015/lav-diaz-comes-to-la-to-be-saluted-in-american-cinematheques-first-tribute-to-a-filipino-filmmaker|title=Lav Diaz comes to LA to be saluted in American Cinematheque's first tribute to a Filipino filmmaker|last=Nepales|first=Ruben V.|website=entertainment.inquirer.net|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>

[[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]] is the Hollywood movie palace built in 1922 by showman [[Sid Grauman]] (four years prior to opening his [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|Chinese Theatre]]). It was the location of Hollywood's first-ever movie premiere in 1922. In 1998, the American Cinematheque completed a major $12.8 million renovation that restored the theater's exterior to its original form, and added new film, video, and audio technology.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The [[Aero Theatre]] in Santa Monica is a 1940 landmark movie theater that has also been renovated by the American Cinematheque.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/classichollywood/la-et-mn-ca-aero-theatre-classic-hollywood-20150118-story.html Los Angeles Times]</ref><ref>[https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/aero-theatre Los Angeles Conservancy]</ref>

===Film Festivals===
The American Cinematheque is home to a number of annual film festivals, which cover diverse topics, genres, and international cinemas. Its annual Beyond Fest, now entering its eighth year, is the highest attended genre film festival in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bell |first1=Nathaniel |title=BEYOND FEST CLOSING WEEK SCARES UP BLOOD ON HER NAME, NATURAL BORN KILLERS AND MORE |url=https://www.laweekly.com/beyond-fest-scares-up-blood-on-her-name-the-evil-dead-reimagined/ |website=LAWEEKLY |accessdate=9 May 2020}}</ref>

For the last 22 years, the Cinematheque has partnered with the Film Noir Foundation on its longest running festival, Noir City: Hollywood, that celebrates the history of film noir.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Turan |first1=Kenneth |title='Noir City: Hollywood' returns with Rita Hayworth, military films and David Mamet |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2020-02-27/noir-city-hollywood-returns-with-rita-hayworth-military-films-and-david-mamet |website=LA Times |accessdate=9 May 2020}}</ref> Nitrate Nights, one of The American Cinematheque’s newer film festivals, offers rare chances to see films on 35mm nitrate [[film base]], a format abandoned in the early 1950s due to its highly flammable quality. After being retrofitted to project nitrate safely in 2016, the Cinematheque has since partnered with such film archives as the [[George Eastman Museum]], the [[Library of Congress]], the [[Academy Film Archive]] and the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]] to bring rare archival prints to the screen for the public.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lindahl |first1=Chris |title=Christopher Nolan Hopes Nitrate Print of 'Rebecca' Will Reestablish the Film's Place in Hitchcock's Legacy |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/nitrate-film-flammable-egyptian-theatre-george-eastman-1202190206/ |website=indiewire.com |accessdate=11 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Turan |first1=Kenneth |title=Critic's Choice: Nitrate lives on at the Egyptian |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-critics-choice-20180315-story.html |website=LA Times |accessdate=9 May 2020}}</ref>

The Cinematheque also partners annually with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to present the Golden Globe Foreign-Language Nominees Series, which includes screenings of the year’s nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.<ref>{{cite web |title=Also in Theatres Column |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/50462010/golden-globe-foreign-language-nominees/ |website=newspapers.com |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=11 May 2020}}</ref>Each year the series has culminated in a panel discussion symposium with the directors of the five nominated films.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cramer |first1=Alex |title=Alfonso Cuaron, Nadine Labaki, More Foreign-Language Directors Honored by American Cinematheque |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alfonso-cuaron-nadine-labaki-more-golden-globe-nominated-foreign-language-directors-honored-by-ameri-1173564 |website=www.hollywoodreporter.com |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=11 May 2020}}</ref>
