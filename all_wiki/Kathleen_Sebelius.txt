==Kansas House of Representatives (1987–1995)==
Sebelius was first elected to the [[Kansas House of Representatives]] in 1986. She won re-election in 1988, 1990, and 1992. She represented [[Topeka, Kansas]].

===Tenure===
In the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]], she endorsed [[Gary Hart]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WE&s_site=kansas&p_multi=WE&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADB30D40EF35F9&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Wichita Eagle: Search Results |date=May 9, 1987}}</ref>

==Kansas Insurance Commissioner (1995–2003)==
In 1994, Sebelius left the House to run for state Insurance Commissioner and stunned political forecasters by winning{{spaced ndash}}the first time a Democrat had won the position in over a century.

She refused to take [[campaign finance|campaign contributions]] from the insurance industry and blocked the proposed merger of [[Blue Cross Blue Shield]] of Kansas, the state's largest [[health insurance|health insurer]], with an [[Indiana]]-based company. Sebelius's decision marked the first time the corporation had been rebuffed in its acquisition attempts.<ref name=NWTF>{{cite press release |title=Political Women Go Hunting|date=October 27, 2004|publisher=National Wild Turkey Federation |url=http://www.nwtf.org/nwtf_newsroom/press_releases.php?id=11289}}</ref>

When Sebelius became Commissioner in 1995, the Insurance Department had an annual budget of $11.7 million. By 2002, the budget had been cut to $10 million. Among the cuts was spending on contracted services after Sebelius fired two contracted lawyers after an audit discovered they had overbilled the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/garden-city-telegram-sep-28-2002-p-5/|title=Candidates tout their records on budget cuts|last=Kessinger|first=Sarah|date=September 28, 2002|via=NewspaperArchive.com|work=Garden City Telegram|pages=1–A5|language=en|access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref>

In 2001 Sebelius was named as one of ''[[Governing Magazine]]''{{'}}s Public Officials of the Year while she was serving as Kansas Insurance Commissioner.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gurwitt|first=Rob|title=Kathleen Sebelius: Believer in Balance|date=November 2001 |work=Governing Magazine|url=http://governing.com/poy/2001/1sebel.htm}}</ref>

===2002 election===

===First term===
Throughout her first term, Sebelius built upon her popularity and in January 2006 was tied for 20th most popular governor in the country.<ref>SurveyUSA (2006).

During the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 election]], CNN speculated Sebelius could be a potential running mate for [[John Kerry]].<ref>CNN (2004).

In November 2005, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named Sebelius as one of the five best governors in America, praising her for eliminating a $1.1 billion [[debt]] she inherited, ferreting out waste in state government, and strongly supporting public education{{spaced ndash}}all without raising taxes, although she proposed raising sales, property, and income taxes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legislature.cjonline.com/stories/011304/leg_stateofstate.shtml|title=State of the State Union Address|date=January 13, 2004|access-date=June 1, 2016}}{{dead link|date=June 2016 |bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The article also praised her bipartisan approach to governing, a useful trait in a state where Republicans have usually controlled the [[Kansas Legislature|Legislature]].<ref>Time (2006).

In February 2006, the [[The White House Project|White House Project]] named Sebelius one of its "8 in '08," a group of eight female politicians who could possibly run and/or be elected president in 2008.<ref>The White House Project (2006). {{cite web |url=http://198.65.255.167/v2/press/2006/February/20060216-8for08pressrel.html|title=Archived copy|access-date=February 9, 2016 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128091936/http://198.65.255.167/v2/press/2006/February/20060216-8for08pressrel.html|archive-date=January 28, 2012}} Retrieved March 19, 2008.</ref> She was also cited by ''[[The New York Times]]'' to be among the women most likely to become the first female President of the United States.<ref name="Zernike2008">{{cite news |first=Kate|last=Zernike|title=She Just Might Be President Someday |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/weekinreview/18zernike.html |work=New York Times|date=May 18, 2008}}</ref>

In October 2006, the [[Cato Institute]] gave Sebelius the grade of "D" on their biennial fiscal policy report card, which measures the fiscal performance of U.S. governors based on spending and taxes. Her grade was influenced by the combination of proposed tax increases and expanded spending growth beyond population plus inflation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa581.pdf |title=Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors: 2006|publisher=Cato Institute|page=23}}</ref>

===2006 re-election===
{{main|2006 Kansas gubernatorial election}}
[[File:FEMA - 31226 - Governor Sebelius meets with FEMA Regional Admin. Hainje.jpg|thumb|Sebelius meets with [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] workers in Kansas]]
On May 26, 2006, Sebelius formally announced her candidacy for re-election. Four days later, [[Mark Parkinson]], former chair of the [[Kansas Republican Party]], switched his party affiliation to Democrat; the following day Sebelius announced that Parkinson would be her running mate for [[Lieutenant Governor of Kansas|lieutenant governor]]. Parkinson had previously served in the state House during 1991–1992 and the Senate during 1993–1997. Parkinson was viewed as a pro-business [[moderate]] who strongly supported [[public education]]. This was somewhat reminiscent of the fact that [[John E. Moore|John Moore]] had also been a Republican, before switching just days prior to joining Sebelius as her running mate.<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Twitty |title=Kan. gov. selects running mate for race|date=May 31, 2006|agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/national/1134AP_Kansas_Governors_Race.html|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

She was challenged by Republican [[Kansas Senate|Kansas State Senator]] [[Jim Barnett (Kansas politician)|Jim Barnett]]. A September 1 [[Rasmussen Reports|Rasmussen]] poll showed Sebelius with an 11% lead over Barnett.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/governor_races/kansas_governor_sebelius_lead_narrows|title=Kansas Governor: Sebelius Lead Narrows|access-date=December 1, 2008|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201130618/http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/governor_races/kansas_governor_sebelius_lead_narrows|archive-date=December 1, 2008}}. Rasmussen Reports. September 1, 2006</ref> Other polls gave Sebelius as much as a 20% lead. {{As of|2004}}, 50% of Kansas voters were registered Republicans, compared to 27% as registered Democrats.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/KS/P/00/ Election 2004]. Cnn.com. Retrieved on February 11, 2012.</ref> Sebelius nevertheless won re-election, defeating Barnett 57%-41%. Because of Kansas's [[term limits]] law, her second term as Governor was her last.

===Second term===
{{see also|Kansas state budget (2008–09)}}
In February 2008, during Sebelius's second term in office, there was a report in the ''[[Wichita Eagle]]'' that the State of Kansas was suspending [[tax refund]]s and that, because of a lack of tax revenue, may not have been able to meet payroll for state employees.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hanna|first=John|title=Kan. suspends income tax refunds, may miss payroll|newspaper=Wichita Eagle|date=February 16, 2009 |url=http://www.kansas.com/735/story/701750.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217221536/http://www.kansas.com/735/story/701750.html|archive-date=February 17, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Smith|first=Ben|title=Gibbs on Sebelius|newspaper=Politico.com |date=February 16, 2009 |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0209/Gibbs_on_Sebelius.html}}</ref> Sebelius called for issuing certificates of indebtedness, moving funds from various state agency accounts into the general fund to alleviate the crisis. However, Republican leaders in the legislature did not agree with her certificate of indebtedness plan, saying the state would be unable to repay the certificates unless Sebelius issued allotments or signed a budget rescission bill that had been passed by the legislature but had not yet been delivered to her desk. The standoff ended when the budget arrived, and Sebelius agreed to sign it, although she line-item vetoed several cuts she felt were too large. The rescission bill reduced the budget by about $300 million. $7 million of the cuts came in the form of reduced educational funding.<ref>{{cite news|first=Kristen|last=Waggener|url=http://www.herald-online.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1605:usd-416-faces-state-cuts-of-33-per-student&catid=38:school-board&Itemid=45|title=USD 416 faces state cuts of $33 per student|agency=Louisburg Herald|date=February 25, 2009}}</ref>

On September 13, 2012, the Office of Special Counsel charged Sebelius with violating the [[Hatch Act of 1939|Hatch Act]] by making a political remark during an official government event.

On April 21, 2008, Sebelius vetoed House Substitute for Senate Bill 389, titled the ''Comprehensive Abortion Reform Act'' by its sponsors. Proponents of the bill argued the legislation would strengthen late-term abortion laws and prevent so-called "[[coercion|coerced]] abortions," particularly with respect to minors. The ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' reported that HS SB 389 would have required the State of Kansas to collect patient diagnostic information providing detailed medical justification for late-term abortions, and would have also permitted litigants to sue abortion providers if they thought that a relative of theirs was planning a late-term abortion in violation of Kansas law.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Sullinger|title=Kansas Senate fails to override veto of abortion law|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/breaking_news/story/599260.html|work=The Kansas City Star|date=May 30, 2008 |access-date=June 11, 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Sebelius objected to the constitutionality, efficacy and morality of the proposed legislation. She wrote, "The [[United States Supreme Court]] decisions make clear that any law regulating abortion must contain exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life or health. However, SB 389 allows a variety of individuals to seek a court order preventing a woman from obtaining an abortion, even where it may be necessary to save her life. I am concerned that the bill is unconstitutional or even worse, endangers the lives of women." In addition, she expressed concern that the bill would "likely encourage extensive litigation" and that it "unnecessarily jeopardizes the privacy of Kansas women's confidential medical records."<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Sebelius is a member of the [[Catholic Church]]; however, in early March 2009, then-[[Archbishop]] [[Raymond Leo Burke]], prefect for the [[Apostolic Signatura]], the [[Holy See]]'s highest court, declared that Sebelius [[Catholic politicians, abortion and communion or excommunication|should not approach the altar]] for [[Eucharist|Communion]] in the United States, saying that, "after pastoral [[admonition]], she obstinately persists in serious [[sin]]".<ref>{{cite news|first=Julia|last=Duin|title=Sebelius in trouble with Catholic Church|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/mar/24/catholic-church-to-pressure-hhs-nominee-on-abortio/|work=The Washington Times|publisher=The Washington Times|date=March 24, 2009|access-date=September 9, 2009}}</ref> [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]] Archbishop [[Joseph Fred Naumann]] also asked that Sebelius no longer receive [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] because of her position on abortion.

===Morning-after pill===
Despite her pro-choice view, in December 2011, Sebelius overruled the FDA's recommendation on making the "[[morning-after pill]]" (Plan B One-Step) available over the counter for females under the age of 17.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/08/health/policy/sebelius-overrules-fda-on-freer-sale-of-emergency-contraceptives.html Plan to Widen Availability of Morning-After Pill Is Rejected] By GARDINER HARRIS, New York Times, December 7, 2011</ref> President Obama said that the decision was Sebelius's, not his.<ref>[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/12/Obama-No-involvement-in-Plan-B-decision-581152/1 Obama defends Plan B decision 'as father of two daughters'] By David Jackson, USA TODAY December 8, 2011</ref>

Judge [[Edward R. Korman]] of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York struck down this restriction, calling it "frivolous" and "silly", and alleging that pure politics — not scientific evidence — was behind efforts by Sebelius to block easier distribution to young girls. The Obama administration, in response, lowered the age limit from 17 to 15 but decided to appeal this ruling to maintain the loosened restrictions, in a move that was widely criticized by advocates of reproductive rights.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|title=U.S. to Defend Age Limits on Morning-After Pill Sales|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/health/us-will-appeal-order-on-morning-after-pill.html |access-date=May 11, 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=May 1, 2013}}</ref>

===Capital punishment===
Sebelius is an opponent of [[capital punishment]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/kathleen_sebelius/index.html|title=Kathleen Sebelius Biography |access-date=July 14, 2008|work=New York Times|first=Kevin|last=Sack}}</ref> During her first term, the [[Capital punishment in Kansas|Kansas capital punishment laws]] were declared unconstitutional by the [[Kansas Supreme Court]]. However, on [[appeal]] by [[Kansas Attorney General]] [[Phill Kline]], the ruling was again overturned and the current law reinstated by the [[United States Supreme Court]].

===Drug importation===
As governor of Kansas, Sebelius adopted a state [[Gray market|drug importation]] program in 2004 to help her constituents afford prescription medication.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cjonline.com/stories/113004/kan_sebeliustext.shtml|title=Full text of Gov.

The program later went on to include Australia and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ihealthbeat.org/articles/2005/7/19/australia-and-new-zealand-added-to-isaverx-suppliers|title=Australia and New Zealand Added to I-SaveRx Suppliers|access-date=August 21, 2013 |work=ihealthbeat.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019040745/http://www.ihealthbeat.org/articles/2005/7/19/australia-and-new-zealand-added-to-isaverx-suppliers|archive-date=October 19, 2015}}</ref> Due to federal laws prohibiting personal drug importation under most circumstances, the FDA intercepted some prescription orders en route to Americans who participated in I-SaveRx; while in most cases prescription imports for personal use are not seized.

===Education===
[[File:On Thursday, February 17, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius visited the Judy Hoyer Early Learning Center at Cool Springs Elementary School in Adelphi, Maryland (4).jpg|thumb|Sebelius at Cool Springs Elementary School in [[Adelphi, Maryland]].]]

Early in the term, Sebelius made education funding her top priority. Education funding reached a breaking point in the summer of 2005 when the [[Kansas Supreme Court]] ordered the [[Kansas Legislature|Legislature]] to increase [[K–12 (education)|K–12]] funding.<ref>[http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:KCSB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10AE02FF717CB785&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=102A487387FF6ECA Passions cool as session looms – Few legislators say they'd defy court] ''Kansas City Star'' June 20, 2005 retrieved June 5, 2008</ref> Sebelius offered one education funding plan early in her first term, which consisted of property, sales, and income tax increases, resulting in 2006 in the largest K–12 education funding increase in the history of the state. The three-year plan aimed to increase education funding by nearly $1 billion over three years, but did not give a funding source for the second and third years.

===Environment===
Sebelius chaired the Governors' Ethanol Coalition. In 2006 she requested that $200 million be allotted from the US government to support the Department of Energy Biomass and Biorefinery Systems Research and Development Program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ethanol-gec.org/speeches/House-Approps-Committee-Testimony8-06.htm|title=Testimony of Kathleen Sebelius before the House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee in Support of FY'07 Department of Energy Funding for Biofuels |access-date=July 6, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706192733/http://www.ethanol-gec.org/speeches/House-Approps-Committee-Testimony8-06.htm|archive-date=July 6, 2007}}. March 28, 2006</ref> She pushed for more widespread [[recycling]] efforts across the state.<ref>{{cite news|title=State Agency 'Green Teams' Focus on Recycling and Waste Reduction|date=March 4, 2008 |publisher=WIBW-TV|url=http://www.wibw.com/home/headlines/16243827.html}}</ref> In addition, she vetoed bills authorizing the construction of coal-fired power plants on three separate occasions<ref>{{cite news|title=Sebelius vetoes coal plant bill|date=May 16, 2008|publisher=[[Kansas City Star]]|url=http://www.kansascity.com/115/story/623830.html}}</ref> saying in March 2008, "We know that [[greenhouse gas]]es contribute to [[climate change]]. As an agricultural state, Kansas is particularly vulnerable. Therefore, reducing pollutants benefits our state not only in the short term — but also for generations of Kansans to come."<ref>[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/mar2008/2008-03-21-01.asp Kansas Governor Rejects Two Coal-Fired Power Plants]. Ens-newswire.com. Retrieved on February 11, 2012.</ref> On June 2, 2008, Sebelius spoke at the [[American Wind Energy Association]] Conference, calling for greater federal support for [[wind energy]] and other [[renewable energy]] resources.<ref>[http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2008/jun/02/sebelius_calls_feds_step_development_wind_energy/ LJWorld.com / Sebelius calls on feds to step up development of wind energy]. .ljworld.com (June 2, 2008). Retrieved on 2012-02-11.</ref>

As Health and Human Services Secretary, Sebelius will have a role in the development of regulations governing hydraulic fracturing. President Obama issued an executive order enabling the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to participate in an Interagency Working Group charged with helping to develop practical, economical state and federal public health and environmental standards related to natural gas production.<ref name="exam11302012">{{cite news|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/lawmakers-fear-kathleen-sebelius-taking-aim-at-natural-gas-boom/article/2514802#.ULof54biJF8|title=Lawmakers fear Kathleen Sebelius taking aim at natural gas boom|author=Staff |date=November 30, 2012|work=Beltway Confidential|publisher=The Examiner|access-date=December 1, 2012}}</ref>

===Firearms===
[[File:Health Care Fraud Press Conference.jpg|thumb|Sebelius and [[Eric Holder]]]]
Sebelius has said she supports Kansans' right to own firearms, but does not believe a broad [[concealed carry|concealed carry law]] would make them safer: "I don't believe allowing people to carry concealed handguns into sporting events, shopping malls, grocery stores, or the workplace would be good public policy. And to me the likelihood of exposing children to loaded handguns in their parents' purses, pockets and automobiles is simply unacceptable."<ref>{{cite news|title=Sebelius vetoes concealed carry bill |date=April 16, 2004|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2004/apr/16/sebelius_vetoes_concealed/}}</ref>

Sebelius vetoed, like her Republican predecessor [[Bill Graves]], a concealed-carry law that would have allowed citizens to carry concealed weapons after obtaining a state permit and passing an [[FBI]] background check.<ref>[[USA Today]] (2005). [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-04-16-concealed-guns_x.htm Kansas governor vetoes concealed weapons bill]. Retrieved June 14, 2007.</ref> The veto left Kansas, at the time, as one of four states without any form of a conceal-carry law.

On March 21, 2006, she vetoed Senate Bill 418, a similar concealed-carry bill. On March 25, her veto was overturned after the [[Kansas House of Representatives]] voted 91–33 to override it. This followed the [[Kansas Senate]]'s 30-10 override vote, which occurred the day after her veto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesskansas.org/ksag/Concealed_Weapon/Weapon.htm|title=Kansas Concealed Weapon |access-date=April 25, 2006|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602222150/http://www.accesskansas.org/ksag/Concealed_Weapon/Weapon.htm |archive-date=June 2, 2006}}. Retrieved June 2, 2006.</ref>

On April 21, 2008, Sebelius signed Senate Bill 46 into law, which repealed a 1933 state law prohibiting civilian ownership of [[machine gun]]s and other firearms restricted by the [[National Firearms Act]] of 1934, specifically permitting ownership by civilians successfully meeting the requirements of the NFA. The law was passed in part to address legal issues that could have prevented dealers from delivering firearms to law enforcement agencies in Kansas. The law took effect on July 1, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sebelius signs machine gun bill|date=April 22, 2008|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.nbcactionnews.com/content/news/kansas/story.aspx?content_id=94c7bb5a-b5d0-43d1-badf-94b760c4984b}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===LGBT issues===
Sebelius did not support an [[Kansas Amendment 1|April 2005 amendment]] to the [[Kansas Constitution]] that made [[same-sex marriage]] in the state unconstitutional. Sebelius said she supported the existing state law outlawing same-sex marriage, viewing it as sufficient,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/04/06/kansans_vote_to_ban_same_sex_marriage |title=Sebelius on gay marriage|publisher=Boston Globe|date=April 6, 2008|access-date=June 5, 2005|first1=John|last1=Hanna}}</ref> and therefore opposed the constitutional amendment. The amendment passed with 70% voter approval.

==Subsequent career==
After leaving the Obama cabinet, Sebelius founded and became CEO of Sebelius Resources LLC, which provides strategic advice to private companies, non-profit organizations, higher education institutions, and financial investors.

Sebelius serves as a member of the boards of directors of companies including [[Dermira Inc.]], [[Grand Rounds, Inc.]], Exact Sciences, and [[Humacyte Inc.]], and of the Estee Lauder Foundation and the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]]. In 1978, she was elected to the [[Common Cause]] National Governing Board. She serves on advisory boards for the [[Dole Institute of Politics]] and Solera Health. Sebelius is a senior advisor to Out Leadership and the [[Aspen Institute]], where she co-chairs the Aspen Health Strategy Group. Sebelius is a frequent keynote speaker for national and international organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sebeliusresources.com/welcome-1/|title=Bio|work=Sebelius Resources LLC|access-date=May 23, 2018}}</ref>
