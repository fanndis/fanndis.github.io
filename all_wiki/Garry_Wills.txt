'''Garry Wills''' (born May 22, 1934) is an American author, journalist, and historian, specializing in American history, politics, and religion, especially the [[history of the Catholic Church]]. He won a [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] in 1993.

Wills has written over fifty books and, since 1973, has been a frequent reviewer for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/authors/85 Author's page for Garry Wills] at the [[New York Review of Books]] website</ref> He became a faculty member of the history department at [[Northwestern University]] in 1980, where he is currently an [[Emeritus Professor]] of History.

==Early years==
Wills was born on May 22, 1934, in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref name="loa">Library of America.[http://reportingcivilrights.loa.org/authors/bio.jsp?authorId=157 Biography of Garry Wills] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605010422/http://reportingcivilrights.loa.org/authors/bio.jsp?authorId=157 |date=June 5, 2009 }}.</ref> His father, Jack Wills, was from a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] background, and his mother was from an [[Irish Catholic]] family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://events.nytimes.com/2002/07/14/books/chapters/0714-1st-wills.html|title=The Loyal Opposition|first=Jack|last=Miles|publisher=}}</ref> He was reared as Catholic and grew up in Michigan and Wisconsin, graduating in 1951 from [[Campion High School]], a Jesuit institution in [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]]. He entered and then left the [[Society of Jesus]].

Wills earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Saint Louis University]] in 1957 and a [[Master of Arts]] degree from [[Xavier University]] in 1958, both in philosophy. [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] hired him as a drama critic for ''[[National Review]]'' magazine at the age of 23. He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in [[classics]] from [[Yale University]] in 1961.<ref name="nm4h1998"/> He taught history at [[Johns Hopkins University]] from 1962 to 1980.

==Personal life==
Wills has been married to Natalie Cavallo since 1959; she was the flight attendant on his first flight on an airplane.<ref>[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/485 According to [[William F. Buckley]], as told on the [[Charlie Rose Show]] on March 24, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606131616/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/485 |date=June 6, 2012 }}</ref> They have three children: John, Garry, and Lydia.<ref name="nm4h1998"/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20081845,00.html | title=Garry Wills Dismantles Camelot and Finds Some Prisoners Within – Jack, Bob and Ted Kennedy | publisher = [[People magazine]] | date=April 5, 1982 | first=Linda | last=Witt}}</ref>

A trained [[classicist]], Wills is proficient in [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]]. His home in [[Evanston, Illinois]], is "filled with books", with a converted bedroom dedicated to English literature, another containing [[Latin literature]] and books on American political thought, one hallway full of books on economics and religion, "including four shelves on [[St. Augustine]]", and another with shelves of [[Greek literature]] and [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]].<ref name="nm4h1998"/><ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10052/1036942-148.stm | title=Non-fiction: "Bomb Power," by Garry Wills | newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date=February 21, 2010 | first=Bob | last=Hoover}}</ref>

==Religion==
Wills describes himself as a Roman Catholic and, with the exception of a period of doubt during his [[seminary]] years, has been a Roman Catholic all his life.<ref name="catholic">{{cite book|author=Garry Wills |title=Why I Am a Catholic |year=2003 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=0-618-38048-5}}</ref> He continues to attend [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] at the Sheil Catholic Center in [[Northwestern University]]. He prays the [[rosary]] every day, and wrote a book about the [[Catholic devotion|devotion]] (''The Rosary: Prayer Comes Around'') in 2005.<ref name="Allen">{{cite news| last=Allen | first=John L, Jr. | url= http://ncronline.org/news/people/poped-out-wills-seeks-broader-horizons | title='Poped out' Wills seeks broader horizons | newspaper=[[National Catholic Reporter]] | date=November 21, 2008}}</ref>

Wills has also been a critic of many aspects of [[history of the Catholic Church|church history]] and [[Catholic social teaching|church teaching]] since at least the early 1960s. He has been particularly critical of the doctrine of [[papal infallibility]]; the social teaching of the church regarding homosexuality, abortion, contraception, and the Eucharist; and of the church's reaction to the [[Catholic sex abuse cases|sex abuse scandal]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Garry Wills |title=Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit |url=https://archive.org/details/papalsin00garr |url-access=registration |year=2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Wills |first=Garry |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/religion/la-op-wills4nov04,0,2121538.story |title='Abortion isn't a religious issue' |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 4, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine| last=Wills | first=Garry | url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/feb/15/contraception-con-men/ | title = 'Contraception's Con Men' | magazine=[[New York Review of Books]] | date=February 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine| last=Wills | first=Garry | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2002/aug/15/the-bishops-at-bay/ | title = The Bishops at Bay | magazine=New York Review of Books | date=August 15, 2002}}</ref>

In 1961, in a phone conversation with William F. Buckley Jr., Wills coined the famous [[macaronic]] phrase ''[[Mater si, magistra no]]'' (literally "mother yes, teacher no").<ref name="catholic"/> The phrase, which was a response to the [[papal encyclical]] ''[[Mater et magistra]]'' and a reference to the then-current [[anti-Castro]] slogan "Cuba sí, Castro no", signifies a devotion to the faith and tradition of the church combined with a skeptical attitude towards [[ecclesiastical authority]].<ref name="Allen"/>

Wills published a full-length analysis of the contemporary Catholic Church, ''Bare Ruined Choirs'', in 1972 and a full-scale criticism of the historical and contemporary church, ''Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit'', in 2000. He followed up the latter with a sequel, ''Why I Am a Catholic'' (2002), as well as with the books ''What Jesus Meant'' (2006), ''What Paul Meant'' (2006), and ''What the Gospels Meant'' (2008).

==Politics==
Wills began his career as an early protégé of William F. Buckley Jr. and was associated with [[conservatism]]. When he first became involved with ''[[National Review]]'' he did not know if he was a conservative, calling himself a [[distributism|distributist]].<ref>{{cite book|title=William F. Buckley, Jr.: Patron Saint of the Conservatives|author=John B. Judis|year=1990|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=0-671-69593-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/williamfbuckleyj00john/page/158 158]|quote=Wills&nbsp;... did not know whether he was a conservative (he called himself a 'distributionist')|url=https://archive.org/details/williamfbuckleyj00john/page/158}}</ref> Later on, he was self-admittedly conservative, being regarded for a time as the "token conservative" for the ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'' and writing a book entitled ''Confessions of a Conservative''.<ref name="Allen"/>

However, during the 1960s and 1970s, driven by his coverage of both [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]] and the [[anti-Vietnam War movement]]s, Wills became increasingly liberal. His biography of president [[Richard M. Nixon]], ''Nixon Agonistes'' (1970) landed him on the [[master list of Nixon political opponents]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enemieslist.info/enemy.php?ID=wills&submit=Search|title=Nixon's Enemies List Search Results|website=www.enemieslist.info}}</ref> He supported [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], but declared two years later that Obama's presidency had been a "terrible disappointment".<ref>{{cite news |last=Kurutz |first=Steven |url= https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/10/20/garry-wills-on-bill-buckley-obamas-failures-and-the-tea-party-circus/ |title='Garry Wills on Obama 'Disappointment' and the Tea Party 'Zoo' |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=October 20, 2010}}</ref>

In 1995, Wills wrote an article about the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. It was originally entitled "Why We Have No Right to Bear Arms", but that was not Wills' conclusion. He neither wrote the title nor approved it prior to the article's publication.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1995/nov/16/to-keep-and-bear-arms-an-exchange/ |title='To Keep and Bear Arms: An Exchange' |magazine=[[New York Review of Books]] | quote= 'I had no knowledge of the misleading cover title "Why We Have No Right to Bear Arms" before I read with dismay the printed issue. Of course the Amendment states a right that "we" do possess—but we possess it, as the Amendment itself says, in a "[[well-regulated militia]]." |date=November 16, 1995}}</ref> Instead, Wills argued that the Second Amendment refers to the [[right to keep and bear arms]] in a military context only, rather than justifying private ownership and use of guns. Furthermore, he said the military context did not entail the right of individuals to overthrow the government of the United States:

{{cquote
|quote = The Standard Model finds, squirrelled away in the Second Amendment, not only a private right to own guns for any purpose but a public right to oppose with arms the government of the United States. It grounds this claim in the right of [[insurrection]], which clearly does exist whenever tyranny exists. Yet the right to ''overthrow'' the government is not given by government. It arises when government no longer has any [[legitimacy (political)|authority]]. One cannot say one rebels by right of that nonexistent authority. Modern militias say the government itself instructs them to overthrow government—and wacky scholars endorse this view. They think the Constitution is so deranged a document that it brands as the greatest crime a war upon itself (in [[Article III of the Constitution of the United States|Article III]]: '[[Treason laws in the United States|Treason against the United States]] shall consist only in levying war against them . . .') and then instructs its citizens to take this up (in the Second Amendment). According to this doctrine, a [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution#Meaning of "well regulated militia"|well-regulated group]] is meant to overthrow its own regulator, and a soldier swearing to obey orders is disqualified from true militia virtue.

==Public appraisal==
''[[The New York Times]]'' literary critic [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]] said in 1970 that Wills "reads like a combination of [[H. L. Mencken]], [[John Locke]] and [[Albert Camus]]."<ref>{{cite news| last=Leonard| first=John| authorlink=John Leonard (critic) | title=Books of the Times: Mr. Nixon as the Last Liberal| work= Review of Nixon Agonistes | url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/01/reviews/wills-nixon.html | publisher=The New York Times| date= October 15, 1970}}</ref> The Roman Catholic journalist [[John L. Allen Jr.]] considers Wills to be "perhaps the most distinguished Catholic intellectual in America over the last 50 years" ({{as of|2008|lc=y}}).<ref name="Allen"/> [[Martin Gardner]] in "The Strange Case of Garry Wills" states there is a "mystery and strangeness that hovers like a gray fog over everything Wills has written about his faith".<ref name="Gardner">{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Martin |title=Are Universes Thicker Than Blackberries? |publisher=W.W.
