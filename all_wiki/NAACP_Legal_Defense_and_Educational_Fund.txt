The '''NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.''' ('''NAACP LDF''' or '''LDF''') is a leading [[United States]] [[civil rights]] organization and law firm based in [[New York City]].

The organization can trace its origins to the legal department of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] that was created by [[Charles Hamilton Houston]] in the 1930s.<ref name=LDF@70>{{Cite web| title = LDF@70: 70 Years of Fulfilling the Promise of Equality | accessdate = 2010-11-19| url = http://naacpldf.org/files/publications/ldf@70_0.pdf}}</ref><ref name=NAACPvLDF>{{Cite web| title = NAACP v.

==Creation and separation from the NAACP==

The board of directors of the NAACP created the Legal Defense Fund in 1940 specifically for tax  purposes.<ref name=fjc>{{Cite web
| title = Biographies: NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., Teaching Judicial History, fjc.gov| url = https://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/tu_bush_bio_naacp.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140221175754/https://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/tu_bush_bio_naacp.html| url-status = dead| archive-date = 2014-02-21}}</ref> In 1957, LDF was completely separated from the NAACP and given its own independent board and staff.<ref name="fjc" /> Although LDF was originally meant to operate in accordance with NAACP policy, after 1961, serious disputes emerged between the two organizations. These disputes ultimately led the NAACP to create its own internal legal department while LDF continued to operate and score significant legal victories as an independent organization.<ref name="NAACPvLDF" /><ref name="Hooks 1979">Hooks (1979)</ref>

At times, this separation has created considerable confusion in the eyes and minds of the public.<ref name="Hooks 1979"/>  In the 1980s, the NAACP unsuccessfully sued LDF for trademark infringement.<ref name="NAACPvLDF" /> In its ruling rejecting the NAACP’s lawsuit, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]] recognized that the "universal esteem in which the [NAACP] initials are held is due in significant measure to [LDF's] distinguished record as a civil rights litigator" and that "the Association benefitted from the added luster given to the NAACP initials by the LDF's litigation successes."<ref name="NAACPvLDF" />

==Well-known cases==
Probably the most famous case in the history of LDF was ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the [[landmark case]] in 1954 in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] explicitly outlawed ''[[de jure]]'' [[racial segregation]] of [[public education]] facilities.

* '''1986''': ''[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County Commission]]'': a [[United States District Court|district court]] ordered over 180 of the local government bodies in counties, cities, and school boards in Alabama to change their methods of election because intentionally racially discriminatory state laws had made it extremely difficult for Black voters to elect their preferred candidates to local office.<ref>http://www.naacpldf.org/files/our-work/Alabama-Timeline-2-Black-History-1.pdf</ref>
