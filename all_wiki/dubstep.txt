'''Dubstep''' is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] that originated in [[South London]] in the late 1990s. It is generally characterised by sparse, [[syncopation|syncopated]] rhythmic [[Drum pattern|patterns]] with prominent [[sub-bass]] frequencies. The style emerged as an offshoot of [[UK garage]], drawing on a lineage of related styles such as [[2-step garage|2-step]] and [[dub reggae]], as well as [[jungle music|jungle]], [[broken beat]], and [[grime (music genre)|grime]].<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/style/dubstep-ma0000004465 AllMusic - Dubstep] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6tihOj6Ym?url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/dubstep-ma0000004465 |date=24 September 2017 }} "Absorbed and transfigured elements of techno, drum'n' bass and dub"</ref><ref name="Reynolds">Reynolds, S.(2012),''Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture,'' Perseus Books; Reprint edition (5 January 2012), pages&nbsp;511–516, ({{ISBN|978-1-59376-407-4}}).</ref> In the United Kingdom, the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the Jamaican [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]] party scene in the early 1980s.<ref name="Reynolds" /><ref>[http://uncarved.org/dub/splash/ The Big Big Sound System Splashdown] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509053430/http://uncarved.org/dub/splash/ |date=9 May 2012 }}, [[New Musical Express]], 21 February 1981, {{ISSN|0028-6362}}.</ref>

The earliest dubstep releases date back to 1998. In 2001, this sound and other strains of garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the "Forward" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), and on the [[UK pirate radio|pirate radio]] station [[Rinse FM]], which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term "dubstep" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in these remixes became more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and [[Grime music|grime]].<ref>IMO Records [http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ "Hatcha Biography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122021/http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ |date=12 January 2012 }}, ''[[IMO Records]]'', London, 17 October 2011.

A very early supporter of the sound was [[BBC Radio&nbsp;1]] DJ [[John Peel]], who started playing it from 2003 onwards. In 2004, the last year of his show, his listeners voted [[Distance (musician)|Distance]], [[Digital Mystikz]], and [[Plastician]] in their top 50 for the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/festive50s/2000s/2004 |title=Keeping It Peel: Festive 50s – 2004 |work=[[BBC Radio One]] |publisher=BBC |accessdate=31 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926082859/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/festive50s/2000s/2004/ |archive-date=26 September 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Dubstep started to enter mainstream [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British popular culture]] when it spread beyond small local scenes in late 2005 and early 2006; many websites devoted to the genre appeared on the [[Internet]] and aided the growth of the scene, such as dubstepforum, the download site Barefiles and blogs such as gutterbreakz.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Bubble+and+squeak%3a+Michael+Wilson+on+dubstep.-a0165312289 |title=Bubble and Squeak: Michael Wilson on Dubstep |last=Wilson |first=Michael |work=Artforum International |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513003423/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Bubble+and+squeak%3a+Michael+Wilson+on+dubstep.-a0165312289 |archive-date=13 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Simultaneously, the genre was receiving extensive coverage in music magazines such as ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' and online publications such as [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]], with a regular feature entitled ''The Month In: Grime/Dubstep''. Interest in dubstep grew significantly after BBC Radio 1 DJ [[Mary Anne Hobbs]] started championing the genre, beginning with a show devoted to it (entitled "Dubstep Warz") in January 2006.<ref name="teleg">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3655896/Put-a-bit-of-dub-in-your-step.html |title=Put a Bit of Dub in Your Step |last=de Wilde |first=Gervase |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=14 October 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604113804/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3655896/Put-a-bit-of-dub-in-your-step.html |archive-date=4 June 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Time1">{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/music/features/2083/3.html |title=Dubstep |last=O'Connell |first=Sharon |work=[[Time Out London]] |publisher=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out Group]] |date=4 October 2006 |accessdate=21 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729235605/http://www.timeout.com/london/music/features/2083/3.html |archive-date=29 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Pitch1">{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/features/grime-dubstep/6486-grime-dubstep|title=The Year in Grime and Dubstep |last=Clark |first=Martin |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=16 November 2006 |accessdate=21 June 2007}}</ref>

Towards the end of the 2000s and into the early 2010s, the genre started to become more commercially successful in the UK, with more singles and remixes entering the music charts. Music journalists and critics also noticed a dubstep influence in several pop artists' work. Around this time, producers also began to fuse elements of the original dubstep sound with other influences, creating fusion genres including [[future garage]] and the slower and more experimental [[post-dubstep]]. The harsher [[electro-house]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]-influenced variant [[brostep]], led by American producers such as [[Skrillex]], greatly contributed to dubstep's popularity in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theedgesusu.co.uk/features/2012/01/03/dubstep-how-has-it-become-so-popular|title=Dubstep: How Has It Become So Popular?|author=Joe Moor|work=The Edge|access-date=7 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714223341/http://www.theedgesusu.co.uk/features/2012/01/03/dubstep-how-has-it-become-so-popular/|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Dubstep's early roots are in the more experimental releases of UK garage producers, seeking to incorporate elements of [[drum and bass]] into the [[2-step garage]] sound. These experiments often ended up on the B-side of a [[white label]] or commercial garage release.<ref name="teleg" /><ref name="wire279">{{cite journal |title=The Primer: Dubstep |journal=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] |date=April 2011 |issue=279 |issn=0952-0686}}</ref><ref name="plastician">{{cite web |url=http://www.riddim.ca/?p=76 |title=Interview: Plasticman |author=Pearsall |publisher=Riddim.ca |date=18 June 2005 |accessdate=31 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609155542/http://www.riddim.ca/?p=76 |archive-date=9 June 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Dubstep is generally [[instrumental music|instrumental]].

=== Rhythm ===
Dubstep [[rhythm]]s are usually [[syncopation|syncopated]], and often [[swung note|shuffled]] or incorporating [[tuplet]]s. The tempo is nearly always in the range of 138–142 [[beats per minute]], with a clap or snare usually inserted every third beat in a bar.<ref name="cbc" /> In its early stages, dubstep was often more percussive, with more influences from two‑step drum patterns. Many producers were also experimenting with tribal drum samples, such as [[Loefah|Loefah's]] early release "Truly Dread" and Mala's "Anti-War Dub".

In an ''Invisible Jukebox'' interview with ''The Wire'', [[Kode9]] commented on a [[MRK1]] track, observing that listeners "have internalized the double-time rhythm" and the "track is so empty it makes [the listener] nervous, and you almost fill in the double time yourself, physically, to compensate".<ref name="Wire269">{{cite journal |title=Invisible Jukebox |journal=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] |date=July 2006 |issue=269 |issn=0952-0686}}</ref>

=== Wobble bass ===
One characteristic of certain strands of dubstep is the wobble [[Bass music|bass]], often referred to as the "wub", where an extended bass note is manipulated rhythmically. This style of bass is typically produced by using a [[low-frequency oscillator]] to manipulate certain parameters of a synthesiser such as [[sound pressure|volume]], [[Distortion pedal#Physics of clipping|distortion]] or [[filter cutoff]].  The resulting sound is a [[timbre]] that is punctuated by rhythmic variations in volume, filter cutoff, or distortion. This style of bass is a driving factor in some variations of dubstep, particularly at the more club-friendly end of the spectrum.<ref name="Wobble">{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/grime-dubstep/7728-grime-dubstep |title=The Year in Grime / Dubstep: The Year in Dubstep, Grime, and Funky 2009 |last=Clark |first=Martin |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=6 November 2009 |accessdate=1 April 2011 |quote=No summary of the year in dubstep would be complete without the ever-expanding wobble side of the scene, recently hilariously and accurately renamed "brostep".

=== Structure, bass drops, rewinds, and MCs ===
Originally, dubstep releases had some [[song structure (popular music)|structural]] similarities to other genres like [[drum and bass]] and UK garage. Typically this would comprise an [[introduction (music)|intro]], a main section (often incorporating a [[bass drop]]), a [[bridge (music)|midsection]], a second main section similar to the first (often with another drop), and an [[Conclusion (music)|outro]].

Many early dubstep tracks incorporate one or more "bass drops", a characteristic inherited from drum and bass. Typically, the percussion will pause, often reducing the track to silence, and then resume with more intensity, accompanied by a dominant sub-bass (often passing [[portamento]] through an entire [[octave]] or more, as in the audio example). It is very common for the bass to drop at or very close to 55&nbsp;seconds into the song, because 55&nbsp;seconds is just over 32&nbsp;measures at the common tempo of 140&nbsp;bpm. However, this (or the existence of a bass drop in general) is by no means a completely rigid characteristic, rather a trope; a large portion of seminal tunes from producers like [[Kode9]] and [[Horsepower Productions]] have more experimental song structures which do not rely on a drop for a dynamic peak – and in some instances do not feature a bass drop at all.

Rewinds (or reloads)<ref name="Nice1">{{cite web |url=http://www.getdarker.com/?id=5&fid=7&tid=53 |title=Interview: Joe Nice |work=GetDarker |date=15 August 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002740/http://www.getdarker.com/?id=5&fid=7&tid=53 |archivedate=28 September 2007}}</ref> are another technique used by dubstep DJs. If a song seems to be especially popular, the DJ will "spin back" the record by hand without lifting the stylus, and play the track in question again. Rewinds are also an important live element in many of dubstep's precursors; the technique originates in dub [[reggae]] [[Sound system (DJ)|soundsystems]], is widely employed by pirate radio stations and is also used at UK garage and jungle nights.<ref name="Clark4">{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/37340-column-the-month-in-grime-dubstep |title=The Month In: Grime/Dubstep |last=Clark |first=Martin |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=14 July 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113180757/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/37340-column-the-month-in-grime-dubstep|archivedate=13 January 2009}}</ref>

Taking direct cues from [[Music of Jamaica|Jamaica]]'s lyrically sparse [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejay and toasting]] mic styles in the vein of reggae pioneers like [[U-Roy]], the MC's role in dubstep's live experience is critically important to its impact.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2006/09/low-end-theory |title=Low End Theory: Dubstep Merchants |last=Earp |first=Matt |work=[[XLR8R]] |publisher=Amalgam Media |date=30 August 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522042351/http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2006/09/low-end-theory |archivedate=22 May 2011}}</ref>

A track by Skream also featured in the second series of the teen drama ''[[Skins (UK TV series)|Skins]]'', which also aired on Channel 4 in early 2008.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/introducing/2010/02/how_to_get_your_music_on_skins.shtml Q&A with Kyle Lynd - How to get your music on Skins] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915174201/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/introducing/2010/02/how_to_get_your_music_on_skins.shtml |date=15 September 2018 }}, BBC Introducing blog, 10-Feb-2010</ref>

As the genre has spread to become an international rather than UK-centric scene, it has also seen a number of women making headway into the scene in a variety of ways. Alongside Soulja of Ammunition Promotions and Mary Anne Hobbs, an influx of female producers, writers, photographers and DJs all have broken through in the up-til-then male orientated scene. With key 12" releases on [[Hyperdub]], Immigrant and Hotflush Recordings, producers [[Vaccine (musician)|Vaccine]], Subeena and [[Ikonika]] have introduced a palette of new sounds and influences to the genre, such as double-time bass drums, [[chiptune|8-bit]] [[Video game music|video game samples]], hand percussion and lushly arranged strings.<ref name="timeoutlondon">{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/clubs/features/5005/Women_in_dubstep.html |title=Women in dubstep – Time Out London |publisher=Timeout.com |accessdate=5 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413025740/http://www.timeout.com/london/clubs/features/5005/Women_in_dubstep.html |archive-date=13 April 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Mary Anne Hobbs commented that, unlike "Grime and drum 'n' bass raves, the mood at dubstep nights is less aggressive, or more meditative, leading to a larger female attendance at events than with the genre's precursors.

The influence of dubstep on more commercial or popular genres can be identified as far back as 2007, with artists such as [[Britney Spears]] using dubstep sounds; critics observed a dubstep influence in the song "Freakshow", from the 2007 album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'', which Tom Ewing described as "built around the 'wobbler' effect that's a genre standby."<ref name="ewing">{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Ewing |title=Column: Poptimist #10: Britney in the Black Lodge (Damn Fine Album)|date=20 November 2007 |url =http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/47096-column-poptimist-10 |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |accessdate =21 November 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213013728/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/47096-column-poptimist-10 <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=13 December 2007}}</ref><ref name="oc">{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Segal |title=Have You Heard of This Britney Spears Chick? |date=6 November 2007 |publisher=[[Village Voice Media]] |url=http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/new-releases/have-you-heard-of-this-britney |work=Heard Mentality:The [[OC Weekly]] Music Blog |accessdate=21 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109111914/http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/new-releases/have-you-heard-of-this-britney/ |archivedate=9 November 2007}}</ref> [[Benga (musician)|Benga]] and Coki's single "Night" still continued to be a popular track on the UK dance chart more than a year after its release in late 2007, still ranking in the top five at the start of April 2008 on [[Pete Tong]]'s [[BBC Radio 1]] dance chart list.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/dancesingles.shtml |title=Radio 1 – BBC Radio 1's Chart Show with Reggie Yates – UK Top 40 Dance Singles |publisher=BBC |date=24 February 2007 |accessdate=11 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422050437/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/dancesingles.shtml |archive-date=22 April 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

However, the year 2009 saw the dubstep sound gaining further worldwide recognition, often through the assimilation of elements of the sound into other genres, in a manner similar to drum and bass before it. At the start of the year, UK electronic duo [[La Roux]] put their single "[[In for the Kill (song)|In for the Kill]]" in the remix hands of [[Skream]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/15/la-roux-in-for-kill | title=Electronic review: La Roux, In For the Kill (Skream remix) &#124; Music | work=The Observer | accessdate=11 November 2009 | location=London | date=15 March 2009 | first=Gareth | last=Grundy | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195227/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/15/la-roux-in-for-kill | archive-date=10 September 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefader.com/articles/2009/4/14/freeload-la-roux-in-for-the-kill-skream-s-let-s-get-ravey-remix |title=Freeload: La Roux, "In for the Kill (Skream's Let's Get Ravey Remix) " The FADER |publisher=Thefader.com |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=11 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417051341/http://www.thefader.com/articles/2009/4/14/freeload-la-roux-in-for-the-kill-skream-s-let-s-get-ravey-remix |archive-date=17 April 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> They then gave remix duties of "[[I'm Not Your Toy]]" to [[Nero (Musicians)|Nero]] and then again with their single "[[Bulletproof (La Roux song)|Bulletproof]]" being remixed by [[DJ Zinc|Zinc]].

Commenting on the success of American producers such as Skrillex, Skream stated: "I think it hurts a lot of people over here because it's a UK sound, but it's been someone with influences outside the original sound that has made it a lot bigger. The bad side of that is that a lot of people will just say 'dubstep equals Skrillex'. But in all honesty it genuinely doesn't bother me.

==== 2012–2013: Riddim ====
{{Main|Riddim (EDM)}}
In the early 2010s, UK artists began to play with a style of dubstep reminiscent of a resurgence or continuation of original British dubstep styles. This became known as [[Riddim (EDM)|Riddim]], a name coined by British producer Jakes around 2012. The name comes from the [[Jamaican Patois]] term ''[[riddim]]'', which refers to the instrumental of [[Dub music|dub]], [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] music.<ref name=":2" /> Riddim is characterised by repetitive and minimalist sub-bass and triplet percussion arrangements, similar to original dubstep, with a sound described as "wonky".<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.insomniac.com/magazine/how-to-talk-to-your-kids-about-riddim/|title=How to Talk to Your Kids About Riddim {{!}} Insomniac|website=[[Insomniac (promoter)|Insomniac]]|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430230345/https://www.insomniac.com/magazine/how-to-talk-to-your-kids-about-riddim/|archive-date=2019-04-30|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://iedm.com/blogs/onblast-edm-blog/what-is-this-riddim-everyone-keeps-talking-about|title=What is this Riddim Everyone Keeps Talking About?|website=iedm.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426194123/https://iedm.com/blogs/onblast-edm-blog/what-is-this-riddim-everyone-keeps-talking-about|archive-date=2019-04-26|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> Riddim is looked upon as a subgenre of dubstep, similarly to other sub genres like bro-step, drum-step, and wobble-step.<ref name=":2" /> It started gaining significant popularity around 2015.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://edmidentity.com/2018/03/25/what-we-like-riddim/|title=What We Like {{!}}{{!}} Riddim|last=Ullah-Blocks|first=Jayce|date=2018-03-25|website=EDM Identity|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501100432/https://edmidentity.com/2018/03/25/what-we-like-riddim/|archive-date=2019-05-01|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref> It is said that those who enjoy this style of music describe it as the "dirtier, swaggier" side of dubstep, whereas those looking at this from the outside, claim that it is "repetitive and chaotic".<ref name=":2" /> Notable artists of the genre include Subfiltronik, Bukez Finezt, P0gman, Badklaat, 50 Carrot, Dubloadz and Coffi.<ref>{{cite news|last=Conte|first=Chris|url=http://www.theuntz.com/news/the-rise-of-riddim-whats-this-latest-bass-craze-all-about/|title=The Rise of Riddim: What's this latest bass craze all about?|date=30 March 2017|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref> Notable tracks of the genre include "Yasuo" by Bommer and Crowell, "Orgalorg" by Infekt, and "Jotaro" by Phiso.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmsauce.com/2017/03/08/best-riddim-dubstep-songs/|title=30 Best Riddim Songs of All Time|last=Stevo|date=2017-03-08|website=EDM Sauce|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430230345/https://www.edmsauce.com/2017/03/08/best-riddim-dubstep-songs/|archive-date=2019-04-30|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> There have been controversial discussions over the topic of Riddim not being its own genre and that it is just dubstep.

Beginning in mid-2014, dubstep began to decline drastically in mainstream popularity, particularly in the United States, where many formerly successful dubstep artists became popular.
