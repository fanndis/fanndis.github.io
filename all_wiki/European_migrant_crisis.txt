The [[migrant crisis]] was part of a pattern of increased forced migration to Europe from other continents which is thought to have begun in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Gareth |title=Europe's migrant crisis: the year that changed a continent |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53925209 |website=BBC News}}</ref> At the peak of the crisis in 2015, The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) observed that the top three nationalities among over one million refugees arriving from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] were [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian]] (46.7%), [[Afghan refugees|Afghan]] (20.9%) and [[Refugees of Iraq|Iraqi]] (9.4%).<ref>{{cite journal|date=31 March 2016|title=Monthly Arrivals by Nationality to Greece, Italy and Spain|url=http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/documents.php?page=1&view=grid&Type%5B%5D=3&Search=%23monthly%23|journal=Refugees/Migrants Emergency Response – Mediterranean|access-date=14 May 2016}}</ref> By 2019, the number of displaced arrivals to the mediterranean had dropped to 129,663 people.<ref>{{cite web |title=Refugee Situations |url=http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean?page=1&view=grid&Type%255B%255D=3&Search=%2523monthly%2523%7cjournal=Refugees/Migrants |website=UNHCR Operational Portal |publisher=UNHCR}}</ref>

According to the [[UNHCR]], the EU countries with the biggest numbers of recognised refugees at the end of 2014 were France (252,264), Germany (216,973), Sweden (142,207) and the United Kingdom (117,161).<ref name="UNHCRtrends"/>

=== Migrant smuggling ===
{{See also|Timeline of the European migrant crisis|List of migrant vessel incidents on the Mediterranean Sea|List of migrant vehicle incidents in Europe}}
Several serious accidents and deaths occurred in Europe as a result of [[migrant smuggling]] since 1997: two in the Mediterranean Sea due to the [[capsizing]] of crowded and unseaworthy migrant smuggling vessels, and some on European soil due to the use of standard cargo trucks by smugglers to transport illegal migrants. The vast majority of deaths occurred while persons were being illegally smuggled across the Mediterranean and [[Aegean Sea]]s. More than 34,000 migrants and refugees have died trying to get to Europe since 1993.<ref>{{cite news |title=It's 34,361 and rising: how the List tallies Europe's migrant bodycount |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/20/the-list-europe-migrant-bodycount |work=The Guardian |date=20 June 2018}}</ref>

==Causes of increased number of asylum seekers==
According to the UNHCR World Migration Report 2020, two of the main drivers for the increased displacement of people are disasters and conflict.<ref name=IOFM>{{cite news |last1=Staff |title=WORLD MIGRATION REPORT2020 |url=https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/wmr_2020.pdf |access-date=5 October 2020 |publisher=UN (International Organization for Migration) |date=2019}}</ref>{{Dubious |date=October 2020}}

===Escaping from natural disasters===
{{Expand section |date=October 2020}}
Some of the economic migration from West Africa originated from the consequences of land degradation due to climate change.<ref>{{cite news |title=Climate refugees account for more than a half of all migrants but enjoy little protection |url=https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/news-media/news/climate-refugees-account-more-half-all-migrants-enjoy-little-protection |access-date=7 October 2020 |work=European Economic and Social Committee |date=17 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

===Escaping from conflicts or persecution===
According to the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], most of the people who arrived in Europe in 2015 were [[refugees]] fleeing war and [[persecution]]<ref name="UNHCRarrivals" /> in countries such as [[Syria]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and [[Eritrea]]: 84 percent of Mediterranean Sea arrivals in 2015 came from the world's top ten refugee-producing countries.<ref name="UNHCRarrivals1">{{cite news|date=30 December 2015|title=Over one million sea arrivals reach Europe in 2015|work=UNHCR|url=http://www.unhcr.org/5683d0b56.html|access-date=28 December 2016}}</ref> Wars fueling the migrant crisis are the [[Syrian Civil War]], the [[Iraq conflict (2003–present)|Iraq War]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], the [[Somali Civil War (2009–present)|War in Somalia]] and the [[War in Darfur]].

==== Syria ====
The greatest number of refugees fleeing to Europe [[Syrian Arab Republic|originate from Syria]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War]] are citizens and permanent residents of Syria, who have fled their country over the course of the [[Syrian Civil War]] (begin:2011). Since the start of the [[Syrian Civil War]] in 2011 more than six million (2016) were [[Internally displaced person|internally displaced]], and around five million (2016) had crossed into other countries,<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.unocha.org/syria|title=UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 16_02_2016 }}</ref> with most seeking [[right of asylum|asylum]] or placed in [[Syrian refugee camps]] established in [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Turkey|Turkey]], [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Lebanon|Lebanon]], [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Jordan|Jordan]], [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Egypt|Egypt]], and EU. [[#Illegal border crossings by nationality|Detected illegal border crossings to the EU by Syrians]] was 78,887 in 2014, 594,059 in 2015, 88,551 in 2016, and 19,452 in 2017.

Syrians established diaspora in [[Syrians in Denmark|Denmark]], [[Syrians in Finland|Finland]], [[Syrians in Austria|Austria]],  [[Syrians in Germany|Germany]], [[Syrians in Greece|Greece]], [[Syrians in Norway|Norway]], [[Syrians in Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Syrians in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]. Their migration stems from severe socio-political oppression under [[Bashar al-Assad]]. Civil war ensued with clashes between pro and anti-government groups. In 2011, a group of pro-democracy Syrians protested in the city of [[Daraa]]. [[Bashar al-Assad|Al-Assad]] responded with force and consequently, more protests were triggered nationwide against the Assad regime. By July 2011, hundreds of thousands of people were protesting against President Assad. An early violent crackdown was enacted in an attempt to mitigate the uprisings, only to be met with more unrest. By [[Arab Spring|May 2011]], thousands of people had fled the country and the first refugee camps opened in Turkey. In March 2012, the UNHCR decided to appoint a Regional Refugee Coordinator for Syrian Refugees—recognising the growing concerns surrounding the crisis. Just a year later, in March 2013, the number of Syrian refugees reached 1,000,000. By December 2017, the UNHCR counted 1,000,000 asylum applications for Syrian refugees in the European Union. As of March 2018, UNHCR has counted nearly 5.6 million registered Syrian refugees worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/syria|title=Situation Syria Regional Refugee Response|website=data2.unhcr.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-17}}</ref>

====Afghanistan====
[[Afghan refugees]] constitute the second-largest refugee population in the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/afghanistan.html|title=Afghanistan|publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en}}</ref> According to the UNHCR, there are almost 2.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan. Most of these refugees fled the region due to war and persecution. The majority have resettled in Pakistan and Iran, though it became increasingly common to migrate further west to the European Union. Afghanistan faced over 40 years of conflict dating back to the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion in 1979]]. Since then, the nation faced fluctuating levels of [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]] amidst unending unrest. The increase in refugee numbers has been primarily attributed to the [[Taliban]] presence within Afghanistan. Their retreat in 2001 led to nearly 6 million Afghan refugees returning to their homeland. However, after [[Taliban insurgency|civil unrest and fighting alongside the Taliban's return]], nearly 2.5 million refugees fled Afghanistan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rescue.org/article/afghanistan-what-you-need-know-about-one-worlds-longest-refugee-crises|title=Afghanistan: What you need to know about one of the world's longest refugee crises|date=2016-09-08|work=International Rescue Committee (IRC)|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en}}</ref> Most Afghan refugees, however, seek refuge in the neighboring nation of Pakistan.

In 2016 the European Commission began reforming the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) which was initially designed to created a unified asylum system for the EU. In an attempt to create measures for safe and managed paths for legal migration to Europe, the European Commission created five components that sought to satisfy the minimum standards for asylum.<ref name=":03">{{Cite news|last=Raithel|first=Silvia|date=2016-02-09|title=The Common European Asylum System: Its History, Content, and Shortcomings – The Michigan Journal of International Law|language=en-US|work=The Michigan Journal of International Law|url=http://www.mjilonline.org/the-common-european-asylum-system-its-history-content-and-shortcomings/|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>

On 13 July 2016, the European Commission introduced the proposals to finalise the CEAS' reform. The reform sought to create a just policy for asylum seekers while providing a new system that was simple and shortened. Ultimately, the reform proposal attempted to create a system that could handle normal and impacted times of migratory pressure.<ref name=":22">{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2433_en.htm|title=European Commission – PRESS RELEASES – Press release – Completing the reform of the Common European Asylum System: towards an efficient, fair and humane asylum policy|website=europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>

The [[2013 Lampedusa migrant shipwreck]] involved "more than 360" deaths and led the Italian government to establish [[Operation Mare Nostrum]], a large-scale naval operation that involved [[search and rescue]], with migrants being brought aboard a naval [[amphibious assault ship]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marina.difesa.it/EN/operations/Pagine/MareNostrum.aspx |title=Mare Nostrum Operation |publisher=Marina Militare}}</ref> The Italian government ended the operation in 2014 amid an upsurge in the number of sea arrivals in Italy from Libya, citing the costs were too large for one EU state alone to manage; Frontex assumed the main responsibility for search and rescue operations under the name [[Operation Triton]].<ref name="European Commission">{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-566_en.htm |title=EC MEMO, Brussels, 7 October 2014, Frontex Joint Operation 'Triton' – Concerted efforts to manage migration in the Central Mediterranean |publisher=European Union, European Commission |access-date=15 April 2015}}</ref> The Italian government had requested additional funds from the EU to continue the operation but member states did not offer the requested support.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.vice.com/article/italy-is-about-to-shut-down-the-sea-rescue-operation-that-saved-more-than-90000-migrants-this-year |title=Italy Is About to Shut Down the Sea Rescue Operation That Saved More Than 90,000 Migrants This Year |work=[[Vice News]] |access-date=19 April 2015}}</ref> The UK government cited fears that the operation was acting as "an unintended 'pull factor', encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/27/uk-mediterranean-migrant-rescue-plan |title=UK axes support for Mediterranean migrant rescue operation |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=20 April 2015}}</ref> The operation consisted of two surveillance aircraft and three ships, with seven teams of staff who gathered intelligence and conducted screening/identification processing.

===Carriers' responsibility===

([[s:Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement|The Schengen acquis – Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement]])</ref> states that carriers which transport people who are refused into the Schengen area shall pay for both penalties and the return of the refused people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carrieri sanctions |url=http://www.ecre.org/topics/areas-of-work/access-to-europe/7-carrier-sanctions.html |publisher=[[European Council on Refugees and Exiles]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310200237/http://www.ecre.org/topics/areas-of-work/access-to-europe/7-carrier-sanctions.html |archive-date=10 March 2016 }}</ref> Further clauses on this topic are found in EU directive 2001/51/EC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:187:0045:0046:EN:PDF|title=COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2001/51/EC supplementing the provisions of Article 26 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement}}</ref> This prevented migrants without a visa from being allowed on aircraft, boats, or trains entering the Schengen Area, and caused them to resort to [[People smuggling|migrant smugglers]].<ref>[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/refugee-crisis-smugglers-offer-discount-refugees-willing-cross-bad-weather-1526441 Refugee crisis: Smugglers offer 'Bad weather discount' to migrants] (International Business Times, 25 October 2015)</ref> Humanitarian visas are generally not given to refugees who want to apply for asylum.<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/11/16/europes-refugee-crisis/agenda-action Europe's Refugee Crisis, An Agenda for Action] (Human Rights Watch, 16 November 2015)</ref>

The laws on [[migrant smuggling]] forbid helping migrants pass any national border if the migrants do not have permission to enter. This has caused many airlines to check for visas and refuse passage to migrants without visas, including through international flights inside the Schengen Area. After being refused air passage, many migrants attempted to travel overland to their destination country. According to a study carried out for the European Parliament, "penalties for carriers, who assume some of the control duties of the European police services, either block asylum-seekers far from Europe's borders or force them to pay more and take greater risks to travel illegally".<ref>{{cite web|title=Analysis of the external dimension of the EU's asylum and immigration policies|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2004_2009/documents/dt/619/619330/619330en.pdf|publisher=European Parliament}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actnownews.com/refugee-crisis/|title=Way to Future of the Refugee crisis|work=Act Now News|access-date=29 April 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114085750/http://actnownews.com/refugee-crisis/|archive-date=14 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

It has been argued that the official policy (at least in some countries like Sweden) of free right to apply for asylum, is counteracted by the Carriers' responsibility, forcing refugees to use an illegal  and dangerous route by using criminal smugglers, to exercise a right that many say should not be denied.<ref>[https://blog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2015/09/12/why-do-refugees-risk-the-deadly-boat-crossing-to-europe-its-the-law/ Why Do Refugees Risk the Deadly Boat Crossing to Europe? It’s the Law]</ref> A suggestion of humanitarian visas (refugees would be able to get an entry permission before travelling if have reason for asylum) has been turned down because of the number of people who would arrive.

On the paper the Carriers' responsibility law does not prevent the free right to asylum, because the penalty on airlines is not given if the person is actually granted asylum. But the airlines can't know who will be given asylum or not and do therefore block everyone without right to enter.

The [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM) and the UN refugee agency, [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] urged to disembark the more than four hundred rescued migrants and refugees rescued in the Central Mediterranean Sea on board three vessels. The IOM also emphasized on the need of a regional agreement for the safe disembarkation of migrants and refugees amid [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/08/1071332|title= UN agencies call for urgent disembarkation of hundreds rescued in the Mediterranean|access-date=29 August 2020|website=UN News}}</ref>

On 20 March 2016, an agreement between the [[European Union]] and [[Turkey]] was enacted to discourage migrants from making the dangerous sea journey from Turkey to [[Greece]]. Under its terms, migrants arriving in Greece would be sent back to Turkey if they did not apply for asylum or their claim was rejected, whilst the EU would send around 2,300 experts, including security and migration officials and translators, to Greece in order to help implement the deal.<ref name="bbc.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35854413|title=Migrant crisis: EU-Turkey deal comes into effect|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=21 March 2016|date=20 March 2016}}</ref>

It was also agreed upon that any irregular migrants who crossed into Greece from Turkey after 20 March 2016 would be sent back to Turkey based on an individual case-by-case evaluation.

====Changes in Schengen & Dublin====
{{Main|Dublin Regulation|Schengen Area}}
[[File:Map of the Schengen Area.svg|thumb|{{legend|#003399|The [[Schengen Area]]}}{{legend|#ffa500|European Union members legally obliged to join Schengen at a future date}}{{legend|#27a4bb|Countries with open borders}}]]
In the [[Schengen Agreement]] of 14 June 1985, 26 European countries (22 of the 28 [[European Union]] member states, plus four [[European Free Trade Association]] states) joined together to form an area where border checks were restricted to and enforced on the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external Schengen borders]] and countries with external borders. Countries may reinstate internal border controls for a maximum of two months for "public policy or national security" reasons.<ref>{{cite news|title=Schengen: Controversial EU free movement deal explained|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13194723|work=BBC News|date=14 September 2015}}</ref>

The Dublin Regulation determines the EU member state responsible to examine an [[right of asylum|asylum]] application and prevent asylum applicants in the EU from "[[asylum shopping]]"{{Em dash}}where applicants send their applications for asylum to numerous EU member states to get the best "deal" instead of just having "safety countries"{{Em dash}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/07/13/eu-floats-new-asylum-system-seeks-to-stop-asylum-shopping.html|title=EU floats new asylum system, seeks to stop 'asylum shopping'|date=13 July 2016}}</ref> or "asylum orbiting"{{Em dash}}where no member state takes responsibility for an asylum seeker. By default (when no family reasons or humanitarian grounds are present), the first member state that an asylum seeker entered and in which they have been fingerprinted is responsible. If the asylum seeker moves to another member state afterwards, they can be transferred back to the member state they first entered. This rule led many to criticise the Dublin Regulation for placing too much responsibility for asylum seekers on member states on the EU's external borders (like Italy, Greece, Croatia and Hungary), instead of devising a burden-sharing system among EU states.<ref>{{cite web|title=EU legal framework on asylum and irregular immigration 'on arrival'|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2015/551333/EPRS_BRI%282015%29551333_EN.pdf|publisher=European Parliamentary Research Service}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Asylum in the EU: Facts and Figures|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2015/551332/EPRS_BRI%282015%29551332_EN.pdf|publisher=European Parliamentary Research Service}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Dublin regulation leaves asylum seekers with their fingers burnt|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/07/dublin-regulation-european-asylum-seekers|work=The Guardian|date=7 October 2011}}</ref>

In June 2016, the Commission to the European Parliament and Council addressed "inherent weaknesses" in the Common European Asylum System and proposed reforms for the Dublin Regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/proposal-implementation-package/docs/20160406/towards_a_reform_of_the_common_european_asylum_system_and_enhancing_legal_avenues_to_europe_-_20160406_en.pdf|title=Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council|date=4 June 2016}}</ref> Under the initial Dublin Regulation, responsibility was concentrated on border states that received a large influx of asylum seekers. A briefing by the European Parliament explained that the Dublin Agreement was only designed to assign responsibility and not to effectively share responsibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2016/586639/EPRS_BRI(2016)586639_EN.pdf|title=EU Legislation in Process: Reform of the Dublin System}}</ref> The reforms would attempt to create a burden-sharing system through several mechanisms. The proposal would introduce a "centralised automated system" to record the number of asylum applications across the EU, with "national interfaces" within each of the Member States.<ref name=":02">{{cite web|url=http://www.statewatch.org/news/2017/feb/eprs-mgration-compendium.pdf|title=Addressing Migration in the European Union: Selected publications by the European Parliamentary Research Service}}</ref> It would also present a "reference key" based on a Member State's GDP and population size to determine its absorption capacity.<ref name=":02" /> When the absorption capacity in a Member State exceeded 150 percent of its reference share, a "fairness mechanism" would distribute the excess number of asylum seekers across less congested Member States.<ref name=":02" /> If a Member State chooses not to accept the asylum seekers, it would contribute €250,000 per application instead as a "solidarity contribution".<ref name=":02" /> The reforms have been discussed in European Parliament since its proposal in 2016, and was included in a meeting on "The Third Reform of the Common European Asylum System – Up for the Challenge" in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-towards-a-new-policy-on-migration/file-revision-of-the-dublin-regulation|title=Legislative train schedule {{!}} European Parliament|website=European Parliament|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>

As most asylum seekers try to reach Germany or Sweden through other EU member states, many of which form the borderless [[Schengen area]] where internal border controls are abolished, enforcing the Dublin Regulation became increasingly difficult in the late summer of 2015, with some countries allowing asylum seekers to transit through their territories, renouncing the right to return them, or reinstating border controls within the Schengen Area to prevent them from entering. In July 2017, the [[European Court of Justice]] upheld the Dublin Regulation, despite the high influx of 2015, and gave EU member states the right to deport migrants to the first country of entry to the EU.<ref name="telegraph26July2017">{{cite news|title=EU court rejects 'open-door' policy and upholds right of member states to deport refugees|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/26/eu-court-rejects-open-door-policy-upholds-right-member-states/|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 July 2017}}</ref>

According to the Czech interior minister [[Milan Chovanec]], from 2 September 2015, Czech Republic was offering asylum to every Syrian caught by the police notwithstanding the Dublin Regulation: out of about 1,300 apprehended until 9 September, only 60 decided to apply for asylum in the Czech Republic, with the rest of them continuing to Germany or elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/380081-nemuzeme-s-uprchliky-soupat-jako-s-dobytkem-odmitla-vlada-znovu-kvoty.html |title=Nemůžeme s uprchlíky šoupat jako s dobytkem, odmítla vláda znovu kvóty |date=9 September 2015 |publisher=Novinky.cz}}</ref>

On 22 September 2015, European Union interior ministers meeting in the [[Justice and Home Affairs Council]] approved a plan to relocate 120,000 asylum seekers over two years from the frontline states [[Italy]], [[Greece]] and [[Hungary]] to all other EU countries (except Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom which have [[Opt-outs in the European Union|opted out]]). The relocation plan applies to asylum seekers "in clear need of international protection" (those with a recognition rate higher than 75 percent, i.e., [[Syria]]ns, [[Eritrea]]ns and [[Iraq]]is) – 15,600 from Italy, 50,400 from Greece and 54,000 from Hungary – who will be distributed among EU states on the basis of quotas taking into account the size of the economy and population of each state, as well as the average number of asylum applications. The decision was made by majority vote, with the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]] and [[Slovakia]] voting against and [[Finland]] abstaining.

Because of the lack of water, medical care and security protection witnessed by the Euro- Med monitor team- especially with the arrival of winter, they were at risk of serious health deterioration. 1,500 refugees were moved into other places since their camps were deluged with snow, but relocation of the refugees always came too late after they lived without electricity and heating devices for too long. It showed that there was a lack of access to legal services and protection for the refugees and migrants in the camps; there was no trust between the residents and the protection offices. In addition, migrants were subject to regular xenophobic attacks, fascist violence, forced strip searches at the hands of residents and police, and detention. Women living in the Athens settlements and the [[Vasilika refugee camp|Vasilika]], [[Softex]] and [[Diavata]] camps felt worried about their children as they may be subjected to sexual abuse, trafficking and drug use. As a result, some of the refugees and migrants committed suicide, burned property and protested. The report clarified the difficulties the refugees face when entering into Greece; more than 16,000 people were trapped while awaiting deportation on the Greek islands of [[Lesbos]], [[Chios]], [[Samos]], [[Leros]] and [[Kos]], which is twice the capacity of the five islands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/1703/Asylum-seekers-attempt-suicide-daily-as-they-face-desperate-circumstances-in-Greece|title=Asylum seekers attempt suicide daily as they face desperate circumstances in Greece|last=Monitor|first=Euro-Med|newspaper=Euro-Mediterranean|language=en|access-date=29 January 2017}}</ref>

In August 2017 dozens of Afghan asylum seekers demonstrated in a square in Stockholm against their pending deportations. They were attacked by a group of 15–16 men who threw fireworks at them. Three protesters were injured and one was taken to hospital. No one was arrested.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gp.se/nyheter/sverige/strejkande-ensamkommande-attackerade-1.4515731|title=Strejkande ensamkommande attackerade|work=Göteborgs-Posten|access-date=10 August 2017|language=sv}}</ref>

====Support systems by local communities and NGOs====
There are a number of support systems that aid the integration of refugees and asylum seekers in their host country. [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], working with partners, is providing a broad range of support and assistance in Europe for refugees and asylum-seekers. These efforts include humanitarian and cash assistance, provision of accommodation and support to improve reception conditions, prevention and response to sexual and gender-based violence, protection monitoring and interventions, engaging with refugee communities to enhance their participation and including their voice in their voice in the response, identification and support to persons with specific needs, including separated and unaccompanied children, and referral to appropriate services.<ref name="UNHCR2">{{cite web |title=Redirect page |website=UNHCR |url=https://www.unhcr.org/uk/europe-emergency.html |language=fr |access-date=2020-10-05}}</ref> The Voice of Young Refugees in Europe<ref name="Voices of Young Refugees in Europe 2019">{{cite web |title=Voices of Young Refugees in Europe |website=Voices of Young Refugees in Europe |date=2019-11-13 |url=https://www.wearevyre.net |access-date=2020-10-05}}</ref> provide a support and educational network for young refugees.  Many refugees arrive in Europe with a great diversity of skills, experience and specialisations that could make tangible contributions to the EU workforce. In the UK, the [[Refugee Council]] organisation provides support and advice to refugees and asylum seekers. The Building Bridges Partnership in the UK was set up to support refugee health professionals re-qualify in the UK. Other organisations include Transitions, a social enterprise that provides advice and helps refugees find placements depending on their qualifications and skills.

According to the [[UNHCR]], the number of [[Displaced person|forcibly displaced people]] worldwide reached 59,500,000 by the end of 2014,<ref>{{cite news |title=The Global Refugee Crisis, Region by Region |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/09/world/migrants-global-refugee-crisis-mediterranean-ukraine-syria-rohingya-malaysia-iraq.html |work=The New York Times |date=26 August 2015}}</ref> with a 40 percent increase since 2011. Of these 59.5&nbsp;million, 19.5&nbsp;million were [[refugees]] (14.4&nbsp;million under UNHCR's mandate, plus 5.1&nbsp;million [[Palestinian refugees]] under [[UNRWA]]'s mandate) and 1.8&nbsp;million were [[asylum-seekers]]. The rest were persons displaced within their own countries ([[internally displaced persons]]). The refugees under UNHCR's mandate increased by approximately 2.7&nbsp;million (23%) compared to the end of 2013, the highest level since 1995. Among them, [[Syrian refugees]] became the largest refugee group in 2014 (3.9&nbsp;million, 1.55&nbsp;million more than the previous year), overtaking [[Afghan refugees]] (2.6&nbsp;million), who had been the largest refugee group for three decades. Six of the ten largest countries refugees originated from were African: [[Somalia]], [[Sudanese refugees|Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], the [[Central African Republic]], and [[Eritrea]].<ref name="UNHCRtrends">{{cite web |url=http://unhcr.org/556725e69.html |title=UNHCR Global Trends –Forced Displacement in 2014 |publisher=UNHCR |date=18 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The dispossessed|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/06/daily-chart-15|work=The Economist|date=18 June 2015}}</ref>

In 2016, the UNHCR reported the number of forcibly displaced people worldwide reached 65,600,000 at the end of 2016, the highest level since World War II. Of these 65,600,000, 22.5 million were refugees (17.2 million under UNHCR's mandate, plus 5.3 million Palestinian refugees under UNRWA's mandate), 2.8 million of which were asylum seekers. The rest were internally displaced persons. The 17.2 million refugees under UNHCR's mandate increased by 2.9 million compared to the end of 2014, and is the highest number of refugees since 1992.

As of 2017, 55 percent of refugees worldwide came from three nations: South Sudan, Afghanistan, and Syria. Of all displaced peoples, 17 percent of them are hosted in Europe. As of April 2018, 15,481 refugees successfully arrived in Europe via sea within the first few months of the year alone. There was an estimated 500 that have died. In 2015, there was a total of 1.02 million arrivals by sea. Since then, there is still an influx, albeit steadily decreasing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean#_ga=2.97327127.949908654.1523126683-1807715582.1519328261|title=Situation Mediterranean Situation|website=data2.unhcr.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref>

As of May 2017, [[Frontex]] (the European border and coast guard agency) identified the following eight main routes on sea and on land used by irregular migrants to enter the EU:<ref>{{cite web |title=Migratory routes map |url=http://frontex.europa.eu/trends-and-routes/migratory-routes-map/ |access-date=29 August 2015 |publisher=[[Frontex]]}}</ref>

*''Western African route'' (Sea passage from [[West Africa]]n countries into the [[Canary Islands]] (i.e., territory of [[Spain]]))
*''Western Mediterranean route'' (Sea passage from [[North Africa]] to southern coast of Spain which also includes the land route through the borders of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]])
*''Central Mediterranean route'' (Sea passage from North Africa (particularly [[Egypt]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://regionalmms.org/index.php/research-publications/feature-articles/item/51|title=Migration through Egypt: The Safe Alternative to Libya?|access-date=28 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229032112/http://regionalmms.org/index.php/research-publications/feature-articles/item/51|archive-date=29 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Libya]]) towards [[Italy]] and [[Malta]] across the [[Mediterranean Sea]]). Most migrants taking this route board vessels operated by [[People smuggling|people smugglers]]. NGOs such as [[Save the Children]], [[Médecins Sans Frontières|MSF]], and the German organisation Sea Eye operate search-and-rescue ships in this area to bring migrants to Europe.<ref name=":4" />
*''[[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]] route'' (Sea passage from Turkey and Egypt who enter Greece before crossing the [[Ionian Sea]] towards southern Italy; since October 2014 this has been classified by Frontex as a subset of the Central Mediterranean route)
*''Albania–Greece circular route'' (Large number of illegal land border crossings where economic migrants from [[Albania]] cross into [[Greece]] for seasonal jobs before returning home.)
*''Western Balkan route'' (Land and sea route from the Greek-Turkish border to [[Hungary]] via [[North Macedonia]] and [[Serbia]], [[Romania]] or [[Croatia]].<ref name="aljazeera.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/refugees-seeking-routes-border-closures-150916045558970.html|title=Refugees cross Croatia border in search of new route|publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=19 September 2015}}</ref> Mostly used by Greater Middle Eastern immigrants (from [[Syria]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]) but also by large numbers of migrants from [[Western Balkans|Western Balkan]] countries, primarily [[Kosovo]]).
*''Eastern Mediterranean route'' (Passage used primarily by Greater Middle Eastern migrants crossing from Turkey into the EU via [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]] or [[Cyprus]]. Large portions of these migrants continue along the Western Balkan route towards Hungary or Romania.)
*''Eastern Borders route'' (The 6,000&nbsp;km long land border between EU's eastern member countries and [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Moldova]].)

Another route was added:

====Economic migrants====
Migrants from the [[Western Balkans]] ([[Kosovo]], [[Albania]], [[Serbia]]) and parts of [[West Africa]] ([[The Gambia]], [[Nigeria]]) were more likely to be [[economic migrant]]s, who were fleeing poverty and job scarcity, many of whom hoped for a better lifestyle and job offers without valid claims to [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|refugee status]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Mass Migration: What Is Driving the Balkan Exodus? |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/western-balkan-exodus-puts-pressure-on-germany-and-eu-a-1049274.html |work=Der Spiegel |date=26 August 2015}}</ref><ref name="NossiterNiger">{{cite news |last1=Nossiter |first1=Adam |title=Migrant Smuggling Business Is Booming in Niger, Despite Crackdown |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/21/world/africa/migrant-smuggling-business-is-booming-in-niger-despite-crackdown.html?ref=world&_r=0 |access-date=20 August 2015 |work=The New York Times |date=20 August 2015}}</ref> The majority of asylum applicants from [[Serbia]], [[North Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]] are [[Romani people|Roma]] people who felt discriminated against in their countries of origin.<ref name="BalkanExodus">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34173252|title=Migrant crisis: Explaining the exodus from the Balkans|work=BBC News|access-date=19 September 2015}}</ref>

Some argue that migrants have been seeking to settle preferentially in national destinations that offer more generous [[social welfare]] benefits and host more established Middle Eastern and African immigrant communities. Others argue that migrants are attracted to more tolerant societies with stronger economies, and that the chief motivation for leaving Turkey is that they are not permitted to leave camps or work.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/world/europe/eastern-europe-migrant-refugee-crisis.html|title=Eastern Bloc's Resistance to Refugees Highlights Europe's Cultural and Political Divisions|author=Rick Lyman|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 September 2015|access-date=13 September 2015}}</ref> A large number of refugees in Turkey have been faced with difficult living circumstances;<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Villasana |first1=Danielle |title=Picturing health: challenges for Syrian refugees in Turkey |journal=The Lancet |date=October 2016 |volume=388 |issue=10056 |pages=2096–103 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31647-6 |pmid=27642017 |s2cid=6487863 }}</ref> thus, many refugees arriving in southern Europe continue their journey in attempts to reach northern European countries such as Germany, which are observed as having more prominent outcomes of security.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/protection/operations/5592bd059/sea-route-europe-mediterranean-passage-age-refugees.html|title=The sea route to Europe: The Mediterranean passage in the age of refugees|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|newspaper=UNHCR|access-date=16 November 2016}}</ref> In contrast to Germany, France's popularity eroded in 2015 among migrants seeking asylum after being historically considered a popular final destination for the EU migrants.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/world/europe/a-belated-welcome-in-france-is-drawing-few-migrants.html|title=A Belated Welcome in France Is Drawing Few Migrants|author=Adam Nossiter|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 September 2015|access-date=17 September 2015|quote=Migrants crowding onto the trains in Hungary shout, "Germany, Germany!"

=== Surveys on immigration ===
The Pew study links the anti-immigrant rhetoric of the right-wing parties across the continent and the heated debate over the [[Brexit|UK’s decision to exit the European Union]] to the surge of refugees into Europe. There were sharp and deep ideological divides among the public over their views of minorities and diversity represented by these immigrants. Negative attitudes toward immigrants were tied to a belief that these groups do not wish to participate in their society.<ref name=2016Opinion />

==== Security ====
A study published by [[Pew Research Center]] on 11 July 2016 concluded that "Europeans fear [that a] wave of refugees means more terrorism, fewer jobs".  Half of the population in Italy and Sweden blame crime on immigrants.<ref name=2016Opinion>{{cite report  |last1=Wike |first1=Richard |title=Europeans Fear Wave of Refugees Will Mean More Terrorism, Fewer Jobs |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/07/Pew-Research-Center-EU-Refugees-and-National-Identity-Report-FINAL-July-11-2016.pdf |website=Pew Research Center:Global Attitudes & Trends |publisher=Pew Research Center}}</ref>

==== Economy ====
A study published by [[Pew Research Center]] in 2016 concluded that Half of the respondents felt that immigrants would take away jobs and social benefits; Hungarians, Poles, Greeks, Italians and French identify losing jobs and social benefits as their first concern.<ref name=2016Opinion />

In a 2016 poll, refugees, unemployment, and refugees taking away jobs was the list of issues that ordinary Finns were most concerned about.<ref>{{cite news |title=Do refugees take away jobs? |url=https://www.debatingeurope.eu/2018/04/04/refugees-take-away-jobs/#.XtZi8TdKijA |work=Debating Europe |date=4 April 2018}}</ref> The original study in Finland found that immigration was a marginal concern in the early 2010s, however the economy was a concern since the neighboring Soviet Union, significant export market, collapsed in the 1990s. The original study found that around 30% believe that uncontrolled immigration was a problem. This ratio was 40% under the age of 25, people who often were looking for jobs themselves.

The [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] took place on 23 June 2016. Result was the UK voted to "Leave" the European Union by 51.89% to 48.11% for Remain. [[Opinion polling for the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|At the opinion polls]], public responded leaving the EU was "more likely to bring about a better immigration system, improved border controls, a fairer welfare system, better quality of life, and the ability to control our own laws."<ref name=lordashcroftpolls/> Also at the opinion polls, public responded leaving the EU "offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders".<ref name=lordashcroftpolls>{{cite web |last1=Ashcroft |first1=Lord |title=How the United Kingdom voted on Thursday... and why - Lord Ashcroft Polls |url=https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/ |publisher=lordashcroftpolls}} http://lordashcroftpolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-the-UK-voted-Full-tables-1.pdf</ref>

Migration crisis was a defining issue in the "[[Causes of the vote in favour of Brexit|Leave campaign]]", ([[Vote Leave]] predominant economic, [[Leave.EU]] predominant anti-immigration) giving a sharper focus to the slogan of “taking back control” and opposition to EU law and European human rights law, both giving rights to “foreigners” which were deemed unacceptable by many conservatives as well as those further to the right.

=== Hungarian migrant referendum ===
The [[2016 Hungarian migrant quota referendum]] announced by the [[Third Orbán Government]] was about the EU migrant relocation plan. It was commonly referred to as the "quota referendum" in the Hungarian media. In September 2015, the Justice and Home Affairs Council at the EU's interior ministers meeting approved to relocate 1,294 refugees from other member states to Hungary. The referendum question was "Do you want the European Union to be able to mandate the obligatory resettlement of non-Hungarian citizens into Hungary even without the approval of the National Assembly?" The result of the referendum was to reject the plan, with 3,362,224 'No' votes (98.4%) and 56,163 'Yes' votes (1.6%). The voter turnout was 40.4%, which was short of the required 50% threshold stated in the constitution. Government declared result is binding "politically and legally", but the opposition said it was invalid. Mr Orban told EU, it should take a note of the result.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hungary PM claims referendum victory |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37528325 |work=BBC News |date=3 October 2016}}</ref>

On 6 August 2015, [[Amnesty International]] Secretary General [[Heinz Patzelt]] inspected the refugee camp ''Bundesbetreuungsstelle'' in [[Traiskirchen]] where more than 4,800 migrants and refugees are housed. Medical expert [[Siroos Mirzaei]] from Amnesty International noted that people had to wait for days to get medical help due to the vast number of people received over a short period of time. The report also stated that only four doctors were present at the refugee camp and showers and other hygienic facilities were in disrepair.

The migrant crisis spurred right-wing electoral preferences across Germany with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) gaining 12% of the vote in the [[2017 German federal election]]. These developments prompted debates over the reasons for increased right-wing populism in Germany. Literature argued that the increased right-wing preferences are a result of the European migrant crisis which has brought thousands of people, predominantly from Muslim countries to Germany, and spurred a perception among a share of Germans that refugees constitute an ethnic and cultural threat to Germany.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lucassen|first1=Geertje|last2=Lubbers|first2=Marcel|title=Who Fears What?

The German Federal Office for Migration has recently prioritized the newly adopted Orderly Return Law (Geordnete- Ruckkehr-Gresetz). The Orderly Return Law is a second round of legal actions taken when the person of foreign origin is denied citizenship and is then obligated to leave.<ref>“German Parliament Passes ‘Orderly-Return-Law.’” European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE), www.ecre.org/germany-parliament-passes-orderly-return-law/</ref> The law allows for detention of the asylum seeker when they do not cooperate with law enforcement in the deportation process. Due to this law, the law enforcement authority given the responsibility for carrying out the deportations are given the right to access the asylum seekers apartments without any preexisting judicial orders. Given this authority, law enforcement is also subject to the responsibility of bringing the person to be deported to the airport or border for the purpose of deportation.<ref>“Germany: A Controversial Law Package Passes the Parliament.” Germany: A Controversial Law Package Passes the Parliament | Asylum Information Database, www.asylumineurope.org/news/14-06-2019/germany-controversial-law-package-passes-parliament-1</ref> The scope of the law is to increase the proportion of successful deportations to 188,000 (double what was previously possible).<ref>Mischke, Judith. “Germany Passes Controversial Migration Law.” POLITICO, POLITICO, 7 June 2019, www.politico.eu/article/germany-passes-controversial-migration-law/</ref> In reality in 2019, 22.097 individuals were deported from Germany.<ref>[https://www.bpb.de/gesellschaft/migration/flucht/zahlen-zu-asyl/265765/abschiebungen-in-deutschland "Abschiebungen in Deutschland"] [[Federal Agency for Civic Education]] 9 June 2020, Retrieved 18 September 2020</ref>

In a research report posted by the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees,<ref>“startseite_node.” BAMF, 11 Dec. 2019, www.bamf.de/EN/Startseite/startseite_node.html</ref> the StarthilfePlus program found that most refugees, who had opted to go back with BAMF assistance, wished to return to their homelands, rejoining their friends and family. In support of this, Germany has given financial assistance to those wishing to return as a means of helping them with economic uncertainties they may face during the transition.<ref>Schmitt, Martin, et al.

In July 2017, Italy drew up a code of conduct for NGO rescue vessels delivering migrants to Italian ports. These rules included:
* A prohibition from entering the [[territorial waters]] of Libya, except in situations of imminent danger.
* A prohibition from switching off the [[Automatic identification system|Automatic Identification System]] (AIS) and [[Long-range identification and tracking (ships)|LRIT]] transponders if they are installed on the ship.
* A prohibition from signaling human traffickers with flares or radio to coordinate with them when to send out their [[Dinghy|dinghies]].
* A prohibition from transferring those rescued onto other vessels.
* A commitment to having a policeman to travel on board whenever requested in order to identify and prosecute human traffickers among the migrants.

By midday of 19 September, the country had registered around 1,500 migrants, with all of them being accommodated in temporary reception camps or asylum centres. The largest traffic was seen at the [[Obrežje, Brežice|Obrežje border crossing]], [[Dobova|Dobova border crossing]] and [[Brežice]]. Prime Minister [[Miro Cerar]] visited the reception centre in Brežice on Saturday, stressing that Slovenia had the situation under control, while criticising the Croatian government for being uncooperative.<ref>{{cite web|title = Slovenia Admits Some 1,500 Refugees, Some Proceed to Austria|url = http://www.sloveniatimes.com/slovenia-admits-some-1-500-refugees-some-proceed-to-austria|publisher = sloveniatimes.com|access-date = 19 September 2015}}</ref>

From 2000 until at least 2016, Spain developed a purportedly efficient plan to manage irregularly arriving migrants on the Spanish [[Canary Islands]]; it consisted of four aspects:
*Strengthening bilateral ties and close cooperation with local actors in all origin and transit countries
*Establishing bilateral partnership agreements with those countries
*Security, intelligence and policy strategies and joint actions
*Legal avenues and resettlement policies through agreements with those countries.<ref>[http://www.iris-france.org/80796-eu-spain-and-the-refugee-crisis/ 'EU, Spain and the refugee crisis'].

In November 2015, Sweden reintroduced border controls for arrivals, including the [[Öresund Bridge]]. This did not reduce the number of asylum seekers as they had the right to apply for asylum once they were on Swedish ground. In December 2015, Sweden passed a temporary law that allowed the government to oblige all transport companies to check that their passengers carried valid photographic identification before crossing the border.

===Switzerland===
As a non-EU member country but full participant in the [[Schengen Agreement]], the [[Swiss Confederation]] was directly affected by the migrant crisis with most of the refugees arriving from [[Italy]] at border crossings in the Southern cantons of [[Ticino]] and [[Valais]]. In 2015, almost 40,000 asylum seekers applied for refugee status. Compared to 2015, this number dropped by 31 percent in 2016 and 70 percent in the first quarter of 2017. Most of the asylum seekers arriving in Switzerland come from [[Eritrea]] (49 percent), followed by [[Afghanistan]] (30 percent) and [[Syria]]. Despite relative restrictive admission policies and increased patrolling of illegal border crossings, the Swiss attempted to admit refugees throughout the course of the migrant crisis, and distributed those asylum seekers to the appropriate cantons and city states.

Refugees first received a temporary residence permit "N" valid for 6 months while they waited for approval of their status. Asylum seekers who are not admitted but cannot return to their home country because of health or safety considerations receive a residence permit "F" that allows them to stay in Switzerland. Persons receiving a "B" permit are admitted refugees according to the [[Geneva Convention]] with a full residence allowance for 12 months and possible extensions. Almost 50 percent of the asylum seekers receive residence permits or are allowed to stay, and about 10 percent of those rejected can be placed in another Schengen country.

With 3.4 asylum seekers per 1000 inhabitants in 2016, Switzerland processed more asylum applications than the European average of 2.5. About 2.5 percent of asylum seekers in Switzerland are employed; the numbers are higher at 30 percent for those with temporary permits and at 24 percent for admitted refugees.<ref>Sermîn Faki, Priska Wallimann (April 2017).

In 2015, just before the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] that were to happen that year, government officials with then-Prime Minister [[Ewa Kopacz]] stated that the country was ready to take 2,000 refugees.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://msw.gov.pl/en/news/909,Preparations-for-taking-2000-refugees.html |title=Preparations for taking 2,000 refugees |author=JSK Internet |work=Ministry of the Interior}}</ref>  However, after the [[Law and Justice]] party won the elections, the rhetoric changed. Both the government of Poland and President [[Andrzej Duda]] rejected the European Union's proposal of compulsory migrant quotas. Duda stated: "I won't agree to a dictate of the strong.

IOM and [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] estimated that 1,005,504 migrants and refugees arrived in Europe from 1 January to 21 December 2015, three to four times more than in 2014.<ref name="Miles One Million 2015">{{cite news | last=Miles | first=Tom | title=EU gets one million migrants in 2015, smugglers seen making $1 billion | work=Reuters | date=22 December 2015 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-idUSKBN0U50WI20151222 | access-date=22 December 2015}}</ref> 3 percent (34,215) arrived to Bulgaria and Greece by land; the rest arrived in Greece, Italy, Spain, Cyprus and Malta by sea.

From 1 January to 17 April 2015, 21,191 migrants reached the Italian coast, with a decrease during the month of March due to bad weather conditions, and a surge since 10 April, bringing the number of arrivals in line with the number recorded in the same period in 2014. However, the death toll in the first four months of 2014 was 96, compared to 500 in the same period in 2015; this number excluded the victims of the [[April 2015 Libya migrant shipwrecks|shipwrecks on 13 and 19 April]].<ref>{{cite news |title=IOM Applauds Italy's Weekend Rescue at Sea of 2,800 Migrants |url=http://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home/news-and-views/press-briefing-notes/pbn-2015/pbn-listing/iom-applauds-italys-weekend-resc.html |publisher=International Organization for Migration |date=13 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Migrant Deaths Soar in Mediterranean |url=http://www.iom.int/cms/en/sites/iom/home/news-and-views/press-briefing-notes/pbn-2015/pbn-listing/migrant-deaths-soar-in-mediterra.html |publisher=International Organization for Migration |date=17 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Bobby Thomas|date=2015|title=Migration in the Mediterranean Region and Policy Implications|url=https://thercs.org/blogsnews-and-blognews-and-blog/news-and-blog/migration-in-the-mediterranean-region-and-policy-implications/|journal=Commonwealth Voices|publisher=Royal Commonwealth Society}}</ref>

However, in 2015 there were only an estimated one million individuals irregularly entering the EU: most migrants following the Western Balkan route were double-counted as "illegally crossing an EU border": first when arriving in Greece, and again when entering the EU for the second time through Hungary or Croatia.<ref name="Frontex2016">{{cite web|title=Risk analysis for 2016|url=http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/Annula_Risk_Analysis_2016.pdf|publisher=Frontex}}</ref>

In January and February 2016, over 123,000 migrants landed in Greece, compared to about 4,600 in the same period of 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/11/world/europe/europe-tries-to-shut-down-routes-as-migrant-flow-intensifies.html|title=Europe Tries to Shut Down Routes as Migrant Flow Intensifies|author1=LARRY BUCHANAN |author2=SERGIO PEÇANHA |newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 March 2016|access-date=13 March 2016}}</ref> In March, following North Macedonia's closure of the Western Balkan route and the enforcement of the EU–Turkey deal on 20 March, the number of migrants arriving in Greece decreased to 26,460, less than half the figure recorded in February.

Due to improved weather conditions, the number of mainly African migrants [[Immigration to Italy|crossing the sea to Italy]] doubled between February and March, reaching nearly 9,600 in March 2016, compared to 2,283 in March 2015.<ref name=":6">{{cite web|url=http://migration.iom.int/docs/Q3_Overview_Arrivals_to_Europe.pdf|title=Migration Flows to Europe – Quarterly Overview|date=October 2017|publisher=International Organisation of Migration|access-date=4 November 2017}}</ref><ref name="FrontexMarch2016"/> In April, the number of migrants arriving in Italy (8,370) dropped by 13 percent compared to the previous month and by 50 percent when compared to the same month in 2015; despite this, Italy exceeded the totals for Greece for the first time since June 2015.<ref name="FrontexApril2016"/> On 16 April, a [[List of migrant vessel incidents on the Mediterranean Sea|shipwreck]] of a large boat between Libya and Italy was reported, in which as many as 500 people may have died.<ref>{{cite news|title=Massive loss of life reported in latest Mediterranean tragedy|url=http://www.unhcr.org/57178bcf6.html|publisher=UNHCR|date=20 April 2016}}</ref>

The mass influx of migrants into Europe was not seen as favourable in many EU countries. Many citizens disapproved of how EU handled the migrant crisis, with 94 percent of Greeks and 88 percent of Swedes disapproving of the measures taken, among other countries with similar disapproval rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/06/07/euroskepticism-beyond-brexit/pm_2016-06-07_brexit-03/|title=Overwhelming majorities unhappy with EU's handling of refugees|date=6 June 2016}}</ref> These findings contributed to the creation and implementation of the [[European Union–Turkey relations#EU-Turkey deal on migrant crisis|EU–Turkey Refugee Agreement]], which was signed in March 2016; the numbers of refugees entering Greece decreased afterwards. In February 2016, 57,066 migrants arrived in Greece from the sea. From that point on, discounting March, the highest number of migrants reaching Greece by sea was 3,650 in April.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83|title=UNHCR Refugees/Migrants Response – Mediterranean|first=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|last=(UNHCR)}}</ref> While there is no direct connection to the implementation of the EU–Turkey deal, the number of migrants arriving in Italy in that same time period increased.

====2017====
Data released by the IOM for the third quarter of 2017 recorded a total of 146,287 arrivals to Europe, of which 137,771 were by sea, which is less than half the total recorded by the end of September 2016. The greatest decrease in influx was noted on the Eastern Mediterranean route. Despite an 86 percent drop in the number of migrant and refugee arrivals in September 2017 when compared to September 2016, Greece observed a steady increase in the number of migrants from September 2016. While Italy also noted lower numbers of arriving migrants in 2017, there was a significant jump in the number of migrants reaching Spain, with over 16,000 having arrived in the country. In 2017, ease of access via the West Mediterranean route had boosted migrant numbers from Africa, with preference being given to Spain over Italy or Greece as a landing point.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/826766/Migrant-crisis-EU-new-challenge-arrivals-Spain|title=EU's migrant nightmare: Arrivals in Spain rocket as smugglers slash crossing price to £800|work=Daily Express|access-date=4 November 2017}}</ref>

Closure of segments of some traffic-heavy routes such as the Central and Eastern Mediterranean is responsible for the marked decrease in the number of migrants from the Middle East in 2017. However, the Western Mediterranean route was still in full use to facilitate the growing number of illegal immigrants from Africa. Nigerians topped the list of illegal immigrants into Italy in 2017 and formed 16 percent of arrivals there.<ref name=":7" />

In February 2017 the Italian government agreed to fund the Libyan coast guard. Since then many migrants were forced to go back to Libya.<ref name="auto12">{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/migrants-deaths-in-mediterranean-reach-record-percentage-1.3652139|title=Migrants deaths in Mediterranean reach record percentage|first=Sally|last=Hayden|website=The Irish Times}}</ref>

====2020====
In late September 2020, [[Cyprus]] authorities were reported to have abandoned 200 migrant workers at sea without fuel and food. The migrants alleged that their asylum claims were ignored and were instead beaten in some cases by the [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] marine police officers.

In 2016, according to Eurostat, most of the non-EU 28 asylum seekers in EU 28 originated from Syria. Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq together constituted 50 percent of all asylum seekers.<ref name="Asylum 2016">{{cite news |title=Asylum applicants in the EU |url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/news/themes-in-the-spotlight/asylum2016|work=Eurostat|access-date=13 June 2018}}</ref>

====2017====
The second quarter of 2017 recorded a 54 percent decrease in the number of first-time asylum applicants compared to April–June 2016, and 11 percent fewer applicants than January–March 2017. The greatest number of applications were from Syria, Afghanistan, and Nigeria. However, the number of Syrians and Afghans was less than that of the same time in 2016, suggesting that the peak of this crisis had passed. The increasing number of illegal immigrants from Africa suggests that the direction of the crisis changed. While Germany recorded the highest number of first-time applicants (over 49,000), Spain saw a 30 percent increase in the number of asylum seekers, along with Cyprus and Bulgaria.<ref name="Asylum quarterly report" />

=== Migrant arrivals versus "illegal" border crossings ===
The [[European Union|EU]] [[European Border and Coast Guard Agency|Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex)]] uses the terms "illegal" and "irregular" border crossings for crossings of an EU external border but not at an official [[Border checkpoint|border-crossing point]] (BCP).<ref name=Frontex2016,p.22>{{cite web |url=https://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/Annual_Risk_Analysis_2016.pdf#page=24 |page=22 |title=Risk Analysis for 2016 |publisher=[[Frontex]] |date=March 2016}}</ref> These include the crossings of people rescued at sea and brought to land by EU citizens.<ref name=Frontex2016,p.20>{{cite web |url=https://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/Annual_Risk_Analysis_2016.pdf#page=22 |page=20 |title=Risk Analysis for 2016 |publisher=[[Frontex]] |date=March 2016}}</ref> The total number of illegal EU external border crossings can be higher than the number of migrants newly illegally arriving in the EU in a year, especially for the years 2015 and 2016 (see table below). News media sometimes misrepresent these figures as given by Frontex.<ref name="auto1" />

=== Border crossings ===
[[File:Migrants in Hungary 2015 Aug 003.jpg|thumb|Migrants along the Western Balkan route crossing from Serbia into Hungary, 24 August 2015]]
In September 2015, Europol estimated there were 30,000 suspected migrant smugglers, which rose to 55,000 in 2016 and increased to 65,000 in 2017. 63 percent of smugglers were from Europe, 14 percent from the Middle East, 13 percent from Africa, nine percent from Asia excluding the Middle East and one percent from the Americas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://citizen.co.za/news/news-africa/1879124/europe-migrants-smugglers/|title=EU tracking 65,000 migrant smugglers: Europol|last=CARMICHAEL/AFP|first=by Lachlan|work=The Citizen|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}</ref>

Frontex tracks and publishes data on numbers of crossings along the main six routes twice a year. The following table shows the data for the period up to and including the year 2016:

In a report released in January 2016, [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF)denounced the EU response to the [[refugee crisis]] in 2015 and said that policies of deterrence and a chaotic response to the humanitarian needs of those who fled actively worsened the conditions of refugees and migrants and created a "policy-made humanitarian crisis". According to MSF, obstacles placed by EU governments included "not providing any alternative to a deadly sea crossing, erecting razor wire fences, continuously changing administrative and registration procedures, committing acts of violence at sea and at land borders and providing completely inadequate reception conditions in Italy and Greece".<ref>{{cite web|title=Migration: European policies dramatically worsened the so-called 2015 "refugee crisis"|url=http://www.msf.org/article/migration-european-policies-dramatically-worsened-so-called-2015-%E2%80%9Crefugee-crisis%E2%80%9D|publisher=Médecins Sans Frontières|date=19 January 2016}}</ref>

On 18 June 2016, [[United Nations]] chief [[Ban Ki-moon]] also called for international support and praised Greece for showing "remarkable solidarity and compassion" towards refugees.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/un-chief-ban-ki-moon-urges-international-support-for-greece-over-refugees/a-19340214|title=UN chief Ban Ki-moon urges international support for Greece over refugees|publisher=Deutsche Welle}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-greece-un-idUSKCN0Z40AQ|title=Countries must do more to help Greece with migrant crisis: U.N. chief|work=Reuters}}</ref> The lack of action of UNESCO in this area was the subject of controversy. Some scholars, like António Silva,<ref>{{cite book|language=fr|author=SILVA, A. J. M.|title=Le régime UNESCO (Discours et pratiques alimentaires en Méditerranée vol.

They also accuse the organization of contributing to the emerging process of fetishization of the cultural heritage, forgetting that it should be used primarily as an instrument in the fight against racism, as openly declared the authors of the constitutive charter of the institution in 1945.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

On 23 March 2020, [[United Nations special rapporteur|UN Special Rapporteur]] Felipe González warned [[Greece]] to end the violation of the rights of [[asylum seekers]] at the [[Greece–Turkey border|Turkey-Greece border]]. González also demanded that Greece improve measures to protect asylum seekers. Asylum seekers who succeeded in crossing the border were allegedly [[Detention (imprisonment)|detained]] and searched, with all material possessions confiscated before being sent back to [[Turkey]]. The report noted that manhandling of the migrants resulted in deaths and serious injuries in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/greece/greece-rights-violations-against-asylum-seekers-turkey-greece-border-must-stop-un|title= Greece: Rights violations against asylum seekers at Turkey-Greece border must stop – UN Special Rapporteur [EN/EL]|access-date=23 March 2020|website=ReliefWeb}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25736&LangID=E|title= Rights violations against asylum seekers at Turkey-Greece border must stop – UN Special Rapporteur|access-date=23 March 2020|website=UN Human Rights}}</ref>

On 23 September 2020, The European Commission presented its “New Pact on Migration and Asylum” – a series of legislative proposals on the EU’s approach to migration and asylum. The Commission’s proposals include possible screening at external borders and an alternative solidarity mechanism that offers States not willing to relocate asylum-seekers the option of contributing in other ways, such as managing the return of people denied asylum or funding reception centres in frontline states. The proposal also outlines a more coordinated approach to search-and-rescue at sea that would involve relocating those rescued to other States and ruling out the criminalization of NGO rescue vessels.<ref name="European Sources Online">{{cite web |title=Communication on a New Pact on Migration and Asylum – European Sources Online | website=European Sources Online |url=https://www.europeansources.info/record/communication-on-a-new-pact-on-migration-and-asylum/ |access-date=2020-09-29}}</ref>

===Libya===
According to Reuters, most Libyan migrants departed in vessels operated by [[People smuggling|people smugglers]].<ref name=":4" /> As of September 2018, one in five migrants attempting to cross the [[Mediterranean Sea]] from [[Libya]] either drowned or disappeared.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_location=Libya|title=Libya – The Irish Times|website=irishtimes.com}}</ref>

In August 2017 the [[Libya]]n Coast Guard issued a declaration that NGO search and rescue vessels must stay outside of a zone running 360&nbsp;km (190 nautical miles) from the Libyan coast unless they were given express permission to enter.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20170811-migrations-mediterranee-bras-force-libye-ong-eaux-territoriales|title=ONG en Méditerranée: la Libye affirme sa souveraineté sur ses eaux territoriales |work=RFI Afrique|access-date=13 August 2017|language=fr-FR}}</ref> This zone is 10 nautical miles smaller than the Libyan [[Exclusive economic zone|Exclusive Economic Zone]], The coast guard statement criticised the NGO vessels for approaching the Libyan coastline to a distance of as short as ten to thirteen nautical miles, which is inside the Libyan [[territorial waters]].<ref name=":1" /> As a result, NGOs [[Médecins Sans Frontières|MSF]], [[Save the Children]] and Sea Eye suspended their operations after clashes with the Libyan Coast Guard after the latter asserted its sovereignty of its waters by firing [[warning shot]]s.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-ngo-idUSKCN1AT0IZ|title=More NGOs follow MSF in suspending Mediterranean migrant rescues|date=15 August 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=16 August 2017}}</ref>

==Press coverage==
In a report ordered by [[UNHCR]] and authored by the [[Cardiff School of Journalism]], an analysis was done on media reports in five European countries: Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, Germany and Sweden. From 2014 to the early months of 2015, UNHCR and other humanitarian organisations launched a series of large media advocacy exercises. Significant discrepancies were noted in the response to the campaign in other media for the same period. Differences included:
* The kind of sources journalists used for their articles, such as domestic or foreign politicians, citizens or NGOs.
* The language used: Germany and Sweden overwhelmingly used terms ''refugee'' or ''asylum seeker'' while Italy and UK preferred the term ''migrant''. In Spain, the dominant term was ''immigrant''.
* The reasons given for the increase in refugee flows.
* Suggested solutions.
* The predominant themes: threats to welfare systems and cultural threats were most prevalent in Italy, Spain, and Britain while humanitarian themes were more frequent in Italian coverage.
* Overall the [[Media of Sweden|Swedish press]] was most positive towards the arrivals, while [[Media of the United Kingdom|UK press]] was both the most negative and the most polarised.<ref name="cardiff_s_o_j_dec2015_preface">{{cite book|title=Press Coverage of the Refugee and Migrant Crisis in the EU: A Content Analysis of Five European Countries|date=December 2015|publisher=[[Cardiff School of Journalism]] / UNHCR|page=1|url=http://www.unhcr.org/protection/operations/56bb369c9/press-coverage-refugee-migrant-crisis-eu-content-analysis-five-european.html|access-date=18 February 2018}}</ref>

===Press coverage of German migration policies===
Analyst Naina Bajekal for the United States' magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in September 2015 suggested that the German decision to allow Syrian refugees to apply for asylum in Germany even if they had reached Germany through other EU member states in August 2015, led to increased numbers of refugees from Syria and other regions – Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, Ukraine, Congo, South Sudan etc. – endeavouring to reach (Western) Europe.<ref name=BajekalTime>{{cite news|last=Bajekal|first=Naina|date=9 September 2015|title=The 5 Big Questions About Europe's Migrant Crisis|url=http://time.com/4026380/europe-migrant-crisis-questions-refugees/|work=Time|access-date=16 June 2017}}</ref>

In March 2016, the UK's ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' said that Merkel's 2015 decisions concerning migration represented an "open door policy", which it claimed was "encouraging migration into Europe that her own country is unwilling to absorb" and as damaging the EU, "perhaps terminally".<ref>"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/angela-merkel/12193876/Angela-Merkels-historic-error-on-immigration.html Angela Merkel's historic error on immigration]".

==Predictions for future migration==
[[Klaus Schwab]], founder and executive chairman of the [[World Economic Forum]], claimed in January 2016 that the refugee crisis could be the precursor of something bigger. Bloomberg summarized his words as follows:
<blockquote>As the crash in commodities prices spreads economic woe across the developing world, Europe could face a wave of migration that will eclipse today's refugee crisis. 

"Look how many countries in Africa, for example, depend on the income from oil exports," Schwab said in an interview ahead of the WEF's 46th annual meeting, in the Swiss resort of Davos. "Now imagine 1 billion inhabitants, imagine they all move north."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-18/wef-boss-schwab-warns-commodities-rout-could-spur-more-migration|title=Davos Boss Warns Refugee Crisis Could Be Precursor to Something Much Bigger|date=18 January 2016}}</ref></blockquote>
