The '''Congressional Gold Medal''' is an award bestowed by the [[United States Congress]].  The congressional practice of issuing gold medals to occasionally honor recipients from the military began during the [[American Revolution]]. Later the practice extended to individuals in all walks of life and in the late 20th century also to groups. The Congressional Gold Medal and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] are the highest [[Civilian decorations of the United States|civilian awards]] in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Straus|first1=Jacob R.|title=Congressional Gold Medals: Background, Legislative Process, and Issues for Congress|date=February 9, 2018|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45101.pdf|access-date=16 February 2018}}</ref> The congressional medal seeks to honor those, individually or as a group, "who have performed an achievement that has an impact on American history and culture that is likely to be recognized as a major achievement in the recipient's field long after the achievement."<ref name=CRS>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30076.pdf |title=Congressional Research Service, ''Congressional Gold Medals, 1776-2016'' CRS Report RL30076 |publisher=Congressional Research Service |access-date=2017-03-01}}</ref> However, "There are no permanent statutory provisions specifically relating to the creation of Congressional Gold Medals. When a Congressional Gold Medal has been deemed appropriate, Congress has, by legislative action, provided for the creation of a medal on an [[ad hoc]] basis."<ref name=CRS/> Thus, there are generally fewer gold medals than presidential medals. U.S. citizenship is not a requirement.

As of April 4, 2019, 163 institutions, people, or events have been awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=109150|title=This Week in History: Congressional Gold Medals|last=Botts|first=Nichael|website=United States Navy|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> 

==History==
[[File:John Paul Jones Congressional Gold Medal (front).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Etching of medal awarded to [[John Paul Jones]], only [[Continental Navy]] officer to be awarded a gold medal]]

Since the American Revolution, Congress has commissioned [[gold medal]]s as its highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions. The [[Washington Before Boston Medal|medal]] was first awarded in 1776 by the [[Second Continental Congress]] to General [[George Washington]].<ref name=list>{{Cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/house_history/goldMedal.html|title=Congressional Gold Medal Recipients}}</ref> Although the first recipients were military figures who participated in the [[American Revolution]], the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Mexican–American War]], Congress broadened the scope of the medal to include actors, authors, entertainers, musicians, pioneers in aeronautics and space, explorers, lifesavers, notables in science and medicine, athletes, humanitarians, public servants, and foreign recipients.<ref name=list /> The medal is normally awarded to persons, but in 1979 the [[American Red Cross]] became the first organization to be honored with a gold medal.<ref name=CRS />

{{As of|2019}} four people had been awarded more than one gold medal: [[Winfield Scott]] (1814 for the [[War of 1812]] and 1848 for the [[Mexican–American War]]), [[Zachary Taylor]] (1846, 1847, and 1848 for the Mexican–American War), [[Lincoln Ellsworth]] (1928 and 1936 for polar exploration), and [[Hyman G. Rickover]] (1958 for the "Nuclear Navy" and 1982 for his entire career).

The Gold Medal and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] are generally considered to carry the same level of prestige (though significantly fewer Gold Medals have been awarded). The main difference between them is that the Freedom Medal is personally awarded by the [[President of the United States]], whilst Congressional Gold Medals are awarded by Acts of Congress. Congress may, however, authorize the President to present the award.

Per committee rules, legislation bestowing a Congressional Gold Medal upon a recipient must be co-sponsored by two-thirds of the membership of both the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] before their respective committees—the [[House Committee on Financial Services]] and the [[Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]]—will consider it.<ref name=CRS />

A Congressional Gold Medal is designed by the [[United States Mint]] to specifically commemorate the person and achievement for which the medal is awarded. Medals are therefore different in appearance, and there is no standard design. Congressional Gold Medals are considered non-portable, meaning that they are not meant to be worn on a uniform or other clothing, but rather displayed.

In rare instances, miniature versions have been made or converted for wear on clothing, suspended from a ribbon. Examples are the [[Cardenas Medal]] for [[Frank H. Newcomb]], the [[David H. Jarvis#Recognition|Jarvis' Medal]] for [[David H. Jarvis]], the [[Jeannette Medal]] for the men of the [[Jeannette Expedition|''Jeannette'' expedition]], the [[Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal]] for the men of the [[Richard E. Byrd#First Antarctic expedition (1928–1930)|First Byrd expedition of 1928–1930]], and the [[NC-4 Medal]] for the men who completed the first transatlantic flight in May 1919. The latter was authorized in 1935 by {{USPL|74|43}} allowing the Secretary of the Navy to authorize—at his discretion—the wearing of commemorative or other special awards on Navy or Marine Corps uniforms, in military-sized form.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title = United States Statutes at Large|volume = 49|wslink = United States Statutes at Large/Volume 49/74th Congress/1st Session/Chapter 82|date = 1936|location = Washington|publisher = [[Government Printing Office|GPO]]|page = 162|scan = Page:United States Statutes at Large Volume 49 Part 1.djvu/207}}</ref> 

Often, [[bronze]] versions of the medals are struck for sale by the U.S. Mint, and may be available in both larger and smaller sizes. In at least one case, the John Wayne Congressional Medal, private dealers bought large numbers of the bronze version. They were then [[gold plate]]d and resold to the public for a significant profit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinbooks.org/esylum_v08n04a23.html|title=JOHN WAYNE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL|website=www.coinbooks.org}}</ref>

The Congressional Gold Medal is distinct from the [[Medal of Honor]], a military decoration for extreme bravery in action, and from the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]], presented by [[NASA]] for extraordinary accomplishment in United States space exploration.
