North Ayrshire Council is a  [[Hung parliament|hung]] Council.  North Ayrshire also forms part of the east coast of the [[Firth of Clyde]].<ref name="Part of east coast of Firth of Clyde">{{cite web | url=http://www.scapetrust.org/pdf/Clyde1/clyde1.pdf | title=East coast, Firth of Clyde. | accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>

==History and formation==
The area was created in 1996 as a successor to the district of [[Cunninghame]]. The council headquarters are located in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], which is the largest town. The area also contains the towns of [[Ardrossan]], [[Beith]], [[Dalry, North Ayrshire|Dalry]], [[Kilbirnie]], [[Kilwinning]], [[Largs]], [[Saltcoats]], [[Skelmorlie]], [[Stevenston]], [[West Kilbride]], as well as the [[Isle of Arran]] and the [[The Cumbraes|Cumbrae Isles]]. The Isle of Arran covers nearly half of the council area's territory, but is home to less than 4% of the population. North Ayrshire is known for its rural countryside, coastlines, beaches and landmarks. It is a mostly affluent area with the population being among the least deprived in Scotland. However a few parts of the area have some deprivation, this is mostly towards the south of the area in Saltcoats and Stevenston where there is some deprived areas.

The towns in the north of the area, Skelmorlie, Largs, Fairlie and West Kilbride are affluent commuting towns and with them being on the coast, are very popular with tourists during the summer months. Towns in the south include the three towns Ardrossan, Saltcoats and Stevenston as well as the affluent town of Kilwinning. Towards the south of the area is Irvine which is also the main settlement and largest town in the area. The inland towns of Dalry, Kilbirnie and Beith were steel towns with large steel mills however these are long gone. Tourism is the main industry on Arran and Cumbrae; however, the number of holiday homes on the latter has begun to squeeze locals out of the housing market. Regeneration is currently taking place at Ardrossan Harbour and Irvine town centre, and there has been a rapid increase in the construction of new housing in recent years.

[[Kelburn Castle]], Fairlie, is the home of the [[Earl of Glasgow|10th Earl of Glasgow]], Patrick Robin Archibald Boyle. The grounds have belonged to the Boyle family since the 1100s. In 2007, the castle was transformed by the [[Kelburn Castle|Graffiti Project]].

==Government==

The [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] formed a minority administration in the North Ayrshire council area in May 2012, however, they were replaced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] following a by-election in Irvine West in 2016. At the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], North Ayrshire is covered by the [[Central Ayrshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Central Ayrshire]] and [[North Ayrshire and Arran (UK Parliament constituency)|North Ayrshire and Arran]] Parliamentary constituencies, both of which are represented by MPs belonging to the [[Scottish National Party]]. In the [[Scottish Parliament]], the council area is divided into [[Cunninghame North (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Cunninghame North]] and [[Cunninghame South (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Cunninghame South]], both represented by MSPs from the Scottish National Party.
