He was commonly referred to as ''Saddam Hussein'', or ''Saddam'' for short. The observation that referring to the deposed Iraqi president as only ''Saddam'' is derogatory or inappropriate may be based on the assumption that Hussein is a family name: thus, ''[[The New York Times]]'' refers to him as "Mr. Hussein",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/02/international/middleeast/02IRAQ.html?8br|title=Defiant Hussein Rebukes Iraqi Court for Trying Him|last=Burns|first=John F.|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 July 2004|access-date=2 July 2004}}</ref> while ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' uses just ''Saddam''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Saddam-Hussein|title=Saddam Hussein|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref> A full discussion can be found here.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/indepth/words/saddam_hussein.html|first=Blair|last=Shewchuk|title=Saddam or Mr. Hussein?|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News Online]]|date=February 2003}}</ref>}} 28 April 1937{{efn|Under his government, this date was his official date of birth.

As vice president under the ailing General [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], and at a time when many groups were considered capable of overthrowing the government, Saddam created security forces through which he tightly controlled conflicts between the government and the armed forces. In the early 1970s, Saddam nationalized [[Iraq Petroleum Company|oil]] and foreign banks leaving the system eventually insolvent mostly due to the [[Iran–Iraq War]], the [[Gulf War]], and [[Iraq sanctions|UN sanctions]].<ref name="economist2004">{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/2792407?story_id=2792407 |title=Banking in Iraq&nbsp;– A tricky operation |date=24 June 2004 |work=[[The Economist]] }}</ref> Through the 1970s, Saddam cemented his authority over the apparatus of government as oil money helped Iraq's economy grow at a rapid pace.

Saddam formally rose to power in 1979, although he had already been the ''de facto'' head of Iraq for several years. He suppressed several movements, particularly [[Shia Islam in Iraq|Shi'a]] and [[Kurds in Iraq|Kurdish]] movements which sought to overthrow the government or gain independence, respectively,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/58276.pdf|title=U.S. Relations With Anti-Saddam Groups|publisher=Congressional Research Service|access-date=15 April 2012}}</ref> and maintained power during the Iran–Iraq War and the Gulf War.

In 2003, a coalition led by the United States [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invaded Iraq]] to depose Saddam, in which U.S. President [[George W.

==Early life==
[[File:Саддам в молодости.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Saddam in his youth]]
<!-- NONE OF THIS IS CITED: Saddam Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti was born in the town of [[Al-Awja]], 13&nbsp;km (8&nbsp;mi) from the Iraqi town of [[Tikrit]], to a family of [[shepherd]]s from the al-Begat clan group, a sub-group of the [[Al-Bu Nasir]] (البو ناصر) tribe. His mother, Subha Tulfah al-Mussallat, named her newborn son ''[[Saddam (name)|Saddam]]'', which in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] means "One who confronts". He is always referred to{{clarify|"Always" in what context? And by whom?|date=September 2017}} by this [[Arabic name|personal name]], which may be followed by the patronymic and other elements. -->Saddam's brother and father died of cancer before his birth. These deaths made Saddam's mother, Subha Tulfah al-Mussallat, so depressed that she attempted to [[abortion|abort]] her pregnancy and commit [[suicide]]. When her son was born, Subha "would have nothing to do with him," and Saddam was taken in by an uncle.<ref name="ref5">{{cite news |last1=Bumiller |first1=Elisabeth |author-link1=Elisabeth Bumiller |date=15 May 2004 |title=Was a Tyrant Prefigured by Baby Saddam? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/15/books/was-a-tyrant-prefigured-by-baby-saddam.html |url-status=live |work=[[The New York Times]]  |issn=1553-8095 |oclc=1645522 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911052637/https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/15/books/was-a-tyrant-prefigured-by-baby-saddam.html |archive-date=11 September 2016 |access-date=21 November 2018}}</ref>

His mother remarried, and Saddam gained three half-brothers through this marriage. His stepfather, Ibrahim al-Hassan, treated Saddam harshly after his return. At about age 10, Saddam fled the family and returned to live in [[Baghdad]] with his uncle [[Khairallah Talfah]], who became a father figure to Saddam.<ref name="Karsh 13–15"/> Talfah, the father of Saddam's future wife, was a devout [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Muslim and a veteran of the 1941 [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] between [[Iraqi nationalism|Iraqi nationalists]] and the [[United Kingdom]], which remained a major colonial power in the region.<ref>Eric Davis, ''Memories of State: Politics, History, and Collective Identity in Modern Iraq'', [[University of California Press]], 2005.</ref> Talfah later became the mayor of Baghdad during Saddam's time in power, until his notorious corruption compelled Saddam to force him out of office.<ref name="Karsh 13–15">{{cite book|author-link1=Efraim Karsh|last1=Karsh|first1=Efraim|last2=Rautsi|first2=Inari|title=Saddam Hussein: A Political Biography|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8021-3978-8|pages=13–15}}</ref>

Later in his life, relatives from his native [[Tikrit]] became some of his closest advisors and supporters. Under the guidance of his uncle, he attended a nationalistic high school in Baghdad. After secondary school, Saddam studied at an Iraqi law school for three years, dropping out in 1957 at the age of 20 to join the revolutionary pan-Arab [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]], of which his uncle was a supporter. During this time, Saddam apparently supported himself as a secondary school teacher.<ref>{{cite book|last=Batatu |first=Hanna |author-link=Hanna Batatu |title=The Old Social Classes & The Revolutionary Movement in Iraq |year=1979 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=0-691-05241-7}}</ref> Ba'athist ideology originated in [[Syria]] and the Ba'ath Party had a large following in Syria at the time, but in 1955 there were fewer than 300 Ba'ath Party members in Iraq and it is believed that Saddam's primary reason for joining the party as opposed to the more established Iraqi nationalist parties was his familial connection to [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] and other leading Ba'athists through his uncle.<ref name="Karsh 13–15"/>

[[File:SaddamCairo.jpg|thumb|Saddam Hussein and the [[Ba'ath Party]] student cell, [[Cairo]], in the period 1959–1963]]
Revolutionary sentiment was characteristic of the era in Iraq and throughout the Middle East. In Iraq [[progressivism|progressives]] and [[Socialism|socialists]] assailed traditional political elites (colonial-era bureaucrats and landowners, wealthy merchants and tribal chiefs, and monarchists).<ref>R. Stephen Humphreys, ''Between Memory and Desire: The Middle East in a Troubled Age'', University of California Press, 1999, p. 68.</ref> Moreover, the pan-Arab nationalism of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in Egypt profoundly influenced young Ba'athists like Saddam. The rise of Nasser foreshadowed a wave of revolutions throughout the Middle East in the 1950s and 1960s, with the collapse of the monarchies of [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Kingdom of Libya|Libya]]. Nasser inspired nationalists throughout the Middle East by fighting the [[British Army|British]] and the [[French Army|French]] during the [[Suez Crisis|Suez Crisis of 1956]], modernizing Egypt, and uniting the [[Arab world]] politically.<ref>Humphreys, 68</ref>

In 1958, a year after Saddam had joined the Ba'ath party, army officers led by General [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] overthrew [[Faisal II of Iraq]] in the [[14 July Revolution]].

Of the 16 members of Qasim's cabinet, 12 were Ba'ath Party members; however, the party turned against Qasim due to his refusal to join [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR).<ref name="iraqfirst">{{cite book |author=Coughlin, Con |pages=[https://archive.org/details/saddam00conc/page/24 24–25] |title=Saddam: His Rise and Fall |publisher=[[Harper Perennial]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-06-050543-5 |author-link=Con Coughlin |url=https://archive.org/details/saddam00conc/page/24 }}</ref> To strengthen his own position within the government, Qasim created an alliance with the [[Iraqi Communist Party]], which was opposed to any notion of pan-Arabism.<ref>{{cite book |author=Coughlin, Con |pages=[https://archive.org/details/saddam00conc/page/25 25–26] |title=Saddam: His Rise and Fall |publisher=[[Harper Perennial]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-06-050543-5 |author-link=Con Coughlin |url=https://archive.org/details/saddam00conc/page/25 }}</ref> Later that year, the Ba'ath Party leadership was planning to assassinate Qasim. Saddam was a leading member of the operation. At the time, the Ba'ath Party was more of an ideological experiment than a strong anti-government fighting machine. The majority of its members were either educated professionals or students, and Saddam fit the bill.<ref>{{cite book |author=Coughlin, Con |page=[https://archive.org/details/saddam00conc/page/26 26] |title=Saddam: His Rise and Fall |publisher=[[Harper Perennial]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-06-050543-5 |author-link=Con Coughlin |url=https://archive.org/details/saddam00conc/page/26 }}</ref> The choice of Saddam was, according to journalist [[Con Coughlin]], "hardly surprising." The idea of assassinating Qasim may have been Nasser's, and there is speculation that some of those who participated in the operation received training in [[Damascus]], which was then part of the UAR. However, "no evidence has ever been produced to implicate Nasser directly in the plot."<ref>{{cite book |author=Coughlin, Con |page=[https://archive.org/details/saddam00conc/page/27 27] |title=Saddam: His Rise and Fall |publisher=[[Harper Perennial]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-06-050543-5 |author-link=Con Coughlin |url=https://archive.org/details/saddam00conc/page/27 }}</ref> Saddam himself is not believed to have received any training outside of Iraq, as he was a late addition to the assassination team.<ref>{{cite book|last=Osgood|first=Kenneth|title=America and Iraq: Policy-making, Intervention and Regional Politics|chapter=Eisenhower and regime change in Iraq: the United States and the Iraqi Revolution of 1958|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2009|isbn=9781134036721|page=22}}</ref>

The assassins planned to ambush Qasim at Al-Rashid Street on 7 October 1959: one man was to kill those sitting at the back of the car, the rest killing those in front. During the ambush it is claimed that Saddam began shooting prematurely, which disorganized the whole operation. Qasim's chauffeur was killed, and Qasim was hit in the arm and shoulder. The assassins believed they had killed him and quickly retreated to their headquarters, but Qasim survived. At the time of the attack the Ba'ath Party had fewer than 1,000 members.<ref>{{cite book |author=Coughlin, Con |page=[https://archive.org/details/saddam00conc/page/30 30] |title=Saddam: His Rise and Fall |publisher=[[Harper Perennial]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-06-050543-5 |author-link=Con Coughlin |url=https://archive.org/details/saddam00conc/page/30 }}</ref> Saddam's role in the failed assassination became a crucial part of his public image for decades. [[Kanan Makiya]] recounts:
<blockquote>The man and the myth merge in this episode. His biography—and Iraqi television, which stages the story ad nauseam—tells of his familiarity with guns from the age of ten; his fearlessness and loyalty to the party during the 1959 operation; his bravery in saving his comrades by commandeering a car at gunpoint; the bullet that was gouged out of his flesh under his direction in hiding; the iron discipline that led him to draw a gun on weaker comrades who would have dropped off a seriously wounded member of the hit team at a hospital; the calculating shrewdness that helped him save himself minutes before the police broke in leaving his wounded comrades behind; and finally the long trek of a wounded man from house to house, city to town, across the desert to refuge in [[Syria]].<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Kanan Makiya|last=Makiya|first=Kanan|title=Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq, Updated Edition|url=https://archive.org/details/republicoffearpo00maki|url-access=registration|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|isbn=9780520921245|page=[https://archive.org/details/republicoffearpo00maki/page/118 118]}}</ref></blockquote>

Some of the plotters (including Saddam) quickly managed to leave the country for Syria, the spiritual home of Ba'athist ideology. There Saddam was given full membership in the party by [[Michel Aflaq]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Coughlin, Con |page=[https://archive.org/details/saddam00conc/page/33 33] |title=Saddam: His Rise and Fall |publisher=[[Harper Perennial]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-06-050543-5 |author-link=Con Coughlin |url=https://archive.org/details/saddam00conc/page/33 }}</ref> Some members of the operation were arrested and taken into [[Police custody|custody]] by the Iraqi government. At the [[show trial]], six of the defendants were given [[death sentence]]s; for unknown reasons the sentences were not carried out. Aflaq, the leader of the Ba'athist movement, organized the expulsion of leading Iraqi Ba'athist members, such as [[Fuad al-Rikabi]], on the grounds that the party should not have initiated the attempt on Qasim's life. At the same time, Aflaq secured seats in the Iraqi Ba'ath leadership for his supporters, one of them being Saddam.<ref>{{cite book |author=Coughlin, Con |page=[https://archive.org/details/saddam00conc/page/34 34] |title=Saddam: His Rise and Fall |publisher=[[Harper Perennial]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-06-050543-5 |author-link=Con Coughlin |url=https://archive.org/details/saddam00conc/page/34 }}</ref> Saddam moved from Syria to Egypt itself in February 1960, and he continued to live there until 1963, graduating from high school in 1961 and unsuccessfully pursuing a law degree.<ref>{{cite book|author-link1=Efraim Karsh|last1=Karsh|first1=Efraim|last2=Rautsi|first2=Inari|title=Saddam Hussein: A Political Biography|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8021-3978-8|pages=15–22}}</ref>

Army officers with ties to the Ba'ath Party overthrew Qasim in the [[Ramadan Revolution]] coup of February 1963. Ba'athist leaders were appointed to the cabinet and [[Abdul Salam Arif]] became president. Arif dismissed and arrested the Ba'athist leaders later that year in the [[November 1963 Iraqi coup d'état]]. Being exiled in Egypt at the time, Saddam played no role in the 1963 coup or the brutal anti-communist purge that followed; although he returned to Iraq after the coup, Saddam remained "on the fringes of the newly installed Ba'thi administration and [had] to content himself with the minor position of a member of the Party's central bureau for peasants," in the words of [[Efraim Karsh]] and Inari Rautsi.<ref>{{cite book|author-link1=Efraim Karsh|last1=Karsh|first1=Efraim|last2=Rautsi|first2=Inari|title=Saddam Hussein: A Political Biography|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8021-3978-8|pages=22–23}}</ref> Unlike during the Qasim years, Saddam remained in Iraq following Arif's anti-Ba'athist purge in November 1963, and became involved in planning to assassinate Arif. In marked contrast to Qasim, Saddam knew that he faced no death penalty from Arif's government and knowingly accepted the risk of being arrested rather than fleeing to Syria again.

In July 1968, Saddam participated in a [[17 July Revolution|bloodless coup]] led by [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] that overthrew [[Abdul Rahman Arif]], Salam Arif's brother and successor. While Saddam's role in the coup was not hugely significant (except in the official account), Saddam planned and carried out the subsequent purge of the non-Ba'athist faction led by [[List of Prime Ministers of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Abd ar-Razzaq an-Naif]], whose support had been essential to the coup's success.<ref>{{cite book|author-link1=Efraim Karsh|last1=Karsh|first1=Efraim|last2=Rautsi|first2=Inari|title=Saddam Hussein: A Political Biography|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8021-3978-8|pages=27–35}}</ref> According to a semi-official biography, Saddam personally led Naif at gunpoint to the plane that escorted him out of Iraq.<ref>{{cite book|author-link1=Efraim Karsh|last1=Karsh|first1=Efraim|last2=Rautsi|first2=Inari|title=Saddam Hussein: A Political Biography|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8021-3978-8|pages=33–34}}</ref> Arif was given refuge in London and then [[Istanbul]]. Al-Bakr was named president and Saddam was named his deputy, and deputy chairman of the Ba'athist [[Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]]. According to biographers, Saddam never forgot the tensions within the first Ba'athist government, which formed the basis for his measures to promote Ba'ath party unity as well as his resolve to maintain power and programs to ensure social stability. Although Saddam was al-Bakr's deputy, he was a strong behind-the-scenes party politician. Al-Bakr was the older and more prestigious of the two, but by 1969 Saddam clearly had become the moving force behind the party.

===Political program===
[[File:Saddam1970s.jpg|thumb|Promoting women's literacy and education in the 1970s]]

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, as vice chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, formally al-Bakr's second-in-command, Saddam built a reputation as a progressive, effective politician.<ref>CNN, "Hussein was symbol of autocracy, cruelty in Iraq," 30 December 2003. [http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/12/29/hussein.obit/index.html]</ref> At this time, Saddam moved up the ranks in the new government by aiding attempts to strengthen and unify the Ba'ath party and taking a leading role in addressing the country's major domestic problems and expanding the party's following.

After the Ba'athists took power in 1968, Saddam focused on attaining stability in a nation riddled with profound tensions. Long before Saddam, Iraq had been split along social, ethnic, religious, and economic fault lines: Sunni versus [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]], Arab versus [[Kurds|Kurd]], tribal chief versus urban merchant, nomad versus peasant.<ref name="Humphreys, 78">Humphreys, 78</ref> The desire for stable rule in a country rife with [[Political faction|factionalism]] led Saddam to pursue both massive repression and the improvement of living standards.<ref name="Humphreys, 78" />

Saddam actively fostered the modernization of the Iraqi economy along with the creation of a strong security apparatus to prevent coups within the power structure and insurrections apart from it. Ever concerned with broadening his base of support among the diverse elements of Iraqi society and mobilizing mass support, he closely followed the administration of state welfare and development programs.

At the center of this strategy was Iraq's oil. On 1 June 1972, Saddam oversaw the seizure of international oil interests, which, at the time, dominated the country's oil sector. A year later, world oil prices rose dramatically as a result of the [[1973 energy crisis]], and skyrocketing revenues enabled Saddam to expand his agenda.

[[File:Baath Party founder Michel Aflaq with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 1988.jpg|thumb|left|Saddam talking to [[Michel Aflaq]], the founder of [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist thought]], in 1988]]
Within just a few years, Iraq was providing social services that were unprecedented among Middle Eastern countries. Saddam established and controlled the "National Campaign for the Eradication of Illiteracy" and the campaign for "Compulsory Free Education in Iraq," and largely under his auspices, the government established universal free schooling up to the highest education levels; hundreds of thousands learned to read in the years following the initiation of the program. The government also supported families of soldiers, granted free hospitalization to everyone, and gave subsidies to farmers. Iraq created one of the most modernized public-health systems in the Middle East, earning Saddam an award from the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO).<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news2/indepth/words/saddam_hussein.html Saddam Hussein], CBC News, 29 December 2006</ref><ref>Jessica Moore, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030625145156/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/iraq/war/player1.html The Iraq War player profile: Saddam Hussein's Rise to Power], PBS Online Newshour {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115205745/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/iraq/war/player1.html |date=15 November 2013 }}</ref>

With the help of increasing oil revenues, Saddam diversified the largely oil-based [[economy of Iraq|Iraqi economy]]. Saddam implemented a national infrastructure campaign that made great progress in building roads, promoting mining, and developing other industries. The campaign helped Iraq's energy industries. Electricity was brought to nearly every city in Iraq, and many outlying areas. Before the 1970s, most of Iraq's people lived in the countryside and roughly two-thirds were peasants. This number would decrease quickly during the 1970s as global oil prices helped revenues to rise from less than a half billion dollars to tens of billions of dollars and the country invested into industrial expansion.

The oil revenue benefited Saddam politically.<ref name="economist2007">{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/8492668 | title=Saddam Hussein&nbsp;– The blundering dictator |date=4 January 2007 |work=[[The Economist]]}}</ref> According to ''[[The Economist]]'', "Much as Adolf Hitler won early praise for galvanizing German industry, ending mass unemployment and building autobahns, Saddam earned admiration abroad for his deeds. He had a good instinct for what the "[[Arab street]]" demanded, following the decline in Egyptian leadership brought about by the trauma of Israel's six-day victory in the 1967 war, the death of the pan-Arabist hero, Gamal Abdul Nasser, in 1970, and the "traitorous" drive by his successor, Anwar Sadat, to sue for peace with the Jewish state. Saddam's self-aggrandizing propaganda, with himself posing as the defender of Arabism against Jewish or [[Iran|Persian]] intruders, was heavy-handed, but consistent as a drumbeat. It helped, of course, that his [[Iraqi Intelligence Service|mukhabarat]] (secret police) put dozens of Arab news editors, writers and artists on the payroll."<ref name="economist2007"/>

In 1972, Saddam signed a 15-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the [[Soviet Union]]. According to historian [[Charles R. H. Tripp]], the treaty upset "the U.S.-sponsored security system established as part of the [[Cold War]] in the Middle East.

Saddam focused on fostering loyalty to the Ba'athists in the rural areas. After nationalizing foreign oil interests, Saddam supervised the modernization of the countryside, mechanizing agriculture on a large scale, and distributing land to peasant farmers.<ref name="ref6">Khadduri, Majid. ''Socialist Iraq''. The Middle East Institute, Washington, D.C., 1978.</ref> The Ba'athists established farm cooperatives and the government also doubled expenditures for agricultural development in 1974–1975.

Lending was based on cronyism.<ref name="economist2004"/> Development went forward at such a fevered pitch that two million people from other Arab countries and even [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] worked in Iraq to meet the growing demand for labor.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Succession===
In 1976, Saddam rose to the position of general in the Iraqi armed forces, and rapidly became the [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]] of the government. As the ailing, elderly al-Bakr became unable to execute his duties, Saddam took on an increasingly prominent role as the face of the government both internally and externally. He soon became the architect of Iraq's foreign policy and represented the nation in all diplomatic situations. He was the ''de facto'' leader of Iraq some years before he formally came to power in 1979. He slowly began to consolidate his power over Iraq's government and the Ba'ath party. Relationships with fellow party members were carefully cultivated, and Saddam soon accumulated a powerful circle of support within the party.

In 1979, al-Bakr started to make treaties with Syria, also under Ba'athist leadership, that would lead to unification between the two countries. Syrian President [[Hafez al-Assad]] would become deputy leader in a union, and this would drive Saddam to obscurity. Saddam acted to secure his grip on power. He forced the ailing al-Bakr to resign on 16 July 1979, and formally assumed the presidency.

====1979 Ba'ath Party Purge====
{{main|1979 Ba'ath Party Purge}}
Saddam convened an assembly of Ba'ath party leaders on 22 July 1979. During the assembly, which he ordered videotaped,<ref>{{YouTube|VHBF8EKt-zc|A Documentary on Saddam Hussein 5}}</ref> Saddam claimed to have found a [[fifth column]] within the Ba'ath Party and directed Muhyi Abdel-Hussein to read out a confession and the names of 68 alleged co-conspirators. These members were labelled "disloyal" and were removed from the room one by one and taken into custody. After the list was read, Saddam congratulated those still seated in the room for their past and future loyalty. The 68 people arrested at the meeting were subsequently tried together and found guilty of [[treason]]. 22 were sentenced to execution. Other high-ranking members of the party formed the firing squad. By 1 August 1979, hundreds of high-ranking Ba'ath party members had been executed.<ref>Bay Fang.

Iraqi society fissures along lines of language, religion and ethnicity. The Ba'ath Party, secular by nature, adopted Pan-Arab ideologies which in turn were problematic for significant parts of the population. Following the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, Iraq faced the prospect of régime change from two Shi'ite factions ([[Islamic Dawa Party|Dawa]] and [[Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq|SCIRI]]) which aspired to model Iraq on its neighbour Iran as a Shia theocracy. A separate threat to Iraq came from parts of the ethnic Kurdish population of [[Iraqi Kurdistan|northern Iraq]] which opposed being part of an Iraqi state and favored independence (an ongoing ideology which had preceded Ba'ath Party rule). To alleviate the threat of revolution, Saddam afforded certain benefits to the potentially hostile population. Membership in the Ba'ath Party remained open to all Iraqi citizens regardless of background. However, repressive measures were taken against its opponents.<ref name="Iraq: A Country Study">Helen Chapin Metz (ed) ''[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/iqtoc.html Iraq: A Country Study:]'' "[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+iq0115) Internal Security in the 1980s"], [[Library of Congress Country Studies]], 1988</ref>

The major instruments for accomplishing this control were the paramilitary and police organizations. Beginning in 1974, [[Taha Yassin Ramadan]] (himself a Kurdish Ba'athist), a close associate of Saddam, commanded the [[Popular Army (Iraq)|People's Army]], which had responsibility for internal security. As the Ba'ath Party's paramilitary, the People's Army acted as a counterweight against any coup attempts by the regular armed forces. In addition to the People's Army, the Department of General Intelligence was the most notorious arm of the state-security system, feared for its use of [[torture]] and assassination. [[Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti]], Saddam's younger [[Sibling|half-brother]], commanded Mukhabarat. Foreign observers believed that from 1982 this department operated both at home and abroad in its mission to seek out and eliminate Saddam's perceived opponents.<ref name="Iraq: A Country Study" />

Saddam was notable for using terror against his own people. ''The Economist'' described Saddam as "one of the last of the 20th century's great dictators, but not the least in terms of egotism, or cruelty, or morbid will to power."<ref name="economist2007"/> Saddam's regime brought about the deaths of at least 250,000 Iraqis<ref name=250k>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2004/01/25/war-iraq-not-humanitarian-intervention|title=War in Iraq: Not a Humanitarian Intervention|work=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=25 January 2004|access-date=31 May 2017|quote=Having devoted extensive time and effort to documenting [Saddam's] atrocities, we estimate that in the last twenty-five years of Ba'ath Party rule the Iraqi government murdered or 'disappeared' some quarter of a million Iraqis, if not more.}}</ref> and committed [[war crime]]s in Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.

==Political and cultural image==
[[File:Al-Qadissiya 6.jpg|thumb|upright|Propaganda art to glorify Saddam after [[Iran–Iraq War]], 1988.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}]]
As a sign of his consolidation of power, Saddam's [[personality cult]] pervaded Iraqi society. He had thousands of portraits, posters, statues and murals erected in his honor all over Iraq. His face could be seen on the sides of office buildings, schools, airports, and shops, as well as on Iraqi currency. Saddam's personality cult reflected his efforts to appeal to the various elements in Iraqi society. This was seen in his variety of apparel: he appeared in the costumes of the [[Bedouin]], the traditional clothes of the Iraqi peasant (which he essentially wore during his childhood), and even [[Kurdish clothing]], but also appeared in Western suits fitted by his favorite tailor, projecting the image of an urbane and modern leader. Sometimes he would also be portrayed as a devout Muslim, wearing full headdress and robe, praying toward [[Mecca]].

He also conducted two [[show election]]s, in 1995 and 2002. In the [[1995 Iraqi presidential referendum|1995 referendum]], conducted on 15 October, he reportedly received 99.96% of the votes in a 99.47% turnout, getting only 3,052 negative votes among an electorate of 8.4&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/17/world/no-surprise-in-iraqi-vote.html |title=No surprise in Iraqi vote |work=The New York Times |access-date=29 January 2012 |date=17 October 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6507/is_4_57/ai_n28932894/ |title=Iraq – July 22 – Saddam Plans Referendum |publisher=FindArticles |access-date=29 January 2012 |year=2002 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715194635/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6507/is_4_57/ai_n28932894/ |archive-date=15 July 2012 }}</ref> In the [[2002 Iraqi presidential referendum|15 October 2002 referendum]] he officially achieved 100% of approval votes and 100% turnout, as the electoral commission reported the next day that every one of the 11,445,638 eligible voters cast a "Yes" vote for the president.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2331951.stm |title=Saddam 'wins 100% of vote' |publisher=BBC |access-date=29 January 2012 |date=16 October 2002}}</ref>

==Foreign affairs==
{{See also|Foreign relations of Iraq}}
Iraq's relations with the Arab world have been extremely varied. Relations between Iraq and Egypt violently ruptured in 1977, when the two nations broke relations with each other following Iraq's criticism of Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]]'s peace initiatives with [[Israel]]. In 1978, Baghdad hosted an [[Arab League]] summit that condemned and ostracized Egypt for accepting the [[Camp David Accords]]. However, Egypt's strong material and diplomatic support for Iraq in the war with Iran led to warmer relations and numerous contacts between senior officials, despite the continued absence of ambassadorial-level representation. Since 1983, Iraq has repeatedly called for restoration of Egypt's "natural role" among Arab countries.

Saddam developed a reputation for liking expensive goods, such as his diamond-coated [[Rolex]] wristwatch, and sent copies of them to his friends around the world. To his ally [[Kenneth Kaunda]] Saddam once sent a Boeing 747 full of presents—rugs, televisions, ornaments.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Saddam enjoyed a close relationship with Russian intelligence agent [[Yevgeny Primakov]] that dated back to the 1960s; Primakov may have helped Saddam to stay in power in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=28397&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=226 |title=Saving Saddam&nbsp;– the sequel? |date=4 March 2003 |publisher=The Jamestown Foundation}}</ref>

Saddam visited only two Western countries. The first visit took place in December 1974, when the dictator of [[Spain]], [[Francisco Franco]], invited him to [[Madrid]] and he visited [[Granada]], [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2003/03/02/domingo/1046580756_850215.html|title=Reportaje &#124; El obsequio de Sadam a Franco|first=Ediciones El|last=País|newspaper=El País|date=2 March 2003|via=elpais.com}}</ref> In September 1975 he met with Prime Minister [[Jacques Chirac]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].<ref name="The Chirac Doctrine"/>

Several Iraqi leaders, Lebanese arms merchant [[Sarkis Soghanalian]] and others have claimed that Saddam financed Chirac's party. In 1991 Saddam threatened to expose those who had taken largesse from him: "From Mr. Chirac to Mr. Chevènement, politicians and economic leaders were in open competition to spend time with us and flatter us. We have now grasped the reality of the situation. If the trickery continues, we will be forced to unmask them, all of them, before the French public."<ref name="The Chirac Doctrine">{{cite journal |url=http://www.meforum.org/772/the-chirac-doctrine |title=The Chirac Doctrine |journal=The Middle East Quarterly |date=Fall 2005|last1=Guitta |first1=Olivier }}</ref> France armed Saddam and it was Iraq's largest trade partner throughout Saddam's rule. Seized documents show how French officials and businessmen close to Chirac, including [[Charles Pasqua]], his former interior minister, personally benefitted from the deals with Saddam.<ref name="The Chirac Doctrine" />

Because Saddam Hussein rarely left Iraq, [[Tariq Aziz]], one of Saddam's aides, traveled abroad extensively and represented Iraq at many diplomatic meetings.<ref>Healy, Jack. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/world/middleeast/27iraq.html?ref=world Iraq Court Sentences Tariq Aziz to Death]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. 26 October 2010. Retrieved on 26 October 2010.</ref> In foreign affairs, Saddam sought to have Iraq play a leading role in the Middle East. Iraq signed an aid pact with the Soviet Union in 1972, and arms were sent along with several thousand advisers. However, the 1978 crackdown on [[Communist Party of Iraq|Iraqi Communists]] and a shift of trade toward the West strained Iraqi relations with the Soviet Union; Iraq then took on a more Western orientation until the [[Gulf War]] in 1991.<ref>Helen Chapin Metz (ed) ''[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/iqtoc.html Iraq: A Country Study:]'' "[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+iq0083) The West"], [[Library of Congress Country Studies]], 1988</ref>

After the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] of 1973, France had changed to a more pro-Arab policy and was accordingly rewarded by Saddam with closer ties. He made a state visit to France in 1975, cementing close ties with some French business and ruling political circles. In 1975 Saddam negotiated an accord with Iran that contained Iraqi concessions on border disputes. In return, Iran agreed to stop supporting opposition Kurds in Iraq. Saddam led Arab opposition to the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel (1979).

Saddam initiated Iraq's nuclear enrichment project in the 1980s, with French assistance. The first Iraqi nuclear reactor was named by the French "[[Osirak]]." Osirak was destroyed on 7 June 1981<ref name="Osirak">BBC, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/7/newsid_3014000/3014623.stm 1981: Israel bombs Baghdad nuclear reactor], ''BBC On This Day 7 June 1981'' referenced 6 January 2007</ref> by an Israeli air strike ([[Operation Opera]]).

Nearly from its founding as a modern state in 1920, Iraq has had to deal with Kurdish separatists in the northern part of the country.<ref>Humphreys, 120</ref> Saddam did negotiate an agreement in 1970 with separatist Kurdish leaders, giving them autonomy, but the agreement broke down. The result was brutal fighting between the government and Kurdish groups and even Iraqi bombing of Kurdish villages in Iran, which caused Iraqi relations with Iran to deteriorate. However, after Saddam had negotiated the 1975 treaty with Iran, the Shah withdrew support for the Kurds, who suffered a total defeat.

{{See also|United States support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq war}}[[File:Cardoen Saddam.jpg|thumb|Saddam greeting [[Carlos Cardoen]], a Chilean businessman who provided Iraq with weapons during the war in the 1980s]]In early 1979, Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown by the [[History of Iran#Islamic Revolution|Islamic Revolution]], thus giving way to an Islamic republic led by the [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]]. The influence of revolutionary Shi'ite Islam grew apace in the region, particularly in countries with large Shi'ite populations, especially Iraq. Saddam feared that radical Islamic ideas—hostile to his secular rule—were rapidly spreading inside his country among the majority Shi'ite population.

There had also been bitter enmity between Saddam and Khomeini since the 1970s. Khomeini, having been exiled from Iran in 1964, took up residence in Iraq, at the Shi'ite holy city of [[An Najaf]]. There he involved himself with Iraqi Shi'ites and developed a strong, worldwide religious and political following against the Iranian Government, which Saddam tolerated. However, when Khomeini began to urge the Shi'ites there to overthrow Saddam and under pressure from the Shah, who had agreed to a rapprochement between Iraq and Iran in 1975, Saddam agreed to expel Khomeini in 1978 to France. However this turned out to be an imminent failure and a political catalyst, for Khomeini had access to more media connections and also collaborated with a much larger Iranian community under his support which he used to his advantage.

After Khomeini gained power, skirmishes between Iraq and revolutionary Iran occurred for ten months over the sovereignty of the disputed [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway, which divides the two countries. During this period, Saddam Hussein publicly maintained that it was in Iraq's interest not to engage with Iran, and that it was in the interests of both nations to maintain peaceful relations. However, in a private meeting with Salah Omar al-Ali, Iraq's permanent ambassador to [[United Nations|the United Nations]], he revealed that he intended to invade and occupy a large part of Iran within months. Later (probably to appeal for support from the United States and most Western nations), he would make toppling the Islamic government one of his intentions as well.<ref name="PIRRR">Esposito, John, "Political Islam Revolution, Radicalism, or Reform", ''Political Islam and Gulf Security'', Lynne Rienner Publishers, {{ISBN|1-55587-262-X}}, pp. 56–58</ref>

Iraq invaded Iran, first attacking [[Mehrabad Airport]] of [[Tehran]] and then entering the oil-rich Iranian land of [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], which also has a sizable Arab minority, on 22 September 1980 and declared it a new province of Iraq. With the support of the Arab states, the United States, and Europe, and heavily financed by the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Saddam Hussein had become "the defender of the Arab world" against a revolutionary Iran. The only exception was the Soviet Union, who initially refused to supply Iraq on the basis of neutrality in the conflict, although in his memoirs, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] claimed that [[Leonid Brezhnev]] refused to aid Saddam over infuriation of Saddam's treatment of Iraqi communists. Consequently, many viewed Iraq as "an agent of the civilized world."<ref name="PIRRR" /> The blatant disregard of international law and violations of international borders were ignored. Instead Iraq received economic and military support from its allies, who overlooked Saddam's use of chemical warfare against the Kurds and the Iranians, in addition to Iraq's efforts to develop nuclear weapons.<ref name="PIRRR" />

In the first days of the war, there was heavy ground fighting around strategic ports as Iraq launched an attack on Khuzestan. After making some initial gains, Iraq's troops began to suffer losses from [[human wave attack]]s by Iran. By 1982, Iraq was on the defensive and looking for ways to end the war.

At this point, Saddam asked his ministers for candid advice. Health Minister Dr. Riyadh Ibrahim suggested that Saddam temporarily step down to promote peace negotiations. Initially, Saddam Hussein appeared to take in this opinion as part of his cabinet democracy. A few weeks later, Dr. Ibrahim was sacked when held responsible for a fatal incident in an Iraqi hospital where a patient died from intravenous administration of the wrong concentration of potassium supplement.

Dr. Ibrahim was arrested a few days after he started his new life as a sacked minister. He was known to have publicly declared before that arrest that he was "glad that he got away alive." Pieces of Ibrahim's dismembered body were delivered to his wife the next day.<ref name="Woods">Kevin Woods, James Lacey, and Williamson Murray, [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/61701/kevin-woods-james-lacey-and-williamson-murray/saddams-delusions "Saddam's Delusions: The View From the Inside"], ''Foreign Affairs'', May/June 2006.</ref>

Iraq quickly found itself bogged down in one of the longest and most destructive [[Attrition warfare|wars of attrition]] of the 20th century. During the war, Iraq used [[chemical weapon]]s against Iranian forces fighting on the southern front and Kurdish separatists who were attempting to open up a northern front in Iraq with the help of Iran. These chemical weapons were developed by Iraq from materials and technology supplied primarily by [[West Germany|West German]] companies as well as<ref name="Isa">Dr. Khalil Ibrahim Al Isa, [https://fas.org/nuke/guide/iraq/cw/az120103.html Iraqi Scientist Reports on German, Other Help for Iraq Chemical Weapons Program], ''Al Zaman (London)'', 1 December 2003.</ref> using dual-use technology imported following the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]'s lifting of export restrictions.

Saddam reached out to other Arab governments for cash and political support during the war, particularly after Iraq's oil industry severely suffered at the hands of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy|Iranian navy]] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. Iraq successfully gained some military and financial aid, as well as diplomatic and moral support, from the Soviet Union, China, France, and the United States, which together feared the prospects of the expansion of revolutionary Iran's influence in the region. The Iranians, demanding that the international community should force Iraq to pay war reparations to Iran, refused any suggestions for a cease-fire. Despite several [[United Nations Security Council Resolutions concerning Iraq|calls for a ceasefire]] by the [[United Nations Security Council]], hostilities continued until 20 August 1988.

On 16 March 1988, the Kurdish town of [[Halabja]] was attacked with a mix of [[mustard gas]] and [[nerve agent]]s, killing 5,000 civilians, and maiming, disfiguring, or seriously debilitating 10,000 more.

The bloody eight-year war ended in a stalemate. There were hundreds of thousands of casualties with estimates of up to one million dead. Neither side had achieved what they had originally desired and the borders were left nearly unchanged. The southern, oil rich and prosperous Khuzestan and Basra area (the main focus of the war, and the primary source of their economies) were almost completely destroyed and were left at the pre-1979 border, while Iran managed to make some small gains on its borders in the Northern Kurdish area. Both economies, previously healthy and expanding, were left in ruins.

Saddam borrowed tens of billions of dollars from other Arab states and a few billions from elsewhere during the 1980s to fight Iran, mainly to prevent the expansion of Shi'a radicalism. However, this had proven to completely backfire both on Iraq and on the part of the Arab states, for Khomeini was widely perceived as a hero for managing to defend Iran and maintain the war with little foreign support against the heavily backed Iraq and only managed to boost Islamic radicalism not only within the Arab states, but within Iraq itself, creating new tensions between the Sunni Ba'ath Party and the majority Shi'a population. Faced with rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure and internal resistance, Saddam desperately re-sought cash, this time for postwar reconstruction.

===Al-Anfal Campaign===
{{Main|Al-Anfal Campaign}}

The Al-Anfal Campaign was a genocidal campaign<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2006/08/14/genocide-iraq-anfal-campaign-against-kurds] The Anfal Campaign Against the Kurds.

The campaign takes its name from [[Sura]]t [[al-Anfal]] in the [[Qur'an]], which was used as a [[code name]] by the former Iraqi [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'athist]] administration for a series of attacks against the ''peshmerga'' rebels and the mostly Kurdish civilian population of rural Northern Iraq, conducted between 1986 and 1989 culminating in 1988. This campaign also targeted [[Shabak people|Shabaks]] and [[Yazidi]]s, [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkoman people]] and [[Mandeans]] and many villages belonging to these ethnic groups were also destroyed.

===Tensions with Kuwait===
The end of the war with Iran served to deepen latent tensions between Iraq and its wealthy neighbor Kuwait. Saddam urged the Kuwaitis to waive the Iraqi debt accumulated in the war, some $30 billion, but they refused.<ref name="Humphreys, 105">Humphreys, 105</ref>

Saddam pushed oil-exporting countries to raise oil prices by cutting back production; Kuwait refused, however. In addition to refusing the request, Kuwait spearheaded the opposition in [[OPEC]] to the cuts that Saddam had requested. Kuwait was pumping large amounts of oil, and thus keeping prices low, when Iraq needed to sell high-priced oil from its wells to pay off a huge debt.

Saddam had always argued that Kuwait was historically an integral part of Iraq, and that Kuwait had only come into being through the maneuverings of British imperialism; this echoed a belief that Iraqi nationalists had voiced for the past 50 years. This belief was one of the few articles of faith uniting the political scene in a nation rife with sharp social, ethnic, religious, and ideological divides.<ref name="Humphreys, 105" />

The extent of Kuwaiti oil reserves also intensified tensions in the region. The oil reserves of Kuwait (with a population of 2&nbsp;million next to Iraq's 25) were roughly equal to those of Iraq. Taken together, Iraq and Kuwait sat on top of some 20 percent of the world's known oil reserves; as an article of comparison, [[Saudi Arabia]] holds 25 percent.<ref name="Humphreys, 105"/>

Saddam complained to the [[U.S. State Department]] that Kuwait had slant drilled oil out of wells that Iraq considered to be within its disputed border with Kuwait. Saddam still had an experienced and well-equipped army, which he used to influence regional affairs. He later ordered troops to the Iraq–Kuwait border.

[[File:April Glaspie, Sadoun al-Zubaydi and Saddam Hussein.jpg|thumb|[[United States Ambassador to Iraq|U.S. Ambassador to Iraq]] [[April Glaspie]] meets Saddam for an emergency meeting]]As Iraq-Kuwait relations rapidly deteriorated, Saddam was receiving conflicting information about how the U.S. would respond to the prospects of an invasion.

Reacting to Western criticism in April 1990, Saddam threatened to destroy half of Israel with chemical weapons if it moved against Iraq.<ref>Alan Cowell, [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/03/world/iraq-chief-boasting-of-poison-gas-warns-of-disaster-if-israelis-strike.html?

U.S. ambassador to Iraq [[April Glaspie]] met with Saddam in an emergency meeting on 25 July 1990, where the Iraqi leader attacked American policy with regards to Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates:

:So what can it mean when America says it will now protect its friends? It can only mean prejudice against Iraq. This stance plus maneuvers and statements which have been made has encouraged the UAE and Kuwait to disregard Iraqi rights. If you use pressure, we will deploy pressure and force. We know that you can harm us although we do not threaten you. But we too can harm you. Everyone can cause harm according to their ability and their size. We cannot come all the way to you in the United States, but individual Arabs may reach you. We do not place America among the enemies. We place it where we want our friends to be and we try to be friends. But repeated American statements last year made it apparent that America did not regard us as friends.{{Long quote|date=January 2017}}<ref name="nytimes1990">[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/23/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-excerpts-from-iraqi-document-on-meeting-with-us-envoy.html?

Glaspie replied:

:I know you need funds. We understand that and our opinion is that you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country. But we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait. ... Frankly, we can only see that you have deployed massive troops in the south. Normally that would not be any of our business. But when this happens in the context of what you said on your national day, then when we read the details in the two letters of the Foreign Minister, then when we see the Iraqi point of view that the measures taken by the U.A.E. and Kuwait is, in the final analysis, parallel to military aggression against Iraq, then it would be reasonable for me to be concerned.{{Long quote|date=January 2017}}<ref name="nytimes1990" />

Saddam stated that he would attempt last-ditch negotiations with the Kuwaitis but Iraq "would not accept death."<ref name="nytimes1990" />

U.S. officials attempted to maintain a conciliatory line with Iraq, indicating that while [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[James Baker]] did not want force used, they would not take any position on the Iraq–Kuwait boundary dispute and did not want to become involved.<ref>Greg Palast: ''Armed Madhouse'' Chapter 2, "Plume".</ref>

Later, Iraq and Kuwait met for a final negotiation session, which failed. Saddam then sent his troops into Kuwait. As tensions between Washington and Saddam began to escalate, the Soviet Union, under Mikhail Gorbachev, strengthened its military relationship with the Iraqi leader, providing him military advisers, arms and aid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/dataconvert/pdf/em0280.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923224607/http://www.heritage.org/dataconvert/pdf/em0280.pdf|url-status=dead|title="Bush to Gorbachev: Choose Between Saddam and the West," by Jay P.

==Gulf War==
{{Main|Invasion of Kuwait|Gulf War}}
On 2 August 1990, Saddam invaded Kuwait, initially claiming assistance to "Kuwaiti revolutionaries," thus sparking an international crisis. On 4 August an Iraqi-backed "[[Republic of Kuwait|Provisional Government of Free Kuwait]]" was proclaimed, but a total lack of legitimacy and support for it led to an 8 August announcement of a "merger" of the two countries. On 28 August Kuwait formally became the 19th [[Governorates of Iraq|Governorate]] of Iraq. Just two years after the 1988 Iraq and Iran truce, "Saddam Hussein did what his Gulf patrons had earlier paid him to prevent." Having removed the threat of Iranian fundamentalism he "overran Kuwait and confronted his Gulf neighbors in the name of Arab nationalism and Islam."<ref name="PIRRR" />

When later asked why he invaded Kuwait, Saddam first claimed that it was because Kuwait was rightfully Iraq's 19th province and then said "When I get something into my head I act. That's just the way I am."<ref name="economist2007" /> After Saddam's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, a UN coalition led by the United States drove Iraq's troops from Kuwait in February 1991. The ability for Saddam Hussein to pursue such military aggression was from a "military machine paid for in large part by the tens of billions of dollars Kuwait and the Gulf states had poured into Iraq and the weapons and technology provided by the Soviet Union, Germany, and France."<ref name="PIRRR" />

Shortly before he invaded Kuwait, he shipped 100 new [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] 200 Series cars to top editors in Egypt and Jordan. Two days before the first attacks, Saddam reportedly offered Egypt's [[Hosni Mubarak]] 50 million dollars in cash, "ostensibly for grain."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/002/605fgcob.asp |title=Saddam's Cash |date=5 May 2003 |work=The Weekly Standard |author=Stephen F. Hayes}}</ref>

U.S. President George H. W. Bush responded cautiously for the first several days. On one hand, Kuwait, prior to this point, had been a virulent enemy of Israel and was the Persian Gulf monarchy that had the most friendly relations with the Soviets.<ref>Walter LaFeber, ''Russia, America, and the Cold War'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, p. 358.</ref> On the other hand, Washington foreign policymakers, along with Middle East experts, military critics, and firms heavily invested in the region, were extremely concerned with stability in this region.<ref>For a statement asserting the overriding importance of oil to U.S. national security and the U.S. economy, see, e.g., the declassified document, "Responding to Iraqi Aggression in the Gulf," The White House, National Security Directive (NSD 54), top secret, 15 January 1991. This document can be read on line in [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB21/ George Washington University's National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 21] at [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB21/06-01.htm].</ref> The invasion immediately triggered fears that the world's [[Crude oil#Pricing|price of oil]], and therefore control of the world economy, was at stake. Britain profited heavily from billions of dollars of Kuwaiti investments and bank deposits. Bush was perhaps swayed while meeting with British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who happened to be in the U.S. at the time.<ref>See Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (1979–1990), 817.</ref>

Cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union made possible the passage of resolutions in the United Nations Security Council giving Iraq a deadline to leave Kuwait and approving the use of force if Saddam did not comply with the timetable. U.S. officials feared Iraqi retaliation against oil-rich Saudi Arabia, since the 1940s a close ally of Washington, for the Saudis' opposition to the invasion of Kuwait. Accordingly, the U.S. and a group of allies, including countries as diverse as Egypt, Syria and [[Czechoslovakia]], deployed a massive number of troops along the Saudi border with Kuwait and Iraq in order to encircle the Iraqi army, the largest in the Middle East.

Saddam's officers looted Kuwait, stripping even the marble from its palaces to move it to Saddam's own palace.<ref name="economist2004" />

During the period of negotiations and threats following the invasion, Saddam focused renewed attention on the [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] problem by promising to withdraw his forces from Kuwait if Israel would relinquish the occupied territories in the [[West Bank]], the [[Golan Heights]], and the [[Gaza Strip]]. Saddam's proposal further split the Arab world, pitting U.S.- and Western-supported Arab states against the Palestinians. The allies ultimately rejected any linkage between the Kuwait crisis and Palestinian issues.

Saddam ignored the Security Council deadline. Backed by the Security Council, a U.S.-led coalition launched round-the-clock missile and aerial attacks on Iraq, beginning 16 January 1991. Israel, though subjected to attack by Iraqi missiles, refrained from retaliating in order not to provoke Arab states into leaving the coalition. A ground force consisting largely of U.S. and British armored and infantry divisions ejected Saddam's army from Kuwait in February 1991 and occupied the southern portion of Iraq as far as the [[Euphrates]].<ref>http://milmag.com/2011/02/battle-at-rumaila/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 9 January 2017</ref>

On 6 March 1991, Bush announced "What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea—a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]], where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind: peace and security, freedom, and the rule of law."<ref>http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=19253 Retrieved 9 January 2017</ref>

In the end, the out-numbered and under-equipped Iraqi army proved unable to compete on the battlefield with the highly mobile coalition land forces and their overpowering air support. Some 175,000 Iraqis were taken prisoner and casualties were estimated at over 85,000. As part of the cease-fire agreement, Iraq agreed to scrap all poison gas and [[biological warfare|germ weapons]] and allow UN observers to inspect the sites. UN trade sanctions would remain in effect until Iraq complied with all terms. Saddam publicly claimed victory at the end of the war.

==Post-Gulf war period==
{{Main|1991 uprisings in Iraq}}
[[File:Iraq, Saddam Hussein (222).jpg|thumb|Saddam addresses state television, in January 2001]]
Iraq's ethnic and religious divisions, together with the brutality of the conflict that this had engendered, laid the groundwork for postwar rebellions. In the aftermath of the fighting, social and ethnic unrest among Shi'ite Muslims, Kurds, and dissident military units threatened the stability of Saddam's government. Uprisings erupted in the Kurdish north and Shi'a southern and central parts of Iraq, but were ruthlessly repressed. [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|Uprisings in 1991]] led to the death of 100,000–180,000 people, mostly civilians.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Solomon |title=2 Mass Graves in Iraq Unearthed |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/05/world/fg-graves5 |access-date=23 September 2018 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=5 June 2006}}</ref>

The United States, which had urged Iraqis to rise up against Saddam, did nothing to assist the rebellions. The Iranians, despite the widespread Shi'ite rebellions, had no interest in provoking another war, while [[Turkey]] opposed any prospect of Kurdish independence, and the Saudis and other conservative Arab states feared an Iran-style Shi'ite revolution. Saddam, having survived the immediate crisis in the wake of defeat, was left firmly in control of Iraq, although the country never recovered either economically or militarily from the Gulf War.<ref name="PIRRR" />

Saddam routinely cited his survival as "proof" that Iraq had in fact won the war against the U.S. This message earned Saddam a great deal of popularity in many sectors of the Arab world. John Esposito, however, claims that "Arabs and Muslims were pulled in two directions. That they rallied not so much to Saddam Hussein as to the bipolar nature of the confrontation (the West versus the Arab Muslim world) and the issues that Saddam proclaimed: Arab unity, self-sufficiency, and social justice." As a result, Saddam Hussein appealed to many people for the same reasons that attracted more and more followers to Islamic revivalism and also for the same reasons that fueled [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] feelings.<ref name="PIRRR" />

As one U.S. Muslim observer noted: "People forgot about Saddam's record and concentrated on America ... Saddam Hussein might be wrong, but it is not America who should correct him." A shift was, therefore, clearly visible among many Islamic movements in the post war period "from an initial Islamic ideological rejection of Saddam Hussein, the secular persecutor of Islamic movements, and his invasion of Kuwait to a more populist Arab nationalist, anti-imperialist support for Saddam (or more precisely those issues he represented or championed) and the condemnation of foreign intervention and occupation."<ref name="PIRRR" />

Saddam, therefore, increasingly portrayed himself as a devout Muslim, in an effort to co-opt the conservative religious segments of society. Some elements of [[Sharia]] law were re-introduced, and the ritual phrase "[[Allahu Akbar]]" ("God is great"), in Saddam's handwriting, was added to the national flag. Saddam also commissioned the production of a "[[Blood Qur'an]]," written using 27 litres of his own blood, to thank God for saving him from various dangers and conspiracies.<ref name="BBC-2000">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/941490.stm "Iraqi leader's Koran 'written in blood'"].

===International relations and sanctions on Iraq===
{{main|Sanctions against Iraq}}
The United Nations sanctions placed upon Iraq when it invaded Kuwait were not lifted, blocking Iraqi oil exports. During the late 1990s, the UN considered relaxing the sanctions imposed because of the hardships suffered by ordinary Iraqis.

Relations between the United States and Iraq remained tense following the Gulf War. The U.S. launched a [[Cruise missile strikes on Iraq (June 1993)|missile attack]] aimed at Iraq's intelligence headquarters in Baghdad 26 June 1993, citing evidence of repeated Iraqi violations of the "no fly zones" imposed after the Gulf War and for incursions into Kuwait. U.S. officials continued to accuse Saddam of violating the terms of the Gulf War's cease fire, by developing [[weapons of mass destruction]] and other banned weaponry, and violating the UN-imposed sanctions. Also during the 1990s, President [[Bill Clinton]] maintained sanctions and ordered air strikes in the "Iraqi no-fly zones" ([[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|Operation Desert Fox]]), in the hope that Saddam would be overthrown by political enemies inside Iraq. Western charges of Iraqi resistance to UN access to suspected weapons were the pretext for crises between 1997 and 1998, culminating in intensive U.S. and British missile strikes on Iraq, 16–19 December 1998. After two years of intermittent activity, U.S. and British warplanes struck harder at sites near Baghdad in February 2001.

Saddam continued involvement in politics abroad. Video tapes retrieved after show his intelligence chiefs meeting with Arab journalists, including a meeting with the former managing director of Al-Jazeera, Mohammed Jassem al-Ali, in 2000. In the video Saddam's son Uday advised al-Ali about hires in Al-Jazeera: "During your last visit here along with your colleagues we talked about a number of issues, and it does appear that you indeed were listening to what I was saying since changes took place and new faces came on board such as that lad, Mansour." He was later sacked by Al-Jazeera.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/593ehwjg.asp |title=Uday's Oil-for-News Program |date=16 May 2005 |magazine=The Weekly Standard}}</ref>

In 2002, a resolution sponsored by the [[European Union]] was adopted by the Commission for Human Rights, which stated that there had been no improvement in the human rights crisis in Iraq. The statement condemned President Saddam Hussein's government for its "systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and [[international humanitarian law]]." The resolution demanded that Iraq immediately put an end to its "summary and arbitrary executions ...

Many members of the international community, especially the U.S., continued to view Saddam as a bellicose tyrant who was a threat to the stability of the region. In his January 2002 [[state of the union address]] to Congress, President [[George W. Bush]] spoke of an "[[axis of evil]]" consisting of Iran, North Korea, and Iraq. Moreover, Bush announced that he would possibly take action to topple the Iraqi government, because of the threat of its weapons of mass destruction. Bush stated that "The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop [[anthrax]], and [[nerve gas]], and [[nuclear weapon]]s for over a decade&nbsp;... Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror."<ref>{{cite speech|first=George W.|last=Bush|date=29 January 2002|location=Washington, D.C.|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/stateoftheunion/2002/index.html|title=State of the Union|access-date=31 December 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1790537.stm |title=Full text: State of the Union address |work=BBC News |author=George W.

With war still looming on 24 February 2003, Saddam Hussein took part in [[February 2003 Saddam Hussein interview|an interview]] with [[CBS News]] reporter [[Dan Rather]]. Talking for more than three hours, he denied possessing any weapons of mass destruction, or any other weapons prohibited by UN guidelines. He also expressed a wish to have a live televised debate with [[George W. Bush]], which was declined.

The Iraqi government and military collapsed within three weeks of the beginning of the U.S.-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] on 20 March. By the beginning of April, U.S.-led forces occupied much of Iraq. The resistance of the much-weakened Iraqi Army either crumbled or shifted to [[guerrilla]] tactics, and it appeared that Saddam had lost control of Iraq. He was last seen in a video which purported to show him in the Baghdad suburbs surrounded by supporters.

In April 2003, Saddam's whereabouts remained in question during the weeks following the fall of Baghdad and the conclusion of the major fighting of the war. Various sightings of Saddam were reported in the weeks following the war, but none was authenticated. At various times Saddam released audio tapes promoting popular resistance to his ousting.

Saddam was placed at the top of the "[[U.S. list of most-wanted Iraqis]]." In July 2003, his sons Uday and Qusay and 14-year-old grandson Mustapha were killed in a three-hour gunfight with U.S. forces.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1004168,00.html |title=Dead: the sons of Saddam |access-date=16 July 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=23 July 2003 |author=Julian Borger and Gary Younge}}</ref>

On 13 December 2003, in [[Operation Red Dawn]], Saddam Hussein was captured by American forces after being found hiding in a hole in the ground near a farmhouse in [[ad-Dawr]], near Tikrit.

Saddam was shown with a full beard and hair longer than his familiar appearance. He was described by U.S. officials as being in good health. Bremer reported plans to put Saddam on trial, but claimed that the details of such a trial had not yet been determined. Iraqis and Americans who spoke with Saddam after his capture generally reported that he remained self-assured, describing himself as a "firm, but just leader."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/30/world/middleeast/30saddam.html?pagewanted=all |title=Saddam Hussein, Defiant Dictator Who Ruled Iraq With Violence and Fear, Dies |work=New York Times |access-date =2 September 2014 |date=30 December 2006}}</ref>

On 30 June 2004, Saddam Hussein, held in custody by U.S. forces at the U.S. base "[[Camp Cropper]]," along with 11 other senior Ba'athist leaders, were handed over to the interim Iraqi government to stand trial for [[crimes against humanity]] and other offences.

A few weeks later, he was charged by the [[Iraqi Special Tribunal]] with [[Dujail Massacre|crimes committed against residents of Dujail]] in 1982, following a failed assassination attempt against him. Specific charges included the murder of 148 people, torture of women and children and the illegal arrest of 399 others.<ref name="HRW1">{{cite web|date=19 November 2006 |title=Judging Dujail |work=[[Human Rights Watch]] |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/11112/section/1 |access-date=14 December 2009}}<br />393 members of the pro Iranian Dawa Party (a banned organisation) were arrested as suspects of which 148, including ten children, confessed to taking part in the plot. It is believed more than 40 suspects died during interrogation or while in detention. Those arrested who were found not guilty were either exiled if relatives of the convicted or released and returned to Dujail. Only 96 of the 148 condemned were actually executed, two of the condemned were accidentally released while a third was mistakenly transferred to another prison and survived. The 96 executed included four men mistakenly executed after having been found not guilty and ordered released. The ten children were originally believed to have been among the 96 executed, but they had in fact been imprisoned near the city of Samawah.</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Saddam-Formally-Charged-23683.shtml |title=Saddam Formally Charged |publisher=Softpedia |date=15 May 2006 |access-date=2 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830040133/http://news.softpedia.com/news/Saddam-Formally-Charged-23683.shtml |archive-date=30 August 2007 }}</ref>

* The assassinations and attempted assassinations of several of Saddam's lawyers.
* The replacement of the chief presiding judge midway through the trial.

On 5 November 2006, Saddam Hussein was found guilty of crimes against humanity and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by hanging. Saddam's half-brother, [[Barzan Ibrahim]], and [[Awad Hamed al-Bandar]], head of Iraq's Revolutionary Court in 1982, were convicted of similar charges. The verdict and sentencing were both appealed, but subsequently affirmed by Iraq's Supreme Court of Appeals.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/26/AR2006122600297_pf.html |title=Iraq court upholds Saddam death sentence |agency=Reuters   |date=26 December 2006 |access-date=12 November 2008 |author=Mariam Karouny and Ibon Villelabeitia |work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

Saudi Arabia condemned Iraqi authorities for carrying on with the execution on a holy day.

Saddam's last words during the execution, "May God’s blessings be upon Muhammad and his household. And may God hasten their appearance and curse their enemies." Then one of the crowd repeatedly said the name of the Iraqi Shiite cleric, Moqtada Al-Sadr. Saddam later said, "Do you consider this manhood?" The crowd shouted, "go to Hell." Saddam replied, "To the hell that is Iraq!?"  Again, one of the crowd asked those who shouted to keep quiet for God. Saddam Hussein started recitation of final Muslim prayers, "I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Mohammed is the Messenger of Allah." One of the crowd shouted, "The tyrant [dictator] has collapsed!" Saddam said, "May God’s blessings be upon Mohammed and his household (family)". He recited the shahada one and a half times, as while he was about to say ‘Mohammad’ on the second shahada, the trapdoor opened, cutting him off mid-sentence. The rope broke his neck, killing him immediately.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/01/iraq.iraqtimeline|title=How Saddam died on the gallows|date=1 January 2007|website=the Guardian}}</ref>

Uday, while originally Saddam's favorite son and likely successor, eventually fell out of favor with his father due to his erratic behavior; he was responsible for many car crashes and rapes around Baghdad, constant feuds with other members of his family, and killing his father's favorite valet and food taster [[Kamel Hana Gegeo]] at a party in Egypt honoring Egyptian first lady [[Suzanne Mubarak]]. He became well known in the west for his involvement in looting Kuwait during the Gulf War, allegedly taking millions of dollars worth of gold, cars, and medical supplies (which were in short supply at the time) for himself and close supporters. He was widely known for his paranoia and his obsession with torturing people who disappointed him in any way, which included tardy girlfriends, friends who disagreed with him and, most notoriously, Iraqi athletes who performed poorly. He was briefly married to [[Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri]]'s daughter, but later divorced her. The couple had no children.
** [[Qusay Hussein]] (1966–2003), was Saddam's second—and, after the mid-1990s, his favorite—son. Qusay was believed to have been Saddam's later intended successor, as he was less erratic than his older brother and kept a low profile. He was second in command of the military (behind his father) and ran the elite [[Iraqi Republican Guard]] and the [[Iraqi Special Security Organization|SSO]]. He was believed to have ordered the army to kill thousands of rebelling [[Marsh Arabs]] and was instrumental in suppressing Shi'ite rebellions in the mid-1990s. He was married once and had three children.
** [[Raghad Hussein]] (b. 1968) is Saddam's oldest daughter. After the war, Raghad fled to [[Amman]], Jordan where she received sanctuary from the royal family. She is currently wanted by the [[Iraqi Government]] for allegedly financing and supporting the insurgency of the now banned Iraqi Ba'ath Party.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/02/iraq.main/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205152841/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/02/iraq.main/|date=5 December 2007}}</ref><ref>[http://euronews.net/create_html.php?page=detail_info&article=366962&lng=1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185345/http://euronews.net/create_html.php?page=detail_info&article=366962&lng=1|date=30 September 2007}}</ref> The Jordanian royal family refused to hand her over.
** [[Rana Hussein]] (b. 1969), is Saddam's second daughter. She, like her sister, fled to Jordan and has stood up for her father's rights. She was married to [[Saddam Kamel]] and has had four children from this marriage.
** Hala Hussein (b. 1972), is Saddam's third and youngest daughter. Very little information is known about her. Her father arranged for her to marry General Kamal Mustafa Abdallah Sultan al-Tikriti in 1998. She fled with her children and sisters to [[Jordan]].
* Saddam married his second wife, [[Samira Shahbandar]],<ref name="Sheri & Bob Stritof" /> in 1986. She was originally the wife of an [[Iraqi Airways]] executive, but later became the mistress of Saddam. Eventually, Saddam forced Samira's husband to divorce her so he could marry her.<ref name="Sheri & Bob Stritof"/> After the war, Samira fled to [[Beirut]], Lebanon. She is believed to have mothered Saddam's sixth child.<ref name="Sheri & Bob Stritof"/> Members of Saddam's family have denied this.

* Wafa el-Mullah al-Howeish is rumored to have married Saddam as his fourth wife in 2002. There is no firm evidence for this marriage. Wafa is the daughter of Abdul Tawab el-Mullah Howeish, a former minister of military industry in Iraq and Saddam's last deputy Prime Minister.

In August 1995, Raghad and her husband [[Hussein Kamel al-Majid]] and Rana and her husband, [[Saddam Kamel|Saddam Kamel al-Majid]], defected to [[Jordan]], taking their children with them. They returned to Iraq when they received assurances that Saddam would pardon them. Within three days of their return in February 1996, both of the Kamel brothers were attacked and killed in a gunfight with other clan members who considered them traitors.

In August 2003, Saddam's daughters Raghad and Rana received sanctuary in [[Amman]], Jordan, where they are currently staying with their nine children. That month, they spoke with [[CNN]] and the Arab satellite station [[Al-Arabiya]] in Amman. When asked about her father, Raghad told CNN, "He was a very good father, loving, has a big heart." Asked if she wanted to give a message to her father, she said: "I love you and I miss you." Her sister Rana also remarked, "He had so many feelings and he was very tender with all of us."<ref name="daughtersinterview">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-08-01-saddams-daughters_x.htm |title=Saddam's daughters express love for dad |work=USA Today |date=1 August 2003 |access-date=31 December 2006}}</ref>

With the intention of discrediting Saddam Hussein with his supporters, the [[CIA]] was considering in 2003 before the Iraq War to make a video in which he (Saddam) would be seen having sex with a male teenager.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stein |first=Jeff |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/spy-talk/2010/05/cia_group_had_wacky_ideas_to_d.html |title=SpyTalk – CIA unit's wacky idea: Depict Saddam as gay |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date=25 May 2010 |access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref>

==Philanthropic connection to the city of Detroit, Michigan==
In 1979, Rev. Jacob Yasso of Chaldean Sacred Heart Church congratulated Saddam Hussein on his presidency. In return, Rev. Yasso said that Saddam Hussein donated US$250,000 to his church, which is made up of at least 1,200 families of Middle Eastern descent. In 1980, [[Detroit]] Mayor Coleman Young allowed Rev. Yasso to present the key to the city of Detroit to Saddam Hussein. At the time, Saddam then asked Rev. Yasso, "I heard there was a debt on your church. How much is it?" After the inquiry, Saddam then donated another $200,000 to Chaldean Sacred Heart Church. Rev. Yasso said that Saddam made donations to [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean]] churches all over the world, and even went on record as saying "He's very kind to Christians."<ref name="Key to the City of Detroit">{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/guess-who-got-the-key-to-detroit/ |title=Guess Who Got The Key To Detroit? |work=CBS News |date=26 March 2003 |access-date=22 August 2015}}</ref>
