"'''The Puppy Episode'''" is a two-part episode of the American [[situation comedy]] television series ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''. The episode details lead character Ellen Morgan's realization that she is a [[lesbian]] and her [[coming out]]. It was the 22nd and 23rd episode of the series' 4th season. The episode was written by series star [[Ellen DeGeneres]] with [[Mark Driscoll (screenwriter)|Mark Driscoll]], [[Tracy Newman]], [[Dava Savel]] and [[Jonathan Stark (actor)|Jonathan Stark]] and directed by [[Gil Junger]]. It originally aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on April 30, 1997. The title was used as a code name for Ellen's coming out so as to keep the episode under wraps.

DeGeneres began negotiating with ABC in 1996 to have Morgan come out. When word of the negotiations got out, DeGeneres found herself at the center of intense speculation about when she or her character, or both, would come out. With DeGeneres hinting at her and her character's coming out both off-screen and within the show, the rumors were confirmed when the episode went into production in March 1997.

Despite threats from advertisers and religious groups, "The Puppy Episode" was an enormous ratings success, won multiple awards and became a cultural phenomenon. Nonetheless, DeGeneres and her show quickly garnered criticism for being "too gay"; the series was canceled after one more season and DeGeneres and guest star [[Laura Dern]] faced career backlashes.

==Plot==
Ellen goes out to dinner with her old friend Richard, a reporter who is in town to cover a story. His producer, Susan, joins them for dessert and she and Ellen hit it off. Ellen goes back to Richard's hotel room. He comes on to her and, uncomfortable, Ellen leaves. She runs into Susan in the hall and returns with her to her room. They continue to enjoy each other's company until Susan tells Ellen that she's [[gay]] and that she thought Ellen might be too. Ellen denies it and suggests that Susan is trying to "[[Homosexual recruitment|recruit]]" her. Susan sarcastically says that she'll have to call "national headquarters" and let them know Ellen got away. ("Damn, just one more and I would have gotten that [[toaster oven]].") An agitated Ellen leaves Susan's room and returns to Richard's room, determined to have sex with him to prove to herself she is not gay.

The next day, Ellen tells her friends at the bookstore that she and Richard had amazing sex. She tells her therapist the truth, that she could not have sex with Richard. Ellen laments that she just wants someone with whom she clicks. Her therapist asks if she has ever clicked with anyone and Ellen replies, "Susan."

A message from Richard that he is leaving town ahead of schedule sends Ellen rushing to the airport to see Susan. Ellen tells Susan that she was right and struggles to say the word. Finally, Ellen is able to say, "I'm gay," inadvertently broadcasting her announcement over the airport's [[public address]] system. Ellen assumes that Susan will be leaving with Richard but in fact Susan will be staying in town for several more days.

Ellen has a dream in which she is grocery shopping. She is offered a special lesbian discount on melons, her sexuality is announced to the other shoppers, she is offered a granola bar, she is beckoned toward a checkout lane with a [[Pink triangle|pink triangular]] sign reading "10 lesbians or less" and given her grocery total of "a lesbian twenty-nine" ($11.29). She discusses the dream with her therapist and realizes that she has been suppressing her sexuality for many years. Her therapist encourages her to come out to her friends but Ellen is worried about not being accepted.

Ellen has her friends over to come out to them. Before they arrive, she comes out to her gay neighbor Peter. When everyone else arrives, Ellen balks at telling them but Peter [[outing|outs]] her. Ellen confirms that it is true and her friends are all supportive of her, although her friend Paige is hesitant.

The next day Ellen and Susan are at the bookstore. Susan tells Ellen that she does have feelings for her but she is in a long-term relationship. Ellen is heartbroken and Susan leaves. To cheer her up, her friends take her to a lesbian coffeehouse. There Ellen mistakenly thinks her waitress is coming on to her and is chagrined when a woman flirts with Paige instead of her.

Under the closing credits, Susan leads Ellen over to [[Melissa Etheridge]], who confirms that Ellen is gay and, after completing the necessary paperwork, awards Susan a toaster oven.

==Production==
[[File:EllenDeGeneres1997Emmies.jpg|thumb|upright=.91|Ellen DeGeneres, an Emmy winner, came out, as did her fictional counterpart.]]
By the end of the third season of ''Ellen'', producers were becoming frustrated by the series' lack of focus and the lack of interest that the character Ellen Morgan displayed toward the standard sitcom [[trope (literature)|tropes]] of dating and relationships. Disney boss Michael Eisner suggested that since the character showed no inclination toward dating, she should get a puppy. "It was an indication of just how lost the show was that network executives would be excited by Ellen buying a puppy", said executive producer Mark Driscoll.<ref>{{harvp|Tracy|2005|p=239}}.</ref> It was this suggestion that gave writer Jonathan Stark the idea to give that working title to the episode, and it stuck.<ref name = lo />

In the summer of 1996 DeGeneres and the show's other writers opened negotiations with ABC and its parent company, [[Disney]], to have Ellen Morgan come out during season four. Word of the secret negotiations leaked in September of that year, sparking a storm of speculation as to whether the character, the actress, or both would come out.<ref name = lo /> The LGBT media watchdog group [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) launched a "Let Ellen Out!" campaign, including an "Ellen Watch" website.<ref name = pink>{{cite news

DeGeneres began dropping hints in the episodes leading up to "The Puppy Episode" that she was planning to come out in real life and have her character come out as well, including such [[sight gag]]s as Ellen Morgan stumbling into an actual closet so that she could come out of it. She also invited comment with her off-screen actions, as when she kissed [[k.d. lang]] while presenting her with an award at a [[Los Angeles]] Gay and Lesbian Center function in early 1997.<ref name = tracy248>{{harvp|Tracy|2005|p=248}}.</ref> DeGeneres finally officially came out in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, with an April 14, 1997 cover emblazoned with the words, "Yep, I'm Gay".<ref>{{cite news

==Reception==
"The Puppy Episode" and DeGeneres's attendant coming out generated enormous publicity before the show aired. Right-wing groups like the [[American Family Association]] pressured ABC to drop the storyline and ''Ellen'' sponsors not to advertise; two occasional advertisers, [[J. C. Penney]] and [[Chrysler]], decided not to buy time during the episode. Another sponsor, [[Wendy's]], decided not to advertise on ''Ellen'' again at all.<ref>{{harvp|Tracy|2005|pp=251–52}}.</ref> Despite these losses of potential advertisers, ABC turned away ads from two [[LGBT]]-oriented sponsors, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] (HRC) and lesbian vacation company [[Olivia (company)|Olivia Cruises]].<ref name = cap393 /> [[Jerry Falwell]] called DeGeneres "Ellen Degenerate", to which DeGeneres responded, "I've been getting that since the fourth grade.

In the [[United Kingdom]], "The Puppy Episode" also drew a huge positive reaction and high ratings for [[Channel 4]], the network which carried ''Ellen''. To celebrate the success and DeGeneres' coming out, Channel 4 and talk show host [[Graham Norton]] flew DeGeneres in to London and held a celebration for her and her family. Channel 4 also dedicated an entire night of programming to the LGBT community including DeGeneres herself as part of their "Coming Out Night". DeGeneres was deeply moved by the celebration, and that it meant the world to her to have a network that supported her no matter what.<ref>[https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/video/ellen-degeneres-at-the-glaad-awards-99-at-century-plaza-news-footage/75713743 Glaad Awards 99] Getty Images. Retrieved 28 October 2019.</ref>

Following "The Puppy Episode", ''Ellen'' was renewed for another season. ABC prefaced each episode of season five with a parental advisory warning.<ref>{{harvp|Johnson|2008|p=158}}.</ref> DeGeneres strongly criticized ABC for including the warnings, saying in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', "It was like this voice like you're entering some kind of radiation center. It was very offensive, and you don't think that's going to affect ratings?"<ref name = ew>DeGeneres, quoted in {{harvp|Ehrenstein|1998|p=315}}.</ref> DeGeneres further noted demonstrable hypocrisy on the part of ABC, citing episodes of ABC series ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' and ''[[Spin City]]'' which included two men kissing (the Carey episode was even promoted using the kiss). "There's no disclaimer on [the ''Carey'' show] at all, because it's two [[heterosexual]] men, and they're making fun of heterosexuality...[''Spin City'' aired without a disclaimer] because neither ([[Michael J. Fox]] nor [[Michael Boatman]]) is really gay in real life."<ref name = ew /> Episodes after "The Puppy Episode" dealt with Ellen's coming out to her parents and boss, quitting her job at the bookstore and finding a series of new jobs. Other episodes dealt with her search for a romantic partner and learning more about the LGBT community. Even some gay people began criticizing the amount of gay content in the series, including [[Chaz Bono]],<!--Chaz Bono was not out at the time of the episode, but his identity should be respected. Publication guidelines stipulate that trans individuals should be referred to by their chosen name, see talk for details.--> who was at the time working for GLAAD. Bono was quoted as saying, "[''Ellen''] is so gay it's excluding a large part of our society. A lot of the stuff on it is somewhat of an inside joke. It's one thing to have a gay lead character, but it's another when every episode deals with specific gay issues."<ref>{{cite news
