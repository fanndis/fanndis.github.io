==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Amarillo, Texas}}
Large ranches exist in the Amarillo area: among others, the defunct [[XIT Ranch]] and the still functioning [[JA Ranch]] founded in 1877 by [[Charles Goodnight]] and [[John George Adair]]. Goodnight continued the partnership for a time after Adair's death with Adair's widow, [[Cornelia Adair|Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie Adair]], who was then the sole owner from 1887 until her death in 1921.

During April 1887, J.I. Berry established a site for a town after he chose a well-watered section along the way of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, which had begun building across the Texas Panhandle. Berry and [[Colorado City, Texas]], merchants wanted to make their new town site the region's main trading center. On August 30, 1887, Berry's town site won the [[county seat]] election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the [[railroad]] and [[freight]] service after the county seat election made the town a fast-growing [[cattle]]-marketing center.<ref name="handbook"/>

The settlement originally was called Oneida; it later changed its name to Amarillo, which probably derives from yellow wildflowers that were plentiful during the spring and summer or the nearby Amarillo Lake and Amarillo Creek, named in turn for the yellow soil along their banks and shores (''Amarillo'' is the Spanish word for the color yellow). Early residents originally pronounced the city's name more similar to the Spanish pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˌ|aː|m|ə|ˈ|r|iː|j|oʊ}} {{respell|ah-mə|REE|yoh}}, which was later displaced by the current pronunciation.<ref>Hammond, Clara T., comp. ''Amarillo'' (1974). pg. 6. George Autry, Printer, Amarillo, Texas.</ref>

On June 19, 1888, [[Henry B. Sanborn]], who is given credit as the "Father of Amarillo",<ref>{{cite news |author=Everett, Liz |title=History Makers of the High Plains: H.B. Sanborn |date=May 19, 2000 |work=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/051900/his_sanborn.html |access-date=January 25, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003456/http://www.amarillo.com/stories/051900/his_sanborn.html |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and his business partner [[Joseph Glidden|Joseph F. Glidden]] began buying land to the east to move Amarillo after arguing that Berry's site was on low ground and would flood during rainstorms. Sanborn also offered to trade lots in the new location to businesses in the original city's site and help with the expense of moving to new buildings. His incentives gradually won over people, who moved their businesses to Polk Street in the new commercial district.<ref>{{cite news |author=Crawford, Jim |title=A town determined to survive |date=July 23, 2006 |work=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/072306/spe_disama7.shtml |access-date=January 27, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090757/http://www.amarillo.com/stories/072306/spe_disama7.shtml |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Heavy rains almost flooded Berry's part of the town in 1889, prompting more people to move to Sanborn's location. This eventually led to another county seat election making Sanborn's town the new county seat in 1893.<ref name="handbook"/>

By the late 1890s, Amarillo had emerged as one of the world's busiest cattle-shipping points, and its population grew significantly. The city became a [[grain elevator]], milling, and feed-manufacturing center after an increase in production of wheat and small grains during the early 1900s. Discovery of [[natural gas]] in 1918 and [[Petroleum|oil]] three years later brought oil and gas companies to the Amarillo area.<ref name="handbook"/>

The United States government bought the Cliffside Gas Field with high helium content in 1927 and the Federal Bureau of Mines began operating the Amarillo Helium plant two years later.<ref>{{cite news |author=Livadas, Greg |title=State of Ballooning: Texas |date=October 1999 |work=Balloon Life Magazine |url=http://balloonlife.com/publications/balloon_life/9801/9910/sob9910.html |access-date=January 25, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316214121/http://www.balloonlife.com/publications/balloon_life/9801/9910/sob9910.html |archive-date=March 16, 2006 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The plant was the sole producer of commercial helium in the world for a number of years.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=doh02|name=Helium Production}}.

In 1929, [[Ernest O. Thompson]], a decorated World War I general and a major businessman in Amarillo, was elected mayor to succeed Lee Bivins. Thompson instituted a major capital-improvements project and worked to reduce utility rates. He joined the [[Railroad Commission of Texas|Texas Railroad Commission]] by appointment in 1933 and was elected to full terms in 1934, 1940, 1946, 1952, and 1958. He became an international expert on national petroleum and natural gas production and conservation. The first Mrs. Thompson, [[May Peterson Thompson]], a former [[Metropolitan Opera]] singer, was involved in the arts while in Amarillo and later when the couple lived in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].

Amarillo was hit by the [[Dust Bowl]] and entered an [[Great Depression|economic depression]]. [[U.S. Routes]] 60, 87, 287, and 66 intersected at Amarillo, making it a major tourist stop with numerous motels, restaurants, and curio shops. World War II led the establishment of Amarillo Army Air Field in east Amarillo and the nearby Pantex Army Ordnance Plant, which produced bombs and ammunition. After the end of the war, both of the facilities were closed. The Pantex Plant was reopened in 1950 and produced nuclear weapons throughout the [[Cold War]].<ref name="handbook"/>

In 1949, a deadly F4 tornado devastated much of Amarillo, shortly after nightfall on May 15, tearing through the south and east sides of the city, killing seven people, and injuring more than 80 others. The tornado touched down southwest of Amarillo, near the town of Hereford, then tracked its way northward, on a collision course with Amarillo. The tornado, shortly after 8 pm, ripped through Amarillo's most densely populated areas, demolishing almost half of the city, causing catastrophic damage and loss of life.

In 1951, the army air base was reactivated as [[Amarillo Air Force Base]] and expanded to accommodate a [[Strategic Air Command]] [[B-52 Stratofortress]] wing.<ref>{{cite web |author= Amarillo Economic Development Corporation |url= http://www.amarilloedc.com/index.php?id=51 |title= Community History |access-date= January 28, 2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060116220406/http://www.amarilloedc.com/index.php?id=51 |archive-date= January 16, 2006 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref> The arrival of servicemen and their families ended the city's depression. Between 1950 and 1960, Amarillo's population grew from 74,443 to 137,969. However, the closure of Amarillo Air Force Base on December 31, 1968, contributed to a decrease in population to 127,010 by 1970.

==Geography and climate==
[[File:palodurolighthouse.jpg|right|thumb|Lighthouse pinnacle in Palo Duro Canyon: The canyon system is located south of the city.]]

Amarillo is located near the middle of the Texas Panhandle. It does not share similar weather characteristics with south and east Texas. It is situated in the grasslands of Northern Texas, and is surrounded by dense prairie.  Amarillo is infamous for its unpredictable weather patterns, with massive temperature changes on a daily basis, raging winds, devastating hailstorms and "northers", long periods of drought, late frosts, spring tornadoes, dust-storms, and floods. Though urbanization, agricultural farming, and construction have occurred over the last century in and around Amarillo, the native grasslands that dominate this region have remained largely untouched. Amarillo sits closer in proximity to the [[Oklahoma City|Oklahoma]], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|New Mexico]] and [[Denver|Colorado]] state capitals than it does to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. The region's surface is relatively flat and has little soil drainage. Due to the lack of developed drainage, much of the rainfall either evaporates, infiltrates into the ground, or accumulates in [[playa lake]]s.<ref name="tx_pan"/> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|90.3|sqmi|km2}}, with {{convert|89.9|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} of it land and {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} of it (0.50%) covered by water. The Amarillo metropolitan area is the [[List of United States metropolitan statistical areas by population|182nd-largest]] in the United States with a population of 236,113 in four counties: [[Armstrong County, Texas|Armstrong]], [[Carson County, Texas|Carson]], Potter, and Randall.

About {{convert|20|mi|km}} northeast of Amarillo is the [[Canadian River]], which divides the [[High Plains (United States)|Western High Plains]] ecological region. The southern divide of the Western High Plains is the [[Llano Estacado]] or Staked Plains geographical region. The river is dammed to form [[Lake Meredith]], a major source of drinking water in the Texas Panhandle region.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=rnc02|name=Canadian River}}.

The City of Amarillo's Parks and Recreation Department operates over 50 municipal parks, including a [[skatepark]] west of the city. Amarillo's largest parks are Medical Park, Thompson Memorial Park, and Memorial Park, near Amarillo College's Washington Street Campus. From 1978 to 2002, the [[Junior League]] of Amarillo and the City of Amarillo's Parks and Recreation Department co-sponsored Funfest, a family entertainment festival, benefiting the city parks and the league's Community Chest Trust Fund.

===Climate===
Like most of the Texas Panhandle, Amarillo has a temperate [[semi-arid]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSk'').<ref>Depending on the climatologist's threshold, ''BSk'' if based upon the annual mean temperature (<{{convert|18.0|°C|1|disp=or}}), ''BSh'' if based upon the daily average temperature in the coldest month (≥{{convert|0|°C|disp=or}}).</ref> Both the city and most of the county as a whole lie in [[Hardiness zone|USDA Plant Hardiness Zone]] 7a.<ref>{{cite web|title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/#|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227032333/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/|archive-date=February 27, 2014|access-date=February 24, 2014|publisher=Agricultural Research Center, PRISM Climate Group Oregon State University}}</ref> Amarillo is characterized by a winter season featuring large [[diurnal temperature variation]], great day-to-day variability, possible sudden and/or severe Arctic air outbreaks (in Texas, called "blue northers"), possible [[blizzard]]s and hot summers with generally low humidity. The average annual precipitation is {{convert|20.4|in|mm|disp=or}}. Much of Amarillo's precipitation falls during heavy convective showers and thunderstorms during the late spring and summer months. According to 'Cities Ranked and Rated' (Bert Sperling and Peter Sander), Amarillo averages 48 days per year during which thunder and lightning is reported. This is above the national average. These storms can be severe: Amarillo and the Texas Panhandle are situated in the western portion of "[[Tornado Alley]]" and are prone to severe weather events, occurring primarily between April and July. Severe thunderstorms can produce damaging straight-line winds, large hail, tornadoes, and flash flooding. Amarillo is no stranger to devastating tornadoes. Tornadoes have occurred in and around the city in 1968, 1970, 1982, 1986, 2001, 2007, and most recently in 2013, 2015 and 2016. The strongest tornado to ever hit Amarillo was a deadly F4 tornado that struck the city in the night time hours of May 15, 1949. Amarillo suffered a direct hit, causing catastrophic damage and loss of life in Amarillo's most densely populated areas. The tornado devastated the south and east sides of the city, killing 7 people, and injuring more than 80 others. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|37.0|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|78.3|°F|1}} in July. Sunny weather prevails year-round, with nearly 3300 hours of bright sunshine annually. The [[National Weather Service Amarillo, Texas|National Weather Service in Amarillo]] forecasts and provides climatic data for the city.

Extreme temperatures range from {{convert|−16|°F|1}} on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 12, 1899]] to {{convert|111|°F|1}} on June 26, 2011, but lows do not typically lower to {{convert|0|°F|1|disp=or}} in most years, while highs above {{convert|100|°F|C|1|disp=or}} are seen on 4.7 days on average. On average, there are 5.9 days of lows at or below {{convert|10|°F|1|disp=or}}, 8.8 days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing, and 61 days of {{convert|90|°F|1}}+ highs. Unlike in the Rio Grande Valley or eastern portions of Texas, days where the low does not fall below {{convert|70|°F|1|disp=or}} are relatively rare, due to the aridity and elevation. Blizzards are very possible, but snowfall is typically light, averaging nearly {{convert|18|in|m|2|disp=or}} seasonally and the median figure is near {{convert|10|in|m|2|disp=or}}.<ref>{{cite news |author=Doyle, Thomas |title=Experts say tornado season nears |date=March 29, 2001 |work=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/032901/new_tornadao.shtml |access-date= January 26, 2007}}</ref> Amarillo is also recorded as the windiest city in the U.S. by the Weather Channel.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.weather.com/tv/tvshows/americas-morning-headquarters/10-windiest-large-cities-america-20140408?pageno=10 |title= America's Windiest Cities |year=2014 |publisher= weather.com |access-date= April 16, 2014}}</ref>

[[West Texas A&M University]] features a full slate of [[NCAA Division II]] teams; however, [[Amarillo College]] is one of the few community colleges in Texas without an athletic program. From 1968 to 1996, Amarillo hosted the annual [[National Women's Invitational Tournament]] (NWIT), a post season women's [[college basketball]] tournament.<ref>{{cite news |author=Riddle, Greg |title=NWIT – show board of directors the money |date=March 20, 1997 |work=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://amarillo.com/stories/032097/directors.html|access-date= January 25, 2007}}</ref> During high school football season, the Amarillo Independent School District schools' home games are in [[Dick Bivins Stadium]] which had a $5.7&nbsp;million renovation in 2005.<ref>{{cite news |title=The new Dick Bivins |date=August 23, 2005 |work=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/082305/pig_2547173.shtml|access-date= January 25, 2007}}</ref> Randall High School (part of the adjacent Canyon Independent School District) plays its home games in [[Kimbrough Memorial Stadium]] in Canyon, as well as the yearly Clinton Invitational horseshoe tournament.

Amarillo is home to the Amarillo Gun Club, which features a variety of clay target sports including trap, skeet and 5-Stand.

Another part of Amarillo's sporting history was its roots in [[professional wrestling]]. Amarillo residents Dory Funk, Stanley Blackburn and [[Doc Sarpolis]] promoted the territory for several decades. Funk's sons, [[Dory Funk, Jr.]], and [[Terry Funk]] were both [[National Wrestling Alliance]] World Heavyweight Champions and represented Amarillo.

==Infrastructure==

===Air transportation===
[[Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport]] is a [[public airport]] located {{convert|10|mi|0}} east of the [[central business district]] of Amarillo, north of Interstate 40. A portion of the former [[Amarillo Air Force Base]] was converted to civilian use and became part of the airport.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=qba01|name=Amarillo Air Force Base}}. Retrieved on January 25, 2007.</ref> The airport was named after [[NASA]] astronaut [[Rick Husband]], an Amarillo native and commander of the final flight of [[Space Shuttle Columbia]], [[STS-107]], which [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|disintegrated]] on re-entry, killing Husband and his crewmates. The airport is served by several major air carriers with non-stop service to [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].

[[Tradewind Airport]] is a public-use [[general aviation]] airport located in Randall County, {{convert|3|nmi|mi km}} south of Amarillo's central business district. The airport covers {{convert|595|acre|ha}} and has two [[asphalt]]-paved runways and one [[helipad]].<ref>{{FAA-airport|ID=TDW|use=PU|own=PR|site=23324.*A}}. Federal Aviation Administration. Effective June 30, 2011.</ref>

[[Buffalo Airport (Texas)|Buffalo Airport]] is a public-use general aviation airport located in Randall County, {{convert|9|nmi|mi km}} south of Amarillo's central business district. The airport covers {{convert|40|acre|ha}} and has two grass runways.<ref>{{FAA-airport|ID=1E7|use=PU|own=PR|site=23324.3*A}}. Federal Aviation Administration. Effective June 30, 2011.</ref>

===Ground transportation===
Local transit services in the city have been available since 1925 and have been provided through the City of Amarillo's [[Amarillo City Transit]] (ACT) department since 1966; before that time the system was privately owned. ACT operates bus services that include fixed route transit and demand response [[paratransit]] which are designed for people with disabilities. The ACT transports approximately 350,000 passengers per year on the fixed route and 30,000 paratransit passengers, but it is a declining ridership. ACT has no plans to scale back any of their transit routes or services.<ref name="community"/>

Amarillo has no passenger rail service but remains an important part of the rail freight system. The last passenger train out of the city was the [[Santa Fe Railroad]]'s ''[[San Francisco Chief]],'' from [[Chicago]], which had its last run in 1971. Previously, the ''[[Texas Zephyr]]'' to [[Denver]] and [[Dallas]], last served Amarillo in 1967.

The [[BNSF Railway]] complex in Amarillo continues to serve a heavy daily traffic load, approximately 100–110 trains per day.<ref>{{cite news |author=Cunningham, Greg |title=Transportation key to Amarillo's past, future |date=June 26, 2005 |work=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/062605/spe_disama_6.shtml |access-date=January 25, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090701/http://www.amarillo.com/stories/062605/spe_disama_6.shtml |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] also sends substantial shipments to or through Amarillo. In addition to intermodal and general goods, a big portion of rail shipments involve grains and coal. There have been various proposals over the years to add passenger service. One, the ''[[Caprock Chief]]'', would have seen daily service as part of a Fort Worth, Texas—Denver, Colorado service, but it failed to gain traction.

[[File:Amarillo Tx - Brick Streets.jpg|thumb|Several streets around Amarillo's downtown area are still paved with bricks.]]
The streets in Amarillo's downtown area conform to a [[grid pattern]]. The city's original street layout was set up by William H. Bush, beginning at the west end of the town moving to the east. Bush named the north to south streets for past [[president of the United States|United States presidents]], in chronological order except for [[John Quincy Adams]] because the surname was taken with the second president, [[John Adams]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Routon, Ralph |title=Street names can honor past, embrace future |date=February 8, 2004 |work=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/020804/new_routon.shtml|access-date= January 25, 2007}}</ref> (The last president so honored was [[Grover Cleveland]]; though the city has expanded eastward the pattern was not continued.) While the streets running north–south honor past presidents and are designated 'streets', east–west streets are numbered and are designated 'avenues'. North of the Fort Worth & Denver (now Burlington Northern-Santa Fe) railyard, the numbers are "NW" (northwest) west of Polk Street, and "NE" (northeast) east of Polk. South of the railyard (including the downtown-city center area), numbers are officially "SW" (southwest) west of Polk, and "SE" (southeast) east of Polk. Colloquially, though, most tend to dub the SW and SE avenues as W (west) and E (east), respectively. One example of the numbering difference regards the former U.S. Highway 66 routing west of downtown and into the San Jacinto neighborhood. Most call it 'West Sixth Street' when it's actually SW Sixth Avenue.

In 1910, the Amarillo voters approved to pay for street paving and the materials used to pave the streets were [[brick]]s.<ref>{{cite news |author=Parker, Debra A. |title=Brick streets helped build |date=May 17, 2001 |work=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://amarillo.com/stories/051701/new_brickstreets.shtml|access-date= January 25, 2007}}</ref> As of 2003, the city still has {{convert|16.2|mi}} of brick streets in some parts of the downtown area. The city spent $200,000 in 2002 to restore one block of brick street on Ninth Avenue between Polk and Tyler streets.<ref>{{cite news |author=Chapman, Joe |title=Touchstones of history |date=August 10, 2003 |work=Amarillo Globe-News |url=http://amarillo.com/stories/081003/new_touchstones.shtml|access-date= January 25, 2007}}</ref>

===Major highways===
Amarillo is served by two interstate highways: [[Interstate 27]] and [[Interstate 40 in Texas|Interstate 40]].  Amarillo is also the northern terminus for I-27, of which less than one mile (~1.6&nbsp;km) is located in Potter County. The highway terminates at the city's main west–east highway, Interstate 40, just north of the Potter-Randall County line. The roadway continues northward into downtown Amarillo via U.S. [[U.S. Highway 60 (Texas)|60]], [[U.S. Route 87 in Texas|87]], and [[U.S. Route 287 in Texas|287]], via a series of four one-way streets including Buchanan, Pierce, Fillmore and Taylor. North of downtown the highway becomes US 87 & 287 and continues northward to [[Dumas, Texas]].<ref name="i27"/>

Interstate 40, the city's major east–west thoroughfare was completed entirely through Amarillo in November 1968 across the center of the city. Previously, [[U.S. Route 66 in Texas|U.S. Highway 66]] was the major east–west highway through the city, generally following Amarillo Blvd. to the north of the downtown area and then curving southwest to leave the city near the Veterans Hospital. A city route (which was an original alignment of US 66 through central and west Amarillo) followed Fillmore south into the downtown area and turned on West 6th through the San Jacinto Heights district which is now home to many antique shops, restaurants and other businesses, passing the Amarillo Country Club and veering onto West 9th Street and Bushland Blvd before tying into the through route at a traffic circle near the Veterans Hospital.
[[Texas State Highway Loop 335|Loop 335]] circles around Amarillo in all four directions and consists of four-lane roadway on its northeast and southwest quadrants and two-lane paving to the southeast and northwest.

Amarillo is also mentioned in the song "[[(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66|Route 66]]".

===Future Freeways===
In 2015, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) published the plans for the all new [[Texas State Highway Loop 335|Loop 335]] freeway that encircles the city of Amarillo.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.amarillo.com/news/2015-04-07/txdot-lays-out-proposed-loop-335-project |title=TxDOT lays out proposed Loop 335 project |first=Vanessa |last=Garcia |work=[[Amarillo Globe-News]] |date=April 7, 2015 |language=en}}</ref> TxDOT has planned multiple multi-level interchanges that intersect with [[Interstate 40 in Texas|Interstate 40]], [[Interstate 27]], and U.S. [[U.S. Route 287 in Texas|287]] and [[U.S. Route 87 in Texas|87]]. The first interchange, on the East side of Amarillo, is a multi-level interchange that provides access to both directions of the I-40 Expressway and Loop 335. On the Northern side of Amarillo, the loop will be completely reconstructed to an Interstate-Grade freeway with complete grade separations and will be expanded to 4 lanes. It also includes a stack interchange that will connect the new freeway to the future I-27 [[Ports to Plains Corridor]] (Highway 287, 87).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portstoplains.com/index.php|title=Home - Ports-to-Plains Alliance|website=www.portstoplains.com}}</ref><ref name="state.tx.us">{{cite web|url=http://apps.dot.state.tx.us/apps-cq/project_tracker/|title=Project Tracker|website=apps.dot.state.tx.us}}</ref> I-27 in Southern Amarillo will be entirely reconstructed from Buffalo Stadium Rd. at the Canyon E-Way Interchange to Palo Duro Canyon State Park. It will accommodate 6 lanes at the mainlane bridge along with a complete stack interchange with direct connectors to and from I-27. Furthermore, another triple-level interchange will be built to accommodate Soncy Road, Helium Road, I-27 and the new loop.<ref name="state.tx.us"/>  Also, another new mainlane bridge that accommodates up to 6 lanes is also in the works for I-40 near Helium Rd. providing easier access to the new freeway.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.txdot.gov/inside-txdot/get-involved/about/hearings-meetings/amarillo/040715.html|title=Public Meeting - State Loop 335|first=Texas Department of Transportation (State of|last=Texas)|website=www.txdot.gov}}</ref>  Although construction started in 2016, the entire project, which includes converting the entire loop to Interstate Specifications, is not expected to be complete until 2024.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theamarilloloop.com|title=CloudAccess.net Message|website=www.theamarilloloop.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=State Loop 335 - AARoads - Texas Highways |url=https://www.aaroads.com/guides/sl-335-tx/ |website=AARoads |date=April 4, 2017}}</ref>

===Medical centers and hospitals===
[[File:Amarillo Texas USA - Harrington Regional Medical Center.jpg|thumb|The Harrington Regional Medical Center has two of the city's major hospitals.]]
Amarillo is home to medical facilities including Baptist St. Anthony's and Northwest Texas Hospitals, the Don & Sybil Harrington Cancer Center, Bivins Memorial Nursing Home, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Texas Tech School of Pharmacy, and Texas Panhandle Mental Health and Mental Retardation. All are located in the Harrington Regional Medical Center, the first specifically designated city hospital district in Texas.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=sbhfz|name=Harrington Regional Medical Center}}.

===Utilities===
[[Drinking water]] is provided by the City of Amarillo and its Utilities Division. Amarillo's water supply used to come from both from [[Lake Meredith]] and the [[Ogallala Aquifer]]. Due to the lake's low water level, water is now only supplied by the aquifer. Lake Meredith is located northeast of Amarillo and in 2005 it contained at least {{convert|114|e9USgal|m3}} of water. By 2011, lake levels had dropped so much due to the Texas drought, the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority voted to stop using it entirely.<ref>{{cite news |agency= Associated Press |url= https://www.usatoday.com/weather/drought/story/2011-10-14/texas-drought-abandoned-lake-meredith/50773340/1 |title= Texas drought leaves lake too low for cities' use |access-date= November 22, 2011 |work=USA Today |date=October 14, 2011}}</ref> Increased rainfall in recent years has helped the lake regain much of its volume.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.myhighplains.com/news/recent-rains-add-1-5-billion-gallons-of-water-to-lake-meredith/|title=Recent rains add ~1.5 Billion gallons of water to Lake Meredith|date=2019-06-04|website=KAMR - MyHighPlains.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref> Generally, the city's daily water production averages between {{convert|40|-|50|e6USgal|m3}}.<ref>{{cite web |author= City of Amarillo's Utilities Division |url= http://www.ci.amarillo.tx.us/departments/dirutils/pdf/2005%20CCR%20MSWORD.pdf |title= 2005 Water Quality Report |format= PDF |access-date= January 28, 2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060305124221/http://www.ci.amarillo.tx.us/departments/dirutils/pdf/2005%20CCR%20MSWORD.pdf |archive-date= March 5, 2006 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

Collection and disposal of the city's trash and garbage are the responsibilities of the City of Amarillo's Solid Waste Collection and Solid Waste Disposal Departments. Amarillo's non-hazardous solid waste is collected and disposed of through burial in the city's [[landfill]].
