On August 7, 2012, Loughner's competency hearing began with testimony from Dr. Christina Pietz, Loughner's [[forensic psychologist]], who testified that she believed Loughner was competent to stand trial.  After hearing the evidence, Judge Burns ruled that Loughner was competent to stand trial, whereupon Loughner pleaded guilty to 19 counts, sparing himself the death penalty.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jared Loughner is found competent to stand trial |url=https://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/20120807tucson-shooting-loughner-court-hearing.html|website=The Arizona Republic|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}</ref>

On November 8, 2012, Loughner appeared for sentencing, with several of his victims as well as relatives of those he killed in attendance.  Judge Burns sentenced Loughner to seven consecutive life terms plus 140 years in prison without parole.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ball|first=James|title=Jared Lee Loughner sentenced to life in prison|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/gabrielle-giffords-confronts-shooter-jared-lee-loughner-in-court/2012/11/08/09968fe2-29c7-11e2-b4e0-346287b7e56c_story.html|accessdate=November 14, 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Alan|title=Loughner sentenced to life for Arizona shootings|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/08/justice/arizona-loughner-sentencing/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 14, 2012|date=November 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Santos|first=Fernanda|title=Gunman in Giffords Shooting Sentenced to 7 Life Terms|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/us/gunman-who-shot-giffords-to-be-sentenced.html|accessdate=November 14, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 8, 2012}}</ref>

After his sentencing in federal court, Pima County Attorney Barbara LaWall announced that she would not prosecute Loughner on behalf of the state of Arizona. LaWall explained that her decision would afford the victims and their families, as well as the community in Tucson and Pima County, an opportunity to move forward with their lives. She said that, after speaking and consulting personally with each of the surviving victims and with the family members of those killed, it was clear that they would not be benefitted by a state prosecution. Surviving victims and family members told LaWall that they are "completely satisfied with the federal prosecution", that "justice has been served", and that the federal sentence is "suitably severe".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonlocalmedia.com/news/article_f396fab0-29f3-11e2-9ec5-001a4bcf887a.html |title=Pima County Attorney won't prosecute Loughner - The Explorer: News |website=The Explorer |accessdate=September 13, 2014 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZpFstUz6?url=http://www.tucsonlocalmedia.com/news/article_f396fab0-29f3-11e2-9ec5-001a4bcf887a.html |archivedate=July 6, 2015 }} ()</ref><!--http://explorernews.com/news/article_f396fab0-29f3-11e2-9ec5-001a4bcf887a.html-->

The political climate in the United States and in Arizona in particular was pointed to by some observers as a possible contributing factor for the violent act. For example, [[Clarence Dupnik]], Pima County Sheriff, initially expressed concern that overheated political rhetoric and violence may be related, observing, "When you look at unbalanced people, how they respond to the vitriol that comes out of certain mouths about tearing down the government. The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous." He believed that Arizona had unfortunately become "the capital" of such feelings. "We have become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry," he said.<ref name="NYTimes-20110110-spotlight">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/us/10arizona.html|title=Shooting Casts a Harsh Spotlight on Arizona's Unique Politics|first=Jennifer|last=Steinhauer|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 9, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2011/01/sheriff-dupniks-criticism-of-p.html|title=Sheriff Dupnik's criticism of political 'vitriol' resonates with public|work=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Sandhya |last=Somashekhar |date=January 9, 2011|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref> But, Dupnik later said that he had no evidence that the killings were a result of anything particular which Loughner may have read or heard.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mirkinson|first=Jack|title=Megyn Kelly Debates Sheriff Clarence Dupnik About His Comments on Arizona Shooting (VIDEO)|work=Huffington Post|date=January 9, 2011|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/09/megyn-kelly-debates-clarence-dupnik_n_806521.html|accessdate=January 12, 2011}}</ref> International media referred to the political climate in the United States and the Palin map in particular.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12147588|title=Shot US congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords 'doing well'|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=January 11, 2011|date=January 9, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110110030929/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12147588| archivedate= January 10, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/210531-toestand-giffords-bevredigend.html|title=Toestand Giffords bevredigend (Condition Giffords satisfying)|website=nos.nl (Dutch public broadcaster)|accessdate=January 11, 2011|language=Dutch }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl.nl/(/actueel/rtlnieuws/buitenland/)/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/2011/01_januari/11/buitenland/tea-party_links-misbruikt-aanslag.xml|title=Tea Party: links misbruikt aanslag (Tea Party: left misuses attack)|website=RTL News (Dutch commercial broadcaster)|accessdate=January 11, 2011|language=Dutch }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/buitenland/1.938298|title=Amerikaans Congreslid Giffords neergeschoten (American member of congress Giffords shot down)|website=deredachtie.be (VRT; Belgian public broadcaster)|accessdate=January 11, 2011|language=Dutch }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/schiessereituscon110.html |title=US-Abgeordnete Giffords in kritischem Zustand (US-representative Giffords in critical condition) |website=tagesschau.de (ARD; German public broadcaster) |accessdate=January 11, 2011 |language=German |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111053542/http://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/schiessereituscon110.html |archivedate=January 11, 2011 }}</ref> The French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' said that the attack seemed to confirm "an alarming premonition that has been gaining momentum for a long time: that the verbal and symbolic violence that the most radical right-wing opponents have used in their clash with the [[Obama administration]] would at some point lead to tragic physical violence."<ref name="NPR-AP-2011-01-10">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/01/10/global-worry-tucson-attack-augur-violent/|agency=Associated Press|title=Global worry: Tucson attack augur more violent US?|date=January 10, 2011|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=January 15, 2011|quote=In Paris, the newspaper ''Le Monde'' said the attack seemed to confirm "an alarming premonition that has been gaining momentum for a long time: that the verbal and symbolic violence that the most radical right-wing opponents have used in their clash with the Obama administration would at some point lead to tragic physical violence."| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110123230448/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/01/10/global-worry-tucson-attack-augur-violent/| archivedate= January 23, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> President Obama called the shooting an "unspeakable tragedy", adding that "such a [[senseless violence|senseless]] and terrible act of violence has no place in a free society".<ref name="Obama-WHgov-2011-01-08"/> Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]] called the attack "senseless and cruel violence"<ref name="azcentral2011-01-08-reaction"/> and House Speaker [[John Boehner]] said, "An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve.

On Sunday, January 16, 2011, eight days after the shooting, Vietnam War veteran James Eric Fuller, who had been shot in the knee during the attack, was arrested for disorderly conduct at a town hall meeting. After Tucson Tea Party figure Trent Humphries, who had faulted Giffords for not having enough security, stated that gun control measures should not be discussed until all those killed in the shooting were buried, Fuller allegedly took a picture of Humphries and shouted, "You're dead." In an interview during the week after the shooting, Fuller had criticized Palin and what he called the "Tea Party crime-syndicate" for promoting a divisive political climate before the attacks.<ref name="NYT_Dolnick"/> The police then committed him to an undisclosed medical facility to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. A police spokesman stated that the hospital will determine when he will be released.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Tucson Shooting Victim Detained at Taping of TV Special|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=January 16, 2011|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/41094534|accessdate=January 19, 2011}}</ref> Meanwhile, Humphries said he was worried about Fuller's threat, and the dozens of other angry e-mails he received from people blaming right-wing political rhetoric for contributing to the assassination attempt on Giffords.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Ariz.
