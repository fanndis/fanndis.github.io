Trump's international hotel licensing and management business makes up only $220 million of his estimated $3.5 billion fortune, but it's the most dynamic part of the Trump portfolio—and it throws off chunks of cash with virtually no risk. As the Trumps have wound down some international deals, they continue to push forward with new domestic agreements.</blockquote>

Eric Trump, in the ''Forbes'' article, discussed the "clear separation of church and state that we maintain" between the business and his father and said that with his father's presidency and related changes "[y]ou could look at it either way" in terms of business prospects. He also said that "he will continue to update his father on the business while he is in the presidency{{nbsp}}... 'probably quarterly{{nbsp}}... profitability reports and stuff like that'." The article quoted Larry Noble, general counsel of the nonpartisan [[Campaign Legal Center]] and a former chief [[Ethics in Government Act|ethics officer]] at the [[Federal Election Commission]], and President [[George W. Bush]]'s former chief ethics lawyer, [[Richard Painter]], as looking negatively at such multiple planned updates of President Trump per year.<ref name=Forbes01/> Noble said in part "if he is now going to get reports from his son about the businesses, then he really isn't separate in any real way." Painter said in part "at the end of the day, he owns the business. He has the conflicts that come with it."<ref name=Forbes01/>

Also in March 2017, ''Forbes'' did a listing of all "36 mini-Trumps", as it termed the domestic and international partners—often described as "billionaires"—with whom the Trump Organization has worked over the years. Introducing the listing, the magazine reported that at least 14 of the partners attended the president's inauguration and some of them paid for $18,000-a-night accommodations at the [[Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C.|Trump International Hotel]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], for the event.<ref name=Forbes03/>

== Coats of arms ==

{{See also|List of personal coats of arms of Presidents of the United States}}

Donald Trump has used a number of logos in the style of coats of arms for his businesses.

[[File:Coat of Arms of Joseph E. Davies.svg|thumb|upright|right|The coat of arms granted to Davies in 1939 bears the [[motto]] "''Integritas''".]]

[[Joseph E. Davies]], third husband of [[Marjorie Merriweather Post]] and a former U.S. ambassador of [[Wales|Welsh]] origins, was granted a coat of arms by [[King of Arms#Kings of Arms for England, Wales and Northern Ireland|British heraldic authorities]] in 1939. After Donald Trump purchased [[Mar-a-Lago]], the Florida estate built by Merriweather Post, in 1985, the Trump Organization started using Davies's coat of arms at [[Trump National Golf Club (disambiguation)|Trump golf courses]] and estates across the country.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hakim|first1=Danny|title=The Coat of Arms Said 'Integrity'.

In 2008, Trump attempted to establish the American logo at his new [[Trump International Golf Links, Scotland|Trump International Golf Links]] in [[Balmedie]], [[Scotland]], but was warned by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], the highest authority for [[Scottish heraldry]], that an act of the Scottish Parliament from 1672 disallows people using unregistered arms. In January 2012, shortly after the inauguration of the golf course, Trump unveiled the new coat of arms<ref name="deadline">{{cite news|last1=Guest|title=Donald Trump awarded Scottish coat of arms after four year battle|url=http://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2012/01/17/donald-trump-at-last-awarded-the-scottish-coat-of-arms/|accessdate=February 14, 2018|agency=Deadline|date=January 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214200437/http://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2012/01/17/donald-trump-at-last-awarded-the-scottish-coat-of-arms/|archive-date=February 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> that had been granted to "The Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd" by the Lord Lyon in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Court of the Lord Lyon|first1=[https://twitter.com/LyonCourt @LyonCourt]|url=https://twitter.com/LyonCourt/status/798120353948049408|website=Twitter|access-date=February 14, 2018|date=November 14, 2016|title=Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd was granted arms in 2011, replacing an assumed design they had previously used.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808060505/https://twitter.com/LyonCourt/status/798120353948049408|archive-date=August 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:Coat of Arms of Donald Trump.svg|thumb|upright|The coat of arms granted to "The Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd" in 2011 bears the battle cry: "''Numquam Concedere''".]]

Sarah Malone, executive vice-president of "The Trump International Golf Links, Scotland", said that "the coat of arms brings together visual elements that signify different aspects of the Trump family heritage [...], the Lion Rampant [in the crest] makes reference to Scotland and the stars to America. Three chevronels are used to denote the sky, sand dunes and sea—the essential components of the site, and the double-[headed] Eagle represents the dual nature and nationality of Trump's heritage (Scottish and German). The Eagle clutches golf balls making reference to the great name of golf, and the motto ''Numquam Concedere'' is Latin for Never Give Up—Trump's philosophy."<ref name="deadline"/>

== Financing ==
During the property boom of the 1980s, Trump acquired numerous properties and by 1990 owed $4 billion to 72 banks. When the market entered a slump in 1990 that placed the Organization at risk of collapse, Trump and his lenders acted to restructure his debts, although they disagree on who identified the problem and initiated negotiations. The resulting restructuring required his banks to forgive some of Trump's debt. Trump's casinos later entered bankruptcies in which his bondholders took deep losses. After these incidents, Trump had difficulty borrowing new money from most mainstream financial institutions. [[Deutsche Bank]], which did not have a significant presence on Wall Street during the 1980s, expanded rapidly in the United States during the 1990s, and by the end of the decade had become Trump's primary bank lender. In the process of its rapid expansion, the bank engaged in numerous questionable practices, including manipulating currencies and interest rates, laundering billions of dollars for Russian oligarchs and misleading international bank regulators. The bank was fined $630 million in 2017 for facilitating a $10 billion Russian money laundering scheme. The bank provided Trump with a variety of services including financial instruments designed to shield him from risks and outside scrutiny, and connected Trump to wealthy Russians who were interested in investing in Western real estate. During the 2000s and 2010s, Trump borrowed $2 billion from the bank, owing it about $360 million in 2016. Trump's eldest son, Donald Jr., was quoted as saying at a 2008 New York real estate conference, "In terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets...We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia." [[James Dodson (author)|James Dodson]], a golf magazine writer, said that during a 2014 golf game, he asked Trump's son [[Eric Trump|Eric]] how the Organization was funding its golf resort acquisitions, to which Trump responded, "Well, we don’t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia." Eric Trump later denied making the statement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/magazine/deutsche-bank-trump.html|title=The Money Behind Trump's Money|first=David|last=Enrich|date=February 4, 2020|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref name="auto2"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/30/trumps-unthinkable-conflict-millions-in-debts-to-german-bank-now-facing-federal-fines/|title=Trump's unusual conflict: Millions in debts to German bank now facing federal fines|first=Drew|last=Harwell|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/31/investing/deutsche-bank-us-fine-russia-money-laundering/index.html|title=Deutsche Bank fined for $10 billion Russian money-laundering scheme|first=Jethro|last=Mullen|date=January 31, 2017|website=CNNMoney}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/|title=How Russian Money Helped Save Trump's Business|first=Michael|last=Hirsh|publisher=Foreign Policy|date=December 21, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/eric-trump-donald-golf-courses-russia-funding-golf-writer-interview-2014-james-dodson-a7722806.html|title=Eric Trump old interview resurfaces: 'We don't rely on banks.

== Valuation disputes ==

The financial statements of the Trump Organization's holdings are private, as are Donald Trump's personal tax returns, and there exist a wide range of estimates of the Trump Organization's true value. Donald Trump has been accused on several occasions of deliberately inflating the valuation of Trump Organization properties through the aggressive lobbying of the media, in particular the authors of the annual [[Forbes 400]] list, in order to bolster his perceived net worth among the public over several decades.<ref name=":3" /> He has released little definitive financial documentation to the public confirm his valuation claims.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2016/03/31/how-donald-trump-exaggerates-and-fibs-about-his-4-5-billion-net-worth/#74306b7d1770|title=How Donald Trump Exaggerates And Fibs About His $4.5 Billion Net Worth|last=Peterson-Withorn|first=Chase|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420203558/https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2016/03/31/how-donald-trump-exaggerates-and-fibs-about-his-4-5-billion-net-worth/#74306b7d1770|archive-date=April 20, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2011/04/21/news/companies/donald_trump/index.htm|title=Donald Trump net worth: I'm worth whatever I feel|last=Khalid|first=Kiran|date=April 21, 2011|website=CNN Money|access-date=April 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421030435/http://money.cnn.com/2011/04/21/news/companies/donald_trump/index.htm|archive-date=April 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

It is difficult to determine a net value for the Trump Organization's real estate holdings independently since each individual property may be encumbered by debt.<ref name=":3" />

In October 2015, ''[[Forbes]]'' published an article titled "Inside The Epic Fantasy That's Driven Donald Trump For 33 Years" detailing its struggle to estimate the true net worth of Trump and the Trump Organization.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/randalllane/2015/09/29/inside-the-epic-fantasy-thats-driven-donald-trump-for-33-years/#38d2bad20375|title=Inside The Epic Fantasy That's Driven Donald Trump For 33 Years|last=Lane|first=Randall|date=September 29, 2015|work=Forbes|access-date=April 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420203640/https://www.forbes.com/sites/randalllane/2015/09/29/inside-the-epic-fantasy-thats-driven-donald-trump-for-33-years/#38d2bad20375|archive-date=April 20, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2018 a former ''Forbes'' journalist who had worked on the ''Forbes'' list claimed in an op-ed to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that Trump had lied about his wealth to ''Forbes'' to get on the list repeatedly and suggested that Forbes' previous low-end estimates of Trump's net worth were still well above his true net worth.<ref name=":3" />

In July 2020, Trump Organization executive vice president [[Eric Trump]] canceled a scheduled deposition appearance under subpoena. On September 17, he stated he would provide the deposition after the November election, citing his busy travel schedule and "to avoid the use of his deposition attendance for political purposes." Days later, New York State Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron ordered Trump to provide the deposition by October 7.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/17/politics/eric-trump-new-york-interview/index.html|title=Eric Trump says he's willing to be interviewed by the New York AG's office but not until after election|first=Kara Scannell and Caroline Kelly|last=CNN|website=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/23/politics/eric-trump-deposition/index.html|title=New York judge rules Eric Trump must sit for deposition before election|first=Erica|last=Orden|website=CNN}}</ref>

== Controversies ==

In 1973, the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) Civil Rights Division filed a civil rights suit against the Trump Organization charging them for violating the 1968 [[Fair Housing Act]] by refusing to rent to black people. The [[National Urban League]] had sent black and white testers to apply for apartments in Trump-owned complexes; the white testers got the apartments, whereas the black testers did not. According to court records, four superintendents or rental agents reported that applications sent to the central office for acceptance or rejection were coded by race. A 1979 ''[[Village Voice]]'' article quoted a rental agent who said Fred Trump had instructed him not to rent to black people and to encourage existing black tenants to leave. In 1975, a [[consent decree]] described by the head of DOJ's housing division as "one of the most far-reaching ever negotiated" required Trump to advertise vacancies in minority papers and list vacancies with the Urban League. The Justice Department subsequently stated that continuing "racially discriminatory conduct by Trump agents has occurred with such frequency that it has created a substantial impediment to the full enjoyment of equal opportunity."<ref>Barrett, Wayne; Campbell, Jon (July 20, 2015).

Also, it is alleged that the Trump Organization has a history of not paying for services rendered. Several hundred contractors or workers for the organization have filed lawsuits or [[lien]]s saying they were not paid for their work, and others say they had to settle for cents on the dollar.<ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hundreds-claim-donald-trump-doesn-t-pay-his-bills-n589261 "Hundreds Claim Donald Trump Doesn't Pay His Bills"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927060347/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hundreds-claim-donald-trump-doesn-t-pay-his-bills-n589261 |date=September 27, 2016 }}.

In 1989, New York State officials ordered the [[Grand Hyatt New York]], a hotel owned at the time by the Trump Organization and the [[Hyatt|Hyatt Corporation]], to pay New York City $2.9 million in rent that had been withheld by the hotel in 1986 due to "unusual" accounting changes approved by Donald Trump.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inside-a-donald-trump-audit-missing-books-and-unusual-accounting/|title=Inside a Donald Trump audit: Missing books and unusual accounting|access-date=January 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113141116/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/inside-a-donald-trump-audit-missing-books-and-unusual-accounting/|archive-date=January 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> An investigation by New York City auditors noted that the hotel was missing basic financial records and found the hotel was using procedures that violated [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)|generally accepted accounting principles]].

In October 2018, ''The New York Times'' published an exposé arguing that the Trump family evaded over $500 million in [[Gift tax in the United States|gift taxes]] and [[Estate tax in the United States|estate taxes]] on the transfer of Fred Trump's wealth to his children. The alleged schemes involved siphoning money from Fred's companies to his children throughout their lives, and understating the value of transferred properties.<ref name=barstow /> The Trump family denied the allegations.<ref name=barstow /> New York tax authorities opened an investigation into the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/us/politics/donald-trump-fred-trump-tax-schemes.html|title=New York Regulators Examine the Trump Family's Tax Schemes|publisher=|accessdate=October 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008185445/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/us/politics/donald-trump-fred-trump-tax-schemes.html|archive-date=October 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 2020, it was revealed that Trump's properties had charged the government over $1.1 million since the beginning of his presidency. At the Bedminster club, for example, the Secret Service rented a three-bedroom cottage for $17,000 per month. The ''Washington Post'' arrived at this total amount after it filed a public-records lawsuit and pieced together receipts and invoices from Trump's businesses.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Fahrenthold|first1=David A.|last2=Dawsey|first2=Josh|date=17 September 2020|title=Trump's businesses charged Secret Service more than $1.1 million, including for rooms in club shuttered for pandemic|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/us/trump-s-businesses-charged-secret-service-more-than-1-1-million-including-for-rooms-in-club-shuttered-for-pandemic-1.645465|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Stars and Stripes}}</ref>
