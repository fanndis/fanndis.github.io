In 1978, Richardson moved to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], and ran for the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1980 as a Democrat, losing narrowly to longtime 1st District representative and future United States Secretary of the Interior [[Manuel Lujan Jr.|Manuel Lujan]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]). Two years later, Richardson was elected to New Mexico's newly created third district, taking in most of the northern part of the state. Richardson spent 14 years in Congress, representing the country's most diverse district and holding 2,000 town meetings.

Richardson served as Chairman of the [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]] in the 98th Congress (1983–1985) and as Chairman of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Native American Affairs in the 103rd Congress (1993–1994).

Richardson tightened security following the scandal, leading to the creation of the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] (NNSA, not to be confused with the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] and the [[United States National Security Council|NSC]]).

During the campaign, he set a [[Guinness World Record]] for most handshakes in eight hours by a politician, breaking [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s record.<ref name="tufts">{{cite news| last =Mears| first =Bill| title =A Whole Lotta Shaking| website=E-News|publisher =[[Tufts University]]|location=Somerville, Massachusetts| date =September 16, 2002| url =http://enews.tufts.edu/stories/1042/2002/09/16/WholeLottaShaking/| access-date =November 7, 2008| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20081210032425/http://enews.tufts.edu/stories/1042/2002/09/16/WholeLottaShaking/| archive-date =December 10, 2008| url-status =dead| df =mdy-all}}</ref> He succeeded a two-term Republican governor, [[Gary Johnson]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/78543/gary-johnson-2012-republican-candidate-new-mexico|title=Free Johnson|last=Birnbaum|first=Ben|date=November 11, 2010|magazine=[[The New Republic|New Republic]]|access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref> He took office in January 2003 as the only [[Hispanic]] Governor in the United States. In his first year, Richardson proposed "[[tax cut]]s to promote growth and investment" and passed a broad personal income tax cut and won a statewide special election to transfer money from the state's Permanent Fund to meet current expenses and projects. In early 2005, Richardson helped make New Mexico the first state in the nation to provide $400,000 in [[life insurance]] coverage for [[New Mexico]] [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard members]] who serve on active duty. Thirty-five states have since followed suit.

Working with the legislature, he formed Richardson's Investment Partnership (GRIP) in 2003. The partnership has been used to fund large-scale public infrastructure projects throughout New Mexico, including the use of highway fund to construct a brand new commuter rail line (the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|Rail Runner]]) that runs between [[Belen, New Mexico|Belen]], [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], and [[Bernalillo]]. He supported a variety of [[LGBT]] rights in his career as governor; he added [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] to New Mexico's list of [[civil rights]] categories. However, he was opposed to [[same-sex marriage]], and faced criticism for his use of the anti-gay slur "maricón" on the [[Don Imus]] Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaynewswatch.com/Page.cfm?PageID=22&SID=1842 |title=Richardson sorry for 'maricón' moment |date=July 10, 2007 |first1=Karen|last1=Ocamb|first2=Chris|last2=Crain |website=Gay Newswatch|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005153748/http://www.gaynewswatch.com/Page.cfm?PageID=22&SID=1842 |archive-date=October 5, 2008 }}</ref>

During the summer of 2003, he met with a delegation from North Korea at their request to discuss concerns over that country's [[North Korea and Weapons of Mass Destruction|nuclear weapons]]. At the request of the White House, he also flew to North Korea in 2005, and met with another North Korean delegation in 2006. On December 7, 2006, Richardson was named as the Special Envoy for Hemispheric Affairs for the Secretary General of the [[Organization of American States]] with the mandate to "promote dialogue on issues of importance to the region, such as immigration and [[free trade]]".<ref>{{Cite press release|url=https://www.oas.org/en/media_center/press_release.asp?sCodigo=E-271/06|title=OAS - Organization of American States: Democracy for peace, security, and development|date=August 1, 2009|website=www.oas.org}}</ref>

In 2003, Richardson backed and signed legislation creating a permit system for New Mexicans to carry concealed [[handguns]]. He applied for and received a [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed weapons permit]], though by his own admission he seldom carries a gun.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071126/FRONTPAGE/711260306 |work=Concord Monitor |title=Richardson stands out as pro-gun Democrat |year=2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610110928/http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071126%2FFRONTPAGE%2F711260306 |archive-date=June 10, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

As Richardson discussed frequently during his 2008 run for President, he supported a controversial New Mexico law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses for reasons of public safety. He said that because of the program, traffic fatalities had gone down, and the percentage of uninsured drivers decreased from 33% to 11%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Cabinet/Bill_Richardson_Immigration.htm|title= Bill Richardson on Immigration |publisher= ontheissues.org |date=November 15, 2007}}</ref>
[[File:GovBillRichardson&RichardBranson 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Gov. Richardson and Richard Branson with SpaceShipTwo, 2010|181x181px]]
He was named Chairman of the [[Democratic Governors Association]] in 2004 and announced a desire to increase the role of Democratic governors in deciding the future of their party.

In December 2005, Richardson announced the intention of New Mexico to collaborate with billionaire [[Richard Branson]] to bring [[space tourism]] to the proposed [[Spaceport America]] located near [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. In 2006, ''[[Forbes]]'' credited Richardson's reforms in naming [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], the best city in the United States for business and careers. The [[Cato Institute]], meanwhile, has consistently rated Richardson as one of the most fiscally responsible Democratic governors in the nation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cato.org/fiscal-policy-report-card-americas-governors|title=Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors|newspaper=Cato Institute|access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref>

In March 2006, Richardson vetoed legislation that would ban the use of [[eminent domain]] to transfer property to private developers, as allowed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s 2005 decision in ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.freenewmexican.com/news/40445.html |title=Governor vetoes eminent domain legislation |newspaper=[[The Santa Fe New Mexican]] |date=March 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303170753/http://www.freenewmexican.com/news/40445.html |archive-date=March 3, 2007 }}</ref> He promised to work with the legislature to draft new legislation addressing the issue in the 2007 legislative session.

On September 7, 2006, Richardson flew to [[Sudan]] to meet Sudanese President [[Omar Al-Bashir]] and successfully negotiated the release of imprisoned journalist [[Paul Salopek]]. The Sudanese had charged Salopek with espionage on August 26, 2006, while on a ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' assignment. In January 2007, at the request of the [[Save Darfur Coalition]], he brokered a 60-day cease-fire between al-Bashir and leaders of several rebel factions in [[Darfur]], the western Sudanese region. The cease-fire never became effective, however, with allegations of breaches on all sides.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/11/world/africa/11darfur.html?th&emc=th |title=U.S. Governor Brokers Truce For Darfur |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 11, 2007 | first=Lydia | last=Polgreen}}</ref>

Richardson won his second term as Governor of [[New Mexico]] on November 7, 2006, 68–32% against former [[New Mexico]] Republican Party Chairman [[John Dendahl]]. Richardson received the highest percentage of votes in any gubernatorial election in the state's history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sic.state.nm.us/governor.htm |title=Council Members: Governor Bill Richardson |publisher= New Mexico State Investment Council.

In December 2006, Richardson announced that he would support a ban on [[cockfight]]ing in New Mexico.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.freenewmexican.com/news/54348.html |title=Governor will support a ban on cockfighting |work=[[The Santa Fe New Mexican]] |date=December 27, 2006}}</ref> On March 12, 2007, Richardson signed into law a bill that banned cockfighting in New Mexico.

During New Mexico's 2007 legislative session, Richardson signed a bill into law that made New Mexico the 12th state to legalize [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] for [[medical marijuana|medical reasons]]. When asked if this would hurt him in a Presidential election, he stated that it did not matter, as it was "the right thing to do".<ref>{{cite news |title=New Mexico Bars Drug Charge When Overdose Is Reported |first=Ralph |last=Blumenthal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/us/05drugs.html?fta=y |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 5, 2007 |access-date=November 24, 2010 |quote=The governor lobbied strongly for the medical marijuana bill, which he said could hurt his presidential prospects but was "the right thing to do."}}</ref>

During 2008 and 2009, Richardson faced "possible legal issues" while a [[federal grand jury]] investigated [[Pay to play|pay-to-play]] allegations in the awarding of a lucrative state contract to a company that gave campaign contributions to Richardson's [[political action committee]], Moving America Forward.<ref>{{Cite journal

In December 2010, while still serving as governor, Richardson returned to North Korea in an unofficial capacity at the invitation of the North's chief nuclear negotiator [[Kim Kye Gwan]]. Upon arriving in [[Pyongyang]] on December 16, Richardson told reporters that his "objective is to see if we can reduce the tension on the Korean peninsula, that is my objective. I am going to have a whole series of talks with North Korean officials here and I look forward to my discussions", he said.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/12/201012162339644529.html|title=US governor visits North Korea|publisher=Aljazeera|date=December 16, 2010|access-date=December 16, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101217050754/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/12/201012162339644529.html| archive-date= December 17, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> On December 19, Richardson said his talks with North Korean officials made "some progress" in trying to resolve what he calls a "very tense" situation. Speaking from Pyongyang, Richardson told U.S. television network [[CNN]] that a North Korean general he met was receptive to his proposal for setting up a hotline between [[North Korean Army|North]] and [[South Korean Army|South Korean forces]], and also was open to his idea for a military commission to monitor disputes in and around the [[Yellow Sea]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/UN-Security-Council-in-Emergency-Talks-on-Korean-Tensions-112153499.html|title=UN Security Council in Emergency Talks on Korean Tensions|newspaper=[[Voice of America]]|date=December 19, 2010|access-date=December 19, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223063807/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/UN-Security-Council-in-Emergency-Talks-on-Korean-Tensions-112153499.html|archive-date=December 23, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After his return from North Korea, Richardson dealt with the issue of a pardon for [[William H. Bonney]], aka Billy the Kid, for killing Sheriff [[William J. Brady]] of [[Lincoln County, New Mexico]], some 130 years before. Following up on the promise of a pardon at the time by then-territorial governor [[Lew Wallace]], Richardson said he could not pardon Bonney posthumously because he did not want to second-guess his predecessor's decision. "It was a very close call", Richardson said. "The romanticism appealed to me to issue a pardon, but the facts and the evidence did not support it."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/12/31/new.mexico.billy/index.html?hpt=T2|title=No pardon for Billy the Kid|website=[[CNN]]|last=Gast|first=Phil|date=December 31, 2010|access-date=December 31, 2010}}</ref>

==Allegations of corruption==
During the 2012 trial ''United States of America v. Carollo, Goldberg and Grimm'', the former CDR employee Doug Goldberg testified that he was involved in giving Bill Richardson campaign contributions amounting to $100,000 in exchange for his company CDR being hired to handle a $400 million swap deal for the New Mexico state government.

During his testimony, Doug Goldberg stated that he had been given an envelope containing a check for $25,000 payable to Moving America Forward, Bill Richardson's [[political action committee]], by his boss Stewart Wolmark and told to deliver it to Bill Richardson at a fund raiser. When Goldberg handed the envelope to Richardson, he allegedly told Goldberg to "Tell the big guy [Stewart Wolmark] I'm going to hire you guys".

Goldberg went on to testify that CDR was hired but that he later learned that another firm was hired by Richardson to perform the actual work required and that Stewart Wolmark had given Richardson a further $75,000 in contributions.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-scam-wall-street-learned-from-the-mafia-20120620?print=true|title=The Scam Wall Street Learned From the Mafia|first=Matt|last=Taibbi|author-link=Matt Taibbi|date=June 21, 2012|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref>
