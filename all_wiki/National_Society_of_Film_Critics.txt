==History==
National Society of Film Critics was founded in 1966 in the New York City apartment of ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' critic [[Hollis Alpert]], one of several co-founding [[film critics]] who was refused membership to the [[New York Film Critics Circle]], as it preferred critics who worked for mainstream newspapers.<ref name=bg>{{cite news |first=Valerie J.|last=Nelson|title= Hollis Alpert, at 91; author cofounded film critic society

The organization is known for its highbrow tastes, and its annual awards are one of the most prestigious film critics awards in the United States. In past years, many of its [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film|Best Picture]] winners have been foreign films and the choices rarely parallel the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Academy Awards]]. It has agreed with the Oscar in seven instances over the past forty years: 1977's ''[[Annie Hall]]'', 1992's ''[[Unforgiven]]'', 1993's ''[[Schindler's List]]'', 2004's ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'', 2009's ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', 2015's ''[[Spotlight (film)|Spotlight]]'' and 2016's ''[[Moonlight (2016 film)|Moonlight]]''.<ref name="wrap">{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/inside-llewyn-davis-dominates-national-society-film-critics-awards | title='Inside Llewyn Davis' Dominates National Society of Film Critics Awards | date=January 4, 2014 | accessdate=November 11, 2014 | publisher=[[TheWrap]]}}</ref><ref name="latimes" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/columns/national-society-of-film-critics-offers-a-more-civil-awards-season-alternative-1201031450/ | title=National Society of Film Critics Offers a More Civil Awards-Season Alternative | date=January 9, 2014 | accessdate=November 11, 2014 | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> Five other winners did receive the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film: ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'', ''[[Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie]]'' (''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie''), ''[[La nuit américaine]]'' (''Day for Night''), ''[[Préparez vos mouchoirs]]'' (''Get Out Your Handkerchiefs''), and ''[[Amour (2012 film)|Amour]]''.
