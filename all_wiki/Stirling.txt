'''Stirling''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɜɹ|l|ɪ|ŋ}}; {{lang-sco|Stirlin}}; {{lang-gd|Sruighlea}} {{IPA-gd|ˈs̪t̪ɾuʝlə|}}) is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] in [[Central Belt|central]] [[Scotland]], {{convert|26|mi|km}} north-east of [[Glasgow]] and {{convert|37|mi|km}} north-west of the Scottish capital, [[Edinburgh]].

Located on the [[River Forth]], Stirling is the administrative centre for the [[Stirling (council area)|Stirling council area]], and is traditionally the county town of [[Stirlingshire]].

Once the capital of Scotland, Stirling is visually dominated by [[Stirling Castle]]. Stirling also has a medieval parish church, the [[Church of the Holy Rude]], where, on 29 July 1567, the infant [[James VI]] was anointed King of Scots by [[Adam Bothwell]], the [[Bishop of Orkney]], with the service concluding after a sermon by [[John Knox]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stair-Kerr|first1=Eric|title=Stirling Castle: its place in Scottish history|date=1913|publisher=James Maclehose and Sons|location=Glasgow|page=79|url=https://archive.org/stream/stirlingcastleit00stai#page/79/mode/1up/|accessdate=5 April 2017}}</ref> The poet King was educated by [[George Buchanan]] and grew up in Stirling. He was later also crowned King of England and Ireland on 25 July 1603, bringing closer the countries of the United Kingdom.

Modern Stirling is a centre for local government, higher education, tourism, retail, and industry. The mid-2012 census estimate for the population of [[list of towns and cities in Scotland by population#Localities|the city]] is 36,440; the wider Stirling council area has a population of about 93,750.<ref>{{cite web|title=Population estimates|url=http://my.stirling.gov.uk/services/council-and-government/council-information-performance-and-statistics/population-estimates|website=Stirling Council|accessdate=4 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107015420/http://my.stirling.gov.uk/services/council-and-government/council-information-performance-and-statistics/population-estimates|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

One of the principal royal strongholds of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], Stirling was created a [[royal burgh]] by [[David I of Scotland|King David I]] in 1130. In 2002, as part of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]]'s [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee]], Stirling was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]].

[[File:Old bridge Stirling Scotland.jpg|Old bridge Stirling Scotland|right|thumb|The Auld Brig at Stirling]]The castle rock has been strategically significant since at least the [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation of Britain]], due to its naturally defensible [[crag and tail]] hill: the bedrock on which Stirling Castle was built.

Nevertheless, Stirling enjoys a unique position on the border between the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] and [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]].

After the blockades of the World Wars there was some increase in the use of the port including a tea trade with India. However, with normal shipping lanes open, the growth of the railways including The [[Forth Rail Bridge]], left the harbour uneconomical and by the mid 20th century the port had ceased to operate.

Stirling is renowned as the ''Gateway to the Highlands'' and is generally regarded as occupying a strategic position at the point where the flatter, largely undulating Scottish Lowlands meet the rugged slopes of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] along the [[Highland Boundary Fault]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=crxqdevlel8C&pg=PA271|title=Scotland|last=Miers|first=Richenda|page=271|publisher=The Globe Pequot Press|year=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aynVaKQqJCgC&pg=PA213|title=Scotland|publisher=APA Publications|author=Josephine Buchanan|year=2003|page=213|accessdate=6 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605201330/http://books.google.com/books?id=aynVaKQqJCgC&pg=PA213|archive-date=5 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The starkness of this contrast is evidenced by the many hills and mountains of the lower Highlands such as [[Ben Vorlich (Loch Lomond)|Ben Vorlich]] and [[Ben Ledi]] which can be seen to the northwest of the city. On the other hand, the [[Carse|Carse of Stirling]], stretching to the west and east of the city, is one of the flattest and most agriculturally productive expanses of land in the whole of Scotland.

The land surrounding Stirling<ref>{{cite web|title=OS 10-mile Geological|url=http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=11&lat=56.1181&lon=-3.9360&layers=10geol&b=1|website=National Library of Scotland|accessdate=3 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130162106/http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=11&lat=56.1181&lon=-3.9360&layers=10geol&b=1|archive-date=30 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> has been most affected by [[glacial]] erosion and [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]]. The city itself has grown up around its castle which stands atop an ancient [[quartz-dolerite]] [[Sill (geology)|sill]], known as the [[Stirling Sill]], a major defensive position which was at the lowest crossing point on the River Forth. Stirling stands on the Forth at the point where the river widens and becomes [[tide|tidal]]. To the east of the city the [[Ochil Hills]] dominate the skyline with the highest peak in the range being [[Ben Cleuch]], although [[Dumyat]] is more noticeable from Stirling. The Ochils meet the flat [[carse]] ([[floodplain]]) of the River Forth to the east of the distinctive geographical feature of [[Abbey Craig]], a [[crag and tail]] hill upon which stands the 220&nbsp;ft (67 m) high [[Wallace Monument|National Wallace Monument]].<ref>''Gazetteer for Scotland'' [http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst10406.html Abbey Craig] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105025259/http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst10406.html |date=5 January 2012 }}</ref>

==Areas of Stirling==
'''Top of the Town''' consists of Broad Street, Castle Wynd, Ballengeich Pass, Lower Castle Hill Road, Darnley Street, Baker Street ( formerly Baxters St), St John Street and St Mary's Wynd. These streets all lead up to Stirling Castle and are the favourite haunt of tourists who stop off at the Old Town Jail, [[Mar's Wark]], [[Argyll's Lodging]] and the castle.  Ballengeich Pass leads to the graveyard at Ballengeich and the Castle Wynd winds past the old graveyard. The Top of the Town from Broad Street upwards is renowned for its cobblestoned roads, and cars can be heard rattling over the cobblestones on the way down. Craft shops and tourist-focused shops are evident on the way up and once at the top, panoramic views are available across Stirling and beyond.

==Economy==
{{more citations needed section|date=January 2017}}

At the centre of a large rural agricultural hinterland that encompasses some of the flattest and most productive land in Scotland, Stirling principally functioned as a [[market town]], symbolised by its [[Mercat cross]], with farmers coming to sell their products and wares in the large agricultural market that was held in the town. Today, agriculture still plays a part in the economic life of Stirling, given its focus at the heart of a large rural area, but to a much lesser extent than previously.

With Stirling's development as a market town and its location as the focus of transport and communications in the region, it has developed a substantial [[retail]] sector serving a wide range of surrounding communities as well as the city itself. Primarily centred on the city centre, there are a large number of chain stores, as well as the [[Thistles Centre|Thistles]] [[Shopping mall|shopping centre]]. However this has been augmented by out-of-town developments such as the Springkerse Retail Park on the city bypass to the east of Stirling, and the development of a large [[Sainsbury's]] in [[Raploch|the Raploch]].

A major new [[Urban renewal|regeneration project]] on the site of the former port area and the {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} former Ministry of Defence site, adjacent to [[Stirling railway station, Scotland|Stirling Railway Station]], is currently underway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stirling.gov.uk/index/council/news.htm?id=33314 |title=Stirling Council: Council » Latest News |publisher=Stirling.gov.uk |accessdate=14 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926231727/http://www.stirling.gov.uk/index/council/news.htm?id=33314 |archive-date=26 September 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Known as Forthside, it has the aim of developing a new waterfront district linked to the railway station via a new pedestrian bridge. The development comprises retail, residential and commercial elements, including a conference centre, hotel and [[Vue (cinema)|Vue]] multiplex cinema, that will ultimately expand the city centre area, linking it to the River Forth, which has been cut off from the city centre area since the construction of the [[A9 road (Great Britain)|A9 bypass]] under the railway station in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.instirling.com/initve/intve.htm |title=InStirling report on Forthside project |publisher=Instirling.com |accessdate=14 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727025801/http://www.instirling.com/initve/intve.htm |archive-date=27 July 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> For the first time in 100 years, local people will have access to the banks of the River Forth in the city centre with landscaped public areas, footpaths, cycleways and an improved public transport network.

In the service sector, [[financial services]] as well as [[tourism]] are the biggest employers. The financial services and insurance company [[Prudential plc|Prudential]] have a large and well-established base at Craigforth on the outskirts of Stirling. In terms of tourism, the presence of such historical monuments as Stirling Castle, the [[National Wallace Monument]] and other nearby attractions like [[Blair Drummond Safari Park]], the key role which Stirling has played in [[History of Scotland|Scottish history]], as well as the scenery of the area, has bolstered Stirling's position as an important tourist destination in Scotland.

The [[University of Stirling]] and [[Stirling Council]] are two of the biggest employers in the area. Knowledge related industries, [[research and development]] as well as [[life sciences]] have clustered around the university in the Stirling University Innovation Park, close to its main campus. Other public sector agencies that are major employers in the city include [[Police Scotland]], [[Cornton Vale (HM Prison)|Scottish Prison Service]], [[NHS Forth Valley]] and the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]].

Mauchline ware started producing wooden snuff-boxes in 1790 in [[Mauchline]], Ayrshire. They were produced of the wood from the trees from the Castle craig.

Local bus services to districts within the city are almost completely provided by buses operated by [[First Scotland East]]. The surrounding towns, like [[Bridge of Allan]], [[Alloa]], [[Falkirk]] and [[Glasgow]] via [[Cumbernauld]] have services from the bus station.

Coaches to many [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population|Scottish towns and cities]] also run regularly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stirling Bus Station|url=http://my.stirling.gov.uk/services/transport-and-streets/public-and-community-transport/public-transport-information/transport-stations,-stops-and-shelters/stirling-bus-station|website=Stirling Council|accessdate=6 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407055051/http://my.stirling.gov.uk/services/transport-and-streets/public-and-community-transport/public-transport-information/transport-stations,-stops-and-shelters/stirling-bus-station|archive-date=7 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Services to [[Alloa railway station|Alloa]], [[Bridge of Allan]], [[Falkirk]] and [[Dunblane railway station|Dunblane]] also run. Stirling Council provides some approximate journey times.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stirling Train Station and Services|url=http://my.stirling.gov.uk/services/transport-and-streets/public-and-community-transport/public-transport-information/transport-stations,-stops-and-shelters/stirling-train-station-and-services|website=Stirling Council|accessdate=6 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407055250/http://my.stirling.gov.uk/services/transport-and-streets/public-and-community-transport/public-transport-information/transport-stations,-stops-and-shelters/stirling-train-station-and-services|archive-date=7 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Working lines include the [[Highland Main Line]], the [[Edinburgh–Dunblane line]] and the [[Croy Line]]. The station formerly provided direct railway services to [[Callander]] and [[Oban]], and to [[Loch Lomond]], over very scenic lines, and a fast service to [[Dunfermline]].
