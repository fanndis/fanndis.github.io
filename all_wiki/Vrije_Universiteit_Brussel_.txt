The '''Vrije Universiteit Brussel''' ('''VUB''') {{Audio|Nl-Vrije Universiteit Brussel.ogg|listen}} (English: '''Free University of Brussels-VUB''') is a [[Dutch language|Dutch]]- and English-speaking research university located in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].<ref name="HigherEducationRegister">The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is one of the five universities officially recognised by the [[Flemish Community|Flemish government]].

The Vrije Universiteit Brussel was formed by the splitting in 1970 of the [[Free University of Brussels (1834–1969)|Free University of Brussels]], which was founded in 1834 by the Flemish-Brussels lawyer [[Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen]].

== History ==
{{main|Free University of Brussels (1834–1969)}}

=== Establishment of a university in Brussels ===
The history of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel is closely linked with that of [[Belgium]] itself. At the time of the declaration of independence of Belgium in 1830, two state universities existed in the cities of [[Ghent]] and [[Liège]]. In Brussels, the capital of the newly established country, a university was lacking. A group of leading [[intellectual]]s in the fields of arts, science, and education – amongst whom [[Auguste Baron]] and the astronomer and mathematician [[Adolphe Quetelet]] — pointed out the advantages of a university to the new capital and country.<ref name="Witte1996"/> Initially, they sought for the establishment of a state university, but the Belgian government showed little enthusiasm due to the onerous financial burden of yet another state university.

In 1834, the Belgian [[episcopate]] decided to establish a Catholic university in [[Mechelen]] with the aim of regaining the influence of the Catholic Church on the academic scene in Belgium, and the Belgian government had the intent to close the university at Leuven and donate the buildings to the Catholic institution.<ref name="Lamberts1990">{{Cite book

}}</ref> The liberals in Belgium strongly opposed to this decision, and furthered their ideas for a university in Brussels as a counterbalance to the Catholic institution. At the same time, Auguste Baron had just become a member of the [[Freemasonry|freemasonic]] lodge "Les Amis Philantropes", as had a large number of other intellectuals with enlightened ideas. Baron was able to convince [[Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen]], the president of the lodge, to support the idea for a new university. On 24 June 1834, Verhaegen presented his plan to establish a free university.<ref name="Witte1996"/>

After sufficient funding was collected among advocates, the Université libre de Bruxelles was inaugurated on 20 November 1834, in the Gothic room of the city hall of Brussels. After its establishment, the Université libre de Bruxelles faced difficult times, since it did receive no [[Subsidy|subsidies]] or grants from the government; yearly fundraising events and tuition fees provided the only financial means. Verhaegen, who became a professor and later head of the new university, gave it a mission statement which he summarized in a speech to [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]]: the principle of ''free inquiry'' and academic freedom uninfluenced by any political or religious [[authority]].<ref name="Witte1996"/>

=== Splitting of the university ===
In the nineteenth century, courses at the Université libre de Bruxelles were taught exclusively in French, the language of the upper class in Belgium at that time. However, with the Dutch-speaking population asking for more rights in Belgium, some courses were already taught in Dutch at the Faculty of Law as early as 1935. Nevertheless, it was not until 1963 that all faculties offered their courses in Dutch.<ref name="HistoryVrijeUniversiteitBrussel">{{cite web
 |url = http://www.vub.ac.be/english/home/about.html
 |title = About the University: Culture and History
 |accessdate = 25 November 2007
 |publisher = Vrije Universiteit Brussel
}}</ref> On 1 October 1969, the university was finally split in two sister institutions: the French-speaking Université libre de Bruxelles and the Dutch-speaking Vrije Universiteit Brussel. This splitting became official by the law of 28 May 1970, of the Belgian parliament, by which the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and the Université libre de Bruxelles became two separate [[Juristic person|legal entities]].<ref name="Law28May1970">{{cite web

== Organisation ==
The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is an independent institution. The members of all its governing entities are elected by the entire academic community – including [[Faculty (division)|faculty staff]], researchers, personnel, and students.<ref name="Statutes"/> This system guarantees the democratic process of decision-making and the independence from state and outside organisations. Nevertheless, the university receives significant funding from the Flemish government, although less than other [[List of Belgian universities|Flemish universities]]. Other important funding sources are grants for research projects (mostly from [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[European Union|European]] funding agencies), scholarships of academic members, revenues from cooperation with industry, and [[Tuition|tuition fees]] to a lesser extent.

The main organisational structure of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel is its division into [[Faculty (division)|faculties]]:<ref name="VUB Faculties">See the {{cite web
 |url = http://www.vub.ac.be/english/home/faculties.html

*Faculty of Law and Criminology
*Faculty of Social Sciences & Solvay Business School
*Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences
*Faculty of Sciences and Bio-engineering Sciences
*Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy
*Faculty of Arts and Philosophy
*Faculty of Engineering
*Faculty of Physical Education and Physiotherapy
These faculties benefit a wide [[autonomy]] over how they structure their educational programmes and research efforts, although their decisions need to comply with the university's statutes and must be approved by the central administration.

The [[Central Administration|central administration]] is formed by the Governing Board, which is currently presided by Eddy Van Gelder. It decides the university's long-term vision and must approve all decisions made by the faculties. The Governing Board is supported by three advising bodies: the Research Council, the Education Council, and the Senate. These bodies provide advice to the Governing Board on all issues regarding research, education, and the academic excellence of faculty staff, and may also propose changes to the university's strategy. The daily management of the university is the responsibility of the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] and three Vice-Rectors. The current Rector of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel is Prof. Dr. Caroline Pauwels[4] <ref name="VUB Organogram">See the {{cite web

== Education ==
{{see also|List of educational programmes at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel}}
The Vrije Universiteit Brussel offers [[Course (education)|courses]] in a large variety of modern disciplines: law, economics, [[social sciences]], management, [[psychology]], [[physical sciences]], [[life sciences]], [[medical sciences]], [[pharmaceutical sciences]], [[humanities]], engineering, [[physical education]]. About 12,000 students follow one of its [[List of educational programmes at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel|128 educational programmes]].<ref name="EducationalProgrammes">According to the {{cite web
 |url = http://www.vub.ac.be/en/programmes
 |title = official list of educational programmes at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel
 |accessdate = 15 August 2013
 |publisher = Vrije Universiteit Brussel
}}</ref> All programmes are taught in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], but 59 are also taught in English. In agreement with the [[Bologna process]], the university has implemented the so-called bachelor-master system. It therefore issues four types of [[Academic degree|degrees]]: bachelor's, master's, master after master's, and [[Doctorate|doctoral]] degrees.

[[University and college admissions|Admission]] to the programmes is generally not restricted; anyone can subscribe to the programme of his/her choice. However, prerequisite degrees may be mandatory for advanced programmes, e.g., a bachelor's degree is required to subscribe to a master's programme, and a master's degree is required to subscribe to a master after master's or doctoral programme. An exception to this is the admission exam to the bachelor in medicine, which is required following ruling of the Flemish government. Tuition fees are low, and even decreased or eliminated for some students with less financial means.

The [[Academic term|academic year]] is divided into two semesters, each spanning thirteen course weeks: the first semester lasts from October to January, the second semester from February to June. Students take [[Test (student assessment)|exams]] in January and June. Apart from the Christmas and Easter holidays (both lasting two weeks) that are normally used to prepare for the exams, students are free the week between both semesters and during the summer vacations from July to September.

The university has implemented several [[quality control]] schemes in order to preserve the high quality of its educational programmes. Each semester, all students [[Evaluation|evaluate]] the courses they have followed. All programmes are also regularly assessed by internal panels and by external international visitation committees. Furthermore, all programmes are accredited by the [[NVAO|Nederlands-Vlaamse Accreditatie Organisatie]], an independent accreditation organisation charged with the [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] of higher education programmes in both [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]].<ref name="NVAO">Accreditation details can be consulted at {{cite web

== Basic principles ==
The Vrije Universiteit Brussel considers itself an open-minded and tolerant university.<ref name="Smaakmaker">{{Cite journal

 | language=nl}}</ref> Its central principles are the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and in particular the principle of ''free inquiry'' for the progress of humanity. The latter includes the dismissal of any argument of authority and the right of free opinion.<ref name="Statutes"/> The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is the only Flemish university that has incorporated such principle in its statutes. The principle of free inquiry is often described by a quotation of the French [[mathematician]] and philosopher [[Henri Poincaré]]:
[[File:VUB schild2.png|right|225px|Seal of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]
{{quote
|text= 
Thinking must never submit itself,<br />
neither to a dogma,<br />
nor to a party,<br />
nor to a passion,<br />
nor to an interest,<br />
nor to a preconceived idea,<br />
nor to anything whatsoever,<br />
except to the facts themselves,<br />
because for it to submit to anything else would be the end of its existence.
|sign=}}
This principle is also reflected in the university's [[motto]] ''Scientia vincere tenebras'', or ''Conquering darkness by science'', and in its seal. The seal of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel displays a beggar's wallet and joined hands on the orange-white-blue (the colours of the [[William the Silent|Prince of Orange]]) [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] in the [[emblem]], referring to the struggle of the Protestant [[Geuzen]] and the [[William the Silent|Prince of Orange]] against the oppressive Spanish rule and the [[Inquisition]] in the sixteenth century.

Another basic principle of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel – also incorporated in the university's statutes – is that the institution must be managed according to the model of democracy.<ref name="Statutes"/> Practically, this means that all members of the academic community — [[Faculty (division)|faculty staff]], researchers, personnel, and students – are represented in all governing bodies. In this way, the university ensures that everyone has a voice in its decision-making processes and participates in its management. This principle must also guarantee the independence of the university and the academic freedom.

== Campus and facilities ==
[[File:VUB campus Etterbeek.JPG|thumb|[[Etterbeek]] campus]]
''Brussels Humanities, Sciences & Engineering Campus''<br>
Most of the faculties are located on the [[Etterbeek]] campus (which is actually located on the territory of the neighbouring borough of [[Elsene]]). It is the livelier of the two campuses and consists almost entirely of concrete structures, most built in the 1970s. Some are decaying rapidly but at least one, the Rectoraat designed by [[Renaat Braem]], is heritage-listed.<ref>https://www.vub.ac.be/downloads/GebouwM-NL.pdf</ref>  Activities take place in numerous auditoriums and labs. In addition, there is a modern sports centre, a football pitch encircled by a running track, and a swimming pool. For eating out, there is a restaurant with subsidies for students and staff, and the bars/cafes 't Complex, Opinio, and KultuurKaffee. The {{Interlanguage link multi|KultuurKaffee|nl}} was a full-fledged concert venue during the evening/night, offering the university a cultural scene and organising free concerts and events. It was demolished to make space for the new XY construction project in 2015.<ref>{{cite web

''Brussels Health Campus''<br>
The campus in [[Jette]] is also a fully-fledged campus. The University Hospital ({{Interlanguage link multi|UZ Brussel|nl}}) is in the vicinity. All courses and research in the [[life sciences]] (medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, the biomedical and paramedical sciences) are located here.

''Brussels Technology Campus''<br>
The campus Kaai in [[Anderlecht]] was established in 2013 and shared with the [[Erasmushogeschool Brussel]]. It houses the Industrial Engineering section of the Faculty of Engineering. Among extensive industrial laboratory facilities, the Brussels fablab<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fablab-brussels.be|title=Fablab Brussels|publisher=}}</ref> has grown to the centre of activity on the campus in recent years.

==Clinical Cardiac Electrophysiology==
[[File:Vubep.jpg|thumbnail]]

The Heart Rhythm Management Centre started its activities at the University Hospital UZ Brussel during spring 2007. The clinical activities soon rocketed to the #1 position in Belgium, and has been paralleled by important scientific production. Emerging fields of activity are multidisciplinary (clinical) and translational (research) programs in collaboration with the departments of Genetics, Pediatrics, Neonatology, Geriatrics, Neurology, as well as a fundamental research program in Physiology. 
The large scope of clinical activities, fuelled by increasing patient demand in Belgium and elsewhere, together with the presence of a state-of-the-art infrastructure and a research-stimulating multidisciplinary academic environment unique in Europe, as well as the intrinsic qualities of Professor Prof. Dr. Pedro Brugada and his team, are a unique opportunity for the Vrije Universiteit Brussel to implement this academic training program.

This Postgraduate course in Cardiac Electrophysiology and Pacing – is offered within the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy – after a specialization in Cardiology, and is supported by the Institute for Postgraduate Training of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (iPAVUB). The core faculty for the Postgraduate program includes Prof. Dr. Pedro Brugada, who directs the EP fellowship training and the Cardiovascular Department, Prof. Dr. Carlo de Asmundis, Director of the Heart rhythm Management Centre, Prof. Dr. Gian Battista Chierchia, Director of Atrial Fibrillation Program, Prof. Dr. Marc La Meir and Prof. Dr. Francis Wellens, Director of Cardiac Surgery Service. Additional faculty who participate in the program includes: Prof. Dr. Bonduelle Mary-Louise and Prof. Dr. Ramon Brugada, who trains fellows in cardiac genetics, Prof. Dr. Joel Smets, University of Nijmegen, Nederland, who trains fellows in electrocardiography and basic electrophysiology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vub.ac.be/en/study/cardiac-electrophysiology-and-pacing|title=Cardiac Electrophysiology and Pacing|publisher=vub.ac.be}}</ref>

== Student life ==
[[File:Penne CM.jpg|thumb|A traditional ''klak'' or ''penne'']]

The BSG is the umbrella organisation for all other student organizations and acts as the defender of the moral interests of the students. Together with their French-speaking counterparts ACE at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|ULB]], they organise the annual [[St V]] memorial.

These are some of the student organizations at the VUB:
*Studiekring vrij onderzoek: a collective of students from various faculties, promoting free inquiry through the organisation of debates, lectures and more
*Letteren-en Wijsbegeertekring (LWK): for students studying at the Arts and Philosophy faculty
*Perskring (Pers): for students studying Communication Sciences <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.perskring.com/over-perskring/|last=PERS}}</ref>
*Geneeskundige Kring (GK) and Farmaceutische Kring (FK): for students studying at the Medicine and Pharmacy faculty
*Polytechnische Kring (PK) for students studying at the Engineering faculty
*Psycho-Pedagogische Kring (PPK): for students studying at the Psychology and Educational Sciences faculty
*Kring der Politieke Economische en Sociale Wetenschappen (KEPS) and Solvay ($); for students studying at the Economics and Political faculty
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Wetenschappelijke Kring (WK)|nl}}: for students studying at the faculty of Sciences and Bio-engineering Sciences
*Mens Sana in Corpore Sano (Mesacosa or MC): for students studying at the Physical Education and Physiotherapy faculty
*Vlaams Rechtsgenootschap (VRG): for students studying at the Law and Criminology faculty
*Vrije Universiteit Brussel Model United Nations (VUBMUN): for all students of the VUB.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vub.ac.be/vubmun/|title=Vrije Universiteit Brussel Model United Nations|last=VUBMUN}}</ref>

Members of these organizations ''(except VUBMUN)'' wear a ''[[Student cap|klak]]'' (Dutch) or ''penne'' (French).

Furthermore, the VUB has student organizations for students with a specific regional background.
