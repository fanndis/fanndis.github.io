'''Sloane Stephens''' (born March 20, 1993) is an American professional [[tennis]] player. She achieved a career-best ranking of No. 3 in the world after Wimbledon in 2018. Stephens was the [[2017 US Open (tennis)|2017 US Open]] champion, and has won six WTA singles titles in total.

Born to athletic parents with backgrounds in collegiate swimming and professional American football, Stephens was first introduced to tennis at the club across the street from her house in [[Fresno, California]]. Her stepfather was a competitive recreational tennis player and served as her primary inspiration for beginning to play the sport. Stephens moved to Florida to train at a tennis academy, ultimately working with [[Nick Saviano]] for many years. She developed into a promising junior player, reaching a career-high ITF junior ranking of world No. 5 and winning three out of four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] girls' doubles titles in 2010 alongside her partner [[Tímea Babos]].

While still just 19 years old, Stephens rose to prominence at the [[2013 Australian Open]] with a semifinal run highlighted by an upset of then-world No. 3 [[Serena Williams]]. Although she climbed to as high as No. 11 towards the end of that year, she later regressed and stayed steadily ranked outside the top 25 through the end of 2015. At this point, Stephens switched to a new coach, [[Kamau Murray]], under whom she returned to an elite level and won three WTA titles in the first half of 2016. Her successful year was then cut short by a foot injury that kept her sidelined for eleven months.

She returned from injury in the middle of 2017 and won her first Grand Slam singles title at the US Open in just her fifth tournament back. She was also awarded [[WTA Comeback Player of the Year]] for her successful season. In 2018, Stephens continued her success by winning her first [[WTA Premier tournaments|Premier Mandatory]] title at the [[2018 Miami Open|Miami Open]], reaching a second Grand Slam singles final at the [[2018 French Open|French Open]], entering the top 10 for the first time, and finishing runner-up at the [[2018 WTA Finals|WTA Finals]].

==Early life and background==
Stephens was born on March 20, 1993 in [[Plantation, Florida]] to [[Sybil Smith]] and [[John Stephens (American football)|John Stephens]], both of whom were accomplished athletes. Her mother was the first [[African-American]] woman to be named a first-team All-American swimmer in Division I history. She is enshrined in the [[Boston University]] Athletic Hall of Fame and recognized as the greatest swimmer in the history of the university.<ref name="smith-hof">{{cite web |title=Sybil Smith |url=http://goterriers.com/hof.aspx?hof=204 |website=Boston University Athletic Hall of Fame |accessdate=June 20, 2018}}</ref> Stephens's father was a [[Pro Bowl]] running back for the [[New England Patriots]] in the [[National Football League]].<ref name="nyt-father">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/05/sports/tennis/05stephens.html?scp=1&sq=sloane%20stephens&st=cse| title=For a Rising Tennis Star, a Connection, Then Dealing With Loss | publisher="New York Times Straight Sets Blog" | accessdate=December 27, 2009 | first=Karen | last=Crouse | date=September 5, 2009}}</ref> Pro Football Hall of Famer [[Raymond Berry]] regarded him as the best athlete he had ever seen.<ref name="best-athlete">{{cite web |title=A Father's Pride |url=http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/57519810/sloane-stephens-father-john-new-england-patriots-running-back |website=Sports on Earth |accessdate=June 20, 2018}}</ref>

With an improved ranking, Stephens was able to play WTA Tour-level events the entire season.<ref name=core /> Early in the year, she played in her first [[2012 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]] main draw and made it to the second round.<ref>{{cite web |title=Australian Open – Sloane Stephens reaches second round |url=https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/WTA_Tennis/3115/australian-open-sloane-stephens-reaches-second-round/ |website=Tennis World USA |accessdate=June 26, 2018}}</ref> Stephens then closed out the winter hard court season by qualifying for the [[2012 Miami Masters|Miami Open]].

After early losses at her first few clay court events of the year, Stephens finished this part of the season with three impressive results.

At the [[2020 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]], Stephens lost in the first round to [[Zhang Shuai (tennis)|Zhang Shuai]], despite serving for the match in the second set.

Stephens also lost in the first round in [[2020 Abierto Mexicano Telcel – Women's Singles|Acapulco]], losing to world No. 270 [[Renata Zarazúa]]. At [[2020 Monterrey Open – Singles|Monterrey]], Stephens beat [[Emma Navarro]] in the first round, before falling to [[Leylah Annie Fernandez]] in the second round.

Though she narrowly lost her first round match at the Western & Southern Open to [[Caroline Garcia]], Stephens showed an improvement in form at the 2020 US Open. She won her opening two matches in straight sets before losing to [[Serena Williams]] in the third round in a very close three-set match that garnered a lot of praise from tennis experts.

==World TeamTennis==

Stephens has played five seasons with [[World TeamTennis]] starting in 2009 when she debuted in the league with the [[New York Buzz]], followed by a season with the [[Washington Kastles]] in 2014, the [[Philadelphia Freedoms]] in 2017 and 2018, and the [[New York Empire (tennis)|New York Empire]] in 2019. It was announced that she will joining the [[Chicago Smash]] for their debut season, during the 2020 WTT season set to begin July 12 at [[The Greenbrier]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://wtt.com/2020/06/16/world-teamtennis-adds-stars-tiafoe-puig-raonic-bouchard-sock-as-rosters-set-for-2020/ |title=World TeamTennis Adds Stars Tiafoe, Puig, Roanic, Bouchard, & Sock As Rosters Set For 2020 |website=WTT.com |date=June 16, 2020 }}</ref>

Sloane played singles for the Smash throughout the season, helping them to earn a No. 2 seed in the WTT Playoffs. Chicago defeated the [[Orlando Storm]] to earn a spot in the final, but ultimately fell to the [[New York Empire (tennis)]] in a Supertiebreaker.

==Rivalries==

===Stephens vs. Halep===
Stephens and Halep have built a rivalry centered around their highest profile matches in 2018.

In the first such match, the [[2018 French Open|French Open]] final, Halep came from a set down to defeat Stephens for her first Grand Slam title. This was only the fourth time in the previous 47 Grand Slam singles finals where the winner of the first set was unable to win the match.<ref>{{cite web |title=Simona Halep beats Sloane Stephens for first Grand Slam title |url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/23742969/simona-halep-wins-french-open-beating-sloane-stephens |website=ESPN |accessdate=December 16, 2018}}</ref> Their next big match, the final at the [[2018 Rogers Cup|Canadian Open]], was ranked as the match of the year by the WTA.

==Playing style==
[[File:Sloane Stephens serves at the US Open (9662688451) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Stephens serving]]
Stephens is an all-court player, having reached the quarterfinals or better at all four majors. Her favorite surface is clay, on which she was a finalist at the [[French Open]].<ref name="favorite-clay">{{cite web |title=Sloane Stephens: "I am happy that I was the last person to win at Key Biscayne" |url=https://www.ubitennis.net/2018/04/sloane-stephens-i-am-happy-that-i-was-the-last-person-to-win-at-key-biscayne/ |website=Ubi Tennis |accessdate=July 4, 2018}}</ref> However, most of her best results have come on hard courts, including her [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and [[Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Open]] titles, as well as five of her six titles in total. She has never won a professional title on grass, and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] is the only Grand Slam event where she has not made it to at least the semifinals.<ref name=itf-profile/>

Stephens often plays behind the baseline, relying on her athleticism to defend against her opponent's shots. She excels at countering powerfully-hit shots, and is capable of turning defense into offense. Stephens' game is commonly referred to as possessing "easy power" due to the seemingly casual nature in which she injects pace into her shots.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Is Sloane Stephens the Future of American Tennis?|url=https://www.elle.com/life-love/society-career/sloane-stephens-profile|last=Goodman|first=Lizzy|date=2014-07-16|website=ELLE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Comment: Simona Halep's Tenacity Too Much For Stephens' 'Easy Power'|url=https://www.ubitennis.net/2018/06/comment-simona-haleps-tenacity-much-stephens-easy-power/|last=Beck|first=James|date=2018-06-09|website=UBITENNIS|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Stephens' win vs. Kasatkina was another casually masterful performance|url=https://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2018/06/stephens-win-vs-kasatkina-was-another-casually-masterful-performance/74447/|website=Tennis.com|access-date=2020-05-22}}</ref> She sometimes flattens out her shots, even on the run, and goes for stinging winners.<ref name="newyorker.com">{{Cite web|title=The Zen of Sloane Stephens|url=https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/the-zen-of-sloane-stephens|last=Marzorati|first=Gerald|website=The New Yorker|language=en|access-date=2020-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=How Sloane Stephens' Subtle Athleticism Brought Her Another Big Title |url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2018/03/sloane-stephens-jelena-ostapenko-miami-open-final-2018/73043/ |website=Tennis.com |accessdate=July 4, 2018}}</ref><ref name="shape">{{cite web |title=Rule the Court Like Tennis Star Sloane Stephens |url=https://www.shape.com/blogs/fit-famous/rule-court-tennis-star-sloane-stephens |website=Shape |accessdate=July 4, 2018}}</ref> Stephens has the ability to hit powerful winners as she takes large swings with her forehand. In contrast, she has a more compact swing with her two-handed backhand. She favors her forehand, and will run around her backhand at times to play her stronger groundstroke.<ref name=profile>{{cite news|title=Sloane Stephens Biography And Detailed Game Analysis|url=http://www.onlinetennisinstruction.com/sloane-stephens-biography-and-detailed-game-analysis/|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}</ref> Stephens excels in point construction, and varies patterns of hitting in order to confuse opponents.<ref name="newyorker.com"/>

Stephens has an uncharacteristic style of play compared to her fellow top-ranked American contemporaries. Whereas the other leading Americans are some of the most aggressive players on the WTA Tour, Stephens has a more passive approach. According to the Aggression Score Metric, which measures a player's aggression based on how quickly they end points — either through a winner, an unforced error, or an opponent's forced error, Stephens has a score of 19.4% — which implies that 19.4% of her shots lead to one of those three outcomes. This score is average compared to other women's tennis players, and rates similarly to fellow Grand Slam tournament winners [[Justine Henin]] and [[Victoria Azarenka]]. In contrast, [[Venus Williams]] is amongst the top 20% of most aggressive players, while Serena Williams, Madison Keys, and [[CoCo Vandeweghe]] are all in the top 10% with aggression scores above 25%.<ref name=economist>{{cite web |title=Sloane Stephens shows you don't have to be aggressive to win a major |url=https://www.economist.com/game-theory/2017/09/12/sloane-stephens-shows-you-dont-have-to-be-aggressive-to-win-a-major |website=The Economist |accessdate=July 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Measuring WTA Tactics With Aggression Score |url=http://www.tennisabstract.com/blog/2015/08/31/measuring-wta-tactics-with-aggression-score/ |website=Heavy Topspin: Tennis Abstract Blog |accessdate=July 4, 2018}}</ref>

Stephens has been perceived as having a nonchalant attitude towards losing matches and striving to meet expectations. Her former junior coach [[Chris Evert]] has questioned her motivation on multiple occasions and attributed stretches of inconsistency at various times in her career to her mentality. On the contrary, Stephens has also shown the ability to use her mindset of not worrying about disappointing outcomes to bounce back from injury and poor tournaments. She demonstrated this type of mindset after her early [[2014 US Open (tennis)|2014 US Open]] loss, saying, "I'm not gonna dwell on this. I'm just gonna keep improving and getting better and looking forward to the next tournaments."<ref name="nonchalant">{{cite web |title=Nonchalant reaction to Wimbledon loss a blessing and curse for Sloane Stephens |url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/23976703/nonchalant-reaction-wimbledon-loss-blessing-curse-sloane-stephens |website=ESPN |accessdate=July 6, 2018}}</ref><ref name="evert1">{{cite web |title=Chris Evert Says Sloane Stephens Lacks Hunger |url=http://www.tennisnow.com/News/-Chris-Evert-Says-Sloane-Stephens-Lacks-Hunger.aspx |website=Tennis Now |accessdate=July 6, 2018}}</ref><ref name="evert2">{{cite web |title=Chris Evert On Sloane Stephens: 'I Question Whether She Has A Burning Desire' |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/filipbondy/2018/01/10/chris-evert-on-sloane-stephens-i-question-whether-she-has-a-burning-desire/#62501cb15020 |website=Forbes |accessdate=July 6, 2018}}</ref>

==Coaches==
[[File:2017 Citi Open Tennis Kamau Murray.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Kamau Murray, Stephens's longterm coach]]
When Stephens was just starting to play tennis at the Sierra Sport and Racquet Club, one of her first instructors was [[Francisco González (tennis)|Francisco González]], a retired professional tennis player once ranked in the top 50. Upon his recommendation, Stephens moved to Florida to train at an elite junior tennis academy.<ref name=book/> Although she started out at the Evert Tennis Academy for a year working with John and [[Chris Evert]], she then moved to the [[Nick Saviano]] High Performance Tennis Academy, where she stayed for several years.<ref name=yahoo/>

[[Roger Smith (tennis)|Roger Smith]] began coaching Stephens in early 2009 and worked with her for several years. With Smith as her coach, she became a top-ranked junior with three Grand Slam tournament doubles titles and also cracked the top 100 of the WTA rankings.<ref name="start-roger">{{cite web |title=Sloane Stephens makes late father, stepfather, U.S. tennis proud in U.S. Open girls juniors |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/sloane-stephens-late-father-stepfather-u-s-tennis-proud-u-s-open-girls-juniors-article-1.440510 |website=New York Daily News |accessdate=July 1, 2018}}</ref> In June 2012, Stephens switched coaches to [[David Nainkin]] in order to try to qualify for the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Qualification|2012 Olympics]].

She parted with him after the 2013 season in order to find a full-time coach. Nainkin had also been working with fellow American [[Sam Querrey]] that year.
