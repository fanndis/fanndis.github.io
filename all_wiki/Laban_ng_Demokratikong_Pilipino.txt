The '''Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino''' ({{literal translation|Fight of Democratic Filipinos}}) is a [[political party]] in the [[Philippines]] founded on September 16, 1988.

There are no results available of the last [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 election]] for the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], but according to the website of the House, the party held 7 out of 235 seats (''State of the Parties, June 2005''). The party is divided into two factions. The faction led by [[Edgardo Angara]] contested in the 2004 elections as a member party of the [[Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino]] (''Coalition of United Filipinos'').

On May 14, 2007 [[2007 Philippine general election|election]], the party won 3 seats in the House of Representatives.<ref>See [[2007 Philippine general election]].</ref>

==History==
In the mid-1980s, the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino (PDP, founded 1982), [[Lakas ng Bayan]] and the Lakas ng Bansa parties became members of the [[United Nationalist Democratic Organization]] (UNIDO) coalition that supported the candidacy of [[Corazon Aquino]] and [[Salvador Laurel]] as President and Vice President respectively in the [[1986 Philippine presidential election|1986 snap election]].<ref name="SE Asia">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YCrTDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA195|title=Southeast Asia In The New International Era|date=2016|accessdate=April 19, 2017|isbn=9780813350110|last1=Dayley|first1=Robert}}</ref> By 1986, the PDP had merged with the Lakas ng Bayan (LABAN, founded 1978) party of the late Senator [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]], to form [[PDP–Laban]].<ref name="SE Asia" />

In the 1987 legislative elections, UNIDO, under the name "Lakas ng Bayan", became the dominant party in both houses of Congress, electing Representative [[Ramon Mitra, Jr.]] of [[Palawan]] as Speaker of the House of Representatives. UNIDO would be dissolved soon after. On September 16, 1988, [[PDP–Laban]] was split into two factions: the Pimentel Wing of [[Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.]] and the Cojuangco Wing of [[Jose Cojuangco, Jr.|Jose "Peping" Cojuangco, Jr.]]. The Cojuangco Wing and the Lakas ng Bansa party of Speaker Mitra merged in 1988 to form the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino party while the Pimentel Wing remained as the PDP–Laban party. In the 1991 LDP National Convention, the party nominated Speaker Mitra as its nominee for [[President of the Philippines]], while runner-up former Defense Secretary [[Fidel V. Ramos]] bolted the party and formed [[Lakas–CMD (1991)|Partido Lakas ng Tao]], and won the presidency in the [[1992 Philippine general election|1992 presidential election]].

In 1994, LDP formed a major coalition with [[Lakas-NUCD-UMDP]] of [[President Ramos]] (dubbed as the "''[[Lakas-Laban Coalition]]''") for the 1995 midterm legislative elections, winning a majority of all seats in both houses of Congress.

In 1997, the party supported the candidacy of then-Vice President [[Joseph Estrada]] for the presidency, merging with two other parties to form the [[Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino]] ({{literal translation|Fight of the Patriotic Filipino Masses}}) party.

==Recent events==
In the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 elections]], the party was critically divided by two factions between its party president Senator [[Edgardo Angara]], who supported the candidacy of party outsider actor [[Fernando Poe Jr]]., and party secretary general Makati representative [[Agapito Aquino]], who supported Senator [[Panfilo Lacson]]'s candidacy for president.

It was planned that the LDP would form the core of the main opposition coalition, the [[Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino]] (KNP). However, members of the party disagreed on which person to support for president. [[Panfilo Lacson]], a member of the party, advanced his candidacy for president but was not considered by [[Edgardo Angara]], the president of the party. Angara supported [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]] Together with the party's secretary-general [[Agapito Aquino|Agapito "Butz" Aquino]], Lacson gathered the support of some members of the party and went ahead with his candidacy. The LDP was subsequently polarized between those supporting Angara and Poe, and those for Lacson and Aquino.

By then, Poe and Lacson have both filed their certificates of candidacies. According to the rules of candidacy, every presidential candidate must have a political party to back him or her. With the obvious split within the ranks of the LDP, and with no signs that the two factions would come to an agreement, the COMELEC decided to informally split the party into the Aquino and the Angara wings. Lacson then ran under the LDP – Aquino Wing, and Poe under the LDP – Angara Wing, which would later become the KNP.

During the campaign period, there had been numerous unification talks between the two factions. The opposition saw the need to become united under one banner to boost their chances of winning the presidential election against the organized political machinery of Arroyo. The plans of unification did not materialize due to the stubbornness of both Poe and Lacson. Lacson wanted Poe to concede to him and run as his vice-presidential candidate while the supporters of Poe wanted Lacson to back-out from his candidacy and instead support Poe, citing his low performance in the surveys.
