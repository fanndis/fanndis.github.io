==Career==
In 1985, Chowdhury joined the ''Dainik Patrika'', the newspaper which started on 31 January 1986, as the chief reporter. In early 1989 he switched over to the Dainik ''Naba Avijan'' and returned to the Dainik Patrika at the end of the year. Since 1981 he has been serving journalism with writing in various press including [[Dainik Bangla]], Dainik Desh, [[Bichitra]], Robbar, Sunday Express, [[Weekly Holiday|Holiday]] and Khoborer Kagaj. In January 1991, he became special correspondent for the ''[[Ajker Kagoj]]''. In September 1991 Chowdhury became the diplomatic editor and special correspondent of the ''Dainik Dinkal''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecoi.net/file_upload/dh1647_01885bgd.htm |title=RSF - Rapport annuel 2001 |publisher=Ecoi.net |date=1 January 2001 |accessdate=20 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716061404/http://www.ecoi.net/file_upload/dh1647_01885bgd.htm |archive-date=16 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1993, he became the Bangladesh correspondent for the ''Island Upali'' newspapers of [[Sri Lanka]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Mukhlesur R Chowdhury |date=23 April 2003 |title=Solution within constitutional framework — CBK says in Dhaka |url=http://www.island.lk/2003/04/23/news05.html |work=[[The Island (Sri Lanka)|The Island]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Faruque, Shamim elected OCAB president, secy |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/12/30/d41230100778.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |agency=UNB |date=30 December 2004 |accessdate=20 August 2010}}</ref> Chowdhury also worked for the Japan Times.

In 2004, Chowdhury was appointed as [[press secretary]] and spokesman by President [[Iajuddin Ahmed]], serving from December 2004 to November 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bangabhaban's political recruit feeds BSS wrong news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/11/09/d61109011310.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=9 November 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bangladesh-web.com/view.php?hidRecord=133894], Bangladesh-Web</ref> When Iajuddin took on the responsibility as Chief Advisor in 2006, he appointed Chowdhury as one of his advisors.<ref>{{cite news |title=Political recruit Mokhlesur plays twin roles |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2006/11/07/d61107011411.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=7 November 2006}}</ref>

==Role during the 2006-2007 political crisis== 
On 13 November 2006, President Ahmed, [[Chief Advisor of Bangladesh|Chief Advisor]] of the [[Caretaker Government of Bangladesh|Caretaker Government]], appointed Chowdhury as the [[Senior advisor]] to President with the rank and status of a [[Minister of State]].<ref>[http://www.cabinet.gov.bd/view_news_event.php?page=announcement&type=archive&lang=en&next=241 "Cabinet appointments"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530123246/http://www.cabinet.gov.bd/view_news_event.php?page=announcement&type=archive&lang=en&next=241 |date=30 May 2012 }}, Bangladesh Government</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Mokhlesur now an adviser with state minister's rank |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/11/14/d61114011813.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=14 November 2006 |access-date=29 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5369473_ITM | work=United News of Bangladesh (UNB) | title=Secretary-Appointment | date=5 December 2004}}</ref> From November 2006 to January 2007, when an acute national political impasses arose in Bangladesh<ref>{{cite news |title=Talks at Bangabhaban fail |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/oct/30/nat.html |newspaper=New Age |location=Dhaka |date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=20 August 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070730212853/http://www.newagebd.com/2006/oct/30/nat.html |archive-date=30 July 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> out of uncertainty about Parliamentary elections, he performed the role of President's [[special envoy]] in the negotiation process.<ref name="wikileaks.org">{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/cable/2007/01/07DHAKA17.html|title=Cable Viewer|work=wikileaks.org}}</ref> He tried to reconcile issues between the two opposition leaders, Begum [[Khaleda Zia]] of the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]], and [[Sheikh Hasina]] of the [[Awami League]].<ref name=DailyStar5892/><ref>{{cite news |title=Options not explored before president's offer |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2007/2006/10/29/d61029011110.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=29 October 2006}}</ref> 
	
On 23 December 2006, the political parties agreed to participate in parliamentary elections in January. On the day all political parties joined the 22 January 2007 parliamentary election. Following that negotiation, they requested to extend last day of nomination for two days, as Presidential Adviser accepted this for smooth organizing the national election, while the AL and its Grand Alliance started submitting more new nomination papers for their candidates on 26 December 2006 as they changed some candidature in some areas in changed scenario. But on 3 January 2007, the last possible date, the Awami League and its [[Grand Alliance (Bangladesh)|Grand Alliance]] withdrew from elections when the [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]]'s [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]]'s nomination was cancelled.<ref>{{cite news |title=Grand alliance boycotts Jan 22 election |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2007/01/04/d7010401011.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=4 January 2007}}</ref><ref>https://www.ndi.org/files/2105_bd_watch2_123106.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Neil DeVotta |year=2015 |title=An Introduction to South Asian Politics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f6XbCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA64 |publisher=Routledge |pages=64– |isbn=978-1-317-36973-8}}</ref>
 	
A coterie using a judge gave a sentence to [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] (JP) Chairman [[H M Ershad]]. Agitating political parties stood by this move saying this was unacceptable at this election period. They chanted slogan: 'No Ershad, No Election' terming the court order motivated. Erstwhile State Minister for Home Lutfuzzaman Babar played role in cancelling Ershad's 5 nomination papers. For this, he called Returning Officers of 5 constituencies, Additional Divisional Commissioner of Dhaka and 3  Deputy Commissioners (DC) of the country, where the JP Chairman stood for election. Babar was lenient to [[Tarique Rahman]] thus [[Khaleda Zia]]. Meanwhile, he changed his allegiance to then Army Chief and engaged himself in dubious role, which was unknown to his former bosses. Presidential Adviser Mukhles Chowdhury tried to make Khaleda Zia understand that what he succeeded in bringing the AL and Grand Alliance to ensuing parliamentary election after a long parley and meeting many demands, now with this short cut process outside power will jeopardized the election. She did not realize the gravity of situation as her son was adamant on this. Ironically, then BNP had given charge to Babar for political contact with Ershad.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chronology of keeping off polls |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2007/01/05/d70105011814.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=5 January 2007}}</ref>
 	
At one stage, Babar and Tarique met Ershad. Finally, they both brought Ershad to Khaleda Zia at her cantonment residence while JP joined 4 Party Alliance for second time. Prior to 2001 parliamentary election, the JP first joined the 4 Party. Ershad deserted BNP before 2007 planned election saying Tarique became obstacle to give JP's demanded seats to contest forthcoming election being part of the alliance. The Army with DGFI worked availing advantage on prevailing situation<ref>http://www.achrweb.org/reports/DPKO-Bangladesh.pdf</ref> in favor of Ershad, their former Chief. As Ershad claimed that upon receiving threats, he did hide in safe area in Gazipur. After three days he came out in a broad day light and joined 14 Party Alliance's public meeting in Dhaka. Col. [[Oli Ahmed]] floated new political party Liberal Democratic Party on 26 October 2006, where DGFI's role was evident. Then [[B Chowdhury]]'s Bikalpa Dhara was amalgamated in LDP. But later both Chowdhury and Ahmed's parties saw divisions again. Then they all joined the AL led 14 Party alliance and named it Grand Alliance. In the meantime, the Army Chief Moeen U Ahmed with his vanguards MSP Aminul Karim, Brigadier General A T M Amin and Brigadier General Fazlul Bari had been working seriously to capture the power. On the other hand, Adviser Mukhles Chowdhury then tried utmost against that army group to save democracy, but the top politicians did not understand the situation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Politicians' failure led to Jan 11 changeover: speakers |url=http://newagebd.net/49022/politicians-failure-led-to-jan-11-changeover-speakers/#sthash.k7RHy87p.dpbs |newspaper=New Age |location=Dhaka |date=14 September 2014}}</ref><ref name="newagebd.net">{{cite news |title='Jan 11 a full-scale military takeover' |url=http://newagebd.net/48841/jan-11-a-full-scale-military-takeover/#sthash.UVM91ZB1.dpbs |newspaper=New Age |date=13 September 2014}}</ref><ref>http://www.thedailydawn.com/article.php?bangladesh/658</ref>

===Worked with US and UN to stop Martial Law=== 	
Then Mukhles Chowdhury used good offices of the western diplomats led by the US Ambassador [[Patricia A. Butenis]] and stopped the Martial Law while the army group had to retreat to the option of the state of emergency, which was supported by all political parties for their own interests. Khaleda Zia with Moeen's support on 29 October 2006 made all the papers of the state of emergency. However, Mukhles Chowdhury stopped the declaration of the emergency at night when the President Dr. Iajuddin Ahmed took over as the CA. Chowdhury was arguing through declaration of emergency the Army Chief would take over power. The AL led alliance was supporting the emergency from the beginning. At this stage, President Iajuddin declared a [[state of emergency]] on 11 January and postponed the elections under the pressure of Moeen and his army group,<ref name="economist.com">{{cite magazine |title=Bangladesh: The coup that dare not speak its name |url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=E1_RVGDDDG |magazine=The Economist |date=18 January 2007 |accessdate=20 August 2010 |quote=Iajuddin Ahmed, Bangladesh's president, declared an army-backed state of emergency on January 11th and cancelled the election due on January 22nd.}}</ref> as they would not be valid without full participation of the parties A group of military officers intervened to ensure stability, in what became called "One-Eleven."

In November and December 2006, Chowdhury worked with the US Ambassador in Dhaka Patricia A. Butenis, Under Secretary of State of the US Nicholas Burns called him from [[State Department]], Washington D.C., he had talk with US [[Assistant Secretary of State]] [[Richard A. Boucher]] and at Chowdhury's invitation UN Secretary General [[Kofi A. Annan]] sent his emissaries to Bangladesh to stop [[martial law]]. Responding Chowdhury's all these initiatives Special Envoy Craig Jennes led  a two-member UN delegation to Bangladesh and finally Patricia A. Butenis and [[Anwar Choudhury]] met Principal Staff Officer General Jahangir Alam Chowdhury and Chief of Army Staff General Moeen U Ahmed, transmitted message not go ahead with their Martial Law option and informed if it happens Bangladeshi Peacekeepers will be back from the UN Peacekeeping Mission and there will be sanctions imposed on Bangladesh by the UN. Another message for army was to go back to barrack after restoring democracy holding parliamentary election within very short time, thus army rule's days were numbered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://southasiajournal.net/bangladesh-in-the-un-peacekeeping-a-personal-perspective/ |title=Bangladesh Army in the U.N. peacekeeping and intervention in politics 2007-2008; A Personal Perspective |author=M Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury|date=12 June 2017 |website=[[South Asia Journal]]}}</ref>
 
During 1994-1995, Bangladesh had a similar political deadlock, when the Awami League boycotted the 15 February 1996 election because no caretaker government had been established. In that event, negotiations had been led by the then-[[Commonwealth Secretary General]] [[Chief Emeka Anyaoku]]'s [[special envoy]] Sir [[Ninian Stephen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4687779.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125081527/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4687779.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 January 2013 |title=Envoy fails - The Independent (London, England) &#124; HighBeam Research - FREE trial |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=21 November 1994 |accessdate=20 August 2010}}</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338682649_FOREIGN_INTERFERENCE_IN_BANGLADESH_A_CASE_STUDY_OF_MILITARY-BACKED_CARETAKER_GOVERNMENT_IN_2007-2008</ref>
 
===Diplomatic-cable leak by WikiLeaks=== 	
The violence and crisis in Bangladesh received international media coverage. In December 2006, [[WikiLeaks]] leaked documents from  Chowdhury's mission with diplomats, including [[Patricia A. Butenis]], as well as [[politicians]] and other stakeholders on solving Bangladesh's political impasses, when they had worked together during the volatile political situation in 2006-07 period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/cable/2006/12/06DHAKA6808.html|title=Cable Viewer|work=wikileaks.org}}</ref><ref>://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07DHAKA13_a.html</ref> The caretaker government struggled to hold elections within the constitutional 90-day deadline.
