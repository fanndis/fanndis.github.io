== History ==
[[File:Madonna della Strada Chapel.JPG|thumb|left|Madonna della Strada Chapel]]

Loyola was established as St. Ignatius College on June 30, 1870, by Jesuit priest and educator Fr. [[Arnold Damen]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Research Guides: Archives and Special Collections: History of Loyola University Chicago|url = http://libguides.luc.edu/c.php?g=49669&p=320256|website = libguides.luc.edu|access-date = February 3, 2016|language = en|first = Kathy|last = Young}}</ref> At that time Chicago was a much smaller, but rapidly growing, city just shy of 300,000 people, and as a result the original campus was much closer to the city center along Roosevelt Road. In 1909 the school was renamed Loyola University, and in 1912 it began to move to the current Lake Shore Campus; today the original building is part of [[St. Ignatius College Prep]], adjacent to the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].

To meet the growing needs of Chicago, Loyola established professional schools in law (1908), medicine (1909), business (1922), and nursing (1935). The Chicago College of Dental Surgery became part of the university in 1923, and was closed 70 years later. A downtown campus was founded in 1914, and with it the School of Sociology. As the predecessor to the School of Social Work, it enrolled Loyola's first female students, though the school would not become fully coeducational until 1966. [[Loyola Academy]], a college prep high school, occupied Dumbach Hall on the Lake Shore Campus until it was relocated to north suburban [[Wilmette, Illinois|Wilmette]] in 1957.

The current Water Tower Campus opened in 1949. In 1962, Loyola opened a campus in Rome near the site of the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]. In 1969, Loyola established the School of Education and consolidated medical programs at the Loyola University Medical Center, a hospital and health care complex located in [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]], an immediate suburb of Chicago. The university legally separated from the Jesuits in 1970, and today is under lay control and governed by a board of trustees. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2019}} Loyola purchased neighboring [[Mundelein College]] in 1991.

Felice]]. In 2009, the Cuneo Foundation presented the university with the [[Cuneo Museum|Cuneo Mansion and Gardens]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = About Us: Loyola University Chicago|url = http://www.luc.edu/cuneo/about/|website = Loyola University Chicago – Cuneo Mansion & Gardens|access-date = February 4, 2016}}</ref> a 100-acre estate with an Italianate mansion and extensive collections of art and furnishings located in suburban [[Vernon Hills, Illinois|Vernon Hills]]. The $50 million gift is the largest in Loyola history.

In 2010, Loyola purchased the Resurrection Retreat Center in [[Woodstock, Illinois|Woodstock]], which became the school's fifth campus for retreat and ecological study. In 2012, Loyola alumnus [[Michael R. Quinlan]] donated $40 million to the business school, which was renamed in his honor. During this time over 200,000 square-feet of LEED-certified sustainable spaces have been built on the Lake Shore Campus alone, along with significant mixed-use developments on the Water Tower Campus.

Today, Loyola ranks among the top 104 universities in the nation,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Loyola University Chicago {{!}} Loyola Chicago {{!}} Best College {{!}} US News|url = http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/loyola-chicago-1710|website = colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com|access-date = February 3, 2016}}</ref> and is in the midst of over $800 million in capital construction projects.<ref name=":1" /> In 2015, the university established Arrupe College, a uniquely structured two-year college designed to give low-income students access to a Loyola education.<ref>{{Cite web|title = A debt-free college for students who struggle most|url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/01/health/chicago-community-college-arrupe/|website = CNN|access-date = October 11, 2016}}</ref>

On May 23, 2016, Loyola named [[Jo Ann Rooney]] its 24th president. She is the first female president in the history of the university.

==== Sustainability ====
Loyola is committed to creating environmentally sustainable campuses, and various efforts have reduced university energy use by 33% since 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|title = What Loyola is Doing What Loyola is Doing: Loyola University Chicago|url = http://luc.edu/sustainability/campus/focus_areas/|website = Loyola University Chicago – Institute of Environmental Sustainability|access-date = February 4, 2016}}</ref> Loyola has three [[LEED certified|LEED]] Silver certified buildings and four LEED Gold certified buildings, with all future construction to be LEED certified as well. Loyola has more green roofs than any college in the Midwest, which includes both new and renovated buildings. These efforts have not gone unnoticed: in 2014, Loyola placed 4th nationally (and 1st in Illinois) in the [[Sierra Club]]'s ranking of America's Greenest Colleges.<ref>{{Cite web|title = America's Greenest Colleges: The Top 10|url = http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/slideshow/top-ten-coolest-schools-2014#9|website = Sierra Club|access-date = February 4, 2016}}</ref>

=== Water Tower Campus ===
The Water Tower Campus opened in 1949 along a stretch of [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] today known as the ''[[Magnificent Mile]]'', and is named after the [[Chicago Water Tower]], a city landmark that survived the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871.

Most of the residence halls and apartments managed by Loyola's Department of Residence Life are in the Rogers Park and Edgewater neighborhoods surrounding the Lake Shore Campus. One, Baumhart Hall, is at the Water Tower Campus on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago. Most of Loyola's residence halls are named after other Jesuit colleges and universities.

First-year students may live in one of the following residences on the Lake Shore campus: Campion Hall (for first year students of the Interdisciplinary Honors Program), de Nobili Hall, Mertz Hall, Regis Hall, San Francisco Hall, and the Simpson Living Learning Center (Simpson Hall). Simpson, Mertz, and de Nobili Halls are conveniently located above dining halls that serve these buildings and the halls surrounding them. Residence halls on the north side of campus are served by a dining hall and food court in the Damen Student Center. First- and second-year students are required to live in on-campus housing.

Upperclass students are permitted to choose from fifteen residences at the Lake Shore campus: Bellarmine, Canisius, Fairfield, Fordham, Georgetown, LeMoyne, Marquette, Marquette South, Messina, Regis, Saint Louis, Santa Clara, Seattle, Spring Hill and Xavier Halls. Santa Clara Hall is on Loyola Avenue right on [[Lake Michigan]]. Upperclassmen can also choose to live in Baumhart Hall, located at 26 E. Pearson, just a block from the [[Magnificent Mile]] in downtown Chicago. It is a 25-floor apartment-style residence for upperclassmen and graduate students at Loyola University. Students living in Baumhart and taking classes on the Water Tower Campus have access to two dining facilities: Nina's Cafe (in the Corboy Law Center) and LU's Old-Fashioned Deli and Pub (in the Terry Student Center).

=== College radio station ===
Loyola University owned and operated a low-power, carrier current radio station, WLUC-AM, in the 1960s. Students broadcast an eclectic music format on 600&nbsp;kHz to Lake Shore Campus buildings and the surrounding Rogers Park neighborhood. The station had a well-equipped studio in a University-owned Student Life house on Loyola Avenue. The structure was demolished to make way for the Crown Center for the Humanities.

WLUC-AM was replaced by an on-air FM station, [[WLUW]], in the 1970s.<ref>[http://www.lib.luc.edu/specialcollections/exhibits/show/luctime/lutime19701999/lutime1970 1970 TO 1979]. ''www.lib.luc.edu''. Retrieved September 16, 2015.</ref>

NCAA Division I National Championships (3):
1963 Men's Basketball, 2014 Men's Volleyball, 2015 Men's Volleyball

Loyola is home to 11 varsity teams, most of which compete in NCAA Division I. The teams include men and women's basketball, cross country, men and women's golf, men and women's soccer, softball, track, and men and women's volleyball. The nickname "Ramblers" was first applied to Loyola's football team in 1926 because they frequently traveled throughout the United States.<ref>{{Cite book| last =Ramin| first =Nathan| title =College Prowler: Loyola University Chicago Off the Record| publisher =[[College Prowler]]| year =2005| page =6| isbn =978-1-59658-077-0 }}</ref>

LU Wolf is the mascot for the University. He was inspired by the [[coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] of [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius of Loyola]], from whom Loyola derives its name, which depicts two wolves standing over a kettle. Taken from the heraldic crest carved in the lintel on St. Ignatius' family home in [[Azpeitia]], [[Spain]], the wolves and cauldron refer to the prosperity and generosity of the Loyola family, who, after feeding family, retainers and soldiers, had enough food to feed even the wild animals.

Loyola's men's basketball team, the Ramblers, won the 1963 national championship. Loyola is the only [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I NCAA]] school in Illinois to have won a national title in men's basketball.<ref>{{cite news | first=Dan | last=McGrath | title=Forget Illinois Shutout; Relive Tourney's Past | date=March 18, 2010 | newspaper=NY Times | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/us/19cncsports.html | accessdate = April 2, 2010 }}</ref> In 2018 they finished the NCAA tournament with the all-time highest win percentage of any team to have ever competed in the tournament.
