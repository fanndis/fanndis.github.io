== Early life and air force career ==
Rajeshwar Pilot, then still Rajeshwar Prasad, was commissioned in the General Duties (Pilot) branch of the Indian Air Force as a [[pilot officer]] on 29 October 1966.<ref>{{cite news |title=Part I-Section 4: Ministry of Defence (Air Branch) |page=343 |date=29 April 1967 |website= |publisher=The Gazette of India}}</ref> He was promoted to [[flying officer]] on 29 October 1967 and to [[flight lieutenant]] on 29 October 1971.<ref>{{cite news |title=Part I-Section 4: Ministry of Defence (Air Branch) |page=373 |date=4 May 1968 |website= |publisher=The Gazette of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Part I-Section 4: Ministry of Defence (Air Branch) |page=697 |date=13 May 1972 |website= |publisher=The Gazette of India}}</ref> He fought in the [[Indo-Pakistan War of 1971]] as a bomber pilot,<ref name="mourns">{{cite news|url=http://news.rediff.com/news/2000/jun/12josy.htm|title=Rajesh Pilot: Baidpura mourns the death of a legend|author=Josy Joseph|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|date=12 June 2000|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> flying a modified [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou]].<ref name="F16">{{cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/19880831-rajesh-pilot-flies-f-16-during-official-visit-to-holland-797619-1988-08-31|title=Rajesh Pilot flies F-16 during official visit to Holland|author=|publisher=India Today|date=31 August 1988|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> He was promoted to [[squadron leader]] on 29 October 1977.<ref>{{cite news |title=Part I-Section 4: Ministry of Defence (Air Branch) |page=703 |date=15 July 1978 |website= |publisher=The Gazette of India}}</ref> On 8 August 1978, he was seconded to the Ministry of Agriculture.<ref>{{cite news |title=Part I-Section 4: Ministry of Defence (Air Branch) |page=1014 |date=17 November 1979 |website= |publisher=The Gazette of India}}</ref>

In late 1979, Prasad resigned his commission while posted in [[Jaisalmer]] to join politics, under the influence of his friend [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who later became the [[Prime Minister of India]]. He contested the 1980 Lok Sabha elections as an INC candidate from Bharatpur, changing his surname to Pilot at the same time.<ref name="mourns"/>

==In politics==
Pilot emerged as a prominent [[Gurjar]] leader in India.<ref>{{cite web

On an official visit to the Netherlands in 1988, his Dutch counterpart, learning Pilot was a former IAF officer, arranged for him to fly a [[RNLAF]] F-16; the IAF subsequently invited Pilot to test a new Mig-29 following his return to India.<ref name="F16"/>

He sent [[Chandraswami]] to prison when he was the Internal Security Minister. Later, he lost the election for the post of Congress president to [[Sitaram Kesri]], but remained in the first line of Congress leaders.
