==Classification==
Taiwanese Hokkien is a branched-off variety of [[Hokkien]], a group of [[Southern Min]] dialects. Like many [[Min Chinese|Min]] varieties, it has distinct [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters|literary and colloquial layers]] of vocabulary, often associated with formal and informal [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s respectively. The literary layer can be traced to the late [[Tang dynasty]], and can thus be related to [[Middle Chinese]]. In contrast, the colloquial layers of Min varieties are believed to have branched from the mainstream of Chinese around the time of the [[Han dynasty]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mei|first=Tsu-lin|year=1970|title=Tones and Prosody in Middle Chinese and The Origin of The Rising Tone|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=30|pages=86–110|doi=10.2307/2718766|jstor=2718766}}</ref><ref>{{cite book

Regional variations within Taiwanese may be traced back to Hokkien variants spoken in Southern Fujian, specifically those from [[Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou]], then later [[Amoy]]. Taiwanese Hokkien also contains loanwords from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and the native [[Formosan languages]]. Recent work by scholars such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20041022000504/http://ws.twl.ncku.edu.tw/hak-chia/l/lou-ek-ki/kongpah-oat.htm Ekki Lu], [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081002014759/http://203.64.42.21/iug/ungian/poj/siausit/2002/2002pojgth/lunbun/a1-sakai.pdf Toru Sakai] (酒井亨 ''Sakai Tōru''), and [https://web.archive.org/web/20040915015640/http://ws.twl.ncku.edu.tw/hak-chia/l/li-khin-hoann/phok-su/phok-su.htm Lí Khîn-hoāⁿ] (also known as Tavokan Khîn-hoāⁿ or Chin-An Li), based on former research by scholars such as [[Ong Iok-tek|Ông Io̍k-tek]], has gone so far as to associate part of the basic vocabulary of the colloquial Taiwanese with the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] and [[Tai languages|Tai]] language families; however, such claims are controversial.

The literary form of Hokkien once flourished in [[Fujian]] and was brought to Taiwan by early emigrants. ''[[Tân Saⁿ and Gō͘-niû|Tale of the Lychee Mirror]]'', a manuscript for a series of plays published during the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1566, is one of the earliest known works. This form of the language is now largely extinct. However, literary readings of the numbers are used in certain contexts such as reciting telephone numbers (see [[Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== History and formation ==
{{see also|Hokkien#History}}

===Spread of Hokkien to Taiwan===
During [[Yuan dynasty]], [[Quanzhou]], [[Fujian|Fujian province]] became a major international port for trade with the outside world.<ref>[http://culture.edu.tw/history/smenu_photomenu.php?smenuid=641&subjectid=1264 教育部，歷史文化學習網，《重要貿易港口－泉州》] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725194653/http://culture.edu.tw/history/smenu_photomenu.php?smenuid=641&subjectid=1264 |date=25 July 2011 }}</ref> From that period onwards, due to political and economic reasons, many people from [[Hokkien]]-speaking regions (southern Fujian) started to emigrate overseas. This included the relatively undeveloped island of [[Formosa]], starting around 1600. They brought with them their native language, Hokkien.

During the late [[Ming dynasty]], due to political chaos, there was increased migration from southern Fujian and eastern [[Guangdong]] to Taiwan. The earliest immigrants who were involved in the development of Taiwan included [[Chinese pirates|pirate-merchants]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Chinese Peter|zh|3=顏思齊|WD=}} and [[Zheng Zhilong]]. In 1621, Chinese Peter and his forces, hailing from [[Zhangzhou]], occupied ''Ponkan'' (modern-day [[Beigang, Yunlin]]) and started to develop ''Tirosen'' (modern-day [[Chiayi City|Chiayi]]). After the death of Peter and another pirate, [[Li Dan (pirate)|Li Dan]] of Quanzhou, Zheng sought to dominate the [[Taiwan Strait|Strait of Taiwan]]. By 1628, he had grown so powerful that the Ming court bestowed him the official title, "Patrolling Admiral".<ref>{{cite book |last=Andrade |first=Tonio |title=How Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish, and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century |publisher=Columbia University Press |chapter=Chapter 2: A Scramble for Influence |chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/andrade/andrade02.html |year=2005 |at=§20-1}}</ref>

In 1624, the number of Chinese in the island was about 25,000.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=13}} During the reign of [[Chongzhen Emperor]] (1627–1644), there were frequent droughts in the Fujian region. Zheng and a Chinese official suggested to send victims to Taiwan and provide "for each person three [[tael]]s of silver and for each three people one ox".{{sfnp|Andrade|2005|loc=§26}} Although this plan was never carried out, the Zheng family maintained an interest in Taiwan that would have dire consequences for the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], who ruled Taiwan as [[Dutch Formosa]] at the time.

===Development and divergence===
In 1624 and 1626, the Dutch and Spanish forces occupied the [[Tainan]] and [[Keelung]] areas, respectively. During the 40 years of [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colonial rule of Taiwan]], many [[Han Chinese]] from the [[Quanzhou]], [[Zhangzhou]] and [[Hakka culture|Hakka]] regions of mainland China were recruited to help develop Taiwan. Because of intermingling with [[Siraya people]] as well as Dutch colonial rule, the Hokkien dialects started to deviate from the original Hokkien spoken in mainland China.

In the 1661 [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]], Chinese general [[Koxinga]] expelled the Dutch and established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]]. Koxinga originated from the Quanzhou region. {{Interlanguage link multi|Chen Yonghua|zh|3=陳永華 (明鄭)}}, who was in charge of establishing the education system of Tungning, also originated from Quanzhou. Because most of the soldiers he brought to Taiwan came from Quanzhou, the [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige variant]] of Hokkien on the island at the time was the [[Quanzhou dialect]].

In 1683, Chinese admiral [[Shi Lang]] attacked Taiwan in the [[Battle of Penghu]], ending the Tungning era and beginning [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing dynasty rule]] (until 1895). In the following years, in order to prevent people from rebelling, the Qing court instituted a ban on migration to Taiwan,{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} especially the migration of [[Hakka people]] from [[Guangdong]] province, which led Hokkien to become a prestige language in Taiwan.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In the first decades of the 18th century, the linguistic differences between the Qing imperial bureaucrats and the commoners was recorded by the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking first Imperial [[High commissioner|High Commissioner]] to Taiwan (1722), [[Huang Shujing]]:
{{cquote|In this place, the language is as [[birdcall]] &ndash; totally unintelligible! For example: for the surname [[Liu|Liú]], they say 'Lâu'; for [[Chen (surname)|Chén]], 'Tân'; [[Zhuang (surname)|Zhuāng]], 'Chng'; and [[Zhang (surname)|Zhāng]] is 'Tioⁿ'. My deputy’s surname [[Wu (surname)|Wú]] becomes 'Ngô͘'. My surname [[Huang (surname)|Huáng]] does not even have a proper vowel: it is 'N̂g' here! It is difficult to make sense of this.<br />
({{lang|zh-Hant|郡中鴃舌鳥語，全不可曉。如：劉呼「澇」、陳呼「澹」、莊呼「曾」、張呼「丟」。余與吳待御兩姓，吳呼作「襖」，黃則無音，厄影切，更為難省。}})|||''Records from the mission to Taiwan and its Strait'', Volume II: "On the area around [[Fort Provintia]], [[Tainan]]" (臺海使槎錄 卷二 赤嵌筆談)}}
The tone of Huang's message [[Foretelling|foretold]] the uneasy relationships between different [[Speech community|language communities]] and colonial establishments over the next few centuries.

The ban on migration to Taiwan was relaxed sometime after 1722 (and was completely removed in 1874). During the 200 years of Qing dynasty rule, thousands of immigrants from [[Fujian]] arrived yearly; the population was over one million in the middle of the 18th century.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=561}} Civil unrest and armed conflicts were frequent. In addition to resistance against governments (both Chinese and later Japanese), [[Ethnic conflict|battles between ethnic groups]] were also significant: the belligerents usually grouped around the language they used. History has recorded battles between [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] speakers and Hokkien speakers; between these and the [[Taiwanese aborigine|aborigines]]; and even between those who spoke different variants of Hokkien.

In the early 20th century, the [[Hoklo people]] in Taiwan could be categorized as originating from [[Xiamen]], [[Quanzhou]], [[Zhangzhou]], and [[Zhangpu County|Zhangpu]].{{clarification needed|reason=Zhangpu is part of Zhangzhou|date=August 2020}}{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=591}} People from the former two areas (Quanzhou-speaking) were dominant in the north of the island and along the west coast,<ref>"especially in the cities of Koro (Aulang), Taiko (Taika), Giubato (Gumatau), Gosei (Goche), Tokatsukutsu (Thawkakut), and Rokko (Lokiang)." (modern-day [[Houlong, Miaoli|Houlong]], [[Dajia District|Dajia]], [[Qingshui District|Qingshui]], [[Wuqi District|Wuqi]], [[Longjing District|Longjing]], and Lukang, respectively.) {{harvp|Davidson|1903|p=591}}</ref> whereas people from the latter two areas ([[Zhangzhou dialect|Zhangzhou]]-speaking) were dominant in the south and perhaps the central plains as well.

Although there were conflicts between Quanzhou- and Zhangzhou-speakers in Taiwan historically, their gradual [[intermingling]] led to mixing of the two [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]]. Apart from [[Lukang, Changhua|Lukang city]] and [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]], which have preserved their original Quanzhou and Zhangzhou accents, respectively, almost every region of Taiwan now speaks a mixture of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou Hokkien.{{sfnp|Ang|1987}} A similar phenomenon occurred in [[Xiamen]] (Amoy) after 1842 when the mixture of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou Hokkien displaced the Quanzhou dialect to yield the modern [[Amoy dialect]].<ref>泉州旅游信息网，[http://fjqz.fj.vnet.cn/travel/talk/right.htm 泉州方言文化] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301121345/http://fjqz.fj.vnet.cn/travel/talk/right.htm |date=1 March 2007 }}</ref>

During the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule of Taiwan]], Taiwan began to hold Amoy Hokkien as its standard pronunciation; the Japanese called this mixture {{nihongo|'''Taiwanese'''|臺灣語|Taiwango}}.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Iûⁿ |first1=Ún-giân |last2=Tiuⁿ |first2=Ha̍k-khiam |last3=Lu |first3=Bichhin |script-title=zh:台語文運動訪談暨史料彙編 |language=zh |date=2008-03-01 |publisher=國史館 |location=Taipei |isbn=9789860132946 |oclc=813921186}}</ref>

After 1945,{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Amoy Hokkien and Taiwanese Hokkien began to [[Linguistic divergence|diverge]] slightly.

===Modern times===
[[File:Proportion of Taiwanese Language Used in House.svg|thumb|350px|Proportion of languages used at home by residents aged 6 or over in Taiwan in 2010, sorted by birth year.<ref name="housing census">Sources: http://www.dgbas.gov.tw/public/data/dgbas04/bc6/census022%28final%29.html 2010 population and housing census by DGBAS, [[Executive Yuan]].</ref> The chart shows the tendency that speech communities of [[Languages of Taiwan#Other languages|Taiwanese local languages]] are shifting to speak [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]].]]
Later, in the 20th century, the conceptualization of Taiwanese is more controversial than most variations of Chinese because at one time it marked a clear division between the Mainlanders who [[KMT retreat to Taiwan in 1949|arrived in 1949]] and the pre-existing majority native Taiwanese. Although the political and linguistic divisions between the two groups have blurred considerably, the political issues surrounding Taiwanese have been more controversial and sensitive than for other [[varieties of Chinese]].

After the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], due to military defeat to the Japanese, the [[Qing dynasty]] ceded [[Taiwan]] to Japan, causing contact with the [[Hokkien]]-speaking regions of mainland China to stop. During Japanese rule, Japanese became an official language in Taiwan, and Taiwanese Hokkien began to absorb large number of Japanese loanwords into its language. Examples of such loanwords (some which had in turn been borrowed from English) include ''piān-só͘'' from {{nihongo4||{{linktext|便所}}|benjo|"toilet"}}, ''phêng'' from {{nihongo4||{{linktext|坪}}|[[tsubo]]|"[[pyeong]]", an areal measurement}} (see also [[Taiwanese units of measurement]]), ''ga-suh'' from {{nihongo4||{{linktext|ガス}}|gasu|"gas"}}, ''o͘-tó͘-bái'' from {{nihongo4||{{linktext|オートバイ}}|ōtobai|"autobicycle", motorcycle}}. All of these caused Taiwanese to deviate from Hokkien used elsewhere.

During [[Japanization#Taiwan|Kōminka]] of the late Japanese colonial period, the [[Japanese language]] appeared in every corner of Taiwan. The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] beginning in 1937 brought stricter measures into force, and along with the outlawing of [[Chinese language romanization in Taiwan|romanized Taiwanese]], various publications were prohibited and Confucian-style private schools which taught [[Classical Chinese]] with [[Literary language|literary]] Southern Min pronunciation – were closed down in 1939.{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=135}} Taiwanese Hokkien thus was reduced to a common [[Vernacular|daily language]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ang |first1=Ui-jin |script-title=zh:臺灣方言之旅 |date=1991 |publisher=前衛出版社 |location=Taipei |isbn=9789579512312}}</ref>

After the handover of Taiwan to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1945, there was brief cultural exchange with mainland China followed by further oppression. The [[Chinese Civil War]] resulted in another political separation when the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party) government [[Chinese Nationalist Party retreat to Taiwan|retreated to Taiwan following their defeat by the communists]] in 1949. The influx of two million soldiers and civilians caused the population of Taiwan to increase from 6 million to 8 million. The government subsequently promoted [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] and banned the public use of Taiwanese as part of a deliberate political repression, especially in schools and broadcast media. In 1964 use of Taiwanese in schools or official settings was forbidden,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lin |first=Alvin |issue=89 |title=Writing Taiwanese: The Development of Modern Written Taiwanese |journal=Sino-Platonic Papers |url=http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp089_taiwanese.pdf |year=1999 |OCLC=41879041 }}</ref> and transgression in schools punished with beatings, fines and humiliation.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Linguistic capital in Taiwan: The KMT's Mandarin language policy and its perceived impact on language practices of bilingual Mandarin and Tai-gi speakers |last=Sandel |first=Todd L. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |journal=Language in Society |volume=32 |issue=4 |doi=10.1017/S0047404503324030 |jstor=4169285 }}</ref>

Only after the lifting of [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] in 1987 and the [[mother tongue]] movement in the 1990s did Taiwan see a true [[Language revitalization|revival]] in the Taiwanese language. Today, there are a large number of Taiwanese scholars dedicated to researching the language. Despite this, according to census data the number of people speaking Taiwanese continued to drop.<ref name="housing census"/>

The history of Taiwanese and its interaction with Mandarin is complex and at times controversial, even regarding its name. The language has no official name in Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web |title=中華民國文化部-國家語言發展法 |url=https://www.moc.gov.tw/content_275.html |website=www.moc.gov.tw |access-date=24 October 2019 |language=zh |date=10 October 2008 |quote=《國家語言發展法》並未以法律明列各固有族群之語言名稱，即是尊重各族群使用者慣常使用之命名權。}}</ref> Some dislike the name "Taiwanese" as they feel that it belittles other languages spoken on the island such as Mandarin, [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and the [[Formosan languages|aboriginal languages]].

Unlike many other varieties of Chinese such as Mandarin and [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], there are no native [[labiodental]] phonemes (i.e., {{IPAblink|f}}).

# Coronal affricates and fricatives become [[Alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] before {{IPA|/i/}}, that is, {{IPA|/dzi/}}, {{IPA|/tsi/}}, {{IPA|/tsʰi/}}, and {{IPA|/si/}} are pronounced {{IPA|[dʑi]}}, {{IPA|[tɕi]}}, {{IPA|[tɕʰi]}}, and {{IPA|[ɕi]}}.
# The consonant {{IPA|/dz/}} may be realized as a fricative; that is, as {{IPA|[z]}} in most environments and {{IPA|[ʑ]}} before {{IPA|/i/}}.
# The [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] plosives ({{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}) become the corresponding fricatives ({{IPAblink|β}} and {{IPAblink|ɣ}}) in some phonetic contexts. This is similar to [[begadkefat]] in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and a similar [[Allophone|allophony]] of intervocalic [[plosive consonants]] and their fricatives in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

=== Vowels ===
Taiwanese has the following [[vowel]]s:

|-align=center
![[Open vowel|Open]]
| || ||'''{{IPAblink|ä|a}}'''<br>a ㄚ||'''{{IPA|[ã]}}'''<br>aⁿ ㆩ|| ||
|}

The vowel {{angle bracket|o}} is akin to a [[schwa]]; in contrast, {{angle bracket|[[o͘]]}} (with dot) is a more [[Vowel#Height|open vowel]]. In addition, there are several [[diphthong]]s and [[triphthong]]s (for example, {{angle bracket|iau}}). The consonants {{angle bracket|m}} and {{angle bracket|ng}} can function as a [[Nucleus (syllable)|syllabic nucleus]] and are therefore included here as vowels. The vowels may be either plain or [[Nasal vowel|nasal]]: {{angle bracket|a}} is non-nasal, and {{angle bracket|aⁿ}} is the same vowel with concurrent nasal articulation. This is similar to [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and many other languages.

There are two pronunciations of vowel {{angle bracket|o}}. In the south (e.g., [[Tainan]] and [[Kaohsiung]]) it is {{IPA|[ə]}}; in the north (e.g., [[Taipei]]) it is {{IPA|[o]}}. Due to development of transportation and communication, both pronunciations are common and acceptable throughout the country.

=== Tones ===
[[Image:Taiwanese tones.png|thumb|right|Taiwanese tones, close to Taipei values.]]
In the traditional analysis, there are eight "tones", [[tone number|numbered]] from 1 to 8. Strictly speaking, there are only five [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal contours]]. But as in other Chinese varieties, the two kinds of stopped syllables are considered also to be tones and assigned numbers 4 and 8. In Taiwanese tone 6 has merged into tone 7, and thus duplicated in the count. Here the eight tones are shown, following the traditional tone class categorization, named after the tones of [[Middle Chinese]]:

{{Listen|filename=Taiwanese-8Tones.ogg|title=Eight tones of Taiwanese|description=Demonstration of the tones of Taiwanese: 衫 ''saⁿ, 短 té, 褲, khò͘, 闊 khoah, 人 lâng, 矮 é, 鼻 phīⁿ, 直 ti̍t''. Tone sandhi rules do not apply in this sentence. (This demonstration is popular but misleading in the use of ''矮 é'' as an example for tone 6. In dialects that distinguish tones 6 and 7, ''矮 é'' belongs to tone 2, and most words of tone 6 merges into tone 7 in Taiwanese.)}}

See (for one example) the modern phonological analysis in {{harvp|Chiung|2003}}, which challenges these notions.

For tones 4 and 8, a final consonant {{angle bracket|p}}, {{angle bracket|t}}, or {{angle bracket|k}} may appear. When this happens, it is impossible for the syllable to be nasal. Indeed, these are the counterpart to the nasal final consonants {{angle bracket|m}}, {{angle bracket|n}}, and {{angle bracket|ng}}, respectively, in other tones. However, it is possible to have a nasal 4th or 8th tone syllable such as {{angle bracket|siaⁿh}}, as long as there is no final consonant other than {{angle bracket|h}}.

In the dialect spoken near the northern coast of Taiwan, there is no distinction between tones number 8 and number 4 &ndash; both are pronounced as if they follow the [[tone sandhi]] rules of tone number 4.

Tone number 0, typically written with two consecutive hyphens {{angle bracket|--}} before the syllable with this tone, is used to mark [[enclitic]]s denoting the extent of a verb action, the end of a noun phrase, etc. A frequent use of this tone is to denote a question, such as in "Chia̍h-pá--bē?", literally meaning 'Have you eaten yet?’. This is realized by speaking the syllable with either a low-falling tone (3) or a low stop (4). The syllable prior to the {{angle bracket|--}} maintains its original tone.

=== Syllabic structure ===
A [[syllable]] requires a vowel (or diphthong or [[triphthong]]) to appear in the middle. All consonants can appear at the initial position. The consonants {{angle bracket|p, t, k}} and {{angle bracket|m, n, ng}} (and some consider {{angle bracket|h}}) may appear at the end of a syllable. Therefore, it is possible to have syllables such as {{angle bracket|ngiau}} ("(to) tickle") and {{angle bracket|thng}} ("soup").

=== Tone sandhi ===
[[File:Taiwanese Hokkien Tone Sandhi 01.svg|thumbnail|right|Schema of the tone sandhi rules in Taiwanese.]]
Taiwanese Hokkien has extremely extensive [[tone sandhi]] (tone-changing) rules: in an utterance, only the last syllable pronounced is not affected by the rules.<ref>{{cite blog|url=http://uegu.blogspot.com/2015/01/blog-post_16.html|script-title=zh:台語好多聲|trans-title=The Many Tones of Taiwanese|author=麻瓜先生|date=January 2015|quote={{lang|zh-tw|台語裡有個變調系統，細說分明需要時間，但最大的規則就是「最後一個字不要變！其他變變變！」}}|access-date=21 March 2019}}</ref> What an ‘[[utterance]]’ (or ‘[[intonational phrase]]’) is, in the context of this language, is an ongoing topic for linguistic research, but some general rules apply:<ref name="Lin2015">{{cite book|author=Philip T. Lin|title=Taiwanese Grammar: A Concise Reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QlExBwAAQBAJ|date=31 January 2015|publisher=Greenhorn Media|isbn=978-0-9963982-1-3}}</ref>

The following syllables are unaffected by tone sandhi:
* The final syllable in a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], [[noun]] (including single syllable nouns, but not [[pronoun]]s), number, time phrase (i.e., today, tomorrow, etc.), spatial [[preposition]] (i.e., on, under), or [[question word]] (i.e., who, what, how).
* The syllable immediately preceding the [[possessive particle]] 的 (ê) or a neutralized tone. In POJ, this is the syllable before a double hyphen, e.g., 王先生 (Ông—sian-siⁿ)
* Some common [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] markers: 了 (liáu), 好 (hó), 完 (oân), 煞 (soah)

==== Normal tone sandhi ====
The following rules, listed in the traditional pedagogical mnemonic order, govern the pronunciation of tone on each of the syllables affected (that is, all but those described according to the rules listed above):
* If the original tone number is '''5''', pronounce it as tone number '''3''' ([[Quanzhou]]/Taipei speech) or '''7''' ([[Zhangzhou]]/Tainan speech).
* If the original tone number is '''7''', pronounce it as tone number '''3'''.
* If the original tone number is '''3''', pronounce it as tone number '''2'''.
* If the original tone number is '''2''', pronounce it as tone number '''1'''.
* If the original tone number is '''1''', pronounce it as tone number '''7'''.
* If the original tone number is '''8''' and the final consonant is not '''h''' (that is, it is '''p''', '''t''', or '''k'''), pronounce it as tone number '''4'''.
* If the original tone number is '''4''' and the final consonant is not '''h''' (that is, it is '''p''', '''t''', or '''k'''), pronounce it as tone number '''8'''.
* If the original tone number is '''8''' and the final consonant is '''h''', pronounce it as tone number '''3'''.
* If the original tone number is '''4''' and the final consonant is '''h''', pronounce it as tone number '''2'''.

==== Double tone sandhi ====
There are a number of a single syllable words that undergo double tone sandhi, that is, they follow the tone change rule twice and are pronounced according to the second tone change. These syllables are almost always a 4th tone ending in '''-h''', and include the words 欲 (beh), 佮 (kah), 閣 (koh), 才 (chiah), as well as the 3rd tone verb 去 khì. As a result of following the tone change rule twice, these syllables are all pronounced as tone number '''1'''.

==== Before the -á suffix ====
{{Wiktionary pipe|仔#Usage notes|the rules for tone sandhi before '仔' (-á) with examples}}
Apart from the normal tone sandhi rules described above, there are two special cases where a different set of tone sandhi apply.<ref>Iunn Un-gian. "A Study on Implementation of Southern-Min Taiwanese Tone Sandhi System." (2005). https://aclweb.org/anthology/Y/Y05/Y05-1011.pdf</ref> In a noun with the noun [[suffix]] '{{linktext|lang=zh|仔}}' ({{linktext|á}}), the penultimate syllable is governed by the following rules:
* If the original tone number is '''5''', pronounce it as tone number '''7'''.
* If the original tone number is '''7''', pronounce it as tone number '''7'''.
* If the original tone number is '''2''' or '''3''', pronounce it as tone number '''1'''.
* If the original tone number is '''1''', pronounce it as tone number '''7'''.(same as normal)
* If the original tone number is '''8''' and final consonant is not '''h''' (that is, it is '''p''', '''t''', or '''k'''), pronounce it as tone number '''4'''.(same as normal)
* If the original tone number is '''4''' and final consonant is not '''h''' (that is, it is '''p''', '''t''', or '''k'''), pronounce it as tone number '''8'''.(same as normal)

==== In triplicated adjectives ====
Finally, in the case of single-syllable adjective [[triplication]] (for added emphasis), the first syllable is governed by the following rules (the second syllable follows the normal tone sandhi rules above):
* If the original tone number is '''5''', pronounce it as tone number '''5'''.
* If the original tone number is '''7''', pronounce it as tone number '''1'''.
* If the original tone number is '''3''', pronounce it as tone number '''2''' (same as normal).
* If the original tone number is '''2''', pronounce it as tone number '''1''' (same as normal).
* If the original tone number is '''1''', pronounce it as tone number '''5'''.
* If the original tone number is '''8''' and the final consonant is not '''h''' (that is, it is '''p''', '''t''', or '''k'''), pronounce it as tone number '''4''' (same as normal).
* If the original tone number is '''4''' and the final consonant is not '''h''' (that is, it is '''p''', '''t''', or '''k'''), pronounce it as tone number '''8''' (same as normal).
* If the original tone number is '''8''' and the final consonant is '''h''', pronounce it as tone number '''5'''.

== Lexicon ==
Modern linguistic studies (by Robert L. Cheng and Chin-An Li, for example) estimate that most (75% to 90%) Taiwanese Hokkien [[word]]s have [[cognate]]s in other Chinese varieties. [[False friend]]s do exist; for example, ''cháu'' ({{Lang|zh-tw|走}}) means "to run" in Taiwanese Hokkien, whereas the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] cognate, ''zǒu'', means "to walk". Moreover, cognates may have different [[Part of speech|lexical categories]]; for example, the [[morpheme]] ''phīⁿ'' ({{Lang|zh-tw|鼻}}) means not only "nose" (a noun, as in Mandarin ''bí'') but also "to smell" (a verb, unlike Mandarin).

Among the apparently cognate-less words are many basic words with properties that contrast with similar-meaning words of pan-Chinese derivation. Often the former group lacks a standard Han character, and the words are variously considered colloquial, intimate, vulgar, uncultured, or more concrete in meaning than the pan-Chinese synonym. Some examples: ''lâng'' ({{Lang|zh-tw|人}} or {{Lang|zh-tw|儂}}, person, concrete) vs. ''jîn'' (人, person, abstract); ''{{linktext|cha-bó͘}}'' ({{linktext|查某}}, woman) vs. ''lú-jîn'' (女人, woman, literary). Unlike the [[English language#Vocabulary|English Germanic/Latin contrast]], however, the two groups of Taiwanese Hokkien words cannot be as strongly attributed to the influences of two disparate linguistic sources.

Extensive contact with the [[Japanese language]] has left a legacy of Japanese [[loanwords]], with 172 recorded in the Ministry of Education's ''[[Dictionary of Frequently-Used Taiwan Minnan]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://twblg.dict.edu.tw/holodict_new/index/fulu_wailaici.jsp |script-title=zh:臺灣閩南語常用詞辭典-外來詞 |year=2011 |trans-title=Dictionary of Frequently-Used Taiwan Minnan - Loanwords |publisher=Ministry of Education, R.O.C. |language=zh |access-date=8 July 2011}}</ref> Although a very small percentage of the vocabulary, their usage tends to be high-frequency because of their relevance to modern society and popular culture. Examples are: ''o͘-tó͘-bái'' from {{nihongo4||オートバイ|ōtobai|"autobike"/motorcycle}} and ''pháng'' from {{nihongo4||{{linktext|パン}}|pan|"[[bread]]", itself a loanword from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]}}. [[Grammatical particle]]s borrowed from Japanese, notably ''te̍k'' from {{nihongo4||的|teki}} and ''ka'' from {{nihongo4||か|ka}}, show up in the Taiwanese Hokkien of older speakers.

Whereas Mandarin attaches a syllabic suffix to the singular pronoun to make a [[collective]] form, Taiwanese Hokkien pronouns are collectivized through [[nasalization]]. For example, ''i'' (he/she/it) and ''goá'' (I) become ''in'' (they) and ''goán'' (we), respectively. The ''-n'' thus represents a subsyllabic [[morpheme]]. Like all other [[varieties of Chinese]], Taiwanese Hokkien does not have true grammatical [[plural]]s.

Unlike English, Taiwanese Hokkien has two [[first person plural|first-person plural]] pronouns. This distinction is called [[Clusivity|inclusive]], which includes the [[addressee]], and exclusive, which excludes the addressee. Thus, ''goán'' means ''we excluding you'', while ''lán'' means ''we including you'' (similar to [[pluralis auctoris]]). The inclusive ''lán'' may be used to express politeness or solidarity, as in the example of a speaker asking a stranger "Where do we live?" while implicitly asking "Where do ''you'' live?".

== Syntax ==
{{Listen|filename=Tai JintianDaoJiaKanWo.ogg|title=Kin-á-jit hit-ê cha-bó͘ gín-á lâi góan tau khòaⁿ góa.|description=An audio sample for a simple sentence, meaning "Today that little girl came to our house to see me".}}
The [[syntax]] of Taiwanese Hokkien is similar to southern Chinese varieties such as [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Yue Chinese|Yue]]. The [[subject–verb–object]] sequence is typical as in, for example, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], but [[subject–object–verb]] or the [[passive voice]] (with the sequence [[object–subject–verb]]) is possible with particles. Take a simple sentence for example: 'I hold you.' The words involved are: ''goá'' ('I' or 'me'), ''phō'' ('to hold'), ''lí'' ('you').
* Subject–verb–object (typical sequence): The sentence in the typical sequence would be: ''Goá phō lí.'' ('I hold you.')
* Subject–''kā''–object–verb: Another sentence of roughly equivalent meaning is ''Goá kā lí phō'', with the slight connotation of 'I take you and hold' or 'I get to you and hold'.
* Object ''hō͘'' subject–verb (the passive voice): Then, ''Lí hō͘ goá phō'' means the same thing but in the [[passive voice]], with the connotation of 'You allow yourself to be held by me' or 'You make yourself available for my holding'.

With this, more complicated sentences can be constructed: ''Goá kā chúi hō͘ lí lim'' ('I give water for you to drink': ''chúi'' means 'water'; ''lim'' is 'to drink').

This article can only give a few very simple examples on the syntax, for flavour. Linguistic work on the [[syntax]] of Taiwanese Hokkien is still a (quite nascent) scholarly topic being explored.

== Scripts and orthographies ==
{{Main|Written Hokkien}}

[[File:Holo bunhak chokphin.JPG|thumb|right|A selection of literary works (original and translated) in Taiwanese Hokkien, in several orthographies.]]

Taiwanese Hokkien does not have a strong written tradition. {{citation needed span|Until the late 19th century, Taiwanese speakers wrote mostly in [[Classical Chinese]]|date=June 2015}}. Among many systems of writing Taiwanese Hokkien using Latin characters, the most used is called [[pe̍h-oē-jī]] (POJ) and was developed in the 19th century, while the [[Taiwanese Romanization System]] has been officially promoted since 2006 by Taiwan's [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education]]. (For additional romanized systems, see references in "Orthography in Latin characters", below.) Nonetheless, Taiwanese Hokkien speakers nowadays most commonly write in [[Standard Chinese]] (Mandarin), though many of the same characters are also used to write Taiwanese Hokkien.

=== Han characters ===
In most cases, Taiwanese Hokkien speakers write using the [[writing system|script]] called [[Han characters]] as in Mandarin, although there are a number of special characters which are unique to Taiwanese Hokkien and which are sometimes used in informal writing. Where Han characters are used, they are not always etymological or genetic; the borrowing of similar-sounding or similar-meaning characters is a common practice. Bilingual speakers of both Mandarin and Taiwanese Hokkien sometimes attempt to represent the sounds by adopting similar-sounding Mandarin Han characters. For example, the Han characters of the [[Profanity|vulgar slang]] 'khoàⁿ sáⁿ-siâu' ({{linktext|lang=zh|看|三小}}, substituted for the etymologically correct {{linktext|lang=zh|看|啥潲}}, meaning 'What the hell are you looking at?’) has very little meaning in Mandarin and may not be readily understood by a Taiwanese Hokkien monolingual, as knowledge of Mandarin character readings is required to fully decipher it.

In 2007, the [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education]] in Taiwan published the first list of [[Taiwanese Southern Min Recommended Characters]], a list of 300 Han characters standardized for the use of writing Taiwanese Hokkien and implemented the teaching of them in schools.<ref>[http://www.nownews.com/2007/05/30/327-2104243.htm 教育部公布閩南語300字推薦用字　卡拉OK用字也被選用 (Ministry of Education in Taiwan announces 300 recommended Hokkien words, Karaoke words are also selected)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724212916/http://www.nownews.com/2007/05/30/327-2104243.htm |date=24 July 2011 }}; [http://www.edu.tw/mandr/news.aspx?news_sn=707&pages=6 「臺灣閩南語推薦用字（第1批）」已公布於網站，歡迎各界使用 (Announcement of recommended words for Taiwanese Hokkien)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144143/http://www.edu.tw/mandr/news.aspx?news_sn=707&pages=6 |date=18 July 2011 }}</ref> In 2008, the ministry published a second list of 100 characters, and in 2009 added 300 more, giving a total of 700 standardized characters used to write uniquely Taiwanese Hokkien words. With increasing literacy in Taiwanese Hokkien, there are currently more Taiwanese online bloggers who write Taiwanese Hokkien online using these standardized Chinese characters. Han characters are also used by Taiwan's Hokkien literary circle for Hokkien poets and writers to write literature or poetry in Taiwanese Hokkien.

=== Orthography in Latin characters ===
[[Image:Kauhoe.jpg|thumb|right|An issue of the ''[[Taiwan Church News]]'', first published by Presbyterian missionaries in 1885. This was the first printed newspaper in Taiwan, and was written in Taiwanese Hokkien, in the Latin orthography pe̍h-oē-jī.]]

There are several Latin-based orthographies, the oldest being [[Pe̍h-oē-jī]] (POJ, meaning "vernacular writing"), developed in the 19th century. [[Taiwanese Romanization System]] (Tâi-ôan Lô-má-jī, Tâi-Lô) and [[Taiwanese Language Phonetic Alphabet]] (TLPA) are two later adaptations of POJ. Other 20th-century innovations include [[Daighi tongiong pingim]] (DT), [[Ganvsig daiuuan bhanlam ghiw tongiong pingimv]] (GDT), [[Modern Literal Taiwanese]] (MLT), [[Simplified MLT]] (SMLT), [[Phofsit Daibuun]] (PSDB). The last four employ [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] [[spelling]] to indicate tone without use of [[diacritic]] symbols, but letters instead.

In POJ, the traditional list of letters is
:a b ch chh e g h i j k kh l m n ng o o͘ p ph s t th (ts) u
Twenty-four in all, including the obsolete {{angle bracket|ts}}, which was used to represent the modern {{angle bracket|ch}} at some places. The additional necessities are the nasal symbol {{angle bracket|ⁿ}}&nbsp; (superscript {{angle bracket|n}}; the uppercase form {{angle bracket|<sup>N</sup>}} is sometimes used in [[all caps]] texts,<ref>Tè Khái-sū (1999) [https://archive.org/details/Tpsurvey Writing Latinized Taiwanese Languages with Unicode]</ref> such as book titles or section headings), and the tonal [[diacritic]]s.
POJ was developed first by [[Presbyterian]] [[missionaries]] and later by the indigenous [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan]]; they have been active in promoting the language since the late 19th century. Recently there has been an increase in texts using a mixed orthography of Han characters and romanization, although these texts remain uncommon.

In 2006, the [[National Languages Committee]] (Ministry of Education, Republic of China) proposed [[Taiwanese Romanization System]] (Tâi-ôan Lô-má-jī, Tâi-lô). This alphabet reconciles two of the more senior orthographies, TLPA and POJ.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tlh.de-han.org/untong/2006/0929TaiLo.pdf|title=臺灣閩南語羅馬字拼音方案 (Orthographic system for the Minnan language in Taiwan, 'Tâi-ôan Lô-má-jī')}}</ref> The changes for the consonants involved using {{angle bracket|ts}} for POJ's {{angle bracket|ch}} (reverting to the orthography in the 19th century), and {{angle bracket|tsh}} for {{angle bracket|chh}}. For the vowels, {{angle bracket|o͘}} could optionally represented as {{angle bracket|oo}}. The nasal mark {{angle bracket|ⁿ}} could also be represented optionally as {{angle bracket|nn}}. The rest of the alphabet, most notably the use of diacritics to mark the tones, appeared to keep to the POJ tradition. One of the aims of this compromise was to curb any increase of 'market share' for Daighi tongiong pingim/Tongyong Pinyin.<ref>[http://203.64.42.21/TG/khinhoaN/other/TLsoatthiap.pdf 教育部國語推行委員會: 關於閩南語拼音整合工作相關問題說帖 (National Languages Committee: On the integration of Minnan orthographies), 2006-10-16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128050052/http://203.64.42.21/TG/khinhoaN/other/TLsoatthiap.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}</ref> It is unclear whether the community will adopt this new agreement.

=== Orthographies in kana and in bopomofo ===
[[Image:Japanese-Taiwanese Dictionary.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese–Taiwanese Dictionary, using the orthography in kana]]
{{Main|Taiwanese kana|Taiwanese Phonetic Symbols}}
There was an orthography of Taiwanese Hokkien based on the [[Kana|Japanese kana]] during [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]]. The [[Kuomintang]] government also tried to introduce an orthography in [[bopomofo]].

=== Computing ===
[[File:Pa-khek-le Kau-hoe.jpg|thumb|right|Pe̍h-ōe-jī inscription at a church in [[Tainan|Tâi-lâm]] commemorating [[Thomas Barclay (missionary)|Thomas Barclay]].]]

Many [[keyboard layout]]s and [[Chinese input methods for computers|input methods]] for entering either Latin or Han characters in Taiwanese Hokkien are available. Some of them are free-of-charge, some commercial.

The [[Min Nan]] dialect group is registered per {{IETF RFC|3066}} as [https://www.iana.org/assignments/lang-tags/zh-min-nan zh-min-nan].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertype.com/standards/iso639/iana-lang-assignments.html|title=Evertype|website=www.evertype.com}}</ref> Taiwanese Min Nan can be represented as 'zh-min-nan-TW'.

When writing Taiwanese Hokkien in Han characters, some writers create 'new' characters when they consider it is impossible to use directly or borrow existing ones; this corresponds to similar practices in character usage in [[Written Cantonese|Cantonese]], [[chu nom|Vietnamese chữ nôm]], [[Hanja|Korean hanja]] and [[Kanji|Japanese kanji]]. These are usually not encoded in [[Unicode]] (or the corresponding ISO/IEC 10646: [[Universal Character Set]]), thus creating problems in computer processing.

All Latin characters required by pe̍h-oē-jī can be represented using [[Unicode]] (or the corresponding ISO/IEC 10646: [[Universal character set]]), using precomposed or combining (diacritics) characters.

{{Main|O͘}}
Prior to June 2004, the vowel {{IPA|[ɔ]}} akin to but more open than ⟨o⟩, written with a 'dot above right', was not encoded. The usual workaround was to use the (stand-alone; spacing) character ‘[[Interpunct|middle dot]]’ (U+00B7, ⟨·⟩) or less commonly the combining character 'dot above' (U+0307). As these are far from ideal, since 1997 proposals have been submitted to the ISO/IEC [[working group]] in charge of ISO/IEC 10646 &ndash; namely, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070628163947/http://anubis.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/wg2/ ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2] &ndash; to encode a new combining character 'dot above right'. This is now officially assigned to U+0358 (see documents [http://www.evertype.com/standards/la/taioan.html N1593], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311082219/http://anubis.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n2507 N2507], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060928065416/http://anubis.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n2628 N2628],

<!--[[File:Taiwanese Hokkien subdialects map.png|thumb|A map of the different accents found in Taiwanese Hokkien (the coastal accent is incorrectly labelled).]]-->

The [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige variant]] of Taiwanese Hokkien is the southern speech found in [[Tainan]] and [[Kaohsiung]]. Other major variants are the northern speech, the central speech (near [[Taichung]] and the port town of [[Lukang, Changhua|Lukang]]), and the northern (northeastern) coastal speech (dominant in [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan]]).

The distinguishing feature of the coastal speech is the use of the vowel {{angle bracket|uiⁿ}} in place of {{angle bracket|ng}}. The northern speech is distinguished by the absence of the [[#Tones|8th tone]], and some vowel exchanges (for example, {{angle bracket|i}} and {{angle bracket|u}}, {{angle bracket|e}} and {{angle bracket|oe}}). The central speech has an additional vowel {{IPA|[ɨ]}} or {{IPA|[ø]}} between {{angle bracket|i}} and {{angle bracket|u}}, which may be represented as {{angle bracket|ö}}. There are also a number of other pronunciation and lexical differences between the Taiwanese Hokkien variants; the online Ministry of Education dictionary specifies these to a resolution of eight regions on Taiwan proper, in addition to [[Kinmen]] and [[Penghu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twblg.dict.edu.tw/holodict_new/index/fulu_fangyan_level2.jsp?condition=cuankho|script-title=zh:方言差"語音差異表|trans-title=Table of Pronunciation Differences|year=2011|work=臺灣閩南語常用詞辭典|publisher=Ministry of Education, R.O.C.|language=zh|access-date=8 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://twblg.dict.edu.tw/holodict_new/index/fulu_fangyan_level2.jsp?condition=cuankho_p|script-title=zh:方言差"詞彙差異表|trans-title=Table of Vocabulary Differences |year=2011|work=臺灣閩南語常用詞辭典|publisher=Ministry of Education, R.O.C.|language=zh|access-date=8 July 2011}}</ref>

Concerning the fifth (rising) tone in normal sandhi patterns, the Quanzhou/Coastal/Northern dialects change to seventh (mid level) tone, whereas the Zhangzhou/"Mixed"/Southern dialects change to third (low falling) tone.

Certain new north–south distinctions have appeared in recent decades.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=Jack C.|date=1977-01-01|title=Variation in Singapore English|jstor=43135170|journal=Interlanguage Studies Bulletin|volume=2|issue=2|pages=131–151}}</ref> The fourth and eighth tones tend to be reversed in the north and south.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/resources/PronouncingTaiwanese.html|title=Jordan: Pronouncing Romanized Taiwanese Hokkien|website=pages.ucsd.edu}}</ref>{{better source|date=November 2016}}

====Quanzhou&ndash;Zhangzhou inclinations====

[[Hokkien]] immigrants to Taiwan originated from [[Quanzhou]] prefecture (44.8%) and [[Zhangzhou]] prefecture (35.2%).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The original phonology from these regions was spread around Taiwan during the immigration process. With the advanced development of transportation and greater mobility of the Taiwanese population, Taiwanese Hokkien speech has steered itself towards a mixture of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou speech, known as ''Chiang&ndash;Chôan-lām'' (漳泉濫, in Mandarin ''Zhāng&ndash;Quán làn'').{{sfnp|Ang|1987}} Due to different proportion of mixture, some regions are inclined more towards Quanzhou accent, while others are inclined more towards Zhangzhou accent.

In general, Quanzhou accent is more common along the coastal region and is known as the ''hái-kháu'' accent; Zhangzhou accent is more common within the mountainous region of Taiwan and is known as the ''lāi-po͘'' accent. The regional variation within Taiwanese Hokkien may be attributed to variations in the mixture of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou accents and/or lexicons. It ranges from Lukang accent (based on Quanzhou accent) on one end, to the northern coastal [[Yilan City|Yilan]] accent (based on Zhangzhou accent) on another end. Tainan, Kaohsiung and Taitung accents, on the other hand, are closest to the prestige accent.

====Recent terminological distinctions====
Recent research has found a need for new terminology of Taiwanese Hokkien dialects, mainly because the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects in Taiwan developed independently from those in Fujian. Thus, some scholars (i.e., Klöter, following {{lang|zh-tw|董忠司}}) have divided Taiwanese Hokkien into five subdialects, based on geographic region:{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=4}}
#''hái-kháu'' ({{lang|zh-tw|海口腔}}): west coast, based on what was formerly referred to as Quanzhou dialect (represented by the Lukang accent)
#''phian-hái'' ({{lang|zh-tw|偏海腔}}): coastal (represented by the Nanliao ({{lang|zh-tw|南寮}}) accent)
#''lāi-po͘'' ({{lang|zh-tw|內埔腔}}): western inner plain, mountain regions, based on the Zhangzhou dialect (represented by the Yilan accent)
#''phian-lāi'' ({{lang|zh-tw|偏內腔}}): interior (represented by the [[Taibao]] accent)
#''thong-hêng'' ({{lang|zh-tw|通行腔}}): common accents (represented by the Taipei (spec. [[Datong District, Taipei|Datong]]) accent in the north and the Tainan accent in the south)
Both ''phian-hái'' and ''phian-lāi'' are intermediate dialects between ''hái-kháu'' and ''lāi-po͘'', these also known as ''thong-hêng'' ({{lang|zh-tw|通行腔}}) or "{{lang|zh-tw|不泉不漳}}". In some ways this mixed dialect is similar to the Amoy dialect, which itself is a blend of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou speech. The common dialect refers to that which can be heard on radio, television, official announcements, etc.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Fluency ===
A great majority of people in Taiwan can speak both [[Mandarin Chinese]] and Taiwanese Hokkien although the degree of fluency varies widely.<ref name="housing census" /> There are however small but significant numbers of people in Taiwan, mainly but not exclusively [[Hakka people|Hakka]] and [[Mainland Chinese|Mainlanders]], who cannot speak Taiwanese Hokkien fluently. A shrinking percentage of the population, mainly people born before the 1950s, cannot speak Mandarin at all, or learned to speak Mandarin later in life, though some of these speak Japanese fluently. Urban, working-class Hakkas as well as younger, southern-Taiwan Mainlanders tend to have better, even native-like fluency. Approximately half of the Hakka in Taiwan do speak Taiwanese Hokkien. There are many families of mixed Hakka, Hoklo, and [[Taiwanese aborigines|Aboriginal]] bloodlines. There is, however, a large percentage of people in Taiwan, regardless of their background, whose ability to understand and read written Taiwanese Hokkien is greater than their ability to speak it. This is the case with some singers who can sing Taiwanese songs with native-like proficiency, but can neither speak nor understand the language.

Which variant is used depends strongly on the context, and in general people will use Mandarin in more formal situations and Taiwanese Hokkien in more informal situations. Taiwanese Hokkien tends to get used more in [[rural]] areas, while Mandarin is used more in [[urban area|urban]] settings. Older people tend to use Taiwanese Hokkien, while younger people tend to use Mandarin. In the broadcast media where Mandarin is used in many genres, [[soap opera]], [[variety show]]s, and even some news programs can also be found in Taiwanese Hokkien.

=== Sociolinguistics and gender ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
Taiwanese Hokkien is also perceived by some to have a slight masculine leaning, making it more popular among the males of the younger population. It is sometimes perceived as "unladylike" when spoken by the females of the younger population.

=== Special literary and art forms ===

''Chhit-jī-á'' (literally, "that which has seven syllables") is a [[poetry|poetic]] [[meter (poetry)|meter]] where each verse has 7 syllables.

There is a special form of [[music]]al/[[drama]]tic performance ''koa-á-hì'': the [[Taiwanese opera]]; the subject matter is usually a [[history|historical event]]. A similar form ''pò͘-tē-hì'' ([[glove puppetry]]) is also unique and has been elaborated in the past two decades into impressive [[television|televised]] spectacles.

See [[Taiwanese cuisine]] for names of several local dishes.

===Bible translations===
[[File:Bibles in Taiwanese.jpg|thumb|right|A collection of translations of the Bible in Taiwanese Hokkien. Top left, ''Today’s Taiwanese'' version; top right, the Red-Cover Bible; bottom, Barclay's translation.]]

As with many other languages, the [[Chinese Bible Translations|translations of the Bible]] in Taiwanese Hokkien marked milestones in the standardization attempts of the language and its orthography.

The first translation of the Bible in Amoy or Taiwanese Hokkien in the pe̍h-ōe-jī orthography was by the first missionary to Taiwan, [[James Laidlaw Maxwell]], with the New Testament ''Lán ê Kiù-chú Iâ-so͘ Ki-tok ê Sin-iok'' published in 1873 and the Old Testament ''Kū-iok ê Sèng Keng'' in 1884.

[[File:Taiwanese Bible Chim-gian 1933.jpg|thumb|left|A copy of Barclay's Amoy translation, opened to the Proverbs.]]

The Ko-Tân ([[Kerygma]]) Colloquial Taiwanese Version of the New Testament (''Sin-iok'') in pe̍h-ōe-jī, also known as the {{Interlanguage link|Red Cover Bible|zh-min-nan|Âng-phoê Sèng-keng|WD=}} ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=|poj=Âng-phoê Sèng-keng|labels=no}}), was published in 1973 as an ecumenical effort between the Protestant [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan]] and the Roman Catholic mission [[Maryknoll]]. This translation used a more modern vocabulary (somewhat influenced by Mandarin), and reflected the central Taiwan dialect, as the Maryknoll mission was based near [[Taichung|Tâi-tiong]].  It was soon confiscated by the Kuomintang government (which objected to the use of Latin orthography) in 1975. The copies of the ecumenical NT are now available on the online stores.

=== Politics ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Taiwanese pop]] -->
[[File:Banning of POJ.gif|thumb|right|A decree (1955) banning the use of Pe̍h-ōe-jī, a Latin orthography for Taiwanese Hokkien, in church.]]
Until the 1980s, the use of Taiwanese Hokkien, along with all [[Varieties of Chinese|varieties]] other than [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]], was discouraged by the [[Kuomintang]] through measures such as banning its use in schools and limiting the amount of Taiwanese Hokkien broadcast on electronic media.  These measures were removed by the 1990s, and Taiwanese Hokkien became an emblem of [[Taiwanese localization movement|localization]].  Mandarin remains the predominant language of education, although there is a "mother tongue" language requirement in Taiwanese schools which can be satisfied with student's choice of mother tongue: Taiwanese Hokkien, Hakka, or [[Formosan languages|aboriginal languages]].

Although the use of Taiwanese Hokkien over Mandarin was historically part of the [[Taiwan independence movement]], the linkage between politics and language is not as strong as it once was.  Some fluency in Taiwanese Hokkien is desirable for political office in Taiwan for both independence and unificationist politicians.  At the same time even some supporters of Taiwan independence have played down its connection with Taiwanese Hokkien in order to gain the support of the [[Mainland Chinese|Mainlander]]s and [[Hakka people]].

[[James Soong]] restricted the use of Taiwanese Hokkien and other local tongues in broadcasting while serving as Director of the [[Government Information Office]] earlier in his career, but later became one of the first politicians of Mainlander origin to use Taiwanese Hokkien in semi-formal occasions.{{synthesis inline|date=August 2016}}  Since then, politicians opposed to Taiwanese independence have used it frequently in rallies, even when they are not native speakers.  Conversely, politicians who have traditionally been identified with Taiwan independence have used Mandarin on formal occasions and semi-formal occasions such as press conferences.  An example of the latter is former President [[Chen Shui-bian]] who uses Mandarin in all official state speeches, but uses mainly Taiwanese Hokkien in political rallies and some informal state occasions such as New Year greetings. The current [[President of Taiwan]] and of the ([[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]]), Dr. [[Tsai Ing-wen]] has been criticized by her supporters for not using Taiwanese Hokkien in speeches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newtaiwan.com.tw/bulletinview.jsp?bulletinid=80826 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5dPfuafUb?url=http://www.newtaiwan.com.tw/bulletinview.jsp?bulletinid=80826 |archive-date=28 December 2008 |script-title=zh:蔡英文不說台語 高雄人涼了半截 |trans-title=Tsai Ing-wen doesn't speak Taiwanese; The people in Kaohsiung feel half-disappointed |language=zh |access-date=12 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Former President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] spoke in Taiwanese Hokkien during his 2008 [[Double Ten Day]] speech when he was talking about the state of the [[Economy of Taiwan|economy in Taiwan]].

In the early 21st century, there are few differences in language usage between the [[Chinese unification|pro-reuinification]] leaning [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] and the [[Taiwan independence movement|independence]] leaning [[Pan-Green Coalition]].  Both tend to use Taiwanese Hokkien at political rallies and sometimes in informal interviews, and both tend to use Mandarin at formal press conferences and official state functions.  Both also tend to use more Mandarin in [[Northern Taiwan]] and more Taiwanese Hokkien in [[Southern Taiwan]].  However, at official party gatherings (as opposed to both Mandarin-leaning state functions and Taiwanese-leaning party rallies), the DPP tends to use Taiwanese Hokkien while KMT and [[PFP (Taiwan)|PFP]] tend to use Mandarin. The [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], which advocates a strong line on Taiwan independence, tends to use Taiwanese Hokkien even in formal press conferences.  In speaking, politicians will frequently [[Code-switching|code switch]].  In writing, almost everyone uses [[written vernacular Chinese|vernacular Mandarin]] which is further from Taiwanese, and the use of semi-alphabetic writing or even [[Written Hokkien#Chinese characters|colloquial Taiwanese characters]] is rare.<ref>{{Cite thesis|title=An investigation of written Taiwanese|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/11520|date=2005|degree=MA|language=en-US|first=Katsuhiro J.|last=Ota|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Mair|first=Victor|title=Taiwanese, Mandarin, and Taiwan's language situation|url=http://pinyin.info/readings/mair/taiwanese.html|access-date=2020-08-06|website=pinyin.info}}</ref>

{{citation needed span|Despite these commonalities, there are still different attitudes toward the relationship between Taiwanese and Mandarin.  In general, while supporters of [[Chinese reunification]] believe that all languages used on Taiwan should be respected, they tend to believe that Mandarin should have a preferred status as the [[Lingua franca|common working language]] between different groups.  Supporters of Taiwanese independence tend to believe that either Taiwanese Hokkien should be preferred or that no language should be preferred.|date=May 2019|reason=Very likely true in some sense, but is this "commonsensapedia" or is this a website where we give reliable scholarly sources for claims like this?

In 2002, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, a party with about 10% of the [[Legislative Yuan]] seats at the time, suggested making Taiwanese Hokkien a second official language.<ref>{{cite news |author=Lin Mei-chun |title=Hokkien should be given official status, says TSU |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2002/03/10/0000127068 |work=Taipei Times|date=10 March 2002 |page=1 }}</ref> This proposal encountered strong opposition not only from Mainlander groups but also from Hakka and aboriginal groups who felt that it would slight their home languages, as well as others including [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] who objected to the proposal on logistical grounds and on the grounds that it would increase ethnic tensions.  Because of these objections, support for this measure is lukewarm among moderate Taiwan independence supporters, and the proposal did not pass.

In 2003, there was a controversy when parts of the civil service examination for judges were written in characters used only in Taiwanese Hokkien.<ref>{{cite news|author=Ko Shu-ling|title=Control Yuan sets rules for future examinations |page=2 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/09/20/2003203606 |work=Taipei Times|date=20 September 2004}}</ref> After strong objections, these questions were not used in scoring. As with the official-language controversy, objections to the use of Taiwanese Hokkien came not only from Mainlander groups, but also Hoklo, Hakka and aborigines.  The [[Control Yuan]] later created a rule that only allowed Standard Mandarin characters on civil service exams.  According to public opinion surveys in 2008, more people supported making English a second official language than Taiwanese Hokkien.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Gijsen, Johan |author2=Liu Yu-Chang  |chapter=Chapter 8: The Quest for a New Civic and Linguistic Identity: Mandarin and English Encroachment upon the Taiwanese Language |title=Critical Perspectives on Language and Discourse in the New World Order|editor1-last=Abdullah|editor1-first=Faiz Sathi|editor2-last=Abdullah|editor2-first=Mardziah Hayati|editor3-last=Hoon|editor3-first=Tan Bee|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|location=Newcastle|isbn=9781847183408|page=156}}</ref>

===Mother tongue movement===
[[Taiwanese localization movement|Taiwanization]] developed in the 1990s into a ‘[[mother tongue]] revival movement' aiming to save, preserve, and develop the local ethnic culture and language of Holo (Taiwanese Hokkien), Hakka, and aborigines.  The effort to [[Language revitalization|save declining languages]] has since allowed them to revive and flourish.  In 1993, Taiwan became the first country in the world to implement the teaching of Taiwanese Hokkien in schools. By 2001, Taiwanese languages such as Taiwanese Hokkien, Hakka, and aboriginal languages were taught in all Taiwanese schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhu.edu.tw/~society/e-j/45/45-16.htm|author=許嘉文|date=15 March 2005|language=zh|script-title=zh:台灣鄉土教育發展史|trans-title=The education history of local Taiwanese languages}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=March 2016}}{{dubious|date=March 2016}} Since the 2000s, elementary school students are required to take a class in either Taiwanese Hokkien, Hakka or aboriginal languages.{{sfnp|Lin|2002}}{{failed verification|date=March 2016}}{{dubious|date=March 2016}}  In junior high this is usually an available [[Course (education)#Elective and required courses|elective]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ey.gov.tw/AnnoucePage2.aspx|title=行政院全球資訊網|website=www.ey.gov.tw|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref> Taiwan also has its own [[Taiwan literature movement|literary circle]] whereby Hokkien poets and writers compose poetry and literature in Taiwanese Hokkien on a regular basis.

As a result of the mother tongue movement, Taiwan has emerged as a significant cultural hub for Hokkien in the world in the 21st century. It also plans to be the major export center for [[Hokkien culture]] worldwide in the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npf.org.tw/11/4118|title=馬英九 {{!}} 馬蕭文化政策 {{!}} 國家政策研究基金會 {{!}} 公共政策的理性思辯與對話平台！|website=國家政策研究基金會|language=zh-TW|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref>
