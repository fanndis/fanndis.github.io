[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] made two successful appointments to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The first was Judge [[Sonia Sotomayor]]<ref name=latimes_20090526>Mark Silva, [https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-sonia-sotomayor27-2009may27,0,3835713.story Sonia Sotomayor is Obama's Supreme Court nominee], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (May 26, 2009).</ref> to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[David Souter|David H.

The second appointment was that of Solicitor General [[Elena Kagan]] to replace the retired [[John Paul Stevens]]. Kagan was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on August 5, 2010, by a vote of 63–37.

During his final year in office, Obama had an opportunity to fill a third Supreme Court vacancy, following the February 13, 2016, death of Associate Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]. On March 16, 2016, he nominated [[Merrick Garland]], the Chief Judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] to the Court.<ref name=whgov_20160213>"President Obama Delivers a Statement on the Passing of Supreme Court Justice Scalia", Rancho Mirage, CA, Feb. 13, 2016, available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/president-obama-delivers-statement-passing-supreme-court-justice-scalia</ref> However, Republican leaders in the Senate announced that they planned to withhold voting on any potential nominee until a new president was elected.

During most of Obama's presidency, there had been speculation about the potential retirement of Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]],<ref name=abc020410>Ariane de Vogue, [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Supreme_Court/white-house-prepares-possibility-supreme-court-vacancies/story?id=9740077&page=1 White House Prepares for Possibility of 2 Supreme Court Vacancies], ''[[ABC News]]'' (February 4, 2010).</ref><ref name=usatoday_20080713>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-07-13-scotus-election_N.htm At Supreme Court, no one rushes into retirement], ''[[USA Today]]'' (July 13, 2008).</ref> who turned 80 in 2013 and was previously diagnosed with [[Colorectal cancer|colon cancer]] and [[pancreatic cancer]].<ref name=nyt020509>Adam Liptak, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/washington/06ginsburg.html Ginsburg Has Surgery for Pancreatic Cancer], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (February 5, 2009).</ref><ref name=wapo020609>Carrie Johnson, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/06/AR2009020603726.html Ginsburg illness puts focus on Obama's choices] ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (February 6, 2009).</ref>  Justice Ginsburg died on September 18, 2020, during [[Donald Trump]]'s presidency, and was replaced by [[Amy Coney Barrett]].

===Obama opposition to Bush nominees===
During the [[109th Congress]], then-Senator Obama voted against both of President [[George W. Bush]]'s nominees to the Supreme Court. In a speech announcing his opposition to [[John Roberts]], Obama stated:
{{quote|sign=Barack Obama|source=|The problem I face ... is that while adherence to legal precedent and rules of statutory or constitutional construction will dispose of 95 percent of the cases that come before a court so that both a [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]] and a [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]] will arrive at the same place most of the time on those 95 percent of the cases – what matters on the Supreme Court is those 5 percent of cases that are truly difficult. In those 5 percent of hard cases, the constitutional text will not be directly on point.... In those circumstances, your decisions about whether affirmative action is an appropriate response to the history of discrimination in this country or whether a general right of privacy encompasses a more specific right of women to control their reproductive decisions, ... in those difficult cases, the critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge's heart.... The problem I had is that when I examined Judge Roberts' record and history of public service, it is my personal estimation that he has far more often used his formidable skills on behalf of the strong in opposition to the weak.<ref>[http://obama.senate.gov/press/050922-remarks_of_sena/ Obama Senate floor speech opposing John Roberts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030231631/http://obama.senate.gov/press/050922-remarks_of_sena/ |date=October 30, 2008 }}.</ref>}}

In explaining his opposition to [[Samuel Alito]], Obama further evaluated the qualities he found important in a Supreme Court justice:
{{quote|I have no doubt that Judge Alito has the training and qualifications necessary to serve. He's an intelligent man and an accomplished jurist. And there's no indication he's not a man of great character. But when you look at his record – when it comes to his understanding of the Constitution, I have found that in almost every case, he consistently sides on behalf of the powerful against the powerless; on behalf of a strong government or corporation against upholding Americans' individual rights.<ref>[http://obama.senate.gov/speech/060126-floor_statement_1/ Obama Senate floor speech opposing Samuel Alito] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030231411/http://obama.senate.gov/speech/060126-floor_statement_1/ |date=October 30, 2008 }}.</ref>}}

===Obama comments during 2008 presidential campaign===
In a speech on July 17, 2007, before the [[Planned Parenthood|Planned Parenthood Action Fund]], he elaborated even more:
{{quote|I think the Constitution can be interpreted in so many ways. And one way is a cramped and narrow way in which the Constitution and the courts essentially become the rubber stamps of the powerful in society. And then there's another vision of the court that says that the courts are the refuge of the powerless. Because oftentimes they can lose in the democratic back and forth. They may be locked out and prevented from fully participating in the democratic process. ... And we need somebody who's got the heart – the empathy – to recognize what it's like to be a young teenage mom. The empathy to understand what it's like to be poor or African-American or gay or disabled or old – and that's the criteria by which I'll be selecting my judges.<ref>[http://lauraetch.googlepages.com/barackobamabeforeplannedparenthoodaction Obama Planned Parenthood speech] (July 17, 2007).</ref>}}

In November 2007, Obama was asked about the kind of justices he would appoint to the Supreme Court. He responded:
{{quote|I taught constitutional law for 10 years, and . . . when you look at what makes a great Supreme Court justice, it's not just the particular issue and how they rule, but it's their conception of the Court. And part of the role of the Court is that it is going to protect people who may be vulnerable in the political process, the outsider, the minority, those who are vulnerable, those who don't have a lot of clout.

. . . [S]ometimes we're only looking at academics or people who've been in the [lower courts]. If we can find people who have life experience and they understand what it means to be on the outside, what it means to have the system not work for them, that's the kind of person I want on the Supreme Court.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/15/us/politics/15debate-transcript.html The Democratic Debate], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (November 15, 2007).</ref>}}

Later in March 2008, while on the campaign trail in Ohio, Obama again addressed the traits he would look for in a Supreme Court justice, suggesting he might leaven legal scholarship with practical political experience. He held up [[Earl Warren]], a former governor of California who later became [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]], as an example. Mr. Warren, he said, had had the wisdom to recognize that segregation was wrong less because of precise sociological effects and more so because it was immoral and stigmatized blacks:
{{quote|I want people [like Earl Warren] on the bench who have enough empathy, enough feeling, for what ordinary people are going through.<ref>Michael Powell, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/us/politics/03campaign.html Strong Words in Ohio as Obama and Clinton Press On], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (March 3, 2008).</ref>}}

Later, however, Obama seemed to step away from the example of Warren. In an interview with the editorial board of the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' on October 2, 2008, Obama said:
{{quote|There were a lot of justices on the Warren Court who were heroes of mine ... Warren himself, Brennan, (Thurgood) Marshall. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that I think their judicial philosophy is appropriate for today . . . In fact, I would be troubled if you had that same kind of activism in circumstances today.<ref name=dfp_20081003>[http://www.freep.com/article/20081003/OPINION01/810030434/ Obama: Fundamental change needed to help Michigan, nation], ''[[Detroit Free Press|The Detroit Free Press]]'' (October 3, 2008).</ref>}}

Instead, Obama mentioned then current justices [[David Souter]] and [[Stephen Breyer]] as examples of people he would like to nominate to the Supreme Court in the future:
{{quote|.  .  .  [W]hen I think about the kinds of judges who are needed today, it goes back to the point I was making about common sense and pragmatism as opposed to ideology.

I think that Justice Souter, who was a Republican appointee, Justice Breyer, a Democratic appointee, are very sensible judges. They take a look at the facts and they try to figure out: How does the Constitution apply to these facts? They believe in fidelity to the text of the Constitution, but they also think you have to look at what is going on around you and not just ignore real life.

That, I think is the kind of justice that I’m looking for – somebody who respects the law, doesn’t think that they should be making law ... but also has a sense of what’s happening in the real world and recognizes that one of the roles of the courts is to protect people who don’t have a voice.<ref name=dfp_20081003/>}}

In the third and final presidential debate with Republican nominee [[John McCain]] on October 15, 2008, Obama also implied that he would look for a Supreme Court nominee with previous judicial experience:
{{quote|I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/10/debate-transcri.html Complete final debate transcript: John McCain and Barack Obama], ''[[Los Angeles Times|The Los Angeles Times]]'' (October 15, 2008).</ref>}}

===Court demographics===
{{main|Demographics of the Supreme Court of the United States}}
Demographic considerations have played into the appointment of Supreme Court justices since the institution was established. Starting in the 20th century, these concerns shifted from geographic representation to issues of gender and ethnicity.<ref name=toobin_20090608>Jeffrey Toobin, [https://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2009/06/08/090608taco_talk_toobin Diverse Opinions], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', (June 8, 2009).</ref>

Prior to the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], many court watchers suggested that the next president would be under significant pressure to appoint another woman or ethnic minority to the court.<ref name=stohr_20080715>Greg Stohr, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=analt7SXDKiQ&refer=home Obama, McCain Would Look to Women, Hispanics for Supreme Court], ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' (July 15, 2008).</ref><ref name=rosen_20080312>[[Jeffrey Rosen (legal academic)|Jeffrey Rosen]], [http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=57762136-6855-44c6-b057-7510b7cb4eda Short Bench: Why the Dems lack Supreme Court nominees], ''[[The New Republic]]'' (March 12, 2008).</ref> The calls for naming more women were particularly widespread given the recent retirement of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] and the rapidly changing demographics of the legal community, with women now accounting for about a fifth of all law partners and law school deans, a quarter of the federal bench, and nearly half of all law school graduates.<ref name=wapo020609/><ref name=csavage_20090501>Charlie Savage, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/us/02search.html Wider World of Choices to Fill Souter’s Vacancy], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (May 1, 2009).</ref> Shortly before the election, for example, [[National Public Radio|NPR]] reported, "Most observers of the Supreme Court agree about one thing: The next nominee is likely to be a woman".<ref name=npr_20081030>[[Nina Totenberg]], [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96337196 Law School Past Shapes Obama's View On Justices], ''[[National Public Radio]]'' (November 2, 2008).</ref> Furthermore, after Obama's presidential election victory, Hispanic legal [[Interest group|interests groups]] such as the [[Hispanic National Bar Association]] began urging Obama to nominate a Hispanic justice.<ref name=mauro_20081201>[[Tony Mauro]], [http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202426348102 Pressure Is on Obama to Name First Hispanic Supreme Court Justice], ''[[Legal Times]]'' (December 1, 2008).</ref>

Given the relative youth of the most recent Republican appointments, it was also noted that Democrats had "a strong incentive to pick younger justices this time around".<ref name=rosen_20080312/> Age proved to be an important consideration for Obama, who was "looking for a justice who will be an intellectual force on the court for many years to come".<ref name=cnn_20090513>Bill Mears, [http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/13/scotus.obama/index.html Sources: High court selection process down to finalists], ''[[CNN]]'' (May 13, 2009).</ref> As a result, Obama did not seriously consider candidates such as [[José A. Cabranes]], [[Amalya Kearse]], [[Diana Gribbon Motz]], [[David Tatel]], and [[Laurence Tribe]], all of whom he respected but were older than 65 when Obama was looking to replace [[David Souter]].<ref name=cnn_20090513/>

With the retirement of Justice Stevens, some commentators directed focus on the religious make-up of the court.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/weekinreview/11liptak.html | work=The New York Times | title=Justice Stevens, the Only Protestant on the Supreme Court | first=Adam | last=Liptak | date=April 10, 2010}}</ref> Upon Justice Stevens' retirement, the Court lacked any Protestant members, marking the first time in its history that it will be exclusively composed of Jewish and Catholic Justices.<ref name="npr lack">[[Nina Totenberg]], "Supreme Court May Soon Lack Protestant Justices," [[NPR]], ''Heard on Morning Edition'', April 7, 2010, found at [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125641988 NPR website] and transcript found at [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=125641988 NPR website].

==Sonia Sotomayor nomination==
{{Main|Sonia Sotomayor Supreme Court nomination}}
On May 26, 2009, Obama announced [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]] appeals court judge [[Sonia Sotomayor]] as his choice to replace retiring [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[David Souter|David H. Souter]].<ref name=latimes_20090526/> Sotomayor's nomination was submitted to the [[United States Senate]] on June 1, 2009, when the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]] reconvened after its Memorial Day recess.

===David Souter retirement===
Long before the election of President Obama, Associate Justice [[David H.
