A '''war hawk''', or simply '''hawk''', is 
a term used in politics for someone who favors [[war]] or continuing to escalate an existing conflict as opposed to other solutions. War hawks are the opposite of [[War dove|dove]]s.

The term "war hawk" was coined in 1792 and was often used to ridicule politicians who favored a pro-war policy in peacetime. Historian Donald R. Hickey found 129 uses of the term in American newspapers before late 1811, mostly from [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] warning against [[Democratic-Republican Party|Republican]] foreign policy. Some antiwar Republicans used it, such as  Virginia Congressman [[John Randolph of Roanoke]].<ref>Donald R. Hickey, "War Hawks": Using Newspapers to Trace a Phrase, 1792-1812" ''Journal of Military History'' (2014) 78#2 pp 725-740.</ref>  There was never any "official" roster of War Hawks; as Hickey notes, "Scholars differ over who (if anyone) ought to be classified as a War Hawk."<ref>Donald Hickey, ''The War of 1812: A Forgotten Conflict'' (Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1989), p. 334n.8.</ref> However, most historians use the term to describe about one or two dozen members of the [[12th United States Congress|Twelfth Congress]]. The leader of this faction was [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]] of Kentucky. [[John C. Calhoun]] of South Carolina was another notable War Hawk. Both of these men became major players in American politics for decades. Other men traditionally identified as War Hawks include [[Richard Mentor Johnson]] of Kentucky, [[William Lowndes (congressman)|William Lowndes]] of South Carolina, [[Langdon Cheves]] of South Carolina, [[Felix Grundy]] of Tennessee, and [[William W. Bibb]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref name="Eaton25"/>

President [[James Madison]] set the legislative agenda for Congress, providing committees in the House of Representatives with policy recommendations to be introduced as bills on the House floor.<ref>{{Citation| last = Stagg| first = J.C.A.| title = James Madison and the "Malcontents": The Political Origins of the War of 1812| journal = The William and Mary Quarterly| volume = 33| issue = 4| year = 1976| pages = 557â€“585| doi=10.2307/1921716| jstor = 1921716765}}</ref>

==Variations of the term==
The term has also been expanded into "[[chickenhawk (politics)|chicken hawk]]", referring to a war hawk who avoided [[military service]]. 

The term "[[liberal hawk]]" is a derivation of the traditional phrase, in the sense that it denotes an individual with "socially [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]" 
inclinations coupled with an aggressive outlook on foreign policy.

In modern American usage "hawk" refers to a fierce advocate for a cause or policy, such as "[[deficit hawk]]" or "privacy hawk". It may also refer to a person or political leader who favors a strong or aggressive military policy, though not necessarily outright war.
