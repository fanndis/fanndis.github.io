''The West Australian'' was owned by the publicly listed company '''''West Australian Newspapers Ltd''''' from the 1920s. In 1969, the Melbourne-based [[The Herald and Weekly Times]] Ltd bought WAN and published the paper until 1987 when it was sold to [[Robert Holmes à Court]]'s [[Robert Holmes à Court#The Bell Group|Bell Group]] in 1987 when the remainder of H&WT was bought by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]].<ref>[http://www.ketupa.net/bond1.htm#eighties Bond, Bell and Holmes a Court:Bell] at Ketupa.net media industry reference</ref> The following year [[Alan Bond (businessman)|Alan Bond]], through Bond Corporation, gained control of Bell Group and hence the paper. This ownership structure only survived for a few years until the collapse of Bond Corporation. A newly formed company, ''West Australian Newspapers Holdings'', then purchased the paper from the receivers before being [[initial public offering|floated]] in an oversubscribed $185 million public offering.<ref name="175 years of The West Australian">[http://www.australian-media.com.au/index.php?c=home&p=news&article=7823 175 years of The West Australian]</ref> Chairman [[Trevor Eastwood]] announced in the annual report that the company was listed on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]] ({{asx|SWM}}) on 9 January 1992.

== History ==
[[Image:PerthGazette 1833 06 01 1 masthead.jpg|thumb|Masthead from the ''Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal'', published Saturday 1 June 1833.]]

''The West Australian'' traces its origins to '''''The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal''''', the first edition of which appeared on 5 January 1833. Owned and edited by Perth [[postmaster]] [[Charles Macfaull]], it was originally a four-page weekly.<ref>''The West Australian'', 17 November 1979, p.39</ref> It was, at first, published on Saturdays, but changed to Fridays in 1864. From 7 October 1864 it was known as '''''The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Times''''' and was published by Arthur Shenton, until 24 March 1871, after which the publisher was Joseph Mitchell, until 29 September 1871. The new publisher, M. Shenton, remained in place until 26 June 1874. when it was bought by a syndicate who renamed it '''''The Western Australian Times''''' and who in September 1874 increased production to two editions a week. On 18 November 1879, it was relaunched as '''''The West Australian'''''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page724477 |title=The West Australian |work=The West Australian |date=18 November 1879 |page=2 |accessdate=30 April 2014 }}</ref> In October 1883, production was increased to three editions per week; two years later it became a daily publication. The proprietors of the ''West Australian'' at that time also inaugurated the '''''[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|Western Mail]]''''', in 1885. Initially, delivery of the paper beyond settled areas was problematic, but the growth and development of the rural railway system in the early 1900s facilitated wider circulation.

=== Locations ===
[[File:Newspaper house gnangarra-10.jpg|thumb|upright|Clock on the former premises, Newspaper House, [[St Georges Terrace]]]]
Clock on the former premises, Newspaper House, St Georges Terrace
Newspaper House, the former office and publishing plant of The West on St Georges Terrace, across the road from the Palace Hotel, was a prominent landmark in the life of the city and state for over 50 years. It was vacated in the mid-1980s for the ill-fated "Westralia Square" redevelopment which was completed in 2012 under the name Brookfield Place. The editorial staff was temporarily relocated in a nearby office building. Recognised as part of an important heritage precinct,[21] Newspaper House was scheduled for preservation and refurbishment. In 1988, larger and more modern accommodation for the paper's printing presses was commissioned in Osborne Park.[22] Ten years later, the editorial operations also moved to the Osborne Park complex.

=== Acquisitions ===
In September 2015 the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] approved the acquisition of ''[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]]'', which would give Seven West Media a monopoly over major newspapers in the state.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-15/sunday-times-newspaper-and-perth-now-takeover-approved-by-accc/7845380 |title=Sunday Times sale to The ''West Australian'' owner Seven West Media receives ACCC approval |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=15 September 2016 |access-date=15 September 2016}}</ref> Finalisation of the deal, which includes the website [[PerthNow]], was announced by ''The West'' on 8 November 2016.<ref>"[https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/33125211/seven-wests-acquisition-of-sunday-times-gets-final-nod/#page1 SWM finalises purchase of The Sunday Times]". ''The West Australian'', 8 November 2016, page 3</ref> In May 2019, SWM acquired Community Newspaper Group, adding 13 titles to the newspaper suite in WA, and have since moved all of the community websites onto the PerthNow website.

=== Circulation and profits slump ===
''The West'' recorded a significant fall of nearly 25% in profit in June 2016. A serious drop in circulation was also reported with average weekday circulation down from 157,000 to 145,000, while the weekend edition averaged 241,000, down from 258,000. Cost-saving measures such as staff redundancies was attributed to the poor performance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-02/west-australian-paper-profits-fall-as-revenue,-circulation-drop/7681400|title=Profits plunge at The West Australian newspaper as circulation, advertising drop|date=2016-09-16|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|access-date=2018-12-31|language=en-US}}</ref>

In February 2005 former Australian Labor prime minister [[Bob Hawke]] labelled the paper "a disgrace to reasonable objective journalism".<ref>{{cite news|title=Bias grabs the headlines as state's media go to war|last=Price|first=Matt|authorlink=Matt Price|date=21 February 2005|page=4|work=[[The Australian]]}}</ref> Academic [[Peter van Onselen]] substantiated this attack, identifying 10 pro-Opposition front-page headlines in the lead-up to the [[2005 Western Australian state election|2005 state election]], but no pro-Government headlines.<ref>{{cite journal| url= https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/1619_pvo.pdf |title=Western Australia’s State Election: Democracy in Action?|last=van Onselen|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter van Onselen|journal=Democratic Audit of Australia|issue=February 2005|accessdate=31 December 2018}}</ref>

In May 2007, then [[attorney-general]] and health minister in the State Labor government, [[Jim McGinty]], described the newspaper as "the nation's most inaccurate and dishonest newspaper". He went on to attack the editor, Paul Armstrong, saying that "the board of West Australian Newspapers needs to sack the editor. It is personally driven by a particular individual". Armstrong responded by saying he "could not give a fat rat's arse" about Mr McGinty's comments and was then virulently attacked by premier [[Alan Carpenter]], whose government the paper continued to denigrate until its defeat at the [[2008 Western Australian state election|2008 election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,21747158-2761,00.html |title=Fire editor or 'no shield' |author=Chris Merritt |work=perthnow (news.com.au) |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=22 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718123322/http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,21747158-2761,00.html |archivedate=18 July 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.crikey.com.au/2007/05/22/paul-armstrong-the-wild-west-australian-under-attack/ | title = Paul Armstrong: the wild West Australian under attack | author = Margaret Simons | date = 22 May 2007 | work = [[Crikey]] | accessdate = 31 December 2018}}</ref>
