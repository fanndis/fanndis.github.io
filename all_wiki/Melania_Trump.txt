Five days before the election, she told a crowd of supporters in Pennsylvania: "Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers.

=== 2020 presidental campaign===
Although Melania was mostly silent about her husband Donald Trump's 2020 campaign she appeared in the late stage of the 2020 campaign. 3 weeks before the election she appeared for a brief time of 18 minutes in Atglen, Pennsylvania on October 27, 2020. She later spoke in Huntersville, North Carolina for almost 25 minutes on November the 2nd, one day before the [[2020 United States election]]. She also appeared a few times to introduce her husband before he took the stage to do his rally. On October 31st she said, "We have made great progress in our fight against COVID-19," the first lady said. "I watched Donald continue to work hard to keep people informed and calm, to protect our economy and make hard and unpopular decisions to do all he could to keep us all safe." She also criticised the media for being "biased" against her husband and his agenda as well as the democrats for trying to adavnce their agenda "against Americans' well being".
