'''Historically black colleges and universities''' ('''HBCUs''') are institutions of [[higher education in the United States]] that were established before the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with the intention of primarily serving the [[African-American]] community. Most of these institutions were founded in the years after the [[American Civil War]] and are concentrated in the [[Southern United States]].<ref>Anderson, J.D. (1988).

There are 101 HBCUs in the United States, including both public and private institutions (of 121 institutions that existed during the 1930s).<ref name="pewresearch.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/28/a-look-at-historically-black-colleges-and-universities-as-howard-turns-150/|title=A look at historically black colleges and universities as Howard turns 150|date=28 February 2017|website=Pewresearch.org|access-date=25 October 2017}}</ref>  Of these remaining HBCU institutions in the United States, 27 offer doctoral programs, 52 offer master's programs, 83 offer bachelor's degree programs, and 38 offer associate degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.american-school-search.com/colleges/hbcu|title=Historically Black Colleges and Universities – American School Search|website=American-school-search.com|access-date=25 October 2017}}</ref><ref>Marybeth Gasman, ''The Changing Face of Historically Black Colleges and Universities''.

==History==
[[File:1909 Cheyney Library.JPG|alt=|thumb|[[Cheyney University of Pennsylvania|Cheyney University]] founded in 1837 is the oldest HBCU.]]

===Private institutions===
Most HBCUs were established in the [[Southern United States|South]] after the [[American Civil War]], often with the assistance of religious missionary organizations based in the northern United States. HBCUs established prior to the American Civil War include [[Cheyney University of Pennsylvania]] in 1837 and [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in 1854. [[Wilberforce University]] was also established prior to the American Civil War; it was founded in 1856 via a collaboration between the African Methodist Episcopal Church of Ohio and the Methodist Episcopal Church (the latter a predominantly white denomination).<ref>Marybeth Gasman, has ''Envisioning Black Colleges: A History of the United Negro College Fund'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007).{{ISBN?}}</ref>

Exactly three months after the end of the Civil War, Atlanta University – now [[Clark Atlanta University]] – was founded on September 19, 1865, as the first HBCU in the Southern United States.  Atlanta University was the nation's first graduate institution to award degrees to African Americans in the nation and the first to award bachelors degrees to African Americans in the South; Clark College (1869) was the nation's first four-year liberal arts college to serve African-American students. The two consolidated in 1988 to form [[Clark Atlanta University]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Carrillo|first=Karen Juanita|date=2012|title=African American History Day By Day – A Reference Guide To Events|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=urVzCgAAQBAJ&q=atlanta+university+september+19+1865&pg=PA276|isbn=978-1598843613}}</ref>  [[Shaw University]], founded December 1, 1865, was the second HBCU to be established in the South.  The year 1865 also saw the foundation of [[Storer College]] (1865–1955) in [[Harper's Ferry, West Virginia]].<ref>Anderson,J.D. (1988). ''The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860–1935''. University of North Carolina Press.</ref> Storer's former campus and buildings have since been incorporated into [[Harpers Ferry National Historical Park]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Roy|first=Lisa|date=December 18, 2013|title=Storer College (1867-1956)|url=https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/storer-college-1867-1956/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-12-04|website=|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Public institutions===
In 1862,<ref>(7 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.)</ref> the federal government's [[Morrill Act]] provided for [[land grant college]]s in each state. Some educational institutions established under the Morrill Act in the [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Western United States|West]] were open to blacks. But 17 states, mostly in the South, required their systems to be segregated and generally excluded black students from their land grant colleges. In response, Congress passed the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts#Expansion|second Morrill Act of 1890]], also known as the [[Agricultural College Act of 1890]], requiring states to establish a separate land grant college for blacks if blacks were being excluded from the existing land grant college. Many of the HBCUs were founded by states to satisfy the Second Morrill Act. These land grant schools continue to receive annual federal funding for their research, [[Continuing education|extension]], and outreach activities.<ref name="auto1"/>

===Sports===
In the 1920s and 1930s, historically Black colleges developed a strong interest in athletics.  Sports were expanding rapidly at state universities, but very few black stars were recruited there.  Race newspapers hailed athletic success as a demonstration of racial progress.  Black schools hired coaches, recruited and featured stellar athletes, and set up their own leagues.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Patrick B. |title=To "Bring the Race along Rapidly": Sport, Student Culture, and Educational Mission at Historically Black Colleges during the Interwar Years |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=1995 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=111–33 |doi=10.2307/369629 |issn=0018-2680|jstor=369629 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=Miller |editor-first1=Patrick B |editor-last2=Wiggins |editor-first2=David Kenneth |title=Sport and the color line: black athletes and race relations in twentieth-century America |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0415946100 |language=en|oclc=53155353 }}</ref>

===Jewish refugees===
In the 1930s, many Jewish intellectuals fleeing Europe after the rise of [[Hitler]] and [[anti-Jewish legislation in prewar Nazi Germany]] following Hitler's elevation to power emigrated to the United States and found work teaching in historically black colleges.<ref name="AAR">{{Cite news |url=https://aaregistry.org/story/jewish-profs-and-hbcus/ |title=Jewish Prof's and HBCU's – African American Registry |work=African American Registry |access-date=2018-12-24 }}</ref><ref name="African American Registry">{{Cite news|url=https://aaregistry.org/story/jewish-profs-and-hbcus/|title=Jewish Prof's and HBCU's – African American Registry|work=African American Registry|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}</ref>  In particular, 1933 was a challenging year for many Jewish academics who tried to escape increasingly oppressive Nazi policies,<ref name="Hoch 217–246" /> particularly after legislation was passed stripping them of their positions at universities.<ref name="Hoch 217–246" /> Jews looking outside of Germany could not find work in other European countries because of calamities like the [[Spanish Civil War]] and general antisemitism in Europe.<ref name="timeline.com">{{cite web|last=Gilligan|first=Heather|date=10 February 2017|title=After fleeing the Nazis, many Jewish refugee professors found homes at historically black colleges|url=https://timeline.com/jewish-professors-black-colleges-9a61d4603771|access-date=6 December 2018|website=Timeline}}</ref><ref name="Hoch 217–246">{{Cite journal|last=Hoch|first=Paul K.|date=1983-05-11|title=The reception of central European refugee physicists of the 1930s: USSR, UK, US.|journal=Annals of Science|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=217–46|doi=10.1080/00033798300200211|issn=0003-3790}}</ref>  In the US, they hoped to continue their academic careers, but barring a scant few, found little acceptance in elite institutions in [[Great Depression in the United States|Depression-era America]], which also had their own undercurrent of [[Antisemitism in the United States|antisemitism]].<ref name="African American Registry" /><ref>Marybeth Gasman, “Scylla and Charybdis: Navigating the Waters of Academic Freedom at Fisk University during Charles S.

As a result of these phenomena, more than two-thirds of the faculty hired at many HBCUs from 1933 to 1945 had come to the United States to escape from Nazi Germany.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/blackcollegemyst0000will|url-access=registration|quote=jewish refugees teaching in black colleges.|title=The Black College Mystique|last1=Willie|first1=Charles Vert|last2=Reddick|first2=Richard J.|last3=Brown|first3=Ronald|date=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0742546172|language=en}}</ref>  HBCUs believed the Jewish professors were valuable faculty that would help strengthen their institutions' credibility.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=Lenoar|date=2001-11-11|title=The Not-So-Invisible Professors|journal=Urban Education|language=en|volume=36|issue=5|pages=611–29|doi=10.1177/0042085901365006|s2cid=145633996|issn=0042-0859}}</ref>HBCUs had a firm belief in diversity and giving opportunity no matter the race, religion, or country of origin.<ref name="auto">{{cite journal|title=To Set an Example: The Tradition of Diversity at Historically Black Colleges and Universities|first=Joseph O.|last=Jewell|date=1 January 2002|journal=Urban Education|volume=37|issue=1|pages=7–21|doi=10.1177/0042085902371002|s2cid=145115998}}</ref>  HBCUs were open to Jews because of their ideas of equal learning spaces.

===World War II===
HBCUs made great contributions to the US war effort. One example is [[Tuskegee University]] in Alabama, where the [[Tuskegee Airmen]] trained and attended classes.<ref name="jbhe">{{cite web |title=How HBCUs Contributed to the 1940s War Effort |url=https://www.jbhe.com/2012/07/how-hbcus-contributed-to-the-1940s-war-effort/ |date=July 12, 2012 |work=Journal of Blacks in Higher Education}}</ref><ref>Philo Hutcheson, Marybeth Gasman, and Kijua Sanders-McMurtry, “Race and Equality in the Academy: Rethinking Higher Education Actors and the Struggle for Equality in the Post-World War II Period,” ''Journal of Higher Education'' 82, no. 2 (2011): 121–53</ref>

===Florida's black junior colleges===
After the landmark ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision of 1954, the legislature of Florida, with support from various counties, started a series of eleven [[junior college]]s serving the African-American population. The purpose was to show that [[separate but equal]] education was working in Florida. Prior to this, there had been only one junior college in Florida serving African Americans, [[Booker T. Washington Junior College]], in Pensacola. The new ones, with their year of founding, are
* [[Gibbs Junior College]] (1957)
* [[Roosevelt Junior College]] (1958)
* [[Volusia County Junior College]] (1958)
* [[Hampton Junior College]] (1958)
* [[Rosenwald Junior College]] (1958)
* [[Suwannee River Junior College]] (1959)
* [[Carver Junior College]] (1960)
* [[Collier-Blocker Junior College]] (1960)
* [[Lincoln Junior College]] (1960)
* [[Jackson Junior College]] (1961)
* [[Johnson Junior College]] (1962)

The new junior colleges began as extensions of black high schools; they used the same facilities and often the same faculty. Some built their own buildings after a few years. After passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] mandating an end to school segregation, the colleges were all abruptly closed. Only a fraction of the students and faculty were able to transfer to the previously all-white junior colleges, where they found, at best, an indifferent reception.<ref>{{citation

===Since 1965===
[[File:President George H. W. Bush signs a new Executive Order on historically black colleges and universities.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] signs a new Executive Order on historically black colleges and universities in the [[White House Rose Garden]], April 1989]]
A reauthorization of the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]] established a program for direct federal grants to HBCUs, to support their academic, financial, and administrative capabilities.<ref>20 U.S.C. § 1062.</ref><ref>The Act, as amended, defines a "part B institution" as: "...any historically black college or university that was established before 1964, whose principal mission was, and is, the education of black Americans, and that is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association determined by the Secretary [of Education] to be a reliable authority as to the quality of training offered or is, according to such an agency or association, making reasonable progress toward accreditation." {{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/inits/list/whhbcu/edlite-index.html|title=HBCUs: A National Resource|work=White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities|author=U.S Department of Education|date=2008-01-15|access-date=2008-02-08|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513215748/http://www.ed.gov/about/inits/list/whhbcu/edlite-index.html|archive-date=2008-05-13}}<br />20 U.S.C. § 1061.</ref> Part B specifically provides for formula-based grants, calculated based on each institution's Pell grant eligible enrollment, graduation rate, and percentage of graduates who continue post baccalaureate education in fields where African Americans are underrepresented. Some colleges with a predominantly black student body are not classified as HBCUs because they were founded (or opened their doors to African Americans) after the implementation of the ''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]'' (1950) and ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) rulings by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] (the court decisions which outlawed [[racial segregation]] of public education facilities) and the Higher Education Act of 1965.

In 1980, [[Jimmy Carter]] signed an executive order to distribute adequate resources and funds to strengthen the nation's public and private HBCUs.  His executive order created the White House Initiative on historically black colleges and universities (WHIHBCU), which is a federally funded program that operates within the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sites.ed.gov/whhbcu/about-us/|title=About Us – White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities|website=Sites.ed.gov|access-date=24 August 2016}}</ref>  In 1989, [[George H. W. Bush]] continued Carter's pioneering spirit by signing Executive Order 12677, which created the presidential advisory board on HBCUs, to counsel the government and the secretary on the future development of these organizations.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gasman |first1=Marybeth |last2=Tudico |first2=Christopher L. |title=Historically Black Colleges and Universities: triumphs, troubles, and taboos |url=https://archive.org/details/historicallyblac00gasm_429 |url-access=limited |date=2008 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=978-0230617261 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historicallyblac00gasm_429/page/n14 4]–5 |edition=1st}}</ref>

Starting in 2001, directors of libraries of several HBCUs began discussions about ways to pool their resources and work collaboratively. In 2003, this partnership was formalized as the [[HBCU Library Alliance]], "a consortium that supports the collaboration of information professionals dedicated to providing an array of resources designed to strengthen historically black colleges and Universities and their constituents."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbculibraries.org/|title=HBCU Library Alliance|website=Hbuclibraries.org|date=2010-04-23|access-date=2010-05-15}}</ref>

In 2015, the Bipartisan Congressional Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) [[Caucus]] was established by U.S. Representatives [[Alma S. Adams]] and [[Bradley Byrne]]. The caucus advocates for HBCUs on [[United States Congress|Capitol Hill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://byrne.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/members-of-congress-launch-bipartisan-congressional-hbcu-caucus|title=Members of Congress Launch Bipartisan Congressional HBCU Caucus|date=28 April 2015|website=Byrne.house.gov|access-date=24 August 2016}}</ref> As of September 2019, there are 94 elected politicians as members of the caucus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/9/members-of-congress-convene-bipartisan-congressional-hbcu-conference-in-honor-of-national-hbcu-week|title=Members of Congress Convene Bipartisan Congressional HBCU Conference in Honor of National HBCU Week|website=Mark R. Warner}}</ref>

Every year, the U.S. Department of Education deems one week in the [[autumn|fall]] as "National HBCU Week".  During this week, several conferences and events are held in [[Washington, D.C.]] discussing and celebrating HBCUs, as well as recognize select scholars and alumni from the HBCU community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sites.ed.gov/whhbcu/hbcu-week-conference/2015-hbcu-week-conference/|title=2015 HBCU Week Conference – White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities|website=Sites.ed.gov|access-date=24 August 2016}}</ref>

==Current status==
In 2015, the share of black students attending HBCUs had dropped to 9% of the total number of black students enrolled in degree-granting institutions nationwide.  This figure is a decline from the 13% of black students that enrolled in an HBCU in the year 2000 and the 17% that enrolled in 1980.  This is a result of desegregation, rising incomes and increased access to financial aid, which has created more college options for black students.<ref name="pewresearch.org"/><ref>Marybeth Gasman & Thai-Huy Nguyen, ''Making Black Scientists: A Call to Action''. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2019).{{ISBN?}} </ref>

The percentages of bachelor's and master's degrees awarded to black students by HBCUs has decreased over time. HBCUs awarded 35% of the bachelor's degrees and 21% of the master's degrees earned by blacks in 1976–77, compared with the 14% and 6% respectively of bachelor's and master's degrees earned by blacks in 2014–15. Additionally, the percentage of black doctoral degree recipients who received their degrees from HBCUs was lower in 2014–15 (12%) than in 1976–77 (14%).<ref name="ed.gov">{{cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=667|title=The NCES Fast Facts Tool provides quick answers to many education questions (National Center for Education Statistics)|website=Nces.ed.gov|access-date=25 October 2017}}</ref><ref>Robert Nathenson, Andrés Castro Samayoa, & Marybeth Gasman, ''Moving Upward & Onward: Income Mobility and Historically Black Colleges and Universities'', New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers Center for Minority Serving Institutions, 2019.{{ISBN?}}</ref><ref>William Casey Boland, Marybeth Gasman, Andrés Castro Samayoa, and DeShaun Bennett, “The Effect of Enrolling in Minority Serving Institutions on Earnings Compared to Non-Minority Serving Institutions: A College Scorecard Analysis,” Research in Higher Education (2019). </ref>
[[File:Aggie fountain 2011X no students.jpg|thumb|235px|[[North Carolina A&T State University]] is the largest HBCU in the nation.]]

The number of total students enrolled at an HBCU rose by 32% between 1976 and 2015, from 223,000 to 293,000. In comparison, total enrollment in degree-granting institutions nationwide increased by 81%, from 11 million to 20 million, during the same period.<ref name="ed.gov"/>

Although HBCUs were originally founded to educate black students, their diversity has increased over time. In 2015, students who were either white, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, or Native American made up 22% of total enrollment at HBCUs, compared with 15% in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_313.20.asp?current=yes|title=Digest of Education Statistics, 2016|website=Nces.ed.gov|access-date=25 October 2017}}</ref>

In 2007, the [[Thurgood Marshall College Fund]] published a study of minority recruiting practices by Fortune 400 companies and by government agencies that found that 13% of minority college graduates were recruited from HBCUs while 87% of minority college students were recruited from non-HBCU institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thurgoodmarshallfund.net/v1/images/pdf/hbcurecruitmentstudy.pdf|title=How Corporations and Government Recruit Talent From Historically Black Colleges and Universities|year=2007|work=Thurgood Marshall College Fund|access-date=2010-01-24}}</ref>

In 2006, the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] released a study showing that HBCUs had a $10.2 billion positive impact on the nation's economy with 35% coming from the [[multiplier effect]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2007/2007178.pdf|title=Economic Impact of the Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities|website=Nces.ed.gov|access-date=2017-01-21}}</ref>

===Racial diversity post-2000===
Following the enactment of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights laws]] in the 1960s, many educational institutions in the United States that receive federal funding have undertaken [[affirmative action]] to increase their racial diversity. Some historically black colleges and universities now have non-black majorities, including [[West Virginia State University]] and [[Bluefield State College]], whose student bodies have had large [[White Americans|white]] majorities since the mid-1960s.<ref name="pewresearch.org"/><ref>Robert Palmer, Robert Shorette, and Marybeth Gasman (Eds.), ''Exploring Diversity at Historically Black Colleges and Universities: Implications for Policy and Practice'', (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2014).{{ISBN?}}</ref><ref>Marybeth Gasman and Felecia Commodore (Eds.), ''Opportunities and Challenges at Historically Black Colleges and Universities'' (New York: Palgrave Press, 2014).{{ISBN?}}</ref>

Because many HBCUs have made a concerted effort to maintain enrollment levels and because they often offer relatively affordable tuition, the percentage of non–African-American enrollment has risen.<ref>[http://newsone.com/797215/more-non-black-students-attending-hbcus/ "More Non-Black Students Attending HBCUs"].
