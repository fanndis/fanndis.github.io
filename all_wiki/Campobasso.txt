'''Campobasso''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|k|æ|m|p|oʊ|ˈ|b|æ|s|oʊ}},<ref>{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|Campobasso|accessdate=28 July 2019}}</ref> {{IPA-it|ˌkampoˈbasso|lang|It-Campobasso.ogg}}; {{lang-nap|label=[[Molisan|Campobassan]]|Cambuàsce}} {{IPA-nap|ˌkambuˈwaʃʃə|}}) is a city and ''[[comune]]'' in [[southern Italy]], the capital of the region of [[Molise]] and of the [[province of Campobasso]]. It is located in the high basin of the [[Biferno]] river, surrounded by [[Sannio]] and [[Matese]] mountains.

Campobasso is renowned for the craftsmanship of [[blade]]s (including [[scissor]]s and [[knife|knives]]), a fact well documented since the 14th century. It is also famous for the production of [[pear]]s and [[scamorza]] (cheese). The city is the home of the [[University of Molise]] and of the [[Archdiocese of Campobasso-Boiano]].

==History==
[[File:Campobasso Campanile S. Bartolomeo.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Bell tower of the S. Bartolomeo Church in the Medieval centre of Campobasso.]]
The origins of Campobasso are disputed. According to the most widely held theory, the city was founded by the [[Lombards]] before the 8th century as a fortified camp on the slope of the hill where the castle stands.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  The original name was ''Campus vassorum'', suggesting that the city was the seat of the [[vassal]]s of the duke of [[Duchy of Spoleto|Spoleto]].

After the [[Norman conquest of Southern Italy]], Campobasso lost its importance as a defensive stronghold, but became a significant trading and administration centre.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

From 1330 to 1745 the city was ruled by the Monforte-Gambatesa family, who built the castle and established a mint. Later it came under the control of the Di Capua, [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]], Vitagliano, [[House of Carafa|Carafa]] and Romano families.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The original old town of Campobasso contains the [[Castello Monforte]], although in 1732 the inhabitants built a new town on a lower-level plain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/91400/Campobasso|title=Campobasso|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref>
In 1763 the citizens abandoned the old city and settled in the lower valley. The current city was expanded in 1814 by the king of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] [[Joachim Murat]], and lies on the ''Campo Basso'' ("Low field").{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Campobasso was the scene of heavy fighting during the [[Second World War]]. In the months of October and November 1943 a battle between the German and the Canadian troops for possession of the city caused the destruction of many public buildings, including the City Hall and the archives held there.  Thirty eight civilians were killed in the action, including the bishop of the diocese, Bishop Secondo Bologna, and an unknown number of people were injured in the intensive bombardment.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  The occupation by the Canadian troops, and the administrative and political control resulting, had such an impact on the town that it became known as "Canada Town" or "Maple Leaf City".<ref>[[Nicholson, G.W.L.]] ''The Gunners of Canada'' Vol. II. Beauceville: Imprimerie L'Éclaireur, 1972. p 162.</ref>

In 1995 the city was awarded the Bronze Medal for Civil Valour in recognition of the hard work done in clearing the region of dangerous unexploded warheads, a task that lasted well into 1948.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Main sights==
One of the mains attractions of Campobasso is the ''Castello Monforte'', built in 1450 by the local ruler Nicola II Monforte, over Lombard or Norman ruins.  The castle has [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] [[merlon]]s and stands on a commanding point, where traces of ancient settlements (including [[Samnium|Samnite]] walls) have been found. The current construction is the result of later rebuilding after the earthquakes of 1456 and 1805.

Next to the castle is the ''Chiesa della Madonna del Monte'' (Santa Maria Maggiore), erected in the 11th century and rebuilt in 1525. It houses a precious wooden statue of the ''Incoronata'' from 1334. Below the castle, the church of St. George is probably the oldest in Campobasso, built around the year 1000 AD over the ruins of a Pagan temple.

The Cathedral, or ''Chiesa della Santissima Trinità'' (Church of the Holy Trinity), was built in 1504 outside the city walls. It was destroyed by [[1805 Molise earthquake|an earthquake in 1805]] and a new [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] edifice was built in 1829.

The church of ''San Bartolomeo'' is a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building from the 11th century, in limestone. The interior has a nave and two aisles.

''San Leonardo'' (14th century) has a façade mixing Gothic and Romanesque elements, and a side mullioned window with vegetable decorations influenced by the Apulian architecture of the period.

''Villa de Capoa'', recently restored, is a noteworthy garden with statues and a wide variety of plant species, including [[Sequoia sempervirens|sequoia]]s, [[Norway Spruce]]s, [[cupressus|cypresses]] and [[Lebanon Cedar]]s.
