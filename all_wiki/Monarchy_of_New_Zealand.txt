Elizabeth's eldest son, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], is [[heir apparent]].

The [[Treaty of Waitangi]] between [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Māori people|Māori]] was signed in 1840, and as a result, the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British sovereign]] became New Zealand's head of state. New Zealand gradually became [[Independence of New Zealand|independent from Britain]] and the monarchy evolved to become a distinctly New Zealand institution, represented by [[#Symbols|unique symbols]]. The person who is the New Zealand monarch is today shared with [[Commonwealth realm|15 other countries]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], all being independent and the monarchy of each legally distinct. As a result, the current monarch is [[List of titles and honours of Elizabeth II|officially titled]] ''Queen of New Zealand'' ({{lang-mi|Kuini o Aotearoa}}) and, in this capacity, she, her [[Prince consort|consort]],<!--Changes to queen/princess consort if monarch is male--> and other members of the [[Commonwealth realm#Royal family|royal family]] undertake various public and private functions across New Zealand and on behalf of the country abroad. However, the Queen is the only member of the royal family with any constitutional role.

All [[executive (government)|executive]] authority is vested in the monarch, and [[royal assent]] is required for [[New Zealand Parliament|parliament]] to enact laws and for [[letters patent]] and [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] to have legal effect. However, the monarch's authority is subject to the [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|conventional]] stipulations of [[constitutional monarchy]], and her direct participation in these areas of governance is limited.<ref name=CO3>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2017| p=3}}</ref> Most of the related powers are instead exercised by the elected [[members of parliament]], the [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]] generally drawn from amongst them, and the [[Judiciary of New Zealand|judges]] and [[Justice of the peace#New Zealand|justices of the peace]]. Other powers vested in the monarch, such as the appointment of a [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]], are significant, but are treated only as [[reserve power]]s and as an important security part of the role of the monarchy.

Since the monarch resides in the United Kingdom, most of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties within the [[Realm of New Zealand]] are typically carried out by a [[viceroy|viceregal]] representative, the [[governor-general of New Zealand]].<ref>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2017| p=7}}</ref>

The role of the monarchy is a recurring topic of public discussion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Changing attitudes to monarchy|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/queen-elizabeth-jubilee/changing-attitudes-to-monarchy|work=NZ History|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|access-date=24 February 2018}}</ref> Some New Zealanders think New Zealand should [[Republicanism in New Zealand|become a republic]] with a New Zealand resident as the head of state, while others wish to retain the monarchy.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Cook |first1=Megan |title=Royal family |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/royal-family |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |access-date=7 August 2019 |date=20 June 2012}}</ref>

===Title===
{{Further|List of titles and honours of Elizabeth II}}
One of the first post-[[Second World War]] examples of New Zealand's status as an independent monarchy was the alteration of the monarch's title by the [[Royal Titles Act 1953]]. For the first time, the official New Zealand title mentioned New Zealand separately from the United Kingdom and the other realms, to highlight the monarch's role specifically as Queen of New Zealand, as well as the shared aspect of the Crown throughout the realms; the title at that time was ''Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Her Other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith''. Since the passage of the [[Royal Titles Act 1974]], the monarch's title in New Zealand has been ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God Queen of New Zealand and Her Other Realms and Territories, [[Head of the Commonwealth]], [[Defender of the Faith]]''.<ref name="Peaslee1985">{{cite book|last1=Peaslee|first1=Amos J.|title=Constitutions of Nations|date=1985|publisher=Nijhoff.|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9789024729050|page=882|edition=Rev. 4th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1YDkjh7p-xYC&pg=PA882|access-date=2 September 2016}}</ref>

Although the Queen's New Zealand title includes the phrase 'Defender of the Faith', neither the Queen nor the governor-general has any religious role in New Zealand; there has never been an [[established church]] in the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ahdar|first1=Rex|title=Religion and the State in New Zealand|date=2014|pages=569–571|url=https://www.religlaw.org/content/blurb/files/New%20Zealand%202014.pdf|access-date=17 February 2018|quote=New Zealand has never had an established church.}}</ref> This is one of the key differences from the Queen's role in [[England]], where she is [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]].<ref name="religion">{{cite web |title=The Queen, the Church and other faiths |url=https://www.royal.uk/queens-relationship-churches-england-and-scotland-and-other-faiths |publisher=The Royal Household |access-date=18 January 2019 |language=en |date=7 January 2016}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|When in New Zealand, the Queen has attended [[Anglican]] church services,<ref>{{cite web |title=Picture Gallery: Queen tours New Zealand |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1838939.stm |work=BBC News |access-date=21 January 2019 |date=24 February 2002}}</ref> but she has no official role in the [[Anglican Church in New Zealand]].|group=n}}

===Succession and regency===
{{Further|Succession to the New Zealand throne}}
[[File:Prince Charles in NZ.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles, Prince of Wales]], (pictured in New Zealand, 2015) is the [[heir apparent]] to the throne.]]
Succession is, for persons born before 28 October 2011, governed by [[male-preference cognatic primogeniture]] and, for those born after 28 October 2011, by [[absolute primogeniture]]—wherein succession passes to an individual's children according to birth order, regardless of gender.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607 |title=Girls equal in British throne succession |work=BBC News |date=28 October 2011}}</ref> The succession is governed by the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], [[Bill of Rights 1689]], and [[Royal Succession Act 2013]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Succession Act 2013|url=http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2013/0149/latest/DLM5025816.html|website=New Zealand Legislation|publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)]]|access-date=12 July 2014}}</ref> legislation that also limits the succession to the biological, legitimate descendants of [[Sophia of Hanover]], and stipulates that the monarch cannot be a Roman Catholic and must be in communion with the [[Church of England]] upon ascending the throne. Though, via [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947|adopting the Statute of Westminster]] (later repealed in New Zealand) and the [[Imperial Laws Application Act 1988]], these constitutional documents as they apply to New Zealand now lie within the full control of the [[New Zealand Parliament]],<ref name=CO2>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2017| p=2}}</ref> New Zealand also agreed not to change its rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship; a situation that applies [[Symmetry|symmetrically]] in all the other realms, including the United Kingdom, and has been likened to a [[treaty]] amongst these countries.<ref name=ODonohue>{{cite court| litigants=Tony O'Donohue v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada| vol=41404 (ON S.C.)| pinpoint=S.33| court=Ontario Superior Court of Justice| year=2003| url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii41404/2003canlii41404.html| accessdate=16 May 2009}}</ref> Thus, New Zealand's line of succession remains identical to that of the United Kingdom. As such, the rules for succession are not fixed, but may be changed by a constitutional amendment. The Constitution Act 1986 specifies that should a [[regent]] be installed in the United Kingdom, that individual will carry out the functions of the monarch of New Zealand.<ref>{{Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 1986| loc=4.1}}</ref>

Upon a [[demise of the Crown]] (the death or [[abdication]] of a monarch), the late sovereign's heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without any need for confirmation or further ceremony—hence arises the phrase "[[The King is dead. Long live the King!]]" It is customary, though, for the accession of the new monarch to be publicly [[Proclamation|proclaimed]] by the governor-general on behalf of the [[Executive Council of New Zealand]]. Following an appropriate period of [[mourning]], the monarch is also [[coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] in the United Kingdom in an ancient ritual, but one not necessary for a sovereign to reign.{{#tag:ref|For example, [[Edward VIII]] was never crowned, yet was undoubtedly king during his short time on the throne.|group=n|name=EdVIII1}} Other than a transfer of all royal powers and functions to the new monarch from his or her predecessor, no other law or office is affected, as all references in legislation to previous monarchs, whether in the masculine (e.g. "His Majesty") or feminine (e.g. "the Queen"), continue to mean the reigning sovereign of New Zealand.<ref name=EIIR35.1>{{Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 1986| loc=5.1–2}}</ref> After an individual ascends the throne, he or she typically continues to reign until death, being unable to unilaterally abdicate.{{#tag:ref|The only New Zealand monarch to abdicate, Edward VIII, did so with the authorisation of the New Zealand government granted in [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]] (UK).|group=n|name=EdVIII2}}

===Finances===
The sovereign only draws from New Zealand funds for support in the performance of her duties when in New Zealand or acting as Queen of New Zealand abroad; New Zealanders do not pay any money to the Queen or any other member of the royal family, either towards personal income or to support royal residences outside of New Zealand. Normally, tax dollars pay only for the costs associated with the governor-general as instruments of the Queen's authority, including travel, security, residences, offices, ceremonies, and the like. Supporters of the monarchy argue it costs New Zealand taxpayers only a small outlay for royal engagements and tours and the expenses of the governor-general's establishment. [[Monarchy New Zealand]] states "[t]his figure is about one dollar per person per year", about $4.3 million per annum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monarchy.org.nz/cost.html|title=Cost of the Monarchy|publisher=[[Monarchy New Zealand]]|year=2009|access-date=2010-10-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204044924/http://www.monarchy.org.nz/cost.html|archive-date=4 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> An analysis by [[New Zealand Republic]] (a republican advocacy group) of the 2010 budget claimed the office of governor-general costs New Zealand taxpayers about $7.6 million in ongoing costs and $11 million for [[Government House, Wellington|Government House]] upgrades,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/2010/estimates/est10pmcab.pdf|title=Vote Prime Minister and Cabinet|publisher=[[New Zealand Treasury]]|pages=269–270|date=May 2010|access-date=2010-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526014733/http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/2010/estimates/est10pmcab.pdf|archive-date=26 May 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.nz/defendingthemonarchy#cost|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501025508/http://www.republic.org.nz/defendingthemonarchy#cost|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-05-01|title=Defending the monarchy – the cost|publisher=New Zealand Republic|year=2010|access-date=2010-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1005/S00221.htm|title=Governor-General more expensive|date=20 May 2010|publisher=[[Scoop.co.nz]]|author=New Zealand Republic}}</ref> figures Monarchy New Zealand claimed had been "arbitrarily inflated" by New Zealand Republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monarchy.org.nz/images/documents/press/28%20October%202010.pdf|title=Monarchy New Zealand Calls for the Resignation of Republican Chair|date=28 October 2010|access-date=15 November 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722215545/http://www.monarchy.org.nz/images/documents/press/28%20October%202010.pdf|archive-date=22 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Constitutional role==
[[Constitution of New Zealand|New Zealand's constitution]] is made up of a variety of [[Lists of Statutes of New Zealand|statutes]] and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|conventions]] that are either British or New Zealand in origin,<ref name="constofnz"/><ref name=CO2 /> and together give New Zealand a [[parliamentary system]] of government wherein the role of the Queen is both legal and practical. The Crown is regarded as a [[corporation sole]],<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20 |author=George V |title=Law of Property Act 1925 |location=London |publisher=Queen's Printer |date=9 April 1925 |section=s. 180}}</ref> with the sovereign, in the position of head of state,<ref name=EIIR2.1 /> as the centre of a construct in which the power of the whole is shared by multiple institutions of government acting under the sovereign's authority.<ref name=Murdoch>{{cite journal| last=Cox| first=Noel| title=Black v Chrétien: Suing a Minister of the Crown for Abuse of Power, Misfeasance in Public Office and Negligence| journal=Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law| volume=9| issue=3| page=12| publisher=Murdoch University| location=Perth| date=September 2002| url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v9n3/cox93.html| access-date=17 May 2009}}</ref>

The vast powers that belong to the Crown are collectively known as the [[Royal Prerogative]],<ref name=CO8 /> the exercise of which does not require parliamentary approval, though it is not unlimited; for example, the monarch does not have the prerogative to impose and collect new taxes without the authorisation of an [[Act of Parliament]].<ref name="constofnz"/> The consent of the Crown must, however, be obtained before parliament may even debate a bill affecting the sovereign's prerogatives or interests, and no Act of Parliament binds the Queen or her rights unless the Act expressly provides that it does.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Joseph |first1=Philip A. |title=Constitutional and Administrative Law in New Zealand |date=2014 |publisher=Thomson Reuters |pages=669–674 |edition=4th}}</ref>

===Executive===
The [[New Zealand Government]] (formally termed ''[[Her Majesty's Government (term)|Her Majesty's Government]]''<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Elizabeth II]]|title=Seal of New Zealand Act 1977|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1977/0001/latest/whole.html?|publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref>) is defined by the Constitution Act as the monarch acting on the [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the [[Executive Council of New Zealand|Executive Council]].<ref>{{Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 1986| loc=3A.1}}</ref> One of the main duties of the Crown is to ensure that a democratic government is always in place, which means appointing a prime minister to thereafter head the [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet]], a committee of the Executive Council charged with advising the Crown on the exercise of the Royal Prerogative,<ref>{{Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 1983| loc=VII}}</ref> and legally required to keep the governor-general up to date on state affairs.<ref name=CO9>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2017| p=9}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb| Elizabeth II| 1983| loc=XVI}}</ref>
[[File:New-govt-2017.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Executive Councillors with Governor-General [[Patsy Reddy|Dame Patsy Reddy]] (front, centre), 26 October 2017]]

In the construct of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[responsible government]], the ministerial advice tendered is typically binding, meaning the monarch ''reigns'' but does not ''rule''.<ref>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2017| p=14}}</ref> However, the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown and not to any of the ministers,<ref name=Murdoch /> and the royal and viceregal figures may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional [[constitutional crisis]] situations,<ref name=Murdoch /><ref name=CO9 /><ref name=GGRole>{{cite web| url=http://www.gg.govt.nz/role/index.htm| last=Office of the Governor-General of New Zealand| author-link=Governor-General of New Zealand| title=Role & Functions > The Constitutional Role of the Head of State| publisher=Government House| access-date=26 March 2019}}</ref> thereby allowing the monarch to make sure that the Government conducts itself in compliance with the constitution. There are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by, or bills that require assent by, the Queen; these include applying the [[royal sign-manual]] and [[Seal of New Zealand]] to the appointment papers of governors-general, the confirmation of awards of [[New Zealand royal honours]],<ref name="CO3"/> and the approval of any change in her New Zealand title.

====Foreign affairs====
The Royal Prerogative also extends to foreign affairs: the sovereign or the governor-general conducts [[treaty|treaties]], alliances and international agreements on the advice of the Cabinet.<ref>{{harvnb|Barnett|2017| p=103}}</ref> The governor-general, on behalf of the Queen, also accredits New Zealand high commissioners and ambassadors, and receives similar diplomats from foreign states. The [[Letter of credence|letters of credence and recall]] were formerly issued by the monarch, but now are issued in the name of the incumbent governor-general (instead of following the usual international process of the letters being from one head of state to another). The issuance of passports falls under the Royal Prerogative, and, as such, all [[New Zealand passport]]s are issued in the monarch's name and remain her property.<ref>{{harvnb|Barnett|2017| p=106}}</ref>

===Parliament===

The sovereign is one of the two components of the [[New Zealand Parliament]].<ref name=GGRole /> The monarch and governor-general do not, however, participate in the [[legislative]] process save for the granting of [[Royal Assent]], which is necessary for a bill to be enacted as law; either figure or a delegate may perform this task; this is now a matter of convention. The Crown is further responsible for summoning and [[dissolution of Parliament|dissolving]] the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]],<ref>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2017| p=75}}</ref> after which the governor-general usually [[Writ of election|calls for a general election]].

Despite the sovereign's exclusion, members of parliament must still express their loyalty to her and defer to her authority, as the [[Oath of Allegiance (New Zealand)|Oath of Allegiance]] must be recited by all new parliamentarians before they may take their seat.<ref name="oath" /> Further, the [[Official Opposition (New Zealand)|official opposition]] is traditionally dubbed as ''[[Loyal opposition|Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=The relevance of Parliament|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/office-of-the-speaker/speeches-pre-2013/document/47Speakspeech110520051/the-relevance-of-parliament|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|access-date=16 February 2018|date=11 May 2005}}</ref> illustrating that, while its members are opposed to the incumbent government, they remain loyal to the sovereign (as personification of the state and its authority).<ref>{{citation |last=Schmitz |first=Gerald |title=The Opposition in a Parliamentary System |place=Ottawa |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |date=December 1988 |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/bp47-e.htm |access-date=28 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321080112/http://www2.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/bp47-e.htm |archive-date=21 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Mulgan |first1=R.

===Courts===
The sovereign is responsible for rendering justice for all her subjects, and is thus traditionally deemed the ''fount of justice''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fount of Justice|url=http://www.monarchist.org.uk/fount-of-justice.html|publisher=British Monarchist League|access-date=31 August 2016}}</ref> However, she does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead the judicial functions of the Royal Prerogative are performed in trust and in the Queen's name by judges and justices of the peace. The [[Sovereign immunity|monarch is immune from criminal prosecution]], the notion in common law being that the sovereign "can do no wrong";<ref>{{cite book |title=The New Zealand Law Journal |publisher=Butterworths of New Zealand |date=1994 |page=53}}</ref> the monarch cannot be prosecuted in her own courts for criminal offences. The monarch, and by extension the governor-general, also grants immunity from prosecution, exercises the ''[[royal prerogative of mercy]]'',<ref name=CO8 /> and may pardon offences against the Crown, either before, during, or after a trial.

===The Crown and the Defence Force===

The Crown also sits at the pinnacle of the [[New Zealand Defence Force]]. The governor-general is [[commander-in-chief]] and under the [[Defence Act 1990]] is authorised to "raise and maintain armed forces",<ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| date=1 April 1990| title=Defence Act 1990| series=5, 6.1| location=Wellington| publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]]| url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0028/latest/whole.html?search=qs_act_new+zealand+defence+force_resel&p=1#dlm204973| access-date=1 January 2010| ref=CITEREF_Elizabeth_II_1990}}</ref> consisting of the [[New Zealand Army]], [[Royal New Zealand Navy]], and [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]].

[[File:Queen Elizabeth II wearing a korowai, 1954.jpg|thumb|upright|Queen Elizabeth II wore a ''korowai'' (woven Māori cloak) during her first tour of New Zealand in 1953–54.]]
[[Māori people|Māori]] interaction with the Crown dates back to 1832, when King [[William IV of the United Kingdom]] appointed [[James Busby]] as [[British Resident]], to address concerns on the part of Māori in the [[Bay of Islands]] over expanding European settlements in that area. On 28 October 1835, Busby oversaw a ''[[Hui (Māori assembly)|hui]]'' (forum) held at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]], at which a flag was selected for New Zealand and [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand|a declaration of independence]] written by Busby was signed by 36 Māori [[Rangatira|chiefs]]; both were acknowledged the following year by the King in a letter from [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg|Lord Glenelg]].<ref>{{Citation| last=The Lord Glenelg| author-link=Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg| date=25 May 1836| contribution=EXTRACT of a DESPATCH from Lord GLENELG to Major-General Sir RICHARD BOURKE, New South Wales| title=Documents > Declaration of Independence| place=London| publication-place=Christchurch| publisher=Waitangi Associates| url=http://www.waitangi.co.nz/declarationindependence.htm#Extract| access-date=11 January 2010}}</ref>

As a result, the declaration's ratification by the British Parliament in 1836, officials in the Colonial Office determined in 1839 that a treaty of cessation would need to be signed with Māori for the British Crown to acquire sovereignty over New Zealand.<ref>{{cite book |last=Orange |first=Claudia |author-link=Claudia Orange |title=An Illustrated History of the Treaty of Waitangi |year=2004 |publisher=Bridget Williams Books |location=Wellington |isbn=978-1-877242-16-8 |page=42}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was signed in 1840 by representatives of the British Crown and over 500 Māori chiefs,<ref name="Mallenby2002">{{cite book|last1=Mallenby|first1=Patricia E.A.|last2=Mallenby|first2=Jeremy T.T.|title=Essays in World History: An Undergraduate Perspective|date=2002|publisher=First Choice Books|location=Victoria, B.C.|isbn=9780978059316|pages=314–215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S9qOdk1499YC&pg=PA315}}</ref> and is considered the founding document of the nation.<ref>{{Harvnb| Cabinet Office| 2017| p=1}}</ref> The Treaty identifies the Crown's right to ''[[kawanatanga]]'', or "governorship", leading one Māori academic to argue that ''kawanatanga'', or Her Majesty's Government in New Zealand, is party to the treaty.<ref>{{Citation| last=Jackson| first=Moana| author-link=Moana Jackson| date=1996| editor-last=Trainor| editor-first=Luke| title=Republicanism in New Zealand| page=119| location=Palmerston North| publisher=Dunmore Press| isbn=978-0-86469-256-6}}</ref>

Since the treaty's implementation, a number of petitions have been made by Māori directly to the sovereign in London, whom they felt they had a special relationship, the first coming from northern chiefs in 1852. This and all subsequent appeals were directed back to the sovereign's New Zealand ministers for advice on how to proceed.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/node/2150| last=History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage| title=Politics and government > Maori leadership > Maori King movement – 1860–94 > Normalising relations| publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage (New Zealand)]]| access-date=2 January 2010}}</ref> The results were not always favourable to Māori, who have communicated their discontent to the monarch or other royals; in response to a refusal by the Executive Council in 1981 to allow [[Mana Motuhake]] direct access to the Queen, Māori activist [[Dun Mihaka]] offered a traditional rebuke by baring his buttocks at the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess of Wales]].

In the [[Māori language]], the Queen is sometimes referred to as ''te kōtuku-rerenga-tahi'', meaning "the [[Great Egret|white heron]] of a single flight"; in Māori proverb, the rare white heron is a significant bird seen only once in a lifetime.<ref name=Buck2 /> In 1953, for [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|her coronation]], Elizabeth was given a kiwi feather [[korowai cloak]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/NewZealand/Symbolsandceremonies.aspx| last=Royal Household| title=The Queen and the Commonwealth > Queen and New Zealand > Symbols and ceremonies| publisher=Queen's Printer| access-date=2 January 2010}}</ref> which she wears when attending a ''[[pōwhiri]]'', or Māori welcoming ceremony, also speaking partly in Māori.<ref name=NZRV/>

==Cultural role==

===Royal presence and duties===
{{See also|List of Commonwealth visits made by Elizabeth II}}
Members of the royal family have been present in New Zealand since the late 1800s, their reasons including participating in military manoeuvres or undertaking official royal tours.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Duke of Edinburgh, 1869–71|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/royal-visits/page-2|publisher=[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]|date=1966|access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref><ref name="Royal tours">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Cook|first=Megan|title=Royal family - Royal tours|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/royal-family/page-2|encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=25 April 2017|date=20 June 2012|language=en}}</ref> Usually important milestones, anniversaries, or celebrations of [[Culture of New Zealand|New Zealand culture]] will warrant the presence of the monarch, while other royals will be asked to participate in lesser occasions. ''Official duties'' involve the sovereign representing the New Zealand state at home or abroad, or her relations as members of the royal family participating in government organised ceremonies either in New Zealand or elsewhere.{{#tag:ref|Though the royal family represents other countries abroad, as directed by their respective cabinets, and typically the governor-general will undertake [[state visit]]s and other foreign duties on behalf of the monarch of New Zealand,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gg.govt.nz/role/functions.htm| last=Office of the Governor-General of New Zealand| author-link=Governor-General of New Zealand| title=Role & Functions " The Governor-General's Three Roles| publisher=Government House| access-date=26 March 2019}}</ref> members of the royal family will also take part in New Zealand events overseas.

Such events have included centennials and bicentennials; [[Waitangi Day]]; the openings of [[Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth]] and other games; anniversaries of Māori treaty signings; awards ceremonies; anniversaries of the monarch's accession; and the like.

===Symbols===
References to the monarchy are commonplace in public life in New Zealand and represent one of the most recognisable ways the head of state is incorporated into New Zealand's [[national identity]]. Royal symbols may specifically distinguish institutions that derive their authority from the Crown (such as parliament), establishments with royal associations, or merely be ways of expressing loyal or patriotic sentiment.

[[File:New Zealand shilling coin, 1933, featuring a profile of King George V.png|thumb|left|New Zealand [[shilling]] coin, 1933, featuring a profile of King George V on the [[obverse]]]]
The main symbol of the monarchy is the sovereign herself—her portrait, for instance, {{As of|2018|alt=currently}} appears on all [[Coins of the New Zealand dollar|coins]], the [[New Zealand twenty-dollar note|twenty-dollar banknote]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Wilson |first1=John |title=Nation and government - System of government |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/nation-and-government/page-4 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=29 October 2018 |date=16 September 2016|quote=The Queen’s portrait appears on New Zealand’s banknotes and coins (though no longer on most issues of postage stamps).}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Pollock |first1=Kerryn |title=Coins and banknotes - Decimal currency, 1960s to 2000s |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/coins-and-banknotes/page-3 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=29 October 2018 |date=20 June 2012}}</ref> and [[Postage stamps of New Zealand|postage stamps]] such as the Queen Elizabeth II definitive stamp.<ref>{{cite web |title=Queen Elizabeth II |url=https://stamps.nzpost.co.nz/new-zealand/1977/queen-elizabeth-ii |publisher=[[New Zealand Post]] |access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref> There are references to [[St Edward's Crown]], on [[Coat of arms of New Zealand|New Zealand's coat of arms]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Coat of Arms |url=https://mch.govt.nz/nz-identity-heritage/coat-arms |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |access-date=29 October 2018 |quote=St Edward's Crown, shown above the shield, was used in the Coronation ceremony of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

[[File:Royal Standard of New Zealand.svg|thumb|right|[[Queen's Personal Flag for New Zealand|Queen Elizabeth II's personal flag for New Zealand]], used solely by her in her capacity as Queen of New Zealand]]
Similar to coats of arms, flags are utilised to represent royal authority. A [[Queen's Personal Flag for New Zealand|personal flag]] for use by the Queen in New Zealand was adopted in 1962.<ref name="flag1">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Pollock|first=Kerryn|title=Flags|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/flags/page-3|encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=20 April 2016|access-date=2 September 2016}}</ref> It features the shield design of the New Zealand coat of arms in the form of an oblong or square. Superimposed in the centre is a dark blue roundel bearing an initial 'E' surmounted by a crown, all within a gold chaplet of roses.<ref name="flag1" />

Music and song are utilised in various ways as reminders and identifiers of the sovereign. New Zealand inherited the anthem "[[God Save the Queen]]" (or, alternatively, "God Save the King") from Britain.<ref name="nationalanthem">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Swarbrick|first=Nancy|title=National anthems|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/national-anthems/page-1|encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=20 June 2012|access-date=2 September 2016}}</ref> It remains one of the [[national anthems of New Zealand|two national anthems]], along with "[[God Defend New Zealand]]", but has been generally restricted to Anzac Day services and official occasions where the monarch, a member of the royal family, or the governor-general is being either honoured or in attendance for a particular purpose.<ref name="nationalanthem" />

===Organisations with royal patronage===
{{See also|List of New Zealand organisations with royal patronage}}
To receive [[patronage]], an organisation must prove to be long lasting, and to be of the highest standard in their field. These organisations, such as the [[Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association]], signified by the prefix ''royal'', have received patronage from various monarchs and their families. Royal patronage is the royal individual's decision to make, though the [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] will help organisations to seek patronage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Use of the word "Royal" guidelines {{!}} Ministry for Culture and Heritage|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/nz-identity-heritage/royal-guidelines/use-word-royal-guidelines|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|access-date=7 September 2016}}</ref>

==Debate==
{{See also|Republicanism in New Zealand}}
Despite a similar level of political involvement by the monarchy in both countries, there is less agitation for ending the monarchy of New Zealand and creating a [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand republic]] than in neighbouring Australia, where the republicanism movement is stronger. Past public opinion polls have shown that while the majority of Australians are in favour of a republic, New Zealanders on average favour retaining the monarchy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kullmann|first=Claudio|date=November 2008|title=Attitudes towards the Monarchy in Australia and New Zealand Compared|journal=Commonwealth & Comparative Politics|volume=46|issue=4|pages=442–463|doi=10.1080/14662040802461125|s2cid=144715921}}</ref> Supporters of the monarchy claim that for New Zealand, "...monarchy summarises the inheritance of a thousand years of constitutional government and our links with a glorious past".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/mar/09/monarchy.tobymanhire|title=What the New Zealand press said about ......

Neither [[New Zealand National Party|National]] nor [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]], the two major [[List of political parties in New Zealand|political parties]] currently in parliament, have a stated policy of creating a republic, though some members of parliament have publicly expressed their personal support for a republic. Some members have also expressed support for the monarchy.

Lieutenant [[James Cook]] first sailed to New Zealand in 1769.

Despite Busby's presence, trouble increased. In 1840, the British government sent Captain [[William Hobson]] to New Zealand as [[lieutenant governor]]; he was instructed to negotiate a voluntary transfer of sovereignty from the [[Māori people|Māori]] to the British Crown.<ref name="Mallenby2002" /> The resultant [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was signed on 6 February 1840, at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]] in the [[Bay of Islands]].<ref name="Mallenby2002" /> Following the Treaty, the islands of New Zealand became a [[Crown colony]] and [[Queen Victoria]] became the monarch over New Zealand.<ref name="Mallenby2002" /><ref name="treaty1">{{cite encyclopedia|first=Claudia|last=Orange|title=Treaty of Waitangi - Interpretations of the Treaty of Waitangi|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/treaty-of-waitangi/page-2|encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=2 September 2016|date=20 June 2012}}</ref>

In the early 19th century, some Māori who visited [[London]] were introduced to royalty.

In 1852, the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]] was passed, establishing [[responsible government]] in New Zealand. The Act reserved significant constitutional powers for the monarch, including the right to refuse assent.{{sfn|Constitution Act|1852|loc=Section 56}}

[[Queen Victoria]]'s second son, [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]], became the first British royal to visit New Zealand. He landed in [[Wellington]] on April 11, 1869, aboard his ship [[HMS Galatea (1859)|HMS Galatea]].

In 1907, New Zealand achieved the status of '[[Dominion]]', which denoted that it was a country of the [[British Empire]] (and later the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]) with autonomy in domestic and foreign affairs.<ref name="status">{{cite web|title=What changed? - Dominion status|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/dominion-day/what-changed|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref> In 1917, letters patent of King [[George V]] set out the powers, duties and responsibilities of the governor-general and the Executive Council.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyce|2008 |p=173}}</ref> The governor-general remained an appointee of the British Crown on the advice of the British Cabinet.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Zealand Sovereignty: 1857, 1907, 1947, or 1987?|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/research-papers/document/00PLLawRP07041/new-zealand-sovereignty-1857-1907-1947-or-1987|publisher=Governor-General of New Zealand|access-date=16 February 2018|language=en-NZ|date=28 August 2007}}</ref>

The concept of a [[Independence of New Zealand|fully independent]] New Zealand sharing the person of the sovereign with the United Kingdom and other countries only emerged gradually over time through constitutional convention. A series of [[Imperial Conference]]s held in London, from 1917 on, resulted in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], which provided that the United Kingdom and the Dominions were to considered as "autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate to one another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown".<ref>{{cite web|title=Dominion status and legislation|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/dominion-status-legislation.htm|publisher=The National Archives|access-date=31 August 2016}}</ref> The governor-general of New Zealand, as with all the other [[governors-general]] of the empire, became the direct representative of the monarch in person, rather than a diplomatic channel between the New Zealand and British governments.<ref name="Regalised">{{cite web |title=History of the Governor-General – Regalised |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/history-of-the-governor-general/regalised |website=NZHistory |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=24 October 2018 |date=17 July 2014}}</ref>

The Crown was further separated amongst its Dominions by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster in 1931]], an Act of the British parliament, which gave New Zealand and other Dominions the authority to make their own laws in all matters, while requiring them all to seek each other's assent for changes to monarchical titles and the [[Succession to the New Zealand throne|common line of succession]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Statute of Westminster 1931|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/22-23/4/introduction|website=legislation.gov.uk|access-date=16 February 2018}}</ref> The British Parliament specifically gave up any claim to legislate for a Dominion, save at its own request.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=McIntyre |first1=W.

The sovereign did not possess a title unique to New Zealand until the New Zealand Parliament enacted the [[Royal Titles Act 1953|Royal Titles Act]] in 1953,<ref name="Peaslee1985" /> altering the style borne by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and giving her the title of ''Queen of the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Her Other Realms and Territories''.<ref name="Peaslee1985" /> Accordingly, the name of the country in official usage was also changed to the [[Realm of New Zealand]].<ref name="status" />

More recently, the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1986|Constitution Act 1986]] has become the principal formal statement of New Zealand's constitution. This law formally establishes that the sovereign (in Right of New Zealand) is the head of state of New Zealand and that the governor-general is her representative; each can, in general, exercise all the powers of the other.<ref name=CO8/>{{#tag:ref|The Constitution Act also repealed and replaced the Statute of Westminster, and removed the remaining ability of the British parliament to intervene in New Zealand constitutional affairs.<ref name="Currie">A.E.
