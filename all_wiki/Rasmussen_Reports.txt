Rasmussen Reports conducts nightly tracking, at national and state levels, of elections, politics, current events, [[consumer confidence]], business topics, and the [[President of the United States|United States president]]'s job approval ratings.

The accuracy of Rasmussen's polling has varied considerably in recent U.S. presidential elections (2000–2016). Some poll watchers, including [[Patrick Caddell]] and [[Douglas Schoen]], have lauded Rasmussen Reports, while others, such as [[Chris Cillizza]], have questioned its accuracy. [[FiveThirtyEight]] gives the firm a "C+" rating, reporting it had a 3.9-point bias in favor of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates in the 2010 midterm election. 

Surveys by the company are conducted using a combination of automated public opinion polling involving pre-recorded telephone inquiries and an online survey. The company generates revenue by selling advertising and subscriptions to its polling survey data.

==Polling topics==

===Political sentiment===

====Presidential approval tracking====
Rasmussen Reports conducts a daily Presidential Tracking Poll which measures the president's job approval rating.<ref name=daily>{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/obama_administration/daily_presidential_tracking_poll|title=Daily Presidential Tracking Poll|publisher=Rasmussen Reports|date=July 10, 2012|accessdate=July 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/polls/235765-rasmussen-obama-gets-polling-bump-from-high-court-health-ruling|title=Rasmussen: Obama gets polling bump from high court health ruling|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=June 30, 2012| accessdate=July 10, 2012}}</ref> Rasmussen Reports notes that, "It is important to remember that the Rasmussen Reports job approval ratings are based upon a sample of [[likely voters]]. Some other firms base their approval ratings on samples of all adults. Obama's numbers were almost always several points higher in a poll of adults rather than likely voters. That's because some of the former president's most enthusiastic supporters, such as young adults, are less likely to turn out to vote."<ref name=daily/><ref>{{cite web|date=November 17, 2009|title=So What's a Likely Voter? Answers from Rasmussen and PPP|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/so_whats_a_likely_voter_answer_b_725951|accessdate=July 12, 2012|publisher=HuffPost Pollster}}</ref> ''[[Newsweek]]'' also notes that polls of all adults produce results that are more favorable to Democrats than do polls of likely voters. Mark Blumenthal of ''Pollster.com'' notes that, "Rasmussen's Obama job approval ratings do tend to be lower than most other polls, but they are not the lowest."<ref>{{cite web|date=December 1, 2009|title=Why Is Rasmussen So Different?|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why_is_rasmussen_so_different_b_724655|accessdate=July 12, 2012|publisher=HuffPost Pollster}}</ref>

In March 2009, a Rasmussen Reports poll was the first to show President Barack Obama's approval rating falling. Writing in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', Scott Rasmussen, along with President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton's]] pollster, [[Douglas Schoen]], said, "Polling data show that Mr. Obama's approval rating is dropping and is below where [[George W. Bush]] was in an analogous period in 2001. Rasmussen Reports data shows that Mr. Obama's net presidential approval rating—which is calculated by subtracting the number who strongly disapprove from the number who strongly approve—is just six, his lowest rating to date."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123690358175013837|title=Obama's Poll Numbers Are Falling to Earth |work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=March 13, 2009|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref>

====Generic Congressional Ballot====
Each week, Rasmussen Reports updates a Generic Congressional Ballot Poll. The poll tracks what percentage of likely voters would vote for the Republican in their district’s congressional race if the election were held today, and what percentage of likely voters would choose the Democrat instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/generic_congressional_ballot/|title=Generic Congressional Ballot|publisher=Rasmussen Reports|date=July 9, 2012| accessdate=July 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmichaels/2012/06/29/obamacare-is-it-2010-again/|title=The Silver Lining In the SCOTUS Ruling?

====Healthcare reform====
Starting in 2009, Rasmussen Reports tracked attitudes about health care reform legislation on a weekly basis. Since the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] became law in March 2010, Rasmussen Reports consistently measured double-digit support for repeal of the law in 100 polls taken from March 2010 to July 2012. Likely voters favored repeal by an average margin of 16 percentage points during that period.<ref>{{cite web|date=July 9, 2012|title=For 100th Consecutive Time, Voters Back Obamacare's Repeal|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/for-100th-consecutive-time-voters-back-obamacares-repeal|accessdate=July 10, 2012|publisher=[[Weekly Standard]]}}</ref>

====Political Class/Mainstream Index====
Rasmussen Reports tracks the gap between what it labels "Mainstream Voters" and the "Political Class."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/august_2010/67_of_political_class_say_u_s_heading_in_right_direction_84_of_mainstream_disagrees|title=67% of Political Class Say U.S. Heading in Right Direction, 84% of Mainstream Disagrees|publisher=Rasmussen Reports|date=August 3, 2010| accessdate=July 10, 2012}}</ref> According to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', "To figure out where people are, he [Rasmussen] asks three questions: Whose judgment do you trust more: that of the American people or America's political leaders? Has the federal government become its own special interest group? Do government and big business often work together in ways that hurt consumers and investors? Those who identify with the government on two or more questions are defined as the political class."

====Other====
Rasmussen Reports conducts a weekly tracking poll that asks voters whether they think the country is heading in the right direction or is on the wrong track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/right_direction_or_wrong_track|title=Right Direction or Wrong Track|date=July 5, 2012|publisher=Rasmussen Reports|accessdate=July 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/apr/25/the-obama-re-election-myth/|title=The Obama re-election myth|date=April 25, 2012|publisher=[[Washington Times]]|accessdate=July 10, 2012}}</ref> The company also provides regular updates on topics including global warming and energy issues, housing, the war on terror, the mood of America, Congress and the Supreme Court, importance of issues, partisan trust, and trends in public opinion. In 2007, [[Tony Snow]], White House press secretary for President George W. Bush, attacked a Rasmussen poll that showed only 19% of Americans believed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]] was a success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=N2E1YjQ0NzQ3ODVmOWU2M2E5YWNiMDEwMmQ1MWNmN2Q= |title=Highlights from Tony Snow's Conference Call With Bloggers |publisher=[[National Review Online]] |date=July 12, 2007 |accessdate=March 26, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808065237/http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=N2E1YjQ0NzQ3ODVmOWU2M2E5YWNiMDEwMmQ1MWNmN2Q= |archive-date=August 8, 2007 }}</ref>

[[David Weigel]] wrote that, "where Rasmussen Reports really distinguishes itself, and the reason it’s so often cited by conservatives, is in its issue polling. Before the stimulus debate began, Rasmussen asked voters whether they’d favor stimulus plans that consisted entirely of tax cuts or entirely of spending. Tax cuts won every time, and Republicans began citing this when they argued for a tax-cut-only stimulus package."<ref name=weigel>David Weigel: [http://washingtonindependent.com/30539/rasmussen-the-only-poll-that-matters Rasmussen, the Only Poll that Matters] [[The Washington Independent]], February 18, 2009</ref>

In May 2012, a Rasmussen Reports poll found that "a solid majority of voters nationwide favor legalizing and regulating marijuana similar to the way alcohol and tobacco cigarettes are currently regulated.” Of those polled, 56% favored legalizing and regulating marijuana, while 36% were opposed to legalizing and regulating the drug.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kirell |first1=Andrew |title=Rasmussen Poll Finds More Than Half Of America Now Supports Legalizing Marijuana |url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/rasmussen-poll-finds-more-than-half-of-america-now-supports-legalizing-marijuana/ |website=Mediaite |accessdate=April 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130128165601/http://www.mediaite.com/online/rasmussen-poll-finds-more-than-half-of-america-now-supports-legalizing-marijuana/ |archive-date=January 28, 2013 |date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=unfit}}</ref>{{cbignore|bot=InternetArchiveBot}}

In July 2012, a Rasmussen Reports poll found that over two-thirds of Americans would fire every member of Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mitch-feierstein/congress-youre-fired-68-o_b_1650198.html|title=U.S. Congress: You're Fired! 68% of the Country Is Right!  |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |date= July 5, 2012 |accessdate= July 11, 2012}}</ref> In January 2013, a Rasmussen Reports poll found record low levels of support for the [[Tea Party movement]].

===Business===
In the business realm, Rasmussen Reports releases daily updates of Consumer and Investor Confidence with daily tracking back to 2002.

At the end of the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], there were eight national tracking polls and many other polls conducted on a regular basis. Polling analyst [[Nate Silver]] reviewed the tracking polls and said that while none were perfect, and Rasmussen was "frequently reputed to have a Republican lean", the "house effect" in their tracking poll was small and "with its large sample size and high pollster rating [it] would probably be the one I'd want with me on a desert island."<ref>{{cite web|last=Silver|first=Nate|date=October 21, 2008|title=Tracking Poll Primer|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tracking-poll-primer/|accessdate=March 26, 2012|publisher=FiveThirtyEight}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbBoAgAAQBAJ&q=%22with+its+large+sample+size+and+high+pollster+rating%22+%22would+probably+be+the+one+I'd+want+with+me+on+a+desert+island.&pg=PA298|title=The Performance of Politics: Obama's Victory and the Democratic Struggle for Power|last=Alexander|first=Jeffrey C.|date=November 1, 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199781355|language=en}}</ref>

===Criticism===

====FiveThirtyEight====
In 2010, Silver wrote an article entitled "Is Rasmussen Reports biased?" in which he mostly defended Rasmussen from allegations of bias.<ref>{{cite news|last=Silver|first=Nate|date=January 3, 2010|title=Is Rasmussen Reports Biased?|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-rasmussen-reports-biased/}}</ref> However, later in the year, Rasmussen's polling results diverged notably from those of other mainstream pollsters, which Silver labeled a "house effect."<ref>{{cite news|last=Silver|first=Nate|date=March 12, 2010|title=House Effects Render Poll-Reading Difficult|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/house-effects-render-poll-reading/}}</ref> He went on to explore other factors that may have explained the effect, such as the use of a likely voter model,<ref>{{cite news|last=Silver|first=Nate|date=April 17, 2010|title=Use of Likely Voter Model Does Not Explain Rasmussen "House Effect"|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/use-of-likely-voter-model-does-not/}}</ref> and claimed that Rasmussen conducted its polls in a way that excluded the majority of the population from answering.<ref>{{cite news|last=Silver|first=Nate|date=July 19, 2010|title=Is a Poll Scientific if it Excludes More Than Half the Population?|work=The New York Times|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-poll-scientific-if-it-excludes-more/}}</ref>

After the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], Silver concluded that Rasmussen's polls were the least accurate of the major pollsters in 2010, having an average error of 5.8 points and a pro-Republican bias of 3.9 points according to Silver's model.<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite news |url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/rasmussen-polls-were-biased-and-inaccurate-quinnipiac-surveyusa-performed-strongly/ |work=The New York Times |first=Nate |last=Silver |title=Rasmussen Polls Were Biased and Inaccurate; Quinnipiac, SurveyUSA Performed Strongly |date=November 4, 2010}}</ref> FiveThirtyEight currently rates Rasmussen Reports with a C+ grade and notes a simple average error of 5.3 percent across 722 polls analyzed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/|title=FiveThirtyEight's Pollster Ratings|last=Silver|first=Nate|date=October 26, 2020|newspaper=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=October 26, 2020|language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Bias in questions ====
[[Jonathan Chait]] of the ''New Republic'' said that Rasmussen is perceived in the "conservative world" as "the gold standard"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/75161/the-rasmussen-problem|title=The Rasmussen Problem|work=New Republic|access-date=December 30, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> and suggested the polling company asks the questions specifically to show public support for the conservative position.

Rasmussen has received criticism over the wording in its polls.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703384204575510272945083114 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Carl |last=Bialik |title=When Wording Skews Results in Polls |date=September 25, 2010}}</ref><ref name="washingtonmonthly1">{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_03/017142.php |title=Political Animal |work=[[Washington Monthly]] |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=March 4, 2009}}</ref> Asking a polling question with different wording can affect the results of the poll;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2009/nov/02/do-polls-show-majority-support-health-plan/ |title=Do polls show 'majority support' for health plan? |publisher=[[PolitiFact.com]] |date=November 2, 2009 |accessdate=June 14, 2012}}</ref> the commentators in question allege that the questions Rasmussen ask in polls are skewed in order to favor a specific response. For instance, when Rasmussen polled whether Republican voters thought [[Rush Limbaugh]] was the leader of their party, the specific question they asked was: "Agree or Disagree: 'Rush Limbaugh is the leader of the Republican Party—he says jump and they say how high.'"<ref name="washingtonmonthly1" />

''[[Talking Points Memo]]'' has questioned the methodology of Rasmussen's Presidential Approval Index, which takes into account only those who "strongly" approve or disapprove of the President's job performance. ''TPM'' noted that this inherently skews negative, and reported that multiple polling experts were critical of the concept.<ref name="tpm">{{cite web|last=Kleefeld|first=Eric|date=July 29, 2009|title=The Rasmussen "Presidential Approval Index": Is This Newer Measurement Worth Anything?|url=https://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/the-rasmussen-presidential-approval-index-is-this-newer-measurement-worth-anything|accessdate=March 26, 2012|work=Talking Points Memo}}</ref> A ''[[New York Times]]'' article claims Rasmussen Reports research has a "record of relying on dubious sampling and weighting techniques."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/upshot/democrats-are-seeing-more-daylight-in-path-to-senate-control.html|title=Democrats Are Seeing More Daylight in Path to Senate Control|first=Nate|last=Cohn|date=September 12, 2014|work=New York Times}}</ref> Rasmussen has also been criticized for only polling Likely Voters which, according to Politico, "potentially weeds out younger and minority voters".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Isenstadt |first1=Alex |title=Democrats rip Rasmussen |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2010/01/democrats-rip-rasmussen-031047 |accessdate=June 7, 2020 |work=[[Politico]] |date=January 2, 2010}}</ref>

A 2017 article by [[Chris Cillizza]] for [[CNN]] raised doubts about Rasmussen's accuracy, drawing attention specifically to potential [[sampling bias]]es such as the exclusion of calls to cell phones (which, Cillizza argued, tended to exclude younger voters), and also more generally to a lack of methodological disclosure. Cillizza did, however, note in the same piece that Rasmussen was one of the more accurate polling organizations during the [[2016 United States presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/17/politics/trump-approval-rating-rasmussen/index.html|title=Is Donald Trump's approval rating really 50 percent?|date=April 17, 2017|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=April 17, 2017|author=Chris Cillizza}}</ref>

A December 2018 article by political writer and analyst [[Harry Enten]] called Rasmussen the least accurate pollster in the [[2018 United States elections|2018 midterm elections]] after stating Rasmussen had projected the Republicans to come ahead nationally by one point, while at the time Democrats were actually winning the national House vote by 8.6 points—an error of nearly 10 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/08/politics/poll-of-the-week-trumps-favorite-pollster/index.html|title=Trump's favorite pollster was the least accurate in the midterms|date=December 8, 2018|publisher=[[CNN]]|author=Harry Enten}}</ref>

The [[Associated Press]] has also addressed Rasmussen's methodology. In 2018, AP journalists noted that Rasmussen's telephone methodology systematically omits adults, many of them young people, without landlines. The AP also noted that Rasmussen does not provide details regarding its online-panel methodology.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/59ef870461a8417daf4ffc71dc331d4c|title=AP FACT CHECK: Trump cites questionable job approval rating|date=October 29, 2019|publisher=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref>

In an article for [[The Hill (newspaper)|''The Hill'']] titled "Rasmussen Research has a pro-GOP bias," panelist discussed Rasmussen's practice of adjusting results by party identification. In addition to providing professional criticism from [[Ipsos]], the article cited methodological concerns from Frank Newport of [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]].<ref name=hill>{{cite web|url=https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/405965-pollster-rasmussen-research-has-a-pro-gop-bias|title=Rasmussen Research has a pro-GOP bias|date=November 20, 2019|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]}}</ref>
