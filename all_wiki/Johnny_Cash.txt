In March 1935, when Cash was three years old, the family settled in [[Dyess, Arkansas]], a [[New Deal]] colony established to give poor families the opportunity to work land that they may later own.<ref name = Bowden>{{cite news|last1=Bowden|first1=Bill|title=National Register accepts Johnny Cash boyhood home in Arkansas|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/may/05/national-register-accepts-cash-boyhood-/|access-date=May 7, 2018|work=ArkansasOnline|publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]|date=May 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505231153/http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/may/05/national-register-accepts-cash-boyhood-/|archive-date=May 5, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> From the age of five, he worked in cotton fields with his family, singing with them as they worked. The Cash farm in Dyess experienced a flood, which led Cash later to write the song "[[Five Feet High and Rising (song)|Five Feet High and Rising]]".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |page=20  |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0060727535 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> His family's economic and personal struggles during the [[Great Depression]] inspired many of his songs, especially those about other people facing similar difficulties. Consequently, he had lifelong sympathy for the poor and working class.

On May 13, 1944,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://folsomcasharttrail.com/blog/articles/postid/50/why-did-johnny-cash-always-wear-black-25-facts-about-americas-outlaw|title=Why Did Johnny Cash Always Wear Black? 25 Facts About America's Outlaw|access-date=2019-06-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622054539/https://folsomcasharttrail.com/blog/articles/postid/50/why-did-johnny-cash-always-wear-black-25-facts-about-americas-outlaw|archive-date=June 22, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Cash's older brother Jack, with whom he was close, was seriously injured in an accident at his job in a high school when he was pulled into an unguarded [[table saw]] while cutting oak into fence posts, and was almost cut in two.

His mother urged Jack to skip work and go fishing with Cash, but Jack insisted on working as the family needed the money. On his deathbed, Jack said he had visions of the afterlife and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of looking forward to "meeting [his] brother in Heaven".<ref name="Streissguth_profile" />

Cash's early memories were dominated by [[gospel music]] and radio. Taught guitar by his mother and a childhood friend, Cash began playing and writing songs at the age of 12. When young, Cash had a [[tenor|high-tenor]] voice, before becoming a [[baritone|bass-baritone]] after his [[voice change]]d.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gross |first1=Terry |title=All I Did Was Ask: Conversations with Writers, Actors Musicians, and Artists |date=2004 |publisher=[[Hachette Books]] |page=31 |edition=Hardcover}}</ref> In high school, he sang on a local radio station. Decades later, he released an album of traditional gospel songs called ''[[My Mother's Hymn Book]]''.

=== Early career ===
[[File:Johnny Cash Sun Records promotional portrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Publicity photo for Sun Records, 1955]]
In 1954, Cash and Vivian moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he had sold appliances while studying to be a radio announcer. At night, he played with guitarist [[Luther Perkins]] and bassist [[Marshall Grant]]. Perkins and Grant were known as the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]]. Cash worked up the courage to visit the [[Sun Records]] studio, hoping to get a recording contract.<ref>{{cite web|title= Johnny Cash Biography and Interview |website=Achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://www.achievement.org/achiever/johnny-cash/#interview}}</ref> He auditioned for [[Sam Phillips]] by singing mostly gospel songs, only to learn from the producer that he no longer recorded gospel music.  Phillips was rumored to have told Cash to "go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell", although in a 2002 interview, Cash denied that Phillips made any such comment.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=832786|title=The Man in Black's Musical Journey Continues|access-date=February 9, 2010|publisher=NPR}}</ref> Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style. In 1955, Cash made his first recordings at Sun, "[[Hey Porter]]" and "[[Cry! Cry! Cry!]]", which were released in late June and met with success on the country [[hit parade]].

On December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips while [[Carl Perkins]] was in the studio cutting new tracks, with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio, and the four started an [[impromptu]] [[jam session]]. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived. They have since been released under the title ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. In ''Cash: the Autobiography'', Cash wrote that he was the farthest from the microphone and sang in a higher pitch to blend in with Elvis.

Cash's next record, "Folsom Prison Blues", made the country top five. His "[[I Walk the Line]]" became number one on the country charts and entered the pop charts top 20. "[[Home of the Blues]]" followed, recorded in July 1957. That same year, Cash became the first Sun artist to release a [[LP record|long-playing album]]. Although he was Sun's most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label. Phillips did not want Cash to record gospel and was paying him a 3% royalty rather than the standard rate of 5%. Presley had already left Sun, and Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Lewis.

In 1958, Cash left Phillips to sign a lucrative offer with [[Columbia Records]]. His single "[[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]" became one of his biggest hits, and he recorded a collection of gospel songs for his second album for Columbia. However, Cash left behind a sufficient backlog of recordings with Sun that Phillips continued to release new singles and albums from, featuring previously unreleased material until as late as 1964. Cash was in the unusual position of having new releases out on two labels concurrently. Sun's 1960 release, a cover of "[[Oh Lonesome Me]]", made it to number 13 on the C&W charts.

(When [[RCA Victor]] signed Presley, it also bought his Sun Records masters, but when Cash departed for Columbia, Phillips retained the rights to the singer's Sun masters. Columbia eventually licensed some of these recordings for release on compilations after Cash's death.)

Early in his career, Cash was given the teasing nickname "the Undertaker" by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes. He said he chose them because they were easier to keep looking clean on long tours.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-johnny-cash-20131031|title=10 Things you didn't know about Johnny Cash|magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=August 29, 2014|date=2013-10-31}}</ref>

In the early 1960s, Cash toured with the Carter Family, which by this time regularly included [[Maybelle Carter|Mother Maybelle]]'s daughters, [[Anita Carter|Anita]], June, and [[Helen Carter|Helen]]. June later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours. In the 1960s, he appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s short-lived television series ''[[Rainbow Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardandmimi.com/rainbowquest.html|title=Rainbow Quest|website=Richardandmimi.com|date=February 26, 1966|access-date=August 1, 2012}}</ref> He also acted in, and wrote and sang the opening theme for, a 1961 film entitled ''[[Five Minutes to Live]]'', later re-released as ''Door-to-door Maniac''.

Cash's career was handled by Saul Holiff, a London, Ontario, promoter. Their relationship was the subject of Saul's son's biopic ''[[My Father and the Man in Black]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnny-and-saul.com|title=My Father and The Man in Black|website=Johnny-and-saul.com|access-date=April 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517093414/http://johnny-and-saul.com/|archive-date=May 17, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As his career was taking off in the late 1950s, Cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to [[amphetamine]]s and [[barbiturate]]s. For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with [[Waylon Jennings]], who was deeply addicted to amphetamines. Cash used the stimulants to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his "nervousness" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening [[drug addiction]].

Although he was in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash could still deliver hits due to his frenetic creativity. His rendition of "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]" was a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] hit, reaching number one on the country charts and entering the top 20 on the pop charts. It was originally performed by June's sister, but the signature [[mariachi]]-style horn arrangement was provided by Cash.<ref name=pc10>{{Pop Chronicles|10|3}}</ref> He said that it had come to him in a dream. Vivian Liberto claimed a different version of the origins of "Ring of Fire". In her book, ''I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny'', Liberto says that Cash gave Carter half the songwriting credit for monetary reasons.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Vivian |last2=Sharpsteen |first2=Ann |title=I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny |date=2007 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=978-1416532927 |page=294 |edition=Hardcover |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmkBUE0f3HAC&pg=PA294 |access-date=February 28, 2019}}</ref>

In June 1965, Cash's camper caught fire during a fishing trip with his nephew Damon Fielder in [[Los Padres National Forest]] in California, triggering a forest fire that burned several hundred acres and nearly caused his death.<ref>"Major brush fire." ''Los Angeles Times'', June 28, 1965, p. 1.</ref><ref>"Control of Brush Fire Near; 700 Acres Burned." ''Los Angeles Times'', June 29, 1965, p. 27.</ref> Cash claimed that the fire was caused by sparks from a defective exhaust system on his camper, but Fielder thinks that Cash started a fire to stay warm and in his drugged condition failed to notice the fire getting out of control.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hilburn|first1=Robert|title=Johnny Cash: The Life|year=2013|publisher=Little, Brown and Company| edition=ebook|isbn=978-0-316-19475-4}}</ref> When the judge asked Cash why he did it, Cash said, "I didn't do it, my truck did, and it's dead, so you can't question it."<ref>Hilburn, 2013 (ebook)</ref>

Although Cash cultivated a romantic [[outlaw]] image, he never served a prison sentence. Despite landing in jail seven times for [[misdemeanor]]s, he stayed only one night on each stay. On May 11, 1965, he was arrested in [[Starkville, Mississippi]], for [[trespassing]] late at night onto private property to pick flowers. (He used this to write the song "Starkville City Jail", which he discussed on his live ''At San Quentin'' album.)<ref>Johnny Cash, ''[[At San Quentin]]'', [[Columbia Records]] CS 9827, 1969</ref> While on tour that year, he was arrested October 4 in [[El Paso, Texas]], by a [[narcotic]]s squad. The officers suspected he was [[smuggling]] heroin from Mexico, but found instead 688 [[Dexedrine]] capsules (amphetamines) and 475 [[Meprobamate|Equanil]] (sedatives or tranquilizers) tablets that the singer had hidden inside his guitar case. Because the pills were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics, he received a [[suspended sentence]]. Cash posted a $1,500 bond and then was released until his arraignment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/12/entertainment/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-calif/3|title=Johnny Cash's dark California days|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|date=2013-10-12|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

In this period of the mid-1960s, Cash released a number of [[concept album]]s. His ''[[Bitter Tears]]'' (1964) was devoted to spoken word and songs addressing the plight of Native Americans and mistreatment by the government. While initially reaching charts, this album met with resistance from some fans and radio stations, which rejected its controversial take on social issues. In 2011, a book was published about it, leading to a re-recording of the songs by contemporary artists and the making of a documentary film about Cash's efforts with the album. This film was aired on PBS in February and November 2016. His ''[[Sings the Ballads of the True West]]'' (1965) was an experimental double record, mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken narration.

Reaching a low with his severe drug addiction and destructive behavior, Cash was divorced from his first wife and had performances cancelled, but he continued to find success. In 1967, Cash's duet with June Carter, "[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]," won a [[Grammy Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22johnny+cash%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All/|title=Past Winners Search|work=The GRAMMYs|date=2017-04-30}}</ref>

Cash was last arrested in 1967 in [[Walker County, Georgia]], after police found he was carrying a bag of prescription pills and was in a car accident. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. The singer was jailed for the night in [[LaFayette, Georgia]]. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school.<ref>{{Citation|page=5A|place=LaFayette, Georgia|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KtkvAAAAIBAJ&pg=3615,6191621|newspaper=Rome News Tribune|date=August 14, 1970|title=12 000 at LaFayette show}}</ref> Reflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: "I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me."<ref>Gross (2004). p. 34</ref>

There is an unconfirmed story that in early 1967, Cash had a spiritual [[wikt:epiphany|epiphany]] in the [[Nickajack Cave]]. The story says that Cash had attempted to commit suicide while under the heavy influence of drugs. He descended deep into the cave, trying to lose himself and "just die", but passed out on the floor. Utterly discouraged, he felt God's presence in his heart and struggled out of the cave (despite exhaustion) by following a faint light and slight breeze.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/30/showbiz/music/johnny-cash-biography/index.html|title=The stories of Johnny Cash |last=Leopold|first= Todd |publisher=CNN|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref> To him, the incident represented his rebirth. June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him get off drugs. Cash proposed onstage to June on February 22, 1968, at a concert at the [[London Gardens]] in London, Ontario, Canada. The couple married a week later (on March 1) in Franklin, Kentucky. She had agreed to marry Cash after he had "cleaned up."<ref>{{cite book|last=Zwonitzer|first=Mark|title=Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone: The Carter Family and Their Legacy in American Music|url=https://archive.org/details/willyoumissmewhe0000zwon|url-access=registration|publisher=Simon & Schuster |year= 2002|isbn= 978-0-684-85763-3}}</ref>

Cash's journey included rediscovery of his Christian faith. He took an "[[altar call]]" in Evangel Temple, a small church in the Nashville area, pastored by Reverend Jimmie Rodgers Snow, son of country music legend [[Hank Snow]]. According to Marshall Grant, though, Cash did not completely stop using amphetamines in 1968.  Cash did not end all drug use until 1970, staying drug-free for a period of seven years. Grant claims that the birth of Cash's son, John Carter Cash, inspired Cash to end his dependence.<ref name="Grant page 92">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Marshall|title=I Was There When It Happened&nbsp;– My Life With Johnny Cash|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars/page/92 92, 177]|publisher=Cumberland House|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58182-510-7|url=https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars/page/92}}</ref>

Cash began using amphetamines again in 1977. By 1983, he was deeply addicted again and became a patient at the [[Betty Ford Clinic]] in [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]] for treatment. He stayed off drugs for several years, but relapsed. By 1989, he was dependent and entered Nashville's Cumberland Heights Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center. In 1992, he started care at the Loma Linda Behavioral Medicine Center in [[Loma Linda, California]], for his final rehabilitation treatment. (Several months later, his son followed him into this facility for treatment).<ref name=Grant>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Marshall|title=I Was There When It Happened&nbsp;– My Life With Johnny Cash|publisher=Cumberland House|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58182-510-7|url=https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars}}</ref><ref name="John Carter Cash">{{cite book|last=Cash|first=John Carter|title=Anchored in Love|publisher=Thomas Nelson|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8499-0187-4}}</ref>

=== Folsom and other prison concerts ===
Cash began performing concerts at prisons in the late 1950s. He played his first famous prison concert on January 1, 1958, at San Quentin State Prison.<ref name="cash1958">[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/inmate-merle-haggard-hears-johnny-cash-play-san-quentin-state-prison "Inmate Merle Haggard hears Johnny Cash play San Quentin State Prison"], history.com; accessed June 24, 2014.</ref> These performances led to a pair of highly successful live albums, ''[[At Folsom Prison|Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison]]'' (1968) and ''[[At San Quentin|Johnny Cash at San Quentin]]'' (1969).  Both live albums reached number one on ''Billboard'' country album music and the latter crossed over to reach the top of the ''Billboard'' pop album chart.  In 1969, Cash became an international hit when he eclipsed even [[The Beatles]] by selling 6.5&nbsp;million albums.<ref>Edwards, Leigh H. "Cash, Johnny." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> In comparison, the prison concerts were much more successful than his later live albums such as ''Strawberry Cake'' recorded in London and ''Live at Madison Square Garden'', which peaked at numbers 33 and 39 on the album charts, respectively.

The [[Folsom State Prison|Folsom Prison]] record was introduced by a rendition of his "Folsom Prison Blues" while the [[San Quentin]] record included the crossover hit single "[[A Boy Named Sue]]", a [[Shel Silverstein]]-penned novelty song that reached number one on the country charts and number two on the U.S. [[Top 40|top-10]] pop charts. The AM versions of the latter contained profanities which were edited out of the aired version. The modern CD versions are unedited, thus making them longer than on the original vinyl albums, though they retain the audience-reaction overdubs of the originals.

Cash performed at the [[Österåker Prison]] in Sweden in 1972. The live album ''[[På Österåker]]'' (''At Österåker'') was released in 1973. "San Quentin" was recorded with Cash replacing "San Quentin" with "Österåker". In 1976, a concert at [[Tennessee State Prison]] was videotaped for TV broadcast, and received a belated CD release after Cash's death as ''[[A Concert Behind Prison Walls]]''.

=== Activism for Native Americans ===
In 1965, Cash and June Carter appeared on Pete Seeger's TV show, ''Rainbow Quest'', on which Cash explained his start as an activist for Native Americans: 
:In '57, I wrote a song called 'Old Apache Squaw' and then forgot the so-called Indian protest for a while, but nobody else seemed to speak up with any volume of voice.<ref>{{cite episode |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny| title=Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash |series=[[Rainbow Quest]] |season=1 |number=39 |year=1966}}</ref>

Columbia, the label for which Cash was recording then, was opposed to putting the song on his next album, considering it "too radical for the public".<ref>Cash, J., & Carr, P. (1997). Cash: The autobiography (p. 408). San Francisco, CA: HarperSanFrancisco.</ref> Cash singing songs of Indian tragedy and settler violence went radically against the mainstream of country music in the 1950s, which was dominated by the image of the righteous cowboy who simply makes the native's soil his own.<ref>Tahmahkera, D. (2011). Volume 63. In ''American Quarterly'' (p. 597). Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref>

In 1964, coming off the chart success of his previous album "[[I Walk The Line]]", he recorded the aforementioned album ''[[Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian]]''.

''We're Still Here: Johnny Cash's Bitter Tears Revisited'', a documentary&nbsp;by Antonino D'Ambrosio (author of'' A Heartland and a Guitar:&nbsp;Johnny Cash and the Making of Bitter Tears'') tells the&nbsp;story of Johnny Cash's controversial concept album "Bitter Tears: Ballads of the&nbsp;American Indian", covering the struggles of Native Americans.&nbsp;The film's DVD was released on August 21, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnewsnet.com/2018/08/were-still-here-johnny-cashs-bitter-tears-revisited-coming-to-dvd.html|title=We're Still Here: Johnny Cash's Bitter Tears Revisited|website=Musicnewsnet.com|access-date=September 21, 2018}}</ref>

The album featured stories of a multitude of native peoples, mostly of their violent oppression by white settlers: the Pima ("The Ballad of [[Ira Hayes]]"), Navajo ("Navajo"), Apache ("Apache Tears"), Lakota ("Big Foot"), Seneca ("As Long as the Grass Shall Grow"), and Cherokee ("Talking Leaves"). Cash wrote three of the songs himself and one with the help of [[Johnny Horton]], but the majority of the protest songs were written by folk artist [[Peter La Farge]]<ref name="Writers Credits to Bitter Tears">{{cite web|title=Johnny Cash – Bitter Tears – Ballads of the American Indian|url=http://www.discogs.com/Johnny-Cash-Bitter-Tears-Ballads-Of-The-American-Indian/release/722807|website=Discogs.com|access-date=October 16, 2014}}</ref> (son of activist and Pulitzer prizewinner [[Oliver La Farge]]), whom Cash met in New York in the 1960s and whom he admired for his activism.<ref>{{cite web|date=1965|title=Johnny Cash and June Carter (Television series episode).

In reaction, on August 22, 1964, Cash posted a letter as an advertisement in [[Billboard Magazine|''Billboard'']], calling the record industry cowardly: "D.J.s – station managers – owners&nbsp;... where are your guts? I had to fight back when I realized that so many stations are afraid of Ira Hayes. Just one question: WHY??? Ira Hayes is strong medicine&nbsp;... So is Rochester, Harlem, Birmingham and Vietnam."<ref>Tahmahkera, D. (2011). Volume 63. In ''American Quarterly'' (pp. 598–599). Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref> Cash kept promoting the song himself and used his influence on radio disc jockeys he knew eventually to make the song climb to number three on the [[Billboard charts#Country|country charts]], while the album rose to number two on the [[Digital Albums Chart|album charts]].<ref name="auto" />
[[File:JohnnyCashHouse1969.jpg|thumb|right|Cash in 1969]]
Later, on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'', he continued telling stories of Native-American plight, both in song and through short films, such as the history of the [[Trail of Tears]].<ref>{{cite web|date=1970|title=[Television series episode].

In 1966, in response to his activism, the singer was adopted by the Seneca Nation's Turtle Clan.<ref name=senecaadopted/> He performed benefits in 1968 at the Rosebud Reservation, close to the historical landmark of the massacre at [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]], to raise money to help build a school. He also played at the [[D-Q University]] in the 1980s.<ref>Tahmahkera, D. (2011). Volume 63. In ''American Quarterly'' (p. 592). Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref>

Johnny Cash used his stardom and economic status to bring awareness to the issues surrounding the Native American people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Johnny Cash and the paradox of American identity|last=Edwards|first=Leigh|publisher=Bloomington : Indiana University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-253-35292-7}}</ref> Cash sang songs about indigenous humanity in an effort to confront the U.S. government.

===''The Johnny Cash Show''===
From June 1969 to March 1971, Cash starred in his own television show, ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'', on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/08/10/johnny-cashs-excellent-music-variety-tv-show-ran-58-episodes-but-was-canceled-in-a-rural-purge/|title=Johnny Cash's excellent music variety TV show ran 58 episodes but was canceled in a "rural purge"|date=2017-08-10|work=The Vintage News|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref> Produced by [[Screen Gems]], the show was performed at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville. [[The Statler Brothers]] opened for him in every episode; the Carter Family and rockabilly legend Carl Perkins were also part of the regular show entourage. Cash also enjoyed booking mainstream performers as guests; including [[Linda Ronstadt]] in her first TV appearance, [[Neil Young]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition]] (who appeared four times), [[James Taylor]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Roger Miller]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Derek and the Dominos]], [[Joni Mitchell]], and  [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name=":0" />

From September 15–18, 1969, in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], he performed a series of four concerts at the [[New Mexico State Fair]] to promote the first season of ''The Johnny Cash Show''.<ref name="Johnny Cash Infocenter Albuquerque">{{cite web | title=Johnny Cash Live Performances | website=Johnny Cash Infocenter | date=September 11, 1956 | url=http://www.johnny-cash-infocenter.com/cashliverecordings/concerts.php?search=Albuquerque&col=date&sort=ASC&filter1=&filter2=&submit=+Search+&x= | access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref><ref name="JC Infocenter 1969">{{cite web | title=Details | website=Johnny Cash Infocenter | date=September 15, 1969 | url=http://www.johnny-cash-infocenter.com/cashliverecordings/details.php?show=1969-09-15 | access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref> These live shows were produced with help from ABC and local concert producer Bennie Sanchez, during these sets Johnny Cash and [[Al Hurricane]] performed together.<ref name="Jojola 2011">{{cite web | last=Jojola | first=Lloyd | title=ABQJOURNAL PROFILES: Sanchez: Matriarch to Musicians | website=Albuquerque Journal | date=January 31, 2011 | url=https://www.abqjournal.com/obits/profiles/3192721214obitsprofiles01-31-11.htm | access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref> Also during ''The Johnny Cash Show'' era, he contributed the title song and other songs to the film ''Little Fauss and Big Halsey'', which starred [[Robert Redford]], [[Michael J.

Cash had first met with Dylan in the mid-1960s and became neighbors in the late 1960s in [[Woodstock, New York]]. Cash was enthusiastic about reintroducing the reclusive Dylan to his audience. Cash sang a duet with Dylan, “[[Girl from the North Country]]”,  on Dylan's country album ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' and also wrote the album's [[Grammy]]-winning [[liner notes]].

Another artist who received a major career boost from ''The Johnny Cash Show'' was [[Kris Kristofferson]], who was beginning to make a name for himself as a singer-songwriter. During a live performance of Kristofferson's "[[Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down]]", Cash refused to change the lyrics to suit network executives, singing the song with its references to [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] intact:

The closing program of ''The Johnny Cash Show'' was a gospel music special. Guests included the [[The Blackwood Brothers|Blackwood Brothers]], [[Mahalia Jackson]], [[Stuart Hamblen]], and [[Billy Graham]].<ref>Dave Urbanski, ''The Man Comes Around: The Spiritual Journey of Johnny Cash'', Relevant Books, 2003, p. 91.</ref>

== "The Man in Black" ==
[[File:President Richard Nixon and Johnny Cash.jpg|thumb|Cash advocated [[prison reform]] at his July 1972 meeting with President [[Richard Nixon]]]]

By the early 1970s, Cash had crystallized his public image as "The Man in Black". He regularly performed in entirely black suits with a long, black, knee-length coat. This outfit stood in contrast to the [[rhinestone]] suits and [[cowboy boots]] worn by most of the major country acts of his day. In 1971, he wrote the song "[[Man in Black (song)|Man in Black]]" to help explain his dress code:

{{poemquote|We're doing mighty fine I do suppose
In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black.}}

[[File:Johnny-Cash 1972.jpg|thumb|left|Cash performing in [[Bremen]], West Germany, in September 1972]]
Cash said he wore all black on behalf of the poor and hungry, the "prisoner who has long paid for his crime", and those who have been betrayed by age or drugs.<ref name="85-86">{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |pages= 85–86 |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0060727535 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> He added, "With the [[Vietnam War]] as painful in my mind as it was in most other Americans, I wore it 'in mournin' for the lives that could have been'&nbsp;...

His band and he had initially worn black shirts because that was the only matching color they had among their various outfits. He wore other colors on stage early in his career, but he claimed to like wearing black both on and off stage. He stated that political reasons aside, he simply liked black as his on-stage color.<ref name="Page 64"/> The outdated [[Uniforms of the United States Navy|US Navy's winter blue uniform]] used to be referred to by sailors as "Johnny Cashes", as the uniform's shirt, tie, and trousers are solid black.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.navytimes.com/legacy/new/0-NAVYPAPER-356961.php|title=The good, bad and ugly of proposed uniforms|newspaper=[[Navy Times]]|date=October 4, 2004}}</ref>

In the mid-1970s, Cash's popularity and number of hit songs began to decline. He made commercials for [[Amoco]] and [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]], an unpopular enterprise at the time of the [[1970s energy crisis]]. In 1976, he made commercials for [[Lionel Corporation|Lionel Trains]], for which he also wrote the music.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lionel Trains: A Pictorial History of Trains and Their Collectors|page=19|author=Turner Publishing|publisher=Turner Publishing Company|year=2004|isbn=978-1-56311-958-3}}</ref> However, his first autobiography, ''Man in Black'', was published in 1975 and sold 1.3&nbsp;million copies. A second, ''Cash: The Autobiography'', appeared in 1997.

It was released in 1973. Cash viewed the film as a statement of his personal faith rather than a means of proselytizing.<ref>Dave Urbanski, ''The Man Comes Around: The Spiritual Journey of Johnny Cash.'' Relevant Books, 2003, p. 117.</ref>

Cash and June Carter Cash appeared several times on the ''Billy Graham Crusade'' TV specials, and Cash continued to include gospel and religious songs on many of his albums, though Columbia declined to release ''[[A Believer Sings the Truth]]'', a gospel double-LP Cash recorded in 1979 and which ended up being released on an independent label even with Cash still under contract to Columbia. On November 22, 1974, CBS ran his one-hour TV special entitled'' Riding The Rails'', a musical history of trains.

He continued to appear on television, hosting Christmas specials on [[CBS]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Later television appearances included a starring role in an episode of ''[[List of Columbo episodes#Season 3|Columbo]]'', entitled "Swan Song". June and he appeared in an episode of ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', entitled "The Collection". He gave a performance as abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] in the 1985 [[American Civil War]] television miniseries ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North and South]]''. In the 1990s, Johnny and June appeared in ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'' in recurring roles.

He was friendly with every US president, starting with [[Richard Nixon]]. He was closest to [[Jimmy Carter]], with whom he became close friends and who was a distant cousin of his wife, June.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0060727535 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref>

Cash declined to play the first two and instead selected other songs, including "The Ballad of [[Ira Hayes]]" (about a brave [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[World War II]] veteran who was mistreated upon his return to [[Arizona]]), and his own compositions, "[[What Is Truth (song)|What Is Truth]]" and "Man in Black". Cash wrote that the reasons for denying Nixon's song choices were not knowing them and having fairly short notice to rehearse them, rather than any political reason.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins |page=304 |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn= 9780062515001 |edition=hardcover| access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> However, Cash added, even if Nixon's office had given Cash enough time to learn and rehearse the songs, their choice of pieces that conveyed "[[Hippie|antihippie]] and [[Black people|antiblack]]" sentiments might have backfired.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |title=Cash: The Autobiography |date=2003 |publisher=Harper Collins |page= 212 |url=https://books.google.com/books | isbn=0060727535 |access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> In his remarks when introducing Cash, Nixon joked that one thing he had learned about the singer was one did not tell him what to sing.<ref>[[Richard Nixon]], April 17, 1970, released on Johnny Cash, ''Bootleg Vol. III: Live Around the World'' ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]]/Legacy 88697 93033 2), released 2011</ref>

=== Highwaymen and departure from Columbia Records ===
[[File:Highwaymen.jpg|thumb|[[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] members [[Kris Kristofferson]], Johnny Cash, [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]]]]
In 1980, Cash became the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]'s youngest living inductee at age 48, but during the 1980s, his records failed to make a major impact on the country charts, although he continued to tour successfully. In the mid-1980s, he recorded and toured with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]], making three hit albums, which were released beginning with the originally titled ''Highwayman'' in 1985, followed by ''Highwaymen 2'' in 1990, and concluding with ''Highwaymen&nbsp;– The Road Goes On Forever'' in 1995.

During that period, Cash appeared in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in ''[[The Pride of Jesse Hallam]]'', winning fine reviews for a film that called attention to adult [[illiteracy]]. In the same year, Cash appeared as a "very special guest star" in an episode of the ''[[Muppet Show]]''. In 1983, he appeared as a heroic sheriff in ''[[Murder in Coweta County]]'', based on a real-life Georgia murder case, which co-starred [[Andy Griffith]] as his nemesis and featured June Carter in a small but important role. Cash had tried for years to make the film, for which he won acclaim.

Cash relapsed into addiction after being administered painkillers for a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an unusual incident in which he was kicked and wounded by an ostrich he kept on his farm.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|title=Johnny Cash: The Rebel|website=Exclaim.ca|place=Canada|page=3|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426225724/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|archive-date=April 26, 2005|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

At a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent [[coronary artery bypass surgery|double bypass surgery]] in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a "[[near-death experience]]".

Cash's recording career and his general relationship with the Nashville establishment were at an all-time low in the 1980s. He realized that his record label of nearly 30 years, Columbia, was growing indifferent to him and was not properly marketing him (he was "invisible" during that time, as he said in his autobiography).

{{Anchor|Chicken in Black}}
In 1984, Cash released a self-parody recording titled "Chicken in Black" about Cash's brain being transplanted into a chicken and Cash receiving a bank robber's brain in return. Biographer Robert Hilburn, in his 2013 book ''Johnny Cash: The Life'', disputes the claim made that Cash chose to record an intentionally poor song in protest of Columbia's treatment of him. On the contrary, Hilburn writes, it was Columbia that presented Cash with the song, which Cash – who had previously scored major chart hits with comedic material such as "A Boy Named Sue" and "One Piece at a Time" – accepted enthusiastically, performing the song live on stage and filming a comedic music video in which he dresses up in a superhero-like bank-robber costume. According to Hilburn, Cash's enthusiasm for the song waned after Waylon Jennings told Cash he looked "like a buffoon" in the music video (which was showcased during Cash's 1984 Christmas TV special), and Cash subsequently demanded that Columbia withdraw the music video from broadcast and recall the single from stores—interrupting its bona fide chart success—and termed the venture "a fiasco."<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''. New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2013, pp. 500–502</ref>

Between 1981 and 1984, he recorded several sessions with famed [[countrypolitan]] producer [[Billy Sherrill]] (who also produced "Chicken in Black"), which were shelved; they would be released by Columbia's sister label, [[Legacy Recordings]], in 2014 as ''[[Out Among the Stars]]''.<ref name="ats">{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-lost-album-out-among-the-stars-20131210,0,2223681.story|title='Lost' Early-'80s Johnny Cash Album Slated for March 25 Release|last=Lewis|first=Randy|date=December 10, 2013 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]}}</ref> Around this time, Cash also recorded [[Believe in Him|an album of gospel recordings]] that ended up being released by another label around the time of his departure from Columbia (this due to Columbia closing down its Priority Records division that was to have released the recordings).

After more unsuccessful recordings were released between 1984–85, Cash left Columbia (at least as a solo artist; he continued to record for Columbia on nonsolo projects until as late as 1990, recording a duets album with Waylon Jennings and two albums as a member of The Highwaymen).

In 1986, Cash returned to Sun Studios in Memphis to team up with [[Roy Orbison]], Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]''; according to Hilburn, Columbia still had Cash under contract at the time, so special arrangements had to be made to allow him to participate.<ref>Hilburn, p. 506</ref> Also in 1986, Cash published his only novel, ''Man in White'', a book about [[Paul the Apostle|Saul]] and his conversion to become the Apostle Paul. He recorded ''Johnny Cash Reads The Complete [[New Testament]]'' in 1990.

=== ''American Recordings'' ===

After Columbia Records dropped Cash from his recording contract, he had a short and unsuccessful stint with [[Mercury Records]] from 1987 to 1991. During this time, he recorded an album of new versions of some of his best-known Sun and Columbia hits, as well as ''[[Water from the Wells of Home]]'', a duets album that paired him with, among others, his children [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[John Carter Cash]], as well as [[Paul McCartney]]. A [[Johnny Cash Country Christmas|one-off Christmas album]] recorded for [[Delta Records]] followed his Mercury contract.

Though Cash would never have another chart hit from 1991 until his death (one of many older country acts to be derailed by changes in the industry that year), his career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity with an audience which was not traditionally considered interested in country music. In 1988, British post-punk musicians [[Marc Riley]] (formerly of [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]) and [[Jon Langford]] ([[the Mekons]]) put together '''Til Things Are Brighter'', a [[tribute album]] featuring mostly British-based indie-rock acts' interpretations of Cash's songs. Cash was enthusiastic about the project, telling Langford that it was a "morale booster"; Rosanne Cash later said "he felt a real connection with those musicians and very validated ... It was very good for him: he was in his element. He absolutely understood what they were tapping into, and loved it". The album attracted press attention on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/28/johnny-cash-indie-1980s-resurrection |title=The Resurrection of Johnny Cash |last=Thomson |first=Graeme |date=28 April 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=9 April 2018}}</ref> In 1991, he sang a version of "Man in Black" for the [[Christian punk]] band [[One Bad Pig]]'s album ''I Scream Sunday''. In 1993, he sang "The Wanderer", the closing track of [[U2]]'s album ''[[Zooropa]]''. According to ''Rolling Stone'' writer Adam Gold, "The Wanderer" – written for Cash by Bono, "defies both the U2 and Cash canons, combining rhythmic and textural elements of Nineties synth-pop with a Countrypolitan lament fit for the closing credits of a Seventies western."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Gold |first1=Adam |title=How U2 Fell in Love with Nashville and Influenced Today's Country Music |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/features/inside-u2s-love-affair-with-nashville-country-music-w491992 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=February 26, 2019 |date=July 13, 2017}}</ref>

No longer sought-after by major labels, he was offered a contract with producer [[Rick Rubin]]'s [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]] label, which had recently been rebranded from Def American, under which name it was better known for rap and [[hard rock]]. Under Rubin's supervision, he recorded ''[[American Recordings (album)|American Recordings]]'' (1994) in his living room, accompanied only by his Martin Dreadnought guitar&nbsp;– one of many Cash played throughout his career.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.fretbase.com/fretbase/2008/08/the-guitars-of.html |website=Fretbase.com |title=The Guitars of Johnny Cash |date=August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001225814/http://www.fretbase.com/fretbase/2008/08/the-guitars-of.html |archive-date=October 1, 2008 }}</ref> The album featured covers of contemporary artists selected by Rubin including "Down There by the Train" by [[Tom Waits]]. The album had a great deal of critical and commercial success, winning a Grammy for [[Best Contemporary Folk Album]]. Cash wrote that his reception at the 1994 [[Glastonbury Festival]] was one of the highlights of his career. This was the beginning of a decade of music industry accolades and commercial success. He teamed up with [[Brooks & Dunn]] to contribute "Folsom Prison Blues" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. On the same album, he performed the Bob Dylan favorite "[[Forever Young (Bob Dylan song)|Forever Young]]."

Cash and his wife appeared on a number of episodes of the television series ''Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman''. He also lent his voice for a [[cameo role]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)]]", as the "Space Coyote" that guides [[Homer Simpson]] on a spiritual quest.

Cash was joined by guitarist [[Kim Thayil]] of [[Soundgarden]], bassist [[Krist Novoselic]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and drummer [[Sean Kinney]] of [[Alice in Chains]] for a cover of [[Willie Nelson]]'s "[[Red Headed Stranger|Time of the Preacher]]", featured on the tribute album ''Twisted Willie'', released in January 1996.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-27/entertainment/ca-29172_1_willie-nelson |title=ALBUM REVIEWS / POP : 'Twisted Willie' Gives Nelson Grunge Honors Treatment |last=Hochman |first=Steve |date=January 27, 1996 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Twisted Willie">{{Cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Twisted-Willie/release/1562651 |title=Various – Twisted Willie |website=Discogs |access-date=August 1, 2018}}</ref>

In 1996, Cash enlisted the accompaniment of [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] and released ''[[Unchained (Johnny Cash album)|Unchained]]'' (also known as ''American Recordings II''), which won the [[Best Country Album]] Grammy in 1998. The album was produced by Rick Rubin with [[Sylvia Massy]] engineering and mixing. A majority of ''Unchained'' was recorded at [[Sound City Studios]] and featured guest appearances by [[Lindsey Buckingham]], [[Mick Fleetwood]], and [[Marty Stuart]]. Believing he did not explain enough of himself in his 1975 autobiography ''Man in Black'', he wrote ''Cash: The Autobiography'' in 1997.

In 1997, during a trip to New York City, Cash was diagnosed with the [[neurodegenerative]] disease [[Shy–Drager syndrome]], a form of [[multiple system atrophy]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Cash: The Autobiography |url=https://archive.org/details/cashautobiograph00cash |url-access=registration |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny |last2=Carr |first2=Patrick |date=1998 |orig-year=1997  |isbn=0061013579 |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cashautobiograph00cash/page/400 400–403] |author-link=Johnny Cash}}</ref> According to biographer Robert Hilburn, the disease was originally misdiagnosed as [[Parkinson's disease]], and Cash even announced to his audience that he had Parkinson's after nearly collapsing on stage in [[Flint, Michigan]], on October 25, 1997. Soon afterwards, his diagnosis was changed to Shy–Drager, and Cash was told he had about 18 months to live.<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''. New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2013, pp. 568–570</ref> The diagnosis was later again altered to [[Dysautonomia|autonomic neuropathy]] associated with [[diabetes]]. The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe [[pneumonia]], which damaged his lungs.

During the last stage of his career, Cash released the albums ''[[American III: Solitary Man]]'' (2000) and ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]'' (2002). ''American IV'' included [[Cover version|cover songs]] by several late 20th-century rock artists, notably "[[Hurt (Johnny Cash song)|Hurt]]" by [[Nine Inch Nails]] and "[[Personal Jesus]]" by [[Depeche Mode]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1331-american-iv-the-man-comes-around/|title=Johnny Cash, ''American IV: The Man Comes Around''|last=Carr|first=Eric|date=November 7, 2002|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=May 12, 2017}}</ref> [[Trent Reznor]] of Nine Inch Nails commented that he was initially skeptical about Cash's plan to cover "Hurt", but was later impressed and moved by the rendition.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=11 |title=Geoff Rickly interviews Trent Reznor |magazine=Alternative Press |date=2004-06-26 |access-date=2017-10-15 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015203101/http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=11 |archive-date=October 15, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The video for "Hurt" received critical and popular acclaim, including a Grammy Award.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 30 All-TIME Best Music Videos – Johnny Cash, Hurt|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085389_2085359_2085375,00.html|work=Time|access-date=August 19, 2011|first=Glen|last=Levy| date=July 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Music Videos|url=https://www.nme.com/list/100-greatest-music-videos/217342/page/10|publisher=[[NME]]|access-date=15 December 2012|date=2011-06-02}}</ref>

He even performed surprise shows at the [[Carter Family Fold]] outside [[Bristol, Virginia]]. At the July 5, 2003, concert (his last public performance), before singing "Ring of Fire", Cash read a statement that he had written shortly before taking the stage:

{{quote|The spirit of June Carter overshadows me tonight with the love she had for me and the love I have for her. We connect somewhere between here and Heaven. She came down for a short visit, I guess, from Heaven to visit with me tonight to give me courage and inspiration like she always has. She's never been one for me except courage and inspiration. I thank God for June Carter. I love her with all my heart.}}

Cash continued to record until shortly before his death. "When June died, it tore him up," Rick Rubin recalled. "He said to me, 'You have to keep me working because I will die if I don't have something to do.' He was in a wheelchair by then and we set him up at his home in Virginia… I couldn't listen to those recordings for two years after he died and it was heartbreaking when we did."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=The Q Interview: Rick Rubin|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=October 2009|page=98}}</ref> Cash's final recordings were made on August 21, 2003, and consisted of "Like the 309", which appeared on ''[[American V: A Hundred Highways]]'' in 2006, and the final song he completed, "Engine 143", recorded for his son John Carter Cash's planned Carter Family tribute album.<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''.

While being hospitalized at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, Cash died of complications from [[diabetes]] around 2:00&nbsp;am CT on September 12, 2003, aged 71—less than four months after his wife. He was buried next to her in [[Hendersonville Memory Gardens]] near his home in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]].

On July 18, 1951, while in Air Force [[basic training]], Cash met 17-year-old Italian-American [[Vivian Liberto]] at a roller skating rink in [[San Antonio, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Why Hate Groups Went After Johnny Cash in the 1960s |url=https://www.history.com/news/why-hate-groups-went-after-johnny-cash-in-the-1960s |website=History |access-date=November 7, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> They dated for three weeks until Cash was deployed to [[West Germany]] for a three-year tour. During that time, the couple exchanged hundreds of love letters.{{Sfn|Turner|2004|pp=43–44}} On August 7, 1954, one month after his discharge, they were married at St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church in San Antonio. The [[Wedding Mass]] was offered by Vivian's uncle, a Catholic priest named Father Vincent Liberto. They had four daughters: [[Rosanne Cash|Rosanne]], Kathy, [[Cindy Cash|Cindy]], and Tara. In 1961, Cash moved his family to a hilltop home overlooking [[Casitas Springs, California]]. He had previously moved his parents to the area to run a small trailer park called the Johnny Cash Trailer Park. His drinking led to several run-ins with local law enforcement. Liberto later said that she had filed for divorce in 1966 because of Cash's severe drug and alcohol abuse, as well as his constant touring, his repeated acts of adultery with other women, and his close relationship with singer [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]]. Their four daughters were then raised by their mother. 

Cash met June of the famed [[Carter Family]] while on tour, and the two became infatuated with each other. In 1968, 13 years after they first met backstage at the [[Grand Ole Opry]], Cash proposed to June, during a live performance in [[London, Ontario]].<ref>{{Citation|place=London, UK|last=Sweeting|first=Adam|date=September 12, 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/sep/12/johnnycash|type=Obituary|title=Johnny Cash|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=January 26, 2009}}</ref> The couple married on March 1, 1968, in [[Franklin, Kentucky]].

In addition to having his four daughters and John Carter, Cash also became step-father to [[Carlene Carter|Carlene]] and [[Rosie Nix Adams|Rosie]]; June's daughters from her first two marriages. Cash and Carter continued to work, raise their child, create music, and tour together for 35 years until June's death in May 2003. Throughout their marriage, June attempted to keep Cash off [[amphetamines]], often taking his drugs and flushing them down the toilet. June remained with him even throughout his multiple admissions for rehabilitation treatment and decades of [[drug addiction]].  After June's death in 2003, Cash believed that his only reason for living was his music.<ref>Puterbaugh, Parke. "Essential Johnny Cash." ''Rolling Stone'', October 16, 2003: 78.

Cash's daughter Rosanne (by first wife Vivian Liberto) and his son John Carter Cash (by June Carter Cash) are notable musicians in their own right.

Cash nurtured and defended artists (such as Bob Dylan<ref name=pc10 />) on the fringes of what was acceptable in country music even while serving as the country music establishment's most visible symbol. At an all-star concert which aired in 1999 on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], a diverse group of artists paid him tribute, including Dylan, [[Chris Isaak]], [[Wyclef Jean]], [[Norah Jones]], Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, [[Dom DeLuise]], and U2. Cash himself appeared at the end and performed for the first time in more than a year. Two tribute albums were released shortly before his death; ''[[Kindred Spirits: A Tribute to the Songs of Johnny Cash|Kindred Spirits]]'' contains works from established artists, while ''[[Dressed in Black: A Tribute to Johnny Cash|Dressed in Black]]'' contains works from many lesser-known musicians.

In total, he wrote over 1,000 songs and released dozens of albums. A [[box set]] titled ''[[Unearthed (Johnny Cash album)|Unearthed]]'' was issued posthumously. It included four CDs of unreleased material recorded with Rubin, as well as a ''Best of Cash on American'' retrospective CD. The set also includes a 104-page book that discusses each track and features one of Cash's final interviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cash's ''Unearthed'' box set|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/68530/cashs-unearthed-box-set-unveiled|website=billboard|publisher=Billboard Magazine|date=October 22, 2003|access-date=December 11, 2015}}</ref>

Cash received multiple [[Country Music Association Awards]], Grammys, and other awards, in categories ranging from vocal and spoken performances to album notes and videos. In a career that spanned almost five decades, Cash was the personification of country music to many people around the world. Cash was a musician who was not defined by a single genre. He recorded songs that could be considered [[rock and roll]], [[blues]], [[rockabilly]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[gospel music|gospel]], and exerted an influence on each of those genres.

His diversity was evidenced by his presence in five major music halls of fame: the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1977), the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] (1980), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1992), GMA's [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] (2010). and the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]] (2013).<ref>{{Citation|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/Inductees/InducteeDetail/johnny-cash|publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame|title=Inductees|contribution=Johnny Cash}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/johnny-cash|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|title=Inductees|contribution=Johnny Cash}}</ref> Marking his death in 2003, ''Rolling Stone'' stated other than [[Elvis Presley]] Cash was the only artist inducted as a performer into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<ref name="RS Cash">{{cite news |title=Johnny Cash: Remembering the Incomparable Legend of Country, Rock and Roll |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/johnny-cash-remembering-the-incomparable-legend-of-country-rock-and-roll-244037/ |access-date=April 1, 2020 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref>
