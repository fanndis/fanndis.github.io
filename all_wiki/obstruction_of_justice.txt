'''Obstruction of justice''', in United States [[jurisdiction]]s, is a crime consisting of obstructing [[prosecutor]]s, investigators, or other government officials. [[Common law]] jurisdictions other than the United States tend to use the wider offense of [[perverting the course of justice]].

Obstruction is a broad crime that may include acts such as [[perjury]], [[making false statements]] to officials, [[witness tampering]], [[jury tampering]], [[destruction of evidence]], and many others. Obstruction also applies to overt coercion of court or government officials via the means of threats or actual physical harm, and also applying to deliberate [[sedition]] against a court official to undermine the appearance of legitimate authority.{{fact|date=August 2020}}

==Legal overview==
Obstruction of justice is an umbrella term covering a variety of specific crimes.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Affair of State: The Investigation, Impeachment, and Trial of President Clinton|first=Richard A.|last=Posner|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2009|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JFRi1TQgVmQC&pg=PA37|isbn=9780674042322}}</ref> ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines it as any "interference with the orderly administration of law and justice".<ref>{{cite report|title=Obstruction of Justice: An Overview of Some of the Federal Statutes That Prohibit Interference with Judicial, Executive, or Legislative Activities|publisher=Congressional Research Service|first=Charles|last=Doyle|date=April 17, 2014|page=1|url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL34303|access-date=June 17, 2019}}</ref> Obstruction has been categorized by various sources as a [[process crime]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Crime Factory: Process, Pretext, and Criminal Justice|journal=Georgetown Law Journal|first=Erin|last=Murphy|volume=97|page=1437|url=https://its.law.nyu.edu/faculty/profiles/representiveFiles/Erin%20Murphy%20-%20Manufacturing%20Crime%20-%20Process%20Pretext%20and%20Criminal%20Justice_AE4D3270-D95B-BAE7-CB8313F135FF73B2.pdf|access-date=June 19, 2019}}</ref> a [[public-order crime]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Juvenile Delinquency: An Integrated Approach|first1=James|last1=Burfeind|first2=Dawn Jeglum|last2=Bartusch|publisher=Jones & Bartlett|year=2011|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4L1nmmcfwhcC&pg=PA62|isbn=9781449654337}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=All Terms & Definitions|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics|url=https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tda|access-date=June 19, 2019}}</ref> or a [[white-collar crime]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sorting Out White-Collar Crime|journal=Texas Law Review|first=Miriam H.|last=Baer|volume=97|issue=2|page=227|url=https://texaslawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Baer.V97.2.pdf|access-date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>

Obstruction can include crimes committed by [[judge]]s, [[prosecutor]]s, [[Attorney general|attorneys general]], and elected officials in general.

===Federal law===
In federal law, crimes constituting obstruction of justice are defined primarily in Chapter 73 of [[Title 18 of the United States Code]].<ref name=riley>{{cite journal |last1=Riley |first1=Tina M. |title=Tampering with Witness Tampering: Resolving the Quandary Surrounding 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1512 |journal=Washington University Law Review |date=1 January 1999 |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=249–275 |url=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/vol77/iss1/7/ }}</ref><ref>{{usc-title-chap|18|73}}</ref> This chapter contains provisions covering various specific crimes such as [[witness tampering]] and retaliation, [[jury tampering]], [[destruction of evidence]], assault on a [[process server]], and theft of court records.<ref name=decker65>{{cite journal |last1=Decker |first1=John |title=The Varying Parameters of Obstruction of Justice in American Criminal Law |journal=Louisiana Law Review |date=1 November 2004 |volume=65 |issue=1 |url=https://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/lalrev/vol65/iss1/5/ }}</ref> It also includes more general sections covering obstruction of proceedings in [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]], [[United States Congress|Congress]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/877/294/270426/|title=United States of America, Plaintiff-appellee, v.

====Sentencing enhancement====
Under the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]], a defendant convicted of any crime is subject to a more severe sentence if they are found to have obstructed justice by impeding the investigation or prosecution of their crimes.<ref>{{cite book|title=Guidelines Manual|publisher=United States Sentencing Commission|year=2018|url=https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2018/GLMFull.pdf|pages=359–361|access-date=June 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Perjured Statements as a Basis for Sentencing Enhancement |journal=New York Law Review |volume=251 |number=103 |date=May 30, 2014 |first1=Martin |last1=Flumenbaum |first2=Brad S. |last2=Karp |url=https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/almID/1202657200189/ }}</ref> While a separate conviction for the crime of obstruction would require proof [[beyond a reasonable doubt]], a finding of obstruction for sentencing purposes only needs to meet the looser standard of "[[Preponderance of the evidence|a preponderance of the evidence]]" (unless the enhanced sentence would exceed the statutory maximum sentence for the underlying crime).<ref>{{cite report|title=Judicial Fact-Finding and Criminal Sentencing: Current Practice and Potential Change|first=Michael A.|last=Foster|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=August 24, 2018|url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10191|access-date=June 14, 2019}}</ref>

An obstruction finding adds two levels to the offender's sentence, which can result in as much as an additional 68 months of prison.<ref>{{cite report|title=Obstruction of Justice: An Overview of Some of the Federal Statutes That Prohibit Interference with Judicial, Executive, or Legislative Activities|publisher=Congressional Research Service|first=Charles|last=Doyle|date=April 17, 2014|page=79|url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL34303|access-date=June 17, 2019}}</ref> In 2017, the obstruction enhancement was applied in 1,319 cases, representing 2.1 percent of all sentences issued in federal courts.<ref>{{cite report|title=Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics|publisher=U.

===State law===
State laws regarding obstruction of justice vary widely. A 2004 survey found that 24 states and the District of Columbia had a general statute criminalizing obstruction of justice or obstruction of government functions in broad terms, similar to those found in federal law.<ref name="decker65"/> All states have laws prohibiting some specific types of obstruction, such as witness tampering, jury tampering, or destruction of evidence.<ref name="decker65"/>

==History==
From the creation of the federal courts by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], judges had the power to summarily punish those who obstructed justice by holding them in [[contempt of court]].<ref name=venue>{{cite journal |title=Criminal Venue in the Federal Courts: The Obstruction of Justice Puzzle |journal=Michigan Law Review |volume=82 |issue=1 |year=1983 |pages=98–99 |jstor=1288587 }}</ref><ref name=fitzpatrick>{{cite journal |last1=Fitzpatrick |first1=James |title=The Supreme Court's Bipolar Approach to the Interpretation of 18 U.S.C. 1503 and 18 U.S.C. 2232(c) |journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |date=1 January 1996 |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=1383 |url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol86/iss4/7/ |doi=10.2307/1144062 |jstor=1144062 }}</ref>

A scandal in 1830 led to reform of the contempt law and the creation of obstruction of justice as a separate offense. Federal judge [[James H. Peck]] imprisoned a lawyer for contempt for publishing a letter criticizing one of Peck's opinions. In an effort to prevent such abuses, Congress passed a law in 1831 limiting the application of the summary contempt procedures to offenses committed in or near the court. A new section, which survives today as the Omnibus Clause, was added to punish contempts committed outside of the court, but only after [[indictment]] and [[trial by jury]].<ref name=venue /><ref name=fitzpatrick />

In 1982, in response to concerns that the obstruction law did not provide adequate protection to crime victims and other witnesses, Congress broadened the law against witness tampering and criminalized retaliation against witnesses, as part of the Victim and Witness Protection Act.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Riley |first1=Tina M. |title=Tampering with Witness Tampering: Resolving the Quandary Surrounding 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1512 |journal=Washington University Law Review |date=1 January 1999 |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=249–275 |url=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/vol77/iss1/7/ }}</ref>

The [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] of 2002 strengthened the obstruction laws regarding destruction of evidence before an investigation or proceeding has begun, in response to accounting firm [[Arthur Andersen]]'s widely reported shredding of documents related to the [[Enron scandal]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=Dana |title=Anticipatory Obstruction of Justice: Pre-Emptive Document Destruction under the Sarbanes-Oxley Anti-Shredding Statute, 18 U.S.C. 1519 |journal=Cornell Law Review |date=1 January 2004 |volume=89 |issue=6 |pages=1519 |url=https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol89/iss6/4/ }}</ref>
