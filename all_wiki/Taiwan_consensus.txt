The '''Taiwan consensus''' ({{zh|c=台灣共識|p=Táiwān gòngshí|poj=Tâi-oân kiōng-sek}}) is a Taiwanese political term, which was coined in August 2011 by [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) chair [[Tsai Ing-wen]], and is intended to replace the "[[1992 consensus]]", which was the basis of DPP's negotiations between [[Taiwan]] and the [[mainland China]] until now.<ref name="Taipei">[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/08/24/2003511508 "Tsai details DPP’s cross-strait policies"], ''Taipei Times'', 2011-08-24, retrieved 6 January 2013.</ref>

== History ==
The term appeared first in August 2011, when DPP chair Tsai Ing-wen disclosed the point "National Security Strategy and the development of cross-strait trade" ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=國家安全戰略篇與兩岸經貿發展篇}}) at the "ten years platform" ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=十年政綱}}).<ref>[http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2011/new/aug/24/today-t1.htm "蔡：無92共識 推台灣共識"], (in Chinese), ''[[Liberty Times]]'', 2011-8-24, retrieved 6 January 2013.</ref> Through the concept of Taiwan consensus, [[Tsai Ing-wen]] directly competes with President [[Ma Ying-jeou]]'s political views for the [[2012 Republic of China presidential election]].

== Meaning ==
Tsai believes that the 1992 consensus is solely based on the [[One-China policy]] and the desire to preserve it. The DPP further states, that a "consensus" among the Taiwanese people about the "1992 consensus" does not exist.<ref name="Taipei" /><ref>[http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?ID=201108250004&Type=aOPN "Liberty Times: Time to formulate 'Taiwan consensus'"], ''Focus Taiwan News Channel'', 2011-08-25, retrieved 6 January 2013</ref> The DPP hopes to get a "Taiwan Consensus" (a consensus amongst the people) to displace the 1992 consensus, which would be ratified by legislation and a referendum. This new consensus should then form the basis for negotiations with the PRC.

Tsai states further that the Taiwan consensus "is not an ordinary problem to be decided by majority", "is not an ordinary legislation or public issue" and "not even a purely domestic problem." Because Taiwan is domestically not united with China and has no consensus on the direction towards China, the Taiwanese government has no basis for negotiations with China. She hopes, that through democratic processes and the [[Legislative Yuan]] "with all different political views [we] can find common ground", "[because] that is the true spirit of the Taiwan consensus".
