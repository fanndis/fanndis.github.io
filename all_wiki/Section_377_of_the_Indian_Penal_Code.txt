'''Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code''' is <!-- We do not use the early tense because the provision still exists --> a section of the [[Indian Penal Code]] introduced in 1861 during the [[British rule of India]]. Modelled on the [[Buggery Act 1533|Buggery Act of 1533]], it makes sexual activities "against the order of nature" illegal. On 6 September 2018, the [[Supreme Court of India]] ruled that the application of [[Section 377]] to consensual [[Homosexuality|homosexual sex]] between adults was unconstitutional, "irrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-decriminalises-homosexuality/article24887363.ece|title=SC decriminalises homosexuality|first=Krishnadas|last=Rajagopal|date=7 September 2018|via=www.thehindu.com|newspaper=The Hindu}}</ref> but that Section 377 remains in force relating to sex with [[Minor (law)|minors]], [[Sexual consent|non-consensual]] sexual acts, and [[bestiality]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pundir |first1=Pallavi |title=I Am What I Am.

In 2008 Additional [[Solicitor General of India|Solicitor General]] PP Malhotra said: "Homosexuality is a social vice and the state has the power to contain it. [Decriminalising homosexuality] may create [a] breach of peace. If it is allowed then [the] evil of AIDS and HIV would further spread and harm the people. It would lead to a big health hazard and degrade moral values of society." This view was shared by the Home Ministry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/HC+pulls+up+government+for+homosexuality+doublespeak/1/16228.html|title=HC pulls up government for homosexuality doublespeak|date=26 September 2008|website=India Today}}</ref>

11 December 2013 judgement of the Supreme Court, upholding Section 377 was met with support from religious leaders. The Daily News and Analysis called it "the univocal unity of religious leaders in expressing their homophobic attitude. Usually divisive and almost always seen tearing down each other’s religious beliefs, leaders across sections came forward in decrying homosexuality and expressing their solidarity with the judgement."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-rare-unity-religious-leaders-come-out-in-support-of-section-377-1933612|title=Rare unity: Religious leaders come out in support of Section 377 |date=12 December 2013|website=DNAIndia.com|access-date=30 December 2017}}</ref> The ''Daily News and Analysis'' article added that Baba [[Ramdev]], India's well-known yoga guru, after praying that journalists not "turn homosexual", stated he could "cure" homosexuality through yoga and called it "a bad addiction". The [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]]'s vice-president Om Prakash Singhal said, "This is a right decision, we welcome it. Homosexuality is against Indian culture, against nature and against science. We are regressing, going back to when we were almost like animals. The SC had protected our culture."  The article states that Singhal further went to dismiss HIV/AIDS concerns within the LGBT community as, "It is understood that when you try to suppress one anomaly, there will be a break-out of a few more." (Traditionally, Indian culture, or at least Hinduism, has [[LGBT topics and Hinduism|been more ambivalent about homosexuality]] than Singhal suggests.)
Maulana Madni of the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind|Jamiat Ulema]] echoes this in the article, stating that "[[LGBT in Islam|Homosexuality is a crime according to scriptures]] and is unnatural. People cannot consider themselves to be exclusive of a society... In a society, a family is made up of a man and a woman, not a woman and a woman, or a man and a man." Rabbi [[Ezekiel Isaac Malekar|Ezekiel Issac Malekar]], honorary secretary of the Judah Hyam Synagogue, in upholding the judgment was also quoted as saying "In Judaism, our scriptures do not permit homosexuality." Reverend Paul Swarup of the [[Cathedral Church of the Redemption]] in Delhi in stating his views on what he believes to be the unnaturalness of homosexuality, stated "Spiritually, human sexual relations are identified as those shared by a man and a woman. The Supreme Court’s view is an endorsement of our scriptures."

The [[United Nations]] said that the ban violates international law. United Nations human rights chief [[Navi Pillay]] stated that "Criminalising private, consensual same-sex sexual conduct violates the rights to privacy and to non-discrimination enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which India has ratified", and that the decision "represents a significant step backwards for India and a blow for human rights.", voicing hope that the Court might exercise its review procedure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/india-rights-gay-un/ban-on-gay-sex-violates-international-law-u-n-idINDEE9BB04N20131212|title=Ban on gay sex violates international law |date=12 December 2013|website=Reuters|access-date=4 November 2017}}</ref>

After the 2013 verdict, the [[Aam Aadmi Party]] put on their website:

<blockquote>The Aam Aadmi party is disappointed with the judgment of the Supreme Court upholding the Section 377 of the IPC and reversing the landmark judgment of the Delhi High Court on the subject. The Supreme Court judgment thus criminalises the personal behaviour of consenting adults. All those who are born with or choose a different sexual orientation would thus be placed at the mercy of the police. This not only violates the human rights of such individuals, but goes against the liberal values of our Constitution, and the spirit of our times. Aam Aadmi Party hopes and expects that the Supreme Court will review this judgment and that the Parliament will also step in to repeal this archaic law.<ref name=":1" /></blockquote>

Their historic publication ''Less than Gay: A Citizen's Report'', spelt out the problems with 377 and asked for its repeal. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120406222219/http://archive.epw.in/data/PDF/001189_EPW_3_2_1996_Vol_XXXI_No_5/COMMENTARY_Gay%20Rights%20in%20India.pdf A 1996 article in Economic and Political Weekly by Vimal Balasubrahmanyan titled 'Gay Rights In India'] chronicles this early history.  As the case prolonged over the years, it was revived in the next decade, led by the [[Naz Foundation (India) Trust]], an activist group, which filed a [[public interest litigation]] in the [[Delhi High Court]] in 2001, seeking legalisation of homosexual intercourse between consenting adults.<ref name="Chronology">{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/chronology-8yearlong-legal-battle-for-gay-rights/96152-3.html|title=Chronology: 8-year-long legal battle for gay rights|publisher=CNN-IBN|access-date=2 July 2009}}</ref> The Naz Foundation worked with a legal team from the [[Lawyers Collective]] to engage in court.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legallyindia.com/2009070276/News/lawyers-collective-overturns-anti-gay-law |title=Lawyers Collective overturns anti-gay law |author=Kian Ganz  |date=2 July 2009 |website=[[legallyindia.com]] |access-date=9 April 2011}}</ref> In 2003, the [[Delhi High Court]] refused to consider a petition regarding the legality of the law, saying that the petitioners, had no ''[[locus standi]]'' in the matter. Since nobody had been prosecuted in the recent past under this section it seemed unlikely that the section would be struck down as illegal by the Delhi High Court in the absence of a petitioner with standing. Naz Foundation appealed to the Supreme Court against the decision of the High Court to dismiss the petition on technical grounds. The Supreme Court decided that Naz Foundation had the standing to file a PIL in this case and sent the case back to the Delhi High Court to reconsider it on merit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.rediff.com/news/2006/feb/03gay.htm?q=tp&file=.htm|title=Gay Rights is matter of Public Interest: SC|publisher=Rediff News|date=3 February 2006|author=Sheela Bhatt|access-date=7 July 2009}}</ref> Subsequently, there was a significant intervention in the case by a Delhi-based coalition of LGBT, women's and human rights activists called 'Voices Against 377', which supported the demand to 'read down' section 377 to exclude adult consensual sex from within its purview.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-05-20/india/27743991_1_decriminalise-homosexuality-gay-couple-pil-on-gay-rights|title=Delhi HC to take up PIL on LGBT rights|publisher=The Times of India|date=20 May 2008|author=Shibu Thomas|access-date=7 July 2009}}</ref>

There was support from others like Sunil Mehra, a notable journalist. He was in a committed relationship with [[Navtej Singh Johar]] and drew from his personal experiences while protesting. [[Ritu Dalmia]] also demonstrated keen activism. [[Aman Nath]], a writer, historian, and hotelier, also fought for the decriminalisation of Section 377. He had a relationship with Francis Wacziarg for 23 years until Wacziarg passed away.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/section-377-the-famous-and-fearless-5-who-convinced-sc/articleshow/62421886.cms|title=Section 377: The famous and fearless 5 who convinced SC - Times of India ►|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref> Ayesha Kapur became successful within a decade of working in a nascent e-commerce sector.

In May 2008, the case came up for hearing in the Delhi High Court, but the Government was undecided on its position, with The Ministry of Home Affairs maintaining a contradictory position to that of The Ministry of Health on the issue of enforcement of Section 377 with respect to homosexuality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1165375|title=Centre divided on punishment of homosexuality|publisher=DNA}}</ref> On 7 November 2008, the seven-year-old petition finished hearings.

Eventually, in a historic judgement delivered on 2 July 2009, Delhi High Court overturned the 150-year-old section,<ref name="CNNIBN">{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/delhi-high-court-legalises-consensual-gay-sex/96148-3.html|title=Delhi High Court legalises consensual gay sex|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|access-date=2 July 2009}}</ref> legalising consensual homosexual activities between adults.<ref name=BBC1>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8129836.stm|title=Gay sex decriminalised in India|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=2 July 2009 | date=2 July 2009}}</ref> The essence of the section goes against the fundamental right of human citizens, stated the high court while striking it down. In a 105-page judgement, a bench of Chief Justice [[Ajit Prakash Shah]] and Justice [[S. Muralidhar]] said that if not amended, section 377 of the IPC would violate Article 14 of the Indian constitution, which states that every citizen has equal opportunity of life and is equal before law.

The two-judge bench went on to hold that:
{{cquote|If there is one constitutional tenet that can be said to be underlying theme of the Indian Constitution, it is that of 'inclusiveness'. This Court believes that Indian Constitution reflects this value deeply ingrained in Indian society, nurtured over several generations. The inclusiveness that Indian society traditionally displayed, literally in every aspect of life, is manifest in recognising a role in society for everyone. Those perceived by the majority as 'deviants' or 'different' are not on that score excluded or ostracised.

Where society can display inclusiveness and understanding, such persons can be assured of a life of dignity and non-discrimination.
This was the 'spirit behind the Resolution' of which Nehru spoke so passionately. In our view, Indian Constitutional law does not permit the statutory criminal law to be held captive by the popular misconceptions of who the LGBTs are. It cannot be forgotten that discrimination is antithesis of equality and that it is the recognition of equality which will foster the dignity of every individual.<ref name="Judgement">{{cite web|url=http://lobis.nic.in/dhc/APS/judgement/02-07-2009/APS02072009CW74552001.pdf|title=Naz Foundation v.

The court stated that the judgement would hold until Parliament chose to amend the law. However, the judgement keeps intact the provisions of Section 377 insofar as it applies to non-consensual non-vaginal intercourse and intercourse with minors.<ref name="CNNIBN"/>

=== 2017 Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs Union Of India and Ors. ===
{{Main|Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs Union Of India And Ors.}}
On 24 August 2017, the Supreme Court of India held that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right protected under Article 21 and Part III of the Indian Constitution. The judgement mentioned Section 377 as a "discordant note which directly bears upon the evolution of the constitutional jurisprudence on the right to privacy." In the judgement delivered by the 9-judge bench, [[Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud|Justice Chandrachud]] (who authored for Justices [[Jagdish Singh Khehar|Khehar]], [[Rajesh Kumar Agrawal|Agarwal]], [[S. Abdul Nazeer|Abdul Nazeer]] and himself), held that the rationale behind the Suresh Koushal (2013) Judgement is incorrect, and the judges clearly expressed their disagreement with it. [[Sanjay Kishan Kaul|Justice Kaul]] agreed with Justice Chandrachud's view that the right of privacy cannot be denied, even if there is a minuscule fraction of the population which is affected. He further went on to state that the majoritarian concept does not apply to Constitutional rights and the courts are often called upon to take what may be categorized as a non-majoritarian view, in the check and balance of power envisaged under the Constitution of India.<ref name=":2" />

<blockquote><poem>Sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy. Discrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual. Equality demands that the sexual orientation of each individual in society must be protected on an even platform. The right to privacy and the protection of sexual orientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution.<ref name=":2" />

...Their rights are not "so-called" but are real rights founded on sound constitutional doctrine. They inhere in the right to life. They dwell in privacy and dignity. They constitute the essence of liberty and freedom. Sexual orientation is an essential component of identity. Equal protection demands protection of the identity of every individual without discrimination.<ref name=":2" /></poem></blockquote>

However, as the curative petition (challenging Section 377) is currently sub-judice, the judges authored that they would leave the constitutional validity to be decided in an appropriate proceeding. Many legal experts have suggested that with this judgement, the judges have invalidated the reasoning behind the 2013 Judgement, thus laying the ground-work for Section 377 to be read down and the restoration of the 2009 Judgement of the High Court, thereby decriminalizing homosexual sex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livelaw.in/privacy-bench-affirms-lgbt-rights-disagrees-with-suresh-koushal-judgment-on-377-ipc/|title=Legal experts on 377 and Right to Privacy|access-date=24 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/target-section-377/article19563070.ece|title=The Hindu on 377 and Right to Privacy}}</ref>

In 2018, the five-judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court consisting of chief justice Dipak Misra and justices Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Ajay Manikrao Khanwilkar, Indu Malhotra, and Rohinton Fali Nariman started hearing the challenge to constitutionality of Section 377. The Union Government did not take a position on the issue and left it to the "wisdom of the court" to decide on Section 377. The  petitioners invoked the right to sexual privacy, dignity, right against discrimination and freedom of expression to argue against the constitutionality of Section 377. After hearing the petitioners' plea for four days, the court reserved its verdict on 17 July 2018.
