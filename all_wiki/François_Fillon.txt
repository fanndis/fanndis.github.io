'''François Charles Armand Fillon''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swa ʃaʁl aʁmɑ̃ fijɔ̃}}; born 4 March 1954) is a retired French politician who served as [[Prime Minister of France]] from 2007 to 2012 under President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_attente/salle_de_presse/communique_concernant_la_nommination_du_premier_ministre.76689.html |title=Communiqué de la Présidence de la République concernant la nomination du Premier ministre |publisher=[[Élysée Palace]] |date=17 May 2007 |access-date=17 May 2007 |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519071357/http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_attente/salle_de_presse/communique_concernant_la_nommination_du_premier_ministre.76689.html |archive-date=19 May 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name="decret premier ministre">{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000649193 |title=Décret du 17 mai 2007 portant nomination du Premier ministre |language=fr |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |access-date=4 August 2010}}</ref> He was the nominee of [[The Republicans (France)|the Republicans]] (previously known as the [[Union for a Popular Movement]]), the country's largest centre-right political party, for the [[2017 French presidential election|2017 presidential election]].

Fillon became [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]'s [[Minister of Social Affairs (France)|Minister of Labour]] in 2002 and undertook controversial reforms of the [[35-hour workweek|35-hour working week]] law and of the French retirement system. In 2004, as [[Minister of National Education (France)|Minister of National Education]] he proposed the much debated [[Fillon law, 2005|Fillon law on Education]].

In 2005, Fillon was elected [[Senate (France)|Senator]] for the [[Sarthe]] department. His role as a political advisor in [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]'s successful race for President led to his becoming Prime Minister in 2007. Fillon resigned upon Sarkozy's defeat by [[François Hollande]] in the [[2012 French presidential election|2012 presidential elections]].

Running on a platform described as conservative,<ref>{{cite web|title=2017 : pourquoi François Fillon est une menace pour le FN|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/elections/presidentielles/2016/11/29/35003-20161129ARTFIG00314-pourquoi-francois-fillon-est-une-menace-pour-le-fn.php|access-date=30 November 2016}}</ref> Fillon entered the [[The Republicans (France) presidential primary, 2016|2016 Republican presidential primary]]. He placed first in the first round on 20 November, defeating [[Alain Juppé]] in the primary run-off a week later. Following his victory in the primary, opinion polls showed Fillon as one of the frontrunners for the [[2017 French presidential election|2017 presidential election]] along with [[Marine Le Pen]] ([[National Front (France)|FN]]) and [[Emmanuel Macron]] ([[La République En Marche!|EM]]). In March 2017, François Fillon became one of the first candidates of the most important French party to be formally charged in a widening embezzlement investigation due to allegations "that he had paid his wife and children hundreds of thousands of euros from the public payroll for little or no work" in a case that became known as "[[Fillon affair|Penelopegate]]". In April, he finally came third in the first round with 20%.

In 2020, he was convicted of fraud and misuse of funds, and sentenced to five years in prison (three of them suspended). He has appealed the sentence.

The day after [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] became President he appointed Fillon as Prime Minister of France, charging him with the task of forming a new cabinet, which was announced on 18 May 2007.<ref>[http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/interventions/2007/mai/composition_du_gouvernement.77059.html Communiqué de la Présidence de la République concernant la composition du gouvernement de M.

Following the defeat of Nicolas Sarkozy to François Hollande in the [[2012 French presidential election|2012 presidential election]], Fillon resigned on 10 May. Following the inauguration of Hollande as President on 15 May 2012,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/70068/1/blogs.lse.ac.uk-Fillon%20vs%20Jupp%C3%A9%20What%20policy%20differences%20are%20there%20between%20the%20French%20centre-rights%20candidates.pdf|title=Fillon vs Juppé: What policy differences are there between the French centre-right’s candidates?|website=eprints.lse.ac.uk}}</ref> [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]], Mayor of [[Nantes]], was appointed to succeed Fillon as Prime Minister.

===UMP presidential election===
Aiming at building consensus within the diverging views at the UMP after Francois Hollande's victory in the French presidential elections in 2012, Fillon declared his candidacy to become the President of the UMP party. On the day of the vote, both candidates (Fillon and [[Jean-François Copé]]) claimed victory and accused the other of cheating. This led to a major political crisis within the party with votes being recounted twice and Copé finally being declared winner.

Fillon threatened to split from UMP unless new elections were organised. In December 2012, Copé agreed to organising elections in 2013, thus putting an end to the crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2012/12/18/l-accord-a-l-ump-decrypte_1807849_823448.html|title=UMP : l'accord entre Fillon et Copé décrypté|first=Samuel Laurent et Jonathan|last=Parienté|date=18 December 2012|work=Le Monde}}</ref>

===Presidential bid===
Fillon entered the [[The Republicans (France) presidential primary, 2016|2016 Republican presidential primary]], held on 20 November 2016, and seemed a likely third as late as a week before the vote.<ref name=guardian21112016>Willsher, Kim, and Matthew Weaver, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/21/who-is-francois-fillon-the-man-who-ended-sarkozys-dream "Who is François Fillon – the man who ended Sarkozy's dream?"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 November 2016. Retrieved 21 November 2016.</ref> In early counting, Fillon emerged as the clear frontrunner, with [[Alain Juppé]] in second place. Third place Sarkozy conceded, bringing his support to Fillon, and Fillon and Juppé went into the run-off on 27 November 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2bbff644-af60-11e6-9c37-5787335499a0 |title=Fillon shakes up France's unpredictable presidential race |date=20 November 2016 |access-date=20 November 2016}}</ref> Juppé conceded to Fillon, pledging his support for him as the Republican nominee in the [[2017 French presidential election|2017 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite news|title=France's Juppe concedes defeat, backs Fillon in presidential election|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-idUSKBN13M001?il=0|agency=Reuters|date=27 November 2016}}</ref>

As of November 2016, Fillon was seen as the frontrunner for the Presidency against the Socialist candidate [[Benoît Hamon]], [[Emmanuel Macron]] and [[Marine Le Pen]]. However, a series of revelations of political scandals at the end of January shattered his presidential bid, being outed of the second round behind Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron in polls. Fillon's visits on the ground then attracted far-left protesters to destabilise his campaign. The news provocated consternation in Germany where Fillon was seen as a serious and trusted candidate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/879eeb24-b4dc-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62|title=Subscribe to read &#124; Financial Times|website=www.ft.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lepoint.fr/presidentielle/l-affaire-fillon-vue-d-allemagne-07-02-2017-2102924_3121.php|title=L'affaire Fillon vue d'Allemagne|first=Pascale|last=Hugues|date=7 February 2017|website=Le Point}}</ref>

On 23 April 2017, he secured 20.0% of the votes at the first round of the French presidential election, arriving third, and failing to enter the runoff.
