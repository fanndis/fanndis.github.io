The '''Arizona Senate''' is part of the [[Arizona Legislature]], the [[state legislature (United States)|state legislature]] of the US state of [[Arizona]]. The Senate consists of 30 members each representing an average of 219,859 constituents (2009 figures). Members serve two-year terms with [[term limits]] that limit Senators to four terms for a total of eight years. Members of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] are currently the majority in the Senate.

As with the [[Arizona House of Representatives]], members to the Senate are elected from the same legislative districts as House members, however one Senator represents the constituency, while for the House there are two Representatives per district. This districting system is similar to those of the [[Idaho Senate|Idaho]] and [[Washington State Senate]]. In political science, this type of legislative district is called a [[multi-member district]].

Like other upper houses of state and territorial legislatures and the federal [[U.S. Senate]], the Senate can confirm or reject [[Governor of Arizona|gubernatorial]] appointments to the state cabinet, commissions and boards.

The Senate convenes in the adjacent legislative chambers at the [[Arizona State Capitol]] in  [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].

==Leadership of the Senate==
[[Arizona]], along with [[Oregon]], [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[Wyoming]], is one of the five U.S. states to have abolished the Office of the [[Lieutenant Governor]], the nominal senate president in many states.  As a result, the Senate elects its own presiding officer, the [[President of the Senate]], who presides over the body, appoints members to all of the Senate's committees and to joint committees, and may create other committees and subcommittees if desired. The Senate President also appoints a [[President pro tempore]], who serves for the duration of a session of the legislature, to preside in their absence, and may appoint a temporary President pro tempore in the absence of the President and President pro tempore.<ref>[http://www.azsenate.gov/srules.htm#rule2 Senate Rule 2: The President]</ref>

The current President of the Senate is Republican [[Karen Fann]] of District 1, the Senate [[Majority Leader]] is [[Rick Gray (Arizona politician)|Rick Gray]] of District 21. The current [[Minority Leader]] is [[David Bradley (politician)|David Bradley]] of District 10 with [[Lupe Contreras]] of District 19 as the Assistant Minority Leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov/MemberRoster.asp?Body=S|title=Member Roster|accessdate=February 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116233034/https://www.azleg.gov/MemberRoster.asp?Body=S|archive-date=November 16, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
