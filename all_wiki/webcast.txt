A '''webcast''' is a media presentation distributed over the Internet using [[streaming media]] technology to distribute a single content source to many simultaneous listeners/viewers. A webcast may either be distributed live or on demand. Essentially, webcasting is "[[broadcasting]]" over the Internet.

The largest "webcasters" include existing radio and TV stations, who "[[simulcast]]" their output through online TV or online radio streaming, as well as a multitude of Internet only "stations". Webcasting usually consists of providing non-interactive linear streams or events. Rights and licensing bodies offer specific "webcasting licenses" to those wishing to carry out Internet broadcasting using copyrighted material.

==Overview==
Webcasting is used extensively in the commercial sector for investor relations [[presentation]]s (such as annual general meetings), in [[e-learning]] (to transmit [[seminar]]s), and for related communications activities. However, webcasting does not bear much, if any, relationship to [[web conferencing]], which is designed for many-to-many interaction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.inxpo.com/casting-calls/bid/112104/Webcasting-101-Planning-and-Executing-High-Quality-Webcasts|title=Webcasting 101: Planning and Executing High Quality Webcasts|last=Shiao|first=Dennis|date=26 December 2012|publisher=INXPO|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>

The ability to webcast using cheap/accessible technology has allowed [[independent media]] to flourish.  There are many notable independent shows that [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] regularly online. Often produced by average citizens in their homes they cover many interests and topics. Webcasts relating to computers, [[technology]], and news are particularly popular and many new shows are added regularly.

Webcasting differs from [[podcast]]ing in that webcasting refers to live streaming while podcasting simply refers to media files placed on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmarketcentral.com/webcast_podcast_overview.htm|title=Overview of Webcasting and Podcasting|publisher=WebMarketCentral|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>

==History==
The earliest graphically-oriented web broadcasts were not streaming video, but were in fact still frames which were photographed with a web camera every few minutes while they were being broadcast live over the Internet. One of the earliest instances of sequential live image broadcasting was in 1991 when a camera was set up next to the Trojan Room in the computer laboratory of the [[University of Cambridge]]. It provided a live picture every few minutes of the office coffee pot to all desktop computers on that office's network.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/qsf/coffee.html | title=The Trojan Room Coffee Pot|author=Quentin Stafford- Fraser|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref> A couple of years later its broadcasts went to the Internet, became known as the [[Trojan Room coffee pot|Trojan Room Coffee Pot webcam]], and gained international notoriety as a feature of the fledgling [[World Wide Web]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://gizmodo.com/5993583/the-worlds-first-webcam-was-created-to-check-a-coffee-pot-remotely | title=The World's First Webcam Was Created to Check a Coffee Pot |author=Jamie Condliffe | accessdate=2 February 2018 }}</ref>

Later in 1996 an American college student and [[conceptual art]]ist, [[Jenny Ringley]], set up a web camera similar to the Trojan Room Coffee Pot's [[webcam]] in her dorm room.<ref name="disobey">{{cite web |title=Forgotten Web Celebrities: Jennicam.org's Jennifer Ringley |url=http://www.disobey.com/ghostsites/2004_05_19_archive.html |accessdate=March 27, 2014 |date=May 19, 2004 |first=Steve |last=Baldwin |publisher=Disobey.com: Content for the discontented (blog)}}</ref> That webcam photographed her every few minutes while it broadcast those images live over the Internet upon a site called ''JenniCam''. Ringley wanted to portray all aspects of her lifestyle and the camera captured her doing almost everything&nbsp;– brushing her teeth, doing her laundry, and even having sex with her boyfriend.<ref name=Bartlett>{{cite book|first=Jamie|last=Bartlett|chapter=Chapter 6: Lights, Web-camera, Action|pages=166–192|title=The Dark Net: Inside the Digital Underworld|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTlUBAAAQBAJ|location=London|publisher=Melville House|year=2014|isbn=9780434023172}}</ref><ref name=Senft1>{{cite book|first=Theresa |last=Senft| chapter=Chapter 1 - Keeping it Real on the Web: Authenticity, Celebrity, Branding | pages=15–17 |title=Camgirls: Celebrity & Community in the Age of Social Networks |location= New York | publisher=  Peter Lang Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8204-5694-2}}</ref> Her website generated millions of hits upon the Internet, became a pay site in 1998, and spawned hundreds of female imitators who would then use streaming video to create a new billion dollar industry called ''camming'', and brand themselves as [[webcam model|camgirls]] or [[webcam model]]s.<ref name=Richtel>{{cite news|last1=Richtel|first1=Matt|title=Intimacy on the Web, With a Crowd|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/technology/intimacy-on-the-web-with-a-crowd.html|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=New York Times|date=21 September 2013}}</ref>

One of the earliest webcast equivalent of an online [[concert]] and one of the earliest examples of webcasting itself was by [[Apple Computer]]'s Webcasting Group in partnership with the entrepreneurs [[Michael Dorf (entrepreneur)|Michael Dorf]] and [[Andrew Rasiej]].

==Wedcast==
A webcast of a [[wedding]] may be called a '''wedcast''';<ref name=iht>{{cite news|title=Can't make the ceremony? Watch the wedcast|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/23/business/webwed.php|publisher=[[The International Herald Tribune]] / [[The Boston Globe]]|first=Kimberly|last=Blanton|date=October 22, 2007}}</ref><ref name=time>{{cite magazine|title=Wedcasting|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1692037,00.html|magazine=[[Time Magazine|Time]]|first=Jeninne|last=Lee-St. John|date=December 6, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208204641/https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1692037,00.html|archive-date=December 8, 2007}}</ref> it allows family and friends of the couple to watch the wedding in real time on the [[Internet]].
