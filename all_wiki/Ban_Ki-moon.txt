'''Ban Ki-moon''' ({{Korean |hangul = 반기문 |hanja = {{lang|ko-Hant|潘基文}}}}; {{IPA-ko|pan.ɡi.mun}}; born 13 June 1944) is a [[South Korea]]n [[politician]] and [[diplomat]] who served as the eighth [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] from January 2007 to December 2016. Before becoming the Secretary-General, Ban was a career diplomat in South Korea's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (South Korea)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and in the United Nations. He entered [[diplomatic service]] the year he graduated from university, accepting his first post in [[New Delhi, India]].

Ban was the [[foreign minister]] of [[South Korea]] from January 2004 to November 2006. In February 2006, he began to campaign for the office of Secretary-General. Ban was initially considered to be a long shot for the office. As foreign minister of South Korea, however, he was able to travel to all the countries on the [[United Nations Security Council]], a maneuver that turned him into the campaign's front runner.

On 13 October 2006, he was elected to be the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations#List of Secretaries-General|eighth Secretary-General]] by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. On 1 January 2007, he succeeded [[Kofi Annan]]. As Secretary-General, he was responsible for several major reforms on peacekeeping and UN employment practices. Diplomatically, Ban has taken particularly strong views on [[global warming]], pressing the issue repeatedly with U.S. President [[George W. Bush]], and on the [[Darfur conflict]], where he helped persuade Sudanese president [[Omar al-Bashir]] to allow peacekeeping troops to enter [[Sudan]].<ref name="Guardian1-27">{{Cite news|date = 27 January 2011|url =https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/27/ban-ki-moon-un-climate-change-talks|title = Ban Ki-moon ends hands-on involvement in climate change talks|work = [[The Guardian]]|author = [[Suzanne Goldenberg]]}}</ref><ref name="WPost4-17">{{Cite news|date = 17 April 2007|url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/16/AR2007041601508.html|title = Sudan To Allow U.N.

==Early life and education==
Ban was born on 13 June 1944 in the small farming village of Haengchi, Wonnam Township (''-myeon''), in [[Eumseong County]] (Insei), [[North Chungcheong Province]] in what was then [[Japanese Korea]].<ref name="eumseong.go.kr">{{cite web |url = http://www.eumseong.go.kr/english/contents.do?key=933 |title = Welcomto Eumseong |access-date = 14 May 2016}}</ref><ref name="Times12-09">{{Cite news|date = 9 December 2006|url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/09/world/asia/09ban.html|title = For New U.N.

When Ban was six, his family fled to a remote mountainside for much of the [[Korean War]].<ref name="Times12-09"/> After the war ended, his family returned to [[Chungju]]. Ban has said that, during this time, he met [[United States Armed Forces|American soldiers]].<ref name="LAT10-09"/>

In secondary school ([[Chungju High School]]), Ban became a star student, particularly in his studies of the [[English language]]. In 1962, Ban won an essay contest sponsored by the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and earned a trip to the [[United States]] where he lived in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] with a host family for several months.<ref name="FT10-10"/> As part of the trip, Ban met U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref name="Times12-09"/> When a journalist at the meeting asked Ban what he wanted to be when he grew up, he said, "I want to become a diplomat."<ref name="LAT10-09"/>

He received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[international relations]] from [[Seoul National University]] in 1970, and earned a [[Master of Public Administration]] from the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1985.<ref name="LAT10-09">{{Cite news|title = Aspiring U.N.

In addition to his native [[Korean language|Korean]], Ban speaks [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. According to a retired UN official, "one of Ban's biggest handicaps was his lack of fluency in English, which made it difficult for him to win over audiences in the US and elsewhere."<ref>{{cite news |title=Disquiet grows over performance of Ban Ki-moon, UN's 'invisible man' |date=22 July 2010 |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/22/ban-ki-moon-secretary-general-un}}</ref> There have also been questions, however, regarding the extent of his knowledge of French, one of the two [[working language]]s of the [[United Nations Secretariat]].<ref name=Phoney/>

==Career==

After graduating from university, Ban received the top score on Korea's foreign service exam. He joined the [[Foreign relations of South Korea|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in May 1970 and worked his way up the career ladder during the years of the [[Yusin Constitution]].<ref name="FT10-10"/>

Ban's first overseas posting was to [[New Delhi]], [[India]], where he served as vice consul and impressed many of his superiors in the foreign ministry with his competence. Ban reportedly accepted a posting to India rather than the United States, because in India he would be able to save more money to send to his family.<ref name=BBCprofile/><ref name=KH/> In 1974 he received his first posting to the United Nations, as First Secretary of the South Permanent Observer Mission (South Korea became a full UN member-state on 17 September 1991).<ref name="NYT10-03">{{Cite news|title = Council Backs South Korean for U.N. Secretary General|work = [[The New York Times]]|author = [[Warren Hoge]]|date = 3 October 2006}}</ref> After [[Park Chung-hee]]'s 1979 assassination, Ban assumed the post of Director of the United Nations Division.

In 1980, Ban became director of the United Nations' International Organizations and Treaties Bureau, headquartered in [[Seoul]].<ref name=KH/> He has been posted twice to the South Korean embassy in [[Washington, D. C.]] Between these two assignments he served as Director-General for American Affairs in 1990–92. In 1992, he became Vice Chairman of the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, following the adoption by South and [[North Korea]] of the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the [[Korean Peninsula]].<ref name=BBCprofile/> From 1993 to 1994 Ban was Korea's deputy ambassador to the United States. He was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and International Organizations in 1995 and then appointed National Security Advisor to the President in 1996.<ref name=KH/> Ban's lengthy career overseas has been credited with helping him avoid South Korea's unforgiving political environment.<ref name=Time>{{Cite news|url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1543932,00.html|title = Can This Guy Run the U.N.?|date = 16 October 2006|work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>

Ban was appointed [[Ambassador]] to [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]] in 1998, and a year later he was also elected as Chairman of the Preparatory Commission for the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] (CTBTO PrepCom). During the negotiations, in what Ban considers the biggest blunder of his career, he included in a public letter a positive statement about the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] in 2001, not long after the United States had decided to abandon the treaty. To avoid anger from the United States, Ban was fired by President [[Kim Dae-jung]], who also issued a public apology for Ban's statement.<ref name="Times12-09"/>

Ban was unemployed for the only time in his career and was expecting to receive an assignment to work in a remote and unimportant embassy.<ref name="Times12-09"/> In 2001, during the 56th Session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], South Korea held the rotating presidency, and to Ban's surprise, he was selected to be the chief of staff to general assembly president [[Han Seung-soo]].<ref name="Times10-14">{{Cite news|work = The New York Times|date = 14 October 2006|title = South Korean Is Appointed Secretary General of the U.N.|author = Warren Hoge}}</ref> In 2003, incoming president [[Roh Moo-hyun]] selected Ban as one of his foreign policy advisors.<ref name=KH/>

====Foreign minister of South Korea====
In 2004, Ban replaced [[Yoon Young-kwan]] as foreign minister of South Korea under president [[Roh Moo-hyun]].<ref name="LAT10-09"/> At the beginning of his term, Ban was faced with two major crises: in June 2004 [[Kim Sun-il]], a South Korean working as an Arabic translator, was kidnapped and killed in Iraq by [[Islamism|Islamic extremists]]; and in December 2004 dozens of Koreans died in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]].

As foreign minister, Ban oversaw the trade and aid policies of South Korea. This work put Ban in the position of signing trade deals and delivering foreign assistance to diplomats who would later be influential in his candidacy for Secretary-General. For example, Ban became the first senior South Korean minister to travel to the [[Republic of the Congo]] since its independence in 1960.<ref name=WashPost0929>{{Cite news|title = S.

Ban struggled to win the approval of France.

However, he has repeatedly struggled to answer questions in French from journalists.<ref name=Phoney>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/reportsfromabroad/herland/20061214.html|title=Is Ban Ki-moon a franco-phoney?|work = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]]|date = 14 December 2006|access-date =2 August 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070711132843/http://www.cbc.ca/news/reportsfromabroad/herland/20061214.html| archive-date= 11 July 2007 | url-status= dead}}</ref> Ban has repeatedly acknowledged his limitations at French, but assured French diplomats that he was devoted to continuing his study. At a press conference on 11 January 2007, Ban remarked, "My French perhaps could be improved, and I am continuing to work. I have taken French lessons over the last few months. I think that, even if my French isn't perfect, I will continue to study it."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2407 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |title=Secretary-General's press conference |date=11 January 2007 |access-date=2 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912151443/http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2407 |archive-date=12 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

As the Secretary-General election drew closer, there was rising criticism of the South Korean campaign on Ban's behalf. Specifically, his alleged practice of systematically visiting all member states of the Security Council in his role as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade to secure votes in his support by signing trade deals with European countries and pledging [[aid]] to [[developing country|developing countries]] were the focus of many news articles.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25689-2380336,00.html|title = Millions of dollars and a piano may put Korean in UN's top job|work = [[The Times]]|date = 26 September 2006|access-date =2 August 2007 |location=London|first1=Richard|last1=Beeston|first2=James|last2=Bone}}</ref> According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "rivals have privately grumbled that Republic of Korea, which has the world's 11th-largest economy, has wielded its economic might to generate support for his candidacy". Ban reportedly said that these insinuations were "groundless". In an interview on 17 September 2006 he stated: "As front-runner, I know that I can become a target of this very scrutinizing process", and that he was "a man of integrity".<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/28/AR2006092801765.html|work = The Washington Post|date = 28 September 2006|access-date = 2 August 2007|title = S.

In the final informal poll on 2 October, Ban received fourteen favorable votes and one abstention ("no opinion") from the fifteen members of the Security Council. The one abstention came from the Japanese delegation, who [[Japan–Korea disputes|vehemently opposed]] the idea of a Korean taking the role of Secretary-General. Due to the overwhelming support of Ban by the rest of the Security Council, Japan later voted in favor of Ban to avoid controversy. More importantly, Ban was the only one to escape a veto; each of the other candidates received at least one "no" vote from among the five permanent members. After the vote, Shashi Tharoor, who finished second, withdrew his candidacy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/news/shashi-tharoor-pulls-out-of-un-race/7904|title=Shashi Tharoor pulls out of UN race|work=NDTV.com|date=3 October 2006|access-date=2 October 2006}}</ref> and China's [[Permanent Representative]] to the UN told reporters that "it is quite clear from today's straw poll that Minister Ban Ki-moon is the candidate that the Security Council will recommend to the General Assembly".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/sc/so061002pm3.rm |title=United Nations Webcast of announcement |publisher=United Nations |access-date=2 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807235855/http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/sc/so061002pm3.rm |archive-date= 7 August 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

When Ban became Secretary-General, ''[[The Economist]]'' listed the major challenges facing him in 2007: "rising nuclear demons in [[Iran]] and North Korea, a haemorrhaging wound in [[Darfur]], unending violence in the Middle East, looming environmental disaster, escalating international terrorism, the proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]], the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]]. And then the more parochial concerns, such as the largely unfinished business of the most sweeping attempt at reform in the UN's history".<ref name="Econ01-06"/> Before starting, Kofi Annan shared the story that when the first Secretary-General [[Trygve Lie]] left office, he told his successor, [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], "You are about to take over the most impossible job on earth".<ref name="Times10-14"/>

On 23 January 2007 Ban took office as the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations. Ban's term as Secretary-General opened with a flap. At his first encounter with the press as Secretary-General on 2 January 2007, he refused to condemn the [[death penalty]] imposed on [[Saddam Hussein]] by the Iraqi High Tribunal, remarking, "The issue of capital punishment is for each and every member State to decide".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=964 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |title=Secretary-General's encounter with the UN press corps (transcript) |date=2 January 2007 |url-status=dead |access-date=29 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929072706/http://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=964 |archive-date=29 September 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> Ban's statements contradicted long-standing United Nations opposition to the death penalty as a human-rights concern.<ref name="NYT01-03">{{Cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/world/middleeast/03nations.html|title = New U.N.

{{update|date=October 2013}}

On the tenth anniversary of [[Khmer Rouge]] leader [[Pol Pot]]'s death, 15 April 2008, Ban Ki-moon appealed for the senior leaders of the regime to be brought to justice. The [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]]-tribunal, which was established by both the United Nations and [[Cambodia]] and which became operational in 2006, is expected to continue until at least 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/04/15/un.pol.pot/index.html|title = U.N. chief calls for justice in Cambodia|publisher = [[CNN]]|date = 15 April 2008|access-date =15 April 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420092415/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/04/15/un.pol.pot/index.html| archive-date= 20 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Ban has received strong criticism from the [[United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services|UN Office of Internal Oversight Services]] (OIOS), which stated that the secretariat under Ban's leadership was "drifting into irrelevance".<ref name=OIOS>{{Cite news|url =https://foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_documents/100719_0_ahleniussummary.pdf|title = Arrhenius End of Assignment Report|date = 14 June 2010|access-date =16 January 2012|work = [[Foreign Policy]]}}</ref>

=====Cabinet=====
In early January, Ban appointed the key members of his cabinet. As his [[United Nations Deputy Secretary-General|Deputy Secretary-General]], he selected [[Tanzania]]n foreign minister and professor [[Asha-Rose Migiro]], a move that pleased African diplomats who had concerns of losing power without Annan in office.<ref>{{Cite news|url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/06/world/06nations.html|title = Tanzanian Woman Is Chosen for U.N.'s 2nd Highest Post|work = [[The New York Times]]|date = 6 January 2007|author = Julia Preston }}</ref>

The top position devoted exclusively to management, Under-Secretary-General for Management, was filled by [[Alicia Bárcena Ibarra]] of Mexico. Bárcena was considered a UN insider, having previously served as Annan's chief of staff. Her appointment was seen by critics as an indication that Ban would not make dramatic changes to UN bureaucracy.<ref name="NYT01-04">{{Cite news|title = Mexican U.N.

Ban initially said that he would delay making other appointments until his first round of reforms were approved, yet later abandoned this idea after receiving criticism.<ref name="FT02-01"/><ref name="NYT02-06"/> In February he continued with appointments, selecting [[B. Lynn Pascoe]], the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, to become Under-Secretary-General for political affairs. [[Jean-Marie Guéhenno]], a French diplomat, who had served as Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping operations under Annan, remained in office. Ban selected [[Vijay K.

The appointment of many women to top jobs was seen as fulfilling a campaign promise Ban had made to increase the role of women in the United Nations. During Ban's first year as Secretary-General, more top jobs were being handled by women than ever before. Though not appointed by Ban, the president of the General Assembly, [[Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa]], is only the third woman to hold this position in United Nations history.<ref name="CT04-11">{{Cite news|title = Leaders making world of difference\ Higher profile at UN brings new emphasis on issues affecting women|author = Stevenson Swanson|work = [[Chicago Tribune]]|date = 11 April 2007}}</ref>

=====Reform agenda=====
During his first month in office, Ban proposed two major reforms: to split the UN peacekeeping operation into two departments and to combine the political affairs and disarmament department. His proposals were met with stiff resistance from members of the UN General Assembly who bristled under Ban's request for rapid approval. The proposed merger of the disarmament and political affairs offices was criticized by many in the developing world, partially because of rumours that Ban hoped to place American B. Lynn Pascoe in charge of the new office. [[Alejandro D. Wolff]], then acting American ambassador, said the United States backed his proposals.<ref name="FT02-01">{{Cite news|title = Ban's month of muddle: how the new UN chief is struggling to win over the doubters|author = Mark Turner|date = 1 February 2007|work = [[Financial Times]]}}</ref><ref name="NYT02-06">{{Cite news|title = U.N.

=====Key issues=====
The Secretary-General of the United Nations has the ability to influence debate on nearly any global issue. Although unsuccessful in some areas, Ban's predecessor Annan had been successful in increasing the UN peacekeeping presence and in popularizing the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. UN observers were eager to see on which issues Ban intended to focus, in addition to his declared interest in reforming the United Nations bureaucracy.<ref name="Econ01-06"/>

On several prominent issues, such as proliferation in Iran and North Korea, Ban has deferred to the Security Council.<ref name=IrishTimes/> In 2007, the [[Republic of Nauru]] raised the issue of allowing the Republic of China (Taiwan) to sign the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]. Ban referenced the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]], and refused the motion. On 19 July 2007, Taiwanese President [[Chen Shui-bian]] wrote to request admission into the UN by the name Taiwan. Ban rejected the request, stating that Resolution 2758 defined Taiwan as part of China.<ref name=Taipei>{{Cite news|url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/07/30/2003371907|title = MOFA spokesman slams Ban Ki-moon for rejecting UN bid|date = 30 July 2007|access-date =30 August 2007|work = [[Taipei Times]]}}</ref>

Ban early on identified [[global warming]] as one of the key issues of his administration. In a [[White House]] meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush in January, Ban urged Bush to take steps to curb [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. On 1 March 2007 in a speech before the UN General Assembly, Ban emphasized his concerns about global warming. Ban stated, "For my generation, coming of age at the height of the Cold War, fear of [[nuclear winter]] seemed the leading [[existential threat]] on the horizon.

======Middle East======
On Thursday, 22 March 2007, while Ban was taking part in the first stop of a tour of the Middle East, a mortar attack hit just {{convert|80|m|sp=us}} from where the Secretary-General was standing, interrupting a press conference in [[Baghdad]]'s [[Green Zone]], and visibly shaking Ban and others.

The [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] began in 2011, the last year of Ban's first term, and dominated his attention and public statements that year. Throughout the conflict, he lobbied for peaceful solutions to the crisis. He frequently spoke out against military action in Libya, believing that a diplomatic solution would be possible and preferable. However, he conceded that if then-leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] refused to abide by a cease fire agreement, the international coalition of military forces would have no choice but to intervene to protect the human rights of Libyans.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Christian Science Monitor |title=Ban Ki-Moon: I am willing to take any measures for human rights |date=23 March 2011}}</ref> The Gaddafi government was eventually overthrown and Gaddafi killed in the conflict.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15390980 |title=Muammar Gaddafi: How he died |work=BBC News|date=22 October 2011|access-date=22 October 2011}}</ref>

On 31 July 2007 the United Nations Security Council approved sending 26,000 UN peacekeepers into the region to join 7,000 troops from the African Union. The resolution was heralded as a major breakthrough in confronting the [[War in Darfur|Darfur conflict]] (although the United States labeled the conflict a "[[genocide]]", the United Nations has declined to do so).

The conference was initiated after Ban had met with [[Than Shwe]], the leading figure of Myanmar's government 23 May 2008. Ban toured the devastation—especially in the hard-hit [[Irrawaddy Delta]]—23 May 2008 and 24 May 2008.

=====Cabinet=====
Ban appointed Swedish diplomat [[Jan Eliasson]] as his new Deputy Secretary-General on 2 March 2012. His Chief of Staff is [[Edmond Mulet]] of Guatemala. The appointments were part of Ban's commitment to replace top positions in his group for his second term.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://passblue.com/2012/03/04/jan-eliasson-named-deputy-secretary-general/ |title=Jan Eliasson Named Deputy Secretary-General |last=Crossette |first=Barbara |work=PassBlue |date=4 March 2012 |access-date =26 November 2013}}</ref>

=====Key issues=====
Since beginning his second term in January 2012, Ban has focused his public statements and speeches on peace and equality in the Middle East and on equality issues.

======Middle East======
The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War and other events of the [[Arab Spring]] continued to command Ban's attention with the start of his second term. He focused in 2012 on what he termed "intolerance" in the Arab world. After travelling to [[Vienna]] to participate in the opening of the [[KAICIID Dialogue Centre]] to foster interreligious dialogue, Ban commented, "Many countries in the Arab world including Saudi Arabia are changing. Since the Arab Spring, the leaders have begun to listen to the voice of their people." He was however criticised in the Austrian press for associating himself with a project of Saudi [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]], Saudi Arabia being a location of perceived religious intolerance.<ref name="Die Presse">{{cite news |title=UN chief interviewed on religious tolerance, Gaza, Palestinian status |author=Christian Ultsch |date=27 November 2012 |work=Die Presse}}</ref>

Throughout 2012, Ban expressed his concern about the continuing [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], in particular the condition of the Palestinian [[Palestinian prisoners in Israel|hunger strikers]] in Israeli prisons<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41959&Cr=palestin&Cr1= |title=Concerned at plight of Palestinian hunger strikers, Ban urges solution without delay |publisher=United Nations |date=18 October 2011 |access-date=28 June 2012}}</ref> and the movement restrictions imposed on Gaza Strip residents.<ref name="Die Presse"/> On 30 August 2012 Ban criticized the Iranian leadership due to their statements regarding Israel's destruction and denying the Holocaust.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/world/middleeast/ban-ki-moon-broaches-delicate-topics-with-iranian-officials.html |title= Criticizing Iranian leadership statements regarding Israel and the Holocaust |work=The New York Times |date=30 August 2012 |access-date=30 August 2012}}</ref> On 16 August 2013, Ban Ki-moon admitted that the UN was biased against Israel, stating in a meeting with Israeli students that there was a biased attitude towards the Israeli people and Israeli government at the UN.

On 26 January 2016, Ban made a statement in relation to the attacks by Palestinians against Israelis. Ban Ki-moon said that "as oppressed peoples have demonstrated throughout the ages, it is human nature to react to occupation, which often serves as a potent incubator of hate and extremism".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = Benjamin Netanyahu accuses Ban Ki-moon of justifying terrorism|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/12124107/Benjamin-Netanyahu-accuses-Ban-Ki-moon-of-justifying-terrorism.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|access-date = 30 January 2016}}</ref> In rebuking Ban's statement, the Israeli PM [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] stated that "there is no justification for terror".<ref name=":0" />

According to one source, there was also a threat of "clerics in Riyadh meeting to issue a [[fatwa]] against the UN, declaring it anti-Muslim, which would mean no contacts of [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] members, no relations, contributions, support, to any UN projects, programs".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/08/saudi-arabia-united-nations-blacklist-yemen-ban-ki-moon |title=Saudi Arabian allies pressured UN chief to issue blacklist reversal, sources say  |work=The Guardian |date=8 June 2016}}</ref>

====== Ukraine ======
On 26 June 2016, during a speech in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], Ban said Russia "has a critical role to play" in addressing global issues "from ending the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, to safeguarding human rights and controlling the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction." His comments were condemned by [[Ukraine|Ukraine's]] UN envoy [[Volodymyr Yelchenko]], saying that he doesn't understand how the UN chief "can say such things which sort of praise the role of Russia in settling the conflict in Ukraine when the Russian Federation is the main player in aggressing Ukraine and in keeping this conflict boiling." He also noted that Russia is being accused of human rights abuses in [[Crimea]] and is "building up the nuclear potential" on the peninsula.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-un--oputrage-ki-moon-comments-russia/27803380.html|title=Ukraine's UN Envoy 'Outraged' By Ban's Comments On Russia|date=16 June 2016|newspaper=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en|access-date=19 June 2016}}</ref>

======LGBT rights======
On 7 March 2012 Ban delivered a speech titled "The Time Has Come" to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] urging the Council to place greater emphasis on combating [[homophobia]] and promoting [[LGBT rights]] around the world.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Ki-moon|last1=Ban|title=Message to Human Rights Council meeting on Violence and Discrimination based on Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/infocus/sgspeeches/statments_full.asp?statID=1475|website=United Nations}}</ref> The speech was met by a protest by a group of delegates, who organized a walk-out protest during the speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/blogs/alloutorg_video_ban_ki_moon_the_time_has_come.html |title=AllOut.org Video: Ban Ki-moon: "The Time Has Come" |publisher=glbtq |date=3 March 2012 |access-date=25 May 2015 |author=Summers, Claude J. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525154749/http://www.glbtq.com/blogs/alloutorg_video_ban_ki_moon_the_time_has_come.html |archive-date=25 May 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>

During a speech at the UN headquarters commemorating Human Rights Day, Ban condemned countries with anti-gay laws, mentioning 76 countries that criminalize homosexuality. He said:
:"It is an outrage that in our modern world, so many countries continue to criminalize people simply for loving another human being of the same sex."

Ban has told senior managers that homophobia will not be tolerated. He pointed to countries such as Ukraine which has proposed criminalizing public discussion about homosexuality as threatening basic human rights. He further stated that government has a duty to defend vulnerable minorities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=6504 |title=Secretary-General's remarks to special event on "Leadership in the Fight against Homophobia" |publisher=United Nations |date=11 December 2012 |access-date=25 May 2015 |author=Ban Ki-moon}}</ref> In April 2013, he described LGBT rights as one of the great neglected human rights of our time.

======Humanitarian action======
{{See also|World Humanitarian Summit}}
On 25 January 2012, Ban announced that he would convene the world's first summit on [[humanitarian aid]] in order to "share knowledge and establish common best practices."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.un.org/sg/STATEMENTS/index.asp?nid=5825 | title=Secretary-General's remarks to the General Assembly on his Five-Year Action Agenda: "The Future We Want" | date=25 January 2012 | access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref> Known as the [[World Humanitarian Summit]], the event took place in the 23–24 May 2016 in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]. In preparation for the summit, Ban released a report on 9 February 2016 titled 'One Humanity, Shared Responsibility'  in which he laid out an "Agenda for Humanity" based on consultations with more than 23,000 people in 153 countries.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/09/ban-ki-moon-world-un-humanitarian-summit-conflict-leadership | title=Ban Ki-moon: 'Close the gap between the world that is and the world that should be' | date=9 February 2016 | access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref> The Agenda for Humanity outlines what is needed to reform humanitarian action, including political leadership to prevent and end conflict, new forms of financing, and a shift from providing aid to ending need. The summit is scheduled to include 5,000 participants, including representatives from governments, NGOs, civil society organizations, and the private sector, as well as individuals affected by humanitarian crises.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.trust.org//item/20160111070315-hkcum | title=INTERVIEW-Refugees, warmongers and bloodshed targeted in first global aid summit | date=11 January 2016 | access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref>

====Criticism as UN Secretary-General====
According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "some UN employees and delegates" expressed resentment at Ban's perceived [[Cronyism|favoritism]] in the appointment of South Korean nationals in key posts. Previous UN chiefs such as [[Kurt Waldheim]] (Austria), [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] (Peru), and [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] (Egypt) brought small teams of trusted aides or clerical workers from their country's Foreign Ministry, and South Korean nationals have been historically underrepresented at the United Nations.<ref name=fav/> Nonetheless, according to "some officials" in the ''Post'' story, Ban had allegedly gone further, boosting South Korea's presence in UN ranks by more than 20 percent during his first year in office. In response, Ban and his aides stated that the allegations of favoritism are wrong, and that some of the harshest criticisms against him have undercurrents of [[racism]].<ref name=fav/> He said that the South Korean nationals he had appointed—including [[Choi Young-jin]], who had already served as a high-ranking official in the United Nations' peacekeeping department—are highly qualified for their positions. Others such as Donald P. Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, said that the complaints were driven by [[envy]]: "I think being from South Korea, and people have growing respect for South Korea, that's a great enhancement for the secretary general. If he brings along talented people who he knows very well, I think that's also a plus." UN records show that South Korea, the organization's eleventh-largest financial contributor, had only 54 South Korean nationals assigned to its mission six months before Ban took over the top UN post. By contrast, the [[Philippines]], a significantly poorer country, had 759 nationals in its mission.<ref name=fav>{{Cite news|title = Under U.N.

American diplomat [[James Wasserstrom]] claimed that Ban attempted to limit the jurisdiction of the [[United Nations Dispute Tribunal|UN dispute tribunal]] following Wasserstrom's dismissal from his Kosovo post and lengthy appeals process.<ref>Borger, Julian (2012) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/27/un-tribunal-whistleblower-james-wasserstrom "UN tribunal finds ethics office failed to protect whistleblower"]. ''The Guardian''</ref> Ban had refused to hand over confidential documents relating to the case to the UN personnel tribunal, despite repeated orders by the court to do so. In relation to another case, Ban was admonished by Judge Michael Adams for "willful disobedience" for again refusing to hand over key documents in an internal promotions dispute.<ref>Lynch, Colum (13 May 2010), [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/12/AR2010051204868.html "U.N.

In 2013, Ban was accused of undermining collective bargaining rights of The Staff Coordinating Council, the union representing United Nations staff.  Ban unilaterally eliminated the role of the union to negotiate on behalf of the employees and terminated talks when the union protested.<ref>Chen, M. (17 September 2013), "Ban Ki Moon Accused of Union Busting at UN", ''Huffington Post''.</ref>

Ban was named in a lawsuit challenging UN legal immunity on behalf of Haitian cholera victims in the U.S. District Court of Manhattan. UN peacekeepers from Nepal are said to be the source of the [[2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak]]. Ban declared that the legal immunity of the United Nations before national courts should be upheld, but that this does not reduce the UN's moral responsibility to overcome Haiti's cholera epidemic.<ref>Rosen, Armin (9 April 2015), [http://www.businessinsider.com/cholera-outbreak-in-haiti-and-the-un-2015-4 "How the UN caused a massive cholera outbreak in Haiti"], ''Business Insider''.
