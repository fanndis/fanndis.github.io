The '''2012 UEFA European Football Championship''', commonly referred to as '''UEFA Euro 2012''' or simply '''Euro 2012''', was the 14th [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] for [[List of men's national association football teams#UEFA (Europe)|men's national football team]]s organised by [[UEFA]]. The final tournament, held between 8 June and 1 July 2012, was co-hosted for the first time by Poland and Ukraine, and was won by [[Spain national football team|Spain]], who beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 4–0 [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final|in the final]] at the [[Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex|Olympic Stadium]], [[Kiev]], Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web |title=Spain overpower Italy to win UEFA EURO 2012|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/matches/round=15175/match=2003351/postmatch/report/index.html|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref>

Poland and Ukraine's bid was chosen by the UEFA Executive Committee on 18 April 2007.<ref name="Host decision">{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=4194304/newsid=364810.html |title=Euro joy for Poland and Ukraine |date=18 April 2007 |accessdate=31 October 2010 |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521080359/http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=4194304/newsid=528963.html |archive-date=21 May 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The two host teams qualified automatically while the remaining 14 finalists were decided through a [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|qualifying competition]], featuring 51 teams, from August 2010 to November 2011. This was the last European Championship to employ the 16-team finals format in use since [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]]; from [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] onward, it was expanded to 24 finalists.

Euro 2012 was played at eight venues, four in each host country. Five new stadiums were built for the tournament, and the hosts invested heavily in improving infrastructure such as railways and roads at UEFA's request. Euro 2012 set attendance records for the 16-team format, for the highest aggregate attendance (1,440,896) and average per game (46,481).

Spain became the first team to win two consecutive European Championships, and also three straight major tournaments ([[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]], [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] and Euro 2012).<ref name="Spain's records">{{cite news |title=Torres, Casillas & Xavi amongst record-breakers for Spain |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/2898/euro-2012/2012/07/01/3204471/casillas-torres-xavi-amongst-record-breakers-for-spain |publisher=Goal.com |date=1 July 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012 }}</ref> Spain had already gained entry to the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup|2013 Confederations Cup]] by winning the World Cup, so runners-up [[Italy national football team|Italy]] qualified instead. As at [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] in Austria and Switzerland, both 2012 host nations were eliminated in the group stage.

==Bid process==
{{Main|UEFA Euro 2012 bids}}

The hosting of the event was initially contested by five bids representing seven countries: Croatia–Hungary, Greece, Italy, Poland–Ukraine, and Turkey.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bidding for the Final Tournament 2012 |url=http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/362039.pdf |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=7 November 2005}}</ref> In November 2005, after an initial consideration of the bid data by UEFA, both the Greek and Turkish bids were eliminated from the process, to leave three candidates.<ref>{{cite news |title=Uefa reveals Euro 2012 shortlist|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4417634.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 November 2005}}</ref>

In May 2006, this was followed by a second round of the selection process, which included visits by UEFA to all candidates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=4194304/newsid=426382.html |title=Euro bidders state cases |date=31 May 2006 |accessdate=31 October 2010 |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422215944/http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=4194304/newsid=426382.html |archive-date=22 April 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The final decision was due to be announced on 8 December 2006 in [[Nyon]], but this was postponed to "give bidding associations more time for the fine-tuning of their bids".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=4194304/newsid=507142.html |title=EURO 2012 dossiers delivered |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=31 October 2010 |work=[[UEFA]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421142347/http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=4194304/newsid=507142.html |archive-date=21 April 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 18 April 2007, the Poland–Ukraine bid was chosen by a vote of the UEFA Executive Committee, at a meeting in [[Cardiff]].<ref name="Host decision"/>

Poland–Ukraine became the third successful joint bid for the European Championship, after those of Belgium–Netherlands ([[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]]) and Austria–Switzerland ([[UEFA Euro 2008|2008]]). Their bid received an [[Supermajority|absolute majority]] of votes, and was therefore announced the winner, without requiring a second round. Italy, which received the remaining votes,<ref name="Host decision"/> had been considered favourites to win the hosting, but incidents of fan violence and [[2006 Italian football scandal|a match-fixing scandal]] were widely cited as factors behind their failure.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6562527.stm |title=Poland and Ukraine host Euro 2012 |date=18 April 2007 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/apr/12/europeanfootball.sport |title=Why Euro 2012 could go east|date=12 April 2007|work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Peterjon |last=Cresswell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=422695&cc=5739 |title=Poland and Ukraine to host Euro 2012|date=18 April 2007|work=[[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]]}}</ref>

There were some later alterations from the initial bid plan, regarding the venues, before UEFA confirmed the eight host cities in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|date=14 May 2009|title=Selection of host cities for UEFA Euro 2012|work=UEFA.com|publisher=Union of European Football Associations|url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/news/newsid=829457.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=12 December 2009|title=Four Ukraine host cities confirmed|work=UEFA.com|publisher=Union of European Football Associations|url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/news/newsid=933832.html}}</ref> During the preparation process in Poland and Ukraine, [[Concerns and controversies related to UEFA Euro 2012#Criticism of preparations|UEFA repeatedly expressed concern about their preparation to host the event]], with different candidates reported as being alternative hosts if they did not improve;<ref>{{cite news |title=Scots eye Euro 2012 rescue plan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7437379.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=5 June 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/176318/germany-and-hungary-could-replace-ukraine-as-euro-2012-host |work=Sport Business |title=Germany and Hungary could replace Ukraine as Euro 2012 host |date=11 May 2010}}</ref> however, in the end, UEFA affirmed their selection.<ref>{{cite news |title=Platini: Ukraine nearly ready for Euro 2012 |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/113621/ |work=[[Kyiv Post]] |date=27 September 2011 }}</ref>

==Qualification==
{{main|UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying}}
The draw for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying competition took place in Warsaw on 7 February 2010.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chaplin|first=Mark|date=30 January 2009|title=UEFA lays out priorities for 2009|work=UEFA.com|publisher=Union of European Football Associations|url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/protecting-the-game/club-licensing-and-financial-fair-play/news/newsid=796459.html?redirectFromOrg=true}}</ref> Fifty-one teams entered to compete for the fourteen remaining places in the finals, alongside co-hosts [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]]. The teams were divided into nine groups, with the draw using the [[UEFA coefficient#New ranking and calculation method|new UEFA national team coefficient]] for the first time in order to determine the seedings. As defending champions, [[Spain national football team|Spain]] was automatically top-seeded. The qualifying process began in August 2010 and concluded in November 2011. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in October 2011, the nine group winners qualified automatically, along with the highest ranked second placed team. The remaining eight-second placed teams contested two-legged play-offs, and the four winners qualified for the finals.<ref name="UEFA draw">{{cite web|title=Draw details and dates|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/draws/round=15171/index.html|date=7 February 2012|publisher=UEFA|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref>

Twelve of the sixteen finalists participated at [[UEFA Euro 2008|the previous tournament in 2008]]. [[England national football team|England]] and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] made their return to the Euro, having last participated in [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]], while [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] returned after a twenty-four-year absence to make their second appearance at a European Championship. One of the co-hosts, [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], made their debut as an independent nation (before 1992 Ukraine participated as part of the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]]). With the exception of [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] – according to UEFA's ranking at the end of the qualifying stage – Europe's sixteen highest-ranked teams all qualified for the tournament.

===Qualified teams===
The following sixteen teams qualified for the finals:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/teams/index.html |title=UEFA Euro 2012 teams |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref>

{{:UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying}}

===Final draw===
The draw for the final tournament took place on 2 December 2011 at the [[Palace "Ukraine"|Ukraine Palace of Arts]] in [[Kiev]], Ukraine.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/news/newsid=1692248.html |title=December date for Euro finals draw in Kyiv |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=3 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=1725325.html |title=Euro draw throws up fascinating group tests |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=2 December 2011}}</ref> The hour-long ceremony was hosted by [[Olha Freimut]] and Piotr Sobczyński, television presenters from the two host countries.

As was the case for the 2004 and 2008 finals, the sixteen finalists were divided into four [[Seed (tennis)|seeding]] pots, using the [[UEFA national team coefficient]] ranking.<ref name="Seedings">{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=1716622.html |title=Euro finals draw seedings unveiled |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=16 November 2011}}</ref> The pot allocations were based on the [[UEFA national team coefficient]] rankings of the sixteen finalists at the end of the qualifying competition in November 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/competitions/Draws/01/71/66/36/1716636_DOWNLOAD.pdf|title=National team coefficient ranking |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=16 November 2011 }}</ref> Each nation's coefficient was generated by calculating:
*40% of the average ranking points per game earned in the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying stage]].
*40% of the average ranking points per game earned in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying stage]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup|final tournament]].
*20% of the average ranking points per game earned in the [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying|UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying stage]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008|final tournament]].

Aside from the coefficient, three teams were automatically placed in Pot 1. [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[Poland national football team|Poland]] were both assigned to Pot 1 as the two host nations, despite the fact that their rankings were the two lowest in the tournament; this also occurred in [[UEFA Euro 2008 seeding|2008]] when the co-hosts [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]] were also ranked below all other qualified teams. As defending champions, [[Spain national football team|Spain]] were also automatically assigned to Pot 1, though their UEFA ranking at the time of the draw was coincidentally also the best.

In the draw procedure, one team from each pot was drawn into each of the four groups. The draw also determined which place in the group teams in pots 2–4 would take (e.g. A2, A3 or A4) to create the match schedule. With Poland automatically assigned in advance to A1, and Ukraine to D1, Pot 1 only had two teams as Spain and the Netherlands were to be drawn into position one in either group B or C.<ref name="Seedings" /><ref>{{cite news|date=4 October 2010|title=Fixture plan brings Euro dream closer|work=UEFA.com|publisher=Union of European Football Associations|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro-2020/news/0254-0d7c998fb500-2afb1583c9f0-1000--fixture-plan-brings-euro-dream-closer/}}</ref> The balls were drawn by four former players who had each been part of European Championship winning teams: [[Horst Hrubesch]], [[Marco van Basten]], [[Peter Schmeichel]] and [[Zinedine Zidane]].<ref>{{cite news |title=UEFA Euro 2012 final draw press kit part |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/competitions/Draws/01/72/52/58/1725258_DOWNLOAD.pdf |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=2 December 2011 }}</ref>

Eight cities were selected by UEFA as host venues. In a return to the format used at [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]], [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]], each of the four groups' matches were played in two stadiums. Host cities [[Warsaw]], [[Gdańsk]], [[Wrocław]], [[Poznań]], [[Kiev]], and [[Lviv]] are all popular tourist destinations, unlike [[Donetsk]] and [[Kharkiv]], the latter of which replaced [[Dnipropetrovsk]] as a host city in 2009.<ref>{{cite news |title=Surkis says Odesa mayor promised much, did little with respect to Euro 2012 |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/55131/ |work=[[Kyiv Post]] |date=15 December 2009}}</ref>

In order to meet UEFA's requirement for football infrastructure improvements, five new stadiums were built and opened in advance of the tournament. The remaining three stadiums (in Kiev, Poznań and Kharkiv) underwent major renovations in order to meet UEFA's infrastructure standards.<ref>{{cite news |title=Municipal Stadium Poznan launched in style |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/news/newsid=1534852.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=21 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Metalist Stadium lights up Kharkov |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/news/newsid=934841.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=5 December 2009 }}</ref> Three of the stadiums are categorised as [[UEFA stadium categories|UEFA's highest category stadiums]].

UEFA organised fan zones in the eight host cities. They were located in the centre of each city, with all 31 matches shown live on a total of 24 giant screens. The zones enabled supporters to come together in a secure and controlled environment. The Warsaw Fan Zone occupied 120,000 square meters and accommodated 100,000 visitors. In all, the fans zones had a 20% increase in capacity compared to Euro 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/CountdownNews/competitions/Publications/01/76/11/50/1761150_DOWNLOAD.pdf |title=Alive-Creating History Together |pages=37–39 |format=PDF |accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref>

A total of 31 matches were played during Euro 2012, with Ukraine hosting 16 of them and Poland 15.

===Ticketing===
Tickets for the venues were sold directly by UEFA via its website, or distributed by the football associations of the 16 finalists. Applications had to be made during March 2011 for the 1.4&nbsp;million tickets available for the 31 tournament matches.<ref>{{cite news |title=Apply now for UEFA Euro 2012 ticket sales |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/news/newsid=1601726.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=1 March 2011 }}</ref> Over 20,000 were forecast to cross the Poland–Ukraine border each day during the tournament.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/euro2012/general/detail/128112/| title=Over 20,000 people per day to cross Ukraine–Poland border during Euro 2012|work=[[Kyiv Post]]| date=23 May 2012}}</ref> Over 12 million applications were received, which represented a 17% increase on the 2008 finals, and an all-time record for the UEFA European Championship.<ref>{{cite news |title=Massive demand for UEFA Euro 2012 tickets |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/news/newsid=1614219.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=1 April 2011 }}</ref> Owing to this over-subscription for the matches, lotteries were carried out to allocate tickets. Prices varied from €30 (£25) (for a seat behind the goals at a group match) to €600 (£513) (for a seat in the main stand at the final). In addition to individual match tickets, fans could buy packages to see either all matches played by one team, or all matches at one specific venue.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ticket prices for UEFA Euro 2012 announced |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/news/newsid=1593401.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=15 February 2011 }}</ref>

===Team base camps===
Each team had a "team base camp" for its stay between the matches.

The Adidas Tango 12 was the official match ball of UEFA Euro 2012.<ref name=uefaintro>{{cite news |first1=Kevin |last1=Ashby |first2=Sam |last2=Adams |title=adidas Tango 12 unveiled as official ball |url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=1726610.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=2 December 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011 }}</ref> The ball is named after the original [[Adidas Tango]] family of footballs; however, the Tango 12 and its variations have a completely new design. Variations of the ball have been used in other contemporary competitions including the [[2012 Africa Cup of Nations|Africa Cup of Nations]] and the [[2012 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].

UEFA announced the schedule for the 31 matches of the final tournament in October 2010,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/competitions/Draws/01/72/67/72/1726772_DOWNLOAD.pdf |title=Match Schedule |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |format=PDF |date=4 October 2010}}</ref> with the final confirmation of kick-offs times being affirmed following the tournament draw in December 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=1726581.html |title=Euro finals schedule confirmed |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=2 December 2011}}</ref>

The teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the four groups progressed to the quarter-finals, while the bottom two teams were eliminated from the tournament.

===Tiebreakers===
If two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:<ref name="regulations">{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/competitions/Regulations/91/48/36/914836_DOWNLOAD.pdf |title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2010–12 |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |access-date=19 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Key Euro regulation changes approved|url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/news/newsid=1800152.html|date=22 May 2012|work=UEFA.com|publisher=Union of European Football Associations}}</ref>
# Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;
# Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;
# Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;
# If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still had an equal ranking (e.g. if criteria 1 to 3 were applied to three teams that were level on points initially and these criteria separated one team from the other two who still have an equal ranking), criteria 1 to 3 would be reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams who were still level to determine their final rankings. If this procedure did not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 9 would apply;
# Superior goal difference in all group matches;
# Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;
# If two teams tie alone (according to 1–5) after having met in the last round of the group stage their ranking is determined by [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]].
# Position in the [[UEFA national team coefficient]] ranking system;
# Fair play conduct of the teams (final tournament);
# Drawing of lots.

===Discipline===
In the final tournament, a player was suspended for the subsequent match in the competition for either getting red card or accumulating two yellow cards in two different matches. UEFA's Control and Disciplinary body has the ability to increase the automatic one match ban for a red card (e.g. for violent conduct). Single yellow card cautions were erased at the conclusion of the quarter-finals, and were not carried over to the semi-finals (so that a player could only be suspended for the final by getting a red card in the semi-final). Single yellow cards and suspensions for yellow card accumulations do not carry over to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] tournament matches.<ref name="regulations"/> The following players were suspended during the final tournament – for one or more games – as a result of red cards or yellow card accumulations:

[[File:UEFA Euro 2012, Poland-Russia, 12.06.2012 DSC 1738.JPG|thumb|Police in Warsaw before the match between Poland and Russia]]
After Poland and Ukraine were chosen by a vote of the UEFA Executive Committee as host countries for Euro 2012, several issues arose, which jeopardised the Polish/Ukrainian host status.

In Ukraine there were financial difficulties related to stadium and infrastructure renovation related to the [[2008–2012 global recession|economic crisis]].<ref name=crisis-threatens>{{cite news |title=Financial crisis threatens Ukraine as Euro 2012 host |url=https://www.tsn.ca/story/?id=254324 |date=31 October 2008 |work=[[The Canadian Press]] }}</ref> In Poland, issues arose related to corruption within the [[Polish Football Association]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE4906EA20081001 |title=FIFA warns Poland on World Cup suspension |agency=Reuters |date=1 October 2008}}</ref> In April 2009 however, the president of UEFA, [[Michel Platini]] announced that all was on track and that he saw no major problems.
