'''Yonkers''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɒ|ŋ|k|ər|z}}<ref>{{Cite web |date=n.d. |title=Yonkers |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/yonkers?showCookiePolicy=true |access-date=September 24, 2014 |publisher=Collins Dictionary}}</ref>) is a city in [[Westchester County, New York]], United States. Developed along the [[Hudson River]], it is the fourth-most populous city in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], behind [[New York City]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]. The population of Yonkers was 195,976 as enumerated in the [[2010 United States Census]]; it is estimated to have increased by 2.2% to 200,370 in 2019.<ref name="USCensusEst2019" /> It is classified as an [[inner suburb]] of New York City, directly to the north of [[the Bronx]] and approximately two miles (3&nbsp;km) north of the northernmost point in [[Manhattan]].

Yonkers's downtown is centered on a [[plaza]] known as [[Getty Square]], where the municipal government is located. The downtown area also houses significant local businesses and non-profits. It serves as a major retail hub for Yonkers and the northwest Bronx.

The city is home to several attractions, including [[Untermyer Park]]; [[Hudson River Museum]]; [[Saw Mill River]] [[Daylighting (streams)|daylighting]], wherein a parking lot was removed to uncover a river; [[Science Barge]]; and [[Sherwood House (Yonkers, New York)|Sherwood House]]. [[Yonkers Raceway]], a [[harness racing]] track, renovated its grounds and clubhouse, and added legalized [[video slot machine]] [[gambling]] in 2006 in a "[[racino]]" called Empire City. This casino-style gambling added to the attraction of the track as a destination.

Major shopping areas are located in [[Getty Square]], on South Broadway, at the [[Cross County Shopping Center]] and [[Westchester's Ridge Hill]], and along [[New York State Route 100|Central Park Avenue]], informally called "Central Ave" by area residents, a name it takes officially a few miles north in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]].

Yonkers is known as the "[[City of Seven Hills]]," which includes Park, Nodine, Ridge, Cross, Locust, Glen, and Church hills.

==History==
[[File:View of Yonkers, New York (NYPL Hades-1803881-1659418) crop.jpg|thumb|380px|Yonkers, New York, c.1860s]]

===Early years===
[[File:Philipse Manor Hall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor Hall]]]]

The land on which the city is built was once part of a Dutch {{convert|24,000|acre|km2|abbr=off|adj=on|sp=us}} land grant called [[Colen Donck]]. It ran from the current Manhattan-Bronx border at [[Marble Hill, Manhattan, New York|Marble Hill]] northwards for {{convert|12|mi|0}}, and from the [[Hudson River]] eastwards to the [[Bronx River]]. In July 1645, this area was granted to [[Adriaen van der Donck]], the [[patroon]] of Colendonck.  Van der Donck was known locally as the ''[[Jonkheer]]'' or ''Jonker'' (etymologically, "young gentleman," derivation of old Dutch ''jong'' (''young'') and ''heer'' ("lord"); in effect, "[[Esquire]]"), a word from which the name "Yonkers" is directly derived.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Erik |date=August 19, 2009 |title=Interactive Map: Dutch Place Names in New York &#124; Dutch New York |url=http://www.thirteen.org/dutchny/interactives/dutch-place-names-in-new-york-city/6/ |access-date=September 16, 2011 |website=Thirteen.org}}</ref> Van der Donck built a [[Sawmill|saw mill]] near where the confluence of Nepperhan Creek and the Hudson. The Nepperhan is now also known as the [[Saw Mill River]].  Van der Donck was killed in the [[Peach War]]. His wife, Mary Doughty, was taken captive by Native Americans and later ransomed. 

Near the site of van der Donck's mill is [[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor Hall]], a Colonial-era manor house owned by Dutch colonists. Today the manor is preserved and operated as a museum and archive, offering many glimpses into life before the American Revolution. The original structure (later enlarged) was built around 1682 by [[Frederick Philipse]] and his wife Margaret Hardenbroeck. Philipse was a wealthy Dutchman who by the time of his death had amassed an enormous estate, which encompassed the entire modern City of Yonkers, as well as several other Hudson River towns. Philipse's great-grandson, Frederick Philipse III, was a prominent [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] during the [[American Revolution]]. He had many economic ties to English businessmen, which also resulted in political ties. Because of his political leanings, he was forced to flee to England. The victorious rebels in New York state confiscated all the lands and property that belonged to the Philipse family and sold it. 

===19th century===

For its first 200 years, Yonkers was a small farming town with an active industrial waterfront. Yonkers's later growth rested largely on developing industry. In 1853, [[Elisha Otis]] invented the first safety elevator and the [[Otis Elevator Company]] opened the first elevator factory in the world on the banks of the Hudson near what is now Vark Street. In the 1880s it relocated to larger quarters (now adapted and used as the Yonkers Public Library). Around the same time, the [[Alexander Smith Carpet Mills Historic District|Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet Company]] (in the Saw Mill River Valley) expanded to 45 buildings, 800 looms, and more than 4,000 workers. It was known as one of the premier carpet-producing centers in the world.

The community was incorporated as a village in the northern part of the Town of Yonkers in 1854 and as a city in 1872. In 1874 the southern part of the town, including [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]] and [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], was annexed by New York City as part of [[The Bronx]]. In 1898, Yonkers (along with [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], and [[Staten Island]]) voted on a referendum to determine if they wanted to become part of New York City. While the results were positive elsewhere, the returns were so negative in Yonkers and neighboring [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]] that those two areas were not included in the consolidated city and remained independent.<ref>{{cite inside}}, p.177-78</ref> Still, some residents call Yonkers "the [[Sixth Borough]]," referring to its location on the New York City border, its urban character, and the failed merger vote.

During the [[American Civil War]], 254 Yonkers residents joined the US Army and Navy. They enlisted primarily in four different regiments. These included the [[6th New York Heavy Artillery Regiment|6th New York Heavy Artillery]], the [[5th New York Volunteer Infantry]], the [[17th New York Volunteer Infantry|17th New York Volunteers]], and the 15th NY National Guard. During the [[New York City draft riots|New York City Draft Riots]], Yonkers formed the Home Guards. This force of constables was formed to protect Yonkers from rioting that was feared to spread from New York City, but it never did. In total, seventeen Yonkers residents were killed during the Civil War.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Atkins |first=Thomas Astley |title=Yonkers in the Rebellion 1861-1965 |publisher=The Yonkers Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument Association |year=1892 |pages=21–73}}</ref>

From 1888, the [[New York and Putnam Railroad|New York City and Northern Railway Company]] (later the [[New York Central Railroad]]) connected Yonkers to Manhattan and points north. A three-mile spur to [[Getty Square]] operated until 1943.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kinlock |first=Ken |title=New York Central\'s Putnam Division |url=http://www.kinglyheirs.com/AbandonedRR/Putnam1.html |website=kinglyheirs.com}}</ref>

Aside from being a manufacturing center, Yonkers played a key role in the development of sports recreation in the United States. In 1888, Scottish-born John Reid founded the first [[golf course]] in the United States, [[Saint Andrew's Golf Club]], in Yonkers.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-29310735 "Ryder Cup: Painting celebrates Dunfermline links to American golf"]. BBC. Retrieved December 29, 2014</ref>

===20th century===

[[Bakelite]], the first completely synthetic plastic, was invented in Yonkers circa 1906 by Leo Baekeland, and manufactured there until the late 1920s. Today, two of the former [[Alexander Smith Carpet Mills Historic District|Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet Company]] loft buildings located at 540 and 578 Nepperhan Avenue have been repurposed to house the [[YoHo Artist Community]]. This collective group of artists works out of private studios there.<ref>Fallon, Bill (March 3, 2008). "Industrial Arts: Carpet Mills Become Studio Central," ''Westchester County Business Journal'', p. 49.</ref>

During [[World War I]], a total of 6,909 Yonkers residents entered military service. This was approximately seven percent of the population.<ref name="Yonkers in the World War">{{Cite book |title=Yonkers in the World War |publisher=The Plimpton Press |year=1922 |location=Norwood, Mass.}}</ref>{{rp|vi}} Most Yonkers men joined either the [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th Division]] or the [[77th Division (United States)|77th Division]].<ref name="Yonkers in the World War" />{{rp|6}} In total one hundred thirty-seven Yonkers residents were killed during the war.<ref name="Yonkers in the World War" />{{rp|77}} Among the survivors of the [[USS President Lincoln (1907)|USS ''President Lincoln'']], a Navy transport ship sunk during the war, were seventeen sailors from Yonkers.<ref name="Yonkers in the World War" />{{rp|15}} 

Civilians helped in the war effort by joining organizations such as the [[American Red Cross]]. In 1916, there were one hundred twenty-six people in the Yonkers chapter of the Red Cross. By the end of the war, 15,358 Yonkers residents were members of the chapter. Mostly women, they prepared surgical dressings, created hospital garments for the wounded, and knit articles of clothing for refugees and soldiers. Besides joining the Red Cross, residents of Yonkers donated to various war drives. The total amount raised for these drives was $19,255,255.<ref name="Yonkers in the World War" />{{rp|23&ndash;24}}

Early in the 20th century, Yonkers also hosted a [[brass era]] [[automobile]] maker, [[Colt Runabout Company]].<ref>No apparent relation to Colt's Patent Firearms. Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.63.</ref> Although the vehicle reportedly performed well, the company went under. Yonkers was the headquarters of the Waring Hat Company, at the time the nation's largest hat manufacturer. During [[World War II]], the city's factories were converted to produce items for the war effort,  such as tents and blankets by the Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet Factory, and tanks by the Otis Elevator factory. After World War II, however, increased competition from less expensive imports resulted in a decline in manufacturing in Yonkers's numerous industrial jobs were lost. The Alexander Smith Carpet Company, one of the city's largest employers, ceased operation during a labor dispute in June 1954.

In 1983, the Otis Elevator Factory finally closed its doors. With the loss of such jobs, Yonkers became primarily a residential city. Some neighborhoods, such as [[Crestwood, Yonkers, New York|Crestwood]] and [[Park Hill, Yonkers|Park Hill]], became popular with wealthy New Yorkers who wished to live outside Manhattan without giving up urban conveniences. Yonkers's excellent transportation infrastructure, including three commuter railroad lines (now two: the [[Harlem Line|Harlem]] and [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]]s), and five parkways and thruways, made it a desirable city in which to live. It is a 15-minute drive from Manhattan and has numerous prewar homes and apartment buildings, Yonkers's manufacturing sector has also shown a resurgence in the early 21st century.

On January 4, 1940, Yonkers resident [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] transmitted the first [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio broadcast (on station [[W2XCR]]) from the Yonkers home of C.R. Runyon, a co-experimenter. Yonkers had the longest running [[pirate radio]] station, owned by Allan Weiner, which operated during the 1970s through the 1980s.

In 1942, a short subway connection was planned between Getty Square and the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]], which terminates in Riverdale at [[242nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|242nd Street]] slightly south of the city line. The plan was dropped.<ref>{{Cite news |date=June 27, 1942 |title=Wants Subway Extended: Yonkers Mayor to Ask City to Take Over N.Y.C.

In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Yonkers's population as 95.8% white and 4.0% black.<ref name="census1" /> The city's struggles with racial discrimination and segregation were highlighted in a decades-long federal lawsuit. After a 1985 decision and an unsuccessful appeal, Yonkers's schools were integrated in 1988. Federal judge [[Leonard B. Sand]] ruled that Yonkers had engaged in institutional segregation in housing and school policies for over 40 years. He tied the illegal concentration of public housing and private housing discrimination to the city's resistance to ending racial isolation in its public schools.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In the 1980s and 1990s, Yonkers developed a national reputation for racial tension, based on a long-term battle between the city and the [[NAACP]] over the building of subsidized low-income housing projects in the city. The city planned to use federal funding for [[urban renewal]] efforts within Downtown Yonkers exclusively; other groups, led by the NAACP, believed that the resulting concentration of low-income housing in traditionally poor neighborhoods would perpetuate poverty. Although the City of Yonkers had been warned in 1971 by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development against further building of low-income housing in west Yonkers, it continued to support subsidized housing in this area between 1972 and 1977.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Esannson |first1=Harold |title=A Study of African-American Life in Yonkers From the Turn of the Century |last2=Bagwell |first2=Vinnie |publisher=Harold Esannson |year=1993 |pages=50}}</ref> 

Yonkers gained national/international attention during the summer of 1988, when it reneged on its previous agreement to build promised municipal public housing in the eastern portions of the city, an agreement it had made in a consent decree after losing an appeal in 1987. After its reversal, the city was found in contempt of the federal courts. Judge Sand imposed a fine on Yonkers which started at $100 and doubled every day, capped at $1 million per day by an appeals court,<ref>{{Cite news |date=December 5, 2016 |title=Leonard B. Sand, Judge in Landmark Yonkers Segregation Case, Dies at 88 |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/nyregion/judge-leonard-sand-dead-yonkers-housing.html |access-date=May 10, 2018}}</ref> until the city capitulated to the federally mandated plan.

Yonkers remained in contempt of court until September 9, 1988. The City Council relented in the wake of having to close the library and cutback on sanitation measures because of paying the fines. It also was considering having to make massive city layoffs which would have adversely affected its ability to provide services to the upper classes it was trying to retain. First-term mayor [[Nick Wasicsko|Nicholas C. Wasicsko]] fought to save the city from financial disaster and bring about unity. Yonkers's youngest mayor (elected at age 28), Wasicsko struggled in city politics. It was scarred with the stigma of the "[[Balkanization]] of Yonkers". He succeeded in helping to end the city's contempt of the courts, but was voted out of office as a result. His story is the subject of a miniseries called ''[[Show Me a Hero]],'' which aired on [[HBO]] in 2015. It was adapted from the 1999 nonfiction book of the same name by former ''[[New York Times]]'' writer, [[Lisa Belkin]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

A [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company|Kawasaki]] railroad cars assembly plant opened in 1986 in the former Otis plant. It produces the new [[R142A (New York City Subway car)|R142A]], [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]], [[R160B (New York City Subway car)|R160B]], and [[R188 (New York City Subway car)|R188]] cars for the [[New York City Subway]], and the PA4 and PA5 series for [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]].

===21st century===
In the 2000s, some areas of Yonkers that border similar neighborhoods in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], [[The Bronx|Bronx]] began seeing an influx of [[Orthodox Jew]]s. Subsequently, Riverdale [[Hatzalah]] Volunteer Ambulance Service began serving some neighborhoods in the southwest section of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Riverdale Hatzalah |url=http://www.riverdalehatzalah.org/ |website=riverdalehatzalah.org}}</ref>  There is also a small Jewish cemetery, the Sherwood Park Cemetery.<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 21, 2012 |title=Sherwood Park Cemetery, Yonkers, Westchester County, New York, United States - Nearby Cities, Nearby Cemeteries and Genealogy Resources - Histopolis |url=http://test.histopolis.com/Place/US/NY/Westchester_County/Sherwood_Park_Cemetery |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125075738/http://test.histopolis.com/Place/US/NY/Westchester_County/Sherwood_Park_Cemetery |archive-date=January 25, 2013 |access-date=March 12, 2013 |website=Test.histopolis.com}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Yonkers NY Waterfront.JPG|thumb|High-rise apartments along the Hudson River in Northwest Yonkers]]
The city is spread out over hills rising from near sea level at the eastern bank of the [[Hudson River]] to 416 feet (126 m) at Sacred Heart Church, whose spire can be seen from [[Long Island]], [[New York City]], and [[New Jersey]].

The city occupies 20.3&nbsp;square miles (52.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), including 18.1 square miles (46.8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land and 2.2 square miles (5.8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) (11.02%) of water, according to the [[United States Census Bureau]].
The [[Bronx River]] separates Yonkers from [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]], [[Tuckahoe (village), New York|Tuckahoe]], [[Eastchester, New York|Eastchester]], [[Bronxville]], and [[Scarsdale]] to the east. The town of [[Greenburgh, New York|Greenburgh]] is to the north, and the [[Hudson River]] forms the western border.

On the south, Yonkers borders the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], [[Woodlawn, Bronx|Woodlawn]], and [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] sections of [[The Bronx]]. In addition, the southernmost point of Yonkers is {{convert|2|mi|0|abbr=off}} north of the northernmost point of [[Manhattan]] when measured from Broadway & Caryl Avenue in Yonkers to Broadway & West 228th Street in the [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] section of Manhattan.

Much of the city developed around the [[Saw Mill River]]. This enters Yonkers from the north and flows into the [[Hudson River]] in the [[Getty Square]] neighborhood.  Portions of the Saw Mill River that were earlier buried in flumes beneath parking lots are being uncovered, or [[Daylighting (streams)|"daylighted"]]. This promotes the restoration of habitat for plants, fish and other fauna.

The [[gentilic]] for residents is alternately Yonkersonian or Yonkersite.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Wordsmith.org -- Online Chat with Paul Dickson |url=http://wordsmith.org/chat/dickson.html |website=wordsmith.org}}</ref>

==Neighborhoods==
{{more citations needed section|date=February 2014}}
Though Yonkers contains many small residential enclaves and communities, it can conveniently be divided into four quarters, demarcated by the Saw Mill River. There are 37 or more distinct neighborhoods, though many of these names are rarely used today except by older residents and real-estate brokers.

===Northeast Yonkers===

Northeast Yonkers is a primarily [[Irish-American]] and [[Italian-American]] area. House sizes vary widely, from small houses set close together, to larger homes in areas like Lawrence Park West and mid-rise apartment buildings along Central Avenue ([[NY 100]]). Central Avenue (officially named Central Park Avenue) provides an abundance of shopping for Yonkers residents. Shopping 
centers along Central Avenue include stores such as Best Buy, Burlington Coat Factory, Kohl's, Bob's Furniture and Barnes & Noble, as well as many other stores and restaurants. Notable former residents include [[Steven Tyler]] (born Steven Tallarico) of the rock band [[Aerosmith]], whose childhood home was located at 100 Pembrook Drive.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Northeast Yonkers contains the upscale neighborhoods of [[Crestwood, Yonkers, New York|Crestwood]], Colonial Heights, and Cedar Knolls, as well as the wealthy enclaves of Beech Hill and Lawrence Park West. It also contains a gated community off the eastern edge of the Grassy Sprain Reservoir known as [[Winchester Villages]]. Landmarks include [[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary|St Vladimir's Seminary]], as well as [[Sarah Lawrence College]], and the Tanglewood Shopping Center (one-time home of [[The Tanglewood Boys]] gang). Northeast Yonkers is somewhat more expensive than the rest of the city, and due to the proximity of several [[Metro-North]] commuter railroad stations, its residents tend to be employed in corporate positions in [[Manhattan]].

===Northwest Yonkers===
Northwest Yonkers is a collection of widely varying neighborhoods, spanning from the [[Hudson River]] to around the [[New York State Thruway]]/I-87 and from Ashburton Avenue north to the [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-on-Hudson]] border. With the Hudson River bordering it to the west, this area has many [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-era homes]] with panoramic views of [[New Jersey Palisades|the Palisades]]. An interest in historic preservation has taken hold in this neighborhood in recent years,{{when|date=March 2019}} as demonstrated on streets like Shonnard Terrace, Delavan Terrace, and Hudson Terrace.

Neighborhoods include Nepera Park, [[Runyon Heights, Yonkers|Runyon Heights]], Homefield, Glenwood, and Greystone. Landmarks include the [[Hudson River Museum]], the Lenoir Nature Preserve, and the nationally recognized Untermyer Park and Gardens. The significant amount of surviving Victorian architecture and 19th-century estates in northwest Yonkers has attracted many filmmakers in recent years. In fact, the Untermyer Park and Gardens is not only Yonkers hidden gem but is the number one attraction in Westchester County.

The two block section of Palisade Avenue between Chase and Roberts Avenues in northwest Yonkers is colloquially known as "the north end" or "the end". It was and still is the only retail area in the neighborhood, and was well known for an original soda fountain store, "Urich's," and Robbins Pharmacy. It was once the end of the #2 trolley line, which has since been replaced by a [[Bee-Line Bus System|Bee-line Bus]] route. One part of Yonkers that is sometimes overlooked is Nepera Park. This is a small section at the northern part of Nepperhan Avenue on the Hastings-on-Hudson border. Nepperhan Avenue in Nepera Park is also a major shopping district for the area.

===Southeast Yonkers===
Southeast Yonkers is mostly Irish-American (many of the Irish being native born) and Italian-American. Many of the businesses and type of architecture in southeast Yonkers bear a greater resemblance to certain parts of [[the Bronx]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], or [[Staten Island]] than to points north. Southeastern Yonkers is largely within walking distance of the [[Woodlawn, Bronx|Woodlawn]] and [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] sections of the Bronx. Many residents regard eastern McLean Avenue, home to a vibrant Irish community shared with Woodlawn, to be the true hub of Yonkers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Similarly, a portion of Midland Avenue in the [[Dunwoodie, Yonkers, New York|Dunwoodie]] section has been called the "Little Italy" of Yonkers. Landmarks of southeastern Yonkers include the [[Cross County Shopping Center]], Yonkers Raceway, and [[St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie|St. Joseph's Seminary]] in the Dunwoodie neighborhood, which was visited by [[Pope John Paul II]] in October 1995 and later by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in April 2008.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===Southwest Yonkers===
[[Getty Square]] is Yonkers's [[downtown]] and the [[civic center]] and [[central business district]] of the city. Much of southwest Yonkers grew densely along the multiple railroads and trolley (now bus) lines along South Broadway and in [[Getty Square]], connecting to [[New York City]]. Clusters of apartment buildings surrounded the stations of the Yonkers branch of the [[New York and Putnam Railroad]] and the [[Third Avenue Railway]] trolley lines and these buildings still remain although now served by the [[Bee-Line Bus System]]. The railroad companies themselves built neighborhoods of mixed housing types ranging from apartment buildings to large mansions in areas like [[Park Hill, Yonkers|Park Hill]] wherein the railroad also built a [[funicular]] to connect it with the train station in the valley. This traditionally African-American and white area has seen a tremendous influx of immigrants from Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, South Asia, and the Middle East. Off South Broadway and Yonkers Avenue one can find residential neighborhoods, such as Lowerre, Nodine Hill, [[Park Hill, Yonkers|Park Hill]], and Hudson Park (off the Hudson River) with a mix of building styles ranging from dense clusters of apartment buildings, blocks of retail with apartments above, multifamily [[row house]]s, and detached single-family homes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yonkers Victorian Homes |url=http://www.victoriansource.com/id4.html |website=victoriansource.com}}</ref>

Other neighborhoods of these types, although with a larger number of detached houses, are Ludlow Park, Hudson Park, and Van Cortlandt Crest, off Riverdale Avenue next to the border with [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]].

The area is also home to significant historical and educational institutions including the historic [[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor Hall]] (a New York State Historic Site that houses one of three papier-mache ceilings in the United States), The [[Science Barge]], Beczak Environmental Education Center, and a 2003 [[Yonkers Public Library]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 7, 2008 |title=Welcome to the Yonkers Public Library!-Hours and Directions |url=http://www.ypl.org/hoursanddirec.htm#RIV |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729014156/http://www.ypl.org/hoursanddirec.htm#RIV |archive-date=July 29, 2008 |access-date=May 6, 2009 |website=Ypl.org}}</ref>

Many residents are of [[African American|African]], [[Caribbean]], [[Italian people|Italian]], or [[Mexican people|Mexican]] descent while an influx those from other cultural backgrounds has continued to shape a culturally diverse community. Some neighborhoods right on the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] border are increasingly becoming home to [[Orthodox Jew]]s. The revitalization of the [[Getty Square]] area has helped to nurture growth for Southwest Yonkers.

In the early 2000s several new luxury apartment buildings were built along the Hudson. There is also a new "Sculpture Meadow on the Hudson," renovation of a Victorian-era pier, and a new public library housed in the remodeled Otis elevator factory. [[Peter X. Kelly|Peter Kelly]]'s award-winning fine dining restaurant X<sub>2</sub>0 - Xaviars on Hudson is located at the renovated pier with much success.<ref>Johnson, Liz (February 3, 2010).
