'''Tanjong Karang''' is a [[mukim]] in [[Kuala Selangor District]], [[Selangor]], [[Malaysia]]. It is loosely translated into English as the "Cape of Corals". Tanjong Karang town is divided by the Sungai Tengi at the middle but connected with a bridge. The local Chinese minority lives in the urban and seaside area, while most Malays live in rural areas and perform agricultural activities, particularly [[rice]] cultivation.

==Ban Canal==
There is a large [[canal]] that starts from Tanjong Karang which crossed but merged using watergate to Sungai Tengi. The canal ends in the district of [[Sabak Bernam]]. It was first built during the colonial era and is often called by the locals as ''bangkenal''. Its function is to provide enough water to irrigate the rice crops; it is also used by a water supply company to provide treated water and as a place for freshwater fish farming among the villagers. In the past, this canal is involved in the forest harvesting activities. It serves as a router in sweeping the harvested [[timber]] by drifting it over the water to the 'Headworks' where the collection works is done for land transportation.

There are myths from the older people who claimed there was a giant [[snake]] found during the construction of this canal. It led to the cessation of further construction work at Seri Tiram.

==Historic building==
There is an old historic building left without care at Kampung Sungai Kajang. It is believed that the building was at one time a palm sugar processing plant built during the colonial period. During the [[Second World War]], the [[factory]] was captured and used as a Japanese military base. Some effects of the ravages of battle can be seen today. Only a small portion of the structure is maintained while almost the entire plant has been destroyed, whether caused by [[agriculture]] or [[land development]].
