A '''lead single''' is the first [[Single (music)|single]] to be released from a studio [[album]], by a [[musician]] or a [[Band (music)|band]], usually before the album itself is released.

==Early singles==

During the era of the [[phonograph record]], all music was sold as what is now termed a single, one potential [[hit single|hit song]] backed by an additional song of generally less commercial appeal on a single ten-inch [[78 rpm]] [[shellac]] record. After the launch of the [[LP record|long-playing microgroove record]] in 1948 and the arrival of the 45 rpm [[single (music)|single]] the following year, singles continued to appear separately from albums into the 1960s. For instance, the early [[rock and roll]] market of the 1950s and early 1960s was very much focused on singles rather than albums. Songs such as "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", "[[Johnny B. Goode]]", and "[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]" only appeared later on album compilations of singles. Even through the 1960s, leading rock artists such as [[The Beatles]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[The Rolling Stones]] issued songs such as "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]", "[[Penny Lane]]", "[[Good Vibrations]]", "[[Positively 4th Street]]", and "[[Honky Tonk Women]]" as singles apart from any contemporary albums.

==Shifting to album singles==

This changed in the 1970s as the popular music industry shifted to the album as its main profit center. Singles became advertisements for an album, the lead single conceptually defined as a foretaste of the album to come. On average a lead single will appear about one month before the album's release date. "[[Go Your Own Way]]" from ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'', "[[Miss You (The Rolling Stones song)|Miss You]]" from ''[[Some Girls]]'', and "[[The Girl Is Mine]]" from ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' all roughly follow this pattern. This has become a common practice through the 21st century for album-oriented recording artists.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://liron-music.com/ |title= שיר במתנה }} Tuesday, 24 December 2019 </ref>

==More than one lead single from an album==

In the 2000s, a common trend developed to release a lead single months in advance of the album release date. It has equally become common for a second lead single to be released before the release of the album. For example, [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] issued the lead single "[[Love in this Club]]" four months prior to the May 29, 2008 release of ''[[Here I Stand (Usher album)|Here I Stand]]''. The second single "[[Love in This Club, Pt. II]]" was released one month before the album release date. Another example is [[Justin Timberlake]]'s 2013 album, ''[[The 20/20 Experience]]'', which was released on March 19, 2013. The first single off it is "[[Suit & Tie]]", released 2 months before the album hit stores. One month prior to the release of the album, another lead single called, "[[Mirrors (Justin Timberlake song)|Mirrors]]", was released.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18548-justin-timberlake-the-2020-experience-2-of-2 |title=Justin Timberlake: The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2 |work=Pitchfork |date=October 1, 2013 |accessdate=February 17, 2019 |author=Dombal, Ryan}}</ref> Katy Perry released "[[California Gurls]]" as a single on May 7, 2010, and "[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]" on July 23, 2010, leading to the release of the album ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'' on August 24, 2010. [[Ed Sheeran]] did something similar, releasing both "[[Shape of You]]" and "[[Castle on the Hill]]", both releasing on January 6, 2017 as double lead singles from his album ''[[÷ (album)|÷]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2017/01/ed-sheeran-castle-on-hill-shape-of-you-divide |title=Ed Sheeran returns with two new tracks "Castle on the Hill" and "Shape of You" |work=Complex |date=January 6, 2017 |accessdate=June 12, 2019 |author=Espinoza, Joshua}}</ref>

==Lead singles of albums in the 21st century==

Artists often choose songs that are more [[up-tempo]] as lead singles.  Such songs are often catchier and attract attention toward listeners. However, the subsequent lead single might be slower in tempo in order to demonstrate the range of the album. Female vocalists like [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] often maintain a formula of an up-tempo first lead single with a slow [[ballad]] follow-up. For example, two singles were released by [[Miley Cyrus]] before her album ''[[Bangerz]]'' - an up-tempo track called, "[[We Can't Stop]]" was released as the first single, and a slow-ballad song, "[[Wrecking Ball (Miley Cyrus song)|Wrecking Ball]]" as the second. This was a successful practice of 1980s [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands. However, not all artists decide to choose their lead single with the up-tempo criteria. Artists may release a lead single that has a message they want to convey to listeners instead of a song with more commercial potential, such as [[Fall Out Boy]] who chose to release "[[This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race]]" over the radio friendly "[[Thnks fr th Mmrs]]".<ref name="RSDeets">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-fall-out-boy-album-deets-20061116|title=Exclusive: Fall Out Boy Album Deets|date=November 16, 2006|accessdate=December 12, 2014|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref>

Japanese artists such as [[Ayumi Hamasaki]], [[Namie Amuro]] and [[B'z]] may release four to eight singles prior to their albums in order to achieve record-breaking debut-week sales. The lead singles in Japan are very heavily advertised and promoted, in some cases even more than the album itself. With album sales continuously declining in the United States, record labels often release singles prior to the album's release date to online music retailers including [[iTunes]], ranging in price from $0.99 to $1.29. This trend has become increasingly popular in many markets.

In the late 2010s, artists began a trend of releasing multiple singles before eventually releasing a studio album. An unnamed A&R representative confirmed to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 2018 that "an artist has
to build a foundation to sustain" and adding that "When artists have one big record and go run with that, it doesn’t work because they never had a foundation to
begin with." The same article cited examples such as [[Cardi B]], [[Camila Cabello]] and [[Jason Derulo]] releasing four or more singles prior to their album releases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-your-favorite-artist-is-releasing-more-singles-than-ever-629130/|title=Why Your Favorite Artist Is Releasing More Singles Than Ever|website=Rolling Stone|date=6 May 2018|accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref>
