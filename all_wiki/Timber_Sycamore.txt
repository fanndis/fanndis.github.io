'''Timber Sycamore''' was a classified weapons supply and training program run by the [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and supported by some Arab intelligence services, such as the security service in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Launched in 2012 or 2013, it supplied money, weaponry and training to [[Syrian opposition|rebel forces]] fighting Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]] in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. According to US officials, the program was run by the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]]<ref>Sanchez, Raf (3 September 2013). "First Syria rebels armed and trained by CIA 'on way to battlefield'".

The program's existence was suspected after the US Federal Business Opportunities website publicly solicited contract bids to ship tons of weaponry from Eastern Europe to [[Taşucu]], Turkey and [[Aqaba]], Jordan.<ref name=janes-20160408/> One consequence of the program has been a flood of US weapons including assault rifles, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades into Middle East's black market.

In July 2017, US officials stated that Timber Sycamore would be phased out, with funds possibly redirected to fighting the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), or to offering rebel forces defensive capabilities.<ref name="jaffe">{{cite news|last1=Jaffe|first1=Greg|last2=Entous|first2=Adam|title=Trump ends covert CIA program to arm anti-Assad rebels in Syria, a move sought by Moscow|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-ends-covert-cia-program-to-arm-anti-assad-rebels-in-syria-a-move-sought-by-moscow/2017/07/19/b6821a62-6beb-11e7-96ab-5f38140b38cc_story.html|accessdate=20 July 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=19 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=wp-20170720/><ref>{{cite news|author=Ali Watkins|title=Top general confirms end to secret U.S. program in Syria|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/21/tony-thomas-syria-secret-program-cia-240818|accessdate=20 July 2017|work=Politico|date=21 July 2017}}</ref>

Prior to the Syrian Civil War, southern Syria and northern Jordan were a conduit for other smuggling operations.<ref name=national /> The advent of the war transformed the region into a center for smuggling weapons, and the more formal support provided by Timber Sycamore only intensified the scale of smuggling operations on the border.<ref name=national /> Major smuggling centers include [[bazaar]]s established at [[Ma'an]] in southern Jordan, [[Sahab district|Sahab]] in Amman, and in the [[Jordan River]] Valley.<ref name="giornale">{{cite news|last1=Biloslavo|first1=Fausto|title=Finite sul mercato nero le armi che la Cia ha dato ai ribelli siriani|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica/finite-sul-mercato-nero-armi-che-cia-ha-dato-ai-ribelli-1276766.html|accessdate=22 September 2016|work=Il Giornale|date=28 March 2016}}</ref>

An investigation by journalists Phil Sands and Suha Maayeh revealed that rebels supplied with weapons from the Amman MOC sold a portion of them to local arms dealers, often to raise cash to pay additional fighters. Some MOC-supplied weapons were sold to [[Bedouin]] traders referred to locally as "The Birds" in [[Lajat]], a volcanic plateau northeast of [[Daraa]], Syria. According to rebel forces, the Bedouins would then trade the weapons to ISIL, who would place orders using the encrypted [[WhatsApp]] messaging service.

==Phasing out==
In July 2017, anonymous officials stated that President [[Donald Trump]], in consultation with National Security Adviser [[H. R. McMaster]] and CIA Director [[Mike Pompeo]], had decided to phase out support for anti-Assad Syrian rebel forces, possibly redirecting resources to fighting ISIL, to offering rebel forces defensive capabilities, or to other operations in the region.<ref name="jaffe" />

The officials said that the decision was made prior to Trump's participation in the [[2017 G20 Hamburg summit|G-20 summit]] and 7 July meeting with Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]]. Several officials characterized the decision as a "major concession" to Russia, with one remarking: "Putin won in Syria."<ref name="jaffe" /> However, another official stated that ending the program was not a major concession due to Assad's recent victories in the Syrian Civil War, but rather "a signal to Putin that the administration wants to improve ties to Russia."<ref name="walcott">{{cite news|last1=Walcott|first1=John|title=Trump ends CIA arms support for anti-Assad Syria rebels: U.S. officials|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-usa-syria-idUSKBN1A42KC|accessdate=20 July 2017|agency=Reuters|date=19 July 2017}}</ref> Some members of the Obama administration reportedly had wished to scrap the program because some rebels armed and trained by the program had joined ISIL and related groups.<ref name="walcott" />

== Commentary ==
=== Press ===
According to [[Rachel Marsden]] writing for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', the CIA and Saudi Arabia intended for Timber Sycamore to allow independent military forces to drive out Assad, install a Syrian leader friendly to US, Saudi and Qatari interests, and weaken Russia's influence in the Middle East.<ref name="marsden">{{cite news|last1=Marsden|first1=Rachel|title=Russia and America should unite against Saudi-China alliance|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bal-russia-and-america-should-unite-against-saudi-china-alliance-20160414-story.html|accessdate=20 September 2016|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=18 April 2016}}</ref>

Reporter [[Paul Malone]] wrote that weapons delivered by Timber Sycamore might be acquired by [[al-Qaeda in Syria]], comparing the program to [[Operation Cyclone|CIA support for the Afghan mujahideen]], or American weaponry being seized by ISIL in 2014 in Mosul, Iraq.<ref name=ct />

The ''[[International Business Times]] of Italy'' has written that corrupt Jordanian intelligence officials facilitated weapons trafficking that supported the Iraqi insurgency after the US-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. For this reason, according to the paper, the Obama administration was reluctant to approve Timber Sycamore and debated a year before doing so.<ref name=barrile />

In ''[[Il Giornale]]'', [[Fausto Biloslavo]] has reported that despite the program's secrecy, US Vice President [[Joe Biden]] was photographed at the center of [[Zarqa]] in March 2015.<ref name=giornale />

In April 2014, [[Seymour Hersh]] published an essay in the ''London Review of Books'' in which he explores an anonymous former Pentagon official's claims that the U.S. diplomatic post in Libya's [[Benghazi]] "had no real political role" and existed solely to provide cover for a secret arms pipeline supporting Syrian rebels fighting in the Syrian Civil War.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hersh, Seymour M |title=The Red Line and the Rat Line|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line|publisher=London Review of Books|date=17 April 2014|author-link=Seymour Hersh}}</ref> According to Hersh's source, the "rat line" was a means for channeling military weapons from Gaddafi's arsenals into Syria and into the hands of Syrian rebels.
