[[Tennis]] competitions at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]] were held from August 10 to August 17 at the [[Olympic Green Tennis Centre]]. The [[DecoTurf]] surface rendered the event a [[hardcourt]] tournament.

The [[Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women's singles|women's singles event]] proved notable for being one of only two Olympiads — and the first since [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] — in which all tennis medalists were from the same country, Russia.<ref name=Russia>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/summer08/tennis/news/story?id=3539303|title=Dementieva beats Russian compatriot Safina for gold|date=2008-08-17|accessdate=2008-08-17|publisher=ESPN.com}}</ref>

==Qualification==
{{Main|Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Qualification}}
The majority of players in the singles competitions (56 of 64 players in the draw) gained entry through their position in either the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] (men) or [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] (women) rankings. The remaining eight places were given to six players who gained ITF places (wild cards) and two who received invitations from the Tripartite Commission, which were intended to go to [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) with small teams.<ref name=System>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_31490_original.PDF|title=IOC Qualification System Summary – Men and Women|publisher=ITF|date=2008-03-13|accessdate=2008-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/olympics/news/newsarticle.asp?articleid=18514|title=Olympic Tripartite Invitation places announced|publisher=ITF|date=2008-03-31|accessdate=2008-08-19}}</ref> For the doubles competitions, 10 players qualified directly.

In the women's singles, the ITF places went to [[Alicia Molik]], a bronze medalist in 2004, and [[Chan Yung-jan]], a young player, with the remaining spots going to [[Mariya Koryttseva]], [[Nuria Llagostera Vives]], [[Ayumi Morita]], [[Selima Sfar]] (a veteran Fed Cup player), and [[Tamarine Tanasugarn]], who gained the retrospective place.<ref name=ITFplaces/>

===Men's Singles===
By winning gold in this Beijing Olympics, Rafael Nadal cemented his place in tennis history by winning gold in his first try. In the calendar year preceding the 2008 Olympics, there was a shift at the hierarchy of men's tennis as [[Rafael Nadal]] displaced [[Roger Federer]] as the world number one, after his [[ATP Tour records#Rankings|record consecutive 237-week stay]] at the top of the rankings. From the second round of the [[2008 Hamburg Masters]] to the semi-finals of the [[2008 Cincinnati Masters]] (the last tournament before the Games), winning the [[2008 French Open|French Open]] and [[2008 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] in between, Nadal had won 32 consecutive matches.<ref name=No.1>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7539389.stm|title=Djokovic ends Nadal's winning run|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2008-08-03|accessdate=2008-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atptennis.com/3/en/players/playerprofiles/playeractivity.asp?query=Singles&year=2008&player=N409&selTournament=0&prevtrnnum=0|title=2008 playing activity for Rafael Nadal|publisher=ATP|accessdate=2008-08-15}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Due to the way the rankings are accrued, Nadal became number one on August 18, the day after the Olympic tournament, although this had been confirmed earlier.<ref name=No.1/> Nadal was therefore considered a strong favorite, as was Federer, who, despite reaching two Grand Slam finals, had had a poor year by his standards.<ref name=Preview>{{cite web |url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/sports/headlines/tennis/n214520681.shtml |title=Olympic Tennis Preview: World's best on Beijing courts |publisher=Official website of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games |date=2008-08-09 |accessdate=2008-08-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814141022/http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/sports/headlines/tennis/n214520681.shtml |archivedate=2008-08-14 }}</ref> Other top-ten players considered to be favorites included the reigning [[2008 Australian Open|Australian Open]] champion, [[Novak Djokovic]], Spanish world No. 4 and [[2007 Tennis Masters Cup]] finalist [[David Ferrer]], [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]], [[David Nalbandian]], [[Nikolay Davydenko]] and British player [[Andy Murray]], who was lauded in the British press after winning the Cincinnati tournament and reaching the semi-finals of the previous week's [[2008 Canada Masters|Toronto Masters]].<ref name=Preview/><ref name=Preview2>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-07/17/content_8561583.htm|title=Tennis preview: Beijing to witness strongest field ever in Olympic tennis tournament|publisher=www.chinaview.cn|author=Wang Jimin|date=2008-07-17|accessdate=2008-08-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824152811/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-07/17/content_8561583.htm|archivedate=2008-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/2498083/Andy-Murray-targets-Olympics-and-US-Open-after-Masters-Series-triumph---Tennis.html|title=Andy Murray targets Olympics and US Open after Masters Series triumph|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|author=Telegraph staff and agencies|date=2008-08-04|accessdate=2008-08-15 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article4456443.ece|title=Andy Murray eyes Olympic Games gold after Masters win|work=[[The Times]]|author=Times Online and agencies|date=2008-08-04|accessdate=2008-08-15 | location=London}}</ref>

Three Chinese nationals appeared in the men's draw, but none qualified automatically, with [[Sun Peng]] relying on the places issued by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF), and [[Yu Xinyuan]] and [[Zeng Shao-Xuan]] replacing withdrawn players as alternates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_35058_original.PDF|title=Men's Singles draw|publisher=ITF|date=2008-08-07|accessdate=2008-08-15|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911023630/http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_35058_original.PDF|archivedate=2008-09-11}}</ref>

By losing the final and thus settling for silver, Chile's [[Fernando González]] became the sixth tennis player, and fourth male player, in history to have won gold, silver and bronze medals in Olympic tennis. Following his gold medal, Nadal would later become just the second man to win a [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Golden Slam|Golden Slam]] - Olympic gold in addition to the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open - with victory at the 2010 US Open (the first man to win a Golden Slam had been [[Andre Agassi]], who completed his set at the 1999 French Open after winning gold in Atlanta in 1996.) He would also be elected as Team Spain's flagbearer for the opening ceremony in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 after being forced to withdraw from the London 2012 tournament at Wimbledon due to tendinitis.

==Competition==

===Format===
The tennis competition at the Olympic Games consisted of a [[single elimination]] tournament. The size of the singles draw, 64, meant that there were six rounds of competition in total,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/olympics/drawsheets/index.asp|title=Men's Singles Main Draw: 1st Round|publisher=ITF|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> with five in the doubles owing to its smaller draw size of 32.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/olympics/drawsheets/index.asp?Tournament=1100018553&Event=1100104056|title=Men's Doubles Main Draw: 1st Round|publisher=ITF|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> Players reaching the semi-final were assured of an opportunity to compete for a medal, as the two losers in the semi-finals contested a [[bronze medal]] match.

Matches were ''best-of-3 sets'', except for the Men's singles and doubles finals which were ''best-of-5 sets''.

'''''Note:''''' ''due to rain delays the Women's Singles schedule was pushed back a day.''

===Day 1===
[[File:Arnaud Clément Jeux olympiques 2008.jpg|thumb|French player [[Arnaud Clément]]]]
On Day 1, the conditions were at a [[humidity]] level of 89%, and ITF commentators felt that this, along with the heat and smog, would result in [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] for some players, especially in longer matches. Play did not begin at the scheduled time of 10 a.m., and was delayed until 12.53 p.m., when number eight seed [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]] began his match against [[Chris Guccione (tennis)|Chris Guccione]] on the Centre Court. The Women's Singles competition also commenced. However, play was suspended again at 4.26 p.m., and eventually cancelled for the rest of the day.<ref name=Day1>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/olympics/news/gamewatch.asp?articleid=19099|title=As it happened – Day 1: Sunday 10 August|publisher=International Tennis Federation (ITF)|date=2008-08-10|accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref>

Only nine matches of the 20 scheduled matches were completed as a consequence of the rain-disrupted sessions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/sports/headlines/tennis/n214525363.shtml |title=Rain interrupts Day One of Tennis |publisher=The official website of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games |date=2008-08-10 |accessdate=2008-12-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203235856/http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/sports/headlines/tennis/n214525363.shtml |archivedate=2009-02-03 }}</ref> Blake progressed, as did fourth seeded Russian [[Nikolay Davydenko]], Chilean [[Fernando González]], Czech [[Tomáš Berdych]], and Argentine [[Guillermo Cañas]], who benefited from a retirement from his opponent [[Frédéric Niemeyer]], who was a set up, and said that he withdrew from the match in order to save himself for his doubles match with [[Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's doubles|Sydney champion]] [[Daniel Nestor]] (their match eventually took place the following day).<ref name=Day1/> Blake said that he had been inspired to victory by [[United States at the 2008 Summer Olympics|fellow American]] [[Michael Phelps]], who won his first of eight gold medals in [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics|swimming]], in the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's 400 metre individual medley|400 metre individual medley]], on the same day. In the women's draw, Dane [[Caroline Wozniacki]], Australian [[Samantha Stosur]], Italian [[Francesca Schiavone]], and Bulgarian [[Tsvetana Pironkova]] all progressed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/tennis/7552375.stm|title=Murrays delayed by Beijing rain|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2008-08-10|accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref>

===Day 2===
On Day 2, humidity levels again proved to be unfavourable for players, with some saying that it was the worst they had ever played in. Play was only mildly interrupted by rain, with three scheduled matches failing to reach their conclusion. Defending champion [[Nicolás Massú]] defeated [[Steve Darcis]] (Belgium), and  [[Rafael Nadal]] came through against [[Potito Starace]] (Italy) in three sets, in what the [[BBC]] described as a "tough" match. [[Roger Federer]], still the top seed, progressed, as did other seeds such as Serb [[Novak Djoković]], Argentine [[David Nalbandian]], Frenchman [[Gilles Simon]], and Swiss [[Stanislas Wawrinka]]. Former world number one [[Lleyton Hewitt]] came through a testing match against [[Jonas Björkman]], 7–5, 7–6(2), and [[Rafael Arevalo]], one of the three players to be invited by the Tripartite Commission, won against [[Lee Hyung-taik]], in what was his first match against a top 100 player. The highest seed to exit was Spain's [[David Ferrer]] (number five). The number six seed, Britain's [[Andy Murray]], also lost, playing against [[Chinese Taipei at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Chinese Taipei]] representative [[Lu Yen-hsun]]. Along with Ferrer, number fourteen seed [[Nicolás Almagro]] and the unseeded [[Tommy Robredo]] also exited, meaning that three of the four Spanish representatives in the men's singles went out.<ref name=Day2>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/olympics/news/gamewatch.asp?articleid=19110|title=As it happened – Day 2: Monday 11 August|publisher=ITF|date=2008-08-11|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref><ref name=BBCDay2>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/tennis/7553350.stm|title=Nadal comes through tough opener|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2008-08-11|accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref>

In the women's singles, [[María José Martínez Sánchez]] became the first player to progress on the day, knocking out [[Alicia Molik]]. Second seed [[Jelena Janković]] won, as did American [[Serena Williams]], Russian [[Elena Dementieva]], Slovakian [[Daniela Hantuchová]], and Frenchwoman [[Alizé Cornet]] amongst others, in their first round matches. Two seeds fell, both to Chinese opponents: [[Li Na]] defeated number three seed [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] (Russia), and number 11 [[Ágnes Szávay]] (Hungary) lost to [[Zheng Jie]]. Afterwards, Zheng, a native of [[Sichuan]], said the courage shown by the victims of the [[Sichuan earthquake|earthquake in May 2008]] had helped inspire her to victory.<ref name=Day2/><ref name=BBCDay2/>

The men's doubles competition also began, having originally been scheduled to start on Day 1. [[Chris Guccione (tennis)|Chris Guccione]] and [[Lleyton Hewitt]] (Australia) defeated [[Agustín Calleri]] and [[Juan Mónaco]] (Argentina) 4–6, 7–6(4), 18–16. The match, which lasted three hours and 17 minutes, was the longest (in games, in a three set match) in Olympic history at 61. The previous record was held by [[Todd Woodbridge]] and [[Mark Woodforde]] (Australia) and [[Jacco Eltingh]] and [[Paul Haarhuis]] (Netherlands), who competed a 54-game match (6–2, 5–7, 18–16) at the [[Tennis at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Men's doubles|1996 event]]. Elsewhere, defending champions Massu and Gonzalez exited, [[Steve Darcis]] and [[Olivier Rochus]] (Belgium) defeated [[Guillermo Cañas]] and [[David Nalbandian]] (Argentina) in a match that exceeded two and a half hours, and Canada's only doubles team of Nestor and Niemeyer lost to the Murray brothers of Andy and [[Jamie Murray|Jamie]] (Great Britain). Federer and Nadal both came through, with their partners Wawrinka and Robredo, respectively.<ref name=Day2/><ref name=BBCDay2/>

===Day 3===
Federer, Nadal, and Djoković, the top three seeds respectively, all saw safe passage into the second round on Day 3. However, Federer's countryman Wawrinka exited after losing to Austrian [[Jürgen Melzer]], in what the ITF commentary team called a "bad loss". Notable losers included Massu, who went out to number seven seed Nalbandian; and Davydenko, the third seed, who lost to [[Paul-Henri Mathieu]] (France). [[Gilles Simon]] and [[Gaël Monfils]] were two other French players to progress to the third round. The match between [[Nicolas Kiefer]] (Germany) and [[Kevin Anderson (tennis)|Kevin Anderson]] became the longest singles match of the tournament up to that point, lasting three hours and twenty minutes, with Kiefer prevailing.<ref name=Day3/><ref name=BBCDay3>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/tennis/7555533.stm|title=Easy wins for Federer and Nadal|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2008-08-12|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref>

Seeds who progressed in the women's singles included Janković (Serbia), the Williams sisters (United States), [[Vera Zvonareva]] (Russia), and [[Victoria Azarenka]] (Belarus). Number ten seed [[Daniela Hantuchová]] (Slovakia), who was being watched by her country's [[head of state]], [[Ivan Gašparovič]], lost to rising star [[Caroline Wozniacki]] (Denmark), and the number eight seed [[Agnieszka Radwańska]] (Poland) lost to Italy's Francesca Schiavone. Number thirteen seed [[Patty Schnyder]] (Switzerland) also lost. One of the Chinese hopefuls, Peng, had the President of the [[Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games]] (BOCOG), [[Liu Qui]], courtside for her match against Alizé Cornet, but she was beaten in two sets. Her compatriot, Zheng, came through another long match.<ref name=Day3/><ref name=BBCDay3/>

In the doubles, Bahamian [[Mark Knowles]], a Grand Slam champion and the world number seven coming into the event, was knocked out, partnering [[Devin Mullings]], by the [[Bryan brothers]] (United States). Mullings came into the Olympic tournament without a doubles ranking, and with a singles ranking of 1017. Other teams progressing including [[Martin Damm]] and [[Pavel Vízner]] (Czech Republic), who defeated Djoković and [[Nenad Zimonjić]] (Serbia). In the women's doubles, [[Liezel Huber]] and [[Lindsay Davenport]] (United States), both former Grand Slam doubles champions, came through. The other American team in the draw, the Williams sisters, came through a tough match against the Czech team of [[Iveta Benešová]] and [[Nicole Vaidišová]], as did Zheng and Yan against the Slovak team of Hantuchová and [[Janette Husárová]]. The Russian team of [[Dinara Safina]] and [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]], which combined two top ten singles players, progressed too.<ref name=Day3/><ref name=BBCDay3/>

==Ranking points==
Rankings points determine the position of a player in the [[ATP Entry Ranking|ATP]] (men's) and [[Women's Tennis Association#Ranking|WTA (women's) rankings]], which are based on players' performances in the previous 52-weeks. For the Olympics, the men's player who won received 400 ranking points<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/olympics/event/ranking.asp|title=Ranking Points 2008 (Olympic Tennis Event)|publisher=ITF|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>—put in perspective, this was 100 more than a win at the most prestigious [[International Series Gold]] tournaments, 100 less than a [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|Masters Series]] win, and 600 less than a triumph at one of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atptennis.com/en/players/ATP_Rulebook2008.pdf|title=The ATP 2008 Official Rulebook (p. 153)|publisher=ATP|accessdate=2008-08-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
