The paper is also one of the "big three" broadsheet-quality newspapers in Denmark along with ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' and ''[[Politiken]]''.

''Berlingske'' has won many awards. It is the only newspaper in the world to have won the [[World Press Photo|World Press Photo Award]] 3 times. It also won the most prestigious journalistic award in Denmark, the Cavling prize, in 2009. In addition, it was awarded the European Newspaper of the Year in the category of national newspaper by the European Newspapers Congress in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=European Newspaper Award 12+1|url=http://enc.newsroom.de/lang/en/archiv-archive/2012-2/wettbewerbaward/|work=European Newspaper Congress|accessdate=1 August 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810095515/http://enc.newsroom.de/lang/en/archiv-archive/2012-2/wettbewerbaward/|archivedate=10 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Following a long period of ownership by the Berling family, the whole Berlingske-group was acquired in 1982 by a group of investors from the Danish corporate establishment including [[Danske Bank]] and [[A.P. Møller Mærsk]]. This takeover saved the group from an impending bankruptcy caused by a long strike period as well as dwindling circulation and advertising revenues.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 2000, Det Berlingske Officin was acquired by the Norwegian industrial conglomerate [[Orkla Group]]; the Danish organization was integrated within a multinational Orkla Media group. In 2006 Orkla Media was sold to the British [[Mecom Group]].<ref name="orkla2">[http://www.ketupa.net/about.htm  Ketupa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911230747/http://www.ketupa.net/about.htm |date=11 September 2008 }} Media Profiles: [http://www.ketupa.net/orkla2.htm Stock values rise: €209m in 2000; €900m in 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917002424/http://www.ketupa.net/orkla2.htm |date=17 September 2008 }} ''Ketupa''</ref>

In January 2011, the newspaper's title was abbreviated to ''Berlingske'' following a large-scale redesign of the newspaper's web and digital presence.<ref name="Madsen">{{cite web|url=http://journalisten.dk/berlingske-tidende-far-nyt-navn|title=Berlingske Tidende får nyt navn|trans-title=Berlingske Tidende gets new name|date=11 January 2011|author=Jens Jørgen Madsen|work=Journalisten|publisher=Danish Journalist Union}}</ref>
