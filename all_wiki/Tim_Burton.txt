He is best known for his [[Gothic film|gothic]] fantasy and horror films such as ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993), ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1999), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (2005), ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' (2007), ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]'' (2012), and ''[[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|Frankenweenie]]'' (2012). He has directed [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] films, such as the adventure-comedy ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' (1985), the superhero films ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) and ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), the sci-fi film ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (2001), the fantasy-drama ''[[Big Fish]]'' (2003), the musical adventure film ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (2005), and the fantasy films ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (2010) and ''[[Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (film)|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]]'' (2016).

Burton has often worked with actor [[Johnny Depp]] and composer [[Danny Elfman]], who has composed scores for all but three of the films Burton has directed. [[Helena Bonham Carter]], Burton's former [[domestic partnership|domestic partner]], has appeared in many of his films. He wrote and illustrated the poetry book ''[[The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories]]'', published in 1997 by British publishing house [[Faber and Faber]], and a compilation of his drawings, sketches, and other artwork, entitled ''The Art of Tim Burton'', was released in 2009. A follow-up to that book, entitled ''The Napkin Art of Tim Burton: Things You Think About in a Bar'', containing sketches made by Burton on [[napkin]]s at bars and restaurants he visited, was released in 2015.

==Early life==
Burton was born in 1958, in [[Burbank, California]], the son of Jean Burton ([[née]] Erickson) (1933–2002), later the owner of a cat-themed gift shop, and William "Bill" Burton (1930–2000), a former minor league baseball player who was working for the Burbank Parks and Recreation Department.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|last=Morgenstern |first=Joe |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/09/magazine/tim-burton-batman-and-the-joker.html?pagewanted=all |title=Tim Burton, Batman and The Joker |newspaper=NYTimes.com |date=April 9, 1989 |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article544489.ece?print=yes&randnumb=1151003209000 | work=The Times | location=London | title=Tim+Burton | accessdate=May 25, 2010 | first=Sadie | last=Gray}}{{dead link|fix-attempted=yes|date=December 2019}}</ref> As a [[Preadolescence|preteen]], Burton would make short films in his backyard on Evergreen Street using crude [[stop motion]] animation techniques or shooting on [[8 mm film|8&nbsp;mm film]] without sound (one of his oldest known juvenile films is ''[[The Island of Doctor Agor]]'', which he made when he was 13 years old). Burton attended Providencia Elementary School in Burbank. Burton went to [[Burbank High School (Burbank, California)|Burbank High School]] but was not a particularly good student. He played on the water polo team at Burbank High. Burton was an introspective person and found pleasure in painting, drawing, and watching movies. His future work would be heavily influenced by the works of such childhood heroes as [[Dr. Seuss]] and [[Roald Dahl]].<ref>Alison McMahan (2005).

==Career==
===1980s===
''Stalk of the Celery Monster'' attracted the attention of [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]]' [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|animation division]], which offered Burton an animator's apprenticeship at the studio.<ref name=VFCal/> He worked as an animator, storyboard artist, graphic designer, art director, and [[concept art]]ist on films such as ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'' (1981), ''[[Tron]]'' (1982), and ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' (1985). His concept art never made it into the finished films.

While at Disney in 1982, Burton made his first short, ''[[Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent]]'', a six-minute black-and-white [[stop motion]] film based on a poem written by Burton, which depicts a young boy who fantasizes that he is his hero [[Vincent Price]], with Price himself providing narration. The film was produced by [[Rick Heinrichs]], whom Burton had befriended while working in the concept art department at Disney. The film was shown at the [[Chicago International Film Festival|Chicago Film Festival]] and released, alongside the teen drama ''[[Tex (film)|Tex]]'', for two weeks in one Los Angeles cinema. This was followed by Burton's first live-action production, ''[[Hansel and Gretel (1983 film)|Hansel and Gretel]]'', a Japanese-themed adaptation of the [[Brothers Grimm]] [[Hansel and Gretel|fairy tale]] for the [[Disney Channel]], which climaxes in a [[kung fu]] fight between Hansel and Gretel and the witch. Having aired once in 1983 at 10:30 pm on Halloween and promptly shelved, prints of the film are extremely difficult to locate, fueling rumors that the project did not exist. The short would finally go on public display in 2009 at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], and again in 2011 as part of the Tim Burton art exhibit at [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Is the Tim Burton Exhibition at LACMA for Kids?|url=http://museumstories.com/2011/09/26/is-lacmas-tim-burton-exhibition-for-kids/|website=museumstories.com|accessdate=March 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Chang|first=Richard|date=3 June 2011|title=Exhibit covers Tim Burton's career as filmmaker and artist|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/burton-303022-tim-art.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=March 6, 2017|website=Orange County Register}}</ref> It was again shown at the [[Seoul Museum of Art]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cha|first=Frances|date=11 December 2012|title=Tim Burton's 'nightmares' become hit museum exhibit|url=http://travel.cnn.com/tim-burtons-nightmares-arrive-seoul-015476/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=March 6, 2017|website=CNN}}</ref>

Burton's next live-action short film, ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]'', was released in 1984. It tells the story of a young boy who tries to revive his dog after it is run over by a car. Filmed in black-and-white, it stars [[Barret Oliver]], [[Shelley Duvall]] (with whom he would work again in 1986, directing an episode of her television series ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]''), and [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]. After ''Frankenweenie'' was completed, Disney fired Burton, under the pretext of him spending the company's resources on a film that would be too dark and scary for children to see.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-editors/tim-burton-disney-fired-181740632.html|title=Tim Burton: How Disney fired me|first=Edward|last=Bovingdon |publisher=[[Yahoo! Inc.]] |date = October 18, 2012}}</ref>

Actor [[Paul Reubens]] saw ''Frankenweenie'' and chose Burton to direct the cinematic spin-off of his popular character [[Pee-wee Herman]], stating on the audio commentary of 2000 DVD release of ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' that as soon as the short began, he was sold on Burton's style. Pee-wee Herman gained mainstream popularity with a successful stage show at [[The Groundlings]] and [[The Roxy (London)|the Roxy]] which was later turned into an [[The Pee-wee Herman Show|HBO special]]. The film, ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'', was made on a budget of $8&nbsp;million and grossed more than $40&nbsp;million at the North American box office. Burton, a fan of the eccentric musical group [[Oingo Boingo]], asked songwriter [[Danny Elfman]] to provide the music for the film. Since then, Elfman has scored every film that Tim Burton has directed, except for ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Calamar|first=Gary|date=28 August 2005|title=Danny Elfman|url=http://www.kcrw.com/music/programs/or/or050828danny_elfman|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|work=The Open Road|publisher=KCRW}}</ref> ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'', and ''[[Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (film)|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]]''.

After directing episodes for the [[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|revitalized version]] of '50s/'60s anthology horror series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and [[Shelley Duvall]]'s ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', Burton directed his next big project: ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), a supernatural [[comedy horror]] about a young couple forced to cope with life after death and the family of pretentious yuppies who invade their treasured New England home. Their teenage daughter, Lydia ([[Winona Ryder]]), has an obsession with death which allows her to see the deceased couple. Starring [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Geena Davis]], and featuring [[Michael Keaton]] as the obnoxious bio-exorcist Beetlejuice, the film grossed $80&nbsp;million on a relatively low budget and won an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]]. It would be converted into a [[Beetlejuice (TV series)|cartoon of the same name]], with Burton playing a role as executive producer, that ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and later [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].

Burton's ability to produce hits with low budgets impressed studio executives, and he received his first big budget film, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''. The production was plagued with problems. Burton repeatedly clashed with the film's producers, [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]], but the most notable debacle involved casting. For the title role, Burton chose to cast Michael Keaton as [[Batman]] following their previous collaboration in ''Beetlejuice'', despite Keaton's average physique, inexperience with action films, and reputation as a comic actor. Although Burton won in the end, the furor over the casting provoked enormous fan animosity, to the extent that Warner Brothers' share price slumped.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Burton had considered it ridiculous to cast a "bulked-up" ultra-masculine man as Batman, insisting that Batman should be an ordinary man who dressed up in an elaborate bat costume to frighten criminals. Burton cast [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] ([[Tim Curry]] being his second choice) in a move that helped assuage fans' fears, as well as attracting older audiences not as interested in a [[superhero film]]. When the film opened in June 1989, it was backed by the biggest marketing and merchandising campaign in film history at the time, and became one of the biggest box office hits of all time, grossing over $250&nbsp;million in the U.S. and $400&nbsp;million worldwide (numbers not adjusted for inflation) and earning critical acclaim for the performances of both Keaton and Nicholson, as well as the film's production aspects, which won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]]. The success of the film helped establish Burton as a profitable director, and it proved to be a huge influence on future superhero films, which eschewed the bright, all-American heroism of [[Richard Donner]]'s ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' for a grimmer, more realistic look and characters with more psychological depth. It also became a major inspiration for the successful 1990s cartoon ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', as the darkness of Burton's film and its sequel allowed for a darker Batman on television.

Burton claimed that the graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' was a major influence on his film adaptation of ''Batman'':

<blockquote>"I was never a giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan&nbsp;– and I think it started when I was a child&nbsp;– is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't know if it was [[dyslexia]] or whatever, but that's why I loved ''The Killing Joke'', because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable."<ref>Tim Burton, ''Burton on Burton: Revised Edition'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 71.</ref></blockquote>

===1990s===
In 1990, Burton co-wrote (with [[Caroline Thompson]]) and directed ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', re-uniting with Winona Ryder from ''Beetlejuice''. His friend [[Johnny Depp]], a teen idol at the end of the 1980s due primarily to his work on the hit TV series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'', was cast in the title role of Edward, who was the creation of an eccentric and old-fashioned inventor (played by [[Vincent Price]] in one of his last screen appearances). Edward looked human, but was left with scissors in the place of hands due to the untimely death of his creator. Set in suburbia (and shot in [[Land o' Lakes, Florida]]), the film is largely seen as Burton's autobiography of his childhood in Burbank. Burton's idea<ref>{{Citation|last=EviLQuicK|title=Edward Scissorhands - Hollywood Backstories - PART1|date=August 31, 2008|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaPob-C7Z3E|access-date=October 9, 2018}}</ref> for the character of Edward Scissorhands came from a drawing he created in high school. Depp wrote a similar comment in the foreword to Mark Salisbury's book, ''Burton on Burton'', regarding his first meeting with Burton over the casting of the film. ''Edward Scissorhands'' is considered one of Burton's best movies by some critics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Biodrowski |first=Steve |url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2000/10/edward-scissorhands-tim-burtons-elephant-man/ |title=Edward Scissorhands&nbsp;– Film & DVD Review |publisher=Cinefantastique Online |date=October 24, 2000 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}</ref> Burton has stated that this is his most personal and meaningful film because it's a representation of him not being able to communicate effectively with others as a teenager.

After the success of ''Batman'', Burton agreed to direct the sequel for Warner Bros. on the condition that he would be granted total control. The result was ''[[Batman Returns]]'', which featured Michael Keaton returning as Batman, and a new triad of villains: [[Danny DeVito]] (as [[Penguin (character)|the Penguin]]), [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] (as [[Catwoman]]) and [[Christopher Walken]] (as [[Max Shreck]], an evil corporate tycoon and original character created for the film). Darker and considerably more personal than its predecessor, concerns were raised that the film was too scary for children. Audiences were more uncomfortable at the film's overt sexuality, personified by the sleek, fetish-inspired styling of Catwoman's costume. Burton made many changes to the Penguin which would subsequently be applied to the character in both comics and television. While in the comics, he was an ordinary man, Burton created a freak of nature resembling a penguin with webbed, flipper-like fingers, a hooked, beak-like nose, and a penguin-like body (resulting in a rotund, obese man). Released in 1992, ''Batman Returns'' grossed $282.8&nbsp;million worldwide, making it a financial success, though not to the extent of its predecessor.

Due to schedule constraints on ''Batman Returns'', Burton produced, but did not direct, ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993) for Disney, originally meant to be a children's book in rhyme. The film was directed by [[Henry Selick]] and written by [[Caroline Thompson]], based on Burton's original story, world, and characters. The film received positive reviews for the stop motion animation, musical score, and original storyline. It was a box office success, grossing $50&nbsp;million. Because of the nature of the film, it was not produced under Disney's name, but rather Disney owned Touchstone Pictures. Disney wanted the protagonist to have eyes,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Puchko|first=Kristy|date=October 13, 2018|title=21 Things You Didn't Know About ''The Nightmare Before Christmas''|language=en|work=Mental Floss|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/60723/21-things-you-didnt-know-about-nightmare-christmas|url-status=live|access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref> but the final iteration did not. Over 100 people worked on this motion picture just to create the characters, and it took three years of work to produce the film.<ref name=":0" /> Burton collaborated with Selick again for ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1996), which Burton co-produced.

In 1994, Burton and frequent co-producer [[Denise Di Novi]] produced the 1994 fantasy-comedy ''[[Cabin Boy]]'', starring comedian [[Chris Elliott]] and directed/written by [[Adam Resnick]]. Burton was originally supposed to direct the film after seeing Elliott perform on ''[[Get a Life (TV series)|Get a Life]]'', but he handed the directing responsibility to Resnick once he was offered ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''. Burton's next film, ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), was of a much smaller scale, depicting the life of infamous director [[Ed Wood]]. Starring Johnny Depp in the title role, the film is an homage to the low-budget science fiction and horror films of Burton's childhood and handles its comical protagonist and his motley band of collaborators with surprising fondness and sensitivity. Owing to creative squabbles during the making of ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'', Danny Elfman declined to score ''Ed Wood'', and the assignment went to [[Howard Shore]]. While a commercial failure at the time of its release, ''Ed Wood'' was well received by critics. [[Martin Landau]] received the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his portrayal of [[Bela Lugosi]], and the film received the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]].

Despite Burton's intention to still lead the ''Batman'' franchise, Warner Bros. considered ''Batman Returns'' too dark and unsafe for children. To attract the young audience, it was decided that [[Joel Schumacher]], who had directed films like ''[[The Client (1994 film)|The Client]]'', would lead [[Batman Forever|the third film]], while Burton would only produce it in conjunction with [[Peter MacGregor-Scott]]. Following this change and the changes made by the new director, Michael Keaton resigned from the lead role and was replaced by [[Val Kilmer]]. Filming for ''Batman Forever'' began in late 1994 with new actors: [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, [[Nicole Kidman]] as Dr. Chase Meridian, [[Chris O'Donnell]] as Dick Grayson/Robin and [[Jim Carrey]] as Edward Nygma/The Riddler; the only two actors who returned after ''Batman Returns'' were [[Pat Hingle]] as Commissioner Gordon and [[Michael Gough]] as Alfred Pennyworth. The film, a combination of the darkness that characterized the saga and colors and neon signs proposed by Schumacher, was a huge box office success, earning $336&nbsp;million. Warner Bros. demanded that Schumacher delete some scenes so the film did not have the same tone as its predecessor, ''Batman Returns'' (later they were added as deleted scenes on the 2005 DVD release).

In 1996, Burton and Selick reunited for the musical fantasy ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'', based on [[James and the Giant Peach|the book]] by [[Roald Dahl]] which contains magical elements and references to drugs and alcohol.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/james-the-giant-peach-author-summary.html|title=James & the Giant Peach: Author & Summary {{!}} Study.com|work=Study.com|access-date=October 9, 2018|language=en}}</ref> The film, a combination of live action and stop motion footage, starred [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Simon Callow]] and [[Jane Leeves]] among others, with Burton producing and Selick directing. The film was mostly praised by critics and was nominated for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Musical or Comedy Score]] (by [[Randy Newman]]).

Elfman and Burton reunited for ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' (1996). Based on a popular science-fiction trading card series, the film was a hybrid of 1950s science fiction and 1970s all-star disaster films. Coincidence made it an inadvertent spoof of the blockbuster ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', which had been released five months earlier. The film boasted an all-star cast, including [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Glenn Close]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Lukas Haas]], [[Martin Short]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Christina Applegate]], and [[Jack Black]].

''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', released in late 1999, had a supernatural setting and starred Johnny Depp as [[Ichabod Crane]], a detective with an interest in forensic science rather than the schoolteacher of [[Washington Irving]]'s [[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow|original tale]]. With ''Sleepy Hollow'', Burton paid homage to the horror films of the English company [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]]. [[Christopher Lee]], one of Hammer's stars, was given a cameo role. A host of Burton regulars appeared in supporting roles ([[Michael Gough]], [[Jeffrey Jones]], and [[Christopher Walken]], among others), and [[Christina Ricci]] was cast as Katrina van Tassel. A well-regarded supporting cast was headed by [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Michael Gambon]], [[Richard Griffiths]] and [[Ian McDiarmid]]. Mostly well received by critics, and with a special mention to Elfman's gothic score, the film won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], as well as two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]s for [[BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]]. A box office success, ''Sleepy Hollow'' was also a turning point for Burton. Along with change in his personal life (separation from actress [[Lisa Marie (actress)|Lisa Marie]]), Burton changed radically in style for his next project, leaving the haunted forests and colorful outcasts behind to go on to directing ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' which, as Burton had repeatedly noted, was "not a remake" of the earlier film.

===2000s===
[[File:Pedro Almodóvar and Tim Burton 01 (cropped).jpg|thumb|180px|Burton (right) and [[Pedro Almodóvar]] at the première of ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' in [[Madrid]], in 2007]]
''Planet of the Apes'' was a commercial success, grossing $68&nbsp;million in its opening weekend. The film has received mixed reviews and is widely considered inferior to [[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|the first adaptation]] of [[Planet of the Apes (novel)|the novel]]. In 2003, Burton directed ''[[Big Fish]]'', based on the novel ''[[Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions]]'' by [[Daniel Wallace (author)|Daniel Wallace]]. The film is about a father telling the story of his life to his son using exaggeration and color. Starring [[Ewan McGregor]] as young Edward Bloom and [[Albert Finney]] as an older Edward Bloom, the film also stars [[Jessica Lange]], [[Billy Crudup]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Alison Lohman]] and [[Marion Cotillard]]. ''Big Fish'' received four [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nominations as well as an Academy Award nomination for Elfman's score. The film was also the second collaboration between Burton and [[Helena Bonham Carter]], who played the characters of Jenny and the Witch.

[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' (2005)]] is an adaptation of the [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|book of the same name]] by [[Roald Dahl]]. Starring Johnny Depp as [[Willy Wonka]], [[Freddie Highmore]] as Charlie Bucket, and [[Deep Roy]] as the [[Oompa-Loompas]], the film generally took a more faithful approach to the source material than the 1971 adaptation, ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', although some liberties were taken, such as adding Wonka's issue with his father (played by [[Christopher Lee]]). ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was later nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. The film made over $207&nbsp;million domestically. Filming proved difficult as Burton, Depp, and Danny Elfman had to work on this and Burton's ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (2005) at the same time, which was Burton's first full-length stop motion film as a director, featuring the voices of [[Johnny Depp]] as Victor and [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as Emily in the lead roles.

Burton directed his first music video, "[[Bones (The Killers song)|Bones]]", in 2006. "Bones" is the sixth overall single by American indie rock band [[The Killers]] and the second released from their second studio album, ''[[Sam's Town]]''. Starring in this video were actors [[Michael Steger]] and [[Devon Aoki]].
