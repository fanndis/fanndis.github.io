The '''Kpelle people''' (also known as the ''Guerze, Kpwesi, Kpessi, Sprd, Mpessi, Berlu, Gbelle, Bere, Gizima,'' or ''Buni'')<ref>{{cite journal |first=Richard M. |last=Fulton |title=The Political Structures and Functions of Poro in Kpelle Society |journal=American Anthropologist |series=n.s. |volume=74 |issue=5 |year=1972 |pages=1218–1233 |doi=10.1525/aa.1972.74.5.02a00140 }}</ref> are the largest ethnic group in Liberia. They are located primarily in an area of central [[Liberia]] extending into [[Guinea]]. They speak the [[Kpelle language]],<ref name=Erchak>{{Cite web|url=https://login.mctproxy.mnpals.net/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/start.do?p=GVRL&u=mnaminncom|title=Off Campus Access|website=login.mctproxy.mnpals.net|accessdate=28 April 2020}}</ref> which belongs to the [[Mande languages|Mande language family]].

Despite their yearly heavy rainfalls and rough land, Kpelle survive mostly on their [[Staple food|staple]] crop of rice. Traditionally organized under several paramount chiefs who serve as [[mediation|mediator]]s for the public, preserve order and settle disputes, the Kpelle are arguably the most rural and conservative of the major ethnic groups in [[Demographics of Liberia|Liberia]].<ref name="Kpelle, UCLA, Anthropology">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/kpelle.htm|title=Kpelle|website=www.sscnet.ucla.edu|accessdate=28 April 2020}}</ref>

The Kpelle people are also referred to as Gberese, Gbese, Gbeze, Gerse, Gerze, Kpelli, Kpese, Kpwele, Ngere, and Nguere.<ref>RAMEAU, [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|BnF]] [https://data.bnf.fr/en/11998055/kpelle__peuple_d_afrique_/]</ref>

==History==
The Kpelle or Guerze lived in North Sudan during the sixteenth-century, before fleeing to other parts of Northwest Africa into what is now Mali. Their flight was due to internal conflicts between the tribes from the crumbling Sudanic empire. Some migrated to Liberia, Mauritania, and Chad. They still maintained their traditional and cultural heritage despite their migration. A handful are still of Kpelle origin in North Sudan.

Kpelle are also located in Mali and maintain their heritage. Some Arabs in Mali enslaved the Africans and took women as their concubines, with those descendants being of Kpelle admixture.<ref name="Kpelle, UCLA, Anthropology"/>

The Kpelle also used to trade with the Muslim Vai and Mandingo who live in small numbers in the country and reside nearby. The Kpelle trade with Lebanese merchants, U.S. missionaries and Peace Corps volunteers.<ref name="Kpelle, UCLA, Anthropology"/>

There were [[2013 Guinea clashes|3 days of ethno-religious fighting in Nzerekore]] in July 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-guinea-violence-idUSBRE96G00820130717|title=Guinea's Conde appeals for calm after 11 killed in ethnic clashes|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=28 April 2020|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref><ref name="BBC">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-23335719|title=Guinea troops deployed after clashes|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=28 April 2020|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> Fighting between ethnic Kpelle, who are Christian or animist, and ethnic Konianke, who are Muslims and close to the larger [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] ethnic group, left at least 54 dead.<ref name="BBC"/> The dead included people who were killed with machetes and burned alive.<ref name="BBC"/> The violence ended after the Guinea military imposed a curfew, and [[Alpha Condé|President Conde]] made a televised appeal for calm.<ref name="BBC"/>

==Location==
The Kpelle are the largest ethnic group of the West African nation of Liberia and are also an important ethnic group also in southern [[Guinea]] (where they are also known as ''Guerze'') and north western [[Ivory Coast]]. Most Kpelle inhabit [[Bong County]], [[Bomi County]], [[Gbarpolu County]], and [[Lofa County]].<ref name="Kpelle, UCLA, Anthropology"/> They are major food suppliers of the capital cities.

The terrain in the area includes swamps, hills and, in lowland areas, rivers. May through October brings their rainy season with an annual rainfall from 180 to 300 centimeters. The Kpelle territory sees the lowest temperatures dropping to 19&nbsp;°C with the average temp around 36-degree C.<ref name=Erchak/>

It is supplemented by [[cassava]], vegetables, and fruits; [[cash crop]]s include rice, [[peanut]]s, [[sugarcane]], and [[Nut (food)|nuts]] they also enjoy [[fufu]] and soup, sometimes the soup is spicy but it depends on the way they want it. Soup may be eaten as an appetizer or in conjunction to the main dish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-9046174 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library Edition |publisher=Library.eb.com |accessdate=2012-01-31}}</ref>

==Culture==
Traditionally, the Kpelle have been farmers with [[rice]] as the main crop.<ref>''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1982 edition, p. 907</ref> The word Kpelle is often used as an adjective to refer to someone as hard working and very humble people in Liberia and Guinea.

Traditionally, a Kpelle family consists of a man, his wives and his children. The household has been the usual farming unit, and all the family members participate in daily farming work. Young children learn how to farm and help the older family members with farm activities.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In their social structure, leadership was very crucial. Every Kpelle tribe used to have a chief who oversaw their own interests as well as the interests of the society. These chiefs were recognized by the national government. They used to act as mediators between the government and their own tribes. Each town also had its own chief. The chiefs act as liaisons for different groups in the society. Anthropologists such as Caroline Bledsoe have characterized Kpelle social organization as one premised on [[wealth in people]].
