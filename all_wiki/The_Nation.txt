'''''The Nation''''' is the oldest continuously published weekly magazine in the United States, covering [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]]<ref name= EB>{{cite web |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Nation-American-journal |title= The Nation:American Journal |publisher= Encyclopedia Britannica |author= Tikkanen, Amy (EB staff, general corrections manager)|accessdate= October 8, 2020 |quote= It is generally considered the leading liberal magazine of its kind.}}</ref> political and cultural news, opinion, and analysis. It was founded on July 6, 1865, as a successor to [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'',<ref>''The Anti-Slavery Reporter'', August 1, 1865, p. 187.</ref> an [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] newspaper that closed in 1865, after ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Now that the specific, urgent problem of slavery had been ended (''The Liberator''), one could proceed to a broader topic, ''The Nation''. An important collaborator of the new magazine was its Literary Editor [[Wendell Phillips Garrison]], son of William. He had at his disposal his father's vast network of contacts.

''The Nation'' is published by its namesake owner, The Nation Company, L.P., at 33 Irving Place, New York, New York 10003,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/about-and-contact |title=About and Contact|work=The Nation|access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref> and is associated with [[The Nation Institute]].

''The Nation'' has news bureaus in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[London]], and [[South Africa]], with departments covering [[architecture]], art, corporations, [[Military|defense]], [[Natural environment|environment]], films, [[Law|legal affairs]], music, [[peace]] and [[disarmament]], poetry, and the [[United Nations]]. Circulation peaked at 187,000 in 2006 but by 2010 had dropped to 145,000 in print, although digital subscriptions had risen to over 15,000.<ref name="NYT1">{{cite news|author=Peters, Jeremy W.

==History==

=== Founding and journalistic roots ===
''The Nation'' was established in July 1865 at 130 Nassau Street ("[[Park Row (Manhattan)|Newspaper Row]]") in [[Manhattan]]. Its founding coincided with the closure of the abolitionist newspaper ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', also in 1865, after slavery was abolished by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]; a group of abolitionists, led by the architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], desired to found a new weekly political magazine. [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin]], who had been considering starting such a magazine for some time, agreed and so became the first editor of ''The Nation''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

|page=200}}</ref> [[Wendell Phillips Garrison]], son of ''The Liberator'''s editor/publisher [[William Lloyd Garrison]], was Literary Editor from 1865 to 1906.

Its founding publisher was Joseph H. Richards; the editor was Godkin, an [[Irish American|immigrant from Ireland]] who had formerly worked as a correspondent of the London ''[[The Daily News (UK)|Daily News]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=John Bassett |last=Moore |title=Proceedings at the Semi-Centennial Dinner: The Biltmore, April 19, 1917 |journal=The Nation |volume=104 |issue=2704 |date=April 27, 1917 |at=section 2, pp. 502–503 }}</ref><ref name="ja">{{cite encyclopedia |first=James |last=Aucoin |title=The Nation |editor-first=Stephen L. |editor-last=Vaughn |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of American Journalism |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-415-96950-5 |pages=317–8 }}</ref> Godkin sought to establish what one sympathetic commentator later characterized as "an organ of opinion characterized in its utterance by breadth and deliberation, an organ which should identify itself with causes, and which should give its support to parties primarily as representative of these causes."<ref name=Moore503>Moore, "Proceedings at the Semi-Centennial Dinner," p. 503.</ref>

In its "founding prospectus" the magazine wrote that the publication would have "seven main objects" with the first being "discussion of the topics of the day, and, above all, of legal, economical, and constitutional questions, with greater accuracy and moderation than are now to be found in the daily press."<ref name="FoundingProspectus">{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/founding-prospectus/|title=Founding Prospectus|author=The Nation|date=March 23, 2015|work=The Nation}}</ref> ''The Nation'' pledged to "not be the organ of any party, sect or body" but rather to "make an earnest effort to bring to discussion of political and social questions a really critical spirit, and to wage war upon the vices of violence, exaggeration and misrepresentation by which so much of the political writing of the day is marred."<ref name="FoundingProspectus"/>

In the first year of publication, one of the magazine's regular features was ''The South As It Is'', dispatches from a tour of the war-torn region by John Richard Dennett, a recent [[Harvard University|Harvard]] graduate and a veteran of the [[Port Royal Experiment]]. Dennett interviewed [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veterans, freed slaves, agents of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], and ordinary people he met by the side of the road. The articles, since collected as a book, have been praised by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "examples of masterly journalism."{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Among the causes supported by the publication in its earliest days was civil service reform—moving the basis of government employment from a [[political patronage]] system to a professional [[bureaucracy]] based upon [[meritocracy]].<ref name=Moore503 /> ''The Nation'' also was preoccupied with the reestablishment of a sound national currency in the years after the [[American Civil War]], arguing that a stable [[currency]] was necessary to restore the economic stability of the nation.<ref>Moore, "Proceedings at the Semi-Centennial Dinner," pp. 503–504.</ref> Closely related to this was the publication's advocacy of the elimination of [[protective tariffs]] in favor of lower prices of consumer goods associated with a [[free trade]] system.<ref name=Moore504>Moore, "Proceedings at the Semi-Centennial Dinner," p. 504.</ref>

[[File:(King1893NYC) pg617 THE EVENING POST AND THE NATION, EVENING POST BUILDING.jpg|thumb|left|''The Evening Post'' and ''The Nation'', 210 Broadway, Manhattan, New York]]
The magazine would stay at [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Newspaper Row]] for 90 years.

=== From 1880s literary supplement to 1930s New Deal booster ===
In 1881, newspaperman-turned-railroad-baron [[Henry Villard]] acquired ''The Nation'' and converted it into a weekly literary supplement for his daily newspaper the ''New York Evening Post''. The offices of the magazine were moved to the ''Evening Post''{{'}}s headquarters at 210 Broadway. The ''New York Evening Post'' would later morph into a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], the ''[[New York Post]]'', a left-leaning afternoon tabloid, under owner [[Dorothy Schiff]] from 1939 to 1976. Since then, it has been a [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] tabloid owned by [[Rupert Murdoch]], while ''The Nation'' became known for its far left ideology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cjr.org/the_delacorte_lectures/the_nation_jacobin.php|title='What's bad for the nation is good for The Nation'|website=Columbia Journalism Review|first=Carlett |last=Spike|language=en|date=December 9, 2016|access-date=January 14, 2019}}</ref>

In 1900, Henry Villard's son, [[Oswald Garrison Villard]], inherited the magazine and the ''Evening Post'', and sold off the latter in 1918. Thereafter, he remade ''The Nation'' into a [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] publication and gave it an anti-[[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] orientation. Oswald Villard welcomed the [[New Deal]] and supported the [[nationalization]] of industries&nbsp;– thus reversing the meaning of "[[liberalism]]" as the founders of ''The Nation'' would have understood the term, from a belief in a smaller and more restricted government to a belief in a larger and less restricted government.<ref>Carey McWilliams, "One Hundred Years of The Nation." ''Journalism Quarterly'' 42.2 (1965): 189–197.</ref><ref>Dollena Joy Humes, ''Oswald Garrison Villard: Liberal of the 1920s'' (Syracuse University Press, 1960).</ref> Villard sold the magazine in 1935. [[Maurice Wertheim]], the new owner, sold it in 1937 to [[Freda Kirchwey]], who served as editor from 1933 to 1955.

Almost every editor of ''The Nation'' from Villard's time to the 1970s was looked at for "subversive" activities and ties.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kimball |first=Penn |title=The History of ''The Nation'' According to the FBI |journal=The Nation |date=March 22, 1986 |pages=399–426 |issn=0027-8378}}</ref> When [[Albert Jay Nock]], not long afterward, published a column criticizing [[Samuel Gompers]] and trade unions for being complicit in the war machine of the [[World War I|First World War]], ''The Nation'' was briefly suspended from the US mail.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wreszin, Michael |year=1969 |title=Albert Jay Nock and the Anarchist Elitist Tradition in America |journal=[[American Quarterly]] |volume=21 |issue=2 |doi=10.2307/2711573|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|jstor=2711573 |page=173 |quote=It was probably the only time any publication was suppressed in America for attacking a labor leader, but the suspension seemed to document Nock's charges.}}</ref>

During the 1930s, ''The Nation'' showed enthusiastic support for [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[New Deal]].<ref name="ja" />

=== World War II and early Cold War ===
The magazine's financial problems in the early 1940s prompted Kirchwey to sell her individual ownership of the magazine in 1943, creating a [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] organization, Nation Associates, out of the money generated from a recruiting drive of sponsors. This organization was also responsible for academic affairs, including conducting research and organizing conferences, that had been a part of the early history of the magazine. Nation Associates became responsible for the operation and publication of the magazine on a nonprofit basis, with Kirchwey as both president of Nation Associates and editor of ''The Nation''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Freda Kirchwey: A Woman of the Nation|first=Sara|last=Alpern|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|date=1987|isbn=0-674-31828-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/fredakirchweywom0000alpe/page/156 156–161]|url=https://archive.org/details/fredakirchweywom0000alpe/page/156}}</ref>

Before the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], ''The Nation'' repeatedly called on the United States to enter World War II to resist [[fascism]], and after the US entered the war, the publication supported the American war effort.<ref name="pfb">{{cite book |first=Paul F. |last=Boller |chapter=Hiroshima and the American Left |title=Memoirs of An Obscure Professor and Other Essays |location=Fort Worth |publisher=Texas Christian University Press |year=c. 1992 |isbn=0-87565-097-X}}</ref> It also supported the use of the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]].<ref name="pfb" />

During the late 1940s and again in the early 1950s, a merger was discussed by Kirchwey (later [[Carey McWilliams (journalist)|Carey McWilliams]]) and ''[[The New Republic]]''{{'}}s [[Michael Straight]]. The two magazines were very similar at that time — both were left of center, ''The Nation'' further left than ''TNR''; both had circulations around 100,000, although ''TNR''{{'}}s was slightly higher; and both lost money. It was thought that the two magazines could unite and make the most powerful journal of opinion. The new publication would have been called ''The Nation and New Republic''. Kirchwey was the most hesitant, and both attempts to merge failed. The two magazines would later take very different paths: ''The Nation'' achieved a higher circulation, and ''The New Republic'' moved more to the [[Neoconservatism|right]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Navasky |first=Victor S. |title=The Merger that Wasn't |journal=The Nation |date=January 1, 1990 |issn=0027-8378}}</ref>

In the 1950s, ''The Nation'' was attacked as "pro-communist" because of its advocacy of detente with the [[Soviet Union]],<ref name="fk">{{cite book |first=Sara |last=Alpern |title=Freda Kirchwey, a Woman of the Nation |location=Boston |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1987 |isbn=0-674-31828-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fredakirchweywom0000alpe/page/162 162–5] |url=https://archive.org/details/fredakirchweywom0000alpe/page/162 }}</ref> and its criticism of [[McCarthyism]].<ref name="ja" /> One of the magazine's writers, [[Louis Fischer]], resigned from the magazine afterwards, claiming ''The Nation''{{'}}s foreign coverage was too pro-Soviet.<ref name="fk" /> Despite this, [[Diana Trilling]] pointed out that Kirchwey did allow anti-Soviet writers, such as herself, to contribute material critical of Russia to the magazine's arts section.<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Seaton |title=Cultural Conservatism, Political Liberalism: From Criticism to Cultural Studies |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-472-10645-7 |page=71 }}</ref>

During [[McCarthyism]] (the Second Red Scare), ''The Nation'' was banned from several school libraries in New York City and Newark,<ref name=dc>{{cite book |first=David |last=Caute |authorlink=David Caute |title=The Great Fear: the Anti-Communist purge under Truman and Eisenhower |location=London |publisher=Secker and Warburg |year=1978 |isbn=0-436-09511-4 |page=454}}</ref> and a [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]] librarian, [[Ruth Brown (librarian)|Ruth Brown]], was fired from her job in 1950, after a citizens committee complained she had given shelf space to ''The Nation''.<ref name=dc />

In 1955, George C. Kirstein replaced Kirchway as magazine owner.<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| title = KIRCHWEY REGIME QUITS THE NATION; Weekly's Editor - Publisher Turns It Over to Carey McWilliams, G. C.

During the 1950s, [[Paul Blanshard]], a former Associate Editor, served as ''The Nation''{{'}}s special correspondent in [[Uzbekistan]]. His most famous writing was a series of articles attacking the [[Catholic Church]] in America as a dangerous, powerful, and undemocratic institution.

=== 1970s to 2020 ===
In June 1979, ''The Nation''{{'}}s publisher [[Hamilton Fish V|Hamilton Fish]] and then-editor [[Victor Navasky]] moved the weekly to 72 [[Fifth Avenue]], in [[Manhattan]]. In June 1998, the periodical had to move to make way for [[condominium]] development. The offices of ''The Nation'' are now at 33 Irving Place, in Manhattan's [[Gramercy, Manhattan|Gramercy]] neighborhood.

In 1977, a group organized by [[Hamilton Fish V]] bought the magazine from the Storrow family.<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Carmody| first = Deirdre| title = Nation Magazine Sold to Group Led by Hamilton Fish| work = The New York Times| accessdate = December 2, 2018| date = December 23, 1977| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/23/archives/nation-magazine-sold-to-group-led-by-hamilton-fish.html}}</ref> In 1985, he sold it to [[Arthur L. Carter]], who had made a fortune as a founding partner of [[Carter, Berlind, Potoma & Weill]].

In 1991, ''The Nation'' sued the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] for restricting free speech by limiting [[Gulf War]] coverage to [[press pool]]s. However, the issue was found [[Mootness|moot]] in ''[[Nation Magazine v. United States Department of Defense]]'', because the war ended before the case was heard.

In 1995, Victor Navasky bought the magazine and, in 1996, became publisher. In 1995, [[Katrina vanden Heuvel]] succeeded Navasky as editor of ''The Nation'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/404223/The-Nation |title=The Nation|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> and in 2005, as publisher.

In 2015, ''The Nation'' celebrated its 150th anniversary with a documentary film by Academy Award-winning director [[Barbara Kopple]]; a 268-page special issue<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/150th-anniversary-issue/ |title=150th Anniversary Special Issue|work=The Nation}}</ref> featuring pieces of art and writing from the archives, and new essays by frequent contributors like [[Eric Foner]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[E. L. Doctorow]], [[Toni Morrison]], [[Rebecca Solnit]], and [[Vivian Gornick]]; a book-length history of the magazine by [[D. D. Guttenplan]] (which ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' called "an affectionate and celebratory affair"); events across the country; and a relaunched website. In a tribute to ''The Nation'', published in the anniversary issue, President [[Barack Obama]] said:

<blockquote class="templatequote">
In an era of instant, 140-character news cycles and reflexive toeing of the party line, it's incredible to think of the 150-year history of ''The Nation''. It's more than a magazine&nbsp;— it's a crucible of ideas forged in the time of Emancipation, tempered through depression and war and the civil-rights movement, and honed as sharp and relevant as ever in an age of breathtaking technological and economic change. Through it all, ''The Nation'' has exhibited that great American tradition of expanding our moral imaginations, stoking vigorous dissent, and simply taking the time to think through our country's challenges anew. If I agreed with everything written in any given issue of the magazine, it would only mean that you are not doing your jobs. But whether it is your commitment to a fair shot for working Americans, or equality for all Americans, it is heartening to know that an American institution dedicated to provocative, reasoned debate and reflection in pursuit of those ideals can continue to thrive.
</blockquote>

On January 14, 2016, ''The Nation'' endorsed [[Vermont]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Bernie Sanders]] for [[President of the United States|President]]. In their reasoning, the editors of ''The Nation'' professed that "Bernie Sanders and his supporters are bending the arc of history toward justice.

==Finances==
Print ad pages declined by 5% from 2009 to 2010, while digital advertising rose 32.8% from 2009 to 2010.<ref>{{cite web |author=Steve Cohn |url=http://www.minonline.com/news/min-Correction-The-Nation-Only-Down-Slightly-in-Print-Ad-Sales-Up-in-Web_15730.html |title=min Correction: The Nation Only Down Slightly in Print Ad Sales, Up in Web |publisher=MinOnline |accessdate=December 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306103553/http://www.minonline.com/news/min-Correction-The-Nation-Only-Down-Slightly-in-Print-Ad-Sales-Up-in-Web_15730.html |archive-date=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Advertising accounts for 10% of total revenue for the magazine, while circulation totals 60%.<ref name="NYT1" /> ''The Nation'' has lost money in all but three or four years of operation and is sustained in part by a group of more than 30,000 donors called Nation Associates, who donate funds to the periodical above and beyond their annual subscription fees. This program accounts for 30% of the total revenue for the magazine. An annual cruise also generates $200,000 for the magazine.<ref name="NYT1" /> Since late 2012, the Nation Associates program has been called Nation Builders.<ref>{{cite news |author=Katrina vanden Heuvel |newspaper=The Nation |date=December 28, 2012 |title= Introducing The Nation Builders |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/171928/introducing-nation-builders# }}</ref>

==Poetry==
Since its creation, ''The Nation'' has published significant works of [[American poetry]],<ref name="Schuessler">Jennifer Schuessler, [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/arts/poem-nation-apology.html A Poem in The Nation Spurs a Backlash and an Apology], ''New York Times'' (August 1, 2018).</ref><ref name="Schulman">Grace Schulman, [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/opinion/nation-poem-anders-carlson-wee.html The Nation Magazine Betrays a Poet — and Itself], ''New York Times'' (August 6, 2018).</ref> including works by [[Hart Crane]], [[Eli Siegel]], [[Elizabeth Bishop]], and [[Adrienne Rich]],<ref name="Schuessler"/> as well as [[W.S. Merwin]], [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Denise Levertov]], and [[Derek Walcott]].<ref name="Schulman"/>

In 2018, the magazine published a poem entitled "How-To" by Anders Carlson-Wee which was written in the voice of a homeless man and used [[African-American Vernacular English|black vernacular]]. This led to criticism from writers such as [[Roxane Gay]] because Carlson-Wee is white. ''The Nation''{{'}}s two poetry editors, [[Stephanie Burt]] and [[Carmen Giménez Smith]], issued an apology for publishing the poem, the first such action ever taken by the magazine.<ref name="Schuessler"/> The apology itself became an object of criticism also. Poet and ''Nation'' columnist [[Katha Pollitt]] who called the apology "craven" and likened it to a letter written from "a reeducation camp".<ref name="Schuessler"/> [[Grace Schulman]], ''The Nation''{{'}}s poetry editor from 1971 to 2006, wrote that the apology represented a disturbing departure from the magazine's traditionally broad conception of [[artistic freedom]].<ref name="Schulman"/>

==Editors==
[[D. D. Guttenplan]] replaced Publisher [[Katrina vanden Heuvel]] as Editor on June 15, 2019.<ref name="june2019" /> Former editors include [[Victor Saul Navasky]], [[Carey McWilliams (journalist)|Carey McWilliams]], and [[Freda Kirchwey]].
