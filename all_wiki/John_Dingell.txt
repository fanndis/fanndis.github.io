== Early life, education, and early career ==
Dingell was born on July 8, 1926, in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], the son of Grace (née Bigler) and [[John Dingell Sr.]] (1894–1955). His father was the son of [[Polish Americans|Polish]] immigrants, and his mother had [[Swiss Americans|Swiss]] and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] ancestry.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dingell, John D.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1076485042|title=The dean : the best seat in the House|others=Bender, David, 1955-, Paffhausen, Frederick D.|date=December 4, 2018|isbn=978-0-06-257199-1|edition=First|location=[New York, NY]|oclc=1076485042}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/dingell.htm |title=John Dingell |publisher=Rootsweb |access-date=April 22, 2013}}</ref> The Dingells were in Colorado in [[Tuberculosis treatment in Colorado Springs|search of a cure]] for Dingell Sr.'s [[tuberculosis]].

The family moved back to Michigan, and in 1932, Dingell Sr. was elected the first representative of Michigan's newly created 15th District. In [[Washington, D.C.]], John Jr. attended [[Georgetown Preparatory School]] and then the [[United States House of Representatives Page|House Page School]] when he served as a page for the U.S. House of Representatives from 1938 to 1943. He was on the floor of the House when President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] gave his famous speech after the bombing of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. In 1944, at the age of 18, Dingell joined the [[United States Army]]. He rose to the rank of second lieutenant and received orders to take part in the first wave of [[Operation Downfall|a planned invasion of Japan]] in November 1945; the Congressman said that President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s decision to [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use the atomic bomb to end the war]] saved his life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/dingell/bio.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201160204/http://www.house.gov/dingell/bio.htm |title=Biography |publisher=Office of John D.

=== Tenure ===
[[File:John D Dingel&Jfk.jpg|thumb|right|upright|200px|Rep. Dingell with President [[John F. Kennedy]]]]
Dingell was generally classified as a moderately liberal member of the Democratic Party<ref name="ontheissues.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/MI/John_Dingell.htm |title=John Dingell overview |publisher=Ontheissues.org |access-date=November 25, 2014}}</ref> and throughout his career he was a leading Congressional supporter of [[organized labor]], [[social welfare]] measures and traditional [[Progressivism|progressive]] policies. At the beginning of every Congress, Dingell introduced a bill providing for a [[national health insurance]] system, the same bill that his father proposed while he was in Congress. Dingell also strongly supported [[Bill Clinton]]'s managed-care proposal early in his administration.<ref name="ontheissues.org" /> In October 1998, President Clinton began a [[Roosevelt Room]] appearance "by thanking Senator [[Jay Rockefeller]] of West Virginia and Congressman Dingell for their steadfast support of Medicare and their participation in our Medicare Commission."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PPP-1998-book2/html/PPP-1998-book2-doc-pg1765.htm |title=Remarks on the Decision of Certain Health Maintenance Organizations To Opt Out of Some Medicare Markets |date=October 8, 1998 |first=Bill |last=Clinton |author-link=Bill Clinton |publisher=Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States}}</ref>

On some issues, though, he reflected the values of his largely Catholic and working-class district.

An avid sportsman and [[hunter]], he strongly opposed [[gun control]], and was a former board member of the [[National Rifle Association]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/MI/John_Dingell_Gun_Control.htm |title=John Dingell on Gun Control |publisher=Ontheissues.org |access-date=November 25, 2014}}</ref> For many years, Dingell received an A+ rating from the NRA.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Dingell helped make firearms exempt from the 1972 Consumer Product Safety Act so that the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] had no authority to recall defective guns. Dingell's wife, Representative Debbie Dingell, introduced legislation in 2018 to remove this exemption from the law.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/18/defective-firearm-dingell-vs-dingell/33957941/ |title=Defective firearm bill pits Dingell v.

[[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]] wrote of Dingell in 2002:

{{quote|There is something grand about the range of Dingell's experience and about his adherence to his philosophy over a very long career. He is an old-fashioned [[social Democrat]] who knows that most voters don't agree with his goals of a single-payer national health insurance plan but presses forward toward that goal as far as he can. "It's hard to believe that there was once no [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] or [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]," he says. "The Dingell family helped change that. My father worked on Social Security and for national health insurance, and I sat in the chair and presided over the House as Medicare passed (in 1965). I went with Lyndon Johnson for the signing of Medicare at the [[Harry S. Truman]] Library, and I have successfully fought efforts to privatize Social Security and Medicare." Whether you agree or disagree, the social Democratic tradition is one of the great traditions in our history, and John Dingell has fought for it for a very long time.<ref name=Barone_2002 />|sign=|source=}}

On December 15, 2005, on the floor of the House, Dingell read a poem sharply critical of, among other things, [[Fox News]], [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], and the so-called "[[Christmas controversy|War on Christmas]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2005_record&page=H11598&position=all |title=Retrieve Pages |publisher=Frwebgate.access.gpo.gov |access-date=August 23, 2010}}</ref> Along with [[John Conyers]], in April 2006, Dingell brought an action against [[George W.

==== Energy and Commerce chairman ====

Dingell was well known for his approach to Congressional oversight of the executive branch.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122765863527058333 |title=Dingell's Grand Inquisitor Politics |last=Miller |first=Henry I. |date=November 25, 2008 |work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=February 8, 2019}}</ref> He subpoenaed numerous government officials to testify before the committee and grilled them for hours. He insisted that all who testified before his committee do so under oath, thus exposing them to [[perjury]] charges if they did not tell the truth. He and his committee uncovered numerous instances of corruption and waste, such as the use of $600 toilet seats at [[the Pentagon]]. He also claimed that the committee's work led to resignations of many [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] officials, and uncovered information that led to legal proceedings that sent many [[Food and Drug Administration]] officials to jail.<ref name="Newsweek">{{cite web |url=https://www.newsweek.com/what-dems-would-do-112027 |title=What the Dems Would Do |last=Bailey |first=Holly |date=October 29, 2006 |website=Newsweek |access-date=February 8, 2019}}</ref>

After serving as the committee's ranking Democratic member for 12 years, Dingell regained the chairmanship in 2007. According to ''[[Newsweek]]'', he had wanted to investigate the [[George W. Bush]] Administration's handling of port security, the Medicare prescription drug program and [[Dick Cheney]]'s energy task force.<ref name="Newsweek" /> [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine has stated that he had intended to oversee legislation that addresses [[Global warming|global warming and climate change]] caused by carbon emissions from automobiles, energy companies and industry.<ref name=VonDrehle>{{cite journal |first=David |last=Von Drehle |date=June 11, 2007 |title=An Auto Insider Takes on Climate Change |journal=Time |volume=169 |issue=24 |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1627016,00.html |access-date=November 24, 2014 |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

Dingell lost the chairmanship for the [[111th Congress]] to Congressman [[Henry Waxman]] of California in a [[Democratic Caucus of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic caucus]] meeting on November 20, 2008. Waxman mounted a challenge against Dingell on grounds that Dingell was stalling certain environmental legislation, which would have tightened [[vehicle emissions standards]]—something that could be detrimental to the [[Big Three automobile manufacturers]] that constitute a major source of employment in Dingell's district. Dingell was given the title of Chairman Emeritus in a token of appreciation of his years of service on the committee, and a portrait of him is in the House collection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.house.gov/Collection/Detail/29097?ret=True |title=John David Dingell, Jr. |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |work=History, Arts & Archives |access-date=November 24, 2014}}</ref>

==== Baltimore case ====
In the 1980s, Dingell led a series of Congressional hearings to pursue alleged scientific fraud by [[Thereza Imanishi-Kari]] and Nobel Prize-winner [[David Baltimore]]. The [[National Institutes of Health]]'s fraud unit, then called the [[Office of Scientific Integrity]], charged Imanishi-Kari in 1991 of falsifying data and recommended that she be barred from receiving research grants for 10 years. She appealed the decision and the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] appeals panel dismissed the charges against Imanishi-Kari and cleared her to receive grants.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/static/dab/decisions/board-decisions/1996/dab1582.html |title=Thereza Imanishi-Kari, Ph.D., DAB No. 1582 (1996) |publisher=Hhs.gov |access-date=February 8, 2019}}</ref> The findings and negative publicity surrounding them made David Baltimore decide to resign as president of [[Rockefeller University]] (after Imanishi-Kari was cleared he became president of the [[California Institute of Technology]]).

==== Robert Gallo claims ====
From 1991 to 1995 Dingell's staff investigated claims that [[Robert Gallo]] had used samples supplied to him by [[Luc Montagnier]] to fraudulently claim to have discovered the [[AIDS virus]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-11-06-9104090749-story.html |title=Criminal Inquiry Urged in AIDS Lab Scandal |last=Crewdson |first=John |date=November 6, 1991 |website=Chicago Tribune |language=en-US|access-date=February 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/06/us/possible-misconduct-is-seen-in-discovery-of-aids-virus.html |title=Possible Misconduct Is Seen In Discovery of AIDS Virus |last=Hilts |first=Philip J. |date=October 6, 1990 |work=The New York Times|access-date=February 9, 2019 |language=en-US}}</ref> The report concluded that Gallo had engaged in fraud and that the NIH covered up his misappropriation of work by the French team at the [[Institut Pasteur]].

Bush|Bush]] Administration "requiring EPA staff to get permission from headquarters before protecting 'isolated' water bodies like [[vernal pool]]s, [[prairie pothole]]s, [[playa lake]]s and [[bog]]s," which provide "critical wildlife habitat, store flood water, and protect drinking water supplies."<ref name="conserve" /> Dingell was also a member of the [[Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fws.gov/news/ShowNews.cfm?ref=congressman-john-dingell-honored-for-outstanding-waterfowl-conservation-leg&_ID=6278 |title=News Releases – U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |publisher=Fws.gov |date=June 9, 2009 |access-date=February 8, 2019}}</ref>

In June 1999, Dingell released a report in which the [[General Accounting Office]] cited concurrent design and construction was the reason for production of high levels of explosive [[benzene]] gas. In a statement, Dingell asserted that "mismanagement by the [[United States Department of Energy]] and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] led to an extraordinary, and pathetic, waste of taxpayer money. All we have to show for $500 million is a 20-year delay and the opportunity to risk another $1 billion to make a problematic process work."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/02/us/step-in-storage-of-atom-waste-is-costly-error.html |title=Step in Storage Of Atom Waste Is Costly Error |first=Matthew L. |last=Wald |work=New York Times |date=June 2, 1999}}</ref>

In July 2007, Dingell indicated he planned to introduce a new tax on carbon usage in order to curtail greenhouse gas emissions. The policy has been criticized by some, as polling numbers show voters may be unwilling to pay for the changes. A ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' editorial claimed that vehicle emissions standards that he supported will not yield any substantial greenhouse gas emissions savings.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118403408397861751?mod=opinion_main_review_and_outlooks |work=The Wall Street Journal |title=Truth in Global Warming |date=July 10, 2007}}</ref>

On December 18, 2019, a day after Dingell's wife [[Debbie Dingell|Rep. Debbie Dingell]], who succeeded him in [[Michigan's 12th congressional district|seat]] in the [[Us house of representatives|House of Representatives]], voted to [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|impeach President Trump]], Trump attacked John Dingell at a rally. Recounting a phone call with Dingell's widow in which she thanked the President for his support of a military flyover of her husband's funeral, Trump claimed Rep. Debbie Dingell told him  "'John would be so thrilled. He’s looking down. He would be so thriled. Thank you so much sir'" Trump continued to the rally attendees "I said that's okay don't worry about it. Maybe he's looking up, I don't know. I don't know, maybe. Maybe. But let's assume he's looking down.",<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNgz26HKZhc</ref> the implication being that the president believed John Dingell was in [[Hell]]. This drew a strong criticism from several Democratic and some Republican politicians, several of whom offered of praised Dingell's legacy. Politicians from both sides offered support to his widow and some Republican lawmakers apologized for the president's comments.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kane |first1=Paul |last2=Flynn |first2=Meagan |last3=Horton |first3=Alex |last4=Dawsey |first4=Josh |title=Rep.
