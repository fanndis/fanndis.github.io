She is also known for having chaired the [[Brundtland Commission]] which presented the [[Our Common Future|Brundtland Report]] on [[sustainable development]].

Educated as a physician, Brundtland joined the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] and entered the government in 1974 as [[Minister of Climate and the Environment|Minister of the Environment]]. She became the first female Prime Minister of Norway on 4 February 1981, but left office on 14 October 1981; she returned as Prime Minister on 9 May 1986 and served until 16 October 1989. She finally returned for her third term on 3 November 1990. From 1981 to 1992 she was leader of the Labour Party. After her surprise resignation as Prime Minister in 1996, she became an international leader in [[sustainable development]] and [[public health]], and served as Director-General of the World Health Organization and as UN [[Special Envoy on Climate Change]] from 2007 to 2010.<ref name=UN07b>{{Cite web

Brundtland belonged to the moderate wing of her party and supported Norwegian membership in the [[European Union]] during the [[1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum|1994 referendum]]. As Prime Minister Brundtland became widely known as the "mother of the nation."<ref>[http://www.theelders.org/gro-harlem-brundtland Gro Harlem Brundtland]</ref> Brundtland received the 1994 [[Charlemagne Prize]], and has received many other awards and recognitions.

==Early life==
Brundtland was born in [[Oslo]] in 1939, the daughter of physician and politician [[Gudmund Harlem]] and Inga Margareta Elisabet Brynolf (1918-2005). She has a younger brother, Lars and a younger sister, [[Hanne Harlem|Hanne]]. 

In 1963, Brundtland graduated with a medical degree, a [[cand.med.]] from the [[University of Oslo]]. She took her master's degree at [[Harvard University]] in 1965, as a [[Master of Public Health]].

From 1966 to 1969, she worked as a physician at the [[Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs|Directorate of Health]] (''Helsedirektoratet''), and from 1969 she worked as a doctor in Oslo's public school health service.

==Political career==
She was [[Minister of the Environment (Norway)|Norwegian Minister for Environmental Affairs]] from 1974 to 1979.

===Prime Minister of Norway===
Brundtland became Norway's first female [[List of Norwegian Prime Ministers|Prime Minister]] in 1981.<ref name="Worth1981">{{cite news |editor-last=Worth |editor-first=William E. |title=Norway picks prime minister |date=4 February 1981 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/395603737/ |newspaper=The Journal Herald |location=Dayton, Ohio |volume=174 |issue=40 |page=8 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> She served as Prime Minister from February to October.<ref>{{cite news |editor-last=Kelly |editor-first=Thomas A. |title=Socialist Government Resigns in Norway |date=14 October 1981 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/130020978/  |newspaper=The Post |publisher=Daniel J. Mahoney |location=West Palm Beach, Florida |volume=73 |issue=175 |page=A13 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>

Brundtland became Norwegian Prime Minister for two further, and more durable, terms. The second ministry was from 9 May 1986 until 16 October 1989 and this cabinet became known worldwide for its high proportion of female ministers: nearly half, or eight of the total eighteen ministers, were female. The third ministry was from 3 November 1990 to 25 October 1996.

Brundtland became leader of the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] in 1981 and held the office until resigning in 1992, during her third term as Prime Minister. In 1996, she resigned as Prime Minister and retired completely from Norwegian politics. Her successor as both Labour Party leader in 1992 and as Prime Minister in 1996 was [[Thorbjørn Jagland]].

==International career==
In 1983, Brundtland was invited by then [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] to establish and chair the [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] (WCED), widely referred to as the [[Brundtland Commission]]. She developed the broad political concept of [[sustainable development]] in the course of extensive public hearings, that were distinguished by their inclusiveness. The commission, which published its report, ''[[Our Common Future]]'', in April 1987, provided the momentum for the 1992 [[Earth Summit]]/[[UNCED]], which was headed by [[Maurice Strong]], who had been a prominent member of the commission. The Brundtland Commission also provided momentum for [[Agenda 21]].

During her third ministry, the Norwegian government in 1993 took the initiative to sponsor secret peace talks between the Government of Israel led by [[Yitzchak Rabin]] – like Brundtland, leader of a Labour Party – and the PLO led by [[Yasser Arafat]]. This culminated with the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]]. For several years afterwards Norway continued to have a high-profile involvement in promoting Israeli-Palestinian peace, though increasingly displaced by the United States from its role as the mediator.

After the end of her term as PM, Brundtland was then elected Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]] in May 1998. In this capacity, Brundtland adopted a far-reaching approach to public health, establishing a [[Commission on Macroeconomics and Health]], chaired by [[Jeffrey Sachs]], and addressing [[violence]] as a major public health issue. Brundtland spearheaded the movement, now worldwide, to achieve the abolition of [[Tobacco smoking|cigarette smoking]] by education, persuasion, and increased taxation.<ref>{{cite news | author=Claire Doole |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/background_briefings/smoking/198338.stm |title=WHO declares war on tobacco firms |work=[[BBC]] news |date=21 October 1998 |access-date=22 February 2013}}</ref> Under her leadership, the World Health Organization was one of the first major employers to make quitting smoking a condition of employment.
Under Brundtland's leadership, the World Health Organization was criticized <ref>{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Duff|title=New blood-pressure guidelines pay off — for drug companies|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-pay-off-8212-for-drug-companies/|access-date=21 February 2017|work=Seattle Times|issue=26 June 2005|date=26 June 2005|ref=SeattleTimes}}</ref> for increased drug-company influence on the agency.

Brundtland was recognized in 2003 by ''[[Scientific American]]'' as their 'Policy Leader of the Year' for coordinating a rapid worldwide response to stem outbreaks of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]]. Brundtland was succeeded on 21 July 2003 by [[Jong-Wook Lee]]. In 1994, Brundtland was awarded the [[Karlspreis|Charlemagne Prize]] of the city of [[Aachen]].

In 2006 Brundtland was a member of the Panel of Eminent Persons who reviewed the work of the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD). In May 2007, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] named Brundtland, as well as [[Ricardo Lagos]] (the former [[president of Chile]]), and [[Han Seung-soo]] (the former foreign minister of [[South Korea]]), to serve as UN Special Envoys for Climate Change.<ref>{{cite news |author=Edith M.

Brundtland's hallmark political activities have been chronicled by her husband, {{interlanguage link|Arne Olav Brundtland|no}}, in his two bestsellers, ''Married to Gro'' ({{ISBN|82-516-1647-6}}) and ''Still married to Gro'' ({{ISBN|82-05-30726-1}}).

==Assassination attempt==
Brundtland narrowly escaped [[assassination]] by [[Anders Behring Breivik]] on [[2011 Norway attacks|22 July 2011]]. She had been on the island of [[Utøya]] hours before the [[2011 Norway attacks#Ut.C3.B8ya massacre|massacre there]] to give a speech to the [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|AUF]] camp; Breivik stated that he originally intended Brundtland to be the main target of the attack (along with [[Eskil Pedersen]] and [[Jonas Gahr Støre]]), but he had been delayed while travelling from Oslo.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/norway/8658995/Norway-shooting-killer-confirms-Gro-Harlem-Brundtland-was-main-target.html |title=Norway shooting: killer 'confirms Gro Harlem Brundtland was main target' |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=25 July 2011 |access-date=23 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/11/18/nyheter/terrorangrep_i_oslo/terrorangrepet/innenriks/terrorangrepene/19066616/ |author=Line Brustad |title=Breiviks hovedmål: Gro, Jonas og Eskil |newspaper=[[Dagbladet]] |date=18 November 2011 |access-date=23 February 2013 |language=no}}</ref> Breivik arrived on Utøya about two hours after Brundtland had left.

During [[Trial of Anders Behring Breivik|his trial]] in 2012, Breivik revealed detailed assassination plans for Brundtland.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/anders-behring-breivik-trial-live |author1=Haroon Siddique |author2=Helen Pidd |title=News blog: Anders Behring Breivik trial, day four - Thursday 19 April |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 April 2012 |access-date=23 February 2013}}</ref> He told the court that he had planned to handcuff her and then record himself reading out a prepared text detailing her "crimes", before decapitating her on camera using a [[bayonet]] and uploading the footage to the internet. Breivik said that while Brundtland had been his main target, he had still planned to massacre everyone else on the island.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17809617 |title=Breivik trial: Phone delay 'caused more deaths' |work=BBC news |date=23 April 2012 |access-date=23 February 2013}}</ref>

===Health issues===
Brundtland was operated on for [[uterine cancer]] in 2002 at [[Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Alf Bjarne Johnsen |url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=508236 |title=Betalte operasjon i 2002 |newspaper=Verdens Gang |date=10 January 2008 |language=no}}</ref> In 2008 it became known that during 2007 she had received two treatments at Ullevål, paid for by Norwegian public expenditures. Since she had previously notified the Norwegian authorities that she had changed residence to France, she was no longer entitled to Norwegian [[social security]] benefits. Following media attention surrounding the matter, Brundtland decided to change residence once more, back to Norway, and she also announced that she would be paying for the treatments herself.<ref>{{cite news |author=Alf Bjarne Johnsen |url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=509666 |title=Gro flytter hjem |newspaper=Verdens Gang |date=7 January 2008 |access-date=23 February 2013 |language=no}}</ref> Brundtland has claimed to suffer from [[electrical sensitivity]] which causes headaches when someone uses a mobile phone near her.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Aud Dalsegg |title= Får hodesmerter av mobilstråling |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2002/03/09/318013.html |newspaper=Dagbladet |date= 9 March 2002 |language= no |access-date=23 February 2013}}</ref>
