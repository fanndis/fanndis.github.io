==History==
[[File:River Island at Castlepoint.jpg|thumb|Store front at [[Castlepoint Shopping Centre]].]]
In 1948, Bernard Lewis started selling [[Grocery store|fruit and vegetables]], and then [[knitting]] [[wool]] from a bombed-out site in the [[East End of London]].<ref name=Telg8392014/> Joined by his three brothers,<ref name=Telg8392014/> the chain expanded to nine stores under the title Lewis Separates.<ref name=TelgHist>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8392059/From-Chelsea-Girl-to-Concept-Man-history-of-River-Island.html|title=From Chelsea Girl to Concept Man: history of River Island|author=James Hall|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=20 March 2011|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref>

By 1965 Lewis Separates had a 70 store empire in the UK and it was decided that the brand needed a new identity. Lewis Separates was re-branded to Chelsea Girl,<ref name=TelgHist/> the name chosen because at the time the [[King's Road]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] was the hub of fashion, music and popular culture.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Harriet|title=Chelsea Girl: Let's Twist Again|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/chelsea-girl-lets-twist-again-2247594.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=1 August 2017}}</ref> Chelsea Girl became the first UK fashion boutique chain.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In the late 1970s, two of the brothers left the business,<ref name=TelgHist/> leaving Bernard, David and their families in charge. They formed the Lewis Trust Group, for which David ran the other businesses covering [[hotels]], property and investments, leaving Bernard to run the retail operation. This allowed the company to expand into menswear in 1982 with the launch of Concept Man stores,<ref name=TelgHist/> before they were merged with Chelsea Girl to become one retail brand under the name of River Island in 1988.<ref name=TelgHist/>

In 1993, the brand opened its first shop in [[Republic of Ireland]]. Since then it has expanded into a dozen markets including [[Russia]], [[Poland]], and various countries in the [[Middle East]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In 2010, River Island launched Kidswear. In 2011, Chelsea Girl was re-introduced as a capsule collection within River Island stores.<ref name=Telg8392014>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8392014/Ben-Lewis-interview-River-Island-chief-on-reviving-80s-style-Chelsea-Girl.html|title=Ben Lewis interview: River Island chief on reviving 80s-style Chelsea Girl|author=James Hall|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=20 March 2011|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref> In 2018 River Island launched RI Baby expanding its Kidswear offering. In September 2019 Will Kernan was appointed chief executive replacing previous CEO of 10 years Ben Lewis as the first non-family member in this role.<ref name=DrapOnline7036403>{{cite web|url=https://www.drapersonline.com/news/latest-news/new-river-island-chief-brings-intelligent-challenge/7036403.article|title=Will Kernan Appointed CEO|author=Grace Whelan|publisher=[[Drapers (magazine)|Drapers]]|date=20 June 2019|accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref>

==Stores==
There are over 350 River Island stores across the UK, Ireland and internationally (over 250 of which are in the UK and Ireland), as well as six dedicated online sites.

As of 2012, River Island no longer has physical shops in Singapore. In 2013, online fashion retailer Zalora began acting as a bridge between River Island and most of South-East Asia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zalora and River Island|url=http://mitsueki.wordpress.com/tag/river-island-shut-down-its-last-store-at-ion-orchard/|work=River Island|publisher=River Island|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref>
