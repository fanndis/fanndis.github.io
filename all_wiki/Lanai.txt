==History==
Lanai was under the control of nearby [[Maui]] before recorded history. Its first inhabitants may have arrived as late as the 15th century.

The Hawaiian-language name {{lang|haw|Lāna{{okina}}i}} is of uncertain origin, but the island has historically been called {{lang|haw|Lāna{{okina}}i o Kauluā{{okina}}au}}, which can be rendered in English as "day of the conquest of Kauluā{{okina}}au." This epithet refers to the legend of a Mauian prince who was banished to Lanai for some of his wild pranks at his father's court in Lāhainā. The island was reportedly haunted by Akua-ino, ghosts and goblins. Kauluā{{okina}}au chased them away and brought peace and order to the island and regained his father's favor as a consequence.

The first people to migrate here, most likely from Maui and Moloka{{okina}}i, probably established fishing villages along the coast initially but later branched out into the interior where they raised [[taro]] in the fertile [[Basalt|volcanic]] [[soil]].  During most of those times, the [[Moi of Maui|Mō{{okina}}ī of Maui]] held dominion over Lanai, but generally left the people of Lanai alone. Life on Lanai remained relatively calm until King [[Kamehameha I]] or [[Kalaniʻōpuʻu|Kalani{{okina}}ōpu{{okina}}u-a-Kaiamamao]] took control, slaughtering people across the island.  So many were killed that [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[George Vancouver]] ignored the island in 1792, because of its apparent lack of villages and population. It is mentioned that Lanai was Kamehameha's favorite fishing spot across Hawaii's main eight islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gohawaii.com/lanai/guidebook/heritage-sites-of-lanai|title=Heritage Sites of Lanai|access-date=18 September 2014}}</ref>

Lanai was first seen by Europeans on February 25, 1779, when [[Charles Clerke|Captain Charles Clerke]] sighted the island from aboard [[James Cook]]'s [[HMS Resolution (Cook)|HMS ''Resolution'']]. Clerke had taken command of the ship after Cook was killed at [[Kealakekua Bay]] on February 14 and was leaving the islands for the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

The history of sugar-growing in Hawaii goes back to 1802, when a farmer from China, Wong Tse Chun, produced a small amount on Lanai. He used a crude stone mill that he had brought with him to crush the cane.

In 1854 a group of Mormons were granted a lease in the ahupua{{okina}}a of Pālāwai. In 1862 [[Walter M. Gibson]] arrived on Lānaʻi to reorganize the Mormon settlement. A year later he bought the ahupua{{okina}}a of Pālāwai for $3000 with the money of the church but put the title in his own name. When the Mormons found this out they excommunicated him but he still got to retain the land.<ref name="lanaichc.org">[https://www.lanaichc.org/historic-summary.html ''Time line of key events in LĀNA‘I's history''] Lana'i Culture and Heritage Center. Retrieved 7 July 2017.</ref> By the 1870s, Walter M. Gibson, still the leader of the [[Mormon]] colony on the island, had acquired most of the land on the island for ranching.<ref name="NYTM 2014/09/28"/>

By 1890 the population of Lānaʻi was reduced to 200. In 1899, Gibson's daughter and son-in-law formed Maunalei Sugar Company, headquartered in Keomuku, on the windward (northeast) coast downstream from Maunalei Valley. The company failed in 1901.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lanaichc.org/Maunalei_Keomoku_Kahalepalaoa/Maunalei_Keomoku_Kahalepalaoa.htm |title=Maunalei, Keomoku and the Kahalepalaoa Vicinity |publisher=Lānaʻi Culture & Heritage Center |access-date=2010-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605070451/http://www.lanaichc.org/Maunalei_Keomoku_Kahalepalaoa/Maunalei_Keomoku_Kahalepalaoa.htm |archive-date=2011-06-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Between 1899 and 1901, however, nearly 800 laborers, mostly from Japan, had been contracted for the plantations. Many [[Native Hawaiians]] continued to live along the less arid windward coast, supporting themselves by [[ranching]] and [[fishing]].<ref name="Kaye">{{cite book |last = Kaye |first = Robin |title = Lanai Folks |publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]] |year=1982 |location = Honolulu |pages = 16–17 |isbn = 978-0-8248-0623-1 }}</ref>

In 1921, Charles Gay planted the first pineapple on Lanai. The population had again decreased to 150, most of whom were the descendants of the traditional families of the island.<ref>[https://www.lanaichc.org/historic-summary.html ''Time line of key events in Lanai's history''] Lana'i Culture and Heritage Center. Retrieved 7 July 2017.</ref> A year later, [[James Dole]], the president of Hawaiian Pineapple Company (later renamed [[Dole Food Company]]), bought the island and developed a large portion of it into the world's largest pineapple plantation.

With [[Hawaii statehood]] in 1959, Lanai became part of the [[Maui County, Hawaii|County of Maui]].

In 1985, Lanai passed into the control of [[David H. Murdock]], as a result of his purchase of [[Castle & Cooke]], then owner of Dole.

In October 1992 the final harvest of pineapple took place on Lanai.<ref name="lanaichc.org"/>

In June 2012, [[Larry Ellison]], then [[CEO]] of [[Oracle Corporation]], purchased Castle & Cooke's 98 percent share of the island for $300 million. The state and individual homeowners own the remaining 2 percent, which includes the harbor and the private homes where the 3,000 inhabitants live.<ref>Shimogawa, Duane.

==Legends==
According to the [[Hawaiian mythology|Hawaiian legends]], man-eating spirits occupied the island. For generations, Maui chiefs believed in these man-eating spirits. Differing legends say that either the prophet Lanikāula drove the spirits from the island or the unruly Maui prince Kauluā{{okina}}au accomplished that heroic feat. The more popular myth is that the mischievous Kauluā{{okina}}au pulled up every [[breadfruit]] tree (''{{okina}}ulu'') he could find on Maui. Finally his father, [[Kakaalaneo|Kaka{{okina}}alaneo]] had to banish him to Lanai, expecting him not to survive in that hostile place. However, Kauluā{{okina}}au outwitted the spirits and drove them from the island. The chief looked across the channel from Maui and saw that his son's fire continued to burn nightly on the shore, and he sent a canoe to Lanai to bring the prince back, redeemed by his courage and cleverness. As a reward, Kaka{{okina}}alaneo gave Kauluā{{okina}}au control of the island and encouraged emigration from other islands.<ref>''Let's Go Hawaii: On a Budget'' by Sara Joy Culver (Let's Go Inc.), p. 350</ref> Kauluā{{okina}}au had, in the meantime, pulled up all the breadfruit trees on Lanai, accounting for the historic lack of them on that island.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Geography==
The highest point in Lanai is Mount Lāna{{okina}}ihale.  It is an inactive [[volcano]] near the center of the island and to the east of Lanai City.  The elevation of Mount Lānaʻihale is {{convert|3,366|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="ElevationRef">{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/economic/databook/db2004/section05.pdf|title=2004 State of Hawaii Databook: Table 5.11 - Elevations of Major Summits|year=2004|publisher=State of Hawaii|access-date=2007-07-23}}</ref>

Lanai was traditionally administered in 13 political subdivisions ([[Ahupuaa|Ahupu{{okina}}a]]), grouped into two districts (''mokuoloko''): ''kona'' ([[Leeward]]) and ''ko{{okina}}olau'' ([[Windward]]). The ''ahupua{{okina}}a'' are listed below, in clockwise sequence, and with original area figures in [[acre]]s, starting in the northwest of the island.<ref>[http://www.lanaichc.org/mahele-on-lanai/mahele-aina.htm The Mahele Aina on Lanai, About Hawaiian Land Management and Land Tenure] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120903221405/http://www.lanaichc.org/mahele-on-lanai/mahele-aina.htm |date=2012-09-03 }}</ref>

Kamoku hosts the largest share of population, because the bigger part of Lanai City falls into it. Parts of Lanai City stretch to Kaa and Paomai. {{As of|2010}}, the remaining ''ahupua{{okina}}a'' were virtually uninhabited. According to the census of 2000, Lanai City accounts for 99 percent of the island population (3164 of 3193). As a [[census-designated place]], Lanai City is defined solely for statistical purposes, and not by administrative boundaries.

A volcanic collapse in Lānaʻi 100,000 years ago generated a [[megatsunami]] that inundated land at elevations higher than {{convert|300|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Deposit from a Giant Wave on the Island of Lānaʻi, Hawaii|journal=Science|first1=James G.|last1=Moore|first2=George W.|last2=Moore|date=14 December 1984|volume=226|issue=4680|pages=1312–1315|doi=10.1126/science.226.4680.1312|pmid=17832630}}</ref>

==Tourism==
{{main|Tourism in Hawaii}}
[[Tourism]] on Lanai began to be prominent in more recent history as the pineapple and [[sugarcane]] industries were phased out in the islands. The number of visitors coming to the island is still relatively small, however, with around 59,000 arrivals forecast for 2016—of all the publicly accessible Hawaiian islands only [[Moloka'i|Moloka{{okina}}i]] attracts fewer visitors.<ref>[http://www.hawaiitourismauthority.org/default/assets/File/HTA%20Annual%20Report%202016%20FINAL.pdf ''Annual Report 2016''] Hawaii Tourist Authority (PDF). Retrieved 7 July 2017.</ref>

{{As of|2016}}, the two [[resort]] [[hotel]]s on Lanai were managed by [[Four Seasons Hotels]]; the [[Four Seasons Resort Lanai]] in [[Manele, Hawaii|Manele Bay]] at ''Hulupoe Beach'', just a few steps from where the ferry from [[Lahaina|Lāhainā]] docks, and the Lodge at Kō{{okina}}ele in the mountains. The Hotel Lanai in Lanai City was built in 1923 by James Dole of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company as a lodge to house the executives overseeing the island's pineapple production. It was the island's only hotel until 1990.

Lanai is also home to three golf courses, one at each Four Seasons resort and a third, free course.
* ''The Challenge at Manele'' borders the ocean and was designed by [[Jack Nicklaus]]. [[Bill Gates]] was married on the 12th hole tee-box at The Challenge at Manele.
* ''The Experience at Koele'' is located in the mountains of Lanai and was designed by noted Southern California golf course architect Ted Robinson Sr, with input from [[Greg Norman]].
* ''The Cavendish'' is a public golf course designed by E.B. Cavendish in 1947. It is a nine-hole course surrounded by Norfolk pines.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cavendish Golf Course|url=http://int.gohawaii.com/en/lanai/experiences/golf/cavendish-golf-course-lanai/|website=Go Hawaii|publisher=Hawaii Tourism Authority|access-date=2018-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216025436/http://int.gohawaii.com/en/lanai/experiences/golf/cavendish-golf-course-lanai/|archive-date=2018-02-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>

''Shipwreck Beach'' on the north shore of the island is so named because of the remains of a wrecked vessel aground a short distance offshore.  This is popularly referred to as a WW II [[Liberty Ship]], although it is YOGN 42, one of several [[concrete barge]]s built during the war.<ref>[http://www.to-hawaii.com/lanai/beaches/shipwreck-beach.php Shipwreck Beach, Lanai] Hawaii Travel Guide | To-Hawaii.com</ref>

In Lanai City, there are no traffic lights, no [[shopping mall]]s, and [[public transportation]] is supplied by the hotels. For a one-time fee, hotel guests enjoy unlimited rides on small and large buses that go between the hotels and the ferry landing on Manele Bay.
