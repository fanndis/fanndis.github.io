'''Convent of the Sacred Heart''' is an independent [[Catholic school|Roman Catholic]] [[single-sex education|all-girls school]] in the [[Manhattan]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[New York City]].

Founded in 1881 by the [[Society of the Sacred Heart]], a [[Religious congregation|Roman Catholic congregation]] established in [[France]] in 1800, the school is New York City's oldest private school for girls. The school was originally housed in a Manhattan [[brownstone]] on [[Madison Avenue]] at [[54th Street (Manhattan)|East 54th Street]].
