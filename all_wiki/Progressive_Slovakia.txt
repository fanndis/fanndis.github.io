==History==
[[File:Progressive Slovakia logo.png|thumb|upright|Original logo of Progressive Slovakia]]
The party was registered with the Slovak Interior Ministry on November 28, 2017, after the submission of 13,500 signatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20706608/interior-ministry-registers-new-political-party-progressive-slovakia.html|title=Interior Ministry registers new political party: Progressive Slovakia|work=[[The Slovak Spectator]]|date=29 November 2017}}</ref> The party's founding congress was held on January 20, 2018, which resulted in {{ill|Ivan Štefunko|sk}} being elected as the party's chairman. Štefunko views the [[left–right political spectrum]] as obsolete, instead aiming for the party to be a centrist and liberal political movement, claiming that "Slovakia is full of people who want a modern, open and European country".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20743889/newly-launched-progressive-slovakia-aims-for-20-percent-of-the-vote-in-the-next-election.html|title=Newly launched Progressive Slovakia aims for 20 percent of the vote in the next election|date=22 January 2018|work=[[The Slovak Spectator]]}}</ref> However, Štefunko stepped down as the party's leader in 2019 following criticism of his past involvement in business and politics, although the official reasoning for his resignation was health issues.<ref name="Kafka" /> Štefunko was replaced by former deputy leader {{ill|Michal Truban|sk}}.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jeseňák |first1=Šimon |title=Michal Truban: Nemám dojem, že sme Kisku odplašili |url=https://www.tyzden.sk/rozhovory/60273/michal-truban-pravica-a-lavica-su-dogma/ |accessdate=25 November 2019 |work=[[.týždeň]] |date=18 November 2019 |language=sk}}</ref> Truban is an IT professional, an entrepreneur, and an anti-corruption activist, who also favors digitalization of governance and bureaucracy.<ref name="Kafka" />

[[File:Zuzana_Čaputová_(20.6.2019)VII.jpg| thumb|[[Zuzana Čaputová]], who was a former member of Progressive Slovakia, became the first female president in Slovakia's history.]]
The party first gained attention in 2018 when its favored candidate, [[Matúš Vallo]], won the [[2018 Slovak local elections|municipal elections]] in Bratislava, and subsequently became the city's mayor.<ref name=Kafka>{{cite news |last1=Potočár |first1=Libor |title=Čaputová's Progressive Slovakia Party on the rise ahead of EU elections |url=https://kafkadesk.org/2019/05/06/caputovas-progressive-slovakia-party-on-the-rise-ahead-of-eu-elections/ |accessdate=25 November 2019 |work=Kafkadesk |date=6 May 2019}}</ref> After the [[2019 Slovak presidential election]], the victory of Progressive Slovakia's presidential candidate, 45-year-old lawyer [[Zuzana Čaputová]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Zuzana Čaputová elected President of Slovakia |url=https://tass.com/world/1051345 |accessdate=25 November 2019 |work=[[TASS]] |date=30 March 2019}}</ref> was hailed by international media commentators as a victory of liberalism over [[right-wing populism]].<ref name=london/> According to Professor Michael Rossi, Čaputová's popularity is related to her appeal as an outsider amidst frustration over political corruption and [[clientelism]] among the electorate. Čaputová first gained fame as a campaigner against a toxic waste dump created by real estate brokers who were connected to the ruling [[Smer-SD]], which led to many commentators describing her as the "Slovak [[Erin Brokovich]]".<ref name=london>{{cite news |last1=Rossi |first1=Michael |title=Slovakia's 'progressive turn' is a rejection of corruption – not a stand against populism |url=https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2019/06/14/slovakias-progressive-turn-is-a-rejection-of-corruption-not-a-stand-against-populism/ |accessdate=25 November 2019 |work=EUROPP—European Politics and Policy |publisher=[[London School of Economics]] |date=14 June 2019}}</ref> While campaigning for the presidency, Čaputová focused on the issues of corruption, inflation, justice, the environment, and overhaul of healthcare, and ran on the slogan "stand up to evil". She stayed silent on the issue of immigration and open borders, which most Slovaks are opposed to, and was the only major candidate not to condemn the [[Global Compact on Migration]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lindsay |first1=Frey |title=Will Slovakia's New Progressive President Change Anything On Migration? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/freylindsay/2019/04/25/will-slovakias-new-progressive-president-change-anything-on-migration/#e768f9a4192d |accessdate=25 November 2019 |work=Forbes |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Walker |first1=Shaun |title=Zuzana Čaputová, the spiritual liberal who beat Slovakia's populists |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/13/zuzana-caputova-slovakia-president-spiritual-liberal-progressive-values |accessdate=25 November 2019 |work=The Observer |date=13 April 2019}}</ref>

The party also got the highest share in the [[2019 European Parliament election in Slovakia]], earning over 20.1% of the vote and becoming the largest party represented in the Slovak section of the European Parliament, with the establishment [[Smer-SD]]'s 15.7% and the [[neo-fascist]] [[Kotleba – People's Party Our Slovakia]]'s 12.1%.<ref name=Reuters>{{cite news |last1=Jancarikova |first1=Tatiana |title=Liberal coalition Progressive Slovakia/Together wins EU vote in Slovakia |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-election-slovakia/liberal-coalition-progressive-slovakia-together-wins-eu-vote-in-slovakia-idUSKCN1SW0XF |accessdate=25 November 2019 |work=Reuters |date=26 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref> For the [[2020 Slovak parliamentary election]], Progressive Slovakia signed a cooperation agreement and non-aggression pact with former president [[Andrej Kiska]]'s extra-parliamentary [[Za ľudí]] (For the People) party and the [[Christian Democratic Movement]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Kiska: We will defeat Fico |url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22259643/andrej-kiska-we-will-defeat-robert-fico-2020-elections-slovakia.html |accessdate=25 November 2019 |work=The Slovak Spectator |date=14 November 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=For the People Joins Non-Aggression Pact of PS-Together and KDH |url=https://newsnow.tasr.sk/policy/for-the-people-joins-non-aggression-pact-of-ps-together-and-kdh/ |accessdate=25 November 2019 |work=News Agency of the Slovak Republic}}</ref> However on election day, in rather stunning fashion, the PS/Spolu coalition narrowly missed on entering the [[National Council (Slovakia)|National Council]] after finishing with 6.96% of the vote,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://volbysr.sk/en/data02.html|title=Valid Votes Cast for Political Parties by Territorial Division|website=The Election to the National Council of the Slovak Republic&mdash;29th February 2020|date=1 March 2020|publisher=Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic|access-date=22 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020122838/http://volbysr.sk/en/data02.html|archive-date=20 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> as coalitions must reach a threshold of 7% in order to enter parliament.<ref name="PEE"/>
