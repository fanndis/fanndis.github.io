'''Pearl Sydenstricker Buck''' (June 26, 1892 – March 6, 1973; also known by her Chinese name '''Sai Zhenzhu'''; {{zh|c={{linktext|赛|珍|珠}}|s=|t=|p=}}) was an American writer and novelist. As the daughter of [[missionaries]], Buck spent most of her life before 1934 in [[Zhenjiang]], [[China]]. Her novel ''[[The Good Earth]]'' was the best-selling fiction book in the United States in 1931 and 1932 and won the [[Pulitzer Prize for the Novel|Pulitzer Prize]] in 1932. In 1938, she was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] "for her rich and truly epic descriptions of [[Rural society in China|peasant life in China]] and for her biographical masterpieces".<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1938/ The Nobel Prize in Literature 1938] Accessed 9 Mar 2013</ref> She was the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.

After returning to the United States in 1935, she continued writing prolifically, became a prominent advocate of the [[women's rights|rights of women]] and [[minority rights|minority groups]], and wrote widely on Chinese and [[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]], becoming particularly well known for her efforts on behalf of Asian and [[Interracial adoption|mixed-race adoption]].

==Early life==
[[File:Pearl Buck Birthplace 2.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The Stulting House at the [[Pearl Buck Birthplace]] in Hillsboro, West Virginia]]

Originally named Comfort by her parents,<ref>Lian Xi, ''The Conversion of Missionaries'', University Park, PA: Penn State University Press, 1996) 102 {{ISBN|0271064382}}.</ref> Pearl Sydenstricker was born in [[Hillsboro, West Virginia|Hillsboro]], [[West Virginia]], United States, to Caroline Maude (Stulting) (1857–1921) and [[Absalom Sydenstricker]]. Her parents, [[American Southern Presbyterian Mission|Southern Presbyterian]] [[Mission (Christian)|missionaries]], traveled to China soon after their marriage on July 8, 1880, but returned to the United States for Pearl's birth. When Pearl was five months old, the family arrived in China, first in [[Huai'an]] and then in 1896 moved to [[Zhenjiang]] (then often known as Jingjiang or, in the [[Chinese postal romanization]] system, Tsingkiang), near Nanking.<ref>{{citation|first=David |last=Shavit|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1990|isbn=0-313-26788-X

Of her siblings who survived into adulthood, [[Edgar Sydenstricker]] had a distinguished career with the [[United States Public Health Service]] and later the [[Milbank Quarterly|Milbank Memorial Fund]] and Grace Sydenstricker Yaukey (1899–1994) was a writer who wrote young adult books and books about Asia under the pen name Cornelia Spencer.<ref>{{cite news |title=Grace Sydenstricker Yaukey papers, 1934–1968 |url=http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv07534 |accessdate=17 January 2019 |publisher=Orbis Cascade Alliance}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Grace S.

[[File:Coolieresting.jpg|thumb|Chinese man in Zhenjiang, {{Circa|1900}}]]

Pearl recalled in her memoir that she lived in "several worlds", one a "small, white, clean Presbyterian world of my parents", and the other the "big, loving merry not-too-clean Chinese world", and there was no communication between them.<ref>Pearl S. Buck, ''My Several Worlds: A Personal Record'' (New York: John Day, 1954) p. 10.</ref> The [[Boxer Uprising]] greatly affected the family; their Chinese friends deserted them, and Western visitors decreased. Her father, convinced that no Chinese could wish him harm, stayed behind as the rest of the family went to Shanghai for safety. A few years later, Pearl was enrolled in Miss Jewell's School there and was dismayed at the racist attitudes of the other students, few of whom could speak any Chinese. Both of her parents felt strongly that Chinese were their equals (they forbade the use of the word ''heathen''), and she was raised in a bilingual environment: tutored in English by her mother, in the local dialect by her Chinese playmates, and in classical Chinese by a Chinese scholar named Mr. Kung. She also read voraciously, especially, in spite of her father's disapproval, the novels of [[Charles Dickens]], which she later said she read through once a year for the rest of her life.<ref>Peter Conn, ''Pearl S. Buck: A Cultural Biography'', Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1996) 9, 19–23 {{ISBN|0521560802}}.</ref>

In 1911, Pearl left China to attend [[Randolph-Macon Woman's College]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], [[Virginia]], graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1914 and a member of [[Kappa Delta]] Sorority. Although she had not intended to return to China, much less become a missionary, she quickly applied to the Presbyterian Board when her father wrote that her mother was seriously ill. From 1914 to 1932, she served as a Presbyterian missionary, but her views later became highly controversial during the [[Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy]], leading to her resignation.<ref name="Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 70–82">Conn, ''Pearl S. Buck'', 70–82.</ref>

==Career in China==

In 1914, Pearl returned to China. She married an agricultural economist missionary, [[John Lossing Buck]], on May 30, 1917, and they moved to [[Suzhou, Anhui|Suzhou, Anhui Province]], a small town on the [[Huai River]] (not to be confused with the better-known Suzhou in Jiangsu Province). This region she describes in her books ''The Good Earth'' and ''Sons''.

From 1920 to 1933, the Bucks made their home in Nanjing, on the campus of the [[University of Nanking]], where they both had teaching positions. She taught [[English literature]] at the private, church-run University of Nanking,<ref>{{cite book|author=Gould Hunter Thomas|
title=''An American in China, 1936-1939: A Memoir''| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fL9PAAACAAJ|date=2004| chapter=Nanking | chapter-url=http://www.willysthomas.net/Nanking.htm | publisher=Greatrix Press|isbn=978-0-9758800-0-5}}</ref> [[Ginling College]] and at the [[Nanjing University|National Central University]]. In 1920, the Bucks had a daughter, Carol, afflicted with [[phenylketonuria]]. In 1921, Buck's mother died of a tropical disease, [[Tropical sprue|sprue]], and shortly afterward her father moved in. In 1924, they left China for John Buck's year of sabbatical and returned to the United States for a short time, during which Pearl Buck earned her [[Master of Arts|master's]] degree from [[Cornell University]]. In 1925, the Bucks adopted Janice (later surnamed Walsh). That autumn, they returned to China.<ref name="Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 70–82"/>

The tragedies and dislocations that Buck suffered in the 1920s reached a climax in March 1927, during the "[[Nanking incident of 1927|Nanking Incident]]". In a confused battle involving elements of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s Nationalist troops, Communist forces, and assorted warlords, several Westerners were murdered. Since her father Absalom insisted, as he had in 1900 in the face of the Boxers, the family decided to stay in Nanjing until the battle reached the city. When violence broke out, a poor Chinese family invited them to hide in their hut while the family house was looted. The family spent a day terrified and in hiding, after which they were rescued by American gunboats. They traveled to Shanghai and then sailed to Japan, where they stayed for a year, after which they moved back to Nanjing. Buck later said that this year in Japan showed her that not all Japanese were militarists. When she returned from Japan in late 1927, Buck devoted herself in earnest to the vocation of writing. Friendly relations with prominent Chinese writers of the time, such as [[Xu Zhimo]] and [[Lin Yutang]], encouraged her to think of herself as a professional writer. She wanted to fulfill the ambitions denied to her mother, but she also needed money to support herself if she left her marriage, which had become increasingly lonely, and since the mission board could not provide it, she also needed money for Carol's specialized care. Buck went once more to the States in 1929 to find long-term care for Carol, and while there, [[Richard J. Walsh]], editor at [[John Day Company|John Day publishers]] in New York, accepted her novel ''[[East Wind: West Wind]]''. She and Walsh began a relationship that would result in marriage and many years of professional teamwork. Back in Nanking, she retreated every morning to the attic of her university bungalow and within the year completed the manuscript for ''[[The Good Earth]]''.<ref name="Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 345">Conn, ''Pearl S. Buck'', 345.</ref>
[[File:Pearl Buck.jpg|thumb|Pearl Buck in 1932, about the time ''The Good Earth'' was published<br/>''Photo'': [[Arnold Genthe]]]]
When John Lossing Buck took the family to Ithaca the next year, Pearl accepted an invitation to address a luncheon of Presbyterian women at the Astor Hotel in New York City. Her talk was titled "Is There a Case for the Foreign Missionary?" and her answer was a barely qualified "no". She told her American audience that she welcomed Chinese to share her Christian faith, but argued that China did not need an institutional church dominated by missionaries who were too often ignorant of China and arrogant in their attempts to control it. When the talk was published in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'',<ref>Pearl S. Buck, "Is There a Case for Foreign Missions?," ''Harper's'' 166 (January 1933):  143–155.</ref> the scandalized reaction led Buck to resign her position with the Presbyterian Board. In 1934, Buck left China, believing she would return,<ref name=":0"/> while John Lossing Buck remained.<ref>Buck, Pearl S. ''The Good Earth.'' Ed. Peter Conn. New York: Washington Square Press, 1994. pp. xviii–xix.</ref>

==Career in the United States==

In 1935 the Bucks divorced in [[Reno, Nevada]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pearl Buck's divorce|url = http://renodivorcehistory.org/library/pearl-bucks-divorce/|website = renodivorcehistory.org|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}</ref> and she married Richard Walsh that same day.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/essays/resurrection-pearl-buck|title=The Resurrection of Pearl Buck|last=Melvin|first=Sheila|date=2006|website=Wilson Quarterly Archives|access-date=2016-10-24}}</ref> He offered her advice and affection which, her biographer concludes, "helped make Pearl's prodigious activity possible". The couple lived in [[Pennsylvania]] until his death in 1960.<ref name="Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 345"/>

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Buck, as a preeminent American writer of Chinese village life, was denounced as an "American [[Cultural imperialism|cultural imperialist]]".<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125682489 | title=A Chinese Fan Of Pearl S. Buck Returns The Favor| date=April 7, 2010 | work=[[NPR]]}}</ref> Buck was "heartbroken" when she was prevented from visiting China with [[Richard Nixon]] in 1972. Her 1962 novel ''[[Satan Never Sleeps]]'' described the Communist tyranny in China. Following the Communist Revolution in 1949, Buck was repeatedly refused all attempts to return to her beloved China and therefore was compelled to remain in the United States for the rest of her life.<ref name=":0"/>

Pearl S. Buck died of [[lung cancer]] on March 6, 1973, in [[Danby, Vermont|Danby]], [[Vermont]], and was interred in [[Green Hills Farm]] in [[Perkasie, Pennsylvania]]. She designed her own tombstone. Her name was not inscribed in English on her tombstone. Instead, the grave marker is inscribed with Chinese characters representing the name Pearl Sydenstricker.<ref>Conn, Peter, [http://www.orlok.com/cyberbil/pearl2/pbbio.html Dragon and the Pearl]</ref>

==Nobel Prize in Literature==

In 1938 the Nobel Prize committee in awarding the prize said:

{{quote|By awarding this year's Prize to Pearl Buck for the notable works which pave the way to a human sympathy passing over widely separated racial boundaries and for the studies of human ideals which are a great and living art of portraiture, the Swedish Academy feels that it acts in harmony and accord with the aim of Alfred Nobel's dreams for the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1938/ceremony-speech/|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1938|website=NobelPrize.org}}</ref>}}

In her speech to the Academy, she took as her topic "The Chinese Novel." She explained, "I am an American by birth and by ancestry", but "my earliest knowledge of story, of how to tell and write stories, came to me in China." After an extensive discussion of classic Chinese novels, especially ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', ''[[Water Margin|All Men Are Brothers]]'', and ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'', she concluded that in China "the novelist did not have the task of creating art but of speaking to the people." Her own ambition, she continued, had not been trained toward "the beauty of letters or the grace of art." In China, the task of the novelist differed from the Western artist: "To farmers he must talk of their land, and to old men he must speak of peace, and to old women he must tell of their children, and to young men and women he must speak of each other." And like the Chinese novelist, she concluded, "I have been taught to want to write for these people. If they are reading their magazines by the million, then I want my stories there rather than in magazines read only by a few."<ref>Nobel Lecture (1938) [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1938/buck-lecture.html# The Chinese Novel]</ref>

==Humanitarian efforts and later life==

Buck was highly committed to a range of issues that were largely ignored by her generation. Many of her life experiences and political views are described in her novels, [[short stories]], [[fiction]], children's stories, and the biographies of her parents entitled ''[[Fighting Angel]]'' (on Absalom) and ''[[The Exile (Buck book)|The Exile]]'' (on Carrie). She wrote on diverse subjects, including [[women's rights]], Asian cultures, [[immigration]], adoption, missionary work, war, the atomic bomb (''Command the Morning''), and violence.
[[File:Pearl Buck and Swedish King.gif|thumb|Pearl S. Buck is receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature from King Gustav V of Sweden in the Stockholm Concert Hall in 1938]]
She was involved in the charity relief campaign for the victims of the [[1931 China floods]], writing a series of short stories describing the plight of refugees, which were broadcast on the radio in the United States and later published in her collected volume ''The First Wife and Other Stories''.<ref name ="Courtney">Courtney, Chris (2018), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1DhFDwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y "The Nature of Disaster in China: The 1931 Central China Flood"], Cambridge University Press [{{ISBN|978-1-108-41777-8}}]</ref> In 1949, outraged that existing [[adoption]] services considered Asian and [[multiracial|mixed-race]] children unadoptable, Buck co-founded Welcome House, Inc.,<ref>{{Cite web| title = Welcome House: A Historical Perspective| work = Pearl S.

Michener]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] and his second wife [[Dorothy Hammerstein]]. In nearly five decades of work, Welcome House has placed over five thousand children. In 1964, to support kids who were not eligible for adoption, Buck established the Pearl S. Buck Foundation (name changed to [[Pearl S. Buck House National Historic Landmark|Pearl S. Buck International]] in 1999)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pearlsbuck.org/|title=Home|last=amy.gress|website=Pearl S Buck|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref> to "address poverty and discrimination faced by children in Asian countries". In 1964, she opened the Opportunity Center and Orphanage in [[South Korea]], and later offices were opened in [[Thailand]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Vietnam]]. When establishing Opportunity House, Buck said, "The purpose ... is to publicize and eliminate injustices and prejudices suffered by children, who, because of their birth, are not permitted to enjoy the educational, social, economic and civil privileges normally accorded to children."<ref>Pearl S. Buck International, "[http://www.psbi.org/site/PageServer?pagename=PSBI_AboutUs_History Our History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231155031/http://www.psbi.org/site/PageServer?pagename=PSBI_AboutUs_History |date=2006-12-31 }}," 2009.</ref>

In 1960, after a long decline in health, her husband Richard died. She renewed a warm relation with [[William Ernest Hocking]], who died in 1966. Buck then withdrew from many of her old friends and quarreled with others. In 1962 Buck asked the Israeli Government for clemency for [[Adolf Eichmann]], the Nazi war criminal who was complicit in the deaths of five million Jews during WWII.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Eichmann : his life and crimes|last=Cesarani, David.|date=2005|publisher=Vintage|isbn=0-09-944844-0|location=London|pages=319–20|oclc=224240952}}</ref> In the late 1960s, Buck toured West Virginia to raise money to preserve her family farm in [[Hillsboro, West Virginia|Hillsboro]], [[West Virginia]].

Long before it was considered fashionable or politically safe to do so, Buck challenged the American public by raising consciousness on topics such as racism, sex discrimination and the plight of Asian [[war children]]. During her life, Buck combined the careers of wife, mother, author, editor, international spokesperson, and political activist.<ref name="Conn, Pearl S. Buck, xv-xvi">Conn, ''Pearl S. Buck'', xv–xvi.</ref>

==Final years==
In the mid-1960s, Buck increasingly came under the influence of Theodore Harris, a former dance instructor, who became her confidant, co-author, and financial advisor. She soon depended on him for all her daily routines, and placed him in control of Welcome House and the Pearl S. Buck Foundation. Harris, who was given a lifetime salary as head of the foundation, created a scandal for Buck when he was accused of mismanaging the foundation, diverting large amounts of the foundation's funds for his friends' and his own personal expenses, and treating staff poorly.<ref name = ril>{{citation|first=Greg|last=Walter|chapter='Philadelphia', as quoted|editor1=Sam G.

== Death ==
Buck died on March 6, 1973, from lung cancer. After her death, Buck's children contested the will and accused Harris of exerting "undue influence" on Buck during the last few years. Harris failed to appear at trial and the court ruled in the family's favor.{{sfnb|Conn|1996|p=376}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Overturning of Buck Will Seen as a Product of Passion|work=Lewiston Daily Sun|date= August 10, 1974|page=9}}</ref>

Many contemporary reviewers were positive and praised her "beautiful prose", even though her "style is apt to degenerate into over-repetition and confusion".<ref>{{cite journal|last=E.G.|title=Rev. of ''Sons''|journal=[[Pacific Affairs]]|year=1933|volume=6|issue=2/3|pages=112–15|doi=10.2307/2750834|jstor=2750834}}</ref> [[Robert Benchley]] wrote a parody of ''The Good Earth'' that focused on just these qualities. Peter Conn, in his biography of Buck, argues that despite the accolades awarded to her, Buck's contribution to literature has been mostly forgotten or deliberately ignored by America's cultural gatekeepers.<ref name="Conn, Pearl S. Buck, xii-xiv">Conn, ''Pearl S.

Buck: a cultural bridge across the Pacific|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-30146-9|pages=4}}</ref> [[Phyllis Bentley]], in an overview of Buck's work published in 1935, was altogether impressed: "But we may say at least that for the interest of her chosen material, the sustained high level of her technical skill, and the frequent universality of her conceptions, Mrs. Buck is entitled to take rank as a considerable artist. To read her novels is to gain not merely knowledge of China but wisdom about life."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bentley|first=Phyllis|title=The Art of Pearl S.

Chinese-American author [[Anchee Min]] said she "broke down and sobbed" after reading ''The Good Earth'' for the first time as an adult, which she had been forbidden to read growing up in China during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Min said Buck portrayed the Chinese peasants "with such love, affection and humanity" and it inspired Min's novel ''Pearl of China'' (2010), a fictional biography about Buck.<ref name=npr>NPR, "[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125682489 A Chinese Fan Of Pearl S.

Buck's former residence at [[Nanjing University]] is now the Sai Zhenzhu Memorial House along the West Wall of the university's north campus. U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] toured the Pearl S.

He expressed that he, like millions of other Americans, had gained an appreciation for the Chinese people through Buck's writing.<ref>{{Citation | title = DDMap.com: 赛珍珠故居 | url = http://nj.ddmap.com/25/ddshop/659569 | accessdate = 2010-02-21 | language = zh | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111830/http://nj.ddmap.com/25/ddshop/659569 | archive-date = 2015-04-02 }}</ref>
