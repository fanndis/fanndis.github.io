'''Jean-Claude Juncker''' ({{IPA-lb|ʒɑ̃ːkloːt ˈjuŋkɐ|lang}}; born 9 December 1954) is a [[Luxembourg]] [[politician]], who served as [[President of the European Commission]] from 2014 to 2019 and as the 23rd [[Prime Minister of Luxembourg]] from 1995 to 2013. He was also the [[List of Ministers for Finances of Luxembourg|Minister for Finances]] from 1989 to 2009.

By the time Juncker left office, he was the longest-serving head of any national government in the EU and one of the longest-serving democratically elected leaders in the world, with his tenure encompassing the height of the [[Eurozone crisis|European financial and sovereign debt crisis]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=McDonald-Gibson |first1=Charlotte |title=Luxembourg PM Jean-Claude Juncker calls snap elections amid secret |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/luxembourg-pm-jean-claude-juncker-calls-snap-elections-amid-secret-service-scandal-risking-longest-8702604.html |access-date=12 August 2019 |work=The Independent |date=11 July 2013 |language=en}}</ref> From 2005 to 2013, he served as the first permanent President of the [[Eurogroup]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Jean-Claude Juncker, former president of the Eurogroup - Consilium |url=https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/eurogroup/former-eurogroup-presidents/jean-claude-juncker-former-president-of-the-eurogroup/ |website=www.consilium.europa.eu |access-date=24 July 2019}}</ref>

In 2014, the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) had Juncker as its lead candidate, or ''[[Spitzenkandidat]]'', for the presidency of the Commission in the [[2014 European Parliament election|2014 elections]]. This marked the first time that the ''Spitzenkandidat'' process was employed.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Crisp |first1=James |title=The Brief: The race to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker |url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/all/news/the-brief-the-race-to-succeed-jean-claude-juncker/ |access-date=16 February 2017 |work=euractiv.com |date=13 February 2017}}</ref> Juncker is the first president to have campaigned as a candidate for the position prior to the election, a process introduced with the [[Treaty of Lisbon]].

Juncker has stated that his priorities would be the creation of a digital [[Internal market|single market]], the development of an EU [[Energy policy of the European Union|Energy Union]], the negotiation of the [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership|Transatlantic Trade Agreement]], the continued reform of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]]—with the social dimension in mind, a "targeted fiscal capacity" for the [[Eurozone]], and the [[2015–16 United Kingdom renegotiation of European Union membership|2015-16 British EU membership renegotiations]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Jean-Claude Juncker: My priorities |url=http://juncker.epp.eu/my-priorities |website=juncker.epp.eu |access-date=18 June 2014 |language=en}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Juncker was born in [[Redange]] and spent the majority of his childhood in [[Belvaux]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} His father, Joseph, was a steel worker and Christian trade unionist who was forcibly conscripted into the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' during [[World War II]], following the [[German occupation of Luxembourg during World War II|Nazi occupation of Luxembourg]].<ref>{{cite news |author1=SPIEGEL staff |title=Commission Crusade: Cameron Outmaneuvered in Battle over Juncker |url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/cameron-and-juncker-fight-over-role-in-european-commission-a-975528.html |access-date=3 September 2019 |work=Spiegel Online |quote= his 90-year-old father burst into tears when a tabloid accused him of Nazi association.

He joined the [[Christian Social People's Party]] in 1974.<ref name="eu2005" /> He studied law at the [[University of Strasbourg]], graduating with a [[master's degree]] in 1979; although he was sworn into the Luxembourg [[Bar Council]] in 1980, he never practised as a lawyer.

== Career in Luxembourgish politics ==

=== Early years ===
{{BLP sources section|date=September 2015}}
Following Juncker's graduation from the [[University of Strasbourg]], he was appointed as a [[Parliamentary Secretary]]. He later won election to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]] for the first time in [[1984 Luxembourg general election|1984]] and was immediately appointed to the [[Government of Luxembourg|Cabinet]] of Prime Minister [[Jacques Santer]] as Minister of Labour.<ref name="eu2005">{{cite web|title=Jean-Claude Juncker|url=http://www.eu2005.lu/en/presidence/membres/juncker/|website=eu2005.lu|access-date=5 September 2015}}</ref> In the second half of 1985, Luxembourg held the rotating [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency]] of the [[Council of the European Communities]], permitting Juncker to develop his European leadership qualities as chair of the Social Affairs and Budget Councils.<ref name="eu2005" /> It was here that Juncker's [[pro-Europe]] credentials first emerged.<ref name="eu2005" />

Shortly before the [[1989 Luxembourg general election|1989 election]] Juncker was seriously injured in a road accident, spending two weeks in a coma.<ref name="eu2005" /> He has stated that the accident has caused him difficulty with balancing since.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Quatremer |first1=Jean |title=Jean-Claude Juncker, verre de rage |url=http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2016/09/13/jean-claude-juncker-verre-de-rage_1495839 |work=Libération.fr |date=13 September 2016 |language=fr}}</ref> He nonetheless recovered in time to be returned to the Chamber of Deputies once more, after which he was promoted to become [[List of Ministers for Finances of Luxembourg|Minister for Finance]], a post traditionally seen as a [[rite of passage]] to the premiership of the country. His eventual promotion to Prime Minister seemed at this time inevitable, with political commentators concluding that Santer was grooming Juncker as his successor. Juncker at this time also accepted the position of Luxembourg's representative on the 188-member Board of Governors of the [[World Bank]].<ref name="eu2005" />

Juncker's second election to Parliament, in 1989, saw him gain prominence within the [[European Union]]; Juncker chaired the [[Council of the European Union#Formations|Council of Economic and Financial Affairs]] (ECOFIN), during Luxembourg's 1991 presidency of the Council of the European Communities, becoming a key architect of the [[Maastricht Treaty]].<ref name="eu2005" /> Juncker was largely responsible for clauses on [[Economic and Monetary Union]], the process that would eventually give rise to the Euro, and in particular is credited with devising the "[[Opt-outs in the European Union|opt-out]]" principle for the UK to assuage its concerns.<ref name="eu2005" /> Juncker was himself a signatory to the Treaty in 1992, having, by that time taken over as parliamentary leader of the Christian Social People's Party.<ref name="eu2005" />

Juncker was re-elected to the Chamber in 1994, maintaining his ministerial role. With Santer ready to be nominated as the next [[President of the European Commission]], it was only six months later that [[Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke Jean]] approved the appointment of Juncker as Prime Minister on 20 January 1995, as part of a coalition with the [[Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party]]. Juncker relinquished his post at the World Bank at this time, but maintained his position as Minister for Finance.<ref name="eu2005" />

=== Premiership ===

[[File:Vladimir Putin in Luxembourg 24 May 2007-22.jpg|thumb|Juncker with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] on 24 May 2007]]
Juncker's first term as Prime Minister was focused on an economic platform of international bilateral ties to improve Luxembourg's profile abroad, which included a number of official visits abroad. During one such visit, to [[Dublin]] in December 1996, Juncker successfully mediated a dispute over his own EU Economic and Monetary Union policy between [[French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]]. The press dubbed Juncker the "Hero of Dublin" for achieving an unlikely consensus between the two.<ref>{{cite web|title=Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker to Present Distinguished Lecture at Pitt April 10|url=http://www.news.pitt.edu/news/luxembourg-prime-minister-jean-claude-juncker-present-distinguished-lecture-pitt-april-10|website=news.pitt.edu|access-date=5 September 2015}}</ref>

1997 brought the rotating Presidency of the European Council to Luxembourg, during which time Juncker championed the cause of [[social integration]] in Europe, along with constituting the so-called "Luxembourg Process" for integrated European policy against unemployment. He also instigated the "Euro 11", an informal group of European finance ministers for matters regarding his Economic and Monetary Union ideals. For all of these initiatives, he was honoured with the [[Vision for Europe Award]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean-Claude Juncker as Head of the EPP|url=http://www.democraticunion.eu/2014/03/jean-claude-juncker-head-epp/|website=democraticunion|access-date=5 September 2015}}</ref>

Juncker succeeded in winning another term as Prime Minister in the [[1999 Luxembourgian legislative election|1999 election]], although the coalition with the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party was broken in favour of one with the [[Democratic Party (Luxembourg)|Democratic Party]]. After the [[2004 Luxembourgian legislative election|2004 election]], the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party became the second largest party again, and Juncker again formed a coalition with them.<ref name="eu2005"/>

In 2005, Juncker inherited a second term as President of the European Council. Shortly after the expiration of his term came [[Luxembourgian referendum on the European Constitution|Luxembourg's referendum on ratification]], and Juncker staked his political career on its success, promising to resign if the referendum failed. The final result was a 56.5% Yes vote on an 88% turnout. His continued allegiance to European ideals earned him the 2006 [[Karlspreis]]. In 2009, he denounced the lifting of the excommunication of controversial Bishop [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]], a member of the [[Society of Saint Pius X]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gouvernement.lu/salle_presse/actualite/2009/02-fevrier/04-juncker-pape/ |title=Réaction de Jean-Claude Juncker à la réhabilitation par le pape d'un évêque négationniste |publisher=Gouvernement.lu |access-date=20 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110040547/http://www.gouvernement.lu/salle_presse/actualite/2009/02-fevrier/04-juncker-pape/ |archive-date=10 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Juncker supported the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]]. Juncker added that he wanted NATO to take control of coalition military efforts in [[Libya]] as soon as possible.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-23/juncker-calls-for-nato-to-assume-control-of-libya-no-fly-zone.html|agency=Bloomberg L.P.|date=24 March 2011|title=Juncker Calls for NATO to Assume Control of Libya No-Fly Zone|first=Stephanie|last=Bodoni}}</ref>

==Career in European politics==

===Presidency of the Eurogroup===
In 2004, the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers decided to replace the rotating chairmanship with a permanent president. Juncker was appointed as the first permanent president and assumed the chair on 1 January 2005. He was re-appointed for a second term in September 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200609/09/eng20060909_301052.html|title=Juncker re-elected Eurogroup president, voicing optimism over economic growth|newspaper=People's Daily|date=9 September 2006|access-date=29 June 2014}}</ref> Under the Lisbon Treaty, this system was formalised and Juncker was confirmed for another term.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Willis |first1=Andrew |title=Luxembourg leader set to extend euro zone reign |url=http://euobserver.com/economic/29083 |access-date=29 June 2014 |work=EUobserver |date=2 December 2009 |language=en}}</ref> Juncker stepped down on 21 January 2013, when he was succeeded by Dutch [[Ministry of Finance (Netherlands)|Finance Minister]] [[Jeroen Dijsselbloem]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fox |first1=Benjamin |title=Dijsselbloem to replace Juncker as Eurogroup chief |url=https://euobserver.com/economic/118688 |access-date=4 September 2019 |work=EUobserver |date=10 January 2013 |language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - EPP Summit 15 December 2005 (17).jpg|thumb|Juncker with [[Angela Merkel]] and [[José Manuel Barroso]]]]
During his period as "Mr. Euro", the group was instrumental in negotiating and supervising bailout packages for the countries that faced bankruptcy: Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/eu-elections/124789|title=Who is Jean-Claude Juncker?|publisher=EUobserver|date=27 June 2014|access-date=29 June 2014}}</ref>

Juncker was also an outspoken proponent of enhanced internal co-operation and increased international representation of the group.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Willis |first1=Andrew |title=Juncker wants more eurozone activism |url=http://euobserver.com/economic/29294 |work=EUobserver |date=19 January 2010 |language=en}}</ref>

In a debate in 2011, during the height of the eurozone crisis, Juncker responded to a conference-goer's suggestion to increase the openness of the strategy discussions in the eurogroup, by stating: "When it becomes serious you have to lie".<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi9qG3YbiWg|title=Economic policy of the eurozone needs to be decided in "dark, secret rooms"|date=21 April 2011|publisher=EUobserverTV|access-date=29 June 2014}}</ref> Scholars of financial markets have remarked that the quote is often taken out of context by critics; best practice amongst monetary policy committees in most states is to keep negotiations on decisions confidential to prevent markets from betting against troubled countries until they are finalised. This need is complicated by the Eurozone's arrangements, in which policy negotiations are held in high-profile international summits of eurozone finance ministers, where leaks of ongoing negotiations may potentially put "millions of people at risk".<ref name=":0" /> Indeed, the quote continues;

{{Quote
|text=Monetary policy is a serious issue. We should discuss this in secret, in the Eurogroup.&nbsp;... The same applies to economic and monetary policies in the Union. If we indicate possible decisions, we are fuelling speculations on the financial markets and we are throwing in misery mainly the people we are trying to safeguard from this.&nbsp;... I'm ready to be insulted as being insufficiently democratic, but I want to be serious,&nbsp;... I am for secret, dark debates.

===Presidency of the Commission===
{{Main|Juncker Commission}}
[[File:Jean-Claude Juncker (13598019925).jpg|thumb|Juncker delivering a speech at the election congress of the People's Party in March 2014]]
For the first time in 2014, the [[President of the European Commission]] was appointed under the new provisions established with the Treaty of Lisbon, which had entered into force after the 2009 [[Elections to the European Parliament]], on 1 December 2009. Juncker's aide [[Martin Selmayr]] played a central role in his campaign and later during his presidency as Juncker's campaign director, head of Juncker's transition team and finally as Juncker's head of cabinet (chief of staff).

====Primary election====
[[File:Laophorium Ioannis Claudii Juncker anno 2014.jpg|thumb|The campaign bus of Jean-Claude Juncker used for the 2014 election]]

Almost all major [[European political party|European political parties]], put forward a lead candidate, or ''[[spitzenkandidat]]'' for their respective election campaign. At the election Congress of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP), held in [[Dublin]] on 6–7 March, Jean-Claude Juncker was elected the party's lead candidate for President of the Commission, defeating [[Michel Barnier]]. The congress also adopted the EPP election manifesto, which was used by Juncker during his campaign.<ref>{{cite news|title=EPP Elections Congress Dublin: highlights of final day|url=http://www.epp.eu/epp-elections-congress-dublin-highlights-final-day|access-date=14 July 2014|publisher=EPP|date=7 March 2014|ref=http://www.epp.eu/epp-elections-congress-dublin-highlights-final-day|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723192017/http://www.epp.eu/epp-elections-congress-dublin-highlights-final-day|archive-date=23 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Jean-Claude Juncker elected as EPP candidate for President of the European Commission|url=http://www.epp.eu/jean-claude-juncker-elected-epp-candidate-president-european-commission|access-date=14 July 2014|publisher=EPP|date=7 March 2014|ref=http://www.epp.eu/jean-claude-juncker-elected-epp-candidate-president-european-commission|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710213616/http://www.epp.eu/jean-claude-juncker-elected-epp-candidate-president-european-commission|archive-date=10 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://juncker.epp.eu|title=Jean-Claude Juncker: Experience.

====Election campaign====
{{Further|European Parliament election, 2014}}
In the main debate between the candidates, transmitted live throughout Europe on 16 May via the [[European Broadcasting Union]], all candidates agreed that it would be unacceptable if the [[European Council]] would propose someone as Commission President who had not publicly campaigned for the position ahead of the election.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eurovision debate|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y-2Nd6mC9M|publisher=European Parliament|access-date=14 July 2014|ref=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y-2Nd6mC9M}}</ref>

In the elections, held 22–25 May, the EPP won the most parliamentary seats of all parties (221 of 751), but short of a majority in its own right.<ref>{{cite web|title=Results of the 2014 European elections|url=http://www.results-elections2014.eu/en/election-results-2014.html|publisher=European Parliament|access-date=14 July 2014|ref=http://www.results-elections2014.eu/en/election-results-2014.html}}</ref>

====Institutional approval====
On 27 May, the leaders of five of the seven [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groups of the parliament]] issued a statement that Jean-Claude Juncker, being the lead candidate of the party which won a plurality of the seats, should be given the first attempt to form the required majority to be elected Commission President. Only the ECR and EFD disagreed to this process.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Nielsen |first1=Nikolaj |title=Juncker given first shot at EU commission job |url=http://euobserver.com/eu-elections/124388 |access-date=14 July 2014 |work=EUobserver |date=27 May 2014 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Conference of Presidents statement on Commission President election {{!}} News {{!}} European Parliament |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140527IPR48501/html/Conference-of-Presidents-statement-on-Commission-President-election |website=www.europarl.europa.eu |access-date=14 July 2014 |language=en |date=27 May 2014}}</ref>

Later on 27 May, the European Council gave [[President of the European Council|its president]], [[Herman van Rompuy]], the mandate to start consultations with the group leaders in the European Parliament to identify the best possible candidate. Having less influence over the appointment than under pre-Lisbon law, the Council instead made use of its right to set the strategic priorities, and included discussions with Parliament leaders and Council members alike for a strategic agenda for the upcoming period in Rompuy's mandate.

During the consultations, Juncker and the EPP agreed to cooperation with the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]] (S&D), the second largest group in the new parliament, as well as secured the backing of all but two member state leaders. In return for their support, the centre-left group and state leaders secured promises of a shift in focus away from austerity towards growth and job creation for the coming period, as well as promises of some of the top jobs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Loosen EU budget rules in return for support, Socialists tell Juncker|url=http://euobserver.com/eu-elections/124634|access-date=14 July 2014|publisher=EUobserver|date=17 June 2014|ref=http://euobserver.com/eu-elections/124634}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Italian PM seeks austerity relief in return for Juncker backing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/17/italian-pm-renzi-austerity-juncker-europe|access-date=14 July 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 June 2014|ref=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/17/italian-pm-renzi-austerity-juncker-europe}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Centre-right to strike deal with centre-left on Juncker, Schulz|url=http://euobserver.com/eu-elections/124688|access-date=14 July 2014|publisher=EUobserver|date=23 June 2014|ref=http://euobserver.com/eu-elections/124688}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Socialist leaders back Juncker, want other top jobs|url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/socialist-leaders-back-juncker-want-other-top-jobs-302977|access-date=14 July 2014|publisher=EurActiv|date=23 June 2014|ref=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/socialist-leaders-back-juncker-want-other-top-jobs-302977}}</ref>

The European Council officially proposed Juncker to Parliament as candidate for the Presidency on 27 June, together with a strategic agenda setting out policy priorities for the upcoming Commission mandate period.<ref>{{cite news|title=Strategic agenda for the Union in times of change|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/143477.pdf|access-date=14 July 2014|publisher=European Council|date=27 June 2014|ref=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/143477.pdf}}</ref>

For the first time the nomination was not by consensus, but the European Council voted 26-2 to propose Juncker for the position. Voting against were British PM [[David Cameron]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] / [[Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists|AECR]]) and Hungarian PM [[Viktor Orbán]] ([[Fidesz]] / [[European People's Party|EPP]]), both of whom had frequently opposed Juncker during the election process. Prior to the vote, various media had reported the heads of government of Sweden, Netherlands and Germany were also having similar concerns regarding either the candidate himself, or the way the nomination process was conducted.<ref>{{cite news|title=Merkel meets Juncker opponents in Sweden mini-summit|url=http://www.dw.de/merkel-meets-juncker-opponents-in-sweden-mini-summit/a-17694368|access-date=14 July 2014|publisher=DW|date=10 June 2014|ref=http://www.dw.de/merkel-meets-juncker-opponents-in-sweden-mini-summit/a-17694368}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=he battle for the European Commission - Has Merkel lost her touch?|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2014/06/battle-european-commission|access-date=14 July 2014|newspaper=Economist|date=3 June 2014|ref=https://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2014/06/battle-european-commission}}</ref> This was however never confirmed by the politicians in question.

Once Juncker had been nominated by the Council he started visiting all of the political groups of the European Parliament in order to explain his visions as well as gain their support in order to get appointed as Commission President. The purpose was also to show that he had understood some criticism levelled by Eurosceptics in Brussels. This was demonstrated when the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg told the ECR lawmakers that "[d]espite what you may read in the British press, I do not want a United States of Europe," as well as "I do not believe that Europe can be constructed against the nation state."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/juncker-tells-parliament-eurosceptics-he-no-federalist-303365|title=Juncker tells Parliament Eurosceptics he is no federalist|work=EurActiv - EU News & policy debates, across languages|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>

On 15 July, Juncker presented his political programme to the European Parliament in plenary. Following a debate, the MEPs appointed Juncker to the position of Commission President with 422 votes in favour, well over the 376 required, and 250 votes against.<ref>{{cite news|title=Parliament elects Jean-Claude Juncker as Commission President|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140714IPR52341/html/Parliament-elects-Jean-Claude-Juncker-as-Commission-President|access-date=15 July 2014|publisher=European Parliament|date=15 July 2014|ref=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140714IPR52341/html/Parliament-elects-Jean-Claude-Juncker-as-Commission-President}}</ref>

==Controversies==
In early November 2014, just days after becoming head of the Commission, Juncker was hit by media disclosures—derived from a document leak known as [[LuxLeaks]]—that Luxembourg under his premiership had turned into a major European centre of corporate [[tax avoidance]]. With the aid of the Luxembourg government, companies transferred tax liability for many billions of euros to Luxembourg, where the income was taxed at a fraction of 1%. Juncker, who in a speech in Brussels in July 2014 promised to "try to put some morality, some ethics, into the European tax landscape", was sharply criticised following the leaks.<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news |last1=Bowers |first1=Simon |title=Luxembourg tax files: how tiny state rubber-stamped tax avoidance on an industrial scale |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/05/-sp-luxembourg-tax-files-tax-avoidance-industrial-scale |access-date=12 December 2014 |work=The Guardian |date=5 November 2014}}</ref> A subsequent [[motion of censure]] in the European Parliament was brought against Juncker over his role in the tax avoidance schemes. The motion was defeated by a large majority.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Traynor |first1=Ian |title=Jean-Claude Juncker saved from censure over Luxembourg tax schemes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/27/meps-reject-censure-motion-jean-claude-juncker-luxembourg-tax-avoidance |access-date=3 March 2015 |work=The Guardian |date=27 November 2014}}</ref> During his tenure, Juncker also oversaw the 2014 opening of the [[Luxembourg Freeport]], which former German Member of European Parliament Wolf Klinz dubbed "fertile ground for money laundering and tax evasion".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Europe isn't ready to take hard line on terror financing|url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/Voices/2019/12/30/Europe-isnt-ready-to-take-hard-line-on-terror-financing/4211577715827/|access-date=2020-07-03|website=UPI|language=en}}</ref> In March 2015, Juncker called for the formation of a [[European army]], because "a common army among the Europeans would convey to Russia that we are serious about defending the values of the European Union".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sparrow |first1=Andrew |title=Jean-Claude Juncker calls for EU army |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/08/jean-claude-juncker-calls-for-eu-army-european-commission-miltary |access-date=8 May 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=8 March 2015}}</ref>

On 22 May 2015 at the [[EU summit]] in [[Riga]], Juncker, alongside EU President [[Donald Tusk]] and Latvian PM [[Laimdota Straujuma]], greeted EU leaders in a way unusual to diplomacy. For instance, he tried to convince Greek Prime Minister [[Alexis Tsipras]] to wear a tie by offering his own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/eu-commission-boss-jean-claude-juncker-tried-to-convince-greek-prime-minister-alexis-tsipras-to-wear-a-tie-2015-5|title=EU Commission boss Jean-Claude Juncker tried to convince the Greek Prime Minister to wear a tie|work=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=27 May 2015}}</ref> He also remarked on [[Karl-Heinz Lambertz]] being overweight and patted his belly.

In August 2016, Juncker received criticism over his remarks on immigration at the European Forum Alpbach in Austria. During his speech, Juncker, a supporter of [[Angela Merkel]]'s open door response to the [[European migrant crisis]], made news by telling the audience that "borders are the worst invention ever made by politicians".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/national-borders-are-the-worst-invention-ever-says-ec-chief-jean-claude-juncker-a7204006.html/|title=National borders are 'the worst invention ever', says EC chief Jean-Claude Juncker|work=Independent|access-date=22 August 2016}}</ref>

Upon hearing the news of Cuban dictator [[Fidel Castro]]'s death in December 2016, Juncker said, "With the death of Fidel Castro, the world has lost a man who was a hero for many."<ref>{{cite news |title=Czech, Slovak MEPs 'shocked' by EU comments on Castro |url=https://euobserver.com/institutional/136136 |work=EUobserver |date=5 December 2016}}</ref>

In January 2017, leaked diplomatic cables show Juncker, as Luxembourg's prime minister from 1995 until the end of 2013, blocked EU efforts to fight tax avoidance by multinational corporations. Luxembourg agreed to multinational businesses on an individualised deal basis, often at an effective rate of less than 1%.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/jean-claude-juncker-blocked-eu-curbs-on-tax-avoidance-cables-show Jean-Claude Juncker blocked EU curbs on tax avoidance, cables show] The Guardian News 1 January 2017</ref>

In July 2017, Juncker described the European Parliament as "ridiculous" after only a few dozen [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] came to attend a debate dedicated to evaluating [[Malta]]'s time holding the 6-month term rotating [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the Council of the EU]], accusing MEPs of showing a lack of respect for smaller EU countries.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/04/jean-claude-juncker-criticises-ridiculous-european-parliament|title=Jean-Claude Juncker criticises 'ridiculous' European parliament|last=Rankin|first=Jennifer|date=4 July 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=25 July 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Although rebuked for his remark by the [[President of the European Parliament|Parliament's president]], [[Antonio Tajani]], Juncker responded, "I will never again attend a meeting of this kind."<ref name=":1" /> [[Jaume Duch Guillot]], chief spokesman for the Parliament, later said on Twitter that Juncker "regretted" the incident and that Tajani considered the case closed.
