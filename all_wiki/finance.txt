'''Finance''' is a term for matters regarding the management, creation, and study of [[money]] and [[investment]]s.<ref name="Investopedia"/> Specifically, it deals with the questions of how and why an individual, [[company]] or [[government]] acquires the money needed{{snd}} called [[capital (finance)|capital]] in the company context{{snd}} and how they spend or invest that money. <ref name="freedictionary">[https://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/finance "Finance"] Farlex Financial Dictionary. 2012 </ref> Finance is then often split into the following major categories:  [[corporate finance]], [[personal finance]] and [[public finance]].<ref name="Investopedia"/>    

At the same time, and correspondingly, ''finance'' is about the overall "system"

{{snd}} i.e., the [[financial market]]s that allow the [[Money flow index|flow of money]], via investments and other [[financial instruments]],  between and within these areas; 
this "flow" is facilitated by the [[financial services]] sector.
A major focus within finance is thus [[investment management]]{{snd}} called [[money management]] for individuals, and [[asset management]] for institutions{{snd}} and finance then includes the associated activities of [[securities trading]] and [[stock broking]], [[investment bank]]ing, [[financial engineering]], and [[risk management]].  

Given its wide scope, finance is studied in several academic disciplines, and, correspondingly, there are several [[Outline_of_finance#Education|related professional qualifications]] that can lead to the field.

== History of Finance ==
Though its principles are much older, the field of finance's founding and progress coincides with the start and evolution of civilization at large. We see continuous reformation and innovation in Finance throughout history.

The earliest historical evidence is from the year 3000 BC We see that Banking originated in [[Babylonian empire]] where in Temples and palaces were used as safe places for the storage of valuables. Initially, the valuable that can be deposited was only grain, but later cattle and precious materials are also included. Almost during the same time period, in the Sumerian city Uruk in Mesopotamia trade was supported by lending. The usage of interest as well was found to be used. In Sumerian “interest” was mas, which also meant calf.  In Greece and Egypt the words used for interest (tokos and ms respectively) also meant “to give birth”. In these cultures interest indicates an increase in something. They seem to consider it from lenders point of view.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fergusson|first=Nial|title=The Ascent of Money|publisher=Penguin Books|location=United States}}</ref>

During the Reign of Hammurabi (1792-1750 BC) in Babylon (the capital city of Babylonia). The famous Code of Hammurabi includes laws governing banking operations. The Babylonians, were accustomed to charge interest at the rate of 20 per cent per annum.

In the Biblical world point of view within the Jewish Civilisation (1500 BC), Jews were not allowed to take interest from other Jews, but they were allowed to take interest from the gentiles, as we see in the scriptures writings such as:

"If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor, you shall not be him as a creditor, and you shall not exact interest from him. (Exodus:20)

You shall not lend upon interest to your brother, interest on money, interest on victuals [foodstuff] interest on anything that is lent for interest. 20To a foreigner you may lend upon interest, but to your brother you shall not lend upon interest…” (Deu:23).

The reason for the non-prohibition of the receipt by a Jew of interest from a Gentile, and vice versa, is held by modern rabbis to lay in the fact that the Gentiles had at that time no law forbidding them to practice usury; and that as they took interest from Jews, the Torah considered it equitable that Jews should take interest from Gentiles. In Hebrew, interest is neshek.

In contrast to other ancient civilizations “interest is considered from borrowers point of view.

By 1200 BC Cowrie shell is used as “money” in China.

Abd by 640 BC, the Lydians started to use coin money. Lydia was the first place where permanent retail shops opened. (Herodotus mentions the use of crude coins in Lydia in an earlier date, i.e. 687 BC.)

600 BC: Pythius became identified as the first banker that had records. He was operating both in Western Anatolia and in Greece.

The arrival of coin usage as a means of representing money was represented in the years between (600-570 BC) (1) Chinese started to use coins made of base metal. The cities under the Greek empire such as Aegina (595 B.C.), Athens (575 B.C.) and Corinth (570 B.C.) started to mint their own coins.

Leading thinkers and statesmen, such as Marcus Pocius Cato Censorius [Cato the Elder] (234 BC-149 BC) and Marcus Pocius Cato Uicensis [Cato the Younger] (95 BC-46 BC) as well as Marcus Tallius Cicero (106 BC-43 BC), Lucius Annaeus Seneca (4 BC-AD 65) and Masterius Plutarch (46 AD-120 AD)  were against usury. In Republican Rome (340 BC) interest was outlawed altogether (Lex Genucia reforms). Under the banner of Julius Caesar, a ceiling on interest rates of 12% was set, and later under Justinian, it was lowered even further to between 4% and 8%.

The core of finance in history was more focused on the banking system, the field of finance was narrow. It took almost 2500 years to develop a system of interest, mint coins, bring in theories of interest and inflation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Thorton|first=Mike|title=History of Money:Financial History,From Barter to Bitcoin|year=2016|pages=Chapters 1-5}}</ref> [https://jpm.pm-research.com/content/25/4/95][https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2017/09/13/finance-is-a-technology/]

==The financial system==
{{Main|Financial services|financial market|Circular flow of income}}
As above, the financial system constitutes the flow of capital, between individuals ([[personal finance]]), governments ([[public finance]]), and businesses ([[corporate finance]]). 
Although they are closely related, the disciplines of economics and finance are distinct. The "economy" is a social institution that organizes a society's production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, all of which must be financed.

Generalizing, an entity whose income exceeds its [[Expense|expenditure]] can lend or invest the excess, intending to earn a fair return. Correspondingly, an entity where income is less than expenditure can raise capital usually in one of two ways: 
(i) by borrowing, in the form of a loan (private individuals), or by selling bonds (may be government bonds or corporate bonds); 
(ii) by a corporate selling [[Equity (finance)|equity]], also called stock or shares (may take various forms: [[preferred stock]] or [[common stock]]). 
The owners of both bonds and stock may be ''[[institutional investor]]s''{{snd}} financial institutions such as investment banks and [[pension fund]] – or private individuals, called ''[[private investors]]'' or ''retail investors''.

The [[lender|lending]] is often indirect, through a [[financial intermediary]] such as a [[bank]], or via the purchase of notes or bonds ([[corporate bonds]], [[Government bond|government bonds]], or mutual bonds) in the [[bond market]]. 
The lender receives interest, the [[Debtor|borrower]] pays a higher interest than the lender receives, and the financial intermediary earns the difference for arranging the loan.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Financial system|url=https://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/financial-stability/the-financial-system-in-brief/|last= [[Bank of Finland]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Introducing the Financial System {{!}} Boundless Economics|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-economics/chapter/introducing-the-financial-system/|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=What is the financial system?|url=https://www.ecnmy.org/learn/your-money/banking-and-finance/what-is-the-financial-system/|website=Economy}}</ref>
A bank aggregates the activities of many borrowers and lenders. A bank accepts deposits from lenders, on which it pays interest. The bank then lends these deposits to borrowers. Banks allow borrowers and lenders, of different sizes, to coordinate their activity.

Investing typically entails the purchase of [[equity (finance)|stock]], either individual securities, or via a [[mutual fund]] for example.
Stocks are usually sold by corporations to investors so as to raise required capital in the form of "[[equity financing]]", as distinct from the ''debt financing'' described above.
The financial intermediaries here are the [[investment bank]]s, which find the initial investors and facilitate the listing of the securities (equity and debt); and the [[securities exchange]]s, which allow their trade thereafter, as well as the various service providers which manage the performance or risk of these investments.

==Areas of finance==
===Personal finance===
{{Main|Personal finance}}
Personal finance<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/personal-finance/|title=Personal Finance - Definition, Overview, Guide to Financial Planning|website=Corporate Finance Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref> is defined as "the mindful planning of monetary spending and saving, while also considering the possibility of future risk". Personal finance may involve paying for education, financing [[durable good]]s such as [[real estate]] and cars, buying [[insurance]], e.g. health and property insurance, investing and saving for [[retirement]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DF7FCQAAQBAJ|title=Finance (Speedy Study Guides)|last=Publishing|first=Speedy|date=2015-05-25|publisher=Speedy Publishing LLC|isbn=978-1-68185-667-4|language=en}}</ref>
Personal finance may also involve paying for a loan, or debt obligations. 
The main areas of personal finance are considered to be income, spending, saving, investing, and protection.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Personal Finance - Definition, Overview, Guide to Financial Planning|url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/personal-finance/|website=Corporate Finance Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref> 
The following steps, as outlined by the Financial Planning Standards Board,<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Financial Planning Standards Board|date=2019|pages=709–735|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781119642497.ch80|isbn=9781119642497|title=Financial Planning Competency Handbook|editor1-last=Snowdon|editor1-first=Michael}}</ref> suggest that an individual will understand a potentially secure personal finance plan after:
* Purchasing insurance to ensure protection against unforeseen personal events
* Understanding the effects of tax policies (tax subsidies or penalties) management of personal finances
* Understanding the effects of credit on individual financial standing
* Developing of a savings plan or financing for large purchases (auto, education, home)
* Planning a secure financial future in an environment of economic instability
* Pursuing a checking and/or a savings account
* Preparing for retirement/ long term expenses<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personalfinance.asp|title=Personal Finance|last=Kenton|first=Will|website=Investopedia|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>
<!-- 
The six key areas of personal financial planning, as suggested by the Financial Planning Standards Board, are:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fpsb.org/component/docman/doc_download/1008-financial-planning-curriculum-framework.html|title=Financial Planning Curriculum Framework|year=2011|publisher=Financial Planning Standards Board|accessdate=7 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201154331/http://www.fpsb.org/component/docman/doc_download/1008-financial-planning-curriculum-framework.html|archive-date=1 February 2012}}</ref>
# '''Financial position''': is concerned with understanding the personal resources available by examining net worth and household cash flows.  Net worth is a person's balance sheet, calculated by adding up all assets under that person's control, minus all liabilities of the household, at one point in time.  Household cash flows total up all from the expected sources of income within a year, minus all expected expenses within the same year.  From this analysis, the financial planner can determine to what degree and in what time the personal goals can be accomplished. Ratios are frequently used on the corporate level to measure a company's ability to cover its cost given the assets it has on hand. This can be paralleled to an individual level as well. Maintaining a ratio of 2:1 or greater is seen as healthy in this respect.<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/university/ratios/liquidity-measurement/ratio1.asp</ref> This means that for every dollar of expenses there is an existing dollar value of assets such as cash to cover that cost.
# '''[[Insurance|Adequate protection]]''': the analysis of how to protect a household from unforeseen risks.  These risks can be divided into the following: liability, property, death, disability, health and long term care.  Some of these risks may be self-insurable, while most will require the purchase of an insurance contract.  Determining how much insurance to get, at the most cost-effective terms requires knowledge of the market for personal insurance.  Business owners, professionals, athletes, and entertainers require specialized insurance professionals to adequately protect themselves.  Since insurance also enjoys some tax benefits, utilizing insurance investment products may be a critical piece of the overall investment planning.                     
# '''[[Tax planning]]''': typically the income tax is the single largest expense in a household.  Managing taxes is not a question of if a person will pay taxes, but when and how much.  Governments give many incentives in the form of tax deductions and credits, which can be used to reduce the lifetime tax burden.  Most modern governments use a progressive tax.  Typically, as one's income grows, a higher [[Tax rate#Marginal|marginal rate of tax]] must be paid. Understanding how to take advantage of the myriad tax breaks when planning one's personal finances can make a significant impact, which can save money in the long term.
# '''Investment and accumulation goals''': planning how to accumulate enough money – for large purchases and life events – is what most people consider to be financial planning.  Major reasons to accumulate assets include purchasing a house or car, starting a business, paying for education expenses, and saving for retirement. Achieving these goals requires projecting what they will cost, and when it's needed to withdraw funds that will be necessary to be able to achieve these goals.  A major risk to the household in achieving their accumulation goal is the rate of price increases over time, or [[inflation]].  Using net present value calculators, the financial planner will suggest a combination of asset earmarking and regular savings to be invested in a variety of investments.  In order to overcome the rate of inflation, the investment portfolio has to get a higher rate of return, which typically will subject the portfolio to a number of risks.  Managing these portfolio risks is most often accomplished using asset allocation, which seeks to diversify investment risk and opportunity.  This asset allocation will prescribe a percentage allocation to be invested in stocks (either preferred stock or common stock), bonds (for example mutual bonds or government bonds, or corporate bonds), cash and alternative investments.  The allocation should also take into consideration the personal risk profile of every investor, since risk attitudes vary from person to person.
# '''Retirement planning''' is the process of understanding how much it costs to live at retirement, and coming up with a plan to distribute assets to meet any income shortfall. Methods for retirement plans include taking advantage of government allowed structures to manage tax liability including: individual ([[Individual retirement account|IRA]]) structures, or employer sponsored [[retirement plans]], annuities and life insurance products. Oftentimes this field of personal finance is overlooked as many individuals see this being something in their distant future. However, the sooner a person starts [[investing]] the greater likelihood the person have for actually being prepared. Accrual compounding from the prime "work years" can create a significant impact down the road as these earlier donation years will have more time to compound on themselves giving the individual more wiggle room in their future for unexpected unforeseen events. With every additional year of missed contributions, this creates more tension on the individual to contribute a greater sum leading up to the maturity date of what they may have always thought would be their [[retirement]] age. In the same respect an individual who is able to attain a healthy amount of wealth at a young age may then be able to invest it into a [[mutual fund]] or [[stock]]s accordingly depending on how much they believe they will need to maintain their [[standard of living]] once retirement arrives. Allocating a portfolio according to the goals is crucial and also needs to be continuously adjusted as personal needs and desires change. Oftentimes, individuals will allocate 80% of their earnings into stocks while there is still room for error (more time away from retirement) with only 20% being distributed to mutual funds as these are considered more 'steady' streams of investment. As an individual begins to get closer to their retirement, oftentimes they will gradually adjust these allocations to have a greater percentage in their mutual fund section to solidify their gains and only leave 20% to still generate higher returns. This allocation is commonly recommended by financial planners as it allows the individual to build capital in their work years and keep their gains safe in the long run, leaving less room for volatility.<ref>https://www.thestreet.com/investing/bonds-vs-stocks-14656707</ref>
# '''[[Estate planning]]''' involves planning for the disposition of one's assets after death.  Typically, there is a tax due to the state or federal government at one's death.  Avoiding these taxes means that more of one's assets will be distributed to one's heirs.  One can leave one's assets to family, friends or charitable groups.

===Corporate finance===
{{Main|Corporate finance}}
Corporate finance deals with the sources of funding and the [[capital structure]] of corporations, the actions that managers take to increase the value of the firm to the shareholders, and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources.  
'''Short term''' [[financial management]] is often termed "[[working capital management]]", and relates to [[cash management|cash-]], [[inventory]]- and [[debtor]]s management.
In the '''longer term''', corporate finance generally involves balancing risk and profitability, while attempting to maximize an entity's assets, net incoming cash flow and the value of its [[stock]], and generically entails three primary areas of capital resource allocation: (i) "capital budgeting", selecting which projects to invest in; 
(ii) [[dividend policy]], the use of "excess" capital; 
and (iii) "sources of capital", i.e. which funding is to be used.
The latter creates the link with [[investment banking]] and [[securities trading]], in that the capital raised will (generically) comprise debt, i.e. [[corporate bond]]s, and [[Equity (finance)|equity]], often [[stock (finance)|listed shares]].
<!-- *In the first, "capital budgeting", management must choose which "projects" (if any) to undertake. The discipline of [[capital budgeting]] may employ standard [[business valuation]] techniques or even extend to [[real options valuation]]; see [[Financial modeling#Accounting|Financial modeling]].  
*The second, "sources of capital" relates to how these investments are to be funded: investment capital can be provided through different sources, such as by shareholders, in the form of [[Equity (finance)|equity]] (privately or via an [[initial public offering]]), [[creditor]]s, often in the form of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and the firm's operations ([[cash flow]]). Short-term funding or [[working capital]] is mostly provided by banks extending a line of credit. The balance between these elements forms the company's [[capital structure]].  
*The third, "the [[dividend policy]]", requires management to determine whether any unappropriated profit (excess cash) is to be retained for future investment / operational requirements, or instead to be distributed to shareholders, and if so, in what form. -->  
<!-- Corporate finance also includes within its scope business valuation, stock investing, or [[investment management]]. An investment is an acquisition of an [[asset]] in the hope that it will maintain or increase its value over time that will in hope give back a higher rate of return when it comes to disbursing dividends. In [[List of finance topics#Investment management|investment management]]{{spaced ndash}} in choosing a [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]]{{spaced ndash}} one has to use financial analysis to determine ''what'', ''how much'' and ''when'' to invest. To do this, a company must:
* Identify relevant objectives and constraints: institution or individual goals, time horizon, risk aversion and tax considerations;
* Identify the appropriate strategy: active versus passive hedging strategy
* Measure the portfolio performance -->

Although "corporate finance" is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms, rather than corporations alone, the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms.  
Further, although financial management overlaps with the financial function of the [[accounting profession]], [[financial accounting]] is the reporting of historical financial information, whereas as discussed, financial management is concerned with increasing the firm's [[Shareholder]] value and increasing their rate of return on the investment.
[[Financial risk management]], in this context, is about protecting the firm's [[economic value]] using [[financial instrument]]s to manage exposure to [[financial risk|risk]], particularly [[credit risk]] and [[market risk]], often arising from the firm's funding structures.  <!--  (Other risk types include [[Foreign exchange risk|foreign exchange]], shape, [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]], sector, [[Liquidity risk|liquidity]], [[inflation]] risks, etc.)  It focuses on when and how to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] using financial instruments; in this sense it overlaps with [[financial engineering]].  Similar to general [[risk management]], financial risk management requires identifying its sources, measuring it (see: [[Risk measure#Examples]]), and formulating plans to address these, and can be qualitative and quantitative. In the banking sector worldwide, the [[Basel Accords]] are generally adopted by internationally active banks for tracking, reporting and exposing operational, credit and market risks.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs179.htm|title=The Basel Committee's response to the financial crisis: report to the G20|date=2010-10-19|website=www.bis.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref>-->
<!--  
====Capital====
{{Main|Financial capital}}

[[Capital (economics)|Capital]], in the financial sense, is the money that gives the business the power to buy goods to be used in the production of other goods or the offering of a service.
(Capital has two types of sources, [[Equity (finance)|equity]], and [[debt]]).

The deployment of capital is decided by the budget. This may include the objective of business, targets set, and results in financial terms, e.g., the target set for sale, resulting cost, growth, required investment to achieve the planned sales, and financing source for the investment.

A budget may be long term or short term. Long term budgets have a time horizon of 5–10&nbsp; years giving a vision to the company; short term is an annual budget which is drawn to control and operate in that particular year.

Budgets will include proposed fixed asset requirements and how these expenditures will be financed. Capital budgets are often adjusted annually (done every year) and should be part of a longer-term Capital Improvements Plan.

A [[cash flow forecast|cash budget]] is also required. --><!--  The working capital requirements of a business are monitored at all times to ensure that there are sufficient funds available to meet short-term expenses.

The cash budget is basically a detailed plan that shows all expected sources and uses of cash when it comes to spending it appropriately. The cash budget has the following six main sections:

# '''Beginning cash balance''' – contains the last period's closing cash balance, in other words, the remaining cash of the last year.
# '''Cash collections''' – includes all expected cash receipts (all sources of cash for the period considered, mainly sales)
# '''Cash disbursements''' – lists all planned cash outflows for the period such as dividends, excluding interest payments on short-term loans, which appear in the financing section. All expenses that do not affect cash flow are excluded from this list (e.g. depreciation, amortization, etc.)
# '''Cash excess or deficiency''' – a function of the cash needs and cash available. Cash needs are determined by the total cash disbursements plus the minimum cash balance required by company policy. If the total cash available is less than cash needs, a deficiency exists.
# '''Financing''' – discloses the planned borrowings and repayments of those planned borrowings, including interest.-->

===Public finance===
{{Main|Public finance}}
Public finance describes finance as related to sovereign states and sub-national entities (states/provinces, counties, municipalities, etc.) and related public entities (e.g. school districts) or agencies. It usually encompasses a long-term strategic perspective regarding investment decisions that affect public entities.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Doss|first1=Daniel|last2=Sumrall|first2=William|last3=Jones|first3=Don|title=Strategic Finance for Criminal Justice Organizations|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1439892237|page=23|edition=1st}}</ref>  These long-term strategic periods usually encompass five or more years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Doss|first1=Daniel|last2=Sumrall|first2=William|last3=Jones|first3=Don|title=Strategic Finance for Criminal Justice Organizations|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1439892237|pages=53–54|edition=1st}}</ref>  Public finance is primarily concerned with:
* Identification of required expenditure of a public sector entity
* Source(s) of that entity's revenue
* The budgeting process
* Debt issuance ([[municipal bond]]s) for public works projects

Central banks, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]] banks in the [[United States]] and [[Bank of England]] in the [[United Kingdom]], are strong players in public finance, acting as [[lender of last resort|lenders of last resort]] as well as strong influences on monetary and credit conditions in the economy.<ref>Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System of the United States. Mission of the Federal Reserve System. [http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/mission.htm Federalreserve.gov] Accessed: 2010-01-16. (Archived by WebCite at  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114154328/http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/mission.htm |date=2010-01-14 }})</ref>

==Financial theory==
Finance theory is studied and developed within the disciplines of [[Management#Training|management]], [[financial economics |(financial)]] [[economics]], [[accountancy]] and [[applied mathematics]].
Abstractly,<ref name="freedictionary"/> ''finance'' is concerned with the investment and deployment of [[asset]]s and [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] over "space and time": 
i.e. it is about performing [[valuation (finance)|valuation]] and [[asset allocation]] today, 
based on risk and uncertainty of future outcomes, 
incorporating the [[time value of money]] (determining the [[present value]] of these future values, "discounting", requires a [[required rate of return|risk-appropriate discount rate]]).
<!-- Participants in the  [[market (economics)|market]] aim to price assets based on their risk level, fundamental value, and their expected [[rate of return]]. 
The core finance theories can be divided between the following categories: [[financial economics]], [[mathematical finance]] and [[Valuation (finance)|valuation theory]].  
-->
Since the debate to whether finance is an art or a science is still open,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Is finance an art or a science?|url = http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/financeartorscience.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-11|language = en-US}}</ref> there have been recent efforts to organize a [[list of unsolved problems in finance]].

===Financial economics===
{{Main|Financial economics}}
Financial economics is the branch of [[economics]] studying the interrelation of financial [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], such as [[price]]s, [[interest rate]]s and shares, as opposed to [[goods and services]]. Financial economics concentrates on influences of [[Real vs. nominal in economics|real]] economic variables on financial ones, in contrast to pure finance.  It centres on pricing and managing risk management in the [[financial market]]s, and thus produces many of the and [[financial model]]s commonly employed.

The discipline essentially explores how [[homo economicus|rational investors]] would apply risk and return to the problem of [[investment]].  The twin assumptions of [[rational pricing|rationality]] and [[efficient-market hypothesis|market efficiency]] lead to [[modern portfolio theory]] (the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]]), and to the [[Black–Scholes model|Black–Scholes]] theory for [[Valuation of options|option valuation]]; it further studies phenomena and models where these assumptions do not hold, or are extended.

"Financial economics", also considers investment under "[[certainty]]" ([[Fisher separation theorem]], [[The Theory of Investment Value|"theory of investment value"]], [[Modigliani–Miller theorem]]) and hence also contributes to corporate finance theory.
[[Financial econometrics]] is the branch of financial economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterize the relationships suggested.

===Financial mathematics===
{{Main|Financial mathematics}}
Financial mathematics is a field of [[applied mathematics]], concerned with [[financial market]]s. The subject has a close relationship with the discipline of [[financial economics]], which is concerned with much of the underlying theory that is involved in financial mathematics.  Generally, [[mathematical finance]] will derive, and extend, the [[Mathematical model|mathematical]] or [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] models suggested by financial economics. 

The field is largely focused on the modelling of [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], although other important subfields include [[actuarial science|insurance mathematics]] and quantitative [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio problems]]. 
See [[Outline of finance #Mathematical tools]] and [[Outline of finance #Derivatives pricing]].

In terms of practice, mathematical finance also overlaps heavily with the field of [[computational finance]] (also known as ''[[financial engineering]]''). Arguably, these are largely synonymous, although the latter focuses on application, while the former focuses on modeling and derivation (''see: [[Quantitative analyst]]'').  There is also a significant overlap with [[financial risk management]].

===Experimental finance===
{{Main|Experimental finance}}

[[Experimental finance]] aims to establish different market settings and environments to observe experimentally and provide a lens through which science can analyze agents' behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows, information diffusion, and aggregation, price setting mechanisms, and returns processes. Researchers in experimental finance can study to what extent existing financial economics theory makes valid predictions and therefore prove them, and attempt to discover new principles on which such theory can be extended and be applied to future financial decisions. Research may proceed by conducting trading simulations or by establishing and studying the behavior, and the way that these people act or react, of people in artificial competitive market-like settings.

===Behavioral finance===
{{Main|Behavioral economics}}

[[Behavioral finance]] studies how the ''[[psychology]]'' of investors or managers affects financial decisions and markets when making a decision that can impact either negatively or positively on one of their areas. Behavioral finance has grown over the last few decades to become central and very important to finance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shefrin|first1=Hersh|title=Beyond greed and fear: Understanding behavioral finance and the psychology of investing|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195304213|page=ix|url=https://archive.org/details/beyondgreedfearu00shef|url-access=registration|quote=growth of behavioral finance.|accessdate=8 May 2017}}</ref>

Behavioral finance includes such topics as:
# Empirical studies that demonstrate significant deviations from classical theories.
# Models of how psychology affects and impacts trading and prices
# Forecasting based on these methods.
# Studies of experimental asset markets and the use of models to forecast experiments.

A strand of behavioral finance has been dubbed [[quantitative behavioral finance]], which uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biases in conjunction with valuation. <!-- Some of these endeavors has been led by [[Gunduz Caginalp]] (Professor of Mathematics and Editor of [[Journal of Behavioral Finance]] during 2001–2004) and collaborators including [[Vernon L. Smith|Vernon Smith]] (2002 Nobel Laureate in Economics), David Porter, Don Balenovich, Vladimira Ilieva, Ahmet Duran). Studies by Jeff Madura, Ray Sturm, and others have demonstrated significant behavioral effects in stocks and exchange traded funds. Among other topics, quantitative behavioral finance studies behavioral effects together with the non-classical assumption of the finiteness of assets. -->

===Intangible asset finance===
{{Main|Intangible asset finance}}

Intangible asset finance is the area of finance that deals with intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, goodwill, reputation, etc.

Intangible assets are divided into indefinite or definite. The brand name of a company is an indefinite asset; it stays with the company throughout its existence. A patent, however, granted to that company for a limited amount of time would be a definite intangible asset.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intangibleasset.asp|title=Intangible Asset Definition {{!}} Investopedia|last=root|date=2003-11-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-27}}</ref>
