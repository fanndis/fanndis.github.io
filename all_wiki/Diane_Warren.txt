'''Diane Eve Warren''' (born September 7, 1956)<ref name="mtv"/><ref name="allmusic"/> is an American [[songwriter]], [[musician]] and [[record producer]]. She rose to prominence in 1983, and has since written songs for and co-written songs with multiple singers, as well as for several films.

Warren has written nine number-one songs and 32 top 10 songs on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. Additionally, two of the top 13 hits in the Hot 100's 57-year history were composed by her. 
Warren's career was jump-started with the success in 1985 of Rhythm of the Night by [[Debarge]] and catapulted in the late 1980s shortly after joining forces with the UK music company EMI when Warren became the first songwriter in the history of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine to have seven hits, all by different artists, on the singles chart at the same time prompting the UK's former Chairman of EMI Music Publishing Peter Reichardt to credit her as "the most important songwriter in the world". She has been rated the third most successful female artist in the UK.

Warren has won a [[Grammy Award]], an [[Emmy Award]], a [[Golden Globe Award]], three consecutive [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]] for Songwriter of the Year, and has been nominated for eleven [[Academy Awards]]. She has been inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Her UK success saw her win an [[Ivor Novello Award]] from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors]] when she received the Special International Award in 2008. Warren owns a publishing company, Realsongs, which gives her control over her compositions.

She has stated that therapy helped her with songwriting.<ref name="DailyRecord-Glasgow" /> She has also revealed that she works 12â€“16 hours a day, always takes her keyboard whenever she travels<ref name="AmericanSongwriter-2007">{{cite news|last=Atkinson|first=Brian T.|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2007/01/diane-warren-real-songs-for-real-people/|title=DIANE WARREN: Real Songs for Real People|date=January 1, 2007|publisher=Americansongwriter.com|access-date=January 5, 2013}}</ref> and is "...more crazy and intense than I was at 20..." <ref name="ABCNews-Primetime" />

Warren does not usually allow anyone into her Hollywood Hills office<ref name="DailyRecord-Glasgow" /> which she describes as a "cluttered, airless room â€¦ nothing has been moved or cleaned for 17 years because she is superstitious" and prefers to think of that room as her "secret world".<ref name="ABCNews-Primetime" /> In that room, Warren records melodies with a tape recorder on which she plays them again and chooses the songs she likes the most.<ref name="ABCNews-Primetime" /> But in a 2016 interview with ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]'' correspondent, [[Ben Tracy]], she allowed part of the interview to be taped in the office.<ref name="CBSSunday-Morning">{{cite news|last=Tracy|first=Brian |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-tenacious-diane-warren-and-lady-gaga/|title=The Tenacious Diane Warren and Lady Gaga|website=CBSnews.com |date=February 14, 2016 |access-date=February 26, 2016}}</ref>
