Retrieved December 26, 2017.</ref>

Mayer attended two non-denominational secondary schools: [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Fieldston]], in the southwest area of the [[Bronx]] borough of New York City; and—as an exchange student in 1972-1973—[[Bedales]], a boarding school in the village of [[Steep, Hampshire]], England.

A 1977 ''[[magna cum laude]]'' graduate of [[Yale University]], she was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] and served as senior editor of the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' and as campus [[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. She continued her studies at [[Oxford University]].<ref name=NewYorkerBio/>

==Career==
Mayer began her career as a journalist in [[Vermont]] writing for two small weekly papers, ''The Weathersfield Weekly'' and ''The Black River Tribune'', before moving to the daily ''[[Rutland Herald]]''. She worked as a metropolitan reporter for the now-defunct ''[[Washington Star]]'', and in 1982 joined ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', where she worked for 12 years. She was the first woman at the ''WSJ'' to be named [[White House]] [[White House press corps|correspondent]], and subsequently, senior writer and front page editor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasbookfestival.org/Author_Page.php?aid=397|title=2017 Author Page - Texas Book Festival|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref>

She served as a [[war correspondent]] and [[foreign correspondent]] for the ''Journal'', where she reported on the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|bombing of the American barracks]] in [[Beirut]], the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], and the last days of [[Communism]] in the former [[Soviet Union]].  Mayer also contributes to the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and the ''[[American Prospect]].''

Mayer has co-authored two books: ''Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas'' (1994)<ref>''Strange Justice'' was excerpted in ''The Wall Street Journal'', was the subject of an hour-long edition of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''Turning Point'', and subsequent appearances on [[Ted Koppel]]'s ''Nightline'' and [[Larry King]] Live.[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/strange-justice-by-jane-mayer-and-jill-abramson/]</ref> (co-authored with [[Jill Abramson]]), a study of the nomination and appointment of [[Clarence Thomas]] to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]; and ''Landslide: The Unmaking of the President, 1984–1988'' (1989; co-authored with [[Doyle McManus]]), an account of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s second term in the [[White House]]. ''Strange Justice'' was adapted as a 1999 [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] [[television movie]] of the same name, starring [[Delroy Lindo]], [[Mandy Patinkin]], and [[Regina Taylor]]. ''Strange Justice'' was a finalist for the 1994 [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]],<ref>{{Cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=Study of Death Wins a National Book Award|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 17, 1994|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE7DF1331F934A25752C1A962958260}}</ref> and both books were finalists for the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/page_2|title=National Book Critics Circle:  awards|website=bookcritics.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://opa.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?id=2511 "Yale Journalism Initiative to Offer Seminar with New York Times Managing Editor"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725190012/http://opa.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?id=2511 |date=2010-07-25 }}, Yale University Office of Public Affairs, October 24, 2006.</ref>

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine said of ''Strange Justice'': "Its portrait of Thomas as an id suffering in the role of a Republican [[superego]] is more detailed and convincing than anything that has appeared so far."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lacayo|first=Richard|title=The Unheard Witnesses|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=November 14, 1994|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981809,00.html}}</ref> Of ''Landslide'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' Washington correspondent [[Steven V.

In an ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine interview, Mayer said about her next article, “I’m focusing broadly on stories about abuses of power, threats to democracy, and corruption.”<ref>{{cite web |last1=Langmuir |first1=Molly |title=What's Next For New Yorker Reporter Jane Mayer? |url=https://www.elle.com/culture/a26537529/jane-mayer-new-yorker-interview-kavanaugh/ |website=Elle.com |accessdate= 8 April 2019}}</ref>

===''The Dark Side''===
Mayer's third nonfiction book, ''[[The Dark Side (book)|The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals]]'' (2008), addresses the origins, legal justifications, and possible war crimes liability of the use of [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] (commonly considered torture) on detainees and the subsequent deaths of detainees, sometimes victims of mistaken identity, under such interrogation by the [[CIA]] and [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]]. The roles of [[Dick Cheney]] and attorneys [[David Addington]] and [[John Yoo]] in providing cover for the grisly procedures were prominent. The book was a finalist for the [[National Book Awards]].<ref>[[National Book Foundation]], [http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2008_nf_mayer.html 2008 National Book Award Finalist, Nonfiction]</ref>

In her ''[[New York Times]]'' review of ''The Dark Side'', Jennifer Schuessler described the book as "the most vivid and comprehensive account we have so far of how a government founded on checks and balances and respect for individual rights could have been turned against those ideals."<ref>{{Cite news|first=Schuessler|last=Jennifer|title=A History of Abuse in the War on Terror|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 22, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/books/22schuessler.html}}</ref> The ''Times'' subsequently named ''The Dark Side'' one of its [[New York Times Book Review|ten most notable books of the year]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/books/review/100Notable-t.html?pagewanted=all "100 Notable Books of 2008"], ''The New York Times'', November 26, 2008.</ref>

Military and diplomatic historian, Colonel [[Andrew J. Bacevich]], reviewing the book in ''The Washington Post'', wrote: "[Mayer's] achievement lies less in bringing new revelations to light than in weaving into a comprehensive narrative a story revealed elsewhere in bits and pieces."<ref>[[Andrew J. Bacevich]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/10/AR2008071002373.html?tid=informbox Collateral Damage], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', July 10, 2008; accessed July 13, 2008.</ref> ''Washington Post'' reporter [[Joby Warrick]] reported that Mayer's book revealed that a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) analyst warned the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] that "up to a third of the detainees at [[Guantanamo Bay]] may have been imprisoned by mistake." The administration ignored the warning and insisted that all were [[enemy combatants]].<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/11/AR2008071102954.html?hpid=moreheadlines Joby Warrick, "A Blind Eye to Guantanamo?"],  ''[[The Washington Post]]'', July 11, 2008; accessed July 12, 2008.</ref>

In a story appearing the same day in ''The New York Times'', reporter [[Scott Shane]] reported Mayer's book as disclosing [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] officials had concluded in a secret report in 2007: "the Central Intelligence Agency's interrogation methods for high-level Qaeda prisoners constituted torture and could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes."<ref>Scott Shane, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/washington/11detain.html Book Cites Secret Red Cross Report of C.I.A. Torture of Qaeda Captives], ''The New York Times'' (July 11, 2008).</ref> Mayer said of her book: "I see myself more as a reporter than as an advocate."<ref>[http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/27289 "Writer Talks Torture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130093009/http://yaledailynews.com/articles/view/27289 |date=2009-01-30 }}, ''The Yale Daily News'', January 27, 2009; accessed August 30, 2013.</ref>

===Civil liberties===
Mayer covered the [[Obama administration]]'s prosecution of whistleblowers with an article about former [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) official [[Thomas Andrews Drake|Thomas Drake]]. Despite Obama's campaign promises of transparency, Mayer wrote, his administration "has pursued leak prosecutions with a surprising relentlessness."<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/05/23/110523fa_fact_mayer Jane Mayer, "The Secret Sharer"], "The New Yorker", May 23, 2011.</ref> She won the [[Polk Award]] for the article, and the judges said her article helped expose "prosecutorial excess" and "helped lead to all major charges against Drake being dropped."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/20/nyregion/anthony-shadid-times-correspondent-posthumously-honored.html?_r=3 James Barron, "Posthumous Polk Award for Times Correspondent"], ''The New York Times'', February 19, 2012.</ref>

===Drones===
In 2009, Mayer covered the Obama administration's use of drones. "The number of drone strikes has risen dramatically since Obama became President", she wrote. Her article described errors, ethical concerns, and potential unintended consequences in the increased use of drone strikes.<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/10/26/091026fa_fact_mayer#ixzz2NWZuvk2y Jane Mayer, "The Predator War"], "The New Yorker", October 26, 2009.</ref>

===Money in politics===
For many years, Mayer has written about money in politics, covering and criticizing both liberals and conservatives. In 1997, she wrote an article about "dubious [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] fundraising tactics leading to the 1996 election." The article described how the Clinton campaign "marketed the prestige and glamour of the Presidency as never before."<ref>Jane Mayer.[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1997/02/03/1997_02_03_032_TNY_CARDS_000377145 "Inside the Money Machine"], "The New Yorker", February 3, 1997.</ref>

In 2004, she wrote an article on [[George Soros]] and other activist billionaires who sought "to use their fortunes to engineer the defeat of President George W. Bush in the 2004 election." The article described Soros's "extreme measures" and how his "outsized financial role in the election" had "stirred alarm".<ref>Jane Mayer.

In 2010, Mayer published an article about the [[political activities of the Koch brothers]], describing their "war against Obama" and funding of the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] and nonprofit organizations that sought to block liberal policy proposals and defeat Democratic candidates.<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all Jane Mayer, "Covert Operations"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', August 30, 2010.</ref> The article was a finalist for the 2011 [[National Magazine Awards]].<ref>[[National Magazine Awards]], [http://www.magazine.org/asme/about-asme/pressroom/asme-press-releases/national-magazine-awards-2011-finalists-announced]</ref>

In 2011, Mayer reported on retail sales millionaire [[Art Pope]]'s dominant spending in [[North Carolina]] politics. It documented his extraordinarily successful efforts as a [[Koch brothers]] ally, who held seats on the boards of their [[Americans for Prosperity]] and [[Citizens for a Sound Economy]] organizations, to target both Democrats and moderate Republican state legislators and it predicted the redistricting-generated loss of Democratic congressional delegation seats.<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_mayer Jane Mayer, "State for Sale"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', October 10, 2011.</ref> Her article won a Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting, and the judges called it "the kind of journalism that strengthens democracy and shows the value of a free press."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newhouse.syr.edu/Newsroom/read_news.cfm?id=733|title=Newsroom - Newhouse School - Syracuse University|website=Newhouse School|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref> [[Mark Bauerlein]], writing in the ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', was critical of the piece, saying the article was "a tendentious, poorly-researched, and weakly argued bit of journalism" and that "Pope never gets a fair shake."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/jame-mayers-poor-journalism/40106|author=[[Mark Bauerlein]]|title=Jane Mayer's Poor Journalism|newspaper=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=October 9, 2011|accessdate=December 29, 2012}}</ref> In response to criticism, Mayer supplemented her article with a blog entry pointing out that, despite Pope's claims that he was "not an heir", his "political career was launched" by more than $300,000 from his parents.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/10/art-pope-heir.html|author=Jane Mayer|title=Art Pope and Individualism|magazine=The New Yorker|date=October 10, 2011|accessdate=February 20, 2012}}</ref>

In 2012, Mayer wrote an article about President Obama's efforts to raise money from liberal billionaires, and the decision of his campaign to flip-flop and encourage fundraising from [[super PAC]]s.<ref>Jane Mayer, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/08/27/120827fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all Schmooze or Lose], ''New Yorker'', August 27, 2012.</ref>

Following the 2016 election cycle, Mayer covered the exertion of considerable influence of former Democratic strategist and pollster [[Patrick Caddell]], in his capacity as advisor to reclusive contributor [[Robert Mercer (businessman)|Robert Mercer]] for ''The New Yorker''. Hedge fund director Mercer, joined in his efforts by his daughter [[Rebekah Mercer (donor)|Rebekah]], has been an increasingly important source of substantial funding for right wing campaigns, including the successful candidacy of [[Donald Trump]].<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-tycoon-behind-the-trump-presidency The Reclusive hedge-fund tycoon behind the Trump presidency], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Jane Mayer, March 27, 2017.

===''Dark Money''===
In 2016, Doubleday published Mayer's fourth book, ''[[Dark Money (book)|Dark Money]]'', which became an instant national best-seller. ''The New York Times'' named it one of the ten best books of the year.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/books/review/best-books.html|title=The 10 Best Books of 2016|date=1 December 2016|accessdate=26 September 2017|via=www.nytimes.com}}</ref> ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' described it as "absolutely necessary reading for anyone who wants to make sense of our politics",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/03/10/koch-brothers-new-brand/|title=The Koch Brothers' New Brand|first=Bill|last=McKibben|date=10 March 2016|accessdate=26 September 2017|via=www.nybooks.com}}</ref> and ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' called Mayer "quite simply one of the very few, utterly invaluable journalists this country has".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a41594/jane-mayer-dark-money/|title=Why It's Very Dangerous to Be an Investigative Journalist in America|date=28 January 2016|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref> In interviews about her book, Mayer said approximately six investigators, led by former New York Police Commissioner Howard Safir, had been hired by the industrialist [[Koch family|Koch brothers]] in an effort to try to dig up dirt in order to smear her reputation, as well as accusations of plagiarism being leveled against her. She responded by publicly airing those tactics of intimidation, effectively debunking the smear campaign.<ref name="MotherJones_2016">{{citation |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/01/koch-brothers-jane-mayer-dark-money |title=How the Kochtopus Went After a Reporter |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |last=David |first=Corn |date=21 January 2016 |accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref><ref name="NYT_jan_2016">{{cite web | url=http://nyti.ms/23s8yR5 | title=What Happened to Jane Mayer When She Wrote About the Koch Brothers | website=The New York Times | date=26 January 2016 | accessdate=30 January 2016 | author=Dwyer, Jim}}</ref> ''Dark Money'' won the 2017 Helen Bernstein Award, and was a finalist for the PEN Jean Stein Prize, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the J.
