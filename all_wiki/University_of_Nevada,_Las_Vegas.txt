==History==
The first college classes, which eventually became the classes of UNLV, were offered as the southern regional extension division of the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]], in 1959 in a classroom at [[Las Vegas High School]]. In 1955, State Senator Mahlon Brown "sponsored the legislation to provide $200,000 to construct the campus's first building" - Frazier Hall.<ref>{{cite book |last=Moehring|first=Eugene|title=Las Vegas: A Centennial History|url=https://archive.org/details/lasvegascentenni00moeh|url-access=limited|year=2005|publisher=University of Nevada Press|location=Reno|isbn=978-0-87417-615-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/lasvegascentenni00moeh/page/n179 159]}}</ref> Groundbreaking on the original {{convert|60|acre|abbr=on|adj=on}} site was in April 1956, and the university purchased a {{convert|640|acre|abbr=on|adj=on}} site in [[North Las Vegas, Nevada|North Las Vegas]] for future expansion. UNLV was officially founded by the [[Nevada System of Higher Education|Nevada Board of Regents]] as the Southern Division of the University of Nevada on September 10, 1957. The first classes were held on the current campus in the [[Pole building framing|post and beam]] [[Mid Century Modern]] [[Maude Frazier]] Hall designed by the local architectural firm, [[Zick & Sharp]]. Twenty-nine students graduated in the first commencement ceremonies in 1964.<ref name=sawyer>{{cite news|title=Sawyer Lauds Local Campus At Graduation |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/1964/jun/04/sawyer-lauds-local-campus-graduation/?framing=history|access-date=21 November 2011|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=4 June 1964}}</ref><ref name=timeline>{{cite web |title=Celebrating Fifty Years |url=http://celebrating50.unlv.edu/timeline.html |publisher=UNLV|access-date=March 11, 2017}}</ref>

In 1965, the Nevada Legislature named the school Nevada Southern University, and the Board of Regents hired the campus's first president, Donald C. Moyer,<ref>{{cite web|title=UNLV History|url=http://www.unlv.edu/ourhistory/presidents/moyer|work=UNLV|access-date=11 February 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211064155/http://www.unlv.edu/ourhistory/presidents/moyer|archive-date=11 February 2015}}</ref> who died in 2008 at the age of 88.<ref>{{cite web|title=Donald C.

In 1968, Nevada Southern was given equal status with its parent institution in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], and the present name was approved by the regents in January 1969, during a winter session and without the need of input from representatives from the University of Nevada, Reno. During this time, Nevada Southern University also adopted the southern "Rebel" athletics moniker and a mascot dressed in a southern Confederate uniform named Beauregard. The popular reasoning behind such a controversial moniker and mascot is that they did it to oppose the northern Union traditions and symbols of their northern rival, the University of Nevada. Soon, protests from NSU/UNLV students forced a slight change to their Confederate mascot, but the "Rebels" moniker remains to this day. Since its founding, the university has grown rapidly, expanding both its academic programs and campus facilities.

In 1969, the board of regents approved the name University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the abbreviation UNLV.<ref name=timeline />

In 1973, [[Jerry Tarkanian]] was hired as the men's basketball coach by UNLV's second president, Roman Zorn.<ref name=zorn>{{cite news|title=UNLV's pioneering second president, Zorn, dies at 85 |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2002/aug/20/unlvs-pioneering-second-president-zorn-dies-at-85/|access-date=19 November 2011|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=20 August 2002}}</ref>

The Center for Business and Economic Research <!-- (CBER) -->  was established in 1975 for research projects that assist in the development of the Nevada economy and assist state and local agencies and private-sector enterprises in the collection and analysis of economic and market data.

In 1981, [[Claes Oldenburg]]'s Flashlight sculpture was installed on the plaza between Artemus Ham Hall and Judy Bayley Theatre.<ref>{{cite news|last=Arin|first=Naomi|title=High beam: Using a flashlight to illuminate the public art struggles of 'Paintbrushes'|url=http://vegasseven.com/2011/03/17/high-beam/|access-date=21 November 2011|newspaper=Vegas Seven|date=17 March 2011}}</ref>

In 2004, UNLV opened its first regional campus on Shadow Lane, near the University Medical Center.  The School of Dental Medicine is located on the Shadow Lane Campus.<ref name=timeline /> Also, the School of Public Health was established in the Division of Health Sciences to address new and emerging public-health issues.<ref name="facts" />

In 2005, construction began on the $113 million science and engineering building, which has 200,000 square feet of teaching space, laboratories, and high-tech conference rooms. The building, completed in 2008, was designed to support interdisciplinary research; draw students to high-demand fields such as electrical engineering, computer science, and environmental science; and attract national and international researchers. UNLV launched its first comprehensive campaign, Invent the Future, with the goal of raising $500 million by December 2008. Also, the Air Force ROTC program was established on campus.<ref name="facts" />

In 2006, The Nevada System of Higher Education Board of Regents raised the minimum GPA to 3.0 for admittance to UNLV. UNLV opened its first international campus in Singapore, where the William F. Harrah College of Hotel Administration offered a bachelor's degree program in hospitality management.<ref name="facts" /> UNLV planned to end its partnership with the Singapore Institute of Technology by 2015, due to economic issues such as rising tuition in Las Vegas and the falling value of the U.S. dollar in Singapore.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.unlvrebelyell.com/2013/01/28/unlv-to-split-with-singapore-education-partner/ |title= UNLV to split with Singapore education partner |last1= Formoso |first1= Julie Ann |date= January 28, 2013 |website= The Rebel Yell |publisher= The Rebel Yell |access-date= 2014-12-07 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141209230254/http://www.unlvrebelyell.com/2013/01/28/unlv-to-split-with-singapore-education-partner/ |archive-date= December 9, 2014 }}</ref>

In 2007, an expanded student union (with study and social lounges, eateries, a new ballroom and a 300-seat theater) and a new student recreation center (with high-tech weight and fitness rooms, swimming pools, and a juice bar) opened in the fall. These facilities reflected UNLV's goal of becoming more student-centered. The Greenspun College of Urban Affairs broke ground for the $94 million Greenspun Hall, which showcased the latest environmental and technological advancements and served as an anchor for "Midtown UNLV."<ref name="facts" />

In 2011, UNLV's business college was formally renamed after a $15 million donation from the Ted and Doris Lee family, the Las Vegas real estate, hotel, restaurant,  and casino investors.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Takahashi|first1=Paul|title=Lee family donates $15 million for UNLVís business school|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/oct/13/lee-family-donates-15-million-unlvs-business-schoo/|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|access-date=3 December 2014}}</ref>

===Black Mountain Institute===
The Black Mountain Institute (BMI) is a literary center at the University. It focusses on "live experiences, fellowships, innovative media, and literary activism".<ref>{{cite web |title=Homepage |url=https://blackmountaininstitute.org/ |website=Black Mountain Institute}}</ref>

==Research==
UNLV research and economic development activities increased for the fourth consecutive year, according to the fiscal-year-end report from the Division of Research and Economic Development. Research awards rose by 7.5 percent to nearly $34.5 million, and proposals increased by two percent. Research expenditures in FY18 totaled $37 million.<ref name="unlv.edu">{{Cite web|title=Research {{!}} University of Nevada, Las Vegas|url=https://www.unlv.edu/about-research|access-date=2020-06-08|website=www.unlv.edu}}</ref>

The College of Sciences received the largest amount of award funding among the colleges once again this fiscal year: nearly $15 million through more than 100 awards. Engineering followed with roughly $7.6 million in awards. The College of Education posted the largest percentage gain in award funding in FY16 with a nearly 47% increase from $1,776,332 in FY15 to $2,609,366 in FY16.

UNLV's economic development activities continue to grow. Sixty-one patents were filed in FY16, an increase of 17% over FY15, and licensing revenue doubled from $126,242 in FY15 to $252,309 in FY16.

Another measure of university research activity is the number of doctoral degrees conferred, as doctoral programs require a strong research component culminating in the doctoral dissertation. UNLV doctoral conferrals increased nearly 13% in FY16 to 166 degrees conferred. For the 2017-2018 school year, 163 doctoral degrees were conferred.<ref name="unlv.edu"/>

Much of the student life at UNLV revolves around its Student Union, which houses the offices for its student government and student organizations on its third floor.

===Student government===
The [[Consolidated Students of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (CSUN) is the undergraduate student government at UNLV.  This body consists of an executive board, a senate of 25 members from all of the colleges at UNLV, a judicial council, and directors who plan and organize events and marketing.  CSUN currently has an annual budget of about $1 million, funded through student fees.  The senate ways and means committee determines how the CSUN budget will be divided or set aside for items such as student organization funding and scholarships.  The final say on spending in CSUN is the senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unlvcsun.com/ |title=Student Government |publisher=Unlv Csun |access-date=2013-07-03}}</ref>

Together with UNLV, CSUN founded an on-campus preschool in 1974 as part of the College of Education.  Both students and staff can use this accredited preschool.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://preschool.unlv.edu/ |title=Home Page - UNLV/CSUN Preschool |publisher=Preschool.unlv.edu |access-date=2013-07-03}}</ref>

The graduate student government at UNLV, called The Graduate and Professional Student Association, is separate from the undergraduate student government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unlv.edu/gpsa |title=GPSA &#124; Home |publisher=Gpsa.unlv.edu |access-date=2013-07-03}}</ref>

===Student organizations===
UNLV has over 350<ref>{{Cite web|title=Student Organizations {{!}} Student Involvement & Activities {{!}} University of Nevada, Las Vegas|url=https://www.unlv.edu/sia/student-orgs|access-date=2020-06-10|website=www.unlv.edu}}</ref> student organizations.<ref name="colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com">{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/university-of-nevada-las-vegas-2569 |title=University of Nevada-Las Vegas &#124; Best College &#124; US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com|access-date=2013-07-03}}</ref> To become official, the organization must become recognized by UNLV's Involvement Center.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Registration & Management {{!}} Student Involvement & Activities {{!}} University of Nevada, Las Vegas|url=https://www.unlv.edu/sia/student-orgs/registration|access-date=2020-06-10|website=www.unlv.edu}}</ref><ref>[http://getinvolved.unlv.edu/studentorgs/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123120346/http://getinvolved.unlv.edu/studentorgs/|date=January 23, 2009}}</ref>

===Newspaper===
''The Scarlet and Gray Free Press'' is the student newspaper on campus.  It covers many topics about higher education in  UNLV and the state.  The paper extensively covers CSUN senate meetings and elections.  It is printed twice weekly and  posts its articles online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unlvfreepress.com/ |title=The Rebel Yell |publisher=Unlvrebelyell.com |date=2012-10-09 |access-date=2013-07-03}}</ref> Recently, the newspaper's name was changed from ''Rebel Yell'' to its current iteration, as the former title was criticized for its reference to Confederate culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2016/nov/28/unlv-student-newspaper-no-longer-named-the-rebel-y/|title=UNLV student newspaper no longer named The Rebel Yell - Las Vegas Sun Newspaper|first=Ian|last=Whitaker|date=28 November 2016|website=lasvegassun.com}}</ref>

==Campus==
[[File:StripFromUNLV.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Las Vegas Strip]] can be seen in the distance from various points on the UNLV campus.]]
The main campus of UNLV is on 332-acres <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unlv.edu/about/ |title=About UNLV &#124; University of Nevada, Las Vegas |publisher=Unlv.edu |access-date=2013-10-23}}</ref> in centrally located Paradise, Nevada.

Midtown UNLV is an ongoing private-public development along Maryland Parkway, a border street to the school. Development began in 2002 and its purpose is to expand the university to meet the demands of a major university in the [[Las Vegas metropolitan area]]. The project to improve the "front door" of the university by improving amenities for students and businesses along Maryland Parkway. The goals are to reduce vacant spaces, lower business turnover rates, and create space for the university to expand. Additionally, the project aims to create new housing developments close to campus. Major funding is through state funding sources along with private donations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://midtown.unlv.edu/about.html |title=Midtown UNLV &#124; About Midtown UNLV |publisher=Midtown.unlv.edu |date=2007-05-04 |access-date=2013-10-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814193752/http://midtown.unlv.edu/about.html |archive-date=2014-08-14 }}</ref>

===Sustainability===
The University of Nevada, Las Vegas has created an Urban Sustainability Initiative that strives to implement sustainable practices on campus and in the larger Las Vegas community.<ref name=" Urban Sustainability Initiative Home ">{{cite web|title=Urban Sustainability Initiative|publisher=University of Nevada - Las Vegas|url=http://urban21.unlv.edu/|access-date=2008-05-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704065937/http://urban21.unlv.edu/|archive-date=2008-07-04}}</ref> In addition to having two campus buildings in the process of [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Silver Certification and one building in the process of LEED Gold Certification, UNLV has reduced its use of electricity and natural gas by 38% per square foot since 2001 by retrofitting older campus buildings.<ref name=" Urban Sustainability Initiative Campus Efforts ">{{cite web|title=Urban Sustainability Initiative Campus Efforts|publisher=University of Nevada - Las Vegas|url=http://urban21.unlv.edu/about/efforts.html|access-date=2008-05-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905071014/http://urban21.unlv.edu/about/efforts.html|archive-date=2008-09-05}}</ref> In the 2009 edition of the Sustainable Endowment Institute's College Sustainability Report Card, University of Nevada-Las Vegas received a grade of "C".<ref name="Sustainable Endowments Institute Report Card">{{cite web|title=College Sustainability Report Card 2008|publisher=Sustainable Endowments Institute|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2009/schools/university-of-nevadalas-vegas|access-date=2008-05-28}}</ref>

The Science and Engineering building received a LEED Silver rating in March 2009. SEB achieved this rating by using recycled glass, steel, concrete, and wood. More than 60% of the leftover construction materials were recycled. The roof of SEB was made to reflect 92% of sunlight. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed into the building, so reduces energy needed to cool the building. Incoming air to SEB is also cooled through evaporation so the need for air conditioning is reduced. High-performance window glazing also allows light to come in while keeping the building insulated. Occupancy sensors allow lights to automatically turn off when a room is not occupied, saving electricity. Low-flow sinks, toilets, and showers, as well as a drip irrigation system for the native desert landscape, reduce water usage by 42%. SEB also uses a reclaimed water system that captures wastewater, providing 750 gallons of water a day that are used to flush toilets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unlv.edu/seb/features |title=Features &#124; Science and Engineering Building &#124; University of Nevada, Las Vegas |publisher=Unlv.edu |access-date=2013-07-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026012640/http://www.unlv.edu/seb/features |archive-date=2013-10-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Greenspun College of Urban Affairs building of UNLV received a LEED Gold rating in April 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgbcnv.org/leed-in-nevada |title=USGBC Nevada - LEED in Nevada |publisher=Usgbcnv.org |access-date=2013-07-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207161138/http://usgbcnv.org/leed-in-nevada |archive-date=2013-12-07 }}</ref>

In 2009, UNLV received the Cashman Good Government Award for the campus' sustainability measures for "maintaining consistent energy costs despite substantial campus growth," saving nearly $11 million from 2001-2009. UNLV was also recognized for managing the xeric demonstration garden and for its recycling efforts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://urban21.unlv.edu/about/efforts.html |title=Urban Sustainability Initiative &#124; Campus Sustainability Efforts |publisher=Urban21.unlv.edu |date=2001-08-24 |access-date=2013-07-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702234017/http://urban21.unlv.edu/about/efforts.html |archive-date=2013-07-02 }}</ref>

{{Main|UNLV Rebels}}
UNLV supports varsity teams in 16<ref>{{Cite web|title=Athletics {{!}} Athletics {{!}} University of Nevada, Las Vegas|url=https://www.unlv.edu/athletics|access-date=2020-06-10|website=www.unlv.edu}}</ref> different sports. The men's basketball team is referred to as the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|Runnin' Rebels]] and the men's baseball team is referred to as the Hustlin' Rebels. The Rebels are a founding member of the [[Mountain West Conference]], in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] Division I. The only exceptions are the UNLV men's soccer team and swim and dive team, which compete in the [[Western Athletic Conference]].

The school's official colors of scarlet and gray can be traced to 1958, when UNLV adopted as mascot a wolf wearing a Confederate uniform. Scarlet and gray were traditional colors of the Confederacy with its gray uniforms and red-based flag. UNLV's mascot is [[Hey Reb!]], the toned-down version of the original mascot named Beauregard, which was a wolf character dressed in [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] hat and uniform. UNLV's Hey Reb mascot made his debut in 1983. He received his first makeover in 1997 and second in 2009. Named one of 12 All-American Mascots, he competed for the title of 2004 Capital One Mascot of the Year and made a strong showing by coming in second in online voting. No stranger to national television, Hey Reb has also appeared in two memorable ESPN SportsCenter commercials.

UNLV's mascot is based on the University's split from their literal Northern rival, University of Nevada (Reno) and not on any direct reference to the actual Confederacy. As UNLV was once a Southern campus of the University of Nevada (Reno) when it became its own university, UNLV was seen as literally the South splitting from the North. UNLV had been seen as the little brother to UNR for quite some time even though Las Vegas has always been the more densely populated city of the two. Thus, the University of Nevada (Reno) Wolf mascot was dressed as a confederate soldier in UNLV colors and made the UNLV mascot as a Rebel to the UNR Wolf Pack which became the main rival of UNLV. The original basketball center court with the wolf mascot is still at the center of campus today.  This story is relayed to incoming Freshman during Freshman orientation.

On June 16, 2020, amid protests of racial inequality related to the [[killing of George Floyd]], UNLV announced removed the [[Hey Reb! (sculpture)|Hey Reb! statue]] in front of the Tam Alumni Center, stating: "In recent conversations with the donor we mutually agreed it was best to remove the statue and return it." The University's president Marta Meana clarified the decision: "Over the past few months, I have had discussions with multiple individuals and stakeholder groups from campus and the community on how best the university can move forward given recent events throughout our nation".<ref>{{cite tweet|url=https://twitter.com/unlv/status/1273086620384653312?s=19|title=UNLV statue thread|number=1273086620384653312|user=UNLV|date=June 16, 2020|accessdate=June 17, 2020}}</ref>

UNLV has many traditions in its athletic programs. Each year, the men's football team plays the [[Nevada Wolf Pack football|Nevada Wolf Pack]] in a football game called the Battle for Nevada. The trophy for that game is the [[Fremont Cannon]]. Built by the [[Kennecott Utah Copper|Kennecott Copper]] Corp., Nevada Mines Division, the cannon is valued at more than $10,000 and is considered one of the best and loudest, symbols of rivalry in college football.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unlvrebels.com/trads/unlv-trads-cannon.html |title=UNLV Official Athletic Site - Traditions |publisher=Unlvrebels.cstv.com |access-date=2013-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923160200/http://www.unlvrebels.com/trads/unlv-trads-cannon.html |archive-date=2013-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The cannon was permanently silenced in 2000, when Rebel players and fans accidentally dropped the trophy during a victory celebration.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite web|title=The Fremont Cannon {{!}} Campus Life {{!}} University of Nevada, Las Vegas|url=https://www.unlv.edu/campuslife/fremont-cannon|access-date=2020-06-10|website=www.unlv.edu}}</ref>  Since then, the teams continue the tradition with the victor painting the Fremont Cannon with the inscription of "University of Notta Lotta Victories" or "University of Northern Rejects".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> UNLV trails Nevada in the series 28-18 after losing the 2020 game at Allegiant Stadium with a score of 31-19.

UNLV is most known for its men's basketball program. Made famous by Coach [[Jerry Tarkanian]] in the 1970s&ndash;1990s, the Runnin' Rebels are the third-most winning team in Division I basketball history by percentage, only behind Kentucky and North Carolina (.713, 1037-418 through 2008).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://basketball.about.com/od/recordbook/a/winning-percent.htm |title=Best Record in History - Top Winning Percentages in Basketball History |publisher=Basketball.about.com |access-date=2013-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707074821/http://basketball.about.com/od/recordbook/a/winning-percent.htm |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The UNLV team is well known for their 1990 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] by defeating [[Duke University]] 103-73, which was and still is the largest margin of victory in a championship game.
