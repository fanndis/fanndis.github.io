'''Russell Marion Nelson Sr.''' (born September 9, 1924) is an American religious leader and former surgeon who is the [[List of presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|17th]] and current [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).<ref name="bio">{{Citation |title=Leader Biography: President Russell M. Nelson |url=http://www.newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/leader-biographies/president-russell-m-nelson |publisher=[[LDS Church]] |agency=newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org}}</ref>  Nelson was a member of the LDS Church's [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] for nearly 34 years, and was the [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|quorum president]] from 2015 to 2018. As church president, Nelson is accepted by the church as a [[prophet, seer, and revelator]].<ref name="example">See, e.g., [//www.churchofjesuschrist.org/general-conference/2015/04/the-sustaining-of-church-officers "The Sustaining of Church Officers"], April 2015 General Conference.</ref>

A native of [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], Nelson attended the [[University of Utah]] for his undergraduate and medical school education.  He then did his [[Residency (medicine)|medical residency]] and earned a [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he was a member of the research team developing the [[heart-lung machine]] that in 1951 supported the first ever human [[open-heart surgery]] using [[cardiopulmonary bypass]]. After further surgical training and a two-year stint in the [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Medical Corps]] during the [[Korean War]], Nelson returned to Salt Lake City and accepted a professorship at the [[University of Utah School of Medicine]].  He spent the next 29 years working in the field of [[cardiothoracic surgery]].  Nelson became a noted heart surgeon, and served as president of the [[Society for Vascular Surgery]] and the Utah Medical Association.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Johnson |first=Alex |date=16 January 2018 |title=Noted heart surgeon unlikely to transform Mormon church as new president |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/religion/noted-heart-surgeon-russell-nelson-unlikely-transform-mormon-church-new-n838216 |access-date=24 January 2018 |website=NBC News |language=en}}</ref>

Nelson served in a variety of lay LDS leadership positions during his surgical career, beginning locally in Salt Lake City and then as the LDS Church's [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] General President from 1971 to 1979.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hemingway |first=Heather |date=October 12, 2013 |title=Mormons Worldwide Tune in to Semiannual General Conference |work=blog.chron.com |publisher=Jack Sweeney |agency=[[Houston Chronicle]] |editor-last=Cohen |editor-first=Jeff |url=http://blog.chron.com/mormonvoice/2013/10/mormons-worldwide-tune-in-to-semiannual-general-conference/ |access-date=September 11, 2014 |quote=Russell M.

Oaks]] were selected to fill two vacancies in the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.  LDS [[Apostle (LDS Church)|apostles]] serve full-time for life, and so Nelson retired from all of his prior professional positions.

==Early life and education==
Russell M. Nelson was born on September 9, 1924, in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], to Marion Clavar Nelson (1897–1990)<ref>{{Cite web |title=Marion Clavar Nelson |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Marion-Nelson/6000000015431365316 |publisher=Geni.com}}</ref> and Floss Edna Nelson (''née'' Anderson; 1893–1983).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Edna Nelson |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Edna-Nelson/6000000015431572926 |publisher=Geni.com}}</ref>  He had two sisters, Marjory E. (1920–2016) and Enid (1926–2019), and a brother, Robert H. (1931–2014). Nelson's father was a reporter for the ''[[Deseret News]]'' and later became general manager of Gillham Advertising, Utah's earliest [[advertising agency]].<ref>[https://www.thechurchnews.com/leaders-and-ministry/2018-06-14/what-you-didnt-know-about-the-fathers-who-raised-the-first-presidency-47366 article on the father's of members of the LDS First Presidency in the ''Deseret News'']</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Jarrard |first1=G.

After medical school, Nelson went to the [[University of Minnesota]] for his [[Residency (medicine)|medical residency]]. While at Minnesota, he was a member of the surgeon [[Clarence Dennis]]'s research team that pioneered the [[heart-lung machine]] that in April 1951 supported the first human [[open-heart surgery]] using [[cardiopulmonary bypass]]. Nelson received a [[Ph.D.]] from Minnesota in 1954 for his research contributions.<ref name="Condie2003">{{Cite book |last=Condie |first=Spencer J. |title=Russell M.

Nelson served a two-year term of duty in the [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Medical Corps]] during the [[Korean War]], and was stationed at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] While on duty, he was assigned to a research group formed by the commandant of the Graduate School at Walter Reed, Col. William S. Stone and led by Dr. Fiorindo A. Simeone, a professor of surgery at [[Western Reserve University]] in Cleveland who had been a clinical investigator in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|Mediterranean Theater]] during World War II. This team was focused on ways to improve the treatment of wounded and was sent to all five [[Mobile army surgical hospital (United States)|MASH]] units active in Korea along with two major evacuation hospitals, several field station hospitals, a prisoner of war camp and larger evacuation hospitals in Japan, Hawaii, and the mainland United States in order to implement such improvements. At one point, the team came close enough to the front that they received fire from enemy artillery positions, which missed them. After 20 months in service, he left active duty at the rank of [[Captain_(United_States_O-3)|captain]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Page |last2=Stahle |first2=Shaun |date=24 April 2009 |title=My Home Base |url=https://www.thechurchnews.com/archives/2009-04-24/my-home-base-72032 |access-date=15 October 2019 |journal=Nursing Standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain) : 1987)|volume=12 |issue=23 |page=21 |doi=10.7748/ns.12.23.21.s39 |pmid=9528539 }}</ref>

Following his military service, he did a year of work and surgical training at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]].<ref name=byustudies/>

==Medical career==
Nelson returned to Salt Lake City in 1955 and accepted a faculty position at the [[University of Utah School of Medicine]]. There he built his own heart-lung bypass machine and employed it to support the first open-heart surgery in the state of Utah.<ref name="Deseret Book">{{Cite book |last=Condie |first=Spencer J. |title=Russell M.

This would mark the first of many career achievements for Nelson. In March 1956, he performed the first successful pediatric cardiac operation at the SLGH, a total repair of [[tetralogy of Fallot]] in a four-year-old girl. He was at the forefront of surgeons focusing attention on coronary artery disease,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nelson |first=Russell |title=From Heart to Heart |date=1979 |publisher=Nelson |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |page=318}}</ref> and contributed to the advance of valvular surgery as well.

Jenson, performed a quadruple [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]] on the Chinese opera performer Fang Rongxiang ({{ill|方荣翔|zh}}); 1925–1989).<ref name="Deseret Book" />

Nelson first operated out of the University of Utah's medical school. He later had a practice at the Salt Lake Clinic with admission privileges at [[LDS Hospital]]. In 1964, he set up his own private practice with him as the lead and Conrad Jenson as an associate. In 1966, Nelson became head of the thoracic residency program that combined resource from the University of Utah Medical School, LDS Hospital, Primary Children's Hospital and the VA Hospital in Salt Lake City.<ref>Condie. ''Ruseell M. Nelson'' Chapter 12</ref>

In 1965, the [[University of Chicago]] offered Nelson the position as head of their department of thoracic surgery. [[Dallin H. Oaks]], then a law professor at Chicago and a fellow Latter-day Saint, actively worked to recruit Nelson. However, after consulting with [[David O. McKay]], Nelson turned down the offer.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Weaver |first=Sarah Jane |date=January 16, 2018 |title=Meet LDS Church President Russell M.

Nelson became involved with the administrative aspects of medicine and was elected president of the Utah State Medical Association.<ref name="bio" /> He was chair of the Division of Thoracic Surgery at LDS Hospital.<ref name="ensign" />

In 1981 Nelson held appointments as a visiting professor of surgery at the National Institute of Cardiology in Mexico City and the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile. In May 1982 he was a visiting professor at the Hospital de Clinicas in Montevideo, Uruguay.<ref>Condie. ''Rusell M. Nelson'', Ch. 17</ref>

Nelson was honored nationally by being elected president of the [[Society for Vascular Surgery]] for the year 1975.<ref>[https://vascular.org/about-svs/history/svs-past-presidents Listing of presidents of the Society for Vascular Surgery]</ref> He was also a director of the American Board of Thoracic Surgery.<ref name="ensign" /> Nelson traveled extensively as a medical doctor and addressed conferences in many parts of Latin America and Africa, as well as in India and China.<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 17, 2018 |title=Pamela Atkinson: President Nelson's work has been saving lives and souls |url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900007760/pamela-atkinson-president-nelsons-work-has-been-saving-lives-and-souls.html |access-date=January 22, 2018 |website=DeseretNews.com}}</ref>

In 2015, the University of Utah, along with the [[American College of Cardiology]], created the Russell M.

==LDS Church service==
In addition to his medical work, Nelson served frequently as a leader in the LDS Church. In Minnesota, he served as what was then known as Sunday School Superintendent in his local congregation. In Washington DC, he was a counselor in the [[Bishopric (LDS Church)|bishopric]] of the ward [[Ezra Taft Benson]], then an apostle, regularly attended while serving as Secretary of Agriculture to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. In Massachusetts, Nelson was the secretary for the adult [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic priesthood]] organization in his Boston-area branch.<ref>Spencer J. Condie. ''Russell M. Nelson: Apostle, Surgeon, Father''</ref> 

After returning to Salt Lake City, he was called as priest quorum advisor in the Garden Park Ward, working with over 50 boys ages 16 to 18. He next served as member of the Bonneville Stake YMMIA superintendency (a position roughly equivalent to a modern counselor in the stake young men's presidency) and then as a counselor in the bishopric of the Garden Park Ward. He was [[setting apart|set apart]] as a counselor in the bishopric by [[Joseph Fielding Smith]], whose son-in-law was the bishop. Nelson served in that bishopric for over five years at a time when it had over 1,000 members. He then moved to the Yale Second Ward still in the Bonneville Stake and was called as a member of the [[Stake (LDS Church)|stake]] [[High council (Latter Day Saints)|high council]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Elder Russell M. Nelson Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/prophets-and-apostles/what-are-prophets/bio/russell-m-nelson?lang=eng&_r=1 |access-date=January 22, 2018 |website=www.churchofjesuschrist.org}}</ref><ref>Condie. ''Russell M. Nelson''</ref> He later served as a [[stake president]] in Salt Lake City from 1964 to 1971, with [[Joseph B. Wirthlin]] serving as his second counselor. From 1955 to 1965, Nelson served as a missionary on [[Temple Square]] every Thursday afternoon for about two hours giving tours to visitors. The call to serve in this position had been extended to Nelson by [[Richard L. Evans]], an apostle and the lead figure over publicity efforts on Temple Square.<ref>Condie. ''Rusell M. Nelson''</ref>

Nelson also served for eight years as the church's Sunday School General President. During his tenure the Sunday School developed a unified 8-year-cycle of covering the LDS Church's scriptures in its curriculum. There was also a shift from having members of the Sunday School general board do all the training for new teachers to providing materials which developed into the book ''Teaching: No Greater Call''. The hymn practice time in Sunday School was also renamed to worship through music.<ref>Condie. ''Russell M. Nelson''</ref>

Nelson later served for four and a half years as a [[regional representative of the Twelve|regional representative]]. Approximately half of this time, he was assigned to oversee the fourteen stakes at BYU, while he worked with the stakes in [[Kearns, Utah]] for the other time.<ref>Condie. ''Russell M. Nelson''</ref><ref name="bio" />

===Apostle===
Nelson was called as an apostle by church president Spencer W. Kimball, to whom he had served as a personal physician for many years. Nelson was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on April 7, 1984, during the church's [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]]. He was ordained an apostle on April 12, 1984, by [[Gordon B. Hinckley]]. At the same conference, Dallin H. Oaks was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. Nelson and Oaks filled the vacancies in the Quorum created by the deaths of [[LeGrand Richards]] and [[Mark E. Petersen]].<ref name="President Russell M.

Nelson: 5 Fun Facts], Aggieland Mormons, August 4, 2015.</ref> Early in his service as an apostle, Nelson was an adviser to the church's [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]] organization and was supportive of the developing of the Young Women values and [[Personal Progress]] program.<ref>[https://www.thechurchnews.com/living-faith/2018-08-28/what-i-know-now-that-i-learned-from-president-russell-m-nelson-47855 article by Ardeth Kapp on Nelson's role as Young Women Adviser]</ref>

In 1991, Nelson served as the negotiator for the LDS Church with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] over whether contributions to support [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]] serving would be tax deductible. In 1992, he was the church's lead delegate to the [[Parliament of the World's Religions|Parliament on World Religions]]. For a time he was also the church's representative to a US State Department committee on international religious freedom.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Elder Russell M.

In August 2010, Nelson journeyed to the dedication of the [[Kiev Ukraine Temple]]. Afterwards, in September, he traveled to church meetings in several European countries. He pronounced blessings upon [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Kosovo]] while visiting each of those countries; these serve as addendums to Monson's 1985 dedication of [[Yugoslavia]] for the preaching of the gospel.<ref>[https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2010-09-23/elder-nelson-pronounces-blessings-on-six-balkan-nations-36125 "Elder Nelson pronounces blessings on six Balkan nations"], ''[[Church News]]'' September 23, 2010.</ref>

=== President of the Church ===
With the death of Monson on January 2, 2018, Nelson became the anticipated [[President of the Church (LDS Church)#Succession to the presidency|successor]] to the church's presidency.

Uchtdorf]], who had served as Monson's Second Counselor, in the new [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]. This marked the first time since 1985 that a new church president had not retained a previously-serving counselor.

==== Worldwide ministry ====
Since becoming church president, Nelson has visited members of the LDS Church in various areas of the world. Up through August 2019, he had visited sixteen countries, addressing thousands of members of the faith.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Taylor |first=Scott |title=President Nelson Traveled to 16 Nations and Territories during First Year as Prophet |agency=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/president-nelson-traveled-to-16-nations-and-territories-during-first-year-as-prophet?lang=eng |access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref>

The first trip, called a global ministry tour by the church, occurred in April 2018, when Nelson along with his wife, and [[Jeffrey R. Holland]] and his wife, met with Latter-day Saints in [[London]], [[England]]; [[Jerusalem]]; [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]; [[Harare]], [[Zimbabwe]]; [[Bengaluru]], [[India]]; [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]; [[Hong Kong]]; and [[Laie, Hawaii]].<ref>[https://www.newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/president-nelson-global-ministry-tour-landing-page article on the global ministry tour]</ref>

In September 2018, Nelson visited the [[Dominican Republic]], where he gave an entire talk in Spanish, which was believed to be the first time a church president had given an extended talk in a formal setting in a language other than English.<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900030340/president-nelson-promises-puerto-ricans-their-best-days-are-ahead.html Deseret News article on Nelson's tour of Caribbean]</ref> On the same trip, he visited Puerto Rico.<ref>[https://www.mormonnewsroom.org.jm/article/president-nelson-will-visit-the-dominican-republic-and-puerto-rico]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Swensen |first=Jason |title=President Nelson promises Puerto Ricans their 'best days' are ahead |url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900030340/president-nelson-promises-puerto-ricans-their-best-days-are-ahead.html |access-date=26 March 2019 |website=deseretnews.com |publisher=Deseret News}}</ref>

On March 9, 2019, Nelson met with [[Pope Francis]] at the Vatican. The event marked the first time in history that a pope and an LDS Church president met face-to-face. The meeting took place the day before the church's [[Rome Italy Temple]] was dedicated.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Prophet Meets Pope Francis at the Vatican |url=https://www.newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/prophet-meets-pope-francis-vatican |publisher=Newsroom of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Weaver |first=Sarah Jane |title=President Nelson Meets with Pope Francis at the Vatican |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/president-nelson-meets-with-pope-francis-at-the-vatican?lang=eng |publisher=Church News of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Walch |first=Tad |title=Pope Francis meets with President Nelson in the Vatican |url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900059557/pope-francis-meets-with-president-nelson-in-the-vatican-catholic-mormon-rome.html |publisher=Deseret News}}</ref>

==== Policy changes and announcements ====
The first few months of Nelson's leadership of the LDS Church saw many significant changes to church policy, although many had at least been heavily discussed before he became church president, and some were continuations of policies instituted by his predecessors. Nelson began his presidency two days after his ordination with a short broadcast to church members in January 2018 before then holding a press conference. This broadcast ahead of the press conference was unprecedented and provided the new leaders an opportunity to briefly address the entire church immediately.<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/2018/04/as-we-go-forward-together?lang=eng report on Nelson's broadcast to the Church]</ref> 

In March 2018, the First Presidency issued a letter on preventing and responding to abuse. This letter reiterated existing policies, but also explicitly stated that no one should ever be counseled against reporting abuse to legal authorities. The guidance also had a clear emphasis on using counseling to assist in healing from abuse. It also provided more clear policies mandating all interviews with women and youth be done with another person in the general area, and made it clear that youth and women could have a parent or other adult present for an interview. It also adjusted previous policies forbidding adult males to teach classes of children or youth alone to apply to all adults.<ref>[https://www.newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/first-presidency-encourages-leaders-worldwide-prevent-respond-abuse report on March first presidency letter]</ref>

During the church's April general conference, Nelson announced the appointment of Asian-American [[Gerrit W. Gong]] and Brazilian [[Ulisses Soares]] to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, both of whom had been serving in the [[Seventy (LDS Church)#Presidency of the Seventy|Presidency of the Seventy]].<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900014460/twitter-reacts-to-lds-church-naming-new-apostles-elder-gong-and-elder-soares.html article about new apostles]</ref> 

Nelson also announced major changes in church organization during the April general conference. First, the [[high priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priests]] groups at the [[ward (LDS Church)|ward]] level were dissolved, making all [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] holders in wards and branches part of the [[elder (Latter Day Saints)|elders]] [[quorum (Latter Day Saints)|quorum]]. A stake's high priest quorum now consists of current members of stake presidencies, high councils, bishoprics and functioning [[patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|patriarchs]]. Next, Nelson announced the end of home teaching and visiting teaching, replacing the programs with a focus on [[ministering]], and shifting both the focus and methods of tracking them. As part of this change, young women ages 14–18 may be assigned as ministering sisters, similar to the-long standing policies of young men ages 14–18 serving as home teachers.<ref>[https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/04/01/the-latest-from-final-day-of-mormon-general-conference-easter-greetings-plea-to-be-worthy-of-gods-guidance/ article on announcements at general conference]</ref> At the end of the conference, Nelson announced the construction of seven new [[temple (LDS Church)|temples]], including the first in Nicaragua, Russia, India, and Virginia.

In May 2018, the church announced it would end its sponsorship of Scouting troops in the United States and Canada at the end of 2019. As part of this decision, it was stated that all [[Young Men (organization)|Young Men]], [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]], and [[Primary (LDS Church)|Primary]] programs for those age 8–18 would be replaced by a new, unified worldwide program.<ref>[https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/05/09/mormon-church-to-cut-ties-with-boy-scouts-and-start-its-own-gospel-driven-youth-program/ article on LDS Church ending scouting, announcing new youth program]</ref>

June 2018 began with a First Presidency-sponsored celebration of the 40th anniversary of [[1978 Revelation on Priesthood|the revelation]] extending [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] and temple blessings to all worthy members without regard to race, in which Nelson gave concluding remarks.<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900020359/church-news-president-nelsons-full-remarks-from-the-lds-churchs-be-one-celebration.html article on Nelson's statement at meeting]</ref> A few days before this, Nelson and his counselors met with the national leaders of the [[NAACP]].<ref>[http://fox13now.com/2018/05/17/watch-live-lds-church-first-presidency-and-naacp-making-joint-statement/ article on Nelson meeting with NAACP leadership]</ref> That same weekend Nelson gave a devotional to LDS youth in which he urged them to more fully commit to the church. He encouraged them to choose a set of seven days together to avoid the use of social media.<ref>[https://www.newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/president-nelson-challenges-youth-greatest-cause-on-earth report on Nelson's remarks in youth devotional]</ref> On June 18, the First Presidency created committees assigned to form a unified [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints hymns|hymnbook]] and [[Children's Songbook|children's songbook]] for the worldwide church membership, with each language edition having the same hymns (and songs) in the same order, and that these committees would be taking submissions and collecting surveys until July 2019. It is anticipated that the process of creating the new unified hymnbook and children's songbook will take several years.<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900022000/major-revisions-to-lds-church-hymnbooks-coming-soon-will-add-global-flavor.html article on new hymnbook announcement]</ref>

In August 2018, Nelson issued a statement urging the use of the church's full name.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/us/mormon-latter-day-saints-name.html ''New York Times'', Aug 18, 2018]</ref> At the church's general conference in October 2018, he reiterated his position, declaring, "It is a correction" and "It is the command of the Lord." Nelson told members that the use of nicknames such as ''[[Mormon (word)|Mormon]]'' or ''LDS'' was "a major victory for Satan."<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Peggy Fletcher Stack |last2=Scott D.

In the October 2018 general conference, Nelson announced an adjustment in the balance between a home-centered, church-supported form of worship. This was highlighted by shortening the length of Sunday church meetings to 2-hours from the previous 3-hours.<ref>[https://universe.byu.edu/2018/10/06/two-hour-church-block-announced-in-general-conference-1/ article on shift]</ref> At the end of the month, Nelson toured five south American countries, during which he met with Peru's president, [[Martín Vizcarra]], gave a major address in Peru in Spanish, and dedicated the [[Concepción Chile Temple]].<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900039712/president-nelson-in-south-america-8-inspiring-moments-from-the-recent-ministry-tour.html article overviewing this tour]</ref>

In December 2018, the church's First Presidency changed the process of youth class progression and priesthood ordination. Beginning in 2019, youth began moving between classes and priesthood quorums at the beginning of the year in which they turn 12, 14, or 16, rather than when their birthday occurs during the year.<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900046498/mormon-priesthood-young-women-program-and-temple-attendance-at-age-11-for-some-latter-day-saints.html ''Deseret News'' article on age changes]</ref>

On April 5, 2020, Nelson announced a new proclamation, "[[The Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: A Bicentennial Proclamation to the World]]". The proclamation coincided with the 200th anniversary of [[Joseph Smith]]’s [[First Vision]] and is the sixth proclamation issued by the church in its history.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-04-05 |title=Prophet Introduces a New Proclamation to the World: "The Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ" |url=http://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/restoration-proclamation |access-date=2020-06-07 |website=newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-04-05 |title=How rare a proclamation: A look at 2020's on the Restoration and the 5 previous in Church history |url=https://www.thechurchnews.com/leaders-and-ministry/2020-04-05/general-conference-april-2020-sunday-morning-new-proclamation-restoration-180340 |access-date=2020-06-07 |website=Church News |language=en-US}}</ref>

====Temples====
Nelson's tenure as church president has been punctuated by an increased focus on worship within LDS temples. As of April 2020, Nelson has announced a total of 43 new temples to be built in several countries around the world.{{cn|date=April 2020}} His travels have been punctuated by several temple dedications, most notably the [[Rome Italy Temple]] in March 2019, which was attended by all current members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

In 2018, Nelson announced 19 new temples, seven in April and 12 in October, among which were the first in [[India]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Russia]], and [[Cambodia]]. During his April 2018 visit to India, Nelson explained to church members that the Lord had instructed him to announce the temple the night before general conference, though he had not originally planned to do so.<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900016345/in-india-the-story-of-the-india-temple-announcement-is-revealed.html In India, the story of the India LDS Temple Announcement Is Revealed], ''[[Deseret News]]'', 19 April 2018.
