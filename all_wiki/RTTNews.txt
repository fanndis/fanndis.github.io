The [[newswire]] carries corporate news and economic news, market commentaries, corporate and economic calendars particularly covering the U.S and UK. The company has its headquarters in Washington DC. A few websites mention it is owned by Andrew Mariathasan, but almost no news stories suitable for Wikipedia reference can be located!
