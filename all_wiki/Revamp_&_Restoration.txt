'''''Revamp: Reimagining the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin''''' and '''''Restoration: Reimagining the Songs of Elton John and Bernie Taupin''''' are two tribute albums to English performer [[Elton John]] and his frequent songwriting partner [[Bernie Taupin]]. Both released on 6 April 2018, ''Revamp'' was described as John's project and features covers of the duo's back catalogue by pop, rock and R&B artists, whereas ''Restoration'' was seen as Taupin's project and features covers by country music artists.<ref name="eonline">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Zach|date=15 March 2018|title=Elton John Announces Two Cover Albums Featuring Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga and Ed Sheeran|url=http://www.eonline.com/uk/news/920885/elton-john-announces-two-cover-albums-featuring-miley-cyrus-lady-gaga-and-ed-sheeran|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=[[E!

The release of the albums coincided with John's 2018–2020 [[Farewell Yellow Brick Road]] tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/elton-john-announces-retirement-from-touring-w515829|title=Elton John Announces Retirement From Touring|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=24 January 2018}}</ref>

The cover of "[[Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters]]" by [[Maren Morris]] which appears on ''Restoration'' received a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Solo Performance]] nomination at the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards]].

== Background ==
On the decision to release two separate albums encompassing different genres, Taupin told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'':<blockquote>From day one we borrowed from everything that's good about [[Music of the United States|American music]] – whether it's [[blues]], [[Country music|country]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[Pop music|pop]], pure [[Rock music|rock]] – everything got thrown in the mix. It would be tiring if you just got stuck in one niche your entire career, especially when it's one as long as ours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/miley-cyrus-lady-gaga-set-for-elton-john-tribute-album-w517890|title=Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, Ed Sheeran Set for Two Elton John Tribute Albums|work=Rolling Stone|date=15 March 2018}}</ref> </blockquote>According to John, "We have two completely different albums; ''Revamp'' being the pop one and ''Restoration'' being the country one and God we have so many great artists doing our songs, it's quite incredible."<ref name="eonline" />

Of his ''Revamp'' record, John told ''[[E!]]'':<ref name="eonline" /><blockquote>It's always a huge compliment when an artist loves your song enough to take the time and effort to rework it. As songwriters, Bernie [Taupin] and myself are thrilled when singers we admire and respect as much as those on ''Revamp'' and ''Restoration'' choose to add their own unique twist in the process. It means that our music is still relevant and ultimately that our songs continue to reach new audiences. We're humbled and thank them all for their generosity.</blockquote>He added, "On ''Revamp'', I wrote out a wish list of people that I would love and asked them and to my surprise most of them said yes and we have quite an astonishing eclectic crew."<ref name="eonline" />

Of Taupin's ''Restoration'' record, John said, "''Restoration'' was Bernie's project and he's a huge country fan. He came up with an astonishing list of country performers both new and legendary".<ref name="UMG">{{cite web |url=http://www.umgnashville.com/news/restoration-reimagining-songs-elton-john-bernie-taupin-released-april-6/ |title=Restoration: Reimagining The Songs Of Elton John And Bernie Taupin To Be Released April 6 |website=[[Universal Music Group Nashville]]}}</ref>

== Cover art ==
The ''Revamp'' album features a [[pop art|pop-art]] style cover based on the [[Terry O'Neill (photographer)|Terry O'Neill]] photograph of John, recreated in [[neon]]. The ''Restoration'' artwork was created by Taupin who wanted to emphasise the role that [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] played in his and John's careers, stating:<ref name="UMG"/><blockquote>For me, there's an irony about the [[American flag]]. It's been battered and beaten and burned, but it's resilient. It's always come back. I incorporate it with other things, and lately I've done a lot of pieces with deconstructed guitars and other found materials: barbed wire, broken bottles, things that people identify with on an everyday level. If it's on the floor and it works, I'll put it into the artwork. But it all goes hand in hand with my belief in America and my interest, I would say obsession, with Americana."</blockquote>

== Reception ==
Reviews of the two albums generally favoured the country reinterpretations of the John/Taupin catalogue, with significantly greater critical praise going to Taupin's ''Restoration'' volume than to John's ''Revamp''. The [[Metacritic]] score for ''Revamp'', which averages professional reviews from a wide range of media sources, was 58, indicating "mixed or average reviews." Meanwhile, the site assigned a score of 84 to ''Restoration'', indicating "universal acclaim".

The professional consensus in favour of ''Restoration'' centered around what was perceived as this volume embracing both riskier and rootsier arrangements. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] called ''Revamp'' "slickly produced" and "dull", though giving praise to tracks cut by [[Alessia Cara]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] & [[Demi Lovato]], and [[Queens of the Stone Age]].<ref>[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine, Stephen Thomas]]. 2018. "[https://www.allmusic.com/album/revamp-reimagining-the-songs-of-elton-john-and-bernie-taupin-mw0003159826 Revamp]." ''[[AllMusic]]''.</ref>  The same reviewer noted that on ''Restoration'', "the artists take risks, and they -- and the songbook -- come out sounding the better for it."<ref>[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine, Stephen Thomas]]. 2018. "[https://www.allmusic.com/album/restoration-reimagining-the-songs-of-elton-john-and-bernie-taupin-mw0003159818 Restoration]." ''[[AllMusic]]''.</ref>

Chris Willman of [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'' magazine]], while praising individual tracks by [[Coldplay]] and [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], opined that "the list of predictably commercial names that fills out ''Revamp'' sits at the intersection of tasteful and cash-grabby" and that "this feels like an album designed more to move tickets for his farewell tour." Conversely, Willman had little but positive things to say about ''Restoration'', singling out 10 of its tracks for special praise and noting of its country feel, "with ''Restoration'', it’s a treat to get reacquainted with Las Cruces Elton."<ref>Willman, Chris. 2018. "[https://variety.com/2018/music/album-reviews/elton-john-tribute-albums-review-1202745157/ Review: Country Elton John Tribute Album Bests Its Pop Counterpart]." [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']].</ref>

[[Jody Rosen]] of [[Rolling Stone]] gave three stars to ''Revamp'', stating that the "best moments on ''Revamp'', featuring big names from pop, rock and R&B, are those least faithful to the originals." Rosen gave four stars to ''Restoration'', calling it "a revelation."<ref>[[Jody Rosen|Rosen, Jody]]. 6 April 2018. "[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/review-megastars-turn-out-for-splashy-elton-john-tributes-revamp-and-restoration-629388/ Review: Megastars Turn Out for Splashy Elton John Tributes ‘Revamp’ and ‘Restoration’]." ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.</ref> 

In a three-star review of ''Revamp'', Michael Hann of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that "When it's good, ''Revamp'' is very good. When it's bad, it's awful."<ref>Hann, Michael. 2018. "[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/06/revamp-reimagining-elton-john-review-ed-sheeran-lady-gaga Revamp: Reimagining Elton John review – Sheeran and Gaga join middling covers rehash]."
