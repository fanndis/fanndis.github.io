The '''Goddard Space Flight Center''' ('''GSFC''') is a major [[NASA]] space research laboratory located approximately {{convert|6.5|mi|km}} northeast of Washington, D.C. in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]], United States. Established on May 1, 1959 as NASA's first space flight center, GSFC employs approximately 10,000 civil servants and contractors.  It is one of ten major NASA field centers, named in recognition of American rocket propulsion pioneer [[Robert H. Goddard|Robert H. Goddard]]. GSFC is partially within the former [[Goddard, Maryland|Goddard]] [[census-designated place]]; it has a [[Greenbelt, Maryland|Greenbelt]] mailing address.<ref name=GoddardCDPMap>"[https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/blk2000/st24_Maryland/Place/2433812_Goddard/CBP2433812_001.pdf CENSUS 2000 BLOCK MAP: GODDARD CDP]."

GSFC is the largest combined organization of scientists and engineers in the United States dedicated to increasing knowledge of the [[Earth]], the [[Solar System]], and the [[Universe]] via observations from space. GSFC is a major US laboratory for developing and operating unmanned scientific spacecraft. GSFC conducts scientific investigation, development, manufacturing and operation of space systems, and development of related technologies. Goddard scientists can develop and support a mission, and Goddard engineers and technicians can design and  build the spacecraft for that mission. Goddard scientist [[John C. Mather]] shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]].

GSFC also operates two spaceflight tracking and data acquisition networks (the [[Space Network]] and the [[Near Earth Network]]), develops and maintains advanced space and Earth science data information systems, and develops satellite systems for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).

GSFC manages operations for many NASA and international missions including the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST), the [[Explorers Program]], the [[Discovery Program]], the [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS), ''[[INTEGRAL]]'', [[MAVEN]], [[OSIRIS-REx]], the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (''SOHO''), the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (''SDO''), ''[[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]]'' (TDRS)'','' ''[[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi]]'', and ''[[Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory|Swift]]''. Past missions managed by GSFC include the [[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer]] (''RXTE''), [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]], ''[[Solar Maximum Mission|SMM]]'', ''[[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]]'', ''[[International Ultraviolet Explorer|IUE]]'', and ''[[ROSAT]]''. Typically, unmanned Earth observation missions and observatories in Earth orbit are managed by GSFC,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} while unmanned planetary missions are managed by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) in [[Pasadena, California]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

== History ==
[[File:Goddard-50.PNG|right|thumb|Goddard 50th anniversary logo.]]
{{Main|History of Goddard Space Flight Center}}

Goddard is one of four [[NASA facilities|centers]] built by NASA since its founding on July 29, 1958. It is NASA's first, and oldest, [[space center]]. Its original charter was to perform five major functions on behalf of NASA: technology development and fabrication, planning, [[scientific research]], technical operations, and project management. The center is organized into several [[:wikt:directorate|directorate]]s, each charged with one of these key functions.

Until May 1, 1959, NASA's presence in Greenbelt, Maryland was known as the Beltsville Space Center. It was then renamed the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), after [[Robert H. Goddard|Robert H. Goddard]]. Its first 157 employees transferred from the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Project Vanguard]] missile program, but continued their work at the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] in Washington, D.C., while the center was under construction.

Goddard Space Flight Center contributed to [[Project Mercury]], America's first [[manned space flight]] program. The Center assumed a lead role for the project in its early days and managed the first 250 employees involved in the effort, who were stationed at [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]]. However, the size and scope of Project Mercury soon prompted NASA to build a new Manned Spacecraft Center, now the [[Johnson Space Center]], in [[Houston]], Texas. Project Mercury's personnel and activities were transferred there in 1961.

[[File:GoddardNetwork.jpg|thumb|right|The Goddard network ([[STDN]]) tracked many early manned and unmanned spacecraft.]]
Goddard Space Flight Center remained involved in the manned space flight program, providing computer support and radar tracking of flights through a worldwide network of [[ground station]]s called the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] (STDN). However, the Center focused primarily on designing unmanned [[satellite]]s and [[spacecraft]] for scientific research missions. Goddard pioneered several fields of spacecraft development, including [[modular design|modular]] spacecraft design, which reduced costs and made it possible to [[repair]] satellites in orbit. Goddard's [[Solar Maximum Mission|Solar Max]] satellite, launched in 1980, was repaired by astronauts on the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] in 1984. The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, remains in service and continues to grow in capability thanks to its modular design and multiple servicing missions by the Space Shuttle.

Today, the center remains involved in each of NASA's key programs. Goddard has developed more instruments for [[planetary exploration]] than any other organization, among them scientific instruments sent to every planet in the [[Solar System]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/code695/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321012041/http://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/code695/ |archivedate=2009-03-21 }}</ref> The center's contribution to the [[Earth Science Enterprise]] includes several spacecraft in the [[Earth Observing System]] fleet as well as [[EOSDIS]], a science data collection, processing, and distribution system. For the manned space flight program, Goddard develops tools for use by astronauts during [[extra-vehicular activity]], and operates the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]], a spacecraft designed to study the Moon in preparation for future [[Exploration of the Moon|manned exploration]].

== Missions ==
[[File:James Webb Space Telescope Revealed (26764527611).jpg|thumb|James Webb Space Telescope mirrors assembled, May 2016]]
A fact sheet highlighting many of Goddard's previous missions are recorded on a 40th anniversary webpage <ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/pdf/106025main_40th.pdf |title=NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center The First Forty Years |publisher=NASA |date=April 1999 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>

=== Past ===
Goddard has been involved in designing, building, and operating spacecraft since the days of [[Explorer 1]], the nation's first artificial satellite. The list of these missions reflects a diverse set of scientific objectives and goals. The [[Landsat]] series of spacecraft has been studying the Earth's resources since the launch of the first mission in 1972. [[Television Infrared Observation Satellite|TIROS-1]] launched in 1960 as the first success in a long series of [[weather satellite]]s. The Spartan platform deployed from the space shuttle, allowing simple, low-cost 2-3 day missions. The second of NASA's [[Great Observatories]], the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]], operated for nine years before re-entering the Earth's atmosphere in 2000. Another of Goddard's space science observatories, the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]], provided unique scientific data about the early universe.<ref>[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-evolution-of-the-universe/]</ref>

=== Present ===
Goddard currently supports the operation of dozens of spacecraft collecting scientific data. These missions include Earth science projects like the [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS) that includes the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]], [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]], and [[Aura (satellite)|Aura]] spacecraft flying alongside several projects from other Centers or other countries. Other major Earth science projects that are currently operating include the [[Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]] (TRMM) and the [[Global Precipitation Measurement]] mission (GPM), missions that provide data critical to hurricane predictions. Many Goddard projects support other organizations, such as the US Geological Survey on Landsat-7 and -8, and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) on the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]] (GOES) system that provide weather predictions.

Other Goddard missions support a variety of space science disciplines. Goddard's most famous project is the Hubble Space Telescope, a unique science platform that has been breaking new ground in astronomy for nearly 20 years. Other missions such as the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) study the structure and evolution of the universe. Other missions such as the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) are currently studying the Sun and how its behavior affects life on the Earth. The [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO) is mapping out the composition and topography of the Moon and the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (SDO) is tracking the Sun's energy and influence on the Earth.

=== Future ===
The Goddard community continually works on numerous operations and projects that have launch dates ranging from the upcoming year to a decade down the road. These operations also vary in what scientists hope they will uncover.

Particularly noteworthy operations include: the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] which will try to study the history of the universe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/future/index.html|title=NASA Missions|first=Jim|last=Wilson|date=11 June 2013|website=Nasa.gov|accessdate=11 August 2017}}</ref>

== Science ==
[[File:NASA Goddard's Innovation.ogv|thumb|In this video, two Goddard technologists explain what innovation means and why it is so important to NASA]]

'''Addressing Scientific Questions'''

NASA's missions (and therefore Goddard's missions) address a broad range of scientific questions generally classified around four key areas: Earth sciences, astrophysics, heliophysics, and the Solar System.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nasascience.nasa.gov/|title=Science Mission Directorate - Science|website=nasascience.nasa.gov|accessdate=11 August 2017}}</ref> To simplify, Goddard studies Earth and Space.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nasascience.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117171543/http://nasascience.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy |archivedate=2009-01-17 }}</ref>

Within the Earth sciences area, Goddard plays a major role in research to advance our understanding of the Earth as an environmental system, looking at questions related to how the components of that environmental system have developed, how they interact and how they evolve.  This is all important to enable scientists to understand the practical impacts of natural and human activities during the coming decades and centuries.

Within Space Sciences, Goddard has distinguished itself with the 2006 Nobel Physics Prize given to John Mather and the COBE mission.  Beyond the COBE mission, Goddard studies how the universe formed, what it is made of, how its components interact, and how it evolves. The center also contributes to research seeking to understand how stars and planetary systems form and evolve and studies the nature of the Sun's interaction with its surroundings.

'''From Scientific Questions to Science Missions'''

Based on existing knowledge accumulated through previous missions, new science questions are articulated.  Missions are developed in the same way an experiment would be developed using the scientific method.  In this context, Goddard does not work as an independent entity but rather as one of the 10 NASA centers working together to find answers to these scientific questions.

Each mission starts with a set of scientific questions to be answered, a set of scientific requirements for the mission, which build on what has already been discovered by prior missions.  Scientific requirements spell out the types data that will need to be collected.  These scientific requirements are then transformed into mission concepts that start to specify the kind of [[spacecraft]] and scientific instruments need to be developed for these scientific questions to be answered.

Within Goddard, the Sciences and Exploration Directorate (SED) leads the center's scientific endeavors, including the development of technology related to scientific pursuits.

'''Collecting Data in Space  – Scientific Instruments'''

Some of the most important technological advances developed by Goddard (and NASA in general) come from the need to innovate with new scientific instruments in order to be able to observe or measure phenomena in space that have never been measured or observed before.  Instrument names tend to be known by their initials.  In some cases, the mission's name gives an indication of the type of instrument involved.  For example, the James Webb Space Telescope is, as its name indicates, a telescope, but it includes a suite of four distinct scientific instruments: [[MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument)|Mid-Infrared Instrument]] (MIRI); [[Near-Infrared Camera]] (NIRCam); [[NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph)|Near-Infrared Spectrograph]] (NIRSpec); [[Fine Guidance Sensor and Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph]] (FGS-NIRISS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/instruments.html|title=Instruments JWST/NASA|website=Jwst.nasa.gov|accessdate=11 August 2017}}</ref> Scientists at Goddard work closely with the engineers to develop these instruments.

Typically, a mission consists of a spacecraft with an instrument suite (multiple instruments) on board. In some cases, the scientific requirements dictate the need for multiple spacecraft. For example, the [[Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission]] (MMS) studies magnetic reconnection, a 3-D process. In order to capture data about this complex 3-D process, a set of four spacecraft fly in a tetrahedral formation. Each of the four spacecraft carries identical instrument suites. MMS is part of a larger program (Solar Terrestrial Probes) that studies the impact of the Sun on the Solar System.

'''Goddard's Scientific Collaborations'''

In many cases, Goddard works with partners (US Government agencies, aerospace industry, university-based research centers, other countries) that are responsible for developing the scientific instruments.  In other cases, Goddard develops one or more of the instruments.  The individual instruments are then integrated into an instrument suite which is then integrated with the spacecraft.  In the case of MMS, for example, [[Southwest Research Institute]] (SwRI) was responsible for developing the scientific instruments and Goddard provides overall project management, mission systems engineering, the spacecraft, and mission operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swri.org/9what/releases/2007/MMS_brochure%5B1%5D%5B2%5D.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224205703/http://www.swri.org/9what/releases/2007/MMS_brochure%5B1%5D%5B2%5D.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-24 }}</ref>

On the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO), six instruments have been developed by a range of partners.  One of the instruments, the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), was developed by Goddard.  LOLA measures landing site slopes and lunar surface roughness in order to generate a 3-D map of the moon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/lola.html|title=LOLA Products|website=Lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=2017-08-11}}</ref>

Another mission to be managed by Goddard is [[MAVEN]]. MAVEN is the second mission within the [[Mars Scout Program]] that is exploring the atmosphere of Mars in support of NASA's broader efforts to go to Mars.  MAVEN carries eight instruments to measure characteristics of Mars' atmospheric gases, upper atmosphere, [[solar wind]], and [[ionosphere]].  Instrument development partners include the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Goddard contributed overall project management as well as two of the instruments, two magnetometers.

'''Managing Scientific Data'''

Once a mission is launched and reaches its destination, its instruments start collecting data.  The data is transmitted back to Earth where it needs to be analyzed and stored for future reference.  Goddard manages large collections of scientific data resulting from past and ongoing missions.

The Earth Science Division hosts the Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Division (GES DISC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/|title=GES DISC|website=daac.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=11 August 2017}}</ref> It offers Earth science data, information, and services to research scientists, applications scientists, applications users, and students.

The [[National Space Science Data Center]] (NSSDC), created at Goddard in 1966, hosts a permanent archive of space science data, including a large collection of images from space.

== Spinoff technologies ==
Section 102(d) of the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]] of 1958 calls for "the establishment of long-range studies of the potential benefits to be gained from, the opportunities for, and the problems involved in the utilization of aeronautical and space activities for peaceful and scientific purposes."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/spaceact-legishistory.pdf|title=National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, As Amended|website=History.nasa.gov|accessdate=2017-08-11}}</ref> Because of this mandate, the Technology Utilization Program was established in 1962 which required [[technology|technologies]] to be brought down to Earth and [[commercialization|commercialized]] in order to help the US economy and improve the quality of life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff2002/spin02.pdf|title=Technology Transfer|first=Loura|last=Hall|date=15 September 2016|website=Sti.nasa.gov|accessdate=11 August 2017}}</ref>

Documentation of these technologies that were spun off started in 1976 with "Spinoff 1976".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinhist.html|title=Technology Transfer|first=Loura|last=Hall|date=15 September 2016|website=Sti.nasa.gov|accessdate=11 August 2017}}</ref> Since then, NASA has produced a yearly publication of these "spinoff technologies" through the Innovative Partnerships Program Office.

Goddard Space Flight Center has made significant contributions to the US economy and quality of life with the technologies it has spun off. Here are some examples: [[Weather balloon]] technology has helped firefighters with its short-range radios; aluminized [[Mylar]] in satellites has made sports equipment more insulated; laser optics systems have transformed the camera industry and life detection missions on other planets help scientists find bacteria in contaminated food.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/spinoff/spinsearch?BOOL=AND&ALLFIELDS=&CENTER=Goddard+Space+Flight+Center&BOOLM=AND&MANUFACT=&STATE=&CATEGORY=&ISSUE=&Spinsort=ISSUED |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905050430/http://www.sti.nasa.gov/spinoff/spinsearch?BOOL=AND&ALLFIELDS=&CENTER=Goddard+Space+Flight+Center&BOOLM=AND&MANUFACT=&STATE=&CATEGORY=&ISSUE=&Spinsort=ISSUED |archivedate=2009-09-05 }}</ref>
