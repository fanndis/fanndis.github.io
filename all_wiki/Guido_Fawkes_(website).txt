==History==
In September 2004 Staines began writing an [[anonymous blog]] about [[British politics]], under the name of Guido Fawkes, an alternative name of [[Guy Fawkes]], one of the group that plotted to blow up the [[Palace of Westminster]] in 1605.<ref name="guido" >{{cite web

In 2005 Staines's blog was voted the best in the Political Commentary category of The Backbencher Political Weblog Awards, run by ''[[The Guardian]]''. This was an online poll linked to the Guido Fawkes site, and not a poll of Guardian readers specifically.<ref name="award">{{cite news

Staines reported the allegation that [[John Prescott]] was having an extramarital affair with an MP, and named the woman in question, saying that such rumours had long been shared among Westminster journalists, but that he was being less hypocritical and breaking the clique by refusing to cover up such stories.<ref name="pressgazette.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/article/110706/political_blogs_john_prescott |title=Press Gazette – Fawkes plots to blow up 'cosy' political reporting |publisher=Pressgazette.co.uk |date=14 July 2006 |accessdate=20 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819193115/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/article/110706/political_blogs_john_prescott |archivedate=19 August 2008 }}</ref> The coverage of the Prescott affair drew considerable extra traffic to Staines's blog.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.hitwise.com/heather-hopkins/2006/07/guido_fawkes_fair_and_balanced.html |title=Hitwise Intelligence – Heather Hopkins – UK: Guido Fawkes – Fair and Balanced |publisher=Weblogs.hitwise.com |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=20 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621045234/http://weblogs.hitwise.com/heather-hopkins/2006/07/guido_fawkes_fair_and_balanced.html |archivedate=21 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

He was named at number 36 in the "Top 50 newsmakers of 2006" in ''The Independent'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article2087460.ece |title=The top 50 newsmakers of 2006 |work=The Independent |date=18 December 2006 |accessdate=20 May 2010 |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201111153/http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article2087460.ece |archivedate=1 December 2007 }}</ref> for his blog, and his role in the Prescott scandal in particular. In 2011 ''[[GQ]]'' ranked him and co-author [[Harry Cole (journalist)|Harry Cole]] jointly at number 28 in the magazine's list of the 100 Most Influential Men in Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://order-order.com/2011/11/28/gq-give-guido-oxygen-of-publicity/|title=GQ Give Guido Oxygen of Publicity|work=Guido Fawkes}}</ref>

Staines encourages readers to forward political documents and information, which he publishes on his blog. One such leak was a strategy document for the [[Peter Hain]] for Deputy Leader of the Labour Party campaign. This leak caused embarrassment to Hain's campaign,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/newspolitics/tm_headline=leaked-paper-threatens-to-derail-hain-s-ambitions&method=full&objectid=18553342&siteid=50082-name_page.html |title=Leaked paper threatens to derail Hain's ambitions – icWales |publisher=Icwales.icnetwork.co.uk |date=31 January 2007 |accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> as it included information on MPs who had not gone public with their support, as well as others who were supposed to be independent.

Tottywatch<ref name="Guido Fawkes, Tottywatch" >{{cite web

|title=totty watch
|website=order-order.com}}</ref> is an irregular feature that comprises pictures of attendees at political events. Although the pictures are of both men and women, the majority are of attractive young women.

Staines' wife is referred to as Mrs Fawkes and his daughters as Miss Fawkes and Ms Fawkes.

On Monday mornings, the blog features a Monday Morning Point of View cartoon by "Rich&Mark", cartoonist [[Rich Johnston]], archived at the RichAndMark website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richandmark.com |title=RichAndMark.Com |publisher=RichAndMark.Com |accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref>

==Exposes==
===Smith Institute allegations===
Staines has made a number of posts on his blog relating to the [[Smith Institute]], a charitable thinktank set up in memory of former Labour leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], which he alleged to have engaged in party political activities (forbidden under charity law) and links to [[Gordon Brown]]. These complaints led on 1 February 2007 to a formal investigation by the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]].<ref>[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/news/smith.asp Statement on the Charity Commission and the Smith Institute], Charity Commission website, 1 February 2007</ref> The Commission threatened him with [[contempt of court]] proceedings if he did not release any documents, obtained from whistleblowers, relating to political activities by the Smith Institute.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1542699/Political-blogger-warned-he-could-be-jailed.html|title=Political blogger warned he could be jailed|last=Hope|first=Christopher|date=16 February 2007|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> Staines has stated on his blog that he intends to protect his anonymous sources,<ref name="Guido Fawkes, Sith">{{cite web

}}</ref> which has occasioned speculation that no documents or proof of Staines' allegations actually exist.

===Peter Hain===
Staines has been credited with being the first blogger to "[[scalping|take the scalp]]" of a serving British minister, following the resignation for a period of well over a year of [[Peter Hain]] from the offices of [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] and [[Secretary of State for Wales]] in January 2008.<ref>Daniel Hannan.

===Smeargate affair===
Over the weekend of 11–12 April 2009, Staines exposed in his blog that a series of e-mails had been prepared by [[Damian McBride]],  a political adviser working at [[10 Downing Street]], smearing a number of Conservative MPs which had been sent to [[Derek Draper]] for consideration for publication on the [[Red Rag]] blogsite.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/apr/14/damian-mcbride-email-smears-row1 Smeargate timeline] in [[The Guardian]], 14 April 2009.</ref> This led to the resignation of McBride and expressions of regret to the MPs concerned from the [[Prime Minister]], [[Gordon Brown]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7997464.stm |title=UK &#124; UK Politics &#124; E-mail smears handling defended |work=BBC News |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> Staines provided copies of these emails to the ''[[News of the World]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' and states that, contrary to the comments of his detractors, he did not receive any payments for this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.order-order.com/2009/04/the-backlash-begins/ |title=The Backlash Begins – Guy Fawkes' blog |website=order-order.com |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref>

His success in the McBride affair has occasioned serious criticism from him of the UK lobby correspondent system, which he believes has succumbed to the ethos of [[political spin]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6108549.ece Article by Staines] in [[The Times]], 17 April 2009.</ref>

===Leveson Inquiry===
{{main|Leveson Inquiry}}
In late November 2011 Staines posted on his Guido Fawkes blog the [[Leveson Inquiry]] pre-submission of journalist and former Labour Party press secretary [[Alastair Campbell]]. All pre-submissions are given under strict and full confidentiality, and all core participants – including victims, the [[Metropolitan Police]] and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] – are also signatories. Staines stated that he had obtained the submission legally. [[Brian Leveson|Lord Justice Leveson]] immediately called him to the inquiry to make a statement under cross-examination.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15912314 | work=BBC News | title=Blogger 'Guido Fawkes' summoned by Leveson Inquiry | date=27 November 2011}}</ref>

Staines gave written evidence denying any fault or breach of the Inquiry Act. At the start of his oral evidence to the Inquiry, Campbell admitted sending his evidence to "two or three journalists" and some friends. The order for Staines to appear was dropped.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In late December 2011 Staines was invited to give further evidence.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/feb/08/leveson-inquiry-guido-fawkes-keir-starmer | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Josh | last1=Halliday | first2=Dugald | last2=Baird | title=Leveson inquiry: Paul Staines AKA Guido Fawkes, Keir Starmer appear | date=8 February 2012}}</ref>

== Criticism and controversy ==
Staines has been criticised for his approach to blogging. He often criticises the mainstream media, claiming that they are too close to the political establishment and that they also keep internal secrets about political scandals from the public. When allegations about [[John Prescott]]'s private life appeared, Staines wrote that "You can tell it is a big story because [[Nick Robinson (journalist)|Nick Robinson]] is ignoring it". Robinson responded via his own blog,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2006/07/prescott_for_du.html|title=Nick Robinson's Newslog| last=Robinson|first=Nick|publisher=bbc.co.uk|date=5 July 2006|accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> accusing Staines of having a political agenda to damage the government. These criticisms were echoed by [[Peter Wilby]], in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', who suggested that Staines's claims to have made the news on Prescott were unfounded, as the story had previously been covered in ''[[The Times]]'', and that Staines' contribution to the debate was persistent implications of scandal without supporting evidence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200607170028 |title=New Statesman – The internet or something |work=The New Statesman |date=17 July 2006 |accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref>

[[Colin Brown (political journalist)|Colin Brown]], in response to criticisms from Staines that the media are too cosy with politicians, said: "We would love to go into print with things that we hear and believe to be true, but cannot prove, but the libel laws are such that we cannot put things into newspapers that he [Guido Fawkes] seems to think that he can get away with on the internet. They don't seem to run by the same rules".<ref name="pressgazette.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/article/110706/political_blogs_john_prescott |title=Press Gazette – Fawkes plots to blow up 'cosy' political reporting |publisher=Pressgazette.co.uk |date=14 July 2006 |accessdate=20 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819193115/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/article/110706/political_blogs_john_prescott |archivedate=19 August 2008 }}</ref> Staines responded by claiming that he is more vulnerable to libel suits than the print media are; as an individual, he does not have a large company backing him, although he says the fact that his blog is published through a [[Nevis]]-registered firm offers some protection,<ref name=esquire-20140731>{{cite news |url=http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/news/a6736/guido-fawkes-profile-westminster-paul-staines/ |title=Guido Fawkes: "The Lying In Politics Is On An Industrial Scale" |first=Edwin |last=Smith |newspaper=Esquire |date=31 July 2014 |accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> as plaintiffs are required to deposit $25,000 in court before commencing any action in Nevis.<ref name="Guido Fawkes, Rosie">{{cite web |url=http://www.order-order.com/2006/07/so-rosie-where-is-guidos-writ.html |title=So Rosie, Where is Guido's Writ? |website=order-order.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001907/http://www.order-order.com/2006/07/so-rosie-where-is-guidos-writ.html |archivedate=28 September 2007}}</ref> The same firm is majority shareholder in MessageSpace, a blog advertising network that sells advertising space on many British political blogs, including PoliticalBetting.com, [[Iain Dale]], [[ConservativeHome]], [[Labourhome]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Oliver Luft |url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story1989.shtml |title=Political bloggers launch ad initiative |publisher=Journalism.co.uk |accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref>

In a ''[[Newsnight]]'' debate with Staines, [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]] said: “You see a naive conspiratorial view of the political process and of politicians which says in effect they’re all crooks, and they all ought to be in jail, and we will fearlessly expose them on the blogsphere. And it isn’t like that... You can be pretty cavalier with the facts sometimes. Much of the blog, for people who don’t know it, this week is devoted to whether or not Gordon Brown picked his nose in, was it the budget or some other recent event? That’s been your top item.”

Staines was criticised by [[Iain Dale]] and [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]] in September 2010 for publishing rumours about [[William Hague]], alleging that he shared a hotel room with his newly appointed [[Special advisers in the United Kingdom|special advisor]]. Hague confirmed he had shared a hotel room, but denied any "improper relationship".<ref>{{cite web|author=Iain Dale|url=http://iaindale.blogspot.com/2010/09/bleak-day-for-political-blogging.html|title=A Bleak Day for Political Blogging|publisher=Iain Dale's Diary|date=1 September 2010|accessdate=2 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Michael White|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/sep/02/william-hague-shaming-day-for-fleet-street-michael-white|title=Coverage of William Hague story is a shaming day for Fleet Street|work=guardian.co.uk|date=2 September 2010|accessdate=2 September 2010|location=London}}</ref>

Later in February 2011, at the Leveson Inquiry, Staines revealed he had been paid £20,000 by the ''[[News of the World]]'' for a picture of Hague's special adviser, Christopher Myers, in a gay bar. The picture was not published by the ''News of the World''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ball|first=James|title=News of the World sources back up Guido Fawkes claims about photographs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/feb/09/news-of-the-world-guido-fawkes-hague|accessdate=9 August 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 February 2012}}</ref>

In 2012, [[RTÉ Radio 1]] broadcast a documentary about Staines, ''Our Man in Westminster'', as part of its ''Documentary On One'' series.<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Connell|first=Brian|title=Our Man in Westminster|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/doconone/documentary-podcast-guido-fawkes-paul-staines-order-order.html|website=RTÉ|accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref>
