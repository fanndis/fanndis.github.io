He is the adoptive father of Margo, Edith, and Agnes, husband of Lucy, and the boss of the Minions. At the beginning of the first film, Gru is an ambitious supervillain, and seeks approval from his mother, until the adoption of the trio convinces him that their happiness is important. In the second film, Gru leaves his villainous past behind to care for the girls, but then soon joins forces - unwillingly - with secret agent Lucy Wilde, whom he later marries. In the third film, after he and Lucy are fired from their jobs at the Anti-Villain League, Gru learns that he has a twin brother, Dru. Along with Lucy and the girls, Gru meets Dru at his mansion in Freedonia, and they form a brotherly relationship over the course of the film. Felonious Gru was originally conceived as a [[Count Dracula|Dracula]]-like character, but directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin later opted for a villain who would echo "the world of [[James Bond]], thinking of characters like [[Auric Goldfinger|Goldfinger]] and obviously the Bond-ian world of technology".<ref>[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/award-season-focus/directors-chris-renaud-and-pierre-coffin-on-creative-choices-and-challenges-in-despicable-me-films-93702.html "Directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin on Creative Choices and Challenges in 'Despicable Me' Films"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201201230413/https://www.cartoonbrew.com/award-season-focus/directors-chris-renaud-and-pierre-coffin-on-creative-choices-and-challenges-in-despicable-me-films-93702.html |date=2020-12-01 }}, cartoonbrew.com, 1 October 2014, C.

* The Girls: Three sisters, whom Gru adopts to further his scheme in the first film and gradually comes to love.
** Margo (voiced by [[Miranda Cosgrove]]): The mature oldest sister. In the first film, among the trio, Margo was the most suspicious of Gru initially; but came to trust him at the end of the film. She is something of a protectress to her sisters.
** {{anchor|Edith}} Edith (voiced by [[Dana Gaier]]): The [[tomboy]]ish middle sister; the first to enjoy Gru's eclectic possessions, when adopted by him. Practices [[martial arts]] in the second film.
** Agnes (voiced by [[Elsie Fisher]] in the first two films; Nev Scharrel in the third film): The happy-go-lucky youngest sister, and the quickest to trust Gru in the first film. She is presented as an innocent, against her more worldly sisters, and has a strong love for unicorns. In the third film, she "adopts" a one-horned goat whom she names Lucky after mistaking him for a unicorn. Even after learning he was a goat, Agnes continues to love Lucky.
* Lucy Wilde (voiced by [[Kristen Wiig]]): A cunning secret agent who has teamed up with Gru to hunt down an extremely dangerous super-villain. She loves one-upping Gru with her quirky gadgets and has perfected her own form of martial arts by combining [[jujitsu]], [[krav maga]], [[Aztec warfare]], and [[krumping]]. After 147 dates, she marries Gru and becomes the girls' mother.
* Dr. Nefario (voiced by [[Russell Brand]], JB Blanc in the video game): Gru's hearing-impaired inventor and partner-in-crime who speaks with a British accent. He seems to have a romantic interest in Gru's mother, Marlena. He is planned to join Gru, Lucy and the Girls to meet Dru in the third film, but absent from the film having accidentally frozen himself in carbonite, similar to that of [[Han Solo]] from ''[[Star Wars]]''.
* Dru (voiced by Steve Carell): Gru's charming, happy-go-lucky long-lost twin brother, who is also in the super-villain business. Dru looks just like his brother, only he has blonde hair and wears white attire. He is Lucy's brother-in-law and the adoptive uncle of Margo, Edith, and Agnes.
* Marlena (voiced by [[Julie Andrews]]): Gru and Dru's mother. Her neglect of Gru's ambitions is identified among the main reasons why he became a supervillain. In the denouement of the first film, she admits to him that he is a better parent than her. Marlena later makes a silent cameo appearance in the second film at Gru and Lucy's wedding. In the third film, Marlena reveals to Gru that after she and Gru and Dru's father divorced, they promised to never see each other again and they each got to take one son with them, with Marlena saying that she got "second pick".
* Fritz (voiced by [[Steve Coogan]]): Dru's courteous, well mannered butler who speaks with a British accent. He takes Gru, Lucy, and the girls to meet Dru at his mansion in Freedonia.
* Silas Ramsbottom (voiced by [[Steve Coogan]]): Director of the Anti-Villain League in the second film. The Minions (and Gru) make fun of his surname. In the third film, he retires from the AVL and is replaced by Valerie Da Vinci as the new Director of the AVL.
* Valerie Da Vinci (voiced by [[Jenny Slate]]): A ruthless member of the Anti-Villain League who replaces Silas Ramsbottom as Director in the third film. She fires Gru and Lucy due to them failing to capture Balthazar Bratt.

===Antagonists===
* Victor "Vector" Perkins (voiced by [[Jason Segel]], Jason Harris in the video game): The villain in the first film, Gru's rival, and the son of Mr. Perkins, the President of the Bank of Evil that supplies loans to villains in their schemes (formerly including Gru). 
* Mr. Perkins (voiced by [[Will Arnett]]): Vector's father and enormous and equally strong President of the Bank of Evil, responsible for giving out loans to villains in their schemes.
* Miss Hattie (voiced by [[Kristen Wiig]]): The charismatic but cruel owner of the orphanage from which Gru adopts his daughters. She sends Margo, Edith, and Agnes out to sell cookies and makes them sleep in cardboard boxes if they fail to meet their quota.
* Eduardo "El Macho" Perez (voiced by [[Benjamin Bratt]]): A Mexican-accented supervillain in the second film. As El Macho, he was believed to have died after strapping 250 pounds of dynamite on himself and riding a shark into an active volcano. However, it turns out that he actually faked his death, and he became the owner of a Mexican restaurant. He has a son named Antonio, with whom Margo is infatuated at first, until Antonio abandons her. It turns out that Eduardo was aware of Gru's life as a villain and plans to abduct  most of Gru's minions and turn them into hairy, purple, savage, evil minions with a dangerous chemical compound he stole called PX-41 and send the mutated Minions to major cities to take over the world. In the final battle, as Gru manages to restore the mutated Minions to normal, Eduardo drinks the compound himself, turning into a big purple furry monster to fight Gru. He is defeated by Gru and Nefario.
* Balthazar Bratt (voiced by [[Trey Parker]]): A supervillain in the third film. A former 1980s child star, he adopts the identity of his supervillain character after the onset of puberty leads to the cancellation of his television series. He is obsessed with 1980s pop culture and uses a giant robot armed with a laser and inflatable bubble gum to exact revenge on Hollywood.
* Clive (voiced by [[Andy Nyman]]): a robot who acts as Balthazar Bratt's sidekick.
* Scarlet Overkill (voiced by [[Sandra Bullock]]): In ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]'', she is the world's first female super-villain who is bent on world domination.
* Herb Overkill (voiced by [[Jon Hamm]]): Scarlet's husband and an inventor.
