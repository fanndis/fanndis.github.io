==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Testicular cancer.jpg|thumb|Image showing the first sign of testicular cancer]]
One of the first signs of testicular cancer is often a lump or swelling in the testes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for testicular cancer in asymptomatic adolescent and adults including routine testicular self-exams.<ref>{{cite web|title=Testicular Cancer: Screening|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/testicular-cancer-screening|work=uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|publisher=[[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]]|access-date=3 August 2020| date=April 2011 }}</ref> However, the American Cancer Society suggests that some men should examine their testicles monthly, especially if they have a family history of cancer, and the American Urological Association recommends monthly testicular self-examinations for all young men.<ref>{{cite web|title=Can testicular cancer be found early?|url=http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/TesticularCancer/DetailedGuide/testicular-cancer-detection|work=Testicular Cancer: Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Staging|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|access-date=4 December 2011|date=19 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Testicular Self-Examination (TSE)|url=http://www.urologyhealth.org/urology/index.cfm?article=101|publisher=[[American Urological Association]]|access-date=13 February 2013}}</ref>

*[[low back pain]] (lumbago) due to the cancer spreading to the lymph nodes along the back<ref name=harrison16th /><ref name=afp2008 />

It is not very common for testicular cancer to spread to other organs, apart from the lungs. If it has, however, the following symptoms may be present:

*shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]), [[cough]] or coughing up blood ([[hemoptysis]]) from metastatic spread to the lungs<ref name=harrison16th /><ref name=afp2008 />
*a lump in the neck due to metastases to the lymph nodes<ref name=harrison16th /><ref name=afp2008 />

Testicular cancer, [[cryptorchidism]], [[hypospadias]], and poor [[semen quality]] make up the syndrome known as [[testicular dysgenesis syndrome]].

==Causes==
A major risk factor for the development of testis cancer is [[cryptorchidism]] (undescended testicles).  It is generally believed that the presence of a tumor contributes to cryptorchidism;  when cryptorchidism occurs in conjunction with a tumor then the tumor tends to be large.  Other risk factors include [[inguinal hernia]]s, [[Klinefelter syndrome]], and<ref>{{cite journal | last = Forman | first = D | author2 = M C Pike | author3 = G Davey | author4 = S Dawson | author5 = K Baker | author6 = C E D Chilvers | author7 = R T D Oliver | author8 = C A C Coupland | date = 28 May 1994 | title = Aetiology of testicular cancer: association with congenital abnormalities, age at puberty, infertility, and exercise.

==Mechanisms==
Most testicular germ cell tumors have too many [[chromosomes]], and most often they are [[triploid]] to [[tetraploid]]. An isochromosome 12p (the short arm of chromosome 12 on both sides of the same centromere) is present in about 80% of the testicular cancers, and also the other cancers usually have extra material from this chromosome arm through other mechanisms of genomic amplification.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Atkin NB, Baker MC |title=Specific chromosome change, i(12p), in testicular tumours? |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8311 |page=1349 |date=December 1982 |pmid=6128640 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(82)91557-4|s2cid=188534 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
[[Image:Seminoma.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] (high magnification) of a [[seminoma]]. [[H&E stain]].]]
The main way testicular cancer is diagnosed is via a lump or mass inside a testis. More generally, if a young adult or adolescent has a single enlarged testicle, which may or may not be painful, this should give doctors reason to suspect testicular cancer.
[[File:S16-1063 Ranochak, T MGCT- Embryonal + Seminoma + Yolk Sac.jpg|thumb|Mixed germ cell tumor containing embryonal carcinoma, seminoma, and yolk sac tumor. The embryonal carcinoma component (upper left, upper right, and lower left) shows pseudoglandular growth with high-grade features of large, epithelioid, anaplastic cells with prominent nucleoli, indistinct cell borders with nuclear overlapping, pleomorphism, and frequent mitoses. The seminoma component (upper center) shows large, round-polyhedral cells with distinct cell membranes, abundant clear/watery cytoplasm, large central nuclei and prominent nucleoli. The yolk sac component (lower right, hugging the embryonal component) exhibits microcystic/reticular growth pattern.]]
Other conditions may also have symptoms similar to testicular cancer:
*[[Epididymitis]] or [[Epididymitis|epididymoorchitis]]
*[[Hematocele]]
*[[Varicocele]]
*[[Orchitis]]
*Prostate infections or inflammations ([[prostatitis]]), bladder infections or inflammations ([[cystitis]]), or kidney (renal) infections ([[nephritis]]) or inflammations which have spread to and caused swelling in the vessels of the testicles or scrotum
*[[Testicular torsion]] or a [[hernia]]
*Infection, inflammation, retro-[[peritonitis]], or other conditions of the lymph nodes or vessels near the scrotum, testicles, pubis, anorectal area, and groin
*Benign tumors or lesions of the testicles
*Metastasis to the testicles from another, primary tumor site(s)

The nature of any palpated lump in the [[scrotum]] is often evaluated by scrotal [[ultrasound]], which can determine exact location, size, and some characteristics of the lump, such as cystic vs solid, uniform vs heterogeneous, sharply circumscribed or poorly defined. The extent of the disease is evaluated by [[CT scan]]s, which are used to locate [[metastasis|metastases]].

The [[differential diagnosis]] of testicular cancer requires examining the [[histology]] of tissue obtained from an [[inguinal orchiectomy]] - that is, surgical excision of the entire [[testis]] along with attached structures ([[epididymis]] and [[spermatic cord]]). A [[biopsy]] should not be performed, as it raises the risk of spreading cancer cells into the scrotum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/testicular-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/how-diagnosed.html|title=How is testicular cancer diagnosed}}</ref>

Inguinal orchiectomy is the preferred method because it lowers the risk of cancer cells escaping. This is because the lymphatic system of the scrotum, through which white blood cells (and, potentially, cancer cells) flow in and out, links to the lower extremities, while that of the testicle links to the back of the abdominal cavity (the [[retroperitoneum]]).  A transscrotal biopsy or orchiectomy will potentially leave cancer cells in the scrotum and create two routes for cancer cells to spread, while in an inguinal orchiectomy only the retroperitoneal route exists.

Blood tests are also used to identify and measure [[tumor marker]]s (usually [[protein]]s present in the bloodstream) that are specific to testicular cancer. [[Alpha-fetoprotein]], [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (the "pregnancy hormone"), and [[Lactate dehydrogenase|LDH-1]] are the typical tumor markers used to spot testicular germ cell tumors.

A [[pregnancy test]] may be used to detect high levels of chorionic gonadotropin; however, the first sign of testicular cancer is usually a painless lump.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Health/CancerPreventionAndTreatment/pregnancy-test-man-joke-reveals-testicular-cancer/story?id=17653036#.UJqDuG80UR8|title=Pregnancy Test, Used by a Man as Joke, Reveals Testicular Cancer - ABC News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}</ref> Note that only about 25% of seminomas have elevated chorionic gonadotropin, so a pregnancy test is not very sensitive for making out testicular cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-tumor-markers-in-testicular-germ-cell-tumors|title=Serum tumor markers in testicular germ cell tumors}}</ref>

===Screening===
The [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] recommends against screening males without symptoms for testicular cancer.<ref>{{cite web |title=American Academy of Family Physicians {{!}} Choosing Wisely |url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/societies/american-academy-of-family-physicians/ |website=www.choosingwisely.org |access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref>

===Staging===
After removal, the testicle is fixed with [[Bouin Solution|Bouin's solution]]<ref>{{cite journal|title=DNA and RNA obtained from Bouin's fixed tissues|date=29 September 2011|pmc=1770606|volume=58|issue=3|pmid=15735167|last1=Bonin|first1=S|last2=Petrera|first2=F|last3=Rosai|first3=J|last4=Stanta|first4=G|pages=313–6|doi=10.1136/jcp.2004.016477|journal=Journal of Clinical Pathology}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wollina | first1 = U. | last2 = Schreiber | first2 = G. | last3 = Zollmann | first3 = C. | last4 = Hipler | first4 = C. | last5 = Günther | first5 = E. | title = Lectin-binding sites in normal human testis | journal = Andrologia | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–130 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2469362 | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0272.1989.tb02380.x | s2cid = 83758571 }}</ref> because it better conserves some morphological details such as nuclear conformation. Then the testicular tumor is staged by a [[pathologist]] according to the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors as published in the [[American Joint Committee on Cancer|AJCC]] Cancer Staging Manual.  Testicular cancer is categorized as being in one of three [[Cancer staging|stages]] ([[TNM staging system|which have subclassifications]]).  The size of the tumor in the testis is irrelevant to staging.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancerstaging.org/cstage/CSPart1Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-11-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011104151/http://www.cancerstaging.org/cstage/CSPart1Manual.pdf |archive-date=11 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  In broad terms, testicular cancer is staged as follows:
*Stage I: the cancer remains localized to the [[testis]].
*Stage II: the cancer involves the testis and [[metastasis]] to [[Retroperitoneum|retroperitoneal]] and/or [[paraaortic lymph node]]s ([[lymph node]]s below the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]).
*Stage III: the cancer involves the testis and [[metastasis]] beyond the [[Retroperitoneum|retroperitoneal]] and [[paraaortic lymph node]]s.  Stage 3 is further subdivided into non-bulky stage 3 and bulky stage 3.<ref name="titleTesticular Cancer Resource Center's Staging Page">{{cite web |url=http://tcrc.acor.org/staging.html |title=Testicular Cancer Resource Center's Staging Page |access-date=13 December 2007 }}</ref>

Further information on the detailed staging system is available on the website of the [[American Cancer Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/TesticularCancer/DetailedGuide/testicular-cancer-staging|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|title=How is testicular cancer staged?|access-date=12 July 2011|date=19 January 2011|work=cancer.org}}</ref>

===Classification===
{{update|inaccurate=yes|reason=New WHO classification (2016)|date=May 2017}}
Although testicular cancer can be derived from any cell type found in the testicles, more than 95% of testicular cancers are [[germ cell tumor]]s (GCTs).  Most of the remaining 5% are [[sex cord–gonadal stromal tumour]]s derived from [[Leydig cell]]s or [[Sertoli cell]]s.  Correct diagnosis is necessary to ensure the most effective and appropriate treatment.  To some extent, this can be done via blood tests for [[tumor marker]]s, but definitive diagnosis requires examination of the [[histology]] of a specimen by a [[pathologist]].

Most pathologists use the [[World Health Organization]] classification system for testicular tumors:<ref>Eble J.N., Sauter G., Epstein J.I., Sesterhenn I.A.

==Treatment==
The three basic types of treatment are [[surgery]], [[radiation therapy]], and [[chemotherapy]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/testicular/HealthProfessional/page8| title=Testicular Cancer Treatment (PDQ)| work=National Cancer Institute| date=15 January 2009| access-date=13 February 2009}}</ref>

Surgery is performed by [[urologist]]s; radiation therapy is administered by [[radiation oncologist]]s; and chemotherapy is the work of medical [[oncologist]]s. In most patients with testicular cancer, the disease is cured readily with minimal long-term [[morbidity]]. While treatment success depends on the stage, the average survival rate after five years is around 95%, and stage 1 cancer cases, if monitored properly, have essentially a 100% survival rate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/testicular-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html|title=Testicular Cancer Survival Rates|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2018-01-18}}</ref>

=== Testicle removal ===
The initial treatment for testicular cancer is surgery to remove the affected testicle ([[orchiectomy]]). While it may be possible, in some cases, to remove testicular cancer tumors from a testis while leaving the testis functional, this is almost never done, as the affected testicle usually contains pre-cancerous cells spread throughout the entire testicle. Thus removing the tumor alone without additional treatment greatly increases the risk that another cancer will form in that testicle.

Since only one testis is typically required to maintain fertility, hormone production, and other male functions, the afflicted testis is almost always removed completely in a procedure called [[inguinal orchiectomy]]. (The testicle is almost never removed through the scrotum; an incision is made beneath the belt line in the inguinal area.)  In the UK, the procedure is known as a radical orchidectomy.

===Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection===
In the case of [[nonseminoma]]s that appear to be stage I, surgery may be done on the [[Retroperitoneum|retroperitoneal]]/[[Paraaortic lymph node|paraaortic]] [[lymph node]]s (in a separate operation) to accurately determine whether the cancer is in stage I or stage II and to reduce the risk that [[malignant]] testicular cancer cells that may have [[Metastasis|metastasized]] to lymph nodes in the lower abdomen.  This surgery is called [[retroperitoneal lymph node dissection]] (RPLND).  However, this approach, while standard in many places, especially the United States, is out of favor due to costs and the high level of expertise required to perform successful surgery. Sperm banking is frequently carried out prior to the procedure (as with chemotherapy), as there is a risk that RPLND may damage the nerves involved in ejaculation, causing ejaculation to occur internally into the bladder rather than externally.

Many patients are instead choosing surveillance, where no further surgery is performed unless tests indicate that the cancer has returned. This approach maintains a high cure rate because of the growing accuracy of surveillance techniques.

=== Adjuvant treatment ===
Since testicular cancers can spread, patients are usually offered [[adjuvant therapy|adjuvant treatment]] - in the form of [[chemotherapy]] or [[radiotherapy]] - to kill any cancerous cells that may exist outside of the affected testicle. The type of adjuvant therapy depends largely on the [[histology]] of the tumor (i.e. the size and shape of its cells under the microscope) and the stage of progression at the time of surgery (i.e. how far cells have 'escaped' from the testicle, invaded the surrounding tissue, or spread to the rest of the body). If the cancer is not particularly advanced, patients may be offered careful surveillance by periodic [[CT scans]] and blood tests, in place of adjuvant treatment.

Before 1970, survival rates from testicular cancer were low. Since the introduction of [[adjuvant therapy|adjuvant chemotherapy]], chiefly platinum-based drugs like [[cisplatin]] and [[carboplatin]], the outlook has improved substantially. Although 7000 to 8000 new cases of testicular cancer occur in the United States yearly, only 400 men are expected to die of the disease.

In the UK, a similar trend has emerged: since improvements in treatment, survival rates have risen rapidly to cure rates of over 95%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Testicular Cancer survival statistics|url=http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/testis/survival/|work=cancerresearchuk.org|publisher=[[Cancer Research UK]]|access-date=4 December 2011|date=9 October 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224185202/http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/testis/survival/|archive-date=24 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Radiation therapy===
[[Radiation]] may be used to treat stage II seminoma cancers, or as [[adjuvant]] (preventative) therapy in the case of stage I seminomas, to minimize the likelihood that tiny, non-detectable tumors exist and will spread (in the inguinal and para-aortic [[lymph nodes]]).  Radiation is ineffective against and is therefore never used as a primary therapy for [[nonseminoma]].

===Chemotherapy===

==== Non-seminoma ====

Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for non-seminoma when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (that is, stage 2B or 3).  The standard [[chemotherapy protocol]] is three, or sometimes four, rounds of [[Bleomycin]]-[[Etoposide]]-[[Cisplatin]] (BEP). BEP as a first-line treatment was first reported by Professor [[Michael Peckham]] in 1983.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Peckham | first1 = MJ | last2 = Barrett | first2 = A | last3 = Liew | first3 = KH | last4 = Horwich | first4 = A | last5 = Robinson | first5 = B | last6 = Dobbs | first6 = HJ | last7 = McElwain | first7 = TJ | last8 = Hendry | first8 = WF | year = 1983 | title = The treatment of metastatic germ-cell testicular tumours with bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP). | journal = British Journal of Cancer | volume = 47 | pages = 613–619 | pmid = 6189504 | pmc = 2011384 | doi = 10.1038/bjc.1983.99 | issue = 5 }}</ref> The landmark trial published in 1987 which established BEP as the optimum treatment was conducted by Dr. [[Lawrence Einhorn]] at [[Indiana University]].<ref name="Chemotherapy - BEP and EP">{{cite web |url=http://www.tc-library.com/chemotherapy-bep-and-ep/ |title=Chemotherapy - BEP and EP |access-date=16 February 2009 }}</ref> An alternative, equally effective treatment involves the use of four cycles of [[Etoposide]]-[[Cisplatin]] (EP).

Lymph node surgery may also be performed after chemotherapy to remove masses left behind (stage 2B or more advanced), particularly in the cases of large [[nonseminoma]]s.

==== Seminoma ====

As an [[adjuvant]] treatment, use of [[chemotherapy]] as an alternative to radiation therapy in the treatment of seminoma is increasing, because radiation therapy appears to have more significant long-term side effects (for example, internal scarring, increased risks of secondary malignancies, etc.).  Two doses, or occasionally a single dose of [[carboplatin]], typically delivered three weeks apart, is proving to be a successful [[adjuvant]] treatment, with recurrence rates in the same ranges as those of [[radiotherapy]]. The concept of [[carboplatin]] as a single-dose therapy was developed by Tim Oliver, Professor of Medical Oncology at [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=MRC trial shows single dose of drug is as effective as two weeks' radiotherapy for testicular cancer|url=http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Newspublications/News/MRC001863|work=News and Publications|publisher=[[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]|access-date=4 December 2011|date=22 July 2005}}</ref> However, very long-term data on the efficacy of adjuvant carboplatin in this setting do not exist.

Since seminoma can recur decades after the primary tumor is removed, patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy should remain vigilant and not assume they are cured 5 years after treatment.

==Prognosis==
Treatment of testicular cancer is one of the success stories of modern medicine, with sustained response to treatment in more than 90% of cases, regardless of stage.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1056/NEJMbkrev59744 |last= Huang |first= William C. |date= 5 June 2008 |title= Book Review: Urological Oncology |journal= [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume= 358 |issue= 23 |page= 2527 |issn= 1533-4406 }}</ref> In 2011 overall cure rates of more than 95% were reported, and 80% for metastatic disease—the best response by any solid tumor, with improved survival being attributed primarily to effective chemotherapy.<ref name=JAMA2008/>  By 2013 more than 96 per cent of the 2,300 men diagnosed each year in the U.K. were deemed cured, a rise by almost a third since the 1970s, the improvement attributed substantially to the chemotherapy drug [[cisplatin]].<ref name=TheTimes20130729>{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/news/article3828058.ece |title=Male cancer is almost beaten after chance find |last=Whipple |first=Tom |date=29 July 2013 |newspaper=The Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729165213/http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/news/article3828058.ece |archive-date=29 July 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the United States, when the disease is treated while it is still localized, more than 99% of people survive 5 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=SEER Stat Fact Sheets: Testis Cancer|url=http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/testis.html|website=National Cancer Institute|access-date=18 March 2016}}</ref>

===Surveillance===
For many patients with stage I cancer, adjuvant (preventative) therapy following surgery may not be appropriate and patients will undergo surveillance instead.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Krege |first1=S. |last2=Beyer |first2=J. |last3=Souchon |first3=R. |last4=Albers |first4=P. |last5=Albrecht |first5=W. |last6=Algaba |first6=F. |last7=Bamberg |first7=Michael |last8=Bodrogi |first8=István |last9=Bokemeyer |first9=Carsten | display-authors=6 |title=European consensus conference on diagnosis and treatment of germ cell cancer: a report of the second meeting of the European Germ Cell Cancer Consensus group (EGCCCG): part I |journal=European Urology |year=2008 |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=478–496 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2007.12.024 |pmid=18191324 }}</ref> The form this surveillance takes, e.g. the type and frequency of investigations and the length time it should continue, will depend on the type of cancer ([[Nonseminoma|non-seminoma]] or [[seminoma]]), but the aim is to avoid unnecessary treatments in the many patients who are cured by their surgery, and ensure that any relapses with [[metastasis|metastases]] (secondary cancers) are detected early and cured. This approach ensures that chemotherapy and or radiotherapy is only given to the patients that need it. The number of patients ultimately cured is the same using surveillance as post-operative “adjuvant” treatments, but the patients have to be prepared to follow a prolonged series of visits and tests.

For both non-seminomas and seminomas, surveillance tests generally include physical examination, blood tests for tumor markers, chest x-rays and [[CT Scan|CT scanning]].  However, the requirements of a surveillance program differ according to the type of disease since, for seminoma patients, relapses can occur later and blood tests are not as good at indicating relapse.

CT scans are performed on the abdomen (and sometimes the pelvis) and also the chest in some hospitals. Chest x-rays are increasingly preferred for the lungs as they give sufficient detail combined with a lower false-positive rate and significantly smaller radiation dose than CT.

The frequency of CT scans during surveillance should ensure that relapses are detected at an early stage while minimizing the radiation exposure.

For patients treated for stage I non-seminoma, a randomised trial ([[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] TE08)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rustin |first1=G. J. |last2=Mead |first2=G. M. |last3=Stenning |first3=S. P. |last4=Vasey |first4=P. A. |last5=Aass |first5=N. |last6=Huddart |first6=R. A. |last7=Sokal |first7=M. P. |last8=Joffe |first8=J. K. |last9=Harland |first9=S. J. |last10=Kirk |first10=S. J. |display-authors=6 |title=Randomized trial of two or five computed tomography scans in the surveillance of patients with stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis: Medical Research Council Trial TE08; ISRCTN56475197—the National Cancer Research Institute Testis Cancer Clinical Studies Group |journal=[[Journal of Clinical Oncology]] |year=2007 |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=1310–1315 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2006.08.4889 |pmid=17416851 }}</ref> showed that, when combined with the standard surveillance tests described above, 2 CT scans at 3 and 12 months were as good as 5 over 2 years in detecting relapse at an early stage.

For patients treated for stage I seminoma who choose surveillance rather than undergoing adjuvant therapy, there have been no randomized trials to determine the optimum frequency of scans and visits, and the schedules vary very widely across the world, and within individual countries. In the UK there is an ongoing clinical trial called TRISST.<ref>{{cite web|title=A trial to find the best way of using scans to monitor men after treatment for seminoma testicular cancer (TRISST MRC TE24)|url=http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/trials/a-trial-to-find-the-best-way-of-using-scans-to-monitor-men-after-treatment-for-seminoma-testicular-cancer|work=CancerHelp UK|publisher=[[Cancer Research UK]]|access-date=4 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Would it be better to use MRI scans instead of CT scans to monitor men with early stage testicular cancer?

MRI is being investigated because it does not expose the patient to radiation and so, if it is shown to be as good at detecting relapses, it may be preferable to CT.

For more advanced stages of testicular cancer, and for those cases in which radiation therapy or chemotherapy was administered, the extent of monitoring (tests) after treatment will vary on the basis of the circumstances, but normally should be done for five years in uncomplicated cases and for longer in those with higher risks of relapse.

===Fertility===
A man with one remaining testis may maintain fertile.  However, sperm banking may be appropriate for men who still plan to have children, since fertility may be adversely affected by [[chemotherapy]] and/or [[radiotherapy]].  A man who [[castration|loses both testicles]] will be infertile after the procedure, though he may elect to bank viable, cancer-free sperm prior to the procedure.

==Epidemiology==
Globally testicular cancer resulted in 8,300 deaths in 2013 up from 7,000 deaths in 1990.<ref name=GDB2013/> Testicular cancer has the highest prevalence in the U.S. and Europe, and is uncommon in Asia and Africa.<ref name="ACS"/>  Worldwide incidence has doubled since the 1960s, with the highest rates of prevalence in [[Scandinavia]], [[Germany]], and [[New Zealand]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Although testicular cancer is most common among men aged 15–40 years, it has three peaks: infancy through the age of four as [[teratoma]]s and [[yolk sac tumor]]s, ages 25–40 years as post-pubertal seminomas and nonseminomas, and from age 60 as spermatocytic tumors.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Leendert H.

==Other animals==
Testicular tumors occur also in animals.  In [[horse]]s, these include [[interstitial cell tumor]]s and teratomas.  Typically, the former are found in older [[stallion]]s (affected stallions may become extremely vicious, suggesting excessive production of [[androgen]]), and the latter are found in young horses and are large.<ref>{{cite book | title = Veterinary pathology | vauthors = Jones TC, Hunt RD, King NW | edition = 6th | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780683044812 | page = 1210 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8fXzJrDfFgUC }}</ref>
