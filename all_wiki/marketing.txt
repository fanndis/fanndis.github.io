Marketing is profitably using the results of studying short term and long term needs of those who can pay for a one-time, or in most cases, a steady flow of service or product placement. In 2017 ''The New York Times'' described it as "the art of telling stories so enthralling that people lose track of their wallets.<ref>{{cite newspaper

The term marketing, what is commonly known as attracting customers, incorporates knowledge gained by studying the [[management]] of [[Exchange (economics)|exchange]] [[Relationship marketing|relationships]]<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hunt |first=Shelby D. |date=July 1976 |title=The Nature and Scope of Marketing |journal=[[Journal of Marketing]] |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=17–28 |doi=10.2307/1249990 |jstor=1249990}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/1250593 |jstor=1250593

==Definition==
Marketing is defined by the [[American Marketing Association]] as "the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large".<ref>Marketing definition approved in October 2007 by the [[American Marketing Association]]: [https://www.ama.org/AboutAMA/Pages/Definition-of-Marketing.aspx] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709204356/https://www.ama.org/AboutAMA/Pages/Definition-of-Marketing.aspx |date=9 July 2014 }}.</ref> The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to market with goods for sale. From a [[sales process engineering]] perspective, marketing is "a set of processes that are interconnected and interdependent with other functions of a business aimed at achieving customer interest and satisfaction".<ref name="Selden 1997">{{cite book|title=Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop |author = Paul H. Selden|publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location = Milwaukee, WI|year=1997|page =23}}</ref>''

[[Philip Kotler]] defined marketing as "Satisfying needs and wants through an exchange process".<ref name=yorkmarketing>{{cite web|url=http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~aew6/Courses/CE%20Module/PDF%20Files/market.pdf|title=University of York Introduction To Marketing | access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> and a decade later defines it as "a social and managerial process by which individuals and groups obtain what they want and need through creating, offering and exchanging products of value with others".<ref name=yorkmarketing>{{cite web|url=http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~aew6/Courses/CE%20Module/PDF%20Files/market.pdf|title=University of York Introduction To Marketing | access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref>

The [[Chartered Institute of Marketing]] defines marketing as "the management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer requirements profitably".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cim.co.uk/resources/understandingmarket/definitionmkting.aspx|title=Marketing library resources – content, knowledge databases |publisher= CIM|accessdate=16 March 2017}}</ref> A similar concept is the [[value-based marketing]] which states the role of marketing to contribute to increasing [[shareholder value]].<ref name="paliwoda-a">{{cite book

In the past, marketing practice tended to be seen as a creative industry, which included [[advertising]], [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] and [[sales|selling]]. However, because the academic study of marketing makes extensive use of [[social sciences]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[mathematics]], [[economics]], [[anthropology]] and [[neuroscience]], the profession is now widely recognized as a science,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/women2/2012/06/05/the-science-of-marketing/#81ce1a97a0a6|title=The Science of Marketing|last=2.0|first=Women|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-06-16}}</ref> allowing numerous universities to offer Master-of-Science (MSc) programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.masterstudies.com/MSc/Marketing/|title=Best Masters of Science (MScs) in Marketing 2017/2018|website=www.masterstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-27}}</ref>

The process of marketing is that of bringing a product to market, which includes these steps: broad market research; market targeting and [[market segmentation]]; determining distribution, pricing and promotion strategies; developing a communications strategy; budgeting; and visioning long-term market development goals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dummies.com/business/marketing/10-steps-to-creating-a-marketing-plan-for-your-small-business/|title=10 Steps to Creating a Marketing Plan for Your Small Business |work=Dummies|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en-US}}</ref> Many parts of the marketing process (e.g. [[product design]], [[art director]], [[brand management]], [[advertising]], [[inbound marketing]], [[copywriting]] etc.) involve use of the creative arts.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Subin|first=Im|title=Market Orientation, Creativity, and New Product Performance in High-Technology Firms|publisher=Journal of Marketing|year=2004|pages=114–132}}</ref>

==Concept==
The 'marketing concept' proposes that to complete its organizational objectives, an organization should anticipate the needs and wants of potential consumers and satisfy them more effectively than its competitors. This concept originated from Adam Smith's book ''The Wealth of Nations'' but would not become widely used until nearly 200 years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netmba.com/marketing/concept/|title=Marketing Concept|last=NetMBA.com|website=www.netmba.com|access-date=2017-11-08}}</ref> Marketing and Marketing Concepts are directly related.

Given the centrality of customer needs, and wants in marketing, a rich understanding of these concepts is essential:<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Weeks|first1=Richard|last2=Marx|first2=William|date=Autumn 1968|title=The Market Concept: Problems and Promises|journal=Business & Society|volume=9|pages=39–42|doi=10.1177/000765036800900106|s2cid=154456073}}</ref>

: ''[[Needs]]:'' Something necessary for people to live a healthy, stable and safe life. When needs remain unfulfilled, there is a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death. Needs can be objective and physical, such as the need for food, water, and shelter; or subjective and psychological, such as the need to belong to a family or social group and the need for self-esteem.
: ''[[Wants]]:'' Something that is desired, wished for or aspired to. Wants are not essential for basic survival and are often shaped by culture or peer-groups.
: ''[[Demand]]s:'' When needs and wants are backed [[Purchasing power|by the ability to pay]], they have the potential to become economic demands.

[[Marketing research]], conducted for the purpose of new product development or product improvement, is often concerned with identifying the consumer's ''unmet needs.''<ref name="Hague, 19-20">{{Cite book |title=Market Research in Practice: How to Get Greater Insight From Your Market |last1=Hague |first1=Paul N. |last2=Hague |first2=Nicholas |last3=Morgan |first3=Carol-Ann |publisher=Kogan-Page |year=2013 |location=London |pages=19–20}}</ref> Customer needs are central to market segmentation which is concerned with dividing markets into distinct groups of buyers on the basis of "distinct needs, characteristics, or behaviors who might require separate products or marketing mixes."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=W.R.|date=July 1956|title=Product Differentiation and Market Segmentation as Alternative Marketing Strategies|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–8|doi=10.1177/002224295602100102|s2cid=49060196|url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2664/435c9eb4169c9e6afffa8bd0d08684d853d3.pdf}}</ref> Needs-based segmentation (also known as ''benefit segmentation'') "places the customers' desires at the forefront of how a company designs and markets products or services."<ref>{{Citation |title=What Comes Next?

== B2B and B2C Marketing ==
The two major segments of marketing are business-to-business (B2B) marketing and business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing.<ref name=":0" />

=== B2B marketing ===
B2B (business-to-business) marketing refers to any marketing strategy or content that is geared towards a business or organization. Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies.

Examples of products sold through B2B marketing include:

* Major equipment
* Accessory equipment
* Raw materials
* Component parts
* Processed materials
* Supplies
* Business services<ref name=":0" />

The four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:

* Producers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys)
* Resellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)
* Governments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)
* Institutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use)<ref name=":0" />

=== B2C marketing ===
Business-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.

Traditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Business News Daily Editor, Exp |title=What is B2C? |url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5085-what-is-b2c.html |website=Business News Daily |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>

=== C2B marketing ===
Consumer-to-business marketing or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposed to the popular concept of B2C or Business- to- Consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.

=== C2C marketing ===
[[Customer to customer]] marketing or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tarver |first1=Evan |title=Customer to Customer – C2C |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ctoc.asp |website=Investopedia |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>

=== Differences in B2B and B2C marketing ===
The different goals of B2B and B2C marketing lead to differences in the B2B and B2C markets. The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, number of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.<ref name=":0" />

*Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customer's wants and needs. B2C demand is primarily because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.<ref name=":0" />
*Purchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.<ref name=":0" />
*Number of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.<ref name=":0" />
*Customer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.<ref name=":0" />
*Distribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.<ref name=":0" />
*Buying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.<ref name=":0" />
*Buying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.<ref name=":0" />
*Negotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.<ref name=":0" />
*Reciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business's printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.<ref name=":0" />
*Leasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.<ref name=":0" />
*Promotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.<ref name=":0" />

== Orientations ==
{{main|History of marketing#Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice}}
A marketing orientation has been defined as a "philosophy of business management."<ref name=":5">Mc Namara (1972) cited in Deshpande, R., ''Developing a Market Orientation'', Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 1999, p. 11</ref> or "a corporate state of mind"<ref>Kohli, A.K. and Jaworski, B.J., "Market Orientation: The Construct, Research Propositions, and Managerial Implications," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 54, April 1990, pp. 1–18</ref> or as an "organisation[al] culture"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Narver | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Slater | first2 = S.F. | title = The Effect of a Market Orientation on Business Profitability | journal = Journal of Marketing | year = 1990 | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 20–34 | doi = 10.2307/1251757 | jstor = 1251757 }}</ref> Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific orientations that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hollander | first1 = S.C. | last2 = Jones | first2 = D.G.B. | last3 = Dix | first3 = L. | title = Periodization in Marketing History | journal = Journal of Macromarketing | year = 2005 | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 33–39 | doi = 10.1177/0276146705274982 | s2cid = 9997002 }}</ref>

* Product oriented: mainly concerned with the quality of its product. It has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, except for haute couture and arts marketing.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1362/146934706776861573|title = Art for Art's Sake or Art for Business Sake: An exploration of artistic product orientation| journal=The Marketing Review| volume=6| pages=29–40|year = 2006|last1 = Fillis|first1 = Ian}}</ref><ref>Sheth, J., Sisodia, R.S. and Sharma, A., "The Antecedents and Consequences of Customer-Centric Marketing," ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 28, No. 1, 2000, p. 55</ref>

* Production oriented: specializes in producing as much as possible of a given product or service in order to achieve [[economies of scale]] or [[economies of scope]]. It dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, yet can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically, Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is "one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations."<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 28</ref>
* Sales or sales-orientation: focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm's existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants primarily through promotion and direct sales techniques,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Kotler|first=Philip|publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc.|year=1980 |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ}}</ref> largely for "unsought goods"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 29</ref> in industrial companies.<ref>Avlonitis, G.J. and Gounaris, S.P., "Marketing Orientation and Company Performance: Industrial vs. Consumer Goods Companies," ''Industrial Marketing Management,'' Vol. 26, 1997, pp. 385–402</ref> A 2011 meta analyses<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s11747-010-0211-8

* Marketing/[[Market orientation]]: This is the most common orientation used in contemporary marketing, and is a customer-centric approach based on products that suit new consumer tastes. These firm engage in extensive [[market research]], use R&D (Research & Development), and then utilize promotion techniques.<ref>McGee, L.W. and Spiro, R.L., "The Marketing Concept in Perspective," ''Business Horizons, May–June 1988, pp. 40–45</ref><ref>Hooley, G., Fahy, J., Beracs, J., Fonfara, K. and Snoj, B., "Market Orientation in the Transition Economies of Central Europe: Tests of the Narver and Slater Market Orientation Scales," ''Journal of Business Research,'' Vol. 50, 2000, pp. 273–85. Note that the most widely applied scale is that developed by Narver and Slater in Narver, J.C., and Slater, S.F., ''The Effect of Marketing Orientation on Business Profitability," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vo. 54, 1990, pp. 20–35</ref> The marketing orientation includes:
** ''Customer orientation'': A firm in the [[market economy]] can survive by producing [[goods]] that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining [[consumer demand]] is vital for a [[business entity|firm]]'s future viability and even existence as a [[going concern]].
** ''Organizational orientation'': The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments. A marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires. The production department would then start to manufacture the product. The finance department may oppose required capital expenditures since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.

===Societal marketing===
{{main|Societal marketing}}
Social responsibility that goes beyond satisfying customers and providing superior [[Value (marketing)|value]] embraces societal stakeholders such as employees, customers, and local communities. Companies that adopt this perspective typically practice [[triple bottom line]] reporting and publish financial, social and environmental impact reports. Sustainable marketing or [[green marketing]] is an extension of societal marketing.<ref>, Blackwell Reference, [https://www.econbiz.de/Record/what-consumerism-means-for-marketers-kotler-philip/10002240532 Kotler, P., "What consumerism means for marketers"], ''Harvard Business Review'', vol. 50, no. 3, 1972, pp. 48–57; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., "Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp. 224–32 {{doi|10.1177/0276146706291067}}; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the "4 Eras" of Thought Development," ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp. 116–46</ref>

==The Marketing Mix==
{{Main|Marketing mix}}
A marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools that marketers can use to bring their products or services to the market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the [[marketing plan]] typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.

===The 4Ps ===

The traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: ''product'', ''price'', ''promotion'', and ''place''.<ref name=":6">{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing. A Managerial Approach|year=1964|publisher=Irwin|location=Homewood, IL}}</ref><ref>Grönroos, Christian. "From Marketing Mix to Relationship Marketing: Towards a Paradigm Shift in Marketing," ''Management Decision,'' vol. 32, no. 2, 1994, pp. 4–20.</ref>
[[File:Marketing Mix 4P.svg|alt=The 4Ps of the marketing mix stand for product, price, place and promotion|thumb|278x278px|One version of the marketing mix is the 4Ps method.]]

==== Outline ====

;[[Product (business)|Product]]
: The product aspects of marketing deal with the specifications of the actual goods or services, and how it relates to the [[end-user]]'s needs and wants. The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. [[Brand]]ing, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, [[brand]], or company.<ref name=":1" />
;[[Pricing]]: This refers to the process of setting a [[price]] for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention or any sacrifices consumers make in order to acquire a product or service. The price is the cost that a consumer pays for a product—monetary or not. Methods of setting prices are in the domain of [[pricing science]].<ref name=":2" />
; Place (or [[distribution (business)|distribution]]): This refers to how the product gets to the customer; the distribution channels and intermediaries such as wholesalers and [[retailer]]s who enable customers to access products or services in a convenient manner. This third P has also sometimes been called ''Place'' or ''Placement'', referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales.<ref name=":2" />
;[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]:This includes all aspects of marketing communications; [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], including [[promotional education]], [[public relations]], [[sales|personal selling]], [[product placement]], [[branded entertainment]], event marketing, trade shows and [[exhibitions]]. This fourth P is focused on providing a message to get a response from consumers.  The message is designed to persuade or tell a story to create awareness.<ref name=":2">Borden, N., "The Concept of the Marketing Mix," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' June 1964 pp. 2–7; van Waterschoot, W. and van den Bulte, C., "The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, No. 4, 1992, pp. 83–93</ref>

==== Criticisms ====
One of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis of an inside out-view.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Waves of Change|last=Gareth|first=Morgan|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1988|isbn=978-1555420932|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingwavesofcha00morg}}</ref> An ''inside-out'' approach is the traditional planning approach where the organisation identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of "selling" the organization's products and messages to the "outside" or external stakeholders.<ref name=":1">Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., "An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Marketing Communications: An International Perspective," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 4, 2008, pp. 531–40</ref> In contrast, an ''outside-in'' approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.<ref>Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., "How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works? A theoretical review and an analysis of its main drivers and effects/ ¿Cómo funciona la Comunicación Integrada de Marketing (CIM)? Una revisión teórica y un análisis de sus antecedents Efectos," ''Comunicación y Sociedad,'' Vol. XXV, Núm. 1, 2012, pp. 313–48</ref>

From a model-building perspective, the 4 Ps has attracted a number of criticisms. Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, "communication" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and "promotion" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either ''promotion'' or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = van Waterschoot | first1 = W. | last2 = van den Bulte | first2 = C. | title = The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited | journal = Journal of Marketing | year = 1992 | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 83–93 | doi = 10.2307/1251988 | jstor = 1251988 }}</ref> Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.

Other important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.<ref>Constantinides, E., "The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vo. 22, 2006, pp. 407–38</ref>

====Modifications and extensions====

To overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions have been found necessary for retail marketing, industrial marketing, and internet marketing

include "people", "process", and "physical evidence" and are often applied in the case of [[services marketing]]<ref>Fisk, R.P., Brown, W., and Bitner, M.J., "Tracking the Evolution of Services Marketing Literature, ''Journal of Retailing'', vol. 41 (April), 1993; Booms, B. and Bitner, M.J. "Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms" in James H. Donnelly and William R. George (eds), ''Marketing of Services'', Chicago: American Marketing Association, 47–51; Rafiq,M. and Ahmed, P.K. "Using the 7Ps as a Generic Marketing mix: An Exploratory Survey of UK and European Marketing Academics", ''Marketing Intelligence & Planning'', Vol. 13, no. 9, pp. 4–15</ref> Other extensions have been found necessary in retail marketing, industrial marketing and internet marketing.

* Physical- the environment customers are in when they are marketed to
* People- service personnel and other customers with whom customers interact with. These people form part of the overall service experience.
* Process- the way in which orders are handled, customers are satisfied and the service is delivered<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tutor2u.net/business/reference/the-extended-marketing-mix-7ps|title=Extended Marketing Mix (7P's)|last=tutor2u|date=2019-11-01|website=tutor2u|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>
* Physical Evidence- the tangible examples of marketing that the customer has encountered before buying the advertised product
* Productivity- the ability to provide consumers with quality product using as few resources as possible<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.business-achievers.com/general/marketing-mix-4-ps-8-ps|title=Marketing Mix – 4 Ps or 8 Ps?|website=www.business-achievers.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>

=== The 4Cs ===
In response to environmental and technological changes in marketing, as well as criticisms towards the 4Ps approach, the 4Cs has emerged as a modern marketing mix model.

==== Outline ====
'''Consumer (or Client)'''

The consumer refers to the person or group that will acquire the product. This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer.<ref name=":3" />

'''Cost'''

Cost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product.<ref name=":3" />

'''Convenience'''

Like "Place" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so.<ref name=":3" />

'''Communication'''

Like "Promotion" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike, promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://catmediatheagency.com/4-ps-of-marketing-strategy/|title=Marketing Strategy: Forget the 4 P'S! What are the 4 C'S?|last=Hester|first=Brittany|date=2019-04-09|website=CATMEDIA Internal Communication|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>

==Environment==
{{Main|Market environment}}
The term "marketing environment" relates to all of the factors (whether internal, external, direct or indirect) that affect a firm's marketing decision-making/planning. A firm's marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are:
* The macro-environment ([[Macromarketing]]), over which a firm holds little control, consists of a variety of external factors that manifest on a large (or macro) scale. These include: economic, social, political and technological factors. A common method of assessing a firm's macro-environment is via a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within a [[PESTLE analysis]], a firm would analyze national political issues, culture and climate, key [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions, health and indicators (such as economic growth, [[inflation]], [[unemployment]], etc.), [[Social Trends|social trends]]/attitudes, and the nature of technology's impact on its society and the business processes within the society.<ref name=":4" />
* The micro-environment, over which a firm holds a greater amount (though not necessarily total) control, typically includes: Customers/[[consumer]]s, [[Employees]], [[Suppliers]] and the [[Media (communication)|Media]]. In contrast to the macro-environment, an organization holds a greater (though not complete) degree of control over these factors.<ref name=":4" />
* The internal environment, which includes the factors inside of the company itself<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=http://businessjargons.com/marketing-environment.html|title=What is Marketing Environment? definition and meaning – Business Jargons|date=2015-08-25|work=Business Jargons|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref> A firm's internal environment consists 
of: Labor, Inventory, Company Policy, Logistics, Budget, and Capital Assets.<ref name=":4" />

==Research==
{{main|Marketing research}}
Marketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm's marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between '''''marketing''''' research and '''''market''''' research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. '''Market research is a subset of marketing research'''.<ref name=MarKReSub/> (Avoiding the word consumer, which shows up in both,<ref>US Census data is both for Market research and for Marketing research: {{cite web

   |title=Difference between Market Research and Marketing Research}}</ref>

Marketing researchers use statistical methods (such as [[quantitative research]], [[qualitative research]], [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis tests]], [[Chi-squared test|Chi-square tests]], [[linear regression]], [[correlation coefficient]]s, [[frequency distribution]]s, [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] and [[binomial distribution]]s, etc.) to interpret their findings and convert data into information.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/4-principles-of-marketing-as-a-science-156082|title=4 Principles of Marketing As A Science|date=2013-04-18|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}</ref>

The stages of research include:

* Implement findings<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-marketing-spring2016/chapter/reading-the-marketing-research-process/|title=The Marketing Research Process {{!}} Principles of Marketing|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>

==Segmentation==
{{main|Market segmentation}}
Market segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of marketing|last=Stanton|first=William J|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984}}</ref> The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm's finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets.

Market segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segment, Target, and Position.

'''Segmentation''' involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include:
* '''Geographic''' (such as a country, region, city, town)
* '''Psychographic''' (e.g. personality traits or lifestyle traits which influence consumer behaviour)
* '''Demographic''' (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, education)
*'''Gender'''
*'''Income''' 
*'''Life-Cycle''' (e.g. Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Z)
*'''Lifestyle''' (e.g. tech savvy, active)
*'''Behavioural''' (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate)<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marketing: the Basics|last1=Moore|first1=Karl|last2=Pareek|first2=Niketh|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0-415-77899-2|location=New York, NY|pages=38–65}}</ref>

Once a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The ''DAMP'' acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are:
* '''Discernable''' – how a segment can be differentiated from other segments.
* '''Accessible''' – how a segment can be accessed via Marketing Communications produced by a firm
* '''Measurable''' – can the segment be quantified and its size determined?
* '''Profitable''' – can a sufficient return on investment be attained from a segment's servicing?

The next step in the targeting process is the level of [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are:
* '''Undifferentiated''' – where a company produces a like product for all of a market segment
* '''Differentiated''' – in which a firm produced slight modifications of a product within a segment
* '''[[Niche market|Niche]]''' – in which an organization forges a product to satisfy a specialized target market

''[[Positioning (marketing)|'''Positioning''']]'' concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor's products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product's placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product's perception among consumers and its position among competitors' offering.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management in Tourism|url=https://archive.org/details/strategicmanagem00mout|url-access=limited|last=Moutinho|first=Luiz|publisher=CABI Publishing|year=2000|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/strategicmanagem00mout/page/n131 121]–166}}</ref>

==Promotional Mix==
{{see also|Integrated marketing communications|3=Promotional mix}}
The promotional mix outlines how a company will market its product. It consists of five tools: personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, advertising and social media
* [[Personal selling]] involves a presentation given by a salesperson to an individual or a group of potential customers. It enables two-way communication and relationship building, and is most commonly seen in business-to-business marketing but can also be found in business-to-consumer marketing (e.g.: selling cars at a dealership).<ref name=":0" />

* [[Sales promotion]] involves short-term incentives to encourage the buying of products. Examples of these incentives include free samples, contests, premiums, trade shows, giveaways, coupons, sweepstakes and games. Depending on the incentive, one or more of the other elements of the promotional mix may be used in conjunction with sales promotion to inform customers of the incentives.<ref name=":0" />
* [[Public relations]] is the use of media tools to promote and monitor for a positive view of a company or product in the public's eye. The goal is to either sustain a positive opinion or lessen or change a negative opinion. It can include interviews, speeches/presentations, corporate literature, social media, news releases and special events.<ref name=":0" />
* [[Advertising]] occurs when a firm directly pays a media channel, directly via an in-house agency<ref name=MarketingInHouse.NYT2019>{{cite newspaper

{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|
* TV 
* Radio 
* Magazines
* Online 
* Billboards
* Event sponsorship
* Direct mail
* Transit ads<ref name=":0" />
}}
* [[Social media marketing|Social media]] is used to facilitate two-way communication between companies and their customers. Outlets such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Pinterest]], [[Snapchat]] and [[YouTube]] allow brands to start a conversation with regular and prospective customers. Viral marketing can be greatly facilitated by social media and if successful, allows key marketing messages and content in reaching a large number of target audiences within a short time frame. These platforms can also house advertising and public relations content.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing

==The Marketing Plan==
{{main|Marketing plan}}
The area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, as well as to an organization's overall marketing strategy. An organization's marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Thus, when top management is devising the firm's strategic direction/mission, the intended marketing activities are incorporated into this plan.

===Process===

Within the overall strategic marketing plan, the stages of the process are listed as thus:
* [[Mission statement|Mission Statement]]
*[[SWOT analysis|SWOT]] (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis
* Marketing Objectives
* Targeted [[Marketing strategy|Marketing Strategy]]
*Marketing Mix
*Implementation<ref name=":0" />

===Levels of marketing objectives within an organization===

As stated previously, the senior management of a firm would formulate a general business strategy for a firm. However, this general business strategy would be interpreted and implemented in different contexts throughout the firm.

At the corporate level, marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]), top management may state that sales for the group should increase by 25% over a ten-year period.

A '''[[strategic business unit]]''' (SBU) is a subsidiary within a firm, which participates within a given market/industry. The SBU would embrace the corporate strategy, and attune it to its own particular industry. For instance, an SBU may partake in the sports goods industry. It thus would ascertain how it would attain additional sales of sports goods, in order to satisfy the overall business strategy.

The '''functional''' level relates to departments within the SBUs, such as marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level would adopt the SBU's strategy and determine how to accomplish the SBU's own objectives in its market. To use the example of the sports goods industry again, the marketing department would draw up marketing plans, strategies and communications to help the SBU achieve its marketing aims.

==Product life cycle==

{{See|Product life-cycle management (marketing)}}
[[File:Product life cycle.png|thumb|[[Product lifecycle]]]]
The [[product lifecycle|product life cycle]] (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including:
* A given product would possess introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stage
* No product lasts perpetually on the market
* A firm must employ differing strategies, according to where a product is on the PLC

In the '''introduction''' stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question.

During the '''growth''' stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.

When the product hits '''maturity''', its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.

During '''decline''', demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued.<ref name=":0" />
