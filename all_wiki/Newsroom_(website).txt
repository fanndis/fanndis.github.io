== History ==

=== Launch ===
The site launched on 13 March 2017 with a promise to cover "the things that matter" and the hope of being a "New Zealand version of ''[[The Guardian]]''".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/mediawatch/audio/201836360/new-outlet's-egg-scoop-raises-big-issues|title=New outlet's egg scoop raises big issues |date=13 March 2017|website=RNZ}}</ref> ''Newsroom''<nowiki/>'s initial funding had come from four "foundation sponsors", which included the [[University of Auckland]] and [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. The site launched with a group of 16 writers. The site was founded by Tim Murphy, the former editor in chief of the ''[[The New Zealand Herald|New Zealand Herald]]'', and Mark Jennings, former head of news and current affairs at [[Newshub]]. Its first scoop accused an egg supplier of passing off caged eggs as free-range.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://stoppress.co.nz/news/newsroom-not-afraid-rattle-cage-full-site-launches|title=Newsroom not afraid to rattle the cage as full site launches|date=2017-03-14|access-date=2017-11-01 |language=en}}</ref>

=== New Zealand general election, 2017 ===
''Newsroom'' broke two significant stories which influenced the [[New Zealand general election, 2017]].

On June 20, 2017, the site revealed the clandestine recording of a staff member working for the MP [[Todd Barclay]], in an article titled "Politicians, police, and the payout".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2017/06/19/34825/the-politician-the-police-the-payout|title=The politicians, the police, and the payout|date=2017-06-20|work=Newsroom|access-date=2017-10-31|language=en-AU}}</ref> The article explored the extent of the police investigation and the involvement of then Prime Minister [[Bill English]]. ''Newsroom'' described the staff member involved as having been paid "hush money" from the Prime Minister's budget. Several days later, Barclay announced that he would not stand for re-election.

In collaboration with the ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''Newsroom'' raised an issue with the background of Chinese [[National Party of New Zealand|National Party]] MP [[Jian Yang (politician)|Jian Yang]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2017/09/13/46657/national-mp-trained-by-chinese-spies|title=National MP trained by Chinese spies|date=2017-09-13|work=Newsroom|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref> The site reported that the Security Intelligence Service had scrutinized Yang and that in an interview with the ''Financial Times'' in 2011, Yang had confirmed that he attended two military institutions that Newsroom described as "elite Chinese spy schools". The ''Financial Times'' says one of the schools is part of China's military intelligence apparatus, training linguists to intercept foreign communications. Yang was a lecturer at the Foreign Language Institute and his immigration file shows he taught the English language and American studies. Yang claimed he taught his students to simply monitor communications, rather than carry out "the physical act of spying".<ref name="Chinese spies2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/96800358/national-mp-jian-yang-slams-defamatory-claim-he-was-trained-by-chinese-spies|title=National MP Jian Yang taught English to Chinese spies but was not a spy himself|date=13 September 2017|work=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|accessdate=14 September 2017|quote=I was a civilian officer, paid by the military but I had no rank.
