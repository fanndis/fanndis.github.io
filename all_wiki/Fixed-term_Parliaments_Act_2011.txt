The '''Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011''' (c. 14) ('''FTPA''') is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that for the first time sets in legislation a default [[fixed-term election|fixed election date]] for a general election to the Westminster parliament. Before the passage of the Act elections were required by law to be held at least once every five years, but could be called earlier if the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] advised the monarch to exercise the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]] to do so. Prime Ministers often employed this mechanism to call an election before the end of the five-year term, sometimes fairly early in it, and some critics saw this as giving an unfair advantage to an incumbent Prime Minister. An election could also take place following a [[Motions of no confidence in the United Kingdom|vote of no confidence]] in the government: such a motion would be passed with an ordinary simple majority of those voting in the House of Commons and would, according to [[Constitutional conventions of the United Kingdom|constitutional convention]], force the government to resign, at which point the Prime Minister would generally advise the monarch to call for a new election.

Under the FTPA the next general election is automatically scheduled for the first Thursday in May of the fifth year after the previous general election{{mdash}}or the fourth year if the date of the previous election was before the first Thursday in May.  However, the FTPA also provides two ways to call an election earlier. One is a Commons vote of no confidence in the government, which still requires only a simple majority of those voting. The other is a vote explicitly in favour of an earlier election, which requires a qualified majority of two thirds of the total membership of the Commons.<ref name=Meeks>{{cite web |url=http://www2.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2019/05/05/new-rules-britains-changing-constitution/ |title=New Rules. Britain's Changing Constitution |date=5 May 2015 |author=Alastair Meeks |website=PoliticalBetting.com |access-date=27 June 2019}}</ref>

The first election under the FTPA was held on 7 May 2015. An early election was [[2017 United Kingdom general election|held in 2017]], after Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] received approval to call it by a two-thirds majority as provided in the Act.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/02/europe-landslide-victory-theresa-may-brexit |title=Strengthen Our Hand in Europe?

Under the FTPA the next general election was scheduled for 2022, but the [[Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019]], passed with Opposition support, circumvented the FTPA, providing for [[2019 United Kingdom general election|an election on 12 December 2019]] while otherwise leaving the FTPA in place. The date for the next election is now scheduled by the FTPA for the fifth year after the election of 2019, in May 2024{{mdash}}subject to the possibility of an earlier election under the FTPA.

The Conservative Party, currently in government, is committed to repealing the FTPA.<ref name="Con Man">{{cite web|url=https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf|title=Get Brexit Done: the Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2019|website=Conservative and Unionist Party|page=48|accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> In fulfilment of this pledge, on 1 December 2020 the government published a draft [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (Repeal) Bill]] that would repeal the FTPA and revive the royal prerogative power of dissolving Parliament as it existed before the Act.<ref name="FTPArepeal">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-fulfil-manifesto-commitment-and-scrap-fixed-term-parliaments-act|title=Government to fulfil manifesto commitment and scrap Fixed-term Parliaments Act|website=gov.uk|date=1 December 2020|accessdate=1 December 2020}}</ref>

==Background==
{{See also|Lascelles Principles}}
Before the passage of the FTPA Parliament could be [[dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|dissolved]] by [[royal proclamation]] by virtue of the [[royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]]. This originally meant that the English, and later British, monarch decided when to dissolve Parliament. Over time the monarch increasingly acted only on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and by the 19th century Prime Ministers had a great deal of ''de facto'' control over the timing of general elections.

The [[Septennial Act 1715]] provided that a Parliament expired seven years after it had been summoned. That period was reduced to five years by the [[Parliament Act 1911]].

Apart from special legislation enacted during both World Wars to extend the life of the then-current Parliaments, Parliament never reached (or, as in the wars, exceeded) its maximum statutory length, as the monarch, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day, always dissolved it before its expiry.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HT_GS2zgN5QC&pg=PA187 |author=Anthony Wilfred Bradley, Keith D. Ewing |title=Constitutional and Administrative Law |publisher=Pearson Education |location= |year=2006 |pages=187–189 |isbn=978-1-4058-1207-8}}</ref> The longest Parliament preceding the FTPA, other than during wartime, was the [[List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election|51st Parliament]] (1992–1997), which lasted four years, eleven months and two days.<ref>{{cite web|website=HITC|url=https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2017/10/26/7-longest-lasting-british-parliaments-how-long-will-this-one-las/|title=7 longest-Lasting British Parliaments – When Will This One End?|author=Richard Wood|date=26 October 2017}}</ref>

The five-year maximum duration referred to the lifetime of the Parliament and not to the interval between general elections. For example, while John Major's government lasted four years, eleven months and two days; the period between the general elections of [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] and [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] was five years and twenty-two days.

==Reasons for change==

The previous system had existed for a long time. Reasons for changing the system included:

# The previous system allowed the Prime Minister of the day to choose a date for a general election that was the most advantageous for his or her party.<ref name=bbcqa />
# The previous system could result in a period of political uncertainty before the possible calling of an early election if such an election was widely anticipated.<ref name=bbcqa>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11286879 |title=Q&A: Fixed-Term Parliaments |date=13 September 2010 |access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref>
# Under the previous system it was easier to cut short a Parliament and hold an early election in order to resolve political difficulties or remove instability. However, the outcome of the early election would not necessarily make those objectives easier to achieve.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

==Main parties' views==

Until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]] the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]'s manifesto made no mention of fixed-term Parliaments. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] manifesto for 2010 said that it would introduce fixed-term Parliaments, but did not say how long they would be. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] manifesto for 2010 included a pledge to introduce four-year fixed-term Parliaments. The 2010 election resulted in a [[hung Parliament]], with the Conservatives having 306 MPs and the Liberal Democrats 57 MPs. The two parties negotiated a coalition agreement to form a government, and a commitment to legislate for fixed-term Parliaments was included in the coalition deal.<ref name=bbcqa /> The journalist [[John Rentoul]] has suggested that one of the subsequent coalition government's motives for passing the legislation was a concern about its own potential instability. In this view the legislation was intended to make it difficult for either coalition partner to force an early election and bring the government down.<ref name=Indy170617>{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/how-george-osborne-lost-the-election-for-theresa-may-a7787726.html |title=How George Osborne and David Cameron Lost the Election for Theresa May |date=17 June 2017 |access-date=4 May 2019 |author=John Rentoul|newspaper=The Independent}}</ref>

==Provisions==
Section 3(1)<ref>{{cite act|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/section/3|title=Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|year=2011|article=3|article-type=section|website=legislation.gov.uk|legislature=UK Parliament}}</ref> of the Act originally stated<ref>{{cite act|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/enacted|title=Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|year=2011|website=legislation.gov.uk|legislature=UK Parliament}} (as originally enacted)</ref> that Parliament should be automatically dissolved seventeen [[working day]]s before the polling day of a [[Elections in the United Kingdom|general election]]. This was subsequently amended by the [[Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013]] to twenty-five working days. Section 1 of the FTPA provides for the polling day to occur on the first Thursday in May of the fifth year after the previous general election, starting with 7 May 2015.

The Prime Minister is given the power to postpone this date by up to two months by laying a draft statutory instrument before the House proposing that polling day occur up to two months later than that date. If the use of such a statutory instrument is approved by each House of Parliament, the Prime Minister has the power, by order made by statutory instrument under section 1(5), to provide that polling day occurs accordingly.

Section 2 of the FTPA also provides for two ways in which a general election can be held before the end of this five-year period:<ref>{{cite news |title=Some Think Theresa May Should Call a General Election. Here's Why She Can't |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/25/theresa-may-call-general-election-fixed-term-parliaments-act-brexit |author=Scot Peterson |date=25 October 2016|newspaper=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>
*If the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] resolves "That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government" (a [[Motions of no confidence in the United Kingdom|motion of no confidence]]), an early general election is held, unless the House of Commons subsequently resolves "That this House has confidence in Her Majesty's Government". This second resolution must be made within fourteen days of the first. This provision recognises that in a [[hung parliament]] it might be possible for a new government to be formed, commanding a majority.
*If the House of Commons, with the support of two-thirds of its total membership (including vacant seats), resolves "That there shall be an early parliamentary general election".
In either of these two cases, the Monarch (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) appoints the date of the new election by proclamation. Parliament is then dissolved 25 working days before that date.

Apart from the automatic dissolution in anticipation of a general election, whether held early or not, section 3(2) provides that "Parliament cannot otherwise be dissolved". The FTPA thus removes the traditional royal prerogative to [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|dissolve Parliament]],<ref name=Norton>{{cite web |title=Repealing the Fixed-term Parliaments Act? |url=https://nortonview.wordpress.com/2016/10/08/repealing-the-fixed-term-parliaments-act/ |author=Lord Norton of Louth |website=The Norton View |date=8 October 2016}}</ref> and repeals the Septennial Act 1715 as well as references in other Acts to the royal prerogative. The royal prerogative to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] Parliament – that is, to end a [[parliamentary session]] – is not affected by the FTPA.<ref>{{cite web|title=Proroguing Parliament|url=https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/proroguing-parliament|website=The Institute for Government|author=Joe Marshall|date=8 April 2019|access-date=13 May 2019}}</ref>

===Review===
Under section 7(4)–(6) of the FTPA the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] is obliged to establish a committee to review the operation of the FTPA and to make recommendations for its amendment or repeal, if appropriate. The committee must be established between 1 June and 30 November 2020, and the majority of its members must be members of the House of Commons. On 10 November 2020, the House of Commons ordered the establishment of a Joint Committee pursurant to the FTPA and appointed the Commons members of the Committee.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Joint Committee on the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act - Hansard|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2020-11-10/debates/2EF65043-F6D6-4BC0-9460-39E84EDC7039/JointCommitteeOnTheFixed-TermParliamentsAct|access-date=2020-11-17|website=hansard.parliament.uk}}</ref>

==Debate==
When introducing the Bill that became the FTPA into the House of Commons, [[Nick Clegg]], then Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], said that "by setting the date that Parliament will [be] dissolve[d], our Prime Minister is giving up the right to pick and choose the date of the next general election—that's a true first in British politics."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10729454 |title=AV Referendum Question Published |date=22 July 2010 |publisher=BBC News }}</ref>

The government initially indicated that an "enhanced majority" of 55 per cent of MPs would be needed to trigger a dissolution, but this did not become part of the FTPA/ Instead the FTPA contains the two-thirds requirement.<ref>{{cite news |author=George Eaton|author-link=George Eaton (journalist)|title=Fixed-term Parliaments Won't Prevent a Second Election |url= http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/05/government-fixed-election |work=New Statesman |location= London |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref>

Proposed amendments that would have limited the fixed term to four years, backed by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], [[Plaid Cymru]] and the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]], were defeated.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11771309 |title=Four-year Fixed-term Parliament Bid Defeated |date=16 November 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> 

Section 4 of the FTPA postponed the [[Scottish Parliament general election|Scottish Parliament election]] that would have been held on 7 May 2015, moving the election day to 5 May 2016 to avoid it coinciding with the general election in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |title= Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, section 4 |url= http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/section/4/enacted |publisher=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref>

==Critiques==
According to one political scientist, [[Colin Talbot]], the FTPA makes [[minority governments]] more stable than in the past, since events that previously might have forced a government out of power{{mdash}}such as [[State Opening of Parliament#Debate on the speech|defeat of a Queen's Speech]] or other important legislation, [[loss of supply]], or a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister rather than the government as a whole{{mdash}}cannot formally do so.<ref name="talbot20150503">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/under-the-fixed-term-parliaments-act-a-minority-government-doesnt-need-a-confidence-and-supply-arrangement-to-be-able-to-govern/ |title=Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, a Minority Government Doesn't Need a 'Confidence and Supply' Arrangement to Be Able to Govern |publisher=London School of Economics |date=3 May 2015 |accessdate=3 May 2015 |author=Talbot, Colin |authorlink=Colin Talbot}}</ref> Robert Blackburn QC, a professor of constitutional law, has stated that "the status and effect of a no-confidence motion remains largely as it was prior to the Act".<ref>{{cite web |title=Oral evidence - Status of resolutions of the House of Commons - 23 Oct 2018 Q100 |url=http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/public-administration-and-constitutional-affairs-committee/status-of-resolutions-of-the-house-of-commons/oral/91939.html |website=data.parliament.uk}}</ref>

Alastair Meeks, a lawyer writing on the [[PoliticalBetting.com]] website, has argued that, as well as removing the Prime Minister's ability to set an election date at a time of her or his choosing, the FTPA has significantly affected the [[British constitution]]. It has removed the ability of the Prime Minister to make a vote on a policy a matter of confidence in the government, a tool that minority governments and governments with small majorities have used to ensure that legislation is passed in the House of Commons. This puts such governments at risk of remaining in power without an adequate ability to legislate, increasing the necessity of coalition government.<ref name=Meeks/>

[[David Allen Green]], a lawyer and journalist, and Andrew Blick, a  legal academic, have argued that the FTPA has changed little in practice, since the Prime Minister can still, so long as at least a portion of the [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Opposition]] agrees, schedule an [[snap election|election at his or her pleasure]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/17eda04e-ea24-359a-8c7e-d0caed79cb5e|last=Green|first=David Allen|title=The Fixed-term Parliaments Act has failed|work=Financial Times|date=18 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/whatever-happened-to-fixed-term-parliaments|last=Blick|first=Andrew|title=Good Idea, Bad Outcome: Whatever Happened to Fixed-Term Parliaments?|publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science|date=17 May 2017}}</ref>

Blick also argues that the use of a [[supermajority]] requirement for the [[House of Commons]], which is very rare in UK law, represents a move towards [[entrenched clause]]s in the UK Constitution.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blick|first=Andrew|title=Constitutional Implications of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=69|issue=1|pages=19–35|doi=10.1093/pa/gsv004|date=2016|quote=The UK has no written constitution. Yet entrenchment in some forms has had a part in UK constitutional conceptions. Moreover, in recent times this role has grown. Some precedent for supermajorities, for instance, has appeared through the provision in section 2 of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 for early general elections following support from two-thirds or more of MPs.}}</ref>

In 2017 Blick argued alongside [[Graham Allen (politician)|Graham Allen]], who chaired the House of Commons Select Committee on Political and Constitutional Reform during passage of the FTPA, that the FTPA had failed "to deliver on one of its main stated purposes ... to reduce the discretion possessed by the Prime Minister in being able to determine the date of general elections".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/why-fixed-term-parliaments-seem-a-good-idea/|last1=Blick|first1=Andrew|last2=Allen|first2=Graham|title=Protecting Even Prime Ministers from Themselves: Why Fixed-Term Parliaments Seem a Good Idea |website=British Politics and Policy at LSE |publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science|date=12 July 2017|accessdate=24 December 2019}}</ref> Allen and Blick argued, however, that this was an "admirable objective" and proposed that instead of being repealed the FTPA should be amended to provide additional safeguards. During the passage of the FTPA Allen stated on second reading that his committee had not received ample notice for adequate scrutiny of the Bill and that there were "so many flaws in the Bill’s drafting".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Fixed-term Parliaments Bill - Hansard |journal=Hansard.parliament.uk |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2010-09-13/debates/10091315000001/Fixed-TermParliamentsBill#contribution-10091325000018 |accessdate=24 December 2019}}</ref> It was also reported that Allen was critical that the committee had not had sufficient time to consider whether a four-year term would have been more appropriate than the five-year term stipulated in the FTPA.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-11261030 |title=Five-year parliaments 'too long'|agency=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=10 September 2010}}</ref>

In September 2019 Junade Ali advised in written evidence to the [[House of Lords]] [[Constitution Committee]] that repeal of the FTPA should be pursued on the basis that, as [[A. V. Dicey]] noted, dissolution allows for the executive to appeal to the nation if it feels the [[House of Commons]] is no longer supported by the electors, allowing for the resolution of unforeseen constitutional crises by the electorate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kirby|first=James|title=A.

However, the political scientist [[Philip Norton|Lord Norton]] has argued that the FTPA significantly limits the Prime Minister's ability to obtain an early election, since the Opposition can prevent an election by voting against it.<ref>{{cite web|website=Political Studies Association|url=https://www.psa.ac.uk/psa/news/we-need-talk-about-fixed-term-parliaments-act-2011-understand-theresa-mays-election-plans|title=We Need to Talk about the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011 to Understand Theresa May's Election Plans|author=Lord Norton of Louth|date=18 April 2017}}</ref> This was borne out in 2019, as the Opposition blocked Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]]'s attempt to hold early elections on several occasions.<ref name=NoGenElec>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49584907|title=Boris Johnson's Call for General Election Rejected by MPs|work=BBC News|date=4 September 2019|access-date=5 September 2019}}</ref> An Act of Parliament for an early election (the [[Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019]]) was then passed, with Opposition support, by a simple majority.

==Implementation==
===Election held after a full five-year term on date fixed by section 1 of the FTPA===
The 2015 general election was held on 7 May 2015, in the first, and so far only, use of the FTPA to dictate the date of a general election.

===Election held after a two-thirds Commons majority for dissolution by section 2(1) of the FTPA===
<!--====2017 general election====-->
{{see|2017 United Kingdom general election}}
On 18 April 2017 Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced her intention to call a general election for 8 June 2017, bringing the United Kingdom's 56th Parliament to an end after two years and 32 days. The FTPA permits this, but requires two-thirds of the Commons (at least 434 MPs) to support the motion to allow it to be passed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100705/debtext/100705-0001.htm#10070511000001|title= House of Commons Debate 5 July 2010 c 23|date=5 July 2010|accessdate=8 September 2013|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> [[Jeremy Corbyn]], then the [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] indicated that he was in support of an election. The motion was passed the following day by 522 votes to 13 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/apr/19/election-2017-theresa-may-mps-early-vote-politics-live|title= General Election 2017|date=19 April 2017|accessdate=19 April 2017|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

As the FTPA requires that general elections take place on the first Thursday in May, the date of the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|next general election]] after the 2017 election (assuming that no earlier election were called) would have been 5 May 2022, meaning that the term would have been one month short of five years.

===Motions that did not result in an election===
{{main|Motions of no confidence in the United Kingdom}}

====2018 proposed motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister====
On 17 December 2018 the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] tabled a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister, [[Theresa May]]. As this was not a motion of no confidence in Her Majesty's Government in the form set out in the FTPA, its passing would not have resulted in a general election being called. Arguing that this would have no effect because of the FTPA, Theresa May was able to call it a stunt and deny it any time for debate.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.sky.com/story/downing-street-rules-out-parliament-time-for-corbyns-stunt-no-confidence-motion-in-may-11584524 |title=Downing Street Rules Out Parliament Time for Corbyn's 'Stunt' No-Confidence Motion in May |date=18 December 2018 |access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref>

The [[Scottish National Party|SNP]], the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Plaid Cymru]] and the [[Green Party of England & Wales|Green Party]] submitted an amendment to the motion that, if passed, would have changed the motion to meet the requirements of the FTPA. The government subsequently announced that the motion would not be given parliamentary time.

The following day, 18 December 2018, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party tabled a new motion of no confidence in the Government in the form set down in the FTPA. This was the first such motion to be tabled under the terms of the FTPA.<ref>{{cite newspaper|newspaper=Evening Standard|title=Brexit news latest: Opposition Parties Table Vote of No Confidence in Government|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-news-latest-opposition-parties-table-no-confidence-motion-in-government-a4020981.html|author=Sean Morrison|date=19 December 2018}}</ref>

====2019 motions for a general election====

{{see also|Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011#2019 general election}}

[[First Johnson ministry|Boris Johnson's government]] attempted three times to call an early general election by means of section 2(2) of the FTPA. Each motion achieved a simple majority. but did not meet the two-thirds requirement because opposition parties abstained. Eventually Parliament passed the [[Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019]].

=====First motion=====
On 3 September 2019 the [[First Johnson ministry|government]] tabled a motion under the FTPA to trigger an early general election, requiring the votes of two thirds of MPs. However, Labour refused to support the motion until legislation to delay a [[no-deal Brexit]] had been passed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brexit: PM in New Battle after Commons Vote Defeat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49574217|date=4 September 2019|work=BBC News|access-date=4 September 2019}}</ref> On 4  September there were 298 votes for the motion and 56 against, well short of the two-thirds supermajority required.<ref name=NoGenElec/> On 6 September four opposition parties – Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Plaid Cymru – agreed not to support any parliamentary vote for a general election until after the next [[List of European Council meetings|meeting of the European Council]], which was scheduled for 17–18 October 2019.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brexit: Opposition Parties to Reject PM Election Move|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49609677|work=BBC News|date=6 September 2019|access-date=7 September 2019}}</ref>

=====Second motion=====

On 9 September another motion for an early election was tabled by the government. Iit failed by 293 voters to 46 with 303 abstentions.

No further motions under the FTPA were attempted in the 2017–19 Parliament, as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] Boris Johnson introduced the [[Early Parliamentary General Election Bill|Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019]] to the [[House of Commons]] on the same day, which triggered an election. {{further|Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011#2019 general election}}

==2019 general election==
{{see|2019 United Kingdom general election}}

The [[Early Parliamentary General Election Bill|Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019]] was introduced on 29 October 2019 by Boris Johnson<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201919/cmagenda/OP191029.pdf|title=Order Paper No.10: Part 1|date=29 October 2019|website=House of Commons}}</ref> following the failure to secure an election by a two-thirds majority the previous day. The Bill was fast-tracked through the [[House of Commons]] on the same day it was introduced,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Newson |first1=Nicola |title=Early Parliamentary General Election Bill: Briefing for Lords Stages |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/LLN-2019-0144 |date=30 October 2019}}</ref> the following day [[Natalie Evans, Baroness Evans of Bowes Park|Baroness Evans of Bowes Park]] ([[Leader of the House of Lords]]) introduced the Bill in the House of Lords and it received its First Reading. The Bill completed all stages the following day (30 October) without amendment and was presented to Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II]] for [[Royal Assent]]. In accordance with the [[Royal Assent Act 1967]], at 4:27 PM on 31 October, Royal Assent was notified to the House of Lords and notified in the [[House of Commons]] at 4:35 PM.<ref>{{cite web |title=Royal Assent - Hansard |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2019-10-31/debates/E095C72C-6D9D-489F-BD54-CB67D51A195E/RoyalAssent |website=hansard.parliament.uk}}</ref> The Bill took three days from introduction to Royal Assent.<ref>{{cite news |title=Civil Partnership - Hansard |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-10-31/debates/6FAFCC9A-A3BD-4C59-9F61-956DF2E26E3A/CivilPartnership |accessdate=24 December 2019 |work=hansard.parliament.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Bill stages — Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 — UK Parliament |url=https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2019-19/earlyparliamentarygeneralelection/stages.html |website=services.parliament.uk}}</ref>

The Act circumvented the FTPA to provide for a general election on 12 December:

::'''1 Early parliamentary general election'''
:::(1) An early parliamentary general election is to take place on 12 December 2019 in consequence of the passing of this Act.
:::(2) That day is to be treated as a polling day appointed under section 2(7) of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2019-20/earlyparliamentarygeneralelection.html|title=Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019|website=UK Parliament|accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref>

At 00.01 AM on Wednesday 6 November 2019, Parliament was dissolved, as the FTPA requires that dissolution must happen 25 days before a general election with all seats in the House of Commons becoming vacant.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dissolution of Parliament - News from Parliament |url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2019/november/the-house-has-dissolved/ |website=UK Parliament |language=English}}</ref>

The 2019 act refers to the FTPA but does not amend it.  The FTPA has remained in force unaltered;  the effect of the 2019 act was only to interrupt its operation. The two acts do not legally conflict, owing to the British constitutional principle of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]], that Parliament has "the right to make or unmake any law whatever", and constitutional laws are of no different status.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ali |first1=Junade |title=The Fixed Term Parliament Act: A Recipe for Constitutional Crisis and Prorogation? |url=https://blog.politics.ox.ac.uk/the-fixed-term-parliament-act-a-recipe-for-constitutional-crisis-and-prorogation/ |website=OxPol |publisher=Oxford University}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blick |first1=Andrew |title=Constitutional Implications of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011 |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |date=1 January 2016 |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=19–35 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsv004 |url=https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/69/1/19/2472855 |accessdate=24 December 2019 |language=en |issn=0031-2290}}</ref>

The FTPA now determines that the next scheduled election after the 2019 election is to be in May 2024. However, following the 2019 election and the formation of a Conservative majority government, the 2019 [[Speech from the throne|Queen's Speech]] announced the government's intention to repeal the FTPA in early 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Clear |first1=Stephen |title=Boris Johnson is planning radical changes to the UK constitution – here are the ones you need to know about |url=https://theconversation.com/boris-johnson-is-planning-radical-changes-to-the-uk-constitution-here-are-the-ones-you-need-to-know-about-128956 |work=The Conversation |language=en}}</ref>

==Other effects==

In 2016, in the wake of the [[Panama Papers]] scandal, a petition was created on the [[UK Parliament petitions website|Parliament petitions website]] that called for a [[Uk general election|general election]] after former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] revealed that he had had investments in an offshore trust.<ref>{{cite news |title=Petition calls for General Election this year after David Cameron admission |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/04/08/petition-calls-for-general-election-this-year-after-david-cameron-admission-5804720/ |work=Metro |date=8 April 2016 |accessdate=14 June 2016}}</ref> After the petition had passed the threshold of 100,000 signatures, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] response cited the Fixed-term Parliaments Act in its reply, and stated that "no Government can call an early general election any more anyway".<ref>{{cite web |title=Hold a General Election in 2016 |url= http://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/122946 |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=14 June 2016}}</ref>

In 2017 the journalist [[John Rentoul]] writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper argued that the Fixed-term Parliaments Act indirectly caused the election loss of [[Theresa May]]'s majority in the 2017 election. Technicalities made her choose an election campaign of seven weeks, 2–3 weeks longer than usual, which, Rentoul argued, lost her the majority.<ref name=Indy170617 />

Losing the [[State Opening of Parliament#Debate on the speech|parliamentary vote that follows a Queen's speech]] has traditionally been seen as having the same consequences for a government as losing a vote of no confidence. Although this is no longer the case under the Act, the consequences of losing a vote on the Queen's speech are still considered significant. Theresa May delayed the Queen's speech that was expected in Spring 2019, partly as a result of concerns about the prospects for winning a parliamentary vote on it.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48097069 |title=Theresa May 'unlikely' to hold another Queen's speech |date=29 April 2019 |access-date=17 July 2019|work=BBC News|author=Nicholas Watt}}</ref>

==Proposed changes==
===Repeal===
The Conservative Party manifesto at the 2017 general election proposed repealing the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011.<ref>[https://www.conservatives.com/manifesto Conservative Party 2017 manifesto], p. 43</ref> However, Theresa May's government failed to win a House of Commons majority at that election and did not attempt to repeal the act.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theweek.co.uk/86039/fixed-term-parliaments-act-what-is-it-and-why-does-it-matter |title=Fixed-term Parliaments Act: What is it and why does it matter? |date=26 June 2017 |access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref>

The Conservative Party repeated the commitment to repealing the act in its manifesto for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|December 2019 election]], at which it won a majority.  The manifesto stated that the Act "has led to paralysis at a time the country needed decisive action".<ref name="Con Man" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/12/exit-poll-election-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-labour|title=If the exit poll is right, this election will transform British politics|first=Martin|last=Kettle|date=12 December 2019|access-date=13 December 2019|work=The Guardian}}</ref> The first [[Queen's Speech]] following the election confirmed that "work will be taken forward to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/12/full-transcript-the-queens-speech/|title=Full transcript: The Queen's Speech|date=19 December 2019|accessdate=19 December 2019|work=The Spectator}}</ref>

Repealing the Act would require a new [[Act of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Act of Parliament]]. If the duration of parliaments is to be limited, arrangements for this would need to be included in the new Act because the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 repealed pre-existing legislation governing the duration of parliaments.<ref name=Norton/>

===Reform===
Since the Act has abolished the old prerogative powers, for example the royal power of dissolution, it may not be possible simply to revive them even if that were desired.  The Act might instead be reformed, in particular to specify what steps should occur during what is now the "messy fortnight" after a motion under the Act is passed and to clarify whether pre-existing types of vote amounting to no-confidence, such as rejection of the Budget, continue to require a government's resignation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/ftpa-should-not-be-replaced-something-worse?inf_contact_key=4c69800fd8648d1a4e9dcbd0a5badf857e470d92b8b75168d98a0b8cac0e9c09|last=Hogarth|first=Raphael|title=The FTPA is a bad law – but it should not be replaced with something worse|website=Institute for Government|date=27 November 2019|accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref><!--he says Labour has "pledged" to repeal the Act but I couldn't see it in the 2019 Labour Maninfesto-->

===Replacement===
After the December 2019 election, on 3 February 2020, a [[private member's bill]] to repeal and replace the FTPA was introduced in the [[House of Lords]] by Conservative peer [[Benjamin Mancroft, 3rd Baron Mancroft|Lord Mancroft]].<ref name="FTPA repeal bill">{{Cite web|url=https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2019-20/fixedtermparliamentsact2011repeal.html|title=Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (Repeal) Bill [HL] 2019-20 (HL Bill 86)|website=services.parliament.uk|accessdate=7 February 2020}}</ref> The bill would establish five-year parliaments, the next election to be on 2 May 2024, unless an early election is called by royal proclamation dissolving Parliament. This would substantially restore the position before the FTPA. The bill would confirm that the monarch has power to prorogue Parliament until a time of the monarch's choosing. Under the bill, the monarch's actions, and government advice to the monarch about those actions, would not be justiciable. As of 19 November 2020, a second reading for the bill has yet to be scheduled.

==Repeal==
The government published in 2020 its proposed [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (Repeal) Bill]] which would replace the 2011 Act.<ref name="FTPArepeal" />
