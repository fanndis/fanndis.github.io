He is also a [[painting|painter]], having created works under his birth name that are on permanent public display in several institutions. He is the founder of the [[Frank Sinatra School of the Arts]] in [[Astoria, Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>{{cite news|title=He's Never Left Astoria Behind|author=Corey Kilgannon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/nyregion/26bennett.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 26, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507233026/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/nyregion/26bennett.html?_r=0|archive-date=May 7, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Born and raised in [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] to an [[Italian-American]] family, Bennett began singing at an early age. He fought in the final stages of World War II as a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[infantry]]man in the [[European theatre of World War II|European Theater]]. Afterward, he developed his singing technique, signed with [[Columbia Records]] and had his first number-one popular song with "[[Because of You (1940 song)|Because of You]]" in 1951. Several top hits such as "[[Rags to Riches (song)|Rags to Riches]]" followed in early 1953. He then refined his approach to encompass [[jazz singing]]. He reached an artistic peak in the late 1950s with albums such as ''[[The Beat of My Heart]]'' and ''[[Basie Swings, Bennett Sings]]''. In 1962, Bennett recorded his [[signature song]], "[[I Left My Heart in San Francisco]]". His career and personal life experienced an extended downturn during the height of the [[rock music]] era.

Bennett staged a comeback in the late 1980s and 1990s, putting out [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] albums again and expanding his reach to the [[MTV generation]] while keeping his musical style intact. He remains a popular and critically praised recording artist and concert performer to date. He has won 19 [[Grammy Award]]s (including a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]], presented in 2001) and two [[Emmy Award]]s, and was named an [[NEA Jazz Masters|NEA Jazz Master]] and a [[Kennedy Center Honors|Kennedy Center Honoree]]. Bennett has sold over 50 million records worldwide.

=== 1944–1950: World War II and after ===

As the German Army was pushed back to its homeland, Benedetto and his [[Dog company|company]] saw bitter fighting in cold winter conditions, often hunkering down in [[Defensive fighting position|foxholes]] as German [[88 mm gun]]s fired on them.<ref name="gl-57">Bennett, ''The Good Life'', pp. 57–59.</ref> At the end of March, they crossed the [[Rhine]] and entered Germany, engaging in dangerous house-to-house, town-after-town fighting to clean out German soldiers;<ref name="gl-57"/> during the first week of April, they crossed the [[Kocher River]], and by the end of the month reached the [[Danube]].<ref name="gl-60">Bennett, ''The Good Life'', pp. 60–61.</ref> During his time in combat, Benedetto narrowly escaped death several times.<ref name="sullivan"/> The experience made him a [[pacifist]];<ref name="sullivan"/> he would later write, "Anybody who thinks that war is romantic obviously hasn't gone through one,"<ref name="gl-55"/> and later say, "It was a nightmare that's permanent.

Benedetto stayed in Germany as part of the occupying force but was assigned to an informal Special Services band unit that would entertain nearby American forces.<ref name="sullivan"/>  His dining with a black friend from high school – at a time when [[Military history of African Americans|the Army was still racially segregated]] – led to his being demoted and reassigned to [[Graves Registration Service]] duties.<ref name="tavis-int">{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200609/20060929_bennett.html | title=Tony Bennett | work=[[Tavis Smiley]] | publisher=[[PBS]] | date=September 29, 2006 | accessdate=January 6, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228094530/http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200609/20060929_bennett.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archive-date=December 28, 2007}}</ref> Subsequently, he sang with the [[United States military bands|314th Army Special Services Band]] under the stage name Joe Bari<ref name="gl-74"/> (a name he had started using before the war, chosen after [[Bari|the city]] and [[Province of Bari|province]] in Italy and as a partial [[anagram]] of his family origins in [[Calabria]]).<ref>Bennett, ''The Good Life'', p. 48.</ref> He played with many musicians who would have post-war careers.<ref name="gl-74">Bennett, ''The Good Life'', pp. 71, 74, 77.</ref>

His first big hit was "[[Because of You (1940 song)|Because of You]]", a ballad produced by Miller with a lush orchestral arrangement from [[Percy Faith]].

A third number-one came in 1953 with "[[Rags to Riches (song)|Rags to Riches]]". Unlike Bennett's other early hits, this was an up-tempo [[big band]] number with a bold, [[brass instrument|brassy]] sound and a double [[tango (music)|tango]] in the instrumental break; it topped the charts for eight weeks.<ref name="essential"/>

Once the [[rock and roll]] era began in 1955, the dynamic of the music industry changed and it became harder and harder for existing pop singers to do well commercially.<ref name="amg-bio"/> Nevertheless, Bennett continued to enjoy success, placing eight songs in the [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'']] {{nowrap|Top 40}} during the latter part of the 1950s, with "[[In the Middle of an Island]]" (which he vehemently hated so much) reaching the highest at number nine in 1957.<ref name="bb40">Whitburn, ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', p. 35.</ref>

=== 1954–1965: A growing artistry ===

Sharon told Bennett that a career singing "sweet saccharine songs like 'Blue Velvet'" wouldn't last long, and encouraged Bennett to focus even more on his jazz inclinations.<ref name="npr-jazz"/><ref name="nyt-rs-obit"/>

The result was the 1957 album ''[[The Beat of My Heart]]''. It used well-known jazz musicians such as [[Herbie Mann]] and [[Nat Adderley]], with a strong emphasis on percussion from the likes of [[Art Blakey]], [[Jo Jones]], Latin star [[Candido Camero]], and [[Chico Hamilton]].

Bennett also built up the quality, and therefore, the reputation of his [[nightclub]] act; in this he was following the path of Sinatra and other top jazz and standards singers of this era.<ref name="amg-bio"/> In June 1962, Bennett staged a [[Tony Bennett at Carnegie Hall|highly promoted concert performance at Carnegie Hall]], using a stellar line-up of musicians including [[Al Cohn]], [[Kenny Burrell]], and [[Candido Camero|Candido]], as well as the Ralph Sharon Trio. The concert featured 44 songs, including favorites like "[[I've Got the World on a String]]" and "[[The Best Is Yet to Come (song)|The Best Is Yet To Come]]". It was a big success, further cementing Bennett's reputation as a star both at home and abroad.<ref name="npr-jazz"/><ref name="nyt-giddins"/> Bennett also appeared on television, and in October 1962 he sang on the initial broadcast of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/under-the-tree-a-present-that-captured-history |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228210634/http://www.paleycenter.org/under-the-tree-a-present-that-captured-history |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 28, 2008 |title=Under the Tree: A Present that Captured History |author=Simon, Ron |publisher=[[Paley Center for Media]] |date=December 22, 2008 |accessdate=December 28, 2008}}</ref>

Also in 1962, Bennett released his recording of "[[I Left My Heart in San Francisco]]", a decade-old but little-known song originally written for an opera singer.<ref name="nyt-rs-obit"/> Although this reached only number 19 on the {{nowrap|[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]}},<ref name="bb40"/> it spent close to a year on various other charts and increased Bennett's exposure.<ref name="amg-bio"/><ref name="nyt-giddins"/> The [[I Left My Heart in San Francisco (album)|album of the same title]] was a {{nowrap|top 5}} hit and both the single and album achieved [[RIAA certification|gold record]] status.<ref name="amg-bio"/> The song won [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance, Male|Best Male Solo Vocal Performance]] for Bennett. Over the years, this would become known as Bennett's [[signature song]].<ref name="ghk0495"/><ref name="ap090507"/> In 2001, it was ranked 23rd on an [[RIAA]]/[[National Endowment for the Arts|NEA]] list of the most historically significant [[Songs of the Century|Songs of the 20th Century]].

Bennett's following album, ''[[I Wanna Be Around...]]'' (1963), was also a top-5 success,<ref name="amg-bio"/> with the [[I Wanna Be Around|title track]] and "[[The Good Life (1962 song)|The Good Life]]" each reaching the {{nowrap|top 20}} of the pop singles chart<ref name="bb40"/> along with the {{nowrap|top 10}} of the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Chart|Adult Contemporary chart]].<ref name="amg-singles">{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p6095|pure_url=yes}} | title=Tony Bennett: Charts & Awards: Billboard Singles | website=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=January 15, 2008}}</ref>

The next year brought [[the Beatles]] and the [[British Invasion]], and with them still more musical and cultural attention to rock and less to pop, standards, and jazz. Over the next couple of years, Bennett had minor hits with several albums and singles based on [[show tunes]]; his last top-40 single was the number 34 "[[If I Ruled the World]]" from ''[[Pickwick (musical)|Pickwick]]'' in 1965,<ref name="bb40"/> but his commercial fortunes were clearly starting to decline. An attempt to break into [[acting]] with a role in the poorly received 1966 film ''[[The Oscar (film)|The Oscar]]'' met with middling reviews for Bennett; he did not enjoy the experience and did not seek further roles.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40C13F93E5F16738DDDAC0894DB405B868AF1D3 | title=Screen 'Oscar' Arrives | author=Crowther, Bosley | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 5, 1966 | author-link=Bosley Crowther}}</ref><ref>Bennett, ''The Good Life'', p. 186.</ref>

=== 1965–1979: Years of struggle ===
Ralph Sharon and Bennett parted ways in 1965.<ref name="amg-sharon"/>  There was great pressure on singers such as [[Lena Horne]] and [[Barbra Streisand]] to record "contemporary" rock songs, and in this vein, Columbia Records' [[Clive Davis]] suggested that Bennett do the same.<ref name="amg-bio"/> Bennett was very reluctant, and when he tried, the results pleased no one.

Years later, Bennett would recall his dismay at being asked to do contemporary material, comparing it to when his mother was forced to produce a cheap dress.<ref>Bennett, ''The Good Life'', p. 33.</ref> By 1972, he had departed Columbia for the [[Verve Records|Verve division of MGM Records]] ([[Philips Records|Philips]] in the UK) and had relocated for a stint in London, where he hosted a television show from the [[Talk of the Town (nightclub)|Talk of the Town nightclub]] in conjunction with [[Thames Television]], ''[[Tony Bennett at the Talk of the Town]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/30916 | title=Tony Bennett at the Talk of the Town | publisher=[[BFI Film & TV Database]] | accessdate=June 22, 2012 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823125313/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/30916 | archive-date=August 23, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="jt2011"/><ref name="evanier-194">Evanier, ''All the Things You Are'', pp. 194–195.</ref> With his new label, he tried a variety of approaches, including some more Beatles material, but found no renewed commercial success, and in a couple more years he was without a recording contract.<ref name="amg-bio"/><ref>Evanier, ''All the Things You Are'', p. 200.</ref>

Bennett and his wife Patricia had been separated since 1965, their marriage a victim of Bennett's spending too much time on the road, among other factors.<ref name="ghk0495"/> In 1969, Patricia sued him for divorce on grounds of adultery.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WSMrAAAAIBAJ&pg=1480,2177440 | title=Tony Bennett's Estranged Wife Seeks Divorce | agency=[[United Press International]] | newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]] | date=October 3, 1969 | page=31}}</ref>  In 1971, their divorce became official.

Taking matters into his own hands, Bennett started his own record company, Improv.<ref name="amg-bio"/> He cut some songs that would later become favorites, such as "What is This Thing Called Love?", and made two well-regarded albums with jazz pianist [[Bill Evans]], ''[[The Tony Bennett/Bill Evans Album]]'' (1975) and ''[[Together Again (Tony Bennett and Bill Evans album)|Together Again]]'' (1976),<ref name="nyt-giddins">{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E7D71138F93BA25752C1A9679C8B63 | title=A Long-Distance Legend Who's Lapped the Field | author=Giddins, Gary | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 18, 2001 | author-link=Gary Giddins}}</ref> but Improv lacked a distribution arrangement with a major label and by 1977, it was out of business.<ref name="amg-bio"/><ref name="nyt050299"/>

=== 1979–1989: Turnaround ===
After a near-fatal [[cocaine]] [[drug overdose|overdose]] in 1979, Bennett called his sons Danny and Dae for help. "Look, I'm lost here," he told them. "It seems like people don't want to hear the music I make."<ref name="aarp"/>

Danny Bennett, an aspiring musician himself, also came to a realization. The band Danny and his brother had started, [[Quacky Duck and His Barnyard Friends]], had foundered <!-- this word used intentionally! means "sunk, like a ship" in this case, whereas "flounder" means "to move about clumsily", not what is meant here --> and Danny's musical abilities were limited. However, he had discovered during this time that he did have a head for business. His father, on the other hand, had tremendous musical talent, but was having trouble sustaining a career from it and had little financial sense. Danny signed on as his father's manager.<ref name="nyt050299">{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01EED6113DF931A35756C0A96F958260 | title= Talking Money With: Tony Bennett: His Heart's in San Francisco, His Money in His Son's Hands | author=Fabrikant, Geraldine | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 2, 1999}}</ref>

Danny got his father's expenses under control, moved him back to New York, and began booking him in colleges and small theaters to get him away from a "Vegas" image.<ref name="aarp"/><ref name="nyt050299"/> After some effort, a successful plan to pay back the IRS debt was put into place.<ref name="nyt050299"/> The singer had also reunited with Ralph Sharon as his pianist and musical director<ref name="amg-sharon"/> (and would remain with him until Sharon's retirement in 2002).<ref name="nyt-rs-obit">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/arts/music/ralph-sharon-jazz-pianist-who-accompanied-tony-bennett-dies-at-91.html | title=Ralph Sharon, 91, Tony Bennett's Pianist | author=Fox, Margalit | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 10, 2015 | page=B19 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602220126/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/arts/music/ralph-sharon-jazz-pianist-who-accompanied-tony-bennett-dies-at-91.html | archive-date=June 2, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>  By 1986, Tony Bennett was re-signed to Columbia Records, this time with creative control, and released ''[[The Art of Excellence]]''.

=== 1990–1995: An unexpected audience ===
Danny Bennett felt that younger audiences who were unfamiliar with his father would respond to his music if given a chance.<ref name="nyt050194">{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E5D91F31F932A35756C0A962958260 | title=When He Croons, Slackers Listen | author=Marchese, John | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 1, 1994}}</ref> No changes to Tony's formal appearance, singing style, musical accompaniment (The Ralph Sharon Trio or an orchestra), or song choice (generally the [[Great American Songbook]]) were necessary or desirable.<ref name="amg-bio"/><ref name="nyt102193"/> Accordingly, Danny began regularly to book his father on  ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', a show with a younger, "hip" audience.<ref name="nyt050194"/> This was subsequently followed by appearances on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'', and various [[MTV]] programs.<ref name="ghk0495"/><ref name="aarp"/> In 1993, Bennett played a series of benefit concerts organized by [[alternative rock]] radio stations around the country.<ref name="nyt050194"/> The plan worked; as Tony later remembered, "I realized that young people had never heard those songs. Cole Porter, Gershwin &ndash; they were like, 'Who wrote that?' To them, it was different. If you're different, you stand out."<ref name="aarp"/>

During this time, Bennett continued to record, first putting out the acclaimed look-back ''[[Astoria: Portrait of the Artist]]'' (1990), then emphasizing themed albums such as the Sinatra homage ''[[Perfectly Frank]]'' (1992) and the [[Fred Astaire]] tribute ''[[Steppin' Out (Tony Bennett album)|Steppin' Out]]'' (1993). The latter two both achieved gold status and won Grammys for [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance|Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance]] (Bennett's first Grammys since 1962) and further established Bennett as the inheritor of the mantle of a classic American great.<ref name="nyt050194"/>

As Bennett was seen at ''[[MTV Video Music Awards]]'' shows side-by-side with the likes of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and [[Flavor Flav]], and as his "[[Steppin' Out with My Baby]]" video received MTV airplay,<ref name="nyt050194"/> it was clear that, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Tony Bennett has not just bridged the generation gap, he has demolished it. He has solidly connected with a younger crowd weaned on rock. And there have been no compromises."<ref name="nyt060194">{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05EEDB103BF932A35755C0A962958260 | title=Tony Bennett and MTV: Talk About Bedfellows | author=[[John J.

The new audience reached its height with Bennett's appearance in 1994 on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''.<ref name="nyt050299"/> (He quipped on the show, "I've been unplugged my whole career.") Featuring guest appearances by rock and country stars [[Elvis Costello]] and [[k.d. lang]] (both of whom had an affinity for the standards genre), the show attracted a considerable audience and much media attention.<ref name="nyt050194"/> The resulting ''[[MTV Unplugged: Tony Bennett]]'' album went platinum and, besides taking the Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance Grammy award for the third straight year, also won the top Grammy prize of [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]].<ref name="npr-jazz"/><ref name="ammasters"/>

===Musical style===
Regarding his choices in music, Bennett reiterated his artistic stance in a 2010 interview:
{{quote|I'm not staying contemporary for the big record companies, I don't follow the latest fashions. I never sing a song that's badly written. In the 1920s and '30s, there was a renaissance in music that was the equivalent of the artistic Renaissance. Cole Porter, Johnny Mercer and others just created the best songs that had ever been written. These are classics, and finally they're not being treated as light entertainment. This is classical music.<ref>{{cite news | author=Clodfelter, Tim | title=Tony Bennett says a key to his continued success is being true to the audience | newspaper=[[Winston-Salem Journal]] | date=September 5, 2010}}</ref>}}
