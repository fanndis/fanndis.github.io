{{Politics of New Zealand |expanded = Legislature }} 
The '''New Zealand Parliament''' ({{lang-mi|Pāremata Aotearoa}}) is the [[unicameral]] [[legislature]] of [[New Zealand]], consisting of the [[Monarchy of New Zealand|Queen of New Zealand]] ([[Queen-in-Parliament]]) and the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]]. The Queen is usually represented by her [[Governor-General of New Zealand|governor-general]].<ref name="McLean">{{cite web |last = McLean |first = Gavin |title=Governors and governors-general – Constitutional duties |url = https://teara.govt.nz/en/governors-and-governors-general/page-3 |work=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |access-date=1 July 2017 |date=28 September 2016 }}</ref> Before 1951, there was an [[upper chamber]], the [[New Zealand Legislative Council]]. The New Zealand Parliament was established in 1854 and is one of the oldest continuously functioning legislatures in the world.<ref name="Martin">{{cite web |first = John E. |last=Martin |title = Parliament |url = http://teara.govt.nz/en/parliament |work=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |date=17 February 2015 |access-date=30 August 2016 }}</ref> It has met in [[Wellington]], the [[capital of New Zealand]], since 1865.

The House of Representatives normally consists of 120 [[members of Parliament]] (MPs), though sometimes more due to [[overhang seat]]s. There are 72 MPs elected directly in [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]] while the remainder of seats are assigned to [[list MP]]s based on each [[List of political parties in New Zealand|party]]'s share of the total party vote. [[Māori people|Māori]] were represented in Parliament from 1867, and in 1893 [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|women gained the vote]].<ref name="Martin" /> Although [[elections in New Zealand|elections]] can be called early, each three years Parliament is [[dissolution of parliament|dissolved]] and goes up for reelection.

Parliament is [[Fusion of powers|closely linked]] to the [[Executive (government)|executive]]. The [[New Zealand Government]] comprises a [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]] (head of government) and other [[Ministers of the New Zealand Government|ministers]]. In accordance with the principle of [[responsible government]], these individuals are always drawn from the House of Representatives, and are held [[Accountability#Political accountability|accountable]] to it.

Neither the monarch (currently [[Queen Elizabeth II]]) nor her governor-general participates in the legislative process, save for signifying the Queen's approval to a [[Bill (law)|bill]] passed by the House, known as the granting of [[Royal Assent]], which is necessary for a bill to be enacted as law. The governor-general also formally [[writ of summons|summons]] and dissolves Parliament – the latter in order to call a [[general election]].

==History==
===Westminster model===
{{See also|History of Parliamentarism#Britain and the Commonwealth}}
The New Zealand Parliament is consciously modelled on the [[Westminster system]] of [[parliament|parliamentary representation]], developed in the [[United Kingdom]]. This system can be traced back to the "[[Model Parliament]]" of 1295.<ref name="brief">{{cite web |title=Parliament Brief : What is Parliament? |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/fact-sheets/pbrief7/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=2 July 2018 |date=21 March 2014}}</ref>

Over the centuries, parliaments progressively [[constitutional monarchy|limited the power]] of the monarchy. The [[Bill of Rights 1688]] (which has been ratified as law in New Zealand)<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill of Rights 1688 No 2 (as at 26 March 2015), Imperial Act |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/imperial/1688/0002/latest/whole.html |publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office |accessdate=11 November 2018 |language=en-NZ |date=16 December 1689}}</ref> established a system where parliaments would be regularly elected. Among its provisions, it set out parliament's role in taxation and [[Appropriation bill|supply]]. Thee Bill of Rights also confirmed absolute [[freedom of speech]] in parliament.<ref name="brief"/>

===Establishment===
As early as 1846 the British settlers in New Zealand petitioned for [[self-government]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=McIntyre |first1=W. David |author-link=W. David McIntyre |title=Self-government and independence – Crown Colony |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/self-government-and-independence/page-1 |work=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=2 July 2018 |date=20 June 2012}}</ref> The New Zealand Parliament was created by the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]], an Act of the [[British Parliament]],<ref name="McIntyre2012">{{cite web |last1=McIntyre |first1=W.

It had a lower house, called the House of Representatives, and an upper house, called the Legislative Council.<ref name="McIntyre2012"/> The members of the House were elected under the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] (FPP) voting system, while those of the Council were appointed by the governor. The first members were sworn in on 24 May 1854 in Auckland.<ref name="first sitting">{{cite web |title=First sitting, 1854 |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/history-of-parliament/first-sitting-1854 |website=NZ History |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=22 February 2019 |date=19 August 2014}}</ref>

====Upper house abolished====
[[File:General Assembly House, 1861.png|thumb|left|The [[General Assembly House]] in Auckland, 1861]] 
Initially, legislative councillors were appointed for life, but from the 1890s they were appointed for renewable seven-year terms.<ref name="abolished">{{cite web |title=Legislative Council abolished |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/legislative-council-abolished |website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref> This change, coupled with [[responsible government]] (whereby the premier advised the governor on Council appointments) and [[party politics]], meant that by the 20th century, the government usually controlled the Council as well as the House, and the passage of bills through the Council became a formality.<ref name="structural changes">{{cite web |last = Martin |first = John E. |title = Parliament – Structural changes, 1890s to 1950s |url = https://teara.govt.nz/en/parliament/page-7 |work= Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=2 July 2018 |date=1 February 2015 }}</ref> In 1951, the Council was ended altogether, making the New Zealand legislature [[unicameralism|unicameral]].<ref>[[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Palmer, Geoffrey]].

''The New Zealand Journal of Public and International Law'' 15, no. 1 (2017): 123–47.</ref> The Council sat for the last time on 1 December 1950, before it was formally abolished on 1 January 1951.<ref name="abolished"/>

At the time of its abolition the upper house had fifty-four members, including its own [[Speaker of the New Zealand Legislative Council|speaker]].<ref name="Legislative Council Chamber">{{cite web |title=Legislative Council Chamber |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/history-and-buildings/buildings-and-grounds/parliament-house/legislative-council-chamber/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en}}</ref>

===Provincial government===
Under the Constitution Act, legislative power was also conferred on [[Provinces of New Zealand|New Zealand's provinces]] (originally six in number), each of which had its own elected provincial council.<ref name="McIntyre2012"/> These provincial councils were able to legislate for their provinces on most subjects. New Zealand was never a [[federation]] comparable to Canada or Australia; Parliament could legislate concurrently with the provinces on any matter, and in the event of a conflict, the law passed by Parliament would prevail.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=McLintock |editor-first=Alexander Hare |editor-link=Alexander Hare McLintock |title=Constitutional History – The 1852 Constitution and Responsible Government |url = https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/history-constitutional/page-4 |encyclopedia=[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]] |access-date=8 November 2019 |year=1966 }}</ref> Over a twenty-year period, political power was progressively centralised, and the provinces were abolished altogether in 1876.<ref name="Martin 2015" />

===Māori representation===
{{Main|Māori electorates}}
New Zealand had representatives of the [[indigenous population]] in its parliament from an early date. Reserved Māori seats were created in 1867 during the term of the [[4th New Zealand Parliament|4th Parliament]];<ref name="McIntyre2012"/> Māori men aged 21 and over, whether or not they owned property, could vote to elect four Māori members of the House of Representatives.<ref name="Martin 2015"/>

The Māori electorates have lasted far longer than the intended five years. In 2002, the seats increased in number to seven.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/census_counts/NumberofElectoratesandElectoralPopulations_HOTP2013Census/Commentary.aspx |title=Number of Electorates and Electoral Populations: 2013 Census |publisher=Statistics New Zealand }}</ref>

===Country quota===
One historical speciality of the New Zealand Parliament was the [[country quota]], which gave greater representation to rural politics. From 1889 on (and even earlier in more informal forms), districts were weighted according to their urban/rural split (with any locality of less than 2,000 people considered rural). Those districts which had large rural proportions received a greater number of nominal votes than they actually contained voters – as an example, in 1927, [[Waipawa]], a district without any urban population at all, received an additional 4,153 nominal votes to its actual 14,838 – having the maximum factor of 28% extra representation. The country quota was in effect until it was abolished in 1945 by a mostly urban-elected [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour government]], which switched to a [[one person, one vote|one-vote-per-person]] system.<ref name="NZHA90">{{cite book |editor-last=McKinnon |editor-first=Malcolm |title = New Zealand Historical Atlas |year=1997 |publisher=David Bateman |at=Plate 90 }}</ref>

===Modern independent legislature===

[[File:NZ House of Representatives, ca 1900-1902.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Chamber of the House of Representatives, {{circa|1900–1902}}]]

Originally the New Zealand Parliament remained subordinate to the British Parliament, the supreme legislative authority for the entire British Empire—although, in practice, Britain's role was minimal from the 1890s.<ref name="structural changes"/> The New Zealand Parliament received progressively more control over New Zealand affairs through the passage of Imperial (British) laws such as the [[Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865]], constitutional amendments, and an increasingly hands-off approach by the British government. In 1947, the New Zealand Parliament passed the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947|Statute of Westminster Adoption Act]], giving that parliament full power over New Zealand law,<ref name="structural changes" /> and the [[New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act 1947]], an Act of the British Parliament, allowed the New Zealand Parliament to regulate its own composition. In 1973 a further amendment, the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852#New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act 1973|New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act 1973]], expanded the territorial jurisdiction of New Zealand's parliament.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/nzcaa19731973n114390.pdf |title=New Zealand Constitution Amendement Act 1973 |publisher=[[New Zealand Legal Information Institute]] |access-date=15 February 2020 |year=1973 |quote = The General Assembly shall have full power to make laws having effect in, or in respect of, New Zealand or any part thereof and laws having effect outside New Zealand.}}</ref>

In 1986 a new [[Constitution Act 1986|Constitution Act]] was passed, finally removing the power for the British Parliament to pass laws affecting New Zealand (which was by then only with New Zealand's consent), restating the few remaining provisions of the 1852 Act, consolidating the legislation establishing Parliament, and officially replacing the name "General Assembly" with "Parliament".<ref name="Constitution_Act_1986">{{cite web |title=Constitution Act 1986 |url = http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1986/0114/latest/DLM94204.html |publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office |access-date=11 November 2018 |date=13 December 1986}}</ref>

Beginning in the 1890s, when the [[New Zealand Liberal Party]] was established as the first formal [[List of political parties in New Zealand|political party in New Zealand]], political power shifted from the House of Representatives to elections, parties and leaders. The conservative [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform Party]] was formed in 1909, and the [[New Zealand Labour Party]] in 1916. The [[New Zealand National Party]] emerged in 1936 from the amalgamation of Reform and a remnant of the Liberals, the [[United Party (New Zealand)|United Party]].<ref name="structural changes"/> As of the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2020 general election]], the current parties represented in the House of Representatives are National, Labour, the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]], [[ACT New Zealand]], and the [[Māori Party]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliamentary parties |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/political-parties/ |website=www.parliament.nz |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |language=en-NZ |date=October 2020 |access-date=7 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=2020 General Election and Referendums – Official Result |url = https://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2020/ |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] |access-date=7 November 2020 |date=6 November 2020}}</ref>

Labour Member of Parliament [[Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan]] was the longest-serving female MP (1967–1996) and was also the first MP to give birth while serving in office. National MP [[Ruth Richardson]] was the first MP to bring her baby into the debating chamber while fellow National MP [[Katherine Rich]] was the first MP to feed her baby in the House. During the 1990s, a child care centre was established for the children of MPs and parliamentary staff.<ref name="Parliament family friendly">{{cite web |title=Parliament becoming more family-friendly |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features/parliament-becoming-more-family-friendly/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |access-date=18 September 2019 |date=15 November 2017}}</ref><ref name="NZWW Feb 2019">{{cite news |last = Nissen |first =Wendyl |title=Babies and the Beehive: Trevor Mallard's big plans for a child-friendly Parliament |url = https://www.nowtolove.co.nz/lifestyle/career/trevor-mallard-plans-for-child-friendly-parliament-40381 |access-date=18 September 2019 |publisher=[[New Zealand Woman's Weekly]] |date=5 February 2019 }}</ref> In November 2017, the [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Trevor Mallard]] announced that Parliament would becoming more "baby friendly."<ref name="Parliament family friendly" /><ref>{{cite news |last = Walters |first = Laura |title = New Zealand's new baby-friend parliament |url = https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/98699747/new-zealands-new-babyfriendly-parliament?rm=m |access-date=18 September 2019 |website=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=9 November 2017 }}</ref> Family friendly policies have included making an atrium near the parliamentary chamber accessible to MP's children, giving carers and spouses the same security clearances as MPs, opening the Parliamentary swimming pool to the families of MPs and staff, and updating the family room to have baby-feeding and changing facilities, and a proposed play area on Parliament's lawn.<ref name="NZWW Feb 2019" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Bramwell |first=Chris |title = First look: Parliament lawn to feature playground |url = https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/358913/first-look-parliament-lawn-to-feature-playground |access-date=18 September 2019 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=5 June 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Walters |first=Laura |title = Parliament to add a playground for kids to its grounds |url = https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/104458873/parliament-to-add-a-playground-for-kids-to-its-grounds |access-date=18 September 2019 |website=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=5 June 2018 }}</ref>

==Sovereignty==
{{Further|Parliamentary sovereignty}}

The New Zealand Parliament is supreme, with no other government institution able to over-ride its decisions.<ref name="brief"/> The ability of Parliament to act is, legally, unimpeded.<ref name="Glossary">{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.ourconstitution.org.nz/Glossary|website=www.ourconstitution.org.nz|publisher=Constitutional Advisory Panel|language=en|access-date=2 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406042022/http://www.ourconstitution.org.nz/Glossary|archive-date=6 April 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] is a normal piece of legislation, not superior law, as [[codified constitution]]s are in some other countries.

The House of Representatives has the exclusive power to regulate its own procedures. The House has "[[Entrenched clause|entrenched]]" certain issues relating to elections. These include the length of a parliamentary term, deciding on who can vote, how they vote (via secret ballot), how the country should be divided into electorates, and the make-up of the Representation Commission, which decides on these electorates.<ref>{{cite web |title=Electoral Act 1993 No 87 (as at 01 May 2017), Public Act 268 Restriction on amendment or repeal of certain provisions |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM310495.html#DLM310495|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|publisher=New Zealand Legislation|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en-NZ}}</ref> These issues require either 75% of all MPs to support the bill or a [[Referendums in New Zealand|referendum]] on the issue.<ref name="Glossary"/> As the entrenchment mechanism is not entrenched itself, it could be repealed by a simple majority, thus allowing the entrenched provisions of the Electoral Act to also be repealed by a simple majority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/parliamentary-practice-in-new-zealand/chapter-2-the-basis-of-parliamentary-procedure/|title=Chapter 2 The Basis of Parliamentary Procedure – New Zealand Parliament|website=www.parliament.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elkind|first=Jerome B.|date=1987|title=A New Look at Entrenchment|journal=The Modern Law Review|volume=50|issue=2|pages=158–175|issn=0026-7961|jstor=1096137|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2230.1987.tb02570.x}}</ref>

===House of Representatives===
{{Main|New Zealand House of Representatives}}

[[File:House of Representatives crest.png|thumb|upright=0.55|House of Representatives crest, surmounted by a [[St Edward's Crown]]]]

The House of Representatives was established as a [[lower house]] and has been the Parliament's [[unicameral|sole house]] since 1951.<ref name="Martin" />  Since the introduction of MMP in 1996, the House consists of 120 members of Parliament (MPs), elected to a three-year term. [[Elections in New Zealand|Parliamentary elections]] use the [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) system, a hybrid of [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] and [[party-list proportional representation]]; 71 MPs represent single-member [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]] of roughly the same population,<ref>{{cite web |title=Number of Electorates and Electoral Populations: 2013 Census |url = http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/census_counts/NumberofElectoratesandElectoralPopulations_MR2013Census.aspx |publisher=Statistics New Zealand |access-date=1 July 2017 |language=en-NZ |year=2013 }}</ref> while the remainder are [[list MPs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=MPs and Electorates|url = https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |access-date=26 May 2018 |language=en-NZ }}</ref> These MPs assemble to represent the people, pass laws and supervise the work of government.<ref name="parl_role">{{cite web |title=Role of Parliament |url = https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/role-of-parliament/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |access-date=17 August 2017 |language=en-NZ }}</ref>{{sfn|Wood|Rudd|2004|pp=52−55}} Members also form [[New Zealand House of Representatives committees|select committees of the House]], appointed to deal with particular areas or issues.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=147}}

[[Ministers of the New Zealand Government]] are always drawn from amongst the members of the House of Representatives (before 1951, there were also ministers who sat in the Legislative Council). The government of the day, and by extension the prime minister, must achieve and maintain the support of the House in order to gain and remain in power.<ref name="Martin" /> The Government is dependent on Parliament to implement its legislative agenda, and has always required the [[Appropriation bill|House's approval to spend money]].<ref name="parl_role"/>

===Upper house===
The Parliament does not have an [[upper house]]; there was an upper house up to 1951, and there have been occasional suggestions to create a new one.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=147}} The Legislative Council chamber continues to be used during the Opening of Parliament.<ref name="Legislative Council Chamber"/> This is in keeping with the British tradition in which the monarch is barred from entering the lower house.<ref name="Opening of Parliament"/><ref name="brief"/>

The original Legislative Council was created by the ''Charter for Erecting the [[Colony of New Zealand]]'' on 16 November 1840,<ref name="birth certificates">{{cite book|title=New Zealand Birth Certificates – 50 of New Zealand's Founding Documents|author=Paul Moon|publisher=AUT Media|year=2010|isbn=9780958299718|author-link=Paul Moon}}</ref> which saw New Zealand established as a [[Crown colony]] separate from New South Wales on 1 July 1841.<ref name="birth certificates" /> Originally, the Legislative Council consisted of the governor, [[Colonial Secretary (New Zealand)|colonial secretary]] and [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|colonial treasurer]] (who comprised the Executive Council), and three [[justices of the peace]] appointed by the governor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/history-of-the-governor-general/crown-colony-era|title=Crown colony era – the Governor-General|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> The Legislative Council had the power to issue [[Act of Parliament|Ordinances]] (statutory instruments).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Mac01Comp-t1-g1-t5-g1-t2-g1-t21.html|title=No. 21. — Charter for Erecting the Colony of New Zealand, and for Creating and Establishing a Legislative Council and an Executive Council, and for Granting Certain Powers and Authorities to the Governor for the Time Being of the Said Colony|publisher=[[Victoria University of Wellington]]|accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>

With the passing of the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]], the Legislative Council became the upper house of the General Assembly. The Legislative Council was intended to scrutinise and amend bills passed by the House of Representatives, although it could not initiate legislation or amend money bills. Despite occasional proposals for an elected Council, members of the Legislative Council (MLCs) were appointed by the governor, generally on the recommendation of the prime minister.<ref name="structural changes"/> It was eventually decided that the Council was having no significant impact on New Zealand's legislative process; its final sitting was on 1 December 1950.<ref>{{cite web |title=Last meeting of the Legislative Council, 1950 |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/speech/35917/last-meeting-of-the-legislative-council-1950 |work=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=25 August 2017}}</ref>

====Senate proposals====
In September 1950, the [[New Zealand National Party|National]] government of [[Sidney Holland]] set up a constitutional reform committee to consider an alternative second chamber, chaired by [[Ronald Algie]]. A report produced by the committee in 1952 proposed a nominated [[Senate]], with 32 members, appointed by leaders of the parties in the House of Representatives, according to the parties' strength in that House. Senators would serve for three-year-terms, and be eligible for reappointment.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/newzealandlegisl0000jack <!-- quote=Senate. --> ''The New Zealand Legislative Council : A Study of the Establishment, Failure and Abolition of an Upper House''], William Keith Jackson, [[University of Otago|University of Otago Press]], page 200</ref> The Senate would have the power to revise, initiate or delay legislation, to hear petitions, and to scrutinise regulations and [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]], but the proposal was rejected by the Prime Minister and by the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] opposition, which had refused to nominate members to the committee.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?ei=2NUPTITfIJOXsQbu3oTaCA&ct=result&id=v7RBAAAAYAAJ&dq=Ronald+Algie+Senate&q=Senate ''Memoirs: 1912–1960''], [[Jack Marshall|Sir John Marshall]], Collins, 1984, 159–60</ref>

After the 1990 election, the [[New Zealand National Party|National]] government of [[Jim Bolger]] proposed the establishment of an elected Senate, thereby reinstating a [[bicameral]] system, and a Senate Bill was drafted. Under the Bill, the Senate would have 30 members, elected by [[Single Transferable Vote|STV]], from six senatorial districts, four in the [[North Island]] and two in the [[South Island]]. Like the old Legislative Council it would not have powers to amend or delay money bills.<ref name = "Hansard1994">{{cite web | url=http://www.vdig.net/hansard/content.jsp?id=41473 | title=Senate Bill : Report of Electoral Law Committee | date=7 June 1994 | access-date=23 May 2020 }}</ref> The intention was to include a question on a Senate in the second referendum on [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|electoral reform]].

In 2010, the New Zealand Policy Unit of the [[Centre for Independent Studies]] proposed a Senate in the context of the 2011 referendum on MMP. They proposed a proportionally-elected upper house made up 31 seats elected using a proportional list vote by region, with the House of Representatives elected by FPP and consisting of 79 seats.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cis.org.nz/policy_monographs/pm109.pdf |publisher=[[Centre for Independent Studies]] |date=24 March 2010 |title=Superseding MMP: Real Electoral Reform for New Zealand |author1=Luke Malpass |author2 = [[Oliver Marc Hartwich]] |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100602174657/http://www.cis.org.nz/policy_monographs/pm109.pdf |archive-date = 2 June 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>

A term of Parliament in New Zealand may not last more than three years. The [[Constitution Act 1986]] outlines that the governor-general is responsible for [[dissolution of parliament|dissolving]] Parliament,{{refn|The House of Representatives itself is regarded as always in existence, notwithstanding that Parliament has been dissolved or has expired.|group=note}}<ref name="Constitution_Act_1986"/> which is done by [[royal proclamation]].<ref name="Dissolution">{{cite web |title=Summoning, Proroguing and Dissolving Parliament |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/parliamentary-practice-in-new-zealand/chapter-10-summoning-proroguing-and-dissolving-parliament/#_ftnref34 |website=www.parliament.nz |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |access-date=29 August 2019 |language=en-NZ }}</ref> Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, after which the [[writ of election|writs for a general election]] are usually issued.<ref>{{cite web |title=Writ-ten in the stars |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/parliament-in-election-year/writ-ten-in-the-stars/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |access-date=11 November 2018 |language=en-NZ |date=23 August 2017}}</ref> Upon completion of the election, the governor-general, on the [[advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the prime minister, then issues a proclamation summoning Parliament to assemble.<ref name="Dissolution"/> On the date given, new MPs are [[Oath of Allegiance (New Zealand)|sworn in]] and then are, along with returning MPs, called to the old Legislative Council chamber, where they are instructed to elect their [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|speaker]] and return to the House of Representatives to do so before adjourning.<ref name="Opening of Parliament">{{cite web |title=Opening of Parliament ceremonies on 8 and 9 December 2008 |url = https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews051220081/opening-of-parliament-ceremonies-on-8-and-9-december-2008 |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |access-date=11 November 2018 |date=5 December 2008 }}</ref>

A new parliamentary session is marked by the [[State Opening of Parliament#Equivalents in other countries|Opening of Parliament]], during which the governor-general reads the [[Speech from the Throne]], on the Queen's behalf. This speech is given at the start of every new Parliament, and explains why Parliament has been assembled. It outlines the Government's legislative agenda.<ref name="Opening of Parliament" /> On occasion, the monarch may open Parliament and deliver the speech herself; for example, the Queen has personally attended the Opening of Parliament in 1954 (to mark the legislature's centenary),<ref name="first sitting" /><ref>{{British pathe|v=8QL56mqTFg8|year=1954}}</ref> and more recently in 1986 and 1990.<ref>{{cite web |title=State opening of Parliament, 1986 |url = https://teara.govt.nz/en/video/33760/state-opening-of-parliament-1986|work=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=21 May 2018 |language=en-NZ }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Display of royal memorabilia |url = https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews201104261/display-of-royal-memorabilia |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |access-date=12 November 2018 |language=en-NZ |date=29 April 2011 |quote=During her first eagerly awaited tour over the summer of 1953–54 Parliament was summoned for a special short session in January to allow her to open Parliament and deliver the Speech from the Throne.

==Passage of legislation==
[[File:Haka Ka Mate Attribution Act 2014.pdf|thumb|An Act of Parliament. The [[short title]] is ''Haka Ka Mate Attribution Act 2014''.]]
Before any law is passed, it is first introduced in Parliament as a draft known as a [[bill (law)|bill]].<ref name="chapter7">{{cite web|title=Chapter 7 Parties and Government|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/document/00HOOOCPPNZ_71|website=www.parliament.nz|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=23 November 2017|language=en|date=14 October 2010}}</ref> The majority of bills are promulgated by the government of the day. It is rare for government bills to be defeated (the first to be defeated in the 20th century was in 1998).<ref name="chapter7"/> It is also possible for individual MPs to promote their own bills, called [[Private member's bill|member's bills]]; these are usually put forward by opposition parties, or by MPs who wish to deal with a matter that parties do not take positions on. All bills must go through three readings in the House of Representatives before receiving [[Royal Assent]] to become an [[Act of Parliament]] ([[Lists of statutes of New Zealand|statutory law]]).<ref name="chapter7"/>

===House and committees===
{{Further|New Zealand House of Representatives#Passage of legislation}}
Each bill goes through several stages before it becomes a law. The first stage is a mere formality known as the [[first reading]], where it is introduced without a debate. This is followed by the [[second reading]], where MPs debate on the general principles of the bill. If the House opposes the bill, it may vote to reject the bill.<ref name="Martin" />

If the bill goes through the second reading, it is sent to a select committee where every clause in the bill is examined. Members of Parliament who support the bill in principle but do not agree with certain clauses can propose [[Amend (motion)|amendments]] to those clauses at this stage. Following its report back to the House, the bill will be advanced to its [[third reading]] where only minor amendments will be allowed before it is passed or rejected.<ref name="Martin" />

===Royal Assent===
[[File:Dame Patsy Reddy gave her first Royal assent. This is the final step a bill needs to go through before it becomes law.jpg|thumb|Governor-General [[Patsy Reddy|Dame Patsy Reddy]] giving Royal Assent to a bill for the first time. [[Government House, Wellington]], 28 September 2016]]

If a bill passes its third reading, it is passed by the [[Clerk of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Clerk of the House of Representatives]] to the Governor-General, who will (assuming constitutional conventions are followed) [[Royal assent#Ceremony|grant Royal Assent]] as a matter of course. Some constitutional lawyers, such as Professor Philip Joseph, believe the governor-general does retain the power to refuse Royal Assent to bills in exceptional circumstances – specifically if democracy were to be abolished.<ref>{{cite book|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law in New Zealand|isbn=978-0-86472-399-4|author=Philip Joseph|publisher=Brookers|year=2002|edition=2nd}}</ref> Others, such as former law professor and Prime Minister [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Sir Geoffrey Palmer]] and Professor [[Matthew Palmer]] argue any refusal of Royal Assent would cause a [[constitutional crisis]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Bridled Power: New Zealand's Constitution and Government|isbn=978-0-19-558463-9|author=[[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Sir Geoffrey Palmer]] and [[Matthew Palmer]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|edition=4th}}</ref>

As a practical reality, because the Royal Assent to a bill must follow quickly after its passage by the House of Representatives, if there is any substantial issue about the constitutional validity of a bill, the issue must be considered by the [[Attorney-General (New Zealand)|Attorney-General]] before the bill is introduced into the House.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 – The Legislation Design and Advisory Committee|url=http://www.ldac.org.nz/guidelines/lac-revised-guidelines/chapter-5/|publisher=New Zealand Legislation Design and Advisory Committee|accessdate=13 May 2017|language=en-NZ|archive-date=21 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421031141/http://www.ldac.org.nz/guidelines/lac-revised-guidelines/chapter-5|url-status=dead}}</ref>
