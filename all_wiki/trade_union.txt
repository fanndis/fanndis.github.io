A '''trade union''' (or a '''labor union''' in [[American English]]), often simply called a '''union''', is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve many common goals, such as protecting the integrity of their trade, improving safety standards, and attaining better wages, benefits (such as vacation, health care, and retirement), and working conditions through the increased bargaining power wielded by the creation of a monopoly of the workers. Trade unions typically fund the formal organization, head office, and legal team functions of the trade union through regular fees or union dues. The delegate staff of the trade union representation in the workforce are made up of workplace volunteers who are appointed by members in democratic elections.

The trade union, through an elected leadership and bargaining committee, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members ([[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] members) and negotiates [[Labour and employment law|labour contracts]] (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is "maintaining or improving the conditions of their [[employment]]".<ref name="webb">{{cite book|last1=Webb|first1=Sidney|last2=Webb|first2= Beatrice|title=History of Trade Unionism|publisher=Longmans and Co. London |year=1920}} ch. I</ref> This may include the negotiation of [[wage]]s, work rules, occupational health and safety standards, complaint procedures, rules governing status of employees including promotions, just cause conditions for termination, and employment benefits.

Unions may organize a particular section of skilled workers ([[craft unionism]]),<ref name="Poole, M. 1986">Poole, M., 1986. Industrial Relations: Origins and Patterns of National Diversity. London UK: Routledge.</ref> a cross-section of workers from various trades ([[general union]]ism), or attempt to organize all workers within a particular industry ([[industrial unionism]]). The agreements negotiated by a union are binding on the rank and file members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers. Trade unions traditionally have a constitution which details the governance of their bargaining unit and also have governance at various levels of government depending on the industry that binds them legally to their negotiations and functioning.

Originating in Great Britain, trade unions became popular in many countries during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Trade unions may be composed of individual workers, [[professional]]s, [[Retiree|past workers]], students, [[apprentice]]s or the unemployed. Trade union density, or the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union, [[#Prevalence_worldwide|is highest in the Nordic countries]].<ref>[http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TUD] OECD.

Since the publication of the ''[[History of Trade Unionism]]'' (1894) by [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], the predominant historical view is that a trade union "is a continuous association on wage earners for the purpose of maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment."<ref name="webb" /> [[Karl Marx]] described trade unions thus: "The value of labour-power constitutes the conscious and explicit foundation of the trade unions, whose importance for the [...] working class can scarcely be overestimated. The trade unions aim at nothing less than to prevent the reduction of wages below the level that is traditionally maintained in the various branches of industry. That is to say, they wish to prevent the price of labour-power from falling below its value" (''Capital'' V1, 1867, p.&nbsp;1069).

A modern definition by the Australian Bureau of Statistics states that a trade union is "an organization consisting predominantly of employees, the principal activities of which include the negotiation of rates of pay and conditions of employment for its members."<ref>{{cite web |title=Trade Union Census |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/0/9FCBBF538897395ACA2570EC001A6CED?OpenDocument |access-date=27 July 2011}}</ref>

Yet historian R.A. Leeson, in ''United we Stand'' (1971), said:
{{quote|Two conflicting views of the trade-union movement strove for ascendancy in the nineteenth century: one the defensive-restrictive guild-craft tradition passed down through journeymen's clubs and friendly societies, ... the other the aggressive-expansionist drive to unite all 'labouring men and women' for a 'different order of things'.}}

Recent historical research by Bob James in ''Craft, Trade or Mystery'' (2001) puts forward the view that trade unions are part of a broader movement of [[benefit society|benefit societies]], which includes medieval guilds, [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], [[independent Order of Odd Fellows|Oddfellows]], [[Friendly Society|friendly societies]], and other [[fraternal organisation|fraternal organizations]].

The 18th century [[economist]] [[Adam Smith]] noted the imbalance in the rights of workers in regards to owners (or "masters"). In ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', [[s:Chapter 8: Of the Wages of Labour|Book I, chapter 8]], Smith wrote:

{{quote|We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combination of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labor above their actual rate[.]

When workers combine, masters ... never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil magistrate, and the rigorous execution of those laws which have been enacted with so much severity against the combination of servants, labourers and journeymen.}}

As Smith noted, unions were illegal for many years in most countries, although Smith argued that it should remain illegal to fix wages or prices by employees or employers. There were severe penalties for attempting to organize unions, up to and including execution. Despite this, unions were formed and began to acquire [[political power]], eventually resulting in a body of labour law that not only legalized organizing efforts, but codified the relationship between employers and those employees organized into unions.

==History==
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|thumb|Early 19th century workplace militancy manifested in the [[Luddism|Luddite riots]], when unemployed workers destroyed labour saving machines]]
The origins of trade unions can be traced back to 18th century Britain, where the [[Industrial Revolution|rapid expansion of industrial society]] then taking place drew women, children, rural workers and immigrants into the work force in large numbers and in new roles. They encountered a large hostility in their early existence from employers and government groups; at the time, unions and unionists were regularly prosecuted under various restraint of trade and conspiracy statutes. This pool of unskilled and semi-skilled labour spontaneously organized in fits and starts throughout its beginnings,<ref name="webb"/> and would later be an important arena for the development of trade unions. Trade unions have sometimes been seen as successors to the [[guild]]s of [[medieval Europe]], though the relationship between the two is disputed, as the masters of the guilds employed workers (apprentices and journeymen) who were not allowed to organize.<ref>(1928).

''The Age''.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Kautsky|first=Karl|title=Trades Unions and Socialism|journal=International Socialist Review |date=April 1901 |volume=1 |issue=10 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1901/04/unions.htm|access-date=27 July 2011}}</ref>

Trade unions and collective bargaining were outlawed from no later than the middle of the 14th century, when the [[Ordinance of Labourers]] was enacted in the [[Kingdom of England]], but their way of thinking was the one that endured down the centuries, inspiring evolutions and advances in thinking which eventually gave workers their necessary rights. As collective bargaining and early worker unions grew with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the government began to clamp down on what it saw as the danger of popular unrest at the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1799, the [[Combination Act]] was passed, which banned trade unions and collective bargaining by British workers. Although the unions were subject to often severe repression until 1824, they were already widespread in cities such as [[London]]. Workplace militancy had also manifested itself as [[Luddism]] and had been prominent in struggles such as the [[1820 Rising]] in Scotland, in which 60,000 workers went on a [[general strike]], which was soon crushed. Sympathy for the plight of the workers brought repeal of the acts in 1824, although the [[Combination Act 1825]] severely restricted their activity.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

By the 1810s, the first labour organizations to bring together workers of divergent occupations were formed. Possibly the first such union was the General Union of Trades, also known as the Philanthropic Society, founded in 1818 in [[Manchester]]. The latter name was to hide the organization's real purpose in a time when trade unions were still illegal.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YaBzZXueFFYC|title=Attempts at General Union|author=G. D. H. Cole|year=2010|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=3|isbn=9781136885167}}</ref>

===National general unions===
[[File:London Trades Demonstration.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster issued by the London Trades Council, advertising a demonstration held on 2 June 1873]]
The first attempts at setting up a national [[general union]] were made in the 1820s and 30s. The [[National Association for the Protection of Labour]] was established in 1830 by [[John Doherty (trade unionist)|John Doherty]], after an apparently unsuccessful attempt to create a similar national presence with the National Union of Cotton-spinners. The Association quickly enrolled approximately 150 unions, consisting mostly of textile related unions, but also including mechanics, blacksmiths, and various others. Membership rose to between 10,000 and 20,000 individuals spread across the five counties of [[Lancashire]], [[Cheshire]], [[Derbyshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]] and [[Leicestershire]] within a year.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Webb | first1 = Sidney | author-link = Sidney James Webb, 1st Baron Passfield |last2= Webb | first2= Beatrice | year = 1894| title = [[History of Trade Unionism]] | publisher = Longmans Green and Co | location = London| pages = [https://archive.org/details/historyoftradeun00webb/page/120 120–124]}}</ref> To establish awareness and legitimacy, the union started the weekly ''Voice of the People'' publication, having the declared intention "to unite the productive classes of the community in one common bond of union."{{sfn|Webb|Webb|1894|p=122}}

In 1834, the [[Welsh People|Welsh]] [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Robert Owen]] established the [[Grand National Consolidated Trades Union]]. The organization attracted a range of socialists from Owenites to revolutionaries and played a part in the protests after the [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]]' case, but soon collapsed.

More permanent trade unions were established from the 1850s, better resourced but often less radical. The [[London Trades Council]] was founded in 1860, and the [[Sheffield Outrages]] spurred the establishment of the [[Trades Union Congress]] in 1868, the first long-lived [[national trade union center]]. By this time, the existence and the demands of the trade unions were becoming accepted by [[liberalism|liberal]] [[middle class]] opinion. In ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1871) [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote:

<blockquote>If it were possible for the working classes, by combining among themselves, to raise or keep up the general rate of wages, it needs hardly be said that this would be a thing not to be punished, but to be welcomed and rejoiced at. Unfortunately the effect is quite beyond attainment by such means. The multitudes who compose the working class are too numerous and too widely scattered to combine at all, much more to combine effectually. If they could do so, they might doubtless succeed in diminishing the hours of labour, and obtaining the same wages for less work. They would also have a limited power of obtaining, by combination, an increase of general wages at the expense of profits.<ref>''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1871)[http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/mill/book5/bk5ch10 Book V, Ch.10], para. 5</ref></blockquote>

===Legalization and expansion===
[[File:1912 Lawrence Textile Strike 1.jpg|thumb|Trade union demonstrators held at bay by soldiers during the 1912 [[Lawrence textile strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]]]]
Trade unions were finally legalized in 1872, after a ''[[Royal Commission on Trade Unions]]'' in 1867 agreed that the establishment of the organizations was to the advantage of both employers and employees.

This period also saw the growth of trade unions in other industrializing countries, especially the United States, Germany and France.

In the United States, the first effective nationwide labour organization was the [[Knights of Labor]], in 1869, which began to grow after 1880. Legalization occurred slowly as a result of a series of court decisions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1357701/trade-union|title=Trade union|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> The [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] began in 1881 as a federation of different unions that did not directly enrol workers. In 1886, it became known as the [[American Federation of Labor]] or AFL.

In Germany the [[Free Association of German Trade Unions]] was formed in 1897 after the [[conservativism|conservative]] [[Anti-Socialist Laws]] of Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] were repealed.

In France, labour organization was illegal until 1884. The Bourse du Travail was founded in 1887 and merged with the Fédération nationale des syndicats (National Federation of Trade Unions) in 1895 to form the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)]].

==Prevalence worldwide==
The prevalence of unions in various countries can be measured by the concept of "union density", which is expressed as a percentage of the total number of workers in a given location who are trade union members.<ref name="ILO Stats">{{cite web |title=Industrial relations |url=https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/description_IR_EN.pdf |publisher=International Labour Organisation |access-date=9 October 2018}}</ref> Trade union density around the world shows great variation.

==Trade unions by country==
===Australia===
The [[Australian labour movement]] generally sought to end [[child labour]] practices, improve [[worker safety]], increase wages for both union workers and non-union workers, raise the entire society's [[standard of living]], reduce the hours in a work week, provide public education for children, and bring other benefits to [[working class]] families.<ref>[http://actu.com.au/AboutACTU/HistoryoftheACTU/default.aspx History of the ACTU.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121190936/http://www.actu.com.au/AboutACTU/HistoryoftheACTU/default.aspx |date=21 November 2008 }} Australian Council of Trade Unions.</ref>

[[Melbourne Trades Hall]] was opened in 1859 with [[Labour council|Trades and Labour Councils]] and [[Trades Hall]]s opening in all cities and most regional towns in the next forty years. During the 1880s [[Trade unions]] developed among [[Sheep shearer|shearers]], [[miner]]s, and [[stevedore]]s (wharf workers), but soon spread to cover almost all [[blue-collar]] jobs. Shortages of labour led to high wages for a prosperous skilled working class, whose unions demanded and got an [[eight-hour day]] and other benefits unheard of in Europe.

[[File:Melbourne eight hour day march-c1900.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eight-hour day]] march circa 1900, outside Parliament House in Spring Street, [[Melbourne]].]]

Australia gained a reputation as "the working man's paradise." Some employers tried to undercut the unions by importing Chinese labour. This produced a reaction which led to all the colonies restricting Chinese and other Asian immigration. This was the foundation of the [[White Australia Policy]]. The "Australian compact", based around centralised industrial arbitration, a degree of government assistance particularly for primary industries, and White Australia, was to continue for many years before gradually dissolving in the second half of the 20th century.

In the 1870s and 1880s, the growing [[Australian labour movement|trade union]] movement began a series of protests against foreign labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for "substandard" wages, lowered working conditions and refused unionisation.<ref name="Markey">{{cite web

The [[Barton Government]] which came to power after the first elections to the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the [[Protectionist Party]] with the support of the [[Australian Labor Party]]. The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the [[Australian Workers Union]] and other labour organisations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded.

===Baltic states===
In the Baltic states trade unions were the part of the [[Soviet Union]] trade union system and closely connected with the [[party]] in the state. [[Industrial action]]s were not a part of their activities. After 1990 trade unions in the [[Baltic states]] have experienced rapid loss of membership and [[economic power]], while employers’ organisations increased both power and membership. Low financial and organisational capacity caused by declining membership adds to the problem of interest definition, aggregation and [[protection]] in [[negotiations]] with employers’ and state organisations. Even the difference exists in the way of organization trade union and density. Starting from 2008 the union density slightly decrease in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]. In case of [[Estonia]] this indicator is lower than in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] but stays stable average 7 percent from total number of [[employment]].<ref>[http://www.zurnalai.vu.lt/STEPP/article/view/11425/9949 Dvorak, J., Karnite, R., Guogis, A.

With 65% of the workers belonging to a union [[Belgium]] is a country with one of the highest percentages of trade union membership. Only the Scandinavian countries have a higher trade union density. The biggest union with around 1.7&nbsp;million members is the Christian democrat [[Confederation of Christian Trade Unions]] (ACV-CSC) which was founded in 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/957/Binnenland/article/detail/1166041/2010/10/05/Aantal-leden-christelijke-vakbond-neemt-jaar-na-jaar-toe.dhtml|title=Aantal leden christelijke vakbond neemt jaar na jaar toe|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref> The origins of the union can be traced back to the "Anti-Socialist Cotton Workers Union" that was founded in 1886.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acv-online.be/acv-online/het-acv/Wie-zijn-we/Geschiedenis/Geschiedenis.html|title=130 jaar ACV-geschiedenis|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref> The second biggest union is the socialist [[General Federation of Belgian Labour]] (ABVV-FGTB) which has a membership of more than 1.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vlaamsabvv.be/art/pid/13618/Hoeveel-leden-telt-het-ABVV.htm|title=Hoeveel leden telt het ABVV? – Vlaams ABVV – Socialistische vakbond in Vlaanderen – Algemeen Belgisch Vakverbond ABVV|website=www.vlaamsabvv.be|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref> The ABVV-FGTB traces its origins to 1857, when the first Belgian union was founded in [[Ghent]] by a group of [[weaving|weavers]].

The third major multi-sector union in Belgium is the liberal (classical liberal) union [[General Confederation of Liberal Trade Unions of Belgium]] (ACLVB-CGSLB) which is relatively small in comparison to the first two with a little under 290 thousand members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aclvb.be/over-aclvb/structuurkerncijfers/|title=Structuur en kerncijfers van de ACLVB|date=12 October 2015|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref> The ACLVB-CGSLB was founded in 1920 in an effort to unite the many small liberal unions.

Besides these "big three" there are a number of smaller unions, some more influential than others. These smaller unions tend to specialize in one profession or economic sector. Next to these specialized unions there is also the [[:nl:Neutrale en Onafhankelijke Vakbond|Neutral and Independent Union]] that rejects the [[pillarization]] of the "big three" trade unions (their affiliation with political parties). There is also a small [[Flanders|Flemish]] nationalist union that exists only in the [[Flemish language|Flemish]]-speaking part of Belgium, called the [[:nl:Vlaamse Solidaire Vakbond|Vlaamse Solidaire Vakbond]]. The last Belgian union worth mentioning is the very small, but highly active anarchist union called the [[:nl:Vrije Bond|Vrije Bond]].

===Canada===
{{main|List of trade unions in Canada}}

Canada's first trade union, the Labourers' Benevolent Association (now International Longshoremen's Association Local 273), formed in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] in 1849. The union was formed when Saint John's longshoremen banded together to lobby for regular pay and a shorter workday.<ref>{{cite web|title=For Whom The Bells Toll|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/for-whom-the-bells-toll/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|access-date=May 6, 2017}}</ref> Canadian unionism had early ties with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and Ireland. Tradesmen who came from Britain brought traditions of the British trade union movement, and many British unions had branches in Canada. Canadian unionism's ties with the United States eventually replaced those with Britain.

Collective bargaining was first recognized in 1945, after the strike by the [[United Auto Workers]] at the [[General Motors]]' plant in [[Oshawa, Ontario]].
Justice [[Ivan Rand]] issued a landmark legal decision after the strike in [[Windsor, Ontario]], involving 17,000 [[Ford]] workers. He granted the union the compulsory check-off of union dues. Rand ruled that all workers in a bargaining unit benefit from a union-negotiated contract. Therefore, he reasoned they must pay union dues, although they do not have to join the union.

The post-[[World War II]] era also saw an increased pattern of unionization in the public service. Teachers, nurses, social workers, professors and cultural workers (those employed in museums, orchestras and art galleries) all sought private-sector collective bargaining rights. The [[Canadian Labour Congress]] was founded in 1956 as the [[national trade union center]] for Canada.

In the 1970s the federal government came under intense pressures to curtail labour cost and inflation. In 1975, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of [[Pierre Trudeau]] introduced mandatory price and wage controls. Under the new law, wages increases were monitored and those ruled to be unacceptably high were rolled back by the government.

Pressures on unions continued into the 1980s and '90s. Private sector unions faced plant closures in many manufacturing industries and demands to reduce wages and increase productivity. Public sector unions came under attack by federal and provincial governments as they attempted to reduce spending, reduce taxes and balance budgets. Legislation was introduced in many jurisdictions reversing union collective bargaining rights, and many jobs were lost to contractors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mapleleafweb.com/old/education/spotlight/issue_51/history.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727111519/http://www.mapleleafweb.com/old/education/spotlight/issue_51/history.html |archive-date=27 July 2013 }} Retrieved 14 July 2013.</ref>

===Mexico===
Before the 1990s, unions in Mexico had been historically part of a state institutional system. From 1940 until the 1980s, during the worldwide spread of [[neoliberalism]] through the [[Washington Consensus]], the Mexican unions did not operate independently, but instead as part of a state institutional system, largely controlled by the ruling party.<ref name="BotzJay01052010"/>

During these 40 years, the primary aim of the trade unions was not to benefit the workers, but to carry out the state's economic policy under their cosy relationship with the ruling party. This economic policy, which peaked in the 1950s and 60s with the so-called "[[Mexican Miracle]]", saw rising incomes and improved standards of living but the primary beneficiaries were the wealthy.<ref name="BotzJay01052010"/>

In the 1980s, Mexico began adhering to Washington Consensus policies, selling off state industries such as railroad and telecommunications to private industries. The new owners had an antagonistic attitude towards unions, which, accustomed to comfortable relationships with the state, were not prepared to fight back. A movement of new unions began to emerge under a more independent model, while the former institutionalized unions had become very corrupt, violent, and led by gangsters. From the 1990s onwards, this new model of independent unions prevailed, a number of them represented by the National Union of Workers / Unión Nacional de Trabajadores.<ref name="BotzJay01052010">[[Dan La Botz]] ''[http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=5059 U.S.-supported Economics Spurred Mexican Emigration, pt.1]'', interview at ''[[The Real News]]'', 1 May 2010.</ref>

Current old institutions like the Oil Workers Union and the [[National Education Workers' Union]] (''Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación'', or SNTE) are examples of how the use of government benefits are not being applied to improve the quality in the investigation of the use of oil or the basic education in Mexico as long as their leaders show publicly that they are living wealthily. With 1.4&nbsp;million members, the teachers' union is [[Latin America]]'s largest; half of Mexico's government employees are teachers. It controls school curriculums, and all teacher appointments. Until recently, retiring teachers routinely "gave" their lifelong appointment to a relative or "sell" it for anywhere in between $4,700 and $11,800.<ref name=wsj>{{cite news |title=Mexico Takes On Teachers Over School Control|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323777204578193882792320310?mod=googlenews_wsj|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=21 December 2012|author=Juan Montes|author2=José de Córdoba}}</ref>

===Nordic countries===
[[File:Striking workers organised in the Norwegian labour union UNIO.JPG|thumb|Workers on strike in Oslo, Norway, 2012]]
Trade unions (Danish: ''Fagforeninger'', Norwegian: ''Fagforeninger/Fagforeiningar'' Swedish: ''Fackföreningar'') have a long tradition in [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] society. Beginning in the mid-19th century, they today have a large impact on the nature of employment and workers' rights in many of the [[Nordic countries]]. One of the largest trade unions in [[Sweden]] is the [[Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions]], (LO, ''Landsorganisationen''), incorporating unions such as the Swedish Metal Workers' Union (''IF Metall'' = ''Industrifacket Metall''), the Swedish Electricians' Union (Svenska Elektrikerförbundet) and the Swedish Municipality Workers' Union (''Svenska Kommunalarbetareförbundet'', abbreviated ''Kommunal'').<ref>Anders Kjellberg (2020) [https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/publications/den-svenska-modellen-i-en-oviss-tid(11ad3d7f-b363-4e46-834f-cae7013939dc).html ''Den svenska modellen i en oviss tid.

During the [[Spanish civil war]] [[anarchists]], and [[syndicalists]] took control over much of Spain. Implementing worker control through a system of [[libertarian socialism]] with organizations like the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] organizing throughout Spain. Unions were particularly present in [[Revolutionary Catalonia]], in which anarchists were already the basis for most of society with over 90% of industries being organized through work cooperatives.<ref>https://mirror.anarhija.net/theanarchistlibrary.org/mirror/s/sd/sam-dolgoff-editor-the-anarchist-collectives.lt.pdf</ref> The republicans, anarchists and leftists would later loose control over Spain , with [[Francisco Franco]] becoming dictator of Spain.

During the fascist regime of Spain the Francoist regime saw the worker movement and union movement as a threat, Franco banned all existing trade unions and set up the government controlled [[Spanish Syndical Organization]] as the only legal Spanish trade union, with the organization existing to maintain Francos power.<ref>https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/cetra/papers/files/pegenaute-1999.pdf</ref>

Many anarchists, communists and leftist turned towards insurgent tactics as Franco implemented wide reaching authoritarian policies, with the CNT and other unions being forced underground. Anarchists would operate covertly setting up local organizations and underground movements to challenge Franco.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/43299690.pdf?casa_token=5ykwnnyXK24AAAAA:LbyN6GVhohfXFG7fTwQBdOjD9w2p2Pw4w9NuDZgZAEM5eyA5FXcLV8y06p-9l5ijU5wLVKk83V9qWePBXik0P74rBpZbGQnscJdLsvM_v1FM95haUEhcGA|jstor=43299690|title=Emotions, Moral Batteries and High-Risk Activism: Understanding the Emotional Practices of the Spanish Anarchists under Franco's Dictatorship|last1=Romanos|first1=Eduardo|journal=Contemporary European History|year=2014|volume=23|issue=4|pages=545–564|doi=10.1017/S0960777314000319}}</ref> On the 20 of December the [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] [[Assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco|assassinated Luis Carrero]]. The death of Carrero Blanco had numerous political implications. By the end of 1973, the physical health of Francisco Franco had declined significantly, and it epitomized the final crisis of the Francoist regime. After his death, the most conservative sector of the Francoist State, known as the búnker, wanted to influence Franco so that he would choose an ultraconservative as Prime Minister. Finally, he chose Carlos Arias Navarro, who originally announced a partial relaxation of the most rigid aspects of the Francoist State, but quickly retreated under pressure from the búnker. After Franco's death Arias Navarro began relaxing Spanish authoritarianism.

During the [[Spanish transition to democracy]], leftist organizations became legal once again. In modern Spain trade unions now contribute massively towards Spanish society, being again the main catalyst for political change in Spain, with cooperatives employing large parts of the Spanish population such as the [[Mondragon Corporation]]. Trade unions today lead mass protests against the Spanish government, and are one of the main vectors of political change.<ref>https://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/10096/3/Anarchist_Studies_Syndicalism.pdf</ref>

[[File:Leeds public sector pensions strike in November 2011 9.jpg|thumb|Public sector workers in [[Leeds]] striking over pension changes by the government in November 2011]]
Moderate [[New Model Union]]s dominated the union movement from the mid-19th century and where trade unionism was stronger than the political labour movement until the formation and growth of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the early years of the 20th century.

Trade unionism in the United Kingdom was a major factor in some of the economic crises during the 1960s and the 1970s, culminating in the "[[Winter of Discontent]]" of late 1978 and early 1979, when a significant percentage of the nation's public sector workers went on strike. By this stage, some 12,000,000 workers in the United Kingdom were trade union members. However, the election of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election]] in May 1979, at the expense of Labour's [[James Callaghan]], saw substantial trade union reform which saw the level of strikes fall. The level of trade union membership also fell sharply in the 1980s, and continued falling for most of the 1990s. The long decline of most of the industries in which manual trade unions were strong&nbsp;– e.g. steel, coal, printing, the docks&nbsp;– was one of the causes of this loss of trade union members.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3526917.stm|title=The trade unions' long decline|date=8 March 2004|access-date=16 January 2014|work=[[BBC News]]|first=Steve|last=Schifferes}}</ref>

In 2011 there were 6,135,126 members in TUC-affiliated unions, down from a peak of 12,172,508 in 1980.

===United States===
{{Main|Labor unions in the United States|Labor history of the United States}}

Labor unions are legally recognized as representatives of workers in many industries in the United States. In the United States, unions were formed based on power with the people, not over the people like the government at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kazin|first1=Michael|title=The Populist Persuasion|url=https://archive.org/details/populistpersuasi00kazirich|url-access=registration|date=1995|publisher=BasicBooks|page=[https://archive.org/details/populistpersuasi00kazirich/page/154 154]}}</ref> Their activity today centres on [[collective bargaining]] over wages, benefits and working conditions for their membership, and on representing their members in disputes with management over violations of contract provisions. Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and supporting endorsed candidates at the state and federal level.

Most unions in America are aligned with one of two larger umbrella organizations: the [[AFL-CIO]] created in 1955, and the [[Change to Win Federation]] which split from the AFL-CIO in 2005. Both advocate policies and legislation on behalf of workers in the United States and Canada, and take an active role in politics. The AFL-CIO is especially concerned with global trade issues.

The economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] has asserted that, "Strong unions have helped to reduce inequality, whereas weaker unions have made it easier for [[CEO]]s, sometimes working with market forces that they have helped shape, to increase it." The decline in unionization since the [[Second World War]] in the United States has been associated with a pronounced rise in [[income inequality in the United States|income]] and [[wealth inequality in the United States|wealth inequality]] and, since 1967, with loss of [[American middle class|middle class]] income.<ref>Doree Armstrong (12 February 2014).

==Structure and politics==
[[File:Cesar chavez2.jpg|thumb|[[Cesar Chavez]] speaking at a 1974 [[United Farm Workers]] rally in [[Delano, California]]. The UFW during Chavez's tenure was committed to restricting immigration.]]
Unions may organize a particular section of skilled workers ([[craft unionism]], traditionally found in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US<ref name="Poole, M. 1986"/>), a cross-section of workers from various trades ([[general union]]ism, traditionally found in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, the UK and the US), or attempt to organize all workers within a particular industry ([[industrial unionism]], found in Australia, Canada, Germany, Finland, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US). These unions are often divided into "[[Local union|locals]]", and united in national [[List of federations of trade unions|federations]]. These federations themselves will affiliate with [[International organization|International]]s, such as the [[International Trade Union Confederation]]. However, in Japan, union organization is slightly different due to the presence of enterprise unions, i.e. unions that are specific to a plant or company. These enterprise unions, however, join industry-wide federations which in turn are members of [[RENGO|Rengo]], the Japanese national trade union confederation.

In [[Western Europe]], professional associations often carry out the functions of a trade union. In these cases, they may be negotiating for white-collar or professional workers, such as physicians, engineers or teachers. Typically such trade unions refrain from politics or pursue a more liberal politics than their blue-collar counterparts.

A union may acquire the status of a "[[juristic person]]" (an artificial legal entity), with a mandate to negotiate with employers for the workers it represents. In such cases, unions have certain legal rights, most importantly the right to engage in [[collective bargaining]] with the employer (or employers) over wages, working hours, and other [[employment contract|terms and conditions of employment]]. The inability of the parties to reach an agreement may lead to [[industrial action]], culminating in either [[strike action]] or management [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]], or binding arbitration. In extreme cases, violent or illegal activities may develop around these events.

[[File:Great Railway Strike 1886 - E St Louis.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886]] was a trade union strike involving more than 200,000 workers<ref>"[http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2011/08/09/10-biggest-strikes-in-american-history/ The 10 Biggest Strikes in American History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223030/http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2011/08/09/10-biggest-strikes-in-american-history/ |date=2 December 2013 }}". Fox Business. 9 August 2011</ref>]]
In other circumstances, unions may not have the legal right to represent workers, or the right may be in question. This lack of status can range from non-recognition of a union to political or criminal prosecution of union activists and members, with many cases of violence and deaths having been recorded historically.<ref>[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr23/031/2005/en/ Amnesty International report 23 September 2005] – fear for safety of [[SINALTRAINAL]] member José Onofre Esquivel Luna</ref>

Unions may also engage in broader political or social struggle. [[Social Movement Unionism|Social Unionism]] encompasses many unions that use their organizational strength to advocate for social policies and legislation favourable to their members or to workers in general. As well, unions in some countries are closely aligned with [[political party|political parties]].

Unions are also delineated by the [[service model]] and the [[organizing model]]. The service model union focuses more on maintaining worker rights, providing services, and resolving disputes. Alternately, the organizing model typically involves full-time [[union organizer]]s, who work by building up confidence, strong networks, and leaders within the workforce; and confrontational campaigns involving large numbers of union members. Many unions are a blend of these two philosophies, and the definitions of the models themselves are still debated.

In Britain, the perceived left-leaning nature of trade unions has resulted in the formation of a reactionary right-wing trade union called [[Solidarity&nbsp;– The Union for British Workers|Solidarity]] which is supported by the far-right [[British National Party|BNP]]. In Denmark, there are some newer apolitical "discount" unions who offer a very basic level of services, as opposed to the dominating Danish pattern of extensive services and organizing.<ref>See the website of the Danish discount union "Det faglige Hus" at http://www.detfagligehus.dk/ (website in Danish)</ref>
[[File:Unison strike rally Oxford 20060328.jpg|thumb|right|A rally of the trade union [[UNISON]] in [[Oxford]] during a strike on 28 March 2006]]
In contrast, in several European countries (e.g. Belgium, Denmark, the [[Netherlands]] and [[Switzerland]]), religious unions have existed for decades. These unions typically distanced themselves from some of the doctrines of orthodox [[Marxism]], such as the preference of atheism and from rhetoric suggesting that employees' interests always are in conflict with those of employers. Some of these Christian unions have had some ties to centrist or conservative political movements and some do not regard strikes as acceptable political means for achieving employees' goals.<ref name="Poole, M. 1986"/> In [[Poland]], the biggest trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] emerged as an [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] movement with [[religious nationalism|religious nationalist]] overtones<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxist.com/revolt-polish-workers101001.htm|title=The economic and social processes that led to the revolt of the Polish workers in the early eighties|first=Professor Jacek Tittenbrun of Poznan University|last=Poland|website=www.marxist.com|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref> and today it supports the right-wing [[Law and Justice]] party.<ref>[http://news.money.pl/artykul/solidarnosc;popiera;kaczynskiego;jak;kiedys;walese,177,0,615857.html Solidarność popiera Kaczyńskiego jak kiedyś Wałęsę] at news.money.pl {{in lang|pl}}</ref>

Although their political structure and autonomy varies widely, union leaderships are usually formed through democratic [[election]]s.<ref>See E McGaughey, 'Democracy or Oligarchy? Models of Union Governance in the UK, Germany and US' (2017) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2995297 ssrn.com]</ref> Some research, such as that conducted by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acirrt.com/pubs/Trainingwagesupdate.pdf |title=Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training report |publisher=Acirrt.com |access-date=2011-07-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154704/http://www.acirrt.com/pubs/Trainingwagesupdate.pdf |archive-date=22 July 2011 }}</ref> argues that unionized workers enjoy better conditions and wages than those who are not unionized.

==Shop types==
Companies that employ workers with a union generally operate on one of several models:
* A [[closed shop]] (US) or a "pre-entry closed shop" (UK) employs only people who are already union members. The compulsory [[hiring hall]] is an example of a closed shop – in this case the employer must recruit directly from the union, as well as the employee working strictly for unionized employers.
* A [[union shop]] (US) or a "post-entry closed shop" (UK) employs non-union workers as well, but sets a time limit within which new employees must join a union.
* An [[agency shop]] requires non-union workers to pay a fee to the union for its services in negotiating their contract. This is sometimes called the [[Rand formula]]. In certain situations involving state public employees in the United States, such as [[California]], "fair share laws" make it easy to require these sorts of payments.
* An [[open shop]] does not require union membership in employing or keeping workers. Where a union is active, workers who do not contribute to a union may include those who approve of the union contract ([[free riders]]) and those who do not. In the United States, state level [[right-to-work law]]s mandate the open shop in some states. In Germany only open shops are legal; that is, all discrimination based on union membership is forbidden. This affects the function and services of the union.

An EU case concerning Italy stated that, "The principle of trade union freedom in the Italian system implies recognition of the right of the individual not to belong to any trade union ("negative" freedom of association/trade union freedom), and the unlawfulness of discrimination liable to cause harm to non-unionized employees."<ref>Eurofound website "FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION/TRADE UNION FREEDOM", {{cite web |url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/ITALY/FREEDOMOFASSOCIATIONTRADEUNIONFREEDOM-IT.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417233015/http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/ITALY/FREEDOMOFASSOCIATIONTRADEUNIONFREEDOM-IT.htm |archive-date=17 April 2011 }}</ref>

In Britain, previous to this EU jurisprudence, a series of laws introduced during the 1980s by Margaret Thatcher's government restricted closed and union shops. All agreements requiring a worker to join a union are now illegal. In the United States, the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1947 outlawed the closed shop.

In 2006, the European Court of Human Rights found Danish closed-shop agreements to be in breach of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It was stressed that Denmark and [[Iceland]] were among a limited number of contracting states that continue to permit the conclusion of closed-shop agreements.<ref>Eurofound, http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2006/01/feature/dk0601104f.htm</ref>

==Diversity of international unions==
Union law varies from country to country, as does the function of unions. For example, German and Dutch unions have played a greater role in management decisions through participation in corporate boards and [[co-determination]] than have unions in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bamberg|first=Ulrich|url=http://hesa.etui-rehs.org/uk/newsletter/files/BTS012EN_12-15.pdf|title=The role of German trade unions in the national and European standardisation process|journal=TUTB Newsletter|date=June 2004|volume=24–25|access-date=27 July 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726035804/http://hesa.etui-rehs.org/uk/newsletter/files/BTS012EN_12-15.pdf|archive-date=26 July 2011}}</ref> Moreover, in the United States, collective bargaining is most commonly undertaken by unions directly with employers, whereas in Austria, Denmark, Germany or Sweden, unions most often negotiate with employers associations.

Concerning labour market regulation in the EU, Gold (1993)<ref>Gold, M., 1993. ''The Social Dimension – Employment Policy in the European Community''. Basingstroke England UK: Macmillan Publishing</ref> and Hall (1994)<ref>Hall, M., 1994. ''Industrial Relations and the Social Dimension of European Integration: Before and after Maastricht'', pp. 281–331 in Hyman, R. & Ferner A., eds.: ''New Frontiers in European Industrial Relations'', Basil Blackwell Publishing</ref> have identified three distinct systems of labour market regulation, which also influence the role that unions play:
* "In the Continental European System of labour market regulation, the government plays an important role as there is a strong legislative core of employee rights, which provides the basis for agreements as well as a framework for discord between unions on one side and employers or employers' associations on the other. This model was said to be found in EU core countries such as Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, and it is also mirrored and emulated to some extent in the institutions of the EU, due to the relative weight that these countries had in the EU until the EU expansion by the inclusion of 10 new [[Eastern Europe]]an member states in 2004.
* In the Anglo-Saxon System of labour market regulation, the government's legislative role is much more limited, which allows for more issues to be decided between employers and employees and any union or employers' associations which might represent these parties in the decision-making process. However, in these countries, collective agreements are not widespread; only a few businesses and a few sectors of the economy have a strong tradition of finding collective solutions in labour relations. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the UK belong to this category, and in contrast to the EU core countries above, these countries first joined the EU in 1973.
* In the Nordic System of labour market regulation, the government's legislative role is limited in the same way as in the Anglo-Saxon system. However, in contrast to the countries in the Anglo-Saxon system category, this is a much more widespread network of collective agreements, which covers most industries and most firms. This model was said to encompass Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Here, Denmark joined the EU in 1973, whereas Finland and Sweden joined in 1995."<ref>Wagtmann, M.A. (2010): Module 3, Maritime & Port Wages, Benefits, Labour Relations. International Maritime Human Resource Management textbook modules. Available at: https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=f90c069a3e6bb729&id=F90C069A3E6BB729%21107#cid=F90C069A3E6BB729&id=F90C069A3E6BB729%21182</ref>

The United States takes a more [[laissez-faire]] approach, setting some minimum standards but leaving most workers' wages and benefits to collective bargaining and market forces. Thus, it comes closest to the above Anglo-Saxon model. Also, the Eastern European countries that have recently entered into the EU come closest to the Anglo-Saxon model.

In contrast, in Germany, the relation between individual employees and employers is considered to be asymmetrical. In consequence, many working conditions are not negotiable due to a strong legal protection of individuals. However, the German flavor or works legislation has as its main objective to create a balance of power between employees organized in unions and employers organized in employers associations. This allows much wider legal boundaries for collective bargaining, compared to the narrow boundaries for individual negotiations. As a condition to obtain the legal status of a trade union, employee associations need to prove that their leverage is strong enough to serve as a counterforce in negotiations with employers. If such an employees association is competing against another union, its leverage may be questioned by unions and then evaluated in a court trial. In Germany, only very few professional associations obtained the right to negotiate salaries and working conditions for their members, notably the medical doctors association Marburger Bund and the pilots association Vereinigung Cockpit. The engineers association [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure]] does not strive to act as a union, as it also represents the interests of engineering businesses.

Beyond the classification listed above, unions' relations with political parties vary. In many countries unions are tightly bonded, or even share leadership, with a political party intended to represent the interests of the working class. Typically this is a [[left-wing]], [[socialist]], or [[social democrat]]ic party, but many exceptions exist, including some of the aforementioned Christian unions.<ref name="Poole, M. 1986" /> In the United States, trade unions are almost always aligned with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] with a few exceptions. For example, the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] has supported [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidates on a number of occasions and the [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)|Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization]] (PATCO) endorsed [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980. In Britain trade union movement's relationship with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] frayed as party leadership embarked on [[privatization]] plans at odds with what unions see as the worker's interests. However, it has strengthened once more after the Labour party's election of [[Ed Miliband]], who beat his brother [[David Miliband]] to become leader of the party after Ed secured the trade union votes. Additionally, in the past, there was a group known as the [[Conservative Trade Unionists]], or CTU, formed of people who sympathized with right wing Tory policy but were Trade Unionists.

Historically, the [[Republic of Korea]] has regulated collective bargaining by requiring employers to participate, but collective bargaining has only been legal if held in sessions before the [[Korean New Year|lunar new year]].

==International unionization==
The largest trade union federation in the world is the [[Brussels]]-based [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC), which has approximately 309 affiliated organizations in 156 countries and territories, with a combined membership of 166&nbsp;million. The ITUC is a federation of national trade union centres, such as the AFL-CIO in the United States and the Trades Union Congress in the United Kingdom. Other global trade union organizations include the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]].

National and regional trade unions organizing in specific industry sectors or occupational groups also form [[global union federation]]s, such as [[Union Network International]], the [[International Transport Workers Federation]], the [[International Federation of Journalists]], the International Arts and Entertainment Alliance or [[Public Services International]].

==Criticism==
{{main|Opposition to trade unions}}
In the United States, the outsourcing of labour to Asia, Latin America, and Africa has been partially driven by increasing costs of union partnership, which gives other countries a [[comparative advantage]] in labour, making it more profitable to purchase disorganized, low-wage labour from these regions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kramarz |first=Francis |title=Outsourcing, Unions, and Wages: Evidence from data matching imports, firms, and workers |date=19 October 2006|url=http://www.eco.uc3m.es/temp/agenda/wage102006.pdf |access-date=2007-01-22 }}</ref> [[Milton Friedman]], [[economist]] and advocate of [[laissez-faire capitalism]], sought to show that unionization produces higher wages (for the union members) at the expense of fewer jobs, and that, if some industries are unionized while others are not, wages will tend to decline in non-unionized industries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Friedman|first=Milton|title=Price theory|year=2007|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=978-0-202-30969-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhcI5-D9wREC&pg=PA164|edition=[New ed.], 3rd printing}}</ref>

On the other hand, several studies have emphasized so-called revitalization strategies where trade unions attempt to better represent labour market outsiders, such as the unemployed and precarious workers. Thus, for instance, trade unions in both Nordic and southern European countries have devised collective bargaining agreements that improved the conditions of temporary agency workers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Union inclusiveness and temporary agency workers|issue=1|pages=5–22|last1=Vlandas|first1=Timothee|last2=Benassi|first2=Chiara|journal=European Journal of Industrial Relations|volume=22|year=2016|doi=10.1177/0959680115589485|s2cid=154836257|url=http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/40126/3/BenassiVlandas-prepublished%20version.pdf}}</ref>

Several studies have found evidence that trade unions can reduce competitiveness due to a reduction of business profit, which can then lead to job losses as it makes the business unable to compete. Unions have also been criticized by conservative economists and political groups for prolonging recessions and depressions due to discouraging investment.<ref>Sherk, James [https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/what-unions-do-how-labor-unions-affect-jobs-and-the-economy#_ftn9 "What Unions Do: How Labor Unions Affect Jobs and the Economy"], ''The Heritage Foundation'', 21/05/19, accessed 01/03/19</ref>

==Union publications==
Several sources of current news exist about the trade union movement in the world. These include [[LabourStart]] and the official website of the international trade union movement [[Global Unions]]. A source of international news about unions is RadioLabour which provides daily (Monday to Friday) news reports.

''[[Labor Notes]]'' is the largest circulation cross-union publication remaining in the United States. It reports news and analysis about union activity or problems facing the labour movement. Another source of union news is the ''Workers Independent News'', a news organization providing radio articles to independent and syndicated radio shows in the United States.
