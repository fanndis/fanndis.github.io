The '''Catholic Church in Brazil''' is part of the worldwide [[Catholic Church]], under the spiritual leadership of the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]], and the influential [[National Conference of Bishops of Brazil]] ({{lang-pt|Conferência Nacional dos Bispos do Brasil - CNBB}}), composed of over 400 primary and auxiliary bishops and [[archbishop]]s. There are over 250 [[diocese]]s (both of the Latin and Eastern rites) and other territorial jurisdictions in Brazil. The [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of Brazil is [[Murilo Ramos Krieger|Dom Murilo Ramos Krieger]].

The Catholic Church is the largest denomination in the country, where 123 million people,<ref>GORTÁZAR, NAIARA GALARRAGA. “[https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/02/19/actualidad/1550616736_505701.htmlCom Maior Número Católicos No Mundo, Brasil Será Projeto-Piloto Para Dar Voz a Vítimas De Abusos Na Igreja.]” [[El País]]</ref> or 64.6% of the Brazilian population, are self-declared Catholics.<ref name="repo">[ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Censos/Censo_Demografico_2010/Caracteristicas_Gerais_Religiao_Deficiencia/tab1_4.pdf].

{{main|History of the Catholic Church in Brazil}}

According to the tradition, the first [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] celebrated in Brazil took place on 26 April 1500.<ref>[https://www.infoescola.com/historia/primeira-missa-no-brasil/ Primeira Missa no Brasil]</ref> It was celebrated by a priest who arrived in the country along with the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers to claim possession of the newfound land. The first diocese in Brazil was erected more than 50 years later, in 1551.

Brazil's strong Catholic heritage can be traced to the Iberian missionary zeal, with the 15th-century goal of spreading Christianity. The Church missions began to hamper the government policy of exploiting the natives. In 1782 the [[Jesuits]] were suppressed, and the government tightened its control over the Church.

Catholicism was the predominant faith during colonial rule, then in 1824 became the [[state religion|official religion]] of an [[Empire of Brazil|independent Brazil]] which also guaranteed [[freedom of religion]] for its citizens. The Brazilian government has been secular since the Constitution of 1891 and the Church has remained politically influential.<ref name="georgetown1">{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/brazil|title=Brazil|publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825203019/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/brazil|archive-date=25 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the late 19th century, the Catholic population of Iberian origin was reinforced by a large number of [[Italy|Italian]] Catholics who immigrated to Brazil, as well as some [[Poland|Polish]] and [[Germany|German]] Catholic immigrants. In 1889 Brazil became a republic and approved a constitution [[Separation of church and state|separating the Church from the State]], a trend followed by all of the country's seven republican constitutions.<ref name="stud" /> Prior to that, during the [[Empire of Brazil]], Catholicism was the official religion of the country.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/312837/Roman-Catholicism-as-discussed-in-Brazil “Facts about Roman Catholicism: Brazil”]. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].</ref> In practice, separation of Church and state in the country is weak as government officials generally avoid taking actions that may offend the Church which represents a large majority of citizens.<ref name="stud" />

A recent example of the Church's influence over political questions was the change conducted by the federal government in the Third National Program of Human Rights in regard to its proposal to legalize [[abortion]], after pressure from the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops.<ref name="ig">[[Agência Brasil]]. [http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/politica/para+cnbb+mudancas+no+pndh+3+revelam+sensibilidade/n1237618752778.html “Para CNBB, mudanças no PNDH 3 revelam sensibilidade”]. ''iG Último Segundo''. 13 May 2010.</ref> That particular change, along with others, was denounced by the [[Amnesty International]].<ref>pndh3.com.br. [http://www.vermelho.org.br/noticia.php?id_secao=1&id_noticia=130415 “Anistia Internacional expõe preocupação com mudança no PNDH-3”]. [[Communist Party of Brazil]]. 29 May 2010.</ref> Nevertheless, the government kept issues contrary to Church teaching in the Program, such as its support for [[same-sex marriage]] and [[same-sex adoption]].<ref name="ig" />

In the late 20th century the Church's [[liberation theology]] movement, which focuses on the poor as the primary recipients of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s message, helped in the quest for social justice.<ref name="OD">Almeida, Rodrigo. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150925232429/https://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-catholicchurch/benedict_brazil_4601.jsp “Benedict XVI in Brazil: raising the Catholic flag”]. Open Democracy. 8 May 2007.</ref> The church organized [[basic ecclesial community|ecclesiastical base communities]] throughout the country to work for social and political causes at the local level.<ref name="stud" /> Despite the support of the higher clergy for the military, the progressive wing managed to make the Church practically the only legitimate focus of resistance and defense of basic [[human rights]] during [[Brazilian military government|military rule]],<ref name="stud" /> as well as a main advocate<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brigagão Ferrer Alves Carvalho|first=Natalia|title=Catholic Social Thought, Politics and Human Dignity in the Brazilian Constitutional Assembly of 1987-1988|journal=American Journal of Legal History|volume=59|pages=111–140|language=en|doi=10.1093/ajlh/njy029|year=2019}}</ref> for social rights and human dignity in the Constitutional Assembly of 1987-1988. When then [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Ratzinger]] became responsible for the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], he launched a successful campaign against the liberation theology,<ref name="OD" /> and the conservative wing of the Church gained power. Catholics then saw the rise of the [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal]] movement, as a way to counter the rapid growth of [[Pentecostal]] [[Protestantism]] in the country.<ref name="stud" /> According to Luis Lugo, director of the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life]], “pentecostalism no longer is something confined outside the Catholic Church, it is now firmly within the form of various charismatic tendencies and movements”.<ref name="OD" />

During his five-day visit to Brazil on May 2007 Pope Benedict XVI canonized [[Frei Galvão]], who became the first Brazilian-born saint. Both the Pope's visit and the canonisation aimed at reinvigorating the local church.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6645555.stm “Pope names Brazil's first saint”]. BBC. 11 May 2007.</ref> Brazil was also the first foreign country visited by Benedict's successor [[Pope Francis]].<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21581991-promise-and-peril-papal-visit-earthly-concerns Religion in Brazil: Earthly concerns] The Economist Newspaper Limited 2018.</ref>

==Demographics==
[[File:Brazil map Catholics.PNG|thumb|315px|Proportion of Catholics by state.]]

According to a 2007 poll conducted by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Research Center's]] Forum on Religion & Public Life, more than 60% of the urban population of Brazil claims a Catholic affiliation.<ref name="OD" /> Religious [[syncretism]] is widespread among Brazilian Catholics. There is an overlay of [[Afro-Brazilian religions]] (like [[Candomblé]], [[Quimbanda]] and [[Umbanda]]) with Catholic beliefs and practices, which many Catholic Brazilians do not find inconsistent with their faith.<ref name="CoSt">Country Studies [http://countrystudies.us/brazil/43.htm "Brazil - Other Religions"]. source: Rex A. Hudson, ed. ''Brazil: A Country Study''. Washington: [[U.S. Library of Congress|GPO for the Library of Congress]], 1997.</ref> An example is the Feast of Bonfim, a ritual in which [[mãe-de-santo|mães-de-santo]] gather to wash the stairs of the [[Church of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim, Salvador|Church of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim]] in [[Salvador, Bahia]]. Catholics are far more likely to believe in good luck charms, fortune-tellers, faith-healers and [[astrology]] than are converts to Protestantism.<ref name="Amer"/>

Religious change in Brazil is frequent.<ref name="Amer" /> According to polling institute [[Datafolha]], as of July 2013, approximately 57% of those aged over 16 years old were Catholic, while evangelicals constituted 28%.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4dec6b0a-f3b9-11e2-b25a-00144feabdc0.html#slide8 ''March of Brazil’s evangelicals tests pontiff''] Financial Times</ref>

According to [[America (Jesuit magazine)|''America Magazine'']] in 2003, Brazilian Catholics have the highest score in the world on the image of God as loving and as mother. They are also more likely to see [[human nature]] as good rather than corrupt, and the world as good rather than evil. Brazilian Catholics are less likely to believe in the literal, word-for-word interpretation of the [[Bible]] than Protestants.<ref name="Amer" /> They are also more likely to accept [[premarital sex]], cohabitation before marriage, [[homosexuality]] and [[abortion]].<ref name="Amer" /> About 40% attend Masses at least once a month—approximately the same level as that of American Catholics. Almost 75% pray every day, but only 12% engage in Church activities; only 26% say they are "very religious".<ref name="Amer" /> More than one out of five of those who were raised Catholics leave the church, most of them taking on [[Irreligion|no religious affiliation]] or [[Protestantism]]. However, Catholicism has the highest rate of retention. More than two-fifths of those who were raised Protestant are no longer Protestant; the Catholic Church picks up 16% of those who were raised Protestants.<ref name="Amer" />

By race, 66.4% of whites are Catholic, along with 58.2% of blacks, 59.9% of East Asians, 64.1% of browns, and 50.7% of American Indians.<ref>ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Censos/Censo_Demografico_2010/Caracteristicas_Gerais_Religiao_Deficiencia/tab1_4.pdf, page 6</ref>

==Education==
As the largest Catholic country in the world, Catholic education has a great tradition in Brazil. The [[Society of Jesus]] founded the first schools in the country, with the aim of evangelizing Native-Brazilians. In the late 18th century, Portuguese minister [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]] attacked and expelled the Jesuits from Portugal and its overseas possessions. He seized the Jesuit schools and introduced educational reforms all over the [[Portuguese Empire|Empire]]. Since then, public schools have been secular, but private Catholic schools are among the best in the country.

According to the [[Ministry of Education (Brazil)|Ministry of Education]], there are more than 30 Catholic universities in Brazil.<ref>[http://emec.mec.gov.br/ Higher education institutes registered at the Ministry of Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511050432/http://emec.mec.gov.br/|date=11 May 2015}}</ref> The first was the [[Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul|Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul]], founded by [[Marist Brothers]] on 1931.
