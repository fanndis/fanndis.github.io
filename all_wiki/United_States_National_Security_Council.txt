The [[White House]] '''National Security Council''' ('''NSC''') is the principal forum used by the [[President of the United States]] for consideration of [[national security]], military, and [[Foreign relations of the United States|foreign policy]] matters with senior national security advisors and [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] officials and is part of the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]]. Since its inception under [[Harry S. Truman]], the function of the Council has been to advise and assist the President on national security and foreign policies. The Council also serves as the President's principal arm for coordinating these policies among various government agencies. The Council has counterparts in the [[national security councils]] of many other nations.

==History==
{{main|History of the United States National Security Council}}

The immediate predecessor to the National Security Council was the [[National Intelligence Authority (United States)|National Intelligence Authority]] (NIA), which was established by President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s Executive Letter of January 22, 1946, to oversee the Central Intelligence Group, the CIA's predecessor. The NIA was composed of the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief]].

The National Security Council was created in 1947 by the [[National Security Act of 1947|National Security Act]]. It was created because policymakers felt that the diplomacy of the State Department was no longer adequate to contain the [[Soviet Union]], in light of the tension between the Soviet Union and the United States.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QHDkqb-myscC&pg=PA499 Encyclopedia of American foreign policy], 2nd ed. Vol. 2, New York: Scribner, 2002, National Security Council, 22 April 2009</ref> The intent was to ensure coordination and concurrence among the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and other instruments of national security policy such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), also created in the National Security Act. In 2004, the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was created, taking over the responsibilities previously held by the head of CIA, the Director of Central Intelligence, as a cabinet-level position to oversee and coordinate activities of the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]].<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/directors-of-central-intelligence-as-leaders-of-the-u-s-intelligence-community/chapter_15.htm Directors of Central Intelligence as Leaders of the US Intelligence Community], Douglas F. Garthoff, 2007, cia.gov</ref>

On May 26, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] merged the White House staff supporting the [[Homeland Security Council]] (HSC) and the National Security Council into one National Security Staff (NSS). The HSC and NSC each continue to exist by statute as bodies supporting the President.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/27/us/27homeland.html?ref=us |title=In Security Shuffle, White House Merges Staffs |author= Helene Cooper |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= May 26, 2009 |access-date= March 15, 2017 |author-link=Helene Cooper }}</ref> The name of the staff organization was changed back to National Security Council Staff in 2014.<ref>{{Cite press release|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/02/10/nsc-staff-name-back-so-long-nss|title=NSC Staff, the Name Is Back!

On January 29, 2017, President [[Donald Trump]] restructured the Principals Committee (a subset of the full National Security Council), while at the same time altering the attendance of the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and [[Director of National Intelligence]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/01/29/512295108/with-national-security-council-shakeup-steve-bannon-gets-a-seat-at-the-table|author= Merrit Kennedy| title=With National Security Council Shakeup, Steve Bannon Gets A Seat At The Table| date=January 29, 2017 |publisher=[[NPR]]| access-date= January 29, 2017 }}</ref>

==Authority and powers==
The National Security Council was established by the [[National Security Act of 1947]] (PL 235 – 61 Stat. 496; U.S.C. 402), amended by the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 579; 50 U.S.C. 401 et seq.). Later in 1949, as part of the Reorganization Plan, the Council was placed in the Executive Office of the President.

The [[High-Value Interrogation Group|High Value Detainee Interrogation Group]] also reports to the NSC.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/05/12/elite-high-value-interrogation-unit-taking-painful-steps/ |title= Elite High Value Interrogation Unit Is Taking Its First Painful Steps| author=Ed Barnes| publisher= [[Fox News Channel]]|date= May 12, 2010|access-date= March 15, 2017 }}</ref>

===Kill authorizations===
{{main|Disposition Matrix}}
A secret National Security Council panel pursues the killing of an individual, including American citizens, who has been called a suspected terrorist.<ref name=reu1005>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/05/us-cia-killlist-idUSTRE79475C20111005 | work=[[Reuters]] | title=Secret panel can put Americans on "kill list" |author=Mark Hosenball |date=October 5, 2011 |access-date= March 26, 2017| author-link=Mark Hosenball }}</ref> In this case, no public record of this decision or any operation to kill the suspect will be made available.<ref name=reu1005 /> The panel's actions are justified by "two principal legal theories": They "were permitted by Congress when it [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|authorized the use of military forces against militants]] in the wake of [[9/11|the attacks of September 11, 2001]]; and they are permitted under international law if a country is defending itself."<ref name=reu1005 />

Homeland Security Advisor [[John O. Brennan]], who has helped codify targeted killing criteria by creating the [[Disposition Matrix]] database, has described the [[Obama Administration]] targeted killing policy by stating that "in order to ensure that our counterterrorism operations involving the use of lethal force are legal, ethical, and wise, President Obama has demanded that we hold ourselves to the highest possible standards and processes".<ref>{{cite speech |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/the-efficacy-and-ethics-us-counterterrorism-strategy |title=The Efficacy and Ethics of U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy |author= [[John O.

Reuters has reported that [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], an American citizen, was on such a kill list and was killed accordingly.<ref name="reu1005"/>

On February 4, 2013, NBC published a leaked Department of Justice [[020413 DOJ White Paper|memo]] providing a summary of the rationale used to justify targeted killing of US citizens who are senior operational leaders of Al-Qa'ida or associated forces.<ref>{{cite report |url= http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/020413_DOJ_White_Paper.pdf |title= Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen Who Is a Senior Operational Leader of Al-Qa'ida or An Associated Force |publisher= [[United States Department of Justice]] |access-date= 2013-02-05 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140826075931/http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/020413_DOJ_White_Paper.pdf |archive-date= 2014-08-26 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

===Directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense===
The Directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense, created by Barack Obama in 2016 in response to the [[Ebola virus disease#2013–2016 West Africa|2014 Ebola outbreak]], was responsible "to prepare for the next disease outbreak and prevent it from becoming an epidemic or pandemic."<ref name="msnbc-trump-struggles-explain">{{cite news |last1=Benen |first1=Steve |title=Trump struggles to explain why he disbanded his global health team |url=https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-struggles-explain-why-he-disbanded-his-global-health-team-n1153221 |access-date=14 March 2020 |work=MSNBC |date=9 March 2020}}</ref><ref name="nsc-pandemic-office-trump-closed">Cameron, Beth, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/nsc-pandemic-office-trump-closed/2020/03/13/a70de09c-6491-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html "I ran the White House pandemic office.

The responsibilities that formerly belonged to the directorate, along with those of arms control and nonproliferation, and of weapons of mass destruction terrorism, were absorbed into a single new directorate, counterproliferation and biodefense, and assigned to [[Tim Morrison (presidential advisor)|Tim Morrison]] in July 2018 as director. Morrison characterized the consolidation as part of an overall NSC "reduction of force" and called it "specious" to say the office was "dissolved," describing the previous size of the organization as "bloat," and stating "That is why Trump began streamlining the NSC staff in 2017."<ref>[[Tim Morrison (presidential advisor)|Morrison, Tim]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/16/no-white-house-didnt-dissolve-its-pandemic-response-office/ "No, the White House didn't 'dissolve' its pandemic response office.

No source of information could be found to support the president's statement, likely because the team was created in 2016 and disbanded in 2018. He continued: "And rather than spending the money — and I'm a business person — I don't like having thousands of people around when you don't need them."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brady |first1=James |title=Remarks by President Trump, Vice President Pence, and Members of the Coronavirus Task Force in Press Conference |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-conference/ |website=White House, Press Briefings |access-date=17 March 2020 |date=2 February 2020}}</ref> The size of the team before cuts was estimated at 430 people, but the "thousands" referenced by the president also included reduction in the staff numbers of the CDC.<ref name="was-white-house-office-global-pandemics-eliminated" />

The term "Pandemic Response Team" is a popularized, unofficial term for the former directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense. The term was popularized by a series of tweets from Popular Information author [[Judd Legum]], claiming that "Trump fired the entire Pandemic Response Team two years ago and didn't replace them" and urging the rumor to spread by claiming "more people should be talking about" it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Palma |first1=Bethania |title=Did Trump Administration Fire the US Pandemic Response Team? |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-fire-pandemic-team/ |website=Snopes |access-date=14 March 2020 |date=26 Feb 2020}}</ref>
