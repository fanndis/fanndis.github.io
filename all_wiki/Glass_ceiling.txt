A '''glass ceiling''' is a metaphor used to represent an invisible barrier that prevents a given demographic (typically applied to minorities) from rising beyond a certain level in a hierarchy.<ref name="DOL2">Federal Glass Ceiling Commission.

Within the same concepts of the other terms surrounding the workplace, there are similar terms for restrictions and barriers concerning women and their roles within organizations and how they coincide with their maternal duties. These "Invisible Barriers" function as metaphors to describe the extra circumstances that women undergo, usually when trying to advance within areas of their careers and often while trying to advance within their lives outside their work spaces.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Paul|last2=Caputi|first2=Peter|year=2012|title=A Maze of Metaphors|url=https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4091&context=hbspapers|journal=Faculty of Health and Behavioral Sciences|volume=27|pages=436–448|via=University of Wollongong Research Online|doi=10.1108/17542411211273432}}</ref>

"A glass ceiling" represents a barrier that prohibits women from advancing toward the top of a hierarchical corporation. Those women are prevented from receiving promotion, especially to the executive rankings, within their corporation. In the last twenty years, the women who have become more involved and pertinent in industries and organizations have rarely been in the executive ranks. Women in most corporations encompass below five percent of board of directors and corporate officer positions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bass|first1=Bernard M.|last2=Avolio|first2=Bruce J.|date=24/1994|title=Shatter the glass ceiling: Women may make better managers|journal=Human Resource Management|volume=33|issue=4|pages=549–560|doi=10.1002/hrm.3930330405}}</ref>

== Definition ==
The United States Federal Glass Ceiling Commission defines the glass ceiling as "the unseen, yet unbreachable barrier that keeps minorities and women from rising to the upper rungs of the corporate ladder, regardless of their qualifications or achievements."<ref name="DOL2" />

David Cotter and colleagues defined four distinctive characteristics that must be met to conclude that a ''glass ceiling'' exists. A glass ceiling inequality represents:
# "A gender or racial difference that is not explained by other job-relevant characteristics of the employee."
# "A gender or racial difference that is greater at higher levels of an outcome than at lower levels of an outcome."
# "A gender or racial inequality in the chances of advancement into higher levels, not merely the proportions of each gender or race currently at those higher levels."
# "A gender or racial inequality that increases over the course of a career."
Cotter and colleagues found that glass ceilings are correlated strongly with gender, with both white and minority women facing a glass ceiling in the course of their careers. In contrast, the researchers did not find evidence of a glass ceiling for African-American men.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cotter | first1 = David A. | last2 = Hermsen | first2 = Joan M. | last3 = Ovadia | first3 = Seth | last4 = Vanneman | first4 = Reece | year = 2001 | title = The glass ceiling effect | url = http://www.bsos.umd.edu/socy/vanneman/papers/CotterHOV01.pdf | journal = Social Forces | volume = 80 | issue = 2| pages = 655–81 | doi=10.1353/sof.2001.0091}}</ref>

== History ==
In 1839, French feminist and author [[George Sand]] used a similar phrase, ''une voûte de cristal impénétrable'', in a passage of ''Gabriel'', a never-performed play: "I was a woman; for suddenly my wings collapsed, ether closed in around my head like ''an impenetrable crystal vault'', and I fell...." [emphasis added]. The statement, a description of the heroine's dream of soaring with wings, has been interpreted as a feminine [[Icarus]] tale of a woman who attempts to ascend above her accepted role.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harlan|first=Elizabeth|title=George Sand|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-13056-0|page=256}}</ref>

The first person said to use the term ''Glass ceiling'' was [[Marilyn Loden]] during a 1978 speech.<ref>{{cite book |title=Summary: Full Frontal PR: Review and Analysis of Laermer and Prichinello's Book |page=6 |author=BusinessNews Publishing |publisher=Primento |date=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRO0uZLlAosC&pg=PT6|isbn=9782806243027 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ecatalognow.com/article/Marilyn+Loden+On+Feminine+Leadership/766271/73810/article.html |publisher=Pelican Bay Post |title=Marilyn Loden On Feminine Leadership |date=May 2011}}</ref><ref name="Glass ceiling originator">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-42026266 |title=100 Women: 'Why I invented the glass ceiling phrase' |date=2017-12-12 |website=BBC News |access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref> At the same time, according to the April 3, 2015, Wall Street Journal, completely independent of Loden, the term glass ceiling was coined in the spring of 1978 by Marianne Schriber and Katherine Lawrence at Hewlett-Packard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-phrase-glass-ceiling-stretches-back-decades-1428089010|title=The Phrase 'Glass Ceiling' Stretches Back Decades|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> The ceiling was defined as discriminatory promotion patterns where the written promotional policy is non-discriminatory, but in practice denies promotion to qualified females. Lawrence presented this at the annual Conference of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press at meeting the National Press.

The term was later used in March 1984 by [[Gay Bryant]]. She was the former editor of ''Working Woman'' magazine and was changing jobs to be the editor of ''[[Family Circle]].'' In an ''[[Adweek]]'' article written by Nora Frenkel, Bryant was reported as saying, "Women have reached a certain point—I call it the glass ceiling. They're in the top of middle management and they're stopping and getting stuck. There isn't enough room for all those women at the top. Some are going into business for themselves. Others are going out and raising families."<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Up-and-Comers; Bryant Takes Aim At the Settlers-In |last=Frenkiel |first=Nora |journal=Adweek |volume=Special Report |date=March 1984 |publisher=Magazine World}}</ref><ref name=Cornell>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/library/research/questionofthemonth/jan05.html |title=Question of the Month: Where did the term 'glass ceiling' originate? |date=January 2005 |author=Catherwood Library reference librarians |publisher=Cornell University, ILR School |accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Success>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y71-YCYv-48C&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9 |pages=9–10 |title=Women in Media Careers: Success Despite the Odds |first1=Lee |last1=Bollinger |first2=Carole |last2=O'Neill |publisher=University Press of America |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7618-4133-3}}</ref> Also in 1984, Bryant used the term in a chapter of the book ''The Working Woman Report: Succeeding in Business in the 1980s.'' In the same book, Basia Hellwig used the term in another chapter.<ref name=Cornell />

In a widely cited article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in March 1986 the term was used in the
article's title: "The Glass Ceiling: Why Women Can't Seem to Break The Invisible Barrier That Blocks Them From the Top Jobs". The article was written by Carol Hymowitz and Timothy D. Schellhardt. Hymowitz and Schellhardt introduced glass ceiling was "not something that could be found in any corporate manual or even discussed at a business meeting; it was originally introduced as an invisible, covert, and unspoken phenomenon that existed to keep executive level leadership positions in the hands of Caucasian males."<ref name=":3" />

As the term "Glass Ceiling" became more common, the public responded with differing ideas and opinions. Some argued that the concept is a myth because women choose to stay home and showed less dedication to advance into executive positions.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Eleanor|date=September 4, 2014|title=Diversity, Culture and the Glass Ceiling|journal=Journal of Cultural Diversity|volume=21|issue=3|pages=83–9|doi=|pmid=25306838}}</ref> As a result of continuing public debate, the [[United States Department of Labor|US Labor Department]]'s chief, [[Lynn Morley Martin]], reported the results of a research project called "The Glass Ceiling Initiative", formed to investigate the low numbers of women and minorities in executive positions.

== Gender pay gap ==
{{main|Gender pay gap}}

The gender pay gap is the difference between male and female earnings. In 2008, the [[OECD]] suggested that the median earnings of female full-time workers were 17% lower than the earnings of their male counterparts and that "30% of the variation in gender wage gaps across OECD countries can be explained by discriminatory practices in the [[Labour economics|labour market]]."<ref>[[OECD]].

Gary S. Becker's theory of "tastes of discrimination" indicates that there are some personal prejudices which concern cooperation with a certain group of people.<ref>Becker, G. S. (1971): The Economics of Discrimination. Chicago/London: Univ. of Chicago Press.</ref>

== Glass Ceiling Index ==
In 2017, the ''Economist'' updated their glass-ceiling index, combining data on higher education, labour-force participation, pay, child-care costs, maternity and paternity rights, business-school applications and representation in senior jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/03/daily-chart-0|title=Daily chart: The best and worst places to be a working woman|newspaper=[[The Economist]]}}</ref> The countries where inequality was the lowest were [[Iceland]], [[Sweden]], Norway, Finland, and Poland.

== Gender stereotypes ==

In a 1993 report released through the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, researchers noted that although women have the same educational opportunities as their male counterparts, the Glass Ceiling persist due to systematic barriers, low representation and mobility, and [[stereotype]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Glass Ceiling: Potential Causes and Possible Solutions|s2cid=29423552|date=1993|publisher=U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences|isbn=|location=|pages=|doi=10.21236/ada278051|last1=Felber|first1=Helene R.|last2=Bayless|first2=J.

Another stereotypes towards women in workplaces is the "gender status belief" which claims that men are more competent and intelligent than women, which would explain why they have higher positions in the career hierarchy. Ultimately, this factor leads to perception of gender-based jobs on the labor market, so men are expected to have more work-related qualifications and hired for top positions. <ref>URL=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/29811/1/605208190.pdf|title=''Glass Ceiling Effect and Earnings - The Gender Pay Gap in Managerial Positions in Germany''</ref> Perceived feminine stereotypes contribute to the glass ceiling faced by women in the workforce.

== Hiring practices ==
When women leave their current place of employment to start their own businesses, they tend to hire other women. Men tend to hire other men. These hiring practices eliminate "the glass ceiling" because there is no more competition of capabilities and discrimination of gender. These support the segregated identification of "men's work" and "women's work."<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Occupational gender segregation Trends and explanations|issue=5|pages=611–624|journal=The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance|volume=39|doi=10.1016/S1062-9769(99)00029-0|date=January 1999|last1=Preston|first1=Jo Anne}}</ref>

== Cross-cultural context ==
Few women tend to reach positions in the upper echelon of society, and organizations are largely still almost exclusively lead by men.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Studies have shown that the glass ceiling still exists in varying levels in different nations and regions across the world.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Bullough|first1=A.|last2=Moore|first2=F.|last3=Kalafatoglu|first3=T.|date=2017|title=Research on women in international business and management: then, now, and next|url=|journal=Cross Cultural & Strategic Management|volume=24|issue=2|pages=211–230|doi=10.1108/CCSM-02-2017-0011}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{Cite book|title=Women in Business and Management: Gaining momentum|last=ILO|publisher=International Labour Office|year=2015|isbn=|location=Geneva|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Pursuit of Gender Equality: An Uphill Battle|last=OECD|publisher=OECD Publishing|year=2017|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}</ref> The stereotypes of women as emotional and sensitive could be seen as key characteristics as to why women struggle to break the glass ceiling.

{{main|Glass escalator}}
A parallel phenomenon called the "[[The Glass Escalator|glass escalator]]" has also been recognized. As more men join fields that were previously dominated by women, such as nursing and teaching, the men are promoted and given more opportunities compared to the women, as if the men were taking escalators and the women were taking the stairs.<ref>{{Cite web|title = A New Obstacle For Professional Women: The Glass Escalator|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2012/05/21/a-new-obstacle-for-professional-women-the-glass-escalator/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref> The chart from Carolyn K.

A 2008 study published in ''[[Social Problems]]'' found that sex segregation in nursing did not follow the "glass escalator" pattern of disproportional vertical distribution; rather, men and women gravitated towards different areas within the field, with male nurses tending to specialize in areas of work perceived as "masculine".<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|url=http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/2/271|title=Revisiting the Glass Escalator: The Case of Gender Segregation in a Female Dominated Occupation|first1=Karrie Ann|last1=Snyder|first2=Adam Isaiah|last2=Green|date=1 May 2008|volume=55|issue=2|pages=271–299|via=socpro.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1525/sp.2008.55.2.271|journal=Social Problems}}</ref> The article noted that "men encounter powerful social pressures that direct them away from entering female-dominated occupations (Jacobs 1989, 1993)". Since female-dominated occupations are usually characterized with more feminine activities, men who enter these jobs can be perceived socially as "effeminate, homosexual, or sexual predators".<ref name=":0" />

==="Sticky floors"===
In the literature on gender discrimination, the concept of "sticky floors" complements the concept of a glass ceiling. Sticky floors can be described as the pattern that women are, compared to men, less likely to start to climb the job ladder. Thereby, this phenomenon is related to gender differentials at the bottom of the wage distribution. Building on the seminal study by Booth and co-authors in European Economic Review,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Booth | first1 = A. L. | last2 = Francesconi | first2 = M. | last3 = Frank | first3 = J. | year = 2003 | title = A sticky floors model of promotion, pay, and gender | url = | journal = European Economic Review | volume = 47 | issue = 2| pages = 295–322 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-2921(01)00197-0 }}</ref> during the last decade economists have attempted to identify sticky floors in the labour market.  They found empirical evidence for the existence of sticky floors in countries such as Australia, Belgium, Italy, Thailand and the United States.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baert | first1 = S. | last2 = De Pauw | first2 = A.-S. | last3 = Deschacht | first3 = N. | year = 2016 | title = Do Employer Preferences Contribute to Sticky Floors? | url = https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/5960457| journal = ILR Review | volume =  69| issue = 3| pages = 714–736 | doi = 10.1177/0019793915625213 }}</ref>

==="The frozen middle"===
Similar to the sticky floor, the frozen middle describes the phenomenon of women's progress up the corporate ladder slowing, if not halting, in the ranks of middle management.<ref>Martell, Richard F., et al. "Sex Stereotyping In The Executive Suite: 'Much Ado About Something'." Journal of Social Behavior & Personality (1998) 127-138. Web.</ref> Originally the term referred to the resistance corporate upper management faced from middle management when issuing directives. Due to a lack of ability or lack of drive in the ranks of middle management these directives do not come into fruition and as a result the company's bottom line suffers. The term was popularized by a ''Harvard Business Review'' article titled "Middle Management Excellence".<ref>Byrnes, Jonathan. "Middle Management Excellence." Harvard Business Review 5 Dec. 2005 pag. print</ref> Due to the growing proportion of women to men in the workforce, however, the term "frozen middle" has become more commonly ascribed to the aforementioned slowing of the careers of women in middle management.<ref>Lyness, Karen S., and Donna E.

==="Second shift"===
The second shift focuses on the idea that women theoretically work a second shift in the manner of having a greater workload, not just doing a greater share of domestic work. All of the tasks that are engaged in outside the workplace are mainly tied to motherhood.{{cn|date=October 2020}} Depending on location, household income, educational attainment, ethnicity and location. Data shows that women do work a second shift in the sense of having a greater workload, not just doing a greater share of domestic work, but this is not apparent if simultaneous activity is overlooked.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=Lyn|year=2007|title=is herre really a second shift, and if so, who does it? a time-diary investigation|url=|journal=Feminist Review|volume=86|issue=1|pages=149–170|jstor=30140855|doi=10.1057/palgrave.fr.9400339}}</ref> [[Alva Myrdal]] and [[Viola Klein]] as early as 1956 focused on the potential of both men and women working in settings that included paid and unpaid types of work environments. Research indicated that men and women could have equal time for activities outside the work environment for family and extra activities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Myrdal|first1=Alva|last2=Klein|first2=Viola|year=1957|title=Women's Two Roles: Home and Work|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=20|issue=2|pages=250|doi=10.2307/2088886|jstor=2088886}}</ref> This "second shift" has also been found to have physical effects as well. Women who engage in longer hours of work in pursuit of family balance, often face increased mental health problesm such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]]. Increased irritability, lower motivation and energy, and other emotional issues were also found to occur as well. The overall happiness of women can be improved if a balance of career and home responsibilities is found.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ahmad|first=Muhammad|year=2011|title=Working women work–life conflict|url=|journal=Business Strategy Series|volume=12|pages=|via=}}</ref>

==="Mommy Track"===
"Mommy Track" refers to women who disregard their careers and professional duties in order to satisfy the needs of their families. Women are often subject to long work hours that creates an imbalance within the work-family schedule.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=E. Jeffery|last2=Martinson|first2=Vjkollca K.|last3=Baker|first3=Robin Zenger|last4=Ferris|first4=Maria|year=2004|title=Beyond The Mommy Track: The Influence of New Concept Part-Time Work for Professional Women on Work and Family|url=|journal=Journal of Family and Economic Issues|volume=25|pages=121–136|doi=10.1023/B:JEEI.0000016726.06264.91}}</ref> There is research suggesting that women are able to function on a part-time professional schedule compared to others who worked full-time while still engaged in external family activities.{{Clarify|date=October 2020}} The research also suggests flexible work arrangements allow for the achievement of a healthy work and family balance. A difference has also been discovered in the cost and amount of effort in childbearing amongst women in higher skilled positions and roles, as opposed to women in lower-skilled jobs. This difference leads to women delaying and postponing goals and career aspirations over a number of years. 

==="Concrete floor"===
The term ''concrete floor'' has been used to refer to the minimum number or the proportion of women necessary for a cabinet or board of directors to be perceived as legitimate.<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=There are three rules of Cabinet appointments |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/25/there-are-three-rules-of-cabinet-appointments-will-donald-trump-break-them/ |quote= |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=November 25, 2016 }}</ref>
