Born in [[Chippenham|Chippenham, Wiltshire]], and raised in both [[Wiltshire]] and [[Shropshire]], Corbyn joined Labour as a teenager. Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]] until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983, and has since been re-elected nine times. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Seán MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017. According to a number of studies, media coverage of Corbyn has often been hostile and misrepresented his views.<ref name="The Guardian push alerts">{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/research/research-projects/representations-of-jeremy-corbyn|title=Journalistic Representations of Jeremy Corbyn in the British Press|last1=Cammaerts|first1=Bart|last2=DeCillia|first2=Brooks|last3=Magalhães|first3=João Carlos|last4=Jimenez-Martinez|first4=Cesar|publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science|date=August 2016|access-date=7 February 2020}}</ref><ref name="independent2" /> Corbyn has condemned [[antisemitism]]<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Corbyn decries anti-Semitism as 'vile and wrong' following chief rabbi's rebuke |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/corbyn-decries-anti-semitism-as-vile-and-wrong-following-chief-rabbis-rebuke/ |work=Times of Israel |location=Jerusalem |date=2019-11-26 |access-date=2020-10-29}}</ref> but has been criticised for his alleged past associations with individuals accused of antisemitism.

Corbyn was elected Leader of the Labour Party in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name="ibtimes"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalising]] public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|railways]], a [[Non-interventionism|less interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]], defeating [[Owen Smith]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but [[Theresa May]] formed a [[minority government]] and the party remained in Opposition. 

In 2019, after [[Parliamentary votes on Brexit|deadlock in Parliament over Brexit]], Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on the withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Keir Starmer]].

Following the Labour Party's defeat at the general election on 7 May 2015, Ed Miliband resigned as its party leader, triggering a [[2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|leadership election]]. Corbyn decided to stand as a candidate, having been disillusioned by the lack of a left-wing voice, and said to his local newspaper, ''The [[Islington Tribune]]'', that he would have a "clear anti-austerity platform". He also said he would vote to scrap the Trident nuclear weapons system and would "seek to withdraw from Nato".

Corbynmania was the enthusiastic support for Jeremy Corbyn. Initially viewed as a token candidate for the left-wing of the party and not expected to win, Corbyn's [[authentic leadership|authentic]], informal style and radical policies appealed to many of the young new members who had joined after the membership fee had been reduced to £3.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33881104 |publisher=BBC |title=Where is Labour's 'Jeremy Corbyn mania' coming from? |first=Mobeen |last=Azhar |date=13 August 2015}}</ref> Hundreds of supporters turned out to hear him speak at the [[husting]]s across the nation and their enthusiastic reception and support for him was dubbed "Corbynmania" by the press.<ref name="LPP"/>

Jonathan Dean characterised Corbymania as a political [[fandom]], comparable with the enthusiastic followings of popular media stars and other modern politicians such as [[Bernie Sanders]] and [[Justin Trudeau]]. Specific features included use of the #jezwecan [[hashtag]], attendance at rallies and the posting of pictures such as [[selfie]]s on [[social media]]. Artistic, merchandising and other activity consolidated and spread this fannish enthusiasm. This included a “Jeremy Corbyn for Prime Minister” (JC4PM) tour by celebrities such as [[Charlotte Church]], [[Jeremy Hardy]], and [[Maxine Peake]]; a Corbyn superhero comic book; mash-ups and videos. Corbyn's personal qualities were earnest and modest and these inspired warm emotions such as devotion and loyalty. These were seen as cultish by critics such as [[Margaret Beckett]] who said in 2016 that the Labour Party had been turned into the "Jeremy Corbyn Fan Club".<ref name=Dean>{{citation |last=Dean |first=Jonathan |year=2017 |title=Politicising Fandom |journal=British Journal of Politics and International Relations |volume=19 |number=2 |pages=408–424 |issn=1369-1481 |doi=10.1177/1369148117701754|s2cid=219972166 |url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/113409/3/DeanPoliticising%20Fandom.pdf}}</ref>

A [[chant]] of "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" was adopted as an anthem or chorus by his supporters.

On 12 July 2016, following a dispute as to whether the elected leader would need nominations in an election as a "challenger" to their own leadership, Labour's [[National Executive Committee of the Labour Party|National Executive Committee]] (NEC) resolved that Corbyn, as the incumbent leader, had an automatic right to be on the ballot,<ref>{{cite news |last=McSmith |first=Andy |date=12 July 2016 |title=Jeremy Corbyn wins NEC vote over right to stand again for Labour leadership |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-latest-news-labour-leadership-nec-what-a7133336.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London, UK |access-date=12 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713161916/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-latest-news-labour-leadership-nec-what-a7133336.html |archive-date=13 July 2016}}</ref> and also decided that members needed to have been a member for more than six months to be eligible to vote, meaning that many members who had joined recently would not be able to vote. The NEC's decision was that "registered supporters" would be entitled to vote if they paid a one off fee of £25. 184,541 people subsequently paid the one-off fee to become "registered supporters" of the party during the two-day window in July, meaning that over 700,000 people had a vote in the leadership election.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://next.ft.com/content/77e1ac44-4eac-11e6-88c5-db83e98a590a | title=180,000 people each paid £25 to vote for its next leader. |access-date=21 July 2016 | date=21 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=independent-20150910>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-leadership-contest-after-88-days-of-campaigning-how-did-labours-candidates-do-10495726.html |title=Labour leadership contest: After 88 days of campaigning, how did Labour's candidates do? |author=Oliver Wright |newspaper=The Independent |date=10 September 2015 |access-date=11 September 2015 |quote=the electorate is divided into three groups: 292,000 members, 148,000 union "affiliates" and 112,000 registered supporters who each paid £3 to take part |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914020112/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-leadership-contest-after-88-days-of-campaigning-how-did-labours-candidates-do-10495726.html |archive-date=14 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-party-183000-membership-applications-in-48-hours-a7146976.html | title=Labour Party receives more than 183,000 membership applications in 48 hours | newspaper=The Independent | access-date=21 July 2016 | date=21 July 2016 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721123309/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-party-183000-membership-applications-in-48-hours-a7146976.html | archive-date=21 July 2016 | df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/labour-stops-crowd-funding-bid-to-help-supporters-pay-for-vote | title=Labour signs up more than 180,000 supporters to vote in leadership contest | newspaper=The Guardian | access-date=21 July 2016 | date=21 July 2016 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721043659/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/labour-stops-crowd-funding-bid-to-help-supporters-pay-for-vote | archive-date=21 July 2016 | df=dmy-all}}</ref>

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that there was "seemingly no proof of active obstruction" by Labour officials during the 2017 election and that any evidence was "circumstantial rather than a smoking gun".

Corbyn advisor [[Andrew Murray (trade unionist)|Andrew Murray]] later said that the Salisbury attack was "something we got wrong", saying "evidence that’s emerged since is overwhelming". Murray said that at the time Corbyn and his team "just didn't think the Russian state would be so stupid and brazen as to [...] carry out a poisoning attack on British soil", although he admitted "given the Litvinenko precedent perhaps we should have done".

Corbyn opposes austerity, and has advocated an economic strategy based on investing-to-grow as opposed to making spending cuts. During his first Labour leadership election campaign, Corbyn proposed that the [[Bank of England]] should be able to issue money for capital spending, especially housebuilding, instead of [[quantitative easing]], which attempts to stimulate the economy by buying assets from commercial banks. He describes it as "[[People's Quantitative Easing]]".<ref name="plan" /> A number of economists, including [[Steve Keen]], argued in a letter to ''The Guardian'' that, although there were other opinions, their view was that there was nothing "extreme left" about the anti-austerity policies he proposed in his leadership campaign.<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news|title=The Labour party stands at a crossroads|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/14/the-labour-party-stands-at-a-crossroads|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815122541/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/14/the-labour-party-stands-at-a-crossroads|archive-date=15 August 2015|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> [[Robert Skidelsky]] offered a qualified endorsement of Corbyn's proposals to carry out QE through a National Investment Bank.<ref name="The Guardian"/><ref>[[Robert Skidelsky]], [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/19/corbynomics-why-we-should-take-it-seriously 'Why we should take Corbynomics seriously,'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919080033/http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/19/corbynomics-why-we-should-take-it-seriously |date=19 September 2015}} ''[[The Guardian]]'' 19 August 2015.</ref> As the policy would change the central bank's focus on stabilising prices it has been argued it could increase the perceived risk of investing in the UK and raise the prospect of increased inflation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Peston|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Peston|date=12 August 2015|title=Would Corbyn's 'QE for people' float or sink Britain?|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33884836|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818102547/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33884836|archive-date=18 August 2015}}</ref> His second leadership campaign saw him promise £500 billion in additional public spending, though he did not detail how he would fund it.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Eaton|first1=George|title=How would Jeremy Corbyn pay for his spending pledges?|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/08/how-would-jeremy-corbyn-pay-his-spending-pledges|access-date=24 August 2016|work=New Statesman|date=4 August 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826163616/http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/08/how-would-jeremy-corbyn-pay-his-spending-pledges|archive-date=26 August 2016}}</ref>

===Education===
During the 2015 Labour leadership contest, Corbyn put forward a policy to scrap all tuition fees and restore student maintenance grants. The cost of the policy was estimated at £10 billion which would be funded by "a 7% rise in [[National Insurance|national insurance]] for those earning over £50,000 a year and a 2.5% higher corporation tax, or by slowing the pace at which the deficit is reduced". Corbyn apologised for the actions of previous Labour governments in imposing "fees, top-up fees and the replacement of grants with loans". He said "I opposed those changes at the time – as did many others – and now we have an opportunity to change course".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wintour |first1=Patrick |title=Jeremy Corbyn announces £10bn plan to scrap university tuition fees |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/15/jeremy-corbyn-announces-10bn-plan-to-scrap-university-tuition-fees |access-date=24 March 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 July 2015}}</ref>

During the 2017 election, Corbyn had a policy of scrapping university tuition fees from 2018 restoring the maintenance grants abolished by the Conservatives in 2016 and funding a free national education service. He also pledged to investigate cancelling student loan debts incurred by recent graduates. The policy said that the British average student starts their working life with debts of £44,000 due to tuition costs and that university tuition is free in many northern European countries. The education changes were costed at £9.5 billion and would be funded by increasing taxes on the top 5 per cent of earners and increasing corporations tax.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mason |first1=Rowena |title=Labour pledges to abolish tuition fees as early as autumn 2017 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/21/labour-abolish-university-tuition-fees-jeremy-corbyn-eu-uk-europe |access-date=24 March 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=21 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Chang |first1=Charis |title=Is Jeremy Corbyn's policy for free university education as crazy as it sounds? |url=https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/world-economy/is-jeremy-corbyns-policy-for-free-university-education-as-crazy-as-it-sounds/news-story/cd892492447bc3aca5621d9c5005cf21 |access-date=24 March 2019 |agency=AP |date=14 June 2017}}</ref>

In June 2016, in the run-up to the EU referendum, Corbyn said that there was an "overwhelming case" for staying in the EU. In a speech in London, Corbyn said: "We, the Labour Party, are overwhelmingly for staying in, because we believe the European Union has brought investment, jobs and protection for workers, consumers and the environment." Corbyn also criticised media coverage and warnings from both sides, saying that the debate had been dominated too much by "myth-making and prophecies of doom".<ref>{{cite news|last=Pienaar|first=John|date=2 June 2016|title=Jeremy Corbyn says 'overwhelming case' for staying in EU|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36430606|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913141401/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36430606|archive-date=13 September 2016}}</ref> He said he was "seven, or seven and a half" out of 10 for staying in the EU.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36506163|title=Corbyn: I'm 'seven out of 10' on EU|work=BBC News|date=11 June 2016|access-date=24 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614142834/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36506163|archive-date=14 June 2016}}</ref>

In January 2018, Corbyn reiterated that Labour would not seek to keep the UK in the single market after Brexit and in June 2018 he called for a "new single market" deal for the UK after Brexit maintaining "full access" to the EU internal market, as opposed to the "[[European Economic Area#EEA and Norway Grants|Norway model]]" which pro-Remainers in the party wish to see.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=8 January 2018|title=Jeremy Corbyn insists UK cannot remain in single market after Brexit|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/08/jeremy-corbyn-eu-single-market-after-brexit|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref name="Sky_single">{{Cite news | last = Craig | first = Jon | title = Corbyn facing Labour backlash as he demands 'new single market' after Brexit | url = https://news.sky.com/story/corbyn-facing-labour-backlash-as-he-demands-new-single-market-after-brexit-11396029 | work = [[Sky News]] | date = 6 June 2018 | access-date = 24 September 2018}}</ref>

In 2018, Corbyn said his main reason for not committing to remaining in the single market was freedom from EU rules on state aid to industry. He said the UK government should not be "held back, inside or outside the EU, from taking the steps we need to support cutting edge industries and local business".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stone |first1=Jon |title=Brexit: Public backs Jeremy Corbyn's plan to abandon EU state aid rules, poll shows |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-state-aid-plan-brexit-restrictions-public-support-britain-eu-trade-a8297616.html |access-date=6 October 2018 |newspaper=The Independent |date=10 April 2018}}</ref> This prompted backlash from senior EU figures, who said that state subsidisation would be a "red line" in negotiations, as it would lead to a possible trade war between the UK and EU. One senior figure told ''The Times'': "We have to protect ourselves and the single market ... If a Corbyn government implements his declared policies the level playing field mechanism will lead to increased costs for Britain to access the single market because of distortions caused by state aid."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waterfield |first1=Bruno |last2=Fisher |first2=Lucy |title=Fear of Jeremy Corbyn-led government prompts tough EU line on Brexit |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fear-of-corbyn-prompts-tough-eu-line-on-brexit-lrcmwgvlx |access-date=6 October 2018 |work=[[The Times]] |url-access=subscription  |date=7 May 2018}}</ref>

Also in 2018, Corbyn said he would seek a new type of customs union with the European Union, but will seek exemptions of some EU regulations for the UK, such as those regarding state aid and government subsidies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d7673a26-1af2-11e8-956a-43db76e69936|title=Corbyn's customs union plan – what it might mean|first=Jim|last=Brunsden|date=26 February 2018|website=Financial Times}}</ref>

In January 2019, Labour lost a vote of no confidence in the government. The Conservative government sought to open cross-party talks while Corbyn initially said Labour would refuse to attend talks unless the government ruled out a "[[no deal Brexit]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/corbyn-no-talks-with-may-until-no-deal-brexit-is-off-table|title=Corbyn: no talks with May until no-deal Brexit is off table|first=Dan|last=Sabbagh|date=16 January 2019|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> In March 2019, Corbyn said that he could vote leave in a second referendum, depending on the Brexit deal on offer.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hossein-Pour|first=Anahita|title=Jeremy Corbyn says he could vote to leave EU in second Brexit referendum|url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/brexit/news/102579/jeremy-corbyn-says-he-could-vote-leave-eu-second-brexit|date=17 March 2019|work=PoliticsHome|access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref>

For these comments and a refusal to answer whether he would defend a NATO ally in the case of attack he was criticised by [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], the former Prime Minister of Denmark and [[Secretary General of NATO|NATO Secretary General]], who said Corbyn's opinions were "tempting President [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] to aggression" and made comparisons between his views and those of the American president Donald Trump. He was also criticised by [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen|George Robertson]], former Labour Party defence secretary, who said "It beggars belief that the leader of the party most responsible for the collective security pact of NATO should be so reckless as to undermine it by refusing to say he would come to the aid of an ally".<ref name=":02">{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/19/jeremy-corbyn-called-for-nato-to-be-closed-down-and-members-to-g/|title=Jeremy Corbyn called for Nato to be closed down and members to 'give up, go home and go away'|last1=Hughes|first1=Laura|date=19 August 2016|work=The Telegraph|access-date=5 August 2018|last2=Swinford|first2=Steven|issn=0307-1235|last3=Farmer|first3=Ben}}</ref>

At a meeting hosted by Stop the War Coalition in 2009, Corbyn said he invited "friends" from [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]] to an event in parliament, referred to Hamas as "an organisation dedicated towards the good of the Palestinian people," and said that the British government's labelling of Hamas as a terrorist organisation is "a big, big historical mistake."<ref>{{cite web|title = Britain's Labour Party Is Cutting Off Its Nose to Spite Its Face|url = https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/24/britains-labour-party-has-a-lefty-problem-jeremy-corbyn/|website = Foreign Policy|access-date = 31 December 2015|url-status=live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151228060809/http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/24/britains-labour-party-has-a-lefty-problem-jeremy-corbyn/|archive-date = 28 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Asked on ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' in July 2015 why he had called representatives from Hamas and Hezbollah "friends", Corbyn explained, "I use it in a collective way, saying our friends are prepared to talk," and that the specific occasion he used it was to introduce speakers from Hezbollah at a Parliamentary meeting about the Middle East. He said that he does not condone the actions of either organisation: "Does it mean I agree with Hamas and what it does? No. Does it mean I agree with Hezbollah and what they do? No. What it means is that I think to bring about a peace process, you have to talk to people with whom you may profoundly disagree … There is not going to be a peace process unless there is talks involving Israel, Hezbollah and Hamas and I think everyone knows that", he argued.

In January 2017, Corbyn expressed concern about Israeli involvement in British politics, after the broadcasting of ''[[The Lobby (TV series)|The Lobby]]''.He described the actions of the Israeli official, Shai Masot, as "improper interference in this country's democratic process" and was concerned on national security grounds that Boris Johnson had said the matter was closed.<ref>{{cite news |title=UK: Corbyn calls for probe into Israeli 'interference' |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/uk-corbyn-calls-probe-israeli-interference-170113202756949.html |access-date=7 June 2019 |publisher=al Jazeera |date=14 January 2017}}</ref>

In his keynote speech at the 2018 annual Labour Party conference, Corbyn said that, if elected, his government would immediately recognise the Palestinian State as a way of supporting a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

In 2016, after Corbyn released a video stating his "solidarity to stand with the Tamil community in the search for truth, justice, accountability and reconciliation", while the Labour Party reiterated its " full implementation of the UN Human Rights Councils resolution on Sri Lanka", some Tamil activists interpreted the video to be a signal of Jeremy Corbyn's "support for Tamil self-determination".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/asia/190516/uk-s-labour-party-supports-sri-lankan-tamil-cause.html|title=UK's Labour Party supports Sri Lankan Tamil cause | agency=Deccan Chronicle|date =19 May 2016}}</ref> In 2017, [[John McDonnell]] stated that a Corbyn led Labour government would end arms sales to Sri Lanka.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/corbyn-government-will-end-military-aid-to-sri-lanka-john-mcdonnell/|title=Corbyn Government Will End Military Aid To Sri Lanka: John McDonnell|agency=Colombo Telegraph|author=TU Senan |date=7 May 2017 |access-date=13 February 2019}}</ref>

In response to the criticism, Corbyn said he regretted that he "did not look more closely at the image", agreed it was antisemitic and endorsed the decision to remove it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/23/corbyn-criticised-after-backing-artist-behind-antisemitic-mural|title=Corbyn in antisemitism row after backing artist behind 'offensive' mural|last=Stewart|first=Heather|publisher=’The Guardian’|date=23 March 2018|access-date=14 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Lipstadt|first=Deborah E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWJKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA60|title=Antisemitism: Here and Now|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=2019|isbn=978-0-8052-4338-3|pages=59–61|author-link=Deborah Lipstadt}}</ref> In 2020, the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC) revealed that an antisemitism complaint had been made against Corbyn in April 2018 over his defence of the mural, and members of Corbyn's office "directly interfered in the decision not to investigate the case,” an example of political interference the EHRC concluded was "unlawful".<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Courea|first1=Eleni|last2=Fisher|first2=Lucy|last3=Elliott|first3=Francis|date=29 October 2020|title=Jeremy Corbyn suspended from Labour after antisemitism verdict|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jeremy-corbyns-labour-guilty-of-multiple-failures-on-antisemitism-b6dsd3mq3|website=The Times}}</ref> Corbyn was criticised for a 2013 speech in which he said of certain "Zionists" who had "berated" the Palestinian speaker at a meeting, "they don’t want to study history and secondly having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all their lives, they don't understand English irony either" (used by the speaker).<ref name="https">{{cite news |last1=Stewart |first1=Heather |last2=Sparrow |first2=Andrew |title=Jeremy Corbyn: I used the term 'Zionist' in accurate political sense |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/24/corbyn-english-irony-video-reignites-antisemitism-row-labour |access-date=12 September 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=24 August 2018}}</ref><ref name="Paul JPost">{{Cite news|url=https://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-envoy-to-Britain-dismisses-two-state-solution|title=Palestinian envoy to Britain dismisses two-state solution|last=Paul|first=Jonny|date=20 January 2013|newspaper=Jerusalem Post|access-date=27 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://labourbriefing.squarespace.com/home/2018/8/29/full-texxt-of-that-speech-by-jeremy-on-zionists-and-a-sense-of-irony |title=Full text of that speech by Jeremy on the Palestinian ambassador to the UK, English irony and certain Zionist critics, ['Britain's Legacy in Palestine' conference, 19 January 2013, Friends Meeting House, Palestinian Return Centre]|last=Corbyn|first=Jeremy|date=29 August 2018|newspaper=[[Labour Briefing]] website|access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/26/jeremy-corbyn-official-antisemitism-complaint|title=Remarks about Zionists draw official complaint against Jeremy Corbyn |date=26 August 2018|work=[[The Observer]]|access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/28/corbyns-comments-most-offensive-since-enoch-powell-says-ex-chief-rabbi|title=Corbyn's comments most offensive since Enoch Powell, says ex-chief rabbi|first=Peter|last=Walker|date=28 August 2018|website=The Guardian|access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref> The remarks were criticised for appearing to perpetuate the antisemitic canard that Jews fail or refuse to integrate into wider society.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://forward.com/opinion/409041/anti-semitic-dogwhistles-dont-sound-like-hitler-thats-why-theyre/ |title=Why Jeremy Corbyn's Dog Whistles Are As Dangerous As Actual Anti-Semitism |first=Noah |last=Berlatsky |access-date=9 April 2019 |publisher=[[The Forward]] |date=27 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-english-fetishization-of-irony |title=Jeremy Corbyn and the English Fetishization of Irony |first=Rebecca |last=Mead |access-date=9 April 2019 |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=27 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/24/jeremy-corbyn-antisemitism-labour-zionists-2013-speech |title=I still don't believe Corbyn is antisemitic – but his 'irony' comments unquestionably were |first=Simon |last=Hattenstone |access-date=9 April 2019 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-jeremy-corbyn-s-good-jews-are-mostly-dead-1.6419528|title=Jeremy Corbyn's 'good Jews' are mostly dead &#124;

Following coverage of alleged antisemitic statements by party members, Corbyn commissioned the [[Chakrabarti Inquiry]] and supported changes to the party's rules and procedures to make hate crime a disciplinary offence. In July 2018, Labour, with Corbyn's support, agreed a code of conduct which excluded or amended some of the examples from the [[Working Definition of Antisemitism|IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism]] relating to Israel.

An internal Labour Party report, entitled ''The work of the Labour Party's Governance and Legal Unit in relation to antisemitism, 2014–2019'', which was leaked to the media in April 2020, stated that Corbyn's team inherited a lack of "robust processes, systems, training, education and effective line management" as well as factional hostility towards Corbyn amongst former senior officials. This contributed to "a litany of mistakes" which "affected the expeditious and resolute handling of disciplinary complaints". The investigation, which was completed in March 2020, concluded there was "no evidence" of antisemitism complaints being treated differently to other forms of complaint, or of current or former staff being "motivated by antisemitic intent".<ref name="Rayner">{{cite news |last=Rayner|first=Tom|url=https://news.sky.com/story/labour-antisemitism-investigation-will-not-be-sent-to-equality-commission-11972071|title=Labour antisemitism investigation will not be sent to equality commission|work=Sky News|date=12 April 2020|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref> It was later reported{{by whom|date=November 2020}} that the Labour Party's most senior lawyer had said that the report was deliberately misleading.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/24/labour-was-warned-antisemitism-report-was-deliberately-misleading-leak-reveals|title=Labour was warned antisemitism report was deliberately misleading, leak reveals|date=24 July 2020|website=the Guardian}}</ref> The report also stated that Corbyn's office was not made aware of the scale of the antisemitism problem in the party because former [[General Secretary of the Labour Party|General Secretary]] [[Iain McNicol]], and other senior figures provided "false and misleading information" to his office.<ref name="sky120420"/> It found that McNicol and staff in the Governance and Legal Unit "provided timetables for the resolution of cases that were never met; falsely claimed to have processed all antisemitism complaints; falsely claimed that most complaints received were not about Labour members and provided highly inaccurate statistics of antisemitism complaints".<ref name="sky120420"/> The report also stated Sam Matthews, who was Head of Disputes and acting Head of the Governance and Legal Unit, "rarely replied or took any action" in relation to antisemitism complaints.<ref name="sky120420"/> It said the process for tackling antisemitism complaints improved when [[Jennie Formby]] became general secretary in 2018.<ref name="guardian120420"/>

In July 2020, Corbyn expressed disappointment at the Labour Party's decision to apologise and financially settle defamation cases arising from its response to the July 2019 BBC ''[[Panorama (British TV programme)|Panorama]]'' programme ''Is Labour Anti-Semitic?''
