It was released on June 11, 2002, by [[Columbia Records]] as the lead single from the [[soundtrack album]] to the film ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', in which Beyoncé stars as [[Foxxy Cleopatra]].

Beyoncé co-wrote the song with its producers, [[Pharrell Williams]] and [[Chad Hugo]]. "Work It Out" is an [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song which incorporates elements of 1960s and 1970s [[funk]] and [[post-disco]].

The song was generally well received by music critics, many of whom complimented its [[retro style]] and various influences. It has been credited as the beginning of Beyoncé's career as a successful solo artist, after finding success as the lead singer of [[Destiny's Child]]. "Work It Out" was nominated in the category of Best Original or Adapted Song at the [[Black Reel Awards of 2003|2003 Black Reel Awards]]. Commercially, the song failed to make an impact on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] but managed to find success on a few [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' component charts]], topping the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart. "Work It Out" also reached the top ten in Norway and the UK.

The song's accompanying [[music video]] was shot and directed by [[Matthew Rolston]]. The video features Beyoncé playing Foxxy Cleopatra, and draws inspiration from several 1960s and 1970s motifs. The video was nominated at the [[MTV Video Music Awards Japan 2003|MTV Video Music Awards Japan]] in the category Best Video from a Film. "Work It Out" has been parodied and covered on several live television programs, including ''[[American Idol]]'' and ''[[America's Best Dance Crew (season 4)|America's Best Dance Crew]]''. Since its release, the song has been regularly included on several of Beyoncé's tours and concerts.

==Background and release==
In the 2002 film ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', Beyoncé portrays [[Foxxy Cleopatra]], the female protagonist alongside the film's lead character, [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]], portrayed by Canadian film actor and comedian [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]. Cleopatra is a [[parody]] of the characters in [[blaxploitation]] films such as ''[[Foxy Brown (film)|Foxy Brown]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra Jones]]'', both of which are used in her name.<ref name="chica">{{cite news|title=Austin Powers In Goldmember |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020726/REVIEWS/207260301/1023|author=Roger Ebert|date=July 26, 2002|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> Her clothing style is reminiscent of the [[disco]] era and her hair is in the [[afro]] style of the time.<ref name="chica"/> Taking inspiration from her portrayal, Beyoncé adopted in the song a persona similar to that of Cleopatra.

After performing a simple choreography, Beyoncé begins her verse by singing into a microphone that has her name written on it with sparkles, with the scenery of the shot being a stage with a colorful background, and scenes from ''Goldmember'' pieced throughout the video. Beyoncé performs in a cube with disco-scenery shown on the walls, ceiling, and projected onto Beyoncé, who plays with hula hoops while wearing "Virgo" bedazzled jeans throughout the video. As the video ends, Beyoncé is seen back on the beginning stage performing a dance-routine with three backup dancers; the video ending with the movie theater cheering for the video, while Cleopatra and Powers smile at each other.

Cynthia Fuchs of ''PopMatters'' reviewed the music video, stating: "The video offers up a standard-seeming series of body parts—eye, navel, huge hair—but at the same time emphasizes Beyoncé's frankly awesome power, recalling Aretha and especially Tina Turner as she snuggles up to the mic stand, her ferocious thighs revealed beneath a sequined miniskirt. In her first solo effort, Beyoncé declares herself a singular personality, a body, and a performer.

She's magnetic."<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyUEAAAAMBAJ&q=work+it+out&pg=PA114 |title=The Metamorphosis |journal=Vibe |first=Mimi |last=Valdés |volume=10 |issue=10|page=122 |date=October 2002 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

==Cover versions==
The Los Angeles-based band [[Vitamin String Quartet]], paid tribute to Beyoncé by doing their own version of "Work It Out" and adding it to their 2003 album, ''The String Quartet Tribute to Beyoncé''. According to Tim Sendra of [[AllMusic]], their version has more than four instruments on it as do most of the tracks, making it "more of a symphonic tribute to Beyoncé".<ref>{{cite web |author=Tim Sendra |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-string-quartet-tribute-to-beyonce-r668531/review |title=The String Quartet Tribute to Beyonce |website=AllMusic |date=November 25, 2003 |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}</ref> The song has been performed by many reality television shows, which later led to the group or person winning that current challenge.
