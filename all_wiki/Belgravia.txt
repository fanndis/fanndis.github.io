'''Belgravia''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɛ|l|ˈ|ɡ|r|eɪ|v|i|ə}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/belgravia|title=Belgravia|accessdate=24 September 2014|publisher=Collins Dictionary|date=n.d.}}</ref> is an affluent [[district]] in [[Central London]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/LP2011%20Chapter%202.pdf|title=London's Places|work=[[The London Plan]]|publisher=[[Greater London Authority]]|year=2011|page=46|format=PDF|accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref> shared within the authorities of both the [[City of Westminster]] and the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]].

Belgravia was known as Five Fields [[Tudor London|during the Middle Ages]], and became a dangerous place due to highwaymen and robberies. It was developed in the early 19th century by [[Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster]] under the direction of [[Thomas Cubitt]], focusing on numerous grand terraces centred on [[Belgrave Square]] and [[Eaton Square]]. Much of Belgravia, known as the [[Grosvenor Group#The Grosvenor Estate|Grosvenor Estate]], is still owned by a family property company, the Duke of Westminster's [[Grosvenor Group]]. Owing to the [[Leasehold Reform Act 1967]], the estate has been forced to sell many [[freehold (law)|freehold]]s to its former tenants.

== Name ==
Belgravia takes its name from one of the [[Duke of Westminster]]'s subsidiary titles, Viscount Belgrave, which is in turn derived from [[Belgrave, Cheshire]], a village on land belonging to the Duke.

==Geography==
[[File:Belgravia map.png|thumb|left|A map of Belgravia. The green square in the centre of the map is [[Belgrave Square]].]]

Belgravia is near the former course of the [[River Westbourne]], a tributary of the [[River Thames]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=56}} The area is mostly in the [[City of Westminster]], with a small part of the western section in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite map|url=https://mapit.mysociety.org/area/2504.html|title=Westminster City Council|accessdate=4 December 2017}}</ref>

The district lies mostly to the south-west of [[Buckingham Palace]], and is bounded notionally by Knightsbridge (the road) to the north, [[Grosvenor Place]] and Buckingham Palace Road to the east, [[Pimlico|Pimlico Road]] to the south,<ref name="CWHR">{{cite web|url=http://www.cwhr.co.uk/rent/area-guides/belgravia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228192927/http://www.cwhr.co.uk/rent/area-guides/belgravia|url-status = dead|archive-date=28 February 2009|title=Belgravia – "The rich man's Pimlico"|publisher=City West Homes Residential|accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref> and [[Sloane Street]] to the west.

The area is mostly residential, the particular exceptions being [[Belgrave Square]] in the centre, [[Eaton Square]] to the south, and [[Buckingham Palace Gardens]] to the east.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|pp=57, 263}}

==History==
[[File:The NE side of Belgrave Square by Thomas Hosmer Shepherd 1827-28.JPG|thumb|[[Belgrave Square]] in the late 1820s, shortly after construction]]

The area takes its name from the village of [[Belgrave, Cheshire]], two miles (3&nbsp;km) from the Grosvenor family's main country seat of [[Eaton Hall (Cheshire)|Eaton Hall]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=56}} One of the [[Duke of Westminster]]'s subsidiary titles is Viscount Belgrave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C3647241|title=Chester Palatinate – Richard Grosvenor (Viscount Belgrave)|publisher=The National Archives|id=1829|accessdate=4 December 2017}}</ref>

During the [[Middle Ages]], the area was known as the Five Fields and was a series of fields used for grazing, intersected by footpaths.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=56}} The Westbourne was crossed by Bloody Bridge, so called because it was frequented by robbers and highwaymen, and it was unsafe to cross the fields at night. In 1728, a man's body was discovered by the bridge with half his face and five fingers removed. In 1749, a [[muffin man]] was robbed and left blind. Five Fields' distance from London also made it a popular spot for [[duelling]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=57}}

Despite its reputation for crime and violence, Five Fields was a pleasant area during the daytime, and various market gardens were established. The area began to be built up after [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] moved to [[Buckingham Palace|Buckingham House]] and constructed a row of houses on what is now [[Grosvenor Place]]. In the 1820s, [[Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster]] asked [[Thomas Cubitt]] to design an estate. Most of Belgravia was constructed over the next 30 years; it attempted to rival Mayfair in its prestige.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=57}}

[[File:Upper Belgrave Street, Belgravia - DSC05404.JPG|thumb|Upper Belgrave Street, Belgravia]]

Belgravia is characterised by grand terraces of white [[stucco]] houses, and is focused on [[Belgrave Square]] and [[Eaton Square]]. It was one of London's most fashionable residential districts from its beginnings.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fodor's London 2014|p=239|publisher=Fodor's Travel|year=2013|isbn=978-0-770-43220-1}}</ref> After [[World War II]], some of the largest houses ceased to be used as residences, or [[townhouse]]s for the country gentry and aristocracy, and were increasingly occupied by embassies, charity headquarters, professional institutions and other businesses. Belgravia has become a relatively quiet district in the heart of London, contrasting with neighbouring districts, which have far more busy shops, large modern office buildings, hotels and entertainment venues. Many embassies are located in the area, especially in Belgrave Square.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=56}}

In the early 21st century, some houses are being reconverted to residential use, because offices in old houses are no longer as desirable as they were in the post-war decades, while the number of [[ultra high-net-worth individual|super-rich]] in London is at a high level not seen since at least 1939. The average house price in Belgravia, as of March 2010, was £6.6 million,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8552483.stm|title=Belgravia square tops expensive homes list |work=BBC News|date=8 March 2010|accessdate=14 December 2017}}</ref> although many houses in Belgravia are among the most expensive anywhere in the world, costing up to £100 million, £4,671 per square foot (£50,000 per m<sup>2</sup>).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/record-100m-price-tag-on-london-house-6866841.html|title=Record £100m price-tag on London house|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>

As of 2013, many residential properties in Belgravia were owned by wealthy foreigners who may have other luxury residences in exclusive locations worldwide; so many are temporarily unoccupied because their owners are elsewhere. The increase in land value has been in sharp contrast to UK average and left the area empty and isolated.<ref name=NYT4113>{{cite news|title=A Slice of London So Exclusive Even the Owners Are Visitors|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/world/europe/a-slice-of-london-so-exclusive-even-the-owners-are-visitors.html|accessdate=2 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 April 2013|author=Sarah Lyall}}</ref>

==Squares and streets==
{{see also|Street names of Belgravia}}

===Belgrave Square===
[[File:Royal College of Psychiatrists, Belgrave Square.jpg|thumb|The former [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]], [[Belgrave Square]]]]

[[Belgrave Square]], one of the grandest and largest 19th-century squares, is the centrepiece of Belgravia. It was laid out by the property contractor [[Thomas Cubitt]] for the [[Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster|2nd Earl Grosvenor]], later to be the 1st Marquess of Westminster, beginning in 1826. Building was largely complete by the 1840s.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|pp=56–57}}

The original scheme consisted of four terraces, each made up of eleven grand white stuccoed houses, apart from the south-east terrace, which had twelve; detached mansions were in three of the corners and there was a private central garden.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=56}} The numbering is anti-clockwise from the north: NW terrace Nos. 1 to 11, west corner mansion No. 12, SW terrace 13–23, south corner mansion No. 24, SE terrace Nos. 25–36, east corner mansion No. 37, NE terrace Nos. 38–48.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Belgrave+Square,+Belgravia,+London+SW1X/@51.4967714,-0.1542433,305a,35y,44.89t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4876053b5f2090b5:0xd2e055784d87846e!8m2!3d51.4985699!4d-0.1542555|title=Belgrave Square, Belgravia, London|publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=5 December 2017|at=Zoom around the Streetview plan to verify house numbers}}</ref>

There is also a slightly later detached house at the northern corner, No. 49, which was built by Cubitt for [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sidney Herbert]] in 1847.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=56}} The terraces were designed by [[George Basevi]] (cousin of [[Benjamin Disraeli]]). The largest of the corner mansions, [[Seaford House]] in the east corner, was designed by [[Philip Hardwick]], and the one in the west corner was designed by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]], completed around 1830.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=56}}

The square contains statues of [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Simón Bolívar]], [[José de San Martín]], [[Prince Henry the Navigator]], the 1st Marquess of Westminster, a bust of [[George Basevi]] and a sculpture entitled "Homage to Leonardo, the Vitruvian Man", by Italian sculptor [[Enzo Plazzotta]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/speel/london/belgrave.htm |title=Belgrave Square |author=Bob Speel |accessdate=3 December 2009 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513174644/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/speel/london/belgrave.htm |archive-date=13 May 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Eaton Square===
[[File:St Peter's Eaton Square, Belgravia.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|St Peter's, [[Eaton Square]]]]

[[Eaton Square]] is one of three garden squares built by the Grosvenor family, and is named after [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire]], the family's principal seat. It is longer but less grand than Belgrave Square, and is an elongated rectangle. The first block was laid out by Cubitt in 1826, but the square was not completed until 1855, the year of his death. The long construction period is reflected in the variety of architecture along the square.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=263}}

The houses in Eaton Square are large, predominantly three bay wide buildings, joined in regular terraces in a classical style, with four or five main storeys, plus attic and basement and a [[mews house]] behind. The square is one of London's largest and is divided into six compartments by the upper end of [[Kings Road]] (northeast of [[Sloane Square]]), a main road, now busy with traffic, that occupies its long axis, and two smaller cross streets.{{sfn|Brandon|Brooke|2016|p=26}}

Although not as fashionable as some of the other squares in London, Eaton Square was home to several key figures. [[George FitzClarence, 1st Earl of Munster]], the illegitimate son of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], lived at No.&nbsp;13, while [[Stanley Baldwin]] and [[Neville Chamberlain]] lived at No&nbsp;93 and No.&nbsp;37 respectively. Since World War II, Eaton Square has become less residential; the Bolivian Embassy is at No.&nbsp;106 while the Belgian Embassy is at No.&nbsp;103.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=263}}

At the east end of the square is [[St Peter's Church, Eaton Square|St Peter's Church]]. It was designed by [[Henry Hakewill]] and built between 1824 and 1827 during the first development of Eaton Square. The first church was destroyed by fire in 1836 and rebuilt by Hakewill, and again in 1987, when it was restored by the Braithwaite Partnership.{{sfn|Brandon|Brooke|2016|p=26}}{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=813}} It is a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade II* listed building]], in a [[Greek revival]] style featuring a six-columned [[Ionic order|Ionic portico]] and a clock tower.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1356980 |desc=Church of St Peter |grade=II* |accessdate=20 March 2017}}</ref>{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=813}}

Eaton Place is an extension to the square, developed by Cubitt between 1826 and 1845. The scientist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]] lived here, as did the [[Irish Unionist]] [[Edward Carson]]. [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet]] was assassinated by Irish Republicans in 1922 as he was leaving No.&nbsp;36.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=263}}

===Upper Belgrave Street===
Upper Belgrave Street was constructed in the 1840s to connect King's Road with Belgrave Square.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=961}} It is a wide one-way residential street with grand white stuccoed buildings. It stretches from the south-east corner of Belgrave Square to the north-east corner of Eaton Square. Most of the houses have now been divided into flats and achieve sale prices as high as £3,500 per square foot. Many of the buildings were constructed by Cubitt in the 1820s and 1830s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[Walter Bagehot]], a writer, banker and economist, lived at No. 12 during the 1860s. [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] lived at No 9 in 1880–1881. [[John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan]] lived at No.&nbsp;46, and disappeared without trace from there in 1974 after his children's nanny was found murdered.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=961}}

===Chester Square===
[[File:Chester Square1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chester Square]]]]

[[Chester Square]] is a smaller, residential garden square, the last of the three garden squares built by the Grosvenor family. It is named after the city of [[Chester]], near Eaton Hall. Members of the family also represented [[Chester (UK Parliament constituency)|Chester]] as [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]].<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The western suburbs: Belgravia', Old and New London|last= Walford|first= Edward|year= 1878|pages= 1–14|url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45218|accessdate= 3 December 2009}}</ref> The garden, just under {{convert|1.5|acre|m2}} in size, is planted with shrubs and herbaceous borders. It was refurbished in 1997, to the layout that appears in the [[Ordnance Survey]] map of 1867. Past residents include the poet [[Matthew Arnold]] (1822–88) at No. 2, [[Mary Shelley]] (1797–1851) at No. 24, [[John Liddell (Royal Navy officer)|John Liddell]] (1794–1868) at No. 72, [[Margaret Thatcher]] (1925–2013) at No. 73, and Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] (1880–1962) resided at No. 77 from 1940 until 1945.<ref>{{cite book |last= Steves |first= Rick. |title= Rick Steves' England 2013 |publisher= Avalon Travel Publishing |year= 2012 |page= [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781612383897/page/168 168] |isbn= 1612383890 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781612383897/page/168 }}</ref>{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=161}}

===Wilton Crescent===
[[File:Wilton Crescent.jpg|thumb|[[Wilton Crescent]] (numbers 15 onwards)]]

[[Wilton Crescent]] was created by [[Thomas Cundy II]], the [[Grosvenor family]] estate surveyor, and was drawn up with the original 1821 Wyatt plan for Belgravia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opensquares.org/detail/Wilton.html |title=Opensquares.org |publisher=Opensquares.org |accessdate=21 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822053711/http://www.opensquares.org/detail/Wilton.html |archive-date=22 August 2014 |url-status = dead}}</ref> It is named after the 2nd [[Earl of Wilton]], second son of the 1st Marquess of Westminster. The street was built in 1827 by William Howard Seth-Smith.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=1025}}

In the 19th and 20th centuries, it was home to many prominent British politicians, ambassadors and civil servants. [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] lived at No.&nbsp;2 for many years and [[Alfonso López Pumarejo]], twice [[List of Presidents of Colombia|President of Colombia]], lived and died at No.&nbsp;33 (which is marked by a [[blue plaque]]).{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=1025}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueplaqueplaces.co.uk/alfonso-lopez-pumarejo-blue-plaque-in-london-4356|title=Alfonso Lopez-Pumarejo blue plaque in London|publisher=Blue Plaques|accessdate=14 December 2017}}</ref>

Like much of Belgravia, Wilton Crescent has grand terraces with lavish white houses which are built in a crescent shape, many of them with stuccoed balconies, particularly in the southern part of the crescent. The houses to the north of the crescent are stone clad, and five storeys high, and were refaced between 1908 and 1912. Most of the houses had originally been built in the stucco style, but such houses became stone clad during this renovation period. Other houses today have black iron balconies.

Wilton Crescent lies east of [[Lowndes Square]] and Lowndes Street, to the northwest of [[Belgrave Square]]. It is accessed via [[Wilton Place]], constructed in 1825 to connect it to [[Knightsbridge]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=1025}} It is adjacent to [[Grosvenor Crescent]] to the east, which contains the Indonesian Embassy. Further to the east lies [[Buckingham Palace]]. The play ''[[Major Barbara (play)|Major Barbara]]'' is partly set at Lady Britomart's house in Wilton Crescent. In 2007, Wilton Garden, in the middle of the crescent, was awarded a bronze medal by the London Gardens Society.

===Lowndes Square===
[[File:Lowndes Street.jpg|thumb|right|Lowndes Street where it enters [[Lowndes Square]] (the trees to the right)]]

[[Lowndes Square]] is named after the [[Secretary to the Treasury]] [[William Lowndes (1652–1724)|William Lowndes]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=517}} Like much of Belgravia, it has grand terraces with white stucco houses. To the east lie Wilton Crescent and Belgrave Square. The square runs parallel with [[Sloane Street]] to the east, east of the [[Harvey Nichols]] department store and [[Knightsbridge tube station|Knightsbridge Underground station]]. It has some of the most expensive properties in the world. Russian businessman [[Roman Abramovich]] bought two stucco houses in Lowndes Square in 2008. The merged houses, with a total of eight bedrooms, are expected to be worth £150 million, which exceeds the value of the previous most expensive house in London.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/house-prices/7397939/Londons-Chester-Square-tops-list-of-Britains-priciest-addresses.html|title=London's 'Chester Square' tops list of Britain's priciest addresses|date=2010-03-08|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=2020-03-15|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

[[George Basevi]] designed many of the houses in the square. [[Mick Jagger]] and [[James Fox (actor)|James Fox]] once filmed in [[Leonard Plugge]]'s house in Lowndes Square. The square was used as a setting for the [[Edward Frederic Benson]] novel ''The Countess of Lowndes Square''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/countessoflownde00bens |title=The Countess of Lowndes square, and the stories : Benson, E.
