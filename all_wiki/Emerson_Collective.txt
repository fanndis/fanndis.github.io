==History==
Emerson Collective was founded in 2004 by Laurene Powell Jobs in [[Palo Alto, California]].<ref name="Overview" /> Named after [[transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] writer [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], the organization says its mission is to do [[Utilitarianism|the greatest amount of good for the greatest number]] of people.<ref name="About Us">{{cite web|title=Emerson Collective - About Us|url=https://www.emersoncollective.com/about-us|website=Emerson Collective|accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>

In 1997, Powell Jobs had founded the [[nonprofit organization]] College Track, a college completion program to combat the achievement gap among students of color.<ref name="The Quest of Laurene Powell Jobs" /> When Emerson Collective was established in 2004, grants and investments largely focused on the education sector. When Powell Jobs began learning more about the challenges plaguing immigrant students, particularly those whose undocumented status made it difficult to attend college, Emerson Collective broadened its portfolio to include immigration reform and advocacy.<ref name="The Quest of Laurene Powell Jobs" />

Powell Jobs and Emerson Collective were strong advocates of the creation of President [[Barack Obama]]’s [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA) program and have continued to push for permanent legislation to provide "Dreamers" with a path to citizenship.<ref name="Marie Claire">{{cite web|title=The Welcoming Committee|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/a22716448/laurene-powell-jobs-emerson-collective-immigration-reform/|website=[[Marie Claire]]|accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref> In October 2016, she wrote the article “Immigrants Fuel Innovation.
