'''BBC Radio 4''' is a radio station owned and operated by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC). A part of [[BBC Radio]], it broadcasts a wide variety of [[Talk radio|spoken-word programmes]] including news, drama, comedy, science and history from the BBC's headquarters at [[Broadcasting House]], [[London]]. It replaced the [[BBC Home Service]] in 1967.<ref name="history1960s">{{Cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/1960s.pdf|title=History of the BBC: 1960s}}</ref> The station controller is [[Mohit Bakaya]].<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2019/radio-controllers|title=BBC - Controllers for Pop Music, BBC Sounds and Radio 4 have been appointed - Media Centre|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

Radio 4 broadcasts throughout the UK, the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]] on [[FM broadcast band|FM]], [[Longwave|LW]] and [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] and is the second-most popular domestic radio station in the [[United Kingdom]] after [[BBC Radio 2]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/286892/uk-radio-stations-ranked-by-listeners-reached/|title=Radio stations ranked by listeners weekly UK 2018 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref> It can also be received in the eastern counties of [[Ireland]], the north of [[France]] and [[Northern Europe]]. It is also available through [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Sky (UK & Ireland)|Sky]], [[Virgin Media]] and on [[BBC Sounds]]. Its sister station, [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]], complements the main channel by broadcasting repeats from the Radio 4 archive, extended versions of Radio 4 programmes and supplements to series such as ''[[The Archers]]'' and ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''.

Radio 4 is notable for its news bulletins and programmes such as ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' and ''[[The World at One]]'', heralded on air by the [[Greenwich Time Signal]] "pips" or the chimes of [[Big Ben]]. The pips are only accurate on FM, LW, and MW; there is a delay on digital radio of three to five seconds and online up to twenty-three seconds. Radio 4 broadcasts the [[Shipping Forecast]] which, in August 2017, was 150 years old.<ref>{{cite news |title=Radio 4's Shipping Forecast reaches 150-years-old |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-41030909/radio-4-s-shipping-forecast-reaches-150-years-old |access-date=24 August 2017 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

Music and sport are the only fields that largely fall outside the station's remit. It broadcasts occasional concerts, and documentaries related to various forms of both [[popular music|popular]] and classical music, and the long-running music-based ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''. Prior to the creation of [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]] it broadcast sports-based features, notably ''[[Sport on Four]]'', and since the creation of [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] in 1994, the station has become the home of [[Test Match Special|ball-by-ball commentaries]] of most [[Test cricket]] matches played by England. The coverage is broadcast on [[longwave|long wave]]. Consequently, for around 70 days a year, listeners have to rely on FM broadcasts or increasingly DAB for mainstream Radio 4 broadcasts – the number relying solely on long wave is now a small minority. The cricket broadcasts take precedence over on-the-hour news bulletins, but not the [[Shipping Forecast]], carried since its move to long wave in 1978 because that can be received clearly at sea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/guide/weather/marine/shipping-forecast |title=Met Office Shipping Forecast key |publisher=Metoffice.gov.uk |date=11 February 2018 |accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref>

As well as news and drama, the station has a strong reputation for comedy, including experimental and [[alternative comedy]], [[List of BBC Radio 4 programmes#Comedy|many successful comedians and comedy shows]] first appearing on the station. Following the six o'clock news from Monday to Friday, the station normally broadcasts a thirty-minute comedy programme.

The station is available on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] in most of Great Britain, parts of Ireland and the north of France; [[longwave|LW]] throughout the UK and in parts of Northern Europe, and the Atlantic north of the [[Azores]] to about 20 degrees west; [[medium wave|MW]] in some areas; [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]]; Digital TV including [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Freesat]], [[Sky (UK & Ireland)|Sky]] and [[Virgin Media]], and on the Internet. Freesat, Sky and Virgin have a separate channel which broadcasts the Radio 4 LW output in mono, in addition to the FM output.

The station is the UK's national broadcaster in times of national emergency such as war, due to the wide coverage of the Droitwich signal: if all other radio stations were forced to close, it would carry on broadcasting.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

The longwave signal is part of the [[Royal Navy]]'s system of [[letters of last resort]]. In the event of a suspected catastrophic attack on Britain, [[Vanguard class submarine|submarine]] captains, in addition to other checks, check for a broadcast signal from Radio 4 on 198 longwave to verify the annihilation of organised society in Great Britain.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenbaum |first=Ron |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2208219/ |title=Nuclear apocalypse and the Letter of Last Resort |work=Slate Magazine |date=9 January 2009 |accessdate=19 March 2010}}</ref><ref>[https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/radio-silence-puts-subs-on-nuclear-1157478 "Radio silence puts subs on nuclear alert" 28 November 2003 Manchester Evening News] Retrieved 11 February 2018</ref><ref name="today facts">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/today_programme.shtml|author=BBC Press Office|title=The Today Programme|publisher=BBC|url-status=dead|archivedate=25 May 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525012132/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/today_programme.shtml|access-date=27 July 2010}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:R4logo.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.45|Logo of Radio 4 until 2007]]
{{See also|BBC Home Service}}
{{Further|Timeline of BBC Radio 4}}

The BBC Home Service was the predecessor of Radio 4 and broadcast between 1939 and 1967. It had [[regional variations]] and was broadcast on [[medium wave]] with a network of [[VHF]] FM transmitters being added from 1955. Radio 4 replaced it on 30 September 1967, when the BBC renamed many of its domestic radio stations,<ref name="history1960s" /> in response to the challenge of [[offshore radio]]. It moved to long wave in November 1978, taking over the 200&nbsp;kHz frequency (1500 metres) previously held by [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] - later moved to 198&nbsp;kHz as a result of [[Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975|international agreements]] aimed at avoiding interference (all UK MW/LW frequencies are divisible by 9). At this point, Radio 4 became available across all of the UK for the first time and the station officially became known as Radio 4 UK, a title that remained until September 1984.

For a time during the 1970s Radio 4 carried regional news bulletins Monday to Saturday. These were broadcast twice at breakfast, at lunchtime and at 5.55p.m. There were also programme variations for the parts of England not served by [[BBC Local Radio]] stations. These included ''[[Roundabout East Anglia]]'', a VHF opt-out of the ''Today'' programme broadcast from [[BBC East]]'s studios in Norwich each weekday from 6.45&nbsp;a.m. to 8.45&nbsp;a.m.<ref name="round">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/content/articles/2005/09/09/local_radio_25_years_book_feature.shtml|title=BBC Radio Norfolk's 25th anniversary|date=9 September 2005|accessdate=10 February 2012|publisher=BBC}}</ref> ''Roundabout East Anglia'' came to an end in mid-1980 ahead of the launch of [[BBC Radio Norfolk]].<ref name="round"/>

All regional news bulletins broadcast from BBC regional news bases around England ended in August 1980, apart from in the south west as until January 1983 there was no [[BBC Local Radio]] in the south west so these news bulletins and its weekday morning regional programme, ''[[Morning Sou'West]]'', continued to be broadcast from the BBC studios in Plymouth on VHF and on the Radio 4 medium wave Plymouth relay until 31 December 1982.

The launch of [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|Radio 5]] on 27 August 1990 saw the removal of [[Open University]], schools programming, children's programmes and the ''Study on 4''/''Options'' adult education slot from Radio 4's FM frequencies. Consequently, the full Radio 4 schedule became available on FM for the first time. However, adult educational and [[Open University]] programming returned to Radio 4 in 1994 when Radio 5 was closed to make way for the launch of [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] and were broadcast on Sunday evenings on longwave only.

Between 17 January 1991 and 2 March 1991 FM broadcasts were replaced by a continuous news service devoted to the [[Gulf War]], [[Radio 4 News FM]], with the main Radio 4 service being exclusively on longwave.

In September 1991 it was decided that the main Radio 4 service would be on FM as FM coverage had now extended to cover almost all of the UK - Radio 4 didn't become available on FM in much of Scotland and Wales until the early 1990s. Opt-outs were transferred to longwave: currently ''[[Test Match Special]]'', extra shipping forecasts, ''[[The Daily Service]]'' and ''[[Today in Parliament|Yesterday in Parliament]]''. Longwave very occasionally opts out at other times, such as to broadcast special services, the most recent being when [[Pope Benedict XVI]] [[Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom|visited Britain in 2010]].

== Programmes and schedules ==

=== Daily schedule ===
An online schedule page lists the running order of programmes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/schedule/ |title=Radio 4 Daily Schedule page |publisher=BBC |date=8 February 2010 |accessdate=19 March 2010}}</ref>

=== Production ===

Many programmes are pre-recorded. Programmes transmitted live include ''Today'', magazine programme ''Woman's Hour'', consumer affairs programme ''[[You and Yours]]'', and (often) the music, film, books, arts and culture programme ''[[Front Row (radio programme)|Front Row]]''. [[Continuity (broadcasting)|Continuity]] is managed from [[Broadcasting House]] with news bulletins, including the hourly summaries and longer programmes such as the ''Six O'Clock News'' and ''Midnight News'', and news programmes such as ''Today'', ''The World at One'' and ''PM'', which by early 2013 had returned to Broadcasting House after 15 years at [[BBC Television Centre]] in [[White City, London|White City]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/998847.stm |title=New era for Broadcasting House |work=BBC News |accessdate=19 March 2010 | date=31 October 2000 | location=London}}</ref> The news returning to Broadcasting House has also meant that newsreaders can provide cover for continuity, which regularly occurs at 23:00 each night and 16:00 on a Sunday. This has reduced the total number of continuity announcers required each day down from four to three.

The [[Greenwich Time Signal|Time Signal]], known as 'the pips', is broadcast every hour to herald the news bulletin, except at midnight and 18:00, where the chimes of [[Big Ben]] are played. There is no Greenwich Time Signal during the Saturday Afternoon Drama at 15:00 on Radio 4 on Saturdays either. Only pips broadcast on FM/MW/LW are accurate. On all digital platforms they are in delay by between 3 and 5 seconds and even longer online (up to 23 seconds).

=== Programmes ===
<!-- Please add programmes to [[List of BBC Radio 4 programmes]] -->
{{Main|List of BBC Radio 4 programmes}}

Radio 4 programmes cover a wide variety of genre including news and current affairs, history, culture, science, religion, arts, drama and light entertainment. A number of the programmes on Radio 4 take the form of a "magazine" show, featuring numerous small contributions over the course of the programme—''[[Woman's Hour]]'', ''[[From Our Own Correspondent]]'', ''[[You and Yours]]''. The rise of these magazine shows is primarily due to the work of [[Tony Whitby]], controller of Radio 4 from 1970 to 1975.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Life on Air: A History of Radio Four|first=David|last=Hendy|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199248810|year=2007|pages=78–79}}</ref>

The station hosts a number of long-running programmes, many of which have been broadcast for over 40 years.

Most programmes are available for four weeks after broadcast as streaming audio from Radio 4's ''listen again'' page<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/progs/listenagain.shtml |title=Radio 4: Listen Again |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 March 2010}}</ref> and via [[BBC iPlayer]]. A selection of programmes is also available as [[podcasts]] or [[download]]able audio files.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4 |title=Radio 4 – Downloading and Podcasting |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 March 2010}}</ref> Many comedy and drama programmes from the Radio 4 archives are rebroadcast on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] (formerly BBC Radio 7).

Due to the capacity limitations of DAB and increasing sport broadcasts on [[BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra]], BBC Radio 4 DAB has to reduce its bit rate most evenings, such that after 7p.m. its DAB output is usually in mono, even though many of its programmes are made in stereo (including its flagship drama "The Archers"), these can be heard in stereo only on FM, Digital TV on Freeview & Freesat (Ch. 704), Sky, Virgin and on line via BBC iPlayer radio. BBC World Service, which uses BBC Radio 4 FM & DAB frequencies between 01:00 and 05:20, is in stereo, but only on Radio 4 FM & DAB and not on its own dedicated DAB channel. BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcasts in mono on DAB, but has always been in stereo on Digital TV (Freeview / Freesat Ch 708), Sky, Virgin and online.

== Notable continuity announcers and newsreaders ==

Announcers carry out the following duties from Broadcasting House:
* Provide links (or junctions) between programmes
* Read trails for programmes
* Provide reassurance to listeners during a programme breakdown
* Read the [[Shipping Forecast]] (except the 05:20 broadcast, which is covered by [[BBC Weather]])
* Read the [[BBC Radio 3]] news summaries at 13:00, 17:00 and 18:00 on weekdays

== Criticisms ==

Criticisms voiced by centre-right newspapers in recent years have a perceived left political bias across a range of issues.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/yourview/1541751/Is-Radio-4-alienating-its-core-audience.html |title=Is Radio 4 alienating its core audience? |newspaper=The Telegraph|date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=11 February 2018 | location=London | first=Tracy | last=Fisk}}</ref><ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1942948.ece BBC report damns its ‘culture of bias’ – Times Online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826050754/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1942948.ece |date=26 August 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Leonard |first=Tom |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3633619/The-BBCs-commitment-to-bias-is-no-laughing-matter.html |title=The BBC's commitment to bias is no laughing matter |newspaper=The Telegraph|date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=11 February 2018 | location=London}}</ref> as well as [[sycophancy]] in interviews, particularly on the popular morning news magazine ''Today''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/stephen-pollard-i-dont-want-bias-with-my-cornflakes-92101.html |title=Stephen Pollard: I don't want bias with my cornflakes&nbsp;— Commentators, Opinion |work=The Independent |date=20 October 2003 |accessdate=11 February 2018 | location=London}}</ref> as part of a reported perception of a general "malaise" at the BBC. Conversely, the journalist [[Mehdi Hasan]] has criticised the station for an overtly "[[social conservatism|socially]] and [[cultural conservatism|culturally]] conservative" approach.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2009/08/mehdi-hasan-bbc-wing-bias-corporation|title=Bias and the Beeb|last=Hasan|first=Mehdi|date=27 August 2009|work=New Statesman |accessdate=5 November 2009}}</ref>

There has been criticism of ''Today'' in particular for a lack of female broadcasters.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10182986/Another-woman-on-Radio-4s-Today-programme-The-BBC-aint-joking.html|title=Another woman on Radio 4's Today programme? The BBC ain't joking|first=Emma|last=Barnett|date=16 July 2013|accessdate=4 January 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph|location=London}}</ref> In September 1972, Radio 4 employed the first female continuity announcers—Hylda Bamber and Barbara Edwards (an event which caused the ''Daily Mail'' to proclaim that Radio 4 had "fallen" to women's liberation). For quite some time, the introduction of female newsreaders led to complaints from listeners; women discussing topics of feminist interest led to similar complaints.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Life on Air: A History of Radio Four|first=David|last=Hendy|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199248810|year=2007|pages=99–100}}</ref> In addition, there has been long-running criticism by atheist and humanist groups of ''Thought for the Day'', a slot dedicated exclusively to religious discussion during Radio 4's flagship morning news programme.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sherwood |first1=Harriet |title=BBC faces renewed calls to open Thought for the Day to atheists |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/nov/13/bbc-faces-renewed-calls-open-thought-for-the-day-atheists-sandi-toksvig |accessdate=31 October 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=13 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Davies |first1=Gareth |title=Radio 4's Thought for the Day should be scrapped because it is discriminatory, says John Humphrys |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/02/thought-day-should-scrapped-discriminatory-says-john-humphrys |accessdate=31 October 2020 |work=The Telegraph |date=2 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=BBC once more rejects non-religious voices on Thought for the Day |url=https://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2013/07/bbc-once-more-rejects-non-religious-voices-on-thought-for-the-day |website=National Secular Society |accessdate=31 October 2020 |date=3 July 2013}}</ref>

Radio 4 has been criticised for being too [[middle class]] and being of little interest to non-white listeners.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8279381/BBC-Radio-4-too-middle-class-and-London-centric.html|title=BBC Radio 4 'too middle class and London-centric'|first=Neil|last=Midgley|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=8 February 2011|accessdate=4 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/feb/22/amibovveredthatradio4is|title=Am I bovvered that Radio 4 is too middle class?
