==History==
In 1897, the [[Van Noy Brothers]] of [[Kansas City, Missouri]], formed [[Van Noy Railway News and Hotel Company]] to operate news stands along the [[Missouri Pacific]] and other regional railroads. The company later expanded to various [[hospitality]] services, including hotels. After several name and business changes it became the Host International Company in 1968. It became part of [[Marriott Corporation]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/05/business/marriott-offers-to-buy-gino-s.html | title=Marriott Offers To Buy Gino's | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 5, 1982 | url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1981/12/21/the-marriott-snack-attack/b24bfbfc-a3d7-453b-b096-e9460b1ffd39/ | title=The Marriott 'Snack Attack' | first=William H. | last=Jones | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=December 21, 1981 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> Eleven years later Marriot divided its business into two companies, naming one Host Marriott.<ref name=unit>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/10/business/host-marriott-to-separate-concessions-unit-from-hotel-holdings.html | title=Host Marriott to Separate Concessions Unit From Hotel Holdings | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=August 10, 1995 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> The new company, much like its predecessor, continued to manage travel concessions at airports and along interstate highways.
