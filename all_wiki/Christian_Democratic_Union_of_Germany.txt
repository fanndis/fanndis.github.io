[[Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer]] has been leader of the CDU since December 2018. On 10 February 2020, she announced her resignation, but will remain as leader until a successor is elected.<ref name="auto"/> The CDU is the largest party in the [[Bundestag]], the German federal legislature, 200 out of 709 seats, having won 26.8% of votes in the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]]. It forms the [[CDU/CSU]] [[Bundestag]] faction, also known as the Union, with its Bavarian counterpart the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]] (CSU). The group's parliamentary leader is [[Ralph Brinkhaus]], a member of the CDU.

Founded in 1945 as an interdenominational Christian party, the CDU effectively succeeded the pre-war Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], with many former members joining the party, including its first leader [[Konrad Adenauer]]. The party also included politicians of other backgrounds, including liberals and conservatives.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Martin Seeleib-Kaiser |author2=Silke Van Dyk |author3=Martin Roggenkamp |title=Party Politics and Social Welfare: Comparing Christian and Social Democracy in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands |page=10 |publisher=Edward Elgar |year=2008}}</ref> As a result, the party claims to represent "Christian-social, liberal and conservative" elements.<ref>{{cite book |author=Sven-Uwe Schmitz |title=Konservatismus |publisher=VS Verlag |year=2009 |page=142}}</ref> The CDU is generally [[pro-European]] in outlook.<ref>{{cite news |author=Janosch Delcker |title=Where German parties stand on Europe |newspaper=Politico |date=28 August 2017 |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-parties-plan-for-eu-in-election-campaign/}}</ref> [[Black]] is the party's customary colour.

The CDU has headed the [[Cabinet of Germany|federal government]] since 2005 under [[Angela Merkel]], who also served as the party's leader from 2000 until 2018. The CDU previously led the federal government from 1949 to 1969 and 1982 to 1998. Germany's three longest-serving post-war Chancellors have all come from the CDU; [[Helmut Kohl]] (1982–1998), Angela Merkel (2005–present), and Konrad Adenauer (1949–1963). The party also leads the governments of six of Germany's sixteen [[States of Germany|states]].

The CDU is a member of the [[Centrist Democrat International]], the [[International Democrat Union]] and the [[European People's Party]] (EPP). It is the largest party in the EPP with 23 [[MEPs]]. [[Ursula von der Leyen]], the current [[President of the European Commission]], is a member of the CDU.

== History ==
=== Founding period ===
[[File:KAS-Bolschewistische Bedrohung-Bild-11-3.jpg|thumb|1949 election poster of the CDU reading "The Rescue: CDU"]]
Immediately following the end of [[World War II]] and the foreign occupation of Germany simultaneous yet unrelated meetings began occurring throughout the country, each with the intention of planning a Christian-democratic party. The CDU was established in [[Berlin]] on 26 June 1945 and in [[Rheinland]] and [[Westfalen]] in September of the same year.

The founding members of the CDU consisted primarily of former members of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], the [[German Democratic Party]], the [[German National People's Party]] and the [[German People's Party]]. Many of these individuals, including CDU-Berlin founder [[Andreas Hermes]], were imprisoned for the involvement in the [[German Resistance]] during the Nazi dictatorship. In the [[Cold War]] years after World War II up to the 1960s (see ''[[Vergangenheitsbewältigung]]''), the CDU also attracted [[Conservatism in Germany|conservative]], [[anti-communist]] former [[Nazis]] and [[Nazi collaborators]] into its higher ranks (like [[Hans Globke]] and [[Theodor Oberländer]]). A prominent anti-Nazi member was theologian [[Eugen Gerstenmaier]], who became Acting Chairman of the Foreign Board (1949–1969).

One of the lessons learned from the failure of the [[Weimar Republic]] was that disunity among the democratic parties ultimately allowed for the rise of the [[Nazi Party]]. It was therefore crucial to create a unified party of Christian democrats – a Christian Democratic Union. The result of these meetings was the establishment of an inter-confessional ([[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] alike) party influenced heavily by the political tradition of [[liberal conservatism]]. The CDU experienced considerable success gaining support from the time of its creation in Berlin on 26 June 1945 until its first [[Political convention|convention]] on 21 October 1950, at which Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] was named the first [[Chairman]] of the party.

=== Adenauer era (1949–1963) ===
[[File:CDU Wahlkampfplakat - kaspl019.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The election poster of 1957 reading "No experiments" and featuring then Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] (this was the only election in which the CDU obtained an absolute majority)]]
In the beginning, it was not clear which party would be favored by the victors of [[World War II]], but by the end of the 1940s the governments of the United States and of Britain began to lean toward the CDU and away from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). The latter was more [[nationalist]] and sought [[German reunification]] even at the expense of concessions to the [[Soviet Union]], depicting Adenauer as an instrument of both the Americans and the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. The Western powers appreciated the CDU's moderation, its economic flexibility and its value as an oppositional force to the communists which appealed to European voters at the time. Adenauer was also trusted by the British.<ref name=gottfried>Paul Gottfried (fall 2007). "The Rise and Fall of Christian Democracy in Europe". ''Orbis''.</ref>

The party was split over issues of rearmament within the Western alliance and German unification as a neutral state. Adenauer staunchly defended his pro-Western position and outmanoeuvred some of his opponents. He also refused to consider the SPD as a party of the coalition until he felt sure that they shared his anti-communist position. The principled rejection of a reunification that would alienate Germany from the Western alliance made it harder to attract Protestant voters to the party as most refugees from the former German territories east of the Oder were of that faith as were the majority of the inhabitants of [[East Germany]].<ref name=gottfried/>

The CDU was the dominant party for the first two decades following the establishment of [[West Germany]] in 1949. Adenauer remained the party's leader until 1963, at which point the former minister of economics [[Ludwig Erhard]] replaced him.<ref>{{cite news |title=Konrad Adenauer (1876–1967) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/adenauer_konrad.shtml |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref> As the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) withdrew from the governing coalition in 1966 due to disagreements over fiscal and economic policy, Erhard was forced to resign. Consequently, a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] with the SPD took over government under CDU Chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]].

=== Opposition against social-liberal governments (1969–1982) ===
The SPD quickly gained popularity and succeeded in forming a [[social-liberal coalition]] with the FDP following the [[1969 West German federal election|1969 federal election]], forcing the CDU out of power for the first time in its history. The CDU and CSU were highly critical of Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s "change through rapprochement" policy towards the Eastern bloc ''([[Ostpolitik]])'' and protested sharply against the 1970 [[Treaty of Moscow (1970)|treaties of Moscow]] and [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Warsaw]] that renounced claims to the [[former eastern territories of Germany]] and recognised the [[Oder–Neisse line]] as Germany's eastern border. The Union parties had close ties with the ''[[Heimatvertriebene]]'' [[Federation of Expellees|associations]] (Germans who fled or were expelled from the eastern territories) who hoped for a return of these territories. Seven Bundestag members, including former vice chancellor [[Erich Mende]], defected from the FDP and SPD to the CDU in protest against these treaties, depriving Brandt of his majority, and providing a thin majority for the CDU and CSU. In April 1972 the CDU saw its chance to return to power, calling a [[constructive vote of no confidence]]. CDU chairman [[Rainer Barzel]] was almost certain to become the new Chancellor. But not all parliamentarians voted as expected (it was later revealed that two CDU/CSU deputies had been bribed by the East German [[Stasi]]): Brandt won the vote and stayed in office. Thus, the CDU continued its role as [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] for a total of thirteen years. In 1982, the FDP withdrew from the coalition with the SPD and allowed the CDU to regain power.

=== Kohl era (1982–1998) ===
CDU Chairman [[Helmut Kohl]] became the new Chancellor of West Germany and his CDU/CSU–FDP coalition was confirmed in the [[1983 West German federal election|1983 federal election]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0518-028, Staatsvertrag BRD-DDR, Helmut Kohl, Lothar de Maizière.jpg|thumb|East German CDU leader [[Lothar de Maizière]] (left) with West German CDU leader Helmut Kohl in September 1990]]
After the [[Die Wende|collapse]] of the East German government in 1989, Kohl—supported by the governments of the United States and [[German reunification#Britain and France|reluctantly]] by those of France and the United Kingdom—called for German reunification. On 3 October 1990, the government of East Germany was abolished and its territory acceded to the scope of the Basic Law already in place in West Germany. The [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|East German CDU]] merged with its West German counterpart and elections were held for the reunified country. Public support for the coalition's work in the process of German reunification was reiterated in the [[1990 German federal election|1990 federal election]] in which the CDU–FDP governing coalition experienced a clear victory. Although Kohl was re-elected, the party began losing much of its popularity because of an economic recession in the former GDR and increased taxes in the west. The CDU was nonetheless able to win the [[1994 German federal election|1994 federal election]] by a narrow margin due to an economic recovery.

Kohl served as chairman until the party's electoral defeat in 1998, when he was succeeded by [[Wolfgang Schäuble]]. Schäuble resigned in early 2000 as a result of a party [[1999 CDU contributions scandal|financing scandal]] and was replaced by [[Angela Merkel]], who remained the leader of the CDU until 2018. In the [[1998 German federal election|1998 federal election]] the CDU polled 28.4% and the CSU 6.7% of the national vote, the lowest result for those parties since 1949; a [[Red–green alliance|red–green coalition]] under the leadership of [[Gerhard Schröder]] took power until 2005. In the [[2002 German federal election|2002 federal election]], the CDU and CSU polled slightly higher (29.5% and 9.0%, respectively), but still lacked the majority needed for a CDU–FDP coalition government.

=== Merkel era (2000–2018) ===
[[File:Angela Merkel CDU Parteitag 2014 by Olaf Kosinsky-25.jpg|thumb|[[Angela Merkel]]]]
In 2005, early elections were called after the CDU dealt the governing SPD a major blow, winning more than ten state elections, most of which were [[List of landslide victories|landslide victories]]. The resulting grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and the SPD faced a serious challenge stemming from both parties' demand for the chancellorship. After three weeks of negotiations, the two parties reached a deal whereby CDU received the chancellorship while the SPD retained 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet and a majority of the most prestigious cabinet posts.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4325600.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Merkel named as German chancellor |date=10 October 2005 |accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> The coalition deal was approved by both parties at party conferences on 14 November.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4434812.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=German parties back new coalition |date=14 November 2005 |accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> Merkel was confirmed as the first female Chancellor of Germany by the majority of delegates (397 to 217) in the newly assembled Bundestag on 22 November.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4458430.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Merkel becomes German chancellor |date=22 November 2005 |accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref> Since her first term in office, from 2005 to 2009, there have been discussions if the CDU was still "sufficiently conservative" or if it was "social-democratising".<ref>{{cite book |author=Melanie Haas |title=Die CDU in der großen Koalition zwischen 2005 und 2007 |editor=Ralf Thomas Baus |work=Zur Zukunft der Volksparteien: Das Parteiensystem untr den Bedingungen zunehmender Fragmentierung |publisher=Konrad Adenauer Foundation |year=2009 |page=20}}</ref> In March 2009, Merkel answered with the statement "Sometimes I am liberal, sometimes I am conservative, sometimes I am Christian-social—and this is what defines the CDU."<ref>"Mal bin ich liberal, mal bin ich konservativ, mal bin ich christlich-sozial – und das macht die CDU aus".

Although the CDU and CSU lost support in the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal elections]], their "desired partner" the FDP experienced the best election cycle in its history, thereby enabling a CDU/CSU–FDP coalition. This marked the first change of coalition partner by a Chancellor in German history and the first centre-right coalition government since 1998. CDU candidate [[Christian Wulff]] won the [[2010 German presidential election|2010 presidential election]] in the third ballot, while opposition candidate [[Joachim Gauck]] (a Protestant pastor and former anti-communist activist in East Germany, who was favoured even by some CDU members) received a number of "faithless" votes from the government camp.

The decisions to suspend conscription (late 2010) and to phase out nuclear energy (shortly after the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]] in 2011) broke with long-term principles of the CDU, moving the party into a more socially liberal direction and alienating some of its more conservative members and voters. At its November 2011 conference the party proposed a "wage floor", after having expressly rejected minimum wages during the previous years.<ref name="Zolleis15_81">{{cite book |author=Udo Zolleis |title=Auf die Kanzlerin kommt es an: Die CDU unter Angela Merkel |editor1=Reimut Zohlnhöfer |editor2=Thomas Saalfeld |work=Politik im Schatten der Krise: Eine Bilanz der Regierung Merkel 2009–2013 |publisher=Springer VS |year=2015 |pages=81–83}}</ref> Psephologist and Merkel advisor Matthias Jung coined the term "asymmetric demobilisation" for the CDU's strategy (practised in the 2009, 2013 and 2017 campaigns)<ref>{{cite book |author=Christina Holtz-Bacha |title=Bundestagswahl 2017: Flauer Wahlkampf?

President Wulff resigned in February 2012 due to allegations of corruption, triggering an [[2012 German presidential election|early presidential election]]. This time the CDU supported, reluctantly, nonpartisan candidate Joachim Gauck. The CDU/CSU–FDP coalition lasted until the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal election]], when the FDP lost all its seats in the Bundestag while the CDU and CSU won their best result since 1990, only a few seats short of an absolute majority. This was partly due to the CDU's expansion of voter base to all socio-structural groups (class, age or gender), partly due to the personal popularity of Chancellor Merkel.<ref>{{cite book |author=Petra Hemmelmann |title=Der Kompass der CDU: Analyse der Grundsatz- und Wahlprogramme von Adenauer bis Merkel |publisher=Springer VS |year=2017 |page=162}}</ref> After talks with the Greens had failed, the CDU/CSU formed a new grand coalition with the SPD.

In October 2018, Merkel announced that she would step down as leader of the CDU that December, but wanted to remain as Chancellor until 2021.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46020745 |title=Angela Merkel to step down in 2021 |date=29 October 2018 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

=== Post-Merkel (2018–present) ===
On 7 December 2018, [[Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer]] was elected as the new party leader of the CDU in the [[2018 Christian Democratic Union of Germany leadership election|leadership election]].

Kramp-Karrenbauer opposes [[same sex marriage]], having compared it to [[incest]] and [[polygamy]], and supports [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] policies.

Kramp Karrenbauer resigned as party leader on 10 February 2020, after the CDU in the German state of [[Thuringia]] cooperated with the [[Alternative für Deutschland]] (AfD) in order to prevent the election of a left-wing Thuringian Prime Minister. This cooperation violated a political taboo in German politics of cooperating with political parties viewed as too far-right. Media reported her inability to enforce party discipline, which according to her was complicated by the unclear positions of some CDU members towards the parties of the right-wing AfD and the leftist [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]], as a reason for her resignation. She will continue as Minister of Defence while a new party leader is expected to be [[2021 Christian Democratic Union of Germany leadership election|elected]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/merkel-heir-kramp-karrenbauer-resigns-reports/|title=Merkel heir Kramp-Karrenbauer to step down as CDU leader|date=10 February 2020|website=POLITICO}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/germany-angela-merkels-cdu-to-decide-new-leader-on-april-25/a-52498552|title=Germany: Angela Merkel's CDU to decide new leader on April 25 &#124; DW &#124; 24.02.2020|website=DW.COM}}</ref>

While Adenauer and Erhard co-operated with non-Nazi parties to their right, the CDU has later worked to marginalize its [[right-wing]] opposition. The loss of [[anti-communism]] as a political theme, [[secularization]] and the [[Culture war|cultural revolutions in West Germany]] occurring since the 1960s have challenged the viability of the CDU.

In her 2005 campaign, [[Angela Merkel]] was unwilling to express explicitly Christian views while maintaining that her party had never lost its concept of values. Merkel and Bundestag President [[Norbert Lammert]] have been keen to clarify that CDU references to the "dominant culture" imply "tolerance and living together".<ref name=gottfried /> According to party analyst Stephan Eisel, her avoiding the values-issue may have had the opposite effect as she failed to mobilize the party's core constituency.<ref>Stefan Eisel: [http://www.kas.de/wf/de/33.7688/ Reale Regierungsopposition gegen gefühlte Oppositionsregierung] ''Die Politische Meinung,'' Dezember 2005.</ref>

The CDU applies the principles of [[Christian democracy]] and emphasizes the "Christian understanding of humans and their responsibility toward God". However, CDU membership consists of people adhering to a variety of religions as well as non-religious individuals. The CDU's policies derive from [[political Catholicism]], [[Catholic social teaching]] and political [[Protestantism]] as well as [[economic liberalism]] and [[national conservatism]]. The party has adopted more [[Economic liberalism|liberal economic]] policies since [[Helmut Kohl]]'s term in office as the Chancellor of Germany (1982–1998).

As a [[Conservatism in Germany|conservative]] party, the CDU supports stronger punishments of crimes and involvement on the part of the [[Bundeswehr]] in cases of domestic [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorism]] offensives. In terms of immigrants, the CDU supports initiatives to integrate immigrants through language courses and aims to further control immigration. [[Multiple citizenship|Dual citizenship]] should only be allowed in exceptional cases.

In terms of foreign policy, the CDU commits itself to [[European integration]] and a strong [[Germany–United States relations|relation with the United States]]. In the [[European Union]], the party opposes the entry of [[Turkey]], preferring instead a privileged partnership. In addition to citing various human rights violations, the CDU also believes that Turkey's unwillingness to recognise [[Cyprus]] as an independent sovereign state contradicts the European Union policy that its members must recognise the existence of one another.

The CDU has governed in four federal-level and numerous state-level [[grand coalition (Germany)|Grand Coalitions]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) as well as in state and local-level coalitions with the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]]. 
The CDU has an official party congress adjudication that prohibits coalitions and any sort of cooperation with either [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] or the [[Alternative for Germany]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdu.de/artikel/praesidium-und-bundesvorstand-der-cdu-deutschlands-zum-tod-von-walter-luebcke|title=Präsidium und Bundesvorstand der CDU Deutschlands zum Tod von Walter Lübcke|date=24 June 2019|website=Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands}}</ref>

=== Members ===
Before 1966, membership totals in CDU organisation were only estimated. The numbers after 1966 are based on the total from 31 December of the previous year. In 2018, the CDU had 420,240 members.<ref>Andrea Shalal (26 July 2018).

=== Relationship to the CSU ===<!-- This section is linked from Angela Merkel. -->
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2013}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F074010-0033, Köln, Deutschlandtag Junge Union.jpg|thumb|1986 Germany Day of [[Junge Union]] in Cologne]]
Both the CDU and the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]] (CSU) originated after World War II, sharing a concern for the Christian worldview. In the Bundestag, the CDU is represented in a common faction with the CSU. This faction is called [[CDU/CSU]], or informally the Union. Its basis is a binding agreement known as a ''Fraktionsvertrag'' between the two parties.

The CDU and CSU share a common youth organisation, the [[Junge Union]], a common pupil organisation, the {{interlanguage link|Schüler Union Deutschlands|de|Schüler Union Deutschlands}}, a common student organisation, the [[Ring Christlich-Demokratischer Studenten]] and a common ''[[Mittelstand]]'' organisation, the {{interlanguage link|Mittelstands- und Wirtschaftsvereinigung|de|Mittelstands- und Wirtschaftsvereinigung}}.

The CDU and CSU are legally and organisationally separate parties; their ideological differences are sometimes a source of conflict. The most notable and serious such incident was in 1976, when the CSU under [[Franz Josef Strauß]] ended the alliance with the CDU at a party conference in Wildbad Kreuth. This decision was reversed shortly thereafter when the CDU threatened to run candidates against the CSU in Bavaria.

The relationship of CDU to the CSU has historic parallels to previous [[Christian-democratic]] parties in Germany, with the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] having served as a national Catholic party throughout the [[German Empire]] and the [[Weimar Republic]] while the [[Bavarian People's Party]] functioning as the Bavarian variant. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Since its formation, the CSU has been more [[conservative]] than the CDU. The CSU and the state of Bavaria decided not to sign the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] as they insisted on more autonomy for the individual [[States of Germany|states]].<ref>Dieter Wunderlich (2006). [http://www.dieterwunderlich.de/bundesrepublik_deutschland.htm "Gründung der Bundesrepublik Deutschland"]. Retrieved 23 September 2013.</ref> The CSU and the free state of Bavaria have a separate police and justice system (distinctive and non-federal) and have actively participated in all political affairs of the Bundestag, the German government, the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], the parliamentary elections of the German President, the European Parliament and meetings with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in Russia.

=== Konrad Adenauer Foundation ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F053560-0013, Rhöndorf, Sitzung Stiftung Adenauer-Haus.jpg|thumb|1978 conference in [[Rhöndorf]] with eminent historian [[Golo Mann]] (center)]]
The [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] is the think-tank of the CDU. It is named after the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany and first president of the CDU. The foundation offers political education, conducts scientific fact-finding research for political projects, grants scholarships to gifted individuals, researches the history of [[Christian democracy]] and supports and encourages [[European integration|European unification]], international understanding and development-policy cooperation. Its annual budget amounts to around 120 million euro and is mostly funded by taxpayer money.<ref>[http://www.kas.de/upload/dokumente/jahresbericht2010/Namen.pdf "2010 Annual Report"] (in German). p. 93.</ref>

=== Special organizations ===
Notable suborganisations of the CDU are the following:
* [[Junge Union]] (JU), the common youth organisation of the CDU and the CSU.
* [[Christian Democratic Employees' Association]] (CDA), a traditionally leftist association representing Christian-democratic wage earners.
* [[Evangelical Working Group of the CDU/CSU]] (EAK, together with the CSU), representing the Protestant minority in the party.
* [[Association of Christian Democratic Students]] (RCDS), the student organisation of the party.
* {{interlanguage link|Lesbian and Gay Members of the Union|de|Lesben und Schwule in der Union}} (LSU), representing LGBT+ members of the CDU.
