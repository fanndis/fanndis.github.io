A '''mobile application''', also referred to as a '''mobile app''' or simply an '''app''', is a [[computer program]] or [[software application]] designed to run on a [[mobile device]] such as a [[smartphone|phone]], [[tablet computer|tablet]], or [[smartwatch|watch]]. Apps were originally intended for productivity assistance such as email, calendar, and contact databases, but the public demand for apps caused rapid expansion into other areas such as [[mobile games]], factory automation, GPS and [[location-based services]], order-tracking, and ticket purchases, so that there are now millions of apps available. Apps are generally downloaded from application distribution platforms which are operated by the owner of the [[mobile operating system]], such as the [[App Store (iOS)]] or [[Google Play Store]]. Some apps are free, and others have a price, with the profit being split between the application's creator and the distribution platform. Mobile applications often stand in contrast to [[desktop application]]s which are designed to run on [[desktop computer]]s, and [[web application]]s which run in [[mobile web browser]]s rather than directly on the mobile device.

In 2009, technology columnist [[David Pogue]] stated that smartphones could be nicknamed "app phones" to distinguish them from earlier less-sophisticated smartphones.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/technology/personaltech/05pogue.html?pagewanted=all|title=A Place to Put Your Apps|last=Pogue|first=David|date=November 4, 2009|work=New York Times|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref> The term "app", short for "software application", has since become very popular; in 2010, it was listed as "[[Word of the Year]]" by the [[American Dialect Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americandialect.org/app-voted-2010-word-of-the-year-by-the-american-dialect-society-updated |title="App" voted 2010 word of the year by the American Dialect Society (UPDATED) American Dialect Society |publisher=Americandialect.org |date=2011-01-08 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}</ref>

==Overview==
Most mobile devices are sold with several apps bundled as pre-installed software, such as a [[web browser]], [[email client]], [[Calendaring software|calendar]], mapping program, and an app for [[Mobile music|buying music]], other media, or more apps. Some pre-installed apps can be removed by an ordinary uninstall process, thus leaving more storage space for desired ones. Where the software does not allow this, some devices can be [[Rooting (Android OS)|rooted]] to eliminate the undesired apps.

Apps that are not preinstalled are usually available through distribution platforms called [[app store]]s. They began appearing in 2008 and are typically operated by the owner of the [[mobile operating system]], such as the Apple [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], [[Google Play]], [[Windows Phone Store]], and [[BlackBerry App World]]. However, there are independent app stores, such as [[Cydia]], [[GetJar]] and [[F-Droid]]. Some apps are free, while others must be bought. Usually, they are downloaded from the platform to a target device, but sometimes they can be downloaded to [[laptop]]s or [[desktop computer]]s. For apps with a price, generally a percentage, 20-30%, goes to the distribution provider (such as [[iTunes]]), and the rest goes to the producer of the app.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2008/06/11/analyst-theres-a-great-future-in-iphone-apps/ |title=Analyst: There's a great future in iPhone apps |last=Siegler |first=MG |work=Venture Beat |date=June 11, 2008}}</ref> The same app can, therefore, cost a different price depending on the mobile platform.

Apps can also be installed manually, for example by running an [[Android application package]] on Android devices.

Mobile apps were originally offered for general productivity and information retrieval, including email, [[electronic calendar|calendar]], contacts, the stock market and weather information. However, public demand and the availability of developer tools drove rapid expansion into other categories, such as those handled by desktop [[application software]] packages. As with other software, the explosion in number and variety of apps made discovery a challenge, which in turn led to the creation of a wide range of review, recommendation, and curation sources, including blogs, magazines, and dedicated online app-discovery services. In 2014 government regulatory agencies began trying to regulate and curate apps, particularly medical apps.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C3LC51235E |pmid=24425070 |title=The regulation of mobile medical applications |journal=Lab on a Chip |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=833–40 |year=2014 |last1=Yetisen |first1=Ali Kemal |last2=Martinez-Hurtado |first2=J.

== Types ==
Mobile applications may be classified by numerous methods. A common scheme is to distinguish native, hybrid, and web-based apps.

=== Native app===
All apps targeted toward a particular mobile platform are known as native apps. Therefore, an app intended for [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] device does not run in [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. As a result, most businesses develop apps for multiple platforms.

While developing native apps, professionals incorporate best-in-class user interface modules. This accounts for better performance, consistency and good user experience. Users also benefit from wider access to [[application programming interface]]s and make limitless use of all apps from the particular device. Further, they also switch over from one app to another effortlessly.

The main purpose for creating such apps is to ensure best performance for a specific mobile operating system.

=== Hybrid app ===
The concept of the hybrid app is a mix of native and web-based apps. Apps developed using [[Apache Cordova]], Xamarin, React Native, Sencha Touch and other similar technology fall into this category.

These are made to support web and native technologies across multiple platforms. Moreover, these apps are easier and faster to develop. It involves use of single code base which works in multiple mobile operating systems.

Despite such advantages, hybrid apps exhibit lower performance. Often, apps fail to bear the same look-and-feel in different mobile operating systems.

=== Web-based app ===
A web-based app is coded in [[HTML5]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] or [[JavaScript]]. Internet access is required for proper behavior and user-experience of this group of apps.

These apps may capture minimum memory space in user devices compared to native and hybrid apps. Since all the personal databases are saved on the Internet servers, users can fetch their desired data from any device through the Internet.

==Development==
{{Main|Mobile application development}}
[[File:Mistory - Demola, 2015.05.22 (5).JPG|thumb|Developers at work]]
Developing apps for mobile devices requires considering the constraints and features of these devices. Mobile devices run on battery and have less powerful [[CPU|processors]] than personal computers and also have more features such as [[Mobile phone tracking|location detection]] and cameras. Developers also have to consider a wide array of screen sizes, hardware specifications and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms (although these issues can be overcome with mobile device detection).

Mobile application development requires the use of specialized [[integrated development environment]]s. Mobile apps are first tested within the development environment using [[emulator]]s and later subjected to field testing. Emulators provide an inexpensive way to test applications on mobile phones to which developers may not have physical access.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gao|first=J.|last2=Bai|first2=X.|last3=Tsai|first3=W.|last4=Uehara|first4=T.|date=February 2014|title=Mobile Application Testing: A Tutorial|journal=Computer|volume=47|issue=2|pages=46–55|doi=10.1109/MC.2013.445|issn=0018-9162}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Mobile [[user interface]] (UI) Design is also essential. Mobile UI considers constraints and contexts, screen, input and mobility as outlines for design. The user is often the focus of interaction with their device, and the interface entails components of both hardware and software. User input allows for the users to manipulate a system, and device's output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation. Mobile UI design constraints include limited attention and form factors, such as a mobile device's screen size for a user's hand. Mobile UI contexts signal cues from user activity, such as location and scheduling that can be shown from user interactions within a mobile application. Overall, mobile UI design's goal is primarily for an understandable, user-friendly interface.

Mobile UIs, or front-ends, rely on mobile back-ends to support access to enterprise systems.  The mobile back-end facilitates data routing, security, authentication, authorization, working off-line, and service orchestration. This functionality is supported by a mix of [[middleware]] components including [[Mobile App Server|mobile app servers]], [[Mobile Backend as a service]] (MBaaS), and [[service-oriented architecture|SOA]] infrastructure.

Conversational interfaces display the computer interface and present interactions through text instead of graphic elements. They emulate conversations with real humans.<ref name="Fastcodesign">{{cite web|last1=Brownlee|first1=John|title=Conversational Interfaces, Explained|url=https://www.fastcodesign.com/3058546/conversational-interfaces-explained|website=Fast Co. Design|publisher=Fast Company Inc.|accessdate=July 4, 2016}}</ref> There are two main types of conversational interfaces: voice assistants (like the [[Amazon Echo]]) and [[Chatterbot|chatbots]].<ref name="Fastcodesign" />

==Enterprise management==
{{Main|Mobile application management}}
Mobile application management (MAM) describes software and services responsible for [[provisioning]] and controlling access to internally developed and commercially available mobile apps used in business settings. The strategy is meant to off-set the security risk of a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) work strategy. When an employee brings a personal device into an enterprise setting, mobile application management enables the corporate IT staff to transfer required applications, control access to business data, and remove locally cached business data from the device if it is lost, or when its owner no longer works with the company. [[Operating-system-level virtualization|Containerization]] is an alternate BYOD security solution. Rather than controlling an employees entire device, containerization apps create isolated and secure pockets separate from all personal data. Company control of the device only extends to that separate container.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taware|first1=Varun|title=Containerization is a winning strategy for smarter BYOD management|url=http://betanews.com/2015/04/20/containerization-is-a-winning-strategy-for-smarter-byod-management/|website=Betanews|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>

===App wrapping vs. native app management===
Especially when employees "[[bring your own device]]", mobile apps can be a significant security risk for businesses, because they transfer unprotected sensitive data to the Internet without knowledge and consent of the users. Reports of stolen corporate data show how quickly corporate and personal data can fall into the wrong hands. Data theft is not just the loss of confidential information, but makes companies vulnerable to attack and blackmail.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rob|first1=Thomas|title=Energy Smart Mobile app|url=http://mobileapp-development.com/case-studies/energy-smart-mobile-app/|website=mobileapp-development.com|publisher=Case Study|location=United Kingdom|date=8 May 2009}}</ref>

Professional mobile application management helps companies protect their data. One option for securing corporate data is [[Mobile application management|app wrapping]]. But there also are some disadvantages like copyright infringement or the loss of warranty rights. Functionality, productivity and user experience are particularly limited under app wrapping. The policies of a wrapped app can't be changed. If required, it must be recreated from scratch, adding cost.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Security|first1=Subbu Iyer, Director of Product Management, Bluebox|title=5 things you no longer need to do for mobile security|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2451083/byod/5-things-you-no-longer-need-to-do-for-mobile-security.html|website=Network World|accessdate=16 May 2016}}</ref> An app wrapper is a mobile app made wholly from an existing [[website]] or [[computing platform|platform]],<ref name="Nicol 2013 p. 138">{{cite book |last=Nicol |first=D. |title=Mobile Strategy: How Your Company Can Win by Embracing Mobile Technologies |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |series=IBM Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-13-309494-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8w-VlkM0oUwC&pg=PA138 |accessdate=December 11, 2017 |page=138}}</ref> with few or no changes made to the underlying application. The "wrapper" is essentially a new management layer that allows [[software developer|developers]] to set up usage policies appropriate for app use.<ref name="Nicol 2013 p. 138" /> Examples of these policies include whether or not [[authentication]] is required, allowing data to be stored on the device, and enabling/disabling [[file sharing]] between users.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/app-wrapping-application-wrapping |title=What is app wrapping (application wrapping)? |last=Rouse |first=Margaret |date=July 2012 |website=WhatIs.com |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> Because most app wrappers are often websites first, they often do not align with [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] Developer guidelines.

Alternatively, it is possible to offer native apps securely through [[enterprise mobility management]] without limiting the native user experience. This enables more flexible IT management as apps can be easily implemented and policies adjusted at any time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Enterprise IT Spotlight: enterprise mobility management - 451 Research - Analyzing the Business of Enterprise IT Innovation|url=https://451research.com/enterprise-it-spotlight-enterprise-mobility-management|website=451research.com|accessdate=16 May 2016}}</ref>
