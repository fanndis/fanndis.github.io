''Hndrxx'' was met with generally positive reviews. At [[Metacritic]], the album received an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 78, based on eight reviews.<ref name="Metacritic"/> Aggregator [[AnyDecentMusic?]] gave it 7.1 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.<ref name="ADM"/>

Neil Z. Yeung of [[AllMusic]] said, "Released just a week after his self-titled fifth effort, Future's ''HNDRXX'' provided an introspective and confessional complement to the more extroverted ''Future''."<ref name="allmsic"/> Ural Garrett of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' said, "''HNDRXX'' provides a view into a modern rock star indulging in a side of himself that's more thoughtful and dare one say, honest."<ref name="hiphopdx"/> Rebecca Haithcoat of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' said, "Over a well-played hand of wistful, bright-eyed and reflective beats, ''HNDRXX'' strikes a near-perfect balance between a man still licking his wounds and a man emerging from a long, dark night."<ref name="pitchfork"/> Preezy of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' said, "''HNDRXX'' is a reminder that no matter how hard he tries to shun his reputation as a hitmaker, Future remains one of the most reliable acts in mainstream music, his reluctance aside."<ref name="XXL"/>

Michael Madden of ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' said, "While his most definitive project remains 2015's ''[[DS2 (album)|Dirty Sprite 2]]'' for its balance of Future's innate melodic sense and especially effective trap records, ''HNDRXX'' comes in as a close second."<ref name="COS"/> Kristian Brito of ''[[The Quietus]]'' said, "It's the slickest, spaciest project he's released since ''[[Honest (Future album)|Honest]]'' (which was always underrated), and sits far left of the trap ''rigor mortis'' of the self-titled record."<ref name="TQ">{{cite web|last=Brito|first=Kristian|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/21942-future-hndrxx-album-review|title=The Quietus|work=[[The Quietus]]|date=March 7, 2017|accessdate=March 7, 2017|archive-date=September 17, 2020|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200917093515/https://thequietus.com/articles/21942-future-hndrxx-album-review|url-status=live}}</ref> Mosi Reeves of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said, "Like its predecessor, it's an hour-plus data dump of quotidian creativity with a slight thematic focus, not a tightly sequenced tour de force. But Future wouldn't be Future if he wasn't unburdening himself, no matter how messy and polarizing the results might be. And for the most part, he's at his most appealing here."<ref name="RS"/>
