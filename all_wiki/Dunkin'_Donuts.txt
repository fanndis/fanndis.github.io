The restaurant was successful, and Rosenberg sold franchises to others starting in 1955.<ref>{{cite news |last=Staff |first=Writer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/business/william-rosenberg-86-founder-of-dunkin-donuts.html |title=William Rosenberg, 86, Founder of Dunkin' Donuts |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2002-09-23 |accessdate=2020-06-02 |quote=In 1955, hoping to accelerate the growth of the business, Mr. Rosenberg began selling franchises to other people, starting in Worcester. }}</ref>

In 1963, Rosenberg's son [[Robert M. Rosenberg|Robert]] became CEO of the company at age 25, and Dunkin' Donuts opened its hundredth location that year. Dunkin' Donuts was a subsidiary of Universal Food Systems at the time, a conglomerate of 10 small food-service businesses,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/franchisingbusin00shoo|url-access=registration|title=Franchising: The Business Strategy that Changed the World|last=Shook|first=Carrie|last2=Shook|first2=Robert L.|date=January 1, 1993|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=|isbn=9780130656087|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref> and Dunkin' Donuts locations varied greatly in their menu options, with some selling full breakfasts and others serving only donuts and coffee.

In the following years, the other businesses in the Universal Food Systems portfolio were sold or closed, and the company was renamed to Dunkin' Donuts. The menu and shop format was standardized, and various new menu items were introduced. The chain was acquired by [[Baskin-Robbins]] owner [[Allied Domecq|Allied Lyons]] in 1990.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/mergersacquisiti00gaug|url-access=registration|title=Mergers, acquisitions, and corporate restructurings|last=Gaughan|first=Patrick A.|date=July 3, 1996|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780471131458|language=en}}</ref> By 1998, the brand had grown to 2,500 locations worldwide with $2 billion in annual sales.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Dunkin' Donuts expanded in the 1990s by buying out two rival chains: [[Mister Donut]] and [[Dawn Donuts]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/99601971/|title=Most Dawn Donut shops will start Dunkin'|date=January 18, 1992|work=Detroit Free Press|page=11A|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}</ref>

In 2004, the company's headquarters were relocated to Canton, Massachusetts.

In January 2018, Dunkin' Donuts began to open new concept locations, beginning in Quincy, featuring modern decor, cold beverages on tap and a single-cup brewing machine, more packaged take-out options, and dedicated pick-up lines for mobile ordering inside and in the drive-thru. The concept was described as being part of a shift towards becoming an "on-the-go, beverage-led brand". In addition, the location, as well as others, began to trial signage referring to the chain as simply "Dunkin{{'"}}—downplaying "Donuts" from the name.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://csnews.com/dunkin-donuts-unveils-beverage-led-store-future|title=Dunkin' Donuts Unveils 'Beverage-Led' Store of the Future|work=Convenience Store News|access-date=September 27, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Ramos |first=Nestor |date=November 17, 2017 |title=What's in a name?

A script version of the words ''Dunkin' Donuts'' was filed on March 31, 1955, and registered on February 2, 1960. A later logo was for a drawing and word logo depicting a figure with a donut for a head and a coffee cup and donut body wearing a [[Side cap|garrison cap]], with ''Dunkin''' emblazoned on both the coffee cup and cap. The design was rendered primarily in yellow and brown. The logo was applied for on June 23, 1958, registered on May 23, 1961, and put into use on July 1, 1964.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upto.gov |title=USPTO #72054025 |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |access-date=August 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801120512/http://www.upto.gov/ |archive-date=August 1, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1961, the company began using a hot pink color for its branding and used a logo showing a stylized coffee cup with the company's name rendered on one line as a circle, evoking a donut dunking into the cup. In 1980, bright orange was added to the hot pink. As of 2014, the current logo is a variation of the logo that has been in use since about 1980: an all-capitals rendering of the words ''Dunkin' Donuts'' (''Dunkin''' in orange; ''Donuts'' in pink) in a thick, Frankfurter typeface<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fontshop.com/families/frankfurter|title=Frankfurter|website=FontShop}}</ref> with a coffee cup outlined in brown with a "DD" monogram.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://heavy.com/social/2013/08/evolution-logos-brands-companies-old/6/ |title=Company Logos Then & Now: The Evolution of 20 Brand Icons – Heavy.com – Page 6 |author=Sam Prince |work=Heavy.com}}</ref>

In September 2018, the company officially announced that it would shorten its name to Dunkin', with a wider roll-out beginning in January 2019. The company acknowledged that "Dunkin{{' "}} was already a common shorthand name for the chain among customers and in its marketing (including the slogan "America Runs on Dunkin{{' "}}), and that the rebranding would reflect the chain's continuing shift towards being a "beverage-led" brand at a time when consumers have shown a preference for healthier trends and options as they consume fewer donuts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/25/dunkin-will-drop-donuts-from-its-logo-after-successful-test.html|title=Dunkin' makes it official: It's dropping 'Donuts' from its logo|last=Whitten|first=Sarah|date=September 25, 2018|work=CNBC|access-date=September 27, 2018}}</ref><ref name="change"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sns-dailymeal-1946667-eat-dunkin-donuts-rebranding-092518-20180925-story.html|title=Dunkin' Donuts is dropping the second half of its name|last=Rock|first=Taylor|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|access-date=September 27, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927125047/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sns-dailymeal-1946667-eat-dunkin-donuts-rebranding-092518-20180925-story.html|archive-date=September 27, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/business/media/dunkin-donuts-new-name.html|title=Hold the Donuts, Says Newly Named Dunkin’|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 27, 2018|language=en}}</ref> While stores in the U.S. started using the new name in 2019, the rebranding will eventually be rolled out to all of its international stores.<ref name="change"/>

===Primary ad agency===
In April 2018, Dunkin' named [[BBDO]] as their primary advertising agency. This replaced [[Hill Holliday]], which had been producing print, digital, broadcast, and billboard advertising for almost twenty years. Hill Holliday was the agency responsible for the tagline "America Runs on Dunkin{{'"}}. [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|ARC/Leo Burnett]] was also named to lead all in-store promotions.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chesto |first=Jon |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/04/17/dunkin-long-runs-hill-holliday/x7h4aJRbvFhLJZOtG82lHI/story.html |title=Dunkin' no longer runs on Hill Holliday |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=April 17, 2018 |accessdate=April 17, 2018 }}</ref>

===Affiliations===
Dunkin' has a close relationship with the [[Boston Red Sox]] and the [[New England Patriots]], making commercials at the start of each team's season for promotions. Dunkin' also sponsors other professional sports teams, including the [[Dallas Cowboys]], [[New York Yankees]], [[New York Mets]], [[Philadelphia Eagles]], and [[Tampa Bay Rays]].

In 2016, Dunkin' became the official "coffee, donut and breakfast sandwich partner" of the National Hockey League.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Perez |first1=A.J. |title=Dunkin' Donuts announces partnership with the NHL |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2016/12/05/dunkin-donuts-partner-nhl-tim-hortons/94992702/ |accessdate=May 4, 2020 |work=USA Today |date=December 6, 2016}}</ref>

In January 2014, English football club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] announced a multimillion-pound global partnership with the company.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/16/liverpool-dunkin-donuts-multi-million-partnership |title=Liverpool gobble up multi-million-pound Dunkin' Donuts deal |date=January 16, 2014 |work=Guardian |accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref>

Dunkin' Donuts signed a sponsorship deal with the [[National Women's Hockey League]] in December 2015. As part of the multi-year agreement, Dunkin’ Donuts is the official hot, iced and frozen coffee of the NWHL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todaysslapshot.com/nwhl/breaking-the-nwhl-runs-on-dunkin-donuts/|title=Breaking: The NWHL Runs on Dunkin' (Donuts) - TSS|publisher=|accessdate=April 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717225639/https://www.todaysslapshot.com/nwhl/breaking-the-nwhl-runs-on-dunkin-donuts/|archive-date=July 17, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2015, Dunkin' Donuts was announced as the named sponsor of the baseball park in [[Hartford]], Connecticut, new home of the [[Hartford Yard Goats]] baseball team. It is named [[Dunkin' Donuts Park]].

In 2001, Dunkin' Donuts purchased the naming rights for the former Providence Civic Center, and renamed it the [[Dunkin' Donuts Center]]. The center is currently the home court for the NCAA and Big East [[Providence Friars men's basketball]] team from [[Providence College]] as well as home ice for the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] [[Providence Bruins]] hockey team. In reference to the center's long association with local college basketball, it is often known locally as "The Dunk".

As of February 9, 2017, all Dunkin' locations are [[franchising|franchisee]] owned and operated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsicorporate.com/article/Dunkin_donuts_franchise_purchase|title=Dunkin donuts franchise purchase}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In addition to its stand-alone shops, Dunkin' shops can be found within many gas stations, supermarkets, mall and airport food courts, and [[Walmart]] stores. In July 2013, Dunkin' Donuts opened its 500th restaurant, in New York City. This location is combined with a Baskin-Robbins.<ref name="Dunkin' Brands Group Inc">{{cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/dunkin-brands-group-inc/index.html |title=Dunkin' Brands Group Inc. |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=October 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |first=Rob |last=Bailey}}</ref>

2014 saw the return of Dunkin' Donuts to the state of [[Minnesota]] after nearly a decade's absence, with a new shop opened inside the Kahler Grand Hotel in [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/taste/265379331.html |title=Dunkin' Donuts is back in business in Minnesota |work=startribune.com}}</ref>

In the United States, Dunkin' is sometimes paired with Baskin-Robbins [[ice cream]] in a single multibranded store. While such locations usually maintain separate counters for each chain (much like [[co-branding|co-branded]] [[Wendy's]]–Tim Hortons locations in Canada), depending on business that day, both chains' products can be bought at a single counter (usually Dunkin' Donuts').{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The practice of single-counter service is similar to that of multibranded [[Yum!

On July 30, 2020 Dunkin' Brands announced it would permanently close 800 shops in the US by the end of the year because of a 20 percent drop of sales in the second quarter during the [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the restaurant industry in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]], 450 of which are part of the previously announced closing of locations within the gas station Speedway chain.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Morona|first=Joey|last2=|last3=|date=2020-07-30|title=Dunkin’ to close up to 800 stores in the U.S. by the end of the year|url=https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2020/07/dunkin-to-close-up-to-800-stores-in-the-us-by-the-end-of-the-year.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-31|website=cleveland|language=en}}</ref><ref name="Hirsch"/>

===International===
By March 2014, Dunkin' Donuts' largest international market was [[South Korea]], representing nearly 40 percent of all international sales. With over 900 outlets in the country, it had three times as many as McDonald's, and about a third more than Starbucks. South Korea is home to Dunkin Donuts' only coffee roasting plant outside the U.S. Still, the company sees [[China]] and its vastly larger population as the more lucrative opportunity. In 2008, Dunkin' Donuts opened its first restaurant in [[Shanghai]], representing the first step in its China expansion strategy. By March 2014, it had about 50 stores in the country and an agreement to open 100 more over the next five years.<ref>{{cite news |last=Viser |first=Matt |date=March 30, 2014 |title=Dunkin’ Donuts jumps on Asia’s coffee craze |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/world/2014/03/29/from-massachusetts-seoul-dunkin-donuts-finds-new-markets-coffee-craze-sweeps-asia/aykwWhGnFNjG85ahVxJIFL/story.html |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |location=[[Seoul, Korea]] |accessdate=October 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620065009/http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/world/2014/03/29/from-massachusetts-seoul-dunkin-donuts-finds-new-markets-coffee-craze-sweeps-asia/aykwWhGnFNjG85ahVxJIFL/story.html |archive-date=June 20, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Dunkin' Donuts Opens Mainland China |url=http://www.qsrmagazine.com/news/dunkin-donut-opens-mainland-china |newspaper=QSR Magazine |date=November 21, 2008 |accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref>

In early December 2015, Dunkin' Donuts opened their first cafe in 13 years in Warsaw, Poland. The opening of a second location in Warsaw is announced for January 2016.

On January 21, 2016, Dunkin' Brands announced a master franchise agreement with Grand Parade Investments Ltd. that called for developing 250 Dunkin' Donuts and 70 Baskin-Robbins outlets throughout South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dunkin' Donuts, Baskin-Robbins Brands Expand to South Africa|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/dunkin-donuts-baskin-robbins-brands-expand-south-africa-n501196|website=NBCnews.com|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>  The first stores opened in the end of 2016 in the Cape Town area. Eventually, only 11 Dunkin' Donuts locations and five Baskin-Robbins locations opened in South Africa due to GPI's financial trouble. However by February 2019, Grand Parade Investments announced that it permanently closed all Dunkin' Brands locations in South Africa due to poor performance and unprofitably which means that Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins will be out of the lives of many South Africans.<ref>https://www.nichemarket.co.za/blog/masterchefs/fail-dunkin-donuts-baskin-robbins-south-africa</ref>

====Spain====
The term "Donuts" was already trademarked by one of the largest Spanish bakery firms, Panrico,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Castano |first1=Ivan |title=SPAIN: Panrico defends 'Donuts' trademark |url=http://www.just-food.com/news/panrico-defends-donuts-trademark_id98754.aspx |accessdate=October 5, 2014 |work=just-food.com |publisher=Aroq |date=June 11, 2007}}</ref> so the company was born as a joint venture between Dunkin' Donuts' then-parent Allied Domecq and Panrico (only Spanish shareholders, representing 50%) in order to use the brand name "Dunkin' Donuts". In 2007, after Dunkin' Donuts bought out Panrico's 50% share, the stores were rebranded to "Dunkin' Coffee".<ref>{{cite news |title=Spain: Dunkin' Donuts Changes Name to Dunkin' Coffee |url=http://www.flex-news-food.com/console/PageViewer.aspx?page=11016 |accessdate=October 6, 2014 |work=FLEXNEWS |date=September 21, 2007}}</ref> As of 2017, there are 59 Dunkin' Coffee locations in Spain, the majority of which are in Barcelona, Madrid, and Málaga. Their slogan, "Juntos es mejor", translates to "Together is better".

====Canada====
Despite once having hundreds of stores nationwide, Dunkin' Donuts and its market share all but vanished from Canada by the turn of the century. In the late 1990s to early 2000s, the chain began disappearing from all regions of Canada, with its last foothold in the province of [[Quebec]]. However, its decline was most apparent in Quebec, where the chain once had 210 stores but by mid 2017 had only three—the last franchises in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://electrostar377.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/the-rise-and-fall-of-dunkin-donuts-in-canada/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123033233/http://electrostar377.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/the-rise-and-fall-of-dunkin-donuts-in-canada/|url-status=dead|title="The rise and fall of Dunkin' Donuts in Canada", ''The Statesman'', January 19, 2013|archivedate=January 23, 2013}}</ref> By then only one free standing store had the facilities to make donuts fresh on site; the other two were merely shopping-mall food-court stands, dependent on the delivery of baked goods from the main store. One of the main reasons for Dunkin' Donuts' decline was competition with [[Tim Hortons]], similar to Tim Hortons' own decline in the northeastern United States due to heavy competition from Dunkin' Donuts. A group of Dunkin' Donuts franchisees won a C$16.4 million civil court judgement against the parent company for failing to adequately promote the brand in Canada. In September 2018, after 57 years of operating in Canada,<ref>{{cite book|last=Penfold|first=Steven|title=The Donut: A Canadian History|url=https://archive.org/details/donutcanadianhis0000penf|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-9545-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/donutcanadianhis0000penf/page/53 53]}}</ref> Dunkin' Donuts ceased business in that country when it refused to renew its franchise license to the few remaining stores left. All remaining Canadian locations were closed or rebranded as independent businesses in late 2018 - ending the presence of Dunkin' Donuts in the country.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Forster |first1=Tim |title=Dunkin' Donuts Has Given Up On Canada |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4434666/dunkin-donuts-done-in-montreal/ |website=Eater.com |publisher=Vox Media}}</ref>

====Lebanon====
Dunkin' opened its first location in [[Lebanon]] in 1998 and has since gained a lot of popularity among Lebanese people and is now one of the most popular coffee shops with many branches spread across the country.
In 2020, Dunkin' Lebanon started selling its products in supermarkets and grocery stores.

====Japan====
In 1970, [[Japan]] became the first Asian country to open Dunkin' Donuts stores. The Japanese chain was owned by a joint venture between the Saison Group, [[Yoshinoya]], and the Japanese subsidiary of the [[Compass Group]] named Seiyo Food Systems. After 28 years of operating in Japan, Dunkin' Donuts ceased business there in 1998 due to declining sales and poor performance. All of the non-military base locations were either closed or converted to [[Mister Donut]] locations. Dunkin' still has locations in United States military bases, which are open only to military personnel.

==== Israel ====

==Controversy and criticism==
In 1997, [[Dunkindonuts.org]] was established by a customer for disgruntled consumers and employees to lodge complaints about the company. The site appeared ahead of the company's own website in many [[search engine]]s and received national media coverage before being purchased by Dunkin' Donuts in 1999.<ref>{{cite news |title=For E-critic, Doughnuts to Dollars: Dunkin' Donuts Smells the Coffee, Buys Site Used by Its Wired Critics |work=[[Hartford Courant]] |url=http://articles.courant.com/1999-08-26/news/9908260049_1_dunkin-donuts-doughnut-web |date=August 26, 1999 |accessdate=October 11, 2013 |first=Jane |last=Dee}}</ref>

Dunkin' Donuts was criticized by one of its franchisees for allegedly forcing single-store owners to agree to a buyout at a loss for minor infractions. Dunkin' Donuts sued franchise owners 154 times from 2006 to April 2008. Over the same period, [[McDonald's]] was involved in five lawsuits. [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], a company that has four times the number of locations as Dunkin' Donuts, sued its franchisees 12 times. (These figures do not include arbitrations, which the companies use in pursuing legal claims against their franchisees.) Franchisees allege that the company's business strategy needs predominantly multi-unit franchisees.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2008/04/29/2008-04-29_dunkin_donuts_business_practices_have_lo-1.html |title=Dunkin' Donuts business practices have lots of holes |location=New York |work=Daily News |first1=Cindy |last1=Gluck |date=April 29, 2008}}</ref>

In 2009, the company temporarily stopped the sale of two of its products, the ''Dunkaccino'' and hot chocolate, after concern of a possible salmonella poisoning at a supplier's facilities. Dunkin' Donuts claims that none of the beverages were contaminated, but the recall was made out of safety for its consumers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/01/dunkin-donuts-salmonella-_n_223723.html |title=Dunkin' Donuts Salmonella Scare |work=The Huffington Post |first1=Julia |last1=Satow |date=August 1, 2009}}</ref>

In May 2010, Dunkin' Donuts was criticized for advertising "Free Iced Coffee Day" on its national [[Facebook]] page, which took place in only 13 cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Money/new-economy/2010/0511/Not-so-free-iced-coffee-day-at-Dunkin-Donuts |title=Not-so-free iced coffee day at Dunkin Donuts |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=May 11, 2010 |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}</ref> Because of the limited scope of the promotion, many customers became dissatisfied with the lack of free iced coffee and vented their anger on the Dunkin' Donuts Facebook page.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/72482/dunkin-donuts-free-iced-coffee-day-2010/ |title=When social media goes awry: Dunkin’ Donuts is giving away iced coffee, but not everywhere |publisher=Inquisitr.com |date=May 11, 2010 |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}</ref>

In 2013, the Dunkin' Donuts chain in Thailand used an advertisement that contained a photograph of a woman in black face-paint, in order to promote its new chocolate-flavored donuts. The company was criticized for the advertisement, with the [[Human Rights Watch]] calling the advertisement “bizarre and racist”. The headquarters in the United States apologized for the advertisement.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/Bizarre-Doughnut-Ad-Stirs-Racial-Controversy-221969671.html |title='Bizarre' Doughnut Ad Stirs Racial Controversy |publisher=NBC Southern California |date=September 1, 2013}}</ref>

Nancy Lewis, in [[Canaan, Connecticut]], began a petition in January 2014 to request that Dunkin' Donuts donate their unsold food to local shelters and food banks in her area after seeing her local shop regularly throwing away "large amounts" of unsold food. She said because the company has no official policy on the redistribution of its unsold food items to shelters or food banks, and employees are not allowed to take any home,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/dunkin-donuts-employee-in-pasco-accused-of-giving-food-away-stealing/1182939 |title=Dunkin' Donuts employee in Pasco accused of giving food away, stealing leftovers |work=www.tampabay.com |date=July 28, 2011 |access-date=November 13, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129014455/http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/dunkin-donuts-employee-in-pasco-accused-of-giving-food-away-stealing/1182939 |archive-date=November 29, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> many affiliates throw all of the goods away.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wfsb.com/story/24356913/canaan-woman-asks-dunkin-donuts-to-donate-its-leftovers |title=Canaan woman asks Dunkin Donuts to donate its leftovers |work=www.wfsb.com |date=January 3, 2014}}</ref>
