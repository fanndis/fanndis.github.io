The founder, [[Billy Graham]], stated that he wanted to "plant the evangelical flag in the middle of the road, taking the [[Social conservatism|conservative]] theological position but a definite [[Social liberalism|liberal]] approach to social problems".<ref name="Press">{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Christian|last2=Emerson|first2=Michael|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cavyDI6aCykC&q=flag+planted+%22christianity+today%22&pg=PA12|title=American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving|publisher=[[University of Chicago]] Press|year=1998|page=12|isbn=978-0226764191}}</ref>

Graham began the magazine as counterpoint to ''[[The Christian Century]]'', the predominant independent periodical of [[mainline (Protestant)|mainline]] [[Protestantism]], and as a way to bring the evangelical Christian community together.<ref name="Press"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.org/ministry/history/|title=About Christianity Today|website=Christianity Today}}</ref>

==History==
The first issue of ''Christianity Today'' was mailed October 15, 1956 and the opening editorial, Why 'Christianity Today'?,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christianitytoday.org/ministry/history/whychristianitytoday.html|title=Why 'Christianity Today'?|website=Christianity Today}}</ref> stated "''Christianity Today'' has its origin in a deep-felt desire to express historical Christianity to the present generation. Neglected, slighted, misrepresented—evangelical Christianity needs a clear voice, to speak with conviction and love, and to state its true position and its relevance to the world crisis. A generation has grown up unaware of the basic truths of the Christian faith taught in the Scriptures and expressed in the creeds of the historic evangelical churches."

Its first editor was [[Carl F. H. Henry]]. Notable contributors in its first two decades included [[F. F. Bruce]], [[Edward John Carnell]], [[Frank Gaebelein]], [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]], [[John Warwick Montgomery]], and [[Harold Lindsell]]. Lindsell succeeded Henry as editor and during his editorial administration much attention centered on debates about [[biblical inerrancy]]. Later editorial leadership came from Kenneth Kantzer, Terry Muck, and David Neff. The most recent editor in chief was [[Mark Galli]], who retired on January 3, 2020. His replacement as editor in chief is Daniel M. Harrell.<ref name=GalliRetire>{{cite news|last1=Olsen|first1=Ted|title=Mark Galli Announces Retirement as Editor in Chief of Christianity Today|url=https://www.christianitytoday.org/media-room/news/2019/mark-galli-announces-retirement-as-editor-in-chief.html|accessdate=19 December 2019|publisher=Christianity Today|date=7 October 2019}}</ref>  Andy Olsen is managing editor of the print edition and Andrea Palpant Dilley is managing editor of online journalism. The publication now includes print and online versions and various ancillary products. Print and online contents include feature stories, news ranging from cultural issues from a Christian viewpoint to the global church, opinion, reviews, and investigative reporting.

In [[Billy Graham]]'s 1997 autobiography, ''Just As I Am'', he writes  of his vision, idea, and history with ''Christianity Today'' <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christianitytoday.org/ministry/history/envisioningct.html|title=Envisioning 'Christianity Today'|website=Christianity Today}}</ref> and his early meeting with oil company executive, [[J.

==Editorials on impeachments of U.S. presidents==
During federal governmental impeachment inquiries since the founding of ''Christianity Today'', each contemporaneous editor of the publication has expressed a viewpoint of the civic situation in an editorial.

On June 7, 1974, in an editorial entitled, "Should Nixon Resign?", published during the [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|impeachment hearings]] of [[Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]], ''Christianity Today'' did not call for his resignation, instead it stated "that the constitutional process should be followed, and followed with dispatch. Either Richard Nixon should be removed from office by the Senate or he should be acquitted. If he is acquitted, the nation will have to wait out the term of a President whose ability to function has been seriously eroded."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1974/june-7/editorials-should-nixon-resign.html|title=Should Nixon Resign?|website=ChristianityToday.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref>

On October 5, 1998, regarding the imminent [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|Impeachment]] of President [[Bill Clinton]], ''Christianity Today'' stated in an editorial that "Unsavory dealings and immoral acts by the President and those close to him have rendered this administration morally unable to lead."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1998/october5/8tb036.html|title=The Prodigal Who Didn't Come Home|website=Christianity Today|language=en|access-date=December 20, 2019}}</ref>

==Other magazines published by ''Christianity Today''==
[[Harold Myra]], who became president and chief executive of the magazine in 1975, believed that a "family" of magazines would disperse overhead expenses and give more stability to the organization.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=American Evangelicals and the Mass Media: Perspectives on the Relationship Between American Evangelicals and the Mass Media|last=Board|first=Stephen|date=1990|publisher=Zondervan Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-310-27261-8|editor=Quentin J.
