'''Alpha Epsilon Phi''' ('''ΑΕΦ''' or '''AEPhi''') is a [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|sorority]] and one of the members of the [[National Panhellenic Conference]], an umbrella organization overseeing 26 North American sororities.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://npcwomen.dynamic.omegafi.com/about/our-member-organizations/|title=Our Member Organizations|work=National Panhellenic Conference|access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref>

It was founded on October 24, 1909, at [[Barnard College]]<ref name=":1">{{Cite encyclopedia|year=1937|title=Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia and Fact-Index|encyclopedia=[[Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia]]|publisher=F.E. Compton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOhOAQAAMAAJ&q=alpha+epsilon+phi+barnard&dq=alpha+epsilon+phi+barnard&hl=en|accessdate=June 9, 2018|last=Stanton Ford|first=Guy|volume=5|page=253}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> in Morningside Heights, New York City by seven Jewish women; Helen Phillips Lipman, Ida Beck Carlin, Rose Gerstein Smolin, Augustina "Tina" Hess Solomon, Lee Reiss Liebert, Rose Salmowitz Marvin, and Stella Strauss Sinsheimer. As a national sorority, it has multiple chapters across the United States, rather than a local sorority which has strictly one site location and chapter. Although it is a historically Jewish sorority, it is not a religious organization and welcomes women of all religions and race who honor, respect and appreciate the Jewish faith and identity and are comfortable in a Jewish milieu to pledge for sisterhood.<ref>"Home."

== History ==

In 1889, [[Barnard College]] was founded as a women's college connected to [[Columbia University]], which did not admit women at the time. A decade later, the campus had student organizations such as [[Fraternities and sororities|social sororities]]; however, not all sororities allowed Jewish women or other minorities to join at this time. The discrimination frustrated one student, Helen Phillips, who then fostered the idea for forming an organization for Jewish women to promise the same friendship and sisterhood as other sororities. Phillips suggested to some other women that they meet in her room and discuss the possibilities of such a club. These others were seven Jewish Barnard College students who would found the sorority – Helen Phillips, Ida Beck, Rose Gerstein, Augustina Hess, Lee Reiss, Stella Strauss, and Rose Salmowitz.

Alpha Epsilon Phi was formally chartered on October 24, 1909<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /> at Barnard College.<ref name=":1" /> The founders were not chosen because of any special scholastic prominence, financial circumstances or other arbitrary standards, but because they had a common heritage, shared common interests and were imbued with the ideals of true friendship. The sorority encouraged community service, academic presence on campuses, an increased and positive social presence and reputation, and providing a "college home and family" for each of its sisters. This idea was the basis upon which Alpha Epsilon Phi was founded. "It was her [Helen Phillips'] idea and her persistence more than anything else that brought Alpha Epsilon Phi into existence," one founder wrote. "I sometimes think that some of those ties were more necessary to Helen than to the others in this group because Helen had no mother and no sisters or brothers, and to her a group of adopted sisters was more of a need and had more significance."<ref name=":2">"AEPhi Story." Alpha Epsilon Phi. Alpha Epsilon Phi, 2013. Web. March 6, 2013.</ref>

In 1951, the sorority joined the National Panhellenic Conference.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.npcwomen.org:80/undergrads/member-organizations.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905170302/http://www.npcwomen.org/undergrads/member-organizations.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 5, 2009|title=National Panhellenic Conference|date=September 5, 2009|access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref>

== Symbols ==
The sorority's founders chose the [[pearl]] as the fraternity gem because of its glowing beauty gained through years of growth and the fact that it is a jewel that literally grows. "Pearls" are symbols for philanthropic events sisters participate in. Different activities or events have a different value of pearls that can be earned as members participate in philanthropic events. The founders also chose the colors green and white to represent growth and fellowship, respectively. The last symbol of Alpha Epsilon Phi which can be directly attributed to the founders is the flower, selected for its simple beauty and for the fact that it matches the sorority's colors. The lily of the valley's Hebrew translation is "shoshannat-ha-amaqim."

The columns of Alpha Epsilon Phi were added in 1916, the sorority's seventh year in existence. It was decided to create a simple insignia as opposed to an elaborate crest like that of most other Greek letter organizations. Each column of the insignia holds special significance to the members. The three columns Α, Ε and Φ represent faculty approval, student esteem and sorority fidelity, in order.<ref>"Phi Phacts." Alpha Epsilon Phi. Alpha Epsilon Phi, 2013. Web. March 6, 2013.</ref>

At the 1977 National Convention, the sorority chose the giraffe as their mascot. The Alpha Kappa Chapter at Miami University suggested this mascot, which was chosen because it stands the tallest and has the largest heart.

Women who have passed their new member period and are initiated as full sisters receive a 24 karat gold badge with A. E, and Φ, on the front with 27 pearls. Α has 8 pearls, Ε has 9 pearls, and Φ has 10 pearls. On the back are the new sister's initials, marking it her own.

=== Motto and tagline ===
''Multa Corda Una Causa... Many Hearts One Purpose'' was chosen as the open motto in the early years of the sorority because it best expressed the intentions of the founders of Alpha Epsilon Phi. Sisters have a handshake to greet one another and prove they are actual members of the sisterhood.

In 2001, the sorority unveiled its updated image, complete with a new tagline: Above All Else. In full, the "Core Values Statement" is as follows:  Above all else, Alpha Epsilon Phi inspires exemplary women who are: Enriched by sisterhood and unconditional friendships, Dedicated to selfless service and inspiring others, and Committed to intellectual growth and personal development. As a lifelong member of Alpha Epsilon Phi, I will: Respect our shared heritage and traditions, Exhibit high ideals and moral character, Fulfill expectations and responsibilities of membership, and Continually exemplify the values of beauty, strength and wisdom as embodied by the three columns of our insignia.<ref>"About."

== National philanthropies ==

=== Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation ===

The [[Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation]] (abbreviated EGPAF) is a public charity which "seeks to prevent pediatric HIV infections and to eradicate pediatric AIDS through research, advocacy, and prevention and treatment programs."It was founded in 1988 by Elizabeth Glaser (a member of AEPhi's Sigma chapter), Susan DeLaurentis, and Susie Zeegen (a member of AEPhi's Xi chapter). There are over 15 nations that work with the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Aids Foundation.

Elizabeth Glaser pledged AEPhi while a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 1981, Glaser contracted HIV through a blood transfusion during childbirth. Glaser and her husband, Paul, later learned that she passed the virus to her children, Ariel and Jake, without knowing it. In 1988, the Glasers lost one child, seven-year-old Ariel, to an AIDS-related illness, and thus, they created the Pediatric AIDS Foundation with their friends Susie Zeegen and Susan DeLaurentis to honor their child.<ref name="Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation 2013">"Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation." The Foundation and Alpha Epsilon Phi (ΑΕΦ). Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, 2013. Web. March 6, 2013.</ref>

AEPhi recognizes it as one of its national philanthropies. Sorority members carry on Elizabeth's legacy by raising awareness of pediatric AIDs on their campuses through fundraising events and volunteer work.<ref name="Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation 2013" />

=== Sharsheret ===

[[Sharsheret (organization)|Sharsheret]] is one of Alpha Epsilon Phi's national charitable partners; it is a national non-profit organization dedicated to serving young Jewish women with breast cancer. Hebrew for "chain," Sharsheret acts as a link between all young Jewish women and their families who face breast cancer.<ref>"XOXO AEPhi." Sharsheret. Sharsheret, 2013. Web. March 6, 2013.</ref> It was founded in November 2001 by Rochelle Shorentz, a Law Clerk to United States Supreme Court Justice's [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], a sister of Alpha Epsilon Phi. After the Supreme Court Justice was diagnosed with breast cancer at 28 years old, she researched the disease's prognosis in young Jewish women and families with Rochelle Shorentz, and the two partnered together to combat over 23,000 breast and ovarian cancer cases.<ref>"Our Story." Sharsheret. Sharsheret, 2013. Web. March 6, 2013.</ref>

Sharsheret's contributions to women's health earned the organization the New York State Innovation in Breast Cancer Early Detection and Research Award, and it was selected as a member of the LIVESTRONG Young Adult Alliance. Rochelle Shorentz was brought onto the Federal Advisory Committee on Breast Cancer in Young Women by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] honorary members. Sharsheret inspired the launching of a national ovarian cancer organization. By interacting with young Jewish families, women, and men, Sharsheret recognizes the increasing need for knowledge about breast and ovarian cancers. The organization hosts a variety of national events, such as the 2013 NYC Schlep: Jewish Breast & Ovarian Cancer Run/Walk, in New York City's Bryant Park.
