Then he portrayed Philinte in [[Molière]]'s ''[[The Misanthrope]]''. In 1984, Spacey appeared in a production of [[David Rabe]]'s ''[[Hurlyburly]]'', in which he rotated through each of the male parts (he would later play Mickey in the [[Hurlyburly (film)|film version]]). Next came [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' alongside [[David Strathairn]] and [[Colleen Dewhurst]]. In 1986, Spacey appeared in a production of ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'' in a [[New Jersey]] dinner theatre.<ref name="cornucopia">{{cite magazine |first=Pat |last=Cerasaro|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/FLASH-FRIDAY-A-Kevin-Spacey-Cornucopia-Stage-Big-Screen-Small-Screen-NOW-20140502 |title=Flash Friday: A Kevin Spacey Cornucopia — Stage, Big Screen, Small Screen & Now |magazine=Broadway World |publisher=Wisdom Digital Media|location=New York City|date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}</ref>

Spacey's prominence as a stage actor began in 1986, when he was cast opposite [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Peter Gallagher]] and [[Bethel Leslie]] as Jamie, the eldest Tyrone son, in [[Jonathan Miller]]'s lauded production of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]''.

Although his interest soon turned to film, Spacey remained actively involved in the live theater community. In 1991, he won a [[Tony Award]] for his portrayal of Uncle Louie in [[Neil Simon]]'s Broadway hit ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]''. Spacey's father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor, and did not change his mind until Spacey became well-known.<ref name="abc" />

Also in 1986, Spacey made his first film appearance in [[Mike Nichols]]' ''[[Heartburn (film)|Heartburn]]'' starring [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Jack Nicholson]]. Spacey plays a small role credited as a subway thief. In 1988 Spacey also briefly appeared in another Nichols' film ''[[Working Girl]]'', as sleazy businessman Bob Speck. Some of Spacey's other early roles include a widowed, eccentric millionaire on ''[[L.A. Law]]''; the television miniseries ''[[The Murder of Mary Phagan]]'' (1988), opposite Lemmon; and the comedy ''[[See No Evil, Hear No Evil]]'' (1989). He earned a fan base after playing the criminally insane arms dealer Mel Profitt on the television series ''[[Wiseguy]]''.

===1990s: Rise to stardom ===
Spacey quickly developed a reputation as a [[character actor]], and was cast in bigger roles, including the malevolent office manager in the ensemble film ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' (1992), one-half of a bickering [[Connecticut]] couple in the [[dark comedy]] film ''[[The Ref]]'' (1994), and a malicious [[Hollywood]] studio boss in the satire ''[[Swimming with Sharks]]'' (1995), gaining him positive notices by critics. Spacey's performance as the enigmatic criminal [[Keyser Söze|Verbal Kint]] in [[Bryan Singer]]'s 1995 [[neo-noir]] film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' won him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].<ref name=tca>{{cite episode |title=Kevin Spacey |series=Inside the Actors Studio |date=July 2, 2000 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26GE33raQNQ |network=Bravo |season=6 |number=10|last=Lipton |first=James (host)}}</ref>

In 1995, Spacey also appeared in the [[David Fincher]]'s detective thriller ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'', making a sudden entrance late in the film as the [[serial killer]] John Doe after going uncredited and unmentioned in the film's advertisements and opening credits.

Spacey made his directorial debut with the film ''[[Albino Alligator]]'' (1996). The film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $339,379 with a budget of $6&nbsp;million, but critics praised Spacey's direction. He also voiced Hopper in the animated film ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' (1998).<ref name="cornucopia" />

Throughout his career, Spacey has been well known for playing villains; he remarked in 2013: "I think people just like me evil for some reason. They want me to be a son of a bitch."<ref>{{cite news |first= Chris | last = Nashawaty| title=Kevin Spacey: Good 'n' Evil |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=February 8, 2013}}</ref>

In 1999, Spacey acted alongside [[Annette Benning]] in [[Sam Mendes]]' ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]''. In the film he played the role of Lester Burnham, a depressed suburban father and advertising executive who lusts after his teenage daughter's best friend. Spacey won his second [[Academy Award|Oscar]] this time for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]]. In his acceptance speech he dedicated his Oscar to [[Jack Lemmon]] praising him as an influence, mentor, and father figure. He also stated, "[Lemmon's] performance in ''[[The Apartment]]'' stands as one of the finest we've ever had".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCjt7PME5_E|title= Kevin Spacey Wins Best Actor: 2000 Oscars|website= [[YouTube]]|accessdate= May 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/link/072-1/|title= Kevin Spacey Academy Awards Acceptance Speech|website= Oscars.org|date=May 21, 2020}}</ref>

=== 2000s: Continued success === 
Spacey played a physically and emotionally scarred grade school teacher in ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'' (2000), a patient in a mental institution who may or may not be an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] in ''[[K-PAX (film)|K-Pax]]'' (2001), and singer [[Bobby Darin]] in ''[[Beyond the Sea (2004 film)|Beyond the Sea]]'' (2004). The latter was a lifelong dream project for Spacey, who took on co-writing, directing, co-producing and starring duties in the biography/musical about Darin's life, career and relationship with actress [[Sandra Dee]]. Facing little interest for backing in the U.S., Spacey went to the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]] for funding. Almost all of the film was made in [[Berlin]].<ref name="parade" /> Spacey provided his own vocals on the film's soundtrack and appeared in several tribute concerts around the time of its release. Spacey received mostly positive reviews for his singing, as well as a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for his performance. However, reviewers criticized the age disparity between Spacey and Darin, noting that Spacey was too old to convincingly portray Darin, particularly during the early stages of the singer's life depicted in the film.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jay | last=Boyar |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2004-12-29/news/0412280338_1_kevin-spacey-bobby-darin-pop-singer |title=A bit of Darin lives in Spacey |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |publisher=Orlando Sentinel Media Group|location=Orlando, Florida| date=December 29, 2004 |access-date=November 15, 2015}}</ref>

Amid the allegations, filming was suspended on the sixth and final season of ''House of Cards''. The show's production company had implemented "an anonymous complaint hotline, crisis counsellors, and sexual harassment legal advisors for the crew." In 2012, "someone on the crew shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey.
