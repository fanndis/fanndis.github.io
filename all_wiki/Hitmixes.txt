==Critical reception==
Due to its Canada-only release, ''Hitmixes'' did not receive many professional reviews. The ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' stated that several tracks were "artfully and decadently remixed".<ref>{{cite news|date=August 25, 2009 |title=Disc Picks; Rounding Up Some Recent Releases |work=[[Calgary Herald]] |publisher=[[Postmedia Network]] |page=E2}}</ref> Dan Rankin of Blare Magazine gave the EP three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that the mixes showed "varying degrees of success". Rankin especially praised [[Kardinal Offishall]]'s vocals on the RedOne remix of "Just Dance" and singled it and the "LoveGame" Chew Fu Ghettohouse Fix as the best tracks on the album.<ref name="blare">{{cite web|last=Rankin |first=Dan |title=Album Reviews – 24/8/09 |url=http://blaremagazine.com/2009/08/24/album-reviews-24-8-09/ |work=Blare Magazine |date=August 24, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HJKIu5Fi?url=http://blaremagazine.com/2009/08/24/album-reviews-24-8-09/ |archivedate=June 12, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Hitmixes'' debuted and peaked on the [[Canadian Albums Chart]] at number eight, on the issue dated September 12, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/music/2009/09/04/10743541-sun.html|title=DJ spins onto charts|last=Williams|first=John|date=October 4, 2009|work=[[Toronto Sun]] |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}</ref><ref name="canada" /> The next week it fell to number sixteen, and spent its third and final week on the chart at number twenty-two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2009-09-26/canadian-albums?order=drop |title=Canadian Albums |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=September 26, 2009 |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}</ref>
