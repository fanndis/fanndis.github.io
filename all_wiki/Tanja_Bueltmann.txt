== Career ==
Bueltmann's research interests are in [[diaspora]] history, particularly in connection to Scottish and English immigrant communities.<ref name=":0" />

In 2011, Bueltmann published her thesis "Scottish Ethnicity and the Making of New Zealand Society, 1850-1930", in which she "sets the scene for Scottish migration to New Zealand".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pearson|first=D.|date=2012-10-01|title=TANJA BUELTMANN.

Bueltmann argues that amid the uproar about migrant populations trying to seek refuge within the UK, it is easy to forget the historic outward migration of Britons.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/the-british-diaspora-is-a-story-of-migrants-who-changed-the-world-49840|title=The British diaspora is a story of migrants who changed the world|last=Bueltmann|first=Tanja|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}</ref> More recently, she has also examined the collective action being taken by EU citizens in the UK in response to Brexit.

Bueltmann is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society ([[FRHistS]]) and Fellow of the Higher Education Academy ([[FHEA]]).

Bueltmann worked at [[Northumbria University]] from February 2009 until July 2020, when she took up a Chair in International History at the [[University of Strathclyde]].

In March 2017 she attended [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]'s pro-EU rally, and, when interviewed by the BBC, said she had moved from Germany to "contribute to life and society in the UK and I think I've been doing that every single day since I arrived eight years ago".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-39167222|title=Hundreds gather for pro-EU rally|date=2017-03-04|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-GB}}</ref> She was a guest speaker at the People's March for Europe in London in September 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politics.ie/forum/events/258889-people-s-march-europe-pro-eu-march-london-9-september-2017-a.html|title=The People's March for Europe|work=Politics.ie|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}</ref> Since Britain's vote to leave the EU, she has written articles for a number of newspapers and online platforms, including the Guardian,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tanja-bueltmann|title=Tanja Bueltmann - Guardian profile and articles}}</ref> HuffPost UK,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/author/tanja-bueltmann/|title=Tanja Bueltmann - HuffPost UK profile and articles}}</ref> and Metro.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/author/tanja-bueltmann/|title=Tanja Bueltmann - Metro profile and articles}}</ref>

Bueltmann has publicly spoken out against the government's Brexit reassurances.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/eu-nationals-me-uk-higher-education-not-our-destination-it-our-home|title=To EU nationals like me, the UK is not our 'destination' – it is our home|date=2017-12-04|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en}}</ref> She remains concerned about the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britons who live in the EU, and continues to take a vocal stand against their being used as bargaining chips in negotiations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/06/22/first-bargaining-chips-now-stocktaking-the-plan-to-register-eu-citizens/|title=First bargaining chips, now stocktaking: the plan to register EU citizens|date=2017-06-22|work=LSE BREXIT|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-US}}</ref> When the government made a plea for EU academics to remain in the UK, Bueltmann told the [[The Independent|Independent newspaper]] "if they really meant they want us to stay, they would have guaranteed our rights fully on 24 June 2016".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-latest-news-uk-eu-citizens-valued-stay-leave-europeans-britain-immigration-rules-brexodus-a7947181.html|title=British Government pleads for 'valued' EU citizens to stay after Brexit|date=2017-09-14|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-GB}}</ref> She later argued in the [[Times Higher Education]], in a rebuttal to the then Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis's article addressed to EU nationals working in Higher Education,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/eu-academics-we-want-you-uk-and-you-will-not-be-asked-leave|title=EU academics: we want you in the UK and you will not be asked to leave}}</ref> that what everyone failed to see was that the UK is not the destination for EU nationals, but their home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/eu-nationals-me-uk-higher-education-not-our-destination-it-our-home|title=To EU nationals like me, the UK is not our 'destination' – it is our home}}</ref>

Since the EU referendum Bueltmann has focused primarily on the situation of the more than three million EU citizens at home in the UK and fighting for the protection of their rights. She is working with other campaigners, politicians and policy organisations, including the German [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation|Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/id/14683.pdf|title=Endangered Rights: The Impact of Brexit on EU Citizens}}</ref>

In July 2018, Bueltmann founded the [http://eucitizenschampion.co.uk/ EU Citizens' Champion] campaign to facilitate that work. The campaign serves two purposes: to support [[The 3 Million|the3million]], the UK’s leading not for profit organisation working to protect EU citizens’ rights, with a fundraiser, and to facilitate engagement activities that help change the narrative about freedom of movement and migration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eucitizenschampion.co.uk/project/about|title=About the EU Citizens' Champion campaign}}</ref> The campaign launch video - a satire on settled status - features actor and director [[David Schneider (actor)|David Schneider]].
