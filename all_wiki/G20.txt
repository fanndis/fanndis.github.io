The '''G20''' (or '''Group of Twenty''') is an international forum for the [[government]]s and [[central bank]] governors from 19 countries and the [[European Union]] (EU).

The heads of the G20 nations held [[List of G20 summits|summit]]s twice in 2009 and twice in 2010. Since the [[2011 G20 Cannes summit|November 2011 Cannes summit]], G20 summits have been held annually.<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20140203221850/http://www.g20.org/about_g20/past_summits Past Summits]"</ref>

==History==
===Founding===
The G20 is the latest in a series of post–[[World War II]] initiatives aimed at international coordination of economic policy, which include institutions such as the "[[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] twins", the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]], and what is now the [[World Trade Organization]].<ref>See, e.g., {{harvnb|Woods|2006}}; {{harvnb|Gilpin|2001}}; {{harvnb|Markwell|2006}}.</ref>

The G20 was foreshadowed at the Cologne summit of the [[G7]] in June 1999, and formally established at the G7 Finance Ministers' meeting on 26 September 1999 with an inaugural meeting on 15–16 December 1999 in Berlin. Canadian finance minister [[Paul Martin]] was chosen as the first chairman and German finance minister [[Hans Eichel]] hosted the inaugural meeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/g20whatisit.html|title=What is the G20?|publisher=University of Toronto|year=2010|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref>

A 2004 report by Colin I. Bradford and [[Johannes F. Linn]] of the [[Brookings Institution]] asserted the group was founded primarily at the initiative of Eichel, the concurrent chair of the G7.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Colin I. Bradford |author2=[[Johannes F.

Retrieved 16 April 2011.</ref> All acknowledge, however, that Germany and the United States played a key role in bringing their vision into reality.

Martin and Summers conceived of the G20 in response to the series of massive [[debt crisis|debt crises]] that had spread across [[emerging market]]s in the late 1990s, beginning with the [[Mexican peso crisis]] and followed by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], and eventually impacting the United States, most prominently in the form of the collapse of the prominent hedge fund [[Long-Term Capital Management]] in the autumn of 1998.<ref name="Kirton"/><ref name=Kilpatrick/><ref name="IbbitsonPerkins"/> It illustrated to them that in a rapidly globalizing world, the G7, G8, and the Bretton Woods system would be unable to provide financial stability, and they conceived of a new, broader permanent group of major world economies that would give a voice and new responsibilities in providing it.<ref name="Kirton"/><ref name="IbbitsonPerkins"/>

The G20 membership was decided by Eichel's deputy [[Caio Koch-Weser]] and Summers's deputy [[Timothy Geithner]]. According to the [[political economy|political economist]] [[Robert Wade (scholar)|Robert Wade]]:

{{blockquote|"Geithner and Koch-Weser went down the list of countries saying, Canada in, Portugal out, South Africa in, Nigeria and Egypt out, and so on; they sent their list to the other G7 finance ministries; and the invitations to the first meeting went out."{{sfn|Wade|2009|p=553}}}}

===Early topics===
The G20's primary focus has been governance of the [[global economy]]. Summit themes have varied from year to year. 
The theme of the [[2006 G20 ministerial meeting]] was "Building and Sustaining Prosperity". The issues discussed included domestic reforms to achieve "sustained growth", global energy and resource commodity markets, reform of the World Bank and IMF, and the impact of demographic changes due to an aging world population.

In 2007, South Africa hosted the secretariat with [[Trevor A. Manuel]], South African Minister of Finance as chairperson of the G20.
 
In 2008, [[Guido Mantega]], Brazil's Minister of Finance, was the G20 chairperson and proposed dialogue on competition in financial markets, [[clean energy]], economic development and fiscal elements of growth and development.

On 11 October 2008 after a meeting of G7 finance ministers, [[US President]] [[George W. Bush]] stated that the next meeting of the G20 would be important in finding solutions to the burgeoning [[Late-2000s recession|economic crisis of 2008]].

==Summits==
The Summit of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, who prepare the leaders' summit and implement their decisions, was created as a response both to the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] and to a growing recognition that key [[emerging power|emerging countries]] were not adequately included in the core of global economic discussion and governance. Additionally, the G20 summits of [[head of state|heads of state]] or [[head of government|government]] were held.

After the 2008 debut summit in Washington, DC, G20 leaders met twice a year: in London and [[Pittsburgh]] in 2009, and in [[Toronto]] and [[Seoul]] in 2010.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8072894.stm "US to host next G20 world meeting"]. BBC News. 28 May 2009. Retrieved 9 December 2012.</ref>

Since 2011, when France chaired and hosted the G20, the summits have been held only once a year.<ref>[http://www.g20.org/Documents/pittsburgh_summit_leaders_statement_250909.pdf "Leaders' statement, the Pittsburgh Summit," p. 19 §50 (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612200227/http://www.g20.org/Documents/pittsburgh_summit_leaders_statement_250909.pdf |date=12 June 2010 }}.

A number of other ministerial-level G20 meetings have been held since 2010. Agriculture ministerial meetings were conducted in 2011 and 2012; meetings of foreign ministers were held in 2012 and 2013; trade ministers met in 2012 and 2014, and employment ministerial meetings have taken place annually since 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=G20 Ministerial Meetings|url=http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/other.html|publisher=G20 Research Group|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>

In 2012, the G20 Ministers of Tourism and Heads of Delegation of G20 member countries and other invited States, as well as representatives from the [https://www.wttc.org/ World Travel and Tourism Council] (WTTC), World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and other organisations in the Travel & Tourism sector met in Mérida, Mexico, on May 16 at the [http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2012/2012-0516-tourism.html 4th T20 meeting] and focused on 'Tourism as a means to Job Creation'. As a result of this meeting and The World Travel & Tourism Council's Visa Impact Research, later on the Leaders of the G20, convened in Los Cabos on 18–19 June, would recognise the impact of Travel & Tourism for the first time. That year, the [http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2012/2012-0619-loscabos.html G20 Leaders Declaration] added the following statement: "We recognise the role of travel and tourism as a vehicle for job creation, economic growth and development, and, while recognizing the sovereign right of States to control the entry of foreign nationals, we will work towards developing travel facilitation initiatives in support of job creation, quality work, poverty reduction and global growth."<ref>{{Cite web|title=G20 Los Cabos 2012: G20 Leaders Declaration|url=http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2012/2012-0619-loscabos.html|website=www.g20.utoronto.ca|access-date=2020-05-19}}</ref>

In March 2014, the former Australian foreign minister [[Julie Bishop]], when Australia was hosting the 2014 G20 summit in [[Brisbane]], proposed to ban [[Russia]] from the summit over its role in the [[2014 Crimean crisis]].<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/policy/canberra-considers-barring-vladimir-putin-from-g20-in-brisbane-over-crimea-crisis/story-fn59nm2j-1226859923271 "Canberra considers barring Vladimir Putin from G20 in Brisbane over Crimea crisis"]. ''[[The Australian]]''. 20 March 2014. Retrieved 7 October 2015.</ref> 
The [[BRICS]] foreign ministers subsequently reminded Bishop that "the custodianship of the G20 belongs to all Member States equally and no one Member State can unilaterally determine its nature and character."

In 2016, the G20 framed its commitment to the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda]] (Sustainable Development Goals) in three key themes; the promotion of strong sustainable and balanced growth; protection of the planet from degradation; and furthering co-operation with low-income and [[Developing country|developing countries]].

===Chair rotation===
To decide which member nation gets to chair the G20 leaders' meeting for a given year, all members, except the European Union, are assigned to one of five different groupings, with all but one group having four members, the other having three. Nations from the same region are placed in the same group, except Group 1 and Group 2. All countries within a group are eligible to take over the G20 Presidency when it is their group's turn. Therefore, the states within the relevant group need to negotiate among themselves to select the next G20 President. Each year, a different G20 member country assumes the presidency starting from 1 December until 30 November. This system has been in place since 2010, when South Korea, which is in Group 5, held the G20 chair. The table below lists the nations' groupings:<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cigionline.org/publications/2010/11/future-g20-process |title=The Future of the G20 Process |publisher=[[Centre for International Governance Innovation]] |first=Barry |last=Carin |date=4 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415001621/https://www.cigionline.org/publications/2010/11/future-g20-process |archive-date=15 April 2012 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boell.de/en/2016/11/30/rotating-g20-presidency-how-do-member-countries-take-turns |title=The Rotating G20 Presidency: How do member countries take turns? |website=boell.de |date=30 November 2016 |accessdate=3 March 2019}}</ref>

==Organization==
The G20 operates without a permanent secretariat or staff. The group's chair rotates annually among the members and is selected from a different regional grouping of countries. The incumbent chair establishes a temporary secretariat for the duration of its term, which coordinates the group's work and organizes its meetings. The 2019 chair was Japan, which hosted the [[2019 G20 Osaka summit|2019 summit]] in [[Osaka]].<ref name="currentchair">[https://www.g20.org/en "G20 website"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121090204/https://www.g20.org/en |date=21 January 2018 }} G20 website.

{{quote|In a forum such as the G20, it is particularly important for the number of countries involved to be restricted and fixed to ensure the effectiveness and continuity of its activity.

===Role of Asian countries===
A 2011 report released by the [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB) predicted that large Asian economies such as China and India would play a more important role in global economic governance in the future. The report claimed that the rise of emerging market economies heralded a new world order, in which the G20 would become the global economic steering committee.<ref name="The People's Daily, PRC">{{cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/98506/7361425.html|title=Asia to play bigger role on world stage, G20: ADB report |work=The People's Daily|date=26 April 2011|accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref> The ADB furthermore noted that Asian countries had led the global recovery following the [[late-2000s recession]].

==Invitees==
[[File:G20 members and invited states.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|G20 members (blue) and previously invited states (pink) as of 2016]]
Typically, several participants that are not permanent members of the G20 are extended invitations to participate in the summits. Each year, the Chair of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]]; the [[Chairperson of the African Union|Chair]] of the [[African Union]]; and a representative of the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] are invited in their capacities as leaders of their organisations and as heads of government of their home states.<ref name="G20 World"/> Additionally, the leaders of the [[Financial Stability Board]], the [[International Labour Organization]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], the [[United Nations]], the [[World Bank Group]] and the [[World Trade Organization]] are invited and participate in pre-summit planning within the policy purview of their respective organisation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.g20australia.org/about_g20/g20_members/international_organisations|title=International Organisations|publisher=G-20 Australia|year=2014|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref> Spain is a permanent non-member invitee.<ref name="Henley" /><ref name="G20 World"/>

Other invitees are chosen by the host country, usually one or two countries from its own region.<ref name="G20 World"/> For example, South Korea invited Singapore. International organisations which have been invited in the past include the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC), the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] (BCBS), the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS), the [[Eurasian Economic Community]] (EAEC), the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[Global Governance Group]] (3G) and the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC). Previously, the [[Netherlands]] had a similar status to Spain while the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|rotating presidency]] of the [[Council of the European Union]] would also receive an invitation, but only in that capacity and not as their own state's leader (such as the Czech premiers [[Mirek Topolánek]] and [[Jan Fischer (politician)|Jan Fischer]] during the 2009 summits).

As of 2020, leaders from the following nations have been invited to the G20 summits: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Benin]], [[Brunei]], [[Cambodia]], [[Chad]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Denmark]], [[Egypt]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Guinea]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Laos]], [[Malawi]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mauritania]], [[Myanmar]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Nigeria]], [[Norway]], the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Rwanda]], [[Senegal]], [[Singapore]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Thailand]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Zimbabwe]].<ref name="G20 World">[https://g20.org/about-g20/g20-members/g20-world/ "G20 and the world"].

==G20 Agenda==
===Financial focus===
The initial G20 agenda, as conceived by US, Canadian and German policy makers, was very much focused on the sustainability of [[Government debt|sovereign debt]] and global financial stability, in an inclusive format that would bring in the largest [[Developing country|developing economies]] as equal partners. During a summit in November 2008, the leaders of the group pledged to contribute trillions to international finance organizations, including the World Bank and IMF, mainly for reestablishing the global financial system.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/how-canada-made-the-g20-happen/article4322767/?page=all |work=theglobeandmail.com |location=Toronto |title=How Canada Made the G20 Happen |first=John |last=Ibbitson |date=18 June 2016 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref><ref name="FA">{{cite journal|title=The End of the G-20|journal=[[Foreign Affairs]]|date=September 2016|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-09-14/end-g-20}}{{subscription required|via=Foreign Affairs}}</ref>

Nicolas J. |last=Firzli |date=7 July 2017 |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> were added to the G20 agenda: migration, [[digitisation]], employment, healthcare, the economic empowerment of women and [[development aid]].<ref>[https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/gzwanzig-ergebnisse-105.html ''Abschlusserklärung steht – Dissens bleibt.''] ''tagesschau.de''. 8 July 2017, retrieved 12 July 2017.</ref>

===Interrelated themes===
[[Wolfgang Schäuble]], German [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Minister of Finance]], has insisted on the interconnected nature of the issues facing G20 nations, be they purely financial or developmental, and the need to reach effective, [[cross-cutting cleavage|cross-cutting]] policy measures: "Globalization has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty, but there is also a growing rise in frustration in some quarters […] development, [national] security and migration are all interlinked"<ref name="auto1"/>

==Criticisms==

===Exclusivity of membership===
Although the G20 has stated that the group's "economic weight and broad membership gives it a high degree of legitimacy and influence over the management of the global economy and financial system",<ref>[http://www.g20.org/about_what_is_g20.aspx "About G-20"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131120040653/http://www.g20.org/about_what_is_g20.aspx |date=20 November 2013 }}. G20.org. Retrieved 11 December 2012.</ref> its legitimacy has been challenged. A 2011 report for the [[Danish Institute for International Studies]] criticised the G20's exclusivity, particularly highlighting its underrepresentation of African countries and its practice of inviting observers from non-member states as a mere "concession at the margins", which does not grant the organisation representational legitimacy.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Vestergaard |first=Jakob |url=http://www.diis.dk/graphics/publications/reports2011/rp2011-04-g20-and-beyond_web.pdf|title=The G20 and Beyond: Towards Effective Global Economic Governance|journal=DIIS Report|date=April 2011|accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref> 
With respect to the membership issue, former US President [[Barack Obama]] noted the difficulty of pleasing everyone: "Everybody wants the smallest possible group that includes them. So, if they're the 21st largest nation in the world, they want the G21, and think it's highly unfair if they have been cut out."<ref>Kelly Chernenkoff. [https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-to-usher-in-new-world-order-at-g-20 "Obama to Usher In New World Order at G-20"]. [[Fox News]]. 25 September 2009. Retrieved 24 December 2015.</ref> Others stated in 2011 that the exclusivity is not an insurmountable problem, and proposed mechanisms by which it could become more inclusive.{{sfn|Cooper|2011}}

====Norwegian perspective====

In line with Norway's emphasis on inclusive international processes, the United Nations and the UN-system, in a 2010 interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', former Norwegian foreign minister [[Jonas Gahr Støre]] called the G20 "one of the greatest setbacks since World War II"<ref name="setback">{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,702104,00.html |title=Norway Takes Aim at G-20:'One of the Greatest Setbacks Since World War II' |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=22 June 2010 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> as 173 nations who are all members of the UN are not among the G20. This includes Norway, a major developed economy and the seventh-largest contributor to UN international development programs,<ref name="real donor">{{cite news|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/government-and-policy/peace/un/|title=Norway and the UN |publisher=Norway.org |date=12 May 2012 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref> which is not a member of the EU, and thus is not represented in the G20 even indirectly.<ref name="setback" /> Norway, like other such nations, has little or no voice within the group. Støre argued that the G20 undermines the legitimacy of international organizations set up in the aftermath of World War II, such as the IMF, World Bank and United Nations:

{{quote|The G20 is a self-appointed group. Its composition is determined by the major countries and powers. It may be more representative than the G7 or the G8, in which only the richest countries are represented, but it is still arbitrary. We no longer live in the 19th century, a time when the major powers met and redrew the map of the world. No one needs a new [[Congress of Vienna]].<ref name="setback" />}}

Norway, under the government of [[Erna Solberg]], attended the [[2017 G20 Hamburg summit|2017 G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2017/07/07/solberg-eager-to-speak-up-at-g20/ |title=Solberg eager to speak up at G20 |publisher=NEWS in ENGLISH.no |date=7 July 2017|accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> and participates{{when|date=October 2019}} in working groups and sub-working groups, for instance on research.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} The Norwegian Minister of the Elderly will participate{{when|date=October 2019}}<!-- Well... did it? --> under the 2019 Japanese presidency of the G20.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

====Spanish position on membership====
The Spanish government's policy is to not request official membership. Despite being hit hard by the economic crisis after 2008, Spain is still the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|thirteenth largest economy]] by [[nominal GDP]] (the 5th in the European Union) and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifteenth largest]] by [[purchasing power parity]], clearly exceeding the numbers of several current members of the G20 such as Argentina or South Africa. In addition, since the 1990s several Spanish companies have gained multinational status, often expanding their activities in culturally close Latin America, where Spain is the second biggest foreign investor after the United States and keeps an important influence. These facts have reinforced the idea that Spain should seek permanent membership of the G20.<ref name="Henley" />

====Polish aspirations====
In contrast with the Spanish position, the [[Poland|Polish]] government has repeatedly asked to join the G20.

Before the [[2009 G20 London summit]], the Polish government expressed an interest in joining with Spain and the Netherlands and condemned an "organisational mess" in which a few European leaders speak in the name of all the EU without legitimate authorisation in cases which belong to the [[European Commission]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

During a 2010 meeting with foreign diplomats, former Polish president [[Lech Kaczyński]] said:
{{quote|Polish economy is according to our data an 18th world economy. The place of my country is among the members of the G20. This is a very simple postulate: firstly – it results from the size of [[Economy of Poland|Polish economy]], secondly – it results from the fact that Poland is the biggest country in its region and the biggest country that has experienced a certain story. That story is a political and economic transformation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gospodarka.dziennik.pl/news/artykuly/110121,polska-w-g-20-warto-sie-bic.html |title=Polska w G-20 - warto się bić? |language=pl |trans-title=Poland in G-20 - is it worth the fight? |date=2 March 2010 |author=Kamila Wronowska |website=dziennik.pl}}</ref>}}

In 2012, Tim Ferguson wrote in ''[[Forbes]]'' that swapping Argentina for Poland should be considered, claiming that the Polish economy was headed toward a leadership role in Europe and its membership would be more legitimate.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timferguson/2012/04/09/g20-boot-argentina-include-poland/ |title=G20: Boot Argentina, Include Poland |first=Tim |last=Ferguson }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/04/19/who-would-replace-argentina-on-the-g20/ |title=Who would replace Argentina on the G20?}}</ref> A similar opinion was expressed by Marcin Sobczyk in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2010/02/03/g20-needs-poland/ |title=G20 Needs Poland |first=Marcin|last=Sobczyk|date=3 February 2010}}</ref> and by Mamta Murthi from the [[World Bank]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In 2014 consulting company [[Ernst & Young]] published its report about optimal members for G20. After analyzing trade, institutional and investment links Poland was included as one of the optimal members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/42/3306/Artykul/1232256,Polska-w-grupie-G20-jesli-tam-nie-bedziemy-inni-beda-decydowac-za-nas|title=Polska w grupie G20: jeśli tam nie będziemy, inni będą decydować za nas|publisher=polskieradio.pl}}</ref>

G20 membership has been part of Poland's [[Law and Justice]] party and President [[Andrzej Duda]] political program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,75478,17465365,Andrzej_Duda__Trzeba_wzmacniac_armie__zwiekszyc_obecnosc.html| title=Wyborcza.pl|website=wyborcza.pl}}</ref> 
In March 2017, Deputy Prime Minister of Poland [[Mateusz Morawiecki]] took part in a meeting of G20 financial ministers in [[Baden-Baden]] as the first Polish representative.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tvn24bis.pl/ze-swiata,75/rzeczy-ktore-musisz-wiedziec-o-szczycie-g20,724315.html|title=Rzeczy, które musisz wiedzieć o szczycie G20 {{!}} Ze świata|work=TVN24 BiS|access-date=31 March 2017|language=pl}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rp.pl/Gospodarka/303169812-Morawiecki-wsrod-ministrow-finansow-G20.html#ap-1|title=Morawiecki wśród ministrów finansów G20 - Gospodarka - rp.pl|access-date=31 March 2017}}</ref>

====Global Governance Group (3G) response====
In June 2010, Singapore's representative to the United Nations warned the G20 that its decisions would affect "all countries, big and small", and asserted that prominent non-G20 members should be included in financial reform discussions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.sg/content/mfa/overseasmission/newyork/nyemb_statements/global_governance_group/2010/201006/press_201006_3.html|title=Statement by Ambassador Vanu Gopala Menon, Permanent Representative of Singapore to the United Nations|publisher=Singapore UN Mission|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref> Singapore thereafter took a leading role in organizing the [[Global Governance Group]] (3G), an informal grouping of 30 non-G20 countries (including several [[microstates]] and many [[Third World]] countries) with the aim of collectively channelling their views into the G20 process more effectively.<ref name="Press Statement by the Global Governance Group (3G) on its Ninth Ministerial Meeting in New York on 22 September 2016">{{cite web|title=Press Statement by the Global Governance Group (3G) on its Ninth Ministerial Meeting in New York on 22 September 2016|url=https://www.mfa.gov.sg/content/mfa/media_centre/press_room/pr/2016/201609/press_20160923.html|website=mfa|accessdate=23 July 2017|language=en-us|date=22 September 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.siiaonline.org/?q=programmes/insights/siia-welcomes-new-3g-initiative-small-states "SIIA welcomes new 3G initiative for small states"].

====''Foreign Policy'' critiques====
The American magazine ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' has published articles condemning the G20, in terms of its principal function as an alternative to the supposedly exclusive G8. It questions the actions of some of the G20 members, and advances the notion that some nations should not have membership in the first place. Furthermore, with the effects of the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|Great Recession]] still ongoing, the magazine has criticized the G20's efforts to implement reforms of the world's financial institutions, branding such efforts as failed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/04/12/the_g_20_is_failing|title=The G-20 Is Failing|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|first=Edwin M.|last=Truman|date=12 April 2012|accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref>

===Wider concerns===
The G20's prominent membership gives it a strong input on global policy despite lacking any formal ability to enforce rules. There are disputes over the legitimacy of the G20,<ref>{{cite web |author1=Kathrin Berensmann |author2=Thomas Fues |author3=Ulrich Volz |date=January 2011 |url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/184899/index.en.shtml |website=D+C |title=Informal power centre |access-date=3 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101160942/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/184899/index.en.shtml |archive-date=2011-01-01}}</ref> and criticisms of its organisation and the efficacy of its declarations.<ref>{{cite web |author=Sachin Chaturvedi |url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/190338/index.en.shtml |website=D+C |title=Mainstream Heiligendamm |date=January 2011 |access-date=3 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101160819/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/190338/index.en.shtml |archive-date=2011-01-01}}</ref>

The G20's transparency and accountability have been questioned by critics, who call attention to the absence of a formal charter and the fact that the most important G20 meetings are closed-door.<ref>Daniele Archibugi. [http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/email/the-g20-ought-to-be-increased-to-6-billion "The G20 ought to be increased to 6 Billion"]. OpenDemocracy.net. 31 March 2009. Retrieved 26 April 2013.</ref> In 2001, the economist [[Frances Stewart (economist)|Frances Stewart]] proposed an Economic Security Council within the United Nations as an alternative to the G20. In such a council, members would be elected by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] based on their importance to the world economy, and the contribution they are willing to provide to world economic development.<ref>[[Frances Stewart (economist)|Stewart, Frances]] and Daws, Sam. [http://www3.qeh.ox.ac.uk/RePEc/qeh/qehwps/qehwps68.pdf "An Economic and Social Security Council at the United Nations" (PDF)]. [[Oxford University]]. March 2001. Retrieved 8 January 2013.</ref>

The cost and extent of summit-related security is often a contentious issue in the hosting country, and G20 summits have attracted protesters from a variety of backgrounds, including [[information activist]]s, opponents of [[fractional-reserve banking]] and [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalists]]. In 2010, the Toronto G20 summit sparked [[2010 G20 Toronto summit protests|mass protests and rioting]], leading to the largest mass arrest in Canada's history.{{cn|date=November 2020}}
