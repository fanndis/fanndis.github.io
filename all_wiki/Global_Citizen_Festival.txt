==Mission==
The Global Citizen Festival is part of a movement to end [[extreme poverty]]. By contributing to charity acts on the website, including watching videos and signing petitions, fans can get free tickets to the festival. In addition, the organizers are striving to make the event "global" by [[live-streaming]] events in public locations. Since 2015, the goals of the festival have been closely aligned with the [[United Nations]]' [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), which include 17 tasks to end extreme global poverty by 2030.<ref name=Goals/>

According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Global Citizen's model of ticket distribution in 2017 generated 1.6 million actions in two months, equaling commitments and announcements of $3.2 billion for sustainable development and affecting 221 million people.<ref name="Global Citizen Festival's Co-Founder Explains Its Birth & Mission"/><ref name="Stevie Wonder Takes a Knee and Green Day Rouses the Crowd at Global Citizen Festival">{{cite magazine | URL= http://time.com/4955090/global-citizen-festival-2017-stevie-wonder-knee/|magazine= Time|title= Stevie Wonder Takes a Knee and Green Day Rouses the Crowd at Global Citizen Festival |access-date= November 19, 2018}}</ref>

== History ==
===2012===
Co-founder Ryan Gall created the Global Citizen Festival when he met festival co-founder Hugh Evans at [[Columbia University]] at a conference and proposed the idea of holding a festival on the [[Great Lawn and Turtle Pond|Great Lawn]] of [[Central Park]]. The pair later approached concert promoter [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|Goldenvoice]] to launch the festival in 2012.<ref name="Global Citizen Festival's Co-Founder Explains Its Birth & Mission"/><ref name="Pop Stars Join Growing Effort to Aid the Poor">{{cite news | URL=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/arts/music/hugh-evans-29-force-behind-global-festival-on-great-lawn.html |newspaper= New York Times|title= Pop Stars Join Growing Effort to Aid the Poor |access-date= November 19, 2018}}</ref>

Gall says the inspiration for the festival came from visiting ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' and seeing the [[brand]]ing on each stage but wanting to replace the corporate branding with branding from charities.<ref name="Beyonce, Jay-Z Among Headliners at Global Citizen Festival Honoring Nelson Mandela Centennial"/> Tickets to the festival are distributed through a lottery system with festival-goers performing actions on Global Citizen's website, globalcitizen.org (which Gall co-founded), for a chance to attend the event.<ref name="Sam Roberts Band to Headline Free-For-Activists Global Citizen Event in Vancouver">{{Cite web | URL=https://www.samaritanmag.com/news/sam-roberts-band-headline-free-activists-global-citizen-event-vancouver |publisher= samaritanmag|title= Sam Roberts Band to Headline Free-For-Activists Global Citizen Event in Vancouver|access-date= November 19, 2018}}</ref> The festival has taken its model to Australia, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium and Canada and is one of the largest, most visible events drawing attention to sustainability and anti-poverty efforts for young people around the world.<ref name="Beyonce, Jay-Z Among Headliners at Global Citizen Festival Honoring Nelson Mandela Centennial"/>

The situation was soon resolved and the festival continued, although some attendees were unable to re-enter the park for the festival and a few dozen were injured.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/global-citizen-festival-2018-message/|title=A Message About Last Night's Global Citizen Festival From Founder & CEO Hugh Evans|date=September 30, 2018|access-date=September 30, 2018|first=Hugh|last=Evans|work=Global Citizen}}</ref>

The Johannesburg show was marred by violence as many concertgoers were robbed and assaulted outside the venue by armed attackers, allegedly due to a total lack of police and security presence. Twitter users reported that SAPS had not given them the help they needed though they were asked multiple times. It caused a debate whether the festival should have had more security or lack of help from the security and SAPS.<ref>{{cite web |title=Horror stories of crime mar Global Citizen Festival |url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2018-12-03-horror-stories-of-crime-mar-global-citizen-festival/|access-date=}}</ref>
