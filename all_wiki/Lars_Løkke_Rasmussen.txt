'''Lars Løkke Rasmussen''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of the Dannebrog|RSKmd]]}} ({{IPA-da|ˈlɑːs ˈløkə ˈʁɑsmusn̩|lang}}; born 15 May 1964) is a Danish politician who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Denmark|25th]] [[Prime Minister of Denmark]] from 2009 to 2011 and again 2015 to 2019. He was the leader of the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] party from 2009 to 2019.

Rasmussen has been a member of the [[Folketing]] since 21 September 1994. He also served as [[Counties of Denmark|County Mayor]] of [[Frederiksborg County]] from 1998 to 2001. Subsequently, he was the [[Interior and Health Minister (Denmark)|Interior and Health Minister]] from 27 November 2001 to 23 November 2007 as part of [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]]'s [[Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen I|first]] and [[Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen II|second cabinets]], and then [[Finance Minister of Denmark|Minister of Finance]] from 23 November 2007 to April 2009 as part of Anders Fogh Rasmussen's [[Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen III|third cabinet]]. On 5 April 2009, he succeeded Anders Fogh Rasmussen as Prime Minister following the latter's appointment as [[Secretary General of NATO]].

In the [[2011 Danish general election|2011 general election]], the government lost its parliamentary majority and Rasmussen tendered the government's resignation to [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]]. He was succeeded by [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] on 3 October 2011. In the [[2015 Danish general election|2015 general election]], the right-wing parties regained a majority in the Folketing. Rasmussen again became Prime Minister and formed his [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen II Cabinet|second cabinet]] in the same month. This cabinet was made up exclusively of Venstre members, but in November 2016 he was pressured to also include members of [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]] and [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]], forming his third cabinet.

On 6 June 2019, he resigned from his position as prime minister after [[2019 Danish general election|a general election]], in which his government was defeated. However, he continued to lead a caretaker government until a new government was formed and sworn in. This was completed on 27 June 2019 and Rasmussen was succeeded as Prime Minister by [[Mette Frederiksen]]. On 31 August 2019, he resigned as chairman of Venstre.

==Early life==
Lars Løkke Rasmussen was born in [[Vejle]] to Jeppe Rasmussen and Lise Løkke Rasmussen (née Løkke). His last name is Rasmussen, while Løkke, his mother's [[maiden name]], is his [[middle name#Scandinavia|middle name]]. Unless his full name is used, he is correctly referred to only by the name of Rasmussen, but his middle name is used frequently by the media and in informal usage to distinguish him from [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] and [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]], his two immediate predecessors as Prime Minister (to whom he is not related).<ref>According to [[Statistics Denmark]], ''Rasmussen'' is the ninth-most common last name in Denmark: http://www.dst.dk/Statistik/Navne/pop/2009.aspx</ref>

He graduated from [[Gymnasium (Denmark)|high school]] in 1983, and was the president of the [[Venstres Ungdom|youth branch of Venstre]] from 1986 to 1989. He graduated with a law degree ([[Candidatus juris|cand. jur]]) from the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1992. From 1990 to 1995 he worked as a self-employed consultant.

Lars Løkke Rasmussen is married to [[Sólrun Løkke Rasmussen]] (née Sólrun Jákupsdóttir). Together they have three children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billedbladet.dk/kendte/danmark/lars-loekke-rasmussen-forsoemte-familien|title=Lars Løkke Rasmussen forsømte familien - BILLED-BLADET|author=|date=24 December 2009|website=billedbladet.dk|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>

==Political career==

===Venstres Ungdom chairmanship and Afghanistan mission===
Lars Løkke Rasmussen served as chairman of the [[Venstres Ungdom|youth branch]] of [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] from 1986 to 1989. One of his initiatives was to establish an alternative to ''Operation Dagsværk'' — an annual one day fundraising campaign by high school students collecting money for third world countries — since ''Operation Dagsværk'' at the time was spearheaded by members of the Danish Communist Youth.<ref name="Politiken">{{cite news |publisher=[[Politiken]] |language=Danish |date=25 February 2009 |accessdate=7 April 2009 |url=http://politiken.dk/debat/kroniker/article656137.ece |title=I Afghanistan med Lars Løkke Rasmussen |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226194730/http://politiken.dk/debat/kroniker/article656137.ece |archivedate=26 February 2009 }}</ref> Rasmussen's campaign was supported by the party youth branch, and raised 600,000 [[Danish krone|DKK]] which were spent on school equipment<ref name="Politiken"/> in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Soviet occupation of Afghanistan|occupied]] Afghanistan.<!--quote from the source: "Det lykkedes den alternative indsamling at rejse 600.000 kroner ude på de danske gymnasier. Penge, der går til bøger, bygninger, tavler og kridt. Skoler som huser både drenge og piger, sådan som det er meningen.--> Lars Løkke Rasmussen led a Danish delegation to Afghanistan delivering the collected funds, and a photograph taken by photographer [[Jørn Stjerneklar]] shows him and two other delegation members disguised as Afghans.<!--photo with caption on http://politiken.dk/debat/kroniker/article656137.ece --> Another photo shows him holding an [[AK-47]], while standing together with three [[Mujahideen]].<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[Dagbladet Information|Information]] |language=Danish |date=22 November 2008 |accessdate=20 May 2009 |url=http://www.information.dk/172616 |title=Da mujahedinerne var helte }}</ref> The photos have generated a lot of media attention in Denmark, after the Danish participation in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]] and especially as Rasmussen moved up the rankings at Venstre.

===County Mayor and deputy chairman of Venstre===
Rasmussen was elected deputy chairman of [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] in 1998, at the same time as [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] assumed the position as party leader after [[Uffe Ellemann-Jensen]]. In 1998, he was elected as county mayor of [[Frederiksborg County]], a position he occupied until 2001, when he joined the [[cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen I|first Fogh Rasmussen cabinet]].

===Minister of the Interior and Health===
Lars Løkke Rasmussen served as Interior and Health Minister between 2001 and 2007 until he was appointed Minister of Finance in 2007. He was responsible for negotiating a 2002 agreement between [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]], the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservatives]], the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and the [[Danish People's Party]] giving patients in public hospitals the right to select a [[private hospital]], provided that the public hospital had been unable to treat the patient within two months.<!--''Det Udvidede Frie Sygehusvalg''-->  In 2007, this time limit was lowered to one month. Since 2002, the government has awarded extra funds earmarked at reducing the waiting list at National Health Service hospitals, a grant sometimes referred to by the media as ''Løkkeposen''<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[B.T. (tabloid)|BT]] |language=Danish |date=16 November 2006 |accessdate=13 May 2009 |url=http://www.bt.dk/article/20030614/nyheder/106140334/ |title=Løkkeposen på vej ud på sygehusene }}</ref> (A pun on 'lykkepose' the Danish word for a goodie bag). He also represented the government during negotiations regarding a reform of the system by which richer municipalities transfer part of their tax incomes to poorer municipalities<!--Udligningsreformen-->.

====Municipal reform of 2007====
As [[Minister of the Interior and Health (Denmark)|Minister of the Interior and Health]], Lars Løkke Rasmussen spearheaded the [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipal Reform 2007|municipal reform]] that reduced Denmark's 271 municipalities to 98, and abolished the 14 [[Counties of Denmark|counties]] and replaced them with five [[Regions of Denmark|regions]].<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[Politiken]] |language=Danish |date=24 March 2009 |accessdate=4 April 2009 |url=http://politiken.dk/debat/kroniker/article674628.ece |title=Regeringens populistiske narreværk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327134925/http://politiken.dk/debat/kroniker/article674628.ece |archivedate=27 March 2009 }}</ref>

===Minister of Finance===
After then Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen won his second reelection in 2007 he created his third cabinet in which Lars Løkke Rasmussen was appointed Minister of Finance. This was seen as a clear indicator that Rasmussen was next in line to follow Fogh as leader of Venstre and Prime Minister, when Fogh would leave Danish politics.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[Berlingske Tidende]] |language=Danish |date=23 November 2007 |accessdate=13 May 2009 |url=http://www.berlingske.dk/article/20071123/politik/111221379/ |title=Arvefølgen i Venstre på plads |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007141151/http://www.berlingske.dk/article/20071123/politik/111221379/ |archive-date=7 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
As Finance Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen led the negotiations concerning funds to banks hit by the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009|global financial crisis]].

===Tax reform of 2009===
In February 2009, Lars Løkke Rasmussen was the chief negotiator in the political agreement behind a major tax reform, implementing the government's ambition of reducing income tax and increasing taxes on pollution.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[Politiken]] |language=Danish |date=1 March 2009 |accessdate=4 April 2009 |url=http://politiken.dk/politik/article659652.ece |title=Nu er skattereformen på plads}}</ref> The reform was, according to Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the biggest reduction of the [[marginal tax rate]] since the introduction of the [[income tax]] in 1903.<ref name="jp">{{cite news |publisher=[[Jyllands-Posten]] |language=Danish |date=1 March 2009 |accessdate=4 April 2009 |url=http://jp.dk/indland/indland_politik/article1618813.ece |title=Direktøren får 53.409 kr. – hjemmehjælper 2.779 kr. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410034413/http://jp.dk/indland/indland_politik/article1618813.ece |archive-date=10 April 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The opposition accused it of being historically skewed in favouring those with high-income jobs and giving very little to those with low-income jobs.<ref name="jp" />

==Prime Minister of Denmark==
[[File:Lars Løkke Rasmussen foran Amalienborg 7 april 2009 (edit).JPG|thumb|Rasmussen outside [[Amalienborg Palace]] immediately after his appointment as Prime Minister by Queen Margrethe.]]
On 4 April 2009, [[NATO]] decided that Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] would replace [[Jaap de Hoop Scheffer]] as [[Secretary General of NATO]].<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[Politiken]] |language=Danish |date=4 April 2009 |accessdate=4 April 2009 |url=http://politiken.dk/politik/article684422.ece |title=Fogh bliver ny Nato-chef}}</ref> On the same day, Anders Fogh Rasmussen declared that he would resign as Prime Minister on 5 April 2009. As deputy of the largest party in the government, Lars Løkke Rasmussen thus took over the post as Prime Minister of Denmark.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[Politiken]] |language=Danish |date=4 April 2009 |accessdate=4 April 2009 |url=http://politiken.dk/politik/article684491.ece |title=Løkke tager over i morgen |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407074958/http://politiken.dk/politik/article684491.ece |archivedate=7 April 2009 }}</ref> An opinion poll released on the day of Lars Løkke Rasmussen's takeover revealed that Danes believed that he only beat [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] as the person best suited for bringing Denmark through the [[Global financial crisis of 2008–2009|financial crisis]], and that Thorning-Schmidt would have been better suited to combatting unemployment, reducing hospital waiting lists, securing the welfare society of the future, and representing Denmark internationally.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[Politiken]] |language=Danish |date=5 April 2009 |accessdate=5 April 2009 |url=http://politiken.dk/politik/article684604.ece |title=Løkke slår kun Thorning på et punkt |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408031818/http://politiken.dk/politik/article684604.ece |archivedate=8 April 2009 }}</ref> On 7 April 2009, Lars Løkke Rasmussen announced the new set of ministers in [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen I Cabinet|his Cabinet]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Politiken]] |language=Danish |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=7 April 2009 |url=http://politiken.dk/politik/article685809.ece |title=Løkke sætter sit første ministerhold |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408031412/http://politiken.dk/politik/article685809.ece |archivedate=8 April 2009 }}</ref>

===COP15 - December 2009===
Lars Løkke Rasmussen has been sharply criticized from many sides for his handling of the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|COP15]] leadership.

At the first meeting of the summit high level section, led by Lars Løkke Rasmussen, a number of countries protested the Danish handling of the negotiations. ”We cannot continue to talk about procedure. We must move forward. The World awaits us”, said Lars Løkke Rasmussen responding to criticism of the Danish led negotiations coming from several countries who regarded them as undemocratic.<ref name="politiken1">{{cite web |author=Marie Hjortdal |url=http://politiken.dk/klima/klimapolitik/article861338.ece |title=Løkke får klimadebut i modvind |language=da |publisher=Politiken.dk |accessdate=19 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219130841/http://politiken.dk/klima/klimapolitik/article861338.ece |archive-date=19 December 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Many developing countries viewed this statement as arrogant. Procedure is a major element in UN negotiations.<ref name="politiken2">{{cite web |author=Michael Rothenborg, Martin Aagaard og Ellen Ø.

This is about content. We have stated that the results in Copenhagen must come in two texts. One cannot simply present a text pulled from the clouds”, replied the Chinese delegate in the auditorium.<ref name="politiken1"/>

Stanislaus Lumumba Di-Aping, chief negotiator for the Developing Nations' organisation [[Group of 77|G77]], cross examined what exactly Rasmussen meant when stating that the chairmen of the negotiating groups should be "people whom we trust".<ref name="politiken2"/> Criticism of the Office of the Prime Minister was supported by China, India and Brazil. The last had been regarded as an ally by the Danish delegation.<ref name="politiken2"/>

The international press, too, has been severe in its criticism of the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's Office. The BBC's climate correspondent stated: "According to all my sources, the Prime Minister's Office is on the verge of a melt-down. They have no modus operandi, or the diplomatic experience needed to plan one in advance. Ed Miliband, the UK [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change]], was quoted for stating that "Denmark is doing a reasonable job".<ref name="politiken2"/>

===Budget cuts===

In May 2010 Rasmussen's government announced major spending cuts and measures designed to increase revenues, notably to unemployment insurance (cut from a maximum of four years to two), foreign aid (cut from 0.83% of GDP to 0.76%), cuts to child support payments, and miscellaneous tax reforms designed to increase revenues.<ref>{{cite web |author=Marie Sæhl |url=http://politiken.dk/politik/article979013.ece |title=Fakta: Sådan ser den endelige spareplan ud |publisher=[[Politiken]] |date=25 May 2010 |accessdate=25 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527204121/http://politiken.dk/politik/article979013.ece |archive-date=27 May 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The cuts were designed to save the government 24 billion DKK.

===2011 election===

Rasmussen led [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] in the [[2011 Danish parliamentary election|September 2011 parliamentary election]]. He sought to renew the mandate of the [[rightwing]] coalition that had been in power since [[2001 Danish parliamentary election|2001]]. Although his party gained a seat, the opposition parties combined obtained more seats than the parties supporting the incumbent government. On 16 September 2011, Rasmussen tendered the government's resignation to Queen Margrethe. He remained in office as head of a [[caretaker government]] until his successor, [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]], was appointed on 3 October 2011.

===2015 election and return to government===

Rasmussen led [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] in the [[2015 Danish general election|June 2015 general election]]. His Blue Bloc won a tight election in which his party came third overall, winning Rasmussen the ability to form a government.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/jun/18/denmark-general-election-2015-results-live|title=Danish election: PM concedes defeat and resigns|first1=Aisha|last1=Gani|first2=Aisha|last2=Gani|date=18 June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2018|via=www.theguardian.com|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

All members of Lars Løkke Rasmussen's second Cabinet, composed solely of members of Venstre, were sworn in on 28 June 2015 in the Danish Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/politik/ECE7834142/Her-er-hele-Lars-L%C3%B8kkes-ministerhold/|title= Her er hele Lars Løkkes ministerhold |publisher= [[Jyllands-Posten]] |date= 28 June 2015 |accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref> {{As of|2015|July}}, his Cabinet consists of seventeen ministers.

In 2015, Rasmussen denied US Senator [[Bernie Sanders]]'s characterization of Denmark as [[socialist]], noting that the nation had a [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yglesias |first1=Matthew |title=Denmark's prime minister says Bernie Sanders is wrong to call his country socialist |url=https://www.vox.com/2015/10/31/9650030/denmark-prime-minister-bernie-sanders |accessdate=28 January 2020 |work=Vox |date=31 October 2015 |language=en}}</ref>

On 28 November 2016 Rasmussen presented [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen III Cabinet]], composed of members of [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]], [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] and [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]].

On 31 May 2018 it was announced that Denmark would be banning full-face veils.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/31/denmark-passes-law-banning-burqa-and-niqab|title=Denmark passes law banning burqa and niqab|last=Staff and agencies|date=31 May 2018|website=the Guardian}}</ref>

===2019 general election===

Though Venstre made the largest gains of any party in the [[2019 Danish general election|2019 general election]], support for the Danish People's Party and Liberal Alliance collapsed, costing Rasmussen his majority. With the result beyond doubt on election night, Rasmussen conceded defeat to the "red bloc" under the Social Democrats' [[Mette Frederiksen]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48535939|title=Denmark election: Social Democrats win as PM admits defeat|date=6 June 2019|access-date=6 June 2019}}</ref> On 6 June 2019, he announced his resignation. On 31 August 2019, Rasmussen resigned from his position as the chairman of [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre party]] following weeks of pressure from party members.<ref>{{cite news |last1=W |first1=Christian |title=Lars Løkke Rasmussen steps down as head of Venstre – The Post |url=http://cphpost.dk/news/lars-lokke-rasmussen-steps-down-as-head-of-venstre.html |accessdate=31 August 2019 |work=cphpost.dk |date=31 August 2019}}</ref>

==Controversies==

Rasmussen has on several occasions been accused of spending tax payer money on himself and his family. In the spring of 2008, he was accused by the media - essentially the Danish tabloid [[Ekstra Bladet]] - of having charged his official accounts with considerable expenses he should have paid himself, e.g. restaurants, cigarettes, taxis, and hotels, both as county mayor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/indland/politik/politikfakta/ECE2292001/fakta-her-er-loekkes-tre-sager-om-pengeforbrug-og-bilag/|title=Fakta: Her er Løkkes tre sager om pengeforbrug og bilag|author=|date=16 May 2014|website=politiken.dk|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> and as minister.

In 2013, the [[Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI)]] was criticized by two member countries for its financial management: Norway withheld $10 million in donations, citing excessive spending on flights and food by GGGI former Council Chairman Lars Løkke Rasmussen, and both Norway and Denmark demanded an Audit of the organization's finances before renewing support for 2014. Rasmussen was, as the chairman, accused of being greedy, while the other members of GGGI were not accused.<ref>{{cite web|title=Norway freezes aid to South Korean climate group|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/norway-freezes-aid-south-korean-climate-group|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>

In 2018, Rasmussen's wife was about to get fired and was called to a meeting with the leader of the school where she worked. Rasmussen, as his wife's civil assessor, came to the meeting, along with his bodyguards. His wife was fired at the meeting. The case resulted in criticism because Rasmussen's position as Prime Minister could be perceived as inappropriate pressure on the school leader and in similar meetings it is usually the [[union representative]] that functions as the civil assessor.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Janus Østergaard|author2=Per Mathiessen|title=Løkke troppede op på rektors kontor: Sólrun fyret|trans-title=Løkke showed up at rectors office: Sólrun fired|url=https://ekstrabladet.dk/nyheder/politik/danskpolitik/loekke-troppede-op-paa-rektors-kontor-solrun-fyret-som-laerer/7128604|publisher=Ekstra Bladet|date=24 April 2018|accessdate=26 June 2019}}</ref>
