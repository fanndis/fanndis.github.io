A '''pilgrimage''' is a journey, often into an unknown or foreign place, where a person goes in search of new or expanded meaning about their self, others, nature, or a higher good, through the experience. It can lead to a personal transformation, after which the [[pilgrim]] returns to their daily life.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pilgrimage in popular culture.|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1349126392|editor-last=Reader|editor-first=Ian|location=[Place of publication not identified]|pages=|oclc=935188979|name-list-format=|editor-last2=Walter|editor-first2=Tony}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Reframing pilgrimage : cultures in motion|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|others=Coleman, Simon, 1963-, Eade, John, 1946-, European Association of Social Anthropologists.|isbn=9780203643693|location=London|oclc=56559960}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Plate|first=S.

== Background ==
{{further|Religious tourism}}

Pilgrimages frequently involve a [[Travel|journey]] or search of [[morality|moral]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] significance. Typically, it is a journey to a [[shrine]] or other location of importance to a person's [[belief]]s and [[faith]], although sometimes it can be a metaphorical journey into someone's own beliefs.

Many religions attach spiritual importance to particular places: the place of birth or death of founders or saints, or to the place of their "calling" or spiritual awakening, or of their connection (visual or verbal) with the divine,  to locations where miracles were performed or witnessed, or locations where a deity is said to live or be "housed", or any site that is seen to have special spiritual powers. Such sites may be commemorated with shrines or temples that devotees are encouraged to visit for their own spiritual benefit: to be healed or have questions answered or to achieve some other spiritual benefit.

A person who makes such a journey is called a [[pilgrim]]. As a common human experience, pilgrimage has been proposed as a Jungian archetype by [[Wallace Clift]] and [[Jean Dalby Clift]].<ref>{{cite book|last1= Cleft |first1=Jean Darby|last2=Cleft|first2=Wallace|year=1996|title=The Archetype of Pilgrimage: Outer Action With Inner Meaning|publisher=The Paulist Press|isbn=0-8091-3599-X}}</ref>

The [[Holy Land]] acts as a focal point for the pilgrimages of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. According to a [[Stockholm University]] study in 2011, these [[pilgrim]]s visit the Holy Land to touch and see physical manifestations of their [[faith]], confirm their beliefs in the holy context with collective excitation, and connect personally to the Holy Land.<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael Sebastian |last=Metti |title=Jerusalem – the most powerful brand in history |url=http://www.metti-bronner.com/Jerusalem.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126124828/http://www.metti-bronner.com/Jerusalem.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 January 2020 |work=[[Stockholm University School of Business]] |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=1 July 2011 }}</ref>

The Christian priest Frank Fahey writes that a pilgrim is "always in danger of becoming a tourist", and vice versa since travel always in his view upsets the fixed order of life at home, and identifies eight differences between the two:<ref name="Fahey 2002">{{cite journal |last1=Fahey |first1=Frank |title=Pilgrims or Tourists? |journal=The Furrow |date=April 2002 |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=213–218 |jstor=27664505 }}</ref>

==Christianity==
{{Main|Christian pilgrimage}}
[[File:Jerusalem Holy Sepulchre BW 19.JPG|thumb|right|[[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]] according to tradition is the site where [[Jesus]] was [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]]]]

Christian pilgrimage was first made to sites connected with the birth, life, crucifixion and resurrection of [[Jesus]]. Aside from the early example of [[Origen]] in the third century, surviving descriptions of Christian pilgrimages to the [[Holy Land]] date from the 4th century, when pilgrimage was encouraged by church fathers including [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]], and established by [[Helena (empress)|Saint Helena]], the mother of [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine the Great]].<ref>Cain, A. (2010). Jerome's epitaphium paulae: Hagiography, pilgrimage, and the cult of Saint Paula. ''Journal of Early Christian Studies, 18''(1), 105-139. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1353/earl.0.0310</nowiki></ref>



The purpose of Christian pilgrimage was summarized by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in this way:{{quote|To go on pilgrimage is not simply to visit a place to admire its treasures of nature, art or history. To go on pilgrimage really means to step out of ourselves in order to encounter God where he has revealed himself, where his grace has shone with particular splendour and produced rich fruits of conversion and holiness among those who believe. Above all, Christians go on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, to the places associated with the Lord's passion, death and resurrection. They go to Rome, the city of the martyrdom of Peter and Paul, and also to Compostela, which, associated with the memory of Saint James, has welcomed pilgrims from throughout the world who desire to strengthen their spirit with the Apostle's witness of faith and love.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2010/november/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20101106_cattedrale-compostela.html | title=Apostolic Journey to Santiago de Compostela and Barcelona: Visit to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela (November 6, 2010) &#124; BENEDICT XVI}}</ref>}}

Pilgrimages were, and are, also made to [[Rome]] and other sites associated with the [[Twelve apostles|apostles]], [[saint]]s and [[Christian martyrs]], as well as to places where there have been [[Marian apparitions|apparitions]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. A popular pilgrimage journey is along the [[Way of St. James]] to the [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]], in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Spain, where the [[shrine]] of the apostle [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] is located. A combined pilgrimage was held every seven years in the three nearby towns of [[Maastricht]], [[Aachen]] and [[Kornelimünster Abbey|Kornelimünster]] where many important relics could be seen (see: [[Pilgrimage of the Relics, Maastricht]]). [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' recounts tales told by Christian pilgrims on their way to [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and the shrine of [[Thomas Becket]]. Marian pilgrimages remain very popular in [[Christian pilgrimage#Latin America|Latin America]].

==Sikhism==
[[File:Sikh pilgrim at the Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib) in Amritsar, India.jpg|thumb|Sikh pilgrim at the [[Harmandir Sahib|Harmandir Sahib (the Golden Temple)]] in [[Amritsar]], India.]]

Sikhism does not consider pilgrimage as an act of spiritual merit. Guru Nanak went to places of pilgrimage to reclaim the fallen people, who had turned ritualists. He told them of the need to visit that temple of God, deep in the inner being of themselves. According to him: "He performs a pilgrimage who controls the [[Five Thieves|five vices]]."<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/IntroductionToSikhism/page/n57 | title=Introduction to Sikhism: 100 Basic Questions and Answers on Sikh Religion and History | publisher=India Book House | last=Mansukhani | first=Gobind Singh | year=1968 | pages=60}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fU8BAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT178 | title=Sikhs Across Borders: Transnational Practices of European Sikhs | publisher=A&C Black | last=Myrvold | first=Kristina | year=2012 | pages=178 | isbn=9781441103581}}</ref>

Eventually, however, [[Amritsar]] and [[Harmandir Sahib|Harmandir Sahib (the Golden Temple)]] became the spiritual and cultural centre of the Sikh faith, and if a Sikh goes on pilgrimage it is usually to this place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://re-xs.ucsm.ac.uk/re/pilgrimage/sikhism.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011123234933/http://re-xs.ucsm.ac.uk/re/pilgrimage/sikhism.htm|archive-date=23 November 2001|title=Sikhism}}</ref>

The [[Panj Takht]] (Punjabi: ਪੰਜ ਤਖ਼ਤ) are the five revered [[gurdwaras]] in India that are considered the thrones or seats of authority of Sikhism and are traditionally considered a pilgrimage.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=5 February 2014|title=Special train to connect all five Takhats, first run on February 16|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Special-train-to-connect-all-five-Takhats-first-run-on-February-16/articleshow/29908402.cms}}</ref>
