'''General elections''' were held in [[Bangladesh]] on 27 February 1991. The [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) emerged as the largest party in parliament, winning 140 of the 300 directly-elected seats. The BNP formed a government with the support of the Islamic party [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh|Jamaat-e-Islami]], and on 20 March [[Khaleda Zia]] was sworn in for her first term as [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]].<ref name="IPU91">{{cite web |url=http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2023_91.htm |title=BANGLADESH: parliamentary elections Jatiya Sangsad, 1991|publisher= Inter-Parliamentary Union |accessdate=2 January 2019 }}</ref> 

The elections were described to be free and fair by many international observers, and it played a major role in solidifying Bangladeshi democracy in aftermath of the anti-government protests in late 1980s. Voter turnout was 55.4%.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |author1=Dieter Nohlen |author2=Florian Grotz |author3=Christof Hartmann |year=2001 |title=Elections in Asia: A data handbook |volume=Volume I |page=537 |isbn=0-19-924958-X|author1-link=Dieter Nohlen }}</ref>

==Background==
In 1990 a [[1990 Mass Uprising in Bangladesh|popular mass uprising]] led by future [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Ministers]] [[Khaleda Zia]] and [[Sheikh Hasina]] deposed the former [[Army Chief of Bangladesh|Army Chief]] [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] from the Presidency in December.<ref name="WORLD: Ershad Resigns in Bangladesh">{{cite news |title=WORLD: Ershad Resigns in Bangladesh |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-06/news/mn-8405_1_opposition-parties |work=Los Angeles Times |date=6 December 1990}}</ref> Ershad had assumed the Presidency in 1983 <ref name="NYT22">{{cite news |title=Bangladesh Leader in Military Regime Assumes Presidency |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/12/world/bangladesh-leader-in-military-regime-assumes-presidency.html |work=The New York Times |date=12 December 1983}}</ref> following a [[1982 Bangladesh coup d'état|coup d'état in 1982]].

==Electoral system==
The 330 members of the [[Jatiya Sangsad]] consisted of 300 directly elected seats using [[first-past-the-post voting]] in single-member constituencies,<ref>[http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2023_B.htm Electoral system] Inter-Parliamentary Union</ref> and an additional 30 seats [[Reserved_political_positions#Bangladesh|reserved]] for women.

==Results==
The elections saw the BNP win 140 seats, 11 short of a parliamentary majority. The BNP's primary rivals, the [[Awami League]], led by Sheikh Hasina, won only 88 seats. However, there was little difference between the two main parties in terms of the popular vote share, with BNP only receiving around 250,000 votes more than the Awami League.<ref name=":0" />

Of the directly elected 300 seats, only four were won by female candidates.<ref name="IPU91" /><ref name="WomenRep">{{cite journal |last1=Kumar Panday |first1=Pranab |date=1 September 2008 |title=Representation without Participation: Quotas for Women in Bangladesh |journal=International Political Science Review |volume= 29|issue= 4|pages= 489–512|doi= 10.1177/0192512108095724}}</ref> Following the elections, the BNP won 28 of the 30 reserved seats for women.<ref name="IPU91" />

==Aftermath==
In [[1991 Bangladeshi constitutional referendum|September 1991]] a constitutional referendum was held, which sought the transfer of executive powers from the [[President of Bangladesh|President]] to the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]], making the presidency largely a ceremonial role. The vote was overwhelmingly in favour of the [[Amendments to the Constitution of Bangladesh|constitutional amendments]] and the country returned to being a parliamentary democracy in line with its founding constitution.
