==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:What Alcohol Does to Your Body.webm|thumb|upright=1.6|Effects of alcohol on the body]]

The risk of alcohol dependence begins at low levels of drinking and increases directly with both the volume of alcohol consumed and a pattern of [[Binge drinking|drinking larger amounts on an occasion]], to the point of intoxication, which is sometimes called "binge drinking".

===Long-term misuse===
[[File:Possible long-term effects of ethanol.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Some of the possible [[long-term effects of ethanol]] an individual may develop. Additionally, in pregnant women, alcohol can cause [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].]]
Alcoholism is characterised by an increased [[Alcohol tolerance|tolerance]] to alcohol&nbsp;– which means that an individual can consume more alcohol&nbsp;– and [[physical dependence]] on alcohol, which makes it hard for an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role in decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking.<ref name="Hoffman-1996">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoffman PL, Tabakoff B | title = Alcohol dependence: a commentary on mechanisms | journal = Alcohol and Alcoholism | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 333–40 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8879279 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.alcalc.a008159 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, contributing to psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide.

=== Warning signs ===
Warning signs of alcoholism include the consumption of increasing amounts of alcohol and frequent intoxication, preoccupation with drinking to the exclusion of other activities, promises to quit drinking and failure to keep those promises, the inability to remember what was said or done while drinking (colloquially known as "blackouts"), personality changes associated with drinking, denial or the making of excuses for drinking, the refusal to admit excessive drinking, dysfunction or other problems at work or school, the loss of interest in personal appearance or hygiene, marital and economic problems, and the complaint of poor health, with loss of appetite, respiratory infections, or increased anxiety.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Volume Library|publisher=The Southwestern Company|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=RE9OwGtvDMACf}}|year=2009|isbn=978-0-87197-208-8|volume=1|location=Nashville, TN |page=29|chapter=Biology}}</ref>

====Physical====
=====Short-term effects=====
{{Main|Short-term effects of alcohol consumption}}

Drinking enough to cause a [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) of 0.03–0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible [[euphoria]] (a "happy" feeling), increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a [[Alcohol flush reaction|flushed, red appearance in the face]] and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes [[lethargy]], [[sedation]], balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC of 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes [[stupor]], unconsciousness, [[anterograde amnesia]], vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit ([[pulmonary aspiration]]) while unconscious) and [[respiratory depression]] (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a [[coma]] (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal [[alcohol poisoning]]. With all alcoholic beverages, [[drinking and driving|drinking while driving]], operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties for drunk driving.

Women develop long-term complications of alcohol dependence more rapidly than do men.

With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[physical dependence]]. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled [[synapse]] firing.

A [[Kindling (sedative-hypnotic withdrawal)|kindling effect]] also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to [[gene expression]].<ref name="Breese-2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Breese GR, Sinha R, Heilig M | title = Chronic alcohol neuroadaptation and stress contribute to susceptibility for alcohol craving and relapse | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 129 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–71 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20951730 | pmc = 3026093 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2010.09.007 }}</ref> Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.<ref name="pmid20148778" /> There are decision tools and questionnaires that help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal.

===Gender difference===
Based on combined data in the US from [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|SAMHSA]]'s 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use & Health, the rate of past-year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% of those who did not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).<ref>"Gender differences in alcohol use and alcohol dependence or abuse: 2004 or 2005."

====Alcoholism====
The term ''alcoholism'' is commonly used amongst laypeople, but the word is poorly defined. Despite the imprecision inherent in the term, there have been attempts to define how the word ''alcoholism'' should be interpreted when encountered. In 1992, it was defined by the [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence]] (NCADD) and [[American Society of Addiction Medicine|ASAM]] as "a primary, chronic disease characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking."<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Morse RM, Flavin DK | title = The definition of alcoholism. The Joint Committee of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence and the American Society of Addiction Medicine to Study the Definition and Criteria for the Diagnosis of Alcoholism | journal = JAMA | volume = 268 | issue = 8 | pages = 1012–4 | date = August 1992 | pmid = 1501306 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1992.03490080086030 }}</ref> [[MeSH]] has had an entry for "alcoholism" since 1999, and references the 1992 definition.<ref>{{MeshName|Alcoholism}}</ref>

The WHO calls ''alcoholism'' "a term of long-standing use and variable meaning", and use of the term was disfavored by a 1979 WHO expert committee.

In professional and research contexts, the term "alcoholism" is not currently favored, but rather alcohol abuse,  alcohol dependence, or alcohol use disorder are used.<ref name="DSM5" /><ref name="NIH2013" /> Talbot (1989) observes that alcoholism in the classical disease model follows a progressive course: if a person continues to drink, their condition will worsen. This will lead to harmful consequences in their life, physically, mentally, emotionally and socially.<ref name=Thomb1999>{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis L | name-list-style = vanc |title=Introduction To Addictive Behaviors 2ed|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Aze4azm9XkQCIntroduction}}|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=64–65}}</ref> Johnson (1980) explores the emotional progression of the addict's response to alcohol. He looks at this in four phases. The first two are considered "normal" drinking and the last two are viewed as "typical" alcoholic drinking.<ref name=Thomb1999/> Johnson's four phases consist of:
# Learning the mood swing. A person is introduced to alcohol (in some cultures this can happen at a relatively young age), and the person enjoys the happy feeling it produces.  At this stage, there is no emotional cost.
# Seeking the mood swing. A person will drink to regain that feeling of euphoria experienced in phase 1; the drinking will increase as more intoxication is required to achieve the same effect. Again at this stage, there are no significant consequences.
# At the third stage there are physical and social consequences, i.e., hangovers, family problems, work problems, etc. A person will continue to drink excessively, disregarding the problems.
# The fourth stage can be detrimental, as Johnson cites it as a risk for premature death. As a person now drinks to feel normal, they block out the feelings of overwhelming guilt, remorse, anxiety, and shame they experience when sober.<ref name=Thomb1999/>

====DSM and ICD====
In the United States, the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) is the most common diagnostic guide for substance use disorders, whereas most countries use the [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD) for diagnostic (and other) purposes. The two manuals use similar but not identical nomenclature to classify alcohol problems.

===Social barriers===
Attitudes and social stereotypes can create barriers to the detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This is more of a barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic.<ref name="Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870" >{{cite journal | vauthors = Blum LN, Nielsen NH, Riggs JA | title = Alcoholism and alcohol abuse among women: report of the Council on Scientific Affairs.

Other tests are sometimes used for the detection of alcohol dependence, such as the [[Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire]], which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the [[CAGE questionnaire]].

* High [[carbohydrate deficient transferrin]] (CDT)

With regard to alcoholism, BAC is useful to judge [[alcohol tolerance]], which in turn is a sign of alcoholism.<ref name=DSM5/> Electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities including [[hypokalemia]], [[hypomagnesemia]], [[hyponatremia]], [[hyperuricemia]], [[metabolic acidosis]], and [[respiratory alkalosis]] are common in alcoholics.<ref name="NIHHx" />

==Management==
Treatments are varied because there are multiple perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. Much of the treatment community for alcoholism  supports an abstinence-based [[zero tolerance]] approach; however, some prefer a [[Harm reduction|harm-reduction]] approach.<ref name="Gabbard"/>

===Detoxification===
{{Main|Alcohol detoxification}}
[[Alcohol detoxification]] or 'detox' for alcoholics is an abrupt stop of alcohol drinking coupled with the substitution of drugs, such as [[benzodiazepines]], that have similar effects to prevent [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]]. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome as well as those who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse.<ref name="Blondell-2005"/> Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations.<ref name="pmid20148778" /> Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.<ref name="Stavro-2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stavro K, Pelletier J, Potvin S | title = Widespread and sustained cognitive deficits in alcoholism: a meta-analysis | journal = Addiction Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 203–13 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 22264351 | doi = 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2011.00418.x | s2cid = 205401192 }}</ref>

Various forms of [[group therapy]] or [[psychotherapy]] can be used to deal with underlying psychological issues that are related to alcohol addiction, as well as provide relapse prevention skills. The mutual-help group-counseling approach is one of the most common ways of helping alcoholics maintain sobriety.<ref name="Morgan-Lopez-2006"/> [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] was one of the first organizations formed to provide mutual, nonprofessional counseling, and it is still the largest.

===Moderate drinking===

Rationing and moderation programs such as [[Moderation Management]] and DrinkWise do not mandate complete abstinence. While most alcoholics are unable to limit their drinking in this way, some return to moderate drinking. A 2002 US study by the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA) showed that 17.7 percent of individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent more than one year prior returned to low-risk drinking. This group, however, showed fewer initial symptoms of dependency.<ref name="DAWSON2005">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dawson DA, Grant BF, Stinson FS, Chou PS, Huang B, Ruan WJ | s2cid = 19679025 | title = Recovery from DSM-IV alcohol dependence: United States, 2001-2002 | journal = Addiction | volume = 100 | issue = 3 | pages = 281–92 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15733237 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00964.x | url = http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh29-2/131-142.htm | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719104620/http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh29-2/131-142.htm | df = dmy-all | archive-date = 19 July 2011 }}</ref>

A follow-up study, using the same subjects that were judged to be in remission in 2001–2002, examined the rates of return to problem drinking in 2004–2005.

* [[Naltrexone]] is a [[competitive antagonist]] for opioid receptors, effectively blocking the effects of [[endorphin]]s and [[opioid]]s.

* [[Disulfiram]] prevents the elimination of [[acetaldehyde]], a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself is the cause of many [[hangover]] symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting, uncomfortable hangover.

Several other drugs are also used and many are under investigation.
* [[Benzodiazepines]], while useful in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term can cause a worse outcome in alcoholism.

===Dual addictions and dependences===
Alcoholics may also require treatment for other psychotropic [[drug addiction]]s and [[drug dependence]]s. The most common dual dependence syndrome with alcohol dependence is [[benzodiazepine dependence]], with studies showing 10–20 percent of alcohol-dependent individuals had problems of dependence and/or misuse problems of benzodiazepine drugs such as [[diazepam]] or [[clonazepam]].

Alcohol has a long history of use and misuse throughout recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness boosted membership of the [[temperance movement]] and led to the [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of alcohol in the United States]], a nationwide constitutional ban on the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages that remained in place until 1933; this policy resulted in the decline of death rates from cirrhosis and alcoholism.<ref name="Blocker2006">{{cite journal | vauthors = Blocker JS | title = Did prohibition really work?

The various health problems associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for [[head injury|head injuries]], [[motor vehicle injuries]]s (27%), [[interpersonal violence]] (18%), [[suicides]] (18%), and [[epilepsy]] (13%).<ref>{{cite web |title=Alcohol and health |url=https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/infographic_alcohol_2018.pdf?ua=1 |website=WHO |access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref> Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends.<ref name="Jessica Kingsley Publishers">{{Cite book |last1=McCully |first1=Chris | name-list-style = vanc |title=Goodbye Mr. Wonderful.
