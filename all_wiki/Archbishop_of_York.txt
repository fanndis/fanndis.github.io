The '''Archbishop of York''' is a senior bishop in the [[Church of England]], second only to the [[archbishop of Canterbury]]. The archbishop is the [[diocesan bishop]] of the [[Diocese of York]] and the [[metropolitan bishop]] of the [[Province of York]], which covers the northern regions of England (north of the [[river Trent|Trent]]) as well as the [[Isle of Man]]. The archbishop of York is an ''ex officio'' member of the [[House of Lords]] and is styled ''[[primate (bishop)|Primate]] of England''; the archbishop of Canterbury is the "Primate of All England".

The archbishop's throne (''[[cathedra]]'') is in [[York Minster]] in central [[York]] and the official residence is [[Bishopthorpe Palace]] in the village of [[Bishopthorpe]] outside York. The current archbishop is [[Stephen Cottrell]], since the [[confirmation of bishops|confirmation of his election]] on 9 July 2020.<ref name="sc-cofe" />

==History==

===Roman===
{{see also|Early centers of Christianity#Roman Britain}}

There was a bishop in [[Eboracum]] ([[Roman Britain|Roman]] York) from very early times; during the Middle Ages, it was thought to have been one of the dioceses established by the [[legendary Kings of Britain|legendary]] [[Lucius of Britain|King&nbsp;Lucius]]. Bishops of York are known to have been present at the councils of [[Council of Arles|Arles]] ([[Eborius]]) and [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] (unnamed). However, this early Christian community was later [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|destroyed by the pagan Anglo-Saxons]] and there is no direct succession from these bishops to the post-Augustinian ones.

===Saxon, Viking and Medieval times===
The diocese was refounded by [[Paulinus of York|Paulinus]] (a member of [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine's mission]]) in the 7th century. Notable among these early bishops is [[Wilfrid]]. These early bishops of York acted as diocesan rather than archdiocesan prelates until the time of [[Ecgbert (bishop)|Ecgbert of York]],{{efn|Paulinus was appointed Archbishop of York by [[Pope Honorius I]] in 634, but the appointment was not effective since it occurred after Paulinus had fled from York and become Bishop of Rochester.<ref>Costambeys "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21626 Paulinus (St Paulinus) (d. 644)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>}} who received the [[pallium]] from [[Pope Gregory III]] in 735 and established metropolitan rights in the north. Until the Danish invasion the archbishops of Canterbury occasionally exercised authority, and it was not until the [[Norman Conquest]] that the archbishops of York asserted their complete independence.

At the time of the Norman invasion York had jurisdiction over [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|Worcester]], [[Diocese of Lichfield|Lichfield]], and [[Diocese of Lincoln|Lincoln]], as well as the dioceses in the Northern Isles and [[Scotland]]. But the first three sees just mentioned were taken from York in 1072. In 1154 the suffragan sees of the [[Diocese of Sodor and Man|Isle of Man]] and [[Orkney]] were transferred to the Norwegian [[archbishop of Nidaros]] (today's Trondheim), and in 1188 all the Scottish dioceses except [[Whithorn]] were released from subjection to York, so that only the dioceses of [[Diocese of Galloway|Whithorn]], [[Diocese of Durham|Durham]], and [[Diocese of Carlisle|Carlisle]] remained to the archbishops as suffragan sees. Of these, Durham was practically independent, for the [[county palatine|palatine]] bishops of that see were little short of sovereigns in their own jurisdiction. Sodor and Man were returned to York during the 14th century, to compensate for the loss of Whithorn to the Scottish Church.

Several of the archbishops of York held the ministerial office of [[Lord Chancellor]] of England and played some parts in affairs of state. As [[Peter Heylyn]] (1600–1662) wrote: "This see has yielded to the Church eight saints, to the Church of Rome three cardinals, to the realm of England twelve Lord Chancellors and two [[Lord Treasurer]]s, and to the north of England two [[Lord President of the North|Lord President]]s."  The bishopric's role was also complicated by [[Primacy of Canterbury|continued conflict over primacy with the see of Canterbury]].

===English Reformation===
At the time of the [[English Reformation]], York possessed three suffragan sees, Durham, Carlisle and Sodor and Man, to which during the brief space of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]]'s reign (1553–1558) may be added the Diocese of Chester, founded by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], but subsequently recognised by the Pope.

Until the mid 1530s (and from 1553-1558) the bishops and archbishops were in communion with the pope in Rome. This is no longer the case, as the archbishop of York, together with the rest of the [[Church of England]], is a member of the [[Anglican Communion]].

[[Walter de Grey]] purchased [[York Place]] as his London residence, which after the fall of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Thomas Wolsey]], was renamed the [[Palace of Whitehall]].

==Present==
The archbishop of York is the [[metropolitan bishop]] of the [[Province of York]] and is the junior of the two archbishops of the Church of England after the archbishop of Canterbury.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fryde|Greenway|Porter|Roy|1986}}, ''Handbook of British Chronology'', 3rd Edition, pp. 224, and 281–284.</ref> The See is currently occupied by [[Stephen Cottrell]] since 9 July 2020. 

The Province of York includes 10 Anglican dioceses in [[Northern England]]: [[Diocese of Blackburn|Blackburn]], [[Diocese of Carlisle|Carlisle]], [[Diocese of Chester|Chester]], [[Diocese of Durham|Durham]], [[Diocese of Liverpool|Liverpool]], [[Anglican Diocese of Manchester|Manchester]], 
[[Diocese of Newcastle|Newcastle]], [[Diocese of Sheffield|Sheffield]], [[Anglican Diocese of Leeds|Leeds]], and [[Diocese of York|York]], 
as well as 2 other dioceses: [[Diocese of Southwell|Southwell and Nottingham]] in the [[The Midlands|Midlands]] and [[Diocese of Sodor and Man|Sodor and Man]] covering the [[Isle of Man]].

==Archbishops who became Peers==
From 1660 to 1900, all Archbishops of York died in office (or were translated to Canterbury and died in that office). 

William Maclagan was the first <!--at least since 1640, probably ever--> to voluntarily resign his office in 1908, two years before his death. All of his successors who were not translated to Canterbury have also resigned their office before death, and (like all Archbishops of Canterbury) have been offered a peerage upon resignation,{{efn|William Temple died in office (as Archbishop of Canterbury), and Cyril Garbett died before his hereditary peerage could be created.}} except for John Sentamu in 2020:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/18/john-sentamu-peerage-snub-criticised-as-institutional-prejudice|title=John Sentamu peerage snub criticised as 'institutional prejudice'|first=Harriet|last=Sherwood|date=18 October 2020|accessdate=30 October 2020|work=The Guardian}}</ref>
