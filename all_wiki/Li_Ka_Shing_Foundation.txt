== The Third Son ==
Li Ka-shing considers the Li Ka Shing Foundation to be his "third son" and has pledged to donate one-third of his assets to support philanthropic projects. He has called for other Asian entrepreneurs to do the same, in the hope of altering the traditional notion of passing wealth through lineage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2006/1002/005.html#76e12ff3fe2c|title=Autumn of the Tigers|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>

The Li Ka Shing Foundation's story stretches back over three decades: Having grown up as a witness to suffering and illness, Li Ka-shing cultivated a compassion that set in motion the idea of establishing a charitable foundation.

== Mission ==
Li Ka Shing Foundation supports projects that promote social progress through expanding access to quality education and medical services and research, encouraging cultural diversity and community involvement.

Every project and every donation stems from Li Ka-shing's belief in the inherent value of each human life, regardless of race, class, or circumstance. He has devoted himself to helping others overcome the educational and physical barriers preventing them from achieving their potential.

== Three main focuses ==
* Encourage giving to nurture a new culture of philanthropy in Asia
* Support educational reform to create a paradigm shift that develops positive and sustainable change
* Support medical research and services to create a healthier world
