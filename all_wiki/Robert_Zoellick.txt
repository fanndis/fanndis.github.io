Zoellick served in various positions at the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] from 1985 to 1988.  He held positions including Counselor to [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary]] [[James Baker]], Executive Secretary of the Department, and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions Policy.

Bush]]'s presidency, Zoellick served with Baker, by then [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], as [[Under Secretary of State for Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs|Under Secretary of State for Economic and Agricultural Affairs]], as well as Counselor to the Department (Under Secretary rank).

James A. Baker's book "The Politics of Diplomacy" notes that Zoellick was one of Secretary Baker's "inner circle"..."combin(ing) Midwest common sense with policy sophistication." He was a "superb manager, policy analyst, and writer," Baker's "second brain" and "gatekeeper" and his "right hand man on NAFTA", the North American Free Trade Agreement. </ref The Politics of Diplomacy, James A.

Zoellick played a key role in the U.S.-WTO dispute against the [[European Union]] over [[genetically modified food]]s. The move sought to require that the European Union comply with international obligations to use science-based methods in continuing its moratorium on the approval of new genetically modified crops within the E.U.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/1pagesum_e/ds291sum_e.pdf | title = EC – Approval and Marketing of Biotech Products (DS291, 292, 293) | publisher = World Trade Organization}}</ref>

On January 7, 2005, Bush nominated Zoellick to be [[United States Deputy Secretary of State|Deputy Secretary of State]].<ref name = "Archives">{{citation | url = https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/01/20050107-6.html | title = President Nominates Ambassador Zoellick as Deputy Secretary of State | publisher = Archives.gov | date = 2005-01-07}}</ref> Zoellick assumed the office on February 22, 2005.  Zoellick agreed to serve as Deputy Secretary of State for not less than one year.

He was seen as a major architect of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush#Administration and cabinet|Bush administration]]'s policies regarding China. In an important speech September 21, 2005, Zoellick challenged China "to become a 'responsible stakeholder' in the international system, contributing more actively than in the past to help shore up the stability of the international system from which it ha[d] benefited so greatly."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The China Challenge|last=Christensen|first=Thomas|publisher=W.W.Norton & Company|year=2015|isbn=978-0-393-08113-8|pages=116}}</ref> In his "thoughtful and influential speech...Zoellick correctly argued that China had benefited greatly from the security and prosperity created by a stable, rule-based international economic and political order. But China had contributed a disproportionally small amount to maintain that order. Zoellick recognized that one of the great challenges facing diplomats in the United States, Europe, and Japan was to persuade China to do more to contribute to the global commons."<ref name=":0" />

In addition, Zoellick chartered a new direction in the [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]] peace process.<ref>Times Online (2006).

Retrieved June 20, 2006.</ref>  He made four trips to Sudan during his time as Deputy Secretary. He supported expanding a [[United Nations]] force in the Darfur region to replace [[African Union]] soldiers. He was involved in negotiating a peace accord between the government of Sudan and the [[Sudan Liberation Movement|Sudan Liberation Army]], signed in [[Abuja]], [[Nigeria]], in May 2006. Zoellick was seen by many as the administration's strongest voice on Darfur. His resignation catalyzed groups, such as the [[Genocide Intervention Network]], to praise his record on human rights issues.<ref name = "Intervention">{{citation | url = http://www.genocideintervention.net/network/pressroom/pressreleases/2006/06/19/385 | title = Press release | date = 2006-06-19 | publisher = Genocide Intervention Network}}</ref>

===President of the World Bank (2007–2012)===
On 30 May 2007, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] nominated Zoellick to replace [[Paul Wolfowitz]] as President of the World Bank.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6701865.stm | work=BBC News | title=US nominates new World Bank chief | date=May 30, 2007 | access-date=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

On 1 July 2007, Zoellick officially took office as President of the World Bank.

In a major speech at the National Press Club in Washington on October 10, 2007, Zoellick formulated what he described as "six strategic themes in support of the goal of an inclusive and sustainable globalization" which he proposed should guide the future work of the World Bank:

{{quote|First, the World Bank Group faces the challenge of helping to overcome poverty and spur sustainable growth in the poorest countries, especially in Africa...

Second, we need to address the special problems of states coming out of conflict or seeking to avoid the breakdown of the state...

Third, the World Bank Group needs a more differentiated business model for the middle income countries...

Fourth, the World Bank Group will need to play a more active role in fostering regional and global public goods that transcend national boundaries and benefit multiple countries and citizens...

Fifth, one of the most notable challenges of our time is how to support those seeking to advance development and opportunities in the Arab World...

Finally, while the World Bank Group has some of the attributes of a financial and development business, its calling is much broader.  It is a unique and special institution of knowledge and learning.  It collects and supplies valuable data.  Yet this is not a university – rather it is a "brain trust" of applied experience that will help us to address the five other strategic themes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=An Inclusive & Sustainable Globalization |format=Remarks by Robert B.

In "The Quiet Revolutionary who saved the World Bank"<ref.https://ft.com>, Financial Times commentator Sebastian Mallaby wrote that during his term Zoellick had "driven remarkable change... "adapt(ting)nimbly to the new world that globalisation has wreaked." Zoellick made advances in the use of open data, promoted senior officials from developing countries, addressed climate change, expanded aid during the financial crisis and obtained a capital increase, with developing countries providing more than half.<ref.Financial Times, Sebastian Mallaby opinion, February 16, 2012>

===Senior Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School (2012–present)===
After leaving the [[World Bank]], Zoellick took up the position as a senior fellow at [[Harvard Kennedy School]]'s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs on July 1, 2012.<ref>[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/press-releases/robert-zoellick-senior-fellow-belfer], Harvard Kennedy School website.

===Mitt Romney 2012 presidential campaign===

During the [[2012 United States presidential election]], Zoellick was appointed to lead the [[national security]] portion of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Mitt Romney]]'s transition team should he be elected [[President of the United States]].  Zoellick was considered a "heavyweight with impressive government experience"  who was likely to be part of any Romney administration "economic brain trust."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Fred|date=Summer 2012|title=Reading Romney's Mind|journal=The International Economy|pages=18–21, 56}}</ref>

Anonymous sources supposedly affiliated with Romney's transition project<ref name="secstatespec" /> claimed he hoped to be appointed as Romney's [[United States Secretary of State]]. This speculation was also fueled by ''[[Politico]]'' in August 2012, when it was reported that 'in diplomatic circles it is seen as very likely' that Zoellick "could get the top job" as Secretary of State in a potential Romney [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]].<ref>"Who's on the inside track for a Romney Cabinet" by MIKE ALLEN and JIM VANDEHEI, ''Politico'', August 28, 2012, [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80233.html Retrieved 2012-08-28]</ref> However, other anonymous "former Romney advisers" stated to ''Foreign Policy'' that foreign policy transition team members would not necessarily receive certain jobs in Romney's potential administration.<ref name="secstatespec">{{cite news|last=Rogin|first=Josh|title=The Romney national security transition team that might have been|url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/07/the_romney_national_security_transition_team_that_might_have_been|access-date=17 April 2013|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=7 November 2012}}</ref>  This speculation about Zoellick's possible role in a Romney administration was moot when Romney lost the election to incumbent Barack Obama.<ref name="secstatespec" />

I have had the good fortune to serve a number of different presidents and I know the importance of that job and I don't want him in the Oval Office."</ref [https://DW.com News and current affairs from Germany and around the world | DW]>

In Australia's New Left Review, [[Gavan McCormack|Gavan McCormack claimed]] that USTR Zoellick intervened during a 2004 [[privatization]] issue in Japanese [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]]'s re-election campaign.  McCormack wrote, "The office of the U.S. Trade Representative has played an active part in drafting the [[Japan Post]] privatization law. An October 2004 letter from Robert Zoellick to Japan's Finance Minister Takenaka Heizo, tabled in the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] on August 2, 2005, included a handwritten note from Zoellick commending Takenaka. Challenged to explain this apparent [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] intervention in a domestic matter, Koizumi merely expressed his satisfaction that Takenaka had been befriended by such an important figure… It is hard to overestimate the scale of the opportunity offered to U.S. and global finance capital by the privatization of the [[Postal savings system|Postal Savings System]]."<ref name = "McCormack">{{Cite journal | last = McCormack | first = Gavan | author-link = Gavan McCormack | title = Koizumi's coup | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 35 | publisher = New Left Review | date = September–October 2005  | url = https://newleftreview.org/II/35/gavan-mccormack-koizumi-s-coup }}</ref>

In a January 2000 ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' <Vol. 79 No.1>essay entitled "Campaign 2000: A Republican Foreign Policy," he noted five Republican principles (respect for power, building and sustaining coalitions and alliances, recognizing common interests with international agreements and institutions, embracing new technologies for global politics and security, and the continuing presence of bad actors.  "[T]here is still evil in the world—people who hate America and the ideas for which it stands. Today, we face enemies who are hard at work to develop [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[Biological warfare|biological]], and [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapons]], along with the missiles to deliver them. The United States must remain vigilant and have the strength to defeat its enemies. People driven by enmity or by a need to dominate will not respond to reason or goodwill.

In the lead-up to the [[2010 G-20 Seoul summit]] and in the immediate wake of the U.S. [[United States elections, 2010|elections]] and subsequent [[Federal Reserve System|Fed]] [[quantitative easing|QE2]] monetary-policy move, Zoellick published a suggestion<ref>Oliver, Chris, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/world-bank-chief-calls-for-new-gold-standard-2010-11-07?dist=afterbell "World Bank chief calls for new gold standard"], ''[[Marketwatch]]'', November 7, 2010.
