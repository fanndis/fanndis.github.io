'''Trump Tower''' is a 58-floor, {{convert|664|ft|m|-tall|adj=mid}} mixed-use [[skyscraper]] at 721–725 [[Fifth Avenue]], between [[List of numbered streets in Manhattan|56th]] and [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Streets]], in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Trump Tower serves as the headquarters for [[the Trump Organization]]. Additionally, it houses the [[penthouse apartment|penthouse]] condominium residence of the building's namesake and developer, [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Donald Trump]], who is also a businessman and real estate developer. Several members of the [[Trump family]] also live, or have resided, in the building. The tower stands on a plot where the [[flagship store]] of department-store chain [[Bonwit Teller]] was formerly located.

[[Der Scutt]] of [[Swanke Hayden Connell Architects|Poor, Swanke, Hayden & Connell]] designed Trump Tower, and Trump and the Equitable Life Assurance Company (now the [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company]]) developed it. Although it is in one of Midtown Manhattan's [[Special-use permit|special zoning districts]], the tower was approved because it was to be built as a [[mixed-use development]]. Trump was permitted to add more stories to the tower because of the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] on the ground floor. There were controversies during construction, including the destruction of historically important sculptures from the Bonwit Teller store; Trump's alleged underpaying of contractors; and a lawsuit that Trump filed because the tower was not tax-exempt.

Construction on the building began in 1979. The atrium, apartments, offices, and stores opened on a staggered schedule from February to November 1983. At first, there were few tenants willing to move in to the commercial and retail spaces; the residential units were sold out within months of opening. Since 2016, the tower has seen a large increase in visitation because of [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|Trump's 2016 presidential campaign]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|subsequent election]]—both his 2016 and [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|2020]] campaigns were headquartered in the tower.

===Context===

[[Donald Trump]]—the son of New York City developer [[Fred Trump]]—had envisioned building a tower at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue in [[Manhattan]] since childhood, but formulated plans to develop the site only in the mid-1970s, when he was in his thirties.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=15}} At the time, the [[Bonwit Teller]] [[flagship store]], an architecturally renowned building built in 1929, occupied the lot.<ref name="Gray3Oct">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/realestate/fifth-avenue-bonwit-teller-opulence-lost.html|title=The Store That Slipped Through the Cracks|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=October 3, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907210338/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/realestate/fifth-avenue-bonwit-teller-opulence-lost.html|archive-date=September 7, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The site was next to [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany's]] flagship store on 57th Street, which Trump considered the city's best real-estate property.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Builder Who Trumps His Peers|website=Chicago Tribune|date=February 9, 1987|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-02-09/features/8701100872_1_donald-trump-trump-parc-trump-tower|access-date=November 29, 2017}}</ref> Approximately twice every year, Trump contacted Bonwit Teller's parent company, [[Genesco]], to ask whether they were willing to sell Bonwit Teller's flagship store. Trump said the first time he contacted Genesco, "they literally laughed at me."{{sfn|Tuccille|1985|p=150}} Genesco continued to decline his offers and, according to Trump, "they thought I was kidding."{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=15}}

In 1977, [[John Hanigan]] became the new chairman of Genesco.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Genesco Chief Aims to Consolidate Divisions|website=The New York Times|date=May 3, 1977|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/03/archives/new-genesco-chief-aims-to-consolidate-divisions.html|access-date=November 29, 2017}}</ref> He looked to sell off some assets to pay debts, and Trump approached him with an offer to buy the Bonwit Teller building.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=15–16}} In February 1979, Genesco sold off many of the Bonwit Teller locations to [[Allied Stores]], and sold the brand's flagship building to the [[Trump Organization]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Barmash|first=Isadore|title=45 Genesco Shops to Go To Allied|website=The New York Times|date=February 6, 1979|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/06/archives/45-genesco-shops-to-go-to-allied-bonwits-erratic-record-allied.html|access-date=November 29, 2017}}</ref> At the time, the [[Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States]] owned the land,<ref>{{cite web|last=Barmash|first=Isadore|title=45 Genesco Shops to Go To allied|website=The New York Times|date=February 6, 1979|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/06/archives/45-genesco-shops-to-go-to-allied-bonwits-erratic-record-allied.html|access-date=November 29, 2017}}</ref> while Genesco had a long-term lease on the land, with 29 years remaining. If Trump were to buy the land, his tower's ownership could be transferred to Equitable in 2008, once the lease expired.{{sfn|Tuccille|1985|p=150}}{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=22}} Equitable initially refused to sell the land to Trump, but the Trump Organization bought the lease instead, and Equitable exchanged the land in return for a 50% stake in the construction project itself. This was more profitable for Equitable, since they were getting only $100,000 per year from Genesco for the use of the land, while a single condominium in the tower could be sold for millions of dollars.{{sfn|Tuccille|1985|p=151}}{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|pp=22–23}} Trump also bought the [[air rights]] around Tiffany's flagship store{{sfn|Tuccille|1985|p=150}}<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":18"/> to prevent another developer from tearing down the store and building a taller building.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=23}}

Trump then needed to convince the [[New York City Department of City Planning]], [[Manhattan Community Board 5]], and the [[New York City Board of Estimate]] to [[Zoning|rezone]] the area for his planned tower.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=23}} In 1979, the New York Committee for a Balanced Building Boom had opposed the planned rezoning over fears Fifth Avenue's character would be changed by the construction of skyscrapers.<ref name=":1" /> Trump later said a positive review of the building by the famed architectural critic [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] had played a part in securing the support of some of the more skeptical members on each committee.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=25}} The deal attracted some criticism from the media. A writer for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine said the approval of Trump Tower has "legitimized a pushy kid nobody took seriously,"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-UCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26|title=Trumping the Town|last=Brenner|first=Marie|date=November 17, 1980|publisher=New York Media, LLC|pages=27|language=en}}</ref> while ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that Trump combined "a huckster's flair for hyperbole with a shrewd business and political sense," and ''[[The Village Voice]]'' said Trump "turn[s] political connections into private profits at public expense."{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=25}}

===Planning===

The Trump Organization closed Bonwit Teller's flagship store in May 1979,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/05/archives/bonwit-seeks-to-return-to-a-fifth-avenue-site-favorable-action.html|title=Bonwit Seeks to Return To a Fifth Avenue Site|last=Fowler|first=Glenn|date=June 5, 1979|website=The New York Times|access-date=November 29, 2017}}</ref> and the store was demolished by 1980.<ref name="Gray3Oct" /> Trump hired [[Der Scutt]], the architect of Trump Tower, in July 1978, a year before the Bonwit Teller site was purchased. Scutt had collaborated with Trump before to develop [[Grand Hyatt New York]] and several other projects. The architect initially proposed a design similar to Boston's [[John Hancock Tower]], but Trump objected strongly.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=28}} He preferred a building that was both expensive and very tall, with a design critics and potential tenants would approve of. The real-estate mogul later stated that "the marble in Trump Tower would cost more than the entire rent from one of my buildings in Brooklyn."{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=29}}

Two major factors affected Trump Tower's construction. One was the decision to build it around a concrete [[Framing (construction)|frame]], in contrast to many other skyscrapers, which were built on steel frames. Scutt said a concrete frame was easier to build and was more rigid than a steel frame was.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=35}} More specifically, it employed a concrete [[tube (structure)|tube]] structure,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Seinuk|first1=Ysrael A.|last2=Cantor|first2=Irwin G.|title=Trump Tower: Concrete Satisfies Architectural, design, and construction demands|journal=Concrete International|date=March 1984|volume=6|issue=3|pages=59–62|url=http://www.concrete.org/Publications/InternationalConcreteAbstractsPortal.aspx?m=details&i=9220|language=en|issn=0162-4075}}</ref> which had been pioneered by [[Bangladeshi-American]] structural engineer [[Fazlur Rahman Khan]] in the 1960s.<ref name=Ali>{{Cite journal|last=Ali|first=Mir M.|title=Evolution of Concrete Skyscrapers: from Ingalls to Jin Mao|journal=Electronic Journal of Structural Engineering|volume=1|issue=1|year=2001|pages=2–14|url=http://www.ejse.org/Archives/Fulltext/200101/01/20010101.htm|access-date=2008-11-30}}</ref>

The other was the decision to design Trump Tower as a mixed-use building with retail, office, and residential units.<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/01/archives/60-story-tower-sought-for-bonwitteller-site-mixeduse-building.html|title=60‐Story Tower Sought For Bonwit‐Teller Site|last=Wedemeyer|first=Dee|date=March 1, 1979|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=August 11, 2016}}</ref> Originally, Trump only wanted to build an office building on the site, but the plot was located in a special [[Zoning in the United States|zoning]] district, which specified height limits for most office towers in the area. However, mixed-use towers with public space were exempt from the height limit.<ref name=":6"/>{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=29}} The Trump Organization built a five-story, {{convert|15,000|ft2|m2|adj=on}} [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]], which was legally designated a "public space" according to city code, in exchange for permission to add twenty stories to the planned tower.<ref name=":18" /> The Trump Organization also constructed [[Terrace (building)|terraces]] on the building's [[setback (architecture)|setbacks]],<ref name=":6" /> as well as a [[Arcade (architecture)|pedestrian arcade]] at ground level through the middle of the block, which connected to [[IBM]]'s [[590 Madison Avenue]] tower to the east.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":18">{{Cite news|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20160417/REAL_ESTATE/160419898/trumps-lost-empire-the-deal-that-marked-the-donalds-turn-from-new-york-real-estate|title=Trump's lost Empire: The deal that marked the Donald's turn from New York real estate|last=Elstein|first=Aaron|newspaper=Crain's New York Business|access-date=January 28, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328234446/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20160417/REAL_ESTATE/160419898/trumps-lost-empire-the-deal-that-marked-the-donalds-turn-from-new-york-real-estate|archive-date=March 28, 2017}}</ref> At the time, the building was the only skyscraper on Fifth Avenue with its own retail space.<ref name=":6" />

As originally planned, the tower was to have 60 stories consisting of 13 office floors, 40 [[condominium]] floors, and two floors for mechanical uses, but this was later amended.<ref name=":6"/> The base was to be made of limestone, while the building's elevators were to be in a separate glass structure outside the main tower.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=30}} The final plan called for the building to contain 58 stories.<ref name="nymag.com">{{cite magazine|url=http://nymag.com/news/articles/shortlist/trump/|title=New York Metro Short List: Trump's Edifice Complex|last=Cheshes|first=Jay|date=November 30, 2001|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|access-date=August 11, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624201201/http://nymag.com/news/articles/shortlist/trump/|archive-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref><ref name="NYTimes-View-19790701"/> The lowest six floors were to be occupied by the atrium, followed by 13 office floors above it, and 39 condominium floors above the office floors.<ref name=":31">{{Cite news|url=http://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/politics/a12015156/trump-tower-new-york-facts/|title=Everything You Should Know About Trump Tower|date=August 16, 2017|work=Town & Country|access-date=October 20, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

While creating the final design for Trump Tower, Scutt studied the designs of other skyscrapers, almost all having a similar [[massing|architectural form]]. To make Trump Tower stand out from the "boxy" [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] buildings being erected at the time, Scutt designed the tower as a 28-faced edifice with an "inverted pyramid of cubes" at the base.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|pp=32–33}} This design received mixed reviews from critics: although it was widely praised as creative, many reviewers also believed the tower could be covered in masonry to blend in with neighboring buildings, or that its height should be reduced for the same reason.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=36}} The city ultimately accepted this design.<ref name="NYTimes-View-19790701">{{cite web|last=Huxtable|first=Ada Louise|title=Architecture View|website=The New York Times|date=July 1, 1979|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/01/archives/architecture-view-a-new-york-blockbuster-of-superior-design.html|access-date=December 18, 2017}}</ref>

===Construction===

HRH Construction was hired as the contractor on Trump Tower.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=}} The company would go on to build many of Trump's other real-estate developments.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE MANAGER BEHIND THE MOGUL|website=Washington Post|date=September 23, 1989|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/realestate/1989/09/23/the-manager-behind-the-mogul/56c7cfba-261b-4c4b-a197-557f40ae4b89/|access-date=December 19, 2017}}</ref> HRH hired several dozen subcontractors to work on different aspects of the building.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=100}} [[Barbara Res]], who had worked on some of Trump's other projects,<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/25/donald-trump-s-tower-boss.html|title=Trump's Female Tower Boss Talks About His Half-Billion Dollar Debt, Womanizing, and How He Learned to be Shameless|last=Daly|first=Michael|date=February 25, 2016|newspaper=The Daily Beast|access-date=August 11, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809092236/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/25/donald-trump-s-tower-boss.html|archive-date=August 9, 2016}}</ref> was hired as the construction executive in October 1980.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=75}}<ref name=":4" /> She had previously worked for HRH Construction during the building of the [[Citigroup Center]] and the Grand Hyatt.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=74}} Res was the first woman assigned to oversee a major New York City construction site.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4">Res, Barbara A. (July 2013) ''All Alone on the 68th Floor: How one Woman Changed the Face of Construction''. Createspace Publishing, New Jersey.</ref> She was often ignored by subcontractors and suppliers who were new to the project, as they thought the person in charge of construction was a man.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=75}}

The head superintendent of the project was Anthony "Tony Raf" Rafaniello,{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=95}} who worked for HRH Construction.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=97}} He was in charge of coordinating construction based on the site's blueprints.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=97}} Rafaniello was supported by five assistant superintendents, including Jeff Doynow, who was one of the first "concrete supervisors" to be hired for the construction of a skyscraper.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=111}} After Rafaniello was hired for the Trump Tower project in September 1980, he spent a week planning a three-phase construction schedule.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=100}} Once the subcontractors were hired, Rafaniello made sure they met once a week to ensure they were working on the same phase.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=101}}

Trump Tower's proposed mixed-use status posed obstacles during construction since there were different regulations for residential, commercial, and retail spaces.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=76}} Several prospective commercial and residential tenants requested custom-made features, including the installation of a swimming pool for one unit, and the removal of a wall with utilities inside it for another.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=76}} Trump's then-wife, [[Ivana Trump]], was involved in selecting some of the tower's minor details.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=100}} Donald Trump and Res agreed to fulfill many of these requests, but they did not always agree on matters of design. In one case, Trump so hated the marble slabs at some of the tower's corners that he demanded they be removed completely, even at great cost; he eventually decided bronze panels should be placed over the marble, but Res later said she refused to buy them.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|pp=77–78}}

Trump Tower was one of the first skyscrapers with a concrete frame,{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=76}} along with Chicago's [[One Magnificent Mile]] engineered by [[Fazlur Rahman Khan]] in 1983.<ref name=Ali/> The contractors had to complete a floor before they started erecting the floor above it. Concrete was more expensive in New York City than anywhere else in the United States, which raised the construction costs.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=119}} All the floors above the 20th used a roughly similar design, and each of these floors could be completed within two days. However, the floors below the 20th floor were all different, so each took several weeks to erect.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|pp=120–121}} Trump Tower was [[topped out]] by July 1982, two-and-a-half years after the start of construction.<ref>{{cite web|title=POSTINGS; Tower Topped Off|work=The New York Times|date=July 11, 1982|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/11/realestate/postings-tower-topped-off.html|access-date=December 19, 2017}}</ref>

Originally, it was estimated the tower would cost $100 million to build.<ref name=":6"/> The total cost ended up being approximately twice that; this included $125 million in actual construction costs and $75 million for other expenditures such as insurance.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=16}}

====Incidents====

Trump Tower had a low number of worker fatalities during construction.

====Destruction of Bonwit Teller Building features====

The art dealer [[Robert Miller (art dealer)|Robert Miller]] owned a gallery across Fifth Avenue from the Bonwit Teller Building.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=42}} When Miller heard the building was to be demolished, he contacted [[Penelope Hunter-Stiebel]], a curator at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. In December 1979, Stiebel and Trump agreed that the [[Art Deco]] limestone bas-relief sculptures of semi-nude goddesses on the Bonwit Teller Building's facade, as well as the massive ornate {{convert|15|by|25|ft}} grille above the store's entrance, would be removed and donated to the Metropolitan Museum.<ref name="Gray3Oct" /><ref name="Leccese1July">{{cite news|work=Preservation News|url=http://prn.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell-prn?a=d&d=PRN19800701.2.10&e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN------|title=New York City Trumped: Developer Smashes Panels|first=Michael|last=Leccese|date=July 1, 1980|access-date=August 22, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906230243/http://prn.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell-prn?a=d&d=PRN19800701.2.10&e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN------|archive-date=September 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name="first">{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2016/03/18/trumps-first-media-controversy-is-a-really-great-story/|title=Trump's first media controversy is a really great story—The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram|date=March 18, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519045923/http://www.pressherald.com/2016/03/18/trumps-first-media-controversy-is-a-really-great-story/|archive-date=May 19, 2016}}</ref> Miller had appraised the sculptures at between $200,000 and $250,000.<ref name="Leccese1July"/>{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=42}} In February 1980, Trump wrote a letter to an official at the museum, in which he stated, "Our contractor plans to begin demolition on the exterior of the building in approximately three to four weeks. He has been instructed to save these artifacts and take all necessary measures to preserve them."{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=42}} Every week, the Trump Organization and Stiebel would meet to discuss the transport of the sculptures. However, Stiebel later said the Trump Organization never seemed to be able to agree on a specific date for their transport, and the organization had repeatedly dismissed her concerns about not having received the letter.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=43}}

On April 16, 1980, the grille and sculptures were removed from the building. They were set to be transported to a junkyard and destroyed because, according to Trump, there were general hazard concerns, expense, and a possible 10-day construction delay due to the difficulty of removing them.<ref name="Gray3Oct" /><ref name="Leccese1July" /> Stiebel rode by taxicab to the building site and attempted to pay the workmen for the sculptures, but she was rebuffed.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Michael Kranish|author2=Marc Fisher|title=Trump Revealed: An American Journey of Ambition, Ego, Money, and Power|date=August 23, 2016|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-5011-5577-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/trumprevealedame0000kran/page/86 86]|title-link=Trump Revealed}}</ref> The workers in charge of demolition told her she could make an appointment to go see the sculptures, but they then canceled several appointments that Stiebel made.{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=43}} The workers later told her the building's decorative grille had been transported to a [[New Jersey]] warehouse,{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=43}}<ref name="Leccese1July" /> but it was never recovered, and on May 28, Stiebel was informed the grille had been "lost".{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=44}}<ref name="Leccese1July" /> On June 5, the sculptures were destroyed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Developer Scraps Bonwit Sculptures; Builder Orders Bonwit Art Deco Sculptures Destroyed|work=The New York Times|date=June 6, 1980|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/06/06/120997165.pdf|access-date=December 19, 2017}}</ref>{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=44}} Stiebel had received notice of the sculptures' pending demolition, but by the time she reached the Trump Tower site, the workmen told her they had been ordered to "destroy it all."{{sfn|Rubin|Mandell|1984|p=44}} Trump later acknowledged he had personally ordered the destruction of the sculptures and grille.<ref name="first" /> Trump said these "so-called Art Deco sculptures, which were garbage by the way," had been informally appraised by three different individuals as "not valuable," and they had pegged the sculptures' value at $4,000 to $5,000.

====Unpaid laborers====

In 1983, a class-action lawsuit was filed against the Trump Organization concerning unpaid pension and medical obligations to labor unions whose members helped build the towers.<ref name="Raab14June" /> Trump had paid $774,000 to a window-cleaning company that employed undocumented Polish immigrants during the renovation of an adjoining building.<ref name="NYT28nov17">{{cite news|last1=Bagli|first1=Charles V.|title=Trump Paid Over $1 Million in Labor Settlement, Documents Reveal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/nyregion/trump-tower-illegal-immigrant-workers-union-settlement.html|access-date=November 28, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=November 28, 2017}}</ref> According to the laborers, they were paid $4 an hour ({{Inflation|US|4|1983|fmt=eq}}) for 12-hour shifts, and were not told about [[asbestos]] in the under-construction structure.<ref name="NYT28nov17" />

''Eater'' reviewed the three other establishments as well, finding them to be commonplace compared to Trump Tower's stature. The ice cream was described as "almost too soft to be scooped," and the cafe contained food such as a "rubbery and overcooked" hamburger patty and some "inedible" steak fries. The reviewers at ''Eater'' also wrote that the bar offered a small, overpriced drink menu and snacks that "do little to affirm the luxury that the place aspires to."<ref name=":33" /> ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine also reviewed the bar and found it to be overpriced, with "a strong pour of watered-down vodka and a few Manzanilla olives" costing twenty dollars.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/ezkp4w/getting-drunk-at-the-trump-tower-bar-was-the-worst-night-of-my-life|title=I Got Drunk at the Trump Bar in Trump Tower and It Was Predictably Terrible|last=Pollack|first=Hilary|date=January 20, 2017|work=Munchies|access-date=October 20, 2017|publisher=Vice|language=en-us}}</ref> ''New York'' magazine, reviewing the cafe, found the food to be "safe classics" that contrasted with the cafe's grandeur.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/trump-tower-cafe/|title=Trump Café|last=Shallwani|first=Pervaiz|website=New York}}</ref>

However, he criticized the "hyperactive" exterior of the tower, contrasting it with Tiffany's "serene," solid facade next door, as well as the narrowness of passageways within the atrium, saying it created "little room for milling or casual strolling."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/04/arts/architecture-atrium-of-trump-tower-is-a-pleasant-surprise.html|title=ARCHITECTURE: ATRIUM OF TRUMP TOWER IS A PLEASANT SURPRISE|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|date=April 4, 1983|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 20, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Before the atrium opened, [[Ada Louise Huxtable]], an architectural critic for the ''New York Times'', said the building was a "dramatically handsome structure."<ref name=":21" /> However, she reversed her opinion on the opening of the atrium, saying the tower was really a "monumentally undistinguished one" and saying her earlier comments had been taken out of context.<ref name=":23">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/06/magazine/l-donald-trump-s-tower-170724.html|title=DONALD TRUMP'S TOWER|date=May 6, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=January 31, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123050559/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/06/magazine/l-donald-trump-s-tower-170724.html|archive-date=January 23, 2017}}</ref> Huxtable also called the atrium a "pink-marble maelstrom" and publicly requested in one of her editorials that Trump remove one of her quotes from his building's lobby.<ref name=":23" /> Another writer for that newspaper described the tower in 1984 as "preposterously lavish" and "showy, even pretentious."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/magazine/the-expanding-empire-of-donald-trump.html|title=THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP|last=Geist|first=William E.|date=April 8, 1984|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 20, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Architect [[Gregory Stanford]] described the atrium as "pretty horrible."<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Great Indoors|last=Soter|first=Tom|date=January 16, 1993|work=Newsday}}</ref> By contrast, a review from 1983 had predicted it could be New York City's "most pleasant interior public space" to be built in recent history.<ref name=":10" />

The fifth edition of the ''[[AIA Guide to New York City]]'', published in 2010, described Trump Tower as a "fantasyland for the affluent shopper" hidden by "folded glass," with the Trump theme evident throughout the building. Comparing the building's interior design to [[alcoholic drink]] brands, the authors wrote that the design was less like a high-end "[[Veuve Clicquot]]" and more like a generic "[[malt liquor]]."<ref>{{Cite aia5|page=336}}</ref>
