==History==
[[File:TCBY.PNG|thumb|A TCBY in 2006 using the former logo in Lynnwood, Washington.]]

In 1981, Frank D. Hickingbotham opened the first TCBY in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. TCBY began franchising the following year, and by 1984 there were over 100 stores.

Prior to 1984, the company's name was "This Can't Be Yogurt," but a lawsuit from a competitor, [[I Can't Believe It's Yogurt!]], forced TCBY to create a new name from its initials, eventually using "The Country's Best Yogurt".<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2099747/ |author= Seth Stevenson |title= Alphabet Soup: Now what does KFC stand for? |date= May 3, 2004 |magazine= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate= November 16, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1154/is_n9_v76/ai_6587882/ |author= Michael Barreir |title= Cold product, hot company: TCBY frozen yogurt |publisher= BNET |accessdate= November 5, 2010 |year=1988}}</ref> TCBY began co-branding with [[Taco Bell]], [[McDonald's]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], and [[Burger King]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|author=Williams, Jeff|date=January 20, 1997|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TCBY+tries+to+thaw+profits%3B+overhaul+includes+co-branding,+efficient...-a019296959|title=TCBY tries to thaw profits; overhaul includes co-branding, efficient distribution.

In 1991 TCBY moved into the tallest building in Arkansas, [[Simmons Tower]] located in downtown Little Rock, and the building was renamed The TCBY Tower until 2000 when TCBY vacated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/122472/simmons-tower-little-rock-ar-usa |title=Simmons Tower, Little Rock &#124; 122472 |publisher=Emporis |accessdate=2017-11-16}}</ref>

[[Mrs. Fields]] acquired TCBY in early 2000 and became Mrs. Fields Famous Brands.<ref>{{cite news| last = Cooke| first = Lynne| title = Mrs. Fields to Buy TCBY|newspaper = Lakeland Ledger| date = February 11, 2000}}</ref> The combined company relocated headquarters to [[Broomfield, Colorado]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/money/54051421-79/company-fields-casey-denver.html.csp |title=Mrs. Fields moving HQ from Utah to Denver |work=The Salt Lake Tribune |date=May 4, 2012 |accessdate=2019-10-28}}</ref>
 
In 2001, there were 1,777 TCBY locations across the country. By 2011, after several waves of closings, there were 405.

==Products and promotions==
TCBY offers [[frozen yogurt]] in a variety of flavors. The chain typically serves hard scooped and soft serve yogurt, while newer concept stores only offer soft serve. The new concept stores follow a self-service model, with customers being charged by weight.<ref>[http://www.qsrmagazine.com/articles/exclusives/0710/tcby-1.phtml  TCBY unveils a new self-serve prototype ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105174108/http://www.qsrmagazine.com/articles/exclusives/0710/tcby-1.phtml |date=2011-01-05 }} Retrieved February 6, 2011</ref> Soft serve yogurt comes in Golden Vanilla, Chocolate, and White Chocolate Mousse flavors which are available daily, in addition to various rotating flavors. TCBY also serves drinks such as Berriyo yogurt [[smoothies]] and Frappe Chillers.

In September 2010, TCBY announced the test launch of breakfast and lunch meal replacement bowls, parfaits and smoothies made from non-frozen "fresh" [[yogurt]] called Yovana-Simply Yogurt in two self-service company stores in its headquarters of [[Salt Lake City]].<ref>{{cite news| last =Liddle| first =Alan|title = TCBY launches breakfast, lunch product test| publisher = NRN.com| date = September 28, 2010| url = http://www.nrn.com/article/tcby-launches-breakfast-lunch-product-test}}</ref>

2010 also saw the opening of a prototype store in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], operating under a different business model. Instead of customers ordering and being served in a traditional fashion, they serve themselves using any combination of available yogurt flavors, add their own mix of fruit or candy toppings, and pay by the ounce.

In May 2011, TCBY launched Super Fro-Yo, a reformulated version of its yogurt with a more nutrient-rich profile. The company brought down the fat content of its yogurt to below 2 percent, so it can be labeled [[low fat]]. On January 10, 2012, TCBY launched a [[Greek Yogurt|Greek]] [[frozen yogurt]] product.<ref>{{cite news| title = TCBY to serve up Greek Fro- Yo|newspaper = USA Today| date = January 10, 2012}}</ref>  TCBY is the first [[frozen yogurt]] chain to offer Greek frozen yogurt.<ref>{{cite news| title = In a First, TCBY Adds Greek Fro Yo To Lineup| publisher = QSR Magazine| date = January 10, 2012| url = http://www.qsrmagazine.com/news/first-tcby-adds-greek-fro-yo-lineup}}</ref>

Every year, TCBY offers mothers across the nation a free [[frozen yogurt]] on [[Mother's Day]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcby.com/external/uploads_tiny/files/tcby-md-release-2009_v2.pdf |title=Mother's Day Givaway |work=TCBY press release |accessdate=May 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521040648/http://www.tcby.com/external/uploads_tiny/files/tcby-md-release-2009_v2.pdf |archive-date=May 21, 2009 }}</ref> and fathers a free frozen yogurt on [[Father's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|title = TCBY to Celebrate Father's Day with Free Frozen Yogurt| publisher = Chain Leader| url = http://www.chainleader.com/article/386984-TCBY_to_Celebrate_Father_s_Day_with_Free_Frozen_Yogurt.php?q=tcby}}</ref>
