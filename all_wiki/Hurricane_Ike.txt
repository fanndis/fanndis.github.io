'''Hurricane Ike''' ({{IPAc-en|aÉª|k}}) was a powerful [[tropical cyclone]] that swept through portions of the [[Greater Antilles]] and [[Northern America]] in September&nbsp;2008, wreaking havoc on infrastructure and agriculture, particularly in [[Cuba]] and [[Texas]]. Ike took a similar track to the [[1900 Galveston hurricane]]. The ninth tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the [[2008 Atlantic hurricane season]], Ike developed from a [[tropical wave]] west of [[Cape Verde]] on September&nbsp;1{{#tag:ref|For consistency, [[Coordinated Universal Time]]&nbsp;(UTC) is used for all references of time as the cyclone existed in multiple [[time zone]]s throughout its existence.|group="nb"|name="UTC"}} and strengthened to a peak intensity as a [[List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes|Category&nbsp;4&nbsp;hurricane]] over the open waters of the central Atlantic on September&nbsp;4 as it tracked westward. Several fluctuations in strength occurred before Ike made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on eastern Cuba on September&nbsp;8. The hurricane weakened prior to continuing into the [[Gulf of Mexico]], but increased its intensity by the time of its final landfall in [[Galveston, Texas]] on September&nbsp;13 before becoming an [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical storm]] on September&nbsp;14. The remnants of Ike continued to track across the United States and into Canada, causing considerable damage inland, before dissipating on the next day.<ref name="IkeTCR">{{cite report|url={{NHC TCR url|id=AL092008_Ike}}|title=Hurricane Ike: November 5&nbsp;- 9, 2008|author=Berg, Robbie|type=Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|accessdate=June 30, 2016|date=March 18, 2014|author2=National Hurricane Center}}</ref>

Ike was blamed for at least 195 deaths. Of these deaths, 74 were in [[Haiti]], which was already trying to recover from the impact of three storms ([[Tropical Storm Fay (2008)|Fay]], [[Hurricane Gustav|Gustav]], and [[Hurricane Hanna (2008)|Hanna]]) that had made landfall the same year.

[[File:234613W sm.gif|thumb|Meteorological prediction of Ike's path on September 3, 2008]]
Ike's gradual strengthening began to quicken early on September&nbsp;3, with the strengthening of an intense rainband around the center of the storm. At roughly 15:00&nbsp;UTC that day, [[microwave imaging]] indicated that a primordial [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] was developing within the intensifying tropical storm.<ref name=TCR2 /> Tracking northwestward, the NHC upgraded Ike to hurricane status at 18:00&nbsp;UTC based on [[Dvorak technique|objective satellite intensity estimates]] and the appearance of the eye on [[visible light|visible satellite imagery]].<ref name=TCR2 /><ref name=AdvDisc10>{{cite web|author1=Knabb, Richard|author2=National Hurricane Center|title=Hurricane Ike Discussion Number 10|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/al09/al092008.discus.010.shtml?|publisher={{NOAA-NWS}}|accessdate=July 18, 2014|location=Miami, Florida|date=September 3, 2008}}</ref> During this time, Ike was centered {{convert|690|mi|km|abbr=on}} east-northeast of the [[Leeward Islands]] and was tracking west-northwestward as a result of a weakened [[subtropical ridge]] to its northeast.<ref name=TCR2 /> Ike's placement in an area with virtually no [[wind shear]] allowed for the hurricane to undergo [[explosive intensification]] despite unfavorable upper-level winds to its north,<ref name=AdvDisc10 /> reaching [[major hurricane]] strength six hours after its designation as a hurricane.<ref name=AdvDisc11>{{cite web|author1=Brown, Daniel|author2=National Hurricane Center|title=Hurricane Ike Special Discussion Number 11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/al09/al092008.discus.011.shtml?|publisher={{NOAA-NWS}}|accessdate=July 18, 2014|location=Miami, Florida|date=September 3, 2008}}</ref> At 06:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;4, Ike peaked with [[maximum sustained wind]]s of {{convert|145|mph|kph|abbr=off|sp=us}} and a minimum [[barometric pressure]] of {{convert|935|mbar|inHg|abbr=off|lk=on}}, making the storm a [[List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes|Category&nbsp;4]] on the [[SaffirâSimpson hurricane wind scale]]. After peaking in strength, a ridge of high pressure to the storm's west strengthened, causing Ike to track towards the southwestâa path unusual for the time of year.

Roughly six hours later, the hurricane emerged into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as a slightly weakened system.<ref name=TCR3 />

Despite tracking back over water, Ike's prolonged interaction with Cuba had greatly disrupted the system's core, and instead of quickly strengthening and coalescing, the storm's wind field instead grew and only gradual intensification ensued.<ref name=TCR3 /> Due to the storm's comparatively small inner core and intensity of the outer rainbands,<ref name=Adv40>{{cite web|author1=Knabb, Richard|author2=National Hurricane Center|title=Hurricane Ike Discussion 40|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2008/al09/al092008.discus.040.shtml?|publisher={{NOAA-NWS}}|accessdate=July 18, 2014|location=Miami, Florida|date=September 10, 2008}}</ref> an eyewall replacement cycle took place, preventing Ike from rapidly intensifying. At around the same time, a [[high-pressure area]] strengthened to the hurricane's north, steering the cyclone further west than initially anticipated. Moving over the warm waters of the [[Loop Current]],<ref name=TCR3 /> Ike reached a secondary minimum in barometric pressure on 00:00&nbsp;UTC with an estimate of {{cvt|944|mbar|inHg}}; though winds would continue to strengthen afterward, the storm's pressure would rise.<ref name=TCR16>Berg, p.&nbsp;16</ref> By late on September&nbsp;12, Ike had reached the western edge of the nearby [[high-pressure area]] and began to curve northward. The formation of an eye just prior to landfall resulted in a slight increase in winds,<ref name=TCR3 /> and at 0700&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;13, Ike made landfall on the northeast end of [[Galveston Island]] in [[Texas]], with a minimum barometric pressure of {{cvt|950|mbar|inHg}} and sustained winds of {{convert|110|mph|kph|abbr=on}}, making Ike a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane.<ref name=TCR16 /> After tracking inland, Ike weakened as it sped northward and later northeastward, weakening to [[tropical storm]] status east of [[Palestine, Texas]] late on September&nbsp;13 and later becoming a powerful [[extratropical cyclone]] on September&nbsp;14 over the [[Ozarks]].<ref name=TCR3 /> A more steady weakening phase ensued, and after tracking across southern [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], the remnants of Ike were absorbed by another extratropical low near the [[St. Lawrence River]], on September&nbsp;15.<ref name=TCR4>Berg, p.&nbsp;4</ref>

In Houston, windows also broke in downtown buildings, including the 75-story [[JPMorgan Chase Tower (Houston)|JP Morgan Chase Tower]],<ref name=IBlast/> and [[Reliant Stadium]] lost part of its roof.<ref name="IkeTCR"/> As a result of the high wind and eyewall that passed directly through the city, power outages were a major problem.

===Turks and Caicos Islands and The Bahamas===
Due to the damage brought by Ike in the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], the insular government declared the islands of [[Grand Turk Island|Grand Turk]] and [[South Caicos]] as [[disaster area]]s. Damage on the islands was surveyed immediately following the hurricane's passage by a CDERA assessment team from [[Jamaica]]. Following the occurrence of extensive power outages, the Caribbean Electric Utilities Services Cooperation offered to support the restoration of power services. The British [[HMS Iron Duke (F234)]] was sent to the islands to assist in recovery efforts, and personnel from the British Red Cross were also dispatched.<ref name=UpdateCDERASept7TC>{{cite web|author1=Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency|title=Update on Impacts on CDERA Participating States Aug&nbsp;23&nbsp;â Sep&nbsp;7, 2008|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/turks-and-caicos-islands/update-impacts-cdera-participating-states-aug-23-sep-7-2008|publisher=ReliefWeb|accessdate=July 19, 2014|date=September 7, 2008}}</ref>

===Criticism of aid===
After Hurricane Ike, many residents applied to [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] for loans and FEMA trailers. Many residents were forced to wait several weeks until their trailers arrived. Some waited for up to two months, living in hotels, in homes of relatives several miles away, or in their homes, with no power or [[running water]]. Many residents were angry at the response that FEMA gave to the problem. Texas state leaders also accused FEMA of foot dragging and insensitivity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/hurricane/ike/6080061.html |title=FEMA 'insensitive' toward Ike victims, Texas officials say &#124; Houston & Texas News &#124; Chron.com&nbsp;â Houston Chronicle |work=Houston Chronicle |date=October 27, 2008 |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}</ref>

$3.1 billion in federal aid was eventually allocated to Texas by the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]]. It was supposed to be used to repair single-family homes of lower and middle-class income families, but as of 2011 only 10% of those funds were released, while the rest were held up because of "state bureaucracy".<ref name="aidnyt">{{cite web|last1=Fernandez|first1=Manny|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/us/extending-the-miseries-from-hurricane-ike.html|title=In Texas, Extending the Miseries of Hurricane Ike|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 11, 2011|accessdate=October 23, 2018}}</ref>

===Public and mental health issues===

Hurricane Ike also brought many health issues to the victims. Damages from the homes and the environment helped create these issues amongst the public. Following the disaster, communities were challenged to provide the correct medical treatment in emergency rooms and other medical facilities. It developed stress restricting victims their basic health services. Orange County had an 88.5 percent capacity loss of intermediate care facilities reducing its overall capacity. By late October five hospitals that usually served the areas that were impacted by the hurricane stayed closed while only one hospital continued to operate but with a limit of patients.<ref name=FEMA>Federal Emergency Management Agency. 2008. "Social Environment." pp 4â11 in Hurricane Ike Impact Report. Retrieved October 21, 2012. (fema.gov)</ref>

The need for mental health services increased after the disaster especially for depression and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Most individuals will not progress to constant behavioural or mental health problems, but the [[World Health Organization]] estimates between five and ten percent of victims will have more long-term issues.<ref name=FEMA/> Telephone interviews and mental health diagnoses were ordered randomly to households concerning the effects of Hurricane Ike. Post-disaster mental health occurrences were 5.9 percent for [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], 4.5 percent for [[major depressive episode]], and 9.9 percent for general [[anxiety disorder]].<ref name=MP>Ruggiero, KJ, Gros K, McCauley JL, Resnick HS, Morgan M, Kilpatrick DG, Muzzy W, Acierno R . 2012 "Mental health outcomes among adults in Galveston and Chambers counties after Hurricane Ike."

Victims and workers face numerous residential and occupational hazards during the process of repairing their homes or community. An exposure to [[hazardous materials]] through the process created health threats of diseases, air contamination, smoke inhalation, and lead poisoning. As disaster victims return to their damaged homes children were exposed to the [[debris]] and other hazards, developing a risk of injury.<ref name=FEMA/> After the hurricane because of power outages individuals and family misused portable generators causing [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].

===Relief efforts===
There were a number of relief efforts set up to help those caught up in Ike, including one set up by [[Portlight Strategies|Portlight]] and [[Weather Underground (weather service)|Weather Underground]]. Most of them raised at least $10,000 to help out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/StormJunkie/comment.html?entrynum=19&tstamp=200808 |title=WUBA Hurricane Ike Relief Effort |publisher=Wunderground.com |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref> The Portlight/Weather Underground effort created some initial controversy springing from the unexpected overwhelming response to requests for assistance.

Portlight delivered over $500,000 worth of equipment to people with disabilities and outlying communities that were impacted by Hurricane Ike.  They also delivered [[pizza]] to the residents of the hard-hit Bolivar peninsula and helped provide a [[Christmas]] party for residents of [[Bridge City, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1110&tstamp= |title=Dr Masters Blog |publisher=Wunderground.com |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1140 |title=JeffMasters' WUB |publisher=Wunderground.com |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref>

===Oil and gas spills===
Hurricane Ike's winds, surge, and giant waves tossed storage tanks and punctured pipelines.  However, operators in the Gulf of Mexico (ranging from major integrated producers like BP and Shell to small privately owned independents) shut in operations in advance of Ike's approach as a precautionary measure.  As a result of these shut-ins, US oil production dropped from {{convert|5|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|sp=us|abbr=off}} to {{convert|4|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane.  By late November, production was restored to pre-Ike levels.  Despite the hurricane, only {{convert|500000|USgal|m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of crude oil split into the Gulf of Mexico and the marshes, bayous and bays of Louisiana and Texas over a coastline distance of {{convert|185|mi|km|abbr=off}}.  Much of the spillage occurred in the High Island area of Galveston County, Texas, where storm surge rose over a low-lying oilfield and flooded the marshy area around several producing wells, beam pumps and storage tanks.  During the days both before and after the storm, companies, and residents reported around 448 releases of gas, oil and other substances into the environment in Louisiana and Texas. The hardest hit places were industrial centres near Houston and Port Arthur, Texas, as well as oil production facilities off Louisiana's coast.<ref name="DOFmain">{{cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/special/disruptions/archive/hurricane/ike/index.php|title=EIA Report on Hurricane Impacts on U.S. Energy: Hurricane Ike|website=U.S Energy Information Administration|publisher=United States Department of Energy|date=September 26, 2008|accessdate=October 23, 2018}}</ref>

The [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and state agencies, has responded to more than 3,000 pollution reports associated with the storm and its surge along the upper Texas coast. Most callers complain about abandoned [[propane]] tanks, paint cans and other hazardous materials containers turning up in marshes, backyards, and other places.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081005/ap_on_go_ot/hurricane_environment|title=AP Investigation: Ike environmental toll apparent&nbsp;â Yahoo!

===Retirement===
{{see also|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}
Because of the tremendous damage, number of deaths, and people left missing, the name '''Ike''' was officially retired on April 22, 2009 by the [[World Meteorological Organization]], and will never be used again for an [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic tropical cyclone]]. It was replaced with ''Isaias'' for the [[2014 Atlantic hurricane season|2014 season]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/retirednames.shtml|accessdate =April 22, 2009|date = April 22, 2009|title = Retired Hurricane Names|publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}</ref> ''Isaias'', however, was not used in 2014. Instead, it was [[Hurricane Isaias|used]] in [[2020 Atlantic hurricane season|2020]] for the [[Hurricane Isaias|first time]].

===Future mitigation===
{{see also|Ike Dike}}
A commission was established by [[Rick Perry]], the [[Governor of Texas|Texas Governor]], following the hurricane to investigate preparing for and mitigating future disasters. A proposal has been put forth to build an "[[Ike Dike]]", a massive [[levee]] system which would protect the [[Galveston Bay]], and the important industrial facilities which line the coast and the [[Houston Ship Channel|ship channel]], from a future, potentially more destructive storm. The proposal has gained widespread support from a variety of business interests. {{As of|2009}}, it is currently only at the conceptual stage.<ref>{{cite news|last=Casselman|first=Ben|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124407051124382899|title=Planning the 'Ike Dike' Defense|work=Wall Street Journal|date=June 4, 2009}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
Hurricane Ike is portrayed at the end of the 2018 thriller ''[[Galveston (film)|Galveston]]'', which itself was primarily set in and near [[Galveston]] in 1988, then jumps ahead to 2008 to establish the film's dÃ©nouement.
