In the Netherlands, as a consequence of the merger between PMI and KMG in 1988, PMI tax advisors joined Meijburg & Co. (The tax advisory agency Meijburg & Co. was founded by Willem Meijburg, Inspector of National Taxes, in 1939). Today, the Netherlands is the only country with two members of KPMG International: KPMG Audit (accountants) and Meijburg & Co (tax consultants).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://meijburg.com/page/history|title=Meijburg & Co – History|accessdate=23 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823165812/https://meijburg.com/page/history|archive-date=23 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2020 KPMG International Limited was incorporated in London, United Kingdom.<ref name=governance/>

== Global structure ==
Each national KPMG firm is an independent legal entity and is a member of KPMG International Limited, a UK Limited Company incorporated in London, United Kingdom. KPMG International changed its legal structure from a [[Swiss Verein]] to a [[co-operative]] under Swiss law in 2003<ref>[http://hrazg.ch/ Handelsregister des Kantons Zug] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329094011/http://www.hrazg.ch/ |date=29 March 2007 }} (Registration Number CH-020.6.900.276-5)</ref> and to a limited company in 2020.<ref name=governance/>

This structure in which the Limited company provides support services only to the member firms is similar to other [[professional services networks]]. The member firms provide the services to client. The purpose is to limit the liability of each independent member.<ref>This is illustrated in the cases involving [[Parmalat]] where clients sought to hold Deloitte (the Swiss Verein)and Grant Thornton International (a UK company providing administrative services to its members) liable for the negligence of other member firms.</ref>

Bill Thomas is KPMG's Global Chairman.  He was formerly Senior Partner and CEO of KPMG LLP, the KPMG member firm in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home/contacts/t/william-b-thomas.html|title=William B. Thomas|publisher=KPMG|accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref>

Some KPMG member firms are registered as multidisciplinary entities which also provide legal services in certain jurisdictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/alt-legal-all-your-profits-are-belong-to-us/|title=All Your Profits Are Belong To Us|publisher=Above the law|date=5 November 2014|accessdate=6 November 2014}}</ref>

In January 2018, it was announced that KPMG, auditor of collapsed UK construction firm [[Carillion]], would have its role examined by the [[Financial Reporting Council]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/01/15/carillion-auditor-kpmg-faces-scrutiny-approving-books-months/|title=Carillion auditor KPMG faces scrutiny for approving books months before collapse|date=15 January 2018|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=20 January 2018}}</ref> (FRC) and it was summoned to give evidence before two House of Commons select committees on 22 February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/work-and-pensions-committee/news-parliament-2017/carillion-big-four-17-19/|title=Committees publish responses from Big Four on Carillion|publisher=UK Parliament|date=13 February 2018|accessdate=13 February 2018}}</ref>

On 13 February 2018, the 'Big 4' accountancy firms, including KPMG, were described by MP [[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]] as "feasting on what was soon to become a carcass" after collecting fees of £72m for Carillion work during the years leading up to its collapse.<ref name="Davies-13Feb2018">{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Rob|title=Carillion: accountants accused of 'feasting' on company|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/13/carillion-accountants-accused-of-feasting-on-company|accessdate=13 February 2018|work=Guardian|date=13 February 2018}}</ref> KPMG was singled out for particular criticism for signing off Carillion's last accounts before a profit warning in July 2017: "Either KPMG failed to spot the warning signs, or its judgement was clouded by its cosy relationship with the company and the multimillion-pound fees it received," said MP [[Rachel Reeves]].<ref name="Davies-13Feb2018" /> Two out of three former Carillion finance directors had also worked for KPMG.<ref name="Davies-13Feb2018" />

KPMG defended itself, saying that in the construction industry "an accumulation of adverse events [...] can quite quickly cause a precipitous decline." KPMG chairman and senior partner Bill Michael said: "It does not follow automatically from a company collapse either that the opinion of management was wrong, or that the auditor did a bad job."<ref name="Davies-13Feb2018" />

On 22 February 2018, MPs contested evidence from KPMG (in one exchange MP [[Peter Kyle (politician)|Peter Kyle]] told KPMG partner Peter Meehan: "I would not hire you to do an audit of the contents of my fridge").<ref name="Marriage-22Feb2018">{{cite news|last1=Marriage|first1=Madison|title=MPs turn fire on KPMG and Deloitte partners over Carillion|url=https://www.ft.com/content/71c8f2b8-17d7-11e8-9e9c-25c814761640|accessdate=22 February 2018|work=Financial Times|date=22 February 2018}}</ref> Rachel Reeves, chair of the business select committee, said:

<blockquote>Auditing is a multi-million-pound business for the Big Four. On this morning's evidence from KPMG and Deloitte, these audits appear to be a colossal waste of time and money, fit only to provide false assurance to investors, workers and the public. [...] Carillion staff and investors could see the problems at the company but those responsible - auditors, regulators, and, ultimately, the directors – did nothing to stop Carillion being driven off a cliff.<ref name="ParlUK-22Feb2018">{{cite web|title=Carillion audits – colossal waste of time and money|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-energy-industrial-strategy/news-parliament-2017/carillion-tpr-17-191/|website=Parliament.uk|accessdate=22 February 2018}}</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>KPMG audited Carillion for 19 years, pocketing £29 million in the process. Not once during that time did they qualify their audit opinion on the financial statements, instead signing off the figures put in front of them by the company's directors. Yet, had KPMG been prepared to challenge management, the warning signs were there in highly questionable assumptions about construction contract revenue and the intangible asset of goodwill accumulated in historic acquisitions. These assumptions were fundamental to the picture of corporate health presented in audited annual accounts. In failing to exercise—and voice—professional scepticism towards Carillion's aggressive accounting judgements, KPMG was complicit in them. It should take its own share of responsibility for the consequences.<ref name="Carillion report conclusion">{{cite book|title=Carillion: Second Joint report from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Work and Pensions Committees of Session 2017–19|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmworpen/769/769.pdf|date=2018|publisher=House of Commons|location=London|pages=90–91|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref></blockquote>

The select committee chairs (Frank Field and Rachel Reeves) called for a complete overhaul of Britain's corporate governance regime, saying the government had "lacked the decisiveness or bravery" to do so, accused the big four accounting firms of operating as a "cosy club", with KPMG singled out for its "complicity" in signing off Carillion's "increasingly fantastical figures".<ref name="Davies-16May2018"/>

KPMG said:
<blockquote>We believe we conducted our audit appropriately. However, it's only right that following a corporate collapse of such size and significance, the necessary investigations are performed. Auditing large and complex businesses involves many judgments and we will continue to cooperate with the FRC's ongoing investigation. ... We welcome any future review of our profession. If we consider how the profession has changed in the last decade […] it is clear there is a need for us to look closely at our business models.<ref name="Davies-16May2018"/></blockquote>

In a June 2018 report on audit standards across eight accounting firms, the FRC identified "failure to challenge management and show appropriate scepticism across their audits." It highlighted a decline in the quality of work undertaken by the Big Four, with KPMG performing the worst. There had, the FRC said, been an "unacceptable deterioration" in the quality of KPMG's work, and the FRC would scrutinise KPMG more closely as a result.<ref name="Davies-18Jun2018">{{cite news |last1=Davies |first1=Rob |title=KPMG singled out in critical report on audit industry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/18/kpmg-singled-out-in-critical-report-on-audit-industry |accessdate=19 June 2018 |work=Guardian |date=18 June 2018}}</ref> In October 2018, the FRC proposed reforms to tackle the "underlying falling trust in business and the effectiveness of audit," and severely rebuked KPMG.<ref name="Collinson-8Oct2018">{{cite news |last1=Collinson |first1=Patrick |title=Accounting watchdog could ban auditors from consultancy work |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/08/accounting-auditors-consultancy-frc-kpmg |accessdate=8 October 2018 |work=Guardian |date=8 October 2018}}</ref>
