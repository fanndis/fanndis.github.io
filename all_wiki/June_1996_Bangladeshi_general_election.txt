'''General elections''' were held in [[Bangladesh]] on 12 June 1996. The result was a victory for the [[Bangladesh Awami League]], which won 146 of the 300 seats, beginning [[Sheikh Hasina|Sheikh Hasina's]] first-term as [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]]. Voter turnout was 74.96%, the highest to date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecs.gov.bd/files/VCgSSqUcjDR8tI1q8QbNACSe96YNm2EYTISFFKtl.pdf|title=Election Publication|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Election Commission|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This election was the second to be held in 1996, following controversial elections held in February a few months earlier.

==Electoral system==
In 1996, the 330 members of the [[Jatiya Sangsad]] consisted of 300 directly elected seats using [[first-past-the-post voting]] in single-member constituencies,<ref>[http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2023_B.htm Electoral system] IPU</ref> and an additional 30 seats reserved for women. The reserved seats are distributed based on the election results.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ahmed |first1=Nizam |last2=Hasan |first2=Sadik |year=2018 |chapter=''Alangkar'' or ''Ahangkar?''

== Background ==
The June 1996 election marked the second general election to be held within only a four-month period. Previously in February, a [[February 1996 Bangladeshi general election|general election]] had been held which was boycotted by all major opposition parties. The opposition were demanding the installation of a neutral [[Caretaker government of Bangladesh|caretaker government]] to oversee the election, citing a 1994 by-election (which they alleged to have been rigged) as evidence of the BNP's inability to hold a free and fair election. Despite the boycott the February election went ahead and the incumbent Prime Minister [[Khaleda Zia]]'s BNP was re-elected for the second term in a landslide victory, with the majority of seats uncontested. The voting was denounced as unfair by the three main opposition parties and the voter turnout was the lowest in Bangladesh's parliamentary electoral history at only 21%. 

Following the election, [[Abdur Rahman Biswas|President Abdur Rahman Biswas]] invited Zia to form a government, but this administration was short lived, lasting only 12 days.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gov.bd/index.php/en/about-parliament/tenure-of-parliament|title=Tenure of All Parliaments|date=2018-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812074443/http://www.parliament.gov.bd/index.php/en/about-parliament/tenure-of-parliament|access-date=2018-12-27|archive-date=2018-08-12}}</ref> A series of [[Hartal|''hartals'' (strikes)]] were called by the other parties and an indefinite non-cooperation movement was called until demands for a new, free election was met. On 25 March 1996, following escalating political turmoil, the sitting Parliament enacted the thirteenth constitutional amendment to allow a neutral [[caretaker government]] to assume power and conduct new parliamentary elections. On 30 March the President appointed former Chief Justice [[Muhammad Habibur Rahman]] as [[Chief Advisor of Bangladesh|Chief Advisor]] (a position equivalent to prime minister) in the interim government. A new election was scheduled for 12 June 1996.

==Campaign==
During the election campaign there was an [[1996 Bangladesh coup d'état attempt|attempted coup d'état]] by the military.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kochanek|first=Stanley A.|date=February 1997|title=Bangladesh in 1996: The 25th Year of Independence|journal=Asian Survey|volume=37|issue=2|pages=136–142|doi=10.2307/2645479|issn=0004-4687|jstor=2645479}}</ref> On 12 May, [[Abdur Rahman Biswas|President Biswas]] fired General Abu Saleh Mohammad Nasim, Chief of the Staff of the Army, due to his refusal to carry out a Presidential order to retire two of his generals who were alleged to be consorting with political parties in violation of military rules. Nasim revolted against the President and organised troops loyal to him. Consequently, President Biswas dismissed Nasim and appointed a new Chief of Staff. Troops loyal to the President were mobilised to protect Government institutions in the capital and Nasim was arrested by military police and the attempted coup d'état failed.

A total of 2,574 candidates contested the elections. The [[Awami League]], [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]] all put forward full slates of 300 candidates. The [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] ran 293 candidate, [[Islami Oikkya Jote]] 166 and [[Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Rab)]] 67, with other minor parties nominating a combined 864 candidates. 284 candidates ran as independents.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130729230304/http://www.ecs.gov.bd/MenuExternalFilesEng/125.pdf Statistical Report: 7th Jatiya Shangshad election] Bangladesh Election Commission</ref>

==Results==
The elections were won by the [[Bangladesh Awami League]], who were just shy of a simple parliamentary majority, winning 146 (of the required 151 for a majority) seats. The election was close in terms of popular vote share between Awami League and BNP, with a difference of less than 4%. However, as a result of [[first-past-the-post voting]], Awami League secured a 30-seat lead above BNP. The election saw a high voter turnout of ~74%.<ref name="IPU96">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2023_96.htm|title=BANGLADESH: parliamentary elections Jatiya Sangsad, 1996|website=archive.ipu.org|publisher = Inter-Parliamentary Union|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref>
