A small but deadly [[tornado outbreak]] affected [[West Tennessee|West]] and [[Middle Tennessee]] on the night of March 2 and into the morning of March 3, 2020, including one that hit [[Nashville, Tennessee|Northern Nashville]], becoming the 6th costliest tornado in US history, and another that impacted areas in the western part of [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]]. A total of 25 people were killed by the tornadoes,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/04/nashville-tornado-2020-at-least-24-dead/4950680002/|title='Pretty much like an explosion': Day after brutal Nashville tornadoes that killed 25 people, 3 still missing|last=Estes|first=Doug Stanglin, Ayrika L.

The path of the Nashville tornado was very similar to [[Tornado outbreak of April 15–16, 1998|the one that hit East Nashville in 1998]].

==Meteorological synopsis==
The threat for severe weather across Middle Tennessee and surrounding areas was not forecast well in advance. The [[Storm Prediction Center]] (SPC) first issued a [[Storm Prediction Center#Categories|slight risk]] across northeastern Arkansas into the [[Tennessee Valley]] area in their 06:00&nbsp;UTC March&nbsp;2 outlook. In their forecast, the SPC noted that an [[Convective Available Potential Energy|unstable atmosphere]] was likely to materialize ahead of an approaching [[cold front]], but that this environment would likely be contained by a [[capping inversion]] for most of the day.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Goss|author2=Nick Nauslar|title=Mar 2, 2020 0600 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2020/day1otlk_20200302_1200.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=March 4, 2020|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}</ref>

By the afternoon hours, the SPC expected the combination of rich moisture, modest [[wind shear]], and cold mid-level temperatures to promote the formation of [[supercell]]s with a primary risk of large hail. Some tornadic activity appeared possible overnight given an increase in low-level winds.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rich Thompson|author2=Ryan Jewell|title=Mar 2, 2020 1300 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2020/day1otlk_20200302_1300.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=March 4, 2020|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}</ref> At 5:20&nbsp;p.m. CST, the first [[tornado watch]] was issued from northern Arkansas northeastward into southern Indiana and western Kentucky as discrete storms began to develop.<ref>{{cite web|author=Roger Edwards|title=Tornado Watch 35|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2020/ww0035.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=March 2, 2020|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Brynn Kerr|title=Mesoscale Discussion 136|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md0136.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=March 2, 2020|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}</ref>

By 11:00&nbsp;p.m. CST, as a [[Low-pressure area|surface low]] progressed northeastward through southern Missouri, sustained [[barometric pressure]] falls caused supercell storms to give way to an organized storm cluster that gradually weakened as it progressed into an area of less abundant moisture.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brynn Kerr|title=Mesoscale Discussion 137|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md0137.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=March 2, 2020|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}</ref> As convection weakened to the north, the SPC began to monitor areas farther south – encompassing eastern Arkansas, West Tennessee, and southwestern Kentucky – for reinvigorated thunderstorm development as the northern [[jet stream]] amplified southeastward into the risk area. Strong wind shear coupled with low instability was expected to promote activity with "a risk for severe hail, strong surface gusts and perhaps potential for a tornado or two."<ref>{{cite web|author=Brynn Kerr|title=Mesoscale Discussion 138|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md0138.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=March 2, 2020|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}</ref> At 11:20&nbsp;p.m. CST, a localized tornado watch was issued across Middle Tennessee.<ref>{{cite web|author=Roger Edwards|title=Tornado Watch 36|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2020/ww0036.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=March 2, 2020|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}</ref> In subsequent hours, a long-lived and intense supercell produced ten tornadoes along the [[Interstate 40 in Tennessee|Interstate 40]] corridor. A few hours after the Tennessee event, as severe weather moved farther south, a couple weaker tornadoes touched down in central [[Alabama]] as the outbreak wound down.

===Tennessee supercell===
At 10:12&nbsp;p.m. CST, the first tornado produced by the supercell touched down in [[Gibson County, Tennessee|Gibson County]] in West Tennessee. This tornado was rated EF1 and was followed minutes later by a stronger and longer-tracked [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF2 tornado]] which tracked across much of [[Carroll County, Tennessee|Carroll County]]. After causing minor to moderate damage with these two tornadoes, the supercell quickly produced a third tornado, also rated EF2, that touched down north of [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] in [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]]. This tornado produced significant damage along a nearly {{convert|19|mi|km|adj=on}} path, killing one person in Benton County before crossing [[Kentucky Lake]] into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]] in Middle Tennessee. It continued to produce damage until dissipating just north of [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] at 11:31&nbsp;p.m. CST. A fourth tornado, rated EF0, caused sporadic damage minutes later in the [[McEwen, Tennessee|McEwen]] area.<ref name="TNTors">{{cite web |title=Tennessee Tornado Summaries |url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/listevents.jsp?eventType=%28C%29+Tornado&beginDate_mm=03&beginDate_dd=02&beginDate_yyyy=2020&endDate_mm=03&endDate_dd=03&endDate_yyyy=2020&county=ALL&hailfilter=0.00&tornfilter=0&windfilter=000&sort=DT&submitbutton=Search&statefips=47%2CTENNESSEE |website=National Weather Service |publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information |accessdate=30 July 2020}}</ref>

Upon crossing into [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], the supercell began to weaken somewhat, with a marked decrease in rotation as the cell moved through [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]] and into [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]]. However, very large hail was reported in the [[Charlotte, Tennessee|Charlotte]] area as the cell passed through. After passing just north of [[Pegram, Tennessee|Pegram]], the supercell immediately began showing signs of better organization as a well-defined [[hook echo]] reappeared on radar. Just after entering [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], the [[#Nashville–Mount Juliet–Lebanon–Gordonsville, Tennessee|fifth tornado]] associated with the cell commenced at 12:32&nbsp;a.m. CST, approximately {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} northeast of Pegram. A tornado warning was soon issued for [[Downtown Nashville]] as the tornado crossed the [[Cumberland River]] and impacted the [[John C. Tune Airport]]. It would go on to achieve high-end EF3 intensity in the communities of [[East Nashville, Tennessee|East Nashville]], [[Donelson, Tennessee|Donelson]], and [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]] while travelling {{convert|60.13|mi|km|}} through Davidson, [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson]], and [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith]] counties, also causing heavy damage in [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Five people were killed by the tornado, two in East Nashville and three near Mount Juliet, and 220 people were injured. After lifting, a sixth tornado, rated EF0, was quickly produced along the Smith–[[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam]] county line. It moved across areas north of [[Buffalo Valley, Putnam County, Tennessee|Buffalo Valley]], dissipating as it tried to ascend the [[Highland Rim]].<ref name="TNTors"/>

The seventh tornado was a violent EF4 tornado in [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] in the vicinity of [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]] and [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]], which caused 19 deaths and 87 injuries. It touched down northwest of Baxter at 1:49&nbsp;a.m. CST, just after a tornado warning was issued for the area. The tornado moved toward the Double Springs community and quickly intensified. Producing a narrow swath of EF3 to EF4-strength damage, the tornado moved along [[U.S. Route 70N|U.S. 70N]], causing catastrophic damage in neighborhoods along the path. The tornado abruptly dissipated just before reaching downtown Cookeville after a path of nearly {{convert|8.4|mi|km|}}. This abrupt dissipation was due in part to a southern circulation developing within the cell to the south of [[Interstate 40 in Tennessee|Interstate 40]], which later resulted in the eighth tornado, a brief EF0, southeast of Cookeville in [[Goffton, Tennessee|Goffton]].<ref name="TNTors"/>

As the northern circulation dissipated over [[Overton County, Tennessee|Overton County]], the southern circulation became dominant as the supercell climbed the [[Cumberland Plateau]] into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]]. An EF2 tornado, the ninth from the cell, began near [[Rinnie, Tennessee|Rinnie]], north of [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and moved east into the [[Catoosa Wildlife Management Area]], producing extensive tree damage. After apparent dissipation in wilderness near the Cumberland–[[Morgan County, Tennessee|Morgan]] county border, a tenth tornado, rated EF0, produced minor damage a few miles east, just to the west of [[Lancing, Tennessee|Lancing]] in [[East Tennessee]]. The final tornado produced by the cell dissipated at 3:42&nbsp;a.m. EST (2:42&nbsp;a.m. CST), four and a half hours after the first tornado in Gibson County. Interestingly, no [[tornado warning]] was ever issued for the first two tornadoes, despite strong rotation on radar.<ref name="TNTors"/>

|The was the ninth tornado produced by the Nashville supercell. It touched down along [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 127]], causing roof damage to a mobile home. It then destroyed two outbuildings, caused roof damage to two homes, and pushed over a power pole. Two more outbuildings were destroyed before the tornado continued into the [[Catoosa Wildlife Management Area]], where extensive tree damage warranted a low-end EF2 rating. The tornado appeared to dissipate near the [[Morgan County, Tennessee|Morgan County]] border, although there is a possibility that the tornado track extended into Morgan County.

This deadly and very destructive high-end EF3 tornado touched down around 12:32&nbsp;a.m. CST (06:32 UTC) in far western [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] along [[Tennessee State Route 251|River Road]], {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} northeast of [[Pegram, Tennessee|Pegram]]. Initially, just trees were downed as the tornado crossed the [[Cumberland River]] and moved through Bells Bend, where a barn was also destroyed. Damage along this initial segment of the path was rated EF0 to EF1. The tornado crossed the river a second time before heavily damaging the [[John C. Tune Airport]] and an industrial area along Centennial Boulevard at high-end EF2 strength. The airport sustained significant damage to its terminal and other buildings, with 17 metal hangars on the property destroyed. More than 90 aircraft parked at the airport, including charter jets, smaller airplanes, and a newsgathering helicopter operated by [[CBS]] affiliate [[WTVF]], were destroyed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tornado causes $93M worth of damage at John C.

Scripps Company]]|date=March 4, 2020|accessdate=March 5, 2020}}</ref> Maintaining high-end EF2 strength, it crossed the [[Tennessee State Route 155|Briley Parkway]] and struck the former [[Tennessee State Prison]], which sustained considerable structural damage. A communications tower and metal truss transmission towers were downed nearby. The tornado crossed the Cumberland River a third time and traveled through river bottomland in the Bordeaux community before crossing the river again and striking the northern part of the [[Tennessee State University]] campus.

Agricultural buildings on the campus were heavily damaged, resulting in the deaths of two calves and injuries to several goats. East of this location, the tornado produced EF1 to EF2 damage in the [[North Nashville]] neighborhood, mainly to numerous homes and a few businesses. Some small homes sustained roof and exterior wall loss in this area, and many trees and power lines were downed.<ref name="OHX">{{cite report|agency=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Nashville, Tennessee|title=March 2-3, 2020 Tornadoes and Severe Weather|url=https://www.weather.gov/ohx/20200303|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=March 5, 2020}}</ref>

The tornado grew to nearly two-thirds of a mile wide as it crossed [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|Interstate 65]] and moved into [[Nashville, Tennessee#Neighborhoods|Germantown]], just north of the [[Tennessee State Capitol]], where it produced a widespread swath of mid to high-end EF2 damage. Throughout Germantown, numerous homes, churches, and apartment buildings sustained significant structural damage, including several large, multi-story apartment buildings that had their roofs and upper-floor exterior walls ripped off. An [[O'Reilly Auto Parts]] store was damaged, and an [[Advance Auto Parts]] was almost completely destroyed. The Tennessee Department of Human Services building was largely destroyed, with its roof ripped off and some exterior walls collapsed. Around this time, local news media in Nashville began reporting [[power flash]]es and showing video of the tornado as it moved through the area, including WTVF, whose studio facility—located along James Robertson Parkway between Germantown and the State Capitol—narrowly missed a direct hit by the tornado. After crossing the Cumberland River for the fifth time along the [[Jefferson Street (Nashville)|Jefferson Street Bridge]], the tornado struck [[Topgolf]] and an industrial area, causing damage at EF1 to EF2 intensity. A [[U-Haul]] location was destroyed, with numerous moving trucks flipped and tossed.

It then crossed [[Interstate 24 in Tennessee|Interstate 24]] at Spring Street and produced major EF3-strength damage in [[East Nashville, Tennessee|East Nashville]], crossing the path of the [[Tornado outbreak of April 15–16, 1998#Downtown Nashville|April 16, 1998 F3 tornado]] in the Five Points neighborhood. Numerous businesses, restaurants, bars, homes, and apartment buildings were damaged or destroyed in Five Points, including Basement East, a popular music venue, which sustained major structural damage. A [[YMCA]] was badly damaged, and a [[Dollar General]] store was completely destroyed. Two fatalities occurred in Five Points when two pedestrians were struck by debris. The tornado continued through neighborhoods east of Five Points, causing EF2 damage to numerous homes, churches, and multi-story brick buildings. Some of these structures had removal of roofs and collapse of exterior walls. The damage continued at EF1 to EF2 strength back across the river and across Briley Parkway into the Lincoya Hills neighborhood, where many homes were damaged in this residential area. Mainly moderate damage occurred along this segment of the path, though a few homes were significantly damaged. The tornado then moved into [[Donelson, Tennessee|Donelson]], crossing the [[Stones River]] twice and destroying much of [[Donelson Christian Academy]] and the Stanford Estates subdivision as it rapidly re-intensified.

Numerous homes at Stanford Estates were destroyed and vehicles were thrown and mangled, and a few homes in this subdivision were leveled at high-end EF3 strength. The tornado crossed [[Lebanon Pike]] and then the Stones River a third time and continued into the southern part of [[Hermitage, Tennessee|Hermitage]] at high-end EF2 intensity. Numerous homes and industrial buildings sustained severe damage in Hermitage, along with Dodson Chapel United Methodist Church, in the area of [[Central Pike]], [[Old Hickory Boulevard]], and Tulip Grove Road. [[Kroger]], [[Panera Bread]], [[Petco]], and multiple apartment buildings also sustained considerable damage along Old Hickory Boulevard. The tornado maintained EF2 strength as it paralleled [[Interstate 40 in Tennessee|Interstate 40]] into [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]].<ref name="OHX"/>

The tornado moved through [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]], producing a large swath of high-end EF3 damage as it crossed North Mount Juliet Road and substantially damaged Mount Juliet Christian Academy, West Wilson Middle School, and Stoner Creek Elementary. Numerous homes throughout town were heavily damaged or destroyed, a few of which were completely leveled. Two fatalities occurred in western Mount Juliet along Catalpa Drive. Maintaining EF3 intensity along a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} swath, the tornado continued east of Mount Juliet along the north side of Interstate 40 towards [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]], causing severe damage in residential, commercial, and industrial areas between the two cities.

Numerous large warehouses, industrial buildings, and manufacturing facilities were destroyed in this area, and many semi-truck trailers were thrown and destroyed. A fifth fatality occurred in a [[CEVA Logistics]] warehouse near Beckwith Road and Volunteer Drive. While on the interstate in this area, around six tractor-trailers were blown from the eastbound lanes into the westbound lanes, resulting in the interstate being closed for around 12 hours. Further east, a sixth person was killed in a building along Eastgate Boulevard, although it was never confirmed if this death was directly related to the tornado.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fourth Wilson County tornado fatality found|url=https://www.wilsonpost.com/news/fourth-wilson-county-tornado-fatality-found/article_807c1264-5e74-11ea-a3eb-57558dd68fab.html|author=Xavier Smith|publisher=Wilson Post|date=March 4, 2020|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref>

The last area of EF3-strength damage was observed to warehouses along Eastgate Boulevard before the tornado weakened to EF2 intensity, producing more damage across [[Tennessee State Route 109|Highway 109]] and along Leeville Pike and Tuckers Gap Road. Extensive tree damage occurred in this area, and multiple well-built homes had their roofs ripped off, a few of which sustained some collapse of exterior walls. Two metal truss electrical transmission towers were blown over near Tuckers Gap Road before the tornado weakened to high-end EF1 strength and entered Lebanon. In Lebanon, many homes and businesses suffered considerable damage, including two large cemeteries, [[Lebanon Municipal Airport (Tennessee)|Lebanon Municipal Airport]], [[Walmart]], and [[Lowe's]], as the tornado crossed South Hartmann Drive, South Maple Street, and [[U.S. Route 231 in Tennessee|South Cumberland Street (U.S. 231)]]. The Wilson County Fairgrounds was affected as the tornado crossed [[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|Sparta Pike (U.S. 70)]] and moved east out of town. Frame homes were damaged, and some mobile homes and outbuildings were destroyed in this area. It continued along the interstate between Lebanon and [[Tuckers Crossroads, Tennessee|Tuckers Crossroads]], causing damage on both sides of the interstate along Bluebird Road and Coe Lane. As the tornado passed Linwood Road, a gas station and a heavy equipment auctioneer's property sustained low-end EF2 damage. The gas station had a canopy blown over and a couple exterior walls knocked down.<ref name="OHX"/>

Continuing into [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], the tornado produced EF1-type damage in the [[Grant, Tennessee|Grant]] and [[New Middleton, Tennessee|New Middleton]] communities, snapping and uprooting many trees, damaging or destroying barns and outbuildings, and causing considerable roof damage to homes. The tornado dipped south of the interstate at New Middleton, continuing to damage houses and destroy outbuildings as it crossed ridges and valleys through southern [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]], with most of the damage occurring on Agee Branch Road, [[Tennessee State Route 264|Hickman Highway]], and Maple Street. A couple of mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in the Gordonsville area as well, including one that was flipped on top of a truck on Hickman Highway, and damage in this area was rated high-end EF1. More tree and structural damage was observed as the tornado left Gordonsville at EF1 intensity before it lifted east-northeast of [[Hickman, Tennessee|Hickman]] along [[Tennessee State Route 141|Lancaster Highway]] at 1:35&nbsp;a.m. CST (07:35 UTC). The tornado caused five fatalities and 220 injuries along the {{convert|60.13|mi|km|adj=on}} path, which is one of the longest continuous damage paths in Tennessee history. Damage estimates from the tornado reached $1.504 billion, making it the [[Template:10 costliest US tornadoes|6th costliest tornado]] in United States history.<ref name="OHX"/>

The supercell continued producing sporadic wind damage through the Club Springs community as it crossed Interstate 40 and the [[Caney Fork River]], before quickly producing another tornado, rated EF0, in the St. Mary's community of [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]], approximately {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} east of the end of the damage path of this tornado.<ref name="OHX"/>

The supercell responsible for producing the Nashville tornado ascended the [[Highland Rim]] and produced another tornado northwest of [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]] in Putnam County at 1:49&nbsp;a.m. CST (07:49 UTC) on March 3. The tornado touched down along the north side of [[U.S. Route 70N|U.S. 70N]] and moved due-east, producing EF0 damage to trees, outbuildings, and homes as it approached [[Tennessee State Route 56|Highway 56]] near Baxter. The tornado reached EF1 intensity as it crossed Highway 56 and moved through a residential subdivision. It caused minor to moderate roof damage to numerous homes and destroyed an outbuilding. The tornado intensified to EF2 strength as it crossed Prosperity Drive, tearing the roof and exterior walls off a home. Entering the community of [[Double Springs, Tennessee|Double Springs]], the tornado heavily damaged or destroyed numerous homes and a garage structure at EF2 to EF3 strength, before cutting a narrow swath of intense damage across [[Tennessee State Route 291|Bloomington Road]], Clemmons Road, and Charlton Square. As the tornado crossed Charlton Square in the eastern part of the Eller Plantation subdivision, two homes were swept away. These homes were built on block foundations, but were fairly well-anchored, earning an EF4 rating. Numerous other nearby homes in the subdivision were also damaged or destroyed. Maintaining EF4 strength along a {{convert|0.8|mi|km|adj=on}} swath, the tornado crossed Plunk Whitson Road and moved eastward through more residential areas.

Catastrophic damage was produced in this area as entire portions of neighborhoods were completely flattened. Numerous fatalities occurred as at least 17 well-anchored block-foundation homes were leveled or swept away along Hensley Drive and North McBroom Chapel Road. Vehicles were thrown and severely damaged, and numerous trees were denuded and partially debarked in this area. Homes farther away from the center of the damage path sustained loss of roofs and exterior walls.<ref name="OHX"/>

[[File:2020-03-03 Putnam County Tennessee EF4 tornado damage.jpg|thumb|left|EF4 damage along North McBroom Chapel Road, adjacent to Hensley Drive.]]
Continuing eastward, the tornado continued to produce EF4 damage as it leveled a large apartment building along the north side of U.S. 70N. Just east of this point, additional EF4 damage occurred in the Echo Valley subdivision, where many homes were leveled or swept away. The tornado continued along U.S. 70N, weakening to high-end EF3 strength as it flattened the Echo Valley Market, a local convenience store. EF3-strength damage continued as it impacted residential areas within the vicinity of South Drive and Locust Grove Road, damaging or destroying multiple homes. A few poorly-anchored homes were leveled or swept from their foundations along this segment of the path, while a small apartment building, a metal structure, and outbuildings also sustained significant damage. Several metal storage unit buildings were destroyed in this area as well.<ref name="OHX"/> 

The tornado weakened further to EF2 intensity as it crossed Tennessee Avenue and Miller Road, badly damaging a smoke shop and a metal-framed warehouse structure. Significant damage continued as the tornado moved due-east, following West Broad Street (U.S. 70N). Mobile homes and outbuildings were destroyed, and numerous frame homes were damaged, some of which sustained roof and exterior wall loss. A few businesses and other structures, including a bank and the Upper Cumberland Electric Membership Corporation, also sustained considerable damage as the tornado entered the [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] city limits.

A majority of the damage along this corridor was rated EF2, though a small pocket of low-end EF3 damage occurred near County Farm Road, where a poorly-anchored home was swept away. At the intersection of Pippin Road and West Jackson Street with West Broad Street, an [[Exxon]] gas station was severely damaged, and a used car dealership across the street was flattened, with only the basement of the building remaining. This damage was given a high-end EF2 rating. Continuing towards downtown Cookeville, the tornado passed south of Sycamore Elementary School, downing trees and causing minor to moderate damage to homes and other structures at EF0 to EF1 strength. Additional EF0 to EF1 damage to trees, some apartment buildings, and homes occurred as the tornado crossed Bucks Avenue and moved through areas just east of this point. The tornado then dissipated at Laurel Avenue and West 6th Street at 1:56&nbsp;a.m. CST (07:56 UTC), just west of [[List of hospitals in Tennessee|Cookeville Regional Medical Center]] and southwest of [[Tennessee Tech]]. The university remained closed for the two days following the storm. This tornado was given an EF4 rating, with maximum estimated winds of {{convert|175|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. A total of 19 people were killed and 87 more were injured along the {{convert|8.39|mi|km|adj=on}} path.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/</ref><ref name="OHX"/>

==Non-tornadic impacts==
The severe and tornadic thunderstorms across the region brought numerous other impacts aside from the tornadoes. In [[Kentucky]], golf-ball sized [[hail]] fell in [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]] during the afternoon of March 2.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2020|accessdate=June 26, 2020|title=Kentucky Event Report: 1.75 in. Hail|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=874353}}</ref> Later a [[microburst]], with winds near {{convert|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, caused major damage to a marina on [[Lake Barkley]] in [[Kuttawa, Kentucky|Kuttawa]]. A dock had its metal flooring beams bent, while also sustaining damage to its many metal vertical supports and the metal roof, including a relatively small portion of it that was blown off. One boat was blown off a lift, and partially submerged as well and damage at the marina was estimated at $500,000 (2020 USD).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2020|accessdate=June 26, 2020|title=Kentucky Event Report: 74 kts.

In [[Tennessee]], the long-tracked [[Nashville]] supercell also bought baseball-to-lime-sized hail to [[Charlotte, Tennessee|Charolette]], shattering windshields of numerous cars and causing roof damage to some homes, leading to $15,000 (2020 USD) in damage.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2020|accessdate=June 26, 2020|title=Tennessee Event Report: 3.00 in. Hail|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=882961}}</ref> Later, after the Nashville EF3 tornado had lifted, a {{convert|4|mi|km}} long swath of straight-line winds of up to {{convert|75|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} affected [[Smith County, Tennessee|Eastern Smith County]] north of [[Lancaster, Tennessee|Lancaster]], with several trees being snapped or uprooted and a few outbuildings suffering roof damage. Damages here were estimated at $10,000 (2020 USD).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2020|accessdate=June 26, 2020|title=Tennessee Event Report: 65 kts. Thunderstorm Winds|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=883050}}</ref>

Although spared from the worst impacts, [[Alabama]] also had their fair share of destructive weather the day after the outbreak on March 4. Severe thunderstorms bought destructive straight-line winds that downed numerous trees south of [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|Interstate 85]] across the southern part of the state. The highest wind gust was {{convert|59|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at the [[Troy Municipal Airport]], which coincided with the many reports of downed trees around the city of [[Troy, Alabama|Troy]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2020|accessdate=June 26, 2020|title=Tennessee Event Report: 59 kts.
