'''Sharmishta''' "'''Shami'''" '''Chakrabarti, Baroness Chakrabarti''', {{post-nominals|sep=,|country=GBR|CBE|PC}} (born 16 June 1969) is a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician, [[barrister]], and human rights activist. She served as the director of [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]], an advocacy group which promotes civil liberties and human rights, from 2003 to 2016. From 2016 to 2020, she served as [[Shadow Attorney General for England and Wales]].

Chakrabarti was born in the [[London Borough of Harrow]], and studied Law at the [[London School of Economics]]. After graduating, she was called to [[Bar association|the Bar]] and then worked as an in-house legal counsel for the [[Home Office]].

When she was the director of Liberty, she campaigned against "excessive" anti-terror legislation. In this role she frequently contributed to [[BBC Radio 4]] and various newspapers, and was described in ''[[The Times]]'' as "probably the most effective public affairs lobbyist of the past 20 years". She was one of the panel members of the [[Leveson Inquiry]] into press standards throughout 2011 and 2012. Between 2014 and 2017, she served as Chancellor of the [[University of Essex]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lodge |first1=Will |title=Baroness Shami Chakrabarti steps down from role as University of Essex chancellor |url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/baroness_shami_chakrabarti_steps_down_from_role_as_university_of_essex_chancellor_1_4727742 |accessdate=10 October 2016 |work=East Anglian Daily Times |date=7 October 2016}}</ref>

After working as in-house counsel, Chakrabarti was appointed director of Liberty in 2003. As director, she campaigned against what the pressure group saw as the "excessive" anti-terrorist measures that followed the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the United States, such as the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] (ATCSA). The organisation is a prominent opponent of recent counter-terrorism legislation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3639988/So-much-freedom-lost-and-on-my-watch.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=So much freedom lost and on my watch |first=Shami |last=Chakrabarti |date=20 May 2007 |accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref>

In December 2005, the BBC Radio 4 ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme ran a poll of listeners to establish "who runs Britain."

=== Andy Burnham ===
In June 2008, [[Andy Burnham]], the British [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]], made what Chakrabarti claimed were "insinuations" in an interview in ''Progress'' magazine at [[Shadow Home Secretary]] [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]]'s resignation over the 42-day detention for terror suspects. Davis, a Conservative MP, was said by Burnham to have had "late-night, hand-wringing, heart-melting phone calls with Shami Chakrabarti." Chakrabarti received an apology from Burnham for his "innuendo and attempted [[character assassination]]".<ref>Patrick Wintour [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/20/2 "Chakrabarti threatens to sue over Minister's jibe"], ''The Guardian'', 20 June 2008</ref><ref>Robert Winnett [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/2166631/Andy-Burnham-writes-letter-of-apology-to-Shami-Chakrabarti-for-David-Davis-comments.html "Andy Burnham writes letter of apology to Shami Chakrabarti for David Davis comments"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 21 June 2008.</ref>

On 18 April 2009, it was reported in ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', that policemen who raided the parliamentary office of the Conservative frontbencher [[Damian Green]] and arrested him as part of an inquiry into the leaking of Home Office documents, had searched through e-mails and computer documents going back a number of years, using Chakrabarti's name as one of the keywords. ''The Times'' reported her as saying that she believed the actions of [[Scotland Yard]]'s anti-terror squad "raises very serious questions about just how politicised, even [[McCarthyism|McCarthyite]], this operation was."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6116023.ece|title=Shami Chakrabarti was target in police search|work=[[The Times]]|date=18 April 2009|accessdate=20 October 2009 | location=London | first1=Rachel | last1=Sylvester | first2=Alice | last2=Thomson}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/5174991/Damian-Green-raid-police-search-emails-for-Liberty-head.html |title=Damian Green raid: police search emails for Liberty head |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate=20 October 2009 |location=London |first1=Richard |last1=Edwards |first2=Rosa |last2=Prince |first3=Murray |last3=Wardrop |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421063324/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/5174991/Damian-Green-raid-police-search-emails-for-Liberty-head.html |archive-date=21 April 2009 }}</ref>

=== Phil Shiner ===

[[Phil Shiner]] is a British former [[human rights]] [[solicitor]] and was Head of Strategic Litigation at Public Interest Lawyers (International) from 2014 until the firm's closure in August 2016, when he was struck off the roll of solicitors in England and Wales over misconduct relating to false abuse claims against British troops.<ref>{{cite news|title=Iraq lawyer Phil Shiner struck off over misconduct|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38841544|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2 February 2017|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>  Shiner's disgrace resulted in criticism by former army officers of Chakrabarti and her support for Shiner.

[[Johnny Mercer (politician)|Johnny Mercer]] [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MP]], a retired Army captain, chided Chakrabarti "almost child-like understanding of military operations" and for "trying to retrospectively apply [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Human Rights Law]] to the battlefield". [[Richard Kemp]], a retired Army colonel and commander of the first Task Force Helmand in Afghanistan in 2003, accused Chakrabarti of being "one of [Shiner's] greatest supporters".  He said that she had been saddened by Shiner's downfall and had said that, before "losing his way", he had "given good service to the public" and "did some very good work that has been upheld by a judicial inquiry".<ref name=Telgraph2017-02-12a>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/12/disgraced-iraq-abuse-lawyer-phil-shiner-did-good-work-lost-way/|title=Disgraced Iraq lawyer Phil Shiner 'did good work, but lost his way' says Labour Baroness Chakrabarti|work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|first=Ben|last=Farmer|date=12 February 2017|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref>

{{Main|London School of Economics Gaddafi links}}
When the [[London School of Economics]] accepted a £1.5 million donation from [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], the son of former Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]], Chakrabarti was on the governing board of the institution. Chakrabarti stated that she did not "attend the 2009 Council meeting which approved a donation to the school from Saif Gaddafi's Foundation" and that she "only subsequently raised concerns about links with Mr Gaddafi, given his father's appalling regime." She went on to state that she did not think "the decision in question resulted from anything other than a naive assessment, made in good faith, of the democratic reforming ambitions of the dictator's son."<ref>[http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news/2011/liberty-s-director-and-the-lse.php "Liberty's Director and the LSE"], Liberty website, 11 March 2011</ref>

In July 2011, Chakrabarti was announced as one of the panel members of the [[Leveson Inquiry]], a judicial inquiry into [[phone hacking]] in the UK.

[[Jeremy Corbyn]] announced her as the only Labour appointment to the [[House of Lords]] in August 2016. This was a necessary step to her subsequent appointment as Shadow Attorney General.
