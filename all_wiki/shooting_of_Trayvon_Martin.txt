===Zimmerman arrested and released===
Sanford Police Officer Timothy Smith arrived at the scene at approximately 7:17&nbsp;p.m., between 5 and 65 seconds after the fatal shot was fired. He reported finding Zimmerman standing near Martin, who was lying face down in the grass and unresponsive.<ref name="Shooting initial report">{{cite web|title=Sanford Police Initial Report|url=http://www.wagist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Twin-Lakes-Shooting-Initial-Report.pdf|date=February 26, 2012|publisher=wagist.com|access-date=April 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715205940/http://www.wagist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Twin-Lakes-Shooting-Initial-Report.pdf|archive-date=July 15, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="timeline of events">{{cite news |last=Gutman|first=Matt|title=Trayvon Martin Case: Timeline of Events|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/05/trayvon-martin-case-timeline-of-events/|publisher=ABC News|access-date=May 21, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505110815/https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/05/trayvon-martin-case-timeline-of-events/|archive-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref> At that time, Zimmerman stated to Smith that he had shot Martin and was still armed. Smith handcuffed Zimmerman and confiscated his black [[Kel-Tec PF-9]] [[9×19mm|9mm]] semi-automatic pistol.

Ricardo Ayala, the second officer to arrive that night, noticed Officer Smith had Zimmerman in custody, then observed Martin lying face down in the grass and attempted to get a response from him. At this time, Sgt. Anthony Raimondo arrived and together with Ayala began [[CPR]]. [[Paramedic]]s from Sanford Fire and Rescue arrived and continued CPR, finally declaring Martin dead at 7:30&nbsp;p.m.<ref name="Shooting initial report" />

Other officers who had arrived by this time secured the area and made contact with neighbors in the area and obtained statements from witnesses at the scene.

The Martin family alleged that Seminole County Attorney Wolfinger met personally with Sanford Chief Lee on the night of the shooting and instructed Lee not to make an arrest. Based on their accusation, the Martin family requested that the Justice Department investigate the State prosecutor's office. Wolfinger responded that the family's accusations were "outright lies" and denied that any such meeting or communication took place.

On July 12, 2012, reports of some of the more than 30 interviews conducted by the FBI were released by Special Prosecutor Angela Corey to Zimmerman's attorney, who released them to the public. The released reports do not draw any conclusions in the DOJ investigation.<ref name="cnn no racist"/> The Sanford Police Department's lead investigator, Chris Serino, told FBI agents that he believed Zimmerman's actions were not based on Martin's race, but instead on Martin's attire, the circumstances of the encounter, and previous burglaries in the neighborhood. Zimmerman's neighbors and co-workers were interviewed as well. Neighbors who knew Zimmerman had nothing derogatory to say about him and his co-workers were complimentary of him.<ref name="cnn no racist">{{cite news|last=Hayes|first=Ashley|title=Witnesses tell FBI that George Zimmerman is no racist|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/12/justice/florida-teen-shooting/index.html|publisher=CNN|access-date=July 13, 2012|date=July 13, 2012}}</ref>

Serino also told the FBI that he had felt pressure from three officers within the department to charge Zimmerman although he "did not believe he had enough evidence at the time to file charges", and accused one of these officers of being friendly with Martin's father. He also expressed concern to the FBI about possible leaks of evidence to the media from within the department.<ref name="martins cousin2"/>

A witness who arrived shortly after the shooting revealed photos that he took that night that showed "blood trickling down the back of Zimmerman's head from two cuts. It also shows a possible contusion forming on the crown of his head". In revealing the photo to [[ABC News]] in mid-April, he noted that he had heard but had not seen the scuffle, had been the first to arrive, and had been the first to talk to Zimmerman after the shooting.<ref name="Zimmerman_back_head">[http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/ht_george_zimmerman_head_dm_120419_ssh.jpg Photo of blood on back of Zimmerman's head] from: {{cite news | url = https://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmerman-tells-trayvon-martins-parents/story?id=16177849#.T5MNSkZ3yHK | title = George Zimmerman Tells Trayvon Martin's Parents 'I Am Sorry{{'-}} | access-date = April 21, 2012 | last = Gutman | first = Matt |author2=Seni Tienabeso | date = April 20, 2012 | work = Good Morning America | publisher = ABC News}}</ref>

Zimmerman said he was driving to the grocery store when he spotted Trayvon Martin walking through the neighborhood.

In the interviews, Zimmerman says he took note of Martin because he was near a home that he had previously called police about.

In a reconstruction video-recorded by police the next day, Zimmerman said that after he initially saw Martin on Retreat View Circle he parked his vehicle in front of the club house at the corner of Retreat View Circle and Twin Trees Lane and observed Martin go past him and onto Twin Trees Lane where he lost sight of Martin. He stated the dispatcher asked "can you get to somewhere where you can see him?" and that he then left the club house parking lot and drove onto Twin Trees Lane where he parked.

====Zimmerman's first media interview====
On July 18, 2012, Zimmerman, accompanied by his attorney [[Mark O'Mara]], gave his first long media interview to [[Sean Hannity]], and part of the interview appeared on ''[[Hannity]]'' that evening. During the interview, Zimmerman said that he did not regret his actions on the night of the shooting and that he felt that what had happened "was all God's plan".<ref name="First interview MH" /> He also said, "I do wish there was something, anything I could have done that wouldn't have put me in the position where I had to take his life. I want to tell everyone, my wife, my family, my parents, grandmother, the Martins, the city of Sanford and America: I'm sorry that this happened. I'm truly sorry."<ref name="Hannity interview" /><ref name="First interview MH" />

When Hannity asked Zimmerman why his suspicions were aroused when he noticed Martin, Zimmerman replied in part:

<blockquote>I felt he was suspicious because it was raining. He was in-between houses, cutting in-between houses, and he was walking very leisurely for the weather.... It didn't look like he was a resident that went to check their mail and got caught in the rain and was hurrying back home.

Florida defense lawyers said it was a mistake for Zimmerman to do a television interview and discuss what happened that night. One of them said, "It's really baffling what he thought he'd gain from it. I question who's in charge of the defense strategy, Zimmerman or O'Mara".<ref name="interview against" /> O'Mara told reporters that the interview was intended to help increase the number of donations to Zimmerman's nearly exhausted legal defense fund, which would pay the costs for Zimmerman's legal defense as well as for shelter and security.<ref name="interview against" /><ref name=hannityfunds>{{cite news|title=Zimmerman interview part of plan to promote website, raise more defense funds|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/news/local/zimmerman-interview-part-plan-raise-more-defense-f/nPygj/|publisher=WFTV 9|date=July 19, 2012}}</ref> O'Mara said that Zimmerman had promised Hannity three months earlier that he would give his first interview to Hannity,<ref name="interview against" /> and that Hannity had agreed to promote Zimmerman's website during the interview, although he said Hannity did not.<ref name=hannityfunds/> ABC News' [[Barbara Walters]] also said that Zimmerman was in desperate need of money and was worried about the safety of his family.<ref name=walters>{{cite news|last=Robles|first=Frances|title=More twists as Zimmerman takes his case public|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/07/19/v-fullstory/2902578/zimmerman-calls-barbara-walter.html|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=July 19, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235646/http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/07/19/v-fullstory/2902578/zimmerman-calls-barbara-walter.html|archive-date=December 2, 2013}}</ref> She had flown from New York to Florida to record a television interview with Zimmerman that was to be shown following the Hannity interview, but the television network refused to meet Zimmerman's request that they pay for a month's hotel stay and security for his wife.<ref name=walters/>

Investigators alleged that while Zimmerman was talking to the dispatcher, Martin was on the phone with a friend and she said that Martin was scared because he was being followed by an unknown man.<ref name="CNN court" /><ref name="NPR court" /> Investigators said that Martin attempted to run home, but Zimmerman followed him because he didn't want Martin to get away. When the police dispatcher realized Zimmerman was following Martin, he told Zimmerman that was unnecessary and that police would meet him there.

===Background yells for help in 9-1-1 calls===
In recordings of the [[9-1-1]] calls, yells for help are audible in the background.

On April 9, Zimmerman placed a self-created web site on the internet, which included some brief statements, but no information about the shooting, since he had been advised by legal counsel not to discuss it.

====Defense of Zimmerman's character====
In an [[open letter]] on March 15, 2012, Zimmerman's father, Robert Zimmerman, defended his son against allegations that his actions were racially motivated, stating that Zimmerman was [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]], was raised in a multiracial family, and "would be the last to discriminate for any reason whatsoever", saying that the portrayal of his son as a racist "could not be further from the truth". Just as George Zimmerman's trial was set to begin, Robert Zimmerman published an [[e-book]] about the case in which he said that prior to the shooting, he had generally believed racism was no longer much of a problem and that he had personally not experienced much racism, despite being married to a Hispanic woman, but that since the shooting he had found that racism is "flourishing at the insistence of some in the African American Community".<ref name=trueracists>{{cite news|last=Legum|first=Judd|title=George Zimmerman's father says the 'true racists' are African-American|url=http://thinkprogress.org/media/2013/06/14/2162501/george-zimmermans-father-says-the-true-racists-are-all-african-american/| publisher=ThinkProgress |date=June 14, 2013}}</ref> In a chapter called "Who are the True Racists", Robert Zimmerman listed a host of African Americans he says are racist, including the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], the [[National Basketball Players Association]], the [[National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives]], the [[National Black Chamber of Commerce]], and the [[United Negro College Fund]], among others.

In early April, an anonymous letter to the NAACP, which was signed "A Concerned Zimmerman Family Member" said Zimmerman had been one of the few to take any action to protest the 2010 beating of Sherman Ware, a black homeless man, by the son of a Sanford police officer. Zimmerman's father confirmed his son's efforts on Ware's behalf.<ref>[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-04-05/news/os-george-zimmerman-fliers-20120405_1_sherman-ware-justin-collison-robert-zimmerman Zimmerman's family: George handed out fliers, protesting police coddling of white suspect] ''Orlando Sentinel'' (April 5, 2012)</ref>

In May, the Miami Herald secured an audiotape of the January 8, 2011, Sanford City Hall community forum. On the audiotape, Zimmerman was heard criticizing the conduct of the Sanford Police Department in the Ware case. Zimmerman criticized former chief, Brian Tooley, and said Tooley had engaged in a "cover-up" and that he should lose his pension. He also said he'd been on ride-alongs with Sanford police where he found them to be lazy. The Herald also reported that it had contacted five out of six black churches where Zimmerman was reported to have distributed fliers on the Ware beating, however no one recalled receiving them.<ref name="in2010Sanfordpolice" />

On July 12, 2012, reports of some of the more than 30 interviews conducted by the FBI were publicly released. Sanford Police investigator Chris Serino told FBI agents that he believed Zimmerman's actions were not based on Martin's race. Zimmerman's neighbors had nothing derogatory to say about him, and his co-workers were complimentary.<ref name="cnn no racist"/> CNN headlined its article on the FBI interviews "Witnesses tell FBI that George Zimmerman is no racist".<ref name="cnn no racist"/>

For not arresting Zimmerman, the Sanford police faced heavy criticism, protests, and allegations of racial bias.<ref name="Rally" /> The NAACP wrote [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] expressing "no confidence that, absent federal oversight, the [[Sanford Police Department (Florida)|Sanford Police Department]] will devote the necessary degree of care to its investigation" and requesting that personnel be detailed to Sanford to review the case without bias.<ref name="StateAttorney" /><ref name="Friend" /> Lee repeatedly defended the investigation, stating that the Sanford police did not feel they had conducted a racially biased investigation and welcomed a review of their efforts.<ref name="NYT911" /><ref name="Correction">{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/neighborhood-watch-shooting-trayvon-martin-probe-reveals-questionable/story?id=15907136 |title=Orlando Watch Shooting Probe Reveals Questionable Police Conduct|last=Gutman|first=Matt|date=March 13, 2012|publisher=ABC News |access-date=March 20, 2012}}</ref>

Allegations were also made that the Sanford police were protecting Zimmerman.<ref name="Sentinel20120326Zimm" /> Lee told reporters that they could not arrest Zimmerman because no evidence contradicted his story, and that to do so would leave the police open to litigation.<ref name="NYT911" /> In regards to the 9-1-1 dispatcher telling Zimmerman that "We don't need you to [follow him]",<ref name="911calls">Clint Van Zandt, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120321011046/http://video.msnbc.msn.com/newsnation/46786334/ 911 calls released in deadly Florida shooting], MSNBC.

On March 21, 2012, three out of the five members of the Sanford City Commission, including the mayor, passed a [[motion of no confidence]] in regards to the Police Chief Bill Lee, and his handling of the case; however, the vote was advisory only.<ref name="clickorlando">{{cite news |url=http://www.clickorlando.com/news/Mayor-2-others-pass-motion-of-no-confidence-in-police-chief/-/1637132/9655648/-/umrfxb/-/index.html|title=Mayor, 2 others vote 'no confidence' in police chief|publisher=WKMG Orlando|access-date=March 22, 2012}}</ref> The following day, Lee announced that he had temporarily stepped down from his position as chief of police, stating "my involvement in this matter is overshadowing the process."

Some commissioners had concerns about the fairness of Lee losing his job and the mayor stated he preferred to wait for the results of an investigation.

They didn't care if it got dismissed later." Lee further stated in the interview that the Sanford Police conducted a "sound" investigation, and the evidence provided no probable cause to arrest Zimmerman at the scene.<ref name="lee interview cnn" /> Lee said that the police needed to do a job, and there was some outside, and inside influence, that "forced a change in the course of the normal criminal justice process." The former police chief said the investigation was taken away from us and "we weren't able to complete it." Lee also said that his lead investigator made a recommendation that Zimmerman be charged with manslaughter, as a matter of protocol. The Sanford police presented a "''capias'' request" to the state's attorney, asking that they determine whether it was a "justifiable homicide".<ref name="lee interview cnn" />

===Zimmerman's call to police===
Economist and commentator [[Thomas Sowell]] criticized the national media for implying that Zimmerman had continued to follow Martin after the police dispatcher said, "We don't need you to do that." He said that they mostly left out Zimmerman's answer, "O.K." because "too many people in the media see their role as filtering and slanting the news."<ref>Sowell, Thomas (April 24, 2012) [http://spectator.org/archives/2012/04/24/who-is-racist "Who is 'Racist'?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427075606/http://spectator.org/archives/2012/04/24/who-is-racist |date=April 27, 2012 }} ''The American Spectator''. Retrieved May 3, 2012.</ref>

After the audio of the call was released, reports by [[CNN]]<ref>{{cite news | url=http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/22/did-trayvon-martins-shooter-use-slur-in-911-tapes/ | title=Did Trayvon Martin's shooter use slur in 911 tapes? | work=Anderson Cooper 360 | publisher=CNN |date=March 22, 2012 | access-date=April 2, 2012}}</ref> and other news outlets alleged that Zimmerman had said "fucking coons" two minutes and twenty-one seconds (2:21) into the call. Two weeks later on April 4, 2012, CNN claimed that enhanced audio revealed that Zimmerman had said "fucking cold" (alluding to ongoing rain in February).<ref>[http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/04/george-zimmermans-911-call-audio-enhanced/?hpt=ac_bn2 "911 Tapes From Trayvon Martin Shooting: Was a racial slur uttered?"], CNN Anderson Cooper 360, AC360 Blogs, April 4, 2012.</ref> The following day, April 5, 2012, CNN's [[Martin Savidge]] reported that [[forensic]] audio expert Tom Owen claimed it was "fucking punks."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/05/justice/florida-teen-shooting/?hpt=hp_t1 "CNN's Martin Savidge reports on forensic analysis of 911 tape"].

===Deceptive audio editing by NBC===
Between March 19 and 27, 2012, the NBC Nightly News, NBC's ''Today'' show, and NBC's network-owned Miami affiliate [[WTVJ]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/NBC6-Zimmerman-Edit-Explanation-148961305.html |title=NBC6 Zimmerman Edit Explanation |publisher=[[WTVJ]] |date=April 25, 2012 |access-date=June 30, 2013}}</ref> ran segments which misleadingly merged parts of Zimmerman's call.

He looks black." In the original 9-1-1 recording, Zimmerman said: "This guy looks like he's up to no good. Or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking around, looking about." The 9-1-1 operator then asked: "OK, and this guy, is he black, white or Hispanic?", and Zimmerman answered, "He looks black."<ref name="Wemple20120331" /> The phrase, "He's got his hand in his waistband, and he's a black male" came several exchanges after that point in the conversation.<ref name="fired" />

Erik Wemple of ''The Washington Post'' wrote that NBC's alterations "would more readily paint Zimmerman as a racial profiler. In reality... Zimmerman simply answered a question... Nothing prejudicial at all in responding to such an inquiry... To portray that exchange in a way that wrongs Zimmerman is high editorial malpractice..."<ref name="Wemple20120331" />

NBC issued an apology for "an error made in the production process that we deeply regret,"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/nbc-news-admits-error-in-editing-george-zimmermans-911-call-apologizes/| title=NBC News Admits 'Error' In Editing George Zimmerman's 911 Call, Apologizes|author=Vamburkar, Meenal| publisher=Mediaite | access-date=April 4, 2012 | date=April 3, 2012}}</ref> but never apologized on the air.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/business/media/tv-news-corrects-itself-just-not-on-the-air.htm | work=The New York Times | first=David | last=Carr | title=TV News Corrects Itself, Just Not on the Air | date=April 22, 2012}}</ref> The network said that the ''Today'' show and Miami edits took place in two separate incidents involving different people.

On December 6, 2012, Zimmerman filed a defamation lawsuit against NBC alleging that they intentionally edited the phone call so that Zimmerman would sound racist. The lawsuit said, "NBC saw the death of Trayvon Martin not as a tragedy but as an opportunity to increase ratings, and so set about to create the myth that George Zimmerman was a racist and predatory villain."<ref>{{cite news|author=Schneider, Mike|title=George Zimmerman sues NBC and reporters|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/george-zimmerman-sues-nbc-and-reporters-0|access-date=December 7, 2012|date=December 6, 2012|publisher=Associated Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Michael|title=George Zimmerman sues NBC Universal over edited 911 call|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/us/florida-zimmerman-nbc-lawsuit/|publisher=CNN|access-date=December 7, 2012|date=December 7, 2012}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
Some legal scholars, including Charles Rose of Stetson University and [[Jonathan Turley]] of George Washington University, were not surprised by the verdict and said the prosecution had tactically erred by charging Zimmerman with second-degree murder, which, given Florida's laws on self-defense, made it almost impossible for the prosecution to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt with the evidence at their disposal.<ref name=latverdictrep>{{cite news|last=Savage|first=David G.|title=Zimmerman verdict: legal experts say prosecutors overreached|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-zimmerman-legal-20130715,0,1600588.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 14, 2013}}</ref><ref name=USATverdictrep>[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/14/zimmerman-trayvon-martin-lawyers-verdict/2516065/ Zimmerman verdict no surprise to many lawyers].

During a speech to the NAACP, Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] stated that the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] was continuing to investigate Zimmerman for civil rights violations after the verdict, and also criticized existing "stand-your-ground" laws.
