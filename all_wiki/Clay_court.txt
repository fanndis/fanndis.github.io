A '''clay court''' is a [[tennis court]] that has a playing surface made of crushed stone, brick, shale, or other unbound mineral [[construction aggregate|aggregate]]. The [[French Open]] uses clay courts, making it unique among the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments. Clay courts are more common in Continental Europe and Latin America than in North America, Asia-Pacific or Britain. Two main types exist: [[#Red clay|red clay]], the more common variety, and [[#Green clay|green clay]], also known as "rubico", which is a harder surface. Although less expensive to construct than other types of tennis courts, the maintenance costs of clay are high as the surface must be rolled to preserve flatness.<ref name="What is clay">{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltennisdesign.com/articles/clay_courts_p.htm|title=Clay Courts: What Are They Anyway?|first=Andrew R.|last=Lavallee|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref>

==Play==
Clay courts are considered "slow" because the balls bounce relatively high and lose much of their initial speed when contacting the surface, making it more difficult for a player to deliver an unreturnable shot. [[point (tennis)|Points]] are usually longer as there are fewer [[winner (tennis)|winners]]. Therefore, clay courts heavily favor [[baseliner]]s who are consistent and have a strong defensive game, which has allowed players such as [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Björn Borg]], [[Chris Evert]], and [[Justine Henin]] to find success at the French Open. Players who excel on clay courts but struggle to replicate the same form on fast courts are known as [[clay-court specialist]]s. Clay-court players generally play in a semicircle about {{convert|1.5|to|3|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} behind the baseline. Clay courts favor the "full [[grip (tennis)|western grip]]" for more [[topspin]]. Clay court players use topspins to throw off their opponents. 

Movement on the loose surface is very different from movement on any other surface. Playing on clay often involves the ability to slide into the ball during the stroke, as opposed to running and stopping like on a hard or grass court.

Clay courts are unique in that the ball bounce leaves an impression in the ground, which can help determine whether a shot was in or out. Critics of red clay courts point to the constant need to wet them down, problems renewing the surface if it dries out, and the damage caused to clothing and footwear through stains. All clay courts, not just red clay, tend to cause a build-up of clay on the bottom of the shoes of the players, needing frequent removal.

==Variants==
===Red clay===
Almost all red clay courts are made not of natural clay but of crushed brick that is packed to make the court, with the top most layers consisting of finely crushed loose particles. Such courts are most common in Europe and Latin America. The exact color of the surface varies with the composition of the bricks used, and can appear from a light yellow to a deep red. 

''En tout cas'' ([[French language|French]] for "in any case") is a version of red clay with a coarser top layer to improve drainage.<ref>https://www.tenniscourtsuk.co.uk/ En-Tout-Cas Sports Surfaces home page</ref> The coarser surface allows more water to run through the surface of the court drying the surface more quickly after rain.<ref name="What is clay"/>

Natural clay courts are rare because this type of surface does not absorb water easily and takes two to three days to dry. A good example of natural red clay can be seen at the Frick Park Clay Courts in [[Pittsburgh]], a public facility of six red clay courts that has been in continual use since 1930.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.clayfricktennis.org/|title= Frick Park Clay Court Tennis Club |accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref>

===Green clay===

Green clay, also known by the brand names '''Rubico''' and '''Har-Tru''', is similar to coarse red clay, but is made from crushed [[amphibolite|metabasalt]] rather than brick,<ref name="Har-Tru Green Clay">{{cite web|title=Har-Tru Classic Green Clay|url=https://hartru.com/pages/har-tru-green|website=Har-Tru|publisher=Har-Tru LLC|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> making the surface slightly harder and faster. Green clay is packed to make the subsurface. It is then covered with a topping. These courts are located primarily in the eastern and southern United States. There is one [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tournament played on green Har-Tru clay courts, the [[Charleston Open]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. From 1975 until 1977, the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] was played on Har-Tru clay courts.

===Blue clay===
The 2012 edition of the [[Madrid_Open_(tennis)|Madrid Open]] was held on an experimental clay surfaced coloured blue. It was created by removing the natural [[Iron oxide]] from the clay mixture then using a blue-coloured dye. It was done for the same reason hardcourt surfaces had changed to blue, to make it easier for viewers to watch on television. A combination of poor weather conditions and organisers adding salt to the surface created an extremely slippery surface, and one that played more like a fast hardcourt surface than a traditionally slow clay surface. [[Roger Federer]] won the event with fellow top-level players [[Rafael Nadal]] and [[Novak Djokovic]] being knocked out early in the competition. The player backlash saw threatened boycotts of future blue-clay events and the tournament returned to red clay the following year. <ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/atptour/9259435/Novak-Djokovic-and-Rafael-Nadal-threaten-to-boycott-Madrid-Open-if-they-dont-change-blue-clay-court.html|title = Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal threaten to boycott Madrid Open if they don't change blue clay-court|date = 11 May 2012}}</ref>

[[Rafael Nadal]], winner of a record 13 French Open men's singles titles, is noted for his success on clay; since his debut in 2005, he has only lost twice at the tournament – in [[2009 French Open|2009]] and [[2015 French Open|2015]]. Nadal holds the record for the longest [[ATP World Tour records#Winning streaks|winning streak]] by any male player on a single surface since the [[tennis open era]] began in 1968: 81 clay court wins between April 2005 and May 2007. He also holds the record for most titles won on clay in the open era with 56 trophies.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/barcelona-2018-final-nadal-tsitsipas|title=Rafa Romps To 11th Barcelona Title {{!}} ATP World Tour {{!}} Tennis|work=ATP World Tour|access-date=29 April 2018|language=en}}</ref> [[Guillermo Vilas]] won 49 of his 62 singles titles on clay, but only won a single French Open title. [[Thomas Muster]] is also considered a successful clay court player; although he also only won the French Open once, 40 out of his 44 career singles titles were won on clay.

On the women's side, [[Justine Henin]] and [[Monica Seles]] hold the record for the number of consecutive [[List of French Open women's singles champions|French Open titles]] won at three (1990–1992 for Seles and 2005–2007 for Henin). In the pre-open era this feat was first achieved by [[Helen Wills Moody]] (1928–1930) and followed by [[Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling]] (1935–1937).

[[Chris Evert]] holds the record for longest winning streak on clay for either gender in the open era: from August 1973 to May 1979, she won 125 consecutive clay court matches. During this time Evert skipped three editions of the French Opens (1976–78), to participate in [[World Team Tennis]]. She also has the highest career win percentage on clay courts (94.28%) during the open era.

The most successful currently active female player on clay is [[Serena Williams]], who won the French Open thrice, in 2002, 2013 and 2015. In 2013, Williams went undefeated throughout the clay court season, winning five titles on the surface.<ref>[https://www.theroar.com.au/2013/06/10/serena-williams-confirms-greatness-with-french-open-win/ Serena Williams confirms greatness with French Open win], ''The Roar'', 10 June 2013</ref><ref>[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-07-22/serena-takes-out-swedish-open-title/4834556 Tennis: Serena Williams racks up 51st win to take Swedish Open title], ''ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 22 July 2013</ref>

===Clay-court specialist===
[[File:Nadal vs Federer RG 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rafael Nadal]] is known as "The King of Clay."]]
A clay-court specialist is a tennis player who excels on clay courts, moreso than on any other surface.

Due in part to advances in racquet technology, current clay-court specialists are known for employing long, winding groundstrokes that generate heavy [[topspin]], strokes which are less effective when the surface is faster and the balls do not bounce as high. Clay-court specialists tend to slide more effectively on clay than other players. Many of them are also very adept at hitting the [[drop shot]], which can be effective because rallies on clay courts often leave players pushed far beyond the baseline. Additionally, the slow, long rallies require a great degree of mental focus and physical stamina from the players.

The definition of "clay-court specialist" has varied, with some{{who|date=February 2019}} placing players such as [[Thomas Muster]], [[Gustavo Kuerten]], and [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]] in that category, even though these players have won tournaments (including Masters Series events) on other surfaces. However, since these players won major titles only at the [[French Open]], they are sometimes labeled as such. Other players, such as [[Sergi Bruguera]], [[Albert Costa]] and [[Gastón Gaudio]] were French Open champions who won all or very nearly all of their career titles on clay. Among female players, there have been very few whose best results were confined exclusively to clay. [[Virginia Ruzici]], [[Anastasia Myskina]], [[Iva Majoli]], [[Sue Barker]], [[Ana Ivanovic]], [[Francesca Schiavone]], [[Jeļena Ostapenko]] and [[Ashleigh Barty]] are the only female players to have won major titles at only the French Open since the beginning of the open era.

Increasingly, clay courters have attempted to play better on other surfaces<ref>{{cite news |last= Ford |first= Bonnie D |title= Nadal the lead warrior in Spanish surge on grass |publisher= ESPN |date= 27 June 2008 |url= http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon08/columns/story?columnist=ford_bonnie_d&id=3463241 |accessdate= 10 July 2008}}</ref> with some success.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Van Sias|title=Clay-court specialists not so special anymore|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/story/2012-04-16/weekly-net-post-demise-of-the-clay-court-specialist/54319198/1|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=16 April 2012}}</ref> Ferrero reached the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] Final in [[2003 US Open – Men's Singles|2003]],<ref>{{cite news |title= Ferrero shatters Agassi hopes |publisher= BBC |date= 27 June 2008 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/us_open_2003/3087014.stm |accessdate= 10 July 2008}}</ref> the same year he won the [[2003 French Open – Men's Singles|French Open]], and also won several hardcourt tournaments.<ref>{{cite news |title= Ferrero claims Madrid title |publisher= BBC |date= 19 October 2002 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/3205848.stm |accessdate= 10 July 2008}}</ref> Nadal was considered a clay court specialist until a string of successes on other surfaces, including completing a [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Career Golden Slam|golden career grand slam]], led to a broadening of his reputation,<ref>[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-10/us-open-final-nadal-v-djokovic/4947782 US Open: Rafael Nadal beats Novak Djokovic in four-set final to win his second Open title], ''ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 10 September 2013</ref> while [[2016 French Open – Women's Singles|2016 French Open]] winner [[Garbiñe Muguruza]] reached the [[2015 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|2015 Wimbledon]] final and won the [[2017 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|2017 Wimbledon]] title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2015-07-09/magical_muguruza_into_first_major_final.html|title=Magical Muguruza into first major final|publisher=Wimbledon|first=Matt|last=Trollope|date=9 July 2015|accessdate=19 January 2017}}</ref>

==Professional tournaments played on clay==
The professional clay court season comprises many more tournaments than the brief grass court season, but is still shorter than the hard court seasons. There are three distinct clay court seasons during the year.

The first is the men's South American clay season. Played primarily in February between the [[Australian Open]] and the [[Indian Wells Masters]], the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] has four tournaments in this swing, although other ATP tournaments played on hardcourt occur the same weeks. The WTA discontinued its participation in Rio de Janeiro after 2016, so there are no clay court women's tournaments during this period.

The second is the long spring clay season that starts in the Americas and Morocco before moving to mainland Europe and finishing with the French Open. It is usually played over two months between April and June, after the [[Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Open]]. Unlike the other two clay seasons this swing does not share the majority of its time with simultaneous hard court tournaments.

The third is the brief summer clay season that takes place after Wimbledon. It is entirely in Europe, and usually takes place in July. Near the end of the swing, it overlaps with the beginning of the [[US Open Series]].
