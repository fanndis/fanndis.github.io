The '''''National Enquirer''''' is an American [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid newspaper]]. Founded in 1926,<ref>''Los Angeles Magazine'', September 1, 2004</ref> the newspaper has undergone a number of changes over the years. As of April 18, 2019, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that the ''National Enquirer'' was being sold for $100 million to James Cohen, CEO of [[Hudson Group]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-national-enquirer-is-being-sold-for-100-million-to-james-cohen-ceo-of-hudson-news/2019/04/18/03fef706-61fe-11e9-9412-daf3d2e67c6d_story.html|title=The National Enquirer is being sold for $100 million to James Cohen, CEO of Hudson News|last=Ellison|first=Sarah|date=April 18, 2019|website=The Washington Post|access-date=April 18, 2019}}</ref>

The ''National Enquirer'' openly acknowledges that it will pay sources for tips,<!--this part's definitely true--> a practice generally disapproved of by the mainstream press.{{cn|date=September 2020}} It has also been embroiled in several controversies related to its [[catch and kill]] practices and allegations of blackmail. It has struggled with declining circulation figures because of competition from other glossy tabloid publications.

In May 2014, American Media announced a decision to shift the headquarters of the ''National Enquirer'' from [[Florida]], where it had been located since 1971, back to [[New York City]], where it originally began as '''''The New York Enquirer''''' in 1926.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://bigstory.ap.org/article/national-enquirer-leaving-florida-headquarters |title = National Enquirer leaving Florida headquarters |last = Sedenksy |first = Matt |date = May 21, 2014 |website = ap.org |publisher = [[Associated Press]] |archivedate=November 7, 2014 |url-status =  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141107093853/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/national-enquirer-leaving-florida-headquarters |accessdate = November 6, 2014}}</ref>

==History==

===1926–1990s===
In 1926, William Griffin, a [[mentorship|protégé]] of [[William Randolph Hearst]], founded the paper as ''The New York Evening Enquirer'', a Sunday afternoon [[broadsheet]] newspaper distributed throughout New York City, using money lent to Griffin by Hearst. It made its debut on September 19, 1926.<ref>"Under the Nutmeg Tree." ''Stamford (CT) Daily Advocate'', September 20, 1926, p. 4.</ref>  As partial payment of his loan, Hearst asked Griffin to use the ''Enquirer'' as a proving ground for new ideas. Hearst took the ideas that worked in his successful publications; the less successful ideas stayed with the ''Enquirer'', and as a result the ''Enquirer''{{-'}}s sales never soared. During the 1930s and 1940s, it became a voice for [[isolationism]] and pro-[[fascist]] propaganda. The paper was indicted along with Griffin under the [[Smith Act#Great Sedition Trial of 1944|Smith Act]] for sedition by a grand jury in 1942 for subverting the morale of US troops through Griffin's editorials against US military involvement in [[World War II]]. The charges were later dropped.<ref>Under Cover, p. 246, by John Roy Carlson, (1943)</ref><ref name=enq>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/EnquirerStar-Group-Inc-Company-History.html |title=Enquirer/Star Group, Inc. – Company History |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}</ref>

By 1952, when the paper's circulation had fallen to 17,000 copies a week, it was purchased by [[Generoso Pope Jr.]], the son of [[Generoso Pope]], the founder of ''[[Il Progresso Italo-Americano|Il Progresso]]'', New York's Italian language daily newspaper.<ref name=enq /> It has been alleged that [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] boss [[Frank Costello]] provided Pope the money for the purchase in exchange for the ''Enquirer''{{'}}s promise to list lottery numbers and to refrain from any mention of Mafia activities.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Deeds of My Fathers: How My Grandfather and Father Built New York and Created the Tabloid World of Today |last=Pope |first=Paul David |url=https://archive.org/details/deedsofmyfathers0000pope |year=2010 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |location=Lanham, MD |isbn=978-1-4422-0486-7 |oclc=600995928 |accessdate=October 23, 2010 |url-access=registration }}</ref>

In 1953, Pope revamped the format from a [[broadsheet]] to a sensationalist [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]. The paper's editorial content became so salacious that [[Mayor of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Robert F. Wagner Jr.]] forced Griffin to resign from the city's Board of Higher Education in 1954.<ref name=enq/> In 1957, Pope changed the name of the newspaper to ''The National Enquirer'' and changed its scope to national stories of sex and scandal.<ref name=enq/> Pope worked tirelessly in the 1950s and 1960s to increase the circulation and broaden the tabloid's appeal. In the late 1950s and through most of the 1960s, the publication was known for its gory and unsettling headlines and stories such as: "I Cut Out Her Heart and Stomped on It" (September 8, 1963) and "Mom Boiled Her Baby and Ate Her" (1962). At this time the paper was sold on newsstands and in drugstores only. Pope stated he got the idea for the format and these gory stories from seeing people [[Rubbernecking|congregate around auto accidents]]. By 1966, circulation had risen to one million.<ref name=enq/>

Pope pioneered the practice of selling magazines at supermarket checkouts. In order to gain access to the supermarkets, Pope completely changed the format of the paper in late 1967 by dropping all the gore and violence to focus on more benign topics like celebrities, the occult and UFOs.

In 1971, Pope moved the headquarters from New York to [[Lantana, Florida]]. In 1974, ''The National Enquirer'' began running [[Bill Hoest]]'s ''Bumper Snickers'', a cartoon series about cars and drivers, collected by Signet into a paperback reprint two years later.

The death of [[Elvis Presley]] was the first show business news story that provided the ''Enquirer'' with ongoing opportunities to investigate offshoots of the breaking story.  Items that followed up on Presley's death included a color photograph of his body in an open coffin, a description of nine-year-old [[Lisa Presley]]’s shock and grief over the loss of her father and reports of his pharmaceutical drug abuse, autopsy results and malpractice claims against the doctor who had supplied him with the drugs.   These reports appeared in nearly every issue of the ''Enquirer'' for more than two years.<ref name=enq/>

During most of the 1970s and 1980s, ''The National Enquirer'' sponsored the placement of the largest decorated [[Christmas tree]] in the world at its [[Lantana, Florida]] headquarters in what became an annual tradition. A tree was shipped in mid-autumn from the [[Pacific Northwest]] by rail and off-loaded by crane onto the adjacent base of ''The National Enquirer'' property. Every night during the Christmas season, thousands of visitors would come to see the tree. This would grow into one of [[South Florida]]'s most celebrated and spectacular events. Although tremendously expensive, this was Pope's "Pet Project" and his "Christmas present" to the local community. The tradition ended when he died in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Flashback Blog'': 'The Worlds Largest Decorated Christmas Tree'|publisher=Palm Beach Post|date=December 3, 2009|url=http://www.historicpalmbeach.com/flashback/2009/12/the-worlds-largest-decorated-christmas-tree|accessdate=March 4, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205193345/http://www.historicpalmbeach.com/flashback/2009/12/the-worlds-largest-decorated-christmas-tree/|archivedate=December 5, 2009}}</ref>

By this time, ''The National Enquirer''{{'}}s parent company [[American Media]] had acquired publications and companies including ''[[Weekly World News]]'', and Distribution Services, Inc. The surviving owners, including Pope's widow, [[Lois Pope|Lois]], sold the company to a partnership of [[Macfadden Publications|Macfadden Publishing]] and Boston Ventures for $412&nbsp;million. Soon after, the company bought the publication's main competition, ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'' magazine, from [[Rupert Murdoch]]. The combined interests were controlled by a newly formed company, [[American Media, Inc.|American Media Inc (AMI)]]. In 1999, the paper relocated south again, but this time only 15 miles to [[Boca Raton, Florida]].

===2000s===
====Anthrax attack====
In 2001 in [[Boca Raton]], Florida, [[Robert Stevens (photo editor)|Bob Stevens]]—a photo editor at [[Sun (supermarket tabloid)|''Sun'']], a sister publication under ''The National Enquirer'''s parent company, [[American Media, Inc.|AMI]]—was exposed to a letter with [[anthrax]] spores and was the first person to die as a result of the [[2001 anthrax attacks]]. The entire AMI office complex in Boca Raton was closed, and remained fenced off for two years after the attack; AMI moved its headquarters to another building in Boca Raton.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fas.org:80/bwc/news/anthraxreport.htm|title=Analysis of Anthrax Attacks|last=Hatch Rosenberg|first=Barbara|website=Federation of American Scientists|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107005341/http://www.fas.org/bwc/news/anthraxreport.htm|archive-date=November 7, 2005|url-status=dead|access-date=May 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/06/us/florida-man-dies-of-rare-form-of-anthrax.html|title=Florida Man Dies of Rare Form of Anthrax|last=Canedy|first=Dana, with Nicholas Wade|website=New York Times|date=October 6, 2001|access-date=December 13, 2018}}</ref>

During the same episode, another AMI staffer, Ernesto Blanco, was hospitalized with symptoms of exposure to anthrax bacteria. "The 73-year-old mailroom worker nearly died of inhalation anthrax, but has since recovered," the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported November 9, 2001, in an article titled: "AMERICAN Media head honcho [[David Pecker]] is off his Cipro."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/item_6bwllxq79vAh4nn5J0z47N | work=New York Post | first=Keith J. | last=Kelly | title=Pecker Off His Medication | date=November 9, 2001}}</ref>

====John Edwards story====
In August 2008, in an interview with [[ABC News]], former Presidential candidate [[John Edwards]] admitted [[John Edwards extramarital affair|to having an extramarital affair]] with [[Rielle Hunter]] but denied fathering her child.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5441195&page=1 |title=Edwards Admits Sexual Affair; Lied as Presidential Candidate – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=August 8, 2008 |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}</ref> Edwards had earlier made false denials of the affair which was first reported by the ''National Enquirer''. In October 2007, the publication ran a story about the 2006 affair with Hunter, a filmmaker hired by the Edwards political team, although Edwards dismissed the story as "completely untrue, ridiculous" and "false."<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080808/ap_on_el_pr/edwards_affair_15 ]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> In July 2008, the publication ran an article claiming to have caught the former [[North Carolina]] Senator visiting Hunter, and their alleged illegitimate child at a hotel in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalenquirer.com/sen_john_edwards_caught_with_mistress_and_love_child_in_la_hotel/celebrity/65193|title=SEN.

In 2010 there was some speculation that the ''Enquirer'' might receive a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for its investigation of Edwards.<ref name="TimesPulitzer">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/business/media/19pulitzer.html|title=National Enquirer Is Said to Be Eligible for Pulitzers|last=Pérez-Peña|first=Richard|date=February 18, 2010|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 19, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> [[Donald Trump]] said that the title should be "respected" for its investigation, and questioned why the [[Tabloid journalism]] was not given the award.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Borchers|first1=Callum|title=Donald Trump wonders why the National Enquirer didn't win a Pulitzer Prize.

====Sarah Palin story====
The ''National Enquirer'' claimed to have an exclusive account of the pregnancy of [[Bristol Palin]], the daughter of [[Sarah Palin]], then governor of Alaska and Republican candidate for Vice President in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]]:<ref name=Prego>{{cite news| work=National Enquirer |title=Palin War: Teen Prego Crisis | url=http://www.nationalenquirer.com/sarah_palin_at_war_with_her_daughter_over_pregnancy_wedding/celebrity/65370}}</ref>

The title also published an allegation that Palin had an affair with her husband's business partner, Brad Hanson.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/brad-hanson-sarah-palins_n_129356?ri18n=true|title=National Enquirer Alleges Sarah Palin Affair With Brad Hanson|work=The Huffington Post|date=May 25, 2011|orig-year=October 26, 2008|access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref>

Answering [[John McCain]]'s threat of a lawsuit, a spokesman for the ''National Enquirer'', in a statement to ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'', declared:
{{quote|''The National Enquirer''{{'}}s coverage of a vicious war within Sarah Palin's extended family includes several newsworthy revelations, including the resulting incredible charge of an affair plus details of family strife when the Governor's daughter revealed her pregnancy. Following our [[John Edwards]]' exclusives, our political reporting has obviously proven to be more detail-oriented than the McCain campaign's vetting process. Despite the McCain camp's attempts to control press coverage they find unfavorable, ''The Enquirer'' will continue to pursue news on both sides of the political spectrum.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stein|first=Sam|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mccain-camp-battles-natio_n_123696?ri18n=true|title=McCain Camp Battles National Enquirer Over Alleged Palin Affair|work=The Huffington Post|date=May 25, 2011|orig-year=October 4, 2008|access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref>}}

{{further|Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations}}
The ''National Enquirer'' received, and refused to publish a story from [[Karen McDougal]] about an alleged affair she had with Trump in 2006 and, in 2016 as his presidential campaign advanced, paid McDougal $150,000 for, among other items, "exclusive life rights to any relationship she has had with a then-married man." ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said that the tabloid had paid McDougal [[hush money]] and was using the purchase and refusal to publish the story to protect Trump (a technique known as [[catch and kill]]), an allegation the publication denied.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirer-shielded-donald-trump-from-playboy-models-affair-allegation-1478309380?mod=e2tw|title=National Enquirer Shielded Donald Trump From Playboy Model's Affair Allegation|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 4, 2016|accessdate=November 5, 2016}}</ref> In February 2018, after a similar situation involving [[Stormy Daniels]] (not involving the ''National Enquirer'') was confirmed, McDougal confirmed her story to [[Ronan Farrow]] for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', stating that the ''National Enquirer'' had loosened the terms of the contract after Trump was elected but that she was unsure of how much she could discuss under the terms of the agreement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-karen-mcdougal-affair-national-enquirer/|title=National Enquirer Paid to Kill Story of Playboy Model's Affair with Donald Trump: Report|date=November 5, 2016|publisher=}}</ref> The publication had also paid $30,000 to an employee at one of Trump's hotels who claimed that Trump fathered a child out of wedlock during the 1980s; the payment came in November 2015, before the paper publicly endorsed Trump, and according to reports in ''The New Yorker'', the title's staff was investigating the story and preparing to publish the employee's claims before ''National Enquirer'' owner [[David Pecker]] personally quashed it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-national-enquirer-a-donald-trump-rumor-and-another-secret-payment-to-buy-silence-dino-sajudin-david-pecker|title=The ''National Enquirer'', a Trump Rumor, and Another Secret Payment to Buy Silence|first=Ronan|last=Farrow|work=The New Yorker|date=April 12, 2018|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}</ref>

====Brzezinski, Scarborough, and the Trump administration====
In  June 2017, ''[[Morning Joe]]'' hosts [[Mika Brzezinski]] and [[Joe Scarborough]] stated that senior officials in the Trump administration had tried to [[blackmail]] the two of them using the ''National Enquirer''. According to them, the tabloid threatened to publish a smear article on the couple unless the two personally called Trump and begged him to have the story spiked. They refused, and the title (which did not have direct contact with Scarborough or Brzezinski) published the story. The Trump administration also denied the story; Scarborough claims he has saved phone correspondence to the contrary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/06/30/media/national-enquirer-donald-trump-joe-scarborough/index.html|title=Scarborough, Brzezinski say White House used ''National Enquirer'' as threat|first=Brian|last=Stelter|work=CNN|date=June 30, 2017|accessdate=June 30, 2017}}</ref>

====Jeff Bezos====
In February 2019, [[Jeff Bezos]] alleged that the ''National Enquirer'' had threatened to publish private messages and photographs belonging to Bezos and his girlfriend, [[Lauren Sánchez]], if Bezos did not stop ''[[The Washington Post]]'', which he owns, from pursuing journalistic inquiries into how the publication obtained those messages and photographs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/jeff-bezos-accuses-national-enquirer-owner-extortion-blackmail-n969136|title=Jeff Bezos accuses ''National Enquirer'' owner of 'extortion and blackmail'|website=NBC News|accessdate=February 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/technology/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-blackmail.html|title=Jeff Bezos Accuses ''National Enquirer'' of 'Extortion and Blackmail'|first=Karen|last=Weise|date=February 7, 2019|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/jeff-bezos-national-enquirer-photos-ami-s-alleged-extortion-explained-ncna969876|title=Opinion - AMI played with fire when it threatened Jeff Bezos.

===Notable stories and lawsuits===
<!--one example from the 1980s, one from the '90s, and eight from the '00s; not exactly even-->
In 1981, actress [[Carol Burnett]] won [[Carol Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.|a judgment]] against the ''National Enquirer'' after it claimed she had been seen [[drunk]] in public at a restaurant with [[Henry Kissinger]] in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to Burnett. The former longtime chief [[editing|editor]] Iain Calder in his book ''The Untold Story,'' asserted that afterwards, while under his leadership, the publication worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.

The ''National Enquirer'' additionally scooped other media outlets during the [[O. J. Simpson]] [[People of the State of California vs. Orenthal James Simpson|murder trial]]: when a distinctive footprint from a [[Bruno Magli]] shoe was found at the crime scene, Simpson vehemently denied owning such a shoe. The title, however, published two photos showing Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes.<ref>Gleick, Elizabeth, "O.J. Feels the Heat", ''TIME'' magazine, December 2, 1996. Retrieved August 7, 2008.</ref>

Controversy over false content arose again for the ''National Enquirer'' when a 2002 article alleged that male members of the family of kidnapping victim [[Elizabeth Smart kidnapping|Elizabeth Smart]] were involved in what the article termed a "[[homosexuality|gay]] sex ring." Subsequently, two reporters from the ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' were fired after it was learned that they had been paid $20,000 for the story, which they had fabricated.<ref>[http://www.courttv.com/news/smart/042903_tabloid_ap.html "Salt Lake Tribune fires reporters who sold Smart case information to tabloid"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120003440/http://www.courttv.com/news/smart/042903_tabloid_ap.html |date=November 20, 2008 }} courttv.com April 29, 2003. Retrieved July 15, 2007.</ref> The title threatened to sue the ''Salt Lake Tribune'' for making false and defamatory statements about the publication after an editorial had disclaimed the ''Tribune'''s involvement. The salacious details of the Smart story were retracted by the publication, and a rare apology was issued to the Smart family. One of the fired reporters acknowledged that his behavior was unethical, but expressed surprise that the story had been taken seriously, stating, "When I dealt with the ''National Enquirer'', I never dreamed that I was accepting money for 'information'."<ref name=Deseret2003-04-29/>

The ''National Enquirer'' settled a libel lawsuit with the wife of [[Gary Condit]] out of court in 2003<ref>[http://www.rcfp.org/news/2003/0711condit.html "Carolyn Condit and ''National Enquirer'' settle suit"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927060256/http://www.rcfp.org/news/2003/0711condit.html |date=September 27, 2011 }} rcfp.org 07/11/03.

Retrieved July 15, 2007.</ref>

In 2006, the ''National Enquirer'' was the first newspaper to reveal that O. J. Simpson had written a book, ''[[If I Did It]]''. The story was immediately denied by Simpson's lawyer, but was confirmed by release of the book one month later.<ref>[http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/news/author/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003286768 No Juice-y Book, Lawyer Says<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202041421/http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/news/author/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003286768 |date=February 2, 2008 }}</ref>

In early March 2007, the paper blocked access to its website for British and Irish readers because a story about the actress [[Cameron Diaz]] that they had published in 2005 and for which she received an apology had appeared on the site. The apology concerned a story it had run in 2005 entitled "Cameron Caught Cheating" which turned out to be false – an accompanying picture was just an innocent goodbye hug to a friend, not evidence of an affair. Although only 279 British web addresses had looked at the story, it was deemed to have therefore been published in the United Kingdom. British libel laws are more [[plaintiff]]-friendly and it is not necessary to prove [[actual malice]] for the plaintiff to win.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/205232f6-d269-11db-a7c0-000b5df10621.html "Plug pulled in UK over libel stance"], FT.com (''Financial Times'') March 14, 2007. Retrieved July 15, 2007.</ref>

Also in March 2007, Tucker Chapman, son of [[Duane "Dog" Chapman]], sold a tape to the ''National Enquirer'' of his father disparaging his black girlfriend with the use of the word "[[nigger]]" in which the tabloid paid Tucker an undisclosed amount. The [[A&E Network]] canceled Chapman's show, ''[[Dog the Bounty Hunter]]'', pending an investigation. On February 21, 2008, A&E Network stated they would resume production of ''Dog the Bounty Hunter'', and on May 14, 2008, announced it would return to TV on June 25, 2008.

On January 19, 2010, the [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize Board]] announced that the ''National Enquirer'' is eligible for consideration for the Pulitzer Prize in the categories of Investigative Journalism and National News Reporting. This change is primarily due to the ''Enquirer'''s breaking the story of [[John Edwards]]' affair with [[Rielle Hunter]].<ref>[https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/national-enquirer-now-legit-pulitzer-prize-board/story?id=9887329 ''National Enquirer'' Now Legit, According to Pulitzer Prize Board"], by Sheila Marikar and Russell Goldman, February 19, 2010.

===Editorial changes===
In 1999 AMI was bought by a group fronted by publishing executive [[David J. Pecker]]. Funding was diverted from the ''National Enquirer'', once considered to be the company's principal publication, to ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'' magazine. Editor Steve Coz, who guided the paper through the Simpson case, was fired and replaced by David Perel, who had been the Editor in charge of breaking numerous stories on the Simpson coverage.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The ''National Enquirer''{{'}}s circulation for a time fell below 1 million (from over 6&nbsp;million at its height). AMI brought in around 20 British journalists in early 2005, headed by editor Paul Field, a former executive at the British tabloid ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', and relocated the editorial offices to New York for an April 2005 relaunch. The move failed badly and Field and virtually all the British journalists were sacked after a year. The company reappointed David Perel and announced the ''National Enquirer'' offices would return to [[Boca Raton, Florida]] in May 2006. Circulation numbers then climbed to over 1 million readers again, and according to the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (North America)|Audit Bureau of Circulations]] reached over 1 million. Perel later moved on to oversee the relaunch of the gossip website [[Radar Online]], and was replaced as editor-in-chief by Tony Frost. In 2014, the publication moved back to New York and Frost was replaced by Dylan Howard.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Howard and the National Enquirer parted ways when his contract, which expired March 31, 2020, was not renewed.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Elizabeth Wagmeister |first1=Matt Donnelly |title=Top Tabloid Exec Dylan Howard Out at American Media Inc.
