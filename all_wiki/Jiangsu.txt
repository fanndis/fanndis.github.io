'''Jiangsu''' (<!-- details in infobox -->{{zh|s={{Audio|zh-Jiangsu.ogg|江苏|help=no}}|labels=no}}; [[Postal romanization|formerly]] romanized '''Kiangsu''') is an eastern-central coastal [[Provinces of the People's Republic of China|province]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. It is one of the leading provinces in finance, education, technology, and tourism, with its capital in [[Nanjing]]. Jiangsu is the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by area|third smallest]], but the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|fifth most populous]] and the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population density|most densely populated]] of the 23 provinces of the People's Republic of China. Jiangsu has the highest GDP per capita of Chinese provinces and second-highest GDP of Chinese provinces, after [[Guangdong]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2014-04/01/content_17393546_2.htm|title=Top 10 regions with highest GDP in China[2]- Chinadaily.com.cn|last=赵婷婷|work=ChinaDaily.com.cn|access-date=22 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028093904/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2014-04/01/content_17393546_2.htm|archive-date=28 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Jiangsu borders [[Shandong]] in the north, [[Anhui]] to the west, and [[Zhejiang]] and [[Shanghai]] to the south. Jiangsu has a coastline of over {{convert|1000|km}} along the [[Yellow Sea]], and the [[Yangtze River]] passes through the southern part of the province.

Since the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, Jiangsu has been a national economic and commercial center, partly due to the construction of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]]. Cities such as [[Nanjing]], [[Suzhou]], [[Wuxi]], [[Changzhou]] and [[Shanghai]] (separated from Jiangsu in 1927) are all major Chinese economic hubs. Since the initiation of economic reforms in 1990, Jiangsu has become a focal point for economic development. It is widely regarded as one of China's most developed provinces, when measured by its [[List of administrative divisions of Greater China by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]] (HDI).<ref name="hdis"/>

Jiangsu is home to many of the world's leading exporters of electronic equipment, chemicals and textiles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2010/12/08/china-regions-to-be-bigger-than-russia/|title=China provinces 'to be bigger than Russia'|work=FT.com|access-date=22 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406140246/http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2010/12/08/china-regions-to-be-bigger-than-russia/|archive-date=6 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> It has also been China's largest recipient of foreign direct investment since 2006.

==Name==
Jiangsu's name is a compound of the first elements of the names of the two cities of Jiangning (now [[Nanjing]]) and [[Suzhou]]. The abbreviation for this province is "{{linktext|lang=zh-hans|苏}}" ({{transl|zh|Sū}}), the second character of its name.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shenghuo/1090/2435218.html Origin of the Names of China's Provinces] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427100058/http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shenghuo/1090/2435218.html |date=2016-04-27 }}, [[People's Daily Online]]. {{in lang|zh}}</ref>

== History ==
During the earliest Chinese dynasties, the area that is now Jiangsu was far away from the center of Chinese civilization, which was in the northwest [[Henan]]; it was home of the Huai Yi ({{lang|zh|淮夷}}), an ancient ethnic group. During the [[Zhou dynasty]] more contact was made, and eventually the [[state of Wu]] appeared in southern Jiangsu, one of the many hundreds of states that existed across northern and central China at that time. Near the end of the [[Spring and Autumn period]], Wu became a great power under [[King Helu of Wu]], and defeated in 484&nbsp;BC the [[state of Qi]], a major power in the north in modern-day [[Shandong]] [[province]], and contest for the position of overlord over all states of China. The state of Wu was subjugated in 473&nbsp;BC by the [[state of Yue]], another state that had emerged to the south in modern-day [[Zhejiang]] province. Yue was in turn subjugated by the powerful [[state of Chu]] from the west in 333 BC. Eventually the [[state of Qin]] swept away all the other states, and unified China in 221 BC.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/317225/Jiangsu/71208/Cultural-life |title=Jiangsu - province, China |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |access-date=22 January 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514011237/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/317225/Jiangsu/71208/Cultural-life/ |archive-date=14 May 2014 }}</ref>

Under the reign of the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC to 220 AD), Jiangsu was removed from the centers of civilization in the [[North China Plain]], and was administered under two ''[[zhou (political division)|zhou]]'' (provinces): [[Xuzhou (ancient China)|Xu]] Province in the north, and [[Yangzhou (ancient China)|Yang]] Province in the south. During the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, southern Jiangsu became the base of the [[Eastern Wu]] (222 to 280), whose capital, [[Jiankang|Jianye]] (later renamed to Jiankang), is modern [[Nanjing]]. When nomadic invasions overran northern China in the 4th century, the imperial court of the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] moved to Jiankang.  Cities in southern and central Jiangsu swelled with the influx of migrants from the north. Jiankang remained as the capital for four successive [[Southern dynasties]] and became the largest commercial and cultural center in China.<ref>{{cite web |language=zh-hans |url=http://dfz.nanjing.gov.cn/17557/17560/200906/t20090624_984387.html |script-title=zh:管玉春, 六代繁华帝王都 东晋、南朝的都城——建康 |date=2009-06-24 |access-date=2015-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104202205/http://dfz.nanjing.gov.cn/17557/17560/200906/t20090624_984387.html |archive-date=2015-01-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:Tiger hill.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Huqiu Tower]] of [[Tiger Hill, Suzhou|Tiger Hill]], Suzhou, built in 961.]]
After the Sui dynasty united the country in 581, the political center of the country shifted back to the north, but the Grand Canal was built through Jiangsu to link the Central Plain with the prosperous Yangtze Delta. The [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) relied on southern Jiangsu for annual deliveries of grain. It was during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), which saw the development of a wealthy mercantile class and emergent [[market economy]] in China, that [[Jiangnan]] (southern Jiangsu, [[Shanghai]], and adjacent areas) emerged as a center of [[trade]]. From then onwards, major cities like [[Suzhou]] or [[Yangzhou]], would be synonymous with opulence and luxury in China. Today the region remains one of the richest parts of China.

The Jurchen [[Jin dynasty, 1115–1234|Jin dynasty]] [[Jingkang Incident|gained control]] of [[North China]] in 1127 during the [[Jin campaigns against the Song dynasty|Jin-Song wars]], and [[Huai River]], which used to cut through north Jiangsu to reach the [[Yellow Sea]], was the border between the north, under the Jin, and the south, under the [[Southern Song dynasty]]. The Mongols took control of China in the thirteenth century. The [[Ming dynasty]], which was established in 1368 after driving out the [[Mongol]]s who had occupied China, initially put its capital in [[Nanjing]]. Regions surrounding Nanjing, corresponding to Jiangsu and Anhui today, were designated as the Nanzhili province (literally "southern directly governed"). Following a coup by Zhu Di (later, the [[Yongle Emperor]]), however, the capital was moved to [[Beijing]], far to the north, although Nanjing kept its status as the southern capital. In late Ming, Jiangnan continued to be an important center of trade in China; some historians see in the flourishing [[textiles]] industry at the time incipient [[industrialization]] and [[capitalism]], a trend that was however aborted.

[[File:SuzhouNorthTemplePagoda.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Beisi Pagoda]] of [[Suzhou]], built between 1131 and 1162 during the [[Song dynasty]], {{convert|76|m|abbr=on}} tall.]]
The [[Qing dynasty]] converted Nanzhili to "Jiangnan province"; in 1666 Jiangsu and Anhui were split apart as separate provinces. Jiangsu's borders have been for the most part stable since then.

With the start of the Western incursion into China in the 1840s, the rich and mercantile [[Yangtze river delta]] was increasingly exposed to Western influence; [[Shanghai]], originally an unremarkable little town of Jiangsu, quickly developed into a metropolis of trade, banking, and cosmopolitanism, and was split out later as an independent municipality. Jiangnan also figures strongly in the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1851{{spaced ndash}}1864), a massive and deadly rebellion that attempted to set up a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theocracy]] in China; it started far to the south, in [[Guangdong]] province, swept through much of South China, and by 1853, had established Nanjing as its capital, renamed as Tianjing ({{lang|zh|天京}} "Heavenly Capital").

The [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] was established in 1912,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.cultural-china.com/en/183History6971.html|title=Republic of China (1912 AD－1949 AD) - China culture|work=cultural-china.com|access-date=22 January 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018062336/http://history.cultural-china.com/en/183History6971.html|archive-date=18 October 2016}}</ref> and China was soon torn apart by warlords. Jiangsu changed hands several times, but in April 1927, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] established a government at [[Nanjing|Nanking]]; he was soon able to bring most of China under his control. This was however interrupted by the [[second Sino-Japanese War]], which began full-scale in 1937; on December 13, 1937, Nanjing fell, and the combined atrocities of the occupying Japanese for the next three months would come to be known as the [[Nanjing Massacre]]. Nanjing was the seat of the [[Wang Jingwei regime|collaborationist government of East China]] under [[Wang Jingwei]], and Jiangsu remained under Japanese occupation until the end of the war in 1945.

After the war, Nanking was once again the capital of the Republic of China, though now the [[Chinese Civil War]] had broken out between the [[Kuomintang]] government and [[Communist Party of China|Communist forces]], based further north, mostly in [[Northeast China]]. The decisive [[Huaihai Campaign]] was fought in northern Jiangsu; it resulted in Kuomintang defeat, and the communists were soon able to cross the [[Yangtze River]] and take Nanking. The Kuomintang fled southward and eventually ended up in [[Taipei]], from which the Republic of China government continues to administer [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu|Pescadores]], and its neighboring islands, though it also continues to claim (technically, at least) Nanjing as its rightful ''de jure'' capital.

After communist takeover, [[Beijing|Peking]] (formerly Peiping, later spelled as Beijing) was made capital of the People's Republic, and Nanjing was demoted to be the provincial capital of Jiangsu. The [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] of [[Deng Xiaoping]] initially focused on the south coast of China, in [[Guangdong]] province, which soon left Jiangsu behind; starting from the 1990s they were applied more evenly to the rest of China. [[Suzhou]] and [[Wuxi]], two southern cities of Jiangsu in close proximity to neighboring [[Shanghai]], have since become particularly prosperous, being among the top 10 cities in China in terms of [[gross domestic product]] and outstripping the provincial capital of Nanjing. The income disparity between northern and southern Jiangsu however remains large.

Jiangsu also borders the [[Yellow Sea]]. The [[Yangtze River]], the longest river of China, cuts through the province in the south and reaches the [[East China Sea]], which divides the region into two parts: more urban, prosperous south and more poorer, rural north, and these two parts has a tense division.<ref>[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/jiangsu-new-yorks-chinese-sister/?_r=0 Jiangsu, New York's China Sister] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215175431/https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/jiangsu-new-yorks-chinese-sister/?_r=0 |date=2018-12-15 }}, ''New York Times'', 2009-04-27</ref>
[[Mount Yuntai]], near the city of [[Lianyungang]], is the highest point in Jiangsu, at an altitude of {{convert|625|m|abbr=out}} [[above sea level]]. Large lakes in Jiangsu include [[Lake Tai]] (the largest), [[Lake Hongze]], [[Lake Gaoyou]], [[Lake Luoma]], and [[Lake Yangcheng]].

Before 1194 A.D., the [[Huai River]] cut through north Jiangsu to reach the [[Yellow Sea]]. The Huai River is a major river in central China, and it was the traditional border between [[North China and South China]]. Since 1194 A.D., the [[Yellow River]] further to the north changed its course several times, running into the [[Huai River]] in north Jiangsu each time instead of its other usual path northwards into [[Bohai Bay]]. The silting caused by the [[Yellow River]] was so heavy that after its last episode of "hijacking" the Huai River ended in 1855: the Huai River was no longer able to go through its usual path into the sea. Instead it flooded, pooled up (thereby forming and enlarging [[Lake Hongze]] and [[Lake Gaoyou]]), and flowed southwards through the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] into the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]. The old path of the [[Huai River]] is now marked by a series of [[irrigation]] channels, the most significant of which is the [[North Jiangsu Main Irrigation Canal]] ({{lang|zh-hans|苏北灌溉总渠}}), which channels a small amount of the water of the [[Huai River]] alongside south of its old path into the sea.

Most of Jiangsu has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' or ''Cwa'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]), beginning to transition into a [[humid continental climate]] (Köppen ''Dwa'') in the far north. Seasonal changes are clear-cut, with temperatures at an average of {{convert|−1|to|4|C|F}} in January and {{convert|26|to|29|C|F}} in July. Rain falls frequently between spring and summer (''[[meiyu]]''), [[typhoon]]s with [[rainstorm]]s occur in late summer and early autumn. As with the rest of the coast, tornados are possible. The annual average rainfall is {{convert|800|to|1200|mm}}, concentrated mostly in summer during the southeast [[monsoon]].

These prefecture-level cities are in turn subdivided into 98 [[county-level division]]s (55 [[District of China|districts]], 21 [[county-level cities]], and 20 [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]]). Those are in turn divided into 1,488 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Township level|township-level divisions]] (1,078 [[town of China|towns]], 122 [[Townships of the People's Republic of China|townships]], one [[ethnic township]], and 287 [[subdistrict]]s). At the end of the year 2017, the total population is 80.29 million.[http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2018/indexch.htm]

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Jiangsu|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}
The politics of Jiangsu is structured in a one party (Communist) government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The [[Governor of Jiangsu]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Jiangsu. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Jiangsu [[Communist Party of China]] Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the "Jiangsu [[CPC Party Chief]]."

Annual economic growth is around 8%. Jiangsu' economy is the [[List of country subdivisions by GDP over 100 billion US dollars|7th-largest]] of any country subdivision globally, behind [[California]], [[England]], [[Kantō region|Tokyo]], [[Texas]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Guangdong]]. Its GDP per capita in 2017 was US$17,176, ranking [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|4th]] in [[Mainland China]].

The province has an extensive irrigation system supporting its agriculture, which is based primarily on [[rice]] and [[wheat]], followed by [[maize]] and [[sorghum]]. Main [[cash crop]]s include [[cotton]], [[soybean]]s, [[peanut]]s, [[rapeseed]], [[sesame]], [[hemp|ambary hemp]], and [[tea]]. Other products include [[peppermint]], [[spearmint]], [[bamboo]], [[medicinal herbs]], [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[peach]]es, [[loquat]]s, [[ginkgo]]. [[Silkworm]]s form an important part of Jiangsu's agriculture, with the [[Lake Tai]] region to the south a major base of [[silk]] production in China. Jiangsu is an important producer of freshwater fish and other aquatic products.

Jiangsu has [[coal]], [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]] deposits, but its most significant mineral products are non-metal minerals such as [[halite]] (rock salt), [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], and [[marble]]. The city of Xuzhou is a coal hub of China. The salt mines of [[Huaiyin District, Huai'an|Huaiyin]] have more than 0.4 trillion [[tonne]]s of deposits, one of the greatest collections of deposits in China.

Jiangsu is historically oriented toward light industries such as [[textiles]] and [[food industry]]. Since 1949, Jiangsu has developed heavy industries such as [[chemical industry]] and [[construction material]]s. Jiangsu's important industries include machinery, electronic, chemicals, and automobile.<ref name="thechinaperspective1">{{cite web |url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/jiangsu-province/ |title=Jiangsu Province: Economic News and Statistics for Jiangsu's Economy |publisher=Thechinaperspective.com |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511201549/http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/jiangsu-province/ |archive-date=2013-05-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/data/province/jiangsu.html |title=Country Profile:Jiangsu province -People's Daily Online |publisher=English.peopledaily.com.cn |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527231804/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/data/province/jiangsu.html |archive-date=2013-05-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> The government has worked hard to promote the solar industry and hoped by 2012 the solar industry would be worth 100 billion RMB.<ref>[The China Perspective http://thechinaperspective.com/articles/jiangsusettoreacha100bphotovoltaicindustry6597/index.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119050017/http://thechinaperspective.com/articles/jiangsusettoreacha100bphotovoltaicindustry6597/index.html |date=2009-11-19 }}]</ref> Jiangsu’s economy growth has directly benefited from the reform Chinese’s policies, and its growth trajectory reflects that of many other coastal provinces, such as Zhejiang and Shandong. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wei|first=Yehua Dennis|last2=Fan|first2=C.

== Transportation ==

Jiangsu is home to one of the most extensive transportation networks in China.

=== Air ===
[[Nanjing Lukou International Airport]] {{airport codes|NKG}} serves as the major airport in the province, with flights to Tokyo, Osaka, Hong Kong, Seoul-Incheon, Frankfurt, Bangkok, Milan, Vancouver and Los Angeles. Other passenger airports include [[Changzhou Benniu Airport]], [[Sunan Shuofang International Airport]], [[Yangzhou Taizhou International Airport]], and [[Nantong Xingdong Airport]]. Air traffic in the populated [[Suzhou]] area is often diverted to [[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport]], to which Suzhou is conveniently connected to via bus services and by expressway.

[[Xuzhou Guanyin International Airport]], [[Yancheng Nanyang International Airport]], and [[Lianyungang Baitabu Airport]] serve as hubs in northern Jiangsu.

=== Rail ===
{{Main|Railways in Jiangsu}}
The southern part of the province, namely the Shanghai-Nanjing corridor, has very high-frequency rail services. Jiangsu is en route of the [[Jinghu railway]] from [[Beijing]] to [[Shanghai]], as well as the [[Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway|high speed line between the two cities]] completed in 2011. Since the completion of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed line, travel time between Beijing and Nanjing has been reduced to approximately four hours (from eleven hours previously); travel time between Nanjing and Shanghai on the fastest high-speed trains takes just over an hour.

Between the major urban centres of Suzhou and Nanjing, it is possible to catch a high-speed train every five to ten minutes during the day. The conventional and high-speed trains pass through [[Kunshan]], [[Suzhou]], [[Wuxi]], [[Changzhou]], [[Danyang, Jiangsu|Danyang]], [[Zhenjiang]], and [[Nanjing]]. [[Yangzhou]] has been connected by railway since 2004, and [[Yancheng]] since 2007. {{As of|2007}}, all major cities in Jiangsu except [[Suqian]] have been connected, though discussions are under way to connect Suqian with Xuzhou and Yancheng via intercity rail as of late 2014. The [[Xinchang Railway]] originates in [[Xinyi, Jiangsu|Xinyi]] and heads south, passing through [[Huai'an]], [[Yancheng]], [[Taizhou, Jiangsu|Taizhou]], [[Hai'an County|Hai'an]], [[Jiangyin]] and [[Yixing]].

[[Xuzhou]], a city in northeast Jiangsu, is a very important railway junction in the province as well as the whole of China. Its prominence as a railway hub dates back to at least the Mao era. In 1975, then Vice-Premier [[Deng Xiaoping]] targeted railway operations in Xuzhou as part of his overall economic reform efforts in the waning days of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Xuzhou is the crossing point of [[Longhai railway]] and Jinghu railway, and its railway station is among the largest in China. The Longhai railway terminates at port city of [[Lianyungang]] near the shore of the Pacific Ocean.

=== Road ===
Jiangsu's road network is one of the most developed in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.coicjs.org/News/Detail2-113.aspx|title=Jiangsu Chamber of International Commerce|work=coicjs.org|access-date=22 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417141641/http://en.coicjs.org/News/Detail2-113.aspx|archive-date=17 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[G2 Beijing–Shanghai Expressway|Beijing–Shanghai Expressway (G2)]] enters the province from the north and passes through Huai'an, Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Wuxi on the way to Shanghai; travelling from Shanghai westbound, G2 forks at [[Wuxi]] and continues onto Nanjing separately as G42, the [[Shanghai–Nanjing Expressway]], which serves the widely travelled southern corridor of the province. The [[Ningchang Expressway]] links Nanjing with [[Changzhou]]. The [[Suzhou]] area is extensively networked with expressways, going in all directions. The [[Yanhai Expressway]] links the coastal regions of the province, passing through [[Nantong]], [[Yancheng]], and [[Lianyungang]].

Historically, the province was divided by the Yangtze River into northern and southern regions. The first bridge across the river in Jiangsu, the [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], was completed in 1968 during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The second bridge crossing, [[Jiangyin Suspension Bridge|Jiangyin Bridge]], opened 30 years later at [[Jiangyin]]. As of October 2014, there were 11 [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|cross-Yangtze bridges]] in the province, including the five in Nanjing, which also has two cross-river tunnels. The Jiangyin Bridge ({{convert|1385|m|ft|abbr=on}}), [[Runyang Bridge]] (opened in 2005, connecting Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, {{convert|1490|m|ft|abbr=on}}), and [[Fourth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge|Fourth Nanjing Bridge]] (opened in 2012; {{convert|1418|m|ft|abbr=on}}) all rank among the ten [[List of longest suspension bridge spans|longest suspension bridges]] in the world. The [[Sutong Bridge]], opened in 2008, connecting Nantong and Changshu, has one of the [[List of longest cable-stayed bridge spans|longest]] [[cable-stayed bridge]] spans in the world, at {{convert|1088|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

=== Metro (subway) ===
As of September 2019, Jiangsu has five cities that have operational subway systems, together with two extra cities ([[Nantong]] and [[Huai'an]]) currently under construction. These five cities are [[Nanjing]], [[Suzhou]], [[Wuxi]], [[Changzhou]] and [[Xuzhou]] respectively.

[[Nanjing Metro]] was opened in September 2005. It was the sixth city in Mainland China that opened up a metro system. As of December 2019 the city currently has 10 metro lines ([[Line 1 (Nanjing Metro)|Line 1]], [[Line 2 (Nanjing Metro)|Line 2]], [[Line 3 (Nanjing Metro)|Line 3]], [[Line 4 (Nanjing Metro)|Line 4]], [[Line 10 (Nanjing Metro)|Line 10]], [[Line S1 (Nanjing Metro)|Line S1]], [[Line S3 (Nanjing Metro)|Line S3]], [[Line S7 (Nanjing Metro)|Line S7]], [[Line S8 (Nanjing Metro)|Line S8]] and [[Line S9 (Nanjing Metro)|Line S9]]), with several extra ones (i.e. [[Line 5 (Nanjing Metro)|Line 5]]) under construction.

[[Suzhou Rail Transit]], also known as Suzhou Metro, was opened in April 2012. As of December 25, 2019, it currently has four operational lines: [[Line 1 (Suzhou Rail Transit)|Line 1]], [[Line 2 (Suzhou Rail Transit)|Line 2]], [[Line 3 (Suzhou Rail Transit)|Line 3]] and [[Line 4 (Suzhou Rail Transit)|Line 4]]. It also has five other lines under construction ([[Line 5 (Suzhou Rail Transit)|Line 5]], [[Line 6 (Suzhou Rail Transit)|Line 6]], [[Line 7 (Suzhou Rail Transit)|Line 7]], [[Line 8 (Suzhou Rail Transit)|Line 8]], [[Line S1 (Suzhou Rail Transit)|Line S1]]) and 11 lines under planning (Lines [[Line 9 (Suzhou Rail Transit)|9]], [[Line 10 (Suzhou Rail Transit)|10]], 11 through 16, Line 18, Line 20, [[Line S4 (Suzhou Rail Transit)|Line S4]], [[Line S5 (Suzhou Rail Transit)|Line S5]]). Currently under construction lines will be operational by 2024 and planning lines will be operational by 2035.

[[Wuxi Metro]] was opened in July 2014. The system is currently composed of two operational lines: [[Line 1 (Wuxi Metro)|Line 1]] and [[Line 2 (Wuxi Metro)|Line 2]].

[[Changzhou Metro]] was opened in September 2019. The system currently only has one line operational, [[Line 1 (Changzhou Metro)|Line 1]].

[[Xuzhou Metro]] was opened in September 2019, few days after when [[Changzhou Metro]] started operation. The system currently only has one line operational, [[Line 1 (Xuzhou Metro)|Line 1]].

[[Nantong Metro]] started construction in 2017. It will start operation beginning in 2022.

[[Huai'an Metro]], also known as Huai'an Rail System, began construction in November 2018. There are seven lines planned: Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 5, Line S1, and Line S2. It will start operation before 2025.

== Culture ==
The four mass migrations in the 4th, 8th, 12th and 14th centuries had been influential in shaping the regional culture of Jiangsu. According to dialects and the other factors, the province can be roughly segmented four major cultural subdivisions: Wu ({{lang|zh-hans|吴}}), Jinling ({{lang|zh|金陵}}), Huaiyang ({{lang|zh-hans|淮扬}}) and Xuhuai ({{lang|zh|徐淮}}), from southeast to northwest.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} The belts of transition blurred the boundaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jssdfz.jiangsu.gov.cn/col/col59258/index.html|script-title=zh:江苏省地方志 文化|website=jssdfz.jiangsu.gov.cn|access-date=2017-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231212358/http://jssdfz.jiangsu.gov.cn/col/col59258/index.html|archive-date=2017-12-31|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title="Jiangsu Provincial Geography" (in Chinese)|publisher=Beijing Normal University Publishing Group|year=2011|isbn=9787303131686|location=Beijing}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://xcb.huaian.gov.cn/xcbdwjs/zcfg/content/75812.html|script-title=zh:江苏省2001-2010年文化大省建设规划纲要 淮安宣传网-中共淮安市委宣传部主办|publisher=Huai'an People's Government|website=xcb.huaian.gov.cn|access-date=2017-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231212148/http://xcb.huaian.gov.cn/xcbdwjs/zcfg/content/75812.html|archive-date=2017-12-31|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Wuxi opera]], a form of traditional [[Chinese opera]], is popular in [[Wuxi]], while [[Huaiju]] is popular further north, around [[Yancheng]]. [[Jiangsu cuisine]] is one of the eight great traditions of the [[cuisine of China]].

[[Suzhou]] is also well known for its silk, [[Chinese embroidery]], [[jasmine tea]], stone bridges, [[pagodas]], and classical gardens. Nearby [[Yixing]] is noted for its [[teaware]] while Yangzhou is known for its [[lacquerware]] and [[jadeware]]. [[Nanjing]]'s ''[[yunjin]]'' is a noted type of woven silk.

Since ancient times, south Jiangsu has been famed for its prosperity and opulence, and simply inserting south Jiangsu place names (Suzhou, Yangzhou, etc.) into poetry gave an effect of dreaminess,{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} as was indeed done by many famous poets. In particular, the fame of Suzhou (as well as [[Hangzhou]] in neighbouring [[Zhejiang]]) has led to the popular saying: {{lang|zh-hant|上有天堂，下有蘇杭}} ("above there is heaven; below there are Suzhou and [[Hangzhou]]"), a saying that continues to be a source of pride for the people of these two still prosperous cities. Similarly, the prosperity of Yangzhou has led poets to dream of: {{lang|zh-hant|腰纏十萬貫，騎鶴下揚州}} ("with a hundred thousand [[Ancient Chinese currency|strings of coins]] wrapped around its waist, a [[crane (bird)|crane]] landed in Yangzhou").
