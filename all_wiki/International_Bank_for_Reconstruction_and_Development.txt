The '''International Bank for Reconstruction and Development''' ('''IBRD''') is an [[international financial institution]], established in 1944 and headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]], that is the lending arm of  [[World Bank Group]]. The IBRD offers [[loan]]s to middle-income [[developing country|developing countries]]. The IBRD is the first of five member institutions that compose the World Bank Group. The initial mission of the IBRD in 1944, was to finance the reconstruction of European nations devastated by World War II. The IBRD and its [[concessional funding|concessional]] lending arm, the [[International Development Association]] (IDA), are collectively known as the [[World Bank]] as they share the same leadership and staff.<ref name="Ottenhoff 2011">{{Cite report | title = World Bank | publisher = Center for Global Development | date = 2011 | author = Ottenhoff, Jenny | url = http://cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1425482 | access-date = 5 June 2012}}</ref><ref name="World Bank History 2012">{{Cite web | title = History | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank | url = http://go.worldbank.org/65Y36GNQB0 | archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20160519235055/http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/history | url-status = dead | archive-date = 19 May 2016 | access-date = 17 July 2012 }}</ref><ref name="IBRD Background 2012">{{Cite web | title = Background | publisher = World Bank Group | author = International Bank for Reconstruction and Development | url = http://go.worldbank.org/D6IEM83I10 | archive-url = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100816120108/http://go.worldbank.org/D6IEM83I10 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 16 August 2010 | access-date = 17 July 2012 }}</ref>

Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate expanded to advancing worldwide [[economic development]] and [[poverty reduction|eradicating poverty]]. The IBRD provides commercial-grade or concessional financing to [[sovereign state]]s to fund projects that seek to improve transportation and [[infrastructure]], education, domestic policy, [[environmentalism|environmental consciousness]], energy investments, healthcare, access to food and [[drinking water|potable water]], and access to [[improved sanitation]].

The IBRD is owned and governed by its 189 member states, with each country represented on the Board of Governors. The IBRD has its own executive leadership and staff which conduct its normal business operations. The Bank's member governments are [[shareholder]]s which contribute and have the right to vote on its matters. In addition to contributions from its member nations, the IBRD acquires most of its capital by borrowing on international [[capital market]]s through bond issues at a preferred rate because of its AAA credit rating.

In 2011, it raised US$29 billion in capital from bond issues made in 26 different currencies. The Bank offers a number of financial services and products, including flexible loans, grants, risk guarantees, financial derivatives, and catastrophic risk financing. It reported lending commitments of $26.7 billion made to 132 projects in 2011.

==Governance==
There are five "closely associated institutions" that each have a "distinct role"<ref name="OECD_Climate_20181128">{{Cite web| title = OECD, UN Environment and World Bank call for a radical shift in financing for a low-carbon, climate-resilient future |publisher=OECD|access-date=24 February 2020|date= 28 November 2018| url = https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/oecd-un-environment-and-world-bank-call-for-a-radical-shift-in-financing-for-a-low-carbon-climate-resilient-future.htm}}</ref> and together form the World Bank—the IBRD, the [[International Development Association]] (IDA), the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC), that "invests in private firms and promotes entrepreneurship",<ref name="economist_20190409"/> the [[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency]] (MIGA), that guarantees loans, and the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID). Their mission is to "fight poverty and improve living standards for people in the developing world."<ref name="OECD_Climate_20181128"/> By 2018, the World Bank Group was "one of the world's largest sources of funding and knowledge for developing countries."<ref name="OECD_Climate_20181128"/> Of the five institutions, the IBRD and the IDA are the World Bank's two largest units.<ref name="economist_20190409"/> When a country reaches a GDP per person over US$1,145, they are no longer eligible for IDA financial support. For example, of the BRIC countries, China was no longer eligible in 1999 and by 2014, neither was India.<ref name="economist_20190409"/>

The IBRD is governed by the World Bank's Board of Governors which meets annually and consists of one governor per member country (most often the country's finance minister or treasury secretary). The Board of Governors delegates most of its authority over daily matters such as lending and operations to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors consists of 25 executive directors<ref name="IBRD_BoG_20200221">{{Citation| title = IBRD Governors|access-date=24 February 2020| url = http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/627731541108831255/BankGovernors.pdf |work=World Bank |date=21 February 2020}}</ref> and is chaired by the [[World Bank Group#Presidency|President of the World Bank Group]].

==Background==
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) were established by delegates at the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] in 1944 and became operational in 1946.<ref name="UN Monetary & Financial Conference 1949">{{Cite conference | title = Proceedings and Documents of the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference | conference = United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, July 1–22, 1944 | publisher = U.S. Department of State | location = Washington, D.C. | year = 1948 | url = https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/430 | access-date = 2012-07-17}}</ref> According to a March 2012 ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article, IBRD was the "original 'world bank'".<ref name="WaPo_Schneider_20120319">{{Cite news| issn = 0190-8286| last = Schneider| first = Howard| title = In a globalized world, what role for the World Bank?| work = Washington Post|access-date=24 February 2020| date = 19 March 2012| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-a-globalized-world-what-role-for-the-world-bank/2012/03/19/gIQARUhyNS_story.html}}</ref>

IBRD field offices were opened in [[Paris]], France, [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, and [[Prague]] in the former Czechoslovakia.<ref name="World Bank Timeline 2012">{{Cite web | title = Interactive Timeline | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank | url = https://www.worldbank.org/wb/about/timeline.htm?iframe=true&width=1020&height=620 | access-date = 21 July 2012}}</ref>

The IBRD was established with the original mission of financing the reconstruction efforts of war-torn European nations following World War II,<ref name="economist_20190409">{{Cite news| issn = 0013-0613| title = How does the World Bank work?| work = The Economist|access-date=24 February 2020 |date=9 April 2019| url = https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2019/04/09/how-does-the-world-bank-work}}</ref> with goals shared by the later [[Marshall Plan]]. The Bank issued its inaugural loan of $250 million ($2.6 billion in 2012 dollars<ref name="BLS 2012">{{Cite web | title = CPI Inflation Calculator | publisher = U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | url = http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm | access-date = 20 June 2012}}</ref>) to France in 1947 to finance infrastructure projects.

In 1946, a few months after in became operational, Chile sought financial help from the IBRD—the first of the developing countries to do so.<ref name="economist_20190409"/>

Throughout the remainder of the 1940s and 1950s, the Bank financed projects seeking to dam rivers, generate electricity, and improve access to water and sanitation. It also invested in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg's steel industry. Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate has transitioned to eradicating poverty around the world.

In 1960, the [[International Development Association]] (IDA) was established to serve as the Bank's concessional lending arm and provide low and no-cost finance and grants to the poorest of the developing countries as measured by gross national income per capita.<ref name="World Bank History 2012" />

At the time of its creation, the IBRD was the only [[Multilateral Development Bank]]. During the period of [[decolonization]]—the mid‐1950s to the mid‐1970s—a number of MDB's were created—the [[International Finance Corporation]], the [[International Development Association]]. They were both WBG members.<ref name="globalpolicy_Wang_201702">{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Hongying |title=New Multilateral Development Banks: Opportunities and Challenges for Global Governance |journal=Global Policy |date=7 February 2017 |volume=8 |issue=1 |page=115 |doi=10.1111/1758-5899.12396 |doi-access=free }}</ref> During this period other MDBs  that were similar to the IBRD in their governance and operations, were established by countries that were not member nations of the WBG. This included the Inter‐American Development Bank (IDB), the [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB), the [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB), the [[Andean Development Corporation]] (CAF), and the [[Islamic Development Bank]] (IsDB). Both the CAF and IsDB are "primarily owned and controlled by borrower countries."<ref name="globalpolicy_Wang_201702"/>

In the early 1990s, European nations established the [[European Bank of Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD) and expanded [[European Investment Bank]], to foster European integration and to assist post‐communist countries to transform their economies to become more market‐oriented.<ref name="globalpolicy_Wang_201702"/>

By 2012, according to ''The Post'',  IBRD was using "its AAA credit rating to sell bonds at interest rates close to those of U.S. Treasury bonds." It loaned money to developing nations, such as China and Brazil.<ref name="WaPo_Schneider_20120319"/>

According to the ''[[Global Policy]]'', journal, While the IBRD and the IDA historically prioritized funding infrastructure projects, since the 1990s, the Bank has directed less lending to infrastructure projects in favor of other development projects such as fighting [[climate change]], eradicating poverty and ensuring good governance.<ref name="globalpolicy_Wang_201702"/>

==Financial model==
The IBRD finances its activities from the shares its members hold, as well as borrowing on international capital markets by issuing World Bank [[bond (finance)|bonds]]. The Bank raised US$54.0 billion worth of capital in fiscal 2019 from bonds issued in 27 different [[currency|currencies]].<ref name="World Bank Annual Report 2019">{{Cite report |title=The World Bank Annual Report 2019 |publisher=World Bank Group |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTANNREP2011/Resources/8070616-1315496634380/WBAR11_YearInReview.pdf |access-date=20 July 2012}}</ref>

Since 1959, the IBRD, which is backed by world governments<ref name="economist_20190409"/> has had a triple-A [[bond credit rating|credit rating]] since 1959, which allows it to borrow capital at lower rates.<ref name="IBRD Funding 2012">{{Cite web | title = How IBRD is Financed | publisher = World Bank Group | author = International Bank for Reconstruction and Development | url = https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/annual-report/world-bank-group-downloads | access-date = 14 October 2019}}</ref>

According to a 2015 article, commissioned by the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development—also known as the [[Group of 24]] (G-24)—multilateral development banks (MDBs)—such as the IBRD—"represent one of the most successful types of international organization created in the post-World War II era." By October 2015, although the WBG—with its lending arms—was the only "global institution,<ref name="globalpolicy_Wang_201702"/>{{rp|1}} there were more than twenty operational 20 MDBs in the world.<ref name="G24_Humphrey_2015">{{citation |last=Humphrey |first=Chris |date=30 October 2015 |title=Are Credit Rating Agencies Limiting the Operational Capacity of Multilateral Development Banks? |url=https://g24.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/G24-CRA-October30.pdf|access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref> In 2016, the [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]] and [[BRIC]]s [[New Development Bank]] began operations.<ref name="G24_Humphrey_2015"/> Like other multilateral development banks, (MDBs), the IBRD has a [[Preferential creditor|preferred credit treatment]] (PCT), through which borrowers grant the MDBs a "privileged position to be first in line for repayment, should a country face financial restrictions."<ref name="G24_Humphrey_2015"/>{{rp|5}}

The bank also generates income from the return on its equity and from the small margins on the loans. As the IBRD does not seek profit, it transfers part of its excess income to the IDA ($259 million in fiscal 2019).<ref name="World Bank Annual Report 2019"/>

In 2011, the IBRD loaned about US$26 billion, which represented just a "fraction of the $72 billion the IMF approved as a credit line to a single nation, Mexico."<ref name="WaPo_Schneider_20120319"/> In the early 2010s, the total of "capital investments in emerging markets from all sources have topped $1 trillion annually".<ref name="WaPo_Schneider_20120319"/> According to the [[Institute of International Finance]], in 2011, the "combined net investment of the World Bank and other international development banks and agencies" was about $20 billion in 2011.<ref name="WaPo_Schneider_20120319"/>

According to a 2019 ''[[The Economist]]'' article, the IBRD is "more controversial" than the International Development Association (IDA) lending arm. With its AAA credit rating, the IBRD can "borrow money cheaply on the international financial markets".<ref name="economist_20190409"/> Middle-income countries, like Brazil and China that currently borrow from the IBRD, could "borrow in abundance from foreign investors" on their own.<ref name="economist_20190409"/>
