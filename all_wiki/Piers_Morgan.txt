'''Piers Stefan Pughe-Morgan'''  ({{IPAc-en|p|ɪər|s}}; ''[[Birth name|né]]'' '''O'Meara'''; born 30 March 1965) is an English broadcaster, journalist, writer, and television personality. He is currently a co-presenter of the [[ITV Breakfast]] programme ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' from Monday to Wednesday each week.

Morgan began his career in 1989 in [[Fleet Street]] as a writer and editor for several British tabloids, including ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', ''[[News of the World]]'', and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''. In 1994, aged 29, he was appointed editor of the ''News of the World'' by [[Rupert Murdoch]], which made him the youngest editor of a British national newspaper in more than half a century.<ref name="Davies1994"/> On television, Morgan has hosted his own talk shows ''[[Piers Morgan's Life Stories]]'' (2009–present) and ''[[Piers Morgan Live]]'' (2011–2014), co-presented the breakfast programme ''Good Morning Britain'' (2014–present) with [[Susanna Reid]]'','' and judged on the talent competition shows ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' (2006–2011) and ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' (2007–2010).<ref>{{cite web|last=Nudd|first=Tim|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20544255,00.html|title=Piers Morgan Leaving America's Got Talent|newspaper=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=CNN cancels Piers Morgan Live {{!}} CBC News|language=en-US|work=CBC|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/piers-morgan-s-cnn-show-cancelled-after-3-years-1.2548831|access-date=2020-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2010-09-11|title=Piers Morgan is Larry King's CNN replacement - Entertainment - Television - TODAYshow.com|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911024937/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39060518/ns/today-entertainment|access-date=2020-11-17|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> In 2008, he won the seventh season of the US ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. Season 7)|Celebrity Apprentice]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Caitlin |date=28 March 2008 |title=Relative unknown wins 'Celebrity Apprentice' |url=http://www.today.com/id/23838097/ns/today-entertainment/t/relative-unknown-wins-celebrity-apprentice |work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] |accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/08/01/piers-morgan-has-been-replaced-on-good-morning-britain/1/?tse_id=INF_6f69916076e411e785e8bfcdfe5d7856|title=Piers Morgan has been replaced on Good Morning Britain|work=PinkNews|access-date=9 August 2017}}</ref> Morgan has also written eight books, including four volumes of memoirs.

Morgan's outspoken views and controversial comments on ''Good Morning Britain'' have led to thousands of complaints to [[Ofcom]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=O'Sullivan|first=Kyle|date=2019-11-05|title=Piers Morgan cleared by Ofcom over 950 complaints - but Susanna Reid in trouble|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/piers-morgan-cleared-ofcom-over-20813491|access-date=2020-11-17|website=mirror|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-04-11|title=Piers Morgan escapes censure over Christian homophobe remark|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/11/piers-morgan-escapes-censure-over-christian-homophobe-remark|access-date=2020-11-17|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> While working at ''Daily Mirror'', he was in charge during the period that the paper was implicated in the [[News International phone hacking scandal|phone hacking scandal]].

The following year, he was criticised in the findings of the [[Leveson Inquiry]] by chair [[Brian Leveson]] who stated that comments made in Morgan's testimony about phone hacking were "utterly unpersuasive" and "that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole".<ref name="Mark Sweney">{{cite news |last=Sweney |first=Mark |date=30 November 2012 |title=Piers Morgan claims over phone hacking branded 'utterly unpersuasive' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/30/piers-morgan-phone-hacking-leveson-inquiry |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=24 December 2012}}</ref>

==Press career==
===At the Murdoch titles===
Morgan began to work as a freelance at ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' in 1988, at this point dropping his [[double-barrelled name]]. He told [[Hunter Davies]] in December 1994 that he was personally recruited by ''Sun'' editor [[Kelvin MacKenzie]] to work on the newspaper's show business column "Bizarre", his first high-profile post.<ref name="Davies1994"/> Although he was not a fan of pop music, he was considered skilled at self-publicity and became the column's main writer. "I became the Friend of the Stars, a rampant egomaniac, pictured all the time with famous people – [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Sylvester Stallone|Stallone]], [[David Bowie|Bowie]], [[Paul McCartney]], hundreds of them. It was shameless, as they didn't know me from Adam", he told Davies.<ref name="Davies1994"/>

In January 1994, he became editor of the ''[[News of the World]]'' after being appointed to the job by [[Rupert Murdoch]]. Initially an acting editor, he was confirmed in the summer, becoming at 29 the youngest national newspaper editor in more than half a century.<ref name="Davies1994"/>

Morgan left this post in 1995 shortly after publishing photographs of [[Victoria Aitken|Catherine Victoria Lockwood]], then wife of [[Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer|Charles, Earl Spencer]], leaving an addictive disorders clinic in Surrey.<ref>{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Rhys |date=12 May 1995 |title=Murdoch lashes editor shock |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/murdoch-lashes-editor-shock-1619121.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref> This action ran against the editors' code of conduct,<ref name="BBC2004">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3713857.stm "Profile: Piers Morgan"], BBC News, 14 May 2004</ref> a misdemeanour for which the [[Press Complaints Commission]] upheld a complaint against Morgan.<ref name="BBC2004"/> Murdoch was reported as having said that "the boy went too far"<ref>Ginny Dougary [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/books/article2451447.ece "Educating Piers"], ''The Times Magazine'', 7 April 2007. {{subscription}}</ref> and publicly distanced himself from the story.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/47847.stm "Earl Spencer loses privacy battle to Europe"], BBC News, 16 January 1998</ref> Fearful of a privacy law action if he had not criticised one of his employees, Murdoch is said to have apologised to Morgan in private.<ref>Tom Watson and Martin Hickman [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lel9DjaPgqEC&pg=PT30 ''Dial M for Murdoch: News Corporation and the Corruption of Britain''], London: Penguin, 2012, p. 30</ref><ref>Benjamin Wallace [http://nymag.com/news/media/piers-morgan-2011-10/index1.html "Piers Morgan Isn’t Sleeping Well"], ''New York'' (magazine), 9 October 2011</ref>

The incident was reported to have contributed to Morgan's decision to leave for the ''Daily Mirror'' editorship.<ref name="Summerskill">{{cite news |last=Summerskill |first=Ben |author-link=Ben Summerskill |date=1 September 2002 |title=Has Piers now got news for Ian? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/sep/01/pressandpublishing.uknews |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref> Morgan's autobiography ''[[The Insider: The Private Diaries of a Scandalous Decade|The Insider]]'' states that he left the ''News of the World'' for the ''Mirror'' of his own choice.

===''Daily Mirror'' editor===
As editor of the ''Daily Mirror'', Morgan was forced to apologise on television for the headline (rendered in upper case) "Achtung Surrender! For You Fritz Ze Euro Championship Is Over" on 25 June 1996, a day before [[England national football team|England]] met [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in a semi-final of the [[1996 European Football Championship|Euro '96]] football championships.<ref>{{cite news |last=Maguire |first=Kevin |author-link=Kevin Maguire (journalist) |date=25 February 2002 |title=The New Statesman Profile – Piers Morgan |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/142285 |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |location=London |accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Byrne |first=Ciar |date=15 May 2004 |title=Piers Morgan: The man with no moral compass who found his destiny in a steadfast opposition to war |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/piers-morgan-the-man-with-no-moral-compass-who-found-his-destiny-in-a-steadfast-opposition-to-war-6169902.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref><ref>George Wilkes and Dominic Wing "The British Press and European Integration: 1948 to 1996", in David Baker, David Seawright (eds.)

Morgan was the subject of an investigation in 2000 after Suzy Jagger wrote an article for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' revealing that he had bought [[pound sterling|£]]20,000 worth of shares in the computer company [[Viglen]] soon before the ''Mirror'' 's "City Slickers" column tipped Viglen as a good buy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jagger |first=Suzy |title=Mirror editor saw his shares soar after paper tipped company |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/02/02/nmir02.html |url-status=dead |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021122223139/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F2000%2F02%2F02%2Fnmir02.html |archivedate=22 November 2002 |accessdate=13 January 2015 }}</ref> Morgan was found by the [[Press Complaints Commission]] to have breached the Code of Conduct on financial journalism, but kept his job.

Morgan appeared on ITV's ''[[Loose Women]]'' panel show in late January 2017, and was challenged to repudiate Trump.<ref name=LooseWomen/> He refused to do so, despite stating that he disagreed with him on many issues relating to [[gun control]], [[Climate change in the United States|climate change]], abortion, and the [[Executive Order 13769|"Muslim travel ban"]], saying that he found the principle of the ban understandable, but disagreed with "the way [Trump] has gone about it".<ref name=LooseWomen>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/30/piers-morgan-defends-friendship-with-donald-trump|title=Piers Morgan defends friendship with Donald Trump|work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=31 January 2017|accessdate=1 February 2017}}</ref>

Nearly a fortnight later, on the American talk show ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', Morgan said "There is no [[Trump travel ban|Muslim ban]]", as "85% of the world's [[Muslims]] are allowed in the country".

Morgan criticised Trump after he retweeted [[Jayda Fransen]], deputy leader of the small right-wing party [[Britain First]] in late November 2017.

In April 2020, during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Morgan wrote a highly critical article of Trump's handling of the crisis in his column for [[MailOnline]].

== Controversies ==
===Ian Hislop feud===
Morgan appeared as a guest on the [[BBC]] satirical news quiz ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' in an episode transmitted on 24 May 1996.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/have-i-got-news-for-you/felix-dexter-piers-morgan-clive-anderson/episode/143355/summary.html Have I Got News for You Episode Guide > Season 11, Episode 6] TV.com</ref> In it, show regular [[Ian Hislop]] accused Morgan of having him [[Stalking|followed]] and having his house watched. The conflict escalated and at one point the host, [[Angus Deayton]], asked if they wished to go outside and have a fight. Later on, guest panellist [[Clive Anderson]] confronted Morgan commenting, "the last time I was rude to you, you sent photographers to my doorstep the next day", to which Piers Morgan retorted, "You won't see them this time." The audience responded loudly in favour of Hislop.<ref>''[[Have I Got News For You]]'' BBC2, Series 11 episode 6; Transmitted on 24 May 1996</ref> "We're about to start exposing the moon-faced midget", Morgan was quoted as saying in 2002, to which Hislop responded, "all he's been offering for information about my private life is a £50 reward. My friends think that's not nearly enough."<ref name="Summerskill" />

In 2007, Hislop chose Morgan as one of his pet hates on ''[[Room 101 (British TV series)|Room 101]]''.<ref name=R101>''[[Room 101 (British TV series)|Room 101]]'' BBC2, Series 11 episode 6; Transmitted on 9 February 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/room_101/episodes/11/6/ Room 101 Episode 11.6 – Ian Hislop] British Comedy Guide</ref> In doing so, Hislop spoke of the history of animosity between himself and Morgan and said that after their exchange on ''Have I Got News For You'' (which was shown as a clip), Morgan's reporters were tasked with trying to get gossip on Hislop's private life (including phoning acquaintances of Hislop), and photographers were sent in case Hislop did anything untoward or embarrassing while in their presence. Neither the reporters nor the photographers succeeded. Hislop also said that Morgan had attempted to quell the feud in an article in ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'', saying, "The war is over.

In October 2003, journalist and television personality [[Jeremy Clarkson]] reportedly emptied a glass of water over Morgan during the last flight of [[Concorde]] for some photographs published in the ''Mirror''.<ref name="Media Monkey">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/mar/17/mediamonkey.pressandpublishing|author=Media Monkey|title=Clarkson and Morgan in tabloid tussle|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 March 2004|accessdate=8 June 2008}}</ref> In March 2004, at the [[British Press Awards]], Clarkson punched Morgan three times during another argument.<ref name="Media Monkey"/>

On 4 February 2014, transgender advocate [[Janet Mock]] appeared as a guest on ''Piers Morgan Live'' to discuss her memoir, ''Redefining Realness''.

Morgan responded that he had "never been treated in such a disgraceful manner" by a guest. On 5 February, Mock appeared as a guest again to debate the dispute.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hedgecock |first=Sarah |url=http://gawker.com/piers-morgan-demands-apology-from-disgraceful-trans-w-1516913568 |title=Piers Morgan Demands Apology from "Disgraceful" Trans Woman Guest |accessdate=6 February 2014 |newspaper=Gawker |date=5 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206203218/http://gawker.com/piers-morgan-demands-apology-from-disgraceful-trans-w-1516913568 |archivedate= 6 February 2014}}</ref>

Morgan strongly objected to the [[2017 Women's March|Women's March on Washington]] on 21 January 2017, the day after [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|Trump's inauguration]], describing protesters as "rabid feminists" and the multiple protests as being "vacuous".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Oppenheim|first1=Maya|title=Piers Morgan just accused Ewan McGregor of being 'paedophile-loving hypocrite'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/piers-morgan-ewan-mcgregor-accuse-paedophile-loving-hypocrite-good-morning-britain-no-show-t2-a7543911.html|accessdate=27 February 2017|work=The Independent|date=24 January 2017}}</ref> The actor [[Ewan McGregor]] disagreed with Morgan's statements on the women's march and pulled out of appearing on ''Good Morning Britain'' the following Tuesday after discovering Morgan would be interviewing him, along with Reid.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38729770|title=Ewan McGregor and Piers Morgan row over Good Morning Britain appearance|work=BBC News|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref> Morgan accused McGregor of being a "paedophile-loving hypocrite" for his past support of [[Roman Polanski]].<ref name="Aitkenhead">{{cite news|last=Aitkenhead|first=Decca|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/28/piers-morgan-im-just-putting-opinions-out-there-its-my-job|title=Piers Morgan: 'I'm just putting opinions out there.

===Banned guests===
In May 2011, Morgan banned actor [[Hugh Grant]] from his shows on CNN and ITV after Grant spoke out against the need for the tabloid press.

On 28 March 2012, MTV referred to the bad relations between Morgan and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], reporting that "Morgan has apparently felt slighted over the years by Madonna...he claims he was lied to by the singer's publicist".<ref name="Kaufman">"Madonna Banned..." by Gil Kaufman, MTV, 28 March 2012; [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1681945/madonna-banned-piers-morgan.jhtml retrieved 30 September 2012]</ref>

In September 2012, it was reported that Morgan had also banned actor [[Kelsey Grammer]].

===Phone hacking allegations===
During Morgan's tenure as editor, the ''Daily Mirror'' was advised by Steven Nott that voicemail interception was possible by means of a standard PIN code. Despite staff initially expressing enthusiasm for the story it did not appear in the paper, although it did subsequently feature in a ''[[South Wales Argus]]'' article and on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] in October 1999. On 18 July 2011 Nott was visited by officers of [[Operation Weeting]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/this-scandal-is-all-my-fault-says-salesman-2332669.html|first=Matt|last=Blake|title=This scandal is all my fault, says salesman|newspaper=The Independent|date=6 August 2011|accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref>

He came under criticism for his "boasting" about phone hacking from [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Louise Mensch]], who has since apologised for these accusations.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14346050 |work=BBC News |title=MP Mensch apologises to Piers Morgan for hacking slur |date=29 July 2011}}</ref>

In July 2011, in a sequence of articles, political blogger [[Paul Staines]] alleged that while editor of the ''Daily Mirror'' in 2002 Morgan published a story concerning the affair of [[Sven-Goran Eriksson]] and [[Ulrika Jonsson]] while knowing it to have been obtained by [[phone hacking]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Young |first=Toby |author-link=Toby Young |date=29 July 2011 |title=The net closes around Piers Morgan |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100098912/the-net-closes-around-piers-morgan/ |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref>

On 20 December 2011, Morgan appeared as a witness by satellite link from the United States at the [[Leveson Inquiry]].<ref name="BBCLeverson">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16259941 "Piers Morgan tells Leveson: Daily Mirror did not hack phones"], BBC News, 20 December 2011</ref> While he said he had no reason to believe that phone hacking had occurred at the ''Mirror'' while he was in charge there, he admitted to hearing a recording of an answerphone message left by [[Paul McCartney]] for [[Heather Mills]], but refused to "discuss where that tape was played or who made [it] – it would compromise a source."<ref name="BBCLeverson"/> Appearing as a witness at the same Inquiry on 9 February 2012, Mills was asked under oath if she had ever made a recording of McCartney's phone call or had played it to Morgan; she replied: "Never".<ref name="anon">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/leveson-inquiry/9071901/Leveson-Inquiry-Heather-Mills-vows-she-did-not-play-Paul-McCartney-messages-to-Piers-Morgan.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|title=Leveson Inquiry: Heather Mills vows she did not play Paul McCartney messages to Piers Morgan|date=9 February 2012}}</ref><ref name="Michael Holden">{{cite web|author=Michael Holden|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/09/us-britain-hacking-morgan-idUSTRE8181CL20120209|agency=[[Reuters]]|title=Beatle's ex-wife says Piers Morgan heard hacked call|date=9 February 2012}}</ref> She said that she had never authorised Morgan, or anybody, to access or listen to her voicemails.<ref name="anon"/> Mills told the inquiry that Morgan, "a man that has written nothing but awful things about me for years", would have relished telling the inquiry if she had played a personal voicemail message to him.<ref name="Michael Holden"/>

On 23 May 2012, ''[[Newsnight]]'' presenter [[Jeremy Paxman]] was a witness at the Leveson Inquiry. He recalled a lunch with the ''Mirror'' editor in September 2002 at which Morgan outlined the means of hacking into a mobile phone.<ref>Dan Sabbagh and Lisa O'Carroll [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/23/leveson-piers-morgan-paxman "Piers Morgan told me how to hack a phone, says Jeremy Paxman"], ''The Guardian'', 23 May 2012.</ref>

On 28 November 2012, the [[Channel 4]] documentary ''Taking on the Tabloids'', fronted by actor and phone hacking victim [[Hugh Grant]], showed footage from a 2003 interview with Morgan by the singer and phone hacking victim [[Charlotte Church]], during which he explained to her how to avoid answerphone messages being listened to by journalists. He said: "You can access ... voicemails by typing in a number. Now, are you really telling me that journalists aren’t going to do that?"<ref>{{cite web|author=Matilda Battersby|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/video-from-2003-shows-piers-morgan-talking-about-phone-hacking-8364468.html|title=Video from 2003 shows Piers Morgan talking about phone hacking|newspaper=The Independent|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=24 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tntmagazine.com/news/uk/video-new-clip-surfaces-showing-piers-morgan-talking-to-charlotte-church-about-phone-hacking|title=Video: New clip surfaces showing Piers Morgan talking to Charlotte Church about phone hacking|newspaper=[[TNT (magazine)|TNT]]|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=24 December 2012}}</ref>

On 29 November 2012, the official findings of the [[Leveson Inquiry]] were released, in which [[Lord Justice Leveson]] said that Morgan's testimony under oath on phone hacking was "utterly unpersuasive". He stated:  "[The] evidence does not establish that [Morgan] authorised the hacking of voicemails or that journalists employed by TMG [Trinity Mirror Group] were indulging in this practice ... What it does, however, clearly prove is that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke about it."<ref name="Mark Sweney"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.itv.com/news/2012-11-28/key-moments-from-the-leveson-inquiry |title=Key moments from the Leveson Inquiry |publisher=ITV News |date=28 November 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}</ref>

===Ofcom complaints===
During his career at ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'', Morgan has been the subject of thousands of complaints to the British watchdog, [[Ofcom]], relating to controversial comments. 

In 2015, Morgan was criticised by Ofcom for laughing as a guest repeatedly used the F-word live on air. Although Ofcom did not take action as his co-presenter [[Susanna Reid]] quickly apologised, the watchdog expressed concern at his behaviour.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/15/piers-morgan-good-morning-britain-swearing|title=Piers Morgan criticised for laughing as Good Morning Britain guest swore on air|date=15 June 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=14 February 2020|last2=agencies|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In 2016, Ofcom received 70 complaints in relation to comments made by Morgan during interview with Christian magistrate Richard Page about gay marriage, that viewers felt "implied Christians were homophobic".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/ofcom-clears-piers-morgan-over-christianity-questions-on-good-morning-britain-34617691.html|title=Ofcom clears Piers Morgan over Christianity questions on Good Morning Britain|website=independent|access-date=14 February 2020}}</ref> Ofcom confirmed on 13 April 2016 that Morgan would not be investigated for his comments.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/11/piers-morgan-escapes-censure-over-christian-homophobe-remark|title=Piers Morgan escapes censure over Christian homophobe remark|date=11 April 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=14 February 2020|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> On 22 January 2018, during a story about a homeless [[Special Air Service|SAS]] veteran, who had a petition set up in his name calling on his local council to provide him with social housing, Morgan had refused to read out [[Herefordshire Council]]'s statement.

On 11 September 2019, Morgan claimed he identified himself as "a penguin" in response to a news piece relating to gender neutrality, and said "the world has gone nuts" over gender. This attracted 950 [[Ofcom]] complaints from viewers. He was cleared of any wrongdoing in November 2019, and in response, Morgan admitted "he was personally quite pleased" with having one of the highest number of complaints to any British TV show in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/piers-morgan-feels-empowered-receiving-record-breaking-complaints-identifying-penguin-11042269/|title=Piers Morgan ‘empowered’ after complaints for identifying as a penguin|date=5 November 2019|website=Metro|access-date=14 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/piers-morgan-cleared-ofcom-over-20813491|title=Piers Morgan cleared by Ofcom over 950 complaints – but Susanna Reid in trouble|last=O'Sullivan|first=Kyle|date=5 November 2019|website=mirror|access-date=14 February 2020}}</ref>
