She also previously served as the 51st [[President of Argentina]] from 2007 to 2015<ref>https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/nuestro-pais/galeria-de-presidentes</ref> and the first lady during the tenure of her husband, [[Néstor Kirchner]]. She was the [[List of elected or appointed female deputy heads of state|third woman]] to hold the Argentine vice presidency, the second woman to hold the presidency, the first directly elected [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female president]], and the first woman re-elected to the office. Ideologically, she identifies herself as a [[Peronist]] and a [[social democracy|social democrat]] on the [[Politics of Argentina|Argentine center-left]], with her political approach called [[Kirchnerism]].

Born in [[La Plata]], [[Buenos Aires Province]], she studied law at the [[University of La Plata]], and moved to Patagonia with her husband [[Néstor Kirchner]] upon graduation. She was elected to the provincial legislature; her husband was elected mayor of [[Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz|Río Gallegos]]. She was elected national senator in 1995, and had a controversial tenure, while her husband was elected governor of [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz Province]]. In 1994, she was also elected to the constituent assembly that [[1994 amendment of the Constitution of Argentina|amended]] the [[Constitution of Argentina]]. She was the [[First Lady]] from 2003 to 2007 after her husband was elected president.

Néstor Kirchner did not run for reelection. Instead, his wife was the candidate for the [[Front for Victory]] party, becoming president in the [[Argentine general election, 2007|2007 presidential election]]. Her first term of office started with a [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector|conflict with the agricultural sector]], and her proposed taxation system was rejected. After this she nationalised private pension funds, and [[Bicentennial fund|fired]] the president of the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]]. The price of public services remained subsidised, the country lost its self-supply of energy, and she [[Renationalization of YPF|renationalized energy firm YPF]] as a result. The country had good relations with other South American nations, and severed relations with the [[western bloc]], a local movement known as ''[[pink tide]]''. She also continued her husband's human rights policies, and had a [[Conflict between Kirchnerism and the media|rocky relationship]] with the press. Néstor Kirchner [[Death and state funeral of Néstor Kirchner|died]] in 2010, and she was later reelected in 2011. She established [[Argentine currency controls (2011–15)|currency controls]] during her second term, and the country fell into [[sovereign default]] in 2014.

During her two terms as president, several corruption scandals took place and subsequently her government faced several demonstrations against her rule.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Cristina Fernández de Kirchner-joven.jpg|thumb|left|Cristina Kirchner during her youth]]
Cristina Fernández was born on 19 February 1953 at Tolosa, a suburb of [[La Plata]], capital of the [[Buenos Aires Province]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/20/cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner-argentina-president-political-turmoil|title= Cristina Fernández de Kirchner: is the fairytale ending for Argentina's new Evita?|author= Uki Goñi|date= 21 February 2015|newspaper= The Guardian|accessdate= 26 July 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160725211547/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/20/cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner-argentina-president-political-turmoil|archivedate= 25 July 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref> She is the daughter of Eduardo Fernández and Ofelia Esther Wilhelm. Eduardo Fernández, a bus driver, was anti-Peronist and Wilhelm was a Peronist union leader. Wilhelm was a single mother. Fernández married her and moved into her house when Cristina was two years old. Most details about her childhood such as her elementary school are unknown.<ref name="presidenta">{{cite web|url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/968048-cristina-la-presidenta|title= Cristina, la presidenta|trans-title= Cristina, the president|language= Spanish|author= Carlos Pagni|date= 9 December 2015|newspaper= La Nación|accessdate= 26 July 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6CzRFOXDc?url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/968048-cristina-la-presidenta|archivedate= 18 December 2012|df= dmy-all}}</ref> She attended high school at Popular Mercantil and Misericordia schools.<ref name="presidenta"/> Three of her grandparents were Spanish immigrants, specifically from Galicia<ref name="LUIS LOPEZ POMBO">{{cite web |last1=CRISTINA FERNANDEZ DE KRISCHNER |first1=GENEALOGÍA |title=EL PORTAL DE GALICIA PARA EL MUNDO |url=https://www.galiciadigital.com/opinion/opinion.4244.php |website=GALICIA DIGITAL |publisher=LUIS LOPEZ POMBO |accessdate=26 June 2020}}</ref> and the other was born in Argentina in a family of German background.

She began her college studies at the [[National University of La Plata]]. She studied [[psychology]] for a year, then dropped it and studied law instead. She met fellow student [[Néstor Kirchner]] in 1973. He introduced her to political debates. There were heated political controversies at the time caused by the decline of the [[Argentine Revolution]] military government, the return of the former president [[Juan Perón]] from exile, the election of [[Héctor Cámpora]] as president of Argentina, and the early stages of the [[Dirty War]]. She became influenced by [[Peronism]], [[left-wing politics]], and [[anti-imperialism]].<ref name="presidenta" /> Despite the presence of sympathizers of the ''[[Montoneros]]'' guerrillas in La Plata, the Kirchners had never been involved themselves.<ref name="presidenta" /> Cristina and Néstor married in a civil ceremony on 9 May 1975.

Cristina proposed to move to [[Río Gallegos]], Néstor's home city, but he delayed their departure until his graduation on 3 July 1976.<ref name="presidenta"/>

Cristina had not yet graduated when they moved to Río Gallegos and completed the remaining subjects with [[distance education]]. There have been claims made that she never graduated, and that she may have worked as a lawyer without having a degree. This idea was proposed by the constitutionalist [[Daniel Sabsay]], and fueled by the reluctance of the [[National University of La Plata]] (UNLP) to release her degree.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://en.mercopress.com/2014/10/25/cristina-fernandez-challenged-to-show-her-law-degree-and-timerman-described-as-a-traitor|title= Cristina Fernandez challenged to show her law degree and Timerman described as a 'traitor'|date= 25 October 2014|publisher= Merco Press|accessdate= 24 July 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160805165703/http://en.mercopress.com/2014/10/25/cristina-fernandez-challenged-to-show-her-law-degree-and-timerman-described-as-a-traitor|archivedate= 5 August 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref> She registered at the Tribunal Superior de Justicia of Santa Cruz in 1980, the Comodoro Rivadavia's chamber of appeals in 1985 and worked as an attorney for the Justicialist Party in 1983.

When Néstor Kirchner refused to run for re-election in 2007 and proposed his wife instead, it was rumored that they could alternate in the presidency for the next 12 years to circumvent the constitutional limit of two consecutive terms. This scenario would have had Cristina standing down in favor of Néstor in 2011, and Néstor would in turn hand the [[Front for Victory|FPV]] candidacy back to Cristina in 2015.

==Presidency (2007–2015)==
{{main|Presidency of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner}}

=== Economic policy ===
[[File:CFK y AK.jpg|thumb|Fernández de Kirchner with minister of economy [[Axel Kicillof]]]]
When she first took office, Cristina Kirchner replaced the previous minister of economy, [[Miguel Gustavo Peirano]], who had been appointed by her husband as former president. Peirano was succeeded by [[Martín Lousteau]] in December 2007. He served as the first of several ministers of economy under her presidency. The attempt to increase taxes on agricultural exports caused a [[#Conflict with the agricultural sector|conflict]] with the agricultural sector and [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector|protests broke out]]. As a result, taxes were not increased, and Lousteau resigned by April 2008, only a few months after he had been appointed.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7366492.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Business {{!}} Argentina's economy chief quits|date=25 April 2008|work=BBC News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230012649/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7366492.stm|archivedate=30 December 2008}}</ref> He was replaced by Argentina's tax agency chief [[Carlos Rafael Fernández]].<ref name=":0" />

As an alternative to increasing taxes, and facing debt payments the following year, the government nationalized private [[pension fund]]s, known as "''Las Administradoras de Fondos de Jubilaciones y Pensiones''" (AFJP). The amount of money involved in this operation was nearly 30 billion dollars, and debt obligations were nearly 24 billion dollars.<ref name="afjp" /> The nationalization was justified by the president as government protectionism during the crisis, and compared with the bank bailouts in Europe and the United States. It was criticized as a threat to property rights and the rule of law.<ref name="afjp">{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/business/worldbusiness/22argentina.html|title= Argentina Nationalizes $30 Billion in Private Pensions|author= Alexei Barrionuevo|date= 21 October 2008|work= The New York Times|accessdate= 19 September 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161231062321/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/business/worldbusiness/22argentina.html?_r=0|archivedate= 31 December 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref> 

Fernández resigned after the Kirchnerite defeat in the 2009 elections, and was replaced by [[Amado Boudou]], president of the [[ANSES]] which had worked for that nationalization. Although inflation was nearing 25% and on the rise, Boudou did not consider it a significant problem.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/28/amado-boudou-argentina|title= Amado Boudou set to be Argentina's first rock'n'roll vice-president|author= Uki Goni|date= 28 August 2011|newspaper= The Guardian|accessdate= 20 September 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160928010432/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/28/amado-boudou-argentina|archivedate= 28 September 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

In January 2010, Cristina Kirchner created the [[bicentennial fund]] employing a [[necessity and urgency decree]] in order to pay debt obligations with [[foreign-exchange reserves]]. [[Martín Redrado]], president of the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]], refused to implement it, and was fired by another decree.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126289800502920289|title= Kirchner Fires Central Banker, Steering Into Crisis|author= Matt Moffett|date= 8 January 2010|newspaper= The Wall Street Journal|accessdate= 20 September 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160927032543/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126289800502920289|archivedate= 27 September 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Judge [[María José Sarmiento]] annulled both decrees on the grounds that the Central Bank was independent.

In 2002, Eduardo Duhalde [[Fixed price|fixed]] the prices for public services such as electricity, gas and water supply.

=== Conflict with the agricultural sector ===
{{main|2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector}}
[[File:Road blockade by agricultural producers in Argentina.jpg|thumb|left|Road blockade during the [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector]] in Villa María, Córdoba]]
In March 2008, Kirchner introduced a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports, so that rates fluctuated with international prices. This would effectively raise levies on [[soybean]] exports from 35% to 44% at the time of the announcement. This new taxation scheme, proposed by Minister [[Martín Lousteau]], led to a nationwide [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector|lockout by farming associations]], with the aim of forcing the government to back down on new tax system. They were joined on 25 March by thousands of [[Cacerolazo|pot-banging demonstrators]] massed around the [[Obelisco de Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires Obelisk]] and the [[Casa Rosada|presidential palace]]. These demonstrations were followed by others at locations across the country that included road [[blockade]]s and food shortages.<ref name="battle">{{cite news|url= http://www.irishtimes.com/news/argentine-farmers-take-tax-battle-to-parliament-1.941906|title= Argentine farmers take tax battle to parliament|author= Andrew Willis|date= 1 July 2008|newspaper= The Irish Times|accessdate= 23 September 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161005155655/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/argentine-farmers-take-tax-battle-to-parliament-1.941906|archivedate= 5 October 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

The protests were highly polarizing. The government argued that the new taxes would allow for a better [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistribution of wealth]], and keep down the food prices. It also claimed the farmers were staging a [[coup d'état]] against Kirchner.<ref name="block"/> Farmers argued that the high taxes made cultivation unviable.<ref name="battle"/> The activist [[Luis D'Elía]] interrupted one of the demonstrations leading stick-wielding pro-government supporters, who attacked the participants.<ref name="battle"/> Minister Lousteau resigned during the crisis, and the Peronist governors opted to negotiate on their own with the farmers, ignoring Kirchner's approach. Her public image plummeted to its lowest level since the election in October 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/25/argentina|title= Argentina turns against new president as strike worsens|author= Oliver Balch|date= 25 May 2008|newspaper= The Guardian|accessdate= 23 September 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161231062034/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/25/argentina|archivedate= 31 December 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref> 
 
After four months of conflict and having the majority in both houses of the [[Argentine Congress]], the president introduced the new taxation bill. However, many legislators gave priority to the local agendas of their provinces as their economies depended heavily on agriculture. Many FPV legislators, such as [[Rubén Marín]], opposed the bill. Marín argued: "For us, agriculture is the economy".<ref name="block">{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/world/americas/18argentina.html|title= Argentina Blocks Farm Export Tax|author= Alexei Barrionuevo|date= 18 July 2008|work= The New York Times|accessdate= 23 September 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180219031324/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/world/americas/18argentina.html?_r=0|archivedate= 19 February 2018|df= dmy-all}}</ref> There were two demonstrations the day of the vote: one against the bill, attended by 235,000 people, and the other in support of the bill, attended by 100,000 people.<ref name="block"/> Farmers had announced that they would continue their demonstrations if the bill was approved without amendments.<ref name="battle"/> Senator [[Emilio Rached]] from Santiago del Estero cast the vote that resulted in a 36–36 tie.

=== Other protests ===
[[File:Cacerolazo en Avenida Santa Fe y Callao (Jueves 19 de Septiembre) 2.jpg|thumb|200,000 people took part in a ''[[September 2012 cacerolazo in Argentina|cacerolazo]]'' against Kirchner]]
Kirchner was reelected in 2011. The Constitution of Argentina allows only one reelection. Many of her supporters proposed an amendment to the Constitution to allow indefinite reelections. Kirchner did not publicly support the proposal, but did not discourage or reject it either. The proposal was not taken to the Congress, as the FPV still lacked the required [[Supermajority|two-thirds majority]] to approve an amendment bill. It was rejected by many sectors of society. The first big demonstration (a ''[[cacerolazo]]'') took place in [[September 2012 cacerolazo in Argentina|September 2012]]. It was not called by specific politicians or social leaders, but by the public using [[social network]]s. The massive turnout was completely unexpected by both the government and the opposition.<ref name="Thousands"/> People also protested the [[2012 Buenos Aires rail disaster]], the [[conflict between Kirchnerism and the media]], rising crime rates, and the tight [[Argentine currency controls (2011–15)|currency controls]].

Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said the demonstrators belonged to a class that was against social justice, and compared the demonstrations to a [[coup d'état]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/06/fernandez-de-kirchner-reforms-protest|title= Fernández de Kirchner reforms spark Argentina protests|author= Uki Goñi|date= 6 September 2012|newspaper= The Guardian|accessdate= 27 September 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161231062306/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/06/fernandez-de-kirchner-reforms-protest|archivedate= 31 December 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref> A similar view was held by Kirchner's loyalists.<ref name="protests"/>

Prosecutor [[Alberto Nisman]], who worked on the investigation of the 1994 Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (Argentine- Israeli Mutual Association) [[AMIA bombing]], accused Kirchner of engaging in a criminal, cover-up conspiracy to cover up the attack.

The TV program ''[[Periodismo para todos]]'' broadcast information about ''[[The Route of the K-Money]]'' scandal. Businessman [[Leonardo Fariña]] said in an interview that he helped businessman [[Lázaro Báez]] to divert money from public works, and take it to a financial firm located in the [[Madero Center]] luxury hotel. This firm, informally known as "La Rosadita", would have sent the money abroad to tax havens, using shell companies. Given the amounts of money involved, the money was weighed instead of counted to determine the value. Federico Elaskar, owner of the firm, confirmed Fariña's claims in another interview. Both of them retracted their statements after the program was aired, but prosecutor [[José María Campagnoli]] confirmed their links with Báez. Báez denied any wrongdoing.

The Kirchner government launched a campaign against Clarín Group, which included over 450 legal and administrative acts of harassment, as reported by the [[Global Editors Network]]. One of those actions was a selective use of state advertising, to benefit the media aligned with the government.<ref name=gen/> The government tried to enforce a controversial media law that would see Clarín Group lose licenses and be forced to sell most of its assets. The law was initially sanctioned as a [[competition law]] for the media, but critics pointed out that it was only being used to further the campaign against Clarín Group.<ref name=gen/> The government had little interest in enforcing measures of the law that were not related to Clarín Group.<ref name=stumbles>{{cite news|url=http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/kirchner-on-the-offensive-against-media-giant/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0|title=Kirchner Stumbles Again|first=Daniel|last=Politi|date=14 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=1 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006175214/http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/kirchner-on-the-offensive-against-media-giant/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0|archivedate=6 October 2014}}</ref> Clarín Group launched a constitutional challenge against some articles of the law with the judiciary.

=== Midterm elections ===
[[File:Discurso post electoral de CFK.jpg|thumb|President Kirchner after the defeat at the [[2009 Argentine legislative election|2009 midterm elections]]]]
The [[2009 Argentine legislative election|2009 midterm elections]] took place a year after the crisis with the farmers. The Kirchners were highly unpopular at the time, and people rejected their policies and governing style. The growing rates of inflation and crime also eroded their public support. Seeking to reverse their declining popularity, Néstor Kirchner led the list for deputy candidates at the Buenos Aires province. He was narrowly defeated by [[Francisco de Narváez]], who led a Peronist faction opposed to the Kirchners. The Kirchners lost the majority of Congress as a result of the election.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/29/argentina-cristina-nestor-kirchner|title= Argentina's Kirchners lose political ground in mid-term elections|author= Rory Carroll|date= 30 June 2009|newspaper= The Guardian|accessdate= 12 October 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817064852/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/29/argentina-cristina-nestor-kirchner|archivedate= 17 August 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

The Front for Victory recovered the majority in both chambers of the Congress during the 2011 presidential elections, when Cristina Kirchner was re-elected for a second term. The party had projects to amend the constitution and allow indefinite reelections, but lacked the supermajority required for it. A victory at the [[2013 Argentine legislative election|2013 midterm elections]] would have given such majority, but the party was defeated in most provinces. [[Sergio Massa]], a former cabinet minister of the Kirchners, won in the Buenos Aires Province by nearly 10 points with his new party, the [[Renewal Front]]. Argentina lacked a big opposition party since the collapse of the [[Radical Civic Union]] in 2001. Instead, Massa created an alternative party that also stood for Peronism.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324328204578576053901784268|title=Argentine President Stumps for Congressional Candidates|first=Ben|last=Parks|date=29 June 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=19 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225142014/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324328204578576053901784268|archivedate=25 December 2015}}</ref> However, the party still retained a simple majority in Congress. This election was the first one where teenagers from 16 to 18 could vote.

Several items from a US Air Force plane, such as drugs and GPS devices, were seized by Argentine officials, which caused a [[2011 Argentina–United States diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis]].

Argentina suffered a terrorist attack in 1994, the AMIA bombing targeting a Buenos Aires Jewish center, that killed 85 people and wounded 300. The investigation remained open for years, and prosecutor [[Alberto Nisman]] was appointed to the case. He accused Iran of organizing the attack, and the [[Hezbollah]] group of carrying it out. He intended to prosecute five Iranian officials, including former Iranian president [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]], but Argentina signed a [[Memorandum of understanding between Argentina and Iran|memorandum of understanding]] with Iran for a joint investigation. Nisman accused the president of signing that memorandum for oil and trade benefits, according to hundreds of hours of wiretaps. On 19 January 2015, he was [[Death of Alberto Nisman|found dead]] at his home, a day before a congressional hearing to explain his accusation, which caused a great controversy.

=== Legal charges ===
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner faced several charges in court after leaving office. One of those concerned the sale of [[currency future|dollar futures]] at very low prices near the end of her term of office. This became a problem during Macri's presidency. The operation was carried out by the Central Bank, but judge [[Claudio Bonadio]] believes Fernández de Kirchner is the instigator. She is also being investigated for her role in "The Route of the K-Money" scandal. About US$1 million of her assets was frozen while Bonadio investigated the case. She took advantage of the hearing to organize her first political rally since leaving power.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/14/former-argentinian-president-cristina-kirchner-indicted-over-cur/|title= Former Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner indicted over currency trade that lost billions|date= 14 May 2016|newspaper= The Telegraph|accessdate= 14 October 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161018212714/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/14/former-argentinian-president-cristina-kirchner-indicted-over-cur/|archivedate= 18 October 2016|df= dmy-all|last1= Staff|first1= Our Foreign}}</ref> Lázaro Báez who has close ties with the Kirchners was detained in April 2016 as it was suspected that he might flee escape.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://en.mercopress.com/2016/04/06/kirchnerite-businessman-arrested-faces-charges-of-money-laundering-and-fiscal-fraud|title= Kirchnerite businessman arrested; faces charges of money laundering and fiscal fraud|date= 6 April 2016|publisher= Merco Press|accessdate= 14 October 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161018211133/http://en.mercopress.com/2016/04/06/kirchnerite-businessman-arrested-faces-charges-of-money-laundering-and-fiscal-fraud|archivedate= 18 October 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref> José López, an official from the ministry of public works, was [[José López scandal|detained]] while trying to hide bags filled with millions in cash at a monastery.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36535048|title= Argentina ex-minister arrested over cash bags at monastery|date= 15 June 2016|publisher= BBC|accessdate= 14 October 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161019051447/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36535048|archivedate= 19 October 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref> On 27 December 2016, Federal Judge [[Julián Ercolini]] ordered the freezing of US$633 million of Fernández de Kirchner's assets and approved charges of illicit association and fraudulent administration against her.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Argentina ex-leader Cristina Fernandez charged in corruption case |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-38443546 |newspaper=BBC News |location=London |date=27 December 2016 |access-date=27 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227174827/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-38443546 |archivedate=27 December 2016  }}</ref> The case presented by Nisman was finally opened for investigation in December 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/argentina-reopens-probe-of-kirchner-related-to-1994-bombing-1483053411|title= Argentina Reopens Probe of Kirchner Related to 1994 Bombing|author= Ryan Dube|date= 29 December 2016|newspaper= The Wall Street Journal|accessdate= 31 December 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161230224304/http://www.wsj.com/articles/argentina-reopens-probe-of-kirchner-related-to-1994-bombing-1483053411|archivedate= 30 December 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Politics ===
[[File:CFK - tratamiento de la ley de emergencia tarifaria.jpg|thumb|Senator Cristina Fernández de Kirchner giving a speech in the Senate.]]
Both Fernández de Kirchner and her former interior minister [[Florencio Randazzo]] wanted to run for senator for the Buenos Aires Province at the [[2017 Argentine legislative election|2017 midterm elections]]. Refusing to run in [[Primary elections in Argentina|primary elections]], she asked for a shared ticket as a condition to run for senator. Randazzo did not accept the proposal. The FPV was renamed the [[Citizen's Unity Party]] at the province and registered as a coalition of minor parties only, leaving the PJ out of it.

===Health===
Kirchner's health first became a topic of public concern in 2005 when ''[[Noticias (magazine)|Noticias]]'' magazine reported that she might suffer from [[bipolar disorder]]. Journalist Franco Lindner interviewed the psychiatrist who treated her without revealing his name. Journalist [[Nelson Castro (journalist)|Nelson Castro]] investigated further and discovered that the psychiatrist was Alejandro Lagomarsino, who died in 2011.<ref>Castro, p. 25</ref> Lagomarsino was the leading specialist in the treatment of bipolar disorder in Argentina.<ref>Castro, p. 48</ref>

Castro's investigation revealed that Kirchner was treated by Lagomarsino for a short period. He could not determine the length of her treatment or the medicine she received, or whether another psychiatrist continued treating her or not.<ref>Castro, p. 29</ref> Castro considers that some of her outlandish phrases or projects, and her frequent periods of hiding from public view, may be explained by the disorder's periods of mania and depression, as well as being a regular political strategy.<ref>Castro, pp. 30–36</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://en.mercopress.com/2011/05/10/president-cristina-kirchner-expected-to-resume-activities-tuesday|title= President Cristina Kirchner expected to resume activities Tuesday|date= 10 May 2011|publisher= Merco Press|accessdate= 17 October 2016|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161018203731/http://en.mercopress.com/2011/05/10/president-cristina-kirchner-expected-to-resume-activities-tuesday|archivedate= 18 October 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref> [[Eduardo Duhalde]] said that Néstor Kirchner once confided in him that she had a bipolar disorder, while she was having a violent outburst.<ref>Castro, p. 40</ref>

On 27 December 2011, presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimaro announced that Kirchner had been diagnosed with [[thyroid cancer]] on 22 December and that she would undergo surgery on 4 January 2012. The standard procedure in these operations is to expose the [[thyroid]] gland so that a pathologist can take a sample, analyze it looking for carcinogenic cells, and then decide whether it needs to be removed. In Kirchner's case, this step was omitted and the gland was removed directly.<ref>Castro, p. 61</ref> After the operation, it was revealed that she had been misdiagnosed and did not have cancer.<ref>{{cite news|title=Argentina's Fernandez sent home, never had cancer |first1=Hugh |last1=Bronstein |first2=Maximiliano |last2=Rizzi |work=Reuters |date=7 January 2012 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/07/us-argentina-fernandez-idustre8060CB20120107 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6D6PaIwo4?url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/07/us-argentina-fernandez-idUSTRE8060CB20120107 |archivedate=22 December 2012 |url-status=live |accessdate=22 December 2012  }}</ref> On 5 October 2013, doctors ordered Kirchner to rest for a month after they found blood on her brain caused by a head injury she received on 8 August 2012.<ref name="Blood on brain, rest ordered for Argentine leader"/> She was re-admitted to hospital and had successful surgery on 8 October 2013 to remove blood from [[Subdural hematoma|under a membrane covering her brain]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Cristina Fernández de Kirchner to have surgery following head injury|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/07/cristina-fernndez-de-kirchner-re-admitted-hospital|date=7 October 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=26 September 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725184116/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/07/cristina-fernndez-de-kirchner-re-admitted-hospital|archivedate=25 July 2016}}</ref>
