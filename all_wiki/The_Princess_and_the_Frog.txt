'''''The Princess and the Frog''''' is a 2009 American [[animation|animated]] [[musical film|musical]] [[fantasy film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. The 49th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the film is loosely based on the novel ''[[The Frog Princess (novel)|The Frog Princess]]'' by [[E. D. Baker]], which is in turn based on the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tale "[[The Frog Prince]]". Written and directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], the film stars [[Anika Noni Rose]], [[Bruno Campos]], [[Michael-Leon Wooley]], [[Jim Cummings]], [[Jennifer Cody]], [[John Goodman]], [[Keith David]], [[Peter Bartlett (actor)|Peter Bartlett]], [[Jenifer Lewis]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], and [[Terrence Howard]]. Set in the 1920s [[New Orleans]], the film tells the story of a hardworking waitress named [[Tiana (Disney)|Tiana]] who dreams of opening her own restaurant. After kissing a prince who has been turned into a frog by an evil voodoo sorcerer, Tiana becomes a frog herself and must find a way to turn back into a human before it is too late.

''The Princess and the Frog'' began production under the working title ''The Frog Princess''. It marked Disney's brief return to [[traditional animation]], as it was the mainstream animation studio's first traditionally animated film since ''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]'' (2004). Clements and Musker, directors of Disney's highly successful films ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989), ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), and ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'' (1997) returned to Disney to direct ''The Princess and the Frog''. The studio returned to a [[Broadway musical]]-style format frequently used during the [[Disney Renaissance]] and features music written by composer [[Randy Newman]], well known for his musical involvement in [[Pixar]] films such as the ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' franchise.

''The Princess and the Frog'' opened in [[limited release]] in New York and Los Angeles on November 25, 2009, and in wide release on December 11, 2009. The film received largely positive reviews from critics and audiences, praising the animation (particularly the revival of the medium), characters, music, and themes, and was also successful at the box office, ranking first place on its opening weekend in North America, and grossing around $270 million worldwide becoming Disney’s most successful traditionally animated film since ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'' in 2002. It received three [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations at the [[82nd Academy Awards]]: one for Best Animated Feature and two for its achievement in music (Original Song). It lost to ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[Crazy Heart]]'', respectively.<ref name="OscarWins">{{cite web|title="The Hurt Locker" Takes Top Honors at 82nd Academy Awards|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/the-hurt-locker-takes-top-honors-at-82nd-academy-awards-166552|work=playbill.com|publisher=Playbill|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}</ref>

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. Please do not include the subplot of Ray and Evangeline, as it is not necessary. -->
In 1912 [[New Orleans]], a girl named [[Tiana (Disney)|Tiana]] and her friend Charlotte La Bouff listen to Tiana's mother read the story of ''[[The Frog Prince]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lacey|first=Liam|date=December 10, 2009|title=The Princess and the Frog|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/the-princess-and-the-frog/article4188489/|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=November 1, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620230320/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/the-princess-and-the-frog/article4188489/|archivedate=June 20, 2018}}</ref> Charlotte, a believer in true love, finds the story romantic; Tiana declares she will never kiss a frog. 

In 1928, Tiana grew into an aspiring young chef who works as a waitress for two local diners, so she can save enough money to start her own restaurant, a dream she shared with her father, who is implied to have died in [[World War I]]. 

Prince Naveen of Maldonia arrives in New Orleans to better his financial situation. After being cut off by his parents for being a philanderer and spendthrift, Naveen intends to marry a rich [[Southern belle]], and Charlotte is the perfect candidate. Eli "Big Daddy" La Bouff, a rich sugar baron and Charlotte's father, hosts a masquerade ball in Naveen's honor. Charlotte hires Tiana to make [[beignet]]s for the ball, giving her enough money to buy an old sugar mill to convert into her restaurant. Meanwhile, Naveen and his valet, Lawrence, meet a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] [[witch doctor]], Dr. Facilier. Inviting them into his emporium, Facilier convinces them that he can make their dreams come true. Still, neither gets what he expects: Naveen is transformed into a frog while Lawrence receives a voodoo talisman that gives him Naveen's appearance. Facilier intends for the transformed Lawrence to marry Charlotte, after which he will kill La Bouff and split his fortune with Lawrence, secretly giving himself the larger sum.

At the ball, Tiana discovers she may lose the mill to a higher bidder. She then meets Naveen, who, believing her to be a princess because of her costume, asks her to kiss him and break Facilier's spell. In exchange for the money needed, Tiana reluctantly accepts. Still, since she is not an actual princess, she is turned into a frog herself when she kisses Naveen, which also gives her the ability to talk to other animals. A chase ensues, and Tiana and Naveen escape to a [[bayou]]. In the bayou, Tiana and Naveen meet a trumpet-playing alligator, Louis, who dreams of playing in a band with humans, but whose ferocious appearance prevents him from doing so. They also meet a [[Cajun]] firefly, Ray. Ray believes that the [[Venus|Evening Star]] is another firefly named "[[Evangeline]]," and is deeply in love with her; no one has the heart to tell him otherwise. Louis and Ray offer to lead Tiana and Naveen to a [[Louisiana Voodoo#Voodoo queens|voodoo queen]], Mama Odie, who they believe can undo the curse. During the journey, Tiana and Naveen develop feelings for each other. Meanwhile, Facilier makes a deal with the voodoo spirits (his "friends on the other side"), offering them the souls of the people of New Orleans; in exchange, the spirits grant Facilier the services of a host of shadow demons, whom he orders to find and capture Naveen.

When the four find Mama Odie after escaping from several of the demons and a trio of bumbling frog hunters, she tells them that Naveen must kiss a true princess to break the spell. They return to New Orleans to find Charlotte, the princess of the [[Mardi Gras]] Parade, but only until midnight. Naveen tells Ray he loves Tiana and is willing to give up his dreams for her, but before he can, he is captured by the demons and brought to Facilier. After Ray tells Tiana that Naveen loves her, Tiana goes to the parade to confess her love for Naveen, only to find Lawrence, still masquerading as Naveen, marrying Charlotte. Tiana flees, heartbroken. Ray rescues the real Naveen and steals the charm that disguises Lawrence, finds Tiana, and gives her the charm, explaining the deception. He then turns to hold off the demons so she can escape but is mortally wounded by Facilier in the process. Facilier then offers to make Tiana's restaurant dream come true in exchange for the talisman. Realizing she would rather be with Naveen and recognizing Facilier's true intentions, Tiana destroys the tailsman by smashing it on the ground. With Facilier's plan foiled, Tiana watches the angered voodoo spirits drag Facilier and his shadow into the voodoo spirit world for his debts to them, with his frightened expression placed on a tombstone.

As Lawrence is taken away by the police, Naveen explains everything to Charlotte; Tiana and Naveen reveal their love to each other. Charlotte agrees to kiss Naveen so he and Tiana can be together as people, but the clock strikes midnight, and the kiss fails to work. The couple decides they are content to live together as frogs. Ray dies shortly after, and during his funeral, a new star appears next to Evangeline.

Tiana and Naveen are married by Mama Odie and, because of Tiana's new status as a princess, are both restored to human form after their kiss. Later they return to New Orleans to legally marry and celebrate and open their new restaurant, with Louis playing in the band.

==Cast and characters==
* [[Anika Noni Rose]] as [[Tiana (Disney)|Tiana]], an [[African Americans|African-American]] 19-year-old waitress and aspiring chef/restaurateur. She is a smart, hard-working, and independent young woman, but one who works so hard that she often forgets important things such as love, fun, and family.<ref>{{cite news|work=Washington Post|title=A Fairy Tale Beginning: Snow White, She's Not.

[[Mark Henn]] served as the supervising animator for Tiana in both human and frog form, making her one of several Disney lead female characters he has animated.<ref>{{cite web|last=Noyer |first=Jérémie |title=Down in New Orleans with Princess Tiana's supervising animator, Mark Henn |publisher=DLRP Magic! |date=January 30, 2010 |url=http://www.dlrpmagic.com/interviews/down-in-new-orleans-with-princess-tianas-supervising-animator-mark-henn/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120728112659/http://www.dlrpmagic.com/interviews/down-in-new-orleans-with-princess-tianas-supervising-animator-mark-henn/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 28, 2012 |accessdate=May 6, 2010 }}</ref> Henn declared that he attempted to make a character that could stand on its own "without repeating what I've done on [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]], [[Ariel (Disney character)|Ariel]], and [[Princess Jasmine|Jasmine]]", with Tiana having a more cynical and grounded personality. Rose's performance influenced much of the animation, with the actress even suggesting to Henn for Tiana to be left-handed like herself.<ref name=magic/>

==Production==

===Early development===
Disney had once announced that 2004's ''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]'' would be their last traditionally animated film. After the company's acquisition of [[Pixar]] in 2006, [[Edwin Catmull|Ed Catmull]] and [[John Lasseter]], the new president and chief creative officer of Disney Animation Studios, reversed this decision and reinstated hand-drawn animation at the studio.<ref name="darkhorizons">{{cite web|date=July 27, 2006|work=Dark Horizons|accessdate=July 29, 2006|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/060727d.php|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121216055154/http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/060727d.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 16, 2012|title=Disney Goes Traditional For "Princess"}}</ref><ref name="Kurtti2009p8">{{Harvp|Kurtti|2009|p=8}}.</ref> Many animators who had either been laid off or had left the studio when the traditional animation units were dissolved in 2003 were located and re-hired for the project.<ref name="Ind0118">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/leap-of-faith-the-princess-and-the-frog-1870801.html|title=Leap of faith: The Princess and the Frog|work=The Independent|date=January 18, 2010|accessdate=January 26, 2010|location=London}}</ref> Lasseter also brought back directors [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], whose earlier works include ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'' (1986), ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989), ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'' (1997), and ''[[Treasure Planet]]'' (2002).<ref name="laughingplace.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/News-ID510530.asp|title=Rhett Wickham: It's Baaack!|work=LaughingPlace.com|date=June 23, 2006|accessdate=June 23, 2006}}</ref><ref name="awn">{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/comic-con-sees-stars-2d-officially-back-disney|title=Comic-Con Sees Stars, 2D Officially Back at Disney|work=AWN Headline News|date=July 23, 2006|accessdate=July 29, 2006}}</ref> The duo had left the company in 2005, but Lasseter requested their return to Disney to direct and write the film and had let them choose the style of animation (traditional or CGI) they wanted to use.<ref name="commentary" />

The story for the film began development by merging two projects in development at Disney and Pixar at the time, both based around "[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]" fairy tale.<ref name="commentary" /><ref name="Ind0118"/> One of the projects was based on [[E. D. Baker]]'s ''[[The Frog Princess (novel)|The Frog Princess]]'', in which the story's heroine (Princess Emma) kisses a prince turned frog (Prince Eadric), only to become a frog herself.<ref name="Ind0118"/> ''The Princess and the Frog'' returns to the [[musical film]] format used in many of the previously successful Disney animated films, with a style Musker and Clements declared, like with ''Aladdin'' and ''The Little Mermaid'', had inspiration from [[Golden age of American animation|Golden Age]] Disney features such as ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''.<ref name="magic" />

Musker and Clements thought that given all fairy tales were set in Europe, they could do an American fairy tale.<ref name="magic" /> They stated that they chose New Orleans as a tribute to the history of the city, for its "magical" qualities, and because it was Lasseter's favorite city.<ref name="commentary" /><ref name="LATimes">{{cite news|last=King|first=Susan|title=Q & A with 'Princess and the Frog' animators|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/22/entertainment/la-ca-princess22-2009nov22|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 17, 2010|date=November 22, 2009}}</ref> The directors spent ten days in Louisiana before starting to write the film.<ref name="magic" />

''The Princess and the Frog'' was originally announced as ''The Frog Princess'' in July 2006,<ref name="darkhorizons" /> and early concepts and songs were presented to the public at [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s annual shareholders' meeting in March 2007.<ref name="disneyshareholdermeeting07" /> These announcements drew criticism from African-American media outlets, due to elements of the ''Frog Princess'' story, characters, and settings considered distasteful.<ref name="essence" /><ref name="time" /> African-American critics disapproved of the original name for the heroine, "Maddy", due to its similarity to the derogatory term "[[Mammy archetype|mammy]]".<ref name="essence">{{cite web|last=Misick|first=Bobbi|title=Controversy Over ''The Princess and the Frog''|url=http://www.essence.com/2009/11/30/critics-dispute-princess-and-the-frog/|work=Essence.com|accessdate=May 17, 2010|date=Nov 30, 2009}}</ref> Also protested were Maddy's original career as a chambermaid,<ref name="time">{{cite news|last=Stephey|first=M.&nbsp;J.|title=Top 10 Disney Controversies|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1946727_1946724,00.html|work=Time|date=December 9, 2009}}</ref> the choice to have the black heroine's love interest be a non-black prince,<ref name="essence" /> and the use of a black male voodoo witchdoctor as the film's villain.<ref name="essence" /> The ''Frog Princess'' title was also thought by critics to be a slur on [[French people]].<ref name="namechange" /> Also questioned was the film's setting of New Orleans, which had been heavily damaged by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, resulting in the expulsion of a large number of mostly black residents.<ref name="ohio" /> Critics claimed the choice of New Orleans as the setting for a Disney film with a black heroine was an affront to the Katrina victims' plight.<ref name="essence" /><ref name="ohio">{{cite news|last=Heldenfels|first=Rich|title='Princess' leaps to DVD|url=http://www.ohio.com/entertainment/87609637.html|newspaper=Akron Beacon Journal|date=March 14, 2010}}</ref>

In response to these early criticisms, the film's title was changed in May 2007 from ''The Frog Princess'' to ''The Princess and the Frog''.

===Writing and themes===
The head of story, [[Don Hall (filmmaker)|Don Hall]], described the plot as a fairy tale "twisted enough that it seems new and fresh", with a kingdom that is a modern city, a handsome prince that is a "knuckleheaded playboy" and a variation on the [[fairy godmother]] with Mama Odie. Co-writer Rob Edwards also said ''The Princess and the Frog'' was "a princess movie for people who don't like princess movies". As the writers thought Tiana's character motivation of simply dreaming of having her own restaurant was not appealing enough, they expanded so it was her father's as well, with the extra philosophy of "food bringing people together from all walks of life". Musker and Clements stated that while Tiana already starts as a sympathetic character, the events of the plot make her "understand things in a deeper level" and change people around her. Both protagonists would learn from each other—Naveen to take responsibilities, Tiana to enjoy life—as well as figuring from Ray's passion for Evangeline that the perfect balance is brought by having someone you love to share the experience.<ref name=magic>"Magic in the Bayou", ''The Princess and the Frog'' Blu-ray.

In February 2007, it was reported that ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'' actresses [[Jennifer Hudson]] and [[Anika Noni Rose]] were top contenders for the voice of Tiana, and that [[Alicia Keys]] directly contacted Walt Disney Studios chairman [[Dick Cook]] about voicing the role.<ref>{{cite web|date=February 5, 2007|work=E!

===Animation and design===
Clements and Musker had agreed early on that the style they were aiming for was primarily that of ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), a film which they and John Lasseter feel represents "the pinnacle of Disney's style".<ref name="Gilchrest">{{cite web|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2009/10/23/interview-princess-and-the-frog-directors-ron-clements-and-jo/|title=Interview: 'Princess and the Frog' Directors Ron Clements and John Musker|author=Todd Gilchrist|publisher=Cinematical.com|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate=October 30, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054004/http://news.moviefone.com/2009/10/23/interview-princess-and-the-frog-directors-ron-clements-and-jo/|archive-date=September 21, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> "After that, everything started becoming more stylized, like ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]''—which are fantastic films as well, but there's a particular style (to ''Lady and the Tramp'') that's so classically Disney."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/movies/index.ssf/2009/12/post_41.html|title=For 'Princess and the Frog,' Disney animators go back to the drawing board|date=December 12, 2009}}</ref> ''Lady and the Tramp'' also heavily informed the style of the New Orleans scenes, while Disney's ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942) served as the template for the bayou scenes.<ref name="Gilchrest" /> ''Bambi'' was described as a stylistic reference for the painted backgrounds, as according to art director Ian Gooding "''Bambi'' painted what it feels like to be in the forest instead of the forest" so ''The Princess and the Frog'' would in turn try capturing the essence of roaming through New Orleans.<ref name="magic" />

The former trend in Disney's hand-drawn features where the characters and cinematography were influenced by a CGI-look had been abandoned. [[Andreas Deja]], a veteran Disney animator who supervised the character of Mama Odie, says "I always thought that maybe we should distinguish ourselves to go back to what 2D is good at, which is focusing on what the line can do rather than volume, which is a CG kind of thing. So we are doing less extravagant ''[[Treasure Planet]]'' kind of treatments. You have to create a world but [we're doing it more simply]. What we're trying to do with ''Princess and the Frog'' is hook up with things that the old guys did earlier. It's not going to be graphic…".<ref name="Insights From ADAPT 2008"/> Deja also mentions that Lasseter was aiming for the Disney sculptural and dimensional look of the 1950s: "All those things that were non-graphic, which means go easy on the straight lines and have one volume flow into the other—an organic feel to the drawing."<ref name="Insights From ADAPT 2008"/> Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability.<ref name=mwlasseter>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/john-lasseter-returns-to-hand-drawn-animation-with-the-princess-and-the-frog|title=John Lasseter Returns to Hand Drawn Animation with ''The Princess and the Frog''|work=[[MovieWeb]]|author=Orange, B. Alan|date=March 13, 2010|accessdate=January 8, 2011}}</ref> For example, with Louis the alligator, created by [[Eric Goldberg (film director)|Eric Goldberg]], Lasseter said: "It's the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that."<ref name=mwlasseter /> Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement. The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes, particularly for most characters being human. For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen, while the animators started with realistic designs, they eventually went for cutesy characters "removing all that is unappealing in frogs", similar to ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''{{'}}s [[Jiminy Cricket]].<ref name=magic/>

[[Toon Boom Animation]]'s Toon Boom Harmony software was used as the main software package for the production of the film, as the [[Computer Animation Production System]] (CAPS) system that Disney developed with [[Pixar]] in the 1980s for use on their previous traditionally animated films had become outdated.<ref name="laughingplace">{{cite web|last=Wickham|first=Rhett|date=June 23, 2006|title=It's Baaack!|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/News-ID510530.asp|work=LaughingPlace.com|accessdate=August 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702030813/http://www.laughingplace.com/News-ID510530.asp|archivedate=July 2, 2006}}</ref> The Harmony software was augmented with a number of plug-ins to provide CAPS-like effects such as shading on cheeks and smoke effects.<ref name="tech">{{citation|last=Robertson|first=Barbara|title=The Tradition Lives On|journal=Computer Graphics World|volume=33|issue=1|url=http://www.cgw.com/Publications/CGW/2010/Volume-33-Issue-1-Jan-2010-/The-Tradition-Lives-On.aspx|date=January 26, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Insights From ADAPT 2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3787 |title=Insights From ADAPT 2008 |publisher=Animated World Network |date=October 8, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514172702/http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3787 |archivedate=May 14, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> The reinstated traditional unit's first production, a 2007 [[Goofy]] cartoon short entitled ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]]'', was partly animated without paper by using Harmony and [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]] [[Cintiq]] pressure-sensitive tablets.

===Music===
{{main|The Princess and the Frog (soundtrack)}}

Originally, [[Alan Menken]] was considered to be in charge of the soundtrack. However, Lasseter thought that since Menken scored the Disney film ''[[Enchanted (film)|Enchanted]]'' (2007), the music might be too repetitive, especially the fact that some previous Renaissance Disney animated films technically had other songwriters (particularly ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[Mulan]]'', and ''[[Tarzan]]''). Lasseter realized that Randy Newman, whom he had previously worked with, was the perfect choice for the film and replaced Menken with him, due to the fact that Newman is a jazz composer and grew up in New Orleans, making him compatible with the project´s musical setting that is based on. Newman had also written the songs for another broadway-style musical 2D animated feature, [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]'' (1997), and had written the songs for ''Toy Story'' (1995).

During Disney's 2007 shareholder meeting, [[Randy Newman]] and the [[Dirty Dozen Brass Band]] performed the film's opening number, "[[Down in New Orleans (song)|Down in New Orleans]]", with famous New Orleans singer [[Dr.&nbsp;John]] singing, while slides of pre-production art from the film played on a screen.<ref name="disneyshareholdermeeting07" /> Other songs in the film include "[[Almost There (The Princess and the Frog song)|Almost There]]" (a solo for Tiana), "Dig a Little Deeper" (a song for Mama Odie), "When We're Human" (a song for Louis, Tiana and Naveen [as frogs]), "[[Friends on the Other Side]]" (a solo for Doctor Facilier), and "Gonna Take You There" and "Ma Belle Evangeline" (two solos for Ray).<ref name="disneyshareholdermeeting07">{{cite web|date=March 8, 2007|work=Yahoo News|accessdate=March 9, 2007|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070308/ap_en_mo/film_new_orleans_2;_ylt=AlzYANL3i9hU29QXkk5J2urBaMYA|title=New Orleans the site of new Disney film}}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Newman composed, arranged, and conducted the music for the film, a mixture of jazz, [[zydeco]], blues, and gospel styles performed by the voice cast members for the respective characters while [[R&B]] singer-songwriter [[Ne-Yo]] wrote and performed the [[closing credits|end title]] song "[[Never Knew I Needed]]", an R&B love song referring to the romance between the film's two main characters, Tiana and Naveen.

==Reception==
===Box office===
On its limited day release, the film grossed $263,890 at two theaters and grossed $786,190 its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/daily/chart/?sortdate=2009-11-25&p=.htm|title=Daily Box Office for Wednesday, November 25, 2009|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=November 25, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2009&wknd=48&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for November 27–29, 2009|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=November 29, 2009}}</ref> On its opening day in wide release, the film grossed $7 million at 3,434 theaters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/daily/chart/?sortdate=2009-12-11&p=.htm|title=Daily Box Office for Friday, December 11, 2009|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}</ref> It went on to gross $24.2 million over the opening weekend averaging $7,050 per theater,<ref name="mojo2">{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2009&wknd=50&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for December 11–13, 2009|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=December 15, 2009}}</ref> ranking at #1 for the weekend, and making it the highest-grossing start to date for an animated movie in December, a record previously held by ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America]]''.<ref name="mojo3">{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2630&p=.htm|title=Weekend Report: 'Princess and the Frog' Leaps to the Top|website=Box Office Mojo|author=Gray, Brandon|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=December 15, 2009}}</ref> The film went on to gross $104.4 million (in the United States and Canada) and over $270 million (worldwide), making it a box office success, and became the fifth-highest-grossing animated film of 2009.<ref name="mojo" /> While the film out-grossed Disney's more recent hand-drawn films such as ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Treasure Planet]]'', ''[[Brother Bear]]'', and ''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]'', it was less auspicious than the animated films from [[Disney Renaissance|Walt Disney Animation Studios' 1990s heyday]], despite having a similar successful start compared to ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. Disney animator [[Tom Sito]] compared the film's box office performance to that of ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'' (1986), which was a step up from the theatrical run of the 1985 [[box office bomb]] ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/life/Disney-seeks-to-crown-revival-with-Frozen-Oscar-go-30227659.html|title=Disney seeks to crown revival with 'Frozen' Oscar gold|publisher=National Media|accessdate=June 22, 2014}}</ref> It can be considered that the film, despite having been a box office hit in general, was unexpectedly overshadowed by the release of ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' a week later after its release.

===Impact, aftermath, debates, and legacy===
While being technically a commercial and critical success in general, the company originally considered releasing at least one hand-drawn animated film every two years,<ref>{{cite web|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/wondercon-the-princess-and-the-frog-and-the-future-of-2d-aniamtion-at-disney/|title=WonderCon: The Princess and the Frog and The Future of 2D Animation at Disney|website=/Film|date=February 28, 2009|accessdate=September 11, 2019}}</ref> starting with ''[[Winnie the Pooh (2011 film)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' (2011), and an adaptation of "[[The Snow Queen]]", which was later switched to CGI (although in the same visual style of ''[[Tangled]]'' by blending elements of the two mediums) due to complex visual elements in the story and later re-titled as ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' released in 2013.

The blog website ''[[/Film]]'' noted in July 2014 with the release of hand-drawn concept art for ''Frozen'' (which it became highly successful by grossing over 1 billion dollars worldwide), that any future hand-drawn animated films have been "killed" for the time being due to ''The Princess and the Frog'' failing "to ignite the box office".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/frozen-concept-art/|title=Frozen Concept Art Shows What A Hand Drawn Movie Could've Looked Like|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|publisher=/Film|date=July 1, 2014|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}</ref> Two months later, however, many Disney artists announced they were working on a new independent hand-drawn animated film, ''Hullabaloo'', as part of an attempt to bring back hand-drawn animation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethemagic.net/2014/09/disney-animators-aim-to-revive-2d-hand-drawn-animation-with-hullabaloo-an-independent-animated-steampunk-film/|title=Disney animators aim to revive 2D hand-drawn animation with "Hullabaloo," an independent animated steampunk project|last=Brigante|first=Ricky|publisher=Inside the Magic|date=September 1, 2014|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}</ref> consisting in three short films, while others got later involved on making the Netflix animated film ''[[Klaus (film)|Klaus]]'', released in 2019.

Looking back on the experience four years later, Catmull acknowledged that Disney had made a "serious mistake" in the process of marketing and releasing the film.<ref name="Catmull">{{cite book|last1=Catmull|first1=Ed|author2=Amy Wallace|title=Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration|date=2014|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0812993011|page=[https://archive.org/details/creativityincove0000catm/page/268 268]|url=https://archive.org/details/creativityincove0000catm|url-access=registration}}</ref> [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]' marketing department had warned Disney Animation that the word "princess" in the title "would lead moviegoers to think that the film was for girls only," but the animation studio's management insisted on keeping the "princess" title because they believed that the film's quality and hand-drawn animation would [[Four-quadrant movie|bring in all quadrants]] anyway.<ref name="Catmull" /> In Catmull's words, this belief "was our own version of a stupid pill."<ref name="Catmull" /> The marketing department turned out to be correct in their prediction that many moviegoers would and did avoid the film because they thought it was "for little girls only."<ref name="Catmull" /> This error was further compounded by the fact that the film opened a week before ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''.<ref name="Catmull" />

Looking back on the experience seven years later, Lasseter told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'': "I was determined to bring back [hand-drawn animation] because I felt it was such a heritage of the Disney studio, and I love the art form … I was stunned that ''Princess'' didn't do better. We dug into it and did a lot of research and focus groups. It was viewed as old-fashioned by the audience."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Debruge|first1=Peter|title=Disney's Pixar Acquisition: Bob Iger's Bold Move That Reanimated a Studio|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/features/disney-pixar-acquisition-bob-iger-john-lasseter-1201923719/|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=Variety|publisher=Variety Media|date=22 November 2016|location=Los Angeles}}</ref>

Despite the absence of traditional animated feature films after the release of ''Winnie the Pooh'', Disney Animation has been using both mediums for the sake of experimenting with new techniques and styles. In 2019, after Lasseter's exit from the studio and [[Jennifer Lee (filmmaker)|Jennifer Lee]] as the new chief creative officer of the animation facility the previous year, she, along producer [[Peter Del Vecho]] and director [[Chris Buck]] confirmed that making another 2D animated film is still possible, and that the different styles are driven by the filmmakers who chose what to use to tell their stories in the right way.<ref>https://www.slashfilm.com/hand-drawn-animation-at-walt-disney-animation/</ref>

==Upcoming theme park ride==
On June 25, 2020, Disney announced that the [[Splash Mountain]] theme park attraction, which is themed to the controversial film ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946), would be rethemed to ''The Princess and the Frog'' in [[Disneyland]] and [[Magic Kingdom]], which was stated to have had been in development since 2019. The announcement came amid the ongoing [[George Floyd protests]] and online petitions to change the theme of Splash Mountain.<ref name="Ramirez">{{cite web|url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2020/06/new-adventures-with-princess-tiana-coming-to-disneyland-park-and-magic-kingdom-park/|title=New Adventures with Princess Tiana Coming to Disneyland Park and Magic Kingdom Park|first=Michael|last=Ramirez|work=Disney Parks Blog|date=June 25, 2020|accessdate=June 25, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/06/splash-mountain-new-theme-princess-and-the-frog-song-of-the-south-1202969821/|title=Disneyland's Splash Mountain To Be Reimagined With 'Princess And The Frog' Theme|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=June 25, 2020|accessdate=June 25, 2020}}</ref>

The attraction's storyline will take place after the events of the film, and will involve Tiana and Louis preparing for a [[Mardi Gras]] performance.<ref name="Ramirez" />
