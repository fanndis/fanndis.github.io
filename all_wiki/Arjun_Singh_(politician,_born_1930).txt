==Controversies==

===Bhopal Incident===

Arjun Singh was the [[Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh]] when the [[Bhopal disaster|deadly gas leak from the Union Carbide factory]] occurred. It is widely alleged that on the fateful night between 2 and 3 December 1984, when the gas leak occurred, Arjun Singh fled to his [[Kerwa Dam Palace]] (outside [[Bhopal]]) to save himself from deadly effects of leaked gas and was not available to manage the crisis or lead the administration.<ref>[http://www.indiatvnews.com/politics/national/arjun-singh-missing-mp-chief-minister-during-bhopal-gas-tragedy-21813.html Arjun Singh, the missing MP Chief Minister during Bhopal Gas tragedy]</ref>

Subsequently, the Arjun Singh government's mishandling was criticised by the court in the verdict on Bhopal incident pronounced by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, [[Bhopal]] on 7 June 2010. The media raised serious questions about his role in the release of [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]].<ref>[http://www.thebhopalpost.com/article_details.php?val=19 "How Anderson came and left"], ''The Bhopal Post'', 9 June 2010.</ref>

In particular, the pilot of the aircraft in which [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]] flew out of India after the gas leak, has recorded that the final sanction to permit the flight came from Arjun Singh's office.<ref name=himal>{{cite web|url=http://himalnews.wordpress.com/2010/06/13/national-politics-bjp-loses-appetite-for-dinner-not-pact/ |title=NATIONAL POLITICS: BJP loses appetite for dinner, not pact &#124; News from Darjeeling, Dooars & Sikkim |publisher=Himalnews.wordpress.com |date= 13 June 2010|accessdate=18 April 2016}}</ref>

===Churhat lottery case and Kerwa Dam palace===

While Arjun Singh was the [[Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh]], he was involved in the scandal which was called by some the Churhat Lottery case.
The Churhat Children Welfare Society was floated in 1982 by relatives of Singh, and permitted to raise funds via lottery, and also given tax relief as a charity.<ref>

[[Kerwa Dam]] palace near Bhopal.  The donations to the society included a Rs 150,000 donation from [[Union Carbide]],<ref name=himal/> whose chief [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]] was permitted to leave the country after the gas leak, allegedly by Arjun Singh's office.

At a public litigation hearing the high court observed that "Arjun
Singh owed an explanation to the nation about the costs and sources of
construction of the palatial mansion in Bhopal".<ref name=hindu/> While Singh had claimed the value of the palace was Rs
1.8&nbsp;million, the IT Department estimated the cost at above Rs one [[crore]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Singh |first1=N.

In court, the case was argued by [[Kapil Sibal]] and the order for re-examination was squashed on the grounds that it had been issued in a haste and "had not applied his mind".<ref name=hindu/>

===Other controversies===
