[[File:Live 8 - edinburgh 50000 - the final push rjl.jpg|thumb|[[Live 8]], a large, international series of benefit concerts staged in 2005]]
A '''benefit concert''' or '''charity concert''' is a type of musical [[benefit performance]] (e.g., concert, show, or gala) featuring musicians, comedians, or other performers that is held for a charitable purpose, often directed at a specific and immediate [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian crisis]].

Benefit concerts can have both subjective and concrete objectives. Subjective objectives include raising awareness about an issue such as misery in Africa (such as [[Live 8]]) and uplifting a nation after a disaster (such as [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]). Concrete objectives include raising funds (such as [[Live Aid]]) and influencing legislation (such as Live 8 or [[Farm Aid]]). The two largest benefit concerts of all time, in size, were the Live 8 and the [[Live Earth]] events, which both attracted billions of spectators.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6368799.stm|title=A world of charity concerts|date=2007-02-16|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-GB}}</ref> Scholars theorize that the observed increase on concert size since the Live Aid is happening because organizers strive to make their events as big as the tragedy at hand, thus hoping to gain legitimization that way.<ref name="name=Wells">name="Wells"</ref>

==History==
[[File:BANGLADESHconcert1971Lipack frame.jpg|thumb|The [[Concert For Bangladesh]] (1971), the first modern, large-scale benefit concert]]
Examples exist in [[History of music|musical history]] of concerts being staged for [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] purposes. In 1749, the composer [[George Frideric Handel]] wrote his ''[[Foundling Hospital Anthem]]'', and put on annual performances of ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', to support an orphans' charity in London.<ref name="messiah">{{cite news|last1=Howell|first1=Caro|title=How Handel's Messiah helped London's orphans – and vice versa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/13/handel-messiah-helped-london-orphans-foundling-hospital|accessdate=25 July 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725103619/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/13/handel-messiah-helped-london-orphans-foundling-hospital|archivedate=25 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> While many composers and performers took part in concerts to raise donations for charitable causes, it was also not unusual in the 18th and 19th centuries for musicians to stage performances to raise funds for their own professional work, such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Beethoven concert of 22 December 1808|1808 ''Akademie'' concert]].<ref name="Carnelley">{{cite book|last1=Carnelley|first1=John|title=George Smart and Nineteenth-Century London Concert Life|date=2015|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=9781783270644|pages=72–73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQc3CwAAQBAJ&q=beethoven%20akademie%201808%20benefit%20concert&pg=PA72|accessdate=27 July 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Moses|first1=Don V.|last2=Demaree|first2=Robert W.|last3=Ohmes|first3=Allen F.|title=Face to Face with Orchestra and Chorus: A Handbook for Choral Conductors|date=2004|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253216990|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253216991/page/178 178]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253216991|url-access=registration|quote=beethoven benefit concert December 22, 1808.|accessdate=27 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>

The modern understanding of a benefit concert is of a large-scale, popular event put on to support a charitable or political cause. In the [[Contemporary history|modern era]], the first benefit concert is generally held to be the [[Concert For Bangladesh]], a programme of two events held at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] in 1971, which were organized by [[George Harrison]] and [[Ravi Shankar]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pieper|first1=Jörg|title=The Solo Beatles Film & TV Chronicle 1971–1980|date=2009|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781409283010|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neDkDQAAQBAJ&q=The%20Concert%20for%20Bangladesh%201971%20first%20benefit%20concert&pg=PA31|accessdate=27 July 2017|language=en}}{{self-published source}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} However, the format of most modern concerts was established in 1985 by Bob Geldof's Live Aid event.<ref name=":0" />

==Celebrity charity==
[[File:Bob Geldof Rock am Ring 1987.jpg|thumb|[[Bob Geldof]], who led the [[Live Aid]] event in 1985]]
Benefit concerts are a major example of celebrity charity for they involve popular musicians; actors and actresses; and other kinds of entertainment figures volunteering to a greater cause. The efficiency of celebrity charity is explained by the theory of [[Catalytic Philanthropy]] designed by [[Paul Schervish]]. His thesis explains that it is more beneficial to a cause that celebrities do not contribute by only donating their money, but by participating in event like benefit concerts. That way stars can inspire hundreds of thousands of others to give.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/01/26/haiti-clooney-wyclef-business-entertainment-charitable-celebs.html|title=The Truth About Celebrity Benefit Concerts|last=Pomerantz|first=Dorothy|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>
	
The presence of celebrities can draw criticism, but that is outweighed by the benefits. Some argue that pop stars only take part in charity to improve their public image. That, arguably, may be a motivation, but their participation can be essential to the event's success. Celebrities not only promote catalytic philanthropy, they can produce an effect some call ''Geldofism'': “The mobilization of pop stars and their fans behind a cause.”<ref>Hague, Seth, John Street, and Heather Savigny. 2008. "The Voice Of The People? Musicians As Political Actors." Cultural Politics (Bloomsbury Publishers) 4, no. 1: 5–23.</ref> Therefore, because of their visibility, celebrities are used by organizers as a mean to gain support to the cause in hand.
	
Furthermore, the success of benefit concerts is tightly related to the quality of entertainment offered by them.<ref>Wells, Paul. 2005. "Songs For The Suffering." Maclean's 118, no. 3: 56. MAS Ultra – School Edition.</ref> To gain space and legitimization in the media, benefit concerts must have a large audience, the kind of large crowd attracted by famous music stars. [[Bob Geldof]] himself responded to criticisms about the lack of African artists on the Live 8 by stating that, although those musicians produce great works, they do not sell many albums—and, for the sake of reaching as many people as possible, his concert had to include only popular artists.<ref>name= "Street 2007"</ref>

Finally, the quality of entertainment is key to the creation of a [[public sphere]] where discussions about the concert's cause can occur. The better the entertainment, the more people watch the concert, and thus the more people become aware of the cause.<ref>Street, John, Seth Hague, and Heather Savigny. 2008. "Playing to the Crowd: The Role of Music and Musicians in Political Participation." British Journal of Politics & International Relations 10, no. 2: 269–285.</ref> Furthermore, the music played in the concerts can lead spectators to interconnect and become more likely to act towards the cause. According to a theory, by [[Jane Bennett (political theorist)|Jane Bennett]], when people sing in the presence of other people, and that happens in benefit concerts, they become connected to each other and are more likely to work together towards a goal.<ref>{{Citation | last = John | first = Street | contribution = Politics as music: the sound of ideas and ideology | editor-last = Street | editor-first = John | title = Music and politics | page = [https://archive.org/details/musicpolitics0000stre/page/150 150] | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge, U.K. Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780745635446 | quote = The repetition of songs and the experience of singing, suggests Bennett, can conjure up the meanings, identities and collectivities that enchant us and motivate our commitments.

Critics also say that benefit concerts are just a way for the rich West to forgive itself by helping the poor and distressed. These critiques argue that concerts like the Live Aid "rob Africans of agency, reinforces Western ethnocentrism and racisms and see famine as a natural disaster rather than as a political issue".<ref>Reed, T.V., (Author). 2001. "Famine, Apartheid and the politics of 'Agit-Pop': Music as (anti)colonial discourse." Cercles: Revue Pluridisciplinaire Du Monde Anglophone no. 3: 96. RILM Abstracts of Music Literature.</ref>

== Effectiveness ==
Benefit concerts are an effective form of gaining support and raising funds for a cause because of the large media coverage that they usually receive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peopleandtheplanet.com/?lid=28053&topic=23&section=51|title=People & the Planet : Homepage|website=www.peopleandtheplanet.com|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> In addition to the results they generate themselves, benefit concerts also generate a kind of cascading effect. That is, larger benefit concert motivate smaller concerts and other kinds of charity initiatives.<ref name="name=Wells"/>

== As media events ==
Large-scale benefit concerts attract millions of viewers and are usually broadcast internationally. As powerful means of mass communication, they can be highly effective at raising funds and awareness for humanitarian causes. Media scholars Dayan and Katz classify benefit concerts as “media events”:  shared experiences that unite viewers with one another and their societies.<ref name=katz>Dayan, D., & Katz, E. (1992). ''Media Events: The Live Broadcasting of History''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press</ref> In fact, in their book ''Media Events: The Live Broadcasting of History'', the authors suggest that the song synonymous with the Live Aid benefit concert, “[[We Are the World]]," might as well be the theme song for media events, as it nicely encompasses the tone of such occasions: “these ceremonies (media events) are so all-encompassing that there is nobody left to serve-as out-group”.<ref name=katz />  
	
Dayan and Katz define media events as shared experiences that unite viewers and call their attention to a particular cause or occasion.<ref name=katz /> They argue that media events interrupt the flow people's daily lives, and that such events create a rise of interpersonal communication or “fellow feeling”.<ref name=katz /> Furthermore, they propose that media events transform the ordinary role of the viewer into something more interactive where they adhere to the script of the event.<ref name=katz /> All these principles of media events are true of benefit concerts. Benefit concerts interrupt the routine of people's lives because they occur (in most cases) for only for one night or for one week-end. Furthermore, they are broadcast as television spectacles that interrupt the regular scheduled programming on a given television network. Often, this kind of announced interruption has television viewers discussing the event with others beforehand, generating excitement around the event.<ref name=katz /> Moreover, benefit concerts encourage audiences to adhere to their script, such as by phoning in donations or signing an online pledge.

== Benefit concerts and para-social interaction ==

As media events, benefit concerts are widely broadcast and seen by millions of people. (The Live Aid charity concert in 1985, for example, was seen by an estimated 1.5 billion viewers worldwide.)<ref name=davis>Davis, H. L. (2010). Feeding the World a Line?: Celebrity Activism and Ethical Consumer Practices From Live Aid to Product Red. ''Nordic Journal of English Studies, 9(3) 67–87''</ref> However, this mass dissemination is only one of the factors that contribute to the success of benefit concerts. The people who send the message for collective action are ''essential'' to a benefit concert's effectiveness.

Dayan and Katz suggest that media events are an expression of a “neo-romantic desire for heroic action”, meaning that media events produce leaders who inspire collective action with belief in the “power of the people” to change the world.<ref name=katz /> Benefit concerts, therefore, have the potential to raise enormous sums of money for a cause because of the para-social interaction that occurs between the performing celebrities (the leaders) and the spectating fans (the people).

Dan Laughey describes para-social interaction as “the apparent familiarity between media personalities and audiences”.<ref name=laugh>Laughey, D. (2007). ''Key Themes in Media Theory''. New York, NY: Open University Press</ref> Seeing a favourite celebrity support a cause can influence fans to support the same cause—not because the cause is significant to the fans, but because it seems significant to the artist. To feel connected to a celebrity, fans are likely to participate in activities the celebrity considers important. For example, if a benefit concert starred unknown musicians performing songs for unknown people in Africa, the incentive for viewers to donate would be minimal. Bob Geldof, the founder of Live Aid, is aware of the need of familiarity and para-social interaction on behalf of the viewer. When criticised for not inviting enough African performers to play at Live Aid (of which the main purpose was famine relief for Africa), Geldof commented that only popular musicians were invited to play at the show because unfamiliar artists would cause viewers to lose interest and “switch off”.<ref name=davis /> In seeing the familiar face of their beloved artist on stage endorsing a cause, fans feel more compelled to support the cause.

==Criticisms==
Criticisms against benefit concerts go further than just criticizing the intentions of the celebrities involved. Some argue that benefit concerts are a wrong response for tragedies because the atmosphere involved on them is hardly one of mourning.<ref>Wells, Paul. 2005. "SONGS FOR THE SUFFERING." Maclean's 118, no. 3: 56. MAS Ultra – School Edition.</ref> Further criticism comes from those who argue that Geldofism turns celebrities into the only legitimate spokespeople for a cause, robbing the NGOs of the possibilities to speak up for a cause.<ref>Hague, Seth, John Street, and Heather Savigny. 2008. "THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE? MUSICIANS AS POLITICAL ACTORS." Cultural Politics (Bloomsbury Publishers) 4, no. 1: 5–23.</ref>

:A live concert performance by [[Roger Waters]] and numerous guest artists, of the [[Pink Floyd]] studio album ''[[The Wall]]'', itself largely written by Waters during his time with the band. The show was held in Berlin on 21 July 1990, to commemorate the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] eight months earlier. The event was produced and cast by British impresario and producer Tony Hollingsworth. It was staged partly at Waters' expense. While he subsequently earned the money back from the sale of the CD and video releases of the album, the original plan was to donate all profits past his initial investment to the Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief, a UK charity founded by [[Leonard Cheshire]]. However, audio and video sales came in significantly under projections, and the trading arm of the charity (Operation Dinghy) incurred heavy losses. A few years later, the charity was wound up, and the audio and video sales rights from the concert performance returned to Waters. The show had a sell-out crowd of over 350,000 people, and before the performance started, the gates were opened, which let at least another 100,000 people watch.

The following is an incomplete list of benefit concerts with their own Wikipedia page.
