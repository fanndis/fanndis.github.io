She embarked on her music career with [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[girl group]] [[4 All the Sistas Around da World|Sista]] in the early-mid 1990s and later became a member of the [[Swing Mob]] collective along with childhood friend and longtime collaborator [[Timbaland]], with whom she worked on projects for American R&B acts [[Aaliyah]], [[702 (group)|702]], [[Total (group)|Total]], and [[SWV]]. Following several collaborations and guest appearances, she launched her solo career on July 15, 1997 with her debut album ''[[Supa Dupa Fly]]'', which spawned the top 20 single "[[Sock It 2 Me]]". The album debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the highest charting debut for a female rapper at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1997/07/28/1997-07-28_missy_to_the_max_how_a_regul.html|title=Missy to the Max How a Regular Homegirl Became Hip Hop's Freshest Princess|last=Hunter|first=Karen|date=July 28, 1997|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Elliott's second album, ''[[Da Real World]]'', was released on June 22, 1999, and produced the singles "[[She's a Bitch]]", "[[All n My Grill]]", and top five hit "[[Hot Boyz (song)|Hot Boyz]]."

With the release of ''[[Miss E... So Addictive]]'' (2001), ''[[Under Construction (Missy Elliott album)|Under Construction]]'' (2002), and ''[[This Is Not a Test!|This Is Not a Test]]'' (2003), Elliott established an international career that yielded hits including "[[Get Ur Freak On]]," "[[One Minute Man]]," "[[4 My People]]," "[[Gossip Folks]]," and "[[Work It (Missy Elliott song)|Work It]]." The latter won her a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance]].<ref>https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/missy-misdemeanor-elliott</ref>

At the age of four, she wanted to be a performer, and, as biographer Veronica A. Davis writes, she "would sing and perform for her family". In later years, she feared no one would take her seriously, because she was always the [[wikt:class clown|class clown]].<ref name= scary>{{cite news|last = Baker |first = Lindsay |date = November 1, 2003 |title = Scary?

She enjoyed school for the friendships that she formed even though she had little interest in schoolwork.

Life in Virginia saw many hardships.

In reality, the pair had found refuge at a family member's home where their possessions were stored in a loaded [[U-Haul]] truck.<ref name= action /> Elliott tells her that she feared her father would kill them both for leaving.<ref name="scary"/>

She later stated, "When we left, my mother realized how strong she was on her own, and it made me strong. It took her leaving her home to be able to realize that."<ref name= action /><ref name= scary />

Elliott and her mother lived in the Hodges Ferry neighborhood of [[Portsmouth, Virginia]].<ref name= ambitions/> Elliott graduated from [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Portsmouth, Virginia)|Manor High School]] in Portsmouth, Virginia, in 1990.<ref name= sunshine/>

In 1991, Elliott formed an all female [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] group, called Fayze (later renamed Sista), with friends La'Shawn Shellman, Chonita Coleman, and Radiah Scott.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Kellman|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/missy-elliott-mn0000502371|title=Missy Elliot|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=November 24, 2019}}</ref> She recruited her neighborhood friend [[Timbaland|Timothy Mosley (Timbaland)]] as the group's [[record producer|producer]] and began making demo tracks, among them included the 1991 promo "First Move".<ref name= ew1>{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Ethan|title=Everyone Wants Timbaland| url= https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20015777,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 23, 2007|accessdate=January 16, 2010}}</ref> Later in 1991, Fayze caught the attention of [[Jodeci]] member and producer [[DeVante Swing]]<ref name= sunshine/> by performing Jodeci songs [[a cappella]] for him backstage after one of his group's concerts. In short order, Fayze moved to New York City and signed to [[Elektra Records]] through DeVante's [[Swing Mob]] imprint and also renaming the group Sista.

Timbaland and DeVante jointly produced a Sista album, entitled ''[[4 All the Sistas Around da World]]'' (1994). Elliott met [[R&B music|R&B]] artist [[Mary J.

Though videos were released for the original and remix versions of the single "Brand New", the album was shelved and never released.<ref name= ew1 /> One of the group's tracks, "It's Alright" featuring [[Craig Mack]] did however make the cut on the [[Dangerous Minds (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of the 1995 motion picture ''[[Dangerous Minds]] but'' by the end of 1995, Swing Mob had folded and many of its members dispersed.

=== 1996–98: ''Supa Dupa Fly'' ===
[[File:Aaliyah Dana Haughton 02.jpg|alt=Aaliyah smiling|thumb|Elliott began collaborating with other artists in the late 1990s, including Aaliyah (pictured in 2000).]]
After leaving Swing Mob, Elliott and Timbaland worked together as a songwriting/production team, crafting tracks for acts including [[SWV]], [[702 (group)|702]], and most notably [[Aaliyah]].<ref name="How They Made It"/> The pair wrote and produced nine tracks for Aaliyah's second album, ''[[One in a Million (Aaliyah album)|One in a Million]]'' (1996), among them the hit singles "[[If Your Girl Only Knew]]", "[[One in a Million (Aaliyah song)|One in a Million]]", "[[Hot Like Fire]]", and "[[4 Page Letter]]".<ref name= Allmusic /> Elliott contributed background vocals and/or guest raps to nearly all of the tracks on which she and Timbaland worked. ''One in a Million'' went [[double platinum]] and made stars out of the production duo. Elliott and Timbaland continued to work together for other artists, later creating hits for artists such as [[Total (group)|Total]]; "[[What About Us? (Total song)|What About Us?]]" (1997), [[Nicole Wray]]; "[[Make It Hot (Nicole Wray song)|Make It Hot]]" (1998), and [[Destiny's Child]]; "[[Get on the Bus (song)|Get on the Bus]]" (1998), as well as one final hit for Aaliyah, "[[I Care 4 U (song)|I Care 4 U]]", before her death in 2001. Elliott also wrote the bulk of [[Total (band)|Total]]'s second and final album ''[[Kima, Keisha, and Pam]]'' and [[Nicole Wray]]'s debut ''[[Make It Hot]]'' (both released in 1998). Elliott began her career as a featured vocalist rapping on [[Sean "Puffy" Combs]]'s Bad Boy remixes to [[Gina Thompson]]'s "[[The Things That You Do]]", (which had a video featuring cameo appearances by Notorious B.I.G and Puff Daddy), [[MC Lyte]]'s 1996 hit single "[[Cold Rock a Party]]" (backup vocals by Gina Thompson), and [[New Edition]]'s 1996 single "[[You Don't Have to Worry (New Edition song)|You Don't Have to Worry]]". In 1996, Elliott also appeared on the Men of Vizion's remix of "Do Thangz" which was produced by [[Rodney Jerkins]] (coincidentally the producer of the original version of "[[The Things That You Do]]").

Combs had hoped to sign Elliott to his [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]] record label. Instead, she signed a deal in 1996 to create her own imprint, [[The Goldmind Inc.]], with [[East West Records]], which at that time was a division of [[Elektra Records|Elektra Entertainment Group]], for which she would record as a solo artist.<ref name="How They Made It"/> Timbaland was again recruited as her production partner, a role he would hold on most of Elliott's solo releases. Missy continued to work with other artists and appeared on [[LSG (band)|LSG]]'s song "All the Time" with [[Gerald Levert]], [[Keith Sweat]], [[Johnny Gill]], [[Faith Evans]], and [[Coko]] in 1997 on Levert Sweat Gill classic album. The same year, she rapped in "Keys To My House" with old friends group [[LeVert]]. In the center of a busy period of making guest appearances and writing for other artists, Elliott's debut album, ''[[Supa Dupa Fly]]'', was released in mid-1997; the success of its lead single "[[The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)|The Rain]]" led the album to be certified platinum.<ref name= Allmusic />

The success was also a result of the music videos of her single releases, which were directed by [[Hype Williams|Harold "Hype" Williams]], who created many groundbreaking hip hop, Afro-futuristic videos at the time. The album was nominated for Best Rap Album at the [[1998 Grammy Awards]], but lost to [[Puff Daddy]]'s ''[[No Way Out (Puff Daddy album)|No Way Out]]''. The year also saw Elliott perform live at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] show on a remix to [[Lil' Kim]]'s "Ladies Night" with fellow rappers [[Da Brat]], [[Angie Martinez]] and [[TLC (group)|TLC]]-rapper [[Lisa Lopes|Left Eye]]. Elliott continued her successful career in the background as a producer and writer on [[Total (group)|Total]]'s single "Trippin'", as well as working with several others in the hip-hop and [[R&B]] communities. Elliott co-wrote and co-produced two tracks on [[Whitney Houston]]'s 1998 album ''[[My Love Is Your Love]]'', providing vocal cameos for "In My Business" and "Oh Yes". Elliott also produced and made a guest appearance on [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]] [[Mel B|Melanie Brown]]'s debut solo single, "I Want You Back", which topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] in Brown's native [[United Kingdom]] and is Elliot's only chart-topping song in that country.

=== 1999–2001: ''Da Real World'' and ''Miss E… So Addictive'' ===
Although a much darker album than her debut, Elliott's second album was just as successful as the first,<ref name=VH1-3>[http://www.vh1.com/shows/events/hip_hop_honors/_2007/honoree_detail.jhtml?id=missy&page=3 Missy Elliott – Me, I'm Supa Dupa Fly] ''VH1''.

This one took almost two months…I couldn't rush it the second time because people expect more."<ref name=VH1-3/> ''[[Da Real World]]'' (1999) included the singles "[[All n My Grill]]", a collaboration with [[Nicole Wray]] and [[Big Boi]] (from [[OutKast]]), a remix to "[[Hot Boyz (song)|Hot Boyz]]" and "[[She's a Bitch]]". Also in 1999, Elliott was featured, alongside Da Brat, on the official remix to a Mariah Carey single "[[Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)|Heartbreaker]]".<ref name="MTV News 2">{{cite web | title=Mariah Carey Casts "Rainbow" For Next LP; Taps Missy, Da Brat For Remix |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1426929/19990813/carey_mariah.jhtml|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=August 13, 1999 | accessdate=May 7, 2009}}</ref> A  music video was filmed for the remix, shot in black and white and featuring a cameo appearance by Dogg.

Missy Elliott next released ''[[Miss E... So Addictive]]'' on May 15, 2001. The album spawned the massive pop and urban hits "[[One Minute Man]]", featuring [[Ludacris]] and [[Trina]], and "[[Get Ur Freak On]]", as well as the international [[Club music|club]] hit "[[4 My People]]" and the less commercially successful single "[[Take Away (song)|Take Away]]". The double music video for "Take Away/4 My People" was released in the fall of 2001, shortly after the sudden death of Elliott's close friend Aaliyah on August 25 and the [[9/11]] terrorist attacks. The "Take Away" video contained images of and words about Aaliyah, and the slow ballad acted as a tribute to her memory. The remainder of the video was the more upbeat "4 My People", contained scenes of people dancing happily in front of American flags and Elliott dressed in red, white and blue. Though "Take Away" was not a success on radio, "4 My People" went on to become an American and European [[nightclub|club]] hit due to a popular remix by [[house music]] duo [[Basement Jaxx]] in 2002.

[[Tweet (singer)|Tweet]]'s appearance on Elliott's "Take Away" as well as her cameo at Elliott's house on ''[[MTV Cribs]]'' helped to create a buzz about the new R&B singer. Tweet's own debut single, "Oops (Oh My)", was co-written by Elliott and released through Goldmind in February 2002. The single was a top ten hit, thanks partially to Elliott's songwriting and guest rap, and to Timbaland's unusual production on the track. Elliott co-produced the [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lil' Kim]], [[Mýa]] and [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] cover of "[[Lady Marmalade]]" for the album ''[[Moulin Rouge! Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film]]'',<ref>{{cite news |title= Missy hitting the mark |work= The Straits Times |location= Singapore |date= January 30, 2003 |first= Tommy |last= Wee |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=10015ADE0C3C38A3&p_docnum=6&p_queryname=15 }}</ref> which went to number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] in 2001.

=== 2002–04: ''Under Construction'' and ''This Is Not a Test!'' ===
For her next outing, Elliott and Timbaland focused on an old school sound, utilizing many old school rap and funk samples, such as [[Run–D.M.C.]]'s "Peter Piper" and [[Frankie Smith]]'s "Double Dutch Bus."

[[File:Missy Elliott 2006.jpg|alt=Elliott in a track suit with a microphone|thumb|Elliott onstage, 2006]]
Elliott wanted to "give people the unexpected" by utilizing producers other than Timbaland and a "more to the center" sound not as [[Out of left field|far left]] as her other music.<ref name=yahoo/> Her sixth solo album, ''[[The Cookbook]]'' was released on July 4, 2005, debuted at number two on the U.S. charts and was certified [[Gold album|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), selling 645,000 copies in the United States.

"[[Lose Control (Missy Elliott song)|Lose Control]]" featuring [[Ciara]] and [[Fatman Scoop]], became a Top 5 hit in the midyear (peaking at number three on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]). The second single, Teary Eyed, did not chart, although the video charted on MTV's ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' for a few weeks, and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s ''[[106 & Park]]'' for a few days. The third single, "[[We Run This]]", was released with heavy airplay on [[VH1]], [[MTV]], and BET. It served as the lead single for the soundtrack to the gymnastics-themed film ''[[Stick It]].'' The song was also nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Rap Solo Performance category in 2006. ''[[Respect M.E.]]'', Elliott's first greatest hits album, was released outside the United States and Canada on September 4, 2006, only in South Africa, Australia, Europe, Japan, and Brazil.

Elliott released her first [[extended play]] on August 23, 2019, titled ''[[Iconology (EP)| Iconology]]''. The five-track EP features a variety of musical genres that cover the breadth of her career as an artist and has received favorable reviews from critics. Upon release of the album, she also released the lead single, "[[Throw It Back (Missy Elliott song)|Throw It Back]]", with a music video featuring [[Teyana Taylor]]. Musically, ''Iconology'' is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] EP reminiscent of Elliott's previous work. The opening track, "[[Throw It Back (Missy Elliott song)|Throw It Back]]" contains "[[Trap music|trap]] snares and a serpentine bassline", which along with the second track, "Cool Off", were described as "woozy, futuristic romps" containing "distorted bass lines and frenetic production". Lyrically, "Throw It Back" contains references to Elliott's history, as well as previous collaborators [[Tweet (singer)|Tweet]] and [[Heavy D]]. Maura Johnson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described "Cool Off" as calling "back to hip-hop’s two-turntables-and-a-mic early days". "DripDemeanor" has been described as a slow jam that explores Elliott's "sensuous side". Musically, it contains "plush synths [that] skip-step underneath" the song's beat. "Why I Still Love You" is a [[doo-wop]] song with [[Gospel music|gospel]] influences and jazz influence that lyrically chronicles the singer's "conflicted emotions about holding on to a cheating lover". The EP closes with an [[a cappella]] version of "Why I Still Love You".

Elliott was motivated to write uplifting music to counter mainstream trends and encourage more [[dance music]] to feel good. "DripDemeanor" was released as the album's second single on October 22. "Why I Still Love You" was released as the third single on January 17, 2020. "Cool Off" was released as the fourth and final single from the EP on April 21, 2020.

On June 26, 2020, Elliott appeared on the official remix to [[Toni Braxton]]'s single "[[Do It (Toni Braxton song)|Do It]]".
Elliott co-produced the track alongside Hannon Lane.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://music.apple.com/gb/album/do-it-single/1519291115|title=Do It (Remix) featuring Missy Elliott|work=[[iTunes]]|date=June 26, 2020|accessdate=June 28, 2020}}</ref>

On August 13, 2020, Elliott appeared on the remix single "[[Levitating (song)|Levitating]]" by [[Dua Lipa]] which also featured [[Madonna]]. The remix was produced by [[The Blessed Madonna]]. Unlike Madonna, Elliott appeared in the video.

Maybe in the year 2020 you could just pop a baby out and it'd be fine. But right now I'd rather just [[adoption|adopt]]."<ref name=people/> Elliott and her father speak occasionally, but the rapper says she has not forgiven him for the domestic violence she witnessed towards her mother.<ref name= action /><ref name= scary />

In June 2011, Elliott told ''People'' magazine that her absence from the music industry was due to a [[hyperthyroidism]] disorder known as [[Graves' disease]]. She was diagnosed after she nearly crashed a car from having severe leg spasms while driving. She experienced severe symptoms from the condition, and she could not even hold a pen to write songs. After treatment, her symptoms stabilized.
