The '''Deutsche Bundesbank''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏtʃə ˈbʊndəsˌbaŋk|pron}}), literally "German Federal Bank", is the [[central bank]] of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] and as such part of the [[European System of Central Banks]] (ESCB). Due to its strength and former size, the Bundesbank is the most influential member of the ESCB. Both the Bundesbank and the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) are located in [[Frankfurt]], Germany. It is sometimes referred to as "Buba" for '''Bu'''ndes'''ba'''nk, while its official abbreviation is '''BBk'''.<ref>[http://www.goldensextant.com/commentary14.html#anchor9333  Buba: Blowing the Whistle on Big Bubba's Gold Manipulators?]</ref>

The Bundesbank was established in 1957 and succeeded the [[Bank deutscher Länder]], which introduced the [[Deutsche Mark]] on 20 June 1948. Until the euro was physically introduced in 2002, the Bundesbank was the central bank of the former [[Deutsche Mark]] ("German Mark", sometimes known in English as the "Deutschmark").{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The Bundesbank was the first central bank to be given full independence, leading this form of central bank to be referred to as the ''Bundesbank model'', as opposed, for instance, to the ''New Zealand model'', which has a goal (i.e. inflation target) set by the government.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Nowadays, the ECB also uses the Bundesbank model, making the concept the foundation of the entire Euro system.

The Bundesbank was greatly respected for its control of inflation through the second half of the 20th century. This made the German Mark one of the most respected currencies, and the Bundesbank gained substantial indirect influence in many European countries.

==History of the Bundesbank as an organization==
{{For|the history of German central banks|Reichsbank}}

===1948–1957===
[[File:Deutsche Bundesbank by Matthew Bisanz.jpg|thumb|300px|Headquarters in Frankfurt (since 1972)]]
The history of the Bundesbank is inextricably linked with the history of the German currency after the Second World War. Following the total destruction after the war, the old [[Reichsmark]] was practically worthless, and a currency reform was implemented in the western occupation zones including West Berlin: on 21 June 1948, the D-Mark, or Deutsche Mark, replaced the Reichsmark. The currency reform was based on laws enacted by the Allied military government. In preparation, the [[Western Powers]] established a new two-tier central bank system in the occupied zones; in its federal structure, it was modeled on the Federal Reserve System of the USA. It comprised the central banks of the states (''Länder'') of the West German occupation zones and the Bank deutscher Länder in [[Frankfurt am Main]], which was created on 1 March 1948. The central banks of the ''Länder'' acted as central banks within their areas of jurisdiction. The Bank deutscher Länder, whose share capital was held by the central banks of the ''Länder'', was responsible for issuing bank notes, co-ordinating policy and various central tasks including management of foreign exchange. The supreme governing body of the two-tier central bank system was the Central Bank Council (''Zentralbankrat'') set up at the Bank deutscher Länder. It consisted of a president, the presidents of the central banks of the ''Länder'' and the president of the directorate (board) of the Bank deutscher Länder. Amongst other things, the Central Bank Council determined policy on bank rate and minimum reserve policy, open-market policy guidelines and granting of credit. After the negative experience with a central bank subject to government orders, the principle of an independent central bank was established. The ''Bank deutscher Länder'' was independent of German political bodies from the start, including the federal German government, which was active from September 1949. It achieved independence from the Allies in 1951.

===1957–1990===
The German "[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]]" (constitution), which had come into force on 23 May 1949, placed an obligation on the German federal legislature to establish a federal bank responsible for the issue of bank notes and currency.<ref>[http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/GG.htm#88 Article 88 of the ''Grundgesetz''], translation of the version as amended to take account of the [[European Union]]</ref> The legislature fulfilled this obligation by passing the Bundesbank Act (''BBankG'') of 26 July 1957, which abolished the two-tier structure of the central bank system.<ref name=" BBank1998">[http://www.bundesbank.de/download/presse/publikationen/bbkgesetz_june1998.pdf Bundesbank Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005205900/http://www.bundesbank.de/download/presse/publikationen/bbkgesetz_june1998.pdf |date=5 October 2006 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref> The central banks of the ''Länder'' were now no longer independent note-issuing banks, but became regional headquarters of the Bundesbank, nevertheless retaining the title "state central bank" (''Landeszentralbank'').

The Central Bank Council remained the supreme decision-making body of the Bundesbank. It was now made up of the presidents of the central banks of the ''Länder'' and a board of directors based in Frankfurt. The Central Bank Council decided on the currency and credit policy and laid down rules for management. As the central executive body of the Bundesbank, the Directorate (''Direktorium'') was responsible for implementing the decisions of the Central Bank Council. The Directorate ran the bank and was, in particular, responsible for dealings with the federal government and its "special assets" (''Sondervermögen''), for transactions with credit institutes operating in the Federal republic of Germany, for currency transactions, and foreign commercial transactions, and for [[open-market]] dealings. The Directorate was made up of the president and the vice-president of the Bundesbank and up to six additional members.

The central banks of the ''Länder'' carried out business falling in their areas independently. The Bundesbank Act explicitly made them responsible for dealings with public bodies and credit institutes. The central Banks of the ''Länder'' also controlled the subsidiary bodies (''Zweiganstalten''), now called branches (''Filialen''). Overall management of each ''Land'' central bank was in the hands of its executive board (''Vorstand''), which as a rule consisted of the president and the vice-president of the bank.

===1990–1993===
In the wake of the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall]], the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] and the [[German Democratic Republic]] signed a treaty on 18 May 1990, that created an economic, social and currency union between the two German nations; it came into force on 1 July 1990, and made the [[Deutschmark|Deutsche Mark]] the sole legal tender in both German states. The Bundesbank was made responsible for money and currency policy within the whole of the currency union. A "Provisional Administration Body" was set up for the purpose of implementing the treaty, and this body continued to operate beyond the official date of reunification until 31 October 1990. The Bundesbank Act was amended to adjust the organizational structure of the Bundesbank to better match changed circumstances following German reunification, and at the same time streamline the organisation. The eleven central banks of the ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'' and the Provisional Administrative Body were replaced by nine central banks of similar economic size.

===1993–2001===
[[File:10 DM Serie4 Vorderseite.jpg|thumb|upright|A 10 DM note issued by the Bundesbank]]
The [[Maastricht Treaty]] that came into force on 1 November 1993 laid the foundation for the European Economic and Currency Union (EECU). National responsibility for monetary policy was transferred, at the Community level, to the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), comprising the European Central bank (ECB) and the national central banks (NCBs) of the EU states. Until the ECB became fully responsible for currency in 2001, the Bundesbank had three governing bodies. The Central Bank Council (''Zentralbankrat'') was the supreme body of the Bundesbank. It was made up of:
# the Directorate, which comprised the president, the vice-president and six additional members. These eight people were nominated by the Federal Government (''Bundesregierung'')
# The nine presidents of the ''Landeszentralbanken''. These were nominated by the ''[[German Bundesrat|Bundesrat]]''.
The Directorate was the executive body of the Bundesbank, while all currency policy decisions were made by the Central Bank Council.

===2001–present===
In 2001 the ECB took over full control of currency. The Bundesbank Act was last amended in 2002 by the 7th Law Amending the Law on the Bundesbank of 30 April 2002, which gave the Bundesbank its current structure.

==The Bundesbank today==
{{PoliticsGermany}}

After the ECB took over responsibility for currency, the Bundesbank continued to exist. Its duties were redefined by the 7th Law amending the "Law on the German Bundesbank" of 30 April 2002, in Section 3 of the Bundesbank Act:<ref name="BBankG -en">[http://www.bundesbank.de/download/presse/publikationen/bbkgesetz_june1998.pdf Bundesbank Act (6th amendment)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005205900/http://www.bundesbank.de/download/presse/publikationen/bbkgesetz_june1998.pdf |date=5 October 2006 }} {{ISBN|3-932002-96-2}}{{in lang|en}}</ref>
:The Bundesbank, being the central bank of the Federal Republic of Germany, is an integral part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). It shall participate in the performance of the ESCB's tasks with the primary objective of maintaining price stability, and shall arrange for the execution of domestic and international payments. In addition, it shall discharge the duties assigned to it under this Act or other legislation.

Unlike other central banks such as the [[Bank of England]] and the U.S. [[Federal Reserve]] (but like the ECB), the Bundesbank is not officially responsible for maintaining the stability of the financial system and is not a [[lender of last resort]].<ref name="Prati">

</ref>

Based on the Bundesbank Act and the ECB Statute, the Bundesbank has four areas of activity, which it mostly handles jointly with the ECB:

===The Bundesbank as a note-issuing bank===
As a note-issuing bank, the Bundesbank provides the economy with cash, and ensures the physical circulation of [[cash]]. It checks the cash delivered by banks and money transport companies, removes counterfeit money from circulation and hands it to the police.  It changes D-Mark holdings still in circulation, without any time limit and replaces damaged or mutilated notes (National Analysis Centre for Counterfeit and Damaged Banknotes and Coins). It also issues information on the safety mechanisms for notes and coins and issues a weekly bulletin on the volume of cash in circulation.

===The Bundesbank as the banks' banker===
In relation to the [[commercial bank]]ing system, the Bundesbank has two functions:

====Clearing house for commercial banks====
Firstly, the Bundesbank is a  ''refinancing source'' and [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] for the commercial banks. The commercial banks can use what are known as "refinancing instruments" to cover their needs for [[monetary base|central bank money]] through the Bundesbank and the ECB. Until the end of 1998, the control of the money supply by this method was one of the main tasks of the Bundesbank. Since 1 January 1999, one of the principal aims of the ECB has been to maintain price stability by means of its monetary strategy. Commercial banks can deposit money that is temporarily surplus to requirements with the Bundesbank/ECB (known as a deposit facility). The Bundesbank supports cross-border payments between domestic and foreign commercial banks, for instance by means of the German [[Real-time gross settlement|real time gross transfer]] system [[RTGSplus]] and [[TARGET2]].

====Bank supervision====
The bank also helps to regulate commercial banks, in close cooperation with the German financial regulatory agency the [[Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Germany)|''Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht'']] (BaFin).<ref name="mou-BaFin">
[http://www.bafin.de/sonstiges/mou_021031_en.htm Memorandum of Understanding relating to Cooperation between the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht and the Bundesbank regarding the supervision of credit and financial services institutions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026094244/http://www.bafin.de/sonstiges/mou_021031_en.htm |date=26 October 2006 }}</ref>

===The Bundesbank as the state's banker===
As the state's banker, the Bundesbank provides accounts and performs normal banking services for federal, state (''Land'') and local authorities, as well as for the statutory [[social security]] organizations. All such accounts are required to have a positive balance, i.e. the Bundesbank is not allowed to grant credits to the public sector. This is due to negative historical precedents in connection with the financing of two world wars by the [[Deutsche Reichsbank]]. It also carries out securities transactions for the federal government (''Bundesfinanzagentur'').

===The Bundesbank as the keeper of the currency reserves===
[[Currency reserves]] are all assets of the Bundesbank that are not specified in EUR, including [[gold reserves]], securities in foreign currency, credit with foreign banks, foreign exchange, etc. Currency reserves can be invested for profit and also provide a possibility of intervening in the market if the exchange rate fluctuates strongly. The gold reserves of the Bundesbank are the second largest in the world (after the U.S Federal Reserve). As of late 2011, the Bundesbank has over 3,000 [[tonne]]s of gold reserves.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

====Structure====
[[Image:Bundesbank Hauptverwaltungen.svg|thumb|Map of the member banks of the Bundesbank]]
The Bundesbank has nine regional headquarters in the [[Bundesland (Germany)|''Länder'']], the former central banks of the ''Länder'' and 35 branches (''Filiale''). As of 30 June 2006, the Bundesbank had a total of 12,474 employees.<ref name="Personnel statistics">{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesbank.de/personal/personal_statistik.en.php?print=no&|title=Jobs and careers - Staff statistics|website=Bundesbank|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095735/http://www.bundesbank.de/personal/personal_statistik.en.php?print=no&|archivedate=29 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> These are available to banks, public authorities and money transport enterprises for the provision of [[cash]] and the clearing of credit transfer.
The nine regional headquarters are:
* [[Frankfurt]] – federal headquarters, also governing the state of [[Hesse]].
* [[Stuttgart]], governing the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]]
* [[Munich]], governing the state of [[Bavaria]]
* [[Berlin]], governing federal city [[Berlin]] and the state of [[Brandenburg]]
* [[Hanover]], governing the states of [[Bremen]], [[Lower Saxony]] and [[Saxony-Anhalt]]
* [[Hamburg]], governing the states of [[Hamburg]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]
* [[Düsseldorf]], governing the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]
* [[Mainz]], governing the states of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Saarland]]
* [[Leipzig]], governing the states of [[Saxony]] and [[Thuringia]]

====Governance====
The executive board (''Vorstand'') is the supreme governing body of the Bundesbank. It comprises:<ref>{{cite web|title=Organisation of the Deutsche Bundesbank|url=http://www.bundesbank.de/aufgaben/aufgaben_organisation.en.php|publisher=Deutsche Bundesbank|accessdate=4 August 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521100547/http://www.bundesbank.de/aufgaben/aufgaben_organisation.en.php|archivedate=21 May 2011}}</ref> the president, the vice president and one additional board member, nominated by the German government, plus three additional members of the executive board, nominated by the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]]. All members of the executive board are appointed by the [[President of Germany]], normally for eight years, but at least for five years.

==Disputes between the Bundesbank and the government==
The statutory independence of the central bank guaranteed by the Bundesbank Act does not ensure that there will be no disputes between the central bank and government.

===Dispute over currency union with East Germany===
One particularly public dispute was in the lead-up to German re-unification. When a customs union was created between the former East Germany ([[German Democratic Republic]]) and [[West Germany]] (the "old" Federal Republic of Germany), there was a dispute over the rate of exchange for conversion of East German money to Deutschmarks. The Chancellor (Helmut Kohl) decided to ignore the advice of the Bundesbank, and chose an exchange rate of 1:1. The Bundesbank feared that this would be excessively inflationary as well as very significantly impairing the economic prospects of the area of the former East Germany. This dispute was particularly public because of the Bundesbank policy of communicating openly on such matters. Although public opinion normally supported the Bundesbank in matters of combating inflation, in this case Helmut Kohl prevailed, and the President of the Bundesbank, Pöhl, resigned. The Bundesbank had to use monetary measures to offset the inflationary effect.<ref name="IMF1">Pierre L.

==The Bundesbank in the news==
In 2004 the president of the Bundesbank, [[Ernst Welteke]], resigned after the press published allegations that his hotel bills for a New Year celebration had been paid by a commercial bank and he was criticized for his handling of the affair. There were also some allegations that this was part of a political intrigue to remove Welteke from office because he opposed selling Bundesbank gold reserves, as desired by the government. After Pöhl (see [[#Dispute over currency union with East Germany|above]]), Welteke was the second Bundesbank president to resign.<ref name="Rhetorik">

On Wednesday, 24 February 2016, as part of the [[Bundesbank]]'s annual news conference, [[Bundesbank]] president and [[European Central Bank]] Governing Council member, [[Jens Weidmann]], dismissed deflation in light of the [[European Central Bank|ECB]]'s current stimulus program, pointing out the healthy condition of the [[Economy of Germany|German economy]] and that the [[Eurozone|euro area]] isn't that bad off, on the eve of the 9–10 March 2016 meetings.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bundesbank President Dismisses Deflation, Increases Tension at ECB|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3057181/bundesbank-deflation-fears-increase-tensions-with-ecb|publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|date=24 February 2016}}</ref>

==Involvement in the European sovereign debt crisis==
{{main|European sovereign debt crisis}}

In June 2012, it was estimated that the Bundesbank had €644 billion exposure to other central banks in the [[eurozone]] under the [[TARGET2]] payment system. Only three other eurozone central banks had net exposure from the system; all others had the offsetting net exposure due to the system. The net exposure finances trade imbalances and capital flight.<ref>Das, Satyajit, ''[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/germany-and-france-cant-afford-euro-zone-bailout-2012-06-07?link=MW_story_investinginsight "Germany and France can’t afford euro-zone bailout"], Commentary, [[MarketWatch]]'', 7 June 2012.

On 27 January 2014, the Bundesbank called for a capital levy on citizens of a nation before that nation applies for relief under the [[European Financial Stability Facility]].  The levy "corresponds to the principle of national responsibility, according to which tax payers are responsible for their government's obligations before solidarity of other states is required".<ref name=levy>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/27/us-eurozone-crisis-bundesbank-idUSBREA0Q0HV20140127 Reuters: "Bundesbank calls for capital levy to avert government bankruptcies" 27 Jan 2014]</ref> This followed an [[IMF]] report from October 2013 which proposed a similar wealth tax.<ref name=levy/>
