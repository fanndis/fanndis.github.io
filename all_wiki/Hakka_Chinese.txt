'''Hakka''' is a language group of [[varieties of Chinese]], spoken natively by the [[Hakka people]] throughout Southern [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and throughout the [[diaspora]] areas of [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and in [[overseas Chinese]] communities around the world.

Due to its primary usage in scattered isolated regions where communication is limited to the local area, Hakka has developed numerous [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] or [[dialect]]s, spoken in different provinces, such as [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Hainan]], [[Fujian]], [[Sichuan]], [[Hunan]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Guizhou]], as well as in [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. Hakka is not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with [[Yue Chinese|Yue]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Southern Min]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] or other branches of Chinese, and itself contains a few mutually unintelligible varieties. It is most closely related to [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] and is sometimes classified as a variety of Gan, with a few northern Hakka varieties even being partially mutually intelligible with southern Gan. There is also a possibility that the similarities are just a result of shared [[areal feature]]s.<ref>Thurgood & LaPolla, 2003. ''The Sino-Tibetan Languages''. Routledge.</ref>

Taiwan (where Hakka is the native language of a significant minority of the island's residents) is a center for the study and preservation of the language. Pronunciation differences exist between the [[Taiwanese Hakka]] dialects and Mainland China's Hakka dialects; even in Taiwan, two major local varieties of Hakka exist.

The [[Meixian dialect]] (Moiyen) of Northeast [[Guangdong]] in China has been taken as the "standard" dialect by the People's Republic of [[China]]. The Guangdong Provincial Education Department created an official [[romanization]] of Moiyen in 1960, one of four languages receiving this status in Guangdong.

==Etymology==
The name of the Hakka people who are the predominant original native speakers of the variety literally means "guest families" or "guest people": ''Hak'' {{lang|zh|客}} (Mandarin: {{transl|zh|kè}}) means "guest", and ''ka'' 家 (Mandarin: {{transl|zh|jiā}}) means "family". Among themselves, Hakka people variously called their language ''Hak-ka-fa'' (''-va'') {{lang|zh-Hant|客家話}}, ''Hak-fa'' (''-va'') {{lang|zh-Hant|客話}}, ''Tu-gong-dung-fa'' (''-va'') {{lang|zh-Hant|土廣東話}}, literally "Native Guangdong language", and ''Ngai-fa'' (''-va''){{lang|zh-Hant|𠊎話}}, "My/our language". In [[Tonggu County]], [[Jiangxi]] province, people call their language ''Huai-yuan-fa'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|怀远話}}).

==History==

===Early history===
It is commonly believed that [[Hakka people]] have their origins in several episodes of migration from northern [[China]] into southern [[China]] during periods of war and civil unrest<ref>[http://edu.ocac.gov.tw/lang/hakka/english/a/a.htm Hakka Migration]</ref> dating back as far as the end of [[Western Jin]].<ref>[h
http://edu.ocac.gov.tw/lang/hakka/a/main_a11.htm Migration of the Hakka people (in Chinese])</ref> The forebears of the Hakka came from present-day [[Central Plains (China)|Central Plains]] provinces of [[Henan]] and [[Shaanxi]], and brought with them features of Chinese varieties spoken in those areas during that time. (Since then, the speech in those regions has evolved into dialects of modern [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]). The presence of many archaic features occur in modern Hakka, including final consonants {{IPA|-p -t -k}}, as are found in other modern southern Chinese varieties, but which have been lost in Mandarin.

[[Laurent Sagart]] (2002)<ref>Sagart, Laurent. 2002. [https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00095941 Gan, Hakka and the Formation of Chinese Dialects]. ''Dialect Variations in Chinese'', 129-153. Papers from the Third International Conference on Sinology, Linguistics Section.</ref> considers Hakka and southern [[Gan Chinese]] to be sister dialects that descended from a single common ancestral language (Proto-Southern Gan) spoken in central Jiangxi during the [[Song Dynasty]]. In Hakka and southern Gan, Sagart (2002) identifies a non-Chinese [[substratum]] that is possibly [[Hmong-Mien languages|Hmong-Mien]], an archaic layer, and a more recent Late [[Middle Chinese]] layer. Lexical connections between Hakka, Kra-Dai, and Hmong-Mien have also been suggested by Deng (1999).<ref>Deng, Xiaohua 邓晓华. 1999. [http://www.nssd.org/articles/article_detail.aspx?id=1002191501 Kejiahua gen Miao-yao Zhuangdongyu de Guanxi wenti 客家话跟苗瑶壮侗语的关系问题]. ''Minzu Yuwen'' 民族语文 3:42-49.</ref>

Due to the migration of its speakers, Hakka may have been influenced by other language areas through which the Hakka-speaking forebears migrated. For instance, common vocabulary is found in Hakka, [[Min Chinese|Min]], and the [[She language|She]] (Hmong–Mien) languages.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Today, most [[She people]] in Fujian and Zhejiang speak [[Shehua]], which is closely related to Hakka.

===Linguistic development===
A regular pattern of sound change can generally be detected in Hakka, as in most Chinese varieties, of the derivation of [[phoneme]]s from earlier forms of Chinese. Some examples:
* Characters such as 武 (war, martial arts) or 屋 (room, house), pronounced roughly ''mwio'' and ''uk'' (''mjuX'' and ''ʔuwk'' in [[Baxter's transcription for Middle Chinese|Baxter's transcription]]) in Early [[Middle Chinese]], have an initial ''v'' phoneme in Hakka, being ''vu'' and ''vuk'' in Hakka respectively. Like in Mandarin, labiodentalisation in Hakka also changed ''mj-'' to a w-like sound before grave vowels, while Cantonese retained the original distinction (compare Mandarin 武 ''wǔ'', 屋 ''wū'', Cantonese 武 ''mou''<sup>5</sup>, 屋 ''uk''<sup>1</sup>).
* Middle Chinese initial phonemes /ɲ/ (''ny'' in Baxter's transcription) of the characters 人 (person, people) and 日 (sun, day), among others, merged with ''ng-'' /ŋ/ initials in Hakka (人 ''ngin'', 日 ''ngit''). For comparison, in Mandarin, /ɲ/ became ''r-'' /ɻ/ (人 ''rén'', 日 ''rì''), while in Cantonese, it merged with initial ''y-'' /j/ (人 ''yan''<sup>4</sup>, 日 ''yat''<sup>6</sup>).
* The initial consonant phoneme exhibited by the character 話 (word, speech; Mandarin ''huà'') is pronounced ''f'' or ''v'' in Hakka (''v'' does not properly exist as a distinct unit in many Chinese varieties).
* The initial consonant of 學 ''{{IPA|hɔk}}'' usually corresponds with an ''h'' [h] approximant in Hakka and a voiceless alveo-palatal fricative (''x'' [ɕ]) in Mandarin.

==Phonology==
{{further|Meixian dialect#Phonology}}

==Dialects==
Hakka has as many regional dialects as there are counties with Hakka speakers as the majority. Some of these Hakka dialects are not mutually intelligible with each other. [[Mei County, Guangdong|Meixian]] is surrounded by the counties of [[Pingyuan County, Guangdong|Pingyuan]], [[Dabu County|Dabu]], [[Jiaoling]], [[Xingning, Guangdong|Xingning]], [[Wuhua County|Wuhua]], and [[Fengshun]]. Each county has its own special phonological points of interest. For instance, Xingning lacks the codas {{IPA|[-m]}} and {{IPA|[-p]}}. These have merged into {{IPA|[-n]}} and {{IPA|[-t]}}, respectively. Further away from Meixian, the [[Hong Kong]] dialect lacks the {{IPA|[-u-]}} medial, so whereas the Meixian dialect pronounces the character 光 as {{IPA|[kwɔŋ˦]}}, the Hong Kong Hakka dialect pronounces it as {{IPA|[kɔŋ˧]}}, which is similar to the Hakka spoken in neighbouring [[Shenzhen]].

Tones also vary across the dialects of Hakka. The majority of Hakka dialects have six tones. However, there are dialects which have lost all of their [[checked tone]]s (''rusheng''), and the characters originally of this tone class are distributed across the non-''ru'' tones. An example of such a dialect is [[Changting County|Changting]], which is situated in Western Fujian province. Moreover, there is evidence of the retention of an earlier Hakka tone system in the dialects of [[Haifeng]] and [[Lufeng, Guangdong|Lufeng]], situated in coastal southeastern [[Guangdong]] province. They contain a yin-yang splitting in the ''qu'' tone, giving rise to seven tones in all (with yin-yang registers in ''ping'' and ''ru'' tones and a ''shang'' tone).

In [[Taiwan]], there are two main dialects: Sixian and Hailu (alternatively known as Haifeng; Hailu refers to [[Haifeng County]] and [[Lufeng, Guangdong|Lufeng County]]). Most Hakka speakers found in Taiwan originated from these two regions. Sixian speakers come from Jiaying Prefecture ({{zh|t=嘉應}}), mainly from the four counties of Chengxiang (now [[Meixian District]]), Zhengping (now [[Jiaoling]]), [[Xingning, Guangdong|Xingning]] and [[Pingyuan County, Guangdong|Pingyuan]]. Most dialects of [[Taiwanese Hakka]], except Sixian and Dabu, preserved [[postalveolar consonant]]s ({{IPA|[tʃ]}}, {{IPA|[tʃʰ]}}, {{IPA|[ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ]}}), which are uncommon in other southern Chinese varieties.

*[[Zhaoan dialect]] ({{lang|zh|詔安客家話}})

''Ethnologue'' reports the dialects as ''Yue-Tai'' (Meixian, Wuhua, Raoping, Taiwan Kejia: Meizhou above), ''Yuezhong ''(Central Guangdong), ''Huizhou, Yuebei'' (Northern Guangdong), ''Tingzhou'' (Min-Ke), ''Ning-Long'' (Longnan), ''Yugui, Tonggu.''

==Vocabulary==

Like other southern Chinese varieties, Hakka retains single syllable words from earlier stages of Chinese; thus a large number of syllables are distinguished by tone and final consonant. This reduces the need for compounding or making words of more than one syllable. However, it is also similar to other Chinese varieties in having words which are made from more than one syllable.

Hakka, as well as numerous other Chinese varieties such as Min and Cantonese, prefers the verb {{IPA|[kɔŋ˧˩]}} {{linktext|lang=zh-Hant|講}} when referring to ''saying'' rather than the Mandarin {{transl|zh|shuō}} {{linktext|lang=zh-Hant|說}} (Hakka {{IPA|[sɔt˩]}}).

Hakka uses {{IPA|[sit˥]}} {{linktext|lang=zh|食}}, like Cantonese {{IPA|[sɪk˨]}} for the verb "to eat" and {{linktext|lang=zh-Hant|飲}} {{IPA|[jɐm˧˥]}} (Hakka {{IPA|[jim˧˩]}}) for "to drink", unlike Mandarin which prefers {{transl|zh|chī}} {{linktext|lang=zh|吃}} (Hakka {{IPA|[kʰiɛt˩]}}) as "to eat" and ''hē'' {{linktext|lang=zh|喝}} (Hakka {{IPA|[hɔt˩]}}) as "to drink" where the meanings in Hakka are different, ''to stutter'' and ''to be thirsty'' respectively.

==Writing systems==

Various dialects of Hakka have been written in a number of Latin orthographies, largely for religious purposes, since at least the mid-19th century.

The popular ''[[The Little Prince]]'' has also been translated into Hakka (2000), specifically the [[Miaoli County|Miaoli]] dialect of Taiwan (itself a variant of the [[Sixian dialect]]). This also was dual-script, albeit using the [[Tongyong Pinyin]] scheme.

==Media==
[[Hakka TV]] is a state-run, primarily Hakka-language television channel in Taiwan that started in 2003. In mainland China, Meizhou Televisions's Hakka Public Channel ({{zh|labels=no|s=梅州电视台客家公共频道}}) has broadcasts 24 hours a day in Hakka since 2006.<ref>[http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_671dbe910100vbx7.html]</ref>
