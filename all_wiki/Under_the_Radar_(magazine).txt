'''''Under the Radar''''' is an American music [[magazine]] that features interviews with accompanying photo-shoots. Each issue includes opinion and commentary of the [[indie music scene]] as well as reviews of books, DVDs, and albums. The magazine posts web-exclusive interviews and reviews on its website.

Items are reviewed based on a rating system in which each album, book, and DVD receives a rating from 1 to 10. The magazine has been in publication since late 2001 and is issued quarterly, with Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall editions.

The magazine was founded by co-publishers (and husband and wife) Mark Redfern and Wendy Lynch Redfern, who were married on June 2, 2007 and currently run the magazine. Mark is the magazine's Senior Editor and writes many of the magazine's articles. Wendy is the Creative Director and lays out each issue. She is also a [[music photography|music photographer]] and conducts photo-shoots for the magazine, including many of its covers.

==Elliott Smith's last interview==
In 2003, Mark Redfern and writer Marcus Kagler interviewed acclaimed singer/songwriter [[Elliott Smith]] for an ''Under the Radar'' cover story and Wendy Lynch photographed him for the cover. It was the first interview that Smith had done in a couple of years and at the time he was hard at work on his album ''[[From a Basement on the Hill]]''. Elliott Smith took his own life later that year and the ''Under the Radar'' feature ended up being Smith's last ever interview and photo-shoot.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
