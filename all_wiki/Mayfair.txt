'''Mayfair''' is an affluent area in the [[West End of London]] towards the eastern edge of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], in the [[City of Westminster]], between [[Oxford Street]], [[Regent Street]], [[Piccadilly]] and [[Park Lane]]. It is one of the most expensive districts in London and the world.<ref name=ft>{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/936ee878-a12c-11e6-891e-abe238dee8e2 |title=Mayfair: London's most expensive 'village' |first=Hugo |last=Cox |newspaper=Financial Times |date=11 November 2016 |accessdate=31 March 2017}}</ref>

The area was originally part of the manor of [[Eia]] and remained largely rural until the early 18th century. It became well known for the annual "May Fair" that took place from 1686 to 1764 in what is now [[Shepherd Market]]. Over the years, the fair grew increasingly downmarket and unpleasant, and it became a public nuisance. The Grosvenor family (who became [[Duke of Westminster|Dukes of Westminster]]) acquired the land through marriage and began to develop it under the direction of Thomas Barlow. The work included [[Hanover Square, Westminster|Hanover Square]], [[Berkeley Square]] and [[Grosvenor Square]], which were surrounded by high-quality houses, and [[St George's Hanover Square Church]]. 

By the end of the 18th century, most of Mayfair was built on with upper-class housing; unlike some nearby areas of London, it has never lost its affluent status. The decline of the British aristocracy in the early 20th century led to the area becoming more commercial, with many houses converted into offices for corporate headquarters and various [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]]. Mayfair retains a substantial quantity of high-end residential property, upmarket shops and restaurants, and luxury hotels along [[Piccadilly]] and [[Park Lane]]. Its prestigious status has been commemorated by being the most expensive property square on the London ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' board.

==Geography==
[[File:Mayfair_-_map_1.png|thumb|300px|Map of Mayfair]]
Mayfair is in the [[City of Westminster]], and mainly consists of the historical [[Grosvenor Group|Grosvenor]] estate and the [[Albemarle Street|Albemarle]], [[Berkeley Square|Berkeley]], [[Burlington Estate|Burlington]], and [[Curzon Street|Curzon]] estates.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=536}} It is bordered on the west by [[Park Lane]], north by [[Oxford Street]], east by [[Regent Street]], and the south by [[Piccadilly]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=535}} Beyond the bounding roads, to the north is [[Marylebone]], to the east [[Soho]], and to the southwest [[Knightsbridge]] and [[Belgravia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.5050127,-0.1504156,14.75z|title=Mayfair|publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=30 March 2017}}</ref>

==History==

===Early history===
Following analysis of the alignment of Roman roads, it has been speculated that the Romans settled in the area before establishing [[Londinium]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=494}} [[Whitaker's Almanack]] suggested that [[Aulus Plautius]] built a fort here during the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] in AD 43 while waiting for [[Claudius]].<ref name=Almanack>{{cite book|title=Whitaker's Almanack|publisher=Joseph Whitaker|date=1994|chapter=Roman Mayfair|page=1118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htTu86RbfhsC&q=mayfair}}</ref> The theory was developed in 1993, with a proposal that a town grew outside the fort but was later abandoned as being too far from the Thames.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIZnAAAAMAAJ&q=Mayfair|author=Bill Sole|title=Metropolis in Mayfair? |date=1992 |journal=The London Archaeologist |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=122–26}}</ref> The proposal has been disputed because of lack of archaeological evidence.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3UgAQAAIAAJ&q=mayfair |author=John Clark, Harvey Sheldon |pages=104|date=30 November 2008 |title=Londinium and Beyond: Essays on Roman London |publisher=David Brown Book Company |isbn= 978-1-902771-72-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIZnAAAAMAAJ&q=Metropolis+in+Mayfair%3F |author=Nicholas Fuentes |date=1992 |title=The Plautian invasion base |journal=The London Archaeologist |volume=7 |pages=238}}</ref> If there was a fort, it is believed the perimeter would have been where the modern [[Green Street, Mayfair|Green Street]], North Audley Street, Upper Grosvenor Street and Park Lane now are, and that Park Street would have been the main road through the centre.<ref name=Almanack /> This area was the manor of [[Eia]] in the [[Domesday Book]], and owned by [[Geoffrey de Mandeville (11th century)|Geoffrey de Mandeville]] after the [[Norman Conquest]]. It was subsequently given to the Abbey of Westminster, who owned it until 1536 when it was taken over by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].<ref name=sol39_1 />

Mayfair was mainly open fields until development started in the [[Shepherd Market]] area around 1686–88 to accommodate the May Fair that had moved from [[Haymarket, London|Haymarket]] in [[St James's]] because of overcrowding.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=535}} There were some buildings before 1686 – a cottage in Stanhope Row, dating from 1618 was destroyed in [[the Blitz]] in late 1940.<ref>[http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ City of Westminster green plaques] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |date=16 July 2012 }}</ref> A 17th-century [[English Civil War]] fortification established in what is now [[Mount Street, London|Mount Street]] was known as Oliver's Mount by the 18th century.<ref name=sol39_12-13 />

===The May Fair===
The May Fair was held every year at Great Brookfield (which is now part of Curzon Street and Shepherd Market) from 1–14 May.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=535}} It was established during the reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in open fields beyond St. James. The fair was recorded as "Saint James's fayer by Westminster" in 1560. It was postponed in 1603 because of plague, but otherwise continued throughout the 17th century.<ref name=onl /> In 1686, the fair moved to what is now Mayfair.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=535}} By the 18th century, it had attracted showmen, jugglers and fencers and numerous fairground attractions.<ref name=onl>{{cite book|first=Edward|last=Walford|title=Mayfair|work=Old and New London|volume=4|location=London|year=1878|pages=345–359|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol4/pp345-359|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref> Popular attractions included bare-knuckle fighting, [[semolina]] eating contests and women's [[pedestrianism|foot racing]].{{sfn|Moore|2003|pp=284–85}}

By the reign of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], the May Fair had fallen into disrepute and was regarded as a public scandal. The [[George Coventry, 6th Earl of Coventry|6th Earl of Coventry]], who lived on Piccadilly, considered the fair to be a nuisance and, with local residents, led a public campaign against it. It was abolished in 1764.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=535}}<ref name=onl /> One reason for Mayfair's subsequent boom in property development was it was able to keep out lower class activities.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=285}}

===Grosvenor family and estates===
[[File:Grosvenor Square.JPG|thumb|left|[[Grosvenor Square]] is the centrepiece of Mayfair, and named after the Grosvenor family name of the [[Duke of Westminster]].|alt=Historic portrait of Grosvenor Square in Mayfair]]
Building on Mayfair began in the 1660s on the corner of Piccadilly, and progressed along the north side of that street.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=535}} [[Burlington House]] was started between 1664–5 by John Denham and sold two years later to [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington]] who asked Hugh May to complete it. The house was extensively modified through the 18th century, and is the only one of this era to survive into the 21st century.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=116}}

The origins of major development began when [[Sir Thomas Grosvenor, 3rd Baronet]] married Mary Davis, heiress to part of the Manor of [[Ebury]], in 1677.{{sfn|Great Estates|2006|p=14}} The Grosvenor family gained {{convert|500|acre}} of land, of which around {{convert|100|acre}} lay south of Oxford Street and east of Park Lane.{{efn|The remainder was subsequently developed into [[Pimlico]] and [[Belgravia]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=358}}}} The land was referred to as "The Hundred Acres" in early deeds.<ref name=sol39_1>{{cite book|title=The Acquisition of the Estate|work=Survey of London|volume=39, the Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair, Part 1 (General History)|editor=F H W Sheppard|location=London|year=1977|pages=1–5|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol39/pt1/pp1-5|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>

In 1721, the ''[[London Journal]]'' reported "the ground upon which the May Fair formerly was held is marked out for a large square, and several fine streets and houses are to be built upon it".<ref name=onl/> [[Sir Richard Grosvenor, 4th Baronet]] asked the surveyor Thomas Barlow to design the street layout which has survived mostly intact to the present day despite most of the properties being rebuilt.{{sfn|Great Estates|2006|p=14}} Barlow proposed a grid of wide, straight streets, with a large park (now Grosvenor Square) as a centrepiece.<ref name=sol39_12-13>{{cite book|title=The Development of the Estate 1720–1785: Layout|work=Survey of London|volume=39, the Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair, Part 1 (General History)|editor=F H W Sheppard|location=London|year=1977|pages=12–13|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol39/pt1/pp12-13|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref> 

Buildings were constructed in quick succession, and by the mid-18th century the area was covered in houses. Much of the land was owned by seven estates – Burlington, Millfield, [[Conduit Mead Estate|Conduit Mead]], Albemarle Ground, the Berkeley, the Curzon and, most importantly, the Grosvenor. Of the original properties constructed in Mayfair, only the Grosvenor estate survives intact and owned by the same family,{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=536}} who became the [[Duke of Westminster|Dukes of Westminster]] in 1874.<ref name=sol39_1/> [[Chesterfield Street]] is one of the few streets that has 18th-century properties on both sides, with a single exception, and is probably the least altered road in the area.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=161}}

[[File:Statue of Pitt the Younger, Hanover Square W1.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of [[William Pitt the Younger]] in [[Hanover Square, Westminster|Hanover Square]]|alt=Statue of William Pitt, The Younger in Hanover Square, Mayfair]]
[[Hanover Square, Westminster|Hanover Square]] was the first of three great squares to be constructed. It was named after King George I, the Elector of Hanover, soon after his ascension to the throne in 1714. The original houses were inhabited by "persons of distinction" such as retired generals. Although most have been demolished, a small number have survived to the present day. The [[Hanover Square Rooms]] became a popular place for [[classical music]] concerts, including [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Niccolò Paganini]] and [[Franz Liszt]]. A large statue of [[William Pitt the Younger]] is sited at the southern end of the square.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|pp=381–382}}

[[File:St George's Hanover Square by T Malton. 1787.jpg|thumb|left|Looking towards [[St George Hanover Square]] from St George Street, 1787|alt=Historic picture of the church of St George's Hanover Square]]
In 1725, Mayfair became part of the new parish of [[St George Hanover Square]],<ref name=sol39_29-30>{{cite journal|title=The Development of the Estate 1720–1785: Other Features of the Development|journal=Survey of London|volume=39, the Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair, Part 1 (General History)|editor=F H W Sheppard|location=London|year=1977|pages=29–30|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol39/pt1/pp29-30|accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> which stretched as far east as [[Bond Street]] and to Regent Street north of [[Conduit Street]]. It ran as far north as Oxford Street and south near to Piccadilly. The parish continued into Hyde Park to the west and extended southwest to [[St George's Hospital]].<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/crace/other/zoomify88656.html|title=St Georges parish, Hanover Square.

A water supply to the area was built by the Chelsea Water Works, and a royal warrant was issued in 1725 for a reservoir in Hyde Park that could supply water at what is now Grosvenor Gate. In 1835, the reservoir was decorated with an ornamental basin and a fountain in its centre.<ref name=sol39_29-30/> In 1963, following the widening of Park Lane, it was rebuilt as the Joy of Life Fountain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde-park/things-to-see-and-do/memorials,-fountains-and-statues/joy-of-life-fountain|title=Joy of Life Fountain|publisher=Royal Parks|accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref>

Grosvenor Square was planned as the centrepiece of the Mayfair estate. It was laid out around 1725–31 with 51 individual plots for development. It is the second-largest square in London (after [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]]) and housed numerous members of the aristocracy until the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=359}} By the end of the 19th century, the Grosvenor family were described as "the wealthiest family in Europe" and annual rents for their Mayfair properties reached around £135,000 (now £{{inflation|GBP|135000|1891|fmt=c|r=-3}}).{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=358}} The square has never declined in popularity and continues to be a prestigious London address into the 21st century. Only two original houses have survived; No.&nbsp;9, once the home of [[John Adams]], and No.&nbsp;38 which is now the [[Embassy of Indonesia, London|Indonesian Embassy]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=359}} 

[[File:Sophie Snyder Berkeley Square.jpg|thumb|Sculpture ''Hares'' by Sophie Snyder, [[Berkeley Square]]|alt=Photograph of Berkeley Square]]
Berkeley House on Piccadilly was named after [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton]] who had purchased its land, and that surrounding it, shortly after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the Monarchy]] in 1660. In 1696, the Berkeley family sold the house and grounds to the 1st Duke of Devonshire (who renamed it [[Devonshire House]]) on condition that the view from the rear of the house should not be spoiled. Berkeley Square was laid out to the rear of the house in the 1730s; because of the conditions of sale, houses were only built on the east and west sides. The west side still has various mid-18th-century buildings and the east side now contains offices including Berkeley Square House.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=59}}

The expansion of Mayfair moved [[upper class]] Londoners away from areas such as [[Covent Garden]] and Soho, which were already in decline by the 18th century. Part of its success was its proximity to the [[Court of St James]] and the parks, and the well-designed layout. This led to it sustaining its popularity into the 21st century. The requirements of the aristocracy led to stables, coach houses and servants' accommodation being established along the mews running parallel to the streets. Some of the stables have since been converted into garages and offices.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=536}}

The [[Rothschild family]] owned several Mayfair properties in the 19th century. [[Alfred de Rothschild]] lived at No.&nbsp;1 Seamore Place and held numerous "adoration dinners" where the only guest was a female companion. The marriage of his brother [[Leopold de Rothschild|Leopold]] to Marie Perugia took place here in 1881. The house was demolished after World War I when Curzon Street was extended through the site to meet Park Lane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://family.rothschildarchive.org/estates/46-1-seamore-place|title=1, Seamore Place, London, England|publisher=Rothschild Archive|accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref> The future Prime Minister [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]] was born in [[Charles Street, Mayfair]] in 1847, and grew up in the area.<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Robert Rhodes|year=1963|title=Rosebery|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|page=9|isbn=978-1-857-99219-9}}</ref>

Mayfair has had a long association with the United States. [[Pocahontas]] is believed to have visited in the early 17th century. In 1786, John Adams established the US Embassy on Grosvenor Square. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was married in Hanover Square  and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] honeymooned in Berkeley Square.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=288}} A small memorial park in [[Mount Street Gardens]] has benches engraved with the names of former American residents and visitors to Mayfair.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=289}}

===Modern history===
[[File:Embassy of Italy, London.jpg|thumb|250px|The London [[Embassy of Italy, London|Italian Embassy]] is in Mayfair.|alt=Photograph of the front of the Italian Embassy, London]]
The death of [[Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster]] in 1899 was a pivotal point in the development of Mayfair, following which all redevelopment schemes not already in operation were cancelled. In the following years, Government budget proposals such as [[David Lloyd George]]'s establishment of the [[welfare state]] in 1909, greatly reduced the power of the Lords. Land value fell around Mayfair, and some leases were not renewed.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Estate in the Twentieth Century|work=Survey of London|volume=39, the Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair, Part 1 (General History)|editor=F H W Sheppard|location=London|year=1977|pages=67–82|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol39/pt1/pp67-82|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>

Following [[World War I]], the British upper class was in decline as the reduced workforce meant servants were less in supply and demanded higher salaries. The grandest houses in Mayfair became more expensive to service and consequently many were converted to foreign embassies. The [[Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster|2nd Duke of Westminster]] decided to demolish Grosvenor House and build [[Bourdon House]] in its place. Mayfair attracted commercial development after much of the [[City of London]] was destroyed during the Blitz, and many corporate headquarters were established in the area.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=536}} Several historically important houses were demolished, including [[Aldford House]], [[Londonderry House]] and [[Chesterfield House, Westminster|Chesterfield House]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/investment/10836954/How-did-Mayfair-become-Londons-most-desirable-area.html|title=How did Mayfair become London's most desirable area?|first=Christopher|last=Middleton|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=20 May 2014|accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref>

===Churches===
[[File:Saint George Church, Hanover Square.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St George's, Hanover Square]]|alt=Photograph of the front of St George's Hanover Square]]
[[St George's, Hanover Square]], constructed between 1721–24 by [[John James (architect)|John James]], was one of 50 churches built following the [[Commission for Building Fifty New Churches]] Act in 1711. It has a [[portico]], the first to be constructed for a British church. [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]] in 1791, poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] in 1814, and Prime Ministers [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[H. H. Asquith]] in 1839 and 1894 respectively were all married in the church. The porch houses two cast-iron dogs rescued from a shop in [[Conduit Street]] that was bombed during the Blitz.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=759}}

Grosvenor Chapel on [[South Audley Street]] was built by Benjamin Timbrell in 1730 for the Grosvenor Estate. It was used by American armed forces during World War II. The parents of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] are buried in the churchyard.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=358}}

The Mayfair Chapel on Curzon Street was a popular place for illegal marriages, including over 700 in 1742. [[James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton]] married [[Elizabeth Gunning, 1st Baroness Hamilton of Hameldon|Elizabeth Gunning]] here in 1752. The [[Marriage Act 1753]] stopped the practice of unlicensed marriages. The chapel was demolished in 1899.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=228}}

[[Claridge's]] was founded in 1812 as Mivart's Hotel on Brook Street. It was acquired by William Claridge in 1855, who gave it its current name. The hotel was bought by the Savoy Company in 1895 and rebuilt in red brick. It was extended again in 1931. Several European royal families in exile stayed at the hotel during World War II. [[Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia]] was born there on 17 July 1945; the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] is said to have declared the suite he was born in to be Yugoslav territory.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=192}}

The [[Grosvenor House Hotel]] on Park Lane is on the former site of [[Grosvenor House]], the home of Robert Grosvenor, 2nd Earl Grosvenor (later [[Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster]]). It was built by [[Arthur Octavius Edwards]] in the 1920s and has over 450 bedrooms, with 150 luxury flats in the south wing. It was the first London hotel to have a swimming pool.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|pp=358–9}}

[[The Dorchester]] is named after [[Joseph Damer, 1st Earl of Dorchester]]. The first building here was erected by Joseph Damer in 1751, and renamed Dorchester House following the Earl's succession in 1792. The property was purchased by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons and Gordon Hotels Ltd in 1928 to be converted into a hotel, which opened on 18 April 1931. It was General [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s London headquarters in World War II. The [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] held his [[stag night]] at the hotel prior to his marriage to [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=244}}

Mayfair has had a range of exclusive shops, hotels, restaurants and clubs since the 19th century. The quarter—especially the Bond Street area—is also the home of numerous commercial art galleries and international auction houses such as [[Bonhams]], [[Christie's]] and [[Sotheby's]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=537}}

[[Gunter's Tea Shop]] was established in 1757 at Nos.&nbsp;7–8 Berkeley Square by the Italian Domenico Negri. Robert Gunter took co-ownership of the shop in 1777, and full ownership in 1799. During the 19th century it became a fashionable place to buy cakes and ice cream, and was well known for its range of multi-tiered [[wedding cake]]s. The shop moved to Curzon Street in 1936 when the eastern side of Berkley Square was demolished, until closing in 1956. The business as a whole survived until the late 1970s.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=365}}

[[File:Burlington Arcade, shops - clean.jpg|thumb|The [[Burlington Arcade]] opened in 1819.|alt=View of Burlington arcade, with shoppers]]
Mount Street has been a popular shopping street since Mayfair was developed in the 18th century. It was largely rebuilt between 1880 and 1900 under the direction of the 1st Duke of Westminster, when the nearby workhouse was relocated to Pimlico. It now houses a number of shops dealing with luxury trades.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=563}}

Shepherd Market has been called the "village centre" of Mayfair. The current buildings date from around 1860 and house food and antique shops, pubs and restaurants. The market had a reputation for high-class prostitution. In the 1980s, [[Jeffrey Archer]] was alleged to frequent the area and was accused of visiting [[Monica Coghlan]], a call girl in Shepherd Market, which eventually led to a libel trial and his imprisonment for perverting the course of justice.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=834}}

Alongside Burlington House is one of London's most luxurious shopping areas, the [[Burlington Arcade]]. It was designed by Samuel Ware for [[George Cavendish, 1st Earl of Burlington]] in 1819. The arcade was designed with tall walls on either side to stop passers by throwing litter into the Earl's garden. Ownership of the arcade passed to the [[Baron Chesham|Chesham family]]. In 1911, another storey was added by [[Beresford Pite]], who also added the Chesham arms. The family sold the arcade to the [[Prudential Assurance Company]] for £333,000 (now £{{inflation|GBP|333000|1926|fmt=c|r=-3}}) in 1926. It was bombed during World War II and subsequently restored.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=115}}
