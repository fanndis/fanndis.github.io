The '''National Museum and Research Center of Altamira''' ({{lang-es|'''Museo Nacional y Centro de Investigación de Altamira'''}}) is a center dedicated to the conservation of, research into and the sharing of information about the [[cave of Altamira]] in [[Santillana del Mar]] ([[Cantabria]], [[Spain]]), named a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[Unesco]].

The museum offers prehistoric technology workshops to visitors, as well as a permanent exhibition called ''Times of Altamira'', which contains objects from Altamira as well as those from other palaeolithic [[caves of Cantabria]] such as ''El Morín'', ''El Juyo'' and ''El Rascaño''. The New Altamira Cave, or ''[[Neocave]]'', is also part of this exhibition: an artificial replica of the original caves, built in order to preserve the originals from damage arising from a massive influx of visitors.
