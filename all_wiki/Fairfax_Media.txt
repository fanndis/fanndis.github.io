'''Fairfax Media''' was a [[media (communication)|media]] company in Australia and New Zealand, with investments in newspaper, magazines, radio and digital properties. The company was founded by [[John Fairfax]] as '''John Fairfax and Sons''', who purchased ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' in 1841. The Fairfax family retained control of the business until late in the 20th century.

The company also owned several regional and national Australian newspapers, including ''[[The Age]]'', ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'' and ''[[Canberra Times]]'', majority stakes in property business [[Domain Group]] and the [[Macquarie Radio Network]], and joint ventures in streaming service [[Stan (company)|Stan]] and online publisher [[HuffPost|HuffPost Australia]].

The group's last chairman was Nick Falloon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfaxmedia.com.au/pressroom/au---nz-press-room/au---nz-press-room/nick-falloon-confirmed-as-chairman-upon-the-retirement-of-roger-corbett|title=Nick Falloon confirmed as Chairman upon the retirement of Roger Corbett|work=fairfaxmedia.com.au|accessdate=16 September 2015}}</ref> and the chief executive officer was [[Greg Hywood]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Lee |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/fairfax-chief-executive-quits-20101206-18md9.html |title=Fairfax chief executive quits |work=Brisbane Times |location=Australia |accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref>

On 26 July 2018, Fairfax Media and [[Nine Entertainment Co.]] announced it had agreed on terms for a merger between the two companies to become Australia's largest media company. Shareholders in Nine Entertainment Co. took a 51% of the combined entity and Fairfax shareholders own 49%. Fairfax Media was delisted from the [[Australian Securities Exchange]] in December 2018. Its metro publishing assets continue to be published by the group as [[Nine Publishing]]. Many of its other assets, such as its community media holdings (i.e. [[Australian Community Media]]) and its events arm are set to be sold off to other entities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

==History==
[[File:Fairfax Media, Pyrmont, NSW.jpg|thumb|Fairfax Media headquarters in [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]]]]
[[John Fairfax]] purchased ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' in 1841.<ref name="Herald history"/> Several generations of the Fairfax family continued to control the company. Fairfax Media was founded by the Fairfax family as John Fairfax and Sons, later to become John Fairfax Holdings. The Fairfax family lost control of the company in December 1990. It was renamed from John Fairfax Holdings to Fairfax Media in 2007.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===1950s to 1999 ===
''[[The Australian Financial Review]]'' was founded in 1951. In that decade, Fairfax started two television stations, [[ATN]] and [[QTQ]]. Fairfax began expanding in the 1960s, acquiring, among others, ''[[The Age]]'', ''[[The Newcastle Herald]]'' and the ''[[Illawarra Mercury]]''. In 1979, [[Rupert Murdoch]] attempted to take over rival [[The Herald and Weekly Times]]. Due to the costs of defending the takeover, Fairfax sold its television properties, including the [[Seven Network]]. In 1988, Fairfax sold its magazines (including ''[[Woman's Day (Australian magazine)|Woman's Day]]'', ''[[People (Australian magazine)|People]]'', ''[[Dolly (magazine)|Dolly]]'', and ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'') to [[ACP Magazines|Australian Consolidated Press]], and discontinued its Sydney afternoon tabloid ''[[The Sun (Australia)|The Sun]]'', transferring some of its content and the sponsorship of the ''[[City2Surf (Sydney)|City to Surf]]'' to its new Sunday tabloid ''[[The Sun-Herald]]'' which also replaced the broadsheet ''Sunday Herald''.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1987, [[Warwick Fairfax]], then aged 26,  bought out his family's holdings in the company using borrowed debts. He successfully took it over, selling some properties to his half-brother John B. Fairfax, who formed [[Rural Press]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Rural Press Ltd. {{!}} Encyclopedia.com| accessdate = 2019-06-09| url = https://www.encyclopedia.com/books/politics-and-business-magazines/rural-press-ltd}}</ref> On 10 December 1990, the company collapsed and a [[receivership|receiver]] was appointed,<ref name="The Econ">{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/147869 |title=Let battle commence |work=The Economist |date=24 April 1997 |accessdate=12 November 2011 }}</ref> with company debts of A$1.7&nbsp;billion.<ref name="Herald history">{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldeducation.com.au/content/history/gjful4 |title=History of the Sydney Morning Herald |website=The Sydney Morning Herald |year=2011 |accessdate=12 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410020444/http://www.heraldeducation.com.au/content/history/gjful4|archivedate=10 April 2013 }}</ref> By 1993, the company was re-listed on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]] and the two biggest shareholders of John Fairfax Holdings were the Canadian newspaper magnate [[Conrad Black]] and his Hollinger Group with 25%, and the Australian media mogul, [[Kerry Packer]] and his [[listed company|publicly listed]] company, [[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited]] with 15%.

===2000 to 2009===
In 2003, Fairfax acquired many of New Zealand's highest-profile newspapers when it bought the publishing assets of that country's [[Independent Newspapers|Independent Newspapers Limited]], whose cornerstone shareholder was [[News Corp Australia]]. {{anchor|RSVP}}In July 2005, Fairfax acquired the RSVP dating site for A$38&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/business/fairfax-buys-online-dating-service/2005/07/11/1120934155856.html');return%20false; |work= The Sydney Morning Herald |title=Fairfax buys online dating service |date=11 July 2005 |accessdate=6 January 2011}}</ref> In August 2005, Fairfax's general classifieds site created in March 2004, Cracker.com.au consistently exceeded 500,000 unique visitors a month.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In December 2005, Fairfax acquired Stayz Pty Ltd<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stayz.com.au/about-us |title=Stayz Holiday Accommodation&nbsp;– Holiday Rentals |work=Stayz  |accessdate =13 November 2010}}</ref> for A$12.7&nbsp;million.<ref name="Stayz">{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/fairfax-sells-stayz-accommodation-website-for-220m-to-homeaway-20131204-2yr41.html |title=Fairfax sells Stayz accommodation website for $220m to HomeAway |last1=Johnston |first1=Eric |date=5 December 2013 |website=The Age  |accessdate=5 December 2013 |location=Melbourne}}</ref> This investment proved to be very successful as Stayz was sold on 27 November 2013, for $220 million, far exceeding its estimated net debt of $154 million.<ref name="Stayz" /> In September 2007, Fairfax acquired online funds management business, InvestSMART, from founders Ron Hodge and Nigel Poole for A$12M.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/technology/fairfax-buys-online-fund-management-site-20070911-genrqb.html|title=Fairfax buys online fund management site|last=Steffens|first=Miriam|date=2007-09-11|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref><ref>https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/fairfax-buys-investsmart-for-12m/news-story/68708926dd7c035a3572b92ff26e056d</ref> In August 2013, Fairfax sold the InvestSMART business to Australasian Wealth Investments Limited, now called InvestSMART Group Limited,<ref>https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20160518/pdf/437b8sfzdkpnf2.pdf</ref>  for A$7M.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/fairfax-sells-investsmart-for-7m-after-buying-it-for-12m-172666|title=Fairfax sells InvestSmart for $7m, after buying it for $12m|last=Burrowes|first=Tim|date=2013-08-13|website=Mumbrella|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moneymanagement.com.au/news/financial-planning/fairfax-exits-investsmart|title=Fairfax exits InvestSMART {{!}} Money Management|date=2013-08-12|website=www.moneymanagement.com.au|language=en|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>

In August 2005, Fairfax ended its 16-month search for a new chief executive officer with [[David Kirk]], a former [[Rugby Union World Cup]] winning captain of the New Zealand [[All Blacks]] being appointed to replace departing CEO [[Fred Hilmer]]. David Kirk got the job ahead of Fairfax COO Brian Evans (former head of Fairfax New Zealand) and [[Doug Flynn]], who took the top job at UK Pest control company [[Rentokil]] after negotiations with Fairfax broke off. In March 2006, Fairfax acquired New Zealand auction website Trademe.co.nz for NZ$700&nbsp;million.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} On 4 March 2006, it was announced that Fairfax would purchase ''[[The Border Mail]]'' newspaper in [[Albury-Wodonga]] for A$162&nbsp;million. In October 2006, speculation began to grow that the company would be bought out and split up after the passage of changes to Australian media laws. Rival media company [[News Corp Australia]] purchased a 7.5 per cent stake in the company at this time,<ref>[https://www.ft.com/content/9fdef7da-5fef-11db-a011-0000779e2340 News Corp buys 7.5% of Australia’s Fairfax], ''[[Financial Times]]'', October 20, 2006</ref> This was with the stated aim of keeping Fairfax in one piece.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

On 7 December 2006, John Fairfax Holdings and [[Rural Press]] announced the beginning of their merger proceedings. Once merged, the new entity formed a publishing company worth A$9&nbsp;billion and resulted in regaining control of ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' (which it owned in the 1980s), and through John B. Fairfax of Rural Press, saw the return of the Fairfax family to the company board. The company also gained a number of other regional newspapers, radio stations and websites; plus agricultural publications in various countries.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} On 12 January 2007, John Fairfax Holdings changed its name to Fairfax Media.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asx.com.au/asx/statistics/getAnnPdf('/asx/statistics/showAnnouncementPDF.do?idsID=',%20'00684874',%20'Announcement');return%20false;  |title=Fairfax Name Change |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2007}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On 7 March 2007, Fairfax Media announced a new website for Brisbane, called the ''[[Brisbane Times]]''. The website initially employed 14 journalists and was an attempt by Fairfax to break into the South East Queensland market.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} On 20 March 2007 Fairfax Media launched a new business website, BusinessDay.com.au that aggregated feeds from the other news vehicles in the Fairfax stable as well as "from the world's most respected news sources". It featured breaking news updated "every 15 minutes".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Also in 2007 Fairfax Media bought the radio assets of [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]]. Macquarie Media Group purchased Southern Cross for A$1.35&nbsp;billion and onsold these assets to the Fairfax Group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/03/1968580.htm |title=Southern Cross Broadcasting sold for $1.35b |accessdate=3 June 2007 |date=3 June 2007 |work=ABC News |location=Australia }}</ref>

On 26 August 2007, Kirk and Deputy CEO Brian McCarthy announced that 550 staff would be cut as part of a "business improvement" programme. The staff reductions would take place in both Australia and New Zealand, with the latter country bearing the brunt of the cuts, with 160 full-time employees losing their jobs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24243142-13480,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902000039/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24243142-13480,00.html |url-status = dead|archive-date=2 September 2008 |title=Fairfax email to staff about job cuts |accessdate=26 August 2008 |work=The Australian |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 5 December, David Kirk tendered his resignation, and on 10 December Brian McCarthy (former Rural Press CEO) was appointed as CEO.

As of May 2008 Fairfax Media had a market capitalisation of over A$5 billion.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The number of printed edition readers has fallen since at least 2006 and the group's stock price has declined by more than 60 percent since 2007, to less than A$2 billion by September 2011, and by 85 percent at June 2012.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

On 11 July 2007, Fairfax Media acquired the former radio assets of Southern Cross Broadcasting (on-sold from Macquarie Media Group's purchase of SCB): [[2UE]] Sydney, [[3AW]] and [[3EE|Magic 1278]] Melbourne, 4BC and [[4BH]] Brisbane, and [[6PR]] and [[6NOW|96fm]] Perth. Graham Mott will continue in his role as general manager of the broadcast radio group under Fairfax. Mott indicated at the time of the acquisition that national syndication of programming (such as that of the since-retired [[John Laws]]) would largely be replaced on the network with more localised syndication at a state level.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tabakoff |first=Nick |date=7 November 2007 |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22716245-7582,00.html |title=Fairfax to axe syndicated programs |work=The Australian |publisher=News |accessdate=12 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109003404/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22716245-7582,00.html |archive-date=9 November 2007 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===2010 to 2013===
In late 2011, John B. Fairfax and his family investment company, Marinya Media, sold their remaining 9.7&nbsp;percent stake in Fairfax Media for A$189&nbsp;million. The sale came after an earlier dispute between John B. Fairfax and [[Ron Walker (Australian businessman)|Ron Walker]], Chairman of the Board of Fairfax Media, which led to the very public departure of Walker. Continued poor performance of Fairfax Media in light of changing news services was cited as one of the reasons for the sale of Marinya Media's interests in Fairfax. John B. Fairfax had earlier stood down from the Fairfax board, and his son, Nick Fairfax, was reported to be discussing his future with the rest of the company board.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessspectator.com.au/bs.nsf/Article/John-B-Fairfax-Nicholas-Marinya-media-stake-share--pd20111110-NGARM?OpenDocument&src=mp |title=Fairfax ends the romance |last =Bartholomeusz | first = Stephen |work=Business Spectator |date=10 November 2011 |accessdate=12 November 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/end-of-an-era-as-fairfax-family-calls-it-quits-20111110-1n9fk.html |title=End of an era as Fairfax family calls it quits |last=Dick |first=Tim |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=11 November 2011 |accessdate=12 November 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://afr.com/rw/2009-2014/AFR/2011/11/10/Photos/7a200166-0b6f-11e1-88ea-6d846017b615_Marinya%20Press%20Release_10NOV2011.pdf |title=Marinya Media divests ownership of Fairfax Media |date=10 November 2011 |work=The Australian Financial Review |accessdate=12 November 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/media/questions-over-timing-of-fairfaxs-volatile-farewell/story-e6frg996-1226193158502 |title=Questions over timing of Fairfax's volatile farewell |last1=Jackson |first1=Sally |last2=Kitney |first2=Damon |date=12 November 2011 |work=The Australian |accessdate=12 November 2011 }}</ref>

In 2012, mining billionaire [[Gina Rinehart]] (the wealthiest person in Australia) became Fairfax's biggest shareholder, purchasing a 14&nbsp;percent stake in the company. Rinehart also sought a position on the Fairfax board.<ref>{{cite news |author=Walters, Kath |title=Rinehart's pitch for Fairfax board: why it's going wrong |publisher=Leading Company |date=17 May 2012 }}</ref> By June 2012, Rinehart had increased her stake in Fairfax Media to 18.67&nbsp;percent, and was believed to seek three board seats and involvement in editorial decisions.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/rinehart-steps-up-fairfax-board-battle-20120618-20jem.html |title=Rinehart steps up Fairfax board battle |author=Simpson, Kirsty |date=18 June 2012 |accessdate=18 June 2012 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald }}</ref> There were reports that Rinehart sought to increase her total share to 19.99%, the maximum allowed before a takeover offer must be made. But provisions in Fairfax Media's insurance policy denied cover for directors owning more than 15%, so Rinehart had to sell down to 14.99%. Rinehart was denied a place on the board because she would not agree to Fairfax's charter of independence, and sold her stake in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gina Rinehart sells out of Fairfax Media |url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/gina-rinehart-sells-out-of-fairfax-media-20150206-138b5i.html|website=smh|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=6 February 2015}}</ref>

On 18 June 2012, as part of evolving to a sustainable model for its news media business, Fairfax Media announced it would cut 1,900 staff and begin to erect digital paywalls around its two main metropolitan news brands, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' and ''The Age''. It also announced it was shifting to "compact" or tabloid-sized editions of the broadsheet newspapers from March 2013, and that its two printing facilities at Chullora and Tullamarine would close. The changes, prompted by shrinking advertising revenue, were expected to generate A$235 million in annual savings over three years.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 2012, Fairfax Media acquired Netus Pty Ltd, a technology investment company which owned 85% of Allure Media, and purchased the remaining 15% from minority shareholders.
