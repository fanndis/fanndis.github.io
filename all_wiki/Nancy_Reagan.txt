'''Nancy Davis Reagan''' (born '''Anne Frances Robbins'''; July 6, 1921&nbsp;– March 6, 2016) was an American film actress and the second wife of [[Ronald Reagan]], the 40th [[president of the United States]]. She was the [[First Lady of the United States|first lady of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989.

She was born in New York City. After her parents separated, she lived in [[Maryland]] with an aunt and uncle for six years. When her mother remarried in 1929, she moved to Chicago and later was adopted by her mother's second husband. As '''Nancy Davis''', she was a Hollywood actress in the 1940s and 1950s, starring in films such as ''[[The Next Voice You Hear...]]'', ''[[Night into Morning]]'', and ''[[Donovan's Brain (film)|Donovan's Brain]]''. In 1952, she married Ronald Reagan, who was then president of the [[Screen Actors Guild]]. They had two children together. Reagan was the first lady of California when her husband was [[Governor of California|governor]] from 1967 to 1975, and she began to work with the [[Foster Grandparents Program]].

Reagan became First Lady of the United States in January 1981, following her husband's victory in the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]]. Early in his first term, she was criticized largely due to her decision to replace the [[White House china]], which had been paid for by private donations. She championed [[recreational drug use|recreational drug prevention]] causes when she founded the "[[Just Say No]]" drug awareness campaign, which was considered her major initiative as First Lady. More discussion of her role ensued following a 1988 revelation that she had consulted an [[astrology|astrologer]] to assist in planning the president's schedule after the [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|attempted assassination of her husband in 1981]]. She generally had a strong influence on her husband and played a role in a few of his personnel and diplomatic decisions.

After Ronald Reagan's term as president ended, the couple returned to their home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Nancy devoted most of her time to caring for her husband, who was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] in 1994, until [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|his death]] at the age of 93 on June 5, 2004. Reagan remained active within the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library|Reagan Library]] and in politics, particularly in support of [[embryonic stem cell research]], until her death from [[congestive heart failure]] at age 94 on March 6, 2016.

[[File:Publicity Shot of Nancy Davis.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Davis, {{circa}} 1949–50]]
In 1940, a young Davis had appeared as a [[National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis]] volunteer in a memorable short subject film shown in movie theaters to raise donations for the crusade against [[Poliomyelitis|polio]]. ''The Crippler'' featured a sinister figure spreading over playgrounds and farms, laughing over its victims, until finally dispelled by the volunteer. It was very effective in raising contributions.<ref>{{cite book |last= Oshinsky |first= David M. |title= Polio: An American Story |year= 2005 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York |page= [https://archive.org/details/polioamericansto00oshi/page/68 68] |quote=  |url= https://archive.org/details/polioamericansto00oshi/page/68 |isbn= 978-0-19-515294-4 }}</ref>

Following her graduation from college, Davis held jobs in Chicago as a sales clerk in [[Marshall Field's]] department store and as a nurse's aide.<ref name="First Lady Nancy Reagan" /> With the help of her mother's colleagues in theatre, including [[ZaSu Pitts]], [[Walter Huston]], and [[Spencer Tracy]],<ref name="nyt-lw" /> she pursued a professional career as an actress. She first gained a part in Pitts' 1945 road tour of ''Ramshackle Inn'',<ref name="Nancy Reagan: Her Life & Times" /><ref name="First Lady Nancy Reagan" /> moving to New York City.

Davis' film career began with small supporting roles in two films that were released in 1949, ''[[The Doctor and the Girl]]'' with [[Glenn Ford]] and ''[[East Side, West Side (1949 film)|East Side, West Side]]'' starring [[Barbara Stanwyck]].<ref name="The Films of Nancy Reagan" /> She played a [[Child and adolescent psychiatry|child psychiatrist]] in the [[film noir]] ''[[Shadow on the Wall (film)|Shadow on the Wall]]'' (1950) with [[Ann Sothern]] and [[Zachary Scott]]; her performance was called "beautiful and convincing" by ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic A.

[[File:Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan aboard a boat in California 1964.jpg|thumb|right|Nancy and Ronald Reagan aboard a boat, 1964]]

Author [[Garry Wills]] has said that Davis was generally underrated as an actress because her constrained part in ''Hellcats'' was her most widely seen performance.<ref name="cannon-gov" /> In addition, Davis downplayed her Hollywood goals: promotional material from MGM in 1949 said that her "greatest ambition" was to have a "successful happy marriage"; decades later, in 1975, she would say, "I was never really a career woman but [became one] only because I hadn't found the man I wanted to marry. I couldn't sit around and do nothing, so I became an actress."<ref name="cannon-gov" /> Ronald Reagan biographer [[Lou Cannon]] nevertheless characterized her as a "reliable" and "solid" performer who held her own in performances with better-known actors.<ref name="cannon-gov" /> After her final film, ''[[Crash Landing (1958 film)|Crash Landing]]'' (1958), Davis appeared for a brief time as a guest star in television dramas, such as the ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre|Zane Grey Theatre]]'' episode "The Long Shadow" (1961), where she played opposite Ronald Reagan, as well as ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[The Tall Man (TV series)|The Tall Man]]'', until she retired as an actress in 1962.<ref name="The Films of Nancy Reagan">{{cite web |url= http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/films.asp |title= Nancy Reagan > Her Films |accessdate=March 8, 2007 |publisher= Ronald Reagan Foundation|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070812232914/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/films.asp |archivedate = August 12, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During her career, Davis served for nearly ten years on the board of directors of the [[Screen Actors Guild]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sag.org/ronald-reagan|title= Screen Actors Guild Presidents |accessdate=March 8, 2007 |publisher= Screen Actors Guild}}</ref> Decades later, [[Albert Brooks]] attempted to coax her out of acting retirement by offering her the title role opposite himself in his 1996 film ''[[Mother (1996 film)|Mother]]''.<ref name="peo012797" /> She declined in order to care for her husband, and Debbie Reynolds played the part.<ref name="peo012797">{{cite news|url=http://www.albertbrooks.com/1997/01/to-the-top/ |title=To The Top |author=Lambert, Pat |magazine=[[People (American magazine)|People]] |date=January 27, 1997 |accessdate=January 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707005647/http://www.albertbrooks.com/1997/01/to-the-top/ |archivedate=July 7, 2012 }}</ref>

During her Hollywood career, Davis dated many actors, including [[Clark Gable]], [[Robert Stack]], and [[Peter Lawford]];<ref name="metzger-33" /> she later called Gable the nicest of the stars she had met.<ref name="nyt-lw" /> On November 15, 1949, she met Ronald Reagan,<ref name="cannon-gov-77">Cannon, Lou (2003), pp. 77–78.</ref> who was then president of the Screen Actors Guild. She had noticed that her name had appeared on the [[Hollywood blacklist]]. Davis sought Reagan's help to maintain her employment as a guild actress in Hollywood and for assistance in having her name removed from the list.<ref name="nyt-lw" /> Ronald Reagan informed her that she had been confused with another actress of the same name.<ref name="nyt-lw" /> The two began dating and their relationship was the subject of many gossip columns; one Hollywood press account described their nightclub-free times together as "the romance of a couple who have no vices".<ref name="cannon-gov-77" /> Ronald Reagan was skeptical about marriage, however, following his painful 1949 divorce from [[Jane Wyman]], and he still saw other women.<ref name="cannon-gov-77" />

After three years of dating, they eventually decided to marry while discussing the issue in the couple's favorite booth at [[Chasen's]], a restaurant in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]].<ref name="cannon-gov-77" /> The couple wed on March 4, 1952, at the Little Brown Church in the [[San Fernando Valley]] of Los Angeles, in a simple and hastily arranged ceremony designed to avoid the press; the marriage was her first and his second.<ref name="Little Brown Church in the Valley">{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/golf/sns-ap-reagan-places,0,1844441.story?page=2 |title=Noteworthy places in Reagan's life |accessdate=April 11, 2007 |date=June 5, 2004 |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930022232/http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/golf/sns-ap-reagan-places%2C0%2C1844441.story?page=2 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> The only people in attendance were fellow actor [[William Holden]] (the best man) and his wife, actress [[Brenda Marshall]] (the matron of honor).<ref name="cannon-gov-77" /><ref name="First Ladies: Nancy Reagan">{{cite web |url= https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/1600/first-ladies/nancyreagan |title= First Ladies: Nancy Reagan |accessdate=March 8, 2007 |publisher= The White House}}</ref> Nancy was likely already pregnant during the ceremony; the couple's first child, Patricia Ann Reagan (later better known by her professional name, [[Patti Davis]]), was born less than eight months later on October 21, 1952.

Nancy's relationship with her children was not always as close as the bond with her husband. She frequently quarreled with her children and her stepchildren. Her relationship with Patti was the most contentious; Patti flouted [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]], rebelled against her parents by joining the [[Nuclear disarmament|nuclear freeze]] movement, and authored many anti-Reagan books.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reagan/peopleevents/pande05.html|title=The Reagan Children|last=Wolf|first=Julie|accessdate=October 17, 2007|year=2000|publisher=PBS|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110040116/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reagan/peopleevents/pande05.html|archivedate=November 10, 2007}}</ref> The nearly 20 years of family feuding left Patti very much estranged from both her mother and father.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6478080|title=Reagan daughter shares her story|author=Couric, Katie|accessdate=June 4, 2009|date=November 14, 2004|publisher=NBC News}}</ref> Soon after her father's Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed, Patti and her mother reconciled and began to speak on a daily basis.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/27/sunday/main4898395.shtml?source=RSS&attr=_4898395|date=March 27, 2009|accessdate=June 4, 2009|title=Road To A Reconciliation|publisher=CBS}}</ref> Nancy's disagreements with Michael were also public matters; in 1984, she was quoted as saying that the two were in an "estrangement right now".

== First Lady of California ==
[[File:Nancy Reagan as First Lady of California.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Reagan as the first lady of California]]
Nancy Reagan was First Lady of California during her husband's two terms as governor.

== Role in 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns ==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1976|United States presidential election, 1980}}
Governor Reagan's gubernatorial time in office ended in 1975, and he did not run for a third term; instead, he met with advisors to discuss a possible bid for the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] presidency, challenging incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]]. Ronald still needed to convince a reluctant Nancy before running, however.<ref>Benze, James G. (2005), p. 32.</ref> She feared for her husband's health and his career as a whole, though she felt that he was the right man for the job and eventually approved.<ref name="lpm64">Loizeau, P.M. (2004), p. 64.</ref> Nancy took on a traditional role in the campaign, holding coffees, luncheons, and talks.<ref name="lpm64" /> She also oversaw personnel, monitored her husband's schedule, and occasionally provided press conferences.<ref name="Benze, James G., Jr. (2005), p. 33" /> The 1976 campaign included the so-called "battle of the queens", contrasting Nancy with First Lady [[Betty Ford]]. They both spoke out over the course of the campaign on similar issues, but with different approaches.<ref>Loizeau, P.M. (2004), p. 65.</ref> Nancy was upset by the warmonger image that the Ford campaign had drawn of her husband.<ref name="lpm64" />

Though he lost the 1976 Republican nomination, Ronald Reagan ran for the presidency a second time in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]]. He succeeded in winning the nomination and defeated incumbent rival [[Jimmy Carter]] in a landslide. During this second campaign, Nancy played a prominent role, and her management of staff became more apparent.<ref name="Benze, James G., Jr. (2005), p. 33">Benze, James G., Jr. (2005), p. 33.</ref> She organized a meeting among feuding campaign managers [[John Sears (political strategist)|John Sears]] and [[Michael Deaver]] and her husband, which resulted in Deaver leaving the campaign and Sears being given full control. After the Reagan camp lost the [[Iowa caucuses|Iowa Caucus]] and fell behind in [[New Hampshire primary|New Hampshire]] polls, Nancy organized a second meeting and decided it was time to fire Sears and his associates; she gave Sears a copy of the press release announcing his dismissal.<ref name="Benze, James G., Jr. (2005), p. 33" /> Her influence on her husband became particularly notable; her presence at rallies, luncheons, and receptions increased his confidence.<ref>Loizeau, P.M. (2004), p. 69.</ref>

Reagan became the first lady of the United States when Ronald Reagan was [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|inaugurated as president in January 1981]]. Early in her husband's presidency, Reagan stated her desire to create a more suitable "first home" in the [[White House]], as the building had fallen into a state of disrepair following years of neglect.<ref name="NR American" /> White House aide [[Michael Deaver]] described the second and third floor family residence as having "cracked plaster walls, chipped paint [and] beaten up floors";<ref name="md78">Deaver, Michael (2004), p. 78.</ref> rather than use government funds to renovate and redecorate, she sought private donations.<ref name="First Lady Nancy Reagan">{{cite web |url= http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=41 |title=First Lady Biography: Nancy Reagan|accessdate=June 2, 2007|publisher= National First Ladies Library}}</ref> In 1981, Reagan directed a major renovation of several White House rooms, including all of the second and third floors<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_timelines/timelines_first-ladies-40.html |title=Nancy Reagan |publisher=The White House Historical Association |accessdate=January 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122104900/http://whitehousehistory.org/whha_timelines/timelines_first-ladies-40.html |archivedate=November 22, 2011 }}</ref> and rooms adjacent to the Oval Office, including the [[James S.

The extensive redecoration was paid for by private donations.<ref name="First Lady Nancy Reagan" /><ref name="graber" /> Many significant and long-lasting changes occurred as a result of the renovation and refurbishment, of which Reagan said, "This house belongs to all Americans, and I want it to be something of which they can be proud."<ref name="graber" /> The renovations received some criticisms for being funded by tax-deductible donations, meaning some of it eventually did indirectly come from the tax-paying public.<ref>Loizeau, P.M.

==== Fashion ====
Reagan's interest in fashion was another one of her trademarks. While her husband was still [[President-elect of the United States|president-elect]], press reports speculated about Reagan's social life and interest in fashion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2GFQAAAAIBAJ&pg=6976,3582744|title=Nancy Reagan To Run The White House In Grand Style, Social Pundits Say|date=November 13, 1980|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=St. Petersburg Independent|page=5A}}</ref><ref name="stylenyt">{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/11/09/111811929.pdf|title=Word From Friends: A New White House Style Is on the Way|date=November 9, 1980|author=Nemy, Enid|newspaper=The New York Times|page=80}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XlANAAAAIBAJ&dq=nancy%20reagan%20fashion&pg=5805%2C4581550|title=Fashion Designers Look Ahead to '81|date=December 23, 1980|author=Proven, Grace|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=18}}</ref> In many press accounts, Reagan's sense of style was favorably compared to that of a previous first lady, [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]].<ref name="burns-148">Burns, Lisa (2008), p. 148.</ref> Friends and those close to her remarked that, while fashionable like Kennedy, she would be different from other first ladies; close friend Harriet Deutsch was quoted as saying, "Nancy has her own imprint."<ref name="stylenyt" />

Reagan's wardrobe consisted of dresses, gowns, and suits made by luxury designers, including [[James Galanos]], [[Bill Blass]], and [[Oscar de la Renta]]. Her white, hand-beaded, one shoulder Galanos 1981 inaugural gown was estimated to cost $10,000,<ref name="Nancy's Closet" /> while the overall price of her inaugural wardrobe was said to cost $25,000.<ref name="spbt">{{cite news|author=Bennetts, Leslie|title=Nancy Reagan's inaugural wardrobe gives notice of new White House opulence|date=January 25, 1981|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times}}</ref> She favored the color red, calling it "a picker-upper", and wore it accordingly.<ref name="Nancy's Closet" /> Her wardrobe included red so often that the fire-engine shade became known as "Reagan red".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/03/nancy-reagan-white-house-style |title=ow Nancy Reagan Returned Unapologetic Glamour to the White House |accessdate=August 13, 2019 |work=Vanity Fair |date=March 7, 2016 |author=Keogh, Pamela}}</ref> She employed two private hairdressers, who would style her hair on a regular basis in the White House.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE0D81338F930A1575BC0A960948260|title=Washington Talk: Briefing; A Do Ado|author1=King, Wayne  |author2=Warren Weaver, Jr. |name-list-style=amp |date=August 23, 1986|accessdate=June 18, 2008 | work=The New York Times}}</ref>

Fashion designers were pleased with the emphasis Reagan placed on clothing.<ref name="spbt" /> [[Adolfo (designer)|Adolfo]] said the first lady embodied an "elegant, affluent, well-bred, chic American look",<ref name="spbt" /> while Bill Blass commented, "I don't think there's been anyone in the White House since Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis who has her flair."<ref name="spbt" /> William Fine, president of cosmetic company Frances Denney, noted that she "stays in style, but she doesn't become trendy."<ref name="spbt" />

Though her elegant fashions and wardrobe were hailed as a "glamorous paragon of chic",<ref name="spbt" /> they were also controversial subjects.

Reagan reflected on the criticisms in her 1989 autobiography, ''[[My Turn (memoir)|My Turn]]''. She described lunching with former [[Democratic National Committee]] chairman [[Robert S.

=== Her husband's protector ===
Reagan assumed the role of unofficial "protector" for her husband after the [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|attempted assassination of him]] in 1981.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/06/05/national/main621274.shtml|title=His Fierce Protector: Nancy|first=David|last=Hancock|accessdate= November 15, 2007|date= June 5, 2004|publisher=CBS}}</ref> On March 30 of that year, President Reagan and three others were shot by the attempted assassin 25-year old [[John Hinckley, Jr]] as they left the [[Washington Hilton]] hotel.

She recalled having seen "emergency rooms before, but I had never seen one like this – with my husband in it."<ref>Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 5.</ref> She was escorted into a waiting room, and when granted access to see her husband, he quipped to her, "Honey, I forgot to duck", borrowing the defeated boxer [[Jack Dempsey]]'s jest to his wife.<ref name="NoonanPBS">{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/essays/reagan.html| author=Noonan, Peggy|title= Character Above All: Ronald Reagan essay |publisher = PBS |accessdate=August 15, 2007}}</ref>

An early example of the first lady's protective nature occurred when Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] entered the President's hospital room that day in March, passing the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] detail by claiming he was the President's "close friend", presumably to acquire media attention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web1.millercenter.org/poh/transcripts/ohp_2002_1024_friedersdorf.pdf|title= Final Edited Transcript: Interview with Max Friedersdorf|accessdate= October 20, 2007|date= October 24–25, 2002|publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs|page= 60|quote=Mrs. Reagan was all upset, of course.

During the Reagan administration, Nancy Reagan consulted a San Francisco [[Astrology|astrologer]], [[Joan Quigley]], who provided advice on which days and times would be optimal for the president's safety and success.<ref name="First Lady Nancy Reagan" /><ref name="Ivins, Molly">{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDF1030F93BA25750C0A966958260|title=Stars and Strife|accessdate= November 16, 2007|date= March 18, 1990|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author=Ivins, Molly|authorlink=Molly Ivins}}</ref> [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Donald Regan]] grew frustrated with this regimen, which created friction between him and the first lady.

In his 1988 memoir, ''For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington'', Regan wrote the following about Nancy Reagan's consultations with an astrologer:

{{quote|Virtually every major move and decision the Reagans made during my time as White House Chief of Staff was cleared in advance with a woman in San Francisco [Quigley] who drew up horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in a favorable alignment for the enterprise.<ref>Donald Regan.

Reagan further claimed that Quigley selected the date of the 1985 Geneva Summit. For her part, Quigley stated in 1998 that she had "'absolutely nothing'" to do with arranging the summit and added that others were "'overemphasizing'" her role;<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20099022,00.html "The President's Astrologers", ''People'' (May 23, 1988)]</ref> however, in 1990, she released a book in which she asserted that she was "in charge" of the President's scheduling during the Reagan administration.<ref name="Ivins, Molly"/>

Reagan acknowledged in her memoirs that she altered the President's schedule without his knowledge based on astrological advice, but argues that "no political decision was ever based [on astrology]".<ref name="times">{{cite news|work=The New York Times|date=November 1, 1989|accessdate=June 3, 2008|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1DC1330F932A35752C1A96F948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2|title=Books of the Times; Nancy Reagan Tells Her Side of the Stories|author=Apple, R.W.

=== Influence in the White House ===
Nancy Reagan wielded a powerful influence over President Reagan.<ref name="BBC Nancy's image" /> 
In her memoirs, Reagan stated, "I felt panicky every time [Ronald Reagan] left the White House".<ref>Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 21.</ref> Following the assassination attempt, she strictly controlled access to the president;<ref name="First Lady Nancy Reagan" /><ref name="BBC Nancy's image" /> occasionally, she even attempted to influence her husband's decision making.<ref>Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 62.</ref>

Beginning in 1985, she strongly encouraged her husband to hold "summit" conferences with Soviet general secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and suggested they form a personal relationship beforehand.<ref name="First Lady Nancy Reagan" /> Both Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev had developed a productive relationship through their summit negotiations. The relationship between Nancy Reagan and [[Raisa Gorbacheva]] was anything but the friendly, diplomatic one between their husbands; Reagan found Gorbacheva hard to converse with and their relationship was described as "frosty".<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 14, 2008|date=December 8, 1988|author=Celestine Bohlen|title= The Gorbachev Visit; Another Obstacle Falls: Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev Get Chummy|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DD1039F93BA35751C1A96E948260}}</ref> The two women usually had tea and discussed differences between the USSR and the United States. Visiting the United States for the first time in 1987, Gorbacheva irked Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to socialism, reportedly prompting the American president's wife to quip, "Who does that dame think she is?"<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967592-1,00.html |magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| author = Chua-Eoan, Howard G. | title = My Wife Is a Very Independent Lady | date = June 6, 1988 | accessdate = October 5, 2007}}</ref>

Press framing of Reagan changed from that of just helpmate and protector to someone with hidden power.<ref name="burns-power">Burns, Lisa (2008), pp. 139–140.</ref> As the image of her as a political interloper grew, she sought to explicitly deny that she was the [[power behind the throne]].<ref name="burns-power" /> At the end of her time as First Lady, however, she said that her husband had not been well-served by his staff.<ref name="burns-power" /><ref name="reut111388" /> She acknowledged her role in reaction in influencing him on personnel decisions, saying "In no way do I apologize for it."<ref name="reut111388">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/13/us/nancy-reagan-criticizes-aides-to-president.html | title=Nancy Reagan Criticizes Aides to President | agency=Reuters | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 13, 1988 | accessdate=May 16, 2009}}</ref> She wrote in her memoirs, "I don't think I was as bad, or as extreme in my power or my weakness, as I was depicted,"<ref>Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. vii.</ref> but went on, "However the first lady fits in, she has a unique and important role to play in looking after her husband. And it's only natural that she'll let him know what she thinks. I always did that for Ronnie, and I always will."<ref>Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 65.</ref>

=== Breast cancer ===
In October 1987, a [[Mammography|mammogram]] detected a lesion in Reagan's left breast and she was subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer. She chose to undergo a [[mastectomy]] rather than a [[lumpectomy]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9B0DE2DA123DF93BA25753C1A961948260|title=Surgeons Remove Cancerous Breast of Nancy Reagan|accessdate=June 23, 2008|work=The New York Times|author=Altman, Lawrence K|date=October 18, 1987}}</ref> and the breast was removed on October 17, 1987. Ten days after the operation, her 99-year-old mother, [[Edith Luckett Davis]], died in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], leading Reagan to dub the period "a terrible month".<ref>Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 285.</ref>

After the surgery, more women across the country had mammograms, which exemplified the influence that the first lady possessed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001360.htm|title=Perspectives in Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Trends in Screening Mammograms for Women 50 Years of Age and Older&nbsp;– Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 1987|accessdate=June 23, 2008|date=March 10, 1989|publisher=Department of Health and Human Services}}</ref>

== Later life ==
