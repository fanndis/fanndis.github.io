The '''High Court of Australia''' is the highest court in the [[Judiciary of Australia#Australian court hierarchy|Australian court hierarchy]] and the final [[appellate court|court of appeal]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1301.0~2012~Main%20Features~Courts~67 | title = Courts | access-date = 4 May 2013 | date = 24 May 2012 | publisher = [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] | quote = The High Court of Australia is the highest court of appeal}}</ref> It has both [[Original jurisdiction|original]] and [[appellate jurisdiction]], the power of [[judicial review]] over laws passed by the [[Parliament of Australia]] and the parliaments of the states and territories, and the ability to interpret the [[Constitution of Australia]] and thereby shape the development of [[federalism in Australia]].

The High Court is mandated by section 71 of the [[Australian Constitution]], which vests in it the [[judiciary|judicial power]] of the Commonwealth of Australia. The court was constituted by, and its first members were appointed under, the [[Judiciary Act 1903]]. It now operates under sections 71 to 75 of the constitution, the ''Judiciary Act'',<ref name="Judiciary Act"/> and the ''High Court of Australia Act'' 1979.<ref name="High Court of Australia Act" /> It is composed of seven justices: the [[Chief Justice of Australia]], currently [[Susan Kiefel]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AC}}, and six other justices. They are formally appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia]] on the advice of the federal government and under the constitution must retire at age 70.

The High Court has had a permanent home in [[Canberra]] since 1980. The majority of its sittings are held in the [[Commonwealth Heritage List|heritage-registered]] High Court building, located in the [[Parliamentary Triangle]] overlooking [[Lake Burley Griffin]].<ref name=AHD/> With increasing utilisation of video links, sittings are also often held in the state capitals.

== Role ==
The High Court exercises both original [[jurisdiction]] (cases that originate in the High Court) and appellate jurisdiction (appeals made to the High Court from other courts). The High Court is the court of final appeal with the ability to interpret the [[common law]] for the whole of Australia, not just the state or territory in which the matter arose. The High Court's broad jurisdiction is similar to that of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] and unlike the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] which has a more limited jurisdiction. As such, the court is able to develop the common law consistently across all the states and territories. This role, alongside its role in constitutional interpretation, is one of the court's most significant. As [[Owen Dixon|Sir Owen Dixon]] said on his swearing in as Chief Justice of Australia:
<blockquote>
"The High Court's jurisdiction is divided in its exercise between constitutional and federal cases which loom so largely in the public eye, and the great body of litigation between man and man, or even man and government, which has nothing to do with the Constitution, and which is the principal preoccupation of the court."<ref name="Dixon_cj_speech">{{cite journal |last=Dixon |first=Owen |author-link=Owen Dixon |title=Address on being sworn in as Chief Justice |journal=[[Commonwealth Law Reports]] |year=1952 |volume=85 |pages=XIII}} Not online.</ref>
</blockquote>
This broad array of jurisdiction enables the High Court to take a leading role in Australian law and contributes to consistency and uniformity among the laws of the different states.<ref name="Barwick_keystone_intro">{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=J. M. |title=Keystone of the Federal Arch |year=1980 |publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service |location=Canberra |isbn=0-642-04866-5 |chapter=Foreword by Sir Garfield Barwick}}</ref>

===Original jurisdiction===
The original jurisdiction of the High Court refers to matters that are originally heard in the High Court. The Australian Constitution confers actual (section 75) and potential (section 76) original jurisdiction.

Section 75 of the constitution confers original jurisdiction in regard to "all matters":
{{ordered list|type=i
| arising under any treaty
| affecting [[consulate general|consuls]] or other representatives of other countries
| in which the Commonwealth, or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth, is a party
| between States, or between residents of different States, or between a State and a resident of another State
| in which a writ of [[mandamus]] or [[prohibition (writ)|prohibition]] or an [[injunction]] is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth.
}}

The conferral of original jurisdiction creates some problems for the High Court. For example, challenges against immigration-related decisions are often brought against an officer of the Commonwealth within the original jurisdiction of the High Court.

Section 76 provides that Parliament ''may'' confer original jurisdiction in relation to matters:
{{ordered list|type=i
| arising under the constitution or involving its interpretation
| arising under any laws made by the Parliament
| of [[admiralty law|admiralty]] and maritime jurisdiction
| relating to the same subject matter claimed under the laws of different states.
}}

Constitutional matters, referred to in section 76(i), have been conferred to the High Court by section 30 of the ''[[Judiciary Act 1903]]''.<ref name="Judiciary Act">{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ja1903112|Judiciary Act 1903}}.</ref> However, the inclusion of constitutional matters in section 76, rather than section 75, means that the High Court's original jurisdiction regarding constitutional matters could be removed. In practice, section 75(iii) (suing the Commonwealth) and section 75(iv) (conflicts between states) are broad enough that many constitutional matters would still be within jurisdiction. The original constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court is now well established: the [[Australian Law Reform Commission]] has described the inclusion of constitutional matters in section 76 rather than section 75 as "an odd fact of history."<ref name="ALRC_92">{{cite web | author=Australian Law Reform Commission | title=The Judicial Power of the Commonwealth | work=Australian Legal Information Institute | url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/alrc/publications/reports/92/ch12.html#Heading7|access-date=19 March 2006}}</ref> The [[Australian Constitutional Convention 1998|1998 Constitutional Convention]] recommended an amendment to the constitution to prevent the possibility of the jurisdiction being removed by Parliament. Failure to proceed on this issue suggests that it was considered highly unlikely that Parliament would ever take this step.

The requirement of "a matter" in section 75 and section 76 of the constitution means that a concrete issue must need to be resolved and the High Court cannot give an advisory opinion.<ref>{{cite AustLII|HCA|20|1921|litigants=In Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts|parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1921/20.pdf (1921) 29 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 257], at 265}}.</ref>

===Appellate jurisdiction===
{{Australian court hierarchy}}
The High Court's appellate jurisdiction is defined under section 73 of the Constitution. The High Court can hear appeals from the supreme courts of the [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]], any federal court or court exercising federal jurisdiction (such as the [[Federal Court of Australia]], the [[Federal Circuit Court of Australia]], or other federal courts), and decisions made by one or more justices exercising the original jurisdiction of the court.

However, section 73 allows the appellate jurisdiction to be limited "with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as the Parliament prescribes". Parliament has prescribed a large limitation in section 35A of the ''Judiciary Act 1903''. This requires "special leave" to appeal. Special leave is granted only where a question of law is raised that is of public importance, or involves a conflict between courts; or "is in the interests of the administration of justice". Therefore, while the High Court is the final court of appeal, it cannot be considered a general court of appeal. The decision as to whether to grant special leave to appeal is determined by one or more Justices of the High Court (in practice, a panel of two or three judges). That is, the Court exercises the power to decide which appeal cases it will consider.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/court/courts/high-court-of-australia/ |title=High Court of Australia |work=Courts |publisher=[[Queensland Government]] |date=31 October 2013 |access-date=4 August 2016}}</ref>

===Appeals to the Privy Council===
The issue of appeals from the High Court to the United Kingdom's [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] was a significant one during the drafting of the Constitution and it continued to be significant in the years after the court's creation. The wording of section 74 of the constitution that was put to voters in the various colonies was that there was to be no appeal to the Privy Council in any matter involving the interpretation of the Constitution or of the Constitution of a State unless it involved the interests of some other dominion.<ref>See for example {{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/acts/1899-2.pdf |title='' Australasian Federation Enabling Act'' 1899 No 2 (NSW) |publisher=NSW Parliamentary Council's Office}}</ref>

Section 74 of the Constitution, as enacted by the Imperial Parliament,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1900/12/pdfs/ukpga_19000012_en.pdf|title=''Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act'' 1900 (Imp)}}</ref> prohibited appeals on constitutional matters involving disputes about the limits ''[[inter se]]'' of Commonwealth or state powers, except where the High Court certified it was appropriate for the appeal to be determined by the Privy Council. It did so only once: in the 1912 case of ''[[Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth)]]'' when the Court was equally divided.<ref name="csr">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|94|1912|litigants=[[Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth)]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1912/94.pdf (1912) 15 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 182]}}.</ref> After that case, in which the Privy Council refused to answer the constitutional questions put to it, the High Court never certified another ''inter se'' appeal.<ref name="Hull_centenary">{{cite book | author=Hull, Crispin | title=The High Court of Australia: celebrating the centenary 1903–2003 | publisher=Lawbook Co. | year=2003|isbn=0-455-21947-8 |url=http://www.crispinhull.com.au/high-court-book/}}</ref> Indeed, in the case of ''[[Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 2)|Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd]]'' (1985), the court said that it would never again grant a certificate of appeal.<ref name="kirmani no2">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|27|1985|litigants=[[Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 2)]] |parallelcite=(1985) 159 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 461}}.</ref>

In general matters, however, section 74 did not prevent the Privy Council from granting leave to appeal against the High Court's wishes and the Council did so often. In some cases the Council acknowledged that the Australian common law had developed differently from English law and thus did not apply its own principles (for example, in ''Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Uren'' (1967),<ref name="uren">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|21|1967|litigants=Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Uren |parallelcite=(1967) 117 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 221}}.</ref> or in ''Viro v The Queen'' (1978)),<ref name="viro">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|9|1978|litigants=Viro v The Queen |parallelcite=(1978) 141 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 88}}.</ref> by using a [[legal fiction]] that stated that different common law can apply to different circumstances.<ref name="Gleeson_s74">{{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/gleesoncj/cj_18jun08.pdf |title=The Birth, Life and Death of Section 74 |author=Gleeson, M |author-link=Murray Gleeson |date=2002}}</ref> However, in other cases, the Privy Council enforced English decisions, over-ruling decisions by the High Court. In ''Parker v The Queen''<ref name="parker">{{Cite AustLII |litigants=Parker v The Queen |year=1963 |court=HCA |num=14 |parallecite=(1963) 111 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 610}}.</ref> (1963), Chief Justice Sir Owen Dixon led a unanimous judgment that rejected a precedent of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''DPP v Smith'' saying, "I shall not depart from the law on this matter as we have long since laid it down in this Court and I think that Smith's case should not be used in Australia as authority at all".<ref name="parker" /> The following year the Privy Council upheld an appeal, applying the House of Lords precedent.<ref name="parker appeal">{{cite BAILII |litigants=Parker v The Queen |year=1964 |court=UKPC |num=16 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1964] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 1369}}; {{Cite AustLII|UKPCHCA|1|1964|parallelcite=(1964) 111 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 665 |courtname=auto |juris=NSW |date=23 March 1964}}.</ref>

Section 74 did provide that the parliament could make laws to prevent appeals to the Privy Council and it did so, beginning in 1968, with the ''Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968'', which closed off all appeals to the Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation.<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004C06161 ''Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act'' 1968 (Cth)], which ended all appeals to the Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation</ref> In 1975, the ''Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act 1975'' was passed, which had the effect of closing all routes of appeal from the High Court.<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A00255 ''Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act'' 1975 (Cth)], which prohibited almost all types of appeal from the High Court.</ref> Appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council are now only theoretically possible in ''[[inter se]]'' matters if the High Court grants a certificate of appeal under section 74 of the Constitution. As noted above, the High Court indicated in 1985 it would not grant such a certificate in the future.  In 1986, with the passing of the [[Australia Act 1986|Australia Act]] by both the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/2/enacted/data.htm|title=Australia Act 1986|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> and the Parliament of Australia (with the request and consent of the Australian States),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A03181/Html/Text|title=Australia Act 1986|website=www.legislation.gov.au}}</ref> appeals to the Privy Council from state Supreme Courts were closed off, leaving the High Court as the only avenue of appeal.  In 2002, [[Chief Justice of Australia|Chief Justice]] [[Murray Gleeson]] said that the "combined effect" of the legislation and the announcement in ''Kirmani'' "has been that s 74 has become a dead letter, and what remains of s 74 after the legislation limiting appeals to the Privy Council will have no further effect".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/gleesoncj/cj_griffith2.htm|last=Gleeson|first=Murray|title=The Birth, Life and Death of Section 74|website=Samuel Griffith Society|date=14 June 2002|access-date=10 November 2019}}</ref>

===Appellate jurisdiction for Nauru===
As per an agreement between [[Nauru]] and Australia signed on 6 September 1976, in application of article 57 of the [[Constitution of Nauru]], the High Court of Australia became the ultimate court of appeal for the sovereign Republic of Nauru, formerly an Australian [[League of Nations mandate]]. The High Court was empowered to hear appeals from the [[Supreme Court of Nauru]] in both criminal and civil cases, with certain exceptions; in particular, no case pertaining to the [[Constitution of Nauru]] could be decided by the Australian court.<ref>{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ncaa1976254/sch1.html|Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Nauru relating to Appeals to the High Court of Australia from the Supreme Court of Nauru}}, 6 September 1976</ref>  There were a total of five appeals to the High Court under this agreement in the first 40 years of its operation.

The Supreme Court of Nauru subsequently increased the sentences imposed by the District Court, leading to an appeal in which the High Court quashed the decision.<ref name = Gans /><ref name = CecilHCA>{{cite AustLII|litigants = Cecil v Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru); Kepae v Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru); Jeremiah v Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru)|court = HCA|year = 2017|num = 46|date = 20 October 2017|courtname = High Court}}</ref>  The case was remitted to the Supreme Court "differently constituted, for hearing according to law."<ref name = CecilHCA />

On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Nauru's independence, President [[Baron Waqa]] declared to parliament that "[s]everance of ties to Australia’s highest court is a logical step towards full nationhood and an expression of confidence in Nauru’s ability to determine its own destiny."<ref name = Gans />  Nauruan Justice Minister [[David Adeang]] cited the cost of appeals to the High Court as another reason for Nauru to establish its own [[Court of Appeal (Nauru)|Court of Appeal]] as the country's highest court.<ref>{{cite web|title = Nauru Court of Appeal another step to nation's maturity|work = [[NauruNews]]|date = 2 March 2018|access-date = 2 April 2018|url = http://nauru-news.com/nauru-court-appeal-another-step-nations-maturity/|publisher = [[Government of Nauru|The Government of the Republic of Nauru]]}}</ref>  Under the agreement, the government of either country could end the arrangement with 90 days notice.

==History==
The genesis of the court can be traced back to the middle of the 19th century. Before the establishment of the High Court, appeals from the colonial supreme courts could be made only to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which involved the great expense of travelling to London. For this reason some politicians in the colonies wanted a new court that could travel between the colonies hearing appeals.

Following [[Henry George Grey, 3rd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]]'s 1846 proposal for federation of the Australian colonies, an 1849 report from the Privy Council of the United Kingdom suggested that a national court be created.<ref name="Williams_hundred">{{cite book | author=Williams, John | title=One hundred years of the High Court of Australia | publisher=King's College, London | year=2003|isbn=1-85507-124-X}}</ref> In 1856, the then [[Governor of South Australia]], [[Richard Graves MacDonnell]], suggested to the [[Government of South Australia]] that they and the other colonies should consider establishing a court of appeal that would hear appeals from the Supreme Courts in each colony, and in 1860 the [[Parliament of South Australia]] passed legislation encouraging MacDonnell to put forward the idea to his colleagues in the other colonies. However, only the [[Government of Victoria]] seriously considered this proposal.<ref name="Bennett_keystone">{{cite book | last=Bennett | first=J.M. | author-link=John Bennett (Australian lawyer) | title=Keystone of the Federal Arch | year=1980 | publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service | location=Canberra | isbn=0-642-04866-5}}</ref>

At an inter-colonial conference in 1870 in [[Melbourne]], the idea of an inter-colonial court was again raised and subsequently a [[Royal Commission]] was established in Victoria to investigate options for establishing a court of appeal and for unifying [[extradition]] laws between the colonies and other similar matters. A draft bill establishing a court was put forward by the Commission, but it completely excluded appeals to the Privy Council, which reacted critically and prevented any serious attempts to implement the bill in London (before [[federation of Australia|federation]], any laws affecting all the colonies would have to be passed by the [[British Imperial Parliament]] in London).<ref name="Bennett_keystone"/>

In 1880 another inter-colonial conference was convened, which proposed the establishment of an Australasian Court of Appeal. This conference was more firmly focussed on having an Australian court. Another draft bill was produced, providing that judges from the colonial Supreme Courts would serve one-year terms on the new court, with one judge from each colony at a given time. New Zealand, which was at the time also considering joining the Australian colonies in federation, was also to be a participant in the new court.<ref name="Bennett_keystone"/> However, the proposal retained appeals from colonial Supreme Courts to the Privy Council, which some of the colonies disputed, and the bill was eventually abandoned.

===Constitutional conventions===
[[File:Chief Justice Samuel Griffith.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]], first [[Chief Justice of Australia]]]]
The [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Constitutional Conventions]] of the 1890s, which met to draft an Australian Constitution, also raised the idea of a federal Supreme Court. Initial proposals at a conference in [[Melbourne]] in February 1890 led to a convention in [[Sydney]] in March and April 1891, which produced a draft constitution. The draft included the creation of a Supreme Court of Australia, which would not only interpret the Constitution, like the United States Supreme Court, but also would be a court of appeal from the state Supreme Courts. The draft effectively removed appeals to the Privy Council, allowing them only if the [[British monarch]] gave leave to appeal and not allowing appeals at all in constitutional matters.

This draft was largely the work of [[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]],<ref name="Hull_centenary"/> then the [[Premier of Queensland]], later Chief Justice of Queensland and the first Chief Justice of Australia. Other significant contributors to the judicial clauses in the draft included Attorney-General of Tasmania [[Andrew Inglis Clark]], who had prepared his own constitution prior to the convention. Inglis Clark's most significant contribution was to give the court its own constitutional authority, ensuring the [[separation of powers]]; the original formulation from Griffith, [[Edmund Barton]] and [[Charles Kingston]] provided only that the parliament could establish a court.<ref name="Williams_hundred"/>

[[File:Andrew inglis clark.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andrew Inglis Clark]], prominent contributor to the clauses about the High Court in the [[Constitution of Australia]].]]

At the later conventions, in [[Adelaide]] in 1897, in [[Sydney]] later the same year and in Melbourne in early 1898, there were changes to the earlier draft. In Adelaide, the name of the court was changed from Supreme Court of Australia to High Court of Australia. Many people also opposed the new court completely replacing the Privy Council: many large businesses, particularly those which were subsidiaries of British companies or regularly traded with the United Kingdom, preferred for business reasons to keep the colonies under the unified jurisdiction of the British courts, and petitioned the conventions to that effect.<ref name="Hull_centenary"/> Other arguments posited against removing Privy Council appeals were that Australian judges were of a poorer quality than English ones, and that without the Council's oversight, the law in the colonies risked becoming different from English law.<ref name="Williams_hundred" /> Some politicians, such as [[George Dibbs|Sir George Dibbs]], supported the petitioners, but others, including [[Alfred Deakin]], supported the design of the court as it was.<ref name="Hull_centenary" /> Inglis Clark took the view that the possibility of divergence was a good thing, for the law could adapt appropriately to Australian circumstances.<ref name="Williams_hundred" /> Despite the debate, the portions of the draft dealing with the court remained largely unchanged, as the delegates focused on different matters.

After the draft had been approved by the electors of the colonies, it was taken to London in 1899, for the assent of the British Imperial Parliament. However the issue of Privy Council appeals remained a sticking point with a number of Australian and British politicians, including the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Joseph Chamberlain]], the Chief Justice of South Australia, [[Samuel Way|Sir Samuel Way]], and the Chief Justice of Queensland, [[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]].<ref name="Gleeson_s74" /> Indeed, in October 1899, Griffith made representations to Chamberlain soliciting suggestions from British ministers for alterations to the draft, and offering some alterations of his own.<ref name="Gleeson_s74" /> Indeed, such was the effect of these and other representations that Chamberlain called for delegates from the colonies to come to London to assist with the approval process, with a view to their approving any alterations that the British government might see fit to make; delegates were sent, including Deakin, Barton and [[Charles Kingston]], although they were under instructions that they would never agree to changes.<ref name="Gleeson_s74" />

After intense lobbying both in Australia and in the United Kingdom, the Imperial Parliament finally approved the draft constitution, albeit with an altered section 74, which represented a compromise between the two sides: there would be a general right of appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council, except that the Parliament of Australia would be able to make laws restricting this avenue, and also that appeals in ''inter se'' matters (matters concerning the boundary between and limits of the powers of the Commonwealth and the powers of the states) were not as of right, but had to be certified by the High Court.<ref name="Gleeson_s74" />

===Formation of the court===
[[File:Opening hca melb.jpg|thumb|The first [[Chief Justice of Australia]], [[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]], is administered the judicial oath at the first sitting of the High Court, in the [[wikt:banco|Banco]] Court of the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], 6 October 1903.]]
The Constitution was passed by the Imperial Parliament, and came into effect on 1 January 1901. However, the High Court was not established immediately; it was necessary for the new Parliament of Australia to make laws about the structure and procedure of the court. Some of the [[Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 1901–1903|members of the First Parliament]], including [[John Quick (politician)|Sir John Quick]], then one of the leading legal experts in Australia, opposed legislation to set up the court. Even [[H. B. Higgins]], who was himself later appointed to the court, objected to setting it up, on the grounds that it would be impotent while Privy Council appeals remained, and that in any event there was not enough work for a federal court to make it viable.<ref name="Hull_centenary"/>

In 1902, the then [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]] Alfred Deakin introduced the ''Judiciary Bill 1902'' in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Although Deakin and Griffith had produced a draft bill as early as February 1901, it was continually delayed by opponents in the parliament, and the success of the bill is generally attributed to Deakin's passion and effort in pushing the bill through the parliament despite this opposition.<ref name="Williams_hundred" /> Deakin had proposed that the court be composed of five judges, specially selected to the court; opponents instead proposed that the court should be made up of state Supreme Court justices, taking turns to sit on the High Court on a rotation basis, as had been mooted at the Constitutional Conventions a decade before.<ref name="mchugh oxford companion">{{cite speech |title=The High Court and the Oxford Companion to the High Court |last=McHugh |first=Michael |author-link=Michael McHugh (judge) |event=Constitutional Law and Conference Dinner |location=Botanical Gardens Restaurant |date=15 February 2002 |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/former-justices/mchughj/mchughj_oxford.htm |access-date=25 February 2012 }}</ref> Deakin eventually negotiated amendments with the [[opposition (Australia)|opposition]], reducing the number of judges from five to three, and eliminating financial benefits such as pensions.

At one point, Deakin even threatened to resign as Attorney-General due to the difficulties he faced.<ref name="Williams_hundred"/> In what is now a famous speech, Deakin gave a [[Reading (legislature)|second reading]] to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], lasting three and a half hours, in which he declared:
<blockquote>"The federation is constituted by distribution of powers, and it is this court which decides the orbit and boundary of every power... It is properly termed the keystone of the federal arch... The statute stands and will stand on the statute-book just as in the hour in which it was assented to. But the nation lives, grows and expands. Its circumstances change, its needs alter, and its problems present themselves with new faces. [The High Court] enables the Constitution to grow and be adapted to the changeful necessities and circumstances of generation after generation that the High Court operates."<ref name="Deakin_keystone">{{cite journal |author=Deakin, Alfred |author-link=Alfred Deakin |title=''Judiciary Bill'', second reading |journal=Commonwealth Parliamentary Debates |year=1902 |volume=8 |pages=10967}}</ref></blockquote>
Deakin's friend, painter [[Tom Roberts]], who viewed the speech from the public gallery, declared it Deakin's "magnum opus".<ref name="Williams_hundred" /> The Judiciary Act 1903 was finally passed on 25 August 1903, and the first three justices, Chief Justice Sir Samuel Griffith and Justices [[Edmund Barton|Sir Edmund Barton]] and [[Richard O'Connor (politician)|Richard O'Connor]] were appointed on 5 October of that year. On 6 October, the court held its first sitting in the Banco Court in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]].

On 12 October 1906, the size of the High Court was increased to five Justices, and Deakin appointed [[H. B. Higgins]] and [[Isaac Isaacs]] to the High Court. In February 1913, the High Court was increased again, with the addition of two justices, bringing the total to seven. [[Charles Powers]] and [[Albert Bathurst Piddington]] were appointed.  The outcry against their appointments was so great, however, that Justice Piddington resigned on 5 April 1913 without having taken up his seat.<ref name="history of the high court">{{cite web|title=History of the High Court |publisher=High Court of Australia |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/about/history-of-the-high-court| access-date=15 September 2017 }}</ref>

===First years of the court===
[[File:HCA Melbourne LtBourke.jpg|thumb|The court's home between 1928 and 1980, the purpose-built courtroom in [[Little Bourke Street, Melbourne]].]]
After the court's first sitting in the Banco Court in [[Melbourne]], the court continued to use that court until 1928, when a dedicated courtroom was built in [[Little Bourke Street, Melbourne|Little Bourke Street]], next to the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], which provided the court's Melbourne sitting place and housed the court's principal [[wikt:registry|registry]] until 1980.<ref name="prov old building">{{cite web|title=High Court Building |work=Our Nation's First Capital |publisher=Public Records Office Victoria |url=http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/exhibs/ournation/f_hcb.htm |access-date=4 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819072852/http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/exhibs/ournation/f_hcb.htm |archive-date=19 August 2008  }}</ref> The court also sat regularly in Sydney, where it originally shared space in the Criminal Courts in the suburb of [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]], before a dedicated courtroom was constructed next door in 1923.<ref name="centenary press release">{{cite web |title=Ch 3.

[[File:HCA Darlinghurst annex.jpg|thumb|left|The annexe to the Criminal Court in [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]], the court's home in Sydney.]]
The court travelled to other cities across the country, where it did not have any facilities of its own but used facilities of the Supreme Court in each city. Deakin had envisaged that the court would sit in many different locations, so as to truly be a federal court. Shortly after the court's creation, Chief Justice Griffith established a schedule for sittings in state capitals: [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]] in February, [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] in June, [[Perth, Western Australia]] in September and Adelaide, [[South Australia]] in October; it is said that Griffith established this schedule because those were the times of year he found the weather most pleasant in each city. The tradition remains to this day, although most of the court's sittings are now conducted in Canberra.

Sittings were dependent on the caseload and to this day sittings in Hobart occur only once every few years. There are annual sittings in Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane for up to a week each. During the [[Great Depression]], sittings outside of Melbourne and Sydney were suspended to reduce costs.

During [[World War II]], the court faced a period of change. The Chief Justice, [[John Latham (Australian jurist)|Sir John Latham]], served from 1940 to 1941 as Australia's first ambassador to Japan, although his activities in this role were limited by the mutual assistance pact that Japan had entered into with the [[Axis powers]] before he could arrive in Tokyo, and were curtailed by the commencement of the [[Pacific War]].<ref name="adb latham">{{cite AuDB |id2=latham-sir-john-greig-7104 |title=Latham, Sir John Greig (1877–1964) |first=Stuart |last=Macintyre |volume=10 |pages=2–6 |year=1986 |isbn = 0-522-84327-1}}</ref> Justice Sir Owen Dixon was also absent for several years, while he served as Australia's minister to the United States in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].<ref name="adb Dixon">{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |first1=Grant |last1=Anderson |first2=Daryl |last2=Dawson |author-link2=Daryl Dawson |title=Dixon, Sir Owen (1886–1972) |id2=dixon-sir-owen-10024 |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> [[George Rich|Sir George Rich]] was Acting Chief Justice in Latham's absence. There were many difficult cases concerning the [[Government of Australia|federal government]]'s use of the defence power during the war.

===Post-war period===
From 1952, with the appointment of Sir Owen Dixon as Chief Justice, the court entered a period of stability. After World War II, the court's workload continued to grow, particularly from the 1960s onwards, putting pressures on the court.<ref name="hcourt_history">{{cite web | title=About the High Court&nbsp;– History of the High Court | work=High Court of Australia | url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/about_02.html |access-date=10 December 2005}}</ref> [[Garfield Barwick|Sir Garfield Barwick]], who was [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]] from 1958 to 1964, and from then until 1981 Chief Justice, proposed that more federal courts be established, as permitted under the Constitution. In 1976 the [[Federal Court of Australia]] was established, with a general federal jurisdiction, and in more recent years the [[Family Court of Australia|Family Court]] and [[Federal Magistrates Court]] have been set up to reduce the court's workload in specific areas.

In 1968, appeals to the Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation were barred by the ''Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968''. In 1975, the ''Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act 1975'' closed all routes of appeal from the High Court. In 1986, with the passing of the ''[[Australia Act 1986|Australia Act]]'' by both the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] and the Parliament of Australia (with the request and consent of the Australian States), direct appeals to the Privy Council from state Supreme Courts were also closed off, leaving the High Court as the only avenue of appeal.

The life tenure of High Court Justices was ended in 1977. A national referendum in May 1977 approved the ''[[Australian referendum, 1977 (Retirement of Judges)|Constitution Alteration (Retirement of Judges) Act]]'' (Cth), which upon its commencement on 29 July 1977 amended section 72 of the Constitution so as require that all Justices appointed from then on must retire on attaining the age of 70 years.<ref name=HChistory>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hcourt.gov.au/about/history|title=High Court of Australia|first=c=AU; o=Commonwealth of Australia; ou=The High Court of|last=Australia|website=www.hcourt.gov.au}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004A01721|title= Constitution Alteration (Retirement of Judges) Act 1977|website= ComLaw|access-date=3 March 2014}}</ref>

The ''High Court of Australia Act 1979'' (Cth), which commenced on 21 April 1980, gave the High Court power to administer its own affairs and prescribed the qualifications for, and method of appointment of, its Justices.<ref name=HChistory /><ref name="High Court of Australia Act">{{citation |url= http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005C00184 |title= High Court of Australia Act 1979}} (Cth).</ref>

==Jurisprudence==

The legal history of the court is commonly discussed with reference to the Chief Justice of the time. While it is a convenient way of breaking the history of the Court into periods, it tends to overstate the importance of the Chief Justice, and ignores the influence and tenure of other members of the Court; as well as other social factors. For example, Isaacs J was the primary force in the Knox Court, while his own tenure as Chief Justice saw Dixon J emerge as the Court's leading jurist.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The High Court, the Constitution and Australian Politics |editor1=Dixon, R |editor2=Williams, G |editor-link2=George Williams (lawyer) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2015 |isbn=9781107043664 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqewBgAAQBAJ |ref=CITEREFDixon & Williams (eds)}} at pp. 7-8, 101-103, 118-119.</ref>

===Griffith court===
[[File:Ac.isaacs.jpg|thumb|[[Isaac Isaacs|Sir Isaac Isaacs]], Justice from 1906 and Chief Justice from 1930–1931]]

As the first High Court, the court under Chief Justice Sir Samuel Griffith had to establish its position as a new court of appeal for the whole of Australia and had to develop a new body of principle for interpreting the Constitution of Australia and federal legislation. Griffith himself was very much the dominant influence on the court in its early years, but after the appointment of [[Isaac Isaacs|Sir Isaac Isaacs]] and [[H. B. Higgins]] in 1906, and the death of foundation Justice Richard O'Connor, Griffith's influence began to decline.<ref name="companion Griffith court">{{cite book |last=Mason |first=Anthony |author-link=Anthony Mason (judge) |chapter=Griffith Court |title=The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia |editor1-last=Blackshield |editor1-first=Tony |editor2-last=Coper |editor2-first=Michael |editor3-first=George |editor3-last=Williams |editor3-link=George Williams (lawyer) | year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=South Melbourne, Victoria | isbn=0-19-554022-0 }}</ref>

The court was keen to establish its position at the top of the Australian court hierarchy. In ''[[Deakin v Webb]]'' (1904)<ref name="deakin webb">{{cite AustLII|HCA|57|1904|litigants=[[Deakin v Webb]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1904/57.pdf (1904) 1 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 585]}}.</ref> Griffith criticised the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]] for following a Privy Council decision about the [[Constitution of Canada]], rather than following the High Court's own decision on the Australian Constitution.<ref name="Bennett_keystone" />

In [[Australian constitutional law]], the early decisions of the court were influenced by [[United States constitutional law]]. In the case of ''[[D'Emden v Pedder]]'' (1904),<ref name="d'emden">{{cite AustLII|HCA|1904|1|litigants=[[D'Emden v Pedder]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1904/1.pdf (1904) 1 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 91]}}.</ref> which involved the application of Tasmanian [[stamp duty]] to a federal official's salary, the court adopted the doctrine of implied immunity of instrumentalities which had been established in the United States Supreme Court case of ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1803).<ref name="mcculloch">''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' {{ussc|17|316|1819}}</ref> That doctrine established that any attempt by the federal government to interfere with the legislative or executive power of the Australian states was invalid, and vice versa. Accompanying that doctrine was the doctrine of [[reserved State powers]], which was based on the principle that the powers of the Australian parliament should be interpreted narrowly, to avoid intruding on areas of power traditionally exercised by the state parliaments. The concept was developed in such cases as ''[[Peterswald v Bartley]]'' (1904),<ref name="peterswald">{{cite AustLII|HCA|21|1904|litigants=[[Peterswald v Bartley]]  |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1904/21.pdf (1904) 1 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 497]}}.</ref> ''[[R v Barger]]'' (1908)<ref name="barger">{{cite AustLII|HCA|43|1908|litigants=[[R v Barger]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1908/43.pdf (1908) 61 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 41]}}.</ref> and the [[Attorney-General for NSW v Brewery Employees Union of NSW|Union Label case]] (1908).<ref name="union label">{{cite AustLII|HCA|94|1908|litigants=[[Attorney-General for NSW v Brewery Employees Union of NSW]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1908/94.pdf (1908) 6 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 469]}}.</ref>

Together the two doctrines helped smooth the transition to a federal system of government and "by preserving a balance between the constituent elements of the Australian federation, probably conformed to community sentiment, which at that stage was by no means adjusted to the exercise of central power."<ref name="companion Griffith court" /> The court had a generally conservative view of the Constitution, taking narrow interpretations of section 116 (which guarantees religious freedom) and section 117 (which prevents discrimination on the basis of someone's state of origin), interpretations that were to last well into the 1980s.<ref name="companion Griffith court" />

Two of the original judges of the Court, Griffith and Sir Edmund Barton, were frequently consulted by governors-general, including on the exercise of the [[reserve powers]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Markwell, Donald |author-link=Donald Markwell |title=Griffith, Barton and the early governor-generals: aspects of Australia's constitutional development |journal=Public Law Review |year=1999}}</ref> This practice of consultation has continued from time to time since.

===Knox, Isaacs and Gavan Duffy courts===
[[Adrian Knox]] became Chief Justice on 18 October 1919 and less than three months later, foundation Justice Sir Edmund Barton died, leaving no original members. The most significant case of the era was the [[Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd|Engineers case]] (1920),<ref name="engineers">{{cite AustLII|HCA|54|1920|litigants=[[Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd]] (Engineers' Case) |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1920/54.pdf (1920) 28 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 129]}}.</ref> decided at the beginning of Knox's term. In that case, the doctrines of reserved State powers and implied immunity of instrumentalities were both overturned, and the court entered a new era of constitutional interpretation in which the focus would fall almost exclusively on the text of the Constitution, and in which the powers of the Australian parliament would gain increasing importance.

Knox was knighted in 1921, the only Chief Justice to be knighted during his term. Some of the Knox court's early work related to the aftermath of World War I. In ''[[Roche v Kronheimer]]'' (1921),<ref name="roche">{{cite AustLII|HCA|25|1921|litigants=[[Roche v Kronheimer]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1921/25.pdf (1921) 29 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 329]}}.</ref> the Court upheld federal legislation which allowed for the making of regulations to implement Australia's obligations under the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The majority decided the case on the [[Section 51(vi) of the Australian Constitution|defence power]], but Higgins decided it on the [[Section 51(xxix) of the Australian Constitution|external affairs power]], the first case to decide that the external affairs power could be used to implement an international treaty in Australia.

[[Isaac Isaacs|Sir Isaac Isaacs]] was Chief Justice for only forty-two weeks, before leaving the court to be appointed [[Governor-General of Australia]]. Isaacs was ill for much of his term as Chief Justice and few significant cases were decided under his formal leadership; rather, his best years were under Knox, where he was the most senior Justice and led the court in many decisions.<ref name="companion Isaacs">{{cite book |last=Cowen |first=Zelman |author-link=Zelman Cowen |chapter=Isaac Alfred Isaacs |title=The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia |editor1-last=Blackshield |editor1-first=Tony |editor2-last=Coper |editor2-first=Michael |editor3-first=George |editor3-last=Williams |editor3-link=George Williams (lawyer) | year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=South Melbourne, Victoria | isbn=0-19-554022-0 }}</ref>

[[Frank Gavan Duffy|Sir Frank Gavan Duffy]] was Chief Justice for four years beginning in 1931, although he was already 78 when appointed to the position and did not exert much influence, given that (excluding single-Justice cases) he participated in only 40 per cent of cases in that time, and regularly gave short judgments or joint judgments with other Justices.<ref name="companion Gavan Duffy court">{{cite book |last=Fricke |first=Graham |chapter=Gavan Duffy Court |title=The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia |editor1-last=Blackshield |editor1-first=Tony |editor2-last=Coper |editor2-first=Michael |editor3-first=George |editor3-last=Williams |editor3-link=George Williams (lawyer) | year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=South Melbourne, Victoria | isbn=0-19-554022-0 }}</ref> In the context of the [[Great Depression]], the court was reduced to six Justices, resulting in many tied decisions which have no lasting value as [[precedent]].

During this time, the court did decide several important cases, including ''[[Attorney-General (New South Wales) v Trethowan]]'' (1932),<ref name="trethowan">{{cite AustLII|HCA|20|1932|litigants=Attorney-General (NSW) v Trethowan |link=Attorney-General (New South Wales) v Trethowan |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1932/20.pdf (1932) 47 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 97]}}.</ref> which considered [[Premier of New South Wales]] [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]]'s attempt to abolish the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]], and the [[New South Wales v Commonwealth (1932)|First State Garnishee case]] (1932),<ref name="garnishee">{{cite AustLII|HCA|7|1932|litigants=[[New South Wales v Commonwealth (1932)|NSW v Commonwealth]] (first State Garnishee case) |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1932/7.pdf (1932) 46 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 155]}}.</ref> which upheld federal legislation compelling the Lang government to repay its loans. Much of the court's other work related to legislation passed in response to the Depression.

===Latham court===
[[File:Johnlatham.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Latham (judge)|John Latham]], before his appointment to the court, as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs in the [[Joseph Lyons|Lyons]] government.]]

The court under Chief Justice [[John Latham (judge)|Sir John Latham]], who came to the office in 1935, was punctuated by World War II. Although it dealt with cases in other areas, its most important and lasting work related to wartime legislation, and the transition back to peace following the war.<ref name="companion Latham court">{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=Roger |chapter=Latham Court |title=The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia |editor1-last=Blackshield |editor1-first=Tony |editor2-last=Coper |editor2-first=Michael |editor3-first=George |editor3-last=Williams |editor3-link=George Williams (lawyer) | year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=South Melbourne, Victoria | isbn=0-19-554022-0 }}</ref>

The court upheld much legislation under the [[Section 51(vi) of the Australian Constitution|defence power]], interpreting it broadly wherever there was a connection to defence purposes, in cases such as ''[[Andrews v Howell]]'' (1941)<ref name="andrews howell">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|20|1941|litigants=[[Andrews v Howell]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1941/20.pdf (1941) 65 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 255]}}.</ref> and ''[[de Mestre v Chisholm]]'' (1944).<ref name="de mestre">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|8|1944|litigants=[[de Mestre v Chisholm]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1944/8.pdf (1944) 69 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 51]}}.</ref> In general, the [[John Curtin|Curtin]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government was rarely successfully challenged, the court recognising the necessity that the defence power permit the federal government to govern strongly. The court also allowed the federal government to institute a national [[income tax]] scheme in the [[South Australia v Commonwealth|''First Uniform Tax case'']] (1942),<ref name="1st uniform tax">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|14|1942|litigants=[[South Australia v Commonwealth]] (First Uniform Tax case) |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1942/14.pdf (1942) 65 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 373]}}.</ref> and upheld legislation allowing the proclamation of the [[pacifist]] [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] religion as a subversive organisation, in the [[Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses v Commonwealth|''Jehovah's Witnesses case'']] (1943).<ref name="jehovahs witnesses">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|12|1943|litigants=[[Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1943/12pdf (1943) 67 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 116]}}.</ref>

The court reined in the wide scope of the defence power after the war, allowing for a transitional period. It struck down several key planks of the [[Ben Chifley|Chifley]] Labor government's reconstruction program, notably an attempt to [[nationalization|nationalise]] the banks in the [[Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth|Bank Nationalisation case]] (1948),<ref name="bank nationalisation">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|7|1948|litigants=[[Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth]] (Bank Nationalisation case) |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1948/7.pdf (1948) 76 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 1]}}.</ref> and an attempt to establish a comprehensive medical benefits scheme in the [[Attorney-General (Victoria); Ex rel Dale v Commonwealth|First Pharmaceutical Benefits case]] (1945).<ref name="pharma">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|30|1945|litigants=[[Attorney-General (Victoria); Ex rel Dale v Commonwealth]] (First Pharmaceutical Benefits case) |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1945/30.pdf (1945) 71 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 237]}}.</ref> However the court also famously struck down [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]] [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] government legislation banning the [[Communist Party of Australia]] in the [[Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth|Communist Party case]] (1951),<ref name="reds">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|5|1951|litigants=[[Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/5.pdf (1951) 83 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 1]}}.</ref> Latham's last major case.

Apart from the wartime cases, the Latham court also developed the [[Australian criminal law|criminal]] defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact, for example in ''[[Proudman v Dayman]]'' (1941).<ref name="proudman">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|28|1941|litigants=[[Proudman v Dayman]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1941287.pdf (1941) 67 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 536]}}.</ref> It also paved the way for the development of the external affairs power by upholding the implementation of an air navigation treaty in ''[[R v Burgess; Ex parte Henry]]'' (1936).<ref name="burgess">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|52|1936|litigants=[[R v Burgess; Ex parte Henry]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1936/52.pdf (1936) 55 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 608]}}.</ref>

===Dixon court===
[[File:HCA bench 1952.jpg|thumb|The bench in 1952, shortly before Chief Justice Latham's retirement. Back, left to right, [[Wilfred Fullagar|Fullagar]], [[William Webb (judge)|Webb]], [[Dudley Williams (judge)|Williams]] & [[Frank Kitto|Kitto]]. Front, left to right, [[Owen Dixon|Dixon]], [[John Latham (Australian jurist)|Latham]] & [[Edward McTiernan|McTiernan]].]]

Under Chief Justice [[Owen Dixon|Sir Owen Dixon]], who was elevated to that role in 1952 after 23 years as a Justice, the court enjoyed its most successful period, with British judge, [[Master of the Rolls]] [[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]], describing the time as the court's "Golden Age".<ref name="companion Dixon court">{{cite book |last=Zines |first=Leslie |chapter=Dixon Court |title=The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia |editor1-last=Blackshield |editor1-first=Tony |editor2-last=Coper |editor2-first=Michael |editor3-first=George |editor3-last=Williams |editor3-link=George Williams (lawyer) | year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=South Melbourne, Victoria | isbn=0-19-554022-0 }}</ref> Dixon, widely regarded as Australia's greatest judge,<ref>{{cite book | author1=Stephen, Ninian Sir |author-link=Ninian Stephen | title=Sir Owen Dixon : a celebration | year=1986 | publisher=Melbourne University Press | isbn=978-0-522-84330-9 |pages=41 |location=Carlton, Victoria }}</ref> had a commanding personal and legal influence over the court in this time, measurable in the rise in joint judgments (many of which were led by Dixon) and good relations between the Justices.<ref name="companion Dixon court" />

While there were fewer cases which tested the limits of federal power, probably due to the Menzies government which was firmly entrenched in its conservative phase throughout Dixon's tenure, the court did decide several important constitutional cases. Dixon led the court in firmly establishing the [[separation of powers]] for the [[judiciary]] in the [[R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia|''Boilermakers' case'']] (1956),<ref name="boilermakers">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|10|1956|litigants=[[R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia]] |parallelcite=(1956) 94 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 254}}.</ref> and the court also upheld the continuing existence of the federal government's income tax scheme in the [[Victoria v Commonwealth (1957)|''Second Uniform Tax case'']] (1957).<ref name="2nd uniform tax">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|54|1957|litigants=[[Victoria v Commonwealth (1957)|Victoria v Commonwealth]] (Second Uniform Tax case) |parallelcite=(1957) 99 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 575}}.</ref>

During Dixon's time as Chief Justice, the court came to adopt several of the views that Dixon had advanced in minority opinions in years prior. In several cases, the court upheld Dixon's interpretation of [[section 92 of the Constitution of Australia|section 92]] (one of the most troublesome sections of the Constitution), which he regarded as guaranteeing a constitutional right to engage in interstate trade, subject to reasonable regulation. It also followed Dixon's interpretation of [[section 90 of the Constitution of Australia|section 90]] (which prohibits the states from exacting duties of [[excise]]), although both these interpretations were ultimately abandoned many years later.<ref name="companion Dixon court" />

===Barwick court===
[[Garfield Barwick|Sir Garfield Barwick]] came to the court as Chief Justice in 1964. A significant decision of the Barwick court marked the beginning of the modern interpretation of the [[Section 51(xx) of the Australian Constitution|corporations power]], which had been interpreted narrowly since 1909. The [[Strickland v Rocla Concrete Pipes Ltd|Concrete Pipes case]] (1971)<ref name="concrete pipes">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|40|1971|litigants=[[Strickland v Rocla Concrete Pipes Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1971) 124 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 468}}.</ref> established that the federal parliament could exercise the power to regulate at least the trading activities of corporations, whereas earlier interpretations had allowed only the regulation of conduct or transactions with the public.

The court decided many other significant constitutional cases, including the [[New South Wales v Commonwealth (1975)|Seas and Submerged Lands case]] (1975),<ref name="seas & submerged lands">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|58|1975|litigants=[[New South Wales v Commonwealth (1975)|New South Wales v Commonwealth]] (Seas and Submerged Lands case) |parallelcite=(1975) 135 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337}}.</ref> upholding legislation asserting sovereignty over the [[territorial sea]]; the [[Western Australia v Commonwealth (1975)|First]] (1975)<ref name="1st territory senators">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|46|1975|litigants=[[Western Australia v Commonwealth (1975)]] (First Territory Senators' case) |parallelcite=(1975) 134 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 201}}.</ref> and [[Queensland v Commonwealth|Second]] (1977)<ref name="2nd territory senators">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|60|1977|litigants=[[Queensland v Commonwealth]] (Second Territory Senators' case) |parallelcite=(1977) 139 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 585}}.</ref> Territory Senators' cases, which concerned whether legislation allowing for the mainland territories to be represented in the Parliament of Australia was valid; and ''[[Russell v Russell (Australia)|Russell v Russell]]'' (1976),<ref name="russell">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|23|1976|litigants=[[Russell v Russell]] |parallelcite=(1976) 134 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 495}}.</ref> which concerned the validity of the ''[[Family Law Act 1975]]''. The court also decided several cases relating to the historic [[Joint Sitting, Australian parliament, 1974|1974 joint sitting]] of the Parliament of Australia, including ''[[Cormack v Cope]]'' (1974)<ref name="cormack">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|28|1974|litigants=[[Cormack v Cope]] |parallelcite=(1974) 131 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 432}}.</ref> and the [[Victoria v Commonwealth (September 1975)|Petroleum and Minerals Authority case]] (1975).<ref name="pma">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|39|1975|litigants=[[Victoria v Commonwealth (September 1975)|Victoria v Commonwealth]] (Petroleum and Minerals Authority case) |parallelcite=(1975) 134 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 81}}.</ref>

The Barwick court decided several infamous cases on [[tax avoidance and tax evasion]], almost always deciding against the taxation office. Led by Barwick himself in most judgments, the court distinguished between avoidance (legitimately minimising one's tax obligations) and evasion (illegally evading obligations). The decisions effectively nullified the anti-avoidance legislation and led to the proliferation of avoidance schemes in the 1970s, a result which drew much criticism upon the court.<ref name="companion Barwick court">{{cite book |last=Mason | first=Anthony |author-link=Anthony Mason (judge) |chapter=Barwick Court |title=The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia |editor1-last=Blackshield |editor1-first=Tony |editor2-last=Coper |editor2-first=Michael |editor3-first=George |editor3-last=Williams |editor3-link=George Williams (lawyer) | year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=South Melbourne, Victoria | isbn=0-19-554022-0 }}</ref>

===Gibbs court===

[[Harry Gibbs|Sir Harry Gibbs]] was appointed as Chief Justice in 1981. Under his leadership, the court moved away from the legalism and conservative traditions which had characterised the Dixon and Barwick courts.<ref name="companion Gibbs court">{{cite book |last=Twomey |first=Anne |chapter=Gibbs Court |title=The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia |editor1-last=Blackshield |editor1-first=Tony |editor2-last=Coper |editor2-first=Michael |editor3-first=George |editor3-last=Williams |editor3-link=George Williams (lawyer) | year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=South Melbourne, Victoria | isbn=0-19-554022-0 }}</ref>

The Gibbs court made several important decisions in [[Australian constitutional law]]. It allowed the Federal Parliament to make very wide use of the external affairs power, by holding that this power could be used to implement [[treaty|treaties]] into domestic law with very few [[justiciable]] limits. In ''[[Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen]]'' (1982)<ref name="koowarta">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|27|1982|litigants=[[Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen]] |parallelcite=(1982) 153 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 168}}.</ref> four judges to three upheld the validity of the ''[[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]]'', although no single view had majority support. However, in the [[Commonwealth v Tasmania|Tasmanian Dams case]] (1983),<ref name="tas dams">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|21|1983|litigants=[[Commonwealth v Tasmania]] (Tasmanian Dams case) |parallelcite=(1983) 158 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1}}.</ref> a majority of the court upheld federal environmental legislation under the power.

The court also adopted a more expansive interpretation of the corporations power. In the [[Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd|Actors Equity case]] (1982),<ref name="actors & announcers">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|23|1982|litigants=[[Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1982) 150 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 169}}.</ref> the court upheld regulations which, although they did not directly regulate corporations, indirectly protected corporations. In the Tasmanian Dams case, the court indicated that it would interpret the power to uphold legislation regulating the non-trading activities of corporations, although it did not decide the case on that basis. The external affairs power and the corporations power have both been increasingly relied on by the federal government to extend its authority in recent years.<ref name="companion Gibbs court" />

In [[Australian administrative law|administrative law]], the court expanded on the doctrines of [[natural justice]] and [[due process|procedural fairness]] in ''[[Kioa v West]]'' (1985).<ref name="kioa">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|81|1985|litigants=[[Kioa v West]] |parallelcite=(1985) 159 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 550}}.</ref> Although Gibbs himself dissented on those points, he did decide that executive decision makers were obliged to take humanitarian principles into consideration. Outside of specific areas of law, the court was also involved in several cases of public significance, including the [[Chamberlain v The Queen|Chamberlain case]] (1984),<ref name="dingo">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|7|1984|litigants=[[Chamberlain v The Queen]] |parallelcite=(1984) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 521}}.</ref> concerning [[Lindy Chamberlain]], and ''[[A v Hayden]]'' (1984),<ref name="hayden">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|67|1984|litigants=[[A v Hayden]] |parallelcite=(1984) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 532}}.</ref> concerning the botched [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service|ASIS]] [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service#The Sheraton Hotel incident|exercise at the Sheraton Hotel]] in Melbourne.

===Mason court===
[[Anthony Mason (judge)|Sir Anthony Mason]] became Chief Justice in 1987. The Mason court was very stable, with only one change in the bench in its eight years, the appointment of [[Michael McHugh (judge)|Michael McHugh]] after [[Ronald Wilson|Sir Ronald Wilson]]'s retirement. The court under Mason was widely regarded as the most liberal bench in the court's history.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Pierce, Jason Louis | title=Inside the Mason Court revolution : the High Court of Australia transformed | date=2006 | publisher=Carolina Academic Press | isbn=978-1-59460-061-6 }}</ref>

The Mason court made many important decisions in all areas of Australian law. One of its first major cases was ''[[Cole v Whitfield]]'' (1988),<ref name="cole">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|18|1988|litigants=[[Cole v Whitfield]] |parallelcite=(1988) 165 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 360}}.</ref> concerning the troublesome [[Section 92 of the Constitution of Australia|section 92]], which had been interpreted inconsistently and confusingly since the beginning of the court. For the first time, the court referred to historical materials such as the debates of the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Constitutional Conventions]] to ascertain the purpose of the section, and the unanimous decision indicated "a willingness to overturn established doctrines and precedents perceived to be no longer working", a trend which typified the Mason court.<ref name="companion Mason court">{{cite book |author1=Dillon, Michelle |author2=Doyle, John |chapter=Mason Court |title=The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia |editor1-last=Blackshield |editor1-first=Tony |editor2-last=Coper |editor2-first=Michael |editor3-first=George |editor3-last=Williams |editor3-link=George Williams (lawyer) | year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=South Melbourne, Victoria | isbn=0-19-554022-0 }}</ref>

The most popularly significant case decided by the Mason court was the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo case]] (1992),<ref name="mabo">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|23|1992|litigants=[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]] |parallelcite=(1992) 175 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1}}.</ref> in which the court found that the common law was capable of recognising [[native title]]. The decision was one of the High Court's most controversial of all time and represented the tendency of the Mason court to receive "high praise and stringent criticism in equal measure."<ref name="companion Mason court" /> Other controversial cases included the [[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth|War Crimes Act case]] (1991),<ref name="polyukhovich">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|32|1991|litigants=[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]] (War Crimes Act case) |parallelcite=(1991) 172 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 501}}.</ref> regarding the validity of the ''War Crimes Act 1945''; ''[[Dietrich v The Queen]]'' (1992),<ref name="dietrich">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|57|1992|litigants=[[Dietrich v The Queen]] |parallelcite=(1992) 177 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 292}}.</ref> in which the court found that a lack of legal representation in a serious criminal case can result in an unfair trial; ''[[Sykes v Cleary]]'' (1992),<ref name="cleary">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|60|1992|litigants=[[Sykes v Cleary]] |parallelcite=(1992) 176 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 77}}.</ref> regarding the disputed election of [[Phil Cleary]]; and [[Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh|Teoh's case]] (1995),<ref name="teoh">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|20|1995|litigants=[[Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh]] |parallelcite=(1995) 183 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 273}}.</ref> in which the court held that [[ratification]] of a treaty by the executive could create a legitimate expectation that members of the executive would act in accordance with that treaty.

The court developed the concept of implied human rights in the Constitution in cases such as ''[[Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth]]'' (1992),<ref name="aust cap tv">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|45|1992|litigants=[[Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=(1992) 177 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 106}}.</ref> ''[[Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills]]'' (1992)<ref name="nationwide news">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|46|1992|litigants=[[Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills]] |parallelcite=(1992) 177 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1}}.</ref> and ''[[Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Ltd]]'' (1994),<ref name="theophanous">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|46|1994|litigants=[[Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1994) 182 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 104}}.</ref> in which the court recognised an [[implied freedom of political communication]] arising from the nature of the Constitution in laying out a system of [[representative government]].

In other areas of law, the court developed doctrines of [[Equity (law)|equity]] in relation to commercial law and [[Australian contract law|contract law]], in cases such as ''[[Waltons Stores (Interstate Ltd) v Maher|Waltons Stores v Maher]]'' (1988)<ref name="waltons stores">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|7|1988|litigants=[[Waltons Stores (Interstate Ltd) v Maher]] |parallelcite=(1988) 1164 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 387}}.</ref> and ''[[Trident General Insurance v McNiece]]'' (1988),<ref name="trident">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|44|1988|litigants=[[Trident General Insurance v McNiece]] |parallelcite=(1988) 165 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 107}}.</ref> and made significant developments in [[Australian tort law|tort law]], in cases such as ''[[Rogers v Whitaker]]'' (1992)<ref name="rogers">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|58|1992|litigants=[[Rogers v Whitaker]] |parallelcite=(1992) 175 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 479}}.</ref> and ''[[Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd]]'' (1994).<ref name="general jones">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|13|1994|litigants=[[Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1994) 179 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 520}}.</ref>

===Brennan court===
[[Gerard Brennan|Sir Gerard Brennan]] succeeded Mason in 1995. In contrast to the previous court, the Brennan court had many changes in its membership despite being only three years long. The court decided many significant cases.<ref name="companion Brennan court">{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=David |chapter=Brennan Court |title=The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia |editor1-last=Blackshield |editor1-first=Tony |editor2-last=Coper |editor2-first=Michael |editor3-first=George |editor3-last=Williams |editor3-link=George Williams (lawyer) | year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=South Melbourne, Victoria | isbn=0-19-554022-0 }}</ref>

In ''[[Ha v New South Wales]]'' (1997)<ref name="ha">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|34|1997|litigants=[[Ha v New South Wales]] |parallelcite=(1997) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 465}}.</ref> the court invalidated a [[New South Wales]] tobacco licensing scheme, reining in the licensing scheme exception to the prohibition on states levying [[excise]] duties, contained in [[section 90 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 90 of the Constitution]]. While it did not overturn previous cases in which schemes had been upheld, it did emphasise that the states could not stray too far from the constitutional framework.

The Brennan court made a number of significant decisions in relation to the [[judiciary of Australia]]. In ''[[Grollo v Palmer]]'' (1995)<ref name="grollo">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|26|1995|litigants=[[Grollo v Palmer]] |parallelcite=(1995) 184 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 348}}.</ref> and the [[Wilson v Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs|''Hindmarsh Island Bridge case'']] (1998),<ref name="wilson">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|18|1996|litigants=[[Wilson v Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs]] (Hindmarsh Island Bridge case) |parallelcite=(1996) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1}}.</ref> the court developed the [[persona designata]] doctrine, and in [[Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)|''Kable v DPP'']] (1997),<ref name="kable">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|24|1996|litigants=[[Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)]] |parallelcite=(1996) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 51}}.</ref> the court rejected attempts by the [[Parliament of New South Wales]] to establish a system of preventative detention and found that the states do not have unlimited ability to regulate their courts, given the place of state courts within the Australian court hierarchy.

The court decided several cases relating to the implied freedom of political communication developed by the Mason court, notably ''[[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'' (1997)<ref name="lange">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|25|1997|litigants=[[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |parallelcite=(1997) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 520}}.</ref> and the [[Levy v Victoria|''Duck Shooting Case'']] (1997).<ref name="levy">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|31|1997|litigants=[[Levy v Victoria]] (Duck Shooting Case) |parallelcite=(1997) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 579}}.</ref> It also decided several native title cases, including the controversial [[Wik Peoples v Queensland|Wik case]] (1996).<ref name="wik">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|40|1996|litigants=[[Wik Peoples v Queensland]] (Pastoral Leases Case) |parallelcite=(1996) 187 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1}}.</ref>

[[Murray Gleeson]] was appointed Chief Justice in 1998. The court under Gleeson's leadership was generally regarded as more conservative than under Mason or Brennan, favouring legalism in the tradition of the Dixon and Barwick courts.  In the [[Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally|Cross-vesting case]] (1999),<ref name="cross-vesting">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|27|1999|litigants=[[Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally]] (Cross-vesting case) |parallelcite=(1999) 198 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 511}}.</ref> the court struck down legislation vesting state jurisdiction in the Federal Court. In ''[[Al-Kateb v Godwin]]'' (2004)<ref name="al-kateb">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|37|2004|litigants=[[Al-Kateb v Godwin]] |parallelcite=(2004) 219 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 562}}.</ref> a majority of the court applied a narrow interpretation of the ''[[Migration Act 1958]]'', finding that it permitted [[Executive (government)|executively]]-imposed indefinite detention of [[stateless person]]s. However, the court did not entirely shy away from principle and public policy in its decisions.<ref name="companion Gleeson court">{{cite book |last=Zines |first=Leslie |chapter=Gleeson Court |title=The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia |editor1-last=Blackshield |editor1-first=Tony |editor2-last=Coper |editor2-first=Michael |editor3-first=George |editor3-last=Williams |editor3-link=George Williams (lawyer) | year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=South Melbourne, Victoria | isbn=0-19-554022-0 }}</ref>

==Composition of the court==
{{main|List of Justices of the High Court of Australia}}
The High Court of Australia is composed of seven Justices: the Chief Justice of Australia and six other Justices. Their salaries are determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, an independent statutory authority. Since 1 July 2017, the Chief Justice has received an annual salary of $584,520 and the other Justices have received $530,440.<ref>[https://www.sbs.com.au/news/australia-s-top-judges-get-a-pay-rise Australia's top judges get a pay rise], [[SBS News]], 10 October 2017.

===Appointment process===
Appointments are officially made by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General in Council]]. In practice, appointees are nominated by the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], on advice from the Cabinet, particularly from the [[Attorney-General for Australia]]. For example, four Justices were appointed while [[Andrew Fisher]] was Prime Minister, but it was largely on Attorney-General [[Billy Hughes]]' authority that the candidates were chosen.{{sfn|Dixon & Williams (eds)|loc=Ch 5 The Griffith Court by John M Williams p. 83}} Since 1979, the Attorney-General has been required to consult with the attorneys-general of the states and territories of Australia about appointments to the court.<ref>{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|hcoaa1979233|High Court of Australia Act 1979|6}}</ref> The process was first used in relation to the appointment of Justice [[Ronald Wilson|Wilson]], and has been generally successful, despite the occasional criticism that the states merely have a consultative, rather than a determinative, role in the selection process.<ref name="companion HCA Act">{{cite book |last=Durack |first=Peter |chapter=High Court of Australia Act |title=The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia |editor1-last=Blackshield |editor1-first=Tony |editor2-last=Coper |editor2-first=Michael |editor3-first=George |editor3-last=Williams |editor3-link=George Williams (lawyer) | year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=South Melbourne, Victoria | isbn=0-19-554022-0 }}</ref>

There are no qualifications for Justices in the Constitution (other than that they must be under the compulsory retirement age of 70<ref>Section 72 of the Constitution, as amended in 1977, before which there had been no compulsory retirement age.</ref>). The High Court of Australia Act 1979 requires that appointees have been a judge of a federal, state or territory court, or that they have been enrolled as a legal practitioner for at least five years with either the High Court itself or with a state or territory Supreme Court. There are no other formal requirements.<ref name="companion appointment">{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Simon |chapter=Appointment of Justices |title=The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia |editor1-last=Blackshield |editor1-first=Tony |editor2-last=Coper |editor2-first=Michael |editor3-first=George |editor3-last=Williams |editor3-link=George Williams (lawyer) | year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=South Melbourne, Victoria | isbn=0-19-554022-0 }}</ref>

The appointment process stands in stark contrast with the highly public selection and confirmation process for justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. Three Chief Justices (Sir Adrian Knox, Sir John Latham and Sir Garfield Barwick) had previously been conservative politicians prior to their appointment, and there is frequent criticism of Barwick's intervention in the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]], when he gave advice to Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Australian Constitutional Landmarks |editor1=Lee, H.P. |editor1-link=Hoong Phun Lee |editor2=Winterton, G |editor2-link=George Winterton |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |pages=248–50 |isbn=052183158X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YYg4wYomTYC&pg=PA248}}</ref>

On the other side of politics, [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] politicians Dr [[H. V. Evatt]] QC, [[Edward McTiernan|Sir Edward McTiernan]] and [[Lionel Murphy]] QC were also appointed to the High Court; Murphy, Attorney-General in the Whitlam government, was criticised by the conservative side at the time of his appointment but after a decade in office had risen, on occasion, to the heights of Acting Chief Justice. His reputation was gravely damaged in 1985 after an illegal police phone-tap led to him being charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice, but Murphy was eventually acquitted of all charges.<ref>Hocking, Jenny ''Lionel Murphy: A political biography'', Cambridge University Press Melbourne 2000, p 304</ref>

Two future appointments to the High Court were announced on 28 October 2020. [[Simon Steward (judge)|Simon Steward]] will be appointed to the court on 1 December 2020, in place of the retiring [[Geoffrey Nettle]], and [[Jacqueline Gleeson]] will be appointed to the court on 1 March 2021, in place of the retiring [[Virginia Bell]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/federal-court-judges-elevated-to-high-court-as-new-appointments-revealed-20201021-p567cj.html|last=Whitbourn|first=Michaela|title=Federal Court judges elevated to High Court as new appointments revealed|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=28 October 2020|access-date=29 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.afr.com/politics/gleeson-steward-next-high-court-justices-20201021-p567a6|title=Gleeson, Steward next High Court justices|newspaper=Australian Financial Review|date=28 October 2020|access-date=28 October 2020|first1=Ronald|last1=Mizen|first2=Michael|last2=Pelly}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/meet-australias-new-high-court-judges-a-legal-scholars-take-on-the-morrison-governments-appointees-148982?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Latest%20from%20The%20Conversation%20for%20October%2029%202020%20-%201770917172&utm_content=Latest%20from%20The%20Conversation%20for%20October%2029%202020%20-%201770917172+CID_6699ac57fcc7d2dfede9adfa39e59fda&utm_source=campaign_monitor&utm_term=writes|last=McLoughlin|first=Kcasey|title=Meet Australia’s new High Court judges: a legal scholar’s take on the Morrison government’s appointees|website=The Conversation|date=28 October 2020|access-date=29 October 2020}}</ref>

===Initial composition===
[[File:Hca bench and officials 1903.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The first bench of the High Court: Barton, Griffith and O'Connor seated, with court officials in the background. Photo taken at the first sitting of the court on 6 October 1903.]]
The first three justices of the High Court were Chief Justice, Sir Samuel Griffith, Justice Sir Edmund Barton, and Justice Richard Edward O'Connor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/about/history |title=History of the High Court |publisher=High Court |access-date=26 October 2016}}</ref> There were a number of possible candidates for the first bench of the High Court. In addition to the eventual appointees, names which had been mentioned in the press included two future Justices of the court, [[H.B. Higgins|Henry Higgins]] and [[Isaac Isaacs]], along with [[Andrew Inglis Clark]], [[John Downer|Sir John Downer]], [[Josiah Symon|Sir Josiah Symon]] and [[George Wise (Australian politician)|George Wise]]. (Crucially, all of the above had previously served as politicians, with only Griffith and Inglis Clark possessing both political and judicial experience.) Barton and O'Connor were both members of the federal parliament and both from the government benches; indeed Barton was [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]. Each of the eventual appointees had participated in the drafting of the Constitution and had intimate knowledge of it. All three were described as conservative and their jurisprudence was very much influenced by English law, and in relation to the Constitution, by United States law.{{sfn|Dixon & Williams (eds)|loc=Ch 5 The Griffith Court by John M Williams}}

===Expansion of composition===
In 1906, at the request of the Justices, two more seats were added to the bench, with Isaacs and Higgins the appointees. After O'Connor's death in 1912, an amendment to the ''Judiciary Act 1903'' expanded the bench to seven. For most of 1930 two seats were left vacant due to monetary constraints placed on the court by the Depression. The economic downturn had also led to a reduction in litigation and consequently less work for the court. After Sir Isaac Isaacs retired in 1931, his seat was left empty, and in 1933 an amendment to the ''Judiciary Act'' officially reduced the number of seats to six. However, this led to some decisions being split three-all. With the appointment of [[William Webb (judge)|William Webb]] in 1946, the number of seats returned to seven, and since then the court has had a full complement of seven Justices.{{sfn|Dixon & Williams (eds)|loc=pp. 78-80, 118-119, 141-143, 160,161}} {{As of|2015}} there have been 52 Justices, twelve of whom have been Chief Justice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/justices/former-justices |title=Former Justices |publisher=High Court |access-date=26 October 2016}}</ref>

===Recent developments in composition===
Current Justices [[Susan Kiefel]], [[Virginia Bell]] and [[Michelle Gordon (judge)|Michelle Gordon]] are the third, fourth and fifth women to sit on the bench, after Justices [[Mary Gaudron]] and [[Susan Crennan]]. There are three women sitting concurrently on the bench, alongside four men. In 2017, Justice Kiefel became the [[List of the first women appointed to Australian judicial positions|first woman to be appointed Chief Justice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/susan-kiefel-australias-first-female-chief-justice-20170127-gtzzq1.html|title=Susan Kiefel: Australia's first female chief justice|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=30 January 2017|access-date=30 January 2017|first=George|last=Williams}}</ref>

More than half of the Justices, twenty-six, have been residents of New South Wales (with twenty-four of these graduates of [[Sydney Law School]]). Thirteen have been from Victoria, eight from Queensland and four from Western Australia. No Justices have been residents of South Australia, Tasmania or any of the territories. The majority of the Justices have been from [[Protestant]] backgrounds, with a smaller number from [[Catholic]] backgrounds. Sir [[Isaac Isaacs]] was of Polish/[[Jewish]] background and current Justice [[James Edelman]] is also Jewish:<ref>{{cite news |last1=Levi |first1=Joshua |title=Judge and Jewry |url=https://www.jewishnews.net.au/judge-and-jewry/56870 |access-date=28 July 2019 |work=Australian Jewish News |date=1 December 2016}}</ref> they have been the only representatives on the Court of any other faith.  Many Justices have not indicated whether they have religious views.

[[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] was the first openly gay justice in the history of the Court; his replacement, Virginia Bell, is the first lesbian,<ref name="Bell2008">{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/business/story/0,28124,24826156-17044,00.html |title=NSW Supreme Court farewells High Court appointee Virginia Bell |work=The Australian |date=20 December 2008 |access-date=2 March 2012 |author=Pely, Michael }}</ref> who has been an active campaigner for gay and lesbian rights and was one of the participants in the first [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]] in 1978.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/2008/12/17/new-justice-a-78er/3381 |title=New justice a 78'er |last=Dennett |first=Harley |date=17 December 2008 |work=Sydney Star Observer |access-date=10 June 2009 }}</ref>

Almost all judges on the High Court have taken silk as a [[Queen's Counsel|Queen's Counsel (QC)]], [[King's Counsel|King's Counsel (KC)]] or [[Senior Counsel|Senior Counsel (SC)]] before appointment. The exceptions are: Justice [[Hayden Starke|Sir Hayden Starke]], Justices [[Edward McTiernan|Sir Edward McTiernan]], Sir William Webb, [[Cyril Walsh|Sir Cyril Walsh]], Michael Kirby, [[Robert French]] and [[James Edelman]].

From the retirement of [[Ian Callinan]] in 2007 until the appointment of [[Stephen Gageler]] in 2012, every justice of the High Court had prior judicial experience (serving on state supreme courts or the [[Federal Court of Australia]]) for the only time in its history. Although 13 justices of the Court had previously served in state, colonial or federal Parliaments, no parliamentarian has been appointed to the Court since [[Lionel Murphy]]'s appointment in 1975.

===Judges' associates===
The Chief Justice and each of the justices engage associates to assist them in the exercise of their judicial functions.  At present, all members of the High Court engage two associates for one-year terms.  In addition, the Chief Justice is assisted by an employee of the library as a legal research officer.  The role of the associate is broadly equivalent to that of a [[law clerk]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].  Depending on the judge, an associate's responsibilities will typically include legal research, assistance in preparation for oral arguments, [[Tipstaff|tipping]] in court during oral argument, editing judgments and assisting with extrajudicial functions, such as speechwriting.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Katherine|title=Open Chambers: High Court Associates and Supreme Court Clerks Compared |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MelbULawRw/2007/26.html}} (2007) 31(2) Melbourne University Law Review 646.</ref> Associates generally will have graduated with first class honours, at or near the top of their class, from a leading law school.<ref name=associate>{{cite web|title=Applying for an associateship with a Justice of the High Court of Australia|publisher=High Court of Australia|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/employment/applying-for-an-associateship-with-a-justice-of-the-high-court-of-australia }}</ref> Associates will typically also have research experience (and often experience working for a law firm or university or another court).<ref name=associate/> Accordingly, competition for associate positions is very high with hundreds of applications being received annually.<ref name=associate/>

Sir [[Keith Aickin]], Justice [[Stephen Gageler]] and Justice [[James Edelman]] all served as associates at the High Court of Australia to [[Sir Owen Dixon]], [[Sir Anthony Mason]] and Justice [[John Toohey (judge)|Toohey]], respectively.<ref>{{cite news|title=The boy from Sandy Hollow|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-boy-from-sandy-hollow/2009/01/09/1231004286973.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|access-date=3 May 2016|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=10 January 2009|author=Feneley, Rick}}</ref>

In the 1950s, Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] established a plan to develop Canberra and construct other important national buildings. A 1959 plan featured a new building for the High Court on the shore of [[Lake Burley Griffin]], next to the location for the [[Parliament House, Canberra|new Parliament House]] and the [[National Library of Australia]]. This plan was abandoned in 1968 and the location of the Parliament was moved, later settling on the present site on Capital Hill.<ref name="Hull_centenary"/>{{rp|ch 4}}

In March 1968, the government announced that the court would move to Canberra.<ref name="Hull_centenary"/>{{rp|ch 4}} In 1972 an international competition was held attracting 158 entries. In 1973 the firm of Edwards Madigan Torzillo Briggs was declared the winner of the two-stage competition. Architect Chris Kringas was the Principal Designer and Director in charge working with [[Feiko Bouman]]. In March 1975, only one month before construction began, Kringas died, aged 38. Following his death, Feiko Bouman, Hans Marelli and [[Colin Madigan]] supervised the construction of the design.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.cat-vn759843 |title=Papers of Colin Madigan 1900–2002 [manuscript] |work=Catalogue record |publisher=National Library of Australia| access-date=19 October 2007}}</ref> The constructed building is largely identical to the 1973 competition design.

Construction began in April 1975 on the shore of Lake Burley Griffin, in the [[Parliamentary Triangle]]. The site is just to the east of the axis running between Capital Hill and the [[Australian War Memorial]]. The High Court building houses three courtrooms, Justices' chambers, and the Court's main registry, library, and corporate services facilities. It is an unusual and distinctive structure, built in the [[brutalism|brutalist]] style, and features an immense public atrium with a {{convert|24|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-high}} roof. The neighbouring National Gallery was also designed by the firm of Edwards Madigan Torzillo and Briggs. There are similarities between the two buildings in material and style but significant differences in architectural form and spatial concept. The building was completed in 1980 and the majority of the court's sittings have been held in Canberra since then. The High Court was awarded the Canberra Medallion by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 1980. The building was opened by [[Monarch of Australia|Queen Elizabeth II]], on 26 May 1980. The Court and its Principal Registry were immediately transferred to the new building and the first sitting in this location took place in June 1980.<ref name=AHD/>

The building is primarily constructed from [[Bush hammer|bush-hammered]], in-situ, reinforced, off-white concrete as a monolithic structure. The bush-hammering is achieved by constructing the walls using formwork and hammering the concrete when the form work is removed. Large areas of glazing are supported on tubular steel frame structural back-ups. Careful attention has been paid to detailing and the use of controlled natural light in the courtrooms is noteworthy. Internal finishes are rich yet restrained. Flooring is aurisina stone, pirelli rubber or carpet. Wall finishes are concrete, plaster or timber panelling. Ceilings are plywood panelling, timber battened, plaster or concrete. Australian timber is used throughout the building.<ref name=AHD/>

Courtroom 1 is the main courtroom with an imposing timber panelled wall of red tulip oak from Queensland, 17.5 metres high. It also contains a long curved bench and bar table of jarrah timber. Blackwood panels are used in the ceiling. The Courtroom has a sound system reticulated to a room which accommodates court reporting services. It contains a woven tapestry incorporating the badges of the States and the Crest of the Commonwealth. Doors for each of the three courtrooms incorporate a special design, those of Courtroom No. 1 featuring a silvered bronze grid partly recessed and fixed into the laminated plate glass. The theme of the design is a shield, emphasising the Court's function as a protector of the Constitution and the liberties of the citizen. The door handles continue the emblematic design. Courtroom No. 2 is described as the "Working Courtroom", as it is the venue for the majority of hearings. It has similar wall panelling and fittings to No. 1 Courtroom, although the ceiling is of painted moulded plywood. Courtroom No 2 is also used for hearing applications for leave to appeal by video link. It therefore is fitted with special equipment for the transmission and reception of pictures and sound between the Courtroom and other cities in Australia. Courtroom No. 3 has been designed for cases which will be dealt with generally by a single Justice and is the smallest of the three courtrooms. It has a jury box so that a trial can be conducted on the rare occasions that such a case comes before the High Court. The Courtroom has been furnished with coachwood timber with a ceiling mainly of glass that provides a high level of natural lighting.<ref name=AHD/>

Specially commissioned art works complement the public hall as applied finishes or are integrated into the building's detailing. Included are the water feature designed by [[Robert Woodward (architect)|Robert Woodward]], murals by [[Jan Senbergs]] forming an integral part of the public hall, doors at entry to Court 1 designed by [[Les Kossatz]] and [[George Baldessin]] and a wax mural by [[Bea Maddock]] in the public hall outside Courtroom 1. Photographic portraits of all Chief Justices and Justices who have sat on the Court since its inception are displayed along the wall outside Courtroom No. 1.<ref name=AHD/>

The High Court was added to the [[Commonwealth Heritage List]] on 22 June 2004.<ref name=AHD/>

The building has been subject to critical acclaim:
{{quote|With its recessed and projecting forms, the building exploits the plastic characteristics of reinforced concrete. The differing expressions of each facade arise from the internal functions and the external conditions. The building was designed to read clearly from across the lake to the north. The meticulous, hand-worked surfaces of both buildings demonstrate the craft-based attitude to concrete construction shown in Madigan's architecture. This is the most successful elevation and it has been enhanced by imaginative terracing and landscaping, in particular by a generous but gentle cascade that flows beside the pedestrian path to the forecourt.|{{cite book |author=Taylor, J. |year=1990 |title=Australian Architecture since 1960 |pages=93–102 |publisher=[[Australian Institute of Architects|Royal Australian Institute of Architects]] }} }}

The High Court makes itself generally available to the public through its own website.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au |title=Home page|publisher=High Court of Australia |access-date=21 February 2014 }}</ref> Judgment Alerts, available on the Court's website and by email with free subscription, provide subscribers with notice of upcoming judgments (normally a week beforehand) and, almost immediately after the delivery of a major judgment, with a brief summary of it (normally not more than one page).  All of the Court's judgments, as well as transcripts of its hearings since 2009 and other materials, are made available, free of charge, through the [[Australasian Legal Information Institute]]. The Court has recently<!--in 2017?--> established on its website an "eresources" page, containing for each case its name, keywords, mentions of relevant legislation and a link to the full judgment;  these links go to the original text from 2000 onward, scanned texts from 1948 to 1999 and facsimiles from the ''Commonwealth Law Reports'' for their first 100 volumes (1903 to 1959);  there are also facsimiles of some unreported judgments (1906-2002).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eresources.hcourt.gov.au|title=High Court of Australia: eresources|access-date=27 October 2017}}</ref>  Since October 2013, audio-visual recordings of full-court hearings held in Canberra have been available on its website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/cases/recent-av-recordings |title= High Court of Australia: Recent AV recordings |access-date = 21 February 2014 }}</ref>
