==Plot==
In [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], elderly neighbors Miss Montague ([[Julie Walters]]) and Mr. Capulet ([[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]]) despise each other. When they leave their respective gardens, their [[garden gnome]]s and other lawn ornaments come alive. The Montague garden is filled with Blue-hatted gnomes led by Lady Bluebury ([[Maggie Smith]]), and the Capulet garden with Red-hatted gnomes led by Lord Redbrick ([[Michael Caine]]), who share their owners’ feud. In a back alley lawnmower race, Lady Bluebury's son Gnomeo ([[James McAvoy]]) competes against his Red rival Tybalt ([[Jason Statham]]), who cheats to win by destroying Gnomeo's lawn mower. That night, Gnomeo and his best friend Benny ([[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]]) infiltrate the red garden in disguise to take revenge by spray-painting Tybalt's mower, but Benny accidentally triggers a security light. During their escape, Gnomeo ends up in a nearby garden and bumps into a disguised Juliet ([[Emily Blunt]]), daughter of Lord Redbrick, attempting to retrieve a unique Cupid's Arrow [[orchid]]. Romantically fighting over the flower, they discover each other's color before fleeing. Juliet tells her frog-sprinkler friend Nanette ([[Ashley Jensen]]) about her newfound love, which Nanette declares romantically tragic but agrees to keep their secret.

Gnomeo and Juliet continue to meet secretly in the nearby garden, where they encounter a pink [[plastic flamingo]] named Featherstone ([[Jim Cummings]]) who encourages their love. Lord Redbrick pairs Juliet with a Red Gnome named Paris ([[Stephen Merchant]]); uninterested, Juliet distracts him with Nanette, who has feelings for him. Lady Bluebury is distraught after the Reds infiltrate the garden and destroy the plant nurtured by Gnomeo's late father. The Blues urge Gnomeo to take revenge on the Reds, and is about to spray their prized tulips with insecticide when Juliet sees him, and he backs out of the attack. At their next meeting, Gnomeo and Juliet argue until Featherstone stops them, telling them he lost his wife when the couple living in the garden's house broke up and they each took a flamingo.<ref>In ''[[Sherlock Gnomes]]'', the couple are established as being a younger Miss Montague and Mr. Capulet, who reconcile between the events of the films.</ref> Benny sees them and runs into the alleyway, unbeknownst that Tybalt is waiting with his lawnmower; he attempts to run Benny down, and chops off his hat. Gnomeo intervenes, and he and Tybalt fight until the lawnmower runs into the wall, shattering Tybalt. The Reds attack Gnomeo, believing him responsible for Tybalt's death, and Gnomeo ends up in the road. A blue teapot falls from a truck passing Gnomeo, leading everyone to believe Gnomeo was run over. Juliet expresses her love for Gnomeo and attempts to walk out onto the roadway, but Lord Redbrick, who lost her mother, stops her and has Juliet's feet glued to her tower. Gnomeo's [[mushroom]] friend, Shroom, discovers that Gnomeo is still alive, carried off by a dog to a nearby park. He and Featherstone reach the park where Gnomeo climbs onto a statue of [[William Shakespeare]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) and tells him his story. Shakespeare declares Gnomeo's tale similar to his own story of [[Romeo and Juliet]], and that it is likely Gnomeo's will have a tragic ending as well.

Benny uses Miss Montague's computer to order a powerful Terrafirminator lawnmower, seeking revenge on the Reds. The Terrafirminator arrives and initially works well, but goes out of control, destroying both gardens, and gets itself stuck while the gnomes wage a full-scale war. Gnomeo returns to Juliet with Featherstone's help, but the Terrafirminator frees itself. Gnomeo is unable to un-glue Juliet, stuck in the mower's path, and they share a passionate kiss as the lawnmower crashes into the tower and self-destructs. Realizing the consequences of their vendetta, Lady Blueberry and Lord Redbrick end the feud. Gnomeo and Juliet emerge from the ruins as the two clans celebrate. Miss Montague and Mr. Capulet come home to find their backyards a mess and scream at the damage. The Blue and Red gnomes create a new garden and celebrate their newfound peace. Paris and Nanette are in love, Lady Blueberry and Lord Redbrick become best friends, Tybalt is glued back together, Featherstone is reunited with his wife after Benny finds and orders her online, and Gnomeo and Juliet are married on a purple lawnmower, symbolizing the new union of both gnome clans.

==Production==
The film was the original idea of Sprackling and Smith, who sold the spec script to [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney]] through [[Rocket Pictures]]. Disney studio chairman [[Dick Cook]] greenlit the film, under the Disney-owned [[Miramax Films]]. Miramax was later sold by Disney in 2010, but the latter studio retained the rights to the film. [[Starz Animation]] produced and animated the film. After first sitting on the film as it was an animated film not by a Disney animation unit, Disney Studios then opted to release the film through its [[Touchstone Pictures]] banner.<ref>{{cite news |last= D'Alessandro |first= Anthony |title= Johnny Depp Lending His Voice To Paramount/MGM Sequel ‘Sherlock Gnomes’ |url= https://deadline.com/2015/11/johnny-depp-sherlock-gnomes-gnomeo-juliet-1201611396/ |access-date= November 7, 2015 |work= [[Deadline Hollywood]] |date= November 6, 2015 }}</ref> Disney Australian director [[Adam Elliot]] was approached and asked to direct the film, but he rejected the offer due to the film's incompatibility with his style, as well as his lack of experience with CGI.<ref name="Adam Elliot Interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenwize.com/archives/712 |title=Interview with Adam Elliot, writer/director/designer of Mary and Max |publisher=Crickey.com.au |access-date=January 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716022357/http://www.screenwize.com/archives/712 |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>

==Sequel==
In March 2012, it was reported that a sequel titled ''[[Sherlock Gnomes]]'' was in development at Rocket Pictures. Andy Riley and Kevin Cecil, two of the nine writers on the first film, were writing the script for the sequel. Steve Hamilton Shaw and David Furnish produced the film, and Elton John, was an executive producer, and again composed songs for the film. The film featured Sherlock Gnomes, "the greatest ornamental detective" hired by the characters from the first film, to solve the mystery of disappearing gnomes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Mike|title=Rocket Pictures Plots ‘Gnomeo & Juliet’ Sequel, With New Tunes By Elton John|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/03/rocket-pictures-plots-gnomeo-juliet-sequel-with-new-tunes-by-elton-john/|access-date=March 9, 2012|newspaper=Deadline|date=March 8, 2012}}</ref> [[John Stevenson (director)|John Stevenson]], director of ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'', directed the sequel, and [[Johnny Depp]] voiced Sherlock Gnomes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Mike|title=John Stevenson Tapped To Direct ‘Gnomeo & Juliet’ Sequel ‘Sherlock Gnomes’|url= https://www.deadline.com/2012/09/john-stevenson-director-gnomeo-juliet-sequel-sherlock-gnomes-kung-fu-panda/|access-date=September 5, 2012|newspaper=Deadline|date=September 5, 2012}}</ref> The film was released March 23, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Greg|title=Paramount Nudges ‘Sherlock Gnomes’ To Later Release Date|url=https://deadline.com/2017/05/paramount-sherlock-gnomes-release-date-1202103355/|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|accessdate=May 28, 2017|date=May 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526221017/http://deadline.com/2017/05/paramount-sherlock-gnomes-release-date-1202103355/|archive-date=May 26, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>
