==Properties==
[[File:The transcriptome of pluripotent cells..jpg|thumb|The transcriptome of embryonic stem cells]]
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), derived from the blastocyst stage of early mammalian embryos, are distinguished by their ability to differentiate into any embryonic cell type and by their ability to self-renew. It is these traits that makes them valuable in the scientific and medical fields. ESCs have a normal [[karyotype]], maintain high [[telomerase]] activity, and exhibit remarkable long-term [[cell growth|proliferative]] potential.<ref name=sc>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.282.5391.1145|pmid=9804556|title=Embryonic Stem Cell Lines Derived from Human Blastocysts|journal=Science|volume=282|issue=5391|pages=1145–7|year=1998|last1=Thomson|first1=J.

M.|bibcode=1998Sci...282.1145T|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Pluripotent ===

Embryonic stem cells of the inner cell mass are [[Cell potency#Pluripotency|pluripotent]], meaning they are able to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to generate primitive ectoderm, which ultimately differentiates during [[gastrulation]] into all derivatives of the three primary [[germ layer]]s: [[ectoderm]], [[endoderm]], and [[mesoderm]]. These germ layers generate each of the more than 220 [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|cell types]] in the adult human body. When provided with the appropriate signals, ESCs initially form [[precursor cells]] that in subsequently differentiate into the desired cell types. Pluripotency distinguishes embryonic stem cells from [[adult stem cell]]s, which are [[multipotent]] and can only produce a limited number of cell types.

=== Self renewal and repair of structure  ===

Under defined conditions, embryonic stem cells are capable of self-renewing indefinitely in an undifferentiated state. Self-renewal conditions must prevent the cells from clumping and maintain an environment that supports an unspecialized state.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ying |title=BMP Induction of Id Proteins Suppresses Differentiation and Sustains Embryonic Stem Cell Self-Renewal in Collaboration with STAT3 |journal=Cell |volume=115 |issue= 3|pages= 281–292 |year=2003 |pmid= 14636556|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00847-X |last2=Nichols |first2=J |last3=Chambers |first3=I |last4=Smith |first4=A|s2cid=7201396 }}</ref> Typically this is done in the lab with media containing [[fetal bovine serum|serum]] and [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] or serum-free media supplements with two inhibitory drugs ("2i"), the [[MEK inhibitor]] PD03259010 and [[GSK-3 inhibitor]] CHIR99021.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=25288119|year=2014|last1=Martello|first1=G.|title=The nature of embryonic stem cells|journal=Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology|volume=30|pages=647–75|last2=Smith|first2=A.|doi=10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100913-013116}}</ref>

=== Growth ===

ESCs divide very frequently due to a shortened [[G1 phase]] in their [[cell cycle]]. Rapid cell division allows the cells to quickly grow in number, but not size, which is important for early embryo development. In ESCs, [[cyclin A]] and [[cyclin E]] proteins involved in the [[G1/S transition]] are always expressed at high levels.<ref name="Boward">{{cite journal|pmid=26889666|pmc=5201256|year=2016|last1=Boward|first1=B.|title=Concise Review: Control of Cell Fate Through Cell Cycle and Pluripotency Networks|journal=Stem Cells|volume=34|issue=6|pages=1427–36|last2=Wu|first2=T.|last3=Dalton|first3=S.|doi=10.1002/stem.2345}}</ref> [[Cyclin-dependent kinase]]s such as [[CDK2]] that promote cell cycle progression are overactive, in part due to downregulation of their inhibitors.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=15703208|pmc=1073679|year=2005|last1=White|first1=J.|title=Developmental activation of the Rb-E2F pathway and establishment of cell cycle-regulated cyclin-dependent kinase activity during embryonic stem cell differentiation|journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell|volume=16|issue=4|pages=2018–27|last2=Stead|first2=E.|last3=Faast|first3=R.|last4=Conn|first4=S.|last5=Cartwright|first5=P.|last6=Dalton|first6=S.|doi=10.1091/mbc.e04-12-1056}}</ref> [[Retinoblastoma protein]]s that inhibit the [[transcription factor]] [[E2F]] until the cell is ready to enter [[S phase]] are hyperphosphorylated and inactivated in ESCs, leading to continual expression of proliferation genes.<ref name="Boward" /> These changes result in accelerated cycles of cell division.

=== Uses ===

Due to their plasticity and potentially unlimited capacity for self-renewal, embryonic [[Stem-cell therapy|stem cell therapies]] have been proposed for regenerative medicine and tissue replacement after injury or disease. Pluripotent stem cells have shown promise in treating a number of varying conditions, including but not limited to: [[spinal cord injuries]], [[age related macular degeneration]], [[diabetes]], [[neurodegenerative disorders]] (such as [[Parkinson's disease]]), [[AIDS]], etc.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mahla |first1=Ranjeet |title=Stem Cell Applications in Regenerative Medicine and Disease Therapeutics |journal=International Journal of Cell Biology |volume=2016 |date=July 19, 2016 |pages=6940283 |doi=10.1155/2016/6940283 |pmid=27516776|pmc=4969512 }}</ref> In addition to their potential in regenerative medicine, embryonic stem cells provide a possible alternative source of tissue/organs which serves as a possible solution to the donor shortage dilemma. There are some ethical controversies surrounding this though (see '''Ethical debate''' section below). Aside from these uses, ESCs can also be used for research on early human development, certain genetic disease, and ''in vitro'' [[toxicology]] testing.<ref name=sc/>

==Utilizations==

According to a 2002 article in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]'', "Human embryonic stem cells have the potential to differentiate into various cell types, and, thus, may be useful as a source of cells for transplantation or tissue engineering."<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Levenberg | first1 = S. | title = Endothelial cells derived from human embryonic stem cells | doi = 10.1073/pnas.032074999 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 99 | issue = 7 | pages = 4391–4396 | year = 2002 | pmid =  11917100| pmc = 123658| bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.4391L }}</ref>
[[File:MESC EBs.jpg|thumb|Embryoid bodies 24 hours after formation.]]

However, embryonic stem cells are not limited to cell/tissue engineering.

===Cell replacement therapies===

Current research focuses on differentiating ESCs into a variety of cell types for eventual use as cell replacement therapies (CRTs). Some of the cell types that have or are currently being developed include [[cardiomyocytes]] (CM), [[neurons]], [[hepatocytes]], [[bone marrow]] cells, [[Pancreatic islets|islet]] cells and [[endothelial]] cells.<ref name="davila">{{cite journal|pmid=15014205|year=2004|last1=Davila|first1=JC|last2=Cezar|first2=GG|last3=Thiede|first3=M|last4=Strom|first4=S|last5=Miki|first5=T|last6=Trosko|first6=J|title=Use and application of stem cells in toxicology|volume=79|issue=2|pages=214–23|doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfh100|journal=Toxicological Sciences|doi-access=free}}</ref>  However, the derivation of such cell types from ESCs is not without obstacles, therefore current research is focused on overcoming these barriers. For example, studies are underway to differentiate ESCs into tissue specific CMs and to eradicate their immature properties that distinguish them from adult CMs.<ref name="pmid17584049">{{cite journal|year=2007|last1=Siu|first1=CW|last2=Moore|first2=JC|last3=Li|first3=RA|title=Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes for heart therapies|journal=Cardiovascular & Hematological Disorders Drug Targets|volume=7|issue=2|pages=145–52|pmid=17584049|doi=10.2174/187152907780830851}}</ref>

===Drug discovery===

Besides becoming an important alternative to organ transplants, ESCs are also being used in field of toxicology and as cellular screens to uncover new chemical entities (NCEs) that can be developed as small molecule drugs.  Studies have shown that cardiomyocytes derived from ESCs are validated in vitro models to test drug responses and predict toxicity profiles.<ref name="davila" />  ES derived cardiomyocytes have been shown to respond to pharmacological stimuli and hence can be used to assess cardiotoxicity like ''Torsades de Pointes''.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19277978|year=2009|last1=Jensen|first1=J|last2=Hyllner|first2=J|last3=Björquist|first3=P|title=Human embryonic stem cell technologies and drug discovery|volume=219|issue=3|pages=513–9|doi=10.1002/jcp.21732|journal=Journal of Cellular Physiology|s2cid=36354049}}</ref>

ESC-derived hepatocytes are also useful models that could be used in the preclinical stages of drug discovery. However, the development of hepatocytes from ESCs has proven to be challenging and this hinders the ability to test drug metabolism. Therefore, current research is focusing on establishing fully functional ESC-derived hepatocytes with stable phase I and II enzyme activity.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17346923|year=2007|last1=Söderdahl|first1=T|last2=Küppers-Munther|first2=B|last3=Heins|first3=N|last4=Edsbagge|first4=J|last5=Björquist|first5=P|last6=Cotgreave|first6=I|last7=Jernström|first7=B|title=Glutathione transferases in hepatocyte-like cells derived from human embryonic stem cells|volume=21|issue=5|pages=929–37|doi=10.1016/j.tiv.2007.01.021|journal=Toxicology in Vitro}}</ref>

===Models of genetic disorder===
Several new studies have started to address the concept of modeling genetic disorders with embryonic stem cells. Either by genetically manipulating the cells, or more recently, by deriving diseased cell lines identified by prenatal genetic diagnosis (PGD), modeling genetic disorders is something that has been accomplished with stem cells. This approach may very well prove valuable at studying disorders such as [[Fragile-X syndrome]], [[Cystic fibrosis]], and other genetic maladies that have no reliable model system.

[[Yury Verlinsky]], a Russian-American [[medical researcher]] who specialized in [[embryonic|embryo]] and cellular [[genetics]] (genetic [[cell biology|cytology]]), developed [[prenatal diagnosis]] testing methods to determine genetic and [[chromosomal disorders]] a month and a half earlier than standard [[amniocentesis]]. The techniques are now used by many pregnant women and prospective parents, especially couples who have a history of genetic abnormalities or where the woman is over the age of 35 (when the risk of genetically related disorders is higher). In addition, by allowing parents to select an embryo without genetic disorders, they have the potential of saving the lives of siblings that already had similar disorders and diseases using cells from the disease free offspring.<ref name=ChicagoTribune>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-hed-verlinsky-20-jul20,0,1789019.story "Dr. Yury Verlinsky, 1943–2009: Expert in reproductive technology"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808061655/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-hed-verlinsky-20-jul20,0,1789019.story |date=2009-08-08 }} ''Chicago Tribune'', July 20, 2009</ref>

===Repair of DNA damage===
Differentiated somatic cells and ES cells use different strategies for dealing with DNA damage.  For instance, human foreskin fibroblasts, one type of somatic cell, use [[Non-homologous end joining|non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)]], an error prone DNA repair process, as the primary pathway for repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) during all cell cycle stages.<ref name="pmid18769152">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mao Z, Bozzella M, Seluanov A, Gorbunova V |title=DNA repair by nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination during cell cycle in human cells |journal=Cell Cycle |volume=7 |issue=18 |pages=2902–6 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18769152 |pmc=2754209 |doi=10.4161/cc.7.18.6679}}</ref>   Because of its error-prone nature, NHEJ tends to produce mutations in a cell’s clonal descendants.

ES cells use a different strategy to deal with DSBs.<ref name=Tichy>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tichy ED, Pillai R, Deng L |title=Mouse embryonic stem cells, but not somatic cells, predominantly use homologous recombination to repair double-strand DNA breaks |journal=Stem Cells Dev. |volume=19 |issue=11 |pages=1699–711 |date=November 2010 |pmid=20446816 |pmc=3128311 |doi=10.1089/scd.2010.0058 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>  Because ES cells give rise to all of the cell types of an organism including the cells of the germ line, mutations arising in ES cells due to faulty DNA repair are a more serious problem than in differentiated somatic cells. Consequently, robust mechanisms are needed in ES cells to repair DNA damages accurately, and if repair fails, to remove those cells with un-repaired DNA damages.  Thus, mouse ES cells predominantly use high fidelity [[Homology directed repair|homologous recombinational repair (HRR)]] to repair DSBs.<ref name=Tichy />  This type of repair depends on the interaction of the two sister chromosomes{{Verify source|date=June 2020}} formed during S phase and present together during the G2 phase of the cell cycle.  HRR can accurately repair DSBs in one sister chromosome by using intact information from the other sister chromosome.  Cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (i.e. after metaphase/cell division but prior the next round of replication) have only one copy of each chromosome (i.e. sister chromosomes aren’t present).  Mouse ES cells lack a G1 checkpoint and do not undergo cell cycle arrest upon acquiring DNA damage.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hong Y, Stambrook PJ |title=Restoration of an absent G1 arrest and protection from apoptosis in embryonic stem cells after ionizing radiation |journal=Proc.

On January 23, 2009, Phase I clinical trials for transplantation of [[oligodendrocyte]]s (a cell type of the brain and spinal cord) derived from human ES cells into [[spinal cord injury|spinal cord-injured]] individuals received approval from the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), marking it the world's first human ES cell human trial.<ref name="urlFDA approves human embryonic stem cell study - CNN.com">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/01/23/stem.cell/ |title=FDA approves human embryonic stem cell study - CNN.com |access-date= May 1, 2010| date=January 23, 2009}}</ref> The study leading to this scientific advancement was conducted by Hans Keirstead and colleagues at the [[University of California, Irvine]] and supported by [[Geron Corporation]] of [[Menlo Park, CA]], founded by [[Michael D.

Based on the results of the rodent trials, researchers speculated that restoration of myelin sheathes and an increase in mobility might occur.  This first trial was primarily designed to test the safety of these procedures and if everything went well, it was hoped that it would lead to future studies that involve people with more severe disabilities.<ref>Reinberg, Steven (2009-01-23) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/23/AR2009012302168.html FDA OKs 1st Embryonic Stem Cell Trial].

BioTime company Asterias Biotherapeutics (NYSE MKT: AST) was granted a $14.3 million Strategic Partnership Award by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to re-initiate the world’s first embryonic stem cell-based human clinical trial, for spinal cord injury.  Supported by California public funds, CIRM is the largest funder of stem cell-related research and development in the world.<ref name=cal>[http://www.biotimeinc.com/california-institute-of-regenerative-medicine/ California Institute of Regenerative Medicine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024205728/http://www.biotimeinc.com/california-institute-of-regenerative-medicine/ |date=2017-10-24 }}. BioTime, Inc.</ref>

The award provides funding for Asterias to reinitiate clinical development of AST-OPC1 in subjects with spinal cord injury and to expand clinical testing of escalating doses in the target population intended for future pivotal trials.<ref name=cal/>

AST-OPC1 is a population of cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that contains oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). OPCs and their mature derivatives called oligodendrocytes provide critical functional support for nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain. Asterias recently presented the results from phase 1 clinical trial testing of a low dose of AST-OPC1 in patients with neurologically-complete thoracic spinal cord injury. The results showed that AST-OPC1 was successfully delivered to the injured spinal cord site. Patients followed 2–3 years after AST-OPC1 administration showed no evidence of serious adverse events associated with the cells in detailed follow-up assessments including frequent neurological exams and MRIs. Immune monitoring of subjects through one year post-transplantation showed no evidence of antibody-based or cellular immune responses to AST-OPC1. In four of the five subjects, serial MRI scans performed throughout the 2–3 year follow-up period indicate that reduced spinal cord cavitation may have occurred and that AST-OPC1 may have had some positive effects in reducing spinal cord tissue deterioration. There was no unexpected neurological degeneration or improvement in the five subjects in the trial as evaluated by the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) exam.<ref name=cal/>

The Strategic Partnership III grant from CIRM will provide funding to Asterias to support the next clinical trial of AST-OPC1 in subjects with spinal cord injury, and for Asterias’ product development efforts to refine and scale manufacturing methods to support later-stage trials and eventually commercialization. CIRM funding will be conditional on FDA approval for the trial, completion of a definitive agreement between Asterias and CIRM, and Asterias’ continued progress toward the achievement of certain pre-defined project milestones.<ref name=cal/>

==Concern and controversy==
===Adverse effects===
The major concern with the possible transplantation of ESC into patients as therapies is their ability to form tumors including teratoma.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/stem.37|pmid=19415771|title=Deconstructing Stem Cell Tumorigenicity: A Roadmap to Safe Regenerative Medicine|year=2009|last1=Knoepfler|first1=Paul S.|journal=Stem Cells|volume=27|issue=5|pages=1050–6|pmc=2733374}}</ref>  Safety issues prompted the FDA to place a hold on the first ESC clinical trial, however no tumors were observed.

The main strategy to enhance the safety of ESC for potential clinical use is to differentiate the ESC into specific cell types (e.g. neurons, muscle, liver cells) that have reduced or eliminated ability to cause tumors. Following differentiation, the cells are subjected to sorting by [[flow cytometry]] for further purification. ESC are predicted to be inherently safer than [[IPS cells]] created with genetically-integrating [[viral vectors]] because they are not genetically modified with genes such as c-Myc that are linked to cancer. Nonetheless, ESC express very high levels of the iPS inducing genes and these genes including Myc are essential for ESC self-renewal and pluripotency,<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.diff.2010.05.001|title=Myc maintains embryonic stem cell pluripotency and self-renewal|year=2010|last1=Varlakhanova|first1=Natalia V.|last2=Cotterman|first2=Rebecca F.|last3=Devries|first3=Wilhelmine N.|last4=Morgan|first4=Judy|last5=Donahue|first5=Leah Rae|last6=Murray|first6=Stephen|last7=Knowles|first7=Barbara B.|last8=Knoepfler|first8=Paul S.|journal=Differentiation|volume=80|pages=9–19|pmid=20537458|issue=1|pmc=2916696}}</ref> and potential strategies to improve safety by eliminating c-Myc expression are unlikely to preserve the cells' "stemness". However, N-myc and L-myc have been identified to induce iPS cells instead of c-myc with similar efficiency.<ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.stem.2007.12.001|pmid= 18371415|title= C-Myc is Dispensable for Direct Reprogramming of Mouse Fibroblasts|journal= Cell Stem Cell|volume= 2|issue= 1|pages= 10–2|year= 2008|last1= Wernig|first1= Marius|last2= Meissner|first2= Alexander|last3= Cassady|first3= John P|last4= Jaenisch|first4= Rudolf}}</ref>
More recent protocols to induce pluripotency bypass these problems completely by using non-integrating RNA viral vectors such as [[sendai virus]] or [[mRNA]] transfection.

===Ethical debate===
{{Main|Stem cell controversy}}
Due to the nature of embryonic stem cell research, there are a lot of controversial opinions on the topic. Since harvesting embryonic stem cells necessitates destroying the embryo from which those cells are obtained, the moral status of the embryo comes into question. Some people claim that the 5-day old mass of cells is too young to achieve personhood or that the embryo, if donated from an IVF clinic (which is where labs typically acquire embryos from), would otherwise go to medical waste anyway. Opponents of ESC research claim that an embryo is a human life, therefore destroying it is murder and the embryo must be protected under the same ethical view as a more developed human being.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Nancy |last2=Perrin |first2=Jacob |title=Ethical issues in stem cell research and therapy |journal=Stem Cell Research & Therapy |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=85 |date=July 7, 2014 |doi=10.1186/scrt474 |pmid=25157428 |pmc=4097842 }}</ref>

==Techniques and conditions for derivation and culture==

===Derivation from humans===
In vitro fertilization generates multiple embryos. The surplus of embryos is not clinically used or is unsuitable for implantation into the patient, and therefore may be donated by the donor with consent. Human embryonic stem cells can be derived from these donated embryos or additionally they can also be extracted from cloned embryos using a cell from a patient and a donated egg.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mountford|first=JC|title=Human embryonic stem cells: origins, characteristics and potential for regenerative therapy|journal=Transfus Med|year=2008|volume=18|pages=1–12|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3148.2007.00807.x|pmid=18279188|issue=1|s2cid=20874633}}</ref> The inner cell mass (cells of interest), from the blastocyst stage of the embryo, is separated from the trophectoderm, the cells that would differentiate into extra-embryonic tissue. Immunosurgery, the process in which antibodies are bound to the trophectoderm and removed by another solution, and mechanical dissection are performed to achieve separation. The resulting inner cell mass cells are plated onto cells that will supply support. The inner cell mass cells attach and expand further to form a human embryonic cell line, which are undifferentiated. These cells are fed daily and are enzymatically or mechanically separated every four to seven days. For differentiation to occur, the human embryonic stem cell line is removed from the supporting cells to form embryoid bodies, is co-cultured with a serum containing necessary signals, or is grafted in a three-dimensional scaffold to result.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Thomson JA, Itskovitz-Eldor J, Shapiro SS, Waknitz MA, Swiergiel JJ, Marshall VS, Jones JM |title=Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts|journal=Science|year=1998|volume=282|pages=1145–1147|doi= 10.1126/science.282.5391.1145|pmid=9804556|issue=5391|bibcode=1998Sci...282.1145T|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Derivation from other animals===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ES cell derivation.jpeg|thumb|ES cells are derived from the [[inner cell mass]] of the early embryo.  This schematic shows one method of derivation. {{deletable image-caption}}]] -->
Embryonic stem cells are derived from the [[inner cell mass]] of the early [[embryo]], which are harvested from the donor mother animal.  [[Martin Evans]] and [[Matthew Kaufman]] reported a technique that delays embryo implantation, allowing the inner cell mass to increase.  This process includes removing the donor mother's [[ovaries]] and dosing her with [[progesterone]], changing the hormone environment, which causes the embryos to remain free in the uterus.  After 4–6 days of this intrauterine culture, the embryos are harvested and grown in ''in vitro'' culture until the inner cell mass forms “egg cylinder-like structures,” which are dissociated into single cells, and plated on [[fibroblasts]] treated with [[Mitomycin|mitomycin-c]] (to prevent fibroblast [[mitosis]]).  Clonal [[cell lines]] are created by growing up a single cell.  Evans and Kaufman showed that the cells grown out from these cultures could form [[teratoma]]s and [[Embryoid body|embryoid bodies]], and differentiate ''in vitro,'' all of which indicating that the cells are [[pluripotent]].<ref name="Evans M, Kaufman M 1981 154–6"/>

[[Gail R. Martin|Gail Martin]] derived and cultured her ES cells differently.  She removed the embryos from the donor mother at approximately 76 hours after copulation and cultured them overnight in a medium containing serum.  The following day, she removed the [[inner cell mass]] from the late [[blastocyst]] using [[microsurgery]].  The extracted [[inner cell mass]] was cultured on [[fibroblasts]] treated with [[Mitomycin|mitomycin-c]] in a medium containing serum and conditioned by ES cells.  After approximately one week, colonies of cells grew out.  These cells grew in culture and demonstrated [[pluripotent]] characteristics, as demonstrated by the ability to form [[teratoma]]s, differentiate ''in vitro,'' and form [[Embryoid body|embryoid bodies]].  Martin referred to these cells as ES cells.<ref name="Martin G 1981 7634–8"/>

It is now known that the [[Fibroblast|feeder cells]] provide [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] (LIF) and serum provides [[bone morphogenetic proteins]] (BMPs) that are necessary to prevent ES cells from differentiating.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith AG, Heath JK, Donaldson DD, Wong GG, Moreau J, Stahl M, Rogers D| title = Inhibition of pluripotential embryonic stem cell differentiation by purified polypeptides| journal = Nature | volume = 336 | issue = 6200 | pages = 688–690 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3143917 | doi = 10.1038/336688a0| bibcode = 1988Natur.336..688S| s2cid = 4325137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams RL, Hilton DJ, Pease S, Willson TA, Stewart CL, Gearing DP, Wagner EF, Metcalf D, Nicola NA, Gough NM | title = Myeloid leukaemia inhibitory factor maintains the developmental potential of embryonic stem cells | journal = Nature | volume = 336 | issue = 6200 | pages = 684–687 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3143916| doi = 10.1038/336684a0| bibcode = 1988Natur.336..684W | s2cid = 4346252 }}</ref> These factors are extremely important for the efficiency of deriving ES cells.

===Potential method for new cell line derivation===
On August 23, 2006, the online edition of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' scientific journal published a letter by Dr. [[Robert Lanza]] (medical director of [[Advanced Cell Technology]] in Worcester, MA) stating that his team had found a way to extract embryonic stem cells without destroying the actual embryo.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Klimanskaya I, Chung Y, Becker S, Lu SJ, Lanza R | title = Human embryonic stem cell lines derived from single blastomeres| journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7118 | pages = 481–5 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16929302 | doi = 10.1038/nature05142| bibcode = 2006Natur.444..481K| s2cid = 84792371}}</ref> This technical achievement would potentially enable scientists to work with new lines of embryonic stem cells derived using public funding in the USA, where federal funding was at the time limited to research using embryonic stem cell lines derived prior to August 2001.

===Induced pluripotent stem cells===
{{main|Induced pluripotent stem cell}}

The iPSC technology was pioneered by [[Shinya Yamanaka]]’s lab in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]], who showed in 2006 that the introduction of four specific genes encoding [[transcription factors]] could convert adult cells into pluripotent stem cells.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | last1 = Takahashi | first1 = K | last2 = Yamanaka | first2 = S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–76 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16904174 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024 | hdl = 2433/159777 | s2cid = 1565219 | hdl-access = free }}{{open access}}</ref> He was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize along with Sir [[John Gurdon]] "for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent." <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2012/press.html|publisher=Nobel Media AB|date=8 October 2012|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine – 2012 Press Release}}</ref>

In 2007 it was shown that [[pluripotency|pluripotent]] [[stem cell]]s highly similar to embryonic stem cells can be generated by the delivery of three genes (''Oct4'', ''Sox2'', and ''Klf4'') to differentiated cells.<ref>{{cite journal| doi = 10.1038/nature05944| issn = 1476-4687| volume = 448| issue = 7151| pages = 318–324| last1 = Wernig| first1 = Marius| last2 = Meissner| first2 = Alexander| last3 = Foreman| first3 = Ruth| last4 = Brambrink| first4 = Tobias| last5 = Ku| first5 = Manching| last6 = Hochedlinger| first6 = Konrad| last7 = Bernstein| first7 = Bradley E.| last8 = Jaenisch| first8 = Rudolf| title = In vitro reprogramming of fibroblasts into a pluripotent ES-cell-like state| journal = Nature| date = 2007-07-19| pmid = 17554336| bibcode = 2007Natur.448..318W| s2cid = 4377572}}</ref> The delivery of these genes "reprograms" differentiated cells into pluripotent stem cells, allowing for the generation of pluripotent stem cells without the embryo. Because ethical concerns regarding embryonic stem cells typically are about their derivation from terminated embryos, it is believed that reprogramming to these "induced pluripotent stem cells" (iPS cells) may be less controversial. Both human and mouse cells can be reprogrammed by this methodology, generating both human pluripotent stem cells and mouse pluripotent stem cells without an embryo.<ref>{{cite news | title=Embryonic stem cells made without embryos | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN2058175020071121 | date=2007-11-21 | publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>

This may enable the generation of patient specific ES cell lines that could potentially be used for cell replacement therapies.  In addition, this will allow the generation of ES cell lines from patients with a variety of genetic diseases and will provide invaluable models to study those diseases.

However, as a first indication that the [[induced pluripotent stem cell]] (iPS) cell technology can in rapid succession lead to new cures, it was used by a research team headed by [[Rudolf Jaenisch]] of the [[Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], to cure mice of [[sickle cell anemia]], as reported by [[Science (journal)|''Science'' journal's]] online edition on December 6, 2007.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/06/AR2007120602444.html | title=Scientists Cure Mice Of Sickle Cell Using Stem Cell Technique: New Approach Is From Skin, Not Embryos | author=Weiss, Rick | work=[[The Washington Post]]  | date=2007-12-07 | pages=A02}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1152092|pmid=18063756|title=Treatment of Sickle Cell Anemia Mouse Model with iPS Cells Generated from Autologous Skin|journal=Science|volume=318|issue=5858|pages=1920–3|year=2007|last1=Hanna|first1=J.|last2=Wernig|first2=M.|last3=Markoulaki|first3=S.|last4=Sun|first4=C.-W.|last5=Meissner|first5=A.|last6=Cassady|first6=J.

On January 16, 2008, a California-based company, Stemagen, announced that they had created the first mature cloned human embryos from single skin cells taken from adults. These embryos can be harvested for patient matching embryonic stem cells.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7194161.stm | title=US team makes embryo clone of men | author=Helen Briggs | publisher=[[BBC]]  | date=2008-01-17 | pages=A01}}</ref>

===Contamination by reagents used in cell culture===
The online edition of ''Nature Medicine'' published a study on January 24, 2005, which stated that the human embryonic stem cells available for federally funded research are contaminated with non-human molecules from the culture medium used to grow the cells.<ref name=ebert>{{cite journal |last=Ebert |first=Jessica |date=24 January 2005 |title=Human stem cells trigger immune attack |journal=Nature News |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |location=London |url=http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/news/0501/124.htm |doi=10.1038/news050124-1 |access-date=2009-02-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924071349/http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/news/0501/124.htm |archive-date=2010-09-24 }}</ref> It is a common technique to use mouse cells and other animal cells to maintain the pluripotency of actively dividing stem cells. The problem was discovered when non-human [[sialic acid]] in the growth medium was found to compromise the potential uses of the embryonic stem cells in humans, according to scientists at the [[University of California, San Diego]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Martin MJ, Muotri A, Gage F, Varki A |title=Human embryonic stem cells express an immunogenic nonhuman sialic acid |journal=Nat.

However, a study published in the online edition of ''Lancet Medical Journal'' on March 8, 2005 detailed information about a new stem cell line that was derived from human embryos under completely cell- and serum-free conditions. After more than 6 months of undifferentiated proliferation, these cells demonstrated the potential to form derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers both ''in vitro'' and in [[teratoma]]s. These properties were also successfully maintained (for more than 30 passages) with the established stem cell lines.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Klimanskaya I, Chung Y, Meisner L, Johnson J, West MD, Lanza R |title=Human embryonic stem cells derived without feeder cells |journal=Lancet |volume=365 |issue=9471 |pages=1636–41 |year=2005 |pmid=15885296 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66473-2|s2cid=17139951 }}</ref>
