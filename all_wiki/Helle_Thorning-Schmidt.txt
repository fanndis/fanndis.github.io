Thorning-Schmidt led her party into the [[2015 Danish general election|2015 general election]] in which her party increased its share of votes and seats. However, the Social Liberals lost nine seats, leaving the left bloc without enough support to remain in office. Within an hour of the results being declared, she announced her resignation as both Prime Minister and leader of the Social Democrats.

==Personal life==
Thorning-Schmidt married [[Wales|Welsh]] politician [[Stephen Kinnock]] in 1996, becoming the daughter-in-law of [[Neil Kinnock]], former leader of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and European Commissioner, and [[Glenys Kinnock, Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead|Glenys Kinnock]], former British Minister for Europe. She met her husband while they were both attending the [[College of Europe]]. They have two daughters, Johanna and Camilla. Thorning-Schmidt lived in [[Copenhagen]] with their children, while her husband partly resided in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], where he worked as a director for the [[World Economic Forum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14944749 |title=BBC News – Profile: Danish PM-elect Helle Thorning-Schmidt |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=3 August 2010 |accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref> In 2014, he worked for [[London]]-based [[Xyntéo]] as managing director for the "Global Leadership and Technology Exchange",<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stephen Kinnock |url=http://www.xynteo.com/about/people/stephen-kinnock |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025041514/http://www.xynteo.com/about/people/stephen-kinnock |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-10-25 }}</ref> but was elected [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Aberavon (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberavon]] at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election]].

===Religious beliefs===
Although Thorning-Schmidt has been [[Lutheranism#Baptism|baptized]] into the [[Church of Denmark]], she is not [[Confirmation (Lutheran Church)|confirmed]]. She occasionally goes to church but does not believe in [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]], [[salvation]], [[heaven]], or [[hell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://qz.com/334402/these-are-the-religious-beliefs-of-europes-leaders-including-the-atheists/ |title=These are the religious beliefs of Europe’s leaders—including the atheists |author=Kabir Chibber, Jason Karaian |date=28 January 2015 |website=Quartz |accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/kirke-tro/helle-thorning-schmidt-om-tro-og-liv-efter-døden |title=Helle Thorning-Schmidt om tro og liv efter døden |last=Hansen |first=Mette Skov |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=31 January 2015 |language=Danish |trans-title=Helle Thorning-Schmidt on faith and life after death}}</ref>

===Tax affairs===
The [[SKAT (tax agency)|Danish tax authorities (SKAT)]] investigated reports that Thorning-Schmidt's husband, Stephen Kinnock, was guilty of [[tax evasion]]. Kinnock had declared that he was not a resident of Denmark and thus not subject to Danish taxes, while at the same time Thorning-Schmidt had declared, in an application for dispensation for Kinnock to own property in Denmark, that he resided in Denmark "every weekend of the year from Friday through to Monday".<ref name=BBC>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10856352 Danish politics rocked over Kinnock tax status], BBC News 3 August 2010</ref> Thorning-Schmidt attributed the discrepancy to a "big and sloppy error".<ref name=BBC/> On 16 September 2010, Danish tax authorities acquitted the couple and the charges of tax evasion were dropped.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120728142430/http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1061397/revisor-skat-frikender-thorning-i-skattesag/ Revisor: Skat frikender Thorning i skattesag], [[Politiken]] 16 September 2010 {{in lang|da}}</ref>

A week before 15 September 2011 elections to the Danish Parliament, the 2010 decision from SKAT (the taxation department) surfaced in the Danish tabloid ''[[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]]'' The case had been leaked to the newspaper several months previously. It turned out that from 2000 to 2008 Thorning-Schmidt had made use of tax deductions applicable to her husband, even though he was not subject to Danish taxes and had no income in Denmark. The mistake was corrected by SKAT for the three years from 2006 to 2008, and Thorning-Schmidt paid the amount she had saved due to the error. She was however not required to pay the amounts saved for the six years from 2000 to 2005, because of the statutory time limit for liability in such cases.<ref>[http://www.bt.dk/politik/thorning-fik-uberettiget-fradrag-i-seks-aar/ Thorning fik uberettiget fradrag i seks år], [[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]] 17 September 2011</ref>

In November 2011, the daily ''[[Politiken]]'' disclosed that the [[Tax Ministry of Denmark|Tax Ministry]] deputy chief Peter Loft had attended several meetings attending to the Thorning-Schmidt case and had tried to insert comments into the final resolution text. This would be unlawful under Danish law as the Tax Ministry may not interfere with the decisions taken in individual tax cases.<ref>[http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1447272/ministers-hoejre-haand-skrev-afsnit-i-thorning-sag/ Ministers højre hånd skrev afsnit i Thorning-sag] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112125917/http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1447272/ministers-hoejre-haand-skrev-afsnit-i-thorning-sag/ |date=12 November 2011 }}, [[Politiken]] 11 November 2011</ref> This set off a flurry of speculation in the press, as to whether there had been any political pressure from the then government to pursue a stricter course in the tax case. The Tax Minister in the new government, Thor Möger Pedersen, subsequently asked Peter Loft and the director of the revenue service's Copenhagen branch, Erling Andersen, to give a report on the happenings. On 2 December, Pedersen disclosed that he had found such big discrepancies in the two reports that he would set up a commission of inquiry to determine the actual course of events.<ref>[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2011/12/02/093947.htm/ Kommission skal kulegrave skattesag], [[Danmarks Radio|DR]] 2 December 2011</ref>

Further controversy erupted when two days later the tabloid daily, ''[[Ekstra Bladet]]'', reported that they had also been offered the confidential information that was made public during the election campaign. The source of the leak was determined to be Peter Arnfeldt, spin doctor for then Minister for Taxation [[Troels Lund Poulsen]].<ref>[http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1469714/avis-troels-lunds-spindoktor-ville-laekke-thornings-skattepapirer/ Avis: Troels Lunds spindoktor ville lække Thornings skattepapirer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204171731/http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1469714/avis-troels-lunds-spindoktor-ville-laekke-thornings-skattepapirer/ |date=4 February 2012 }}, [[Politiken]] 4 December 2011 {{in lang|da}}</ref> This led to intense media speculation that the former government, and specifically Troels Lund Poulsen, were engaged in leaking confidential tax information and trying to pressure the revenue service into changing its decision in the case, in an active attempt to discredit the opposition leader in the then imminent election. This would constitute a hitherto unseen level of abuse of power in Danish political life. The commission of inquiry that had already been announced two days previously, was broadly supported by the Danish Parliament to also look into whether the former government was involved in, or knew of, the leak.<ref>[http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1470465/undersoegelseskommissionen-ventes-klar-hurtigt/ Undersøgelseskommissionen ventes klar hurtigt] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120716235207/http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1470465/undersoegelseskommissionen-ventes-klar-hurtigt/ |date=16 July 2012 }}, [[Politiken]] 5 December 2011</ref> On the same day, Troels Lund Poulsen announced he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from the Danish Parliament. Peter Arnfeldt has been reported to the police by the Ministry for Taxation. In March 2012, Peter Loft was suspended from his post as deputy chief, for the duration of the two-year investigation period.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120729102954/http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1576103/skatteminister-suspenderer-sin-departementschef/ Skatteminister fritager sin departementschef fra tjeneste], Politiken. 21 March 2012 {{in lang|da}}</ref>

===Selfie controversy===

In December 2013, Thorning-Schmidt, British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and US President [[Barack Obama]] faced criticism on social media that they had behaved inappropriately after posing for a "[[selfie]]" taken with Thorning-Schmidt's mobile phone during [[Death and state funeral of Nelson Mandela|the memorial service]] for the former South African President [[Nelson Mandela]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/1210/492048-barack-obama-david-cameron-nelson-mandela/ |title=Obama and Cameron criticised for memorial 'selfie' |work=RTÉ News |publisher=RTÉ |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=13 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rte.ie%2Fnews%2F2013%2F1210%2F492048-barack-obama-david-cameron-nelson-mandela%2F&date=2014-04-12 |archivedate=12 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=Telegraph-2013-12-11/> Defending her actions, Thorning-Schmidt said, "There were lots of pictures taken that day, and I just thought it was a bit fun. Maybe it also shows that when we meet heads of state and government, we too are just people who have fun."<ref name=Telegraph-2013-12-11>{{cite news|last=Dominiczak|first=Peter|title=Nelson Mandela: Helle Thorning-Schmidt defends David Cameron 'selfie'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/nelson-mandela/10511954/Nelson-Mandela-Helle-Thorning-Schmidt-defends-David-Cameron-selfie.html|accessdate=13 December 2013|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=12 December 2013}}</ref> Cameron said he was being polite when Thorning-Schmidt asked him to take part in the picture. On a previous occasion, Thorning-Schmidt had stopped her car to ask for a picture with the actress [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] after spotting her signing autographs in Oslo.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mason|first=Rowena|last2= Harding|first2= Luke|title=David Cameron and Danish PM brush off criticism of Mandela memorial selfie|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/11/david-cameron-danish-pm-mandela-memorial-selfie|accessdate=13 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 December 2013}}</ref>
