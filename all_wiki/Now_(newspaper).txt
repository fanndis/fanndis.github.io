'''''Now''''' (styled as '''''NOW'''''), also known as '''''NOW Magazine''''', is a free [[alternative weekly newspaper]] and online publication in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toronto's Now newspaper removed from city locations after poking fun at Mayor Rob Ford|first=Charlie|last=Smith|date=March 31, 2011|url=https://www.straight.com/article-384590/vancouver/toronto-now-removed-city-locations-after-poking-fun-mayor-rob-ford|work=[[The Georgia Straight|Straight.com]]}}</ref>

It was first published on September 10, 1981 by [[Michael Hollett]] and [[Alice Klein]]. ''NOW'' is an alternative weekly that covers news, culture, arts, and entertainment.  ''NOW'' is published 52 times a year. The publication can be picked up in subway stations, cafes, variety stores, clothing outlets, restaurants, alternative movie venues, and in its green and red newspaper boxes. ''NOW'' is published every Thursday.

''NOW'' has been online since 1993, first as now.com and then as nowtoronto.com since 2000.

The ''[[Toronto Star]]'' launched ''[[Eye Weekly]]'' in 1991 as a competitor to ''NOW'', although ''NOW'' consistently remained the more widely read publication and ''Eye Weekly'' folded in 2011.

It is also a central sponsor and its owners held an ownership stake in [[North by Northeast]], a major annual [[music festival]] in Toronto.

''NOW'' was privately owned by Hollett and Klein until 2016, when Hollett sold his share of the company to Klein and left the newspaper to focus on North by Northeast as the festival's president and founder.

In 2019, Klein's NOW Communications sold ''NOW'' to Media Central Corporation for $2 million. Klein remained with the newspaper as "Chief Editorial Strategist".<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/now-magazine-sold-two-million-1.5381007 "Startup media company to buy Now magazine for $2 million"].

==Green efforts==
Some of these efforts include the construction of the ''[[Green Roof]]'' in 2006. The roof helps to keep the building temperature regulated while using less energy which aids in keeping pollution low. The plant life, which is a [[sedum]] species, helps to purify the air. The green roof also reduces [[stormwater runoff]] – which can cause sewage backup during periods of deluge. ''NOW'' implements a 100% recycled paper policy and uses only vegetable-based dyes for print. This effort, each year, saves over 28,000 living trees, reduces [[greenhouse gas]]es – the equivalent given off by 534 cars, eliminates 7 swimming pools of waste water and saves 79 garbage trucks worth of solid waste. ''Now'' also partners with Green Enterprise Toronto (GET) and Canopy (formerly Markets Initiative). Both companies are dedicated to responsible business and green initiatives.

''NOW'' is a certified [[B Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bcorporation.net/community/now-magazine|title=Certified B Corporation|date=December 2012|website=[[B Corporation]]}}</ref>
