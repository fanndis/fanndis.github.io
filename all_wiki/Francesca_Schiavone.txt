'''Francesca Schiavone''' ({{IPA-it|franˈtʃɛska skjaˈvoːne}}; born 23 June 1980) is a retired [[Italians|Italian]] [[tennis]] player. She turned professional in 1998 and won the [[2010 French Open]] singles title, becoming the first Italian woman to win a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] event in singles. She was also runner-up at the [[2011 French Open]]. Her career-high ranking is world No. 4, achieved on 31 January 2011. To date, Schiavone is the last one-handed-[[backhand]] player to win a Grand Slam title on the women's tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/news/20100605/francesca-french-open-champion_2256076_2065226|title=Ann Jones was 30 years, 8 months when she won Wimbledon in 1969}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rolandgarros.com/en-us/article/roland-garros-2018-celebrations-start-early-for-schiavone|title=Celebrations start early for Schiavone - Roland-Garros - The 2018 French Open official site}}</ref>

She won eight [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] singles titles in total, including Roland Garros. In doubles, her career-high ranking is world No. 8, peaking with an appearance in the final of the [[2008 French Open]]. Furthermore, she helped [[Italy Fed Cup team|Italy]] to win the [[Fed Cup]] in 2006, 2009 and 2010, and has the most wins for the Italian team.

Schiavone played in the longest ever women's singles match at a Grand Slam tournament, when she defeated [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] 6–4, 1–6, 16–14 in the fourth round of the [[2011 Australian Open – Women's Singles|2011 Australian Open women's singles]] draw, the match lasted 4 hours and 44 minutes and in the process secured her first and only quarterfinal at the Australian Open.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/aus11/columns/story?columnist=ubha_ravi&id=6050468|title=Record-setter headlines crazy day|publisher=ESPN|first=Ravi|last=Ubha|date=23 January 2011|access-date=14 May 2018}}</ref>

On 5 September 2018, Schiavone announced her retirement from tennis at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. During the announcement, she shared aspirations of winning a Grand Slam as a coach.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2018-09-05/2018-09-05_francesca_schiavone_announces_retirement_at_us_open.html|title=Francesca Schiavone announces retirement at US Open|publisher=U.S. Open|date=5 September 2018|access-date=5 Sep 2018}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Schiavone was born in [[Milan]] to Franco Schiavone, from [[Manocalzati]] in the [[Province of Avellino]], [[Campania]], Southern Italy, and to Luiscita Minelli, from Bornato in the [[Province of Brescia]], Northern Italy.

==Playing style==
Schiavone employs an all-court game and has a very classic approach to her clay game. She uses an extreme eastern grip on her one-handed [[backhand]]. [[Chris Fowler]] and [[Brad Gilbert]] described her forehand as a "buggy whip."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/news/articles/2011-01-23/201101231295784229660.html |title=Schiavone outlasts Kuznetsova in record-breaking duel |date=23 January 2011 |author=Darren Saligari |publisher=australianopen.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629150502/http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/news/articles/2011-01-23/201101231295784229660.html |archive-date=29 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>

==Professional career==
Schiavone won eight singles titles on the [[WTA Tour]] and also achieved eleven runner-up positions, eight of them since the autumn of 2005. She lost her first eight career finals before finally winning her first title in July 2007. She and her Italian teammates [[Mara Santangelo]], [[Flavia Pennetta]] and [[Roberta Vinci]] beat the [[Belgium Fed Cup team|Belgian team]] 3–2 in the [[2006 Fed Cup]] final. [[Justine Henin]] had to retire in the fifth and final match due to an injury in her right knee, which let [[Italy Fed Cup team|Italy]] win their first [[Fed Cup]] trophy.<ref>[http://www.fedcup.com/news/matchreport.asp?articleid=10986 Italy wins the Fed Cup for the first time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930231906/http://www.fedcup.com/news/matchreport.asp?articleid=10986 |date=30 September 2007 }}, FedCup, 17 September 2006</ref> This match was a doubles match and [[Kirsten Flipkens]] partnered Henin, and Roberta Vinci partnered Schiavone. In 2009, she won the Fed Cup with Italy for the second time against the US, and also made the quarterfinals of Wimbledon for the first time. In 2010, Italy with Schiavone won the Fed Cup for the third time.

In addition, she realized a notable victory during the quarterfinals of the 2008 Dubai Open, when she upset world No. 1 and four-time champion Henin 7–6, 7–6. She also beat [[Amélie Mauresmo]] in a Fed Cup tie in 2006 when Mauresmo was ranked No. 1.

Partnering with Australian [[Casey Dellacqua]], Schiavone was the runner-up in the women's doubles competition at the [[2008 French Open]] where they lost to [[Anabel Medina Garrigues]] and [[Virginia Ruano Pascual]]. Schiavone also reached the semifinals of the doubles event at the other three Grand Slam tournaments.

===2010: First major title at Roland Garros===
At the [[2010 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Francesca defeated Frenchwomen [[Alizé Cornet]] 0–6, 7–5, 6–0, and [[Julie Coin]] 6–3, 6–4 first before upsetting No. 10 seed [[Agnieszka Radwańska]] 6–2, 6–2. Though she matched her best results there (round four), she went on to lose to No. 6 seed [[Venus Williams]] after winning the first set, 6–3, 2–6, 1–6.

She beat [[Alberta Brianti]], [[Tathiana Garbin]], [[Carla Suárez Navarro]], [[Yaroslava Shvedova]], and Roberta Vinci all in straight sets to win her third WTA title at the [[2010 Barcelona Ladies Open|Barcelona Ladies Open]].

Seeded 17th entering the [[2010 French Open|French Open]], Schiavone was lightly regarded as a contender for the championship. She defeated [[Regina Kulikova]], [[Sophie Ferguson]], 11th seed [[Li Na (tennis)|Li Na]], and 30th seed [[Maria Kirilenko]] to reach her first French Open quarterfinal since 2001 (where she had lost to [[Martina Hingis]]). There, she defeated world No. 3, [[Caroline Wozniacki]], in straight sets to become the first Italian woman to reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam singles event.

The semifinals of the French Open consisted of four players ([[Jelena Janković]], [[Elena Dementieva]], [[Samantha Stosur]] and Schiavone) who had never won a Grand Slam singles event; nevertheless, most in the tennis community, including ESPN's tennis commentary team of [[Mary Joe Fernández]], [[Patrick McEnroe]], and [[Brad Gilbert]] singled out Schiavone as the one player who was not a serious contender to win the title. In the semifinals, Schiavone defeated world No. 5 and 2004 finalist, Dementieva (she retired in the second set with a torn calf muscle having lost the first set in a tiebreaker), and the victory made Schiavone the first Italian woman to reach a Grand Slam final, and assured that she would become a top-ten player for the first time following the tournament.

In the final, Schiavone faced Stosur in a rematch of their first-round meeting at the 2009 French Open which Stosur had won easily (6–4, 6–2). Because of this previous result, and Stosur's victories over four-time French Open champion Justine Henin, world No. 1 [[Serena Williams]] and world No. 4 Janković en route to the final, Stosur was considered a heavy favorite-. However, on 5 June 2010, Schiavone defied expectations to become the first Italian woman to win a Grand Slam singles title, beating Stosur 6–4, 7–6.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/8723949.stm|title=Italy's Francesca Schiavone wins French Open title|date=5 June 2010|work=BBC Sport|access-date=5 June 2010|first=Piers|last=Newbery}}</ref> The victory made her only the third Italian player to win a Grand Slam event in singles, after [[Nicola Pietrangeli]] and [[Adriano Panatta]]. She also became the oldest woman to win a first Grand Slam title in the Open Era, beating the previous record by [[Jana Novotná]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rao|first1=Prashant S.|last2=Cowell|first2=Alan|title=Jana Novotna, Czech Winner of Wimbledon, Dies at 49|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/obituaries/jana-novotna-dead.html|work=The New York Times|date=20 November 2017}}</ref> The victory also meant she rose to No. 6 in the world rankings on 7 June 2010 and became the highest-ranked Italian woman ever, after Flavia Pennetta reached world No. 10 in 2009.

Schiavone's next event was Eastbourne, where she lost in the first round to [[Sorana Cîrstea]], 5–7, 3–6. As the fifth seed at [[2010 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], due to the pre-tournament withdrawal of Dementieva, she lost to [[Vera Dushevina]] in the first round, 7–6, 5–7, 1–6.

Schiavone reached the quarterfinals of the [[2010 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]], where she fell to top seed Caroline Wozniacki. She was the sixth seed at the [[2010 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], and defeated [[Ayumi Morita]], [[Maria Elena Camerin]], 29th seed [[Alona Bondarenko]], and 20th seed [[Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova]] to advance to the quarterfinals for the first time since 2003 (where she had lost to [[Jennifer Capriati]]). In the quarterfinals, she fell to seven-time Grand Slam singles champion No. 3 seed Venus Williams 6–7, 4–6.

As the fifth seed, Schiavone reached the semifinals of the [[2010 Toray Pan Pacific Open|Pan Pacific Open]], where she fell to seventh seed Elena Dementieva. At the season-ending [[2010 WTA Tour Championships – Singles|Tour Championships]], Schiavone competed for the first time in her career but was eliminated in the round-robin stage. She fell to Caroline Wozniacki in three sets, and Sam Stosur in two sets before defeating Elena Dementieva in what would be Dementieva's final career match.

===2011===
Schiavone began the year at the Hopman Cup representing Italy. In singles, she defeated [[Laura Robson]], but fell to [[Bethanie Mattek-Sands]]. Schiavone retired with an injury against [[Kristina Mladenovic]].

Seeded sixth at the [[2011 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Schiavone advanced to the quarterfinals for the first time in her career upon a victory over 23rd-seeded and two-time Grand Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova. The fourth-round encounter lasted [[Longest tennis match records#Women 2|nearly five hours]] (4:44; 47 games in total), and Schiavone saved six match points before finally prevailing 6–4, 1–6, 16–14. With this win, Schiavone rose in the rankings to world No. 4 after the tournament, the highest ranking ever achieved by an Italian woman, improving her own record. In the quarterfinal against world No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki, Schiavone was a set and 3–1 up in the second set, but was broken twice by Wozniacki in the same set and twice in the third, to lose 6–3, 3–6, 3–6 after saving three match points.

At the [[2011 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai Tennis Championships]], Schiavone was seeded third, but fell in the round of 16 to Kuznetsova. At the [[2011 Qatar Ladies Open|Qatar Ladies Open]] in Doha, she fell to [[Peng Shuai]] in the round of 16. She then fell to eventual champion [[Jelena Dokic]] at the [[2011 BMW Malaysian Open|Malaysian Open]]. Schiavone then reached the round of 16 again at the [[2011 BNP Paribas Open|BNP Paribas Open]] in [[Indian Wells, California|Indian Wells]], falling to [[Shahar Pe'er]]. Seeded fifth at the [[2011 Sony Ericsson Open|Sony Ericsson Open]] in Miami, she reached the round of 16, losing to [[Agnieszka Radwańska]].

Schiavone began her clay-court season with a round of 16 loss to Radwańska at the [[2011 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]]. She then reached the round of 16 at the [[2011 Mutua Madrid Open|Mutua Madrid Open]], falling to Mattek-Sands. Following Madrid, Schiavone reached the quarterfinals of the [[2011 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Internazionali BNL d'Italia]], losing to world No. 7, Sam Stosur, in a rematch of the 2010 French Open final. She then lost to world No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki, in three sets during the semifinals of the [[2011 Brussels Open|Brussels Open]], the last tournament before the French Open.

Schiavone was the fifth seed and defending champion at the [[2011 French Open|French Open]]. She beat [[Melanie Oudin]], [[Vesna Dolonts]], 29th seed Peng Shuai, tenth seed Jelena Janković, 14th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, and 11th seed [[Marion Bartoli]] to reach the final where she lost to Li Na, 4–6, 6–7.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/13655477.stm|title=BBC Sport – French Open: China's Li Na beats Schiavone to win title|last=Newbery|first=Piers|work=[[BBC Online]]|access-date=4 June 2011|date=4 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/06/li-na-french-open-champion|title=Li Na of China keeps feet on ground after historic French Open victory|work=Guardian|access-date=7 June 2011|location=London|first=Simon|last=Cambers}}</ref>

Schiavone struggled whilst representing Italy at Fed Cup versus Ukraine, losing to a non-top-100 player [[Lesia Tsurenko]] comprehensively 1–6, 2–6 and barely getting past [[Kateryna Bondarenko]], 6–7, 7–5, 6–4. Despite her struggles, Italy still managed to progress through to the semifinals.

Schiavone played in the mini gulf series in Doha and Dubai losing early in both of them as the seventh seed; Doha in the second round to Yanina Wickmayer 4–6, 6–7 and in her Dubai opener to [[Ana Ivanovic]] 1–6, 5–7.

With the same seeding in Miami, she lost to [[Ksenia Pervak]] 4–6, 6–4, 4–7 in her opener, blowing a 3–0 final-set lead.

After lackluster results, the clay-court season was a chance for Schiavone to get back on form on her favorite surface, but as the top seed at the Barcelona Ladies Open, her poor form continued as she lost to Olga Govorstova, 4–6, 3–6 in her opening match. She represented Italy in Fed Cup semifinals against Czech Republic, losing both of her matches to Lucie Šafářová, 6–7, 1–6, and to [[Petra Kvitová]], 4–6, 6–7. Italy lost the tie 1–4.

She also lost her opener in Madrid to [[Varvara Lepchenko]] and Rome to Ekaterina Makarova. However, Schiavone finally found some form going into the French Open, winning Strasbourg by defeating Sloane Stephens and Alizé Cornet in the semifinals and finals, respectively.

Schiavone reached the third round of [[2012 French Open|French Open]], where she lost to Varvara Lepchenko, 6–3, 3–6, 6–8.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/tennis/french12/story/_/id/8000236/2012-french-open-francesca-schiavone-ousted-unseeded-varvara-lepchenko-us|title=Francesca Schiavone|access-date=4 June 2012}}</ref>
