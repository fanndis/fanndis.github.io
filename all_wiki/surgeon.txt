In modern [[medicine]], a '''surgeon''' is a [[physician]] who performs [[surgery]]. There are also surgeons in [[podiatry]], [[dentistry]], [[orthodontics]], and [[veterinary medicine]].

==History==
[[File:Albucasis.gif|thumb|[[Al-Zahrawi]], the [[Islamic Golden Age]] physician widely considered one of the '"[[Father of surgery|Fathers of Modern Surgery]]"]]
The first person to document a surgery was the 6th century BC Indian physician-surgeon, [[Sushruta]] or Suśruta. He specialized in cosmetic plastic surgery and even documented an open [[rhinoplasty]] procedure.<ref name="auto">Ira D. Papel, John Frodel, ''Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery''</ref> His [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''Suśruta-saṃhitā'' is one of the most important surviving ancient treatises on medicine and is considered a foundational text of both [[Ayurveda]] and surgery. The treatise addresses all aspects of general medicine, but the translator G. D. Singhal dubbed Sushruta "the father of surgical intervention" on account of the extraordinarily accurate and detailed accounts of surgery to be found in the work.<ref>{{cite book|title=Diagnostic considerations in ancient Indian surgery: (based on Nidāna-Sthāna of Suśruta Saṁhitā)|last=Singhal|first=G. D.|publisher=Singhal Publications|year=1972|location=Varanasi}}</ref> 

After the eventual decline of the Sushruta School of Medicine in India, surgery was largely ignored until the [[Islamic Golden Age]] surgeon [[Al-Zahrawi]] (936-1013) re-established surgery as an effective medical practice. He is considered the greatest medieval surgeon to have appeared from the Islamic World, and has also been described as the [[father of surgery]].<ref name=Ahmad>{{citation|last=Ahmad|first=Z. ([[St Thomas' Hospital]])|title=Al-Zahrawi - The Father of Surgery|journal=ANZ Journal of Surgery|year=2007|volume=77|issue=Suppl. 1|doi=10.1111/j.1445-2197.2007.04130_8.x|pages=A83}}</ref> His greatest contribution to medicine is the ''[[Al-Tasrif|Kitab al-Tasrif]]'', a thirty-volume encyclopedia of medical practices.<ref name="al-ZahrāwīStudies1973">{{cite book|last1=al-Zahrāwī|first1=Abū al-Qāsim Khalaf ibn ʻAbbās|last2=Studies|first2=Gustave E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern|title=Albucasis on surgery and instruments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjVra87nRScC&pg=PR8|access-date=16 May 2011|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01532-6}}</ref> 
He was the first physician to describe an [[ectopic pregnancy]], and the first physician to identify the hereditary nature of [[haemophilia]].<ref name="MedievalLife" /> 

His pioneering contributions to the field of surgical procedures and instruments had an enormous impact on surgery but it was not until the 18th century that surgery emerged as a distinct medical discipline in England.<ref name="MedievalLife">{{cite book|title=Handbook to Life in the Medieval World|first1=Madeleine Pelner|last1=Cosman|first2=Linda Gale|last2=Jones|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|year=2008|series=Handbook to Life Series|volume=2|isbn=0-8160-4887-8|pages=528–530}}</ref>

In Europe, surgery was mostly associated with barber-surgeons who also used their hair-cutting tools to undertake surgical procedures, often at the battlefield and also for their employers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/medicine/surgeons-and-surgical-spaces#the-barbers-shop|title=Surgeons and Surgical Spaces #The barbers shop|website=sciencemuseum.org.uk|access-date=2020-05-05}}</ref> With advances in medicine and physiology, the professions of barbers and surgeons diverged; by the 19th century barber-surgeons had virtually disappeared, and surgeons were almost invariably qualified doctors who had specialized in surgery. [[Military surgeon|Surgeon]] continued, however, to be used as the title for military medical officers until the end of the 19th century, and the title of [[Surgeon General]] continues to exist for both senior military medical officers and senior government public health officers.

==Titles in the Commonwealth==
In 1950, the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] (RCS) in [[London]] began to offer surgeons a formal status via RCS membership. The title ''Mister'' became a badge of honour, and today, in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]], a qualified doctor who, after at least four years' training, obtains a surgical qualification (formerly [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons]], but now also [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|Member of the Royal College of Surgeons]] or a number of other diplomas) is given the honour of being allowed to revert to calling themselves [[Mr]], [[Miss]], [[Mrs]] or [[Ms.|Ms]] in the course of their professional practice, but this time the meaning is different. It is sometimes assumed that the change of title implies [[Consultant (medicine)|consultant]] status (and some mistakenly think non-surgical consultants are Mr too), but the length of postgraduate medical training outside North America is such that a qualified surgeon may be years away from obtaining such a post: many doctors previously obtained these qualifications in the senior house officer grade, and remained in that grade when they began sub-specialty training. The distinction of Mr (etc.) is also used by surgeons in the [[Republic of Ireland]], some states of [[Australia]], [[Barbados]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], and some other Commonwealth countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/patients/the-surgical-team/qualifications-of-a-surgeon#three|title=Patients: The Surgical Team: Qualifications of a surgeon|publisher=[[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]|access-date=13 June 2015}}</ref>

==Military titles==
In many English-speaking countries the [[Military surgeon|''military'' title of surgeon]] is applied to any medical practitioner, due to the historical evolution of the term. The [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|US Army Medical Corps]] retains various surgeon [[United States military occupation code]]s in the ranks of [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] pay grades, for military personnel dedicated to performing surgery on wounded soldiers.

Some physicians who are [[general practitioner]]s or specialists in [[family medicine]] or [[emergency medicine]] may perform limited ranges of minor, common, or emergency surgery. [[Anesthesia]] often accompanies surgery, and [[anesthesiologist]]s and [[nurse anesthetists]] may oversee this aspect of surgery. [[Surgeon's assistant]], [[Surgical nursing|surgical nurses]], [[surgical technologist]]s are trained professionals who support surgeons.

In the United States, the Department of Labor description of a surgeon is "a physician who treats diseases, injuries, and deformities by invasive, minimally-invasive, or non-invasive surgical methods, such as using instruments, appliances, or by manual manipulation".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes291067.htm|title=Occupational Employment Statistic: Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2015: 29-1067 Surgeons|website=bls.gov|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref>
