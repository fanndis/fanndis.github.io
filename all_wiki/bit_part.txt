A '''bit part''' is a role in which there is direct interaction with the principal [[actors]] and no more than five lines of dialogue, often referred to as a five-or-less or [[under-five]] in the United States, or '''under sixes''' in [[United Kingdom|British]] television.

A bit part is higher than that of an extra and lower than that of a [[supporting actor]]. An actor who regularly performs in bit roles, either as a [[hobby]] or to earn a living, is referred to as a '''bit player''', a term also used to describe an aspiring actor who has not yet broken into supporting or leading roles.

Unlike [[Extra (acting)|extras]], who do not typically interact with principals, actors in bit parts are sometimes listed in the [[Motion picture credits|credits]]. An exception to this practice is the [[cameo appearance]], wherein a well-known actor or other [[celebrity]] appears in a bit part; it is common for such appearances to be uncredited.

In [[MGM]]'s 1951 screen version of the musical ''[[Show Boat]]'', the role of the cook Queenie ([[Frances E. Williams]]) was reduced from a significant [[supporting role]] in the [[Stage (theatre)|stage version]] to a bit part in the film. Williams, whose appearance was not intended as a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]], was not listed at all in the credits. On the other hand, [[William Warfield]], whose role as Joe, Queenie's husband, was also drastically shortened in the film from the stage original, did receive screen credit because he sang ''[[Ol' Man River]]''.

Bit parts are often significant in the story line and sometimes pivotal, as in [[Jack Albertson]]'s role as a postal worker in the 1947 [[feature film]] ''[[Miracle on 34th&nbsp;Street]]''. Some characters with bit parts attract significant attention. [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] remarked that "there are no small parts, only small actors."<ref name="stanislavski quote">{{cite web|last1=Hooton|first1=Christopher|title=The actors consistently choosing the best movies|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/the-actors-consistently-choosing-the-best-movies-a7210771.html|website=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=18 October 2016|location=London|date=26 August 2016}}</ref>

[[Dabbs Greer]], a bit actor, once said, "Every [[character actor]], in their own little sphere, is the lead."<ref name="dabbs greer">{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Valerie J.|title=Dabbs Greer, 90; busy character actor played everyman-type roles|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/01/local/me-greer1|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=18 October 2016|date=1 May 2007}}</ref>
