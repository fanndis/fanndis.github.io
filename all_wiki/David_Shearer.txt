===Labour Party leadership election, 2011===
{{Main|2011 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election}}
In December 2011, following the resignation of [[Phil Goff]], Shearer contested for leadership of the Labour Party. His opponents were [[David Cunliffe]] and [[David Parker (New Zealand politician)|David Parker]]. Shearer was viewed as unlikely to win the election; Claire Trevett of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' originally expected that only Cunliffe and Parker would run for the leader's role,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.odt.co.nz/source/apnz/188589/labourleadership29 |title=Parker edges ahead of Cunliffe in leadership race |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |publisher=[[Allied Press]] |date=29 November 2011 |first=Claire |last=Trevett |accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref> and ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]''{{'s}} Vernon Small wrote that "Mr Shearer's bid is seen as a way to lift his profile".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/election-2011/6058327/Who-is-backing-whom-in-Labour-battle |title=Who is backing whom in Labour battle? |first=Vernon |last=Small |work=The Dominion Post |publisher=Fairfax New Zealand |date=30 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JB8Ed3AP?url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/election-2011/6058327/Who-is-backing-whom-in-Labour-battle |archivedate=27 August 2013 |access-date=26 August 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 9 December, Horizon Research released a demographically-weighted survey which found that 35.4% of adult New Zealanders supported Shearer's bid for the leadership, and 19.9% backed Cunliffe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.horizonpoll.co.nz/page/195/public-back- |title=Public back Shearer over Cunliffe for Labour leadership |publisher=Horizon Research |date=9 December 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}</ref>

On 13 December, Shearer was elected by the Labour [[caucus]]. Both ''[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> Espiner and ''[[3 News]]'' reported that Shearer received about twenty-two of the thirty-four votes for the leadership position;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/labour-s-new-leader-i-m-up-job-4632281 |title=Labour's new leader: I'm up to the job |work=One News |publisher=Television New Zealand |date=13 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6479cfbZm?url=http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/labour-s-new-leader-i-m-up-job-4632281 |archivedate=22 December 2011 |access-date=22 December 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Shearer-routs-Cunliffe-for-Labour-leadership/tabid/419/articleID/236418/Default.aspx |title=Shearer routs Cunliffe for Labour leadership |work=3 News |publisher=MediaWorks New Zealand |first=Duncan |last=Garner |date=13 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215043229/http://www.3news.co.nz/Shearer-routs-Cunliffe-for-Labour-leadership/tabid/419/articleID/236418/Default.aspx |archivedate=15 December 2013 |access-date=8 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> however, Party President [[Moira Coatsworth]] stipulated that the election was [[secret ballot|secret]] and that she was the only person who had access to the ballot papers, which were destroyed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Secret-caucus-ballot-will-stay-secret/tabid/419/articleID/236391/Default.aspx |title=Secret caucus ballot will stay secret |work=3 News |publisher=MediaWorks New Zealand |date=13 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6479ys5Zy?url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Secret-caucus-ballot-will-stay-secret/tabid/419/articleID/236391/Default.aspx |archivedate=22 December 2011 |access-date=22 December 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

{{see also|Shadow Cabinet of David Shearer }}
[[File:David Shearer, 2012.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Shearer addresses [[NetHui]], July 2012]]
Political commentators opined that Shearer was moving the Labour Party towards the [[centrism|centre]].<ref>{{cite news |title=What David Shearer must do next |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/6634470/What-David-Shearer-must-do-next |accessdate=8 May 2020 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=25 March 2012 |language=en-NZ}}</ref> Polls suggested that his performance as leader was rated unfavourably with the public, and he had poor [[name recognition]].

In November 2012 during a Labour Party conference, media speculation suggested that Cunliffe, who was then economic development spokesperson, would launch a challenge against Shearer for leadership of the party.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Labours-Shearer-still-under-pressure/tabid/1607/articleID/277129/Default.aspx | work= 3 News NZ | title= Labour's Shearer still under pressure | date= 18 November 2012 | access-date= 18 November 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131014173931/http://www.3news.co.nz/Labours-Shearer-still-under-pressure/tabid/1607/articleID/277129/Default.aspx | archive-date= 14 October 2013 | url-status= dead }}</ref> On the morning of 19 November, Cunliffe confirmed he was not challenging Shearer, and would indeed back him if a vote was taken. However, he also said he would not commit to supporting Shearer when he faces a formal confidence vote in February 2013. Media speculation about Cunliffe's intentions marred Shearer's first 12 months as leader.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Cunliffe-Im-backing-Shearer/tabid/1607/articleID/277142/Default.aspx| work= 3 News NZ| title= Cunliffe: I'm backing Shearer| date= 19 November 2012| access-date= 18 November 2012| archive-url= https://archive.today/20130222232330/http://www.3news.co.nz/Cunliffe-Im-backing-Shearer/tabid/1607/articleID/277142/Default.aspx| archive-date= 22 February 2013| url-status= dead}}</ref> Labour MPs unanimously endorsed leader Shearer at the annual conference, and Shearer subsequently demoted Cunliffe from the [[front bench]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Trevett |first1=Claire |title=Labour MPs vote for Shearer; Cunliffe demoted |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10848698 |accessdate=8 May 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=20 November 2012 |language=en-NZ}}</ref>

Shearer continued to face dissent within the party caucus.
