The '''Deutsche Post AG''', operating under the trade name '''Deutsche Post DHL Group''', is a [[Germany|German]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[package delivery]] and [[supply chain management]] company headquartered in [[Bonn]], Germany. It is the world's largest courier company.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dpdhl.com/en/responsibility/employees-and-workplace.html |title=Employees and workplace |publisher=Deutsche Post DHL Group }}</ref> The postal division delivers 61 million letters each day in Germany, making it Europe's largest such company. The Express division (DHL) claims to be present in over 220 countries and territories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dhl.com/en/about_us/company_portrait.html |title=Company Portrait |website=DHL Company Portrait |access-date=16 May 2018}}</ref>

The Deutsche Post is the successor to the German mail authority [[Deutsche Bundespost]], which was privatized in 1995 and became a fully independent company in 2000. [[DHL Express]] is a wholly owned subsidiary.
Since its privatization, Deutsche Post has significantly expanded its business area through acquisitions. 
In late 2014, the group acquired [[StreetScooter]] GmbH, a small manufacturer of electric vehicles. Two years later, the group acquired [[UK Mail]], a business-focused postal service in the UK for US$315.5 million (£243 million). The former company became a division of the Deutsche Post European parcel network.<ref name="ukmail.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.ukmail.com/news/news-article/2016/12/22/deutsche-post-dhl-group-completes-uk-mail-acquisition |title=Deutsche Post DHL Group completes UK Mail acquisition |date=22 December 2016 |publisher=UK Mail }}</ref>

== Corporate divisions ==

=== Post – eCommerce – Parcel division  ===
[[File:Logo Deutsche Post 2019.svg|thumb|left|Deutsche Post logo]]
The postal division delivers approximately 61 million letters every working day in Germany,<ref name="annual-report-2016"/> and provides services across the entire mail value chain, including production facilities at central hubs, sales offices and production centers on four continents.

This division inherited most of the traditional mail services formerly offered by the state-owned monopoly, for which it uses the [[Deutsche Post (brand)|Deutsche Post]] brand. Its [[Letter monopoly|exclusive right to deliver letters]] under 50&nbsp;grams in Germany expired on 1 January 2008, following the implementation of European legislation. A number of companies are vying to challenge Deutsche Post's near monopolistic hold on letter deliveries, including Luxembourg-based [[PIN Group]] and Dutch-owned [[TNT N.V.|TNT Post]].<ref name="Companies vie for German postal services">[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/aug2007/gb2007082_647870.htm?chan=globalbiz_europe+index+page_top+stories Businessweek.com 2 Aug 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208224855/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/aug2007/gb2007082_647870.htm?chan=globalbiz_europe+index+page_top+stories |date=2009-02-08 }}</ref> In 2002, Deutsche Post was granted a license to deliver mail in the [[United Kingdom]], breaking [[Royal Mail]]'s long-standing [[monopoly]].

(March 2017)]]

In 2016, in Germany alone, the Post – eCommerce – Parcel (PeP) division delivered over 1.2 billion parcels, an increase of 9.3% over 2015, much of it as result of shipping products purchased by customers on-line. The e-commerce aspect helped to generate a great deal of revenue. This division's revenue increased by 4.1 percent to €16.8 billion while earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) increased by 30.8 percent to over €1.4 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.logisticsmanager.com/45pc-profit-boost-for-deutsche-post-dhl/ |title=45pc profit boost for Deutsche Post DHL |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=8 March 2017 |website=Logistics Manager |publisher=Akabo Media Ltd |access-date=27 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dpdhl.com/en/media-relations/press-releases/2017/annual-earnings-2016-deutsche-post-dhl-group.html |title=Deutsche Post DHL Group ends financial year 2016 with record earnings |date=8 March 2017 |publisher=Deutsche Post DHL Group }}</ref>

==Electric van manufacturing==

[[File:Post Caddy im Schnee 07.JPG|thumb|The VW Caddy diesel-powered vans will be replaced by StreetScooter Work models, initially in Germany]]
In December 2014 Deutsche Post DHL Group purchased [[StreetScooter]] GmbH, a small manufacturer of electric vehicles in [[Aachen, Germany]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dpdhl.com/de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2014/deutsche_post_dhl_uebernimmt_streetscooter_gmbh.html |title=Deutsche Post DHL übernimmt StreetScooter GmbH |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=9 December 2014 |website=Deutsche Post DHL |publisher=Deutsche Post AG |access-date=26 March 2017 |quote=Deutsche Post DHL hat den Kaufvertrag für die StreetScooter GmbH unterzeichnet - ein  ehemaliges Start-up aus dem Umfeld der RWTH Aachen mit dem Ziel, wirtschaftliche Elektroautos zu entwickeln. Mit der Übernahme der StreetScooter GmbH, die noch unter dem Vorbehalt der fusionskontrollrechtlichen Freigabe steht, übernimmt Deutsche Post DHL auch die Entwicklungs- und Produktionsrechte an den Fahrzeugen sowie die Mitarbeiter. Die StreetScooter GmbH ist ein Spin-Off der RWTH Aachen und als Konsortium aus rund 80 Industrieunternehmen der Automobilindustrie und verwandter Branchen gestartet. Es wurde 2010 gegründet und beschäftigt 70 Mitarbeiter. Seit 2013 sind in Aachen im ehemaligen Talbot-/Bombardierwerk rund 200 StreetScooter Fahrzeuge produziert worden.}}</ref> By April 2016, the company announced that it would produce 2,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/artikel/deutsche-post-konzern-baut-elektrotransporter-a-1085264.html|title=Deutsche Post will 2016 noch 2000 Elektro-Transporter bauen - manager magazin|work=manager magazin|access-date=2017-08-03}}</ref> of the StreetScooter Work model in Aachen by year end.

The Work vehicle is equipped with lithium-ion battery packs and is powered by 30&nbsp;kW asynchronous electric motors. The peak/continuous output is stated as 48&nbsp;kW/38&nbsp;kW. The range (before the need to recharge) is said to be  50 to 80&nbsp;km, depending on the weight of the load and traffic conditions. The load capacity is 710&nbsp;kg.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.streetscooter.eu/modelle/work |title=Technical Information StreetScooter Work (Kofferaufbau) |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=StreetScooter |publisher=StreetScooter GmbH |access-date=26 March 2017}}</ref>

Deutsche Post's 2016 annual report indicates that it plans to replace its fleet of delivery vehicles in Germany with the electric StreetScooter products "in the medium term".<ref name="annual-report-2016"/> Electric vans and trucks with a much greater range will be required to achieve the very long-term goal of replacing the group's entire fleet of approximately 70,000 vehicles with electric StreetScooter vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.com/en/deutsche-post-dhl-makes-its-own-electric-delivery-vans/a-19332124 |title=Deutsche Post DHL makes its own electric delivery vans |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=15 June 2016 |website=DW |publisher=Deutsche Welle |access-date=26 March 2017 |quote=Provided its StreetScooters can be produced cheaply enough compared to the alternative of buying e-vans from established auto makers, the bottom line of the world's biggest delivery services company stands to benefit from producing its own delivery vehicles - whether or not it eventually adds profits from sales of e-vans to third parties.}}</ref>

A mass production plan was announced in April 2016. StreetScooter GmbH would be scaling up to manufacture approximately 10,000 vehicles annually, starting in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/der-tausendste-elektro-streetscooter-der-deutschen-post-14401894.html |title=Streetscooter - Der tausendste Elektro-Transporter der Post |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=23 August 2016 |website=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  |publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH |access-date=26 March 2017 |quote=Die Post will ihren gesamten Fuhrpark auf Elektro-Autos umstellen. Bis dahin dauert es noch. Einen wichtigen Schritt hat das Unternehmen nun aber gemacht.}}</ref> If that goal is achieved, it would become the largest electric light utility vehicle manufacturer in Europe, surpassing Renault which makes vans such as the [[Renault Kangoo|Kangoo Z.E.]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Weiss |first=Richard |date=24 March 2017 |title=Even Germany’s post office is building an electric car |url=http://www.therecord.com/news-story/7207920-even-germany-s-post-office-is-building-an-electric-car/ |work=Waterloo Region Record |location=Kitchener, Ontario |access-date=26 March 2017}}</ref>

In addition to producing vehicles for Deutsche Post and DHL Express, StreetScooter has made marketing contacts with "numerous industries". A management board member told the media in March 2017 that one potential customer is considering a "very, very large number" of StreetScooters. More specifics would be announced in the next few months. The long-term business plan will require other types of models, some much larger, with entirely different equipment. StreetScooter showed a larger prototype, the Work L, in September 2016 that will provide double the capacity in cargo size; its load capacity will be 1,000&nbsp;kg. The range (before recharging is necessary) is estimated at "up to 100 km".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dpdhl.com/en/media-relations/press-releases/2016/streetscooter-presents-new-work-l-model-iaa-commercial-vehicles-2016-trade-fair.html |title=StreetScooter presents new "Work L" model |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=20 September 2016 |website=DPDHL |publisher=Deutsche Post DHL |access-date=26 March 2017}}</ref> The company also announced that it was developing a Work Orange model with an "electro-hydraulic three-way dumper" for use by businesses that deal in trash or construction material handling. 
<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-24/even-germany-s-post-office-is-building-an-electric-car |title=Even Germany’s Post Office Is Building an Electric Car |last=Weiss |first=Richard |date=24 March 2017 |website=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg |access-date=26 March 2017 |quote=When Deutsche Post AG couldn’t find a zero-emission delivery van that met its needs, it bought a startup and developed one. Now Europe’s largest postal service may start selling those vehicles — dubbed StreetScooters — to others, showing the potential for disruption in the rapidly changing auto market.}}</ref>

==Emission reduction targets ==
The Deutsche Post DHL Group's GoGreen program is intended to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and local air pollutants. The company has four interim goals for doing so, to be achieved by the year 2025. The long-term target, summarized by Frank Appel, Chief Executive Officer, is more aggressive. "From now until 2050, our mission will be to drive our business toward zero [logistics related] emissions. We are setting the standard for the future of the transport sector and doing our part to help the world community reach its goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees Celsius."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dpdhl.com/en/responsibility/environment-and-solutions.html |title=2017 Deutsche Post AG  Our GoGreen environmental protection program |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=8 March 2017 |website=DP DHL |publisher=Deutsche Post |access-date=26 March 2017 |quote=By the year 2050 we want to reduce all logistics-related emissions to zero – a highly ambitious goal.
