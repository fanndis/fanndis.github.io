The '''United States Census''' (plural censuses or census) is a [[census]] that is legally mandated by the US Constitution, and takes place every 10 years. The first census after the [[American Revolution]] was taken in [[1790 United States Census|1790]], under [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Thomas Jefferson]]; there have been 22 federal censuses since that time.<ref name=decennial />

The [[2020 United States Census|current national census]] has been in progress since 2020; the next census is scheduled for 2030. Since 2013, the Census Bureau began discussions on using technology to aid data collection starting with the 2020 census.<ref>{{cite news|title=2020 Census will be done by Internet|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/2020-census-will-be-done-by-internet/2013/03/28/08453c72-97d8-11e2-b68f-dc5c4b47e519_story.html?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost|work=Washington Post|access-date=1 April 2013|first=Carol|last=Morello|date=March 28, 2013}}</ref> In 2020, every household will receive an invitation to complete the census over the Internet, by phone or by paper questionnaire.<ref>{{cite news|title=What You Need To Know About The 2020 Census"|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/03/31/707899218/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-2020-census|publisher=NPR|access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ways to Respond |url=https://2020census.gov/en/ways-to-respond.html |website=U.S. Census Bureau |access-date=20 September 2019}}</ref> For years between the decennial censuses, the Census Bureau issues estimates made using surveys and statistical models, in particular, the [[Population Estimates Program]] and [[American Community Survey]].

The United States Census is a [[population census]], which is distinct from the [[United States Census of Agriculture|U.S. Census of Agriculture]], which is no longer the responsibility of the Census Bureau. It is also distinct from [[Census#Local|local censuses]] conducted by some states or local jurisdictions.

== Legal basis ==
The US Census is mandated by [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]], Section 2 of the [[United States Constitution]], which states: "[[United States congressional apportionment|Representatives]] and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States... according to their respective Numbers... . The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the [[First United States Congress|first meeting]] of the [[Congress of the United States]], and within every subsequent Term of ten Years".{{efn|[[s:Constitution of the United States of America|Constitution of the United States]]}}<ref name="decennial">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/history/www/programs/demographic/decennial_census.html |title=Decennial Census – History – U.S. Census Bureau |publisher=Census.gov |access-date=2015-03-19}}</ref> Section 2 of the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] amended Article I, Section 2 to include that the "respective Numbers" of the "several States" will be determined by "counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.” The [[United States Census Bureau]] (officially the Bureau of the Census, as defined in Title 13 U.S.C. § 11) is responsible for the United States Census. The Bureau of the Census is part of the [[United States Department of Commerce]].

[[Title 13 of the United States Code]] governs how the census is conducted and how its data is handled. Information is confidential as per {{USC|13|9}}. The census law, coupled with the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] of 1984 ([[Title 18 of the United States Code]], Sections 3551, 3559, and 3571), provides for penalties of up to $5,000 for not responding or for willfully providing false answers to any question.

Decennial U.S. Census figures are based on actual counts of persons dwelling in U.S. residential structures. They include citizens, non-citizen legal residents, non-citizen long-term visitors and undocumented immigrants. The Census Bureau bases its decision about whom to count on the concept of usual residence. Usual residence, a principle established by the Census Act of 1790, is defined as the place a person lives and sleeps most of the time. The Census Bureau uses special procedures to ensure that those without conventional housing are counted; however, data from these operations are not considered to be as accurate as data obtained from traditional procedures.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Smith|first1 = Annetta |last2 = Smith|first2 = Denise | title = U.S Census Bureau Census Special Reports Series CENSR/01-2| publisher = US GPO | year = 2001}}</ref>

In instances where the bureau is unsure of the number of residents at an address after a field visit, its population characteristics are inferred from its nearest similar neighbor (hot-deck [[imputation (statistics)#Single imputation|imputation]]). This practice has effects across many areas, but is seen by some as controversial.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Meng | first1 = Xiao-Li | year = 1994 | title = Multiple-Imputation Inferences with Uncongenial Sources of Input | journal = Statistical Science | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 538–558 | jstor =2246252 | doi = 10.1214/ss/1177010269| doi-access = free }}</ref> However, the practice was ruled constitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Utah v. Evans]]''.

Certain American citizens living overseas are specifically excluded from being counted in the census even though they may vote. Only Americans living abroad who are “federal employees (military and civilian) and their dependents living overseas with them” are counted. “Private U.S. citizens living abroad who are not affiliated with the federal government (either as employees or their dependents) will not be included in the overseas counts. These overseas counts are used solely for [[United States congressional apportionment|reapportioning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives]]”.<ref>{{cite web |title=Census Help |url=https://ask.census.gov/prweb/PRServletCustom?pyActivity=pyMobileSnapStart&ArticleID=KCP-2692 |website=ask.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=17 June 2017 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6rIX92nYl?url=https://ask.census.gov/prweb/PRServletCustom/YACFBFye-rFIz_FoGtyvDRUGg1Uzu5Mn*/!STANDARD?pyActivity=pyMobileSnapStart&ArticleID=KCP-2692 |archive-date=17 June 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to the Census Bureau, “Census Day” has been April 1 since 1930. Previously, from 1790 to 1820, the census counted the population as of the first Monday in August. It moved to June in 1830, (June 2 in 1890), April 15 in 1910, and January 1 in 1920.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/history/ |title=History. U.S. Census Bureau |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref>

Because people are born, die, and move during the year, the census counts people where they were or expect to be living on this specific reference date in an attempt to get a coherent snapshot and avoid double counting. The actual census-taking begins before this date and extends for months thereafter. In 2020, the earliest responses were collected starting January 21 in remote parts of Alaska, and March 12 for most Americans.<ref name="myths">[https://www.npr.org/2020/03/05/809217188/10-census-facts-that-bust-common-myths-about-the-2020-u-s-head-count 10 Census Facts That Bust Common Myths About The 2020 U.S. Head Count]</ref>

== Applications ==

In addition to its primary purpose of reapportioning the House of Representatives, census data is used for a wide variety of applications, including:
* Apportionment of federal funding in a large number of programs, estimated at somewhere between $675&nbsp;billion and $1.5&nbsp;trillion per year.<ref name="myths" />
* Infrastructure and [[transportation planning]] 
* Military and disaster response planning
* Economic analysis
* Commercial investment and marketing decisions
* Computer programs that can disambiguate place names based on which has the highest population
* General reference works

The Census is controversial; up to one-third of all U.S. residents do not respond to repeated reminders. However, in recent censuses, the nonresponse rate has been less than 1% (it was about 0.4% in 2010). But many experts believe the nonresponse rate could reach double digits in 2020.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Mervis|first=Jeffrey|date=2020-09-11|title=Census experts fear rush to finish tally will yield flawed data|url=https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6509/1285|journal=Science|language=en|volume=369|issue=6509|pages=1285–1286|doi=10.1126/science.369.6509.1285|issn=0036-8075}}</ref>

Democrats often argue that modern sampling techniques should be used so that more accurate and complete data can be inferred. Republicans often argue against such sampling techniques, stating the U.S. Constitution requires an “actual enumeration” for apportionment of House seats, and that political appointees would be tempted to manipulate the sampling formulas.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why People Fight So Much About the Census|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/aug98/census30.htm|access-date=29 April 2014|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=30 August 1998|author=Michael Teitelbaum|author2=Jay Winter}}</ref>

Groups like the [[Prison Policy Initiative]] assert that the census practice of counting prisoners as residents of prisons, not their pre-incarceration addresses, leads to misleading information about racial demographics and population numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/impact.html |title=The Problem |publisher=Prisoners of the Census |date=September 26, 2005 |access-date=2010-03-24}}</ref>

{{main|2020 United States Census}}
The 2020 United Census drew a number of controversies and legal challenges under the [[Trump administration]] due to President [[Donald Trump]]'s polices towards immigration particularly those undocumented in the country. Prior to the publication of the census, the Commerce Department stated its intention to add a question asking responders about their immigration status, which many states and activists stated would cause legal immigrants to not respond to the Census out of fear of prosecution and lead to undercounting, affecting state representation and federal funding.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/why-census-asking-citizenship-problem-175053088.html/| title=Why the census asking about citizenship is such a problem |last=Weiser |first=Wendy |date=March 27, 2018 |work=Huff Post |access-date=March 28, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/03/27/california-sues-trump-administration-over-census-citizenship-question/462241002/|title=California sues Trump administration over Census citizenship question|last=Gomez|first=Alan|date=March 27, 2018|work=USA Today|access-date=March 27, 2018}}</ref> The Supreme Court case ''[[Department of Commerce v. New York]]'', decided in June 2019, found the rationale to add the question was [[arbitrary and capricious]] and required the Department to provide a better reasoning before they could include the question on the Census. The Department ultimately dropped the question by the time of the publication of the Census forms.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/census-citizenship-question-supreme-court.html|title=Supreme Court Leaves Census Question on Citizenship in Doubt|first=Adam|last=Liptak|date=June 27, 2019|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> Following the decision, Trump issued an executive order directing the Department to obtain citizenship data from other federal agencies rather than via the census.<ref>{{cite news |title=Trump backs away from census citizenship question, direct agencies to hand over citizenship information to Commerce |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/11/politics/trump-census-executive-action/index.html |access-date=February 27, 2020 |issue=July 11, 2019 |publisher=CNN}}</ref> On July 21, 2020, Trump signed a [[presidential memorandum]] ordering the exclusion of illegal immigrants from the numbers in the 2020 census that are used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives.<ref>https://www.npr.org/2020/07/21/892340508/with-no-final-say-trump-wants-to-change-who-counts-for-dividing-up-congress-seat?fbclid=IwAR118Vx5XK6Tz5ZcbIOrcb8CNKIACaNJoLFQ1AQ2Vp88axrXzwd5mcETlXI</ref>

The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] made collection of the Census results difficult, and the Department had extended the deadline to complete collection to October 31, 2020 instead of July 31, 2020. However, on August 3, 2020, the Department announced its Replan Schedule that would end collection early on September 30, 2020, aware this would leave them with incomplete data that they would have to estimate total numbers to complete. This move was again challenged in the courts. While lower courts had ruled for an injunction against the Department from implementing the Replan Schedule, the Supreme Court issued a stay of the injunction in October 2020, allowing the Census to be ended early.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/us/supreme-court-census.html | title = Supreme Court Rules That Census Count Can Be Cut Short | first1 = Adam | last1 = Liptak | first2 = Michael | last2 = Wines | date = October 13, 2020 | access-date = October 18, 2020 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref>

Around the same time, Trump issued a memo to the Commerce Department on July 21, 2020, instructing them that on reporting the results of the Census, to use estimates of undocumented immigrants and subtract their numbers from the totals, claiming that he had authority to make this determination on a Constitutional and past legal basis.<ref name=":0" /> Several legal challenges were filed, and a combined suit from 22 states and several non-governmental organizations were found against Trump, ruling that only Congress has the authority to interpret the manner of which people the Census includes. Trump petitioned to the Supreme Court which has certified the case ''[[Trump v. New York]]'' for an expedited hearing in November, given the results of the Census are required to be delivered to Congress by December 31, 2020.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-census-undocumented-immigrants/2020/10/16/cf8288be-0f51-11eb-8074-0e943a91bf08_story.html | title= Supreme Court will review Trump plan to exclude undocumented immigrants from calculations for congressional seats | first=  Robert | last =Barnes | date = October 16, 2020 | access-date= October 16, 2020 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}</ref>

==History==
Censuses had been taken prior to the Constitution's ratification; in the early 17th century, a census was taken in [[Virginia]], and people were counted in almost all of the British colonies that became the [[United States]].

Throughout the years, the country's needs and interests became more complicated. This meant that statistics were needed to help people understand what was happening and have a basis for planning. The content of the decennial census changed accordingly. In 1810, the first inquiry on manufactures, quantity and value of products occurred; in 1840, inquiries on fisheries were added; and in 1850, the census included inquiries on social issues, such as taxation, churches, pauperism, and crime. The censuses also spread geographically, to new states and territories added to the Union, as well as to other areas under U.S. sovereignty or jurisdiction. There were so many more inquiries of all kinds in the census of 1880 that almost a full decade was needed to publish all the results. In response to this, the census was mechanized in 1890, with [[tabulating machine]]s made by [[Herman Hollerith]]. This reduced the processing time to two and a half years.<ref>Martin Campbell-Kelly and William Aspray, "Computer a History of the Information Machine – Second Edition", Westview Press, pp. 14–19 2004</ref>

For the first six censuses (1790–1840), enumerators recorded only the names of the heads of household and a general demographic accounting of the remaining members of the household. Beginning in 1850, all members of the household were named on the census. The first slave schedules were also completed in 1850, with the second (and last) in 1860. Censuses of the late 19th century also included agricultural and industrial schedules to gauge the productivity of the nation's economy. Mortality schedules (taken between 1850 and 1880) captured a snapshot of life spans and causes of death throughout the country.

The first nine censuses (1790–1870) were conducted by U.S. marshals before the Census Bureau was created.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usmarshals.gov/history/broad_range.htm|title=U.S. Marshals Service|first=U.S. Marshals Service|last=(USMS)|website=www.usmarshals.gov}}</ref> Appointed U.S. marshals of each judicial district hired assistant marshals to conduct the actual enumeration. The census enumerators were typically from the village or neighbourhood and often knew the residents. Before enabling self-identification on the censuses, the U.S. Census Bureau relied on local people to have some knowledge of residents. Racial classification was made by the census enumerator in these decades, rather than by the individual.

| The 1850 census was a landmark year in American census-taking. It was the first year in which the census bureau attempted to record every member of every household, including women, children and slaves. Accordingly, the first slave schedules were produced in 1850. Prior to 1850, census records had only recorded the name of the head of the household and tabulated the other household members within given age groups.

The 1890 census was the first to be compiled using the new [[tabulating machines]] invented by [[Herman Hollerith]]. The net effect of the many changes from the 1880 census (the larger population, the number of data items to be collected, the Census Bureau headcount, the volume of scheduled publications, and the use of Hollerith's electromechanical tabulators) was to reduce the time required to fully process the census from eight years for the [[U.S. Census, 1880|1880 census]] to six years for the 1890 census.<ref name="11th census report">{{cite book |title=Report of the Commissioner of Labor In Charge of The Eleventh Census to the Secretary of the Interior for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1895 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office]] |date=July 29, 1895 |oclc=867910652|hdl=2027/osu.32435067619882 }} p. 9: "You may confidently look for the rapid reduction of the force of this office after the 1st of October, and the entire cessation of clerical work during the present calendar year. ...

==Respondent confidentiality==
One purpose of the census is to divide the house seats by population. Furthermore, as with any Census Bureau survey the data provides a beginning for allocation of resources. In addition, collected data are used in aggregate for statistical purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisnation.com/question/022.html|title=What is the purpose of the Census? What is the data used for?}}</ref> Replies are obtained from individuals and establishments only to enable the compilation of such general statistics. The confidentiality of these replies is very important. By law, no one—neither the census takers nor any other Census Bureau employee—is permitted to reveal identifiable information about any person, household, or business.

By law ({{USStatute|95|416|92|915|1978|October|5}}), individual decennial census records are sealed for 72 years,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/history/www/genealogy/decennial_census_records/the_72_year_rule_1.html |title=The "72-Year Rule" | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref> a number chosen in 1952<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/04/02/149575704/the-1940-census-72-year-old-secrets-revealed |title=The 1940 Census: 72-Year-Old Secrets Revealed}}</ref> as slightly higher than the average female life expectancy, 71.6.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/figure2.html |title=Life expectancy in the USA, 1900–98 |access-date=June 8, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326234944/http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/figure2.html |archive-date=March 26, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The individual census data most recently released to the public is the 1940 census, released on April 2, 2012. Aggregate census data are released when available.

===Historical FBI use of data===
Under the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), using primarily census records, compiled (1939–1941) the [[Custodial Detention Index]] ("CDI") on [[U.S. citizen|citizens]], [[enemy aliens]], and [[foreign national]]s, who might be dangerous. The [[War Powers Act of 1941|Second War Powers Act of 1941]] repealed the legal protection of confidential census data, which was not restored until 1947. This information facilitated the [[Japanese American internment|internment of Japanese-Americans]], following the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the U.S. at Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941 and the internment of [[Italian American internment|Italian-]] and [[German American internment|German-Americans]] following the United States' entry into [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=A4F4DED6-E7F2-99DF-32E46B0AC1FDE0FE&sc=I100322|title=Confirmed: The U.S. Census Bureau Gave Up Names of Japanese-Americans in WW II|date=2007-03-30|publisher=Scientific American |first=JR |last=Minkel |access-date=2009-11-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-30-census-role_N.htm|title=Papers show Census role in WWII camps|date=2007-03-30|publisher=[[USA Today]] |first=Haya |last=El Nasser |access-date=2009-11-02}}</ref>

In 1980, four FBI agents went to the Census Bureau's [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] office with [[search warrant|warrants]] to seize census documents, but were forced to leave with nothing. Courts upheld that no agency, including the FBI, has access to census data.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20000324/ai_n9965696/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605013514/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20000324/ai_n9965696/|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 5, 2010|first=Mary |last=Boyle|title=Springs once tested Census' confidentiality|date=March 24, 2000|publisher=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]]}}</ref>

==Data analysis==
The census records data specific to individual respondents are not available to the public until 72 years after a given census was taken, but aggregate statistical data derived from the census are released as soon as they are available. Every census up to and including [[1940 United States Census|1940]] is currently available to the public and can be viewed on [[microform|microfilm]] released by the [[National Archives and Records Administration]], the official keeper of archived federal census records. Complete online census records can be accessed for no cost from National Archives facilities and many libraries,<ref>{{cite web|title=How can I search the Census Records?|author=National Archives and Records Administration|url=https://www.archives.gov/genealogy/census/research.html|access-date=December 13, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217082120/http://www.archives.gov/genealogy/census/research.html|archive-date=2008-12-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> and a growing portion of the census is freely available from non-commercial online sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pilot.familysearch.org/recordsearch|title=Discover your Ancestors|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226191337/http://pilot.familysearch.org/recordsearch/|archive-date=2008-12-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgwcensus.org/ |title=The USGenWeb Free Census Project |access-date=2010-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.us-census.org/ |title=The USGenWeb Census Project |access-date=2010-03-24}}</ref>

Census [[microdata (statistics)|microdata]] for research purposes are available for censuses from [[1850 United States Census|1850]] forward through the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series ([[IPUMS]]), and scanned copies of each of the decennial census questionnaires are available online from many websites. Computerized [[aggregate data]] describing the characteristics of small geographic areas for the entire period from [[1790 United States Census|1790]] to [[2010 United States Census|2010]] are available from the [[National Historical Geographic Information System]].

===Regions and divisions===
[[File:US Census geographical region map.png|right|thumb|US Census Bureau Population Regions]]
The bureau recognizes four census [[List of regions of the United States#Census Bureau-designated regions and divisions|regions]] within the United States and further organizes them into nine divisions. These regions are groupings of states that subdivide the United States for the presentation of data. They should not be construed as necessarily being thus grouped owing to any geographical, historical, or cultural bonds.
