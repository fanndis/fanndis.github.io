'''Goodwill Industries International Inc.''', or shortened to '''Goodwill''', (stylized as '''goodw<!--ш-->ill''') is an American [[501(c) organization|nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization]] that provides job training, employment placement services, and other community-based programs for people who have barriers preventing them from otherwise obtaining a job. Additionally, Goodwill Industries may hire [[veteran]]s and individuals who lack education or job experience or face employment challenges. Goodwill is funded by a massive network of retail [[thrift store]]s which operate as nonprofits as well. Goodwill's answer to its profit status is "As a unique hybrid called a social enterprise, we defy traditional distinctions. Instead of a single bottom line of profit, we hold ourselves accountable to a [[triple bottom line]] of people, planet, and performance."<ref name="for profit">{{cite web |url=http://sfgoodwill.org/about/faq/#a2 |title=Is Goodwill a for-profit company or a non-profit agency? |website=sfgoodwill.org |publisher=Goodwill of San Francisco, San Mateo, and Marin |accessdate=14 Jan 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002120346/http://sfgoodwill.org/about/faq/#a2 |archive-date=2013-10-02 }}</ref>

In fiscal year 2018, Goodwill organizations generated a total of $6.1 billion in revenue, of which $5.27 billion was spent on charitable services, and $646 million was spent on salaries and other operating expenses.

==History==
[[File:Goodwill Tapscott jeh.JPG|thumb|A Goodwill in [[Brooklyn]]]]
In 1902, the Reverend [[Edgar J. Helms]] of [[Henry Morgan (minister)|Morgan]] [[Methodist]] Chapel in [[Boston]] started Goodwill as part of his [[Christian ministry|ministry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/sthlibrary/archives/neccah/records-files-state/boston-records/|title=Methodist Churches in Boston Since 1792 - School of Theology Library|website=www.bu.edu|accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref> Helms and his congregation collected used household goods and clothing being discarded in wealthier areas of the city, then trained and hired the unemployed or impoverished to mend and repair them. The products were then redistributed to those in need or were given to the needy people who helped repair them. 

In 1915, Helms hosted a visit to Morgan Memorial by representatives of a workshop mission in [[Brooklyn, NY]] and they learned about the innovative programs and the operating techniques of the "Morgan Memorial Cooperative Industries and Stores, Inc." Helms was subsequently invited to visit in New York. Out of these exchanges came Brooklyn's willingness to adopt and adapt the Morgan Memorial way of doing things, while Helms was persuaded that Brooklyn's name for its workshop, "Goodwill Industries," was preferable to the Morgan Memorial name. Thus was officially born Morgan Memorial Goodwill Industries, and that, plus Brooklyn's interest and ties, became the foundation on which Goodwill Industries was to be built as an international movement.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRAvAAAAMAAJ|title=Goodwill: for the love of people|last=Lewis|first=John Fulton|last2=America|first2=Goodwill Industries of|date=1977|publisher=Goodwill Industries of America|language=en}}</ref>

Today, Goodwill has become an international nonprofit that takes in more than $4.8 billion in annual revenue and provides more than 300,000 people with job training and community services each year.<ref name="GWmission">{{cite web|url=http://www.goodwill.org/uncategorized/celebrating-the-15th-annual-national-mentoring-month-goodwill-looks-to-engage-volunteers-throughout-january/|title=Celebrating the 15th Annual National Mentoring Month, Goodwill® Looks to Engage Volunteers throughout January|year=2017|publisher=Goodwill Industries|accessdate=2017-01-12}}</ref> Helms described Goodwill as an "industrial program as well as a social service enterprise."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2014/12/19/12-days-of-charitable-giving-2014-goodwill-industries/#2e3c1a787d4e|title=12 Days Of Charitable Giving 2014: Goodwill Industries|last=Erb|first=Kelly Phillips|date=December 19, 2014|work=Forbes|access-date=May 17, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

The clothing and household goods donated to Goodwill are sold in more than 3,200 Goodwill retail stores,<ref name="GWmission" /> on its Internet auction site shopgoodwill.com, as well on [[eBay]] by a number of its regional stores.<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick |last=Gladstone |title=Bulletin Board; Charity in Cyberspace |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/18/business/bulletin-board-charity-in-cyberspace.html |work=The New York Times |date=May 18, 2003 |accessdate=January 12, 2010}}</ref> Most of the items on shopgoodwill.com are items that are considered collectible or more valuable. Each regional store will ship out what they deem valuable so that the items will be purchased for [[fair market value]]. Antiques, collectibles, jewelry, comic books, furniture, and even automobiles are found on this website. The revenues fund job training and other services to prepare people for job success. Examples of Goodwill's presence on eBay are Goodwill Industries of Maine, Seattle, San Francisco, and many other locations. Goodwill locations that operate on eBay research donated items for higher profit than could be brought in-store, and instead list those items on eBay for auction. 

In 2010, through their involvement in Goodwill's programs, more than 170,000 people were placed into employment. They earned $2.7 billion in salaries and wages, and as tax-paying citizens, they contributed to the community.<ref name="goodwill.org">{{cite web|author=– Autum Beel |url=http://www.goodwill.org/about-us/ |title=About Us &#124; Goodwill Industries International, Inc |publisher=Goodwill.org |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> Goodwill also generates income to help businesses and the federal government fill gaps caused by labor shortages, time constraints, and limited space or equipment. Local Goodwill branches train and employ contract workers to fill outsourced needs for document management, assembly, mailing, custodial work, grounds keeping and more. Goodwill claims that more than 84 percent of its total revenue is used to fund education and career services and other critical community programs.<ref name="GWmission" /> Also in 2010, Goodwill provided people with training careers in industries such as banking, [[Information technology|IT]] and health care, as well as offering English-language training, education, transportation, and child care services.<ref name="goodwill.org" />

When merchandise cannot be sold at a normal Goodwill store, it is taken to a 'Goodwill Outlet' or 'Bargain Store.' Items are mostly sold by weight, with prices ranging from $0.49 to $1.69 per pound, depending on the location. The wide selection and massive discounts on a variety of household goods typically attract a fervent following of regular customers, some of whom make a full-time living buying and re-selling goods. There are also many vendors who buy this merchandise in bulk, and they send the merchandise to third-world countries.

In January 2016, Goodwill Industries of [[Toronto]], Eastern, Central and Northern Ontario closed its 16 stores and 10 donation centres after 80 years of operations, citing cash problems.

===Castro pop-up===
In November 2010, for the first time, Goodwill opened a store in [[San Francisco, California]], specifically designed to hire employees who are transgender, gay, or lesbian. The temporary or "Pop-up" store was a unique partnership between Goodwill of San Francisco and Transgender Economic Empowerment Initiative. The Castro Pop-up store closed in April 2011, but the staff was transferred to various Goodwill stores throughout San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/11/28/goodwill_thrives_at_san_francisco_thrift_store/|title=Goodwill thrives at San Francisco thrift store|last=Leff|first=Lisa|date=November 28, 2010|work=Boston.com|access-date=May 17, 2018|publisher=The Boston Globe}}</ref>

===POP! at South by Southwest===
Goodwill Industries International and Goodwill Industries of Central Texas (Austin) hosted their first pop-up retail shop, POP!, at [[South By Southwest|South by Southwest]] in 2013. Goodwill has been around for more than 110 years, but in recent years has revamped its retail strategy to include boutiques, trunk shows and other venues that appeal to a younger audience. During the POP! shop, consumers chose from a selection of unique items, including vintage and contemporary fashions and accessories, and designer labels. Revenues generated from the shop are helping put people to work in Austin. Spokespeople [[Evette Rios]] and Lorie Marrero were on hand for the event.<ref>{{cite news|title=POP!: Goodwill® Debuts First-ever Pop-up Shop At SXSW|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pop-goodwill-debuts-first-ever-pop-up-shop-at-sxsw-195278141.html|accessdate=23 March 2013|newspaper=PRNewswire.com}}</ref>

===Donate Movement===
In 2010, Goodwill launched the Donate Movement to demonstrate the value that donated goods have for people and the planet. Goodwill's vision for the Donate icon is a universal reminder to 'recycle' through responsible donation, helping provide opportunities for others while diverting usable items from landfills.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Donate Movement|url=https://donate.goodwill.org/about/|publisher=Goodwill Industries International|accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref>

===21st-Century Initiative===
On the occasion of its 100th anniversary in 2002, Goodwill Industries launched an international workforce development initiative designed to integrate 20 million people into the workplace by the year 2020.

Known as the Goodwill Industries 21st Century Initiative, the plan includes broad strategies for getting people into good jobs that enable them to become self-sufficient. These strategies include providing job and technology training for a 21st-century workforce, offering family strengthening services to support workers and their families, and developing business opportunities to employ individuals who were previously considered unemployable.<ref name="21stCentury">{{cite web|url=http://www.goodwill.org/about-us/goodwills-21st-century-initiative/|title=Goodwill Industries International - Goodwill's 21st Century Initiative|accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>

===Women Veterans initiative===
As part of the Joining Forces campaign of First Lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden, Goodwill has hired nearly 1,800 veterans and military family members and has served nearly 100,000 more with job training and placement services.

In June 2013, Goodwill announced an initiative with the goal of engaging 3,000 women veterans{{clarify|date=July 2017}} over the next two years with services and support that lead to economic self-sufficiency.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/2013/6/19/goodwill_to_announce_women_veteran_hiring.htm|title=Goodwill to Announce Women Veteran Hiring Initiativet|accessdate=2013-07-11|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703032554/http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/2013/6/19/goodwill_to_announce_women_veteran_hiring.htm|archive-date=2013-07-03}}</ref>

===GoodProspects===
GoodProspects is an online program of Goodwill where people seeking jobs or exploring careers can get advice from people that have worked in the field in which they are interested. Career mentors advising users are [[virtual volunteering|online volunteers]]. GoodProspects was launched in the Fall of 2011, funded by a grant from the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] [[Employment and Training Administration]]. It is currently supported by [[Accenture]] and [[TracFone Wireless#SafeLink Wireless|SafeLink Wireless]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://goodprospects.goodwill.org/content/about/|title=About GoodProspects|accessdate=2016-07-27}}</ref>

==Donation policies==
[[Image:Goodwill clothing drop-off bin.jpg|thumb|250px|Goodwill donation bin at a Safeway store]]
Goodwill has policies on donations, including items that it can accept. It will only accept items that can be resold, whether in the retail stores or as bulk lots.

Goodwill stores generally do not accept donations such as automotive parts, furniture showing signs of damage, large appliances including stoves, refrigerators, washers/dryers, or exercise equipment. Most stores also do not accept hazardous materials such as paint, medications, or building materials such as doors, wood, nails, etc. For liability reasons, Goodwill generally does not accept baby cribs or car seats. Sanitary regulations prohibit accepting mattress donations, and although some Goodwill stores sell brand new mattresses, most locations are unable. Recently, due to safety concerns, particularly lead content in painted products, some Goodwill stores do not accept certain toys.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jenn |last=Abelson |title=Lead law puts thrift stores in lurch |url=http://www.boston.com/community/moms/articles/2009/02/27/lead_law_puts_thrift_stores_in_lurch/ |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=February 27, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2010}}</ref>

Goodwill will generally accept donations of clothing, shoes, books, accessories (handbags, belts), dishes, furniture in good condition, household decorations, small appliances including vacuum cleaners, and consumer electronics including alarm clocks. Even if they are deemed unfit to be sold in a store, these items can be sold as bulk lots, and thus can still generate income.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Acceptable Donations {{!}} What Does Goodwill Take?|url=https://goodwillnne.org/donate/acceptable-donations/|access-date=2020-11-20|website=Goodwill NNE|language=en-US}}</ref>

Depending on local laws, the value of the goods donated can be used as a tax deduction.

Almost all Goodwill locations closed during state-wide mandates at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and have now reopened. However, the donation policies of individual locations have changed. Many locations are now only accepting donations on selected days in order to keep up with the surplus of supplies they are receiving and to get a chance to properly sanitize the stores.<ref>{{Cite web|title=COVID-19 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|url=https://www.goodwill.org/covid-19-frequently-asked-questions-faq/|access-date=2020-11-20|website=Goodwill Industries International|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Criticism and Compensation==
{{Update section|reason=The most recent references are from 2013.  Has anything changed since then?|date=November 2020}}

===Executive compensation===
In 2005, Goodwill Industries of the Columbia Willamette (GICW), Goodwill's [[Portland, Oregon]], branch, came under scrutiny due to executive compensation that the Oregon attorney general's office concluded was "unreasonable". The President of the Portland branch, Michael Miller, received $838,508 in pay and benefits for fiscal year 2004, which was reportedly out of line in comparison to other charity executives and placed him in the top one percent of American wage earners. After being confronted with the state's findings, Miller agreed to a 24% reduction in pay, and GICW formed a new committee and policy for handling matters of employee compensation.<ref>{{cite web |first=Bryan |last=Denson |author2=Kosseff, Jeff |url=http://www.ncrp.org/news-room/news-2005/402-goodwill-chief-agrees-to-pay-cut |work=National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy |title=Goodwill chief agrees to pay cut |publisher=[[The Oregonian]] |date=December 20, 2005 |accessdate=January 12, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304215552/http://www.ncrp.org/news-room/news-2005/402-goodwill-chief-agrees-to-pay-cut |archive-date=March 4, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ohio.com/news/local/bob-dyer-bad-will-toward-goodwill-isn-t-justified-1.366882 |publisher=Goodwill Industries of the Columbia Willamette |title=Response to Oregon Department of Justice Audit Report |format=PDF |date=December 20, 2005 |accessdate=January 12, 2010}}</ref>

A 2013 article on Watchdog.org reported that Goodwill's tax returns showed that more than 100 Goodwills pay less than minimum wage while simultaneously paying more than $53.7 million in total compensation to top executives.<ref name="Hrabe">{{cite news | url=http://watchdog.org/83209/policies-tax-dollars-enrich-goodwill-execs/ | title=Policies, tax dollars enrich Goodwill execs | date=6 May 2013 | accessdate=16 May 2013 | last=Hrabe | first=John | newspaper=Watchdog.org}}</ref> Douglas Barr, former CEO of the Goodwill of Southern California, was the highest paid Goodwill executive in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goodwillsocal.org/our-promise/leadership/|title=Leadership|website=Goodwill Southern California|accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref> He received total compensation worth $1,188,733, including a base salary of $350,200, bonuses worth $87,550, retirement benefits of $71,050, and $637,864 in other reportable compensation.<ref name="Hrabe" /> "In 2011, the Columbia Willamette Goodwill, one of the largest in the country, says it paid $922,444 in commensurate wages to approximately 250 people with developmental disabilities.

===Workers' wages===
[[File:Goodwill Donation Express center in eastern Hillsboro, Oregon (2016).jpg|thumb|left|Goodwill donation center in [[Hillsboro, Oregon]]]]

Goodwill Industries International has been criticized by some for using a provision of federal labor law to pay workers with disabilities less than the federal minimum wage. Under Section 14(c) of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]], organizations can obtain a "special wage certificate" to pay workers with disabilities a commensurate wage based on performance evaluations.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Issue of Fair Wages for Workers with Disabilities|url=https://nfb.org/fair-wages|publisher=National Federation of the Blind|accessdate=16 May 2013}}</ref> Of Goodwill's 105,000 employees, 7,300 are paid under the special wage certificate program.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-hrabe/the-worst-corporation-in-_b_1876905.html | title=Goodwill's Charity Racket: CEOs Earn Top-Dollar, Workers Paid Less Than Minimum Wage | date=25 September 2013 | accessdate=16 May 2013 | last=Hrabe | first=John | newspaper=The Huffington Post}}</ref> The National Federation of the Blind considers it "unfair, discriminatory, and immoral".<ref>{{cite press release |title=Americans with Disabilities to Protest Goodwill's Subminimum Wages|url=https://nfb.org//americans-disabilities-protest-goodwill%E2%80%99s-subminimum-wages |publisher=National Federation of the Blind|accessdate=16 May 2013}}</ref> Other disability rights advocates have defended Goodwill's use of the special wage certificate to employ workers with disabilities. Terry Farmer, CEO of ACCSES, a trade group that calls itself the "voice of disability service providers," said scrapping the provision could "force [disabled workers] to stay at home," enter rehabilitation, "or otherwise engage in unproductive and unsatisfactory activities."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/25/19062348-disabled-workers-paid-just-pennies-an-hour-and-its-legal?lite|title=Disabled workers paid just pennies an hour – and it's legal|last=Schecter|first=Anna|date=June 25, 2013|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> Goodwill believes that the policy is "a tool to create employment for people with disabilities" who would not otherwise be employed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hrabe|first=John|title=Goodwill Minimum Wage Loophole Will Shock You|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-hrabe/goodwill-minimum-wage_b_3246824.html|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=2013-05-15}}</ref> Goodwill notes that "Eliminating it would remove an important tool for employers and an employment option available to people with severe disabilities and their families.

In 2018, CEO Rich Cantz of [https://goodwillnne.org/ Goodwill Northern New England] (NNE) put out a video statement addressing the [https://www.goodwill.org/false-rumors/ “Think Before You Donate”] rumors that owner Mark Curran profits 2.3 million dollars a year from the organization. The backlash from many furious individuals stating that despite making such a large yearly salary, Goodwill Industries was not actually giving profits to charity, and getting the supplies for free.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Think Before You Donate|url=https://www.goodwill.org/false-rumors/|access-date=2020-11-20|website=Goodwill Industries International|language=en-US}}</ref> This was on top of the allegations of paying workers with disabilities unfair wages.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Staff|first=DiversityInc|date=2018-05-21|title=CEO of Goodwill Raked In Almost $730,000 in Salary While Paying Employees with Disabilities Pennies|url=https://www.diversityinc.com/ceo-of-goodwill-raked-in-almost-730-000-in-salary-while-paying-employees-with-disabilities-pennies/|access-date=2020-11-20|website=DiversityInc|language=en-US}}</ref> In the statement, he says that Goodwill NNE does, in fact, give to charities and works to provide resources for brain injury rehabilitation centers, those with disabilities, and veterans seeking work. Further, the website states that Mark Curran is not the owner or CEO. Steven Preston is the CEO of Goodwill Industries International and has to report to a volunteer board of directors.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Is Mark Curran CEO and Owner of Goodwill Industries?|url=https://goodwillnne.org/about/is-mark-curran-ceo-and-owner-of-goodwill-industries/|access-date=2020-11-20|website=Goodwill NNE|language=en-US}}</ref> In 2020, the stores in New England still run a voiceover during shopping hours that reiterates this message to shoppers.

A coalition of smaller charities in California had complained about Goodwill's support for legislation encouraging greater regulation of donation boxes,<ref name="californiawatch.org">{{cite news|title=Goodwill pushes for greater regulation of donation boxes|url=http://californiawatch.org/dailyreport/goodwill-pushes-greater-regulation-donation-boxes-18645|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=CalWatchdog.org|date=27 March 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729152758/http://californiawatch.org/dailyreport/goodwill-pushes-greater-regulation-donation-boxes-18645|archive-date=29 July 2013}}</ref> calling the efforts an "attempt to corner the clothing donation market and make more money."<ref>{{cite news|last=Hrabe|first=John|title=Nonprofits fight donation regulations|url=http://www.calwatchdog.com/2013/03/27/nonprofits-fight-donation-regulations/|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=CalWatchdog.org|date=2013-03-27}}</ref> Local Goodwills have argued that donation boxes divert money from the community and contribute to blight, and have pushed for state legislation that requires owners of a donation box to clearly display information about whether it is a for-profit or nonprofit organization.<ref name="californiawatch.org"/>
