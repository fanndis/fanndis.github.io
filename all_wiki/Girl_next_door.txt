A common cliche is when a male protagonist is caught in a [[love triangle]] between two women, he will usually choose the "sweet, ordinary, and caring girl next door" he grew up with rather than a more well-off or beautiful woman with fewer morals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ebert's bigger little movie glossary : a greatly expanded and much improved compendium of movie clichés, stereotypes, obligatory scenes, hackneyed formulas, shopworn conventions, and outdated archetypes|date=1999|publisher=Andrews McMeel|others=Ebert, Roger.|isbn=0740792466|location=Kansas City, Mo.|oclc=829154479}}</ref> Other times, this character ignores the hero for another male character, despite being the object of his affections.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Romancing the zombie : essays on the undead as significant "other"|others=Szanter, Ashley,, Richards, Jessica K.,, Bishop, Kyle William, 1973-|isbn=978-1476667423|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=45|oclc=987796701|date = 2017-08-14}}</ref>{{better source|date=July 2018}}

**The article criticizes ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' for their misuse of term "girl next door": "Otherwise the magazine is still pushing what Ms. Brinkley repeatedly described as the "natural beauty" of "what readers long for -- the girl next door". Who is the girl next door? Her fake name keeps changing but she is still the same empty-headed, smiling, air-brushed mannequin who appeared in Playboy in the 1950s and early 60s..."
