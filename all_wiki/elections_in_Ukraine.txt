==Voting patterns==
Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] politically dominated most of Ukraine. By mid 1990s the communists completely lost popularity in western Ukraine, which voted for any representative but communist. Since [[Leonid Kuchma]] left presidential post, in 2004 support for the Communist Party shifted towards the [[Party of Regions]] being politically dominating mostly over the southeastern Ukraine. At the same time initially led by the [[People's Movement of Ukraine]], political leadership in the non-communist camp was taken over by [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] bloc and [[Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko]].

In the elections since 2002 voters of Western and Central Ukrainian oblasts voted mostly for parties ([[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]], [[All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland"|Batkivshchyna]], [[UDAR]], [[Self Reliance (political party)|Self Reliance]], [[Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko|Radical Party]], [[Petro Poroshenko Bloc]] and the [[People's Front (Ukraine)|People's Front]]) and presidential candidates ([[Viktor Yuschenko]], [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]) with a pro-Western and state reform [[Political platform|platform]], while voters in Southern and Eastern oblasts of Ukraine voted for parties ([[Communist Party of Ukraine|CPU]], [[Party of Regions]] and [[Opposition Bloc]]) and presidential candidates ([[Viktor Yanukovych]]) with a pro-Russian and [[status quo]] platform.<ref name="Olszanski AE"/><ref>[http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vnd2012/WP406?PT001F01=900&pf7171=52 Центральна виборча комісія України - WWW відображення ІАС "Вибори народних депутатів України 2012"<!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016140034/http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vnd2012/WP406?PT001F01=900&pf7171=52 |date=2012-10-16 }}<br />{{cite web|date=30 August 2012|title=CEC substitutes Tymoshenko, Lutsenko in voting papers|url=http://en.for-ua.com/news/2012/08/30/111349.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813233711/http://en.for-ua.com/news/2012/08/30/111349.html|archivedate=13 August 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=6 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=EWparties>[https://books.google.com/books?id=H23Pv4Ik3vMC&pg=PA396&dq=Ukrainian++parties+pro-Western+Bloc&hl=nl&ei=8OdZTczRCMueOteptKIL&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Ukrainian%20%20parties%20pro-Western%20Bloc&f=false Communist and Post-Communist Parties in Europe] by [[Uwe Backes]] and [[Patrick Moreau]], [[Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-525-36912-8}} (page 396)</ref><ref name=Umland>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/andreas-umland/ukraine-right-wing-politics-is-genie-out-of-bottle Ukraine right-wing politics: is the genie out of the bottle?], [[openDemocracy.net]] (January 3, 2011)</ref><ref name="KuzioPORvotersdontgoaway">[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=39981 Eight Reasons Why Ukraine’s Party of Regions Will Win the 2012 Elections] by [[Taras Kuzio]], [[The Jamestown Foundation]] (17 October 2012)<br />[http://www.taraskuzio.net/media20_files/8.pdf UKRAINE: Yushchenko needs Tymoshenko as ally again] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515074305/http://www.taraskuzio.net/media20_files/8.pdf |date=2013-05-15 }} by [[Taras Kuzio]], [[Oxford Analytica]] (5 October 2007)</ref><ref>[http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/eastweek/2012-11-07/after-parliamentary-elections-ukraine-a-tough-victory-party-regions After the parliamentary elections in Ukraine: a tough victory for the Party of Regions], [[Centre for Eastern Studies]] (7 November 2012)</ref> Although this geographical division is decreasing.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/59340/ Election winner lacks strong voter mandate], [[Kyiv Post]] (February 11, 2010)<br />[http://www.euractiv.com/specialreport-eu-ukraine-relatio/ukraines-party-regions-pyrrhic-v-analysis-516103 Ukraine's Party of Regions: A pyrrhic victory], [[EurActiv.com]] (16 November 2012)<br />[http://www.dw.de/ukraine-vote-ushers-in-new-constellation-of-power/a-16341696 Ukraine vote ushers in new constellation of power], [[Deutsche Welle]] (30 October 2012)</ref><ref name="Olszanski AE"/><ref>{{Citation |first=Tadeusz A. |last=Olszański |title=Poroshenko, President of Ukraine |publisher=OSW—Centre for Eastern Studies |date=28 May 2014 |url=http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2014-05-28/poroshenko-president-ukraine}}</ref> Till the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] the electorate of CPU and Party of Regions was very loyal to them.<ref name="KuzioPORvotersdontgoaway"/> But in the 2014 parliamentary election Party of Regions did not to participate (because of a perceived lack of legitimacy (of the election), because not every resident of the [[Donbas]] could vote) and the CPU came 1.12% short of the 5% election threshold.<ref name="General official results of Rada election 2014">[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233747.html General official results of Rada election], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (11 November 2014)<br />[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/233696.html Central Election Commission announces official results of Rada election on party tickets], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (11 November 2014)</ref><ref>[http://en.ria.ru/politics/20140914/192930339/Ukraines-Party-of-Regions-Refuses-to-Participate-in-Rada.html Ukraine's Party of Regions Refuses to Participate in Rada Elections], [[RIA Novosti]] (23 September 2014)</ref> The results were a victory for the pro-Western parties and a major defeat for the pro-Russian camp.

There were only three presidential candidates who have gathered over 10 million votes: [[Leonid Kravchuk]] (1991 - 19.6, 1994 - 10.0), [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (2004 - 11.1), and [[Viktor Yanukovych]] (2004 - 11.0). The 10 million voters mark was almost reached by [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1999, but he only gained the trust of 9.6 million. To this day Kravchuk and [[Petro Poroshenko]] are the only presidential candidates who won the elections after the first round obtaining over 50% of votes, respective in 1991 and 2014. The person most frequently participating in presidential elections is [[Oleksandr Moroz]] who stood in every presidential election since 1994 when he gained the biggest support of some 3.5 million, while in 2010 less than 0.1 million voted for him. Viktor Yanukovych became the strongest runner-up in the history of presidential elections, while Leonid Kuchma - the only runner-up of the first round to pull a win in the second one. Thus far the top two presidential candidates always would get support of over 5 million voters each.

==Perceived flaws in legislation==
Despite a clear system for declaring donations to campaign funds, officials and experts say that Ukraine's election law is consistently flouted, with spending from candidates’ official funds representing only a fraction of the amount truly spent while it is rarely clear where the funding comes from.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/57079/ More than $1 billion will be spent on campaign, but no one knows for sure], [[Kyiv Post]] (January 14, 2010)</ref>

Early May 2009, the "Committee of Voters of Ukraine" stated they believe that the use of the state's [[administrative resource]]s by [[List of political parties in Ukraine|political forces]] for their own national and local [[election campaign]]s is no longer a decisive factor in the outcome of Ukrainian elections.<ref>[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/196948.html Committee Of Voters: Use Of State’s Administrative Resources No Longer Decisive Factor In Outcome Of Elections] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721005541/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/196948.html |date=2009-07-21 }}, [[Ukrainian News Agency]] (May 8, 2009)</ref> According to a survey of 2,000 people conducted in October 2010 by two Ukrainian nongovernmental organizations, the Democratic Initiatives Fund and [[OPORA]], one in five Ukrainians were willing to sell his or her vote in the then upcoming [[2010 Ukrainian local elections]].<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/content/Survey_Shows_Every_Fifth_Ukrainian_Ready_To_Sell_Vote/2197889.html Survey Shows Every Fifth Ukrainian Ready To Sell Vote], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (October 22, 2010)</ref> But according to (then) [[Ukrainian Prime Minister]] [[Mykola Azarov]] these elections "were absolutely without the use of [[administrative resources]], naturally. Nobody interfered with our citizens."<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/content/Yanukovychs_Party_Looks_To_Victory_Amid_Claims_Of_Election_Fraud_/2207495.html Yanukovych's Party Looks To Victory Amid Claims Of Election Fraud], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (November 01, 2010)</ref>
