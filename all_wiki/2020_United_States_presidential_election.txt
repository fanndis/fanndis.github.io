==Background==
===Procedure===
{{further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}

[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States. Each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], which is then ratified by the delegates at the party's convention (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice-presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name="rQNzf" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals. The election will occur simultaneously alongside elections for the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]], [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]], and [[List of elections in 2020#2020 United States elections|various state and local-level elections]].

The [[Maine Legislature]] passed a bill in August 2019 adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] (RCV) both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name="ovz9x" /><ref name="qhJpi" /> Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but made Maine the first state to use RCV for a presidential general election. The [[Maine Republican Party]] filed signatures for a [[veto referendum]] and preclude the use of RCV for the 2020 election, but [[Maine Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Matthew Dunlap]] found there were insufficient valid signatures to qualify for the ballot.

On December 14, 2020, pledged electors for each candidate, known collectively as the [[United States Electoral College]], will gather in their state's capital to cast their official ballot. The ballots are sent to Congress to be opened and officially counted pursuant to the processes laid out by the [[Electoral Count Act]] of 1887. The newly elected Congress will meet in [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session]] to open, count, and certify the ballots on January 6, 2021, with the sitting vice president (in his role as president of the Senate) presiding over the session.

===Simultaneous elections===
{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}

The presidential election occurred simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections were also held in several states. For the subsequent election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states, the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s). Often, a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] that also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name="9qYs9" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in drawing new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name="X02Fz" />

==Nominations==

===Democratic Party nomination===
{{main|2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries}}

====Primaries====
In August 2018, the [[Democratic National Committee]] voted to disallow [[superdelegate]]s from voting on the first ballot of the nominating process, beginning with the 2020 election. This required a candidate to win a majority of pledged delegates from the assorted primary elections in order to win the party's nomination. The last time this did not occur was the nomination of [[Adlai Stevenson II]] at the [[1952 Democratic National Convention]].<ref name="ssKcA" /> Meanwhile, six states used [[Ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] in the primaries: Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, and Wyoming for all voters; and Iowa and [[Nevada]] for absentee voters.<ref name="7VCs8" />

After [[Hillary Clinton]]'s loss in the [[2016 United States presidential election|previous]] election, the Democratic Party was seen largely as leaderless,<ref name="BGA13"/> and was also seen as fractured between the [[centrist]] Clinton wing and the more [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[Bernie Sanders|Sanders]] wing of the party, echoing the rift brought up in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 primary]] election.<ref name="YGlMQ" /><ref name="le0En" /> In 2018, several [[U.S. House]] districts that Democrats hoped to gain from the Republican majority had contentious primary elections. ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider described these clashes as a "Democratic civil war".<ref name="rlKMJ" /> During this period, there was a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate.<ref name="gTbzW" /><ref name="C7O7F" />

Overall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name="fkBz3" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name="politifact2019" />

Entering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates. [[Pete Buttigieg]] narrowly defeated [[Bernie Sanders]] in Iowa, then Sanders edged out Buttigieg in the February 11, [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Following [[Michael Bennet]], [[Deval Patrick]], and [[Andrew Yang]] dropping out, Sanders won the [[2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses|Nevada caucuses]] on February 22. [[Joe Biden]] then won the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary|South Carolina primary]], causing Buttigieg, [[Amy Klobuchar]], and [[Tom Steyer]] to abandon their campaigns (Buttigieg and Klobuchar then immediately endorsed Biden). After [[Super Tuesday]], March 3, [[Michael Bloomberg]] and [[Elizabeth Warren]] quit the race, leaving three candidates left: Biden and Sanders, the main contenders, and [[Tulsi Gabbard]], who remained in the race despite facing nigh-on insurmountable odds.<ref name="cw3Ne" /> Gabbard then dropped out and endorsed Biden after the March 17, [[2020 Arizona Democratic primary|Arizona]], [[2020 Florida Democratic primary|Florida]], and [[2020 Illinois Democratic primary|Illinois]] races.<ref name="2vZj6" /> On April 8, 2020, Sanders dropped out, reportedly after being convinced by former president [[Barack Obama]], leaving Biden as the only major candidate remaining, and the presumptive nominee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/08/biden-sanders-2016-2020-176169|title=Biden moves quickly to exorcise 'the ghosts of 2016'|website=Politico|last1=Caputo|first1=Marc|date=April 8, 2020|access-date=April 8, 2020|archive-date=June 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603203601/https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/08/biden-sanders-2016-2020-176169|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Collman|first1=Ashley|title=Obama convinced Bernie Sanders to drop out by arguing that he already succeeded in pushing Biden to the left, new report says|url=https://www.businessinsider.sg/obama-convinced-bernie-sanders-to-drop-out-2020-race-2020-4?r=US&IR=T|website=Business Insider|date=April 15, 2020|access-date=April 22, 2020|archive-date=June 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200620095541/https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-convinced-bernie-sanders-to-drop-out-2020-race-2020-4?r=US&IR=T%2F|url-status=live}}</ref> Biden then gained endorsements from Obama, Sanders and Warren.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fearnow |first1=Benjamin |title=Joe Biden's favorability rose 9 percent after endorsements from Obama, Sanders and Warren |url=https://www.newsweek.com/joe-bidens-favorability-rose-9-percent-after-endorsements-obama-sanders-warren-1499200 |website=Newsweek |access-date=April 22, 2020 |date=April 21, 2020 |archive-date=May 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200523180030/https://www.newsweek.com/joe-bidens-favorability-rose-9-percent-after-endorsements-obama-sanders-warren-1499200 |url-status=live }}</ref> By June 5, 2020, Biden had officially gained enough delegates to ensure his nomination at the convention,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Montellaro |first1=Zach |title=Biden clinches Democratic presidential nomination |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/05/biden-clinches-democratic-presidential-nomination-304338 |website=Politico |access-date=June 9, 2020 |date=June 5, 2020 |archive-date=June 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609180039/https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/05/biden-clinches-democratic-presidential-nomination-304338 |url-status=live }}</ref> and proceeded to work with Sanders to develop a [[Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces|joint policy task force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/07/08/889189235/democratic-task-forces-deliver-biden-a-blueprint-for-a-progressive-presidency|title=Democratic Task Forces Deliver Biden A Blueprint For A Progressive Presidency|work=NPR|last1=Detrow|first1=Scott|date=July 8, 2020|access-date=July 10, 2020|archive-date=August 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819125446/https://www.npr.org/2020/07/08/889189235/democratic-task-forces-deliver-biden-a-blueprint-for-a-progressive-presidency|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Republican Party nomination===
{{main|2020 Republican Party presidential primaries}}

====Primaries====
In election cycles with incumbent presidents running for re-election, the race for the party nomination is usually ''pro-forma'', with token opposition instead of any serious challengers and with their party rules being fixed in their favor.<ref name="B1TfP" /><ref name="politico20190506" /> The 2020 election was not an exception; with Donald Trump formally seeking a second term,<ref name="DFAz3" /><ref name="VkToz" /> the official Republican apparatus, both state and national, coordinated with his campaign to implement changes to make it difficult for any primary opponent to mount a serious challenge.<ref name="ct7mA" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/10/republicans-quietly-rig-2020-nominating-contest-for-trump.html|title=Republicans Quietly Rigging 2020 Nominating Contest for Trump|website=New York Intelligencer|last1=Kilgore|first1=Ed|date=October 8, 2019|access-date=November 8, 2020|archive-date=March 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301095403/https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/10/republicans-quietly-rig-2020-nominating-contest-for-trump.html|url-status=live}}</ref> On January 25, 2019, the [[Republican National Committee]] unofficially endorsed Trump.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rnc-push-undivided-support-trump-reelection-state-leaders/story?id=60603125|title=RNC pledges undivided support for Trump re-election; state leaders consider canceling caucuses|website=ABC News|last1=Scott|first1=Rachel|date=January 29, 2019|access-date=September 9, 2020|archive-date=July 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724185515/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rnc-push-undivided-support-trump-reelection-state-leaders/story?id=60603125|url-status=live}}</ref>

Several Republican state committees scrapped their respective primaries or caucuses,<ref name="politico20190906" /> citing the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name="YYpWu" /><ref name="b3RX8" /> After cancelling their races, some states immediately pledged their delegates to Trump,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/474243-hawaii-gop-cancels-presidential-preference-poll-and-commits-delegates-to|title=Hawaii GOP cancels presidential preference poll, commits delegates to Trump|website=The Hill|last1=Klar|first1=Rebecca|date=December 12, 2019|access-date=December 12, 2019|archive-date=April 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200412161151/https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/474243-hawaii-gop-cancels-presidential-preference-poll-and-commits-delegates-to|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-new-york-cancels-gop-primary-20200303-tra2ex6cnfaz5gs6vbz7oitjxm-story.html|title=New York cancels Republican primary after Trump only candidate to qualify|website=Daily News|location=New York|last1=Slattery|first1=Denis|date=March 3, 2020|access-date=November 8, 2020|archive-date=June 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603231308/https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-new-york-cancels-gop-primary-20200303-tra2ex6cnfaz5gs6vbz7oitjxm-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> while other states later held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name="cw1Ms" /><ref name="vHq4G" /> 

The Trump campaign also urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a "[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or "winner-takes-most" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name="politico20190506" /><ref name="AP20190920" />

Nevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a "shadow campaign" against the president, particularly from the party's moderate or establishment wings. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, "Republicans see weakness in this president."<ref name="wjjR6" /><ref name="yDOhp" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] Governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee.<ref name="C9L6O" /><ref name="f20FO" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was "inviting" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name="Ogmqz" />

Former Massachusetts Governor [[Bill Weld]] became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/15/politics/bill-weld-2020-trump/|title=Bill Weld officially announces he is challenging Trump for GOP nomination in 2020|work=CNN|last1=Brusk|first1=Steve|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kate|date=April 16, 2019|access-date=November 8, 2020|archive-date=April 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415211525/https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/15/politics/bill-weld-2020-trump/|url-status=live}}</ref> Weld, who was the [[Libertarian Party of the United States|Libertarian Party's]] nominee for vice president in 2016, was considered a long shot because of Trump's popularity within his own party and Weld's positions on issues such as [[abortion debate|abortion]], [[gun control]] and [[same-sex marriage]] that conflicted with conservative positions on those issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/04/bill-weld-officially-targets-trump-with-long-shot-primary-bid|title=Bill Weld Officially Targets Trump With Long-Shot Primary Challenge|work=Vanity Fair|date=April 16, 2019|last1=Durkee|first1=Allison|access-date=November 8, 2020|archive-date=November 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191111185609/https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/04/bill-weld-officially-targets-trump-with-long-shot-primary-bid|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] also entered the race but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/columnists/story/2019-10-25/column-roque-de-la-fuente-is-running-for-u-s-president-again|title=Roque 'Rocky' De La Fuente is running for U.S. president — again|website=The San Diego Tribune|last1=Bell|first1=Diane|date=October 25, 2019|access-date=August 28, 2020|archive-date=September 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200913094254/https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/columnists/story/2019-10-25/column-roque-de-la-fuente-is-running-for-u-s-president-again|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fox61.com/article/news/politics/elections/rocky-de-la-fuente-connecticut-primary-presidential-gop-republican/520-ec3fb22c-b627-4877-acdd-f6f1b2cbab09|title=Who is Rocky De La Fuente?

Former Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying he would not vote for Trump if Trump became the nominee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/25/politics/joe-walsh-take-on-trump-in-2020-republican-primary/index.html|title=Joe Walsh to take on Trump in 2020 Republican primary|work=CNN|last1=Kelly|first1=Caroline|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kate|date=August 25, 2020|accessdate=August 25, 2020|archive-date=August 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200828051844/https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/25/politics/joe-walsh-take-on-trump-in-2020-republican-primary/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses.

The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] was a major issue of the campaign, with Trump's responses being heavily criticized. The president spread mixed messages on the value of wearing face masks as protection, including criticizing Biden and reporters for wearing them, but has also encouraged their use at times.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Victor|first1=Daniel|last2=Serviss|first2=Lew|last3=Paybarah|first3=Azi|date=October 2, 2020|title=In His Own Words, Trump on the Coronavirus and Masks|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-masks.html|access-date=November 3, 2020|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=November 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201102225946/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-masks.html|url-status=live}}</ref> During the campaign, Trump held many events across the country, including in coronavirus hotspots, where attendees did not wear masks and were not socially distancing; at the same time, he mocked those who wore face masks.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Restuccia|first=Andrew|date=October 2, 2020|title=Trump and His Aides Have Long Played Down Importance of Face Masks, Distancing|work=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-and-his-aides-have-long-downplayed-importance-of-face-masks-distancing-11601655164|access-date=October 30, 2020|issn=0099-9660|archive-date=October 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030080545/https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-and-his-aides-have-long-downplayed-importance-of-face-masks-distancing-11601655164|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last1=Mills|first1=Doug|last2=Schaff|first2=Erin|date=October 29, 2020|title=As Trump Exaggerates Virus Progress and Mocks Masks, Biden Vows to 'Let Science Drive Our Decisions'|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/28/us/trump-biden-election|access-date=October 30, 2020|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=October 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029141108/https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/28/us/trump-biden-election|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Vigdor|first=Neil|date=August 26, 2020|title=Masks and social distancing are mostly absent from Republican convention events.|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/us/politics/masks-and-social-distancing-are-mostly-absent-from-republican-convention-events.html|access-date=October 30, 2020|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=September 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200907181212/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/us/politics/masks-and-social-distancing-are-mostly-absent-from-republican-convention-events.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Economy===
Trump claimed credit for the consistent economic expansion of his presidency's first three years, with the stock market at its longest growth period in history, and unemployment at a fifty-year low. Additionally, he has touted the 2020 third quarter rebound, in which GDP grew at an annualized rate of 33.1%, as evidence of the success of his economic policies.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Politi|first1=James|last2=Weaver|first2=Courtney|date=October 9, 2020|title=Trump and Biden spar over state of economy in final days of race|url=https://www.ft.com/content/dbe15063-8955-42e2-a757-b8d9b4bd9c60|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201103042026/https://www.ft.com/content/dbe15063-8955-42e2-a757-b8d9b4bd9c60|archive-date=November 3, 2020|access-date=November 3, 2020|website=Financial Times}}</ref> Biden responded to Trump's claims by repeating that the strong economy under Trump's presidency was inherited from the Obama administration, and that Trump has aggravated the economic impact of the pandemic, including the need for 42&nbsp;million Americans to file for unemployment.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Pager|first=Tyler|date=June 8, 2020|title=Biden Says Trump Squandered Economic Expansion Begun With Obama|work=Bloomberg|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-08/biden-says-trump-squandered-economic-expansion-begun-with-obama|access-date=November 3, 2020|archive-date=November 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201102192705/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-08/biden-says-trump-squandered-economic-expansion-begun-with-obama|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]], which lowered income tax for most Americans, as well as lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, were an important part of Trump's economic policy. Biden and the Democrats generally describe these cuts as unfairly benefiting the upper class. Biden plans to raise taxes on corporations and those making over $400,000 per year, while keeping the reduced taxes on lower income brackets, and raise [[capital gains tax]]es to a maximum bracket of 39.6%. In response, Trump said Biden's plans will destroy retirement accounts and the stock market.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crawford|first=Shannon K.|title=Trump vs. Biden on the issues: Economy|date=September 29, 2020|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-biden-issues-economy/story?id=73150658|access-date=November 3, 2020|website=ABC News|archive-date=November 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201103000009/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-biden-issues-economy/story?id=73150658|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Environment ===
Trump and Biden's views on environmental policy differ significantly. Trump has stated at times that [[climate change]] is a hoax, although he has also called it a serious subject.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Helier|first=Cheung|date=January 23, 2020|title=What does Trump actually believe on climate change?|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51213003|access-date=November 3, 2020|archive-date=November 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201103032420/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51213003|url-status=live}}</ref> Trump has condemned the [[Paris Agreement]] on greenhouse gas reduction and began [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|the withdrawal process]]. Biden plans to rejoin it and announced a $2&nbsp;trillion climate action plan. However, Biden has not fully accepted the [[Green New Deal]]. Biden does not plan to ban [[fracking]], but rather to outlaw new fracking on federal land. However, in a debate, Trump claimed that Biden wanted to ban it altogether. Trump's other environmental policies have included the removal of methane emission standards, and an expansion of mining.<ref>{{Cite web|last=McKeever|first=Amy|date=October 28, 2020|title=Latest: Trump's and Biden's environmental policy promises and actions|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/trackers/latest-trump-biden-environmental-policy-promises-actions/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101034202/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/trackers/latest-trump-biden-environmental-policy-promises-actions/|archive-date=November 1, 2020|access-date=November 3, 2020|website=Science}}</ref>

=== Health care ===
Health care was a divisive issue in both the Democratic primary campaign and the general campaign. While Biden, as well as other candidates, promised protection of the [[Affordable Care Act]], progressives within the Democratic Party advocated to replace the private insurance industry with [[Medicare for All]]. Biden's plan involves adding a [[Public health insurance option|public option]] to the American healthcare system,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kerns|first=Christopher|title=It's (nearly) official: Biden vs. Trump.

==State predictions==

Most election predictors use:
* ''tossup'': no advantage
* ''tilt'': advantage that is not quite as strong as "lean"
* ''lean'': slight advantage
* ''likely'': significant, but surmountable, advantage (highest rating given by [[CBS News]] and [[NPR]])
* ''safe'' or ''solid'': near-certain chance of victory

Biden carried 25 states plus the District of Columbia and one congressional district in Nebraska, totaling 306 electoral votes. Trump carried 25 states plus one congressional district in Maine, totaling 232 electoral votes. That result is the exact opposite of Trump's 306-to-232 win in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/presidential-election-results-2020-electoral-college-same-2016/|title=2020 election ends at same electoral vote as 2016 — 306 to 232, with Trump losing this time|last=Silverstein|first=Jason|date=November 13, 2020|work=CBS News|accessdate=29 November 2020}}</ref> Almost all counties previously considered reliable indicators of eventual success in presidential elections voted for Trump instead of Biden, meaning that they did not continue their streaks as [[List of election bellwether counties in the United States|bellwether counties]].

Some Trump supporters expressed concerns of possible fraud after seeing the president leading in some states on Election Night, only to see Biden take the lead in subsequent days. Election experts attributed this to several factors, including a "[[Blue shift (politics)|red mirage]]" of early results being counted in relatively thinly-populated rural areas that favored Trump, which are quicker to count, followed later by results from more heavily populated urban areas that favored Biden, which take longer to count. In some states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Republican-controlled legislatures prohibited mail-in ballots from being counted before Election Day, and once those ballots were counted they generally favored Biden, at least in part because Trump had for months raised concerns about mail-in ballots, causing those ballots to favor Biden even more. By contrast, in states such as Florida, which allowed counting of mail-in ballots for weeks prior to Election Day, an early [[Blue shift (politics)|blue shift]] giving the appearance of a Biden lead was later overcome by in-person voting that favored Trump, resulting in the state being called for the president on Election Night.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wasserman |first1=David |title=Beware the 'blue mirage' and the 'red mirage' on election night |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/beware-blue-mirage-red-mirage-election-night-n1245925 |work=NBC News |date=November 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Aaron |title=Trump blames Democrats for late-counted mail ballots.

=== Election calls ===
[[File:USA_electoral_votes_2020_hex_cartogram.svg|thumb|Hexagonal cartogram of the number of electoral college votes, with flipped states hatched]]
Major news organizations project a state for a candidate when there is high mathematical confidence that the outstanding vote would be unlikely to prevent the projected winner from ultimately winning the state. Election projections are made by decision teams of political scientists and data scientists.<ref name= "math" />

[[File:Biden victory celebration at Black Lives Matter plaza, Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|People celebrate in the streets [[Black Lives Matter Plaza|near the White House]] after the major networks projected Biden the winner of the election on November 7.]]
On November 6, election-calling organization ''[[Decision Desk HQ]]'' projected that Biden had won the election after forecasting that Biden had won Pennsylvania. According to ''Decision Desk HQ ''(which had not yet called Arizona), Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes gave Biden a total of 273 electoral votes, three over the threshold to make him [[President-elect of the United States|president-elect]]. ''Decision Desk HQ''{{'}}s clients ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' and ''[[Business Insider]]'' also called the race at that time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Decision Desk HQ calls the election for Biden |url=https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/decision-desk-hq-calls-the-election-for-biden-648263 |access-date=November 7, 2020 |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=November 6, 2020 |archive-date=November 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201106182617/https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/decision-desk-hq-calls-the-election-for-biden-648263 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=LaForme |first1=Ren |last2=Grau |first2=Mel |title=Vox.com, working with Decision Desk HQ, was one of the first news outlets to call the election |url=https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2020/vox-com-working-with-decision-desk-hq-was-one-of-the-first-news-outlets-to-call-the-election/ |access-date=November 7, 2020 |work=[[Poynter Institute]] |date=November 6, 2020 |archive-date=November 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201106182715/https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2020/vox-com-working-with-decision-desk-hq-was-one-of-the-first-news-outlets-to-call-the-election/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Prokop |first1=Andrew |title=Why Decision Desk called Pennsylvania, and the presidential race, for Joe Biden |url=https://www.vox.com/21552641/joe-biden-wins-pennsylvania-decision-desk |access-date=November 7, 2020 |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |date=November 6, 2020 |archive-date=November 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201106221719/https://www.vox.com/21552641/joe-biden-wins-pennsylvania-decision-desk |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== OSCE election monitoring ===
On the invitation of the U.S. State Department, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]'s (OSCE) [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights]] (ODIHR), which has been monitoring U.S. elections since 2002 (as it does for major elections in all other OSCE member countries), sent 102 observers from 39 countries.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|last=Rahman|first=Rema|date=November 3, 2020|title=Election observers on the ground in the US|url=https://thehill.com/policy/international/524080-election-observers-on-the-ground-in-the-us|access-date=November 6, 2020|website=The Hill|archive-date=November 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201106022650/https://thehill.com/policy/international/524080-election-observers-on-the-ground-in-the-us|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":12">{{Cite web|date=November 5, 2020|title=Election observer says no evidence for Trump's fraud claims|url=https://apnews.com/article/election-observer-no-evidence-fraud-b30f3424736014a6b7405df71e32e36f|access-date=November 6, 2020|website=AP News|archive-date=November 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201105222506/https://apnews.com/article/election-observer-no-evidence-fraud-b30f3424736014a6b7405df71e32e36f|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last=Morello|first=Carol|date=November 4, 2020|title=European election observers decry Trump's 'baseless allegations' of voter fraud|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/election-observers-trump-allegations/2020/11/04/4a538500-1ee0-11eb-9ec3-3a81e23c4b5e_story.html|url-status=live|access-date=November 6, 2020|issn=0190-8286|archive-date=November 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201105161029/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/election-observers-trump-allegations/2020/11/04/4a538500-1ee0-11eb-9ec3-3a81e23c4b5e_story.html}}</ref> The task force consisted of long-term observers from the ODIHR office (led by former Polish diplomat [[Urszula Gacek]]) deployed to 28 states from September on and covering 15 states on election day, and a group of European lawmakers acting as short-term observers (led by German parliamentarian [[Michael Georg Link]]), reporting from Maryland, Virginia, California, Nevada, Michigan, Missouri, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":2" /> Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was scaled down to a "limited election observation mission" from the originally planned 100 long-term observers and 400 short-term observers.<ref name=":02" />

An interim report published by the OSCE shortly before the election noted that many ODIHR interlocutors "expressed grave concerns about the risk of legitimacy of the elections being questioned due to the incumbent President's repeated allegations of a fraudulent election process, and postal vote in particular".<ref name=":02" /><ref>{{Cite web|date=October 22, 2020|title=United States of America, General Elections, 3 November 2020: Interim Report|url=https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/4/b/467964_0.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101064137/https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/4/b/467964_0.pdf|archive-date=November 1, 2020|access-date=November 6, 2020|work=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|page=2}}</ref> On the day after the election, the task force published preliminary findings,<ref name=":12" /> with part of the summary stating:
<blockquote>The 3 November general elections were competitive and well managed despite legal uncertainties and logistical challenges. In a highly polarized political environment, acrimonious campaign rhetoric fuelled tensions. Measures intended to secure the elections during the pandemic triggered protracted litigation driven by partisan interests. Uncertainty caused by late legal challenges and evidence-deficient claims about election fraud created confusion and concern among election officials and voters. Voter registration and identification rules in some states are unduly restrictive for certain groups of citizens. The media, although sharply polarized, provided comprehensive coverage of the campaign and made efforts to provide accurate information on the organization of elections.<ref>{{cite web|date=November 4, 2020|title=United States of America, General Elections, 3 November 2020: Statement of Preliminary Findings and Conclusions|url=https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/9/6/469437.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201105212346/https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/9/6/469437.pdf|archive-date=November 5, 2020|access-date=November 6, 2020|work=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|page=1}}</ref></blockquote>

Link stated that "on the election day itself, we couldn't see any violations" at the polling places visited by the observers.<ref name=":12" /> The task force also found "nothing untoward" while observing the handling of mail-in ballots at post offices, with Gacek being quoted as saying that "We feel that allegations of systemic wrongdoing in these elections have no solid ground" and that "The system has held up well".<ref name=":2" /> The OSCE's election monitoring branch is due to publish a more comprehensive report in early 2021.<ref name=":2" />

The [[Brookings Institution]] released a report entitled "Exit polls show both familiar and new voting blocs sealed Biden's win" on November 12, 2020. In it, author [[William H. Frey]] attributes Obama's 2008 win to young people, people of color, and the college educated. Frey contends Trump won in 2016 thanks to older whites without college degrees.<ref name="frey">{{cite web |last1=Frey |first1=William H. |title=Exit polls show both familiar and new voting blocs sealed Biden's win |url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/2020-exit-polls-show-a-scrambling-of-democrats-and-republicans-traditional-bases/ |website=The Brookings Institution|accessdate=November 22, 2020 |date=November 5, 2020}}</ref> Frey says that the same coalitions largely held in 2008 and 2016, although in key battleground states Biden increased his vote among some of the 2016 Trump groups, particularly among whites and older Americans.<ref name="frey" /> Trump won the white vote in 2016 by 20% but in 2020 by only 17%. The Democratic Party won black voters by 75%, the lowest margin since [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]]. Democrats won the Latino vote by 33%, which was lower than the 2004 margin, and they won the Asian American vote by 27%, the lowest figure since 2008.<ref name="frey" /> Biden increased the Democratic share of white men without college educations from 42% to 48% in 2016, and he made a slight improvement of 2% among white, college-educated women. People age 18 to 29 registered a rise in Democratic support between 2016 and 2020, with the Democratic margin of victory among that demographic increasing from 19% to 24%.<ref name="frey" />

====Voting patterns by ethnicity====
=====Latino voters=====
[[Voto Latino]] says the Latino vote was crucial to the Biden victory in [[2020 United States presidential election in Arizona|Arizona]]. 40% of Latino Voters who voted in 2020 did not vote in 2016, and 73% of Latino voters voted for Biden (438,000 voters).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gorden |first1=Max |title=Latinos key to turning Arizona blue in 2020 presidential election, group says |url=https://www.azfamily.com/news/politics/arizona_politics/latinos-key-to-turning-arizona-blue-in-2020-presidential-election-group-says/article_c4606504-22ee-11eb-8983-0b7a452ea5cb.html |website=AZFamily |access-date=November 22, 2020 |language=en |date=November 9, 2020}}</ref>

Others note that the failure of Democrats to win in [[2020 United States presidential election in Florida|Florida]] and [[2020 United States presidential election in Texas|Texas]] was because of the Biden campaign's treatment of Latinos as a monolithic voting bloc. While Democrats won most Latino voters in both of these states, they failed to win over [[Cuban Americans|Cuban American voters]] in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]] and fourth-and-fifth generation, English-speaking [[Tejanos]] in [[South Texas]] at the rates they had in the past.<ref name="latino">{{cite web |last1=Aguilera |first1=Jasmine |title=The Complexities of the 2020 'Latino Vote' Were Overlooked, Again |url=https://time.com/5907525/latino-vote-2020-election/ |website=Time |access-date=November 22, 2020 |language=en |date=November 10, 2020}}</ref> Even in [[2020 United States presidential election in Nevada|Nevada]], which Biden won, he failed to do as well among Hispanics as Bernie Sanders had done in the February caucus, largely because Sanders asked for their vote, but Biden did not;<ref name="latino" /> however, without Latino support Biden would have failed to carry the state.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Polls show how Latino voters helped drive Biden win in Nevada, though Trump gained ground since 2016|url=https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/polls-show-how-latino-voters-helped-drive-biden-win-in-nevada-though-trump-gained-ground-since-2016|access-date=November 26, 2020|website=thenevadaindependent.com|language=en}}</ref>

Demographic patterns emerged having to do with [[country of origin]] and candidate preference. Pre- and Post-election surveys showed Biden winning Latinos of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican]], [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]], [[Dominican Americans|Dominican]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 2, 2020|title=American Election Eve Poll 2020|url=https://electioneve2020.com/poll/#/en/demographics/latino/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|website=The American Election Eve Poll}}</ref> and [[Spanish Americans|Spanish]] heritage,<ref>{{Cite news|date=November 3, 2020|title=New Mexico Voter Surveys: How Different Groups Voted|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/ap-polls-new-mexico.html|access-date=November 26, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> while Trump carried Latinos of Cuban heritage.

=====Black voters=====
Biden won 90% of the Black vote, and his total votes among Blacks even exceeded that of Barack Obama in 2008. This vote was crucial in the large cities of [[2020 United States presidential election in Pennsylvania|Pennyslvania]] and [[2020 United States presidential election in Michigan|Michigan]]; the increase in the Democratic vote in [[Milwaukee County]] of about 28,000 votes was more than the 20,000-vote lead Biden had in the state of [[2020 United States presidential election in Wisconsin|Wisconsin]]. Almost half of Biden's gains in [[2020 United States presidential election in Georgia|Georgia]] came from the four largest counties—Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett, and Cobb—all in the Atlanta metro area with large Black populations.<ref>{{cite web |last1=STAFFORD |first1=Kat |last2=MORRISON |first2=Aaron |last3=KASTANIS |first3=Angeleki |title='This is proof': Biden's win reveals power of Black voters |url=https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-virus-outbreak-georgia-7a843bbce00713cfde6c3fdbc2e31eb7 |website=AP NEWS |access-date=November 22, 2020 |date=November 9, 2020 |quote=[The] African American community stood up again for me.}}</ref>

=====Asian American and Pacific Island voters=====
Polls showed that 68% of Asian American and Pacific Island voters (AAPI voters) supported Biden-Harris while 28% supported Trump-Pence. "From all of the data that we’ve seen, it’s safe to say Asian Americans supported Biden over Trump ... backing Democrats at a roughly 2:1 ratio," says [[Karthick Ramakrishnan]], a political science professor at the University of California Riverside and founder of AAPI Data. However, this overall tendency overlooks differences among particular ethnic groups: [[Korean Americans]], [[Japanese Americans]], [[Indian Americans]], and [[Chinese Americans]] favored Biden by higher margins overall compared to groups including [[Vietnamese Americans]] and [[Filipino Americans]]. Many voters were turned off by Trump's racist language ("China virus" and "kung flu"), but others appreciated his strong anti-China stance. Many Indian Americans self-identified with Kamala Harris, but others approved of Donald Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric and support of Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zhou |first1=Li |title=What we know about who Asian American voters supported in the election |url=https://www.vox.com/21561408/asian-american-voters-presidential-election |website=[[Vox (website)]] |access-date=November 22, 2020 |language=en |date=November 14, 2020 |quote=With strong turnout this year and more voters joining the electorate, it’s evident that AAPI voters are a key base that can’t be neglected.

=== Polling accuracy ===
Although polls generally predicted the Biden victory, the national polls were moderately imprecise by about 3–4 points, and some state polling was even further from the actual result. This also applied in several Senate races, where the Democrats were also underperformed by around 5 points relative to the polls.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Matthews|first=Dylan|date=November 10, 2020|title=One pollster's explanation for why the polls got it wrong|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/11/10/21551766/election-polls-results-wrong-david-shor|access-date=November 12, 2020|website=Vox}}</ref> Most pollsters underestimated support for Trump in several states, including Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Texas and Wisconsin; a notable exception was [[Ann Selzer]], who accurately predicted Republican victories in Iowa for the presidential and Senate races. The discrepancy between poll predictions and the actual result persisted from the 2016 election despite pollsters' attempts to fix problems with polling in 2016, in which they underestimated the Republican vote in several states. The imprecise polls led to changes in campaigning and fundraising decisions for both Democrats and Republicans.<ref name=":10">{{Cite news|last=Leonhardt|first=David|date=2020-11-12|title='A Black Eye': Why Political Polling Missed the Mark.

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', polling misses have been attributed to, among other issues, reduced average response to polling; the relative difficulty to poll certain types of voters; and pandemic-related problems, such as a theory which suggests Democrats were less willing to vote in person on Election Day than Republicans for fear of contracting COVID-19.<ref name=":10" /> ''[[New Statesman]]'' data journalist Ben Walker pointed to Hispanics as a historically difficult group to poll accurately, leading to pollsters underestimating the level of Trump support within the demographic group.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Walker|first=Ben|date=November 5, 2020|title=How accurate were the US presidential election polls?|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2020/11/how-accurate-were-us-presidential-election-polls|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-29|website=New Statesman|language=en}}</ref>

=== Attempts to delay or deny election results ===
On November 18, it was reported that Trump had decided to focus his efforts on a bid to delay final vote counts for long enough that Biden is unable to claim a clear victory. Trump maintained that he would win the election, tweeting "Important News Conference today by lawyers on a very clear and viable path to victory. Pieces are very nicely falling into place. RNC at 12:00 P.M." <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-wants-delay-final-vote-count-throw-biden-victory-doubt-2020-11|title=Trump has reportedly given up on overturning battleground defeats and is trying to delay a final vote count in a desperate bid to throw Biden's victory into doubt|work=Business Insider|last1=Colson|first1=Thomas|date=November 20, 2020|accessdate=November 20, 2020}}</ref>

The two Republican members of [[Wayne County, Michigan]]'s canvassing board voted against certifying its election results before reversing course and certifying them. Trump praised their initial action, writing on Twitter "Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!". After the initial refusal drew severe condemnation and the two Republican canvassers were widely publicly denounced, with one video of a local entrepreneur harshly accusing the GOP canvassers of [[racism]] going [[viral video|viral]] online, the board reversed course and certified the results for Biden.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2020/11/18/this-man-and-his-zoom-background-emerge-as-viral-star-of-contentious-wayne-county-canvassers-vote|title=This man (and his Zoom background) emerge as viral star of contentious Wayne County canvassers vote|work=Detroit Metro Times|first1=Lee|last1=DeVito|date=November 18, 2020}}</ref> One of the Republicans on the Board of County Canvassers had suggested certifying the vote for areas of Wayne County outside the [[Detroit, Michigan|City of Detroit]].

On November 25, one day after Pennsylvania certified its election results, a Republican state senator requested a hearing of the State Senate Majority Policy Committee to discuss election issues. The event, described as an "informational meeting," was held at a hotel in Gettysburg and featured Rudy Giuliani asserting that the election had been subject to massive fraud. Trump also spoke to the group by speakerphone, repeating his insistence that he had actually won in Pennsylvania and other swing states, and saying "We have to turn the election over."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-giuliani-gettysburg-pennsylvania-hearing-election-issues-alleged-irregularities-live-stream-today-2020-11-25/#app|title=Trump phones in false claims at Pennsylvania Senate committee hearing on voting "irregularities"|date=November 25, 2020|work=CBS News|accessdate=November 26, 2020}}</ref> Similar partisan hearings took place in Arizona on November 30 and Michigan on December 2.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/trumps-legal-team-to-hold-public-hearing-with-arizona-lawmakers-on-election-integrity|title=Trump's legal team to hold public hearing with Arizona Republicans on election integrity|date=November 28, 2020|website=FOX 10 Phoenix}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/12/03/melissa-carone-michigan-trump-giuliani-election/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_most&carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F2d4273c%2F5fc9144f9d2fda0efb7cf8df%2F5de1dfc5ade4e25a93873aa0%2F15%2F68%2F5fc9144f9d2fda0efb7cf8df|title=Trump campaign’s star witness in Michigan was deemed ‘not credible.’ Then, her loud testimony went viral.|last=Armus|first=Tio|date=December 3, 2020|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=3 December 2020}}</ref>

On December 2, Trump posted a 46 minute video to his social media. The taped speech, filmed in the White House, claimed the election was "rigged" and repeated numerous falsehoods and allegations of fraud that have been repeatedly rejected by multiple courts in several states. He repeatedly called for either the state legislatures or the courts to overturn the results of the election and allow him to stay in power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/us/politics/trump-election-video.html|title=Trump, in Video From White House, Delivers a 46-Minute Diatribe on the ‘Rigged’ Election|first=Michael D.|last=Shear|date=December 3, 2020|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

Trump continued to apply pressure to elected Republicans in an unprecedented attempt to overturn the democratic election result, in ways never attempted in the 244 US history. On December 5, 2020, hours before attending a rally in Georgia, Trump called Georgia Republican Governor Brian Kemp and pressured him to recall the legislature to overturn the election result.<ref> https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-kemp-call-georgia/2020/12/05/fd8d677c-3721-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html</ref>

===Recounts===
On November 11, Georgia Secretary of State [[Brad Raffensperger]] ordered a statewide hand recount of the vote in addition to the normal audit process. At the time, Biden held a lead of 14,112 votes, or 0.3% in the state.<ref>{{cite news |title=EXPLAINER: Is Georgia's upcoming ballot 'audit' a recount? |url=https://apnews.com/article/ap-explains-georgia-audit-or-recount-9adf1d0ed50f8788572b4f7e0f04027e |accessdate=November 22, 2020 |work=AP News|date=November 12, 2020}}</ref> The audit was concluded on November 19 and affirmed Biden's lead by 12,670 votes, citing a number of human errors, including memory cards that did not upload properly to the state servers, but no fraud in the original tally. Georgia law allows for a recount if there is a margin of 0.5%; the current margin is 0.2%.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Speunt |first1=Barbara |title=Georgia's Recount Confirms Biden's Lead; AP Declares Him State's Winner |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-2020-election-results/2020/11/19/936647882/georgia-releases-hand-recount-results-affirming-bidens-lead |accessdate=November 22, 2020 |work=NPR|date=November 19, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> After the state certified the results, Republican Governor [[Brian Kemp]] called for another hand audit, demanding to compare signatures on absentee ballot requests to actual ballots. Trump condemned both Kemp and Raffensperger, tweeting that signature comparisons would give victories to not only him but also Senators [[David Perdue]] and [[Kelly Loeffler]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Linton |first1=Caroline |title=Georgia governor calls for audit after state certifies election results |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-recount-brian-kemp-audit-certified-election-results/ |accessdate=November 22, 2020 |work=CBS News|date=November 21, 2020}}</ref> Loeffler came in second place in the [[2020–21 United States Senate special election in Georgia|November 3 first round]] with 25.9% of the vote.
