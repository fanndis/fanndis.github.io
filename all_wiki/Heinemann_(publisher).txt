==Heinemann UK history==
[[William Heinemann]] began working in the publishing industry under [[Nicolas Trübner]],<ref name=interview>{{cite book|title=The Publishers' Circular and Booksellers' Record of British and Foreign Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcdOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA49|year=1895|publisher=Sampson Low, Marston & Company|pages=49–}}</ref> who was a major publisher of what was called Oriental scholarship.<ref>{{cite book|title=Trübner's American and Oriental Literary Record|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QUwUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA48|year=1884|publisher=Trübner & Company|pages=48–}}</ref> When, two years after Trübner's death, his company was taken over by the firm of [[Kegan Paul]], Heinemann left and founded '''William Heinemann Ltd''' in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]], in 1890.<ref name=interview/> The first title published was [[Hall Caine]]'s ''[[The Bondman (novel)|The Bondman]]'', which was a "stunning success", selling more than 450,000 copies.<ref name="EliotRose2009">{{cite book|last1=Eliot|first1=Simon|last2=Rose|first2=Jonathan|title=A Companion to the History of the Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8Pfs146nUAC&pg=PA343|accessdate=1 January 2013|date=2009-04-06|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781405192781|pages=343–}}</ref> The company also released a number of works translated into English under the branding of "Heinemann's International Library", edited by [[Edmund Gosse]].<ref name="MosseCarlebach">{{cite book|last1=Mosse|first1=Werner Eugen|last2=Carlebach|first2=Julius|title=Second Chance: two centuries of German-speaking Jews in the United Kingdom|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-6WlsDsuo8C&pg=PA196|accessdate=1 January 2013|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=9783161457418|pages=196–}}</ref> In 1893, [[Sydney Pawling]] became a partner.<ref name="Kipling1990">{{cite book|last=Kipling|first=Rudyard|title=The Letters of Rudyard Kipling: 1920-30|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersofrudyard0001kipl|url-access=registration|accessdate=1 January 2013|year=1990|publisher=University of Iowa Press|isbn=9780877458982|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lettersofrudyard0001kipl/page/43 43]–}}</ref><ref name="Ray2007">{{cite book|last=Ray|first=Martin|title=Joseph Conrad: Memories and Impressions - An Annotated Bibliography.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tbIZ1qt2CGIC&pg=PA37|accessdate=1 January 2013|year=2007|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9789042022980|pages=37–}}</ref> They became known for publishing the works of [[Sarah Grand]].<ref name=Bookman/> The company published the British version of [[Scribners]]' ''Great Education Series'' under the title ''Heinemann's Great Education Series'', but did not include credits for the original American editor, [[Nicholas Murray Butler]], an omission for which they were criticized.<ref name=Bookman>{{cite book|title=The Bookman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHVIAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA214|year=1895|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|pages=214–}}</ref>

Between 1895 and 1897, Heinemann was the publisher of [[William Ernest Henley]]'s periodical ''[[New Review]]''.<ref name="Wertheim1997">{{cite book|last=Wertheim|first=Stanley|title=A Stephen Crane Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uzry987mP4C&pg=PA151|accessdate=1 January 2013|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313296925|pages=151–}}</ref> In the late 1890s, Heinemann and the American publisher [[Frank Doubleday]] financially supported [[Joseph Conrad]] during his initial attempt at writing what eventually became ''[[The Rescue (Conrad novel)|The Rescue]]'', and Heinemann was the British publisher for Conrad's ''[[The Nigger of the 'Narcissus']]'' in 1897.<ref name="Ray2007"/> One of the company's businesses at that time was to sell English books to a Japan that was beginning to be interested in items of Western culture. Heinemann sold to the Japanese bookstore [[Maruzen]] translations of the works of [[Dostoyevsky]] and 5000 copies of ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' by Peter Kropotkin.<ref name="Checkland2003">{{cite book|last=Checkland|first=Olive|title=Japan and Britain After 1859: Creating Cultural Bridges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPpTfAK9oKwC&pg=PA67|accessdate=1 January 2013|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780700717477|pages=67–}}</ref> In 1912, the company began publishing the [[Loeb Classical Library]] series, publications of ancient works with the Greek or Latin text on the left-hand page, and a literal translation on the right hand page.<ref name="France2001">{{cite book|last=France|first=Peter|title=The Oxford Guide to Literature in English Translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pmNoS2dndKsC&pg=PA503|accessdate=1 January 2013|date=2001-12-13|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199247844|pages=503–}}</ref> The series has been called "the most significant" of the parallel-text translations.<ref name="France2001"/> Since 1934, it has been co-published with [[Harvard University]].<ref name="France2001"/><ref name="Hall1986">{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Max|title=Harvard University Press: A History|url=https://archive.org/details/harvarduniversit0000hall|url-access=registration|accessdate=1 January 2013|year=1986|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674380806|pages=[https://archive.org/details/harvarduniversit0000hall/page/64 64]–}}</ref>

On Heinemann's death in 1920 a majority stake was purchased by U.S. publisher [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]],<ref name="Kipling1990"/> with [[Theodore Byard]], who had previously been a professional singer, joining to lead the offices.<ref name="Kipling1990"/>

A subsidiary company was established in The Hague in 1953; originally intended to distribute works in English to continental Europe, it eventually began to directly print Heinemann's books as well.<ref name="EliotRose2009"/>

The company was later acquired by conglomerate [[Thomas Tilling]] in 1961. When the impending takeover became known, [[Graham Greene]] (who had been with Heinemann since his first work in 1929)<ref name="West2002"/> led a number of Heinemann authors who protested by taking their works to other publishers, including [[The Bodley Head]], of which Greene was a director.<ref name="West2002">{{cite book|last=West|first=W.

[[BTR plc|BTR]] bought Thomas Tilling in 1983, and were not interested in its publishing division, so Heinemann was put on the block. Heinemann was purchased by the [[Octopus Publishing Group]] in 1985, and shortly afterwards sold the sprawling Heinemann HQ in rural Kingswood, Surrey for development; Octopus was purchased by [[Reed International]] (now Reed Elsevier) in 1987. Heinemann Professional Publishing was merged with [[Butterworths]] Scientific in 1990 to form [[Butterworth-Heinemann]].<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-1-4831-0372-3| pages = | last = Medlik| first = S.| title = Managing Tourism| chapter = Publisher's note| date = 2016-06-06|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gB6TDAAAQBAJ&q=butterworths%20scientific%20reed%20international&pg=PR11}}</ref> [[Random House]] bought Heinemann's trade publishing (now named William Heinemann) in 1997. Heinemann's educational unit became part of [[Harcourt Education]] when Reed Elsevier purchased the company in 2001. [[Pearson plc|Pearson]] purchased the UK, South African, Australian and New Zealand arms of Harcourt Education in May 2007, while [[Houghton Mifflin]] purchased the American operations a few months later. 

In 1957, '''Heinemann Educational Books''' (HEB) created the [[African Writers Series]], spearheaded by [[Alan Hill (publisher)|Alan Hill]] and West Africa specialist [[Van Milne]], to focus on publishing the writers of Africa such as [[Chinua Achebe]], who was the first advisory editor of the series. Heinemann was awarded the 1992 Worldaware Award for Social Progress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldaware.org.uk/awards/awards1992/heinemann.html |title=Worldaware Business Awards 1992 - Williamson Tea Award for Social Progress |publisher=Worldaware.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-28}}</ref> The series was relaunched by Pearson in 2011.<ref>[http://www.naijastories.com/2011/08/pearson-revives-african-writers-series-calls-for-submissions/ "Pearson revives African Writers Series, calls for submissions"], Naija Stories, 4 August 2011.</ref><ref>Nicholas Norbrook, [http://www.theafricareport.com/Books/publishing-africa-writers-series-celebrates-50-years.html "Publishing Africa Writers Series celebrates 50 years"], ''The Africa Report'', 29 February 2012.</ref>

Inspired by the African Writers Series, [[Leon Comber]] launched the [[Writing in Asia Series]] in 1966 from Singapore. Two [[Austin Coates]] books in the series, ''Myself a Mandarin'' and ''City of Broken Promises'', became bestsellers, but the series, after publishing more than 70 titles, was to fold in 1984 when Heinemann Asia was taken over by a parent group of publishers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Comber|first1=Leon|title=Asian Voices in English|date=1991|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=9622092829|pages=79–86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSx_6K2R7UAC&q=heinemann+writing+in+asia+series|accessdate=10 April 2016}}</ref>

In 1970, the Caribbean Writers Series—modelled on the African Writers Series—was launched by [[James Currey]] and others at HEB to republish work by major Caribbean writers.<ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095928757 "Heinemann Caribbean Writers Series"], Oxford Index.</ref><ref>[http://assets.pearsonglobalschools.com/asset_mgr/current/201211/Caribbean%20Writers%20Series.pdf Caribbean Writers Series], Heinemann.</ref>
