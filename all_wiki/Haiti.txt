The island was originally inhabited by the indigenous [[Taíno]] people, who migrated from South America.

However, competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being [[Peace of Ryswick|ceded to France]] in 1697, which was subsequently named ''Saint-Domingue''. French colonists established lucrative [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantations]], worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa, which made the colony one of the richest in the world.

In the midst of the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99), slaves and [[free people of color]] launched the [[Haitian Revolution]] (1791–1804), led by a former slave and the first black general of the [[French Army]], [[Toussaint Louverture]]. After 12 years of conflict, [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte's forces were defeated by Louverture's successor, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] (later Emperor Jacques I), who declared Haiti's sovereignty on 1 January 1804—the first independent [[Nation state|nation]] of [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], the second [[republic]] in the Americas, the first country to abolish slavery, and the only state in history established by a successful [[Slave rebellion|slave revolt]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Anacaona, Golden Flower|author=Danticat, Edwidge|journal=Journal of Haitian Studies|publisher=Scholastic Inc.|year=2005|isbn=978-0-439-49906-4|volume=11|location=New York|pages=163–165|jstor=41715319|author-link=Edwidge Danticat|issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Matthewson, Tim|year=1996|title=Jefferson and the Nonrecognition of Haiti|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=140|issue=1|pages=22–48|issn=0003-049X|jstor=987274}}</ref> Apart from [[Alexandre Pétion]], the first President of the Republic, all of Haiti's first leaders were former slaves.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1202772.stm |title=Country profile: Haiti |date=19 January 2010 |work=BBC News |access-date=23 January 2010}}</ref> After a brief period in which the country was split in two, President [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]] united the country and then attempted to bring the whole of Hispaniola under Haitian control, precipitating a long series of wars that ended in the 1870s when Haiti formally recognized the independence of the Dominican Republic. Haiti's first century of independence was characterised by political instability, ostracism by the international community and the payment of a crippling debt to France. Political volatility and foreign economic influence in the country prompted the U.S. to occupy the country from 1915 to 1934. Following a series of short-lived presidencies, [[François Duvalier|François 'Papa Doc' Duvalier]] took power in 1956, ushering in a long period of autocratic rule that was continued by his son [[Jean-Claude Duvalier|Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier]] that lasted until 1986; the period was characterised by state-sanctioned violence against the opposition and civilians, corruption, and economic stagnation. Since 1986 Haiti has been attempting to establish a more democratic political system.

Haiti is a founding member of the [[United Nations]], [[Organization of American States]] (OAS),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/en/member_states/member_state.asp?sCode=HAI|title= OAS – Member State: Haiti|publisher=OAS – Organization of American States: Democracy for peace, security, and development|last=OAS|date=1 August 2009|website=www.oas.org}}</ref> [[Association of Caribbean States]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acs-aec.org/sites/default/files/english_ebook_acs_20_low_res.pdf |title=Association of Caribbean States (1994–2014) |editor=Press |page=46 |year=2014 |access-date=25 April 2016}}</ref> and the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Francophonie Organisation]].

Historically poor and politically unstable, Haiti has the lowest [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]] in the Americas. Since the turn of the 21st century, the country has endured a ''[[2004 Haitian coup d'état|coup d'état]],'' which prompted a [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti|U.N. intervention]], as well as [[2010 Haiti earthquake|a deadly earthquake]] that killed over 250,000.

The island of [[Hispaniola]], of which Haiti occupies the western three-eighths,<ref name="Dardik" /><ref name="Current Affairs" /> has been inhabited since about 5000 BC by groups of Native Americans thought to have arrived from Central or South America.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> Genetic studies show that some of these groups were related to the [[Yanomami]] of the [[Amazon Basin]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=LALUEZA-FOX |first1=C.|last2=CALDERÓN|first2=F.

The Taíno name for the entire island was ''Haiti'', or alternatively ''Quisqeya''.<ref name="Bradt9">Clammer, Paul, (2016) ''Bradt Travel Guide – Haiti'', p. 9</ref>

In Taíno society the largest unit of political organisation was led by a ''[[cacique]],'' or chief, as the Europeans understood them. The island of Hipaniola was divided among five 'caciquedoms': the Magua in the north east, the Marien in the north west, the Jaragua in the south west, the Maguana in the central regions of Cibao, and the Higüey in the south east.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cassá, Roberto |title=Los Indios de Las Antillas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJ-wJ49cNwAC&pg=PA126|year=1992|publisher=Editorial Abya Yala|isbn=978-84-7100-375-1|pages=126–}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Samuel M.|last=Wilson|year=1990|title=Hispaniola: Caribbean Chiefdoms in the Age of Columbus|publisher=University of Alabama Press|page=110|isbn=978-0-8173-0462-1}}</ref>

Taíno cultural artifacts include [[cave paintings]] in several locations in the country. These have become national symbols of Haiti and tourist attractions.

As in its [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana colony]], the [[New France|French colonial]] government allowed some rights to [[free people of color]] (''gens de couleur''), the [[mixed-race]] descendants of European male colonists and African female slaves (and later, mixed-race women).<ref name="Bradt11"/> Over time, many were released from slavery and they established a separate [[social class]].

Inspired by the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 and principles of the [[rights of man]], the French settlers and free people of color pressed for greater political freedom and more [[civil rights]].<ref name="Bradt12"/> Tensions between these two groups led to conflict, as a militia of free-coloreds was set up in 1790 by [[Vincent Ogé]], resulting in his capture, torture and execution.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> Sensing an opportunity, in August 1791 the first slave armies were established in northern Haiti under the leadership of [[Toussaint Louverture]] inspired by the Vodou ''houngan'' (priest) Boukman, and backed by the Spanish in Santo Domingo – soon a full-blown slave rebellion had broken out across the entire colony.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/>

In 1792, the [[French First Republic|French]] government sent three commissioners with troops to re-establish control; to build an alliance with the ''[[gens de couleur]]'' and slaves commissioners [[Léger-Félicité Sonthonax]] and [[Étienne Polverel]] abolished slavery in the colony.<ref name="Bradt12"/> Six months later, the [[National Convention]], led by [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] and the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]], endorsed [[abolition of slavery timeline|abolition]] and extended it to all the French colonies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/291/ |title=Decree of the National Convention of 4 February 1794, Abolishing Slavery in all the Colonies |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |access-date=24 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603234817/http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/291/ |archive-date=3 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Political leaders in the [[United States]], which was a new republic itself, reacted with ambivalence, at times providing aid to enable [[Planter (plantation owner)|planters]] to put down the revolt.

After losing the support of Haiti's elite, Boyer was ousted in 1843, with [[Charles Rivière-Hérard]] replacing him as president.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> Nationalist Dominican forces in eastern Hispaniola led by [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] seized control of Santo Domingo on 27 February 1844.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> The Haitian forces, unprepared for a significant uprising, capitulated to the rebels, effectively ending Haitian rule of eastern Hispaniola. In March Rivière-Hérard attempted to reimpose his authority, but the [[Dominican Republic|Dominicans]] put up stiff opposition and inflicted heavy losses.<ref name="Bethell" /> Rivière-Hérard was removed from office by the mulatto hierarchy and replaced with the aged general [[Philippe Guerrier]], who assumed the presidency on 3 May 1844.

Guerrier died in April 1845, and was succeeded by General [[Jean-Louis Pierrot]].<ref name="leger197">{{cite book|last=Léger|first=Jacques Nicolas|title=Haiti: Her History and Her Detractors|year=1907|publisher=The Neale Publishing Company|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Haiti:_Her_History_and_Her_Detractors|pages=197–98}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Pierrot's most pressing duty as the new president was to check the incursions of the Dominicans, who were harassing the Haitian troops.<ref name="leger197"/> Dominican gunboats were also making depredations on Haiti's coasts.<ref name="leger197" />  President Pierrot decided to open a campaign against the Dominicans, whom he considered merely as insurgents, however the Haitian offensive of 1845 was stopped on the frontier.<ref name="Bethell">{{cite book|last1=Bethell|first1=Leslie|title=The Cambridge History of Latin America: Volume 3|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory0000beth|url-access=registration|date=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory0000beth/page/267 267–69]}}</ref>

On 1 January 1846 Pierrot announced a fresh campaign to re-imposed Haitian suzerainty over eastern Hispaniola, but his officers and men greeted this fresh summons with contempt.<ref name="Bethell" /> Thus, a month later – February 1846 – when Pierrot ordered his troops to march against the Dominicans, the Haitian army mutinied, and its soldiers proclaimed his overthrow as president of the republic.<ref name="Bethell" /> With the war against the Dominicans having become very unpopular in Haiti, it was beyond the power of the new president, General [[Jean-Baptiste Riché]], to stage another invasion.<ref name="Bethell" />

====Second Empire (1849–1859)====
{{main|Second Empire of Haiti}}
[[File:Faustin I.jpg|thumb|Faustin I, from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 16 February 1856]]
On 27 February 1847, President Riché died after only a year in power and was replaced by an obscure officer, General [[Faustin Soulouque]].<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> During the first two years of Soulouque's administration the conspiracies and opposition he faced in retaining power were so manifold that the Dominicans were given a further breathing space in which to consolidate their independence.<ref name="Bethell" /> But, when in 1848 France finally recognized the Dominican Republic as a free and independent state and provisionally signed a treaty of peace, friendship, commerce and navigation, Haiti immediately protested, claiming the treaty was an attack upon their own security.<ref name="Bethell" /> Soulouque decided to invade the new Republic before the French Government could ratify the treaty.<ref name="Bethell" />

On 21 March 1849, Haitian soldiers attacked the Dominican garrison at [[Las Matas de Farfán|Las Matas]]. The demoralized defenders offered almost no resistance before abandoning their weapons. Soulouque pressed on, capturing [[San Juan Province (Dominican Republic)|San Juan]]. This left only the town of [[Azua, Dominican Republic|Azua]] as the remaining Dominican stronghold between the Haitian army and the capital. On 6 April, Azua fell to the 18,000-strong Haitian army, with a 5,000-man Dominican counterattack failing to oust them.<ref name="Latin America's Wars: Volume 1"/> The way to [[Santo Domingo]] was now clear. But the news of discontent existing at Port-au-Prince, which reached Soulouque, arrested his further progress and caused him to return with the army to his capital.<ref name="Jacques">{{cite book|last=Léger|first=Jacques Nicolas|title=Haiti: Her History and Her Detractors|year=1907|publisher=The Neale Publishing Company|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Haiti:_Her_History_and_Her_Detractors|pages=202–04}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

Emboldened by the sudden retreat of the Haitian army, the Dominicans counter-attacked. Their flotilla went as far as [[Dame-Marie, Grand'Anse|Dame-Marie]], which they plundered and set on fire.<ref name="Jacques" /> Soulouque, now self-proclaimed as Emperor Faustin I, decided to start a new campaign against them. In 1855, he again invaded the territory of the Dominican Republic. But owing to insufficient preparation, the army was soon in want of victuals and ammunition.<ref name="Jacques" /> In spite of the bravery of the soldiers, the Emperor had once more to give up the idea of a unified island under Haitian control.<ref name="Jacques" /> After this campaign, Britain and France interfered and obtained an armistice on behalf of the Dominicans, who declared independence as the Dominican Republic.<ref name="Jacques" />

The sufferings endured by the soldiers during the campaign of 1855, and the losses and sacrifices inflicted on the country without yielding any compensation or any practical results provoked great discontent.<ref name="Jacques" /> In 1858 a revolution began, led by General [[Fabre Geffrard]], Duke of Tabara. In December of that year, Geffrard defeated the Imperial Army and seized control of most of the country.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> As a result, the Emperor abdicated his throne on 15 January 1859. Refused aid by the French Legation, Faustin was taken into exile aboard a British warship on 22 January 1859, and General Geffrard succeeded him as President.

{{Main|Geography of Haiti}}
[[File:Haiti topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Topographical map of Haiti]]
Haiti forms the western three-eighths of [[Hispaniola]], the second largest island in the [[Greater Antilles]]. At 27,750 sq km Haiti is the third largest country in the Caribbean behind [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], the latter sharing a {{convert|360|km|mi|0|adj=on}} [[Dominican Republic–Haiti border|border]] with Haiti. The country has a roughly horseshoe shape and because of this it has a disproportionately long coastline, second in length ({{convert|1771|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) behind Cuba in the Greater Antilles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/placesinthenews/archive/2010arch/20100114_haiti.html |title=Geography: Haiti |access-date=29 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/caribb/haiti/htland.htm |title=Geography: Haiti| access-date=29 September 2014}}</ref>

Haiti is the most mountainous nation in the Caribbean, its terrain consists of mountains interspersed with small coastal plains and river valleys.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – Haiti"/> The climate is tropical, with some variation depending on altitude. The highest point is [[Pic la Selle]], at {{convert|2680|m|ft|0|}}.<ref name="NgCheong-Lum, Roseline 19" /><ref name="CIA World Factbook – Haiti"/><ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/>

The northern region consists of the ''[[Massif du Nord]]'' (Northern Massif) and the ''[[Plaine du Nord]]'' (Northern Plain). The ''Massif du Nord'' is an extension of the ''Cordillera Central'' in the Dominican Republic.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> It begins at Haiti's eastern border, north of the [[Guayamouc River]], and extends to the northwest through the northern peninsula. The lowlands of the ''Plaine du Nord'' lie along the northern border with the Dominican Republic, between the ''Massif du Nord'' and the North Atlantic Ocean.

The central region consists of two plains and two sets of mountain ranges. The ''Plateau Central'' (Central Plateau) extends along both sides of the Guayamouc River, south of the ''Massif du Nord''. It runs from the southeast to the northwest. To the southwest of the ''Plateau Central'' are the ''[[Montagnes Noires, Haiti|Montagnes Noires]]'', whose most northwestern part merges with the ''Massif du Nord''. Haiti's most important valley in terms of crops is the Plaine de l'Artibonite, which lies between the Montagnes Noires and the [[Chaîne des Matheux]].<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> This region supports the country's (also Hispaniola's) longest river, the [[Artibonite River|Riviere l'Artibonite]], which begins in the western region of the Dominican Republic and continues for most of its length through central Haiti, where it then empties into the [[Gulf of Gonâve|Golfe de la Gonâve]].<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> Also in this valley lies Haiti's second largest lake, [[Lac de Péligre]], formed as a result of the construction of the [[Péligre Dam]] in the mid-1950s.<ref name=Wells>Jennifer Wells, [https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2010/11/21/a_dam_for_the_people_and_a_people_damned.html "A dam for the people, and A people damned"], ‘’Toronto Star’’, 21 November 2010</ref>

[[File:Artibonite River in Haiti (2010).jpg|thumb|right|The Artibonite River in central Haiti]]
The southern region consists of the ''[[Plaine du Cul-de-Sac]]'' (the southeast) and the mountainous southern peninsula (also known as the [[Tiburon Peninsula, Haiti|Tiburon Peninsula]]). The Plaine du Cul-de-Sac is a natural depression that harbors the country's saline lakes, such as [[Trou Caïman]] and Haiti's largest lake, [[Étang Saumatre]]. The [[Chaîne de la Selle]] mountain range – an extension of the southern mountain chain of the Dominican Republic (the Sierra de Baoruco) – extends from the Massif de la Selle in the east to the [[Massif de la Hotte]] in the west.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/>

Haiti also includes several offshore islands. The island of [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] (Île de la Tortue) is located off the coast of northern Haiti. The [[Arrondissements of Haiti|arrondissement]] of [[Gonâve Island|La Gonâve]] is located on the island of the same name, in the [[Gulf of Gonâve|Golfe de la Gonâve]]; Haiti's largest island, Gonâve is moderately populated by rural villagers. [[Île à Vache]] (Cow Island) is located off the southwest coast; also part of Haiti are the [[Cayemites]], located in the Gulf of Gonâve north of [[Pestel, Grand'Anse|Pestel]].

[[File:Haiti deforestation.jpg|thumb|Haiti's border with the [[Dominican Republic]] in 2002, showing the extent of deforestation on the Haitian side (left)]]

The [[Erosion|soil erosion]] released from the upper catchments and [[deforestation]] have caused periodic and severe flooding in Haiti, as experienced, for example, on 17 September 2004. Earlier in May that year, floods had killed over 3,000 people on Haiti's southern border with the Dominican Republic.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/hurricane/2004-09-23-haiti-deforest_x.htm |title=Deforestation Exacerbates Haiti Floods |work=USA Today |date=23 September 2004 |access-date=24 July 2013}}</ref>

Haiti's forests covered 60% of the country as recently as 50 years ago, but that has been halved to a current estimate of 30% tree cover, according to more recent environmental analysis. This estimate poses a stark difference from the erroneous figure of 2% which has been oft-cited in discourse concerning the country's environmental condition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.envirosociety.org/2016/05/haiti-is-covered-with-trees/ |title=Haiti Is Covered with Trees |website=EnviroSociety |author=Tarter, Andrew |access-date=19 May 2016}}</ref>

Conversely, according to the 2013 [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] ([[UNODC]]) report, murder rates in Haiti (10.2 per 100,000) are far ''below'' the regional average (26 per 100,000); less than {{sfrac|1|4}} that of Jamaica (39.3 per 100,000) and nearly {{sfrac|1|2}} that of the Dominican Republic (22.1 per 100,000), making it among the safer countries in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2014/April/some-437000-people-murdered-worldwide-in-2012-according-to-new-unodc-study.html |title=Some 437,000 people murdered worldwide in 2012, according to new UNODC study |access-date=12 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf |title=Global Study on Homicide |year=2013 |publisher=UNODC |access-date=20 April 2015}}</ref> In large part, this is due to the country's ability to fulfil a pledge by increasing its national police yearly by 50%, a four-year initiative that was started in 2012.

In 2010, the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) sent a team of veteran officers to Haiti to assist in the rebuilding of its police force with special training in investigative techniques, strategies to improve the anti-kidnapping personnel and community outreach to build stronger relationships with the public especially among the youth. It has also helped the HNP set up a police unit in the center of [[Delmas, Ouest|Delmas]], a neighborhood of Port-au-Prince.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2014/11/17/19200343/ |agency=Associated Press|title=NYPD officers train Haitian police |work=USA Today |date=17 November 2014 |access-date=20 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2010/01/21/nypd-to-help-train-haitian-police/ |title=NYPD to help train Haitian police |editor=Weiss, Murray |work=New York Post |date=21 January 2011 |access-date=20 April 2015}}</ref><ref name="USAID">{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/haiti/governance-rule-law-and-security |title=Haiti: governance, Rule of Law, and Security |publisher=USAID |access-date=20 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426002122/http://www.usaid.gov/haiti/governance-rule-law-and-security |archive-date=26 April 2015  }}</ref>

In 2012 and 2013, 150 HNP officers received specialized training funded by the US government, which also contributed to the infrastructure and communications support by upgrading radio capacity and constructing new police stations from the most violent-prone neighborhoods of [[Cité Soleil]] and [[Grande Ravine]] in Port-au-Prince to the new northern industrial park at [[Caracol, Nord-Est|Caracol]].<ref name="USAID" />

=== Haitian penitentiary system ===
[[Port-au-Prince]] [[Prison|penitentiary]] is home to half of Haiti's prisoners. The prison has a capacity of 1,200 [[Detention (imprisonment)|detainees]] but {{as of|2017|November|lc=y}} the penitentiary was obliged to keep 4,359 detainees, a 454% occupancy level.<ref name="auto">{{Cite news |url=https://apnews.com/a43ce17acfd0425cb2af90a1133a8418 |title=Malnutrition killing inmates in Haiti jails |work=apnews.com |first=David |last=McFadden |date=20 February 2017 |access-date=2 January 2020}}</ref> This leads to severe consequences for the inmates.

One cell could hold up to 60 inmates which was originally designed for only 18, therefore creating tight and uncomfortable living conditions. The inmates are forced to create makeshift [[hammock]]s from the wall and ceilings. The men are on a 22/ 23 hour lock up in the cells so the risk of diseases is very high.<ref name="auto" /> Unable to receive sufficient funds from the government as Haiti endures severe natural disasters which takes up their attention and resources, such as the 2010 earthquake, has caused deadly cases of [[malnutrition]], combined with the tight living conditions, increases the risk of infectious diseases such as [[tuberculosis]] which has led to 21 deaths in January 2017 alone at the Port-au-Prince penitentiary.<ref name="auto" />

Haitian law states that once arrested, one must go before a judge within 48 hours; however, this is very rare. In an interview with [[Unreported World]], the prison governor stated that around 529 detainees were never sentenced, there are 3,830 detainees who are in prolonged detained trial detention. Therefore, 80% are not convicted.<ref>{{Citation|last=Unreported World|title=Haiti's prison from hell {{!}} Unreported World|date=30 November 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwE_uUgomd0|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref>

Unless families are able to provide the necessary funds for inmates to appear before a judge there is a very slim chance the inmate would have a trial, on average, within 10 years. [[Brian Concannon]], the director of the non-profit Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, claims that without a substantial bribe to persuade judges, prosecutors and lawyers to undergo their case, there is no prospect for getting a trial for years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/02/20/living-hell-officials-alarmed-by-upsurge-inmates-dying-in-haiti-prisons.html|title=Living hell: Officials alarmed by upsurge of inmates dying in Haiti prisons|date=20 February 2017|work=Fox News|access-date=30 March 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

Families may send food to the penitentiary; however, most inmates depend on the meals served twice a day. However, the majority of the meals consists of ration supplies of rice, oats or cornmeal, which has led to deadly cases of malnutrition-related ailments such as [[Thiamine deficiency|beriberi]] and [[Anemia|anaemia]]. Prisoners too weak are crammed in the penitentiary infirmary.<ref name="prison">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39034992|title=Haitian prison rife with malnutrition|date=21 February 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=30 March 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In confined living spaces for 22–23 hours a day, inmates are not provided with latrines and are forced to [[Defecation|defecate]] into plastic bags and leave them outside their cells. These conditions were considered inhumane by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 2008.<ref name="prison" />

===Energy===

In 1925, the city of [[Jacmel]] was the first area in the Caribbean to have electricity and was subsequently dubbed the ''City of Light''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/lighting-the-way-forward-in-haiti/article1319729/?service=mobile |title=Lighting the way forward in Haiti |author=Leeder, Jessica |work=The Globe and Mail |year=2012 }}</ref>

Today, Haiti relies heavily on an oil alliance with [[Petrocaribe]] for much of its energy requirements. In recent years, hydroelectric, solar and wind energy have been explored as possible sustainable energy sources.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.clintonfoundation.org/our-work/clinton-foundation-haiti/programs/powering-haiti-clean-energy |title=Powering Haiti with Clean Energy}}</ref>
[[File:Power plant in Port-au-Prince.JPEG|thumb|Power plant in Port-au-Prince]]
As of 2017, among all the countries in the Americas, Haiti is producing the least amount of energy. Less than a quarter of the country has electric coverage.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=May 2017|title=The Haiti Sustainable Energy Programme|url=https://postconflict.unep.ch/publications/UNEP_Haiti_sustainable_energy.pdf|journal=UNEP}}</ref> Most regions of Haiti that do have energy are powered by generators. These generators are often expensive and produce a lot of pollution. The areas that do get electricity experience power cuts on a daily basis, and some areas are limited to 12 hours of electricity a day. Electricity is provided by a small number of independent companies: Sogener, E-power, and Haytrac.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pauyo|first=Jean|date=March 2017|title=Transmitting and Distributing Electricity in Haiti|url=https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/electricity_grid_pauyo_english.pdf|journal=Copenhagen Consensus Center}}</ref> There is no national electricity grid within the country.<ref name=":02">Matthew Lucky, Katie Auth, Alexander Ochs, et al., Haiti Sustainable Energy Roadmap: Harnessing Domestic Energy Resources to Build an Affordable, Reliable, and Climate-Compatible Electricity System (Washington, DC: Worldwatch Institute, 2014).</ref> The most common source of energy used is wood, along with charcoal.

To meet this objective, 236 Megawatt needs to installed in Port-au-Prince alone, with an additional 75 Megawatt needed in all other regions in the country. Presently only 27,5% of the population has access to electricity; moreover, the national energy agency l'Électricité d'Haïti (Ed'H) is only able to meet 62% of overall electricity demand said Fritz Caillot, the Minister of Public Works, Transportation and Communication (Travaux publics, transport et communication (TPTC)).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vantbefinfo.com/energie-le-projet-delectrification-24-24-presente-aux-citoyens-haitiens/|title=Vant Bèf Info Énergie : le projet d'électrification 24/24 présenté aux Citoyens haïtiens -|date=31 October 2018|work=Vant Bèf Info|access-date=4 November 2018|language=fr-FR}}</ref>

The middle and upper classes live in suburbs, or in the central part of the bigger cities in apartments, where there is urban planning. Many of the houses they live in are like miniature fortresses, located behind walls embedded with metal spikes, barbed wire, broken glass, and sometimes all three. The gates to these houses are barred at night, the house is locked; guard dogs patrol the yard. These houses are often self-sufficient as well. The houses have backup generators, because the electrical grid in Haiti is unreliable. Some even have rooftop reservoirs for water, as the water supply is also unreliable.<ref name="c151222" />

The [[Haitian gourde]] (HTG) is the national currency. The "[[Haitian gourde|Haitian dollar]]" equates to 5 gourdes (''goud''), which is a fixed exchange rate that exists in concept ''only,'' but are commonly used as informal prices.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} The vast majority of the business sector and individuals in Haiti will also accept US dollars, though at the outdoor markets gourdes may be preferred. Locals may refer to the USD as "dollar américain" (''dola ameriken'') or "dollar US" (pronounced ''oo-es'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haitihub.com/download/Money-Matters-in-Haiti.pdf |title=All About Money: Gourdes, Dollars and Sense for Work and Life in Haiti|publisher=haitihub.com |access-date=16 February 2014}}</ref>

===Tourism===

[[File:Labadee.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Labadee]], a cruise ship destination]]

The tourism market in Haiti is undeveloped and the government is heavily promoting this sector. Haiti has many of the features that attract tourists to other Caribbean destinations, such as white sand beaches, mountainous scenery and a year-round warm climate, however the country's poor image overseas, at times exaggerated, has hampered the development of this sector.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> In 2014, the country received 1,250,000 tourists (mostly from cruise ships), and the industry generated US$200 million in 2014.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

The park is part of a "master plan" for Haiti's North and North-East departments, including the expansion of the [[Cap-Haïtien International Airport]] to accommodate large international flights, the construction of an international Seaport in [[Fort-Liberté]] and the opening of the $50 million Roi Henri Christophe Campus of a new university in Limonade (near Cap-Haïtien) on 12 January 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/22/haiti-clinton-caracol-idUSL1E8LM3BF20121022 |title=Clintons preside at star-studded opening of Haitian industrial park |publisher=Reuters.com |date=22 October 2012 |access-date=24 July 2013}}</ref>

[[South Korea]]n clothing manufacturer [[Sae-A Trading Co.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport in Haiti}}
[[File:Haiti rail map 1925.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Rail map as of 1925]]

Haiti has two main highways that run from one end of the country to the other. The northern highway, Route Nationale No. 1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince, winding through the coastal towns of [[Montrouis]] and [[Gonaïves]], before reaching its terminus at the northern port [[Cap-Haïtien]]. The southern highway, Route Nationale No. 2, links Port-au-Prince with [[Les Cayes]] via [[Léogâne]] and [[Petit-Goâve]]. The state of Haiti's roads are generally poor, many being potholed and becoming impassable in rough weather.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/>

According to the Washington Post, "Officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Saturday [23 January 2010] that they assessed the damage from the [12 January] quake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and found that many of the roads aren't any worse than they were before because they've always been in poor condition."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/23/AR2010012302113.html |title=Haiti's Bad Roads not Damaged by Quake, Army Engineers Say |author=Hedgpeth, Dana |work=The Washington Post |date=23 January 2010 |access-date=24 July 2013}}</ref>

The port at Port-au-Prince, [[Port international de Port-au-Prince]],  has more registered shipping than any of the other dozen ports in the country. The port's facilities include [[Crane (machine)|cranes]], large [[Berth (moorings)|berths]], and [[warehouse]]s, but these facilities are not in good condition. The port is underused, possibly due to the substantially high port fees. The port of [[Saint-Marc]] is currently the preferred port of entry for consumer goods coming into Haiti. Reasons for this may include its location away from volatile and [[Traffic congestion|congested]] Port-au-Prince, as well as its central location relative to numerous Haitian cities.

In the past, Haiti used rail transport, however the rail infrastructure was poorly maintained when in use and cost of rehabilitation is beyond the means of the Haitian economy. In 2018 the Regional Development Council of the Dominican Republic proposed a "trans-Hispaniola" railway between both countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreamintv.com/single-post/2018/02/20/CRD-Wants-to-Build-Railway-that-Runs-Through-Haiti|title=CRD Wants to Build Railway that Runs Through Haiti|website=www.dreamintv.com|date=20 February 2018|access-date=17 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117222328/https://www.dreamintv.com/single-post/2018/02/20/CRD-Wants-to-Build-Railway-that-Runs-Through-Haiti|archive-date=17 November 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Airports===
[[File:Toussaint Louverture International Airport.jpg|thumb|Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport]]
{{Main|List of airports in Haiti}}

[[Toussaint Louverture International Airport]], located {{convert|10|km}} North/North East of Port-au-Prince proper in the commune of [[Tabarre]], is the primary transportation hub regarding entry and exit into the country. It has Haiti's main [[jetway]], and along with [[Cap-Haïtien International Airport]] located near the northern city of Cap-Haïtien, handles the vast majority of the country's international flights. Cities such as Jacmel, Jérémie, Les Cayes, and Port-de-Paix have smaller, less accessible airports that are serviced by [[regional airlines]] and private aircraft. Such companies include: [[Caribintair]]  (defunct), [[Sunrise Airways]] and [[Tortug' Air]] (defunct).

In 2013, plans for the development of an international airport on Île-à-Vache were introduced by the Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-9270-haiti-tourism-official-launch-of-project-tourist-destination-ile-a-vache.html|title=Haiti – Tourism : Official launch of project "Tourist destination Ile-à-Vache" – HaitiLibre.com : Haiti news 7/7|work=HaitiLibre.com}}</ref>

===Bus service===
[[File:Tap tap public transportation Haiti.jpg|thumb|A "Tap tap" bus in [[Port-Salut]] ]]

[[Tap tap]] buses are colorfully painted buses or pick-up trucks that serve as share taxis.

They follow fixed routes, do not leave until filled with passengers, and riders can usually disembark at any point. The decorations are a typically Haitian form of art.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/news/doc/un-volunteer-takes-part.html |title=UN Volunteer takes part in art exhibition in Germany |access-date=29 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202105103/http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/news/doc/un-volunteer-takes-part.html |archive-date=2 February 2014  }}</ref>

===Communications===
{{Main|Telecommunications in Haiti|Television in Haiti}}

In Haiti, communications include the radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Haiti ranked last among North American countries in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI){{snd}} an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. Haiti ranked number 143 out of 148 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, down from 141 in 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR/2014/GITR_OverallRanking_2014.pdf | title=NRI Overall Ranking 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | access-date=28 June 2014}}</ref>

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Haiti}}

Haiti faces key challenges in the [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]]
sector:
Notably, access to public services is very low, their quality is inadequate and public institutions remain very weak despite foreign aid and the government's declared intent to strengthen the sector's institutions. Foreign and Haitian [[NGO]]s play an important role in the sector, especially in rural and urban slum areas.

===Racial discrimination===
{{Main|Gens de couleur}}

Under colonial rule, [[Mulatto|Haitian mulattoes]] were generally privileged above the black majority, though they possessed fewer rights than the white population. Following the country's independence, they became the nation's social elite. Numerous leaders throughout Haiti's history have been mulattoes. During this time, the slaves and the [[affranchi]]s were given limited opportunities toward education, income, and occupations, but even after gaining independence, the social structure remains a legacy today as the disparity between the upper and lower classes have not been reformed significantly since the colonial days.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2574763|title=Class Structure and Class Conflict in Haitian Society|first1=Roland|last1=Wingfield|first2=Vernon J.|last2=Parenton|date=1965|journal=Social Forces|volume=43|issue=3|pages=338–347|doi=10.2307/2574763}}</ref> Comprising 5% of the nation's population, mulattoes have retained their preeminence, evident in the political, economic, social and cultural hierarchy in Haiti.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smucker|first=Glenn R|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+ht0033%29|title=A Country Study: Haiti; The Upper Class|editor=Haggerty, Richard A. |publisher=Library of Congress Federal Research Division|date=December 1989}}</ref> As a result, the elite class today consists of a small group of influential people who are generally light in color and continue to establish themselves in high, prestigious positions.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2769747|title=Caste and Class in Haiti|first=John|last=Lobb|date=2018|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=23–34|doi=10.1086/218523|s2cid=144100302}}</ref>

===Languages===
The two official languages of Haiti are [[French language|French]] and [[Haitian Creole]]. French is the principal written and administratively authorized language (as well as the main language of the press) and is spoken by 42% of Haitians.<ref>{{cite book|title=La langue française dans le monde 2014|date=2014|publisher=Nathan|isbn=978-2-09-882654-0|url=http://www.francophonie.org/Langue-Francaise-2014/projet/Rapport-OIF-2014.pdf|access-date=20 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412002239/http://www.francophonie.org/Langue-Francaise-2014/projet/Rapport-OIF-2014.pdf|archive-date=12 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>À ce propos, voir l'essai ''Prétendus Créolismes : le couteau dans l'igname'', Jean-Robert Léonidas, Cidihca, Montréal 1995</ref> It is spoken by all educated Haitians, is the medium of instruction in most schools, and is used in the business sector. It is also used in ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church Masses. Haiti is one of two independent nations in the Americas (along with Canada) to designate French as an [[official language]]; the other French-speaking areas are all [[French overseas departments and territories|overseas]] ''[[Departments of France|départements]]'', or ''[[Overseas collectivity|collectivités]],'' of France, such as [[French Guiana]].

Frequent subjects in Haitian art include big, delectable foods, lush landscapes, market activities, jungle animals, rituals, dances, and gods. As a result of a deep history and strong African ties, symbols take on great meaning within Haitian society. For example, a rooster often represents Aristide and the red and blue colors of the Haitian flag often represent his Lavalas party.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Many artists cluster in 'schools' of painting, such as the Cap-Haïtien school, which features depictions of daily life in the city, the Jacmel School, which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town, or the Saint-Soleil School, which is characterised by abstracted human forms and is heavily influenced by Vodou symbolism.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In the 1920s the ''indigéniste'' movement gained international acclaim, with its expressionist paintings inspired by Haiti's culture and African roots. Notable painters of this movement include [[Hector Hyppolite]], [[Philomé Oban]] and [[Préfète Duffaut]].<ref name="Bradt36">Clammer, Paul, (2016) ''Bradt Travel Guide – Haiti'', p. 36</ref> Some notable artists of more recent times include [[Edouard Duval-Carrié]], [[Frantz Zéphirin]], [[Leroy Exil]], [[Prosper Pierre Louis]] and [[Louisiane Saint Fleurant]].<ref name="Bradt36"/> Sculpture is also practised in Haiti; noted artists in this form include [[George Liautaud]] and [[Serge Jolimeau]].<ref name="Bradt37">Clammer, Paul, (2016) ''Bradt Travel Guide – Haiti'', p. 37</ref>

===Music and dance===
{{Further|Music of Haiti}}

Haitian music combines a wide range of influences drawn from the many people who have settled here. It reflects French, African and Spanish elements and others who have inhabited the island of [[Hispaniola]], and minor native [[Taino]] influences. Styles of music unique to the nation of Haiti include music derived from [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] ceremonial traditions, [[Rara]] parading music, [[Twoubadou]] ''ballads'', [[mini-jazz]] rock bands, [[Rasin]] movement, [[Haitian hip hop|Hip hop]] kreyòl, [[méringue]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afropop.org/radio/radio_program/ID/692/Music%20and%20the%20Story%20of%20Haiti|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113022326/http://www.afropop.org/radio/radio_program/ID/692/Music%20and%20the%20Story%20of%20Haiti|archive-date= 13 November 2007 |title=Music and the Story of Haiti |publisher=Afropop Worldwide}}</ref> and [[compas]].

===Literature===
{{Main|Haitian literature}}

Haiti has always been a literary nation that has produced poetry, novels, and plays of international recognition. The [[Saint Domingue|French colonial experience]] established the French language as the venue of culture and prestige, and since then it has dominated the literary circles and the literary production. However, since the 18th century there has been a sustained effort to write in [[Haitian Creole]]. The recognition of Creole as an official language has led to an expansion of novels, poems, and plays in Creole.<ref>{{Cite book |last=[http://www.voicesfromhaiti.com/2012/06/meet-dr-marie-jose-nzengou-tayo/ Nzengou-Tayo] |first= Marie-José  |title=Creole and French in Haitian Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4xbGzLuBvWwC&pg=PA153|journal=The Haitian Creole Language: History, Structure, Use, and Education |language=en |publisher=Lexington Books |pages=153–176 |isbn=978-0-7391-7221-6|date= 2012}}</ref> In 1975, [[Franketienne]] was the first to break with the French tradition in fiction with the publication of ''Dezafi,'' the first novel written entirely in Haitian Creole; the work offers a poetic picture of Haitian life.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewyPMi4WZPAC |title=Frankétienne and Rewriting: A Work in Progress |last=Douglas |first=Rachel |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7391-3635-5 |pages=50–60}}</ref> Other well known Haitian authors include [[Jean Price-Mars]], [[Jacques Roumain]], [[Marie Vieux-Chauvet]], [[Pierre Clitandre]], [[René Depestre]], [[Edwidge Danticat]], [[Lyonel Trouillot]] and [[Dany Laferrière]].

Most people living in Haiti are at high risk for major infectious diseases. Food or [[Waterborne diseases|water-borne]] diseases include bacterial and protozoal [[diarrhea]], [[typhoid fever]] and [[hepatitis]] A and E; common [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]-borne diseases are [[dengue fever]] and [[malaria]]; water-contact diseases include [[leptospirosis]]. Roughly 75% of Haitian households lack running water. Unsafe water, along with inadequate housing and unsanitary living conditions, contributes to the high incidence of infectious diseases. There is a chronic shortage of health care personnel and hospitals lack resources, a situation that became readily apparent after the January 2010 earthquake.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA528274 |title=The Geology of Haiti: An Annotated Bibliography of Haiti's Geology, Geography and Earth Science |author1=Robert Lee Hadden |author2=Steven G.
