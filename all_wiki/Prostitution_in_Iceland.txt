'''Prostitution in Iceland''' is thriving despite paying for sex being illegal.<ref name="icemon" /> 

The police have stated that they do not have the resources to enforce the law. Consequently, a vigilante group called "Stóra systir" ("Big Sister") has been formed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/Big_Sister_Watches_Buyers_of_Prostitution_in_Iceland_0_383393.news.aspx |title=Big Sister Watches Buyers of Prostitution in Iceland |publisher=Iceland Review |date=19 October 2011}}</ref>

==History==
Before 2007, selling sex was illegal: according to the 206th article of the Icelandic Penal Code (almenn hegningarlög): "Anyone engaging in prostitution for own upkeep shall be subject to imprisonment for up to 2 years." That paragraph was deleted in 2007, as the "government argues most people who [[Soliciting|solicit]] sex do so because they have no other choice or because they are forced into prostitution by others. By making soliciting sex legal, the government believes individuals who have been forced into prostitution would rather come forward and lead police to those responsible."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16567&ew_0_a_id=272499 |title=Prostitution legal in Iceland |publisher=Iceland Review |date=27 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://icelandreview.com/icelandreview/search/news/Default.asp?ew_0_a_id=272985 |title=Land of double morale |publisher=Iceland Review |date=30 March 2007}}</ref>

In 2009, paying for sex was outlawed, criminalizing the [[Client (prostitution)|clients]], while selling sex remained decriminalized. The new law placed Iceland in line with [[Prostitution in Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Prostitution in Norway|Norway]], [[Prostitution in Canada|Canada]] also introduced a similar law in 2014.

==Legacy==
There is little soliciting for [[street prostitution]] since the law came into effect. Many prostitutes have taken to advertising through dating websites, although the sites have a policy of removing suspicious profiles. Sex workers also find clients by word of mouth. Iceland's courts heard 20 cases relating to prostitution charges between the advent of the new law and April 2013. Most resulted in convictions, but the penalties are light and the names of some of those found guilty have been kept anonymous. Icelandic police say that a lack of cash and staff prevent them from rigorously enforcing the law.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Naked ambition |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21576366-iceland-determined-outlaw-worlds-oldest-business-can-it-succeed-naked-ambition |newspaper=The Economist |location=Reykjavik |date=20 April 2013 |access-date=25 November 2015 }}</ref>

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Iceland}}
A US report concludes that Iceland is a destination and transit country for women subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Women from [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Baltics]], and [[South America]] are subjected to sex trafficking, often in nightclubs and bars. Traffickers reportedly exploit the visa-free regime in the [[Schengen Zone]] and the [[European Economic Area]] to bring victims to Iceland for up to three months and move them out of the country before they must register with local authorities.<ref name="state17">{{cite web|title=Iceland 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271204.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703181304/https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271204.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 July 2017|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=1 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>

Article 227a of the criminal code criminalises both sex trafficking and forced labor and prescribes penalties of up to 12 years imprisonment.<ref name="state17" />

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] downgraded Iceland's ranking in 2017 from a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 1]]' to a 'Tier 2' country.<ref name="state17" />
