'''Franklin Delano Roosevelt''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|oʊ|z|ə|v|əl|t}},<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX_v0zxM23Q|title=President Franklin Roosevelt 1933 Inauguration|publisher=[[C-SPAN]]|via=YouTube |date=January 14, 2009|access-date=July 24, 2017}}</ref> {{IPAc-en|-|v|ɛ|l|t}};<ref name="AHD">{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=.}}</ref> January 30, 1882{{spaced ndash}}April 12, 1945), often referred to by his initials '''FDR''', was an American politician who served as the 32nd [[president of the United States]] from 1933 until his death in 1945. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he won a record four [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] and became a central figure in world events during the first half of the 20th century. Roosevelt directed the federal government during most of the [[Great Depression]], implementing his [[New Deal]] domestic agenda in response to the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. As a dominant leader of his party, he built the [[New Deal Coalition]], which defined [[modern liberalism in the United States]] throughout the middle third of the 20th century. His third and fourth terms were dominated by [[World War II]], which ended shortly after he died in office.

Roosevelt was born in [[Hyde Park, New York]], to the [[Roosevelt family]] made well known by the reputation of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the 26th president of the United States, as well as by the reputation of prominent businessman [[William Henry Aspinwall]]. FDR graduated from [[Groton School]] and [[Harvard College]], and attended [[Columbia Law School]] but left after passing the bar exam to practice law in New York City. In 1905, he married his fifth cousin once removed, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. They had six children, of whom five survived into adulthood. He won election to the [[New York State Senate]] in 1910, and then served as [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] under President [[Presidency of Woodrow Wilson|Woodrow Wilson]] during [[World War I]]. Roosevelt was [[James M. Cox]]'s running mate on the Democratic Party's [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]] national ticket, but Cox was defeated by Republican [[Warren G. Harding]]. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|paralytic illness]], believed at the time to be [[polio]], and his legs became permanently paralyzed. While attempting to recover from his condition, Roosevelt founded a [[Warm Springs Historic District|rehabilitation center]] in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]], for people with [[poliomyelitis]]. In spite of being unable to walk unaided, Roosevelt returned to public office by winning election as [[Governor of New York]] in 1928. He served as governor from 1929 to 1933, promoting programs to combat the economic crisis besetting the United States.

In the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 presidential election]], Roosevelt defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Herbert Hoover]] in a landslide. Roosevelt took office in the midst of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. During the [[First 100 days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency|first 100 days]] of the [[73rd United States Congress]], Roosevelt spearheaded unprecedented federal legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deal&nbsp;— a variety of programs designed to produce relief, recovery, and reform. He created numerous programs to provide relief to the unemployed and farmers while seeking economic recovery with the [[National Recovery Administration]] and other programs. He also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, and labor, and presided over the end of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. He used radio to speak directly to the American people, giving 30 "[[fireside chat]]" radio addresses during his presidency and becoming the first American president to be televised. With the economy having improved rapidly from 1933 to 1936, Roosevelt won a landslide [[1936 United States presidential election|reelection in 1936]]. After the 1936 election, Roosevelt sought passage of the [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937]] (the "court packing plan"), which would have expanded the size of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The bipartisan [[Conservative Coalition]] that formed in 1937 prevented passage of the bill and blocked the implementation of further New Deal programs and reforms.  The economy then relapsed into a deep recession in 1937 and 1938. Major surviving programs and legislation implemented under Roosevelt include the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935|National Labor Relations Act]], the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], and the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]].

The United States reelected FDR in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]] for his third term, making him the only U.S. president to serve for more than two terms. With World War II looming after 1938, the U.S. remained officially neutral, but Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]], the [[United Kingdom]] and eventually the [[Soviet Union]]. Following the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, an event he famously called "[[Infamy Speech|a date which will live in infamy]]", Roosevelt obtained a congressional declaration of war on Japan, and, a few days later, on [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Assisted by his top aide [[Harry Hopkins]] and with very strong national support, he worked closely with British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] and Chinese [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in leading the [[Allied Powers (World War II)|Allied Powers]] against the [[Axis Powers]]. Roosevelt supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the war effort, and implemented a [[Europe first]] strategy, making the defeat of Germany a priority over that of Japan. He also initiated the development of the world's first [[Nuclear bomb|atomic bomb]], and worked with other Allied leaders to lay the groundwork for the [[United Nations]] and other post-war institutions. Roosevelt won reelection in [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]], but with his physical health declining during the war years, he died in April 1945, less than three months into his fourth term. The Axis Powers surrendered to the Allies in the months following Roosevelt's death, during the presidency of his successor, [[Harry S. Truman]]. Roosevelt is usually rated by scholars [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|among the nation's greatest presidents]], with [[George Washington]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]], but has also been subject to [[Criticism of Franklin D. Roosevelt|substantial criticism]].

Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, in the [[Hudson Valley]] town of [[Hyde Park, New York]], to businessman [[James Roosevelt I]] and his second wife, [[Sara Ann Delano]]. Roosevelt's parents, who were sixth cousins,{{Sfn|Burns|1956|p=7}} both came from wealthy old New York families, the [[Roosevelt family|Roosevelts]], the [[William Henry Aspinwall|Aspinwalls]] and the [[Delano family|Delanos]], respectively. Roosevelt's patrilineal ancestor migrated to [[New Amsterdam]] in the 17th century, and the Roosevelts flourished as merchants and landowners.{{Sfn|Dallek|2017|p=18}} The Delano family progenitor, [[Philip Delano]], traveled to the [[New World]] on the ''[[Fortune (Plymouth Colony ship)|Fortune]]'' in 1621, and the Delanos prospered as merchants and shipbuilders in [[Massachusetts]].{{Sfn|Dallek|2017|p=19}} Franklin had a half-brother, [[James Roosevelt Roosevelt|James "Rosy" Roosevelt]], from his father's previous marriage.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=5–6}}

Roosevelt grew up in a wealthy family. His father James graduated from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1851, but chose not to practice law after receiving an inheritance from his grandfather, [[James Roosevelt (1760–1847)|James Roosevelt]].{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=5–6}} Roosevelt's father was a prominent [[Bourbon Democrat]] who once took Franklin to meet President [[Grover Cleveland]] in the [[White House]].{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=71}} His mother Sara was the dominant influence in Franklin's early years.{{Sfn|Lash|1971|p=111}} She once declared, "My son Franklin is a Delano, not a Roosevelt at all."{{Sfn|Burns|1956|p=7}} James, who was 54 when Franklin was born, was considered by some as a remote father, though biographer [[James MacGregor Burns]] indicates James interacted with his son more than was typical at the time.{{Sfn|Burns|1956|p=4}}

Roosevelt learned to ride, shoot, row, and to play polo and lawn tennis. He took up golf in his teen years, becoming a skilled long hitter.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=110}} He learned to sail early, and when he was 16, his father gave him a sailboat.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=21}}

===Education and early career===
Frequent trips to Europe&nbsp;— he made his first excursion at the age of two and went with his parents every year from the ages of seven to fifteen&nbsp;— helped Roosevelt become [[List of Presidents of the United States by languages spoken|conversant]] in German and French. Except for attending public school in [[Germany]] at age nine,{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=20-25}}{{Sfn|Gunther|1950|p=169}} Roosevelt was home-schooled by tutors until age 14.<ref>"Traitor to his Class: The Privileged Life and Radical Presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt", by [[H.W. Brands]], 2008</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2019}} He then attended [[Groton School]], an Episcopal boarding school in [[Groton, Massachusetts]], joining the third form.<ref name="Brands, 2008">Brands, 2008</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2019}} Its headmaster, [[Endicott Peabody (educator)|Endicott Peabody]], preached the duty of Christians to help the less fortunate and urged his students to enter public service. Peabody remained a strong influence throughout Roosevelt's life, officiating at his wedding and visiting him as president.{{Sfn|Burns|1956|p=16}}{{Sfn|Gunther|1950|p=174}}

Like most of his Groton classmates, Roosevelt went to [[Harvard College]].{{Sfn|Gunther|1950|p=172}} Roosevelt was an average student academically,{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=30}} and he later declared, "I took economics courses in college for four years, and everything I was taught was wrong."{{Sfn | Burns|1956|pp=18, 20}} He was a member of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] fraternity<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0130.html|title=Family of Wealth Gave Advantages|date=April 15, 1945|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 20, 2012}}</ref> and the [[Fly Club]],{{Sfn|Gunther|1950|p=176}} and served as a school cheerleader.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Staff writer |title=Almanac: The 1st cheerleader |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/almanac-the-1st-cheerleader/ |access-date=December 1, 2019 |work=CBS News |date=November 2, 2014}}</ref> Roosevelt was relatively undistinguished as a student or athlete, but he became editor-in-chief of ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' daily newspaper, a position that required great ambition, energy, and the ability to manage others.{{Sfn|Gunther|1950|p=175}}

Roosevelt's father died in 1900, causing great distress for him.{{Sfn|Dallek|2017|pp=28–29}} The following year, Roosevelt's fifth cousin [[Theodore Roosevelt]] became President of the United States. Theodore's vigorous leadership style and reforming zeal made him Franklin's role model and hero.{{sfn|Burns|1956|p=24}} Roosevelt graduated from Harvard in 1903 with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in history. He entered [[Columbia Law School]] in 1904, but dropped out in 1907 after passing the [[New York State Bar Association|New York bar]] exam.{{Sfn|Burns|1956|p=28}}{{Efn|In 2008, Columbia awarded Roosevelt a posthumous [[Juris Doctor]] degree.<ref name="posthumousjd">{{cite news|title=Presidents Roosevelt Honored With Posthumous Columbia Degrees|url=https://www.nysun.com/new-york/presidents-roosevelt-honored-with-posthumous/86666/|access-date=April 6, 2018|newspaper=New York Sun|date=September 26, 2008}}</ref>}} In 1908, he took a job with the prestigious [[law firm]] of [[Carter Ledyard & Milburn]], working in the firm's [[admiralty law]] division.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|pp= 38–39}}

===Marriage, family, and affairs===

In mid-1902, Franklin began courting his future wife [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], with whom he had been acquainted as a child.{{Sfn|Rowley|2010|pp=3–6}} Eleanor and Franklin were fifth cousins, once removed, and Eleanor was a niece of Theodore Roosevelt.{{Sfn|Rowley|2010|p=3}} They began corresponding with each other in 1902, and in October 1903,<ref name="Brands, 2008"/>{{page needed|date=July 2019}} Franklin proposed marriage to Eleanor.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=37, 46–47}}

On March 17, 1905, Roosevelt married Eleanor, despite the fierce resistance of his mother.{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 26}} While she did not dislike Eleanor, Sara Roosevelt was very possessive of her son, believing he was too young for marriage. She attempted to break the engagement several times.{{Sfn | Gunther | 1950 | pp = 181–83}} Eleanor's uncle, President Theodore Roosevelt, stood in at the wedding for Eleanor's deceased father, [[Elliott B. Roosevelt|Elliott]].{{Sfn|Dallek|2017|pp=35–36}} The young couple moved into [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|Springwood]], his family's estate at Hyde Park. The home was owned by Sara Roosevelt until her death in 1941 and was very much her home as well.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | p = 160}} In addition, Franklin and Sara Roosevelt did the planning and furnishing of a townhouse Sara had built for the young couple in New York City; Sara had a twin house built alongside for herself. Eleanor never felt at home in the houses at Hyde Park or New York, but she loved the family's vacation home on [[Campobello Island]], which Sara gave to the couple.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=54–55}}

[[File:Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt with Anna and baby James, formal portrait in Hyde Park, New York 1908.jpg|thumb|Eleanor and Franklin with their first two children, 1908]]
Biographer James MacGregor Burns said that young Roosevelt was self-assured and at ease in the upper-class.{{Sfn|Burns|1956|pp=77–79}} In contrast, Eleanor at the time was shy and disliked social life, and at first, stayed at home to raise their several children. As his father had, Franklin left the raising of the children to his wife, while Eleanor in turn largely relied on hired caregivers to raise the children. Referring to her early experience as a mother, she later stated that she knew "absolutely nothing about handling or feeding a baby."{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=57–58}} Although Eleanor had an aversion to [[sexual intercourse]] and considered it "an ordeal to be endured",{{Sfn | Winkler|2006|pp=19–20}} she and Franklin had six children. [[Anna Roosevelt Halsted|Anna]], [[James Roosevelt|James]], and [[Elliott Roosevelt|Elliott]] were born in 1906, 1907, and 1910, respectively. The couple's second son, Franklin, died in infancy in 1909. Another son, also named [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr.|Franklin]], was born in 1914, and the youngest child, [[John Aspinwall Roosevelt|John]], was born in 1916.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abate|first=Frank R.|title=The Oxford Desk Dictionary of People and Places|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195138726/page/329|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513872-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195138726/page/329 329]}}</ref>

Roosevelt had several extra-marital affairs, including one with Eleanor's social secretary [[Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd|Lucy Mercer]], which began soon after she was hired in early 1914.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=153}} In September 1918, Eleanor found letters revealing the affair in Roosevelt's luggage. Franklin contemplated divorcing Eleanor, but Sara objected strongly and Lucy would not agree to marry a divorced man with five children.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=160}} Franklin and Eleanor remained married, and Roosevelt promised never to see Lucy again. Eleanor never truly forgave him, and their marriage from that point on was more of a political partnership.{{Sfn | Winkler|2006|pp=28, 38, 48–49}} Eleanor soon thereafter established a separate home in Hyde Park at [[Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site|Val-Kill]], and increasingly devoted herself to various social and political causes independently of her husband. The emotional break in their marriage was so severe that when Roosevelt asked Eleanor in 1942&nbsp;— in light of his failing health&nbsp;— to come back home and live with him again, she refused.{{Sfn|Winkler|2006|pp=202–03}} He was not always aware of when she visited the White House and for some time she could not easily reach him on the telephone without his secretary's help; Roosevelt, in turn, did not visit Eleanor's New York City apartment until late 1944.{{Sfn | Gunther|1950|p=195}}

Franklin broke his promise to Eleanor to refrain from having affairs. He and Lucy maintained a formal correspondence, and began seeing each other again in 1941, or perhaps earlier.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/weekinreview/20mcgrath.html|work=The New York Times|title=No End of the Affair|first=Charles|last=McGrath|date=April 20, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/glossary/mercer-lucy.htm |title=Lucy Page Mercer Rutherfurd |publisher=Eleanor Roosevelt Papers |access-date=February 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304022555/http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/glossary/mercer-lucy.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2010 }}</ref> Lucy was with Roosevelt on the day he died in 1945. Despite this, Roosevelt's affair was not widely known until the 1960s.{{Sfn|Winkler|2006|pp=202–03}} Roosevelt's son Elliott claimed that his father had a 20-year affair with his private secretary, [[Marguerite LeHand|Marguerite "Missy" LeHand]].{{sfn|Tully|2005|p=340}} Another son, James, stated that "there is a real possibility that a romantic relationship existed" between his father and [[Princess Märtha of Sweden|Crown Princess Märtha of Norway]], who resided in the White House during part of World War II. Aides began to refer to her at the time as "the president's girlfriend",{{sfn|Goodwin|1995|p=153}} and gossip linking the two romantically appeared in the newspapers.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=254}}

==Early political career (1910–1920)==

===New York state senator (1910–1913)===

[[File:Theodore Roosevelt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] was Franklin Roosevelt's distant cousin and an important influence on his career.]]

Roosevelt held little passion for the practice of law and confided to friends that he planned to eventually enter politics.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=58–60}} Despite his admiration for his cousin Theodore, Franklin inherited his father's affiliation with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].{{Sfn|Dallek|2017|p=41}} Prior to the [[1910 New York state election|1910 elections]], the local Democratic Party recruited Roosevelt to run for a seat in the [[New York State Assembly]]. Roosevelt was an attractive recruit for the party because Theodore was still one of the country's most prominent politicians, and a Democratic Roosevelt was good publicity; the candidate could also pay for his own campaign.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=60–62}} Roosevelt's campaign for the state assembly ended after the Democratic incumbent, [[Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler]], chose to seek re-election. Rather than putting his political hopes on hold, Roosevelt ran for a seat in the state senate.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=60–64}} The senate district, located in [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]], [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]], and [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]], was strongly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=65}} Roosevelt feared that open opposition from Theodore could effectively end his campaign, but Theodore privately encouraged his cousin's candidacy despite their differences in partisan affiliation.{{Sfn|Dallek|2017|p=41}} Acting as his own campaign manager, Roosevelt traveled throughout the senate district via [[automobile]] at a time when many could not afford cars.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=65–66}} Due to his aggressive and effective campaign,{{Sfn | Gunther | 1950 | pp = 202–03}} the Roosevelt name's influence in the Hudson Valley, and the Democratic landslide [[United States elections, 1910|that year]], Roosevelt won the election, surprising almost everyone.{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 34}}

Though legislative sessions rarely lasted more than ten weeks, Roosevelt treated his new position as a full-time career.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=68–69}} Taking his seat on January 1, 1911, Roosevelt immediately became the leader of a group of "Insurgents" who opposed the [[bossism]] of the [[Tammany Hall]] [[Political machine|machine]] that dominated the state Democratic Party. In the [[1911 United States Senate election in New York|1911 U.S. Senate election]], which was determined in a joint session of the New York state legislature,{{Efn | State legislatures elected United States Senators prior to the ratification of the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]] in 1913.}} Roosevelt and nineteen other Democrats caused a prolonged deadlock by opposing a series of Tammany-backed candidates. Finally, Tammany threw its backing behind [[James A. O'Gorman]], a highly regarded judge who Roosevelt found acceptable, and O'Gorman won the election in late March.{{Sfn|Brands|2009|pp=57–60}} Roosevelt soon became a popular figure among New York Democrats, though he had not yet become an eloquent speaker.{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 34}} News articles and cartoons began depicting "the second coming of a Roosevelt" that sent "cold shivers down the spine of Tammany".{{Sfn | Gunther | 1950 | pp = 205–206}}

Roosevelt, again in opposition to Tammany Hall, supported New Jersey Governor [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s successful bid for the [[1912 Democratic National Convention|1912 Democratic nomination]], earning an informal designation as an original Wilson man.{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 49}} The election became a three-way contest, as Theodore Roosevelt left the Republican Party to launch a [[third party (United States)|third party]] campaign against Wilson and sitting Republican President [[William Howard Taft]]. Franklin's decision to back Wilson over Theodore Roosevelt in the [[1912 United States presidential election|general election]] alienated some members of his family, although Theodore himself was not offended.{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=62–63}} Wilson's victory over the divided Republican Party made him the first Democrat to win a presidential election since 1892. Overcoming a bout with [[typhoid fever]], and with extensive assistance from journalist [[Louis McHenry Howe]], Roosevelt was re-elected in the [[1912 New York state election|1912 elections]]. After the election, he served for a short time as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, and his success with farm and labor bills was a precursor to his New Deal policies twenty years later.{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | pp = 44–46}} By this time he had become more consistently [[Progressive Era|progressive]], in support of labor and social welfare programs for women and children; cousin Theodore was of some influence on these issues.{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 43}}

===Assistant Secretary of the Navy (1913–1919)===
[[File:Franklin Roosevelt Secretary of the Navy 1913.jpg|thumb|Roosevelt as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, 1913]]

Roosevelt's support of Wilson led to his appointment in March 1913 as [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]], the second-ranking official in the Navy Department after Secretary [[Josephus Daniels]].{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=97–101}} Roosevelt had a lifelong affection for the [[United States Navy|Navy]]&nbsp;— he had already collected almost 10,000 naval books and claimed to have read all but one&nbsp;— and was more ardent than Daniels in supporting a large and efficient naval force.{{Sfn|Burns|1956|p=51}}{{Sfn | Gunther|1950|p=209}} With Wilson's support, Daniels and Roosevelt instituted a merit-based promotion system and made other reforms to extend civilian control over the autonomous departments of the Navy.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=102–106}} Roosevelt oversaw the Navy's civilian employees and earned the respect of union leaders for his fairness in resolving disputes.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=113–114}} Not a single strike occurred during his seven-plus years in the office,{{Sfn|Burns|1956|p=52}} during which Roosevelt gained experience in labor issues, government management during wartime, naval issues, and logistics, all valuable areas for future office.{{Sfn|Gunther|1950|p=212}}

In 1914, Roosevelt made an ill-conceived decision to run for the seat of retiring Republican Senator [[Elihu Root]] of New York. Though Roosevelt won the backing of Treasury Secretary [[William Gibbs McAdoo]] and Governor [[Martin H. Glynn]], he faced a formidable opponent in the Tammany-backed [[James W. Gerard]].{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=122–123}} He also lacked Wilson's backing, as Wilson needed Tammany's forces to help marshal his legislation and secure his 1916 re-election.{{Sfn | Burns|1956|p=56}} Roosevelt was soundly defeated in the Democratic primary by Gerard, who in turn lost the general election to Republican [[James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr.]] Roosevelt learned a valuable lesson, that federal patronage alone, without White House support, could not defeat a strong local organization.{{Sfn|Burns|1956|pp=57, 60}} After the election, Roosevelt and the boss of the Tammany Hall machine, [[Charles Francis Murphy]], sought an accommodation with one another and became political allies.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=125}}

Following his defeat in the Senate primary, Roosevelt refocused on the Navy Department.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=125–126}} [[World War I]] broke out in July 1914, with the [[Central Powers]] of [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]] seeking to defeat the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. Though he remained publicly supportive of Wilson, Roosevelt sympathized with the [[Preparedness Movement]], whose leaders strongly favored the Allied Powers and called for a military build-up.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|pp=59–61}} The Wilson administration initiated an expansion of the Navy after the [[sinking of the RMS Lusitania]] by a German [[submarine]], and Roosevelt helped establish the [[United States Navy Reserve]] and the [[Council of National Defense]].{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=130–132}} In April 1917, after Germany declared it would engage in [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] and attacked several U.S. ships, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war. Congress approved the [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declaration of war on Germany]] on April 6.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|pp=62–63}}

Roosevelt requested that he be allowed to serve as a naval officer, but Wilson insisted that he continue to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. For the next year, Roosevelt remained in Washington to coordinate the mobilization, supply, and deployment of naval vessels and personnel.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|pp=65–66}} In the first six months after the U.S. entered the war, the Navy expanded fourfold.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 139–140}} In the summer of 1918, Roosevelt traveled to Europe to inspect naval installations and meet with French and British officials. In September, he returned to the United States on board the [[SS Leviathan|USS ''Leviathan'']], a large troop carrier. On the 11-day voyage, the [[1918 flu pandemic|pandemic influenza]] virus struck and killed many on board.

===Campaign for Vice President (1920)===
[[File:Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Cox in Dayton, Ohio - NARA - 197236.jpg|thumb|left|Cox and Roosevelt in Ohio, 1920]]

Roosevelt's plan to convince Hoover to run for the Democratic nomination fell through after Hoover publicly declared himself to be a Republican, but Roosevelt nonetheless decided to seek the 1920 [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] nomination. After Governor [[James M. Cox]] of Ohio won the party's presidential nomination at the [[1920 Democratic National Convention]], he chose Roosevelt as his running mate, and the party formally nominated Roosevelt by [[acclamation]].{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 177–181}} Although his nomination surprised most people, Roosevelt [[balanced the ticket]] as a moderate, a Wilsonian, and a [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibitionist]] with a famous name.{{Sfn | Burns | 1956 | p = 73}}{{Sfn | Gunther | 1950 | pp = 215–16}} Roosevelt had just turned 38, four years younger than Theodore had been when he received the same nomination from his party. Roosevelt resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Navy after the Democratic convention and campaigned across the nation for the Cox–Roosevelt ticket.{{sfn |Smith|2007|p= 181}}

[[File:ElectoralCollege1920.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|1920 electoral vote results]]

During the campaign, Cox and Roosevelt defended the Wilson administration and the [[League of Nations]], both of which were unpopular in 1920.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 181–182}} Roosevelt personally supported U.S. membership in the League of Nations, but, unlike Wilson, he favored compromising with Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] and other "Reservationists."{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 175–176}} The Cox–Roosevelt ticket was defeated by Republicans [[Warren G.

The 1920 election also saw the first public participation of Eleanor Roosevelt who, with the support of [[Louis Howe]], established herself as a valuable political ally.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 182–183}}

==Paralytic illness and political comeback (1921–1928)==
{{Further|Paralytic illness of Franklin D. Roosevelt}}

After the election, Roosevelt returned to New York City, where he practiced law and served as a vice president of the [[Fidelity and Deposit Company]].{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 184–185}} He also sought to build support for a political comeback in the [[United States elections, 1922|1922 elections]], but his career was derailed by illness.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 184–185}} While the Roosevelts were vacationing at Campobello Island in August 1921, he fell ill. His main symptoms were fever; symmetric, ascending paralysis; facial paralysis; bowel and bladder dysfunction; numbness and hyperesthesia; and a descending pattern of recovery. Roosevelt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. He was diagnosed with [[poliomyelitis]] at the time, but his symptoms are more consistent with [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] – an autoimmune neuropathy which Roosevelt's doctors failed to consider as a diagnostic possibility.{{sfn|Goldman|Goldman|2017|pp=108–147}}

Though his mother favored his retirement from public life, Roosevelt, his wife, and Roosevelt's close friend and adviser, Louis Howe, were all determined that Roosevelt continue his political career.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 195–196}} Roosevelt convinced many people that he was improving, which he believed to be essential prior to running for public office again.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=125}} He laboriously taught himself to walk short distances while wearing iron braces on his hips and legs by swiveling his torso, supporting himself with a cane.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=120}} Roosevelt was careful never to be seen using his wheelchair in public, and great care was taken to prevent any portrayal in the press that would highlight his disability.{{sfn|Ward|Burns|2014|p=332}} However, his disability was well known before and during his presidency and became a major part of his image. He usually appeared in public standing upright, supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons.{{sfn |Smith|2007|p= 220}}

Beginning in 1925, Roosevelt spent most of his time in the Southern United States, at first on his houseboat, the ''Larooco''.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 213–214}} Intrigued by the potential benefits of [[hydrotherapy]], he established [[Warm Springs Historic District|a rehabilitation center]] at [[Warm Springs, Georgia]], in 1926. To create the rehabilitation center, Roosevelt assembled a staff of physical therapists and used most of his inheritance to purchase the Merriweather Inn. In 1938, Roosevelt founded the [[National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis]], leading to the development of polio vaccines.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 215–219}}

Roosevelt maintained contacts with the Democratic Party during the 1920s, and he remained active in New York politics while also establishing contacts in the South, particularly in Georgia.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp=255–256}} Roosevelt issued an open letter endorsing [[Al Smith]]'s successful campaign in New York's 1922 gubernatorial election, which both aided Smith and showed Roosevelt's continuing relevance as a political figure.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|pp=87–88}} Roosevelt and Smith came from different backgrounds and never fully trusted one another, but Roosevelt supported Smith's progressive policies, while Smith was happy to have the backing of the prominent and well-respected Roosevelt.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|pp=87–96}} Roosevelt gave presidential nominating speeches for Smith at the 1924 and 1928 Democratic National Conventions; the speech at the 1924 convention marked a return to public life following his illness and convalescence.{{Sfn |Morgan |1985 |pp=267, 269–72, 286–87}} The Democrats were badly divided between an urban wing, led by Smith, and a conservative, rural wing, led by [[William Gibbs McAdoo]], and the party suffered a landslide defeat in the [[1924 United States presidential election|1924 presidential election]]. Like many others throughout the United States, Roosevelt did not abstain from alcohol during the Prohibition era, but publicly he sought to find a compromise on Prohibition acceptable to both wings of the party.{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=160–167}}

In 1925, Smith appointed Roosevelt to the [[Taconic State Park]] Commission, and his fellow commissioners chose him as chairman.{{sfn|Caro|1974|pages=289–291}} In this role, he came into conflict with [[Robert Moses]], a Smith protégé,{{sfn|Caro|1974|pages=289–291}} who was the primary force behind the [[Long Island State Park Commission]] and the New York State Council of Parks.{{sfn|Caro|1974|pages=289–291}} Roosevelt accused Moses of using the name recognition of prominent individuals including Roosevelt to win political support for state parks, but then diverting funds to the ones Moses favored on Long Island, while Moses worked to block the appointment of Howe to a salaried position as the Taconic commission's secretary.{{sfn|Caro|1974|pages=289–291}} Roosevelt served on the commission until the end of 1928,{{sfn|F.

As the Democratic Party presidential nominee in the [[1928 United States presidential election|1928 election]], Smith, in turn, asked Roosevelt to run for governor in the [[1928 New York state election|state election]].{{Sfn |Burns |1956 |p=100}} Roosevelt initially resisted the entreaties of Smith and others within the party, as he was reluctant to leave Warm Springs and feared a Republican landslide in 1928.{{sfn |Dallek|2017|pp= 96–98}} He agreed to run when party leaders convinced him that only he could defeat the Republican gubernatorial nominee, New York Attorney General [[Albert Ottinger]].{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 223–225}} Roosevelt won the party's gubernatorial nomination by acclamation, and he once again turned to Louis Howe to lead his campaign.

When Roosevelt began his run for a second term in May 1930, he reiterated his doctrine from the campaign two years before: "that progressive government by its very terms must be a living and growing thing, that the battle for it is never-ending and that if we let up for one single moment or one single year, not merely do we stand still but we fall back in the march of civilization."{{Sfn |Burns |1956 |pp=119–20}} He ran on a platform that called for aid to farmers, [[full employment]], unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 243–244}} His Republican opponent could not overcome the public's criticism of the Republican Party during the economic downturn, and Roosevelt was elected to a second term by a 14% margin.{{Sfn |Burns |1956 |p=121}} With the Hoover administration resisting proposals to directly address the economic crisis, Governor Roosevelt proposed an economic relief package and the establishment of the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration to distribute those funds.

As the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 presidential election]] approached, Roosevelt increasingly turned his attention to national politics. He established a campaign team led by Howe and Farley and a "[[brain trust]]" of policy advisers.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 261–263}} With the economy ailing, many Democrats hoped that the 1932 elections would result in the election of the first Democratic president since Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt's re-election as governor had established him as the front-runner for the 1932 Democratic presidential nomination. Roosevelt rallied the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] supporters of the Wilson administration while also appealing to many conservatives, establishing himself as the leading candidate in the [[Southern United States|South]] and West. The chief opposition to Roosevelt's candidacy came from Northeastern conservatives such as Al Smith, the 1928 Democratic presidential nominee. Smith hoped to deny Roosevelt the two-thirds support necessary to win the party's presidential nomination at the [[1932 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago, and then emerge as the nominee after multiple rounds of balloting. Roosevelt entered the convention with a delegate lead due to his success in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1932|1932 Democratic primaries]], but most delegates entered the convention unbound to any particular candidate. On the first presidential ballot of the convention, Roosevelt received the votes of more than half but less than two-thirds of the delegates, with Smith finishing in a distant second place. Speaker of the House [[John Nance Garner]], who controlled the votes of Texas and California, threw his support behind Roosevelt after the third ballot, and Roosevelt clinched the nomination on the fourth ballot. With little input from Roosevelt, Garner won the vice-presidential nomination. Roosevelt flew in from New York after learning that he had won the nomination, becoming the first major-party presidential nominee to accept the nomination in person.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 232–236, 246–251}}

[[File:ElectoralCollege1932.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|1932 electoral vote results]]

In his acceptance speech, Roosevelt declared, "I pledge you, I pledge myself to a [[New Deal|new deal]] for the American people... This is more than a political campaign. It is a call to arms."{{Sfn |Burns |1956 |p = 139}} Roosevelt promised securities regulation, [[tariffs in United States history|tariff]] reduction, farm relief, government-funded public works, and other government actions to address the Great Depression.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 276–277}} Reflecting changing public opinion, the Democratic platform included a call for the repeal of Prohibition; Roosevelt himself had not taken a public stand on the issue prior to the convention but promised to uphold the party platform.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=266–267}} After the convention, Roosevelt won endorsements from several progressive Republicans, including [[George W.

Roosevelt won 57% of the popular vote and carried all but six states. Historians and political scientists consider the 1932–36 elections to be a [[political realignment]]. Roosevelt's victory was enabled by the creation of the [[New Deal coalition]], small farmers, the Southern whites, Catholics, big city political machines, labor unions, northern African Americans (southern ones were still disfranchised), Jews, intellectuals, and political liberals.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg|1963|pp=183–96}} The creation of the New Deal coalition transformed American politics and started what political scientists call the "New Deal Party System" or the [[Fifth Party System]].{{sfn|Sternsher|1975|pp=127–49}} Between the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and 1929, Democrats had [[Party divisions of United States Congresses|rarely controlled both houses of Congress]] and had won just four of seventeen presidential elections; from 1932 to 1979, Democrats won eight of twelve presidential elections and generally controlled both houses of Congress.{{sfn|Campbell|2006|pp=127–49}}

Roosevelt was elected in November 1932 but, like his predecessors, did not take office until the following March. After the election, President Hoover sought to convince Roosevelt to renounce much of his campaign platform and to endorse the Hoover administration's policies.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 290–291}} Roosevelt refused Hoover's request to develop a joint program to stop the downward economic spiral, claiming that it would tie his hands and that Hoover had all the power to act if necessary.{{Sfn |Burns |1956 |p = 146}} The economy spiraled downward until the banking system began a complete nationwide shutdown as Hoover's term ended.{{Sfn |Burns |1956 |p = 148}} Roosevelt used the transition period to select the personnel for his incoming administration, and he chose Howe as his chief of staff, Farley as Postmaster General, and Frances Perkins as Secretary of Labor. [[William H. Woodin]], a Republican industrialist close to Roosevelt, was the choice for Secretary of the Treasury, while Roosevelt chose Senator [[Cordell Hull]] of Tennessee as Secretary of State.

Roosevelt appointed powerful men to top positions but made all the major decisions, regardless of delays, inefficiency or resentment. Analyzing the president's administrative style, historian [[James MacGregor Burns]] concludes:
{{quote|text=The president stayed in charge of his administration...by drawing fully on his formal and informal powers as Chief Executive; by raising goals, creating momentum, inspiring a personal loyalty, getting the best out of people...by deliberately fostering among his aides a sense of competition and a clash of wills that led to disarray, heartbreak, and anger but also set off pulses of executive energy and sparks of creativity...by handing out one job to several men and several jobs to one man, thus strengthening his own position as a court of appeals, as a depository of information, and as a tool of co-ordination; by ignoring or bypassing collective decision-making agencies, such as the Cabinet...and always by persuading, flattering, juggling, improvising, reshuffling, harmonizing, conciliating, manipulating.{{sfn|Burns|1970|pages=347–48}} }}

===First and second terms (1933–1941)===
{{listen|pos=right|filename=FDR speech.ogg|title=Nothing to Fear |description=Sample of the ''Inaugural speech'' from FDR|format=[[ogg]]}}

When Roosevelt was [[First inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt|inaugurated]] on March 4, 1933, the U.S. was at the nadir of the [[List of recessions in the United States|worst depression in its history]]. A quarter of the workforce was unemployed. Farmers were in deep trouble as prices had fallen by 60%. Industrial production had fallen by more than half since 1929. Two million people were homeless. By the evening of March 4, 32 of the 48 states&nbsp;– as well as the District of Columbia&nbsp;– had closed their banks.{{sfn|Alter|2006|p=190}}

Historians categorized Roosevelt's program as "relief, recovery, and reform." Relief was urgently needed by tens of millions of unemployed. Recovery meant boosting the economy back to normal. Reform meant long-term fixes of what was wrong, especially with the financial and banking systems. Through Roosevelt's series of radio talks, known as [[fireside chats]], he presented his proposals directly to the American public.{{Sfn |Burns |1956 |pp=157, 167–68}} Energized by his personal victory over his paralytic illness, Roosevelt relied on his persistent optimism and activism to renew the national spirit.{{sfn|Tobin|2013|pp=4–7}}

====First New Deal (1933–1934)====

On his second day in office, Roosevelt declared a four-day national "bank holiday" and called for a special session of Congress to start March 9, on which date Congress passed the [[Emergency Banking Act]].<ref>Ranjit S.

Roosevelt presided over the establishment of several agencies and measures designed to provide relief for the unemployed and others in need. The [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] (FERA), under the leadership of Harry Hopkins, was designed to distribute relief to state governments.{{sfn |Smith|2007|p= 322}} The [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA), under the leadership of Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, was created to oversee the construction of large-scale public works such as dams, bridges, and schools.{{sfn |Smith|2007|p= 322}} The most popular of all New Deal agencies&nbsp;– and Roosevelt's favorite&nbsp;– was the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), which hired 250,000 unemployed young men to work on local rural projects. Roosevelt also expanded a Hoover agency, the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]], making it a major source of financing for railroads and industry. Congress gave the [[Federal Trade Commission]] broad new regulatory powers and provided mortgage relief to millions of farmers and homeowners. Roosevelt also made agricultural relief a high priority and set up the [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]] (AAA). The AAA tried to force higher prices for commodities by paying farmers to leave land uncultivated and to cut herds.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=318–323}}

Reform of the economy was the goal of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) of 1933. It sought to end cutthroat competition by forcing industries to establish rules of operation for all firms within specific industries, such as minimum prices, agreements not to compete, and production restrictions. Industry leaders negotiated the rules which were approved by NIRA officials. Industry needed to raise wages as a condition for approval. Provisions encouraged unions and suspended [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] laws. NIRA was found to be unconstitutional by unanimous decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in May 1935; Roosevelt strongly protested the decision.{{Sfn|Hawley|1995|p=124}} Roosevelt reformed the financial regulatory structure of the nation with the [[1933 Banking Act|Glass–Steagall Act]], creating the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) to underwrite savings deposits. The act also sought to curb speculation by limiting affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=331–332}} In 1934, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] was created to regulate the trading of [[Security (finance)|securities]], while the [[Federal Communications Commission]] was established to [[Telecommunications policy of the United States|regulate telecommunications]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=346}}

Recovery was pursued through federal spending.{{sfn|Savage|1991|p=160}} The NIRA included $3.3&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|3.3|1933|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}) of spending through the Public Works Administration. Roosevelt worked with Senator Norris to create the largest government-owned industrial enterprise in American history&nbsp;— the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA)&nbsp;— which built dams and power stations, controlled floods, and modernized agriculture and home conditions in the poverty-stricken Tennessee Valley. [[Executive Order 6102]] declared that all privately held gold of American citizens was to be sold to the U.S. Treasury and the price raised from $20 to $35 per ounce. The goal was to counter the [[deflation]] which was paralyzing the economy.{{Sfn|Freidel|1952–1973|pp=4, 320–39}}

Roosevelt tried to keep his campaign promise by cutting the federal budget&nbsp;— including a reduction in military spending from $752&nbsp;million in 1932 to $531&nbsp;million in 1934 and a 40% cut in spending on veterans benefits&nbsp;— by removing 500,000 veterans and widows from the pension rolls and reducing benefits for the remainder, as well as cutting the salaries of federal employees and reducing spending on research and education. But the veterans were well organized and strongly protested, and most benefits were restored or increased by 1934.{{Sfn|Freidel|1952–1973|pp=4, 448–52}} Veterans groups such as the [[American Legion]] and the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] won their campaign to transform their benefits from payments due in 1945 to immediate cash when Congress overrode the President's veto and passed the [[Adjusted Compensation Payment Act|Bonus Act]] in January 1936.{{Sfn|Dallek|2017|p=249}} It pumped sums equal to 2% of the GDP into the consumer economy and had a major stimulus effect.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Joshua K. |last=Hausman |title=Fiscal Policy and Economic Recovery: The Case of the 1936 Veterans' Bonus |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=1100–1143 |date=April 2016 |doi=10.1257/aer.20130957 |url=http://behl.berkeley.edu/files/2013/02/WP2013-06_Hausman.pdf |access-date=October 22, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031231820/http://behl.berkeley.edu/files/2013/02/WP2013-06_Hausman.pdf |archive-date=October 31, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Second New Deal (1935–1936)====
[[File:Signing Of The Social Security Act.jpg|thumb|left|Roosevelt signs the Social Security Act into law, August 14, 1935]]

Roosevelt expected that his party would lose several races in the [[United States elections, 1934|1934 Congressional elections]], as the president's party had done in most previous [[United States midterm election|midterm elections]], but the Democrats picked up seats in both houses of Congress. Empowered by the public's apparent vote of confidence in his administration, the first item on Roosevelt's agenda in the [[74th United States Congress|74th Congress]] was the creation of a [[social insurance]] program.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 349–351}} The [[Social Security Act]] established Social Security and promised economic security for the elderly, the poor and the sick. Roosevelt insisted that it should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund, saying, "We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program."<ref>[http://www.ssa.gov/history/Gulick.html Social Security History]. Ssa.gov. Retrieved on July 14, 2013.</ref> Compared with the social security systems in western European countries, the Social Security Act of 1935 was rather conservative. But for the first time, the federal government took responsibility for the economic security of the aged, the temporarily unemployed, dependent children, and the handicapped.{{sfn |Norton|2009|p= 670}} Against Roosevelt's original intention for universal coverage, the act only applied to roughly sixty percent of the labor force, as farmers, domestic workers, and other groups were excluded.{{sfn |Smith|2007|p= 353}}

Roosevelt consolidated the various relief organizations, though some, like the PWA, continued to exist. After winning Congressional authorization for further funding of relief efforts, Roosevelt established the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). Under the leadership of Harry Hopkins, the WPA employed over three million people in its first year of existence. The WPA undertook numerous construction projects and provided funding to the [[National Youth Administration]] and arts organizations.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 353–356}}

[[File:1936 FDR "Don't Be Fooled by Figures" Re-election handbill.jpg|thumb|1936 re-election handbill for Roosevelt promoting his economic policy]]

Senator Robert Wagner wrote the [[National Labor Relations Act]], which guaranteed workers the right to [[collective bargaining]] through unions of their own choice. The act also established the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) to facilitate wage agreements and to suppress the repeated labor disturbances. The Wagner Act did not compel employers to reach an agreement with their employees, but it opened possibilities for American labor.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|p=291}} The result was a tremendous growth of membership in the labor unions, especially in the mass-production sector.<ref>Colin Gordon, ''New Deals: Business, Labor, and Politics in America, 1920–1935'' (1994) p. 225</ref> When the [[Flint sit-down strike]] threatened the production of [[General Motors]], Roosevelt broke with the precedent set by many former presidents and refused to intervene; the strike ultimately led to the unionization of both General Motors and its rivals in the American automobile industry.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 463–467}}

While the First New Deal of 1933 had broad support from most sectors, the Second New Deal challenged the business community. Conservative Democrats, led by [[Al Smith]], fought back with the [[American Liberty League]], savagely attacking Roosevelt and equating him with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]].{{Sfn|Fried|2001|pp = 120–123}} But Smith overplayed his hand, and his boisterous rhetoric let Roosevelt isolate his opponents and identify them with the wealthy vested interests that opposed the New Deal, strengthening Roosevelt for the 1936 landslide.{{Sfn | Fried | 2001 | pp = 120–123}} By contrast, labor unions, energized by the Wagner Act, signed up millions of new members and became a major backer of Roosevelt's reelections in 1936, 1940 and 1944.{{Sfn|Burns|1956|p=350}}

Biographer James M. Burns suggests that Roosevelt's policy decisions were guided more by pragmatism than ideology and that he "was like the general of a guerrilla army whose columns, fighting blindly in the mountains through dense ravines and thickets, suddenly converge, half by plan and half by coincidence, and debouch into the plain below."{{Sfn|Burns|1956|p=226}} Roosevelt argued that such apparently haphazard methodology was necessary. "The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation," he wrote. "It is common sense to take a method and try it; if it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something."<ref>{{cite book |last=Roosevelt |first=Franklin Delano |title=Looking forward |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wJwnAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA141 |year=1933 |publisher=John Day |page=141}}</ref>

====Landslide re-election, 1936====
{{Main|1936 United States presidential election}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1936.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|1936 electoral vote results]]

Though eight million workers remained unemployed in 1936, economic conditions had improved since 1932 and Roosevelt was widely popular. An attempt by Louisiana Senator [[Huey Long]] and other individuals to organize a left-wing alternative to the Democratic Party collapsed after Long's assassination in 1935.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=360–361}} Roosevelt won re-nomination with little opposition at the [[1936 Democratic National Convention]], while his allies overcame Southern resistance to permanently abolish the long-established rule that had required Democratic presidential candidates to win the votes of two-thirds of the delegates rather than a simple majority.{{Efn|Biographer [[Jean Edward Smith]] notes that "the significance of the repeal of the two-thirds rule...is difficult to overstate. Not only did the power of the South in the Democratic party diminish, but without the repeal, it is open to question whether FDR could have been renominated in 1940."{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=366}}}} The Republicans nominated [[Kansas]] Governor [[Alf Landon]], a well-respected but bland candidate whose chances were damaged by the public re-emergence of the still-unpopular Herbert Hoover.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=364–366}} While Roosevelt campaigned on his New Deal programs and continued to attack Hoover, Landon sought to win voters who approved of the goals of the New Deal but disagreed with its implementation.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=371–372}}

In the election against Landon and a third-party candidate, Roosevelt won 60.8% of the vote and carried every state except [[Maine]] and [[Vermont]].{{sfn|Burns|1956|p=284}} The Democratic ticket won the highest proportion of the [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|popular vote]].{{Efn|The [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] Democratic ticket of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]] would later set a new record, taking 61.1% of the popular vote}} Democrats also expanded their majorities in Congress, winning control of over three-quarters of the seats in each house. The election also saw the consolidation of the New Deal coalition; while the Democrats lost some of their traditional allies in big business, they were replaced by groups such as organized labor and African Americans, the latter of whom voted Democratic for the first time since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=373–375}} Roosevelt lost high income voters, especially businessmen and professionals, but made major gains among the poor and minorities. He won 86 percent of the Jewish vote, 81 percent of Catholics, 80 percent of union members, 76 percent of Southerners, 76 percent of blacks in northern cities, and 75 percent of people on relief. Roosevelt carried 102 of the country's 106 cities with a population of 100,000 or more.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mary E.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] became Roosevelt's primary domestic focus during his second term after the court overturned many of his programs, including NIRA. The more conservative members of the court upheld the principles of the [[Lochner era]], which saw numerous economic regulations struck down on the basis of [[freedom of contract]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kalman|first1=Laura|title=The Constitution, the Supreme Court, and the New Deal|journal=The American Historical Review|date=October 2005|volume=110|issue=4|pages=1052–1080|doi=10.1086/ahr.110.4.1052}}</ref> Roosevelt proposed the [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937]], which would have allowed him to appoint an additional Justice for each incumbent Justice over the age of 70; in 1937, there were six Supreme Court Justices over the age of 70. The [[Supreme Court of the United States#Size of the Court|size of the Court]] had been set at nine since the passage of the [[Judiciary Act of 1869]], and Congress had altered the number of Justices six other times throughout U.S. history.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 379–382}} Roosevelt's "[[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|court packing]]" plan ran into intense political opposition from his own party, led by Vice President Garner, since it upset the separation of powers.{{sfn|Burns|1956|p=312}} A bipartisan coalition of liberals and conservatives of both parties opposed the bill, and Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] broke with precedent by publicly advocating defeat of the bill. Any chance of passing the bill ended with the death of Senate Majority Leader [[Joseph Taylor Robinson]] in July 1937.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 384–389}}

Starting with the 1937 case of ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]'', the court began to take a more favorable view of economic regulations. That same year, Roosevelt appointed a Supreme Court Justice for the first time, and by 1941, seven of the nine Justices had been appointed by Roosevelt.{{Efn |The two Justices who Roosevelt did not originally appoint to the Court were [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] and [[Owen Roberts]].

With Roosevelt's influence on the wane following the failure of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, conservative Democrats joined with Republicans to block the implementation of further New Deal programs.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 390–391}} Roosevelt did manage to pass some legislation, including the [[Housing Act of 1937]], a second Agricultural Adjustment Act, and the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA) of 1938, which was the last major piece of New Deal legislation. The FLSA outlawed [[Child labor laws in the United States|child labor]], established a federal [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]], and required [[overtime]] pay for certain employees who work in excess of [[Eight-hour day|forty-hours per week]].{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 408–409}} He also won passage of the [[Reorganization Act of 1939]] and subsequently created the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|Executive Office of the President]], making it "the nerve center of the federal administrative system."{{sfn |Leuchtenburg|2015|pp= 187–188}} When the economy began to deteriorate again in late 1937, Roosevelt asked Congress for $5&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|5|1937|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}) in relief and public works funding. This managed to eventually create as many as 3.3&nbsp;million WPA jobs by 1938. Projects accomplished under the WPA ranged from new federal courthouses and post offices to facilities and infrastructure for national parks, bridges and other infrastructure across the country, and architectural surveys and archaeological excavations&nbsp;— investments to construct facilities and preserve important resources. Beyond this, however, Roosevelt recommended to a special congressional session only a permanent national farm act, administrative reorganization, and regional planning measures, all of which were leftovers from a regular session. According to Burns, this attempt illustrated Roosevelt's inability to decide on a basic economic program.{{sfn|Burns|1956|p=320}}

Determined to overcome the opposition of conservative Democrats in Congress, Roosevelt became involved in the 1938 Democratic primaries, actively campaigning for challengers who were more supportive of New Deal reform. Roosevelt failed badly, managing to defeat only one target, a conservative Democrat from New York City.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg|1963|pp=239–43}} In the [[United States elections, 1938|November 1938 elections]], Democrats lost six Senate seats and 71 House seats, with losses concentrated among pro-New Deal Democrats. When Congress reconvened in 1939, Republicans under Senator [[Robert A. Taft|Robert Taft]] formed a [[Conservative coalition]] with Southern Democrats, virtually ending Roosevelt's ability to enact his domestic proposals.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg|1963|pp=262–63, 271–73}} Despite their opposition to Roosevelt's domestic policies, many of these conservative Congressmen would provide crucial support for Roosevelt's foreign policy before and during World War II.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 440–441}}

====Conservation and the environment====

Roosevelt had a lifelong interest in the environment and conservation starting with his youthful interest in forestry on his family estate.

The [[national debt]] as a percentage of the GNP had more than doubled under Hoover from 16% to 40% of the GNP in early 1933.

{{Main|Foreign policy of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration}}
[[File:Vargas e Roosevelt.jpg|thumb|Roosevelt with Brazilian President [[Getúlio Vargas]] and other dignitaries in Brazil, 1936]]

The main foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt's first term was the [[Good Neighbor Policy]], which was a re-evaluation of U.S. policy toward [[Latin America]]. The United States had frequently intervened in Latin America following the promulgation of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] in 1823, and the United States had occupied several Latin American nations in the [[Banana Wars]] that had occurred following the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898. After Roosevelt took office, he [[United States occupation of Haiti|withdrew]] U.S. forces from [[Haiti]] and reached new treaties with [[Cuba]] and [[Panama]], ending their status as U.S. [[protectorate]]s. In December 1933, Roosevelt signed the [[Montevideo Convention]] on the Rights and Duties of States, renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of Latin American countries.{{Sfn|Leuchtenburg|1963|pp=203–10}} Roosevelt also normalized relations with the Soviet Union, which the United States had refused to recognize since the 1920s.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=341–343}} He hoped to renegotiate the Russian debt from World War I and open trade relations, but no progress was made on either issue, and "both nations were soon disillusioned by the accord."{{sfn|Doenecke|Stoler|2005|p=18}}

The rejection of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919–1920 marked the dominance of [[United States non-interventionism|isolationism]] in American foreign policy. Despite Roosevelt's Wilsonian background, he and Secretary of State Cordell Hull acted with great care not to provoke isolationist sentiment. The isolationist movement was bolstered in the early to mid-1930s by Senator [[Gerald Nye]] and others who succeeded in their effort to stop the "merchants of death" in the U.S. from selling arms abroad.{{sfn|Burns|1956|p=254}} This effort took the form of the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]]; the president asked for, but was refused, a provision to give him the discretion to allow the sale of arms to victims of aggression.{{sfn|Burns|1956|p=255}} Focused on domestic policy, Roosevelt largely acquiesced to Congress's non-interventionist policies in the early-to-mid 1930s.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=417–418}} In the interim, [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] under [[Benito Mussolini]] proceeded to [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|overcome]] [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], and the Italians joined [[Nazi Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] in supporting General [[Francisco Franco]] and the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] cause in the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Burns|1956|p=256}} As that conflict drew to a close in early 1939, Roosevelt expressed regret in not aiding the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Spanish Republicans]].{{Sfn|Dallek|1995|p=180}} When [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japan invaded China]] in 1937, isolationism limited Roosevelt's ability to aid China,{{Sfn|Dallek|1995|pp=146–147}} despite atrocities like the [[Nanking Massacre]] and the [[USS Panay incident]].{{sfn|Leuchtenburg|2015|pp=188–90}}

Germany [[Anschluss|annexed]] [[Austria]] in 1938, and soon turned its attention to its eastern neighbors.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=423–424}} Roosevelt made it clear that, in the event of German aggression against [[Czechoslovakia]], the U.S. would remain neutral.{{Sfn|Dallek|1995|pp=166–73}} After completion of the [[Munich Agreement]] and the execution of [[Kristallnacht]], American public opinion turned against Germany, and Roosevelt began preparing for a possible war with Germany.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=425–426}} Relying on an interventionist political coalition of Southern Democrats and business-oriented Republicans, Roosevelt oversaw the expansion U.S. airpower and war production capacity.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=426–429}}

When [[World War II]] began in September 1939 with Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain and France's subsequent declaration of war upon Germany, Roosevelt sought ways to assist Britain and France militarily.{{Sfn|Black|2005|pp=503–06}} Isolationist leaders like [[Charles Lindbergh]] and Senator [[William Borah]] successfully mobilized opposition to Roosevelt's proposed repeal of the [[Neutrality Acts of the 1930s|Neutrality Act]], but Roosevelt won Congressional approval of the sale of arms on a [[Cash and carry (World War II)|cash-and-carry]] basis.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=436–441}} He also began a regular secret correspondence with Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty, [[Winston Churchill]], in September 1939&nbsp;— the first of 1,700 letters and telegrams between them.{{Sfn|Gunther|1950|p=15}} Roosevelt forged a close personal relationship with Churchill, who became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] in May 1940.<ref>{{cite web |title=Roosevelt and Churchill: A Friendship That Saved The World |url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/fdrww2.htm |website=National Park Service}}</ref>

The [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in June 1940 shocked the American public, and isolationist sentiment declined.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg|1963|pp=399–402}} In July 1940, Roosevelt appointed two interventionist Republican leaders, [[Henry L. Stimson]] and [[Frank Knox]], as Secretaries of War and the Navy, respectively. Both parties gave support to his plans for a rapid build-up of the American military, but the isolationists warned that Roosevelt would get the nation into an unnecessary war with Germany.{{sfn|Burns|1956|p=420}} In July 1940, a group of Congressmen introduced a bill that would authorize the nation's first peacetime draft, and with the support of the Roosevelt administration the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]] passed in September. The size of the army would increase from 189,000 men at the end of 1939 to 1.4&nbsp;million men in mid-1941.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=464–466}} In September 1940, Roosevelt openly defied the Neutrality Acts by reaching the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], which, in exchange for military base rights in the British Caribbean Islands, gave 50 WWI American [[destroyer]]s to Britain.{{Sfn|Burns|1956|p=438}}

===Election of 1940: Breaking with tradition===
{{Main|1940 United States presidential election}}

In the months prior to the July [[1940 Democratic National Convention]], there was much speculation as to whether Roosevelt would run for an unprecedented third term. The two-term tradition, although not yet enshrined in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]],{{efn|The [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] ratified in 1951, would bar any individual from winning more than two presidential elections.}} had been established by [[George Washington]] when he refused to run for a third term in the [[1796 United States presidential election|1796 presidential election]]. Roosevelt refused to give a definitive statement as to his willingness to be a candidate again, and he even indicated to some ambitious Democrats, such as James Farley, that he would not run for a third term and that they could seek the Democratic nomination. However, as Germany swept through [[Western Europe]] and menaced Britain in mid-1940, Roosevelt decided that only he had the necessary experience and skills to see the nation safely through the Nazi threat. He was aided by the party's political bosses, who feared that no Democrat except Roosevelt could defeat [[Wendell Willkie]], the popular Republican nominee.{{Sfn|Burns|1956|pp=408–30}}

[[File:ElectoralCollege1940.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|1940 electoral vote results]]

At the [[1940 Democratic National Convention|July 1940 Democratic Convention]] in Chicago, Roosevelt easily swept aside challenges from Farley and Vice President Garner, who had turned against Roosevelt in his second term because of his liberal economic and social policies.<ref name=moe1/> To replace Garner on the ticket, Roosevelt turned to Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace of Iowa, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal and was popular in farm states.{{sfn|Dallek|2017|pp=389–390}} The choice was strenuously opposed by many of the party's conservatives, who felt Wallace was too radical and "eccentric" in his private life to be an effective running mate. But Roosevelt insisted that without Wallace on the ticket he would decline re-nomination, and Wallace won the vice-presidential nomination, defeating Speaker of the House [[William B. Bankhead]] and other candidates.<ref name=moe1>{{cite book|last1=Moe|first1=Richard|title=Roosevelt's Second Act: The Election of 1940 and the Politics of War|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199981915|pages=229–246}}</ref>

A late August poll taken by [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] found the race to be essentially tied, but Roosevelt's popularity surged in September following the announcement of the [[Destroyers-for-bases deal|Destroyers for Bases Agreement]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=472}} Willkie supported much of the New Deal as well as rearmament and aid to Britain, but warned that Roosevelt would drag the country into another European war.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=474–475}} Responding to Willkie's attacks, Roosevelt promised to keep the country out of the war.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=476–477}} Roosevelt won the 1940 election with 55% of the popular vote, 38 of the 48 states, and almost 85% of the electoral vote.{{Sfn|Burns|1956|p=454}}

===Third and fourth terms (1941–1945)===
{{main|Foreign policy of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration}}
The world war dominated FDR's attention, with far more time devoted to world affairs than ever before. Domestic politics and relations with Congress were largely shaped by his efforts to achieve total mobilization of the nation's economic, financial, and institutional resources for the war effort. Even relationships with Latin America and Canada were structured by wartime demands.  Roosevelt maintained close personal control of all major diplomatic and military decisions, working closely with his generals and admirals, the war and Navy departments, the British, and even with the Soviet Union.  His key advisors on diplomacy were [[Harry Hopkins]] (who was based in the White House), [[Sumner Welles]] (based in the State Department), and [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]] at Treasury. In military affairs, FDR worked most closely with Secretary [[Henry L. Stimson]] at the War Department, Army Chief of Staff [[George Marshall]], and Admiral [[William D. Leahy]].<ref>Winston Groom, ''The Allies: Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, and the Unlikely Alliance That Won World War II'' (2018)</ref><ref>Joseph E.

In August 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill conducted a highly secret bilateral meeting in which they drafted the [[Atlantic Charter]], conceptually outlining global wartime and postwar goals. This would be the first of several [[List of World War II conferences|wartime conferences]];{{Sfn|Burns|1970|pp=126–28}} Churchill and Roosevelt would meet ten more times in person.{{Sfn|Gunther|1950|pp=15–16}} Though Churchill pressed for an American declaration of war against Germany, Roosevelt believed that Congress would reject any attempt to bring the United States into the war.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=502}} In September, a German submarine fired on the U.S. destroyer ''Greer,'' and Roosevelt declared that the U.S. Navy would assume an escort role for Allied convoys in the Atlantic as far east as Great Britain and would fire upon German ships or submarines ([[U-boat]]s) of the [[Kriegsmarine]] if they entered the U.S. Navy zone. This "shoot on sight" policy effectively declared naval war on Germany and was favored by Americans by a margin of 2-to-1.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|pp=141–42}}

After the German invasion of Poland, the primary concern of both Roosevelt and his top military staff was on the war in Europe, but Japan also presented foreign policy challenges. Relations with Japan had continually deteriorated since its [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931, and they had further worsened with Roosevelt's support of China.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=506–508}} With the war in Europe occupying the attention of the major colonial powers, Japanese leaders eyed vulnerable colonies such as the [[Dutch East Indies]], [[French Indochina]], and [[British Malaya]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=509–510}} After Roosevelt announced a $100&nbsp;million loan (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.1|1940|r=1}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}) to China in reaction to Japan's occupation of northern French Indochina, Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] with Germany and Italy.

The Japanese were incensed by the embargo and Japanese leaders became determined to attack the United States unless it lifted the embargo. The Roosevelt administration was unwilling to reverse policy, and Secretary of State Hull blocked a potential summit between Roosevelt and Prime Minister [[Fumimaro Konoe]].{{Efn|Hull and others in the administration were unwilling to recognize the Japanese conquest of China, and feared that an American accommodation with Japan would leave the Soviet Union vulnerable to a two-front war.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=522–523}}}} After diplomatic efforts to end the embargo failed, the [[Privy Council of Japan]] authorized a strike against the United States.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=518–530}} The Japanese believed that the destruction of the [[United States Asiatic Fleet]] (stationed in the Philippines) and the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] (stationed at [[Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]]) was vital to the conquest of Southeast Asia.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=531–533}} On the morning of December 7, 1941, the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor|struck the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor with a surprise attack]], knocking out the main American [[battleship]] fleet and killing 2,403 American servicemen and civilians. At the same time, separate Japanese task forces [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|attacked]] [[Thailand]], British [[Hong Kong]], the Philippines, and other targets. Roosevelt called for war in his famous "[[Infamy Speech]]" to Congress, in which he said: "Yesterday, December 7, 1941&nbsp;— a date which will live in infamy&nbsp;— the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan."

In late December 1941 Churchill and Roosevelt met at the [[Arcadia Conference]], which established a joint strategy between the U.S. and Britain.
Both agreed on a [[Europe first]] strategy that prioritized the defeat of Germany before Japan. The U.S. and Britain established the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] to coordinate military policy and the [[Combined Munitions Assignments Board]] to coordinate the allocation of supplies.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=545–547}} An agreement was also reached to establish a centralized command in the Pacific theater called [[ABDA]], named for the American, British, [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]], and [[Australia]]n forces in the theater.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|pp=180–85}} On January 1, 1942, the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, and twenty-two other countries (the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]]) issued the [[Declaration by United Nations]], in which each nation pledged to defeat the Axis powers.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=547}}

In 1942, Roosevelt formed a new body, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], which made the final decisions on American military strategy. Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] as [[Chief of Naval Operations]] commanded the Navy and Marines, while General [[George C. Marshall]] led the Army and was in nominal control of the Air Force, which in practice was commanded by General [[Hap Arnold]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Chambers|first=John Whiteclay|title=The Oxford Companion to American Military History|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00cham/page/351|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press, US|isbn=978-0-19-507198-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00cham/page/351 351]}}</ref> The Joint Chiefs were chaired by Admiral [[William D.

====Nuclear program====
{{see also|History of nuclear weapons|Nuclear weapons of the United States}}

In August 1939, [[Leo Szilard]] and [[Albert Einstein]] sent the [[Einstein–Szilárd letter]] to Roosevelt, warning of the possibility of a German [[German nuclear weapon project|project]] to develop [[nuclear weapon]]s. Szilard realized that the recently discovered process of [[nuclear fission]] could be used to create a [[nuclear chain reaction]] that could be used as a [[weapon of mass destruction]].{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 678–680}} Roosevelt feared the consequences of allowing Germany to have sole possession of the technology and authorized preliminary research into nuclear weapons.{{Efn|The Germans stopped research on nuclear weapons in 1942, choosing to focus on other projects. Japan gave up its own program in 1943.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=580}}}} After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Roosevelt administration secured the funds needed to continue research and selected General [[Leslie Groves]] to oversee the [[Manhattan Project]], which was charged with developing the first nuclear weapons. Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to jointly pursue the project, and Roosevelt helped ensure that American scientists cooperated with their British counterparts.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=578–581}}

Roosevelt coined the term "[[Four Policemen]]" to refer to the "Big Four" Allied powers of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China. The "[[Grand Alliance (World War II)|Big Three]]" of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], together with Chinese Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], cooperated informally on a plan in which American and British troops concentrated in the West; Soviet troops fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]]; and Chinese, British and American troops fought in Asia and the Pacific. The United States also continued to send aid via the Lend-Lease program to the Soviet Union and other countries. The Allies formulated strategy in a series of high-profile conferences as well as by contact through diplomatic and military channels.{{sfn|Doenecke|Stoler|2005|pp=109–110}} Beginning in May 1942, the Soviets urged an Anglo-American invasion of German-occupied France in order to divert troops from the Eastern front.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=557–559}} Concerned that their forces were not yet ready for an invasion of France, Churchill and Roosevelt decided to delay such an invasion until at least 1943 and instead focus on a landing in North Africa, known as [[Operation Torch]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=560–561}}

In November 1943, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met to discuss strategy and post-war plans at the [[Tehran Conference]], where Roosevelt met Stalin for the first time.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=587–588}} At the conference, Britain and the United States committed to opening a second front against Germany in 1944, while Stalin committed to entering the war against Japan at an unspecified date. Subsequent conferences at [[Bretton Woods Conference|Bretton Woods]] and [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference|Dumbarton Oaks]] established the framework for the post-war [[International monetary systems|international monetary system]] and the [[United Nations]], an intergovernmental organization similar to Wilson's failed League of Nations.{{sfn |Leuchtenburg|2015|pp= 214–216}}

Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met for a second time at the February 1945 [[Yalta Conference]] in Crimea. With the end of the war in Europe approaching, Roosevelt's primary focus was on convincing Stalin to enter the war against Japan; the Joint Chiefs had estimated that an [[Operation Downfall|American invasion of Japan]] would cause as many as one million American casualties. In return for the Soviet Union's entrance into the war against Japan, the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as [[Sakhalin Island]]. The three leaders agreed to hold a conference in 1945 to establish the United Nations, and they also agreed on the structure of the [[United Nations Security Council]], which would be charged with ensuring [[International security|international peace and security]]. Roosevelt did not push for the immediate evacuation of Soviet soldiers from Poland, but he won the issuance of the Declaration on Liberated Europe, which promised free elections in countries that had been occupied by Germany. Germany itself would not be dismembered, but would be jointly occupied by the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=623–624}} Against Soviet pressure, Roosevelt and Churchill refused to consent to imposing huge reparations and deindustrialization on Germany after the war.{{sfn |Leuchtenburg|2015|pp= 233–234}} Roosevelt's role in the Yalta Conference has been controversial; critics charge that he naively trusted the Soviet Union to allow free elections in Eastern Europe, while supporters argue that there was little more that Roosevelt could have done for the Eastern European countries given the Soviet occupation and the need for cooperation with the Soviet Union during and after the war.{{sfn|Herring|2008|pp=584–587}}<ref name="ebumiller1">{{cite news|last1=Bumiller|first1=Elizabeth|title=60 Years Later, Debating Yalta All Over Again|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/16/politics/60-years-later-debating-yalta-all-over-again.html|access-date=October 14, 2017|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 16, 2005}}</ref>

The Allies invaded [[French North Africa]] in November 1942, securing the surrender of [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces within days of landing.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=563–564}} At the January 1943 [[Casablanca Conference]], the Allies agreed to defeat Axis forces in North Africa and then launch an invasion of Sicily, with an attack on France to take place in 1944. At the conference, Roosevelt also announced that he would only accept the [[unconditional surrender]] of Germany, Japan, and Italy.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=565–567}} In February 1943, the Soviet Union won a major victory at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], and in May 1943, the Allies secured the surrender of over 250,000 German and Italian soldiers in North Africa, ending the [[North African Campaign]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=573–574}} The Allies launched an [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943, capturing the island by the end of the following month.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=575–576}} In September 1943, the Allies secured an [[Armistice of Cassibile|armistice]] from Italian Prime Minister [[Pietro Badoglio]], but Germany quickly restored Mussolini to power.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=575–576}} The [[Allied invasion of Italy|Allied invasion of mainland Italy]] commenced in September 1943, but the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] continued until 1945 as German and Italian troops resisted the Allied advance.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=581–582}}

To command the invasion of France, Roosevelt chose General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who had successfully commanded a multinational coalition in North Africa and Sicily.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=596–597}} Eisenhower chose to launch [[Operation Overlord]] on June 6, 1944. Supported by 12,000 aircraft and the largest naval force ever assembled, the Allies successfully established a beachhead in [[Normandy]] and then advanced further into France.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=598–599}} Though reluctant to back an unelected government, Roosevelt recognized [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] as the de facto government of France in July 1944. After most of France had been liberated from German occupation, Roosevelt granted formal recognition to de Gaulle's government in October 1944.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=613–617}} Over the following months, the Allies liberated more territory from Nazi occupation and [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|began the invasion of Germany]]. By April 1945, Nazi resistance was crumbling in the face of advances by both the Western Allies and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=630–631}}

In the opening weeks of the war, Japan conquered the Philippines and the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia. The Japanese advance reached its maximum extent by June 1942, when the U.S. Navy scored a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Midway]]. American and Australian forces then began a slow and costly strategy called [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]] or [[leapfrogging]] through the Pacific Islands, with the objective of gaining bases from which strategic airpower could be brought to bear on Japan and from which Japan could ultimately be invaded. In contrast to Hitler, Roosevelt took no direct part in the tactical naval operations, though he approved strategic decisions.{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | p = 228}} Roosevelt gave way in part to insistent demands from the public and Congress that more effort be devoted against Japan, but he always insisted on Germany first. The strength of the Japanese navy was decimated in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], and by April 1945 the Allies had re-captured much of their lost territory in the Pacific.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | p = 785}}

====Home front====
{{Main|United States home front during World War II}}

The home front was subject to dynamic social changes throughout the war, though domestic issues were no longer Roosevelt's most urgent policy concern. The military buildup spurred economic growth. Unemployment fell in half from 7.7&nbsp;million in spring 1940 to 3.4&nbsp;million in fall 1941 and fell in half again to 1.5&nbsp;million in fall 1942, out of a labor force of 54&nbsp;million.{{Efn|WPA workers were counted as unemployed by this set of statistics.<ref>{{Citation|place=US|publisher=Bureau of the Census|title=Statistical Abstract|year=1946|page=173}}</ref>}} There was a growing labor shortage, accelerating the second wave of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans, farmers and rural populations to manufacturing centers. African Americans from the South went to California and other West Coast states for new jobs in the defense industry. To pay for increased government spending, in 1941 Roosevelt proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99.5% on all income over $100,000; when the proposal failed, he issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100% on income over $25,000, which Congress rescinded.{{Sfn|Schweikart|Allen|2004|p=602}} The [[Revenue Act of 1942]] instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the [[excess profits tax]]), greatly increased the tax base, and instituted the first federal [[withholding tax]].{{sfn |Leuchtenburg|2015|pp= 221–222}} In 1944, Roosevelt requested that Congress enact legislation which would tax all "unreasonable" profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support his declared need for over $10&nbsp;billion in revenue for the war and other government measures. Congress overrode Roosevelt's veto to pass a [[Individual Income Tax Act of 1944|smaller revenue bill]] raising $2&nbsp;billion.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|p=436}}

In 1942, with the United States now in the conflict, war production increased dramatically, but fell short of the goals established by the president, due in part to manpower shortages.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|p=333}} The effort was also hindered by numerous strikes, especially among union workers in the coal mining and railroad industries, which lasted well into 1944.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|p=343}}{{sfn|Herman|2012|pp=139–44, 151, 246}} Nonetheless, between 1941 and 1945, the United States produced 2.4&nbsp;million trucks, 300,000 military aircraft, 88,400 tanks, and 40&nbsp;billion rounds of ammunition. The production capacity of the United States dwarfed that of other countries; for example, in 1944, the United States produced more military aircraft than the combined production of Germany, Japan, Britain, and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=571–572}} The White House became the ultimate site for labor mediation, conciliation or arbitration. One particular battle royale occurred between Vice President Wallace, who headed the [[Board of Economic Warfare]], and [[Jesse H. Jones]], in charge of the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]]; both agencies assumed responsibility for acquisition of rubber supplies and came to loggerheads over funding. Roosevelt resolved the dispute by dissolving both agencies.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|pp=339–42}} In 1943, Roosevelt established the [[Office of War Mobilization]] to oversee the home front; the agency was led by [[James F. Byrnes]], who came to be known as the "assistant president" due to his influence.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=575–576}}

[[File:Second Bill of Rights Speech.ogv|thumb|Roosevelt announced the plan for a [[Second Bill of Rights|bill of social and economic rights]] in the [[State of the Union address]] broadcast on January 11, 1944. (excerpt)]]

Roosevelt's 1944 [[State of the Union Address]] advocated that Americans should think of basic economic rights as a [[Second Bill of Rights]].{{sfn |Leuchtenburg|2015|pp= 223–225}} He stated that all Americans should have the right to "adequate medical care", "a good education", "a decent home", and a "useful and remunerative job".<ref name="zeitzsbr"/> In the most ambitious domestic proposal of his third term, Roosevelt proposed the [[G.I. Bill]], which would create a massive benefits program for returning soldiers. Benefits included [[higher education|post-secondary education]], medical care, unemployment insurance, job counseling, and low-cost loans for homes and businesses. The G.I. Bill passed unanimously in both houses of Congress and was signed into law in June 1944. Of the fifteen million Americans who served in World War II, more than half benefitted from the educational opportunities provided for in the G.I. Bill.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=584–585}}

In March 1944, shortly after his 62nd birthday, he underwent testing at [[Bethesda Naval Hospital|Bethesda Hospital]] and was found to have [[high blood pressure]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[coronary artery disease]] causing [[angina pectoris]], and [[congestive heart failure]].{{Sfn|Burns|1970|p=448}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Lerner |first=Barron H. |url=http://hnn.us/articles/40225.html |title=How Much Confidence Should We Have in the Doctor's Account of FDR's Death? |work=History News Network |publisher=George Washington University |date=November 23, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Bruenn |first=Howard G. |title=Clinical notes on the illness & death of President Franklin D.

Hospital physicians and two outside specialists ordered Roosevelt to rest. His personal physician, Admiral Ross McIntire, created a daily schedule that banned business guests for lunch and incorporated two hours of rest each day. During the 1944 re-election campaign, McIntire denied several times that Roosevelt's health was poor; on October 12, for example, he announced that "The President's health is perfectly OK. There are absolutely no organic difficulties at all."{{Sfn|Gunther |1950|pp=372–74}} Roosevelt realized that his declining health could eventually make it impossible for him to continue as president, and in 1945 he told a confidant that he might resign from the presidency following the end of the war.{{sfn|Dallek|2017|pp=618–619}}

====Election of 1944====
{{Main|1944 United States presidential election|1944 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1944.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|1944 electoral vote results]]

While some Democrats had opposed Roosevelt's nomination in 1940, the president faced little difficulty in securing his re-nomination at the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]]. Roosevelt made it clear before the convention that he was seeking another term, and on the lone presidential ballot of the convention, Roosevelt won the vast majority of delegates, although a minority of Southern Democrats voted for [[Harry F. Byrd]]. Party leaders prevailed upon Roosevelt to drop Vice President Wallace from the ticket, believing him to be an electoral liability and a poor potential successor in case of Roosevelt's death. Roosevelt preferred Byrnes as Wallace's replacement but was convinced to support Senator [[Harry S. Truman]] of Missouri, who had earned renown for his investigation of [[Truman Committee|war production inefficiency]] and was acceptable to the various factions of the party. On the second vice presidential ballot of the convention, Truman defeated Wallace to win the nomination.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=617–619}}

The Republicans nominated [[Thomas E. Dewey]], the governor of New York, who had a reputation as a liberal in his party. The opposition accused Roosevelt and his administration of domestic corruption, bureaucratic inefficiency, tolerance of Communism, and military blunders. Labor unions, which had grown rapidly in the war, fully supported Roosevelt. Roosevelt and Truman won the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 election]] by a comfortable margin, defeating Dewey and his running mate [[John W. Bricker]] with 53.4% of the popular vote and 432 out of the 531 electoral votes.{{sfn|Jordan|2011|p=321}} The president campaigned in favor of a strong United Nations, so his victory symbolized support for the nation's future participation in the international community.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|pp=533, 562}}

When Roosevelt returned to the United States from the [[Yalta Conference]], many were shocked to see how old, thin and frail he looked. He spoke while seated in the well of the House, an unprecedented concession to his physical incapacity.{{Sfn | Dallek| 1995 | p = 520}} During March 1945, he sent strongly worded messages to Stalin accusing him of breaking his Yalta commitments over Poland, Germany, [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and other issues. When Stalin accused the western Allies of plotting behind his back a separate peace with Hitler, Roosevelt replied: "I cannot avoid a feeling of bitter resentment towards your informers, whoever they are, for such vile misrepresentations of my actions or those of my trusted subordinates."{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | p = 587}}
On March 29, 1945, Roosevelt went to the [[Little White House]] at Warm Springs, Georgia, to rest before his anticipated appearance at the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|founding conference]] of the [[United Nations]].

In the afternoon of April 12, 1945, in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]], while sitting for [[Unfinished portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt|a portrait]], Roosevelt said "I have a terrific headache."<ref name=dayb>{{cite web|title=Franklin D.

On the morning of April 13, Roosevelt's body was placed in a flag-draped coffin and loaded onto the presidential train for the trip back to Washington. Along the route, thousands flocked to the tracks to pay their respects. After a White House funeral on April 14, Roosevelt was transported by train from Washington, D.C., to his place of birth at Hyde Park. As was his wish, Roosevelt was buried on April 15 in the Rose Garden of his Springwood estate.{{Sfn | Dallek| 2017 | p = 620}}

Roosevelt's declining physical health had been kept secret from the general public. His death was met with shock and grief across the U.S. and around the world.<ref>{{cite video |year=1945 |type=video |title=Allies Overrun Germany |url=https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.39165 |publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]] |access-date=February 21, 2012}}</ref> After Germany surrendered the following month, newly sworn-in President Truman dedicated [[Victory in Europe Day]] and its celebrations to Roosevelt's memory, and kept the flags across the U.S. at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period, saying that his only wish was "that Franklin D.

Roosevelt did not join [[NAACP]] leaders in pushing for federal anti-[[lynching]] legislation, as he believed that such legislation was unlikely to pass and that his support for it would alienate Southern congressmen. He did, however, appoint a "[[Black Cabinet]]" of African American advisers to advise on race relations and African American issues, and he publicly denounced lynching as "murder."{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=162–163}} First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt vocally supported efforts designed to aid the African American community, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, which helped boost wages for nonwhite workers in the South.{{Sfn|Dallek|2017|pp=307–308}} In 1941, Roosevelt established the [[Fair Employment Practices Committee]] (FEPC) to implement [[Executive Order 8802]], which prohibited racial and religious discrimination in employment among defense contractors. The FEPC was the first national program directed against [[employment discrimination]], and it played a major role in opening up new employment opportunities to non-white workers. During World War II, the proportion of African American men employed in manufacturing positions rose significantly.<ref name="collins">{{cite journal |first=William J. |last=Collins |jstor=2677909 |title=Race, Roosevelt, and Wartime Production: Fair Employment in World War II Labor Markets |journal=[[The American Economic Review]] |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=272–286 |date=March 2001 |doi=10.1257/aer.91.1.272}}</ref> In response to Roosevelt's policies, African Americans increasingly defected from the Republican Party during the 1930s and 1940s, becoming an important Democratic [[voting bloc]] in several Northern states.{{sfn |McJimsey|2000|pp=162–163}}

The attack on Pearl Harbor raised concerns in the public regarding the possibility of sabotage by [[Japanese Americans]]. This suspicion was fed by long-standing racism against Japanese immigrants, as well as the findings of the [[Roberts Commissions|Roberts Commission]], which concluded that the attack on Pearl Harbor had been assisted by Japanese spies. On February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt signed [[Executive Order 9066]], which relocated hundreds of thousands of the Japanese-American citizens and immigrants. They were forced to liquidate their properties and businesses and [[Internment of Japanese Americans|interned in hastily built camps]] in interior, harsh locations. Distracted by other issues, Roosevelt had delegated the decision for internment to Secretary of War Stimson, who in turn relied on the judgment of Assistant Secretary of War [[John J. McCloy]]. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the executive order in the 1944 case of ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]''.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 549–553}} Many [[Internment of German Americans|German]] and [[Internment of Italian Americans|Italian]] citizens were also arrested or placed into internment camps.<ref>{{cite web |title=World War II Enemy Alien Control Program Overview |publisher=National Archives |date=September 23, 2016 |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/immigration/enemy-aliens-overview.html}}</ref>

After Kristallnacht in 1938, Roosevelt helped expedite Jewish immigration from Germany and Austria, and allowed German citizens already in the United States to stay indefinitely. However, he was prevented from accepting further Jewish immigrants, practically refugees, by the restrictive [[Immigration Act of 1924]], and [[antisemitism]] among voters.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=426–428}} Hitler chose to implement the "[[Final Solution]]"&nbsp;— the extermination of the European Jewish population&nbsp;— by January 1942, and American officials learned of the scale of the Nazi extermination campaign in the following months. Against the objections of the State Department, Roosevelt convinced the other Allied leaders to jointly issue the [[Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations]], which condemned the ongoing [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and warned to try its perpetrators as [[War crime|war criminals]]. In January 1944, Roosevelt established the [[War Refugee Board]] to aid Jews and other victims of Axis atrocities. Aside from these actions, Roosevelt believed that the best way to help the persecuted populations of Europe was to end the war as quickly as possible. Top military leaders and War Department leaders rejected any campaign to bomb the [[extermination camps]] or the rail lines leading to the camps, fearing it would be a diversion from the war effort. According to biographer Jean Edward Smith, there is no evidence that anyone ever proposed such a campaign to Roosevelt.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=607–613}}

His isolationist critics faded away, and even the Republicans joined in his overall policies.{{sfn |Black|2005|pp= 1126–27}} He also created a new understanding of the presidency, permanently increasing the power of the president at the expense of Congress.{{sfn |Leuchtenburg|2015|pp= 174–175}}

His Second Bill of Rights became, according to historian Joshua Zeitz, "the basis of the Democratic Party's aspirations for the better part of four decades."<ref name="zeitzsbr">{{cite news |last1=Zeitz |first1=Joshua |title=Democrats Aren't Moving Left.

Some junior New Dealers played leading roles in the presidencies of Truman, John Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson. Kennedy came from a Roosevelt-hating family. Historian [[William Leuchtenburg]] says that before 1960,  "Kennedy showed a conspicuous lack of inclination to identify himself as a New Deal liberal." He adds, as president, "Kennedy never wholly embraced the Roosevelt tradition and at times he deliberately severed himself from it."<ref>{{Citation|first=William E.|last=Leuchtenburg|title=In the Shadow of FDR: From Harry Truman to George W.

During his presidency, and continuing to a lesser extent afterwards, there has been much [[Criticism of Franklin D. Roosevelt|criticism of Roosevelt]], some of it intense. Critics have questioned not only [[Critics of the New Deal|his policies, positions]], and the consolidation of power that occurred due to his responses to the crises of the Depression and World War II but also his breaking with tradition by running for a third term as president.{{Sfn|Dallek|2017|pp=624–625}} Long after his death, new lines of attack criticized Roosevelt's policies regarding helping the Jews of Europe,{{Sfn|Wyman|1984}} incarcerating the Japanese on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]],{{Sfn|Robinson|2001}} and opposing anti-lynching legislation.{{Sfn|Dallek|2017|p=626}}
