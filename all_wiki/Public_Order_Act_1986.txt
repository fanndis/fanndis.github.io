'''The Public Order Act 1986''' (c 64) is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It creates a number of [[public order offence]]s. They replace similar [[common law offence]]s and parts of the [[Public Order Act 1936]]. It implements recommendations<ref name=":0">[https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lawcom-prod-storage-11jsxou24uy7q/uploads/2016/07/LC.-123-CRIMINAL-LAW-OFFENCES-RELATING-TO-PUBLIC-ORDER.pdf The] Law Commission. Criminal Law: Offences relating to Public Order (Law Com 123). HMSO. 1983.</ref> of the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]].

== Background ==
Before the introduction of the Public Order Act 1986, policing public order was based on various relevant [[common law offence]]s, and the [[Public Order Act 1936]]. Several factors influenced the introduction of the Public Order Act 1986. Significant public disorder, such as the [[Southall riots|Southall riot]] in 1979, the [[1981 Brixton riot|Brixton riot]] that extended to other cities in 1981, and the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|national miner's strike]] and associated disorder between 1984 and 1985 – in particular the [[Battle of Orgreave]] in June 1984 – and the [[Battle of the Beanfield]] in June 1985. Furthermore, the 1983 [[Law Commission]] report, ''Criminal Law: Offences Relating to Public Order'' recommended updating the law.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05760 |title=Insulting Words or Behaviour: Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, Commons Briefing papers SN05760 |last=Strickland |first=P |last2=Douse |first2=D |date=2013 |publisher=House of Commons Library |access-date=15 May 2018}}</ref>

The Law Commission stated its desire to further to extend the [[codification (law)|codification of the law]] in England and Wales. It advocated the abolition of the common law offences of [[affray]], [[riot]], [[rout]], and [[unlawful assembly]].  It argued the changes it recommended to public order legislation made it more practical to use, and make the law more comprehensible to the courts and juries.<ref name=":0" />

;Section 3 – [[Affray]]

;Section 4 – [[Fear or provocation of violence]]

;Section 4A – [[Intentional harassment, alarm or distress]]: added by section 154 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]

;Section 5 – [[Harassment, alarm or distress]]

This section defines the words "dwelling" and "violence".

====Section 9 – Offences abolished====
Section 9(1) abolished the [[common law offence]]s of [[riot]], [[rout]], [[unlawful assembly]] and [[affray]].

Section 9(2) abolished the offences under:

*section 1 of the [[Shipping Offences Act 1793]]
*section 23 of the [[Seditious Meetings Act 1817]]
*section 5 of the [[Public Order Act 1936]]

===Part 2 – Processions and assemblies===
;Section 11 – Advance notice of public processions: requires at least six clear days' written notice to be given to the police before most public processions, including details of the intended time and route, and giving the name and address of at least one person proposing to organise it; creates offences for the organisers of a procession if they do not give sufficient notice, or if the procession diverges from the notified time or route

;Section 12 – Imposing conditions on public processions: provides police the power to impose conditions on processions "to prevent serious public disorder, serious criminal damage or serious disruption to the life of the community"

;Section 13 – Prohibiting public processions: a chief police officer has the power to ban public processions up to three months by applying to local authority for a banning order which needs subsequent confirmation from the [[Home Secretary]].

;Section 14 – Imposing conditions on public assemblies: provides police the power to impose conditions on assemblies "to prevent serious public disorder, serious criminal damage or serious disruption to the life of the community". The conditions are limited to the specifying of:
:* the number of people who may take part,
:* the location of the assembly, and
:* its maximum duration.

;Section 14A – Prohibiting trespassory assemblies: added by section 70 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]], to control "[[rave]]s"

;Section 16 – Public assembly: Originally meant an assembly of 20 or more persons in a public place which is wholly or partly open to the air. The [[Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003]] amended the act to reduce the minimum numbers of people in an assembly to two, and removed the requirement to be in the open air.

===Parts 3 and 3A – Racial and religious hatred===

To stir up hatred on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]] was to be proscribed by the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] in POA Part 3A section 29AB.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/schedule/16/enacted legislation.gov.uk: Schedule 16 to the CJIA 2008]</ref> This legislation was introduced by [[David Hanson (politician)|David Hanson]] MP.

==Controversies==

===Misuse of section 14===
The police have been accused{{by whom|date=November 2018}} of misusing the powers in section 14 on several occasions.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} During the [[2009 G-20 London summit protests]] journalists were forced to leave the protests by police who threatened them with arrest.<ref name="guardianG20">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/apr/16/policing-g20-journalists|title=Journalists on the G20 front line|last=Vallée|first=Marc|date=2009-04-17|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-05-13}}</ref><ref>[http://www.muslimnews.co.uk/news/news.php?article=16137 UK terror laws being misused to obstruct journalists, MPs told] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716070748/http://www.muslimnews.co.uk/news/news.php?article=16137 |date=16 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policeprofessional.com/news.aspx?id=8685|title=Officers must be better trained on the rights of the press|publisher=Police Professional|date=2009-05-07|accessdate=2018-08-27|archivedate=2013-11-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104213347/http://www.policeprofessional.com/news.aspx?id=8685}}</ref>

===The campaign to reform section 5===
The "Reform Section 5" campaign was established in May 2012 to garner support for an alteration of section 5, and led to an increase in the threshold from "abusive or insulting" to strictly "abusive" for speech restricted by the act. It was reported that under section 5 alone, 51,285 people were convicted between 2001 and 2003, 8,489 of whom were between 10 and 17 years of age.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/tom-kott/freedom-of-speech-canada_b_2324999.html|title=Think Canada allows freedom of speech? Think again|first=Tom|last=Kott|work=The Huffington Post|date=2012-12-19|accessdate=2018-08-27}}</ref>

The campaign was supported by a range of groups and famous individuals. These included the [[National Secular Society]], the [[Christian Institute]], the Bow Group, [[Big Brother Watch]], the [[Peter Tatchell Foundation]] and [[The Freedom Association]]. Actors [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Stephen Fry]] also voiced their support.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9616750/Rowan-Atkinson-we-must-be-allowed-to-insult-each-other.html|title=Rowan Atkinson: We must be allowed to insult each other|work=The Telegraph|date=2012-10-18|accessdate=2018-08-27}}</ref>

In 2013, a [[House of Lords]] amendment to a forthcoming Crime and Court Bill meant the removal of "insulting" from the definition of section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986. A subsequent [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] briefing paper acknowledged the government's acceptance of the amendment and detailed the reasons for its decision.<ref name=":1" />
