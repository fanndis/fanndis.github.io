==Post-playing career==
Gimelstob has been a blogger for ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' (under the name "Gimel Takes All"), and has served as a regular commentator for [[Tennis Channel]].<ref name="njjewishnews1"/><ref name="jweekly1"/><ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/writers/justin_gimelstob/archive/index.html SI.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322223310/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/writers/justin_gimelstob/archive/index.html |date=March 22, 2007 }}</ref>  He has also presented tennis features and interviews for the ''[[TV Guide]]'' channel.<ref name="jweekly1"/> Gimelstob is also one of the three current [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] board representatives elected by the ATP player council.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/atp-player-council-election-2018|title=New ATP Player Council Elected In London {{!}} ATP World Tour {{!}} Tennis|work=ATP World Tour|access-date=2018-12-04|language=en}}</ref>

[[John Isner]] hired Gimelstob as his new coach at the end of the 2014 season and has been working with him since.<ref name="ISNER TO BE COACHED BY GIMELSTOB"/>

==Controversies==

On June 17, 2008, when Gimelstob was a guest on the Washington, DC, morning [[radio show]] "[[The Sports Junkies]]",<ref>{{cite news |last=Steinberg |first=Dan |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/dcsportsbog/2008/06/new_dc_athlete_has_a_kournikov.html |title=New D.C.

Also in 2008, Gimelstob told ''[[Out Magazine]]'': "'The locker room couldn’t be a more homophobic place,' he says. 'We’re not gay-bashing. There’s just a lot of positive normal hetero talk about pretty girls and working out and drinking beer. That’s why people want to be pro athletes!'"<ref>{{cite web|title=Former tennis pro Justin Gimelstob says locker room no place for gays…|url=http://blogs.dailynews.com/outinhollywood/2008/08/01/former-tennis-pro-justin-gimel/|website=DailyNews.com|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref>

In 2010, Gimelstob was suspended from his Tennis Channel commentating duties for comments he made about President [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Gimelstob known to serve up controversy|url=https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2010/08/30/SBJ-In-Depth/Gimelstob-Known-To-Serve-Up-Controversy.aspx|website=Sports Business Daily|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref>

In 2016, Gilmelstob's wife Cary sought a restraining order against him, alleging that he “physically assaulted, harassed, verbally attacked, and stole” from her.<ref>https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/former-tennis-star-justin-gimelstob-arrested-on-suspicion-of-halloween-night-attack/ar-BBPY8bJ</ref>

In November 2018, Gimelstob was charged with assault after being accused of repeatedly striking [[Randall Kaplan]] while the venture capitalist, his wife and their two-year-old daughter were trick-or-treating on Halloween in [[West Los Angeles]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/former-tennis-star-justin-gimelstob-arrested-on-suspicion-of-halloween-night-attack/ar-BBPY8bJ|title=Former tennis star Justin Gimelstob arrested on suspicion of Halloween night attack|last=Winton|first=Richard|date=November 22, 2018|website=MSN|language=en-US|access-date=December 8, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/46300344|title=Justin Gimelstob charged with assault in Los Angeles|date=November 23, 2018|work=BBC Sport|access-date=December 8, 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref> Gimelstob denied the accusations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadspin.com/tennis-channel-broadcaster-atp-board-member-justin-gim-1830832323|title=Tennis Channel Broadcaster, ATP Board Member Justin Gimelstob Denies Multiple Accusations Of Violence|last=Nathan|first=Giri|date=December 3, 2018|website=Deadspin|language=en-US|access-date=December 8, 2018}}</ref> Gilmelstob later changed his plea to "no contest" to a felony battery charge, and was sentenced to three years’ probation and 60 days of community labor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/sports/justin-gimelstob-plea.html|title=Justin Gimelstob Pleads No Contest in Battery Case|first=Cindy|last=Shmerler|date=April 22, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>
Such was the ferocity of the violent, unprovoked attack, the wife of the victim attributed the miscarriage of her unborn child to the stress of witnessing the attack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://au.sports.yahoo.com/tennis-star-contributed-miscarriage-violent-unprovoked-assault-215142516.html|title=Wife reveals miscarriage after tennis star's 'unprovoked' attack on husband|website=au.sports.yahoo.com}}</ref>

On May 1 2019, Gimelstob resigned from the ATP Player Council after pressure from leading players [[Stan Wawrinka]]<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/48113971|title=Gimelstob case shameful - Wawrinka|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> and [[Andy Murray]].<ref name="auto"/> He also resigned from his job at the Tennis Channel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/sports/justin-gimelstob-atp.html|title=Justin Gimelstob's Criminal Case Is Settled.
