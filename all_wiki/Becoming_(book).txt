==Synopsis==
The book's 24 chapters (plus a preface and epilogue) are divided into three sections: Becoming Me, Becoming Us, and Becoming More.

The preface sets the stage for Michelle Obama's story to open by sketching a scene in her post-First Lady life. Becoming Me traces Obama's early life growing up on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] of [[Chicago]] with her parents - Fraser and Marian Robinson - in an upstairs apartment where she got her first piano lessons and learnt to be an independent girl under the nurturing care of her parents. There, Obama shared a bedroom with her brother Craig.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Obama, Michelle|title=Becoming|publisher=Crown, an imprint of the Crown Publishing Group|year=2018|isbn=978-1-5247-6313-8|edition=First|location=New York|oclc=1030413521}}</ref> The book continues through her education at [[Princeton University]] and [[Harvard Law School]], to her early career as a lawyer at the law firm [[Sidley Austin]], where she met [[Barack Obama]]. While this section talks considerably at length about Obama's Princeton experience and Sidley Austin, Harvard Law school's experiences are mentioned marginally by comparison.<ref>{{Citation|last=Obama, Michelle, 1964-|title=Becoming|date=2019|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1088930870|publisher=CNIB|isbn=978-0-221-02673-7|oclc=1088930870|access-date=July 29, 2020}}</ref>

Becoming Us departs from the beginning of the Obamas' romantic relationship and follows their marriage, and the beginning of his political career in the Illinois State Senate. The book shares Obama's balance between her position as the first [[African American]] [[First Lady of the United States of America]], her motherly duties, and marital commitments.<ref name=":0" /> The section ends with election night in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected President of the United States.

Becoming More takes the readers through Barack Obama's presidency, Michelle Obama's focus on her [[Let's Move!|Let's Move]] campaign, and her role of "head mom in chief" to her two daughters - [[Malia ann obama|Malia]] and [[Sasha Obama|Sasha]] Obama, along with the other aspects of the Obama's life as [[First Family|first family]]'''.'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.enotes.com/topics/becoming|title=Becoming Summary - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|language=en|access-date=April 23, 2020}}</ref> The Epilogue talks about the last day of Obamas in the White House which was also Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony and Michelle Obama's reflection on Optimism. She also expresses her lack of desire to ever run for office.<ref name="bbcrecord" />
