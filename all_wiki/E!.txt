'''E!''' (an [[initialism]] for '''Entertainment Television''') is an American [[basic cable]] [[Cable television|channel]] owned by the [[NBCUniversal Television and Streaming]] division of [[NBCUniversal]], a subsidiary of [[Comcast]].

As of January 2016, E! is available to 92.4 million households in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590 |title=Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: January 2016}}</ref>

==History==

===Movietime===
E! was originally launched on July 31, 1987, as '''Movietime''', a service that aired movie trailers, entertainment news, event and awards coverage, and interviews as an early example of a national [[barker channel]].<ref>{{cite news|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DD173CF930A35755C0A966958260&sec=&spon=|work=The New York Times|first= Jeremy|last=Gerard|title=TELEVISION; Fledgling Cable Networks Are Poised for Flight|date=June 3, 1990}}</ref> The channel was founded by [[Larry Namer]] and [[Alan Mruvka]].<ref name="BOOK1">{{cite book|last=Slide|first=Anthony|title=The television industry: a historical dictionary|publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |year=1991 |edition=illustrated|page=94|isbn=9780313256349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4EYAAAAIAAJ&q=alan-mruvka}}</ref><ref name="NYT1">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/30/business/advertising-promoting-movies-via-cable.html|title=Advertising; Promoting Movies Via Cable|last=Dougherty |first=Philip H.|date=July 30, 1987|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 24, 2009}}</ref> Early Movietime hosts included [[Greg Kinnear]], [[Katie Wagner]], [[Julie Moran]], Suzanne Kay (daughter of [[Diahann Carroll]]), [[Mark DeCarlo]], [[Sam Rubin]] and [[Richard Blade]].

===E!===
[[File:E! Logo.svg|thumb|left|75px|E!'s logo from the launch under that branding. Used from June 1, 1990 until July 9, 2012 for the US flagship channel. Still in use for many of E!'s international networks.]]
Controlling ownership was originally held by a [[consortium]] of five cable television providers ([[Comcast]], [[Continental Cablevision]], [[Cox Communications|Cox Cable]], [[Tele-Communications Inc.|TCI]], and [[Time Warner Cable|Warner Cable]]), [[HBO]]/[[Warner Communications]], and various founding shareholders, with HBO directly programming and managing the network. In 1989, after [[Time Inc.]] bought Warner Communications to fend off a takeover bid by Paramount, the new [[Time Warner]] company held four of the eight major ownership positions and took over management control of Movietime and renamed the network as '''E!: Entertainment Television''' on June 1, 1990; this name change was made to emphasize its widening coverage of the [[celebrity–industrial complex]], contemporary film, television and music, daily Hollywood gossip, and fashion.

In 1997, Comcast, one of the minority partners, teamed up with [[Disney–ABC Television Group|Disney/ABC Cable Networks]] to buy the channel after Time Warner had exercised their put agreement.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106155855/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19020738.html Comcast Corp. Gains Exclusive Right to Buy E! Entertainment], Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News (originated from ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''; via [[HighBeam Research]]), January 11, 1997.</ref> Comcast increased the ownership stakes in the network through mergers with forerunners of TCI and Continental under various circumstances. In November 2006, Comcast acquired Disney's 39.5% share of E! for $1.23 billion to gain full ownership of the network as part of a broader programming carriage agreement between Disney/ABC and Comcast.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comcast.com/About/PressRelease/PressReleaseDetail.ashx?PRID=24|title= Comcast and the Walt Disney Company Announce Long-Term Comprehensive Distribution Agreements Securing Carriage for Disney Media Networks' Products and Services|publisher= [[Comcast]]|accessdate= March 19, 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120224182246/https://comcast.com/About/PressRelease/PressReleaseDetail.ashx?PRID=24|archive-date= February 24, 2012|url-status= dead}}</ref>

In January 2011, Comcast Entertainment Group, the company's television unit, became a division of the [[NBCUniversal Television Group]], after Comcast acquired a 51% majority stake in NBCUniversal from [[General Electric]].<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/183652/nbcuniversalcomcast_merger_what_we_do_and_dont_know.html NBC-Universal-Comcast Merger: What We Do and Don't Know], ''[[PC World (magazine)|PCWorld]]'', December 3, 2009.</ref> E!'s only sister networks prior to the NBC Universal merger were the now-defunct channels Style Network (then [[Esquire Network]]) and [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]], along with Comcast's sports networks: Versus, [[Comcast SportsNet]] and [[Golf Channel]]. In the case of Versus, E! staff produced that network's ''[[Sports Soup]]'' and G4's ''[[Web Soup]]'', while the Orlando-based Golf Channel featured no crossovers with E! at all due to incompatible audiences and operations. Versus and Golf Channel were taken under the direct control of the [[NBC Sports]] division, with the former being renamed [[NBC Sports Network]] in January 2012, and are no longer connected to their former sister networks beyond advertising and in-house operations.

On July 9, 2012, the channel introduced a revised logo. (the first change to its logo since the network rebranded as E! in 1990), removing the [[exclamation mark]] background behind the "E" but keeping the exclamation point underneath, along with a new slogan "Pop of Culture", which coincided with the launch of the new series ''[[Opening Act]]''. The network also started the process of introducing scripted programming (the first series, ''[[The Royals (TV series)|The Royals]]'', premiering in March 2015), in addition to its existing reality and documentary series. The changes were announced during E!'s programming upfront presentation on April 30, 2012.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/e-new-logo-pop-of-culture-tagline-318032 E! Unveils New Logo, 'Pop of Culture' Tagline], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', April 30, 2012.</ref>

==Programming==
{{main|List of programs broadcast by E!}}

===News===
{{see also|E! News}}
E! is one of the few U.S. general-entertainment cable channels that broadcasts a daily news program; its flagship entertainment news program is ''[[E! News]]'', which debuted on September 1, 1991. The weekday program (which also has an hour-long weekend edition) features stories and gossip about celebrities, and the film, music and television industries, and has been broadcast under various formats since its launch, even being aired live for a time during the mid-2000s. It was first hosted by Dagny Hultgreen. Steve Kmetko was a host from 1994 to 2002.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} It has been hosted by [[Terrence Jenkins]] and [[Giuliana Rancic]] since 2012 and 2006, respectively, with [[Ryan Seacrest]] (who co-anchored the program from 2006 to 2012) serving as [[managing editor]] of the news operation.

''E! News'' was the only entertainment news show on the channel for much of its history until 2006, when the channel launched ''[[The Daily 10]]'', hosted by [[Sal Masekela]] and [[Catt Sadler]] ([[Debbie Matenopoulos]] also co-hosted from the show's inception until 2008); the series was cancelled in September 2010 after E! announced that the weekday editions of ''E! News'' would be expanded to one hour starting on October 25, 2010.<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/457412-E_Expands_Weeknight_Newscast_To_One_Hour.php E! Expands Weeknight Newscast To One Hour] 2011 NewBay Media September 21, 2010</ref>

E! also carried a [[simulcast]] of business news channel [[Bloomberg Television]] from 2004 to January 2009, when the latter network had expanded its cable and satellite carriage to a level that allowed the discontinuation of the simulcast.

Outside ''E! News'' telecasts, the channel runs an ''E! News''–branded [[news ticker]] displaying entertainment news headlines each half-hour during regular programming; fast-breaking entertainment headlines (such as a celebrity arrest or death) may also be displayed on a ticker, during any program when warranted.

On August 5, 2020, E! canceled both New York-based shows, along with ''In The Room'', one of the first of many program and employee cuts and staff realignments announced across [[NBCUniversal]] that week.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|url=https://deadline.com/2020/08/e-news-pop-of-the-morning-in-the-room-canceled-e-financial-1203005259/|title='E!

News'' website, and its social media presences.

===Original series===
E! is known for its live red carpet pre-shows for the industry's three prominent award shows, the [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, the [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and the [[Academy Awards]], and were famous for their fashion critiques by [[Joan Rivers]]; Rivers also hosted post-awards specials under the title ''[[Fashion Police]]'', which became a regular weekly series in September 2010. In April 2017, it was announced that E! had acquired the [[People's Choice Awards]], which will move to the network from [[CBS]] in 2018 with a new November scheduling. The network promoted that the show would be given an "end-to-end" experience that will leverage its existing experience in awards show coverage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/12/peoples-choice-awards-premiere-date-e-den-of-thieves-jesse-ignjatovic-evan-prager-1202226809/|title=People's Choice Awards Sets Premiere Date For Inaugural Telecast On E!|last=Ramos|first=Dino-Ray|date=December 14, 2017|work=Deadline|access-date=December 14, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/04/peoples-choice-awards-cbs-e-1202063827/|title=People's Choice Awards Moves From CBS To E!|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=April 6, 2017|work=Deadline|access-date=December 14, 2017}}</ref>

The network also produces many documentary and biographical series, most notably ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]''; many of E!'s original specials are entertainment-related ranging from light fare (such as ''25 Cutest Child Stars All Grown Up'') to serious fare (such as ''15 Most Unforgettable Hollywood Tragedies''). It also produces specials centering on investigative and crime stories including ''E! Investigates'', which features topical investigative reports on subjects ranging from [[child prostitution]] to [[teenage pregnancy]].

In recent years, the network has become known for its [[reality television]] programs. Its most popular series for over a decade has been ''[[Keeping Up with the Kardashians]]'', which  spawned eight [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off series]] and countless specials. Other original reality programming airing on the network currently includes ''[[Total Divas]]'', a series featuring the [[WWE]]'s [[Bella Twins]], ''Hollywood Medium with [[Tyler Henry]]'', the [[plastic surgery]] repair series ''[[Botched (TV series)|Botched]]'', ''[[Very Cavallari]]'' with [[Kristin Cavallari]] and her husband [[Jay Cutler]], and ''Ladygang'', a television version of the popular [[podcast]].

E! has had five comedy programs: the late night talk show ''[[Chelsea Lately]]'', hosted by comedian [[Chelsea Handler]], its scripted/improvised spin-off ''[[After Lately]]'', and ''[[The Soup]]'' (based on the popular 1991-2002 E! series ''[[Talk Soup]]''), featuring clips of the previous week's TV shows with humorous commentary delivered by the host, actor/comedian [[Joel McHale]]. Handler also produced ''[[Love You, Mean It with Whitney Cummings|Love You, Mean It]]'', a weekly comedic look at pop culture hosted by [[Whitney Cummings]], and a nightly talk show from actress [[Busy Philipps]], ''[[Busy Tonight]]''. ''The Soup'' returned in February 2020, with new host Jade Catta-Preta.

On September 8, 2020 it was announced the networks most popular series ''[[Keeping Up with the Kardashians]]'' would be ending with season 20 in 2021.

===Acquired series and films===
Over the years, E! has occasionally run acquired programming including reruns of ''[[Alice (American TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'', ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' lifestyle-based interview shows from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (since removed under NBCUniversal ownership), and edited 60-minute versions of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', though fewer of these programs currently air.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url= http://www.marketingmag.ca/news/media-news/out-with-the-e-in-with-the-new-at-canwest-upfront-8989|title=Out with the E!, in with the new at Canwest upfront|work=[[Marketing (magazine)|Marketing Magazine]]|date=June 3, 2009|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> The only programming currently airing on E! that it does not produce are [[standards and practices|broadcast standards-edited]] reruns of the former [[HBO]] series ''[[Sex and the City]]'' originally carried by HBO's sister network [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], and [[feature film]]s that air under the banner "Movies We Love"; the latter was part of a since-abandoned initiative by the network to use films to increase the network's ratings, though the branding remains, and low and mid-grossing female-focused films from the [[Universal Pictures]] library usually receive their basic cable premiere on E!, with higher-grossing films premiering on [[USA Network]]. The network has aired same-week runs of NBC series (such as ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]'', ''[[Fashion Star]]'', ''[[Whitney (TV series)|Whitney]]'', and ''[[Are You There, Chelsea?]]''), and in the past aired previews of G4 programming to give that network an extended promotional platform due to their lowered carriage when it was removed from [[DirecTV]] in November 2010.<ref name="auto"/>

==E! HD==
'''E! HD''' is a [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed of E! launched on December 8, 2008 in Comcast's default [[1080i]] resolution format. Currently, the network's entire original programming roster post-2010 is carried in high definition, along with most films. Available on the vast majority of pay television providers, it is downscaled at the provider [[Cable television headend|headend]] level to provide a [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] equivalent for those systems.<ref name="auto"/>

During E!'s run as a broadcast service in Canada, the ''E! Ontario'' version of the service until the December 2008 discontinuation of the E! broadcast television system was available in HD over [[Hamilton, Ontario]]-based [[CHCH-TV]] (channel 11) on its channel 18 [[ATSC standards|ATSC]] digital signal, though the majority of E!'s programming outside American primetime series before the shutdown of the [[television system]] was not available in the format.<ref name="auto"/>

==''E! Online''==
''E! Online'' is the online arm of E!, featuring live updates on entertainment news stories; the website includes an online-only entertainment news bulletin titled ''E! News Now'', which is updated each weekday. The website also provides live streaming video of major red carpet events including movie premieres and award shows such as the Academy Awards and the Emmys, along with some blogs involving shows such as ''The Soup''. Columnists featured on the website include [[Kristin dos Santos]] (the "Watch with Kristin" television blog), [[Ted Casablanca]] ("The Awful Truth" gossip blog), and Marc Malkin (writer of an eponymous gossip blog and host of a daily video blog on the site).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

As part of the rebrand of the cable channel on July 9, 2012, EOnline.com was redesigned for [[HTML5]], including tablet and mobile devices.<ref>[http://www.lostremote.com/2012/05/01/e-emphasizes-social-presence-and-tablet-friendliness-at-upfront/ E! emphasizes social presence and tablet friendliness at upfront], ''The Lost Remote'', May 1, 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504054452/http://www.lostremote.com/2012/05/01/e-emphasizes-social-presence-and-tablet-friendliness-at-upfront/ |date=May 4, 2012 }}</ref>

{{main|E! (Australia)}}

===Canada===
Unlike most international cable channels that have licensed an American cable channel's branding and programming, E! has existed as two separate television channels in Canada – in both broadcast and pay television forms.<ref name="auto"/>

On September 7, 2007, [[Canwest|Canwest Global Communications]] rebranded its CH television system as [[E! (Canadian TV system)|E!]] CH originally launched on February 12, 2001 by [[CHCH-DT|CHCH]]/[[Hamilton, Ontario]] as a secondary service of the [[Global Television Network]]; the CH/E! system would later include four additional Canwest-owned stations in [[Quebec]] ([[CJNT-DT|CJNT]]/[[Montreal]]), [[British Columbia]] ([[CHEK-DT|CHEK]]/[[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and [[CHBC-TV|CHBC]]/[[Kelowna]]) and [[Alberta]] ([[CHCA-TV|CHCA]]/[[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]]), and three affiliates owned by [[Jim Pattison Group]] in British Columbia ([[CKPG-TV|CKPG]]/[[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] and [[CFJC-TV|CFJC]]/[[Kamloops, British Columbia|Kamloops]]) and Alberta ([[CHAT-TV|CHAT]]/[[Medicine Hat, Alberta|Medicine Hat]]). The E! television system shut down on September 1, 2009 due to low ratings and corporate financial difficulties that eventually led to Canwest filing for [[bankruptcy protection]] and selling its properties to [[Shaw Media]] for US$6.7 million; the E! [[owned-and-operated station]]s experienced varied fates (CHCH and CJNT were sold to [[Channel Zero (company)|Channel Zero]], CHEK was sold to an employee-led group; CHBC remained with Canwest and was converted into a Global O&O, and CHCA ceased operations outright), while the Pattison Group stations affiliated with the [[Rogers Media]]-owned [[Citytv]] system.<ref name="auto"/> As E!, local news and other regional programming, as well as most local community sponsorships on the O&O stations, used local branding (incorporating the callsign branding scheme common with Canadian stations not owned by a network or television system).<ref name="auto"/> This decision was at least partly made to avoid confusion with ''E! News'', but likely intended to ensure that local newscasts were not perceived as celebrity-oriented.<ref name="auto"/>

The E! brand would later return to Canada on November 1, 2010, when [[CTVglobemedia]] (whose assets are now owned by [[Bell Media]]) signed a multi-year/multi-platform agreement with Comcast to rebrand [[Category A services|Category 2]] [[specialty channel]] Star! (which had a similar format to E! U.S. and had carried some of its programming prior to the 2007 rebranding of CH) into a [[E! (Canadian TV channel)|Canadian version of E!]] on November 29, 2010.

===Asia===
{{main|E! (Asian TV channel)}}
E!'s Asian network aired across [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Philippines]] from 15 December 1997 until 31 December 2019.

==== Philippines ====
Some of E! programs started to air on Cinema Television during its inception by [[Radio Mindanao Network|RMN]] (thru [[DWKC-TV|UHF Channel 31]]; now acquired by [[Broadcast Enterprises and Affiliated Media|BEAM]]).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gaviola |first1=Gilbert |title=A good showing, a strong following, a bright future |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LpUVAAAAIBAJ&pg=6592%2C5297183 |accessdate=January 7, 2019 |publisher=[[Manila Standard]] |date=October 31, 1994}}</ref> But in 2000, both RMN and E! announced its partnership to relaunch CTV into E! Philippines.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vanzi|first=Sol Jose|title=RMN Joint Venture for E!

Some of E!'s programs were brought to the Philippines and remade in a local version, one of which was ''Wild On! Philippines''.

Three years after the relaunch as a standalone cable channel,<ref>[http://www.pep.ph/photos/2403/the-launch-of-e-entertainment-television-in-the-philippines The launch of E!
