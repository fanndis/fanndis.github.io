==Early life==
Born in [[New Plymouth]] on 7 May 1965,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/MPP/MPs/MPs/3/7/6/50MP175491-Little-Andrew.htm | title=Andrew Little | publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]] | date=6 March 2013 | accessdate=15 February 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306085725/http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/MPP/MPs/MPs/3/7/6/50MP175491-Little-Andrew.htm | archivedate=6 March 2013}}</ref> Little was educated at [[New Plymouth Boys' High School]]. His father was a devout [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] supporter and Little recalls delivering National pamphlets under his father's direction when he was younger.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Audrey Young: Little smashed it – literally|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&objectid=11542022|work= The New Zealand Herald|date = 8 November 2015|access-date = 8 November 2015|issn = 1170-0777|last = Young|first = Audrey}}</ref> When he was 17, Little got his first job as a labourer digging the main cable trench for a new methanol plant in [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara Valley]] as part of the "[[Think Big]]" project. During his time there he noticed that the contractor he was working for was deliberately using a less than adequate amount of concrete than the work required. He finished work there at the beginning of 1984 and left upon being accepted to enter university.<ref>{{Cite news|title = My Summer Job: Andrew Little, Labour Party Leader|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=11769617|work= [[The New Zealand Herald]]|date = 4 January 2017|access-date = 4 January 2017}}</ref>

In the 1980s he studied law, philosophy and [[public policy]] at [[Victoria University of Wellington]], where he became active in the campaign against New Zealand's [[student loan]] scheme. He was elected president of the [[Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association]] and later served as [[New Zealand Union of Students' Associations]] (NZUSA) president in 1988 and 1989.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.students.org.nz/history | title=New Zealand Union of Students' Associations – General History | publisher=NZUSA | accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>

==Career with trade unions==
After graduating he took a job as a lawyer with the Engineers' Union (a forerunner of the [[Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union|EPMU]]), with his work including [[Accident Compensation Corporation]] (ACC) and [[employment law]] issues.<ref name="whois">{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=11339881 | title=Who is Andrew Little?

Little became an important extra-parliamentary figure within the Labour Party and was one of the main advisors from the trade unions. Little was a representative on Labour's national council as Affiliates Vice-President, responsible for liaison between the Labour Party and affiliated trade unions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labour.org.nz/labour_team/nz_council/index.html |title=New Zealand Council Members |accessdate=10 February 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026130148/http://www.labour.org.nz/labour_team/nz_council/index.html |archivedate=26 October 2007 }}</ref> On 2 March 2009 it was announced that Little was elected unopposed as President of the [[New Zealand Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10559527 | title=Andrew Little elected Labour Party president | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=2 March 2009 | agency=NZPA | accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> He held that post until 2 April 2011.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/john-armstrong-on-politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=1502865&objectid=10716514 | title=John Armstrong: On top for now – in a job no one wants | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=2 April 2011 | accessdate=2 April 2011 | last=Armstrong | first=John}}</ref>

Little stood for Parliament in the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]]; despite a loss in the [[New Plymouth (New Zealand electorate)|New Plymouth]] electorate to the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] incumbent [[Jonathan Young (politician)|Jonathan Young]], he was elected as a list MP owing to his ranking of 15 on the Labour Party list.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.elections.org.nz/events/past-events-0/2011-general-election/parties-candidates-and-promoters-2011-general-election--6 | title=Labour Party List 2011 | publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] | date=15 November 2012 | accessdate=15 February 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215032641/http://www.elections.org.nz/events/past-events-0/2011-general-election/parties-candidates-and-promoters-2011-general-election--6 | archive-date=15 February 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10769371 | title=Colourful crop of new MPs heading for Parliament | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 November 2011 | accessdate=15 February 2015 | last=Donnell | first=Hayden}}</ref>

He took on the ACC portfolio and gained profile during the National Party's restructuring of the organisation.<ref name=whois /> Together with [[Trevor Mallard]], he launched attacks against ACC Minister [[Judith Collins]], who eventually responded with issuing a defamation claim. The affair resulted in the resignations of the [[Accident Compensation Corporation]] (ACC) chairman John Judge, and the ACC chief executive Ralph Stewart.<ref>{{cite news | title=ACC privacy breach timeline | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/7540101/ACC-privacy-breach-timeline | accessdate=15 February 2015 | work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] | date=24 August 2012}}</ref>

At the [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014 election]] he again stood and lost in the New Plymouth electorate.

Little introduced a [[member's bill]] in the ballot that, if passed, would create a new criminal offence of [[corporate manslaughter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/proposed-bills/51HOH_MEMBILL044_1/crimes-corporate-manslaughter-amendment-bill|title=Crimes (Corporate Manslaughter) Amendment Bill|date=3 December 2013|publisher=NZ Parliament}}</ref> The bill was drafted in the wake of the 2010 [[Pike River Mine disaster]] and the [[CTV Building]] collapse during the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/ctv-families-push-corporate-manslaughter-law-5849666 |title=CTV families push for corporate manslaughter law|date=25 February 2014|publisher=One News | accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref> The bill is modelled on the United Kingdom's [[Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007]]. Little believes the bill is needed as "the track record of prosecutions under the Health and Safety Act is that they tend to focus on lower level failures because getting the evidence and securing the conviction are easier, but personal responsibility for fatalities goes unchecked."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.3news.co.nz/politics/corporate-manslaughter-charge-in-new-bill-2012111511 |title=Corporate manslaughter charge in new bill|date=15 November 2012 | publisher=3News | accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref> A 2012 3News poll found that seventy-four percent of respondents would like to see a charge of corporate manslaughter introduced.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.3news.co.nz/politics/government-looking-at-corporate-manslaughter-laws-2012120619 |title=Government looking at corporate manslaughter laws|date=6 December 2012 | publisher=3News | accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>

As Leader of the Labour Party and [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]], Little sought to challenge the Government with a strong alternative narrative. In a 2015 conference speech he introduced a new "Kiwi dream" theme (the [[New Zealand dream]]).<ref name="Edwards2016" /> In 2015 Labour introduced a new slogan, "Backing the Kiwi Dream".<ref>{{cite web|title=Little: Backing The Kiwi Dream – It's Our Future|url=https://itsourfuture.org.nz/little-backing-the-kiwi-dream/|website=It's Our Future|accessdate=15 November 2016|date=1 February 2016}}</ref> Little largely focused on issues and concerns such as rising house prices in urban areas, a '[[brain drain]]', unemployment and job security and the growing wage gap between [[baby boomers]] and [[millennials]]—the "Kiwi dream" narrative was particularly designed to engage young voters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Labour will not abandon our young people as National has Labour will|url=https://socialfeed.info/labour-will-not-abandon-our-young-people-as-national-has-labour-will-9019482|website=socialfeed.info|accessdate=15 November 2016}}</ref>

On 30 November 2015 Little reshuffled his shadow cabinet. He appointed 22 MPs and formally ranked the first 12, including several promotions. He also promoted a Maori MP, [[Nanaia Mahuta]], as shadow spokesperson Treaty of Waitangi negotiations. Little said he saw the line-up as a "blueprint" for a Labour cabinet after 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Little reshuffles shadow cabinet|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/290909/little-reshuffles-shadow-cabinet|website=Radio New Zealand|accessdate=15 November 2016|date=30 November 2015}}</ref>

In October 2016 Labour floated the idea of a levy on employers who imported offshore [[skilled labour]] rather than upskilled their domestic workers. Little responded to criticisms that it amounted to a "tax on immigrants", saying "If we want to make sure we've got the skills for the future ... for those employers who don't take on apprentices, don't invest in training, you can contribute a levy and that'll help to defray the cost of those who are doing the training".<ref name="businessreview">{{cite web|title=Labour considers tax on those who hire offshore to fill skilled positions|url=https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/labour-considers-tax-those-who-hire-offshore-fill-skilled-positions-196362|website=The National Business Review|accessdate=15 November 2016|date=6 November 2016}}</ref> Little also criticised the number of [[travel visa]]s granted to semi-skilled workers, citing statistics. Kirk Hope, Chief executive of [[Business New Zealand]], criticised the proposal policy and warned that it would affect smaller businesses who are unable to recruit enough local workers.<ref name="businessreview" />

Little was sued for defamation by Lani and [[Earl Hagaman]] after he made statements linking a contract awarded to their company with donations they had made to the National Party.

On 20 November 2017, Little announced the creation of the [[Pike River Recovery Agency]] to plan a manned re-entry of the [[Pike River Mine]] in order to recover the bodies of the 29 miners who perished during the [[Pike River Mine disaster]] in September 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pike River Mine Factsheet|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-11/Pike%20River%20Mine%20Factsheet%20201117%20.pdf|publisher=[[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment]]|accessdate=22 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Pike River Recovery Agency established|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1711/S00123/pike-river-recovery-agency-established.htm|accessdate=22 November 2017|agency=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]]|publisher=[[New Zealand Government]]|date=20 November 2017}}</ref> On 19 April 2018, Little entered the Pike River mine portal with victims' family representatives Anna Osborne and Sonya Rockhouse to demonstrate that a safe re-entry was possible.

In December 2017, Little announced plans to reduce the prison population by 30 per cent over the next 15 years.<ref>[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11951816 Andrew Little says he will reduce the prison population], NZ Herald, 2 December 2017</ref> The prison population at the time was 10,394.<ref>[https://www.corrections.govt.nz/resources/research_and_statistics/quarterly_prison_statistics/previous_years_prison_statistics/prison_stats_december_2017#total Prison facts and statistics - December 2017] Practice: the New Zealand Corrections Journal, December 2017</ref> Towards this goal, in May 2018, he announced the Government would repeal the contentious 'three strikes' law – the [[Sentencing and Parole Reform Act 2010]]<ref>[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12061558 'Three strikes' law repeal goes before Cabinet next week], NZ Herald, 30 May 2018</ref> – which had been introduced by the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|previous National Government]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Three strikes law to stay as Labour say NZ First unlikely to support repealing it – 'This is about making good decisions, not fast decisions' |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/three-strikes-law-stay-labour-say-nz-first-unlikely-support-repealing-making-good-decisions-not-fast |accessdate=22 June 2018 |publisher=[[1 News]] |date=11 June 2018}}</ref> NZ First refused to back this proposal forcing Little to announce on 11 June 2018 that the coalition Government had abandoned the plan.<ref>{{cite news |title=NZ First forces Labour to ditch three strikes law repeal |url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/politics/nz-first-not-supporting-three-strikes-law-changes-yet/ |accessdate=22 June 2018 |publisher=[[Newstalk ZB]] |date=11 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Young |first1=Audrey |title=Sensible Sentencing Trust thanks NZ First for halting plans to repeal of Three Strikes law |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12068425 |accessdate=22 June 2018 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=11 June 2018}}</ref>

Little later voiced criticism of Australia's deportation of [[New Zealanders in Australia]] during a controversial [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] documentary entitled "Don't Call Australia Home", that was released on 17 July 2018. Under changes to the Australian [[Migration Act 1958|Migration Act]], any foreigners with a criminal record or who do not meet a "character test" are subject to deportation. Little remarked that Australia's deportation policy would damage the sibling relationship between the two countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=Don't Call Australia Home! |url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/don%E2%80%99t-call-australia-home!/10005152 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=17 July 2018}}</ref> Little's remarks drew criticism from the Australian [[Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)|Assistant Minister for Home Affairs]] [[Alex Hawke]], who defended the deportations on law and order grounds and criticized Little for not urging New Zealand citizens to obey Australian law.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Khalil |first1=Shireen |title=‘Program did not consider the impact on victims’: ABC slammed by MP over NZ deportation piece |url=https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/program-did-not-consider-the-impact-on-victims-abc-slammed-by-mp-over-nz-deportation-piece/news-story/c34c0bc1637c6b38fea9c28f1567d12c |accessdate=19 July 2018 |work=[[news.com.au]] |date=19 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Khalil |first1=Shireen |title='No consideration for victims': ABC slammed over NZ deportation programme |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=12091803 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=19 July 2018}}</ref> In response, Little criticized Australia's deportation laws for lacking "humanitarian ideals" and described the removal of New Zealand citizens who identified as Australian residents as a human rights violation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Justice Minister Andrew Little's tough words for Australia |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/07/andrew-little-s-tough-words-for-australia.html |accessdate=19 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=19 July 2018}}</ref> In response, the Australian [[Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Home Affairs]] [[Peter Dutton]] defended his government's deportation policy and called on Little to reflect "a little more" on the [[Trans-Tasman]] relationship. Little countered by expressing concern about what he perceived as a growing "venality" in Australia's treatment of foreigners.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bennett |first1=Lucy |title=Peter Dutton vows to continue deportations following criticism from Andrew Little |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12092448 |accessdate=20 July 2018 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=20 July 2018}}</ref>

On 24 July 2018, Little rejected a call by the [[United Nations]] committee on women's rights for a Royal Commission of Inquiry into New Zealand's [[Family Court of New Zealand|Family Court]] system, saying the New Zealand Government already has a fair idea of what the problems were. Little had already ordered a Ministerial Review of the Family Court.<ref>{{cite news |title=Andrew Little rejects UN women's committee call for Royal Commission into New Zealand Family Court |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/andrew-little-rejects-un-womens-committee-call-royal-commission-into-new-zealand-family-court |accessdate=24 July 2018 |publisher=[[1 News]] |date=24 July 2018}}</ref>

After the [[Christchurch mosque shootings]] in March 2019, Little told [[Radio New Zealand]], “I have given authority to the agencies to do intrusive activities under warrant, the number of those (warrants) I’m not at liberty to disclose". He said that the intelligence services usually put 30 to 40 people under monitoring at a time. Although more people than usual were being monitored, he was not willing to reveal how many. He also stated that the operations could be anything from physical surveillance to watching telecommunications activity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/03/27/asia-pacific/new-zealand-allows-intrusive-spy-operations-christchurch-mosque-shootings/|title=New Zealand allows 'intrusive' spy operations after Christchurch mosque shootings|date=27 March 2019|work=[[The Japan Times]] Online|access-date=28 March 2019|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}</ref>

On 5 August 2019, as Justice Minister, Little announced abortion law reform legislation that would permit [[Abortion in New Zealand|abortion]] without restrictions for the first 20 weeks of a woman's pregnancy. While later-term abortions will still require testing by medical experts, Little announced that abortion would also be removed from the [[Crimes Act 1961]]. Other changes include allowing women to self-refer to an abortion service, ensuring that health practitioners advise women about counselling services, establishing safe areas around abortion facilities, and ensuring that conscientious objecting doctors inform women about their stance and alternative services.<ref>{{cite news |title=Govt unveils sweeping abortion law changes |url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/govt-unveils-sweeping-abortion-law-changes |accessdate=5 August 2019 |newspaper=[[Otago Daily Times]] |date=5 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Whyte |first1=Anna |title=New Government bill seeks to remove abortion from Crimes Act, treat it as a health issue |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/new-government-bill-seeks-remove-abortion-crimes-act-treat-health-issue |accessdate=5 August 2019 |publisher=[[1 News]] |date=5 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Jancic |first1=Boris |title=Government unveils abortion law reforms |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12255624 |accessdate=4 August 2019 |newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=5 August 2019}}</ref> Labour had negotiated with New Zealand First cabinet minister [[Tracey Martin]] for several months to ensure support for the legislation. Though Martin ruled out a referendum, she was overruled by NZ First party leader [[Winston Peters]], who demanded a binding referendum. Little rejected Peters' call for a referendum, stating that the Government would seek the support of MPs from all parties to pass the legislation.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moir |first1=Jo |title=Abortion reform: Andrew Little says no deal as Winston Peters springs referendum call |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12256299 |accessdate=19 August 2019 |newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=7 August 2019}}</ref> On 18 March 2020, he voted for the bill at its third reading, and it became law as the [[Abortion Legislation Act 2020]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Coughlan |first1=Thomas |title=Abortion legalised in New Zealand with Parliament passing new law in 68-51 vote |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/120389800/new-zealands-fourdecade-old-abortion-laws-have-changed-after-law-passes-final-reading |accessdate=3 April 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff.co.nz]] |date=18 March 2020}}</ref>

On 22 July 2020, Little was appointed [[Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety]] following the resignation of [[Iain Lees-Galloway]] due to an affair with one of his staff members.<ref name="1 News 22 July 2020" />

====Second term (2020&ndash;present)====
