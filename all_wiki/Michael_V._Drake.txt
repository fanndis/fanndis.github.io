==Controversies==

===Chemerinsky firing and rehiring===
{{See also|University of California, Irvine School of Law#Chemerinsky hiring controversy}}
Drake's first major firing scandal was to fire the Dean of the [[UCI law school]], [[Erwin Chemerinsky]]. After Chemerinsky signed a contract on September 4, 2007, Drake rescinded the offer because he felt the law professor's commentaries were "polarizing"; Drake claimed the decision was his own and not the subject of any outside influence.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Therolf|first=Garrett|last2=Weinstein|first2=Henry|date=September 13, 2007|title=UC Irvine post is taken from liberal legal scholar|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-sep-13-me-uci13-story.html|access-date=July 7, 2020|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref>

The action was criticized by both liberal and conservative scholars who felt it hindered the academic mission of the law school and violated principles of [[academic freedom]]. Few believed Drake's claims that it was not the result of outside influence.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Parsons|first=Dana|date=September 13, 2007|title=Excuse for UCI's fumble isn't good enough|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-sep-13-me-parsons13-story.html|access-date=July 7, 2020|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref> The issue was the subject of an [[editorial]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on September 14, 2007.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/opinion/14fri3.html | work=The New York Times | title=A Bad Beginning in Irvine | date=September 14, 2007 | accessdate=May 2, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504205617/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/opinion/14fri3.html | archive-date=May 4, 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref> Details emerged revealing that UCI had received criticism on the hire from the [[California Supreme Court]]'s then-Chief Justice [[Ronald M. George]], who criticized Chemerinsky's grasp of death penalty appeals, as well as a group of prominent local [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] who wanted to stop the appointment, including Los Angeles County Supervisor [[Michael D. Antonovich]]. Drake traveled over a weekend to meet with Chemerinsky in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], North Carolina, where Chemerinsky was a professor at the [[Duke University School of Law]] at the time, and the two reached an agreement.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Therolf|first=Garrett|last2=Paddock|first2=Richard C.|date=September 18, 2007|title=Law dean is rehired as furor goes on|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-sep-18-me-uci18-story.html|access-date=July 7, 2020|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref> On September 17, Chemerinsky issued a joint press release with Drake indicating that Chemerinsky would head the UCI law school.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Drake|first=Michael V.|last2=Chemerinsky|first2=Erwin|date=September 17, 2007|title=Statement From Chemerinsky & Drake|url=http://www.ocblog.net/ocblog/2007/09/statement-fro-1.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029170502/http://www.ocblog.net/ocblog/2007/09/statement-fro-1.html|archive-date=October 29, 2007|access-date=July 7, 2020|website=OC Blog}}</ref> On September 20, 2007, Chemerinsky's hire was formally approved by the [[Regents of the University of California]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=September 20, 2007|title=Erwin Chemerinsky named founding dean of UC Irvine's Donald Bren School of Law|work=UC Irvine Today|url=http://today.uci.edu/iframe.php?p=/news/release_detail_iframe.asp?key=1665|url-status=dead|access-date=July 7, 2020|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120114011928/http://today.uci.edu/iframe.php?p=/news/release_detail_iframe.asp?key=1665|archive-date=January 14, 2012}}</ref> In 2014, Chemerinsky said that he and Drake had since reconciled.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rivera|first=Carla|date=January 30, 2014|title=UC Irvine chancellor takes top job at Ohio State|work=Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2014-jan-30-la-me-uci-chancellor-20140131-story.html|access-date=July 7, 2020}}</ref>
