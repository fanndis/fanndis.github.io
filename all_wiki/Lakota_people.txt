The '''Lakota''' (pronounced {{IPA-sio|laˈkˣota|}}; {{lang-lkt|Lakȟóta/Lakhóta}}) are a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[tribe (Native American)|tribe]]. Also known as the '''Teton Sioux''' (from ''Thítȟuŋwaŋ''),<ref name=NLD>Ullrich, Jan. (2008). ''New Lakota Dictionary''. Lakota Language Consortium. {{ISBN|0-9761082-9-1}}</ref> they are one of the three prominent subcultures of the [[Sioux]] people. Their current lands are in [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]]. They speak [[Lakota language|''Lakȟótiyapi''—the Lakota language]], the westernmost of three closely related languages that belong to the [[Siouan languages|Siouan language]] family.

The seven bands or "sub-tribes" of the Lakota are:

==History==
[[File:VOALoguetipidetail300.jpg|left|thumb|Scenes of battle and horse raiding decorate a [[Calico|muslin]] Lakota [[tipi]] from the late 19th or early 20th century]]

[[Siouan languages|Siouan language]] speakers may have originated in the lower [[Mississippi River]] region and then migrated to or originated in the [[Ohio Valley]]. They were agriculturalists and may have been part of the [[Mound builder (people)|Mound Builder civilization]] during the 9th–12th centuries CE.<ref name=p329>Pritzker 329</ref> Lakota legend and other sources state they originally lived near the Great Lakes:  "The tribes of the Dakota before European contact in the 1600 lived in the region around Lake Superior. In this forest environment, they lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering wild rice. They also grew some corn, but their locale was near the limit of where corn could be grown." This may be conflation with the Algonquian groups typically in that region, though Siouan peoples probably migrated there later. <ref>[https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/lakota.htm]   "History of the Dakota Tribes"]</ref> In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Dakota-Lakota speakers lived in the upper Mississippi Region in present-day [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Iowa]], and [[the Dakotas]]. Conflicts with [[Anishnaabe]] and [[Cree people]]s pushed the Lakota west onto the Great Plains in the mid- to late-17th century.<ref name=p329/>

Early Lakota history is recorded in their [[winter counts]] ([[Lakota language|Lakota]]: ''waníyetu wówapi''), pictorial calendars painted on hides, or later recorded on paper. The Battiste Good winter count records Lakota history back to 900 CE when [[White Buffalo Calf Woman]] gave the Lakota people the White Buffalo Calf Pipe.<ref>[http://wintercounts.si.edu/html_version/html/thewintercounts.html "Lakota Winter Counts."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302222234/http://wintercounts.si.edu/html_version/html/thewintercounts.html |date=March 2, 2012 }} ''Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.''

Around 1730, [[Cheyenne people]] introduced the Lakota to [[horse]]s,<ref name="cheyenne">{{cite web| last =Liberty | first =Dr. Margot | url = http://www.friendslittlebighorn.com/cheyenneprimacy.htm| title = Cheyenne Primacy: The Tribes' Perspective As Opposed To That Of The United States Army; A Possible Alternative To 'The Great Sioux War Of 1876'| publisher = Friends of the Little Bighorn| accessdate =January 13, 2008}}</ref> called ''šuŋkawakaŋ'' ("dog [of] power/mystery/wonder"). After they adopted [[horse culture]], Lakota society centered on the [[American Bison|buffalo]] hunt on horseback. The total population of the Sioux (Lakota, [[Santee Dakota|Santee]], [[Yankton people|Yankton]], and [[Yanktonai]]) was estimated at 28,000 by French explorers in 1660.  The Lakota population was first estimated at 8,500 in 1805, growing steadily and reaching 16,110 in 1881.  Thus, the Lakota were one of the few Native American tribes to increase in population in the 19th century. The number of Lakota has now expanded to more than 170,000,<ref>[https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-10.pdf]. Census.gov.

After 1720, the Lakota branch of the Seven Council Fires split into two major sects, the Saône, who moved to the [[Lake Traverse]] area on the South Dakota–North Dakota–Minnesota border, and the Oglála-Sičháŋǧu who occupied the [[James River (Dakotas)|James River]] valley. However, by about 1750 the Saône had moved to the east bank of the [[Missouri River]], followed 10 years later by the Oglála and Brulé (Sičháŋǧu).

The large and powerful [[Arikara]], [[Mandan]], and [[Hidatsa]] villages had long prevented the Lakota from crossing [[Missouri River|Missouri.]] However, the great [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]] of 1772–1780 destroyed three-quarters of these tribes. The Lakota crossed the river into the drier, short-grass prairies of the High Plains. These newcomers were the Saône, well-mounted and increasingly confident, who spread out quickly. In 1765, a Saône exploring and raiding party led by Chief Standing Bear discovered the [[Black Hills]] (the ''[[Paha Sapa]]''), then the territory of the [[Cheyenne]]. Ten years later, the Oglála and Brulé also crossed the river. In 1765, a Saône exploring and raiding party led by Chief Standing Bear discovered the [[Black Hills]] (the ''[[Paha Sapa]]''), then the [[Cheyenne]] territory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kiowas|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.na.055|work= Encyclopedia of the Great Plains|accessdate=2013-06-23|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Cheyenne then moved west to the Powder River country,<ref name="cheyenne" /> and the Lakota made the Black Hills their home.

Initial United States contact with the Lakota during the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] of 1804–1806 was marked by a standoff. Lakota bands refused to allow the explorers to continue upstream, and the expedition prepared for battle, which never came.<ref>''The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition'', University of Nebraska.</ref>

Some bands of Lakotas became the first Indians to help the United States Army in an Indian war west of the Missouri during the [[Arikara War]] in 1823.<ref>Meyer, Roy W.: The Village Indians of the Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras. Lincoln and London, 1977, p. 54.</ref>

In 1843, the southern Lakotas attacked Pawnee Chief Blue Coat's village near the [[Loup River|Loup]] in Nebraska, killing many and burning half of the earth lodges.<ref>Jensen, Richard E.: The Pawnee Mission, 1834–1846.

[[File:Lakota 1851 treaty territory. (Area 408, 516, 584, 597, 598 and 632).png|thumb|Lakota 1851 treaty territory (Area 408, 516, 584, 597, 598 and 632)]]

Nearly half a century later, after [[Fort Laramie]] had been built without permission on Lakota land, the [[Fort Laramie Treaty (1851)|Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851]] was negotiated to protect travelers on the [[Oregon Trail]]. The Cheyenne and Lakota had previously attacked emigrant parties in a competition for resources, and also because some settlers had encroached on their lands.<ref>Brown, Dee (1950) ''Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee''Macmillan {{ISBN|0-8050-6669-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8050-6669-2}}</ref> The Fort Laramie Treaty acknowledged Lakota sovereignty over the [[Great Plains]] in exchange for free passage on the [[Oregon Trail]] for "as long as the river flows and the eagle flies".

The United States government did not enforce the treaty restriction against unauthorized settlement. Lakota and other bands attacked settlers and even emigrant trains, causing public pressure on the U.S. Army to punish the hostiles. On September 3, 1855, 700 soldiers under [[United States|American]] General [[William S. Harney]] avenged the [[Grattan Massacre]] by attacking a Lakota village in [[Nebraska]], killing about 100 men, women, and children. A series of short "wars" followed, and in 1862–1864, as refugees from the "[[Dakota War of 1862]]" in Minnesota fled west to their allies in [[Montana]] and Dakota Territory. Increasing illegal settlement after the [[American Civil War]] caused war once again.

The Black Hills were considered sacred by the Lakota, and they objected to [[mining]]. Between 1866 and 1868 the U.S. Army fought the Lakota and their allies along the [[Bozeman Trail in Wyoming|Bozeman Trail]] over U.S. Forts built to protect miners traveling along the trail. Oglala Chief Red Cloud led his people to victory in [[Red Cloud's War]]. In 1868, the United States signed the [[Fort Laramie Treaty (1868)|Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868]], exempting the Black Hills from all white settlement forever. Four years later [[gold]] was discovered there, and prospectors descended on the area.

The attacks on settlers and miners were met by military force conducted by army commanders such as Lieutenant Colonel [[George Armstrong Custer]]. General [[Philip Sheridan]] encouraged his troops to hunt and kill the buffalo as a means of "destroying the Indians' commissary."<ref>Winona LaDuke, ''All Our Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life'', (Cambridge, MA: [[South End Press]], 1999), 141.</ref>

The allied Lakota and [[Arapaho]] bands and the unified [[Northern Cheyenne]] were involved in much of the warfare after 1860. They fought a successful delaying action against General George Crook's army at the [[Battle of the Rosebud]], preventing Crook from locating and attacking their camp, and a week later defeated the [[U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment|U.S. 7th Cavalry]] in 1876 at the [[Battle of the Greasy Grass]] in the [[Crow Indian Reservation]] of 1868.<ref>Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and treaties. Washington, 1904. Vol. 2, pp. 998–1004.</ref> Custer attacked a camp of several tribes, much larger than he realized. Their combined forces, led by Chief Crazy Horse killed 258 soldiers, wiping out the entire Custer battalion in the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], and inflicting more than 50% casualties on the regiment.

Their victory over the U.S. Army would not last, however. The U.S. Congress authorized funds to expand the army by 2,500 men. The reinforced US Army defeated the Lakota bands in a series of battles, finally ending the [[Great Sioux War]] in 1877. The Lakota were eventually confined onto reservations, prevented from hunting buffalo and forced to accept government food distribution.

[[File:Pine Ridge Flag.svg|thumb|240px|Oglala Sioux tribal flag]]

In 1877, some of the Lakota bands signed a treaty that ceded the Black Hills to the United States; however, the nature of this treaty and its passage were controversial. The number of Lakota leaders that actually backed the treaty is highly disputed. Low-intensity conflicts continued in the Black Hills.  Fourteen years later, [[Sitting Bull]] was killed at [[Standing Rock]] reservation on December 15, 1890.  The U.S. Army attacked Spotted Elk (aka Bigfoot), Mnicoujou band of Lakota at the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] on December 29, 1890, at Pine Ridge.

Today, the Lakota are found mostly in the five reservations of western South Dakota: 
* [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]], home of the Upper Sičhánǧu or Brulé. 
* [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]], home of the Oglála.
* [[Lower Brule Indian Reservation]], home of the Lower Sičhaŋǧu. 
* [[Cheyenne River Indian Reservation]], home of several other of the seven Lakota bands, including the Mnikȟówožu, Itázipčho, Sihásapa, and Oóhenumpa. 
* [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation]], home of the Húŋkpapȟa and to people from many other bands.

Lakota also live on the [[Fort Peck Indian Reservation]] in northeastern [[Montana]], the [[Fort Berthold Indian Reservation]] of northwestern North Dakota, and several small reserves in [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]]. Their ancestors fled to "Grandmother's [i.e. Queen Victoria's] Land" ([[Canada]]) during the Minnesota or Black Hills War.

Large numbers of Lakota live in [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] and other towns in the Black Hills, and in metro [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]. Lakota elders joined the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] (UNPO) to seek protection and recognition for their cultural and land rights.

Tribal governments have significant leeway, as [[autonomy|semi-autonomous]] political entities, in deviating from state law (e.g. [[Indian gaming]]). They are ultimately subject to supervisory oversight by the [[United States Congress]]<ref name="autogenerated1" /> and executive regulation through the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]].

There are nine bands of Dakota and Lakota in [[Manitoba]] and southern [[Saskatchewan]], with a total of 6,000 registered members. They are recognized as First Nations but are not considered "treaty Indians". As First Nations they receive rights and entitlements through the [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]] department.

There have been numerous actions, occupations, and proposed independence movements, led by a variety of individuals and coalitions.

In 1980, the Supreme Court decided in ''[[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians]]'' to award $122 million to eight bands of Sioux Indians as compensation for their [[Black Hills Land Claim|Black Hills land claims]]. The Sioux have refused the money, because accepting the settlement would legally terminate their demands for return of the Black Hills. The money remains in a [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] account, accruing [[compound interest]]. As of 2011, the account has grown to over $1 billion.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957595,00.html?promoid=googlep | work=Time | title=Race: The Price of Penance | date=May 8, 1989 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/03/saying-no-to-1-billion/308380/|title=Saying No to $1 Billion|last=Streshinsky|first=Maria|work=The Atlantic|access-date=November 25, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Current activism ==
The Lakota People made national news when NPR's "Lost Children, Shattered Families" investigative story aired.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/series/141763531/native-foster-care-lost-children-shattered-families/ "Lost Children, Shattered Families"]</ref> It exposed what many critics consider to be the "kidnapping" of Lakota children from their homes by the state of South Dakota's Department of Social Services (D.S.S.). Lakota activists such as [[Madonna Thunder Hawk]] and [[Chase Iron Eye]]s, along with the ''Lakota People’s Law Project'', have alleged that Lakota grandmothers are illegally denied the right to foster their own grandchildren. They are currently working to redirect federal funding away from the state of South Dakota's D.S.S. to new tribal foster care programs. This would be an historic shift away from the state's traditional control over Lakota foster children.

Another short film, ''Lakota in America'', was produced by Square. The film features Genevieve Iron Lightning, a young Lakota dancer on the [[Cheyenne River Indian Reservation|Cheyenne River Reservation]], one of the poorest communities in the [[USA]].

The name ''Lakota'' comes from the Lakota autonym, ''Lakota'' "feeling affection, friendly, united, allied". The early French historic documents did not distinguish a separate Teton division, instead grouping them with other "Sioux of the West," [[Sioux#Santee (Isáŋyati or Eastern Dakota)|Santee]] and [[Yankton Sioux|Yankton]] bands.

The names ''Teton'' and ''Tetuwan'' come from the Lakota name ''thítȟuŋwaŋ'', the meaning of which is obscure. This term was used to refer to the Lakota by non-Lakota Sioux groups. Other derivations include: ti tanka, Tintonyanyan, Titon, Tintonha, Thintohas, Tinthenha, Tinton, Thuntotas, Tintones, Tintoner, Tintinhos, Ten-ton-ha, Thinthonha, Tinthonha, Tentouha, Tintonwans, Tindaw, Tinthow, Atintons, Anthontans, Atentons, Atintans, Atrutons, Titoba, Tetongues, Teton Sioux, Teeton, Ti toan, Teetwawn, Teetwans, Ti-t’-wawn, Ti-twans, Tit’wan, Tetans, Tieton, and Teetonwan.

Early French sources call the Lakota ''Sioux'' with an additional modifier, such as Sioux of the West, West Schious, Sioux des prairies, Sioux occidentaux, Sioux of the Meadows, Nadooessis of the Plains, Prairie Indians, Sioux of the Plain, Maskoutens-Nadouessians, Mascouteins Nadouessi, and Sioux nomades.

Today many of the tribes continue to officially call themselves ''Sioux''. In the 19th and 20th centuries, this was the name which the US government applied to all Dakota/Lakota people. However, some tribes have formally or informally adopted traditional names: the Rosebud Sioux Tribe is also known as the Sičháŋǧu Oyáte (Brulé Nation), and the Oglala often use the name Oglála Lakȟóta Oyáte, rather than the English "Oglala Sioux Tribe" or OST. (The alternate English spelling of Ogallala is deprecated, even though it is closer to the correct pronunciation.) The Lakota have names for their own subdivisions. The Lakota also are Western of the three Sioux groups, occupying lands in both North and South Dakota.
