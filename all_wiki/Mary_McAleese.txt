McAleese used her time in office to address issues concerning [[justice]], [[social equality]], [[Social exclusion|social inclusion]], anti-[[sectarianism]] and reconciliation. She described her presidency's theme as "Building Bridges".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/ksgpress/bulletin/winter_spring1999/one_heart.html |title=One Heart at a Time |work=Harvard Kennedy School |date=Winter–Spring 1999 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219042250/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/ksgpress/bulletin/winter_spring1999/one_heart.html |archivedate=19 December 2011 }}</ref> This bridge-building materialised in her attempts to reach out to the [[Ulster unionism|unionist]] community in Northern Ireland.

She later claimed that she was given to understand that the nature of the meeting was to be a discussion among all sides and opinions.<ref>Ruth Riddick, The Right to Choose: Questions of Feminist Morality (Dublin 1990) pages 4-9</ref>

During the same decade she was legal advisor to and a founding member of the [[Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform]]. She left this position in 1979, to join [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] as a journalist and presenter, during one period as a reporter and presenter for their ''Today Tonight'' programme. However, in RTÉ, she and [[Alex White (politician)|Alex White]] (then a TV producer and later a Labour Party TD) were attacked and criticised by a group led by [[Eoghan Harris]], associated with the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]], over what they perceived as her bias towards republican groups in the North. McAleese was critical of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]], but believed it was important to hear their side of the story; she opposed the Harris faction's support for [[Censorship in the Republic of Ireland#The_Troubles: RTÉ and Section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act|Section 31]], which she believed was an attack on free speech.<ref name="HanleyMillar2009">{{cite book|last1=Hanley|first1=Brian|last2=Millar|first2=Scott|title=The lost revolution: the story of the official IRA and the workers' party|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article6814880.ece|accessdate=16 January 2011|date=26 March 2009|publisher=Penguin Ireland|isbn=978-1-84488-120-8}}</ref> In 1981, she returned to the Reid Professorship, but continued to work part-time for RTÉ for a further four years.<ref name=":0" /> In 1987, she returned to Queen's University, to become Director of the Institute of Professional Legal Studies. She stood, unsuccessfully, as a [[Fianna Fáil]] candidate in the [[Dublin South-East (Dáil constituency)|Dublin South-East]] constituency at the [[1987 Irish general election|1987 general election]], receiving 2,243 votes (5.9%).

McAleese has a long-standing involvement in ecumenism and anti-sectarianism.  She co-chaired the working party on sectarianism setup by the Irish Inter-Church Meeting in 1991 and its report (1993) was described by Professor Marianne Elliot as "the most notable" work of the Inter-Church Meetings. McAleese was the author and presenter of a successful [[BBC Radio Ulster]] series called "The Protestant Mind" which encouraged the divided communities in Northern Ireland to try to stand in each other's shoes.  McAleese was a member of the Catholic Church Episcopal Delegation to the New Ireland Forum in 1984, and a member of the Catholic Church delegation to the Northern Ireland Commission on Contentious Parades in 1996. She was also a delegate to the 1995 [[White House]] Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland and to the subsequent [[Pittsburgh]] Conference in 1996. She became the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Queen's University Belfast.<ref name="Irishwomen Find Niche (And It's Not In Kitchen)"/> Prior to becoming president in 1997, McAleese had also held the following positions: [[Channel 4|Channel 4 Television]], Director, [[Northern Ireland Electricity]], Director, Royal Group of Hospitals Trust and Founding member of the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas.<ref name=aras/>

==Presidency==
McAleese is a member of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]], an international network of current and former women Presidents and Prime Ministers, whose mission is to mobilise the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwwl.org/members.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710015240/http://www.cwwl.org/members.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 July 2009 |title=Council Members |accessdate=12 December 2009 |publisher=[[Council of Women World Leaders]] }}</ref>

===First term (1997–2004)===
{{Main|1997 Irish presidential election}}
In 1997, McAleese defeated former [[Taoiseach]] [[Albert Reynolds]] in an internal party election held to determine the [[Fianna Fáil]] nomination for the Irish presidency.

Her opponents in the [[1997 Irish presidential election|1997 presidential election]] were [[Mary Banotti]] of [[Fine Gael]], [[Adi Roche]] (the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] candidate) and two Independents: [[Dana Rosemary Scallon]] and [[Derek Nally]].

McAleese won the presidency with 45.2% of first preference votes. In the second and final count against Banotti, McAleese won 55.6% of preferences. On 11 November 1997, she was inaugurated as the eighth President of Ireland. Within weeks of this she made her first official overseas trip to [[Lebanon]].<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1015/1224305838919.html "President revisits Lebanon on her final foreign trip in office"], ''The Irish Times'', 15 October 2011.</ref>

McAleese described the theme of her presidency as "building bridges". The first individual born in Northern Ireland to become President of Ireland, President McAleese was a regular visitor to Northern Ireland throughout her presidency, where she was on the whole warmly welcomed by both communities, confounding critics who had believed she would be a divisive figure. People from Northern Ireland, indeed people from right across the nine-county Province of [[Ulster]], were regular and recurring visitors to [[Áras an Uachtaráin]] while she was president.<ref name="Honorary degree for Martin McAleese"/> She is also an admirer of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], whom she came to know when she was Pro-Vice-Chancellor of [[Queen's University of Belfast]]. In March 1998, President McAleese stated that she would officially celebrate the [[Twelfth of July]] as well as [[Saint Patrick's Day]], recognising the day's importance among [[Ulster]] [[Protestants]].

She also incurred some criticism from some of the [[Irish Catholic]] hierarchy by taking communion in an [[Anglican]] ([[Church of Ireland]]) Cathedral, in Dublin, on 7 December 1997, although 78 percent of Irish people approved of her action in a following opinion poll. While Cardinal [[Desmond Connell]] called her action a "sham" and a "deception", [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] said it was ironic that "the Church was condemning an act of reconciliation and bridge-building between the denominations."<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/communionwithnon0000vand |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/communionwithnon0000vand/page/51 51]–53 |title=Communion with Non-Catholic Christians: Risks, Challenges, and Opportunities |publisher=Liturgical Press |isbn=9780814628959 |last1=Vanderwilt |first1=Jeffrey Thomas |year=2003 }}</ref>

In 1998, she met the [[Archbishop of Boston]] [[Bernard Francis Law|Cardinal Bernard Francis Law]], on an official visit to the [[United States]]. In an interview in 2012, she said that Law told her he was "sorry for Catholic Ireland to have you as President" and went on to insult a [[Minister of State (Ireland)|Minister of State]], who was accompanying President McAleese. "His remarks were utterly inappropriate and unwelcome," she said. McAleese told the cardinal that she was the "President of Ireland and not just of Catholic Ireland". At this point, a heated argument ensued between the two, according to McAleese.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/mcaleese-reveals-attack-by-disgraced-cardinal-3251159.html | work=Irish Independent | title=McAleese reveals 'attack' by disgraced cardinal}}</ref>

===Second term (2004–2011)===
{{Main|2004 Irish presidential election}}
McAleese's initial seven-year term of office ended in November 2004, but she stood for a second term in the [[2004 Irish presidential election|2004 presidential election]]. Following the failure of any other candidate to secure the necessary support for nomination, the incumbent president stood unopposed, with no political party affiliation,<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2004-10-01|title=McAleese to serve second term in office|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2004/1001/55042-president/|language=en}}</ref> and was declared elected on 1 October 2004. She was re-inaugurated at the commencement of her second seven-year term on 11 November 2004. McAleese's very high approval ratings were widely seen as the reason for her re-election, with no opposition party willing to bear the cost (financial or political) of competing in an election that would prove difficult to win.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2004/0207/breaking4.html|title=President would defeat Higgins, poll shows|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=7 February 2004|accessdate=28 December 2004}}</ref>

On 27 January 2005, following her attendance at the ceremony commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], she created friction by referring to the way some Protestant children in Northern Ireland had been raised to hate Catholics, just as European children "for generations, for centuries" were encouraged to hate [[Jews]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.president.ie/index.php?section=5&speech=43&lang=eng|title=Interview with President McAleese, Morning Ireland|work=www.president.ie|date=27 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4214263.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|title=McAleese row over Nazi comments|date=28 January 2005|accessdate=18 February 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/?c=IRELAND&jp=kfidgbgbqlmh&d=2005-01-27|title=McAleese: Protestant children taught to hate Catholics|work=BreakingNews.ie|date=27 January 2005|accessdate=1 September 2007}}</ref> These remarks provoked outrage among [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist politicians]].

[[File:Mary McAleese and Dmitry Medvedev.jpeg|thumb|right|McAleese meets with [[President of Russia]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in 2010]]
She was the [[Commencement speech|Commencement Speaker]] at [[Villanova University]] in [[Villanova, Pennsylvania]], on 22 May 2005.

In 2019, McAleese published "Children's Rights & Obligations in Canon Law: The Christening Contracts (Brill Publishers).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.marymcaleese.com/the-christening-contract | title=The Christening Contract| date=22 November 2019}}</ref>

===Inclusion of women in the formation of the Catholic Faith===
In March 2018, McAleese asked "If you are going to exclude women in perpetuity from priesthood and if all decision-making, discernment and policy-making in the Church is going to continue to be filtered through the male priesthood, tell me how in justice and charity, but most importantly in equality, are you going to include the voices of women in the formation of the Catholic faith?  What radical, innovative, strategic ideas do you have for their inclusion while being excluded for priesthood? And that's the question they have not answered.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite web | url=https://www.thejournal.ie/mary-mcaleese-catholic-church-3891496-Mar2018/ | title=Mary McAleese says it's 'pure codology' that women can't become priests}}</ref>

On the ordination of women, McAleese said "I believe that women should be ordained, I believe the theology on which that is based is pure codology. I'm not even going to be bothered arguing it. Sooner or later it'll fall apart, fall asunder under its own dead weight."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

On International's Women Day, McAleese described the Catholic Church as "an empire of misogyny". She said "This regrettable situation arises because the Catholic Church has long since been a primary global carrier of the toxic virus of misogyny…Its leadership has never sought a cure for that virus although the cure is freely available. Its name is equality."<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.irishcentral.com/news/politics/mary-mcaleese-catholic-church-misogyny-sexism |title = Former Irish president Mary McAleese brands Catholic Church "empire of misogyny"|date = 9 March 2018}}</ref>

In response to her speech, the Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin said "Her challenge to the internal culture of the Church today was brutally stark. Some may find it unpleasant or unwelcome. I must accept the challenge with the humility of one who recognises her alienation."<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/diarmuid-martin-accepts-mcaleese-criticisms-of-restrictions-on-women-1.3420980?mode=sample&auth-failed=1&pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fnews%2Fsocial-affairs%2Freligion-and-beliefs%2Fdiarmuid-martin-accepts-mcaleese-criticisms-of-restrictions-on-women-1.3420980 |title = Diarmuid Martin accepts McAleese criticisms of restrictions on women}}</ref>

===2018 Women's Day Conference===
McAleese was due to speak on a panel at a Voices of Faith conference in the Vatican on [[International Women's Day]] in 2018 on Women in the Church.  The conference had been held for the previous four years at the Vatican.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/vatican-rejects-three-women-speakers-voices-faith-conference |title = Vatican rejects three women speakers from Voices of Faith conference|date = 2 February 2018}}</ref>  Irish born Cardinal [[Kevin Farrell]] and Prefect of the [[Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life]] banned McAleese from speaking in the Vatican. The organizers had not been given any reason for the decision.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2018/0202/937865-mcaleese-vatican-conference/ | title=Vatican blocks McAleese from speaking at conference| journal=RTÉ News| date=2 February 2018}}</ref>  In response, conference organisers invited McAleese to deliver the keynote speech at the conference and relocated it to a Jesuit conference centre just outside the Vatican.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43330026 |title = Catholic Church 'an empire of misogyny'|work = BBC News|date = 8 March 2018}}</ref>

McAleese initiated a canonical complaint against [[Kevin Farrell]]. The complaint was made to the Cardinal's superior – [[Pope Francis]]. The [[Nuncio]] to Ireland [[Jude Thaddeus Okolo]] personally collected the complaint from McAleese's home and delivered it to the Vatican.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.rte.ie/radio/radioplayer/html5/#/radio1/21415854 | title=RTÉ Radio Player}}</ref>  According to McAleese, she was advised that there was a process for handling such complaints. In November 2019 she said that she had received neither an acknowledgement or reply to her complaint.<ref name="thejournal.ie">{{Cite web | url=https://www.thejournal.ie/mcaleese-canonical-complaint-pope-4188566-Aug2018/ |title = Mary McAleese: 'World Meeting of Families is essentially a right wing rally'}}</ref>

=== Synod of Bishops on the Family ===
Speaking before the opening of the [[Fourteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops|Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family]] in October 2015, McAleese ridiculed the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow ([[LGBT]]) Catholics on the eve of the Vatican's Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: "In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican's lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child's nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world." Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as "cynical" about the outcome of the forthcoming three-week consultation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/mcaleese-church-stance-on-homosexuality-simply-wrong-1.2378042|title=McAleese: Church stance on homosexuality simply wrong|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== US Grand Jury Report Pennsylvania ===
On 18 August 2018, McAleese speaking in the aftermath of the US Grand Jury Report on children abused by Roman Catholic Priests in Pennsylvania said the cover up of this abuse "is not only systemic, it was directed from central command and control which is the Vatican…It strikes me as impossible to believe that all bishops acted equally negligently by coincidence, that's the problem."<ref name="ReferenceB">{{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/mary-mcaleese-slams-world-meeting-of-families-as-right-wing-rally-to-fight-against-lgbt-and-womens-rights-37228707.html |title = Mary McAleese slams World Meeting of Families as 'right wing rally' to fight against LGBT and women's rights}}</ref>

=== World Meeting of Families 2018 ===
McAleese said in relation to the [[World Meeting of Families]] (held in Dublin in 2018):  ""It's always been essentially a right wing rally... and it was designed for that purpose, to rally people to get them motivated to fight against the tide of same sex marriage, rights for gays, abortion rights, contraceptive rights".<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

=== Alfons Auer Ethics Award ===
On 23 August 2019, McAleese was announced as the winner of the Alfons Auer Ethics Award, from [[Tübingen University]] in Germany for her political dedication in building bridges across divisions in society especially in the conflict in Northern Ireland, her commitment to reforming the Catholic Church after the sexual abuse scandals, her theological and ethical advocacy for the rights of children, for the complete equality of women in church ministries and for the acceptance of diversity.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/katholisch-theologische-fakultaet/fakultaet/auer-preis/die-preistraeger/2019-mary-mcaleese/ | title=2019: Mary McAleese &#124; Universität Tübingen}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/11995/mary-mcaleese-wins-prestigious-catholic-theology-award- |title = Mary McAleese wins prestigious Catholic theology award}}</ref>

=== UN Convention on Rights of the Child ===
On 5 November 2019, McAleese delivered the annual [[Edmund Burke]] lecture at [[Trinity College Dublin]].  McAleese's lecture was entitled "The Future of Ireland: Human Rights and Children's Rights".  In her address McAleese called for "a clear acknowledgment from the Catholic Church that the canon laws which constrict children's rights have now been overtaken by the (UN) Convention and our Constitution"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/mary-mcaleese-brexit-has-produced-an-enraged-not-engaged-society-1.4073595 |title = Mary McAleese: Brexit has produced an 'enraged, not engaged society'}}</ref>

===Threat to leave Church ===

McAleese has written to Pope Francis threatening to quit the Catholic Church if it comes to light the Vatican "failed to act to protect members of the L'Arche community" from the organization's founder Jean Vanier. He founded L'Arche in 1964 to work with the intellectually disabled. On 22 February L'Arche announcing that after receiving credible complaints that Vanier had sexually abused at least six women.<ref>[https://cruxnow.com/church-in-uk-and-ireland/2020/03/former-irish-president-threatens-to-quit-catholic-church-over-vanier-revelations/]</ref>

==LGBT Advocacy==

===Background===

In 1975, McAleese and [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]] founded the [[Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform]].  McAleese was its legal advisor from 1975 until 1979 when she joined [[RTÉ]] as a current affairs journalist.

In a 2008 biography McAleese explained that she first became aware of the plight of gay people as a student in San Francisco in the early 1970s.  She was 21 and studying law at [[Queen's University Belfast]]. Her job involved preparing food for airlines; a supervisor, "a charming, lovely man", told her he was gay. They had become friends. He was wounded at being rejected by his family.  She recalled ""at school or university I was never aware of ever meeting a gay person, such were the taboos at the time. As a heterosexual I had wondered what it must be like for those who are outside the mainstream, the self-discovery, when you can reveal it to no one."  That man was her introduction to the reality. "When I came back to Ireland I made it my business to do something about it," she said.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/mary-mcaleese-a-long-time-advocate-for-gay-people-1.1651114 |title = Mary McAleese: A long-time advocate for gay people}}</ref>

===During Presidency===

In 2008, McAleese addressed a gay youth forum in Galway and encouraged people to confront those who make anti-gay remarks.  McAleese said that being gay was "not a choice but a discovery".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/confront-those-who-make-anti-gay-remarks-president-tells-youth-forum-1.903278 |title = Confront those who make anti-gay remarks, President tells youth forum}}</ref>

In 2010, McAleese addressed the LGBT Diversity National Conference in Dublin.  She said "The toxic attitudes which were heard in homes, streets, workplaces even in schools and churches caused untold suffering and nothing is surer than the fact that those attitudes can have and will have no place in the Ireland we are building, for they belong in the same toxic waste dump along with sexism, racism, sectarianism and all those other contrary forces which would diminish the innate dignity, freedom and nature of the human person, reduce their life chances and opportunities and consign them to half-lived lives.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.president.ie/en/media-library/speeches/remarks-by-president-mcaleese-at-the-lgbt-diversitys-national-conference-fo | title=Media Library &#124; Speeches &#124; President of Ireland}}</ref>

In 2010, McAleese signed the Civil Partnership Act 2010 into law.  The Act allowed, for the first time in Irish law, same-sex couples to enter into civil partnerships.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thejournal.ie/civil-partnership-bill-signed-into-law-2298-Jul2010/ | title=Civil Partnership Bill signed into Law}}</ref>

In 2011, McAleese declined an invitation to be the New York City St Patrick's Day parade Grand Marshall.  LGBT people were banned from marching in the parade under LGBT banners.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.irishcentral.com/news/mcaleese-declines-nyc-grand-marshal-invite-103514544-237717601 | title=President Mary McAleese declines St. Patrick's Day NYC Grand Marshal invite| date=22 September 2010}}</ref>

===Male suicide===

In a radio interview discussing her book ''Quo Vadis? Collegiality in the Code of Canon Law'' on 28 September 2012, said she was concerned at the growing number of young men, and in particular young gay men, who take their own lives in Ireland. She said that when the research is broken down, it shows that young gay men are one of the most risk-prone groups in Ireland. McAleese said many of these young men will have gone to Catholic schools and they will have heard there their church's attitude to homosexuality. "They will have heard words like 'disorder', they may even have heard the word 'evil' used in relation to homosexual practice," she said. She went on to say "And when they make the discovery, and it is a discovery and not a decision, when they make the discovery, that they are gay, when they are 14, 15 or 16, an internal conflict of absolutely appalling proportions opens up". She said many young gay men are driven into a place that is "dark and bleak". McAleese said she met the Apostolic Nuncio, [[Archbishop]] [[Charles John Brown]], shortly after Easter to raise with him her concern about the growing number of suicides among young men in Ireland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0928/mary-mcaleese-catholic-church-homosexuality.html|title=McAleese critical of Catholic view on homosexuals|date=2012-09-28|work=RTÉ.ie|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en}}</ref>

===Marriage Equality Referendum===

In May 2015, in advanced of the [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015|marriage equality referendum]], McAleese described same-sex marriage as a "human rights issue" as she and her husband Martin called for a Yes vote in the upcoming referendum. In her first public comments on the issue, McAleese said the vote next month is "about Ireland's children, gay children" and said passing the referendum would help dismantle the "architecture of homophobia". She also highlighted the problems in Ireland of suicide among young males. "We now know from the evidence that one of the risk groups within that age cohort of 15–25 is the young male homosexual. We owe those children a huge debt as adults who have opportunities to make choices that impact their lives, to make the right choices, choices that will allow their lives grow organically and to give them the joy of being full citizens in their own country."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/mary-mcaleese-calls-for-yes-vote-in-marriage-referendum-1.2174316|title=Mary McAleese calls for Yes vote in marriage referendum|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Dublin Pride===

In June 2018, McAleese attended Dublin Pride for the first time along with her husband, son Justin and his husband Fionán Donohoe.  This theme was 'We Are Family', and was a reference to Pope Francis' 2018 visit to Ireland for the Catholic World Meeting of Families. Speaking at the parade she said: "Homophobia is evil. It ruins people's lives, it has ruined families' lives, it has caused people to commit suicide, it has caused people to live in dark shadows, so unsure of themselves," she said.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44670362 |title = McAleese and son march in Dublin Pride|work = BBC News|date = 30 June 2018}}</ref>

===LGBT Recognition===

In 2011, McAleese received the GALA Political Figure Award.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.galas.ie/winners-2011?lightbox=dataItem-j66o2na4 |title = Winners 2011}}</ref> In 2016, McAleese received the "Ally of the year" award from GALA's.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://gcn.ie/33854/ |title = The GALAs 2016: The Complete Winners List • GCN|date = March 2016}}</ref>

In 2016, McAleese received The Northern Ireland Tolerantia Award for "her commitment to equal treatment and the dignity of LGB&T people for over four decades".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://tolerantia-award.eu/en/the-award-winners-of-europeans-tolerantia-price-2006-2009/belfast-2016/ |title = Belfast 2016 – Tolerantia-Award}}</ref>

In August 2018 McAleese was awarded the Vanguard Award at the GAZE LGBT Festival in Dublin.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=https://www.rte.ie/news/dublin/2018/0806/983471-mary-mcaleese-award/ |title = Church's teachings on homosexuality 'evil' - McAleese|journal = RTÉ News|date = 6 August 2018|last1 = Connor|first1 = Dyane}}</ref>

==Brexit==
In June 2016, McAleese urged the British to vote to remain in the [[EU]].  McAleese warned that Britain's departure could result in the return of border controls on the island of Ireland and a cause a "potential drift" in the peace process.  McAleese said the "chances of customs controls being reconstituted are probably greater as they had been eliminated by EU laws, not Anglo-Irish efforts". McAleese challenged claims by [[Boris Johnson]] and [[Michael Gove]] who frequently repeated claims that the position on the island of Ireland would not change.  McAleese said, "I don't know that to be (true) and they do not know that".<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/09/mary-mcaleese-leave-vote-border-controls-eu-referendum |title = Mary McAleese: Leave vote could bring return of border controls|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 9 June 2016|last1 = O'Carroll|first1 = Lisa|last2 = McDonald|first2 = Henry}}</ref>

In 2017, McAleese described [[Brexit]] as like "pulling a tooth with 10,000 roots". She said that Northern Ireland will be the only part of the UK that will share a land border with an EU state post-Brexit and she feared that checks between [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] would be an inevitable consequence of the UK leaving EU. McAleese said "the lawyer in me says our migration controls are very different, and they are going to be if Britain is no longer part of the EU, and if they tighten the migration controls it won't be enough that I'm entitled to use the Common Travel Area…how are they going to differentiate between me, the person who is entitled to plead the Common Travel Areas, and the person say from France or Germany or Poland who's going to cross the road at Newry, or Derry?  My view is that sooner or later the pressure will come to make it an ID card phenomenon…I don't see, in the long run, how we'd get around that".<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-41056371 |title = Border checks are inevitable - McAleese|work = BBC News|date = 25 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="donegaldaily.com">{{Cite web | url=https://www.donegaldaily.com/2017/08/27/brexit-varadkar-confident-of-no-passport-control-at-border-in-response-to-mcaleeses-fears/ | title=Brexit: Varadkar "confident" of no passport control at border in| date=27 August 2017}}</ref>[[Taoiseach]] [[Leo Varadkar]] responded to McAleese's concerns saying "I understand her concerns but it is one area that I am very sure about that's that there won't be a requirement to produce a passport to travel to Northern Ireland".<ref name="donegaldaily.com"/>

On 29 March 2019, McAleese addressed the Brexit Institute at DCU.  She said "The process of Brexit has been like watching a political form of necrotising fasciitis as it has devoured time, effort, good will, patience, reputations, relationships, engendering huge volumes of work, of anxiety and again, no obvious end in sight.  We know that it has rendered the word 'meaningful' completely meaningless.  She said "I am heart sorry to see the UK go, to leave the EU, things will not be the same.  The future experience will not be the one we envisaged. I harboured a hope that somehow, the United Kingdom would step back from the brink and recommit to the ideal of the European Union, in my view the greatest and the noblest political undertaking ever envisaged and realised in human history.  That's a description that is unlikely to ever be attached to Brexit."<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.dcu.ie/news/news/2019/Mar/Mary-McAleese-addresses-DCU-Brexit-Institute.shtml |title = Mary McAleese addresses DCU Brexit Institute &#124; DCU}}</ref>
