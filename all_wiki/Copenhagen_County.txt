'''Københavns Amt''' ({{Lang-en|Copenhagen County}}) is a former [[county]] (Danish, ''[[Amt (subnational entity)|amt]]'') on the [[island]] of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] (''Sjælland'') in eastern [[Denmark]].  It covered the municipalities in the metropolitan Copenhagen area, with the exception of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksberg]]. Effective January 1, 2007, the county was abolished and merged into [[Region Hovedstaden]] (i.e. ''Copenhagen Capital Region'').

The county was seated in [[Glostrup]] (from 1 January 1993; between 1952 and 1992 the county administration was located on [[Blegdamsvej]] in [[Copenhagen Municipality]], which was surrounded by, but not part of the county).
