=== 1970–1980 ===

====''Rolling Stone''====
When Leibovitz returned to the United States in 1970, she started her career as staff photographer for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. In 1973, publisher [[Jann Wenner]] named Leibovitz chief photographer of ''Rolling Stone'', a job she would hold for 10 years. Leibovitz worked for the magazine until 1983, and her intimate photographs of celebrities helped define the ''Rolling Stone'' look.<ref name="bookrags" />

While working for ''Rolling Stone'', Leibovitz learned that she could work for magazines and still create personal work of her family, which for her was the most important: "You don't get the opportunity to do this kind of intimate work except with the people you love, the people who will put up with you. They’re the people who open their hearts and souls and lives to you. You must take care of them."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/06/arts/design/06leib.html|title=From Annie Leibovitz: Life, and Death, Examined|last=Scott|first=Janny|date=2006-10-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

====The Rolling Stones====

Leibovitz photographed [[the Rolling Stones]] in San Francisco in 1971 and 1972, and served as the concert-tour photographer for [[the Rolling Stones' Tour of the Americas '75]]. Her favorite photo from the tour was a photo of [[Mick Jagger]] in an elevator.<ref>Leibovitz, A. (2008).''At Work''. New York City, NY: Random House. {{ISBN|978-0-375-50510-2}}</ref>

====John Lennon====
[[File:Annie Leibovitz Lennon Ono December 1980.jpg|thumb|Annie Leibovitz's portrait of [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] a few hours before [[Death of John Lennon|Lennon's murder]].]]

On December 8, 1980, Leibovitz had a photo shoot with [[John Lennon]] for ''Rolling Stone'', and she promised him he would make the cover. She had initially tried to get a picture with just Lennon alone, as ''Rolling Stone'' wanted, but Lennon insisted that both he and [[Yoko Ono]] be on the cover. Leibovitz then tried to re-create something like the kissing scene from the couple's ''[[Double Fantasy]]'' [[1980 in music|1980]] album cover, a picture Leibovitz loved. She had John remove his clothes and curl up next to Yoko on the floor. Leibovitz recalls, {{Quote|What is interesting is she said she'd take her top off and I said, "Leave everything on"—‌not really preconceiving the picture at all. Then he curled up next to her and it was very, very strong. You couldn't help but feel that he was cold and he looked like he was clinging on to her. I think it was amazing to look at the first Polaroid and they were both very excited. John said, "You've captured our relationship exactly. Promise me it'll be on the cover." I looked him in the eye and we shook on it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}}}

Leibovitz was the last person to professionally photograph Lennon‍—‌he was [[Death of John Lennon|shot and killed]] five hours later. A month or so later, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine gave grieving music fans his "last image".

The photograph was subsequently re-created in 2009 by John and Yoko's son [[Sean Lennon]] posing with his girlfriend [[Kemp Muhl|Charlotte Kemp Muhl]], with male/female roles reversed (Sean clothed, Kemp naked),{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}} and by [[Henry Bond]] and [[Sam Taylor-Wood]] in their [[YBA]] pastiche [[October 26, 1993]].

=== 1980–2000 ===
Leibovitz's new style of lighting and use of bold colors and poses got her a position with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine in 1983.<ref>{{cite web |author=T., Edward |date=2014|url=http://ilovehatephoto.com/2014/09/18/how-to-shoot-like-annie-leibovitz-part-1-the-look/ |title=How to Shoot like Annie Leibovitz: Part 1 |website= iLHP|access-date= March 28, 2014}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Annie Leibovitz|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/contributor/annie-leibovitz|last=Magazine|first=Vanity Fair|website=Vanity Fair|language=en|access-date=2020-05-23}}</ref>

Leibovitz photographed celebrities for an international advertising campaign for [[American Express]] [[charge card]]s, which won a [[Clio Awards|Clio award]] in 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lensmagazine.net/annie-leibovitz/|title=ANNIE LEIBOVITZ – Lens Magazine|website=lensmagazine.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref>

In 1991, Leibovitz mounted an exhibition at the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]]. She was the second living portraitist and first woman to show there.<ref name="Life Through a Lens">{{cite video|title=Annie Leibovitz - Life Through a Lens|date=August 9, 2008|people=Yoko Ono|publisher=ICA|quote=a heavy weight fate was waiting for us only...four or five hours later|medium=DVD}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Annie Leibovitz {{!}} artnet|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/annie-leibovitz/|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2020-05-23}}</ref> That same year, Leibovitz was also made Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.<ref name="Life Through a Lens" /> Also in 1991, Leibovitz emulated [[Margaret Bourke-White]]'s feat by mounting one of the eagle [[gargoyles]] on the 61st floor of the [[Chrysler Building]] in [[Manhattan]], where she photographed the dancer David Parsons cavorting on another [[eagle]] gargoyle. Noted ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' photographer and picture editor [[John Loengard]] made a gripping photo of Leibovitz at the climax of her danger (Loengard was photographing Leibovitz for ''[[The New York Times]]'' that day).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/gaga-over-a-gargoyle-15902894/|title=Gaga Over a Gargoyle|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en}}</ref>

In 1998, Annie began to work regularly for [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'']].<ref name=":0" />

=== 2000–present ===

==== Brooklyn Museum retrospective ====
In 2007, a major [[retrospective]] of Leibovitz's work was held at the [[Brooklyn Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Annie Leibovitz: Oct. 2006 – Jan. 2007|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/annie_leibovitz/|date=2007|website=Brooklyn Museum}}</ref> The retrospective was based on her book, ''Annie Leibovitz: A Photographer's Life, 1990–2005'' and included many of her professional (celebrity) photographs and numerous personal photographs of her family, children, and partner [[Susan Sontag]]. This show, which was expanded to include three official portraits of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], then went on the road for seven stops. It was on display at the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], from October 2007 to January 2008 and at the [[California Palace of the Legion of Honor|Palace of the Legion of Honor]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] from March 2008 to May 2008. In February 2009, the exhibition was moved to [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|title=From 21 February to 24 May 2009 at the|url=http://www.co-berlin.info/co-neu/web/Formate/Exhibitions/ex_2009/ex_2009_01_Annie_Leibovitz/start_en.php|website=C/O Gallerie|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309095535/http://www.co-berlin.info/co-neu/web/Formate/Exhibitions/ex_2009/ex_2009_01_Annie_Leibovitz/start_en.php|archive-date=9 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=January 21 2009 - Bing|url=http://www.bing.com/search?q=January+21+2009&FORM=QSRE4|website=www.bing.com}}</ref> The show included 200 photographs.<ref>{{cite news|author=Taknuri, Lubna|date=October 21, 2007|title=Leibovitz exhibition|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> This exhibition and her talk focused on her personal photographs and life.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Brooklyn Museum|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/annie_leibovitz/|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref>

==== Queen Elizabeth controversy ====
In 2007, the [[BBC]] misrepresented Leibovitz's portrait shooting of Queen Elizabeth II to take the Queen's official picture for her [[List of state visits made by Queen Elizabeth II|state visit]] to [[Virginia]]. This was filmed for the [[BBC]] documentary ''[[A Year with the Queen]]''. A promotional trailer for the film showed the Queen reacting angrily to Leibovitz's suggestion ("less dressy") that she remove her [[tiara]], then a scene of the Queen walking down a corridor, telling an aide "I'm not changing anything. I've had enough dressing like this, thank you very much."<ref>{{cite news|date=July 12, 2007|title=BBC sorry for misrepresenting Queen|work=ABC News|agency=Reuters|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/12/1977378.htm|url-status=live|access-date=July 19, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718104148/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/12/1977378.htm|archive-date=18 July 2007}}</ref> The BBC later apologized and admitted that the sequence of events had been misrepresented, as the Queen was in fact walking to the sitting in the second scene.<ref>{{cite news|date=July 12, 2007|title=Broadcaster sorry for queen claim|work=CNN|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/07/12/britain.queen/index.html|url-status=live|access-date=July 19, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713043414/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/07/12/britain.queen/index.html|archive-date=July 13, 2007}}</ref> This led to a BBC scandal and a shake-up of ethics training. However a 2015 ''[[London Times]]'' article contradicts this story. It stated that the Queen was both incredulous at being asked to remove her crown as "no-one tells her what to do" and insulted as the item was only a [[tiara]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Ingrid Seward|date=1 September 2015|title=Life:Divorce, Kate and her 'cross' face: the Queen in her own words|work=The Times|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/article4532168.ece|access-date=1 September 2015}}</ref>

==== Miley Cyrus photoshoot controversy ====
On April 25, 2008, ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' reported that 15-year-old [[Miley Cyrus]] had posed topless for a photo shoot with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.<ref name="Vanity Fair June 2008">{{cite news|date=June 2008|title=Miley Knows Best|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/06/miley200806}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=April 28, 2008|title=Miley Cyrus topless controversy|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23608789-5001026,00.html|url-status=dead|access-date=April 27, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501145339/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0%2C22049%2C23608789-5001026%2C00.html|archive-date=1 May 2008}}</ref> The photograph and subsequently released behind-the-scenes photographs show Cyrus topless, her bare back exposed but her front covered with a bedsheet.

I never intended for any of this to happen and I apologize to my fans who I care so deeply about."<ref name="NYT VF" /> Leibovitz also released a statement saying: "I'm sorry that my portrait of Miley has been misinterpreted.... The photograph is a simple, classic portrait, shot with very little makeup, and I think it is very beautiful."<ref name="NYT VF" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Annie Leibovitz: 'Miley Cyrus Photos Were Misinterpreted'|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Annie_Leibovitz_Miley_Cyrus_Photos_Were_Misinterpreted/5226536|date=April 28, 2008|publisher=Hollywood.com|access-date=January 26, 2011}}</ref>

Her first, [[Sarah Cameron Leibovitz]] was born in October 2001 when Leibovitz was 52 years old.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jillstanek.com/pop-culture/annie-leibovitz.html|title=Annie Leibovitz|work=JillStanek.com|access-date=2013-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120103318/http://www.jillstanek.com/pop-culture/annie-leibovitz.html|archive-date=2013-01-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> Twin girls Susan and Samuelle were born to a [[surrogate mother]] in May 2005.<ref name=sfgate/>

===Relationships===

Leibovitz had a close relationship with writer and essayist [[Susan Sontag]] from 1989 until Sontag's death in 2004. During Sontag's lifetime, neither woman publicly disclosed whether the relationship was a platonic friendship or romantic. In 2006, ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine made reference to Leibovitz's decade-plus relationship with Sontag, stating, "The two first met in the late '80s, when Leibovitz photographed her for a book jacket. They never lived together, though they each had an apartment within view of the other's."<ref>{{cite news|author=Cathleen McGuigan |title=Through Her Lens |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14964292/site/newsweek |work=Newsweek |date=October 2, 2006 |access-date=July 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829133058/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14964292/site/newsweek/ |archive-date=August 29, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> When Leibovitz was interviewed for her autobiography ''A Photographer's Life: 1990{{ndash}}2005'', she said that the book told a number of stories, and "with Susan, it was a love story."<ref>{{cite news | author=Janny Scott | title=From Annie Leibovitz: Life, and Death, Examined | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/06/arts/design/06leib.html?pagewanted=3&_r=1 | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 6, 2006 | access-date=July 19, 2007}}</ref> While ''The New York Times'' in 2009 referred to Sontag as Leibovitz's "companion",<ref name=nyt-july2009 /> Leibovitz wrote in ''A Photographer's Life'': "words like 'companion' and 'partner' were not in our vocabulary.

===Religion===

When asked if being Jewish is important to her, Leibovitz replied, "I'm not a practicing Jew, but I feel very Jewish."<ref name=independent />

===Financial troubles===

In February 2009, Leibovitz borrowed {{US$|15.5{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}}, after having experienced financial challenges,<ref name="pawnshop">{{cite news | author = Allen Salkin | title=That Old Master?

The Greenwich Village properties, at 755{{ndash}}757 Greenwich Street, are part of the [[Greenwich Village|Greenwich Village Historic District]], and thus the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] must review and approve any work done to the buildings. However, work initiated on the buildings in October 2002, without a permit, began a chain of destruction of those buildings and the neighbor's at 311 W 11th Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/leibovitz/leibovitztimeline.htm |title=Timeline of Damage to Leibovitz Properties |publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation |access-date=September 19, 2014}}</ref> Due to pressure from the [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]] and other groups, the buildings were finally stabilized, though the preservation group criticized the eventual repairs as shoddy and historically insensitive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gvshp.org/leibovitzdevonshire2_05.html |title=Letters from GVSHP to LPC |publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation |access-date=September 19, 2014}}</ref>
