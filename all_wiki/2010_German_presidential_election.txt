== Results ==
After the first two ballots, Christian Wulff led vote totals but could not win an [[absolute majority]] of 623 votes. It was notable that 45 delegates belonging to the governing coalition either voted for Gauck or abstained altogether during the first round. Thus, the vote went to a decisive third round, where only a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes was required to win. The election is the third to require three ballots since the current system was introduced in 1949.<ref>{{cite news|title=Merkel candidate Wulff wins presidency on third attempt|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/10470309.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=30 June 2010 | date=30 June 2010}}</ref>
