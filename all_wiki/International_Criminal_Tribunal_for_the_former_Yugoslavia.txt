The '''International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia''' ('''ICTY''')<ref>Officially  '''International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991'''</ref> was a body of the [[United Nations]] established to prosecute serious [[crime]]s committed during the [[Yugoslav Wars]], and to try their perpetrators. The tribunal was an ad hoc court located in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]].

The Court was established by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 827|Resolution 827]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]], which was passed on 25 May 1993. It had jurisdiction over four clusters of crimes committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991: grave breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]], violations of the [[laws or customs of war]], [[genocide]], and [[crimes against humanity]]. The maximum sentence it could impose was [[life imprisonment]]. Various countries signed agreements with the UN to carry out custodial sentences.

A total of 161 persons were indicted; the final indictments were issued in December 2004, the last of which were confirmed and unsealed in the spring of 2005.<ref name="OTP history">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/95|title=History of the office of the prosecutor}}</ref> The final fugitive, [[Goran Hadžić]], was arrested on 20 July 2011.<ref name="aljaz">[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/07/201172074249705610.html Serbia's last war crimes fugitive arrested], Al Jazeera.net, 20 July 2011.</ref> The final judgment was issued on 29 November 2017<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.icty.org/en/press/the-icty-renders-its-final-judgement-in-the-prli%C4%87-et-al-appeal-case|title= The ICTY renders its final judgement in the Prlić et al. appeal case |website= International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia|date= 29 November 2017|access-date=29 November 2017}}</ref> and the institution formally ceased to exist on 31 December 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.icty.org/en/press/icty-president-agius-delivers-final-address-to-united-nations-general-assembly|title= ICTY President Agius delivers final address to United Nations General Assembly |website= International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia|access-date= 29 November 2017}}</ref>

Residual functions of the ICTY, including oversight of sentences and consideration of any appeal proceedings initiated since 1 July 2013, are under the jurisdiction of a successor body, the [[International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals]] (IRMCT).<ref name="UNSC Resolution 1966">{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/file/About/Reports%20and%20Publications/ResidualMechanism/101222_sc_res1966_residualmechanism_en.pdf|title=UNSC Resolution 1966}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Creation ===
[[File:UN Secretary-General Report S25704.pdf|thumb|right|Report S/25704 of the UN Secretary-General, including the proposed Statute of the International Tribunal, approved by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 827|UN Security Council Resolution 827]]]]
[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 808]] of 22 February 1993 decided that "an international tribunal shall be established for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of [[international humanitarian law]] committed in the territory of the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] since 1991", and calling on the Secretary-General to "submit for consideration by the Council ... a report on all aspects of this matter, including specific proposals and where appropriate options ... taking into account suggestions put forward in this regard by Member States".<ref>{{Cite web| last = United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees| title = Report of the Secretary-General Pursuant to Paragraph 2 of Security Council Resolution 808 (1993) [Contains text of the Statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991]| work = Refworld| accessdate = 2018-03-17| date = 1993-05-03| url = http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6af0110.html}}</ref>

The Court was originally proposed by German Foreign Minister [[Klaus Kinkel]].<ref>Hazan, Pierre. 2004. ''Justice in a Time of War: The True Story Behind the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.'' College Station: Texas A & M University Press<!-- ISBN/ISSN, page(s) needed --></ref> By 25 May 1993, the international community had tried to pressure the leaders of the former Yugoslavian republics diplomatically, militarily, politically, economically, and – with Resolution 827 – through juridical means. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 827|Resolution 827]] of 25 May 1993 approved [http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Statute/statute_re808_1993_en.pdf S/25704 report] of the Secretary-General and adopted the Statute of the International Tribunal annexed to it, formally creating the ICTY. It would have jurisdiction over four clusters of crime committed on the territory of the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] since 1991: grave breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]], violations of the [[laws or customs of war]], [[genocide]], and [[crime against humanity]]. The maximum sentence it could impose was [[life imprisonment]].

=== Implementation ===
In 1993, the ICTY built its internal infrastructure. 17 states have signed an agreement with the ICTY to carry out custodial sentences.<ref name="Enforcement of Sentences">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/10276|title=Enforcement of Sentences|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref>

1993–1994: In the first year of its existence, the Tribunal laid the foundations for its existence as a judicial organ. The Tribunal established the legal framework for its operations by adopting the rules of procedure and evidence, as well as its rules of detention and directive for the assignment of defense counsel. Together these rules established a legal aid system for the Tribunal. As the ICTY is part of the United Nations and as it was the first ''international'' court for ''criminal'' justice, the development of a juridical infrastructure was considered quite a challenge. However after the first year the first ICTY judges had drafted and adopted all the rules for court proceedings.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Rachel S. Taylor| title = Tribunal Law Made Simple: What is the ICTY, How Was It Established, and What Types of Cases Can it Hear?| work = Global Policy Forum| accessdate = 2018-03-17| url = https://www.globalpolicy.org/home/163-general/29333.html}}</ref>

1994–1995: The ICTY established its offices within the Aegon Insurance Building in The Hague (which was, at the time, still partially in use by Aegon)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vohrah|first=L.C.|title=Some Insights into the Early Years|journal=Journal of International Criminal Justice|year=2004|volume=2|issue=2|page=388|doi=10.1093/jicj2.2.388}}</ref> and detention facilities in Scheveningen in The Hague (the Netherlands). The ICTY hired now many staff members. By July 1994 there were sufficient staff members in the office of the prosecutor to begin field investigations and by November 1994 the first indictment was presented and confirmed. In 1995, the entire staff numbered more than 200 persons and came from all over the world. Moreover, some governments assigned their legally trained people to the ICTY.

=== Operation ===
[[File:ICTY.JPG|thumb|The Tribunal building in The Hague|250px]]
In 1994 the first indictment was issued against the Bosnian-Serb concentration camp commander Dragan Nikolić. This was followed on 13 February 1995 by two indictments comprising 21 individuals which were issued against a group of 21 Bosnian-Serbs charged with committing atrocities against Muslim and Croat civilian prisoners. While the war in the former Yugoslavia was still raging, the ICTY prosecutors showed that an international court was viable. However, no accused was arrested.<ref>Pronk, E. ''The ICTY and the people from the former Yugoslavia – a reserved relationship.''<!-- publisher, ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --></ref>

The court confirmed eight indictments against 46 individuals and issued arrest warrants. Bosnian Serb indictee [[Duško Tadić]] became the subject of the Tribunal's first trial. Tadić was arrested by German police in [[Munich]] in 1994 for his alleged actions in the Prijedor region in Bosnia-Herzegovina (especially his actions in the Omarska, Trnopolje and Keraterm detention camps). He made his first appearance before the ICTY Trial Chamber on 26 April 1995, and pleaded not guilty to all of the charges in the indictment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://m.sfgate.com/news/article/First-Defendant-Faces-Tribunal-On-War-Crimes-3035180.php|title=First Defendant Faces Tribunal on War Crimes / Bosnian Serb pleads not guilty|work=SFGate|access-date=2018-02-26}}</ref>

1995–1996: Between June 1995 and June 1996, 10 public indictments had been confirmed against a total of 33 individuals. Six of the newly indicted persons were transferred in the Tribunal's detention unit. In addition to Duško Tadic, by June 1996 the tribunal had [[Tihomir Blaškić]], [[Dražen Erdemović]], [http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=6112 Zejnil Delalić], [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mucic/cis/en/cis_mucic_al_en.pdf Zdravko Mucić], [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mucic/cis/en/cis_mucic_al_en.pdf Esad Landžo] and [[Hazim Delić]] in custody. Erdemović became the first person to enter a guilty plea before the tribunal's court. Between 1995 and 1996, the ICTY dealt with miscellaneous cases involving several detainees, which never reached the trial stage.

=== Accomplishments ===
In 2004, the ICTY published a list of five accomplishments "in justice and law":<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/file/Outreach/view_from_hague/jit_accomplishments_en.pdf|title='The Tribunal's Accomplishments in Justice and Law'|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/glance-e/index.htm|title=ICTY at a glance|publisher=United Nations|date=5 March 2007|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref>

# "Spearheading the shift from impunity to accountability", pointing out that, until very recently, it was the only court judging crimes committed as part of the Yugoslav conflict, since prosecutors in the former Yugoslavia were, as a rule, reluctant to prosecute such crimes;
# "Establishing the facts", highlighting the extensive evidence-gathering and lengthy findings of fact that Tribunal judgments produced;
# "Bringing justice to thousands of victims and giving them a voice", pointing out the large number of witnesses that had been brought before the Tribunal;
# "The accomplishments in international law", describing the fleshing out of several international criminal law concepts which had not been ruled on since the Nuremberg Trials;
# "Strengthening the Rule of Law", referring to the Tribunal's role in promoting the use of international standards in war crimes prosecutions by former Yugoslav republics.

=== Closure ===
The United Nations Security Council passed resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1503|1503]] in August 2003 and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1534|1534]] in March 2004, which both called for the completion of all cases at both the ICTY and its sister tribunal, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) by 2010.

In December 2010, the Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1966|Resolution 1966]], which established the [[International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals]] (IRMCT), a body intended to gradually assume residual functions from both the ICTY and the ICTR as they wound down their mandate. Resolution 1966 called upon the Tribunal to finish its work by 31 December 2014 to prepare for its closure and the transfer of its responsibilities.<ref name="UNSC Resolution 1966" />

In a ''Completion Strategy Report'' issued in May 2011, the ICTY indicated that it aimed to complete all trials by the end of 2012 and complete all appeals by 2015, with the exception of [[Radovan Karadžić]] whose trial was expected to end in 2014 and [[Ratko Mladić]] and [[Goran Hadžić]], who were still at large at that time and were not arrested until later that year.<ref name="ICTY Completion Strategy Report">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/file/About/Reports%20and%20Publications/CompletionStrategy/completion_strategy_18may2011_en.pdf|title=ICTY Completion Strategy Report|date=18 May 2011}}</ref>

The IRMCT's ICTY branch began functioning on 1 July 2013. Per the Transitional Arrangements adopted by the UN Security Council, the ICTY was to conduct and complete all outstanding first instance trials, including those of Karadžić, Mladić and Hadžić. The ICTY would also conduct and complete all appeal proceedings for which the notice of appeal against the judgement or sentence was filed before 1 July 2013. The IRMCT will handle any appeals for which notice is filed after that date.

The final ICTY trial to be completed in the first instance was that of [[Ratko Mladić]], who was convicted on 22 November 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/22/ratko-mladic-convicted-of-genocide-and-war-crimes-at-un-tribunal|title=Ratko Mladic found guilty|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> The final case to be considered by the ICTY was an appeal proceeding encompassing six individuals, whose sentences were upheld on 29 November 2017.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|url=http://www.icty.org/cases/party/766/4|title=Cases – Prlić et al. (IT-04-74)|accessdate=30 March 2017}}</ref>

== Organization ==
While operating, the Tribunal employed around 900 staff.<ref name="Employment section of ICTY website">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/106|title=Employment section of ICTY website|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref> Its organisational components were Chambers, Registry and the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP).
[[File:ICTY 2006-01-16.jpg|thumb|Lateral view of the building.]]

=== Prosecutors ===
The Prosecutor was responsible for investigating crimes, gathering evidence and prosecutions and was head of the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP).<ref>Statute of the International Tribunal, Annex of Report S/25704 of the UN Secretary-General, Article 16(1)</ref> The Prosecutor was appointed by the UN Security Council upon nomination by the UN Secretary-General.<ref>Statute of the International Tribunal, Annex of Report S/25704 of the UN Secretary-General, Article 16(4)</ref>

The last prosecutor was [[Serge Brammertz]]. Previous Prosecutors have been Ramón Escovar Salom of [[Venezuela]] (1993–1994), however, he never took up that office, [[Richard Goldstone]] of [[South Africa]] (1994–1996), [[Louise Arbour]] of [[Canada]] (1996–1999), and [[Carla Del Ponte]] of [[Switzerland]] (1999–2007). Richard Goldstone, Louise Arbour and Carla Del Ponte also simultaneously served as the Prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] until 2003. Graham Blewitt of [[Australia]] served as the Deputy Prosecutor from 1994 until 2004. [[David Tolbert]], the President of the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]], was also appointed Deputy Prosecutor of the ICTY in 2004.<ref name="The Judges' section of ICTY website">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/101|title=The former Prosecutors' section of ICTY website|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref>

=== Chambers ===
Chambers encompassed the [[judge]]s and their aides. The Tribunal operated three Trial Chambers and one Appeals Chamber. The President of the Tribunal was also the presiding Judge of the Appeals Chamber.

==== Judges ====
At the time of the court's dissolution, there were seven permanent judges and one ''ad hoc'' judge who served on the Tribunal.<ref name="Current judges">{{Cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/en/about/chambers/judges |title=The Judges |publisher=ICTY |accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref><ref name="Burton Hall appointment">{{Cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/en/press/judge-burton-hall-appointed-to-the-icty |title=Judge Burton Hall appointed to the ICTY |publisher=ICTY |date=3 October 2016 |accessdate=4 October 2016}}</ref> A total of 86 judges have been appointed to the Tribunal from 52 United Nations member states. Of those judges, 51 were permanent judges, 36 were ''ad litem'' judges, and one was an ''ad hoc'' judge. Note that one judge served as both a permanent and ''ad litem'' judge, and another served as both a permanent and ''ad hoc'' judge.

UN member and observer states could each submit up to two nominees of different nationalities to the UN Secretary-General.<ref name="Updated Statute of the ICTY Article">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Statute/statute_sept09_en.pdf|title=Article 13bis}}</ref> The UN Secretary-General submitted this list to the UN Security Council which selected from 28 to 42 nominees and submitted these nominees to the UN General Assembly.<ref name="Updated Statute of the ICTY Article" /> The UN General Assembly then elected 14 judges from that list.<ref name="Updated Statute of the ICTY Article" /> Judges served for four years and were eligible for re-election. The UN Secretary-General appointed replacements in case of vacancy for the remainder of the term of office concerned.<ref name="Updated Statute of the ICTY Article" />

On 21 October 2015, Judge [[Carmel Agius]] of [[Malta]] was elected President of the ICTY and Liu Daqun of [[China]] was elected Vice-President; they have assumed their positions on 17 November 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/sid/11697 |title=Judge Agius and Judge Liu elected President and Vice-President of the ICTY |publisher=ICTY |date=21 October 2015 |accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref> His predecessors were [[Antonio Cassese]] of [[Italy]] (1993–1997), [[Gabrielle Kirk McDonald]] of the [[United States]] (1997–1999), [[Claude Jorda]] of [[France]] (1999–2002), [[Theodor Meron]] of the [[United States]] (2002–2005), [[Fausto Pocar]] of [[Italy]] (2005–2008), [[Patrick Lipton Robinson|Patrick Robinson]] of [[Jamaica]] (2008–2011), and Theodor Meron (2011–2015).<ref name="Current judges" /><ref name="Former judges">{{Cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/en/sid/10572 |title=Former Judges |publisher=ICTY |accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref>

=== Registry ===
The Registry was responsible for handling the administration of the Tribunal; activities included keeping court records, translating court documents, transporting and accommodating those who appear to testify, operating the Public Information Section, and such general duties as payroll administration, personnel management and procurement. It was also responsible for the Detention Unit for indictees being held during their trial and the Legal Aid program for indictees who cannot pay for their own defence. It was headed by the Registrar, a position occupied over the years by [[Theo van Boven]] of the [[Netherlands]] (February 1994 to December 1994), Dorothée de Sampayo Garrido-Nijgh of the Netherlands (1995–2000), Hans Holthuis of the Netherlands (2001–2009), and [[John Hocking]] of [[Australia]] (May 2009 to December 2017).

=== Detention facilities ===
[[File:ICTY Detention Unit cell.jpg|thumb|A typical 10&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18084974|work=BBC News|title=Profile: Scheveningen prison|date=16 May 2012}}</ref> single cell at the ICTY detention facilities]]
Those defendants on trial and those who were denied a provisional release were detained at the United Nations Detention Unit on the premises of the [[Penitentiary Institution Haaglanden]], location Scheveningen in [[Belgisch Park]], a suburb of [[The Hague]], located some 3&nbsp;km by road from the courthouse. The indicted were housed in private cells which had a toilet, shower, radio, satellite TV, personal computer (without internet access) and other luxuries. They were allowed to phone family and friends daily and could have conjugal visits. There was also a library, a gym and various rooms used for religious observances. The inmates were allowed to cook for themselves. All of the inmates mixed freely and were not segregated on the basis of nationality. As the cells were more akin to a university residence instead of a jail, some had derisively referred to the ICT as the "Hague Hilton".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6891319.ece|work=The Times|location=London, UK|title=Radovan Karadzic cell life|first=Judith|last=Evans|date=26 October 2009|accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref> The reason for this luxury relative to other prisons is that the first president of the court wanted to emphasise that the indictees were innocent until proven guilty.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4801626.stm|work=BBC News|title=Milosevic jail under scrutiny|date=13 March 2006|accessdate=5 May 2010|first=Chris|last=Stephen}}</ref>

== Indictees ==
{{Main|List of people indicted in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia}}
The Tribunal indicted 161 individuals between 1997 and 2004 and completed proceedings with them as follows:<ref name="ICTY website Key Figures">{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/sites/icty.org/files/images/content/Infographic_facts_figures_en.pdf|title=Infographic: ICTY Facts & Figures|date=February 2016|accessdate=27 March 2016|publisher=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia}}</ref><ref name="keyfig">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/en/cases/key-figures-cases|title=Key Figures of ICTY Cases|publisher=ICTY official site|date=November 2017|accessdate=22 November 2017}}</ref>
* 111 had trials completed by the ICTY:
** 21 were acquitted by the ICTY:
*** 18 acquittals have stood;
*** 1 was originally acquitted by the ICTY, but convicted on appeal by the IRMCT of one count (and sentenced to time served) <!-- Šešelj -->
*** 2 were originally acquitted by the ICTY, but following successful appeal by the prosecution the acquittals were overturned and a retrial is being conducted by the IRMCT; and <!-- Simatović & Stanišić -->
** 90 were convicted and sentenced by the ICTY:
*** 87 were transferred to 14 different states where they served their prison sentences, had sentences that amounted to time spent in detention during trial, or died after conviction:
**** 20 remain imprisoned;
**** 58 completed their sentences;
**** 9 died while completing their sentences or after conviction awaiting transfer
*** 2 were convicted and sentenced, and remain in IRMCT detention awaiting transfer; and
*** 1 was convicted and sentenced, but has filed an appeal to the IRMCT that is being considered <!-- Mladic -->
* 13 had their cases transferred to courts in:
** Bosnia and Herzegovina (10);
** Croatia (2); and
** Serbia (1)
* 37 had their cases terminated prior to trial completion, because
** the indictments were withdrawn (20); or
** the indictees died before or after transfer to the Tribunal (17).

The indictees ranged from common soldiers to generals and police commanders all the way to prime ministers. [[Slobodan Milošević]] was the first sitting head of state indicted for war crimes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asil.org/insights/insigh90.htm|title=ASIL.org |publisher=ASIL.org|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> Other "high level" indictees included [[Milan Babić]], former President of the [[Republika Srpska Krajina]]; [[Ramush Haradinaj]], former [[Prime Minister of Kosovo]]; [[Radovan Karadžić]], former [[List of Presidents of Republika Srpska|President of the Republika Srpska]]; [[Ratko Mladić]], former Commander of the [[Bosnian Serb Army]]; and [[Ante Gotovina]], former General of the [[Croatian Army]].

The very first hearing at the ICTY was referral request in the Tadić case on 8 November 1994. Croat Serb General and former President of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] [[Goran Hadžić]] was the last fugitive wanted by the Tribunal to be arrested on 20 July 2011.<ref name="aljaz" />

An additional 23 individuals have been the subject of [[Contempt of court|contempt proceedings]].<ref name="ICTY website Contempt Cases">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/action/contemptcases/27|title=ICTY website Contempt Cases|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731171532/http://www.icty.org/action/contemptcases/27 |archive-date=31 July 2017}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
Skeptics argued that an international court could not function while the war in the former Yugoslavia was still going on. This would be a huge undertaking for any court, but for the ICTY it would be an even greater one, as the new tribunal still needed judges, a prosecutor, a registrar, investigative and support staff, an extensive interpretation and translation system, a legal aid structure, premises, equipment, courtrooms, detention facilities, guards and all the related funding.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Criticisms of the court include:
* [[Michael Mandel (law professor)|Michael Mandel]], [[William Blum]] and others accused the court of having a pro-NATO bias due to its refusal to prosecute NATO officials and politicians for war crimes.<ref>{{Cite book |title=America’s Deadliest Export: Democracy The Truth About US Foreign Policy and Everything Else |author=William Blum |publisher=Zed Books |page=157-8}}</ref>
* On 6 December 2006, the Tribunal at The Hague approved the use of [[force-feeding]] of [[Serbia]]n politician [[Vojislav Šešelj]]. They decided it was not "torture, [[inhuman or degrading treatment]] if there is a medical necessity to do so... and if the manner in which the detainee is force-fed is not inhuman or degrading".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/yugo/article/0,,1966016,00.html|title=War crimes tribunal orders force-feeding of Serbian warlord|date=7 December 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 September 2007|location=London, UK|first=Ian|last=Traynor}}</ref>
* Reducing the indictment charges after the arrest of [[Ratko Mladić]], Croatian officials publicly condemned chief prosecutor [[Serge Brammertz]] for his announcement that the former Bosnian Serb General, will be tried solely for crimes allegedly committed in Bosnia, not in Croatia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daily.tportal.hr/131532/Kosor-says-will-insist-on-expansion-of-indictment-against-Mladic.html|work=Daily Portal|title=Kosor will insist on expansion of indictment against Mladić|date=3 June 2011|accessdate=4 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/croatia-crimes-won-t-be-included-in-mladic-indictment|title=Croatia Crimes 'Won't Be Included' in Mladić Indictment|publisher=Balkaninsight|date=2 June 2011|accessdate=4 June 2011}}</ref>

* 68% of indictees have been [[Serbs]] (or [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]]),<ref name="failure of international justice" /> to the extent that a sizeable portion of the Bosnian Serb and Croatian Serb political and military leaderships have been indicted. Many have seen this as reflecting bias,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4222749.stm|title=General jailed for Dubrovnik role|work=BBC News|date=31 January 2005|accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref> while the Tribunal's defenders have seen this as indicative of the actual proportion of crimes committed. However, [[Marko Hoare]] claimed that, aside from Milošević, only [[Momčilo Perišić]] (Chief of the General Staff of the [[Yugoslav Army]]), who was acquitted, has been indicted from the Serbian military or political top when it comes to wars in Croatia and Bosnia.<ref name="failure of international justice" />
* According to Hoare, a former employee at the ICTY, an investigative team worked on indictments of senior members of the "joint criminal enterprise", including not only Milošević but also [[Veljko Kadijević]], [[Blagoje Adžić]], [[Borisav Jović]], [[Branko Kostić]], [[Momir Bulatović]] and others. However, Hoare claims that, due to [[Carla del Ponte]]'s intervention, these drafts were rejected, and the indictment limited to Milošević alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2008/01/10/florence-hartmanns-peace-and-punishment|title=Florence Hartmann's 'Peace and Punishment'|last=Hoare|first=Marko|date=10 January 2008|publisher=Wordpress.com|accessdate=9 April 2011}}</ref>
* There have been allegations of censorship: in July 2011, the Appeals Chamber of ICTY confirmed the judgment of the Trial Chamber which found journalist and former Tribunal's OTP spokesperson [[Florence Hartmann]] guilty of contempt of court and fined her €7,000. She disclosed documents of FR Yugoslavia's Supreme Defense Council meetings and criticized the Tribunal for granting confidentiality of some information in them to protect Serbia's 'vital national interests' during [[Bosnian Genocide Case|Bosnia's lawsuit against the country for genocide]] in front of the [[International Court of Justice]]. Hartmann argued that Serbia was freed of the charge of genocide because ICTY redacted certain information in the Council meetings. Since these documents have in the meantime been made public by the ICTY itself, a group of organizations and individuals, who supported her, said that the Tribunal in this appellate proceedings "imposed a form of censorship aimed to protect the international judges from any form of criticism".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/florence-hartmann-case-conviction-and-sentence-upheld-on-appeal.29.html?cat_id=1&news_id=13029|title=FLORENCE HARTMANN CASE: CONVICTION AND SENTENCE UPHELD ON APPEAL|date=19 July 2011|publisher=Sense Agency|accessdate=21 July 2011|location=The Hague}}</ref> (France refused to extradite Hartmann to serve the prison sentence issued against her by the ICTY after she refused to pay the €7,000 fine.)
* [[Klaus-Peter Willsch]] compared the [[Ante Gotovina]] verdict, in which the late Croatian president [[Franjo Tuđman]] was posthumously found to have been participating in a [[Joint Criminal Enterprise]], with the 897 [[Cadaver Synod]] trial in [[Rome]], when [[Pope Stephen VI]] had the corpse of [[Pope Formosus]] exhumed, put on trial and posthumously convicted.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/artikel/C30189/fremde-federn-klaus-peter-willsch-die-leichensynode-von-den-haag-30375259.html|title=Die Leichensynode von Den Haag [The Cadaver Synod at the Hague]|author=Klaus-Peter Willsch|language=German|newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]|date=2 June 2011|accessdate=4 June 2011}}</ref>
* Some sentences have been considered too mild, even within the Tribunal,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/ten-years-in-prison-for-miroslav-deronjic.29.html?cat_id=1&news_id=8520|title=Ten years in prison for Miroslav Deronjić|date=30 March 2004|publisher=Sense Agency|accessdate=8 May 2011|location=The Hague|quote=Judge Schomburg however thinks that the punishment is not proportional to the crime and is not within mandate and spirit of this Tribunal. According to him, the crime to which Deronjić pleaded guilty "deserves a sentence of no less than twenty years of imprisonment". In a brief summary of his dissenting opinion that he read after pronouncing the sentence imposed by the majority, Judge Schomburg criticized the prosecution for having limited Deronjić's responsibility in the indictment to "one day and to the village of [[Glogova, Bratunac|Glogova]]". Schomburg added that the "heinous and long-planned crimes committed by a high-ranking perpetrator do not allow for a sentence of only ten years", which, in light of his possible early release, could mean that the accused would spend only six years and eight months in prison. At the end of his dissenting opinion, Schomburg quoted a statement by one of Deronjić's victims. The victim said that his guilty plea "can heal the wounds" that the Bosniak community in eastern Bosnia still feels "provided that he is punished adequately". According to the victim, "a mild punishment would not serve any purpose.}}</ref> complained at small sentences of convicted war criminals in comparison with their crimes. In 2010, [[Veselin Šljivančanin]]'s sentence for his involvement in the [[Vukovar massacre]] was cut from 17 to 10 years, which caused outrage in Croatia. Upon hearing that news, Vesna Bosanac, who had been in charge of the Vukovar hospital during the fall of the city, said that the "ICTY is dead" for her: "For crimes that he [Šljivančanin], had committed in Vukovar, notably at [[Ovčara massacre|Ovčara]], he should have been jailed for life.

* Some of the defendants, such as [[Slobodan Milošević]], claimed that the Court has no legal authority because it was established by the [[UN Security Council]] instead of the [[UN General Assembly]] and so had not been created on a broad international basis. The Tribunal was established on the basis of [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]]; the relevant portion of which reads "the Security Council can take measures to maintain or restore international peace and security".<ref>For more detail, see an early summary of this argument by Mak, T.: ''[https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/finp20/2/4?nav=tocList|The Case Against an International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]'', (1995) International Peacekeeping, 2:4, 536-563.</ref> The legal criticism has been succinctly stated in a [http://i-p-o.org/yu-tribunal-memo1999.htm memorandum] issued by Austrian Professor [[Hans Köchler]], which was submitted to the President of the Security Council in 1999.

* Dutch filmmaker Jos de Putter made a trilogy, The Milosevic Case - Glosses at Trial, for Tegenlicht investigative slot at the VPRO. The main hypothesis of the film is that ICTY prosecution has been struggling and failing to prove any link between Milosevic and the media version of the truth of the bloody break-up of Yugoslavia. The legitimacy of the prosecution methodology in securing the witness accounts and evidence, in general, has been examined by the filmmaker.
