'''Shanghai''' ({{zh |c = 上海 }}, {{IPA-wuu|zɑ̃̀.hɛ́|[[Shanghainese]] pronunciation:|zh-wuu-2-上海.ogg}}, <small>[[Standard Chinese|Standard Mandarin]] pronunciation:</small> {{IPAc-cmn|AUD|Shanghai pron.ogg|sh|ang|4|.|h|ai|3}}) is one of the four [[Direct-administered municipalities of China|direct-administered municipalities]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. It is under the direct administration of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council of China]]. The city is located on the southern estuary of the [[Yangtze]], with the [[Huangpu River]] flowing through it. With a population of 24.28 million {{as of|2019|lc=y}}, it is the [[List of cities in China by population and built-up area|most populous urban area in China]] and the second [[List of largest cities|most populous city proper]] in the world. Shanghai is a global center for [[Global Financial Centres Index|finance]], research, [[list of technology centers|technology]], [[manufacturing]], and [[Transport in China|transportation]], and the [[Port of Shanghai]] is the [[world's busiest container port]]. 

Originally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five [[treaty ports]] forced open to foreign trade after the [[First Opium War]]. The [[Shanghai International Settlement]] and the [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession]] were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the [[Asia-Pacific]] region in the 1930s. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the city was the site of the major [[Battle of Shanghai]]. After the war, with the [[Chinese Civil War|CPC takeover of mainland China]] in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries and the city's global influence declined.

In the 1990s, [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] introduced by [[Deng Xiaoping]] resulted in an intense redevelopment of the city, especially the [[Pudong]] New Area, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment. The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance; it is the home of the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]], one of the [[List of stock exchanges|largest stock exchanges in the world]] by market capitalization and the [[Shanghai Free-Trade Zone]], the first [[free-trade zone]] in China. As of 2020, Shanghai is classified as an Alpha+ global city by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]]. It has the [[List of cities by number of billionaires|third-highest number of billionaires]] of any city in the world and [[List of universities in China|highly ranked institutions]] including [[Fudan University]], [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]], [[Tongji University]], and [[East China Normal University]].

Shanghai has been described as the "showpiece" of the booming [[economy of China]]. Featuring several architecture styles such as [[Art Deco]] and [[shikumen]], the city is renowned for its [[Lujiazui]] [[List of tallest buildings in Shanghai|skyline]], museums and historic buildings—including the [[City God Temple of Shanghai|City God Temple]], [[Yu Garden]], the [[China Pavilion]] and buildings along [[the Bund]]. Shanghai is also known for its [[Shanghai cuisine|sugary cuisine]], [[Shanghainese|distinctive dialect]] and vibrant international flair. Every year, the city hosts numerous national and international events, including [[Shanghai Fashion Week]], the [[Chinese Grand Prix]], and [[ChinaJoy]]. In 2018, Shanghai hosted the first [[China International Import Expo]] (CIIE), the world's first import-themed national-level expo.{{TOC limit|3}}

==Etymology==
The two [[Chinese character]]s in the city's name are {{zh|c={{linktext|上}} |labels=no}} ({{transl|zh|shàng}}/''zan'', "upon") and {{zh|c={{linktext|海}} |labels=no}} ({{transl|zh|hǎi}}/''hae'', "sea"), together meaning "Upon the Sea". The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century [[Song dynasty]], when there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. How the name should be understood has been disputed, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the [[Tang dynasty]], the area of modern-day Shanghai was under the sea level, so the land appeared to be literally "on the sea".<ref name="Danielson, Eric N. 2004, pp.8-9">Danielson, Eric N., ''Shanghai and the Yangzi Delta'', 2004, pp.&nbsp;8–9.</ref>

===Imperial history===
[[File:%E6%96%B9%E5%A1%942.JPG|thumb|left|[[Songjiang Square Pagoda]], built in the 11th century]]
During the Tang and Song dynasties, Qinglong Town ({{lang|zh-Hans|青龙镇}}{{Efn|{{zh|t=青龍鎮}}|name=|group=}}) in modern [[Qingpu District]] was a major trading port. Established in 746 (the fifth year of the Tang [[Tianbao era]]), it developed into what historically called a "giant town of the Southeast", with thirteen temples and seven pagodas. [[Mi Fu]], a scholar and artist of the Song dynasty, served as its mayor. The port experienced thriving trade with provinces along the [[Yangtze]] and the Chinese coast, as well as with foreign countries such as Japan and [[Silla]].<ref name=kaogu>{{cite web |url = http://www.kaogu.cn/zixun/zixun/shidafaxain/2017/0324/57570.html |script-title=zh:上海青浦青龙镇遗址 |trans-title=Ruins of Qinglong Town in Qingpu, Shanghai |publisher=[[Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] |date=24 March 2017 |access-date=16 July 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170831221826/http://www.kaogu.cn/zixun/zixun/shidafaxain/2017/0324/57570.html |archive-date=31 August 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Two important events helped promote Shanghai's developments in the [[Ming dynasty]]. A [[city wall]] was built for the first time in 1554 to protect the town from raids by [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]]. It measured {{convert|10|m|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|5|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} in circumference.<ref name="Danielson, Eric N. 2004, p.10">Danielson, Eric N., Shanghai and the Yangzi Delta, 2004, p.10.</ref> A [[City God Temple of Shanghai|City God Temple]] was built in 1602 during the [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] reign. This honor was usually reserved for prefectural capitals and not normally given to a mere county seat such as Shanghai. Scholars have theorized that this likely reflected the town's economic importance, as opposed to its low political status.<ref name="Danielson, Eric N. 2004, p.10"/>

During the [[Qing dynasty]], Shanghai became one of the most important sea ports in the [[Yangtze Delta]] region as a result of two important central government policy changes: in 1684, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] reversed the Ming dynasty prohibition on oceangoing vessels—a ban that had been in force since 1525; and in 1732, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] moved the customs office for [[Jiangsu]] province ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|江|海|关}};{{Efn|{{zh|t=江海關}}|name=|group=}} see [[Customs House, Shanghai]]) from the prefectural capital of Songjiang to Shanghai, and gave Shanghai exclusive control over customs collections for Jiangsu's foreign trade. As a result of these two critical decisions, Shanghai became the major trade port for all of the lower Yangtze region by 1735, despite still being at the lowest administrative level in the political hierarchy.<ref>Danielson, Eric N., Shanghai and the Yangtze Delta, 2004, pp.10–11.</ref>

A side-effect of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai was the [[Shanghai Ghetto]]. Japanese consul to [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]], [[Chiune Sugihara]] issued thousands of visas to Jewish refugees who were escaping the Nazi's [[Final Solution to the Jewish Question]]. They traveled from [[Keidan]], Lithuania across Russia by railroad to the [[Vladivostok]] from where they traveled by ship to [[Kobe, Japan]]. However, the Jewish refugees' stay in Kobe was short as the Japanese government transferred them to Shanghai by November 1941. Other Jewish refugees found haven in Shanghai, not through Sugihara, but came on ships from Italy. The refugees from Europe were interned into a cramped ghetto in the Hongkou District,<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/11/shanghais-forgotten-jewish-past/281713/</ref> and after the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor, even the Iraqi Jews who had been living in Shanghai from before the outbreak of WWII were interned. Among the refugees in the Shanghai Ghetto was the [[Mir yeshiva (Belarus)|Mirrer Yeshiva]], including its students and faculty. On 3 September 1945, the Chinese Army liberated the Ghetto and most of the Jews left over the next few years. By 1957, there were only one hundred Jews remaining in Shanghai.

On 27 May 1949, the [[People's Liberation Army]] took control of Shanghai through the [[Shanghai Campaign]]. Under the new People's Republic of China (PRC), Shanghai was one of only three municipalities not merged into neighboring provinces (the others being [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]]).<ref>[http://www.earnshaw.com/shanghai-ed-india/tales/t-monde2.htm ''Changhai est tombé sans combat''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928152915/https://www.earnshaw.com/shanghai-ed-india/tales/t-monde2.htm |date=28 September 2011}}, Le Monde, 27 May 1949.</ref> Most foreign firms moved their offices from Shanghai to [[Hong Kong]], as part of a foreign [[divestment]] due to the PRC's victory.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Thompson |year=1979 |title=China's Nationalization of Foreign Firms: The Politics of Hostage Capitalism, 1949–1957  |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/56353790.pdf |publisher=University of Maryland School of Law |page=16 |isbn=0-942182-26-X |access-date=27 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223100622/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/56353790.pdf |archive-date=23 February 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

This is different from the official Chinese dialect, [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], which is mutually unintelligible with Wu Chinese.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-languages|title=Chinese languages|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220025100/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-languages|archivedate=20 February 2018}}</ref> Modern Shanghainese is based on other dialects of Taihu Wu: [[Suzhou dialect|Suzhounese]], [[Ningbo dialect|Ningbonese]], and the local dialect of Songjiang Prefecture.<ref name="CZMShanghainese">{{cite web|url=http://wu-chinese.com/wu-chinese/SH100years.doc|script-title=zh:上海市区话语音一百多年来的演变|trans-title=Changes in the downtown Shanghainese pronunciations in the past one hundred years|page=1|last=Chen|first=Zhongmin|accessdate=24 October 2019|language=zh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820235310/http://wu-chinese.com/wu-chinese/SH100years.doc|archive-date=20 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Prior to its expansion, the language spoken in Shanghai was subordinate to those spoken around [[Jiaxing]] and later [[Suzhou]],<ref name="CZMShanghainese" /> and was known as "the local tongue" ({{lang|zh-Hans|本地闲话}}), which is now being used in suburbs only.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.shobserver.com/news/detail?id=110722|script-title=zh:“上海闲话”和“本地闲话”为何差别这么大?|work=Shanghai Observer|last=You|first=Rujie|date=16 October 2018|accessdate=25 October 2019}}</ref> In the late 19th century, downtown Shanghainese ({{lang|zh-Hans|上海闲话}}) appeared, undergoing rapid changes and quickly replacing Suzhounese as the [[prestige dialect]] of the [[Yangtze River Delta]] region. At the time, most of the city's residents were immigrants from the two adjacent provinces, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, so Shanghainese was mostly a hybrid between Southern Jiangsu and Ningbo dialects. After 1949, Putonghua has also had a great impact on Shanghainese as a result of being rigorously promoted by the government.<ref name="CZMShanghainese" /> Since the 1990s, many migrants outside of the Wu-speaking region have come to Shanghai for education and jobs. They often cannot speak the local language and therefore use Putonghua as a [[lingua franca]]. Because Putonghua and English were more favored, Shanghainese began to decline, and fluency among young speakers weakened. In recent years, there have been movements within the city to promote the local language and protect it from fading out.<ref>{{cite news|title=Is Shanghai's local dialect, and culture, in crisis?|author=Zat Liu|url=http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/life/shanghaihua-crisis-680262|newspaper=CNN GO|date=20 August 2010|accessdate=5 June 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903072555/http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/life/shanghaihua-crisis-680262|archivedate=3 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Stopping the local dialect becoming derelict|author=Jia Feishang|url=http://www.shanghaidaily.com/feature/art-and-culture/Stopping-the-local-dialect-becoming-derelict/shdaily.shtml|newspaper=[[Shanghai Daily]]|date=13 May 2011|accessdate=11 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212091106/http://www.shanghaidaily.com/feature/art-and-culture/Stopping-the-local-dialect-becoming-derelict/shdaily.shtml|archive-date=12 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Shanghai Cricket Club]] dates back to 1858 when the first recorded cricket match was played between a team of [[British Navy|British Naval]] officers and a Shanghai 11. Following a 45-year dormancy after the founding of the PRC in 1949, the club was re-established in 1994 by expatriates living in the city and has since grown to over 300 members. The [[Shanghai cricket team]] played various international matches between 1866 and 1948.
