In Macao and Malaysia, it is spelled as '''Choi''', in Malaysia and the Philippines as '''Chua''' or '''Chuah''', in Thailand as '''Chuo''' (ฉั่ว).{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Moreover, it is also romanized in Cambodia as either '''Chhay''', '''Chhuor''' or '''Chhor''' among Chinese Cambodians and as '''Tjoa''' or '''Chua''' in Indonesia.

==History==
{{see also|Cai (state)}}
The Cais are said to be the descendants of the 5th son of [[King Wen of Zhou]], [[Ji Du]]. Ji Du was awarded the title of [[marquis]] (''[[Chinese nobility#Fengjian and Zongfa of the Zhou Dynasty|hóu]]'') of the [[Cai (state)|State of Cai]] (centered on what is now [[Shangcai]], [[Zhumadian]], [[Henan]], [[China]]), and he was known as Cai Shu Du ("Uncle Du of Cai"). Together with [[Guan Shu]] and [[Huo Shu]], they were known as the [[Three Guards]]. When King Wu died, his son [[King Cheng of Zhou|King Cheng]] was too young and his uncle, the [[Duke of Zhou]], became [[regent]]. Seeing that the power of the Duke of Zhou was increasing, the Three Guards got jealous and rebelled against Zhou together with [[Wu Geng]]. The Duke of Zhou suppressed the rebellion, and Cai Shu was exiled. King Cheng reestablished Cai Shu's son Wu or Hu<!--Wu here, Hu at Cai Shu Du--> as the new Duke of Cai. Some 600 years later in the [[Warring States period]], the [[Chu (state)|State of Chu]] conquered Cai in 447 BC and was itself conquered by the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] which, in turn, formed the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin Empire]], China's first empire. With the spread of family names to all [[social classes]] in the new empire, many people of the former state of Cai began to bear it as a surname.

The Cai descendants have undertaken the following two major migrations. During the [[Huang Chao Rebellion]] ([[Anno Domini|AD]] 875) at the end of the [[Tang Dynasty]] (AD 618-907), the Cai clan migrated to [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]] provinces. Another later migration occurred when [[Ming Dynasty]] loyalist [[Koxinga]] moved military officials surnamed Cai and their families to [[Taiwan]] in the 17th century.  As a result, the surname is far more common in these areas and in areas settled by their descendants (e.g., [[Southeast Asia]]) than in other parts of China.

==Transliteration and romanization==

===Chinese===
Cai is written the same (蔡) in both [[Simplified Chinese character|simplified]] and [[Traditional Chinese character|traditional]] [[Chinese character]]s.

In [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], the surname is [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Cài''' in [[pinyin]] and [[Tongyong Pinyin]], '''Ts'ai''' in [[Wade-Giles]], and '''Tsay''' in [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]].  In [[Southern Min]] or [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]], it is '''Chhoà''' in [[Pe̍h-oē-jī]].  In [[Cantonese]] ([[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]), it is '''Coi3''' in [[Jyutping]] and '''Choi''' in [[Yale romanization of Cantonese|Yale]]. (This should not be confused with the predominantly [[Korean people|Korean]] family name [[Choi (Korean name)|Choi]] which has a different character [崔]).  In [[Hakka language|Hakka]] it is '''Tshai''' in [[Pha̍k-fa-sṳ]].  (In [[Tongyong pinyin]], it is '''Cai''' in [[Siyen]] Hakka and '''Ca̱i''' in [[Hoiliuk]] Hakka.)  In [[Fuzhou dialect]], it is '''Chái''' (in [[Bàng-uâ-cê]]).

===Other languages===
Koreans use Chinese-derived family names and in [[Korean language|Korean]], Cai is 채 in [[Hangul]], '''[[Chae]]''' in [[Revised romanization of Korean|Revised Romanization]], and '''Ch'ae''' in [[McCune-Reischauer]].

[[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] also use Chinese-derived family names. In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the name is '''Thái'''. The Chinese name 蔡 is usually transliterated via [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] as Thái but sometimes as '''Sái'''.

[[Japanese people|Japanese]] do not use Chinese family names but for Chinese in [[Japan]] who carry the name, it is さい in [[Hiragana]] and '''Sai''' in the [[Romanization of Japanese|major romanization systems]].

===Romanization===
Cai is [[romanization|romanized]] as '''Cai''' in the [[People's Republic of China]], '''Tsai''' (or occasionally Tsay or Chai for Mandarin) or '''Tsoa''' in the [[Taiwan]], and '''Choi''' or '''Choy''' in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Malaysia]]. In [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Brunei]], the most common forms are '''Chua''' or '''Chuah''' for [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] and [[Hokkien]] speakers, '''Chai''' for [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] speakers, '''Choi''' or '''Tsoi''' for [[Cantonese]] speakers, and '''Toy''' or '''Toi''' for [[Taishanese]] speakers. In [[Indonesia]], it is usually romanized as '''Tjoa'''/'''Tjhoa'''/'''Tjoea'''/'''Tjhoea''' (Hokkien & Teochew), '''Tjhoi''' (Cantonese) or '''Tjhai''' (Hakka) with Dutch spelling, or '''Tjua'''/'''Tjhua''' (Hokkien & Teochew) with old Indonesian spelling, or '''Chua''' (Hokkien & Teochew), '''Choy'''/'''Choi''' (Cantonese) or '''Chai''' (Hakka) with current Indonesian spelling. In the [[Philippines]], it is '''Chua''' {{IPA|/ˈtʃuwa/}} or '''Cua''' ({{IPA|/'kuwa/}} or {{IPA|/kwa/}}). '''Chua''' is pronounced {{IPA|/ˈtʃwa/}} in other Anglophone countries outside the Philippines.

Other variations include '''Chye''' and '''Coi'''.

==Derivative names==
In addition, some of the Chuas (Cais) who resided in the Philippines adopted Spanish names to avoid persecution by the Spanish rulers during the Philippines' [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonial rule]] from the early 16th to late 19th century. [[Hispanicization|Hispanicized]] forms of the name include Chuachiaco, Chuakay, Chuapoco, Chuaquico, Chuacuco, Chuason, Chuateco, and Chuatoco.<ref name="Katálogo">Hector Santos. [http://www.bibingka.com/names/ Katálogo ng mga Apelyidong Pilipino (Catalog of Filipino Names).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305142404/http://www.bibingka.com/names/ |date=2010-03-05 }}</ref>  These names were formed from the surname, one character of the given name, and the suffix "-co", a Minnan honorific ''ko'' (哥), literally meaning "older brother".<ref name="Katálogo"/>

In Thailand, most Thais of Chinese descendance use Thai surnames.  Legislation by Siamese King [[Vajiravudh|Rama VI (1910-1925)]] required the adoption of Thai surnames which was largely directed at easing tensions with Chinese community by encouraging assimilation.  Thai law did not (and does not) allow identical surnames to those already in existence,<ref>Kriengsak Niratpattanasai. [https://archive.is/20120722061820/http://www.apmforum.com/columns/thai4.htm "Why many Thais have a long surname."] Thailand Tales column in the ''APMF Asian Business Strategy Ezine''.</ref> so ethnic Chinese formerly surnamed Chua incorporating words that sound like "Chua" and have good meaning (such as ''Chai'', meaning "victory") into much longer surnames.

After [[Suharto]] came to power, his regime created many [[Anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia|anti-Chinese legislations in Indonesia]]. One of them was [[127/U/Kep/12/1966]] which strongly encouraged ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia to adopt Indonesian-sounding names instead of the standard three-word or two-word Chinese names. Many Indonesianized names are Chinese surname syllables with western or Indonesian prefix or suffix - resulting in many exotic-sounding names. Although two Chinese individuals shared the same Chinese surname, they may employ different strategies for the Indonesian-sounding names. For example, Indonesianized forms of Cai include Tjuatja, Cuaca, Tjuandi, Cuandi, Tjahjana, Tjahja, etc. Despite the Indonesianization, the Chinese surnames are still used today by the Chinese-Indonesian diaspora overseas (mostly in the Netherlands, Germany, and USA); by those Chinese-Indonesians courageous enough during Suharto's regime to keep their Chinese names (e.g., [[Kwik Kian Gie]]), or by those who couldn't afford to process the name change through Indonesia's civil bureaucracy. After [[Fall of Suharto|Suharto resigned from the presidency]], subsequent governments revoked the [[Legislation on Chinese Indonesians|ban on the ethnic Chinese from speaking and learning Chinese in public]]. Using the original Chinese surnames is no longer a taboo but only a small minority have decided to re-adopt the original Chinese surnames of their grandparents or to use the Mandarin Chinese [[pinyin]] romanization, pronunciation and spelling and most retain their changed names as the post-1965 generations have been culturally Indonesianized.
