The '''Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences''' ('''AMPAS''', often pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|p|æ|s}}; also known as simply '''the Academy''' or '''the Motion Picture Academy''') is a professional honorary organization with the stated goal of advancing the arts and sciences of [[motion picture]]s. The Academy's corporate management and general policies are overseen by a board of governors, which includes representatives from each of the craft branches.

As of April 2020, the organization was estimated to consist of around 9,921 motion picture professionals. The Academy is an international organization and membership is open to qualified filmmakers around the world.

The Academy is known around the world for its annual [[Academy Awards]], now officially and popularly known as "The Oscars".<ref>^ Pond, Steve (February 19, 2013).

Retrieved February 22, 2013.</ref>

In addition, the Academy holds the [[Governors Awards]] annually for lifetime achievement in film; presents [[Academy Scientific and Technical Award|Scientific and Technical Awards]] annually; gives [[Student Academy Awards]] annually to filmmakers at the undergraduate and graduate level; awards up to five [[Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting]] annually; and operates the [[Margaret Herrick Library]] (at the Fairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study) in [[Beverly Hills, California]], and the [[Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study]] in [[Hollywood]], [[Los Angeles]]. The Academy plans to open the [[Academy Museum of Motion Pictures]] in Los Angeles in 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/museum|title=Museum|work=oscars.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/02/delayed-academy-movie-museum-tip-toes-into-2019-1201912409/|title=Delayed Again, The Academy Movie Museum Tip-Toes Into 2019|first=Michael|last=Cieply|date=February 15, 2017|work=Deadline.com}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:AMPAS.jpg|thumb|Headquarters building]]

The notion of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) began with [[Louis B. Mayer]], head of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM). He said he wanted to create an organization that would mediate labor disputes without unions<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/02/secret-oscar-history It all started when the original Hollywood mogul wanted to build a beach house] David Thomson, Vanity Fair, February 21, 2014</ref> and improve the industry's image. He met with actor [[Conrad Nagel]], director [[Fred Niblo]], and the head of the [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers|Association of Motion Picture Producers]], Fred Beetson to discuss these matters. The idea of this elite club having an annual banquet was discussed, but no mention of awards at that time. They also established that membership into the organization would only be open to people involved in one of the five branches of the industry: actors, directors, writers, technicians, and producers.<ref name="Wiley, Mason pg. 2">Wiley, Mason, and [[Damien Bona]]. ''Inside Oscar''. New York: [[Ballantine Books]], 1986 pg. 2</ref>

After their brief meeting, Mayer gathered up a group of thirty-six people involved in the film industry and invited them to a formal banquet at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles on January 11, 1927.<ref>Levy, Emanuel. ''And The Winner Is....'' New York: Ungar Publishing, 1987 pg. 1</ref> That evening Mayer presented to those guests what he called the International Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Everyone in the room that evening became a founder of the Academy.<ref name="Wiley, Mason pg. 2" /> Between that evening and when the official Articles of Incorporation for the organization were filed on May 4, 1927, the "International" was dropped from the name, becoming the "Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences".<ref name=60Years8>Osborne, Robert. ''60 Years of The Oscar''. [[Abbeville Press]], 1989. Page 8.</ref><ref name=OscarsHist>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy/history-organization/history.html |title=History of the Academy: How It Began |publisher=Oscars.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605133157/http://www.oscars.org/academy/history-organization/history.html |archivedate=June 5, 2011 }}</ref>

Several organizational meetings were held prior to the first official meeting held on May 6, 1927. Their first organizational meeting was held on May 11 at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel]]. At that meeting [[Douglas Fairbanks|Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.]] was elected as the first president of the Academy, while Fred Niblo was the first vice-president, and their first roster, composed of 230 members, was printed.<ref name=60Years8 /> That night, the Academy also bestowed its first honorary membership, to [[Thomas Edison]].<ref name=OscarsHist /> Initially, the Academy was broken down into five main groups, or branches, although this number of branches has grown over the years. The original five were: Producers, Actors, Directors, Writers and Technicians.<ref name=60Years9>Osborne, Robert. ''60 Years of The Oscar''. Abbeville Press, 1989. Page 9.</ref>

The initial concerns of the group had to do with labor."<ref name=60Years10>Osborne, Robert. ''60 Years of The Oscar''. Abbeville Press, 1989. Page 10.</ref> However, as time went on, the organization moved "further away from involvement in labor-management arbitrations and negotiations."<ref name=OscarHist>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy/history-organization/history.html |title=History of the Academy |publisher=Oscar.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605133157/http://www.oscars.org/academy/history-organization/history.html |archivedate=June 5, 2011 }}</ref> One of several committees formed in those initial days was for "Awards of Merit," but it was not until May 1928 that the committee began to have serious discussions about the structure of the awards and the presentation ceremony. By July 1928 the board of directors had approved a list of 12 awards to be presented.<ref name=60Years15>Osborne, Robert. ''60 Years of The Oscar''. Abbeville Press, 1989. Page 15.</ref> During July the voting system for the Awards was established, and the nomination and selection process began.<ref>Wiley, Mason, and [[Damien Bona]]. ''Inside Oscar''. New York: Ballantine Books, 1986 pg. 3</ref> This "award of merit for distinctive achievement" is what we know now as the [[Academy Award]]s.

The initial location of the organization was 6912 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref name="60Years10"/><ref name=OscarHist /> In November 1927, the Academy moved to the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Roosevelt Hotel]] at 7010 Hollywood Boulevard, which was also the month the Academy's library began compiling a complete collection of books and periodicals dealing with the industry from around the world. In May 1928, the Academy authorized the construction of a state of the art screening room, to be located in the Club lounge of the hotel. The screening room was not completed until April 1929.<ref name=60Years10 />

With the publication of ''Report on Incandescent Illumination'' in 1928, the Academy began a long history of publishing books to assist its members. Another early initiative concerned training Army Signal Corps officers.<ref name=OscarHist />

In 1929, Academy members in a joint venture with the [[University of Southern California]] created America's first film school to further the art and science of moving pictures. The school's founding faculty included Fairbanks (President of the Academy), [[D. W. Griffith]], [[William C. deMille]], [[Ernst Lubitsch]], [[Irving Thalberg]], and [[Darryl F. Zanuck]].<ref name=USCCinema>{{cite web|last=Staff|title=USC School of Cinematic Arts: History|url=http://cinema.usc.edu/about/history/|publisher=cinema.usc.edu|accessdate=February 9, 2014}}</ref>

1930 saw another move, to 7046 Hollywood Boulevard, in order to accommodate the enlarging staff,<ref name=OscarHist /> and by December of that year the library was acknowledged as "having one of the most complete collections of information on the motion picture industry anywhere in existence."<ref name=60Years12>Osborne, Robert. ''60 Years of The Oscar''. Abbeville Press, 1989. Page 12.</ref> They remained at that location until 1935 when further growth caused them to move once again. This time, the administrative offices moved to one location, to the Taft Building at the corner of Hollywood and Vine, while the library moved to 1455 North Gordon Street.<ref name=OscarHist />

In 1934, the Academy began publication of the ''Screen Achievement Records Bulletin'', which today is known as the ''Motion Picture Credits Database''. This is a list of film credits up for an Academy Award, as well as other films released in Los Angeles County, using research materials from the Academy's [[Margaret Herrick Library]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oscars.org/research-preservation/resources-databases/mpc.html | title=Motion Picture Credits Database | publisher=Oscars.org}}</ref> Another publication of the 1930s was the first annual ''Academy Players Directory'' in 1937. The Directory was published by the Academy until 2006 when it was sold to a private concern. The Academy had been involved in the technical aspects of film making since its founding in 1927, and by 1938, the Science and Technology Council consisted of 36 technical committees addressing technical issues related to sound recording and reproduction, projection, lighting, film preservation, and cinematography.<ref name=OscarHist />

In 2009, the inaugural [[Governors Awards]] were held, at which the Academy awards the [[Academy Honorary Award]], the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]] and the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]].

In 2016, the Academy became the [[88th Academy Awards#Criticism regarding lack of diversity|target of criticism]] for its failure to recognize the achievements of minority professionals. For the second year in a row, all 20 nominees in the major acting categories were white. The president of the Academy [[Cheryl Boone Isaacs]],<ref name="CBIElectedPR">{{cite web|url = http://www.oscars.org/about/board-of-governors|title = board of governors|publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|date = February 1, 2016|accessdate = February 1, 2016}}</ref> the first African American and third woman to lead the Academy,<ref name="CBIElectedGD">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldderby.com/news/4617/cheryl-boone-isaacs-oscars-ampas-film-news-13579086.html |title=Cheryl Boone Isaacs elected first African-American head of Oscars |publisher=Goldderby.com |date=July 31, 2013 |accessdate=August 2, 2013}}</ref> denied in 2015 that there was a problem.

[[Spike Lee]], interviewed shortly after the all-white nominee list was published, pointed to Hollywood leadership as the root problem, "We may win an Oscar now and then, but an Oscar is not going to fundamentally change how Hollywood does business. I'm not talking about Hollywood stars. I'm talking about executives.

==Galleries and theaters==
[[File:Academy02.jpg|thumb|Fairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study building on La Cienega Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California]]
[[File:PickfordCenter01.jpg|thumb|[[Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study]] in the Hollywood district]]

The Academy's numerous and diverse operations are housed in three facilities in the Los Angeles area: the headquarters building in Beverly Hills, which was constructed specifically for the Academy, and two Centers for Motion Picture Study – one in Beverly Hills, the other in Hollywood – which were existing structures restored and transformed to contain the Academy's Library, Film Archive and other departments and programs.

===Current===

====Academy Headquarters====
The '''Academy Headquarters Building''' in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] once housed two galleries that were open free to the public. The Grand Lobby Gallery and the Fourth Floor Gallery offered changing exhibits related to films, film-making and film personalities. These galleries have since been closed in preparation for the opening of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in 2020.

The building includes the '''[[Samuel Goldwyn Theater]]''', which seats 1,012, and was designed to present films at maximum technical accuracy, with state-of-the-art projection equipment and sound system. The theater is busy year-round with the Academy's public programming, members-only screenings, movie premieres and other special activities (including the live television broadcast of the Academy Awards nominations announcement every January). The building once housed the '''Academy Little Theater''', is a 67-seat screening facility, but this was converted to additional office space in a building remodel.

====Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study====
{{main|Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study}}

The '''[[Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study]]''', located in central Hollywood and named for legendary actress and Academy founder [[Mary Pickford]], houses several Academy departments, including the [[Academy Film Archive]], the Science and Technology Council, Student Academy Awards and Grants, and the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting. The building, originally dedicated on August 18, 1948, is the oldest surviving structure in Hollywood that was designed specifically with television in mind. Additionally, it is the location of the '''Linwood Dunn Theater''', which seats 286 people.

====Fairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study====
The '''Fairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study''' is located at 333 S. [[La Cienega Boulevard]] in Beverly Hills. It is home to the Academy's '''[[Margaret Herrick Library]]''', a world-renowned, non-circulating reference and research collection devoted to the history and development of the motion picture as an art form and an industry. Established in 1928, the library is open to the public and used year-round by students, scholars, historians and industry professionals. The library is named for Margaret Herrick, the Academy's first librarian who also played a major role in the Academy's first televised broadcast, helping to turn the Oscar ceremony into a major annual televised event.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/library/about |title= About the Library|date= |website=Oscars.org|publisher=[[AMPAS]]|access-date= January 29, 2016 |quote=}}</ref>

The building itself was built in 1928, where it was originally built to be a water treatment plant for Beverly Hills. Its "bell tower" held water-purifying hardware.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/travel/california/la-tr-mission-lookalikes-photos-013-photo.html |title= The Beverly Hills Waterworks Building, now known as the Fairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study|date= |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date= January 29, 2016 |quote=}}</ref>

===Former===

====Academy Theater in New York====
The Academy also has a New York City-based East Coast showcase theater, the Academy Theater at [[Lighthouse Guild|Lighthouse International]]. The 220-seat venue was redesigned in 2011 by renowned theater designer Theo Kalomirakis, including an extensive installation of new audio and visual equipment. The theater is in the East 59th Street headquarters of the non-profit vision loss organization, Lighthouse International.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lester|first=Ahren|title=HARMAN's JBL loudspeakers installed at New York's Academy Theater|url=http://www.audioprointernational.com/news/read/harmans-jbl-loudspeakers-installed-at-new-yorks-academy-theater/04157|publisher=Audio Pro International|accessdate=February 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626144447/http://www.audioprointernational.com/news/read/harmans-jbl-loudspeakers-installed-at-new-yorks-academy-theater/04157|archive-date=June 26, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> In July 2015, it was announced that the Academy was forced to move out, due to Lighthouse International selling the property the theater was in.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-forced-new-york-theater-807703 |title=Academy Forced Out of Longtime Theater Venue in New York |last1= Feinberg|first1=Scott |date= July 10, 2015  |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date= January 29, 2016 |quote=}}

===Upcoming===

====The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures====
{{main|Academy Museum of Motion Pictures}}

The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, a Los Angeles museum currently under construction, will be the newest facility associated with the Academy. It is scheduled to open on April 30, 2021,<ref>{{cite web |title=Visit |url=https://www.academymuseum.org/en/visit |website=academymuseum.org |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref> and will contain over {{convert|290000|sqft}} of galleries, exhibition spaces, movie theaters, educational areas, and special event spaces.<ref>[http://www.oscars.org/academymuseum/ The Academy Museum]. Oscars.org. Retrieved on May 22, 2014.</ref>

==Membership==
Membership in the Academy is by invitation only. Invitation comes from the Board of Governors. Membership eligibility may be achieved by earning a competitive Oscar nomination, or by the sponsorship of two current Academy members from the same branch to which the candidate seeks admission.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.oscars.org/about/join-academy|title = Academy Membership|date = February 27, 2017|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first =}}</ref>

New membership proposals are considered annually in the spring. Press releases announce the names of those who have recently been invited to join. Membership in the Academy does not expire, even if a member struggles later in his or her career.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oscar voters aren't always who you might think|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/academy/la-et-movie-academy-surprises-academy-project-html,0,7659145.htmlstory|accessdate=February 26, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 19, 2012}}</ref>

Academy membership is divided into 17 branches, representing different disciplines in motion pictures. Members may not belong to more than one branch. Members whose work does not fall within one of the branches may belong to a group known as "Members at Large". Members at Large have all the privileges of branch membership except for representation on the Board. Associate members are those closely allied to the industry but not actively engaged in motion picture production. They are not represented on the Board and do not vote on Academy Awards.

According to a February 2012 study conducted by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (sampling over 5,000 of its 5,765 members), the Academy at that time was 94% white, 77% male, 86% age 50 or older, and had a median age of 62. A third of members were previous winners or nominees of Academy Awards themselves. Of the Academy's 54-member Board of Governors, 25 are female.<ref>{{cite web |title=Board of Governors |url=https://www.oscars.org/about/board-of-governors |website=oscars.org |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>

June 29, 2016, saw a paradigm shift in the Academy's selection process, resulting in a new class comprising 46% women, and 41% people of color.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/06/29/idris-elba-john-boyega-part-new-diverse-academy-class/86522718/ |title = Academy's diverse new class includes Idris Elba, America Ferrera|date = June 29, 2016|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first =}}</ref> The effort to diversify the Academy was led by social activist, and Broadway Black managing-editor, April Reign.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/april-reign-oscarssowhite_us_56d21088e4b03260bf771018|title = Meet April Reign, the Activist Who Created OscarsSoWhite|date = February 27, 2016|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first =}}</ref> Reign created the Twitter hashtag #OscarsSoWhite as a means of criticizing the dearth of non-white nominees for the 2015 Academy Awards. Though the hashtag drew widespread media attention, the Academy remained obstinate on the matter of adopting a resolution that would make demonstrable its efforts to increase diversity. With the 2016 Academy Awards, many, including April Reign, were dismayed by the Academy's indifference about representation and inclusion, as the 2016 nominees were once again entirely white. April Reign revived #OscarsSoWhite, and renewed her campaign efforts, including multiple media appearances and interviews with reputable news outlets. As a result of Reign's campaign, the discourse surrounding representation and recognition in film spread beyond the United States of America and became a global discussion. Faced with mounting pressure to expand the Academy membership, the Academy capitulated and instituted all new policies to ensure that future Academy membership invitations would better represent the demographics of modern film-going audiences.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-academy-new-members-live-updates-20160629-htmlstory.html |title = Updates on the film academy's 2016 class: An exclusive club gets much bigger after OscarsSoWhite|date = June 29, 2016|newspaper =L.A.

Members are able to see many new films for free at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater {{clarify|text=and other facilities|date=January 2017}} within two weeks of their debut, and sometimes before release; in addition, some of the screeners are available through [[iTunes]] to its members.<ref name="hammond20120326">{{cite news | url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/03/oscar-voters-last-to-see-hunger-games/ | title=Oscar Voters Last To See 'Hunger Games'? | work=Deadline Hollywood | date=March 26, 2012 | accessdate=March 26, 2012 | author=Hammond, Pete}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/04/26/academy-members-get-screeners-through-itunes/|title=Academy members get screeners through iTunes|publisher=}}</ref>
