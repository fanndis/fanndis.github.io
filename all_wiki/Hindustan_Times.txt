== History ==
[[File:Hindustan Times 1999 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|left|A 1999 stamp dedicated to the 75th anniversary of ''Hindustan Times'']]
''Hindustan Times'' was founded in 1924 by [[Sunder Singh Lyallpuri]], founder-father of the [[Akali movement]] and the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] in [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618083211/https://urduyouthforum.org/news_Hindustan_Times_bio.php |title=Hindustan Times (HT) bio |publisher=Urduyouthforum.org|accessdate=6 August 2020}}</ref> S Mangal Singh Gill (Tesildar) and S. Chanchal Singh (Jandiala, Jalandhar) were made in charge of the newspaper. [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] and [[Tara Singh (activist)|Tara Singh]] were among the members of the Managing Committee. The Managing Chairman and Chief Patron was Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri.

According to Prem Shankar Jha who wrote an official history of the newspaper in 1999, most of the early funding of the paper, therefore, came from Sikhs in Canada. When financial troubles started in the early years, the Akalis approached two interested potential buyers from the nationalist movement. These were Motilal Nehru and Madan Mohan Malaviya, and ultimately Malviya bought the ''Hindustan Times.'' In fact, Malviya had to take out a loan of Rs. 40,000 with the help of Lala Lajpat Rai in order to finance the paper.  In 1928, Gandhi chose a new editor, [[K. M. Panikkar|K.M Panikkar]] for the paper. By that time, the paper was running into financial troubles again and [[G. D. Birla]] underwrote some expenses and ultimately assumed ownership.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://caravanmagazine.in/media/history-repeating-shobhana-bhartias-hindustan-times|title=History repeating at Shobhana Bhartia’s Hindustan Times|last=Dev|first=Atul|website=The Caravan|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>

[[Devdas Gandhi]], son of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], was inducted into the editors' panel, and was later appointed editor.<ref>{{cite news|title=Shobhana Bhartia wants to benchmark HT with the best in the world|url=http://m.businesstoday.in//story/ht-group-shobhana-bhartia-in-most-powerful-business-women/1/188386.html|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=[[Business Today (business magazine)|Business Today]]|date=14 October 2012}}</ref> The opening ceremony was performed by Mahatma Gandhi on 26 September 1924. The first issue was published from Naya Bazar, [[Delhi]] (now Swami Sharda Nand Marg). It contained writings and articles from [[C. F. Andrews]] and [[Cattamanchi Ramalinga Reddy]], among others.

K. M. Panikkar, also known as Sardar Panikkar, launched the ''Hindustan Times'' as a serious nationalist newspaper. As an Oxonian, historian and litterateur, Panikkar strived to make the paper broader than an Akali sheet. He became the editor and funds flowed freely from Akali patrons. He exerted himself strenuously, but the paper made very little headway. In two years, Panikkar could not take the print order any higher than 3,000. By then the Akali movement appeared to lose steam and funds dried up. The paper was saved from an untimely demise when [[Madan Mohan Malaviya|Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya]] stepped in to realise his vision of a newspaper in Delhi.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv| last=George| first=T.

It has its roots in the [[Indian independence movement]] of the first half of the twentieth century and even faced the noted "''Hindustan Times'' Contempt Case (August–November, 1941)" at [[Allahabad High Court]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Hindustan Times Contempt Case (August–November, 1941) |year=2007|publisher=READ BOOKS|isbn=1-4067-6748-4 |page=283 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtYhsX39MKQC&pg=PA316 }}</ref> It was edited at times by many important people in India, including [[Devdas Gandhi]], Sri Mulgaonkar, [[B.

== Controversy ==
Former Executive Editor [[Shishir Gupta]] left the newspaper after ''Frontline''<ref>{{cite news|title=Under close watch
|url=http://www.frontline.in/cover-story/under-close-watch/article9456570.ece|accessdate=24 April 2018|newspaper=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|date=20 January 2017}}</ref> reported about his emails to [[Amit Shah]] and Mr Shah's Officer on Special Duty. The ''Frontline'' story detailed how the Prime Minister's Office was taking extraordinary interest in the Delhi Government led by Chief Minister [[Arvind Kejriwal]].

After the "surgical strikes" had happened in September 2016, Shobhna Bhartia reportedly had started getting calls from the PM's office and from Amit Shah, and attention came to be focused on the Hate Tracker, a crowd-sourced database on the ''Hindustan Times'' website that recorded hate crimes in India which was launched under recently appointed editor Bobby Ghosh.<ref name="auto"/> He left the newspaper abruptly and The Wire reported<ref>{{cite news|title=Hindustan Times Editor’s Exit Preceded by Meeting Between Modi, Newspaper Owner

''[[The Indian Express]]'' published a report in 2017 that leaked documents stating that Hindustan Times Limited was linked to an offshore entity called Go4i.com, of which Bhartiya and Priyavat were listed as directors. ''Hindustan Times'' had listed this entity as a subsidiary in 2003–2004 financial year, and not in the years after that. Hindustan Times Limited responded to the report by denying any wrongdoing.<ref name="auto"/>
