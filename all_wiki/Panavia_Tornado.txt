The '''Panavia Tornado''' is a family of [[Twinjet|twin-engine]], [[variable-sweep wing]] [[multirole combat aircraft]], jointly developed and manufactured by Italy, the United Kingdom and West Germany. There are three primary [[#Variants|Tornado variants]]: the Tornado IDS ([[interdictor]]/[[attack aircraft|strike]]) fighter-bomber, the [[suppression of enemy air defences]] Tornado ECR ([[electronic warfare aircraft|electronic combat]]/[[reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]]) and the [[Panavia Tornado ADV|Tornado ADV]] (air defence variant) [[interceptor aircraft]].

The Tornado was developed and built by [[Panavia Aircraft GmbH]], a tri-national consortium consisting of [[British Aerospace]] (previously [[British Aircraft Corporation]]), [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm|MBB]] of West Germany, and [[Aeritalia]] of Italy. It first flew on 14 August 1974 and was introduced into service in 1979–1980. Due to its [[multirole combat aircraft|multirole]] design, it was able to replace several different fleets of aircraft in the adopting air forces. The [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] (RSAF) became the only export operator of the Tornado in addition to the three original partner nations. A tri-nation training and evaluation unit operating from [[RAF Cottesmore]], the [[Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment]], maintained a level of international co-operation beyond the production stage.

The Tornado was operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), [[Italian Air Force]], and RSAF during the [[Gulf War]] of 1991, in which the Tornado conducted many low-altitude penetrating strike missions. The Tornados of various services were also used in The [[Bosnian War]], [[Kosovo War]], [[Iraq War]], in Libya during the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan civil war]], as well as smaller roles in Afghanistan, Yemen, and [[Operation Shader|Syria]]. Including all variants, 990<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.panavia.de/aircraft/overview/variants// |title=Panavia Tornado total production source from panavia homepage }}</ref> aircraft were built.

==Development==

===Origins===
[[File:AFVG (1965).jpg|thumb|Artist's concept of the [[BAC/Dassault AFVG|AFVG]], an ancestor to the MRCA programme]]

During the 1960s, aeronautical designers looked to [[Variable-sweep wing|variable-geometry wing]] designs to gain the manoeuvrability and efficient cruise of straight wings with the speed of [[swept wing]] designs. The United Kingdom had cancelled the procurement of the [[TSR-2]] and subsequent [[General Dynamics F-111K|F-111K]] aircraft, and was still looking for a replacement for its [[Avro Vulcan]] and [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] strike aircraft.<ref name= 'segell124'>Segell 1997, p. 124.</ref> Britain and France had initiated the [[BAC/Dassault AFVG]] (Anglo French Variable Geometry) project in 1965, but this had ended with French withdrawal in 1967.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/djreprints/access/72865521.html?dids=72865521:72865521&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Jun+22%2C+1967&author=&pub=Wall+Street+Journal&desc=British-French+Work+On+New+Military+Plane+Periled+by+Cost+Fight&pqatl=google "British-French Work On New Military Plane Periled by Cost Fight."] ''Wall Street Journal,'' 22 June 1967.</ref> Britain continued to develop a variable-geometry aircraft similar to the proposed AFVG, and sought new partners to achieve this.<ref name= 'torn birt 11'>Willox 2002, p. 11.</ref> West German [[Entwicklungsring Süd|EWR]] had been developing the swing-wing EWR-Fairchild-Hiller A400 AVS Advanced Vertical Strike (which has a similar configuration to the Tornado).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertcmason.com/textdocs/GermanVSTOLFighters.pdf |title=Microsoft PowerPoint - IPLC German VSTOL Brief.ppt |access-date=24 December 2018}}</ref><ref>''Flight International'' 1 June 1967, p. 896.</ref><ref>''Flight international'' 23 May 1968, p. 798.</ref>

In 1968, West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Canada formed a working group to examine replacements for the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]],<ref name= '104replac'/> initially called the ''Multi Role Aircraft (MRA)'', later renamed as the ''Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA)''.<ref name= 'jerr53'>Scutts 2000, p. 53.</ref><ref>Jefford et al. 2002, p. 25.</ref> As the partner nations' requirements were so diverse, it was decided to develop a single aircraft that could perform a variety of missions that were previously undertaken by a fleet of different aircraft.<ref>Haglund 1989, pp. 47–48.</ref> Britain joined the MRCA group in 1968, represented by [[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Michael Giddings]], and a memorandum of agreement was drafted between Britain, West Germany, and Italy in May 1969.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VvYeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LowEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7327,1861291&dq=multi+role+aircraft&hl=en "European Nations Plan Mammoth Military Aircraft."] ''Sarasota Journal,'' 14 January 1969.</ref>

By the end of 1968, the prospective purchases from the six countries amounted to 1,500 aircraft.<ref name= 'jef 28'>Jefford et al. 2002, p. 28.</ref> Canada and Belgium had departed before any long-term commitments had been made to the programme;<ref name= 'haglund 48'>Haglund 1989, p. 48.</ref> Canada had found the project politically unpalatable; there was a perception in political circles that much of the manufacturing and specifications were focused on Western Europe.

===Panavia Aircraft GmbH===

On 26 March 1969, four partner nations&nbsp;– United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, agreed to form a multinational company, Panavia Aircraft GmbH, to develop and manufacture the MRCA.<ref name='segell124'/><ref name= '104replac'>Morris, Joe Alex Jr. "Messerschmitt Back in Business."

When the agreement was finalised, the United Kingdom and West Germany each had a 42.5% stake of the workload, with the remaining 15% going to Italy; this division of the production work was heavily influenced by international political bargaining.<ref name= 'haglund 52+56'>Haglund 1989, pp. 52, 56.</ref> The front fuselage and tail assembly was assigned to [[British Aircraft Corporation|BAC]] (now [[BAE Systems]]) in the United Kingdom; the centre fuselage to [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm|MBB]] (now part of [[Airbus SE|Airbus]]) in West Germany; and the wings to [[Aeritalia]] (now [[Leonardo S.p.A.|Leonardo]]) in Italy.<ref name='segell125'>Segell 1997, p. 125.</ref> Similarly, tri-national worksharing was used for engines and equipment. A separate multinational company, [[Turbo-Union]], was formed in June 1970 to develop and build the [[Turbo-Union RB199|RB199]] engines for the aircraft, with ownership split 40% [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]], 40% [[MTU Aero Engines|MTU]], and 20% [[FIAT]].<ref name='segell124'/><ref name= 'Wellington'>Long, Wellington.

At the conclusion of the project definition phase in May 1970, the concepts were reduced to two designs; a single seat Panavia 100 which West Germany initially preferred, and the twin-seat Panavia 200 which the RAF preferred.<ref name= 'Wellington'/> The aircraft was briefly called the ''Panavia Panther'', and the project soon coalesced towards the two-seat option.<ref>Dorrell, David, ed.

===Prototypes and testing===
The first of fifteen development aircraft (nine prototypes, P01 to P09, and six pre-series, PS11 to PS 16) flew on 14 August 1974 at [[Manching]], Germany; the pilot, Paul Millett described his experience: "Aircraft handling was delightful... the actual flight went so smoothly that I did begin to wonder whether this was not yet another simulation".<ref>Jefford et al. 2002, pp. 89–90.</ref> Flight testing led to the need for minor modifications. Airflow disturbances were responded to by re-profiling the [[Intake|engine intakes]] and the fuselage to minimise [[Compressor stall|surging]] and [[buffeting]] experienced at supersonic speeds.<ref>Jefford et al. 2002, pp. 91–92, 95–96.</ref>

According to Jim Quinn, programmer of the Tornado development simulation software and engineer on the Tornado engine and engine controls, the prototype was safely capable of reaching [[supercruise]], but the engines had severe safety issues at high altitude while trying to decelerate. At high altitude and low turbine speed the compressor did not provide enough pressure to hold back the combustion pressure and would result in a violent vibration as the combustion pressure backfired into the intake. To avoid this effect the engine controls would automatically increase the minimum idle setting as altitude increased, until at very high altitudes the idle setting was so high, however, that it was close to maximum dry thrust. This resulted in one of the test aircraft being stuck in a mach 1.2 supercruise at high altitude and having to reduce speed by turning the aircraft, because the idle setting at that altitude was so high that the aircraft could not decelerate.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jim |last=Quinn |title=The White Tornado |chapter=2, Tornado Concept Evolution}}</ref>

The British [[Ministry of Supply]]{{when|date=February 2019}} ordered Chief Engineer Ted Talbot from the Concorde development team to provide intake design assistance to the Tornado development team in order to overcome these issues, which they hesitantly agreed to after noting that the Concorde intake data had apparently already been leaked to the Soviet Union. The German engineers working on the Tornado intake were unable to produce a functional Concorde style intake despite having data from the Concorde team. To make the problem worse, their management team incorrectly filed a patent on the Concorde design, and then tried to sue the British engineers who had provided the design to them. The German lawyers realised that the British had provided the designs to the German team, and requested further information to help their engineers overcome the problems with the Tornado intake, but Chief Engineer Talbot refused. According to Talbot, the Concorde engineers had determined the issue with the Tornado intake was that the engine did not respond to unexpected changes in the intake position, and therefore the engine was running at the wrong setting for a given position of the intake ramps. This was because the Concorde had similar issues due to control pressure not being high enough to maintain proper angles of the intake ramps. Aerodynamic forces could force the intakes into the improper position, and so they should have the ability to control the engines if this occurs. The Tornado intake system did not allow for this. Due to the behaviour of the German management team, the British engineers declined to share this information, and so the Tornado was not equipped with the more advanced intake design of the Concorde.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ted |last=Talbot |title=Concorde: A Designer's Life: The Journey to Mach 2 |chapter=17 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NuUTDQAAQBAJ |publisher=History Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0752489285}}</ref>

Testing revealed that a nose-wheel steering augmentation system, connecting with the [[yaw damper]], was necessary to counteract the destabilising effect produced by deploying the thrust reverser during the landing roll.<ref>Burger, Κ.Η.

==Design==

===Overview===
The Panavia Tornado is a multirole, twin-engined aircraft designed to excel at low-level penetration of enemy defences. The mission envisaged during the [[Cold War]] was the delivery of conventional and nuclear ordnance on the invading forces of the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries of Eastern Europe; this dictated several significant features of the design. Variable wing geometry allowed for minimal drag during the low-level dash towards a well-prepared enemy. Advanced navigation and flight computers, including the then-innovative [[fly-by-wire]] system, greatly reduced the workload of the pilot during low-level flight and eased control of the aircraft.<ref>Scutts 2000, pp. 53–55.</ref><ref name= 'Frédriksen 255'/> For long range missions, the Tornado has a retractable [[Probe and drogue|refuelling probe]].<ref>Jefford et al. 2002, p. 136.</ref>

As a multirole aircraft, the Tornado is capable of undertaking more mission profiles than the anticipated strike mission; various operators replaced multiple aircraft types with the Tornado as a common type&nbsp;– the use of dedicated single role aircraft for specialist purposes such as battlefield reconnaissance, maritime patrol duties, or dedicated electronic countermeasures (ECM) were phased out&nbsp;– either by standard Tornados or modified variants, such as the Tornado ECR. The most extensive modification from the base Tornado design was the Tornado ADV, which was stretched and armed with long range anti-aircraft missiles to serve in the interceptor role.<ref name='eagles 88-91'/>

Tornado operators have undertaken various life extension and upgrade programmes to keep their Tornado fleets as viable frontline aircraft. With these upgrades it is projected that the Tornado shall be in service until 2025, more than 50 years after the first prototype took flight.<ref name="AIjun07 p29"/>{{update inline|date=May 2020}}

===Variable-sweep wing===
{{further|variable-sweep wing}}
[[File:RIAS 2014 Tornado 01.jpg|thumb|Deployed swing wings]]

In order for the Tornado to perform well as a low-level supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and low-speed flight characteristics. To achieve high-speed performance, a [[swept wing|swept]] or [[delta wing|delta]] wing is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, the Tornado uses a variable-sweep wing.<ref name= 'jerr53'/> This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft, such as the American [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark]] strike fighter, and the Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]] fighter. The smaller Tornado has many similarities with the F-111, however the Tornado differs in being a multi-role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.<ref>Spick, Green and Swanborough 2001, p. 33.</ref>

The level of [[wing sweep]] (i.e. the angle of the wings in relation to the fuselage) can be altered in flight at the pilot's control. The variable wing can adopt any sweep angle between 25 degrees and 67 degrees, with a corresponding speed range for each angle. Some Tornado ADVs were outfitted with an automatic wing-sweep system to reduce pilot workload.<ref>Aeroguide 21 1988, p. 6.</ref> When the wings are swept back, the exposed [[wing loading|wing area]] is lowered and [[wave drag|drag]] is significantly decreased, which is conducive to performing high-speed low-level flight.<ref name= 'jerr53'/> The weapons pylons pivot with the angle of the variable-sweep wings so that the stores point in the direction of flight and do not hinder any wing positions.<ref name= 'jerr54'>Scutts 2000, p. 54.</ref><ref>Richardson 1986, p. 18.</ref>

In development, significant attention was given to the Tornado's short-field take-off and landing ([[STOL]]) performance. Germany, in particular, encouraged this design aspect.<ref>Lake 2002, p. 446.</ref> For shorter take-off and landing distances, the Tornado can sweep its wings forwards to the 25-degree position, and deploy its full-span [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] and [[leading edge slats]] to allow the aircraft to fly at slower speeds.<ref>Aeroguide 21 1988, pp. 2, 8.</ref> These features, in combination with the [[thrust reverser]]-equipped engines, give the Tornado excellent low-speed handling and landing characteristics.<ref>Aeroguide 21 1988, p. 2.</ref>

===Avionics===

The primary flight controls of the Tornado are a [[fly-by-wire]] hybrid, consisting of an analogue [[wikt:quadruplex|quadruplex]] Command and Stability Augmentation System (CSAS) connected to a digital Autopilot & Flight Director System (AFDS).<ref>Moir and Seabridge 2011, pp. 2, 23.</ref> In addition a level of mechanical reversion capacity was retained to safeguard against potential failure.<ref>Moir and Seabridge 2011, pp. 2, 22.</ref> To enhance pilot awareness, [[Aircraft flight control system#Artificial feel devices|artificial feel]] was built into the flight controls, such as the centrally located [[Joystick#Aviation|stick]].

[[File:Luftwaffe GR-4 Tornado undergoing maintenance during Cooperative Cope Thunder 2004.JPEG|thumb|left|A German Air Force Tornado ''43+46'' undergoing maintenance in July 2004]]
The Tornado incorporates a combined navigation/attack [[Doppler radar]] that simultaneously scans for targets and conducts fully automated [[terrain following radar|terrain-following]] for low-level flight operations. Being able to conduct all-weather hands-off low-level flight was considered one of the core advantages of the Tornado.<ref>Ministry of Defence 2006, p. 18.</ref> The Tornado ADV had a different radar system to other variants, designated [[AI.24 Foxhunter]], as it is designed for [[air defence]] operations. It was capable of tracking up to 20 targets at ranges of up to {{convert|100|mi|km|sigfig=2|order=flip}}.<ref name= 'Frédriksen 255'/> The Tornado was one of the earliest aircraft to be fitted with a [[Bus (computing)|digital data bus]] for data transmission. A Link 16 JTIDS integration on the F3 variant enabled the exchange of radar and other sensory information with nearby friendly aircraft.<ref>Moir and Seabridge 2011, pp. 447–448.</ref>

Some Tornado variants carry different avionics and equipment, depending on their mission. The Tornado ECR operated by Germany and Italy is devoted to [[Suppression of Enemy Air Defences]] (SEAD) missions. The Tornado ECR is equipped with an emitter-locator system (ELS) to detect radar use.<ref name=janes_237>Jackson et al. 1998, p. 237.</ref> German ECRs have a [[Honeywell]] infrared imaging system for reconnaissance flights.<ref>Jackson et al. 1998, pp. 240–241.</ref> RAF and RSAF Tornados have the [[Laser]] Range Finder and Marked Target Seekers (LRMTS) for targeting [[laser-guided]] munitions.<ref>Whitaker, Richard.

===Armament and equipment===
The Tornado is cleared to carry the majority of air-launched weapons in the [[NATO]] inventory, including various [[Gravity bomb|unguided]] and [[laser-guided bomb]]s, [[anti-ship missile|anti-ship]] and [[anti-radiation missile]]s, as well as specialised weapons such as [[anti-personnel mine]]s and [[anti-runway]] munitions.<ref name="evans pp66-8"/><ref name="Corde_298"/><ref name=granby_raf>[http://www.raf.mod.uk/gulf/raf_ac.html#torngr1 "RAF Tornado Aircraft Deployments in Operation Granby."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027033641/http://www.raf.mod.uk/gulf/raf_ac.html#torngr1 |date=27 October 2008 }} ''Royal Air Force''.

In the decades since the Tornado's introduction, all of the Tornado operators have undertaken various upgrade and modification programmes to allow new weapons to be used by their squadrons. Amongst the armaments that the Tornado has been adapted to deploy are the [[Paveway|Enhanced Paveway]] and [[Joint Direct Attack Munition]] bombs, and modern [[cruise missiles]] such as the [[KEPD 350|Taurus]] and [[Storm Shadow (missile)|Storm Shadow]] missiles. These upgrades have increased the Tornado's capabilities and combat accuracy.<ref name=Corde_298>Cordesman 2003, p. 298.</ref><ref name=fi_assta2/><ref name=defpro_jdam/> Precision weapons such as cruise missiles have replaced older munitions such as [[cluster bomb]]s.<ref>Norton-Taylor, Richard.

Strike variants have a limited air-to-air capability with [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] or [[AIM-132 ASRAAM]] [[air-to-air missile]]s (AAMs). The Tornado ADV was outfitted with [[beyond visual range]] AAMs such as the [[Skyflash]] and [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] missiles.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_26_217/ai_n28996410/ "Britain Deploying ASRAAM-Equipped Tornado Fighters To Middle East."] ''Defense Daily,'' 10 February 2003.</ref><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1986/1986%20-%200336.html "World Missile Forces."] ''Flight International,'' 8 February 1986, p. 46.</ref> The Tornado is armed with two {{convert|27|mm|abbr=on|3}} [[Mauser BK-27]] [[revolver cannon]] internally mounted underneath the fuselage; the Tornado ADV was only armed with one cannon.<ref name='eagles 88-91'/> When the RAF GR1 aircraft were converted to GR4, the FLIR sensor replaced the left hand cannon, leaving only one;<ref name="AIAp08 p25">Lake ''Air International'' April 2008, p. 25.</ref> the GR1A reconnaissance variant gave up both its guns to make space for the sideways looking infra-red sensors.<ref name="evans p98-9"/> The Mauser BK-27 was developed specifically for the Tornado, but has since been used on several other European fighters, such as the [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet]], [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen]], and [[Eurofighter Typhoon]].<ref name="JAH">[http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Ammunition-Handbook/27-x-145-B-ammunition-Switzerland.html "27 x 145 B ammunition (Switzerland), Cannon&nbsp;– 20 to 30 mm cannon."] [[Jane's Information Group]], 27 October 2011.</ref>

The Tornado is capable of delivering air-launched [[nuclear weapon]]s. In 1979, Britain considered replacing its [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarines with either the [[Trident missile|Trident]] submarines or the Tornado as the main bearer of its [[nuclear deterrent]].<ref>Middleton, Drew.

===Engine===
{{main|Turbo-Union RB199}}

Britain considered the selection of [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] to develop the advanced engine for the MRCA to be essential, and was strongly opposed to adopting an engine from an American manufacturer, to the point where the UK might have withdrawn over the issue.<ref>Jefford et al. 2002, pp. 26, 50.</ref> In September 1969, Rolls-Royce's [[Turbo-Union RB199|RB199]] engine was selected to power the MRCA. One advantage over the US competition was that a [[technology transfer]] between the partner nations had been agreed; the engine was to be developed and manufactured by a joint company, [[Turbo-Union]].<ref name= 'jef 50'>Jefford et al. 2002, p. 50.</ref> The programme was delayed by Rolls-Royce's entry into receivership in 1971. however the nature of the multinational collaboration process helped avoid major disruption of the Tornado programme.<ref name= 'jef 51'>Jefford et al. 2002, p. 51.</ref> Research from the [[supersonic airliner]] [[Concorde]] contributed to the development and final design of the RB199 and of the engine control units.<ref>Moir and Seabridge 2011, pp. 65–66.</ref>

[[File:RB199 Cosford.JPG|thumb|left|RB199 on static display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford]]]]
To operate efficiently across a wide range of conditions and speeds up to Mach 2, the RB199 and several other engines make use of [[intake ramp|variable intake ramp]]s to control the air flow.<ref>Moir and Seabridge 2011, p. 58.</ref> The hydraulic system is pressurised by syphoning power from both or either operational engine; the hydraulics are completely contained within the airframe rather than integrating with the engine to improve safety and maintainability.<ref>Moir and Seabridge 2011, p. 162.</ref> In case of double-engine, or double-generator, failure, the Tornado has a single-use battery capable of operating the fuel pump and hydraulics for up to 13 minutes.<ref>Moir and Seabridge 2011, p. 306.</ref>

Relatively rarely among fighter aircraft, the RB199 is fitted with [[thrust reverser]]s to decrease the distance required to safely land.<ref name= 'Frédriksen 255'/><ref>[http://www.turbounion.co.uk/index.php?page=technology.html "Turbo-Union: Engine Description."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320041655/http://www.turbounion.co.uk/index.php?page=technology.html |date=20 March 2012 }} ''turbounion.co.uk.''

In April 2020, Germany announced its replacement for its Tornado aircraft will be a split purchase of 30 [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18E/F Super Hornets]], 15 EA-18G Growlers and 55 Eurofighter Typhoons.<ref name=flightintgermany>[https://www.flightglobal.com/fixed-wing/germany-picks-super-hornet-and-more-eurofighters-for-tornado-replacement/138003.article Germany picks Super Hornet and more Eurofighters for Tornado replacement]</ref> The Super Hornet was selected due to its compatibility with nuclear weapons and availability of an electronic attack version. As of March 2020, the Super Hornet is not certified for the [[B61 nuclear bomb]]s, but Dan Gillian, head of Boeing's Super Hornet program, previously stated that "We certainly think that we, working with the U.S. government, can meet the German requirements there on the [German's] timeline."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Trevithick |first1=Joseph |title=Here's Where Boeing Aims To Take The Super Hornet In The Decades To Come |url=https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/27272/heres-where-boeing-aims-to-take-the-super-hornet-in-the-decades-to-come |website=The War Zone |access-date=31 March 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190710054444/https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/27272/heres-where-boeing-aims-to-take-the-super-hornet-in-the-decades-to-come |archive-date=10 July 2019 |date=3 April 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In addition to the order made by the ''Luftwaffe'', the [[German Navy]]'s ''[[Marineflieger]]'' also received 112 of the IDS variant in the anti-shipping and marine reconnaissance roles, again replacing the Starfighter. These equipped two wings, each with a nominal strength of 48 aircraft. The principal anti-ship weapon was the [[AS.34 Kormoran]] [[anti-ship missile]], which were initially supplemented by unguided bombs and [[BL755]] [[cluster munition]]s, and later by [[AGM-88 HARM]] [[anti-radar missile]]s. Pods fitted with panoramic optical cameras and an infrared line scan were carried for the reconnaissance mission.<ref name="WAPJ32 p132">Lake ''World Air Power Journal'' Volume 32, p. 132.</ref>

The end of the Cold War and the signing of the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe|CFE Treaty]] gave rise to a requirement for Germany to reduce the size of its armed forces, including the number of combat aircraft. To meet this need, one of the ''Marineflieger'''s Tornado wings was disbanded on 1 January 1994; its aircraft replaced the Phantoms of a Luftwaffe reconnaissance wing.<ref name="Evans p94">Evans 1999, p. 94.</ref><ref name="WAPJ32 p129,2">Lake ''World Air Power Journal'' Volume 32, pp. 129, 132.</ref> The second wing was enlarged and continued in the anti-shipping, reconnaissance and anti-radar roles until it was disbanded in 2005 with its aircraft and duties passed on to the Luftwaffe.<ref>Wertheim 2007, p. 242.</ref>

The first Italian prototype made its maiden flight on 5 December 1975 from [[Turin]], Italy.

In 2000, with major delays hampering the Eurofighter, the Aeronautica Militare began a search for another interim fighter. While the Tornado itself was considered, any long term extension to the lease would have involved upgrade to RAF CSP standard and thus was not considered cost effective. In February 2001, Italy announced its arrangement to lease 35 F-16s from the United States under the PEACE CAESAR programme.<ref>"Italy to lease 35 F-16 jets from USA until Eurofighter operational".

The UK sent out a detachment of [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] aircraft equipped with [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] [[Pave Spike]] laser designators, allowing Tornado GR1s to drop precision guided weapons guided by the Buccaneers. A planned programme to fit GR1s with the [[GEC-Marconi]] [[TIALD]] laser designation system was rapidly accelerated to give the Tornado force the ability to self-designate targets. Author Claus-Christian Szejnmann declared that the TIALD pod enabled the GR1 to "achieve probably the most accurate bombing in the RAF's history".<ref name="evans pp66-8">Evans 1999, pp. 66–68.</ref><ref>Szejnmann 2009, p. 217.</ref> Although laser designation proved effective in the Gulf War, only 23 TIALD pods had been purchased by 2000; shortages hindered combat operations over Kosovo.<ref>Szejnmann 2009, p. 223.</ref>

It was the first time since [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991 that the Royal Saudi Air Force participated in a military operation over hostile territory.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/33670149 "Saudis bomb Yemen rebels across border."] ''Associated Press,'' 5 November 2009.</ref> Saudi Air Force Tornados are playing a central role in [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen]].<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/11584269/Saudis-UK-made-war-jets-outnumber-RAFs.html |title=Saudis' UK-made war jets outnumber RAF's |date= 5 May 2015 |work= The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

On 7 January 2018, [[Houthis|Houthi fighters]] claimed to have shot down a Saudi warplane which was conducting air-raids over northern Yemen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://muraselon.com/en/2018/01/breaking-houthi-rebels-shoot-saudi-tornado-warplane-north-yemen/|title=Breaking: Houthi rebels shoot down Saudi Tornado warplane in north Yemen - Muraselon|date=7 January 2018}}</ref> According to Saudi reports, the downed aircraft was a Tornado of the Royal Saudi Air Force which was on a combat mission in the skies over [[Saada Governorate|Saada province]] in northern Yemen. Saudi reports said that it was lost for 'technical reasons' and that both crew were rescued.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Saudi warplane crashes in Yemen; pilots escape |date=7 January 2018 |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera]] |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/saudi-warplane-crashes-yemen-pilots-escape-180107182349027.html}}</ref>

In the night of 14 February 2020, a Saudi Tornado was shot down during [[close air support]] mission in support of Saudi allied Yemeni forces in the Yemeni Al Jouf governorate by Houthis. On the day after, the Saudi command confirmed the loss of a Tornado, while video evidence was released showing the downing using a two-stage surface to air missile. Both pilots ejected and were captured by Houthis.<ref>https://iranpress.com/en/middle_east-i143899-saudi_coalition_confirms_tornado_pilots_captured_by_yemeni_armed_forces</ref>

;Tornado GR1
RAF IDS (interdictor/strike) variants were initially designated the [[British military aircraft designation systems|Tornado GR1]] with later modified aircraft designated Tornado GR1A, Tornado GR1B, Tornado GR4 and Tornado GR4A. The first of 228 GR1s was delivered on 5 June 1979, and the type entered service in the early 1980s.

;Tornado GR1B
The Tornado GR1B was a specialised anti-shipping variant of the GR1, replacing the [[Blackburn Buccaneer]]. 26 aircraft were converted and were based at [[RAF Lossiemouth]], Scotland.<ref name="WAPJ30 p117">Lake ''World Air Power Journal'' Volume 30, p. 117.</ref> Each aircraft was equipped to carry up to four [[Sea Eagle (missile)|Sea Eagle]] anti-ship missiles.<ref name="lame" /> At first the GR1B lacked the radar capability to track shipping, instead relying on the missile's seeker for target acquisition, later updates allowed target data to be fed from aircraft to missile.<ref name="WAPJ33 p105">Donald ''World Air Power Journal'' Volume 33, p. 105.</ref>

;Tornado GR4
The UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] began studies for a GR1 Mid-Life Update (MLU) in 1984.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Flight International World Aircraft and Systems Directory |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |page=187 |date=2001 |isbn=0-617-01289-X}}

</ref> The update to GR4 standard, approved in 1994, would improve capability in the medium-altitude role based on lessons learned from the GR1's performance in the 1991 Gulf War. British Aerospace (later BAE Systems) upgraded 142 Tornado GR1s to GR4 standard, beginning in 1996 and finished in 2003.<ref name =BAE_GR4_up/> 59 RAF aircraft later received the CUSP avionics package which integrated the Paveway IV bomb and installed a new secure communications module from Cassidian in Phase A,<ref name=Fish20140716/><ref name=Hoyle20080109 /> followed by the Tactical Information Exchange (TIE) datalink from General Dynamics in Phase B.<ref name=Fish20140716/><ref name=Hoyle20080109 />

;Tornado GR1A/GR4A
The GR1A is the reconnaissance variant operated by the RAF and RSAF, fitted with the TIRRS (Tornado Infra-Red Reconnaissance System), replacing the cannon.<ref name="evans p98-9">Evans 1999, pp. 98–99.</ref> The RAF ordered 30 GR1As, 14 as GR1 rebuilds and 16 as new-builds.<ref name="evans p97">Evans 1999, p. 97.</ref> When the Tornado GR1s were upgraded to become GR4s, GR1A aircraft were upgraded to GR4A standard.<ref name="AIAp08 p24">Lake ''Air International'' April 2008, p. 24.</ref> The switch from low-level operations to medium/high-level operations means that the internal TIRRS was no longer used.<ref name="AIAp08 p28">Lake ''Air International'' April 2008, p. 28.</ref> As the GR4A's internal sensors are no longer essential, the RAF's Tactical Reconnaissance Wing operate both GR4A and GR4 aircraft.<ref>[http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafmarham/aboutus/iiacsqnhistorycurrent.cfm "II (AC) Squadron History&nbsp;– Current."] ''Royal Air Force,'' Retrieved: 4 December 2011.</ref>

==={{anchor|Tornado ECR|ECR}} Tornado ECR===
Operated by Germany and Italy, the ECR (Electronic Combat / Reconnaissance) is a Tornado variant devoted to [[Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]] (SEAD) missions. It was first delivered on 21 May 1990. The ECR has sensors to detect radar usage and is equipped with anti-radiation [[AGM-88 HARM]] missiles.<ref name=janes_237/> The Luftwaffe's 35 ECRs were delivered new, while Italy received 16 converted IDSs. Italian Tornado ECRs differ from the Luftwaffe aircraft as they lack built-in reconnaissance capability and use RecceLite reconnaissance pods. Further, only Luftwaffe ECRs are equipped with RB199 Mk.105 engine, which has a higher thrust rating.<ref name=Janes_241>Jackson et al. 1998, p. 241.</ref> The German ECRs do not carry a cannon.<ref>Davies, Steve. "German SEAD: The Tornado ECRs of JaBoG 32." ''[[AirForces Monthly]]'', March 2003, p. 32.</ref> The RAF used the IDS version in the SEAD role instead of the ECR and also modified several of its Tornado F.3s to undertake the mission.<ref name=EF3>{{cite web|url= http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/tornadof3.cfm|title= Tornado F3|publisher= Royal Air Force|access-date= 26 March 2008|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080314040710/http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/tornadof3.cfm|archive-date= 14 March 2008|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

===Tornado ADV===
{{main|Panavia Tornado ADV}}
The Tornado ADV (air defence variant) was an [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] variant of the Tornado, developed for the RAF (designated Tornado F2 or F3) and also operated by Saudi Arabia and Italy. The ADV had inferior agility to fighters like the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]],<ref>Haglund 1989, p. 70.</ref> but it was not intended as a dogfighter, but rather it was a long-endurance interceptor to counter the threat from Cold War bombers.<ref name= 'eagles'>Eagles 1991, p. 88.</ref> Although the ADV had 80% parts commonality with the Tornado IDS, the ADV had greater acceleration, improved RB199 Mk.104 engines, a stretched body, greater fuel capacity, the [[AI.24 Foxhunter]] radar, and software changes. It had only one cannon to accommodate a retractable [[inflight refuelling|inflight refuelling probe]].<ref name='eagles 88-91'>Eagles 1991, pp. 88–91.</ref><ref name='turbounion'>[http://www.turbounion.co.uk/ "Turbo-Union: The Power for Peace and Freedom."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918111713/http://www.turbounion.co.uk/ |date=18 September 2011 }} ''turbounion.co.uk.''
