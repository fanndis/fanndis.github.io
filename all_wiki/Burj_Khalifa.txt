The '''Burj Khalifa''' ({{lang-ar|برج خليفة}}, {{IPA-ar|bʊrd͡ʒ xaˈliːfa}}; pronounced {{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|b|ɝ|dʒ|_|k|ə|'|l|i:|f|ə|}}, literally "Khalifa Tower" in English), known as the '''Burj Dubai''' prior to its inauguration in 2010, is a [[skyscraper]] in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], but including a 244 m spire<ref name="Vanity"/>) of {{convert|828|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, the Burj Khalifa has been the [[List of tallest structures|tallest structure]] and [[List of tallest buildings|building]] in the world since its [[topping out]] in 2009 (preceded by [[Taipei 101]]).<ref name="CTBUHdb">{{cite web|url=http://skyscrapercenter.com/building/burj-khalifa/3 |title=Burj Khalifa – The Skyscraper Center |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat}}</ref><ref name="DubaiOneInauguration" />

Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is [[reinforced concrete]]. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called [[Downtown Dubai]]. It is designed to be the centrepiece of large-scale, [[mixed-use development]]. The decision to construct the building is based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building was originally named ''Burj Dubai'' but was renamed in honour of the ruler of [[Abu Dhabi]] and president of the United Arab Emirates, [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]];<ref name="USAtoday">{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/01/dubai-opens-world-tallest-building/1|title=Dubai opens world's tallest building|date=2 January 2010|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|access-date=4 January 2010|location=[[Dubai]]|first=Douglas|last=Stanglin}}</ref> Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the [[List of tallest buildings|tallest building]] in the world.

Burj Khalifa was designed by [[Adrian Smith (architect)|Adrian Smith]], of [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]], whose firm designed the [[Willis Tower]] and [[One World Trade Center]]. [[Hyder Consulting]] was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived from the [[Islamic architecture]] of the region, such as in the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]]. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A [[buttressed core|buttressed central core and wings]] are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from [[Samsung Tower Palace 3 – Tower G|Tower Palace III]], the Burj Khalifa's central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs within each of the wings.<ref name="academic.csuohio.edu">{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=William|last2=Pawlikowski|first2=James|title=Higher and Higher: The Evolution of the Buttressed Core|url=http://academic.csuohio.edu/duffy_s/CVE_601_Struct_1.pdf|website=academic.csuohio.edu|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref> The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.

At a certain point in the architectural and engineering process, the original Emaar developers experienced financial problems, and required more money and economic funding. [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan|Sheikh Khalifa]], the ruler of the United Arab Emirates, granted monetary aid and funding, hence resulting in the changing of the name to "Burj Khalifa". The concept of profitability derived from building high density developments and malls around the landmark have proven successful. Its surrounding malls, hotels and condominiums in Downtown Dubai have generated the most revenue from the project as a whole, while the Burj Khalifa itself made little or no profit.<ref name="constructionweekaugust13kingdombeckons">{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-13535-the-kingdom-beckons/|title=The Kingdom beckons|author=Hope, Gerhard|date=13 August 2011|publisher=ConstructionWeekOnline|access-date=13 August 2011}}</ref><ref name="bdonlineaugust16">{{cite web|url=http://bdonline.co.uk/5022966.article?|title=Should the Kingdom Tower be built?|date=16 August 2011|publisher=bdonline.com|access-date=16 August 2011}}</ref>

Critical reception to Burj Khalifa has been generally positive, and the building has received many awards. However, there were numerous complaints concerning migrant workers from [[South Asia]] who were the primary building labor force. These centered on low wages and the practice of confiscating passports until duties were complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archi-ninja.com/burj-khalifa-dubai-the-truth-behind-the-bling/|title=Burj Khalifa (Dubai) – The Truth Behind the Bling – Archi-Ninja}}</ref> Several suicides were reported.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/27/dubai-migrant-worker-deaths|title=Dubai's skyscrapers, stained by the blood of migrant workers|date=27 May 2011|via=The Guardian}}</ref>

== Development ==
Construction began on 6 January 2004, with the exterior of the structure completed on 1 October 2009.

== Conception ==
Burj Khalifa was designed to be the centerpiece of a large-scale, mixed-use development to include 30,000 homes {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}, nine hotels (including [[The Address Downtown Dubai]]), {{convert|3|ha|acre|1}} of parkland, at least 19 residential skyscrapers, the [[Dubai Mall]], and the {{convert|12|ha|acre|adj=on}} artificial Burj Khalifa Lake. The decision to build Burj Khalifa was reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy to one that is service and tourism based. According to officials, it was necessary for projects like Burj Khalifa to be built in order to garner more international recognition, and hence investment. "He (Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]]) wanted to put Dubai on the map with something really sensational," said Jacqui Josephson, a tourism and VIP delegations executive at [[Nakheel Properties]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/13/world/fg-dubai13|title=In Dubai, the Sky's No Limit|last=Stack|first=Megan|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=13 October 2005|access-date=26 March 2006}}</ref> The tower was known as Burj Dubai ("Dubai Tower") until its official opening in January 2010.<ref name="name change"/> It was renamed in honour of the ruler of [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]], [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]]; Abu Dhabi and the federal government of UAE lent Dubai tens of billions of US dollars so that Dubai could pay its debts – Dubai borrowed at least $80 billion for construction projects.<ref name="name change">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jan2010/gb2010015_736675.htm |title=Dubai Tower's Name Reflects U.A.E.

=== History of height increases ===
[[File:BurjKhalifaHeight.png|450px|thumb|Burj Khalifa compared with some other well-known tall structures]]
There are unconfirmed reports of several planned height increases since its inception. Originally proposed as a virtual clone of the {{convert|560|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Grollo Tower]] proposal for Melbourne, Australia's [[Melbourne Docklands|Docklands waterfront development]], the tower was redesigned by [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/26/1046064104215.html|title= Grollo tower to go ahead, in Dubai|newspaper=[[The Age]] |first=Paul|last=Robinson|date=27 February 2003|access-date=6 January 2010 | location=Melbourne, Australia}}</ref> [[Marshall Strabala]], a Skidmore, Owings and Merrill architect who worked on the project until 2006, said in late 2008 that Burj Khalifa was designed to be {{convert|808|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.<ref name="Height Revealed">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/540205-secret-of-burj-dubai-height-revealed|title=Architect reveals Burj Dubai height|magazine=[[Arabian Business]]|date=3 December 2008|access-date=3 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204001714/http://www.arabianbusiness.com/540205-secret-of-burj-dubai-height-revealed|archive-date=4 December 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The architect who designed it, Adrian Smith, felt that the uppermost section of the building did not culminate elegantly with the rest of the structure, so he sought and received approval to increase its height.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} It was stated that this change did not add any floors, which fit with Smith's attempts to make the crown more slender.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://cityscape-online.com/PDF/CityScape_Daily_Day_2.pdf |title= Cityscape Daily News |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090329053555/http://cityscape-online.com/PDF/CityScape_Daily_Day_2.pdf |archive-date= 29 March 2009 |df= dmy-all }}&nbsp;(264&nbsp;KB) ''Cityscape'', 18 September 2005.

=== Ramadan observance ===
On the higher floors, the sun can still be seen for several minutes after it has set at ground level. This has led Dubai clerics to rule that those living above the 80th floor should wait 2 additional minutes to break their [[Ramadan]] fast, and those living above the 150th floor, 3 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|author=BBC Staff |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14437334 |title=Dubai Burj Khalifa: Ramadan fast 'lasts longer high up' |publisher=BBC.com |access-date=20 February 2017}}</ref>

The primary structure is reinforced concrete. [[Putzmeister]] created a new, super high-pressure trailer [[concrete pump]], the BSA 14000 SHP-D, for this project.<ref name="Putzmeister"/> Burj Khalifa's construction used {{convert|330000|m3|cuyd|-2|abbr=on}} of concrete and {{convert|55000|t|ST LT}} of steel [[rebar]], and construction took 22&nbsp;million man-hours.<ref name="Record High" /> In May 2008 Putzmeister pumped concrete with more than 21 MPA ultimate compressive strength of gravel to surpass the 600 meters weight of the effective area of each column from the foundation to the next fourth level, and the rest was by metal columns ''jacketed'' or ''covered'' with concrete to a then world record delivery height of {{convert|606|m|ft|0|abbr=on}},<ref name="Putzmeister"/> the 156th floor. Three [[tower crane]]s were used during construction of the uppermost levels, each capable of lifting a 25-tonne load.<ref>{{cite news|last=Croucher |first=Martin |title=Myth of ‘Babu Sassi’ Remains After Burj Cranes Come Down |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/theuae/2009/November/theuae_November338.xml&section=theuae&col= |access-date=3 June 2011 |newspaper=[[Khaleej Times]] |date=11 November 2009}}</ref> The remaining structure above was constructed of lighter steel.

In 2003, 33 test holes were drilled to study the strength of the [[bedrock]] underlying the structure.<ref name=GeoMarc/> ''"Weak to very weak sandstone and siltstone"'' was found, just metres below the surface.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Samples were taken from test holes drilled to a depth of 140 metres, finding weak to very weak rock all the way.<ref name="GeoPrac2010-01-04"/> The study described the site as part of a ''"seismically active area"''.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Another challenging element was the [[Shamal (wind)|shamal]] which often creates sandstorms.<ref name=”dupre” />

Over {{convert|45000|m3|cuyd|-2|abbr=on}} of concrete, weighing more than {{convert|110000|t|ST LT|lk=on}} were used to construct the concrete and steel foundation, which features 192 piles; each pile is 1.5 metre in diameter by 43 m in length, buried more than {{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name="Emporis" /> The foundation was designed to support the total building weight of approximately {{convert|450000|t|ST LT|lk=on}}. This weight was then divided by the compressive strength of concrete of which is 30 MPa which yielded a 450 sq.meters of vertical normal effective area, which then yielded to a 12 meters by 12 meters dimensions.<ref name="VanHamptonApril2008">{{cite journal|last=Van Hampton|first=Tudor|date=2 April 2008|title=Clyde N.

The Burj Khalifa is highly compartmentalised.

Special mixes of concrete were made to withstand the extreme pressures of the massive building weight; as is typical with reinforced concrete construction, each batch of concrete was tested to ensure it could withstand certain pressures. [[CTLGroup]], working for Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, conducted the creep and shrinkage testing critical for the structural analysis of the building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctlgroup.com/ClientsAndProjects/Project/Detail/220 |title=Clients & Projects – Burj Khalifa, the Tallest Building in the World |publisher=CTLGroup |access-date=29 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708212424/http://www.ctlgroup.com/ClientsAndProjects/Project/Detail/220 |archive-date=8 July 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The consistency of the concrete used in the project was essential. It was difficult to create a concrete that could withstand both the thousands of tonnes bearing down on it and [[Persian Gulf]] temperatures that can reach {{convert|50|C|F|0|abbr=on}}. To combat this problem, the concrete was not poured during the day. Instead, during the summer months, ice was added to the mixture and it was poured at night when the air was cooler and the humidity was higher. Cooler concrete cures more evenly and is therefore less likely to set too quickly and crack. Any significant cracks could have put the entire project in jeopardy.<ref name="Al-Tayyib1989">{{cite journal|last1=Al-Tayyib|first1=A.J.|last2=Baluch|first2=M.H.|last3=Sharif|first3=Al-Farabi M.|last4=Mahamud|first4=M.M.|title=The effect of thermal cycling on the durability of concrete made from local materials in the Arabian Gulf countries|journal=Cement and Concrete Research|volume=19|issue=1|year=1989|pages=131–142|issn=00088846|doi=10.1016/0008-8846(89)90073-2}}</ref><ref name="Ji2009">{{cite journal|last1=Ji|first1=Jun|last2=Elnashai|first2=Amr S.|last3=Kuchma|first3=Daniel A.|title=Seismic fragility relationships of reinforced concrete high-rise buildings|journal=The Structural Design of Tall and Special Buildings|volume=18|issue=3|year=2009|pages=259–277|issn=15417794|doi=10.1002/tal.408}}</ref><ref name="Gjørv2011">{{cite journal|last1=Gjørv|first1=Odd E.|title=Durability of concrete structures|journal=Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering|volume=36|issue=2|year=2011|pages=151–172|issn=1319-8025|doi=10.1007/s13369-010-0033-5}}</ref><ref name="Friedman2018">{{cite web| last1=Friedman| first1=Daniel| year=2018 | title=Effects of curing temperature on concrete: shrinkage cracks and spalling concrete| url=https://inspectapedia.com/structure/Effect-of-Temperature-on-Concrete.php| access-date= 2020-09-13}}</ref><ref name="Bester2013">{{cite journal|last1=Bester| first1=Nicholas| year=2013| title=Concrete for high-rise buildings: Performance requirements, mix design and construction considerations| journal=Structural Concrete Properties and Practice| pages=1–4}}</ref>

In March 2009, [[Mohamed Ali Alabbar]], chairman of the project's developer, [[Emaar Properties]], said office space pricing at Burj Khalifa reached US$4,000 per sq ft (over US$43,000 per m²) and the [[Armani Residences]], also in Burj Khalifa, sold for US$3,500 per sq ft (over US$37,500 per m²).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20080305042540 |title=Burj Dubai offices to top US$4,000 per sq ft |publisher=Zawya |date=5 March 2008 |access-date=23 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810010114/http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20080305042540 |archive-date=10 August 2011 }}</ref> He estimated the total cost for the project to be about US$1.5&nbsp;billion.<ref name="USAtoday" />

The project's completion coincided with the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], and with vast overbuilding in the country, leading to high vacancies and foreclosures.<ref name="monument">{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/01/the-burj-dubai-and-architectures-vacant-stare.html|title=The Burj Dubai and architecture's vacant stare|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=4 January 2010 | date=1 January 2010| author=Christopher Hawthorne}}</ref> With Dubai mired in debt from its huge ambitions, the government was forced to seek multibillion dollar bailouts from its oil-rich neighbor [[Abu Dhabi]].

Because of the [[Real estate bubble|slumping demand]] in Dubai's property market, the rents in the Burj Khalifa plummeted 40% some ten months after its opening.
