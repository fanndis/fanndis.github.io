The '''United States Department of Housing and Urban Development''' ('''HUD''') is a [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] department in the executive branch of the United States [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. Although its beginnings were in the House and Home Financing Agency, it was founded as a Cabinet department in 1965, as part of the "[[Great Society]]" program of President [[Lyndon Johnson]], to develop and execute policies on housing and metropolises.

==History==
The department was established on September 9, 1965, when [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act<ref>{{USPL|89|174}}</ref> into law. It stipulated that the department was to be created no later than November 8, sixty days following the date of enactment. The actual implementation was postponed until January 14, 1966, following the completion of a special study group report on the federal role in solving urban problems.

HUD is administered by the [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]]. Its headquarters is located in the [[Robert C. Weaver Federal Building]].  Some important milestones for HUD's development include:<ref>[http://www.hud.gov/basic.cfm Basic Congressional and Presidential Actions Establishing Major HUD-related Programs] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20010715083305/http://www.hud.gov/basic.cfm |date=2001-07-15 }}.

===Office of Inspector General===
The [[United States Congress]] enacted the [[Inspector General Act of 1978]] to ensure integrity and efficiency in government. The Inspector General is appointed by the President and subject to Senate confirmation. The Inspector General is responsible for conducting and supervising audits, investigations, and inspections relating to the programs and operations of HUD. The OIG is to examine, evaluate and, where necessary, critique these operations and activities, recommending ways for the Department to carry out its responsibilities in the most effective, efficient, and economical manner possible.

The mission of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) is to:<ref>[http://www.hudoig.gov/about/mission.php "OIG Mission Statement"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927231341/http://www.hudoig.gov/about/mission.php |date=2012-09-27 }} HUD Office of the Inspector General</ref>
* Promote the integrity, efficiency and effectiveness of HUD programs and operations to assist the Department in meeting its mission
* Detect and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse
* Seek administrative sanctions, civil recoveries and/ or criminal prosecution of those responsible for waste, fraud and abuse in HUD programs and operations

The OIG accomplishes its mission by conducting investigations pertinent to its activities; by keeping Congress, the Secretary, and the public fully informed of its activities, and by working with staff (in this case of HUD) in achieving success of its objectives and goals.
David A. Montoya, who was sworn in on December 1, 2011, is the current Inspector General.<ref>[http://www.hudoig.gov/about/principalstaff.php "OIG Key Principal Staff"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927231402/http://www.hudoig.gov/about/principalstaff.php |date=2012-09-27 }} HUD Office of the Inspector General</ref><ref>[http://www.hudoig.gov/about/bio_montoya.php "OIG Senior Staff Bios  - David A.

The 203(k) program offers low down payment loans to primary resident owner occupants or nonprofit groups to buy and renovate a house.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

One of the most successful HUD programs over the years has been the Multifamily Housing Service Coordinator Program. Each year since 1992, HUD has included in its Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA), a specific allocation of dollars to allow sponsors and owners of HUD multifamily housing for the elderly the opportunity to hire a Service Coordinator. The Service Coordinator provides case management and coordinative services to elderly residents, particularly to those who are "frail" and "at-risk" allowing them to remain in their current residence. As a result, thousands of senior citizens throughout the United States have been given the opportunity to continue to live independently instead of in an institutional facility such as a nursing home. Professional organizations such as the American Association of Service Coordinators provide support to HUD Service Coordinator through education, training, networking and advocacy.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

HUD has experimented with [[Enterprise Zone]]s granting economic incentives to economically depressed urban areas, but this function has largely been taken over by states.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Due to HUD's lending practices, it occasionally takes possession of a home when a lender it insures forecloses. Such properties are then generally sold off to the highest bidder through the [[HUD auction]] process. Buyers of HUD homes as their primary residences who make a full-price offer to HUD using [[Federal Housing Administration|FHA]]-insured mortgage financing receive seller concessions from HUD enabling them to use only a $100 down payment.

HUD Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing [[Roberta Achtenberg]] has been quoted as saying "...HUD walks a tightrope between free speech and fair housing.  We are ever mindful of the need to maintain the proper balance between these rights." Libertarian critic [[James Bovard]] commented that, "The more aggressive HUD becomes, the fewer free speech rights Americans have. Many words and phrases are now effectively forbidden in real estate ads. ... Apparently, there are two separate versions of the Bill of Rights -- one for private citizens and the other for federal bureaucrats and politicians".<ref>{{cite book | author=[[James Bovard]] | year= 2000 | title= Feeling Your Pain: The Explosion and Abuse Of Government Power in the Clinton-Gore Years | publisher= St. Martin's Press | location= New York | id=0-312-23082-6 | pages= 167, 175, 176}}</ref>

In 2006, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' called HUD "New York City's worst landlord" and "the #1 worst in the United States" based upon decrepit conditions of buildings and questionable eviction practices.<ref name="villagevoice"/>

In September 2010, HUD started auctioning off delinquent home mortgage loans, defined as at least 90 days past due, to the highest bidder. It sold 2,000 loans in six national auctions. In 2012, this sale was massively increased under a "Distressed Asset Stabilization Program" (DASP), and the 100,000 loans sold as of 2014 have netted 8.8 billion for the FHA, rebuilding cash reserves that had been depleted by loan defaults. The second stated and eponymous objective is to stabilize communities, by requiring purchasers to service the loans in a manner that stabilizes the surrounding communities by getting the loans to re-perform, renting the home to the borrower, gifting the property to a land bank or paying off the loans in full.<ref name=aljaz>{{cite news|author1=Mark Kurlyandchik|title=Feds accused of selling out neighborhoods to Wall St. firms|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/fault-lines/FaultLinesBlog/2014/9/9/feds-accused-of-sellingoutneighborhoodstowallst.html|accessdate=3 October 2014|publisher=Mark Kurlyandchik|date=9 September 2014}}</ref> An audit published August 2014 found "only about 11 percent of the loans sold through DASP [were] considered 're-performing'".<ref name=aljaz/> "Rather than defaulting— [FHA] keeps many of the properties they’re tied to from going through the typical foreclosure process.
