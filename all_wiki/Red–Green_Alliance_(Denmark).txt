The '''Red–Green Alliance''' ({{lang-da|Enhedslisten – De Rød-Grønne}}, literally Unity List – The Red–Greens,<ref name="Loomes2013">{{cite book|author=Gemma Loomes|title=Party Strategies in Western Europe: Party Competition and Electoral Outcomes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iGOvekeiLl0C&pg=PA201|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=17 June 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-59303-1|pages=201–}}</ref> abbreviated '''Enhl'''., '''Ø''') is an [[Eco-socialism|eco-socialist]]<ref name="Nordsieck"/> [[list of political parties in Denmark|political party]] in [[Denmark]]. It is the furthest left party in the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]], advocating for [[socialist democracy]] in Denmark and internationally.

== Political and ideological position ==
The party describes itself as a socialist and democratic grassroots party, which claims also to represent [[green politics]], [[peace movement]], [[anti-discrimination]] and [[trade union movement]].

The party's ideological position is set out in a manifesto from 2014.<ref name="principprogrammet">{{cite web|url=http://www.enhedslisten.dk/enhedslistens-principprogram|title=Enhedslistens principprogram|work=Enhedslisten|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref> It proposes that a socialistic society of the future "neither can nor should be described in detail, but rather be developed and shaped by the people living in it". It describes socialism as "an answer to the problems caused by capitalism such as non-sufficient democracy, crises, destruction of nature, inequality, racism and war".<ref name="principprogrammet"/> About the economic system, it says:
<blockquote>A new and actually democratic system of society requires fundamental changes in the ownership of the means of production, such as companies, land and natural resources. Collective forms of ownership will be dominating. We propose that public authorities, co-workers, local communities and other collectives of persons should own and run institutions and companies. [...] A democratic economy means a democratic work life as well. The work place should be characterized by democracy, and the employees must have a constitutional right to decisive influence on the organization of work in the workplace.<ref name="principprogrammet"/></blockquote>

The methods advocated for achieving this may be different, depending on the course of class struggle, but will eventually require a revolution - one that must be supported by a majority of the population manifested through democratic and free elections.<ref name="principprogrammet"/>

The party often adopts particular views in relation to the other parties in the Folketing and opt out of many of the settlements reached, seen as an expression of class collaboration. Until the conditions for the party's long-term goal are presented, however, the party will use its seats in parliament to vote for any improvement and against any deterioration of working-class people's lives. In line with this, the party agreed at its national conference in 2010 that if [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] became Prime Minister after the 2011 election, the party would vote for a "red" budget bill that did not contain obvious flaws.

== Policies ==

=== Social policy ===
The party places great emphasis on the fight against [[social inequality]] and [[poverty]], and is in favour of strengthening and expanding the [[welfare state]]. The party believes there is place in society for all forms of diversity, including gender, sexuality, disability and ethnic background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enhedslisten.dk/plads-til-alle|title=Plads til alle|work=Enhedslisten|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref> It also advocates for a larger public sector, among other things, to improve quality of life for public sector employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enhedslisten.dk/flere-h%C3%A6nder-mere-i-l%C3%B8n|title=Flere hænder, mere i løn|work=Enhedslisten|accessdate=25 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610205735/http://enhedslisten.dk/flere-h%c3%a6nder-mere-i-l%c3%b8n|archive-date=10 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The party believes people should be free to choose when they want to get an education and is opposed to [[tuition fees]], which they believe harm opportunities for everyone to acquire an education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enhedslisten.dk/b%C3%B8rn-og-uddannelse|title=Børn og uddannelse|work=Enhedslisten|accessdate=25 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610214923/http://enhedslisten.dk/b%c3%b8rn-og-uddannelse|archive-date=10 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The party does not see unemployment as being equal to laziness and seeks to abolish the Danish equivalent of [[workfare]].<ref name="Ulighed">{{cite web|url=http://www.enhedslisten.dk/ulighed-og-fattigdom|title=Ulighed og fattigdom|work=Enhedslisten|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref>

=== Economic policy ===
The party is decisively anti-capitalist and has particularly distinguished itself as an opponent of [[transfer pricing]], whereby multinational companies minimise the amount they pay in tax by attributing their profits to countries with lower tax rates.

According to the party, the [[Great Recession|global economic crisis]] should be resolved through the stricter control of loans, the introduction of a [[Tobin tax]], and the [[public ownership|nationalisation]] of the banks and mortgage companies. It says the public sector must be expanded, the wages of the lowest-paid workers should be raised, and the insurance-based unemployment benefit period should be extended to a minimum of four years. At the same time, students should be given a greater state education grant.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.enhedslisten.dk/velf%C3%A6rd-til-alle |title=Velfærd til alle |access-date=20 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717225420/http://enhedslisten.dk/velf%C3%A6rd-til-alle |archive-date=17 July 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> At minimum, all benefits should be raised to 13,500 kroner per month before taxes.<ref name="Ulighed" />

=== Foreign policy ===
The party advocates for foreign policy based on respect for [[human rights]], which it believes has not been appropriately prioritised in the past. It also proposes greater support for developing countries through a doubling of [[foreign aid]],<ref>[http://www.ft.dk/Demokrati/Partier/PartiOversigt/Enhedslisten/politik/Internationale%20relationer/Danmarks%20stoette%20til%20udviklingslande.aspx Enhedslisten på Folketingets hjemmeside]</ref> and campaigns for Denmark's withdrawal from [[NATO]]. In March 2019, the party announced it would no longer campaign for a referendum to leave the EU, pointing to [[Brexit]] illustrating the need for clarity before withdrawal can be considered.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hvass |first1=Jesper |last2=Rytgaard |first2=Nikolaj |title=Enhedslisten parkerer krav om dansk udmeldelse af EU efter britisk kaos |url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE11250051/enhedslisten-parkerer-krav-om-dansk-udmeldelse-af-eu-efter-britisk-kaos/ |accessdate=15 March 2019 |newspaper=Jyllands-Posten |date=15 March 2019 |language=Danish}}</ref>

The party operates on the fundamental belief that peace is preferable to war, and has been opposed from the beginning to Denmark's participation in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That principle was challenged in 2011, when the party's parliamentary group voted in favour of Danish participation in the UN-sanctioned military action in Libya on the basis that it was a [[humanitarian]] action.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enhedslisten.dk/artikel/enhedslisten-stemmer-humanit%C3%A6r-aktion-i-libyen|title=Enhedslisten stemmer for humanitær aktion i Libyen|work=Enhedslisten|accessdate=25 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610224225/http://enhedslisten.dk/artikel/enhedslisten-stemmer-humanit%c3%a6r-aktion-i-libyen|archive-date=10 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, the decision led to significant backlash, and the party's support was pulled back after the military intervention began.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2011/03/30/144018.htm|title=Enhedslisten trækker støtten til Libyen-krigen|author=Oliver Routhe Skov og Turi Kjestine Meyhoff|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref>

== History ==
The party was formed in 1989 as an [[electoral alliance]] of three [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] parties: [[Left Socialists]] (VS), [[Communist Party of Denmark]] (DKP), and [[Socialist Workers Party (Denmark)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SAP). Originally the plan was to unite these parties alongside [[The Greens (Denmark)|The Greens]] (De Grønne), [[Common Course]], and Humanist to form a broad-based [[Progressivism|progressive]] movement, but this did not materialize.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enhedslisten.dk/enhedslistens-historie|title=Enhedslistens historie|work=Enhedslisten|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref> A fourth party, the [[Communist Workers Party (Denmark)|Communist Workers Party]] (KAP), succeeded in joining the alliance in 1991, but its involvement was vetoed a year later by DKP.

Prior to the [[2007 Danish parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary election]], the party enlisted [[Asmaa Abdol-Hamid]], a Danish [[Muslim]] candidate who identified herself as a feminist, democrat, and socialist.<ref name="GUARDIAN">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/16/religion.uk|title=Feminist, socialist, devout Muslim: woman who has thrown Denmark into turmoil|date=16 May 2007|accessdate=20 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> She is endorsed by some imams, opposed by others (including those in [[Hizb-ut-Tahrir]]), wears a hijab and will not shake hands with men.<ref name="krist">[http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/251058:Kirke---tro--Imamer-anbefaler-Asmaa Imamer anbefaler Asmaa], Kristeligt Dagblad, 1 May 2007</ref> These facts, and some of her statements regarding politics and religion, made her the target of some criticism across the political spectrum, particularly from the [[Danish People's Party]]. Some left-wing figures cited her candidacy as a reason for withdrawing their support from the party.<ref name="info">[http://information.dk/145342 Kære Asmaa], Information, 1 September 2007</ref> An anti-religious network was created within the party with the stated goal of turning the party into a solely [[Atheism|atheist]] party with a [[Dialectical materialism|materialist]]–[[Marxism|Marxist]] basis.<ref name="aalborg">[http://www.aalborg.dk/dansk/visiting/rundtiaalborg.aspx?ctrl=424&data=1%2C2504614%2C531 Religionskrig hos Enhedslisten]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, aalborg.dk, 20 September 2007</ref>

During the campaign, there was some speculation as to whether her candidacy would attract or repel voters.<ref name="Politiken">[http://politiken.dk/politik/article414858.ece Asmaa kan sprænge Enh's partiliste i København] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204132901/http://politiken.dk/politik/article414858.ece |date=4 December 2007 }}, Politiken, 2 November 2007</ref><ref name="Politiken2">[http://politiken.dk/politik/article412913.ece Ekspert: Asmaa har skræmt marxisterne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203090847/http://politiken.dk/politik/article412913.ece |date=3 December 2007 }}, Politiken, 1 November 2007</ref> The results of the election were 2.2% for the party, down from 3.4% in the [[2005 Danish parliamentary election|2005 parliamentary elections]]. Although not elected, Abdol-Hamid maintained that she had attracted voters to the party. The four seats won by the party went to [[Frank Aaen]], [[Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen]], [[Line Barfod]], and Per Clausen.

In the [[2011 Danish parliamentary election|2011 parliamentary election]], the party received 6.7% of the vote and tripled its representation from 4 seats to 12 seats.

The party contested the [[2013 Danish local elections|2013 local elections]] on a platform of improving public transport and making greater public investment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/local-elections-13/party-profile-enhedslisten|title=Party profile: Enhedslisten|date=9 November 2013|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>

As part of the left-leaning "Red bloc" coalition with [[Socialdemokraterne]], Enhedslisten accepted the [[state budget]] twice and was in opposition twice in the period from 2011 to 2015. At no point, however, did they report direct opposition to the government. In the [[2015 Danish general election|2015 general election]], the party received 7.8% of the vote and increased its representation from 12 seats to 14 seats.

The distribution of Red–Green Alliance's voters is geographically disparate. While in [[Nørrebro]] and [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] districts of Copenhagen, it was the strongest party in the 2015 election, scoring 26.5 and 20.8% respectively (in [[Bispebjerg]] it received 22%, placing it only slightly behind the Social Democrats), the party is much more weakly positioned in rural parts of Denmark, taking only an average of 4.5% of votes in Western Jutland with as little as 3.1% in the [[Ringkøbing]] district.

===European Parliament===
Prior to 2016, the Red–Green Alliance never directly contested elections to the [[European Parliament]], preferring to support the [[People's Movement against the EU]], a [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] party whose MEP sits in the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left]] group. Some of the party's MPs were considering running an independent list for the [[2014 European Parliament election in Denmark|2014 elections]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/nyheder/politik/danskpolitik/article1944301.ece|title=Red–Green Alliance puts pressure to People's Movement Against the EU|date=27 March 2013|newspaper=[[Ekstra Bladet]]|access-date=21 May 2016|language=Danish}}</ref> but this idea was dismissed by a majority on the party's yearly meeting.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.b.dk/politiko/enhedslisten-dropper-at-stille-op-til-eu-valget|title=Red–Green Alliance scraps EU election run|date=27 April 2013|newspaper=[[Berlingske]]|access-date=21 May 2016|language=Danish}}</ref>

In a historic decision in the party's yearly meeting in May 2016, a majority decided to directly contest the [[2019 European Parliament election]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/enhedslisten-stiller-selvstaendigt-op-til-naeste-eu-valg|title=Red–Green Alliance will run independently in the next European Parliament election|date=15 May 2016|publisher=[[Danmarks Radio]]|access-date=21 May 2016|language=Danish}}</ref>
