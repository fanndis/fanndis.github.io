Bin Laden is most well known for his role in masterminding the [[September 11 attacks]], which resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 and prompted the United States to initiate the [[War on Terror]]. He subsequently became the subject of a decade-long international manhunt.

The FBI and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), as well as other U.S. governmental agencies, have used either "Usama bin Laden" or "Usama bin Ladin". Less common renderings include "Ussamah bin Ladin" and, in the French-language media, "Oussama ben Laden". Other spellings include "Binladen" or, as used by his family in the West, "Binladin". The decapitalization of ''bin'' is based on the convention of leaving short prepositions, articles, and [[patronymics]] uncapitalized in surnames; the [[nasab]] ''[[Arabic Name#Nasab نسب|bin]]'' means "son of". The spellings with ''o'' and ''e'' come from a [[Persian language|Persian]]-influenced pronunciation also used in Afghanistan, where bin Laden spent many years.

Osama bin Laden's full name, Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, means "Osama, son of Mohammed, son of Awad, son of Laden".<ref name="Davies2018"/> "Mohammed" refers to bin Laden's father Mohammed bin Laden; "Awad" refers to his grandfather, Awad bin Aboud bin Laden, a Kindite [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] tribesman; "Laden" refers not to bin Laden's great-grandfather, who was named Aboud, but to Aboud's father, Laden Ali al-Qahtani.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/L%C4%81din-al-Qatani/6000000012479136624 |title=Lādin Ali al-Qatani |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116225543/https://www.geni.com/people/L%C4%81din-al-Qatani/6000000012479136624 |archive-date=November 16, 2016 }}</ref>

The [[Arabic]] [[natural language|linguistic]] convention would be to refer to him as "Osama" or "Osama bin Laden", not "bin Laden" alone, as "bin Laden" is a [[patronymic]], not a surname in the Western manner. According to bin Laden's son [[Omar bin Laden]], the family's hereditary surname is "[[Al-Qahtani (disambiguation)|al-Qahtani]]" ({{lang-ar|القحطاني}}, ''āl-Qaḥṭānī''), but bin Laden's father, [[Mohammed bin Laden]], never officially registered the name.<ref>{{cite book |title=Growing up Bin Laden: Osama's Wife and Son Take Us Inside Their Secret World |last1=bin Laden |first1=Najwa |author-link2=Omar bin Laden |last2=bin Laden |first2=Omar |last3=Sasson |first3=Jean |author-link=Najwa Ghanem |author-link3=Jean Sasson |year=2009 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-312-56016-4 |page=301 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RcBwm5b8VbAC |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407011237/http://books.google.com/books?id=RcBwm5b8VbAC |archive-date=April 7, 2015 }}</ref>

==Beliefs and ideology==
{{Main|Beliefs and ideology of Osama bin Laden}}
A major component of bin Laden's ideology was the concept that civilians from enemy countries, including women and children, were legitimate targets for jihadists to kill.<ref>''Messages'', (2005) p. 70. Al Jazeera, December 1998, following Kenya and Tanzania embassy attacks.</ref><ref>''Messages'', (2005), p. 119, October 21, 2001, interview with Taysir Alluni of Al Jazeera.</ref> According to former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst [[Michael Scheuer]], who led the CIA's hunt for Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader was motivated by a belief that [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] has oppressed, killed, or otherwise harmed Muslims in the Middle East.<ref name="Scheuer 2004 9">{{cite book |last=Scheuer |first=Michael |title=Imperial Hubris |publisher=Brassey's, Inc. |year=2004 |location=Dulles, Virginia |page=[https://archive.org/details/imperialhubriswh00anon/page/9 9] |url=https://archive.org/details/imperialhubriswh00anon|url-access=registration |isbn=978-0-9655139-4-4 |quote=The focused and lethal threat posed to U.S. national security arises not from Muslims being offended by what America is, but rather from their plausible perception that the things they most love and value—God, Islam, their brethren, and Muslim lands—are being attacked by America.}}</ref> As such, the threat to U.S. national security arises not from al-Qaeda being offended by what America is but rather by what America does, or in the words of Scheuer, "They (al-Qaeda) hate us (Americans) for what we do, not who we are." Nonetheless, bin Laden criticized the U.S. for its secular form of governance, calling upon Americans to convert to Islam and reject the immoral acts of [[:wikt:fornication|fornication]], [[homosexuality]], [[Psychoactive drug|intoxicants]], [[gambling]], and [[usury]], in a letter published in late 2002.<ref name=Letter2002/>

In 1997, he condemned the United States for its hypocrisy in not labeling the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]] as terrorism.

Bin Laden's overall strategy for achieving his goals against much larger enemies such as the [[Soviet Union]] and United States was to lure them into a long [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] in Muslim countries, attracting large numbers of jihadists who would never surrender. He believed this would lead to [[economic collapse]] of the enemy countries, by "bleeding" them dry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/11/01/binladen.tape/index.html |title=Bin Laden: Goal is to bankrupt U.S.|publisher=CNN |date=November 2, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305091629/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/11/01/binladen.tape/index.html |archive-date=March 5, 2016 }}</ref> Al-Qaeda manuals express this strategy.

Bin Laden was heavily [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], stating that most of the negative events that occurred in the world were the direct result of Jewish actions.

===Formation and structuring of al-Qaeda===
{{Main|Al-Qaeda}}
By 1988, bin Laden had split from Maktab al-Khidamat. While Azzam acted as support for Afghan fighters, bin Laden wanted a more military role. One of the main points leading to the split and the creation of al-Qaeda was Azzam's insistence that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming a separate fighting force.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bergen|2006|pp=74–88}}</ref> Notes of a meeting of bin Laden and others on August 20, 1988 indicate that al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: "Basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make his religion victorious." A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (''[[Bay'at|bayat]]'') to follow one's superiors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=133–134}}.</ref>

According to Wright, the group's real name was not used in public pronouncements because its existence was still a closely held secret.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=260}}.</ref> His research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed at an August 11, 1988, meeting between several senior leaders of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]], and bin Laden, where it was agreed to join bin Laden's money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8EqWnqdsgZMC&q=August+11,+1988,+meeting+between+%22several+senior+leaders%22+of+Egyptian+Islamic+Jihad,+Abdullah+Azzam,+and+bin+Laden&pg=PA108 |title=Urban Terrorism : Myths And Realities |first=N.

Following the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, Osama bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia as a hero of jihad.<ref name="pbschronology"/> Along with his Arab legion, he was thought to have brought down the mighty superpower of the Soviet Union.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=146}}</ref> After his return to Saudi Arabia, bin Laden engaged in opposition movements to the Saudi monarchy while working for [[Saudi Binladin Group|his family business]].<ref name="pbschronology"/> He was also angered by the internecine tribal fighting among the Afghans.<ref name="Fisk-p4"/>

The Iraqi [[invasion of Kuwait]] under [[Saddam Hussein]] on August 2, 1990, put the Saudi kingdom and the royal family at risk. With Iraqi forces on the [[Iraq–Saudi Arabia border|Saudi border]], Saddam's appeal to pan-Arabism was potentially inciting internal dissent. Bin Laden met with [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]], and Saudi Defense Minister [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Sultan]], telling them not to depend on non-Muslim assistance from the United States and others and offering to help defend Saudi Arabia with his Arab legion.

He bought [[Osama bin Laden's house in Khartoum|a house]] on Al-Mashtal Street in the affluent Al-Riyadh quarter and a retreat at [[Soba (city)|Soba]] on the [[Blue Nile]].<ref name="Reeve2002">{{cite book |last=Reeve |first=Simon |title=The new jackals: Ramzi Yousef, Osama Bin Laden and the future of terrorism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQjpziNmoE4C&pg=PA172 |access-date=May 7, 2011 |date=June 27, 2002 |publisher=UPNE |isbn=978-1-55553-509-4 |page=172 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529065422/http://books.google.com/books?id=VQjpziNmoE4C&pg=PA172 |archive-date=May 29, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="ShayLiberman2006">{{cite book |last1=Shay |first1=Shaul |last2=Liberman |first2=Rachel |title=The Red Sea terror triangle: Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and Islamic terror |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v2ss0vor_DkC&pg=PA43 |access-date=May 7, 2011 |date=October 13, 2006 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-1-4128-0620-6 |page=43 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529080257/http://books.google.com/books?id=v2ss0vor_DkC&pg=PA43 |archive-date=May 29, 2013 }}</ref> During his time in Sudan, he heavily invested in the infrastructure, in agriculture and businesses.

By that time, bin Laden was being linked with [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] (EIJ), which made up the core of al-Qaeda. In 1995 the EIJ [[Attempted assassination of President Hosni Mubarak|attempted to assassinate]] the Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. The attempt failed, and Sudan expelled the EIJ.

The U.S. State Department accused Sudan of being a [[State terrorism|sponsor of international terrorism]] and bin Laden of operating terrorist training camps in the Sudanese desert. According to Sudan officials, however, this stance became obsolete as the Islamist political leader [[Hassan al-Turabi]] lost influence in their country. The Sudanese wanted to engage with the U.S. but American officials refused to meet with them even after they had expelled bin Laden. It was not until 2000 that the State Department authorized U.S. intelligence officials to visit Sudan.<ref name=VF2002/>

The [[9/11 Commission Report]] states:

<blockquote>In late 1995, when Bin Laden was still in Sudan, the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) learned that Sudanese officials were discussing with the Saudi government the possibility of expelling Bin Laden. CIA paramilitary officer [[Billy Waugh]] tracked down Bin Ladin in Sudan and prepared an operation to apprehend him, but was denied authorization.<ref>''Hunting the Jackal: A Special Forces and CIA Soldier's Fifty Years on the Frontlines of the War Against Terrorism,'' 2004.</ref> U.S. Ambassador [[Timothy M. Carney|Timothy Carney]] encouraged the Sudanese to pursue this course. The Saudis, however, did not want Bin Laden, giving as their reason their revocation of his citizenship. [[Minister of Defence (Sudan)|Sudan's minister of defense]], Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Laden over to the United States. The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Laden. Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment outstanding against bin Laden in any country.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch4.pdf |title=Responses to Al Qaeda's Initial Assaults |publisher=9/11 Commission |access-date=May 28, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015032827/http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch4.pdf |archive-date=October 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all}}</ref></blockquote>

The 9/11 Commission Report further states:

<blockquote>In February 1996, Sudanese officials began approaching officials from the United States and other governments, asking what actions of theirs might ease foreign pressure. In secret meetings with Saudi officials, Sudan offered to expel Bin Laden to Saudi Arabia and asked the Saudis to pardon him. U.S. officials became aware of these secret discussions, certainly by March. Saudi officials apparently wanted Bin Laden expelled from Sudan. They had already revoked his citizenship, however, and would not tolerate his presence in their country. Also Bin Laden may have no longer felt safe in Sudan, where he had already escaped at least one assassination attempt that he believed to have been the work of the Egyptian or Saudi regimes, and paid for by the [[CIA]].</blockquote>

Due to the increasing pressure on Sudan from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United States, bin Laden was permitted to leave for a country of his choice. He chose to return to [[Jalalabad]], Afghanistan aboard a chartered flight on May 18, 1996; there he forged a close relationship with [[Mullah Mohammed Omar]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/06/news/mn-12224 |title=Fighters Hunt Former Ally |work=Los Angeles Times |last=Stack |first=Megan K. |date=December 6, 2001 |access-date=May 28, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919134203/http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/06/news/mn-12224 |archive-date=September 19, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1550419.stm |title=Profile: Mullah Mohamed Omar |date=September 18, 2001 |work=BBC News |access-date=May 28, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728110131/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1550419.stm |archive-date=July 28, 2010 }}</ref> According to the 9/11 Commission, the expulsion from Sudan significantly weakened bin Laden and his organization.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch2.pdf |title=The Foundation of the New Terrorism |publisher=9/11 Commission |access-date=May 28, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827082338/http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch2.pdf |archive-date=August 27, 2010 }}</ref> Some African intelligence sources have argued that the expulsion left bin Laden without an option other than becoming a full-time radical, and that most of the 300 Afghan Arabs who left with him subsequently became terrorists.<ref name=VF2002/> Various sources report that bin Laden lost between $20&nbsp;million<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=222}}</ref> and $300&nbsp;million<ref>{{Harvnb|Stern|2003|p=253}}</ref> in Sudan; the government seized his construction equipment, and bin Laden was forced to liquidate his businesses, land, and even his horses.

In August 1996, bin Laden declared war against the United States.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bergen|2008|p=14}}.</ref> Despite the assurance of President [[George H. W. Bush]] to [[King Fahd]] in 1990, that all U.S. forces based in Saudi Arabia would be withdrawn once the Iraqi threat had been dealt with, by 1996 the Americans were still there. Bush cited the necessity of dealing with the remnants of Saddam's regime (which Bush had chosen not to destroy). Bin Laden's view was that "the 'evils' of the Middle East arose from America's attempt to take over the region and from its support for Israel. Saudi Arabia had been turned into an American colony".<ref name="Fisk-p22" />

He issued a [[fatwā]] against the United States, which was first published in ''[[Al-Quds Al-Arabi]]'', a London-based newspaper. It was entitled "Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011031024057/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 31, 2001 |title=Bin Laden's Fatwa |publisher=Pbs.org |date=August 20, 1998 |access-date=June 25, 2011 }}</ref> Saudi Arabia is sometimes called "The Land of the Two Holy Mosques" in reference to Mecca and Medina, the two holiest places in Islam. The reference to occupation in the fatwā referred to US forces based in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of controlling air space in Iraq, known as [[Operation Southern Watch]].

In Afghanistan, bin Laden and al-Qaeda raised money from donors from the days of the Soviet jihad, and from the Pakistani ISI to establish more training camps for Mujahideen fighters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=250}}</ref> Bin Laden effectively took over [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]], which ferried Islamic militants, arms, cash, and opium through the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, as well as provided false identifications to members of bin Laden's terrorist network.<ref>Stephen Braun; Judy Pasternak [https://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/18/news/mn-5593 "Long Before Sept. 11, Bin Laden Aircraft Flew Under the Radar"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715022941/http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/18/news/mn-5593 |date=July 15, 2012 }}, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

===Early attacks and aid for attacks===
It is believed that the first bombing attack involving bin Laden was the December 29, 1992, bombing of the [[Gold Mihor Hotel]] in [[Aden]] in which two people were killed.<ref name="pbschronology">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/etc/cron.html |title=Who is bin Laden?: Chronology |publisher=PBS |access-date=May 28, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414023118/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/etc/cron.html |archive-date=April 14, 2010 }}</ref>

It was after this bombing that al-Qaeda was reported to have developed its justification for the killing of innocent people. According to a fatwa issued by [[Mamdouh Mahmud Salim]], the killing of someone standing near the enemy is justified because any innocent bystander will find a proper reward in death, going to ''[[Jannah]]'' (paradise) if they were good Muslims and to ''[[Jahannam]]'' (hell) if they were bad or non-believers.<ref>testimony of Jamal al-Fadl, U.S. v. Usama bin Laden, et al.</ref> The fatwa was issued to al-Qaeda members but not the general public.

In the 1990s, bin Laden's al-Qaeda assisted jihadis financially and sometimes militarily in Algeria, Egypt, and Afghanistan. In 1992 or 1993, bin Laden sent an emissary, Qari el-Said, with $40,000 to Algeria to aid the Islamists and urge war rather than negotiation with the government. Their advice was heeded. The [[Algerian Civil War#Massacres and reconciliation|war]] that followed caused the deaths of 150,000–200,000 Algerians and ended with the Islamist surrender to the government. In January 1996, the CIA launched a new unit of its [[Counterterrorism Center]] (CTC) called [[Bin Laden Issue Station]], code-named "Alec Station", to track and to carry out operations against Bin Laden's activities. Bin Laden Issue Station was headed by [[Michael Scheuer]], a veteran of the Islamic Extremism Branch of the CTC.<ref name="GhostWars">Coll, Steve, "Ghost Wars," (Penguin Books, 2004)</ref>

Further, the captured men also admitted to ties with Osama bin Laden.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Bin Laden was granted Bosnian passport", Agence France-Presse, September 24, 1999.</ref><ref name="query.nytimes.com">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/23/world/outsiders-bring-islamic-fervor-to-the-balkans.html |title=Outsiders Bring Islamic Fervor To the Balkans |work=The New York Times |last=Hedges |first=Chris |date=September 23, 1996 |access-date=May 25, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705164148/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/23/world/outsiders-bring-islamic-fervor-to-the-balkans.html |archive-date=July 5, 2011 }}</ref>

In 1999, the press reported that bin Laden and his Tunisian assistant Mehrez Aodouni were granted citizenship and [[Bosnian passport]]s in 1993 by the government in Sarajevo. This information was denied by the Bosnian government following the September 11 attacks, but it was later found that Aodouni was arrested in Turkey and that at that time he possessed the Bosnian passport. Following this revelation, a new explanation was given that bin Laden did not personally collect his Bosnian passport and that officials at the Bosnian embassy in Vienna, which issued the passport, could not have known who bin Laden was at the time.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="query.nytimes.com"/> The Bosnian daily ''[[Oslobođenje]]'' published in 2001 that three men, believed to be linked to bin Laden, were arrested in Sarajevo in July 2001. The three, one of whom was identified as Imad El Misri, were Egyptian nationals. The paper said that two of the suspects were holding Bosnian passports.

[[SHISH]]'s head Fatos Klosi said that Osama was running a terror network in [[Albania]] to take part in the [[Kosovo War]] under the guise of a humanitarian organisation and it was reported to have been started in 1994.

During his trial at the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]], former Serbian President [[Slobodan Milošević]] quoted from a purported [[FBI]] report that bin Laden's al-Qaeda had a presence in the Balkans and aided the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]]. He claimed bin Laden had used Albania as a launchpad for violence in the region and Europe. He claimed that they had informed [[Richard Holbrooke]] that KLA was being aided by al-Qaeda but the US decided to cooperate with the KLA and thus indirectly with Osama despite the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] earlier. Milošević had argued that the United States aided the terrorists, which culminated in its backing of the 1999 [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] during the Kosovo War.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roche|first=Andrew |url=http://news.findlaw.com/international/s/20020215/milosevicdc.html|title=Milosevic: U.S. was Ally of Al Qaeda in Kosovo|agency=Reuters |date=February 15, 2002|via=FindLaw|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020220040734/http://news.findlaw.com/international/s/20020215/milosevicdc.html|archive-date=February 20, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Scahill |first1=Jeremy |title=Rest Easy, Bill Clinton: Milosevic Can't Talk Anymore |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rest-easy-bill-clinton-mi_b_17235 |website=Huffington Post |date=March 13, 2006 |access-date=June 19, 2020 |archive-date=December 2, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201202135015/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rest-easy-bill-clinton-mi_b_17235 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Al-Qaeda 'helped Kosovo rebels' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1862515.stm |website=BBC News |date=March 8, 2002 |access-date=June 19, 2020 |archive-date=August 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809231059/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1862515.stm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=US backed Al Qaeda in Kosovo: Milosevic: Chinese embassy bombing termed deliberate |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/21743/us-backed-al-qaeda-in-kosovo-milosevic-chinese-embassy-bombing-termed-deliberate |website=Dawn |date=February 16, 2002|access-date=June 19, 2020}}</ref>

On October 10, 2001, bin Laden appeared as well on the initial list of the top 22 FBI Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by the President of the United States George W. Bush, in direct response to the September 11 attacks, but which was again based on the indictment for the 1998 embassy attack. Bin Laden was among a group of thirteen fugitive terrorists wanted on that latter list for questioning about the 1998 embassy bombings. Bin Laden remains the only fugitive ever to be listed on both FBI fugitive lists.

Despite the multiple indictments listed above and multiple requests, the Taliban refused to extradite Osama bin Laden. They did however offer to try him before an Islamic court if evidence of Osama bin Laden's involvement in the September 11 attacks was provided. It was not until eight days after the bombing of Afghanistan began in October 2001 that the Taliban finally did offer to turn over Osama bin Laden to a third-party country for trial in return for the United States ending the bombing. This offer was rejected by President Bush stating that this was no longer negotiable, with Bush responding "there's no need to discuss innocence or guilt. We know he's guilty."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/14/afghanistan.terrorism5 |title=Bush rejects Taliban offer to hand Bin Laden over |work=The Guardian |date=October 14, 2001 |access-date=May 27, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825195435/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/14/afghanistan.terrorism5 |archive-date=August 25, 2013 }}</ref>

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the U.S. government concluded that Osama bin Laden was present during the [[Battle of Tora Bora]], Afghanistan in late 2001, and according to civilian and military officials with first-hand knowledge, failure by the United States to commit enough U.S. ground troops to hunt him led to his escape and was the gravest failure by the United States in the war against al-Qaeda. Intelligence officials assembled what they believed to be decisive evidence, from contemporary and subsequent interrogations and intercepted communications, that bin Laden began the Battle of Tora Bora inside the cave complex along Afghanistan's mountainous eastern border.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Gellman |first1=Barton |last2=Ricks |first2=Thomas E. |title=U.S. Concludes Bin Laden Escaped at Tora Bora Fight |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A62618-2002Apr16 |archive-url= http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100301195609/http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A62618-2002Apr16 |url-status=dead |archive-date= March 1, 2010 |date=April 17, 2002 |access-date=May 25, 2010 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

[[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] said in December 2009 that officials had had no reliable information on bin Laden's whereabouts for years. One week later, General [[Stanley McChrystal]], the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said in December 2009 that al-Qaeda would not be defeated unless its leader, Osama bin Laden, were captured or killed. Testifying to the U.S. Congress, he said that bin Laden had become an iconic figure, whose survival emboldens al-Qaeda as a franchising organization across the world, and that Obama's deployment of 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan meant that success would be possible. "I don't think that we can finally defeat al-Qaeda until he's captured or killed", McChrystal said of bin Laden. According to him, killing or capturing bin Laden would not spell the end of al-Qaeda, but the movement could not be eradicated while he remained at large.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8402138.stm |title=Gen McChrystal: Bin Laden is key to al-Qaeda defeat |work=BBC News |date=December 9, 2009 |access-date=May 25, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428192959/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8402138.stm |archive-date=April 28, 2010 }}</ref>

While referring to Osama bin Laden in a [[CNN]] film clip on September 17, 2001, then-President George W. Bush stated, "I want justice.

Numerous speculative press reports were issued about his whereabouts or even death; some placed bin Laden in different locations during overlapping time periods. None were ever definitively proven. After military offensives in Afghanistan failed to uncover his whereabouts, Pakistan was regularly identified as his suspected hiding place. Some of the conflicting reports regarding bin Laden's whereabouts and mistaken claims about his death follow:
* On December 11, 2005, a letter from [[Atiyah Abd al-Rahman]] to [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] indicated that bin Laden and the al-Qaeda leadership were based in the [[Waziristan]] region of Pakistan at the time. In the letter, translated by the United States military's [[Combating Terrorism Center]] at [[West Point]], Atiyah instructs Zarqawi to send messengers to Waziristan so that they meet with the brothers of the leadership. Al-Rahman also indicates that bin Laden and al-Qaeda are weak and have many of their own problems. The letter has been deemed authentic by military and counterterrorism officials, according to ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/01/AR2006100101083.html |title=Letter Gives Glimpse of Al-Qaeda's Leadership |work=The Washington Post |last=DeYoung |first=Karen |date=October 2, 2006 |access-date=May 20, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425085210/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/01/AR2006100101083.html |archive-date=April 25, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ctc.usma.edu/harmony/CTC-AtiyahLetter.pdf |title=Letter Exposes New Leader in Al-Qa'ida High Command (PDF) |publisher=Combating Terrorism Center at West Point |date=September 25, 2006 |access-date=May 20, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808182757/http://www.ctc.usma.edu/harmony/CTC-AtiyahLetter.pdf |archive-date=August 8, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In a 2010 letter, bin Laden chastised followers who had reinterpreted ''al-tatarrus''—an Islamic doctrine meant to excuse the unintended killing of non-combatants in unusual circumstances—to justify routine massacres of Muslim civilians, which had turned Muslims against the extremist movement. Of the groups affiliated with al-Qaeda, Bin Laden condemned [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan]] for an attack on members of a hostile tribe, declaring that the operation is not justified, as there were casualties of noncombatants. Bin Laden wrote that the ''tatarrus'' doctrine needs to be revisited based on the modern-day context and clear boundaries established. He asked a subordinate to draw up a jihadist code of conduct that would constrain military operations in order to avoid civilian casualties. In Yemen, Bin Laden urged his allies to seek a truce that would bring the country stability or would at least show the people that we are careful in keeping the Muslims safe on the basis of peace. In Somalia, he called attention to the extreme poverty caused by constant warfare, and he advised [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabab]] to pursue economic development. He instructed his followers around the world to focus on education and persuasion rather than entering into confrontations with Islamic political parties.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/bin_laden_s_documents_al_qaida_letters_show_the_moral_and_political_failure_of_terrorism_.single.html |title=Reflections of a Terrorist |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |first=William |last=Saletan|author-link=William Saletan |date=May 4, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506033547/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/bin_laden_s_documents_al_qaida_letters_show_the_moral_and_political_failure_of_terrorism_.single.html |archive-date=May 6, 2012 }}</ref>
