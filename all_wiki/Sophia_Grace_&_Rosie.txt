== ''The Ellen DeGeneres Show'' ==

They were first invited onto ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' in October 2011, after DeGeneres saw their cover of the Nicki Minaj song "Super Bass", on YouTube. The eight  and five-year-old girls became recurring cast members on the show. The girls eventually hosted their own segment, called "Tea Time with Sophia Grace & Rosie". In the segment, the duo invites and interviews guests over tea, such as [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Hugh Grant]], [[Julie Bowen]], [[Harry Connick Jr.]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Justin Bieber]], and [[Reese Witherspoon]].<!-- To address recent edits to this sentence, about Britney Spears being in "Tea Time": will need a reliable source to verify her appearance in that segment; the YouTube reference here does not list a video confirming such an appearance, although Sophia Grace & Rosie did surprise Britney for her birthday in a separate segment on Ellen. The sentence, however, is about "Tea Time"! A source is required to verify Britney was in the "Tea Time" segment. --><ref>{{cite web|title=Videos from ''The Ellen Show'' on YouTube – 'Tea Time with Sophia Grace & Rosie'|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/TheEllenShow/search?query=tea+time+with+sophia+grace+%26+rosie|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> The segment won Sophia Grace and Rosie the "Choice Webstar" at the [[2012 Teen Choice Awards]].

== Singing dolls ==

In April 2014, Just Play launched a two-doll pack containing two dolls of both Sophia Grace and Rosie. They were sold exclusively at [[Walmart]] stores for the first month, until made available at [[Claire's]] in May. Just Play teamed up with the girls to produce their own toy inspired by their love of dress-up, music, dolls and more. The dolls feature the two girls dressed in their trademark hot pink tutus and tiaras. Each doll is fully posable and comes with a matching microphone, ruffled socks, and shoes. The doll plays the real Sophia Grace singing Nicki Minaj's "[[Super Bass]]", when you press the doll's belly.
