==Criticisms==
The January 2010 issue of ''V'' magazine entitled "The Size Issue" featured a variety of plus sized models. This edition printed two different covers, one with plus sized "Precious" star [[Gabourey Sidibe]], while the other featured the petite actress [[Dakota Fanning]]. One criticism of the issue argues that the magazine's intentions were to juxtapose big and small as in a competition with one another. However, others "embraced the magazine's bold statement" and commended ''V'' on its efforts to "modernize the beauty standard".<ref>Inbar, Michael. "Plus-size Models Buck Thin Trend in V Magazine."
