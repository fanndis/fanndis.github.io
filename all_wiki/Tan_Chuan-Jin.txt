On 25 March 2011, Tan left the SAF in order to stand for [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]].

===Political career===
Tan stood as a PAP candidate in the Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency, led by former prime minister  [[Goh Chok Tong]] at the [[2011 Singaporean general election|2011 general election]]. The PAP's team in the constituency defeated the team from the opposition [[National Solidarity Party (Singapore)|National Solidarity Party]], by 78,286 votes (56.65%) to 59,926 (43.35%). Tan has since served as the MP responsible for the [[Kembangan, Singapore|Kembangan]]-[[Chai Chee]] ward.

On 21 May 2011, Tan was appointed a [[Minister of State#Minor government ranks|Minister of State]] at the [[Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)|Ministry of Manpower]] and [[Ministry of National Development (Singapore)|Ministry of National Development]].

On 1 May 2014, Tan was made a member of the Cabinet and assumed the role of Minister for Manpower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changes-in-cabinet-other/1089278.html|title=Tan and Wong promoted to full Minister|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=29 April 2014|accessdate=2 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501234110/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changes-in-cabinet-other/1089278.html|archivedate=1 May 2014}}</ref>

At Ministry of Manpower, Chuan-Jin championed low income workers, as he introduced the progressive wage model and led Government efforts to protect these workers and improve their lives.

As Senior Minister of State at the Ministry of National Development (MND), Chuan-Jin built good rapport with the heritage, nature, environmental and animal welfare groups. He involved them in working out solutions for the Rail Corridor and Bukit Brown. Other collaborations resulted in Singapore first Marine Park and amendments to the Animal and Birds Act. Chuan-Jin continues to advise MND informally on environmental and animal welfare issues.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2018/01/tan-chuan-jin-interview-openings-passionate/|title=Tan Chuan-Jin still doesn’t know why he was appointed Speaker of Parliament|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-31|archive-date=31 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131152043/https://mothership.sg/2018/01/tan-chuan-jin-interview-openings-passionate/|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 4 May 2015, Tan relinquished his role as Minister for Manpower and became the Minister for Social and Family Development as part of a [[Cabinet reshuffle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/tan-chuan-jin-helm-msf-lim-swee-say-be-manpower-minister|title=Cabinet reshuffle: Tan Chuan-Jin to helm MSF; Lim Swee Say to be Manpower Minister|access-date=2015-04-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429181220/http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/tan-chuan-jin-helm-msf-lim-swee-say-be-manpower-minister|archive-date=2015-04-29|url-status=live}}</ref>

As Minister for Social and Family Development (MSF), Chuan-Jin has taken a deep interest in social issues, and in helping the needy and disadvantaged. He launched many initiatives, e.g. KidStart for children of disadvantaged families, and SG Cares to encourage Singaporeans to give back to society. These programmes will deepen our social capital and help build a more gracious, compassionate and cohesive society.

Lee Hsien Loong has asked him to maintain his interest in environmental and social issues, and his concern for the needy and disadvantaged. Chuan-Jin has agreed to continue advising MND on these issues, and to oversee SG Cares, after he becomes Speaker. To complement this, he will be appointed Advisor to NCSS Singapore. Naturally, Chuan-Jin will continue to lead Marine Parade GRC.

Chuan-Jin is also the President to the Singapore National Olympic Council. This is an elected post, not a Government appointment. He will keep on leading and inspiring Singapore ‘s sporting fraternity, as he did recently at the SEA Games.<ref name=":0" />

==Education==
