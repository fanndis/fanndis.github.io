The '''head of government''' is either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a [[sovereign state]], a [[federated state]], or a [[self-governing colony]], [[autonomous region]], or other government who often presides over a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]], a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments.  "Head of government" is often differentiated from "[[head of state]]" (as in article 7 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], article 1 of the [[Protection of Diplomats Convention|Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents]] and the United Nations protocol list),<ref name="unprotocol">[http://www.un.int/protocol/documents/Hspmfm.pdf HEADS OF STATE, HEADS OF GOVERNMENT, MINISTERS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927014351/http://www.un.int/protocol/documents/Hspmfm.pdf |date=27 September 2012 }}, Protocol and Liaison Service, United Nations (19 October 2012).

The authority of a head of government, such as a president, chancellor, or prime minister and the relationship between that position and other state institutions, such as the relation between the head of state and of the legislature, varies greatly among sovereign states, depending largely on the particular system of the government that has been chosen, won, or evolved over time.

In most [[parliamentary system]]s, including [[constitutional monarchies]], the head of government is the ''de facto'' political leader of the government, and is answerable to at least [[Chambers of parliament|one chamber]] of the legislature. Although there is often a formal reporting relationship to a [[head of state]], the latter usually acts as a [[figurehead]] who may take the role of chief executive on limited occasions, either when receiving [[constitutional advice]] from the head of government or under specific provisions in a constitution.

In [[presidential systems|presidential]] republics or in [[absolute monarchies]], the head of state is also usually the head of government. The relationship between that leader and the government, however, can vary greatly, ranging from [[separation of powers]] to [[autocracy]], according to the constitution (or other basic laws) of the particular state.

In [[semi-presidential system]]s, the head of government may answer to both the head of state and the legislature, with the specifics provided by each country's constitution. A modern example is the present French government, which originated as the [[French Fifth Republic]] in 1958.  In France, the [[President of France|president]], the head of state, appoints the [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]], who is the head of government.  However, the president must choose someone who can act effectively as an executive, but who also enjoys the support of the France's legislature, the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]], to be able to pass legislation. In some cases, the head of state may represent one political party but the majority in the National Assembly is of a different party. Given that the majority party has greater control over state funding and [[primary legislation]], the president is in effect forced to choose a prime minister from the opposition party to ensure an effective, functioning legislature. In this case, known as [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]], the prime minister, along with the cabinet, controls domestic policy, with the president's influence largely restricted to foreign affairs.

In [[directorial system]]s, the executive responsibilities of the head of government are spread among a group of people. A prominent example is the [[Swiss Federal Council]], where each member of the council heads a department and also votes on proposals relating to all departments.

== Titles of respective heads of government ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
{{Executive}}
A common title for many heads of government is prime minister. This is used as a formal title in many states, but also informally a generic term to describe whichever office is considered the principal minister under an otherwise styled [[head of state]], as ''minister''&nbsp;— [[Latin language|Latin]] for servants or subordinates&nbsp;— is a common title for members of a government (but many other titles are in use, e.g. [[chancellor]] and secretary of state). Formally the head of state can also be the head of government as well ([[ex officio]] or by ad hoc cumulation, such as a ruling monarch exercising all powers himself) but otherwise has formal precedence over the Head of Government and other ministers, whether he is their actual political superior (ruling monarch, executive president) or rather theoretical or ceremonial in character (constitutional monarch, non-executive president). Various constitutions use different titles, and even the same title can have various multiple meanings, depending on the constitutional order and political system of the state in question.

=== As political chief ===
In addition to prime minister, titles used for the democratic model, where there is an elected legislative body checking the Head of government, include the following. Some of these titles relate to governments below the national level (e.g., states or provinces).

=== Under a dominant head of state ===
In a broader sense, a head of government can be used loosely when referring to various comparable positions under a dominant head of state (especially is the case of ancient or feudal eras, so the term "head of government", in this case, could be considered a contradiction in terms). In this case, the prime minister serves at the pleasure of the monarch and holds no more power than the monarch allows. Some such titles are diwan, [[mahamantri]], [[pradhan]], [[wasir]] or [[vizier]].

However, just because the head of state is the ''[[de jure]]'' dominant position does not mean that he/she will not always be the ''de facto'' political leader. A skilled head of government like 19th-century German statesman [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Minister President of Prussia]] and later [[Chancellor of Germany]] under [[German Emperor|Emperor]]/[[King of Prussia|King]] [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]], serves as an example showing that possession of formal powers does not equal political influence.

=== Indirectly referred as the head of state ===
In some cases, the head of state is a [[figurehead]] whilst the head of the government leads the ruling party. In some cases a head of government may even pass on the title in hereditary fashion. Such titles include the following:
* [[Mayor of the palace]] of the Merovingian kingdoms
* [[Nawab wasir]] of the Mughal Empire (also governor of [[Awadh]])
* [[Peshwa]] of [[Satara State|Satara]] and the [[Maratha empire]]
* ''[[Shōgun]]'' in feudal Japan
* [[Sultan]] in the original case of the [[Seljuk Turks]] who made the [[caliph]]s of [[Baghdad]] their puppets; later both styles were often used for absolute rulers in Nepal

=== Combined heads of state and government ===
[[File:Dilma Rousseff e Cristina Kirchner em 2015.jpg|thumb|President [[Dilma Rousseff]] of Brazil and President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|Christina Kirchner]] of Argentina in 2015.]]

In some models the head of state and head of government are one and the same. These include:
* [[President (government title)|President]] (executive)
* An [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]] reigning and [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|ruling]] without a separate principal minister
* [[Chief magistrate]]
* [[Führer]] (used in [[Nazi Germany]] for [[Adolf Hitler]])
* [[Supreme leader]]
* A [[Governor (United States)|State Governor in the United States]] (subnational executives)
An alternative formula is a single chief political body (e.g., [[presidium]]) which collectively leads the government and provides (e.g. by turns) the ceremonial Head of state. The only state in which this system is currently employed is [[Switzerland]] but other countries such as [[Uruguay]] [[National Council of Government (Uruguay)|have employed it in the past]]. This system is described as the [[directorial system]].
* [[Sultan of Brunei]]
* [[King of Saudi Arabia]]
''See [[Head of state]] for further explanation of these cases.''

== Parliamentary heads of government ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:CommonwealthPrimeMinisters1944.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The heads of government of five members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] at the 1944 [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]]. From left to right, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]] (Canada), [[Jan Smuts]] (South Africa), [[Winston Churchill]] (United Kingdom), [[Peter Fraser]] ([[New Zealand]]), and [[John Curtin]] (Australia).]]

In parliamentary systems, government functions along the following lines:
* The head of government&nbsp;— usually the leader of the majority party or [[Coalition government|coalition]]&nbsp;— forms the government, which is answerable to parliament;
* Full answerability of government to parliament is achieved through
** The ability of parliament to pass a [[vote of no confidence]].
** The ability to vote down legislative proposals of the government.
** Control over or ability to vote down fiscal measures and the budget (or [[Loss of Supply|supply]]); a government is powerless without control of the state finances. In a [[bicameral]] system, it is often the so-called [[lower house]] (e.g. the [[British House of Commons]]) that exercises the major elements of control and oversight; however, in some (e.g. Australia, Italy), the government is constitutionally or by convention answerable to both chambers/Houses of Parliament.

All of these requirements directly impact the Head of government's role. Consequently, they often play a 'day to day' role in parliament, answering questions and defending the government on the 'floor of the House', while in [[semi-presidential]] systems they may not be required to play as much of a role in the functioning of parliament.

=== Appointment ===
In many countries, the Head of government is commissioned by the Head of state to form a government, on the basis of the strength of party support in the lower house; in some other states, he or she is directly elected by parliament. Many parliamentary systems require ministers to serve in parliament, while others ban ministers from sitting in parliament (they must resign on becoming ministers).

=== Removal ===
Heads of government are typically removed from power in a parliamentary system by
* Resignation, following:
** Defeat in a general election.
** Defeat in a [[leadership vote]] at their party [[caucus]], to be replaced by another member of the same party.
** Defeat in a parliamentary vote on a major issue, e.g., [[loss of supply]], [[Motion of No Confidence|loss of confidence]]. (In such cases, a head of government may seek a [[parliamentary dissolution]] from the Head of state and attempt to regain support by popular vote.)
* Dismissal&nbsp;— some constitutions allow a Head of state (or their designated representative, as is the case in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries) to dismiss a Head of government, though its use can be controversial, as occurred in 1975 when then Australian Governor-General, Sir [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]], dismissed Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] in the [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975|Australian Constitutional Crisis]].
* Death&nbsp;— in this case, the deputy Head of government typically acts as the head of government until a new head of government is appointed.

=== First among equals or dominating the cabinet? ===
Constitutions differ in the range and scope of powers granted to the head of government. Some older constitutions; for example, Australia's [[Constitution of Australia|1900 text]], and Belgium's [[Constitution of Belgium|1830 text]]; do not mention their prime ministerial offices at all, the offices became a ''de facto'' political reality without a formal constitutional status. Some constitutions make a Prime Minister {{Lang|la|[[primus inter pares]]}} ([[first among equals]]) and that remains the practical reality for the [[Prime Minister of Belgium]] and the [[Prime Minister of Finland]]. Other states however, make their head of government a central and dominant figure within the cabinet system; Ireland's [[Taoiseach]], for example, alone can decide when to seek a parliamentary dissolution, in contrast to other countries where this is a cabinet decision, with the Prime Minister just one member voting on the suggestion. In [[Israel]], while the [[Cabinet of Israel|Government]] is nominally a collegiate body with a {{Lang|la|primus inter pares}} role for the [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]], the Israeli Prime Minister is the dominant figure in the executive branch in practice.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Amir |first1=R. |last2=Nachmias |first2=D. |last3=Arian |first3=A. |title=Executive Governance in Israel |date=17 December 2001 |page=48 |isbn=9781403990150 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tpFaCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48}}</ref> The [[Prime Minister of Sweden]], under the [[1974 Instrument of Government]], is a constitutional office with all key executive powers either directly at his or her disposal or indirectly through the collegial [[Government of Sweden|Government]], whose members are all appointed and dismissed at the Prime Minister's sole discretion.

Under the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|unwritten British constitution]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]'s role has evolved, based often on the individual's personal appeal and strength of character, as contrasted between, for example, [[Winston Churchill]] as against [[Clement Attlee]], [[Margaret Thatcher]] as against [[John Major]]. It is alleged that the increased personalisation of leadership in a number of states has led to heads of government becoming themselves "semi-presidential" figures, due in part to media coverage of politics that focuses on the leader and his or her mandate, rather than on parliament; and to the increasing centralisation of power in the hands of the head of government. Such allegations have been made against two recent British Prime ministers: [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Tony Blair]]. They were also made against Italian prime ministers [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and [[Matteo Renzi]], Canadian prime minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] and [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Federal Chancellor]] of [[West Germany]] (later all of Germany), [[Helmut Kohl]], when in power.

== Official residence ==
{{Main|Official residence}}
{{More citations needed section|date=January 2018}}
The head of government is often provided with an [[official residence]], often in the same fashion as [[head of state|heads of state]] often are. The name of the residence is often used as a [[metonym]] or alternative title for 'the government' when the office is politically the highest, e.g. in the UK "Downing Street announced today…"

Well-known official residences of heads of government include:
* [[10 Downing Street]] in London&nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] (who also has a country residence, [[Chequers]])
* [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]] in Canberra&nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Australia]] (with an additional residence, [[Kirribilli House]], in Sydney)
* [[24 Sussex Drive]] in Ottawa&nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Canada]] (who also has a country residence, [[Harrington Lake]])
* [[Premier House]] in Wellington&nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]]
* [[7, Lok Kalyan Marg]] in New Delhi&nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of India]]
* [[Catshuis]] in The Hague&nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]
* [[Ballhausplatz]] in Vienna — [[Chancellor of Austria]]
* [[Zhongnanhai]] in Beijing&nbsp;— [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]]
* [[Kantei]] in Tokyo&nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Japan]]
* [[Kramář's Villa]] in Prague — [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic]]
* [[Palazzo Chigi|Chigi Palace]] in Rome&nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Italy]]
* [[Hôtel Matignon]]<ref>Not to be confused with a hotel, as a grand palace is called a ''hôtel'' in French.</ref> in Paris— [[Prime Minister of France]]
* Villa Parkowa in Warsaw— [[Prime Minister of Poland]] 
* [[Federal Chancellery (Berlin)|Federal Chancellery]] in Berlin — [[Chancellor of Germany]]
* The Lambermont in Brussels&nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Belgium]]
* [[Palacio de la Moncloa]] in Madrid&nbsp;— [[President of the Government of Spain]]
* [[São Bento Mansion|Palacete de São Bento]] in Lisbon&nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Portugal]]
* [[Kesäranta]] in Helsinki&nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Finland]]
* [[Sager House]] in Stockholm&nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Sweden]] (who also has a country residence, [[Harpsund]])
* [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] in Moscow&nbsp;— [[Prime Minister of Russia]]

Similarly, heads of government of federal entities below the level of the [[sovereign state]] (often without an actual head of state, at least under international law) may also be given an official residence, sometimes used as an opportunity to display aspirations of statehood:
* ''Hotel Errera'' in [[Brussels]]&nbsp;— [[Minister-President]] of the [[Flemish community]] and region
* [[Bayerische Staatskanzlei|Bavarian State Chancellery]] –  [[List of Ministers-President of Bavaria|Minister-President]] of the [[States of Germany|State]] of [[Bavaria]]
* ''[[Élysette]]'' in [[Namur (city)|Namur]]&nbsp;— [[Minister-President of the Walloon Region]]
* [[Bute House]], Edinburgh; [[First Minister of Scotland]]
* [[Hessische Staatskanzlei|Hesse State Chancellery]], [[Wiesbaden]]; Minister-President of the State of [[Hesse]]
* [[Kazan Kremlin]], Kazan – [[President of Tatarstan]]
* [[Government House, Hong Kong]] – [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]]
* [[Macau Government Headquarters]] – [[Chief Executive of Macau]]
* [[Rotes Rathaus|Red City Hall]] – [[Governing Mayor of Berlin]]
* [[Quinta Vigia]] – [[President of the Regional Government of Madeira]]

Usually, the residence of the heads of government is not as prestigious and grand as that of the head of state, even if the head of state only performs ceremonial duties. Even the formal representative of the head of state, such as a [[governor-general]], may well be housed in a grander, palace-type residence. However, this is not the case when both positions are combined into one:

* The [[White House]] (1600 Pennsylvania Avenue) in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;— President of the United States of America
* The [[Blue House]] (1 Sejongno Jongno-gu) in Seoul — President of South Korea
* [[Istana Nurul Iman]] in [[Bandar Seri Begawan]]&nbsp;— [[Sultan of Brunei]]
* [[Palácio da Alvorada]] in [[Brasília]]&nbsp;— [[President of the Federative Republic of Brazil]]
