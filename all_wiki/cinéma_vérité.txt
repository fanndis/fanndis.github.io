{{other uses|Cinéma vérité (disambiguation)}}

'''Cinéma vérité''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|ᵻ|m|ə|_|v|ɛr|ᵻ|ˈ|t|eɪ}}; {{IPA-fr|sinema veʁite|lang}}; 'truthful cinema') is a style of [[documentary film]]making, invented by [[Edgar Morin]] and [[Jean Rouch]], inspired by [[Dziga Vertov]]'s theory about [[Kino-Pravda]]. It combines improvisation with the use of the camera to unveil truth or highlight subjects hidden behind crude reality.<ref>[http://www.maitres-fous.net/glossary.html Glossary of rouchinan terms] at [http://www.maitres-fous.net MAITRES FOUS net]</ref><ref>

[[File:Venn-diagram-cinema-verite-direct-cinema-observational-cinema.png|thumb|Cinéma vérité in relationship to direct cinema and observational cinema]]
It is sometimes called '''''observational cinema''''',<ref>[http://www.karamumedia12.wikispaces.com/file/view/Direct+Cinema.doc Direct Cinema] at [http://www.karamumedia12.wikispaces.com Karamumedia12]</ref><ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Criticism-Ideology/Documentary-OBSERVATIONAL-DOCUMENTARY.html Observational documentary] at [http://www.filmreference.com Film Reference]</ref> if understood as pure [[direct cinema]]: mainly without a narrator's [[voice-over]]. There are subtle, yet important, differences among terms expressing similar concepts. Direct Cinema is largely concerned with the recording of events in which the subject and audience become unaware of the camera's presence: operating within what [[Bill Nichols (film critic)|Bill Nichols]],<ref>Nichols, Bill. ''Introducing the Documentary''. Indiana University Press, 2001, p. 109</ref> an American historian and theoretician of documentary film, calls the "observational mode", a [[fly on the wall]]. Many therefore see a paradox in drawing attention away from the presence of the camera and simultaneously interfering in the reality it registers when attempting to discover a cinematic truth.

Cinéma vérité can involve stylized set-ups and the interaction between the filmmaker and the subject, even to the point of provocation.  Some argue that the obvious presence of the filmmaker and camera was seen by most cinéma vérité filmmakers as the best way to reveal the truth in cinema.<ref>[http://sensesofcinema.com/2002/feature-articles/rouch Jean Rouch: Cinéma-vérité, Chronicle of a Summer and The Human Pyramid] – Article by Barbara Bruni at Senses of Cinema, March 13, 2002</ref><ref>DIRECT CINEMA: Filmmaking Style and its relationship to “Truth” – Thesis by Bernice K. Shneider, B.A., Art History University of Massachusetts, [[MIT]] (1972)</ref><ref>[http://microwave.filmlondon.org.uk/get_the_knowledge/lo_budget_hi_quality/chapter_one_learning_from_the_masters_a_history_of_low/jean_rouch_the_film_maker_as_provocateur Jean Rouch – The Film-maker as Provocateur] – Article at Microwave</ref> The camera is always acknowledged, for it performs the raw act of filming real objects, people, and events in a confrontational way. The filmmaker's intention was to represent the truth in what he or she was seeing as objectively as possible, freeing people from any deceptions in how those aspects of life were formerly presented to them. From this perspective, the filmmaker should be the catalyst of a situation. Few agree on the meanings of these terms, even the filmmakers whose films are being described.

[[Pierre Perrault]] sets situations up and then films them, for example in ''[[Pour la suite du monde]]'' (1963) where he asked old people to fish for whale.  The result is not a documentary about whale fishing; it is about memory and lineage.  In this sense cinéma vérité is concerned with anthropological cinema, and with the social and political implications of what is captured on film.  How a filmmaker shoots a film, what is being filmed, what to do with what was filmed, and how that film will be presented to an audience, all were very important for filmmakers of the time.

In all cases, the ethical and aesthetic analysis of documentary form (see [[docufiction]]) of the 1950s and 1960s has to be linked with a critical look at post-war propaganda analysis. The best way to describe this type of cinema is probably to say that it is concerned with notions of truth and reality in film. Also feminist documentary films of the 1970s often used cinéma-vérité techniques. Soon this sort of 'realism' was criticized for its deceptive pseudo-natural construction of reality.<ref>[http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1485 A feminist critique of documentary film] – Paper at [http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange Serendip Studio] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105170318/http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/ |date=2012-11-05 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.tft.ucla.edu/mediascape/Fall08_Warren.pdf By, For, and About: The “Real” Problem in the Feminist Film Movement] – Paper by Shilyh Warren at Mediascape, [http://www.tft.ucla.edu UCLA]</ref>

[[Edgar Morin]] coined the term around the time of such essential films like 1960's ''[[Primary (film)|Primary]]''<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/godfather-cinema-verite The Godfather of Cinéma Vérité|The New Yorker]</ref> and his own 1961 collaboration with [[Jean Rouch]], ''[[Chronique d'un été|Chronicle of a Summer]]''.<ref>[https://www.criterion.com/films/28394-chronicle-of-a-summer Chronicle of a Summer (1961)|The Criterion Collection]</ref>

==Legacy==
Many film directors of the 1960s and later adopted use of the handheld camera, techniques and cinéma vérité styles for their fiction films based on screenplays and actors. They often had actors using improvisation to get a more spontaneous quality in their talks and action. Influential examples include director [[John Cassavetes]], who broke ground with his film ''Faces''.<ref>[http://www.allmovie.com/artist/john-cassavetes-p84410 John Cassavetes] in ''Allmovie'', accessed online on the ''New York Times'' website 23 October 2006.</ref> The techniques (if not always the spirit) of ''cinéma vérité'' can also be seen in fiction films from ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/cinema-verite-the-movement-of-truth/ Cinema Verite: The Movement of Truth|Independent Lens|PBS.org]</ref> to ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]''.<ref>[https://www.filmsite.org/bestfilmediting9.html Best Film Editing Sequences - filmsite.org]</ref>

Cinéma vérité was also readily adapted to use in TV fiction programs, such as ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', ''[[NYPD Blue]]'',<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/cinema-verite-the-movement-of-truth/ Cinema Verite: The Movement of Truth|Independent Lens|PBS.org]</ref> both the UK and American versions of ''[[The Office]]'', ''[[Parks & Recreation]]''<ref>[https://www.vulture.com/2015/02/how-parks-and-rec-transcended-its-mockumentary-roots.html How ‘Parks and Rec’ Transcended its Mockumentary Roots – Vulture]</ref>  and ''[[Modern Family]]''.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/cinema-verite-the-movement-of-truth/ Cinema Verite: The Movement of Truth|Independent Lens|PBS.org]</ref> Documentary series are less common, but ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'' is one of the famous non-fictional examples (even if albeit as tabloid television).<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/cinema-verite-the-movement-of-truth/ Cinema Verite: The Movement of Truth|Independent Lens|PBS.org]</ref>

It has also been the subject ripe for parodies and spoofs such as the acclaimed [[mockumentary film]] ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' <ref>[https://www.filmsite.org/scenes72.html Greatest Film Scenesand Moments - filmsite.org]</ref> and Emmy-nominated TV series ''[[Documentary Now]]'' (the latter paying homage to the style of such CV classics as ''Grey Gardens'' and ''The War Room''). <ref>[https://www.dailynews.com/2015/08/14/documentary-now-a-spoof-on-docs-by-snl-alums-seth-meyers-bill-hader-and-fred-armisen/ ‘Documentary Now!’ a spoof on docs by ‘SNL’ alums Seth Meyers, Bill Hader and Fred Armisen — Daily News]</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/20/documentary-now-bill-hader-fred-armisen Documentary Now!
