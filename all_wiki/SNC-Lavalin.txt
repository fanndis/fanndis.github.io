SNC's main rival in Canada was Lalonde, Valois International Limited, a company that was established in 1936 by engineers Jean-Paul Lalonde and Romeo Valois. Bernard Lamarre, who would later become director and CEO in 1962 and lead SNC for 29 years, had married Louise Lalonde, Jean-Paul Lalonde's daughter in 1952, and began working at Lalonde, Valois International Limited.<ref name="Grant_1988"/>{{rp|331}}<ref name="polymtl"/> In 1972, the company changed its name to Lavalin<ref name="polymtl"/>—combining syllables from the original company name.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Arsenault |first1=Julien |title=Bernard Lamarre, pioneer of Quebec engineering and former Lavalin president, dies at 84 |url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/pioneer-of-quebec-engineering-and-former-lavalin-president-dies-at-84 |accessdate=23 October 2018 |work=Montreal Gazette |agency=CP |publisher=Postmedia |date=30 March 2016}}</ref> In the 1970s, Lavalin designed and built the fabric roof for [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Montreal's Olympic Stadium]] and built the [[James Bay Project]], in a partnership with the United-States-based [[Bechtel]].<ref name="Grant_1988">{{cite book|title=International directory of company histories|first=Tina|last=Grant|isbn=1-55862-547-X|publisher=St. James Press|year=1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAnYAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>

According to a 1986 ''Maclean's'' article by Anthony Wilson-Smith, Lavalin was Canada's "largest engineering firm, with $625 million in operating revenues in 1985<ref name="macleans_Wilson_19860630"/> and 5,700 employees.<ref name="Grant_1988"/> SNC was the second largest".

Lavalin's shares were sold to [[Pelmorex]] in 1993. By 1990 Lavalin Inc included over 70 companies worth CA$1.2 billion. It was forced to sell to its rival SNC in 1991.

Bernard Lamarre remained with the newly formed company, SNC-Lavalin until 1999. He oversaw major projects including the [[Trans-Canada Highway|TransCanada highway]] in Montreal, the [[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine Bridge–Tunnel|Louis-Hippolyte-Lafontaine Bridge-Tunnel]], the [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] in Montréal, and Alcan in the Ville de La Baie.

==Acquisitions and partnerships==

According to Ingram, SNC-Lavalin partnered with Bombardier in the 1990s to build transportation projects in Malaysia and Turkey.

In June 2011, SNC-Lavalin purchased the commercial reactor division of [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL) from the [[Government of Canada]] for CA$15 million.

In May 2011, two former SNC-Lavalin International Inc.

=== SaskPower serious design flaws (2015) ===
In 2015, internal documents from [[SaskPower]] (the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] that is the principal electric utility in [[Saskatchewan]], Canada), revealed that there were "serious design issues" in the [[carbon capture and storage]] system at its coal-fired [[Boundary Dam Power Station]], resulting in regular breakdowns and maintenance problems that caused the unit to be operational only 40% of the time.

{{Main|SNC-Lavalin affair}}
Following a 2017 public consultation process, the Government of Canada moved forward with the establishment of a "made-in-Canada version of a [[deferred prosecution agreement (Canada)|deferred prosecution agreement (DPA)]] regime", called the "Remediation Agreement Regime",<ref name="PSPC_20180327">{{Cite news release| work = [[Public Services and Procurement Canada]] (PSPC)| title = Canada to enhance its toolkit to address corporate wrongdoing| access-date = February 18, 2019| date = March 27, 2018| url = https://www.canada.ca/en/public-services-procurement/news/2018/03/canada-to-enhance-its-toolkit-to-address-corporate-wrongdoing.html}}</ref> which was introduced in the March budget and came into effect in June 2018.<ref group="Notes">The Government of Canada held a consultation period in 2017 regarding the implementation of a deferred prosecution agreement similar to one used in the United Kingdom.
