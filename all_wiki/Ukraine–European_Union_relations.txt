{{Politics of Ukraine}}
'''Relations between the [[European Union]] (EU) and [[Ukraine]]''' are shaped through the [[Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement]] and the [[Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area]] (DCFTA). Ukraine is a priority partner within the [[Eastern Partnership]] and the [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] (ENP). The EU is seeking an increasingly close relationship with Ukraine, going beyond co-operation, to gradual economic integration and deepening of political co-operation.<ref name="EU & Ukraine 17 April 2014 FACT SHEET"/>

=== Early relations ===
Ukraine has long been seen as an important {{citation needed|date=February 2020}} but difficult political partner of the European Union. According to observers,{{Who|date=December 2013}} this is due to such factors as unwillingness of the EU to expand to the post-Soviet space, poor performance of the Ukrainian economy, lack of democracy (during the 1990s) or internal instability (following the [[Orange Revolution]]). Also, some experts{{Who|date=December 2013}} notice the importance of the Russian factor in Ukraine-EU relations.

{{Quote box|width=50%|align=right|quote=The European project has not been completed as yet. It has not been completed because there is no full-fledged participation of Ukraine. We envy [[Poland and the European Union|Poland]], but we believe that Ukraine will be in the European Union.

Ukraine's desire to join the European institutions dates back to 1994 when the government declared that integration to the EU is the main foreign policy objective. In reality, little was done since Kyiv had to take into account Russia, which remained its major trade partner and natural gas and fossil energy supplier.

The political dialogue between the EU and Ukraine started in 1994 when the [[Partnership and Cooperation Agreement]] (PCA) was signed. That document was focused on economic and social issues as well as on the necessity of improving public government and guaranteeing free press and civil rights. The framework set for political discussions was modest: yearly meeting between EU Troika and Ukrainian leadership and some inter ministerial consultations. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of 1994 entered into force in 1998 and expired in 2008. The first EU-Ukraine summit took place in September 1997 in [[Kyiv]].<ref name=UW28212EUU>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/73494 "EU-Ukraine Summits: 16 Years of Wheel-Spinning"], ''[[The Ukrainian Week]]'' (28 February 2012)</ref> During the second summit in October 1998 in [[Vienna]], Ukraine–EU relations were defined as a "strategic and unique partnership" and Ukraine first declared its desire to acquire associate membership in the EU.<ref name=UW28212EUU /> None of top level meetings brought major changes to a reserved EU approach. Leaders focused chiefly on [[post-communism]] economic transition and human rights records as well as on issues connected to the [[Chernobyl nuclear power plant]] and its containment.

In 2002, EU Enlargement Commissioner [[Günter Verheugen]] said that "a European perspective" for [[Ukraine]] does not necessarily mean membership within 10 to 20 years; however, it is a possibility. The same year [[Ukrainian President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] stated that Ukraine wanted to sign an association agreement with the EU by 2003–2004 and that his country would meet all EU membership requirements by 2007–2011.<ref name=UW28212EUU />

=== Post-Orange Revolution relations ===

The [[Orange Revolution]] of late 2004 improved Ukraine's European prospects; the opposition leader [[Viktor Yushchenko]] hinted that he would press the EU for deeper ties and described a four-point plan: acknowledgment of Ukraine as a market economy, entry in the [[World Trade Organization]], associate membership in the European Union, and, finally, full membership.<ref>[http://www.euobserver.com/?sid=24&aid=17977 EUobserver article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524013702/http://www.euobserver.com/?sid=24&aid=17977 |date=24 May 2005 }} (subscription only)</ref> [[Ukrainian President]] Viktor Yushchenko asked [[Brussels]] mid-December 2004 for a clearer indication of Ukraine's prospects for membership, saying that "The approved Action Plan reflects only the level of Ukraine-EU relations that we could have reached before the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|presidential elections in 2004]]."<ref>[http://www.euobserver.com/?sid=24&aid=18004 EUobserver article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524014007/http://www.euobserver.com/?sid=24&aid=18004 |date=24 May 2005 }} (subscription only)</ref>

On 13 January 2005, the [[European Parliament]] almost unanimously (467 votes to 19 in favour) passed a [[motion (democracy)|motion]] stating the wish of the European Parliament to establish closer ties with Ukraine in view of the possibility of EU membership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+TA+P6-TA-2005-0009+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN|title=European Parliament resolution on the results of the Ukraine elections (13 January 2005)|access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref> Though there is still a long way to go before negotiations about EU membership can start, the [[European Commission]] has stated that future EU membership will not be ruled out. Yushchenko has responded to the apathetic mood of the Commission by stating that he intends to send an application for EU membership "in the near future" and that he intends to scrutinise Ukraine's relationship with the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] in order to assure that EU integration is possible, and, if not, to make it possible. Several EU leaders have already stated strong support for closer economic ties with Ukraine, but have stopped short of direct support for such a bid.

On 21 March 2005, Polish Foreign Minister [[Adam Daniel Rotfeld]] noted that Poland will, in every way, promote Ukraine's desire to be integrated with the EU, achieve the status of a market-economy country, and join the [[World Trade Organization]]. He also said, "At the present moment, we should talk concrete steps in cooperation instead of engaging in empty talk about European integration". Three days later, a poll of the six largest EU nations conducted by a French research company showed that the European public would be more likely to accept Ukraine as a future EU member than any other country that is not currently an official candidate.

In October 2005, Commission president [[José Manuel Barroso]] said that the future of Ukraine is ''in'' the EU. On 9 November 2005, however, the European Commission in a new strategy paper suggested that the current enlargement agenda ([[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatia]] and in the future the other ex-[[Yugoslavia]]n countries) could block the possibility of a future accession of Ukraine, [[Armenia]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Moldova]]. Commissioner [[Olli Rehn]] said that the EU should avoid overexpansion, adding that the current enlargement agenda is already quite full.<ref>[http://euobserver.com/9/20289 EUobserver article] (subscription only)</ref>

According to the Ukrainian authorities, the ENP is not an adequate political instrument, since joining the EU was one of principal objectives of all governments since 1994.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} After the [[Orange Revolution]] of 2004 that brought to power [[Viktor Yushchenko]], the EU commission was very slow to react: little progress was made to put the largest European country on a path to eventual membership.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==== Association negotiations ====
In March 2007, the EU and Ukraine started talks about a new "wider agreement", aiming at offering a legal framework for a closer economic cooperation and a better political dialogue. It was agreed that Ukraine and the EU would start a parallel negotiation concerning setting up a free trade area. Later in 2007 it was announced that this issue would be incorporated into the draft agreement as a separate chapter.

Days before the summit, the Ministers of foreign affairs of Member States agreed during their meeting in [[Avignon]] (France) that association agreement to be signed with Ukraine will have nothing to do with the [[Stabilisation and Association Process|association agreements]] the EU signed with many Eastern European States (from Poland to Romania in the beginning of the 1990s, Western Balkans by the end of the 1990s). Media reported that the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany were strongly opposed to including "Ukraine is a European State" into EU legally binding documents. This was considered a failure of Kuchma-era politician Mr. Roman Shpek, then Ukrainian ambassador to Brussels. He was replaced by Mr. A. Veselovskyy, a more experienced diplomat.

A ''Joint EU–Ukraine Action Plan'' was endorsed by the European Council on 21 February 2005. It was based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of 1994 and provided, according to the European Commission, a comprehensive and ambitious framework for joint of work with Ukraine in all key areas of reform.<ref name="ec.europa.eu">{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/ukraine/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422121915/http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/ukraine/index_en.htm |archive-date=22 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

On 22 July 2008, it was announced that a "[[Stabilisation and Association process|Stabilisation and Association]]" -type agreement would be signed between Ukraine and the EU on 8 September 2008 in [[Évian-les-Bains]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-263031.html|title=New enhanced agreement between Ukraine and EU called "Agreement on Association"|access-date=23 October 2014}}</ref>

=== Second Tymoshenko government ===
{{See also|2008 EU–Ukraine Summit}}
On 2 October 2008, Ukraine President Yushchenko announced that the Association agreement between the country and the EU would be signed "within six-eight months". On that day, he met with the King of Sweden [[Charles XVI Gustav]], who paid a state visit to Kyiv. According to Yushchenko, "the agreement is half-ready, and he hopes that there will be a possibility to finalise and sign it under Swedish presidency in the EU". He also welcomed the initiative of [[Eastern Partnership]] suggested earlier by Polish and Swedish Foreign Ministers.

On 20–24 October 2008, the EU and Ukraine held a negotiation round on the free trade area chapter of the Association agreement. According to some Ukrainian media,{{Who|date=December 2013}} the "EU promised to liberalise trade relations". Ukraine's representative told that one must not "focus too much" on negotiation since there is much to be done by the Ukrainian government to meet certain criteria. He also said, that "soon, the Balkans will enter into the European trade space and therefore Ukraine might lose these markets". This was seen as a reason for Ukraine to move forward as least as soon as Balkans, the EU did not comment on that perception.

On 29 October 2008, the EU Commissioner Jacques Barrot and Ukrainian officials met in [[Brussels]] to launch negotiations on visa-free travel. Kyiv had been asking for a "road map" to visa lifting, including travel document security, irregular migration, public order and foreign relations. But the EU justice commissioner avoided to give any specific dates. Moreover, the Ukrainian side argued that the 2007 visa facilitation agreement is not fully implemented by the EU member states. The European Commission representative was quoted as saying that Brussels is ready to impose sanctions against those who do not respect the agreement. Spanish, Dutch, German and Belgian embassies were cited among the most active rule breakers. Making visa processing lengthy and expensive is one of the major agreement violations. On 28 October 2008 [[List of Prime Ministers of Belgium|Belgian PM]] [[Yves Leterme]] told that Ukrainians need to avoid middlemen in visa procedures if they want to reduce their cost. The problem is that some consulates, including Belgian, oblige visa seekers to deal with a middleman.

According to Ukrainian President Yushchenko, some embassies of EU countries often require Ukrainians to present documents, which had not been foreseen in the agreement on simplification of visa regulations. Around five per cent of Ukrainians willing to travel to the EU are denied visas, which, according to Yushchenko, "does not meet the standards of our agreements with the EU".<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-320724.html President requests to push improvement of Ukraine-EU visa relations], [[UNIAN]] (12 June 2009)</ref>

On 4 June 2009, some media outlets reported that Germany's [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] openly stated in its programme that Ukraine has the right for the EU membership in the long term. This was the first major German political party to state this.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/uk/%D0%BF%D1%96%D0%B4%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D0%B7-%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BB%D1%96%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D1%96%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%86%D1%8C%D0%BA%D1%96-%D0%BB%D1%96%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8-%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%B2%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BF-%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%97%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D0%B2-%D1%94%D1%81/a-4302635|title=Підтримка з Берліна: німецькі ліберали за вступ України в ЄС &#124; DW &#124; 04.06.2009|website=DW.COM}}</ref>

On 16 June 2009, a new practical instrument was adopted – the ''EU-Ukraine Association Agenda''.<ref name="rac.org.ua"/>

In September 2009, high-ranking Ukrainian diplomats proposed that Ukraine apply for EU membership after the [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election|presidential election]] in January 2010, around March 2010, which would mean that the official response to the application would likely take place in early 2011 during the Polish [[presidency of the European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/28676|title=EUobserver / Ukraine diplomats take risk on EU application|access-date=23 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=Rettman>Rettman, Andrew (17 September 2009) [http://euobserver.com/9/28676 Ukraine diplomats take a risk on EU application], [[EUobserver]]</ref>  However, this hasn't happened.

On 5 October 2009, the Chairman of the [[Committee of the Verkhovna Rada on issues of European integration]] [[Borys Tarasyuk]] commented "the EU see the implementation of a free visa regime for Ukrainians travelling to [[member states of the European Union]] only as a long-term prospect". Ukrainian politicians continue to insist that the implementation of that free visa regime take place by 2012, when the [[EURO 2012|European Football Championship]] will be held in Ukraine and [[Poland]]. According to Tarasyuk, the main obstacles to the implementation of a free visa regime between Ukraine and EU is the fact that Ukraine "hasn't finished its work on legislation concerning forming a demographic [database], which then could become a good basis for issuing biometric passports" and the fact that there is no general database on the issuing of foreign passports to Ukrainian citizens. According to Tarasyuk the EU fear that this grants the opportunity for mass falsification.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/50110 Tarasiuk: European Union not to implement free visa regime with Ukraine in near future], [[Kyiv Post]] (5 October 2009)</ref>

On 16 December 2009 the [[European Commission President]] [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] stated "our Ukrainian friends need to do more if they want us to help them more." He also stated that "enlargement is not possible in the current situation."<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/55208/ Barroso: Ukrainian friends of Europe should do more if they hope for assistance], [[Kyiv Post]] (16 December 2009)</ref>

==== Eastern Partnership (2009) ====
[[File:European Union Eastern Partnership.svg|thumb|Members of the [[Eastern Partnership]]]]
{{main|Eastern Partnership}}
Ukraine is one of six post-Soviet nations to be invited to cooperate with the EU within the new multilateral framework that the [[Eastern Partnership]] is expected to establish. However, Kyiv pointed out that it remains pessimistic about the "added value" of this initiative. Indeed, Ukraine and the EU have already started the negotiations on new, enhanced political and free-trade agreements (Association and Free-Trade Agreements). Also, there has been some progress in liberalising the visa regime despite persistent problems in the EU Member States' visa approach towards Ukrainians.

That is why Ukraine has a specific view of the Eastern Partnership project. According to the Ukrainian presidency, it should correspond, in case of his country, to the strategic foreign policy objective, i.e. the integration with the EU.<ref name="president.gov.ua"/> Yet, the Eastern Partnership documents (the European Council Declaration of May 2009)<ref name="consilium.europa.eu"/> do not confirm such priorities as political and economic integration or lifting visas.

Ukraine has expressed enthusiasm about the project. Ukraine deputy premier [[Hryhoriy Nemyria]] said that the project is the way to modernise the country and that they welcome the Eastern Partnership policy, because it uses 'de facto' the same instruments as for [[Future enlargement of the European Union|EU candidates]].<ref name="more influ">[http://euobserver.com/9/27827 EU expanding its 'sphere of influence,' Russia says], ''[[EU Observer]]'', 21 March 2009</ref>

Under the Eastern Partnership, Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30&nbsp;km of the border. Up to 1.5&nbsp;million people may benefit from this agreement, which took effect on 1 July 2009.<ref name="borders"/>

=== Viktor Yanukovych presidency ===
In May 2010, President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] promised to adopt in June 2010 the legislation necessary for creating a free trade zone between Ukraine and the European Union (EU).{{refn|Late September 2013 President Yanukovych stated establishing a free trade zone between Ukraine and the EU "will have a significant positive impact on the [[Great Recession in Europe|economic situation in Europe]] at large and will help the process of Europe's emergence from the crisis" and that according to experts, this establishment would increase the [[EU market]] by almost 7%, the production of goods services in Europe by more than 1%, and the exports of European goods and services to the world markets by almost 1%.<ref>[http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/yanukovych-ukraines-domestic-market-accession-to-eu-market-to-help-europe-out-of-crisis/ Yanukovych: Ukraine’s domestic market accession to EU market to help Europe out of crisis], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (25 September 2013)</ref>|group=nb}} Yanukovych expected visas between Ukraine and [[Member states of the European Union|EU member states]] to be abolished and that a [[free trade zone]] will be created by March 2011.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/67511/ Yanukovych: Laws for creation of Ukrainian-EU free trade zone will be adopted in June], [[Kyiv Post]] (25 May 2010)</ref>

The [[Azarov Government]] continued to pursue EU-integration. During May and June 2010 both Prime Minister [[Mykola Azarov]] and [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)|Ukrainian Foreign Minister]] [[Kostyantyn Gryshchenko]] stated that integration into Europe has been and remains the priority of domestic and foreign policy of Ukraine.<ref name=Azarovyes>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/66824/ Integration into EU unchanged priority of Ukraine's policy, says foreign minister], [[Kyiv Post]] (15 May 2010)</ref><ref name=Azarovyes2>[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/40400/ Ukraine's plans for EU membership unchanged, says PM], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (3 June 2010)</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/10229626.stm Ukraine's parliament votes to abandon Nato ambitions], [[BBC News]] (3 June 2010)</ref>

To coordinate preparation of Ukraine for European integration, the Government of Ukraine has adopted a [[Plan on Priority Measures for European Integration of Ukraine|Plan on Priority Measures for European Integration of Ukraine for 2013]].

== Legal instruments ==

=== Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (1994) ===
The political dialogue between the EU and Ukraine started in 1994 when the [[Partnership and Cooperation Agreement]] (PCA) was signed. That document was focused on economic and social issues as well as on the necessity of improving public government and guaranteeing free press and civil rights. The framework set for political discussions was modest: yearly meeting between EU Troika and Ukrainian leadership and some inter ministerial consultations. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of 1994 entered into force in 1998 and expired in 2008. None of the top level meetings brought any major changes to a reserved EU approach. Leaders focused chiefly on [[transition economy|economic transition]] and human rights records as well as on issues connected to the [[Chernobyl nuclear power plant]] and its containment.

A ''Joint EU–Ukraine Action Plan'' was endorsed by the European Council on 21 February 2005. It was based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of 1994 and provided, according to the European Commission, a comprehensive and ambitious framework for joint work with Ukraine in all key areas of reform.

==== Eastern Partnership (EaP) ====
{{main|Eastern Partnership}}

The Eastern Partnership is a forum aiming to improve the political and economic trade-relations of the six [[Post-Soviet states]] of "strategic importance" – [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Armenia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] with the [[European Union]].<ref name="EU funds">[http://euobserver.com/9/27824  EU assigns funds and staff to 'Eastern Partnership'], ''[[EU Observer]]'', 20 March 2009</ref> The EU draft of the EaP states that: "Shared values including democracy, the [[rule of law]], and respect for human rights will be at its core, as well as the principles of [[market economy]], [[sustainable development]] and [[good governance]]." The Partnership is to provide the foundation for new Association Agreements between the EU and those partners who have made sufficient progress towards the principles and values mentioned.<ref name="EaP core">[http://euobserver.com/24/27799 "Values to form core of EU 'Eastern Partnership'"], ''[[EU Observer]]'', 18 March 2009</ref>

Ukraine is one of six post-Soviet nations to be invited to cooperate with the EU within the new multilateral framework that the Eastern partnership is expected to establish. However, Kyiv pointed out that it remains pessimistic about the "added value" of this initiative. Indeed, Ukraine and the EU have already started the negotiations on new, enhanced political and free-trade agreements (Association and Free-Trade Agreements). Also, there has been some progress in liberalising the visa regime despite persistent problems in the EU Member States' visa approach towards Ukrainians.

That is why Ukraine has a specific view of the Eastern Partnership Project. According to the Ukrainian presidency, it should correspond, in case of his country, to the strategic foreign policy objective, i.e. the integration with the EU.<ref name="president.gov.ua">http://www.president.gov.ua, 24 March 2009</ref> Yet, the Eastern Partnership documents (the European Council Declaration of May 2009)<ref name="consilium.europa.eu">http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/en/er/107589.pdf</ref> do not confirm such priorities as political and economic integration or lifting visas.

Ukraine has expressed enthusiasm about the project. Ukraine deputy premier [[Hryhoriy Nemyria]] said that the project is the way to modernise the country and that they welcome the Eastern Partnership policy, because it uses 'de facto' the same instruments as for [[Future enlargement of the European Union|EU candidates]].<ref name="more influ" />

Under the Eastern Partnership, [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]] have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30&nbsp;km of the border. Up to 1.5&nbsp;million people may benefit from this agreement which took effect on 1 July 2009.<ref name="borders">{{cite news | url = http://wyborcza.pl/1,91446,6728669,Ukraina__Sikorski__umowa_o_malym_ruchu_granicznym.html | title = Sikorski: umowa o małym ruchu granicznym od 1 lipca | date = 17 June 2009 | work = [[Gazeta Wyborcza]] | access-date = 17 June 2009}}</ref>

=== Negotiations of an Association Agreement (AA) ===
{{main|European Union Association Agreement}}

An Association agreement (AA) between Ukraine and the EU was negotiated from 2009–2011, and should replace the existing PCA. The AA aims for political association and economic integration, includes a "deep and comprehensive [[free trade area]]", and runs parallel to the negotiations for a [[Visa policy in the European Union#Visa exemptions|visa-free regime]]. It does not contain a membership perspective for Ukraine, though it recalls it as "a European country with European identity" and says that "the EU acknowledged the European aspirations of Ukraine".

On 16 June 2009, a new practical instrument was adopted – the ''EU-Ukraine Association Agenda''.<ref name="rac.org.ua">http://www.rac.org.ua/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/enp/EU_Ukraine_Association_Agenda.pdf</ref>  19 December 2011 EU-Ukraine summit, which was intended to lead to the signature of the Agreement, fell short due to the EU's concerns over the jailing of former premier [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]. The end of negotiations were announced, but the text of the agreement was not signed with EU leaders deciding to wait until the [[2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election|October 2012 Parliamentary elections]] as a test of the vitality of democracy and rule of law in Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/ukraine/press_corner/all_news/news/2011/2011_12_20_01_en.htm|title=Ukraine-EU Summit Joint Statement (20/12/2011)|access-date=23 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=19dec>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/38718 Ukrainian Week], 20 December 2011</ref> The AA was initialed shortly thereafter, on 30 March 2012.<ref name="DCFTA">{{cite web|url=http://un.ua/eng/article/401526.html|title=Ukraine, EU Initial Deep And Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement With EU|publisher=[[Ukrainian News Agency]]|date=20 July 2012|access-date=29 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=KPAANov122012>[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/eu-criticizes-ukraines-oct-28-parliamentary-election-316005.html "EU criticises Ukraine's Oct. 28 parliamentary election"], [[Kyiv Post]] (12 November 2012)</ref> Before it enters into force it must be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament, the European Parliament, and each EU member state.<ref name=KPAANov122012/><ref name=EUobs5112012>[http://euobserver.com/foreign/118094 EU-Ukraine summit 'unlikely' this year], EU Observer (5 November 2012)</ref> However, EU leaders have suggested that the agreement will not be ratified unless Ukraine addresses concerns over a "stark deterioration of democracy and the [[Judicial system of Ukraine|rule of law]]", including the imprisonment of [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] and [[Yuriy Lutsenko]] in 2011 and 2012.<ref name=KPHS161112/><ref name="KPshelvedEUUKRAgr20712"/><ref name="got4year27212"/> In November 2012, [[EU Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy]] [[Stefan Fule]] stated that the AA, and DCFTA, could be signed in November 2013 if the EU's concerns were addressed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eu-commissioner-eu-ukraine-may-sign-association-agreement-next-year-181497841.html|title=EU Commissioner: EU, Ukraine May Sign Association Agreement Next Year|date=30 November 2012|access-date=31 January 2013|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/europes-east/fuele-pours-cold-water-ukraine-e-news-516374|title=Füle pours cold water on Ukraine's EU hopes|date=30 November 2012|access-date=31 January 2013|publisher=EurActiv}}</ref>

However, in February 2013 Fule warned Ukraine that the agreements could be abandoned if the required reforms are not made quickly.  He also stated that Ukrainian membership in the [[Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia]] would be incompatible with the agreements with the EU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/2/8/worldupdates/reform-quickly-or-lose-deals-eu-tells-ukraine&sec=Worldupdates|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130413160102/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/2/8/worldupdates/reform-quickly-or-lose-deals-eu-tells-ukraine&sec=Worldupdates|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 April 2013|title=Reform quickly or lose deals, EU tells Ukraine|date=8 February 2013|access-date=9 February 2013|last=Auyezov|first=Olzhas|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]}}</ref>

Ukraine and all EU member states are also signatories of the 1998 Trade Amendment reflecting the change from the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] to the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]].<ref name=konoplyanik/>

After its entry into force, Ukraine held an Observer status for the Treaty establishing the [[Energy Community]] (also referred as ''European Energy Community''), a community established between the [[European Union]] (EU) and a number of third countries in order to extend the [[Energy policy of the European Union|EU internal energy market]] to [[South East Europe]] and beyond.  The Treaty establishing the Energy Community was signed in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], on 25 October 2005, and entered into force on 1 July 2006. Ukraine soon expressed its interest in full membership. Mandated by the Energy Community Ministerial Council, the [[European Commission]] had the first round of formal negotiations with Ukraine in late 2008. After three negotiation rounds, the technical negotiations with Ukraine were concluded in 2009. The Ministerial Council, however, made the membership conditional on legislative amendments. In concrete, it requested Ukraine to revise its gas law so that it complies with EU's Gas Directive 2003/55/EC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0055:EN:HTML|title=Directive 2003/55/EC of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas|access-date=23 October 2014}}</ref> Following the amendment of the gas law in July 2010, Ukraine signed the Energy Community Accession Protocol on 24 September 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy-community.org/pls/portal/docs/728177.PDF|title=Ukraine's Accession Protocol to the Energy Community|access-date=23 October 2014}}</ref> ratified the Treaty on 15 December 2010<ref name=UkrDecrat>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/92905/ Energy Community congratulates Ukraine on ratifying accession protocol], [[Kyiv Post]] (15 December 2010)</ref> and officially acceded the Energy Community on 1 February 2011.

===Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement===
{{Main|Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement}}

== Economic relations ==
During the 1990s, Germany, the [[Netherlands]] and Italy remained major trading partners of Ukraine.
According to [[Eurostat]], between 2000 and 2007 EU trade in goods with Ukraine more than tripled in value: exports rose from 5.5 bn [[Euro]] to 22.4 bn, while imports increased from 4.8 bn Euro to 12.4 bn. Nevertheless, this increase didn't make Ukraine one of the EU's major trading partners. In 2007, Ukraine accounted for only 2% of EU exports and a mere 1% of European Union imports which is toward the bottom of the EU's top 20 trading partners (16th).<ref name=Eurostat>European Commission/Eurostat paper issued before 9 September EU-Ukraine summit in Paris.</ref>

According to the European commission paper, trade with Ukraine is dominated by manufactured goods. Nearly half of the EU exports to Ukraine in 2007 were machinery and vehicles and a further quarter were other manufactured articles. A quite similar structure can be seen in imports: unspecified manufactured articles accounted for two fifths followed by a crude metal for a further fifth. At the more detailed level, the main EU exports to Ukraine in 2007 were medicine, motor vehicles and mobile phones, while the main imports were iron and steel products, as well as sunflower seed oil, ferro-nickel, iron ores and oil.<ref name=Eurostat/>

Among the EU27 Members States, Germany (5.9 bn Euro or 26% of EU exports) was the largest exporter, followed by [[Poland]] (4.1 bn or 18%). Italy (2.4 bn or 19%) was the largest importer followed by [[Bulgaria]] (1.6 bn or 13%) and Germany (1.3 bn or 11%).<ref name=Eurostat/>

The largest surpluses in trade with Ukraine in 2007 were observed in Germany (+ 4.6 bn Euro) and [[Poland]] (+2.8 bn Euro) while [[Bulgaria]] scored the highest deficit ( -1.4 bn Euro).<ref name=Eurostat/>

=== EU Financial Assistance to Ukraine ===
{{main|Third-country economic relationships with the European Union}}
For the 2000–2006 budgetary period, the financial assistance of the EU to Ukraine was framed in the '''TACIS''' programme, established in 1991, a programme of technical assistance that supports the process of transition to [[market economy|market economies]] for the 11 [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

For the 2007–2013 budgetary period, '''ENPI''', standing for "European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument", covers the ENP countries, and replacing the TACIS funds for Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enpi-info.eu/index.php?lang_id=450|title=ENPI Info Centre|access-date=23 October 2014}}</ref> Ukraine is moreover eligible for horizontal instruments, that cover countries regardless of their region, such as:
* the '''[[Instrument for Stability]]''', a new instrument to tackle crises and instability in third countries and address trans-border challenges including [[nuclear safety]] and non-proliferation, the fight against trafficking, organised crime and terrorism;
* the '''[[Macroeconomics|Macro Financial]] Assistance'''

=== WTO membership of Ukraine (2009) ===
Since 2009, with the accession of [[Ukraine]] to the [[World Trade Organization]], economic relations between the EU and Ukraine have to respect the WTO normative acquis. The EU has always believed that WTO membership can play a key role in supporting Ukraine's economic reform, especially in the context of a transition economy. In joining the WTO, Ukraine benefits from secure access to the markets of all WTO members and commits to providing the kind of stable trade and investment environment that will attract further trade and investment.
