'''NBC News''' is the news division of the American broadcast [[television]] network [[NBC]]. The division operates under [[NBCUniversal Television Group#NBCUniversal News Group|NBCUniversal News Group]], a division of [[NBCUniversal]], which is, in turn, a subsidiary of [[Comcast]].

==History==

===Caravan era===
The first regularly scheduled American television newscast in history was made by NBC News on February 21, 1940, anchored by [[Lowell Thomas]] (1892-1981),  and airing weeknights at 6:45&nbsp;p.m.  It was simply Lowell Thomas in front of a television camera while doing his NBC network radio broadcast, the television simulcast seen only in New York.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Lowell|last=Thomas|title=So Long Until Tomorrow|location=New York|publisher=Wm. Morrow and Co|year=1977|isbn=0-688-03236-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/solonguntiltomor00thom/page/17 17]–19|author-link=Lowell Thomas|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/solonguntiltomor00thom}}</ref> In June 1940, NBC, through its flagship station in [[New York City]], W2XBS (renamed commercial WNBT in 1941, now [[WNBC]]) operating on channel one, televised 30¼ hours of coverage of the [[Republican National Convention]] live and direct from [[Philadelphia]]. The station used a series of relays from Philadelphia to New York and on to upper [[New York State]], for rebroadcast on W2XB in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] (now [[WRGB]]), making this among the first "network" programs of NBC Television. Due to wartime and technical restrictions, there were no live telecasts of the 1944 conventions, although films of the events were reportedly shown over WNBT the next day.

About this time, there were irregularly scheduled, quasi-network newscasts originating from NBC's WNBT in New York City, ([[WNBC]]), and reportedly fed to WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) in Philadelphia and [[WRGB]] in Schenectady, NY. Such as, Esso sponsored news features a well as The War As It Happens in the final days of World War II, another irregularly scheduled NBC television newsreel program which was also seen in New York, Philadelphia and Schenectady on the relatively few (roughly 5000) television sets which existed at the time. After the war, ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' aired filmed news highlights with narration. Later in 1948, when sponsored by [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel Cigarettes]], ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' was renamed ''[[Camel Newsreel Theatre]]'' and then, when [[John Cameron Swayze]] was added as an on-camera anchor in 1949, the program was renamed ''[[Camel News Caravan]]''.

In 1948, NBC teamed up with ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine to provide election night coverage of President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s surprising victory over New York governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. The television audience was small, but NBC's share in New York was double that of any other outlet.<ref>[http://www.tvobscurities.com/2009/02/new-york-city-hooper-ratings-for-election-night-1948/ "New York City Hooper Ratings for Election Night 1948"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302083754/http://www.tvobscurities.com/2009/02/new-york-city-hooper-ratings-for-election-night-1948/ |date=March 2, 2009 }} TVObscurities.com.</ref> The following year, the ''[[Camel News Caravan]]'', anchored by [[John Cameron Swayze]], debuted on NBC.

Beginning in 1951, NBC News was managed by Director of News Bill McAndrew, who reported to Vice President of News and Public Affairs J. Davidson Taylor.<ref name="Frank">{{Cite book|last=Frank|first=Reuven|title=Out of Thin Air: The Brief Wonderful Life of Network News|url=https://archive.org/details/outofthinairinsi00fran_43|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1991}}</ref>

===Huntley-Brinkley era===
[[File:NBC News promotional photo 1961.JPG|thumb|180px|NBC News had close to 700 correspondents and cameramen in 1961 who were stationed throughout the world. Film was received in the United States by plane or by the jointly operated NBC-[[BBC]] transatlantic film cable.]]
Television assumed an increasingly prominent role in American family life in the late 1950s, and NBC News was called television's "champion of news coverage."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Manchester|first=William|title=The Death of a President|url=https://archive.org/details/deathofpresiden00manc|url-access=limited|location=New York|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1967|page=[https://archive.org/details/deathofpresiden00manc/page/190 190]|author-link=William Manchester}}</ref> NBC president [[Robert Kintner]] provided the news division with ample amounts of both financial resources and air time.<ref name="Matusow"/> In 1956, the network paired anchors [[Chet Huntley]] and [[David Brinkley]] and the two became celebrities,<ref name="Whitworth"/> supported by reporters including [[John Chancellor]], [[Frank McGee (journalism)|Frank McGee]], [[Edwin Newman]], [[Sander Vanocur]], [[Nancy Dickerson]], [[Tom Pettit]], and Ray Scherer.

Created by Producer [[Reuven Frank]], NBC's ''[[The Huntley–Brinkley Report]]'' had its debut on October 29, 1956.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/06/13/journalist-helped-usher-in-heyday-of-network-news/6960cc59-67b1-4b01-93ff-6fef486c454e/|title=Journalist Helped Usher In Heyday of Network News|last=Barnes|first=Bart|date=13 June 2003|website=The Washington Post}}</ref> During much of its 14-year run, it exceeded the viewership levels of its CBS News competition, anchored initially by [[Douglas Edwards]] and, beginning in April 1962, by [[Walter Cronkite]].
[[File:NBC logo 1954.svg|left|thumb|NBC Logo 1954]]
NBC's Vice President of News and Public Affairs, J. Davidson Taylor, was a Southerner who, with Producer Reuven Frank, was determined that NBC would lead television's coverage of the [[civil rights movement]].<ref name="RobertsAndKlibanoff">{{Cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Gene|last2=Klibanoff|first2=Hank|title=The Race Beat: The Press, the Civil Rights Struggle, and the Awakening of a Nation|url=https://archive.org/details/racebeatpressciv00gene|url-access=limited|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=2006|page=[https://archive.org/details/racebeatpressciv00gene/page/155 155]|author-link=Gene Roberts (journalist)}}</ref> In 1955, NBC provided national coverage of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s leadership of the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], airing reports from Frank McGee, then News Director of NBC's Montgomery affiliate [[WSFA|WSFA-TV]], who would later join the network.<ref name="Halberstam"/> A year later, John Chancellor's coverage of the [[Little Rock Nine|admission of black students]] to [[Little Rock Central High School|Central High School]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] was the first occasion when the key news story came from television rather than print<ref name="Halberstam">{{Cite book|last=Halberstam|first=David|title=[[The Fifties (book)|The Fifties]]|location=New York|publisher=Villard Books|year=1993|author-link=David Halberstam}}</ref> and prompted a prominent U.S. senator to observe later, "When I think of Little Rock, I think of John Chancellor."<ref name="Frank"/>  Other reporters who covered the movement for the network included Sander Vanocur, Herbert Kaplow, Charles Quinn, and Richard Valeriani,<ref name="RobertsAndKlibanoff"/> who was hit with an ax handle at a demonstration in [[Marion, Alabama]] in 1965.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Raines|first=Howell|title=My Soul Is Rested: Movement Days in the Deep South Remembered|location=New York|publisher=G.P.

While Walter Cronkite's enthusiasm for the space race eventually won the anchorman viewers for CBS and NBC News, with the work of correspondents such as Frank McGee, Roy Neal, [[Jay Barbree]], and [[Peter Hackes]], also provided ample coverage of American manned space missions in the [[Project Mercury]], [[Project Gemini]], and [[Project Apollo]] programs. In an era when space missions rated continuous coverage, NBC configured its largest studio, [[NBC Radio City Studios|Studio 8H]], for space coverage. It utilized models and mockups of rockets and spacecraft, maps of the earth and moon to show orbital trackage, and stages on which animated figures created by puppeteer [[Bil Baird]] were used to depict movements of astronauts before on-board spacecraft television cameras were feasible. (Studio 8H had been home to the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] and is now the home of ''[[Saturday Night Live]].'') NBC's coverage of the first moon landing in 1969 earned the network an [[Emmy Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/5462500|title=The Moments before the Eagle Landed|publisher=NBC News|date=July 20, 2004|first=Jay|last=Barbree|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In the late 1950s, Kintner reorganized the chain of command at the network, making Bill McAndrew president of NBC News, reporting directly to Kintner.<ref name="Frank"/>  McAndrew served in that position until his death in 1968.<ref name="Frank"/> McAndrew was succeeded by his Executive Vice President, Producer Reuven Frank, who held the position until 1973.<ref name="Frank"/>

On November 22, 1963, NBC interrupted various programs on its affiliate stations at 1:45&nbsp;p.m. to announce that [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy had been shot]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. Eight minutes later, at 1:53:12&nbsp;p.m., NBC broke into programming with a network bumper slide and [[Chet Huntley]], [[Bill Ryan (journalist)|Bill Ryan]] and [[Frank McGee (journalist)|Frank McGee]] informing the viewers what was going on as it happened; but since a camera was not in service, the reports were audio-only. However, NBC did not begin broadcasting over the air until 1:57&nbsp;p.m. ET. About 40 minutes later, after word came that JFK was pronounced dead, NBC suspended regular programming and carried 71 hours of uninterrupted news coverage of the assassination and the [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|funeral]] of the president—including the only live broadcast of the fatal shooting of Kennedy's assassin, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], by [[Jack Ruby]] as Oswald was being led in handcuffs by law-enforcement officials through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters.<ref>{{cite book|author=NBC News|title=There Was a President|location=New York|publisher=Random House|year=1966}}</ref>

===''NBC Nightly News'' era===
[[File:Nightlynewslogo2019.png|thumb|NBC Nightly News Logo 2019]]
NBC's ratings lead began to slip toward the end of the 1960s and fell sharply when Chet Huntley retired in 1970 (Huntley died of cancer in 1974). The loss of Huntley, along with a reluctance by RCA to fund NBC News at a similar level as CBS was funding its news division, left NBC News in the doldrums. NBC's primary news show gained its present title, ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'', on August 3, 1970.

The network tried a platoon of anchors (Brinkley, McGee, and [[John Chancellor]]) during the early months of ''Nightly News''. Despite the efforts of the network's eventual lead anchor, the articulate, even-toned Chancellor, and an occasional first-place finish in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsens]], ''Nightly News'' in the 1970s was primarily a strong second.<ref name="Matusow"/> By the end of the decade, NBC had to contend not only with a powerful CBS but also a surging [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], led by [[Roone Arledge]]. [[Tom Brokaw]] became sole anchor in 1983, after co-anchoring with [[Roger Mudd]] for a year, and began leading NBC's efforts. In 1986 and 1987, NBC won the top spot in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsens]] for the first time in years,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/29/arts/abc-surpasses-cbs-in-evening-news-ratings.html?pagewanted=print|title=ABC Surpasses CBS in Evening News Ratings|work=The New York Times|date=November 29, 1989|first=Jeremy|last=Gerard|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827130510/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/29/arts/abc-surpasses-cbs-in-evening-news-ratings.html?pagewanted=print|archive-date=August 27, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> only to fall back when Nielsen's ratings methodology changed.

In 1993, ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' broadcast an investigative report about the safety of [[General Motors]] (GM) trucks. GM discovered the "actual footage" utilized in the broadcast had been rigged by the inclusion of explosive incendiaries attached to the gas tanks and the use of improper sealants for those tanks. GM subsequently filed an anti-defamation lawsuit against NBC, which publicly admitted the results of the tests were rigged and settled the lawsuit with GM on the very same day.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kf0zqDyLgBkC&pg=PA191|title=Speaking Respect, Respecting Speech|author=Richard L.

On October 22, 2007, ''Nightly News'' moved into its new high definition studios, at Studio 3C at [[NBC Studios (New York)|NBC Studios]] in 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City. The network's 24-hour cable network, [[MSNBC]], joined the network in New York on that day as well. The new studios/headquarters for NBC News and MSNBC are now located in one area.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

=== 2007–2016 ===
During the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis of 2007–2008]], NBC News was urged to save $500 million by NBC Universal. On that occasion, NBC News laid off several of its in-house reporters such as [[Kevin Corke]], Jeannie Ohm and Don Teague. This was the largest layoff in NBC News history.

After the sudden death of the influential moderator [[Tim Russert]] of ''[[Meet the Press]]'' in June 2008, [[Tom Brokaw]] took over as an interim host; and on December 14, 2008, [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] became the new moderator of the show until August 14, 2014, when NBC announced that NBC News Political Director [[Chuck Todd]] would take over as the 12th moderator of [[Meet the Press]] starting September 7, 2014.

On March 27, 2012, NBC News broadcast an edited segment from a 911 call placed by [[George Zimmerman]] before he [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin|shot Trayvon Martin]].

===NBC News Radio===
{{anchor|NBC News Radio}}
[[File:Nbcnewsradio.svg|thumb|NBC News Radio logo|left]]
'''NBC News Radio''' is an [[Internet radio|Internet-only]], [[All-news radio|all-news]] and current affairs radio station produced by [[iHeartMedia]] through its TTWN Networks [[subsidiary]], in partnership with NBCU's news division. It has been available on [[iHeartRadio]], iHeartMedia's online live audio and [[Podcast|podcasting]] platform, on different supports ([[Website|Web]] and [[Mobile app|smartphone apps]]) since July 2016. It can be heard around the clock in 15-minute cycles with the latest news, sports and other features. It uses the slogan "The news you want, when you want it."<ref>[https://www.iheart.com/live/nbc-news-radio-6043/ iHeart.com/live/NBC-News-Radio]</ref>

While it is not owned by NBCUniversal itself, it features reports from NBC News [[correspondent]]s, presented by anchors who are iHeartMedia employees. It is also provided to NBC's 24/7 News Source radio station [[network affiliate|affiliates]] as a service, including one-minute and two-minute hourly newscasts along with other audio content, such as features on money, health, politics and sports, heard on over 1,000 radio stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insideradio.com/nbc-news-iheart-partner-on-news-network/article_f2df5c76-4785-11e6-b665-a7716dddc8e4.html|title=NBC News, iHeart Partner on 24/7 News Network.}}</ref> As of 2016, [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] in [[New York City]] serves as NBC News Radio's [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]], while [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO]] in [[San Diego]] serves as the network's [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] flagship station.

The current NBC News Radio digital station is NBC's first step into the all-news radio format since the closure of its ephemeral '''NBC News & Information Service (NIS)''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fadedsignals.com/post/63776466378/nbc-launched-the-nbc-news-and-information-service|title=Faded Signals|website=Faded Signals|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> a former analog radio network targeted at [[FM broadcasting|FM stations]], which lasted only from 1975 till 1977. The original major [[NBC Radio Network]] would be purchased by [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] a decade later, in 1987, as [[General Electric]], which had acquired NBC's parent company [[RCA]], divested most properties not pertaining to the NBC television network, thus ending its direct participation in the radio business. NBC Radio Network's news operation was merged into the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]], then into Westwood One's then-corporate sibling [[CBS Radio]], and eventually assimilated into the syndicator itself.

For years, Westwood One has carried on syndicating several NBC-branded shows to affiliate radio stations, including audio versions of current-affairs NBC TV shows such as ''[[Meet the Press]]'', a practice that continues to date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westwoodone.com/programming/news/programs/meet-the-press/|title=Meet the Press|website=Westwood One|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> As for ''hard news'' programming, Westwood One used to provide an homonymous ''NBC News Radio'' service, which was initially limited to a feed of one-hour reports updated from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. ET offered to subscriber local stations. [[Dial Global]] –which has branded itself ''Westwood One'' since 2013– announced on March 5, 2012 its aim to expand NBC News Radio to a full-time 24-hour radio news network, replacing [[CNN Radio]] (that itself replaced both NBC Radio and Mutual in 1999). The original NBC News Radio service was eventually discontinued on December 14, 2014, coinciding with the launch of the new, [[White-label product|white-label]] [[Westwood One News]] service,<ref name="rw-nbcnrww1end">{{cite news|url=https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/westwood-one-to-drop-nbc-news-radio|title=Westwood One to Drop NBC News Radio|date=October 16, 2014|work=[[Radio World]]|accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref> which uses content and [[human resources]] from [[WarnerMedia]]'s [[CNN]] instead of those of NBC News.

In addition to NBC News Radio, audio-only simulcast of NBC News' TV channels [[MSNBC]] and [[CNBC]] are also officially available as Internet radio stations through the [[TuneIn]] podcasting service as well as the [[Sirius XM|SiriusXM]] [[satellite radio]] platform.

===''NBC News Overnight'' and ''NBC'' ''Nightside''===
In 1982, NBC News began production on ''[[NBC News Overnight]]'' with anchors [[Linda Ellerbee]], [[Lloyd Dobyns]], and Bill Schechner.  It usually aired at 1:35&nbsp;a.m. E.T., following ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.

NBC News Overnight was cancelled in December 1983, but in 1991, NBC News launched another overnight news show called ''[[NBC News Nightside|NBC Nightside]]''. During its run, the show's anchors included Sara James,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-11-02/features/1991306090_1_newscast-nightside-nbc-to-launch|title=NBC to launch overnight newscast|publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|work=[[Knight Ridder]] News Service|date=November 2, 1991|accessdate=January 28, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201231244/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-11-02/features/1991306090_1_newscast-nightside-nbc-to-launch|archive-date=February 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Bruce Hall, [[Antonio Mora]], Tom Miller, [[Campbell Brown (journalist)|Campbell Brown]], Kim Hindrew, Tom Donavan, and Tonya Strong.  It was based at NBC [[Network affiliate]] [[WCNC-TV]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].  It provided an overnight news service which NBC affiliates could air until early morning programming began, in effect providing programming to help them stay on the air 24/7.  At the time, a few NBC affiliates had begun using [[CNN]]'s [[Headline News]] service to provide overnight programming, and NBC decided to offer the network's own overnight news service.  [[CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] also began their own overnight news programming, as well. In addition, the facility produced a 24-hour news service aimed to Latin American viewers called "Canal de Noticias, NBC.  The serviced closed in 1997 and five years later, the network bought Telemundo.

''NBC Nightside'' lasted until 1998 and was replaced by "NBC All Night," composed of reruns of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', and later from January 1, 2007 to September 23, 2011, ''[[Poker After Dark]]''. NBC now airs same day repeats of the [[Today with Kathie Lee and Hoda|fourth hour of ''Today'']] and CNBC's ''[[Mad Money]]'' on weekdays, [[LXTV]] programs on early Sunday mornings, and ''Meet the Press'' and ''Dateline'' encores on early Monday mornings.

==International broadcasts==
MSNBC is not shown outside the Americas on a channel in its own right. However, both NBC News and MSNBC are shown for a few hours a day on [[OSN News]] in [[MENA]] Region.

MSNBC is also shown occasionally on sister network [[CNBC Europe]] during [[breaking news]], and Nightly News and Meet the Press are also shown regularly. ''NBC Nightly News'' is shown in the Philippines on [[9TV]] (formerly [[Talk TV (Philippines)|Talktv]] and [[Solar News Channel]]), while ''Early Today'' was officially dropped from the network in December 2013, but they replaced by the repeats of [[Inside Edition]]. ''NBC Nightly News'', along with the full program lineup of NBC, was carried by affiliate [[VSB-TV]] in Bermuda.

The [[Seven Network]] in [[Australia]] has close ties with NBC and has used a majority of the network's imaging and slogans since the 1970s. ''[[Seven News]]'' has featured ''[[The Mission (theme music)|The Mission]]'' as its news theme since the mid-1980s. Local newscasts were named ''Seven Nightly News'' from the mid-1980s until around 2000. NBC and Seven will often share news recourses between the two countries. NBC News has been known to use Seven News reporters for live reports on a developing news story in Australia. Seven News will sometimes also incorporate an NBC News report into its national bulletins. ''Today'', ''Weekend Today'' and ''Meet The Press'' are all broadcast on the [[Seven Network]] during the early morning hours from 3-5 a.m., just before Seven's own morning show ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]''.

In [[Hong Kong]], ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' is [[live television|live digital television broadcast transmission]] (or [[broadcast delay|delayed]]) on [[TVB Pearl]] daily from 7:00 AM until 8:00 AM [[Hong Kong Time]] (6:00 PM until 7:00 PM [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|New York City Time]]).

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, used to air segments from ''NBC Nightly News'' on their ''[[ITV News at 5:30]]'' morning newscast before it was cancelled in December 2012. NBC News share facilities and crew in the UK with [[ITN]], which is the news provider for ITV.

==Theme music==
Most of NBC's news television programs use "[[The Mission (theme song)|The Mission]]" by [[John Williams]] as their theme. The composition was first used by NBC in 1985 and was updated in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|author=Submitted by NBC Universal|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=822|title=SoundtrackNet: News: Legendary Composer John Williams Composes New "NBC Sunday Night Football" Theme|publisher=[[Soundtrack.net]]|date=August 30, 2006|accessdate=November 27, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021032305/http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=822|archive-date=October 21, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
