The '''Department for Education''' ('''DfE''') is a [[British government departments|department of Her Majesty's Government]] responsible for [[child protection]], [[Education in England|education]] (compulsory, further and higher education), apprenticeships and wider skills in [[England]].

A Department for Education previously existed between 1992, when the [[Department of Education and Science (UK)|Department of Education and Science]] was renamed, and 1995 when it was merged with the [[Department for Work and Pensions|Department for Employment]] to become the [[Department for Education and Employment]].

==History==

The DfE was formed on 12 May 2010 by the incoming [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Cameron ministry]], taking on the responsibilities and resources of the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] (DCSF).

In June 2012 the Department for Education committed a breach of the UK's [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] due to a security flaw on its website which made email addresses, passwords and comments of people responding to consultation documents available for download.<ref>{{citation|title=ICO: Education ministry BROKE the Data Protection Act|last=Fiveash|first=Kelly|publisher=The Register|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/19/department_for_education_breaks_data_protection_act_after_online_smut_consultation_system_leaks_sensitive_details_of_respondents/|date=19 October 2012|accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref>

In July 2016, the Department took over responsibilities for higher and further education and for apprenticeship from the dissolved [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]].<ref name="CSW">Matt Foster, [https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/new-department-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy-swallows-decc-and-bis-%E2%80%94-full New Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy swallows up DECC and BIS – full details and reaction], ''Civil Service World'' (14 July 2016).</ref>
