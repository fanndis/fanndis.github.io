'''Garbiñe Muguruza Blanco''' ({{IPA-es|ɡaɾˈβiɲe muɣuˈɾuθa ˈβlaŋko}};{{efn|In isolation, ''Blanco'' is pronounced {{IPA-es|ˈblaŋko|}}.}} born 8 October 1993) is a [[Spain|Spanish]]-[[Venezuelan]] professional tennis player and former world No. 1. Since turning professional in 2012, she has won seven singles titles, including two [[Grand Slam (tennis)|majors]]: the [[2016 French Open]] and the [[2017 Wimbledon Championships]].

Equipped with powerful groundstrokes and an aggressive style of play, Muguruza came to prominence in 2014, after reaching the last 16 at the [[2014 Australian Open|Australian Open]], beating former world No. 1, [[Caroline Wozniacki]], en route. She then defeated then-world No. 1, [[Serena Williams]], in the second round of the [[2014 French Open|French Open]], beating her in straight sets in Williams’ most lopsided loss at a major, and reaching the quarterfinals.

In 2015, at the [[2015 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]], she made it to her first Grand Slam final where she lost to Serena Williams, and then won her maiden [[WTA Premier tournaments|Premier]]-level crown by capturing the [[2015 China Open (tennis)|China Open]] title. The same year, she qualified for her first [[2015 WTA Finals|WTA Finals]] in singles, scoring a perfect winning record in the round-robin stage before losing to eventual champion [[Agnieszka Radwańska]] in the semifinals.

Muguruza has been successful in doubles, winning five titles, finishing runner-up at the [[2015 WTA Finals]] and reaching the [[2014 French Open]] semifinals. She achieved those results with her compatriot [[Carla Suárez Navarro]].

==Personal life==
Garbiñe Muguruza was born in [[Caracas]], Venezuela, on 8 October 1993 to Venezuelan mother, Scarlet Blanco and [[Basque people|Basque]] father José Antonio Muguruza.<ref>{{cite news |last=Echániz|first=P|date=11 December 2012 |title=Mi gran sueño es ganar el Open USA|trans-title=My great dream is to win the US Open|url=http://www.diariovasco.com/20121211/deportes/mas-deportes/gran-sueno-ganar-open-201212111303.html|newspaper=[[Diario Vasco]]|access-date=9 July 2015|language=es}}</ref><ref>[https://www.euskalkazeta.com/spanish-basque-wins-womens-wimbledon-2017/ ''Spaniard-Basque wins Women’s Wimbledon 2017'']</ref> She has two elder brothers named Asier and Igor, and has dual Spanish-Venezuelan nationality.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/09/wimbledon-garbine-muguruza-surprises-everyone-even-herself-by-reaching-final|title=Wimbledon: Muguruza surprises everyone - even herself - by reaching final|first=Esther|last=Addley|date=9 July 2015|via=The Guardian}}</ref> Muguruza began playing tennis at the age of three.

Muguruza occasionally plays the guitar in her free time.

==Playing style and coaching==
Muguruza is known for her flat, powerful groundstrokes from both wings. They allow her to take time away from her opponents and dictate baseline rallies, despite the fact that Muguruza may often refrain from going for the lines, or outright winners.<ref>http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2017/08/mugurza-proved-she-can-win-non-major-and-made-herself-favorite/68641/</ref> She also possesses a powerful serve that is capable of reaching speeds of up to {{cvt|113|mph}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/players/overview/wta316239.html|title=Garbine Muguruza Player Profile|website=www.wimbledon.com}}</ref> Fellow tennis player [[Agnieszka Radwańska]] describes Muguruza's playing style as being "very explosive, especially from every shot. So forehand, backhand, serve, return, everything is coming to you so fast."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/tennis/tired-muguruza-gives-tennis-a-fresh-and-fabulous-look|title=Tired Muguruza gives tennis a fresh and fabulous look|last=hermes|date=1 November 2015}}</ref>

Her ability to move and slide effectively on clay leaves her noted for her clay-court prowess, having reached the second week at [[French Open|Roland Garros]] every year from 2014 to 2019, and was crowned champion in Paris in 2016. Muguruza has said that "clay is [her] territory",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/french-open-2016-garbine-muguruza-warns-rivals-theyll-be-stepping-into-my-territory-at-roland-garros-a6991461.html|title=Muguruza warns rivals they'll be in 'my territory' at French Open|date=19 April 2016}}</ref> as she feels most comfortable on the surface. However, as a result of her high-risk game style, her inconsistency is discussed in the tennis community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosport.com/tennis/french-open/2016/inconsistent-garbine-muguruza-has-proven-there-is-only-more-to-come_sto5635448/story.shtml|title=Garbine Muguruza: Inconsistent but there is only more to come|date=4 June 2016}}</ref> Her game can lend itself to several unforced errors and double faults in any given match, and she often loses matches to players ranked several places below her. She had been coached by [[Alejo Mancisidor]] from 2010 to 2015, but then hired Sam Sumyk in 2015. Since then, Muguruza has attempted to finish more points off at the net, which has seen mixed results.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/06/04/garbine-muguruza-crashes-out-of-the-french-open-to-kristina-mladenovic-6684323/|title=Defending champion Garbine Muguruza crashes out of the French Open to Kristina Mladenovic}}</ref> Muguruza split from Sumyk in 2019, and began working again with [[Conchita Martínez]] that November. Martinez previously coached Muguruza at [[Wimbledon 2017]], where she won the title. After working with Martínez, Muguruza became more selective when choosing to approach the net, and improved her net game significantly - in her 2020 Australian Open match against [[Elina Svitolina]], Muguruza made 16 net approaches, and won 14 of these net points.

Muguruza won both of her singles rubbers in the [[2015 Fed Cup World Group II]], defeating [[Irina-Camelia Begu]] and world No. 3, Simona Halep, but Spain lost the tie 2–3 after Muguruza and her compatriot, [[Anabel Medina Garrigues]], lost the deciding doubles rubber. At the [[2015 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai Championships]], Muguruza reached her first Premier-5 semifinal in singles, defeating qualifier [[Jarmila Gajdošová]], 12th seed Jelena Janković, fifth seed Agnieszka Radwańska and 13th seed and doubles partner Suárez Navarro before falling to the 17th seed and eventual runner-up, [[Karolína Plíšková]], in three sets. She also reached the final of the [[2015 Dubai Tennis Championships – Women's Doubles|doubles]] with Suárez Navarro. The following week, Muguruza retired from her first-round match against Suárez Navarro at the [[2015 Qatar Total Open|Qatar Open]] while trailing 6–5 in the first set.

In March, she lost to Karolina Plíšková in the third round of the [[2015 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells Masters]] after a second-round win over American wildcard [[Irina Falconi]]. Despite this, she rose to a career-high singles ranking of 19 after the event. A fortnight later, Muguruza reached the third round of the [[2015 Miami Open|Miami Open]] after defeating qualifier [[Sesil Karatantcheva]] but lost to the 11th seed Sara Errani, after winning the first set.

Muguruza reached the second round of the three clay-court events that she competed in leading into the [[2015 French Open|French Open]].

Muguruza made a poor start into the grass-court season, losing in the first round of the [[2015 Aegon Classic|Birmingham Classic]] and the third round of the [[2015 Aegon International|Eastbourne International]] after a first-round bye. However, she and Suárez Navarro won their first grass-court [[2015 Aegon International – Doubles|doubles]] title in Birmingham, defeating [[Andrea Hlaváčková]] and [[Lucie Hradecká]] in straight sets in the final.

During the [[2015 US Open Series|US Open series]], Muguruza did not enjoy much success, dropping her opening matches in [[2015 Rogers Cup|Toronto]] and [[2015 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati]] to qualifiers [[Lesia Tsurenko]] and Yaroslava Shvedova respectively. At the [[2015 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], she recorded her first win at the tournament by defeating German [[Carina Witthöft]] in the first round. However, she fell short to [[Johanna Konta]] in the following round in three sets, the match was a total time of 3 hours and 23 minutes, the longest women's singles match in that tournament's history since the introduction of tiebreaker in 1970.

Muguruza kicked off the Asian swing at the [[2015 Toray Pan Pacific Open|Pan Pacific Open]] where she advanced to the last eight after defeating [[Barbora Strýcová]] before losing to eventual finalist [[Belinda Bencic]], in straight sets. At the [[2015 Wuhan Open|Wuhan Open]], Muguruza cruised into her second straight quarterfinal at the event after dispatching [[Sloane Stephens]] and Ana Ivanovic. She then went on to defeat the likes of [[Anna Karolina Schmiedlova]] and Kerber to reach the final where she faced Venus Williams but was forced to retire in the second set with an ankle injury. Muguruza was able to crack the top 5 for the first time in her career after the tournament's conclusion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/5048612/title/garbine-muguruza-the-new-world-no5|title=GARBIÑE MUGURUZA: The New world No. 5=WTATennis.com|date=5 October 2015|access-date=5 October 2015}}</ref> At the [[2015 China Open (tennis)|China Open]], Muguruza breezed by [[Irina Falconi]] before going the distance against [[Mirjana Lučić-Baroni]] to advance to the quarterfinals. With the win, Muguruza qualified for the [[2015 WTA Finals|WTA Finals]] for the first time. She will be the first Spaniard to compete at the year-end championships since [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]] in 2001. She then beat [[Bethanie Mattek-Sands]] and Radwańska to advance to her maiden Premier Mandatory final. With her semifinal win over Radwańska, Muguruza reached a career high of world No. 4. She went on to defeat Bacsinszky in straight sets to claim her first Premier Mandatory title and her biggest title of her career.

Muguruza then traveled to Singapore for the WTA Finals, where she went undefeated in the round-robin play, beating Petra Kvitová, Angelique Kerber, and Lucie Šafářová. She then lost to eventual champion Agnieszka Radwańska in the semifinals. Muguruza also competed in doubles in Singapore, where she and Suárez Navarro reached the final. However, they lost to the No. 1 seeds Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza.

===2016: French Open champion and world No. 2===
[[File:Garbiñe Muguruza Roland Garros 2016.jpg|Muguruza holds her trophy after winning the 2016 French Open|thumb|left]]
Muguruza started her year at Brisbane International, when she already had to retire in her first match of the tournament due to [[plantar fasciitis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brisbaneinternational.com.au/2016/01/muguruza-retires-injured-with-foot-injury|title=Muguruza retires with foot injury|work=Brisbane International|access-date=6 June 2016|date=6 January 2016}}</ref> Her next tournament was the [[Australian Open]], where she ensured a spot in the third round with straight set wins over [[Anett Kontaveit]] and Kirsten Flipkens, but fell to Barbora Strýcová. At the [[Fed Cup]], Muguruza helped in Spain's tie against Serbia with wins over [[Ivana Jorović]] and [[Jelena Janković]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://inserbia.info/today/2016/02/fed-cup-spain-defeats-serbia/|title=Spain one step far from Fed Cup world group|work=InSerbia News|access-date=6 June 2016|date=6 February 2016}}</ref>

At the Dubai Tennis Championships, Muguruza suffered another early loss as she fell to eventual semi-finalist [[Elina Svitolina]]. Her next tournament was the [[WTA Qatar Open|Qatar Open]], where she reached first quarterfinal of the year, defeating [[Nao Hibino]] and Tímea Babos, but lost then to Andrea Petkovic in three sets. Next she played in [[2016 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells Open]], where she lost in her opening match against [[Christina McHale]] after receiving first round bye. At the [[2016 Miami Open|Miami Open]], she was close to being defeated in the opening match against Dominika Cibulkova but survived in the final set. She reached the fourth round but lost to the Indian Wells and eventual champion Victoria Azarenka in two tiebreakers.

She kicked off the clay court season by participating the [[2016 Fed Cup World Group Play-offs|Fed Cup]] against Italy. She scored wins against Francesca Schiavone and No. 7, Roberta Vinci, to help Spain enter the World Group next year. She then played in [[2016 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Stuttgart Open]]. She reached her second quarterfinals of the season where she lost to Petra Kvitová. At the [[2016 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid Open]], she lost in the second round against [[Irina-Camelia Begu]], despite serving for the match. She then went on to reach her first WTA semifinals of the season in [[2016 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Rome]], after defeating top ten opponent Timea Bacsinszky in quarterfinals, but lost to [[Madison Keys]] in straight sets.

At the [[2016 French Open – Women's Singles|French Open]], Muguruza turned her season around, unexpectedly capturing her first major title. She lost the first set against Anna Karolina Schmiedlova in her first round match but won in three sets. After that she easily reached her second major final without losing a set in the next five matches, including wins over former champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round, surprise quarterfinalist [[Shelby Rogers]], and former runner-up Sam Stosur in the semi-finals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/tennis/french-open-live-australian-samantha-stosur-vs-spains-garbine-muguruza-in-womens-semifinals/news-story/31055e553a00aa62084dc9314d0e1c16|title=Samantha Stosur beaten in straight sets by Garbine Muguruza in French Open semi-finals|work=Fox Sports|access-date=3 June 2016}}</ref> In the final, she faced world No. 1, Serena Williams, in a rematch of the previous year's [[2015 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon final]], and won in straight sets for her maiden major title.<ref name="cnn">{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/04/tennis/french-open-serena-williams-muguruza-tennis/ | title=Garbine Muguruza upsets Serena Williams for French Open women's title|work=CNN|access-date=6 June 2016|date=4 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Nick McCarvel|title=Serena Williams' six losses in major finals|url=http://www.9news.com/news/nation-now/serena-williams-six-losses-in-grand-slam-finals/231698846|access-date=4 June 2016|work=9News|date=4 June 2016}}</ref> She marked 14 straight sets won after losing the first she played. With the title she rose to a career high No. 2 in the WTA rankings of 6 June 2016. She is also the first Spanish female player to win a major title since [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]] in 1998.<ref name="cnn" /> By winning, Muguruza became the second player of either gender born in the 1990s to win a Major title after Petra Kvitová first did so at the [[2011 Wimbledon Championships]].

Muguruza started off the grass season by playing in her home tournament the [[Mallorca Open]], where she was the No. 1 seed. However, she suffered a first-round exit to former Wimbledon semifinalist Kirsten Flipkens in straight sets, marking the third tournament of the year where she lost in her first match played and her second consecutive loss to Flipkens on grass. Muguruza returned to grass for [[2016 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] as the second favorite with the chance to usurp the top ranking from Williams while being heralded as the leader of the next generation, following Williams' recent slump in tournament finals. Though Muguruza won her opening match against Camila Giorgi in a high quality display, she was quickly upset by [[Jana Čepelová]] in the second round. Unable to defend her finalist points from the previous year, Muguruza regressed to world No. 3 at the end of the tournament. At the Rio Olympic Games, Muguruza arrived as one of the favorite players to win in the women's singles tennis event. She defeated [[Andreea Mitu]] of Romania and [[Nao Hibino]] of Japan to progress to the third round. However, she was defeated comprehensively by the eventual gold medalist [[Monica Puig]] of Puerto Rico.

Muguruza did not have much success during the US Open series, either. At the [[2016 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], she suffered another second-round loss, this time to [[Anastasija Sevastova]]. She did not fare well during the Asian Swing, with early round losses at the [[2016 Toray Pan Pacific Open|Pan Pacific Open]] in Tokyo, the [[2016 Wuhan Open|Wuhan Open]] in Wuhan, and the [[2016 China Open (tennis)|China Open]] in Beijing. The loss in Beijing was significant, because Muguruza was the defending champion, and she therefore dropped in ranking after the tournament. However, she still qualified for the [[2016 WTA Finals|WTA Finals]]. Muguruza was defeated in the round robin stage, her only win coming from a three-set match against Svetlana Kuznetsova. She ended the season ranked No. 7.

===2017: Wimbledon crown and world No. 1===
{{main|2017 Garbiñe Muguruza tennis season}}
Muguruza started the season at the [[2017 Brisbane International|Brisbane International]], being the No. 4 seed. She made a run to the semifinals after three-set wins over Sam Stosur and [[Daria Kasatkina]], and a straight sets win over Svetlana Kuznetsova. She then retired in the first set of her semifinal match against Alizé Cornet due to injury. At the [[2017 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Muguruza beat Marina Erakovic, [[Samantha Crawford]], Anastasija Sevastova and [[Sorana Cîrstea]] en route to her first quarterfinal at the tournament.

[[File:Muguruza WM17 (29) (36143095646).jpg|thumb|right|Muguruza at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships where she was a champion]]
Muguruza suffered early losses at the start of the clay season, losing in her opening matches in [[2017 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Stuttgart]] and [[2017 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid]] to Anett Kontaveit and Timea Bacsinszky respectively. She bounced back in [[2017 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Rome]] by reaching the semifinals, before she had to retire against Elina Svitolina in the first set due to a neck injury. Muguruza entered the [[2017 French Open|French Open]] as the defending champion, where she reached the fourth round, losing to home favourite [[Kristina Mladenovic]] in three sets. In that game against Mladenovic, Muguruza had to face an extremely unfavorable crowd as well, almost bordering on unsportmanship-like behavior, since most of her unforced errors were celebrated not only by Mladenovic but by the crowd too. As she left the court and was receiving an ovation from the crowd, she was seen shaking her head and demanding the crowd not to applaud, since they wanted her to lose. In the following press conference, when asked about the pressure she suffered from the crowd, she started to cry and had to quit the press conference for about five minutes before she came to resume her thoughts on the match. This prompted a huge reaction in the Spanish sporting press, with some making the comment that "The Suzanne Lenglen Court looked more like the Stade de France, and it was as if there was a football game going on and not a tennis match".<ref>https://as.com/tenis/2017/06/04/roland_garros/1496564881_683219.html</ref> Since she failed to defend her title, Muguruza fell from the top 10.

Prior to Wimbledon, Muguruza began her grass court season at the [[Birmingham Classic (tennis)|Birmingham Classic]] where she beat [[Elizaveta Kulichkova]], [[Alison Riske]] and CoCo Vandeweghe before losing in the semi-finals to eventual runner-up [[Ashleigh Barty]]. She followed that with a second round exit at the [[Eastbourne International]], losing to Barbora Strýcová.

As the 14th seed, Muguruza reached the [[2017 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] fourth round, beating [[Ekaterina Alexandrova]], [[Yanina Wickmayer]] and Sorana Cîrstea. She then faced the previous year's runner-up and world No. 1, Angelique Kerber, eventually beating her in three sets. She then defeated 7th seed Svetlana Kuznetsova and then 87th-ranked Magdaléna Rybáriková, both in straight sets, to advance to her second Wimbledon final. There, she defeated 10th seed Venus Williams in straight sets, clinching her second major title, and became the first ever player to defeat both Williams sisters in major singles finals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/wimbledon-winner-muguruza-joins-multiple-major-club-kuznetsova-azarenka-kvitova-kerber-serena-sharapova-venus-williams|title=Wimbledon winner Muguruza joins multiple major club|last=Kane|first=David|date=16 July 2017|work=WTA Tennis|access-date=16 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Muguruza started her hard court summer in Stanford, beating [[Kayla Day]] and [[Ana Konjuh]] before losing in the semifinals to Madison Keys. She next travelled to Toronto for the [[Rogers Cup]], and recorded wins over Kirsten Flipkens and Ashleigh Barty. Muguruza lost in the quarterfinals to Elina Svitolina. Muguruza's next tournament was the Western and Southern Open in Cincinnati. She won two tough three set matches against Madison Keys and Svetlana Kuznetsova to make it to the semifinals. There she faced Karolína Plíšková, the world No. 1, to whom she had lost six times in a row. This time Muguruza turned the tables and won in two sets. In the final she played Simona Halep, dropping only one game in 57 minutes to capture the fifth title of her career. This also marked the first time in which she won multiple titles in one season.

Muguruza entered the [[2017 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]] as a contender for the No. 1 WTA rankings. She beat Rybáriková in a rematch of the Wimbledon semifinal to reach the fourth round of the US Open for the first time, where she lost to Petra Kvitová in straight sets. Despite the loss, Muguruza rose to the No. 1 ranking after reigning No. 1 Karolína Plíšková's loss to CoCo Vandeweghe in the quarterfinals, and became the 24th woman to achieve the ranking.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/muguruza-becomes-new-wta-world-no1|title=Muguruza becomes new WTA World No.1|date=6 September 2017|work=WTA Tennis|access-date=8 September 2017|language=en}}</ref> Muguruza and [[Rafael Nadal]] made [[Spain]] the first country since the [[United States]] 14 years ago to simultaneously top both the [[ATP Rankings|ATP]] and the [[WTA Rankings|WTA]] rankings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/garbine-muguruza-joins-rafael-nadal-as-world-no-1-4839088/|title=Garbine Muguruza joins Rafael Nadal as World No 1|date=2017-09-11|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en-US}}</ref>

In Tokyo she lost to Caroline Wozniacki in the semifinals, winning only two games. She then lost in the quarterfinals of the [[2017 Wuhan Open|Wuhan Open]] to [[Jeļena Ostapenko]] and retired in the first round of the [[2017 China Open - Women's Singles|China Open]] to [[Barbora Strýcová]] after losing eight of the first nine games. With Simona Halep advancing to the final of the event, Muguruza ultimately lost the No. 1 ranking. Shortly after, she was named WTA Player of the Year. Muguruza was seeded second at the [[2017 WTA Finals - Singles|WTA Finals]] and was drawn in the red group alongside Karolína Plíšková, Venus Williams and Jeļena Ostapenko. She won her first match against Ostapenko in straight sets before losing to Plíškova, winning two games in both sets. Muguruza then faced Williams for a place in the semifinals but ended up losing in straight sets. This loss ended Muguruza's chances of gaining the year-end No. 1 ranking.

===2018: Mixed results, out of top 10===
Muguruza started the season at the [[2018 Brisbane International|Brisbane International]], where she was the top seed. After receiving a bye into the second round, she faced [[Aleksandra Krunić]], but was forced to retire due to cramping in the third set.
