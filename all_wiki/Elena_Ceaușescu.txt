'''Elena Ceaușescu''' ({{IPA-ro|eˈlena t͡ʃe̯auˈʃesku}}; ''née'' '''Lenuța Petrescu'''; 7 January 1916<ref>{{cite web|title=FOND C.C.

She was also the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Romania]].

==Background==
She was born Lenuța Petrescu into a peasant family in [[Petreşti, Dâmboviţa|Petrești]] [[Communes of Romania|commune]], [[Dâmboviţa County|Dâmbovița County]], in the historical region of [[Wallachia]]. Her father worked as a [[plough]]man. She was able to acquire only an [[elementary school]] level education. After elementary school, she moved along with her brother to [[Bucharest]], where she worked as a laboratory assistant before finding employment in a textile factory. She joined the Bucharest branch of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] in 1939 and met 21-year-old Nicolae Ceaușescu. Ceaușescu was instantly attracted to her which, reportedly, made him never look at another woman in a romantic manner.<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=978-0-375-42532-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref> Their relationship was interrupted by Ceaușescu's frequent stints in prison, and they married on 23 December 1947.

==Career in government==
[[File:1975 Elena Ceausescu Honoris Causa Manilla.jpg|thumb|Elena Ceaușescu receiving an honorary doctorate in [[Manila]] (1975).]]
After the Communists took power, Elena Ceaușescu worked as a secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was an unimportant figure until her husband became [[Romanian Communist Party General Secretary|Communist Party General Secretary]]. Starting in July 1972, Elena Ceaușescu was given various offices at senior levels in the [[Romanian Communist Party]]. In June 1973, she became a member of the Politburo of the Romanian Communist Party, becoming the second most important and influential person after her husband. She was deeply involved in party administration alongside her husband, and was one of the few spouses of a Communist Party leader to have a high political profile of her own.

Elena Ceaușescu frequently accompanied her husband on official visits abroad. During a state visit to the [[People's Republic of China]] in June 1971, she took note of how [[Jiang Qing]], Chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s wife, maintained a position of power. Most likely inspired by this, she began to engineer her own political rise in Romania. In July 1971, after a [[Cultural Revolution (Romania)|mini-cultural revolution]] launched by her husband, she was elected a member of the Central Commission on Socio-Economic Forecasting, and in July 1972, she became a full member of the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee. In June 1973, after having been nominated by [[Emil Bodnăraş|Emil Bodnăraș]], she was elected to the party's executive committee. In November 1974, at the 11th Party Congress, she was made a member of the (renamed) political executive committee, and in January 1977, she became a member of the highest party body, the Permanent Bureau of the Political Executive Committee. In March 1975, she was elected to the [[Great National Assembly]], the country's national legislature, holding the seat for [[Pitești]], [[Arges County]], the most important industrial region of the country, until her death in 1989.  In March 1980, she was made a [[Deputy Prime Minister of Romania|First Deputy Prime Minister]], a state title she held until she was executed in the [[Romanian Revolution]].<ref>[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-8-63.shtml Enhanced Personality Cult for Elena Ceausescu]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 1986-1-8</ref>

[[File:1975 Ceausescus Tokio Hirohito.jpg|thumb|left|Elena and [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] with Emperor [[Hirohito]] during a visit in Tokyo in 1975]]
From the early 1980s onward, Elena was the object of a [[Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality|personality cult]] as intense as that of her husband, which exalted her as the "Mother of the Nation". By all accounts, her vanity and desire for honours exceeded that of her husband. As with her husband, [[Romanian Television]] was under strict orders to take great care portraying her on screen. For instance, she was never supposed to be shown in profile because of her large nose and overall homely appearance.<ref name=Revolution1989/>

==Fall from power==
{{main|Romanian Revolution|Trial and execution of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu}}
Ceaușescu fled with her husband on 22 December 1989, after the events in [[Timișoara]] led to the [[Romanian Revolution]], but she and her husband were captured in the town of [[Târgoviște]].  At the show trial that took place, she answered only a few questions since her husband took a protective role, asked her to calm down and shook his head each time her mouth opened to reply in anger.

==Execution==
On the afternoon of 25 December 1989 in [[Târgovişte|Târgoviște]], they were turned over to a firing squad and executed. Her arms, and those of her husband, were tied behind their backs. Their actual execution was not filmed in time – the firing squad was in a hurry to carry out the sentence – but the aftermath, including echoes of the final volley, the pall of smoke, and the bodies immediately afterward, were caught on camera. She was 73 years old.<ref>Juan J.

Ceaușescu was outlived by her mother, a near centenarian at the time of her death, her brother Gheorghe Petrescu (also an important figure in the party) and her three children: [[Valentin Ceauşescu|Valentin]] (b. 1948), [[Zoia Ceauşescu|Zoia]] (1949–2006) and [[Nicu Ceauşescu|Nicu]] (1951–1996), who was also an important member of the Romanian Communist Party. Elena Ceaușescu was buried in [[Ghencea Cemetery]].

==Reputation as a chemistry researcher==
After graduating from primary school in her village and moving to Bucharest, Ceaușescu attempted to continue her education through night courses, but allegedly was expelled after being caught cheating.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} During the communist period she was promoted as a scientist, and was also awarded a PhD in chemistry.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.gandul.info/articol_34827/piesa_rara__teza_de_doctorat_a_elenei_ceausescu.html ''Piesă rară: teza de doctorat a Elenei Ceauşescu'' ("Unique: the PhD Thesis of Elena Ceauşescu")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504124046/http://www.gandul.info/articol_34827/piesa_rara__teza_de_doctorat_a_elenei_ceausescu.html |date=4 May 2007 }}, in [[Gândul]], 26 March 2007</ref>

In 1957, she was a research scientist at ICECHIM (National Institute for Chemical Research). In the early 1960s, she was reported to be secretary of the party committee of the Bucharest Central Institute of Chemical Researches, and when her husband took over the party leadership in March 1965, she was listed as the institute's director. In December of the same year, she was elected a member of the newly established National Council of Scientific Research, and in September 1966, she was awarded the Order of Scientific Merit First Class.<ref name=rep45>René de Flers, "Biographical Sketches of the Ceausescu Clan." (RAD Background Report/135 (Romania); 27 July 1984) ''[[Radio Free Europe]]/Radio Liberty Background Reports'', p.4. [http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-6-20.shtml Open Society Archives of Central European University] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231073818/http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-6-20.shtml |date=31 December 2007 }}.</ref> In March 1974, she was made a member of the Romanian Academy's Section for Chemical Sciences. Ceaușescu was given many honorary awards for scientific achievement in the field of [[polymer]] [[chemistry]] during the period when her husband ruled [[Romania]]. She is named as co-inventor on a number of patents.<ref>{{cite web |title=Espacenet list of patents with inventor 'Ceaușescu Elena' |url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/searchResults?submitted=true&locale=en_EP&DB=EPODOC&ST=advanced&TI=&AB=&PN=&AP=&PR=&PD=&PA=&IN=%22Ceaușescu+Elena%22&CPC=&IC=}}</ref>

After the [[Revolutions of 1989]], several scientists have claimed that Ceaușescu had forced them to write papers in her name.<ref name=Revolution1989/><ref>https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22E.+Ceau%C8%99escu%22&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C44 Elena Ceaușescu on Google Scholar</ref> Claims also have arisen that the university gave her the honour of the doctorate solely because of her political position.

According to a 1984 report by [[Radio Free Europe]]: "It is rumored that, at the time when she wanted to receive her doctorate from the Bucharest Faculty of Chemistry, she met with strong opposition from the Romanian chemist [[Costin D. Nenitescu]], the dean of the faculty. She was forced instead to present her thesis to Cristofor Simionescu and Ioan Ursu at the University of Iasi, where she met with complete success."<ref>{{cite web|last=de Flers|first=Rene|title=RAD Background Report/135 (Romania) 27 July 1984 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF THE CEAUSESCU CLAN|url=http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-6-20.shtml|publisher=Radio Free Europe|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603045842/http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-6-20.shtml|archive-date=3 June 2009|pages=5|date=27 July 1984}}</ref>

In summary, to quote from an article on plagiarism in the leading scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'':
{{quote|...Elena Ceauşescu did not have a BSc, but the power of her husband Nicolae – Romania's dictator until communism fell – still made sure that the University of Bucharest awarded her a PhD in chemistry. The contents of her many scientific papers were penned by others.<ref name="nature2012">{{cite journal| title=Repeat after me | date=16 August 2012 | volume=488 | issue=7411 | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | page=253 | doi=10.1038/488253a| pmid=22895297 | bibcode=2012Natur.488Q.253. | doi-access=free }}</ref>|sign=|source=}}

She was sometimes nicknamed Codoi, referring to her alleged mispronunciation of the name of the chemical compound [[Carbon dioxide|CO{{sub|2}}]] (C for carbon, O for oxygen, and "{{wiktro|doi}}" being Romanian for "two"). She was mocked by many, including an official who called her by this nickname during her show trial.<ref>Trecutul de langa noi, [http://www.lumeam.ro/nr10_2003/trecutul_de_langa_noi2.html Lumea. nr. 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125085511/http://www.lumeam.ro/nr10_2003/trecutul_de_langa_noi2.html |date=25 November 2005 }}</ref><ref>Jela, Doina.
