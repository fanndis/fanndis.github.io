{{Main|History of Michigan State University}}
[[File:Flag of Michigan State University.gif|thumb|MSU's flag]]

=== Agricultural roots ===
The [[Michigan Constitution]] of 1850 called for the creation of an "agricultural school",<ref>{{cite book |url = https://en.wikisorce.org/wiki/Michigan_Constitution_of_1850 |title = Michigan Constitution of 1850 |via = Wikisource |at = Article 13, Section 11 |access-date = March 5, 2008 }}</ref> though it was not until February 12, 1855, that Michigan [[List of Governors of Michigan|Governor]] [[Kinsley S. Bingham]] signed a bill establishing the United States' first agricultural college, the '''Agricultural College of the State of Michigan'''.<ref name="sesquicentennial">{{cite web |url = http://www.msu.edu/unit/msuarhc/articlepg1.htm |title = Milestones of MSU's Sesquicentennial |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070806233601/http://www.msu.edu/unit/msuarhc/articlepg1.htm |archive-date = August 6, 2007 |publisher = MSU University Archives and Historical Collection |access-date = March 5, 2008 }}</ref> Classes began on May 13, 1857, with three buildings, five faculty members, and 63 male students.

The first president, [[Joseph R. Williams]], encouraged a curriculum that required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, [[liberal arts]], and practical training. The curriculum excluded [[Latin language|Latin]] and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any [[classical language]]s in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily [[manual labour|manual labor]], which kept costs down for both the students and the College.<ref>{{cite book |last = Darling |first = Birt |title = City in the Forest: The Story of Lansing |location = New York |publisher = Stratford House |year = 1950 |page = 121 |lccn = 50008202 }}</ref> Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as [[elitism|elitist]]. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.

=== Land-Grant pioneer ===
In 1860, Williams became acting [[lieutenant governor]]<ref name="josephrwilliams">{{cite web |url = http://www.msu.edu/unit/msuarhc/williams.htm |title = Joseph R. Williams Biographical Information |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060916212607/http://www.msu.edu/unit/msuarhc/williams.htm |archive-date = September 16, 2006  |publisher = MSU Archives and Historical Collection |access-date = March 5, 2008 }}</ref> and helped pass the Reorganization Act of 1861. This restored the college's four-year curriculum and gave the college the power to grant master's degrees. Under the act, a newly created body, known as the State Board of Agriculture, took over from the State Board of Education in running the institution.<ref name="sesquicentennial"/> The college changed its name to '''State Agricultural College''', and its first class graduated in the same year. As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] had begun, there was no time for an elaborate graduation ceremony.  The first alumni enlisted to the [[Union Army]]. Williams died, and the following year, [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the First [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 to support similar colleges, making the Michigan school a national model.  Shortly thereafter, on March 18, 1863, the state designated the college its land-grant institution making Michigan State University one of the nation's first land-grant colleges.<ref name=Nation>{{cite magazine |title = The National Schools of Science |magazine = cit|page = 409 |date = November 21, 1867 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mf0xAQAAIAAJ&q=land+grant+kansas+february+16%2C+1863+pennsylvania+April&pg=PA409 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160624102647/https://books.google.com/books?id=Mf0xAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA409&lpg=PA409&dq=land+grant+kansas+february+16,+1863+pennsylvania+April#v=onepage&q=land%20grant%20kansas%20february%2016%2C%201863%20pennsylvania%20April&f=false |archive-date = June 24, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

=== Co-ed college ===
[[Image:Land grant college stamp.jpg|thumb|254x254px|right|[[United States Postal Service|USPS]] commemorative [[postage stamp|stamp]] showing the first federal land-grant colleges]]
[[File:Michigan State college.jpg|thumb|376x376px]]
The college first admitted women in 1870, although at that time there were no female residence halls. The few women who enrolled boarded with faculty families or made the arduous [[stagecoach]] trek from Lansing. From the early days, female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a "Women Course" that melded a [[Family and consumer science|home economics]] curriculum with [[liberal arts]] and sciences. That same year, the College turned the Abbot Hall male dorm into a women's dormitory. It was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first African American student, William O. Thompson. After graduation, he taught at what is now [[Tuskegee University]]. President [[Jonathan L. Snyder]] invited its president [[Booker T. Washington]] to be the Class of 1900 commencement speaker. A few years later, Myrtle Craig became the first woman African American student to enroll at the College. Along with the Class of 1907, she received her degree from U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], commencement speaker for the Semi-Centennial celebration. The City of East Lansing was incorporated the same year,<ref>{{cite book |last = Miller |first = Whitney |title = East Lansing: Collegeville Revisited |series = Images of America |location = Charleston, South Carolina |publisher = Arcadia Publishing |year = 2002 |isbn = 0-7385-2045-4 |page = 26 }}</ref> and two years later the college changed its name to '''Michigan Agricultural College''' (M.A.C.).

=== Big Ten university ===
During the early 20th century, M.A.C. expanded its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925 it had expanded enough to change its name to '''Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science''' (M.S.C.). In 1941, the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, [[John A. Hannah]], became president of the College.

After World War II, he began the largest expansion in the institution's history, with the help of the 1945 [[G. I. Bill of Rights|G.I. Bill]], which helped World War II veterans gain college educations. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction of another dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.<ref>{{cite book |last = Heineman |first = Kenneth J. |title = Campus Wars: The Peace Movement at American State Universities in the Vietnam Era |location = New York |publisher = New York University Press |year = 1993 |isbn = 0-8147-3512-6 |page = 21 }}</ref>

In 1957, Hannah continued MSU's expansion by co-founding Michigan State University–Oakland, now [[Oakland University]], with [[Matilda Dodge Wilson]]. Hannah also got the chance to improve the athletic reputation of M.S.C. when the [[University of Chicago]] resigned from the [[Big Ten Conference]] in 1946. Hannah lobbied to take its place, gaining admission in 1949.<ref>{{cite news |title = It's Big 10 Now – Spartans Admitted |newspaper = Wisconsin State Journal |date = May 21, 1949 |page = 13 }}</ref>

Six years later, in its Centennial year of 1955, the State of Michigan renamed the College as '''Michigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science'''.<ref>{{cite book |last = Kuhn |first = Madison |title = Michigan State: The First Hundred Years, 1855–1955 |location = East Lansing |publisher = Michigan State University Press |year = 1955 |isbn = 0-87013-222-9 |page = 471 }}</ref> Nine years afterward, the University governing body changed its name from the State Board of Agriculture to the MSU Board of Trustees. The State of Michigan allowed the University to drop the words "Agriculture and Applied Science" from its name. Since 1964, the institution has been '''Michigan State University'''.

=== Oakland University ===
In 1957, the donation of {{convert|1500|acre|ha}} in Pontiac Township, Oakland County, Michigan prompted creation of Michigan State University – Oakland.  That campus became the independent school [[Oakland University]] in 1970.<ref name="Oakland">{{cite web |url = http://www.oakland.edu/?id=1611&sid=19 |title = Oakland's History |publisher = Oakland University |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120716202800/http://www.oakland.edu/?id=1611&sid=19 |archive-date = July 16, 2012 |access-date = July 24, 2012 }}</ref>

=== Global Leadership Initiative, 2012 and Beyond ===
Since the end of the Hannah era in 1969, Michigan State shifted its focus from increasing the size of its student body to advancing its national and global reputation. In September 2005, President [[Lou Anna Simon]] called for MSU to become the global model leader for Land-Grant institutions by 2012. Her plans included creating a new [[residential college]] and increased grants awarded from the [[National Institutes of Health]] past the US$100 million mark. While there are over 100 [[Land-grant universities]] in the United States, she stated she would like Michigan State University to be the leader.<ref>{{cite news |last = Darrow |first = Bob |url = http://www.statenews.com/index.php/article/2005/09/simon_msu_to_be_model |title = Simon: MSU to be model university |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192301/http://statenews.com/index.php/article/2005/09/simon_msu_to_be_model |archive-date = March 3, 2016  |work = The State News |date = September 9, 2005 |access-date = March 5, 2008 }}</ref>

Michigan State, the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Wayne State University]] created the [[University Research Corridor]] in 2006.<ref name="MSU-university-research-corridor">{{cite press release |title = MSU, U-M, Wayne State create University Research Corridor |publisher = Michigan State University |url = http://news.msu.edu/story/1317/ |access-date = July 1, 2011 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110901035650/http://news.msu.edu/story/1317/ |archive-date = September 1, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> This alliance was formed to transform and strengthen Michigan's economy by reaching out to businesses, policymakers, innovators, investors and the public to speed up technology transfer, make resources more accessible and attract new jobs to the state.<ref name="MSU-university-research-corridor"/>

As recently as the early 1990s, MSU was last among the eleven Big Ten schools (of the time), with barely over $100 million in endowment funds.

This changed dramatically in the 2000s (decade), when the University started a campaign to increase the size of the endowment. At the close of [[fiscal year]] 2004–2005, the endowment had risen to $1.325 billion, raising the University to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2 million of the fifth-rated school.<ref>Seguin, Rick.
