Some of the most popular social media websites, with over 100 million registered users, include [[Facebook]] (and its associated Facebook Messenger), [[TikTok]], [[WeChat]], [[Instagram]], [[Qzone|QZone]], [[Sina Weibo|Weibo]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Baidu Tieba]] and [[LinkedIn]]. Other popular platforms that are sometimes referred to as social media services (differing on interpretation) include [[YouTube]], [[Tencent QQ|QQ]], [[Quora]], [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]], [[WhatsApp]], [[Line (software)|LINE]], [[Snapchat]], [[Pinterest]], [[Viber]], [[Reddit]], [[Discord (software)|Discord]], [[VK (social networking)|VK]], [[Microsoft Teams]], and more.

Observers have noted a wide range of positive and negative impacts of social media use. Social media can help to improve an individual's sense of connectedness with real or [[online]] communities and can be an effective communication (or [[marketing]]) tool for corporations, entrepreneurs, non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, political parties, and governments.

The [[PLATO system]] launched in 1960, after being developed at the [[University of Illinois]] and subsequently commercially marketed by [[Control Data Corporation]]. It offered early forms of social media features with 1973-era innovations such as Notes, PLATO's message-forum application; TERM-talk, its instant-messaging feature; [[Talkomatic]], perhaps the first online chat room; News Report, a crowd-sourced online newspaper, and blog; and Access Lists, enabling the owner of a note file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users, for example, only friends, classmates, or co-workers.

[[ARPANET]], which first came online in 1967, had by the late 1970s developed a rich cultural exchange of non-government/business ideas and communication, as evidenced by the [[ARPANET#Rules and etiquette|network etiquette]] (or "netiquette") described in a 1982 handbook on computing at [[MIT]]'s [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]].<ref name=Stacy>{{cite web |last=Stacy |first=Christopher C. |date=September 7, 1982 |title=Getting Started Computing at the AI Lab |issue=Working Paper 235 |publisher=MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory |url=https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/41180/ai_wp_235.pdf?sequence=4 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323132534/https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/41180/AI_WP_235.pdf?sequence=4 |archive-date=2019-03-23 }}</ref> ARPANET evolved into the [[Internet]] following the publication of the first [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) specification, {{IETF RFC|675}} (''Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program''), written by [[Vint Cerf]], [[Yogen Dalal]] and Carl Sunshine in 1974.<ref>[[Vint Cerf|Cerf, Vinton]]; [[Yogen Dalal|Dalal, Yogen]]; Sunshine, Carl (December 1974), {{IETF RFC|675}}, ''Specification of Internet Transmission Control Protocol''</ref> This became the foundation of [[Usenet]], conceived by [[Tom Truscott]] and [[Jim Ellis (computing)|Jim Ellis]] in 1979 at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Duke University]], and established in 1980.

A precursor of the electronic [[bulletin board system]] (BBS), known as [[Community Memory]], had already appeared by 1973. True electronic bulletin board systems arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago, which first came online on February 16, 1978.  Before long, most major cities had more than one BBS running on [[TRS-80]], [[Apple II]], [[Atari Corporation|Atari]], [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]], and similar [[personal computer]]s. The IBM PC was introduced in 1981, and subsequent models of both Mac computers and PCs were used throughout the 1980s.  Multiple modems, followed by specialized telecommunication hardware, allowed many users to be online simultaneously. [[Compuserve]], [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] and [[AOL]] were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s.  Between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, BBSes numbered in the tens of thousands in North America alone.<ref>{{cite web

</ref> Message forums (a specific structure of social media) arose with the BBS phenomenon throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.  When the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW, or "the web") was added to the Internet in the mid-1990s, message forums migrated to the web, becoming [[Internet forum]]s, primarily due to cheaper per-person access as well as the ability to handle far more people simultaneously than telco modem banks.

==Definition and classification==

The variety of evolving stand-alone and built-in social media services makes it challenging to define them.<ref name="SMDefinition" /> However, marketing and social media experts broadly agree that social media include the following 13 types of social media:<ref name="IJMR Article"/> 
* [[blog]]s, 
* [[Professional network service|business networks]], 
* collaborative projects, 
* [[Enterprise social networking]], 
* [[Internet forum|forums]], 
* [[Microblogging|microblogs]], 
* [[photo sharing]], 
* [[Review site|products/services review]], 
* [[social bookmarking]], 
* [[social network game|social gaming]], 
* [[social network]]s, 
* [[Video hosting service|video sharing]], and 
* [[virtual world]]s.<ref name="IJMR Article"/>

The idea that social media are defined simply by their ability to bring people together has been seen as too broad, as this would suggest that fundamentally different technologies like the [[telegraph]] and [[telephone]] are also social media.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schejter |first1=A.M. |last2=Tirosh |first2=N. |title="Seek the meek, seek the just": Social media and social justice |journal=Telecommunications Policy |date=2015 |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=796–803 |doi=10.1016/j.telpol.2015.08.002}}</ref> The terminology is unclear, with some early researchers referring to social media as [[social network]]s or [[social networking service]]s in the mid 2000s.<ref name="boydEllison">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00393.x |title=Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=210–30 |year=2007 |last1=boyd |first1=danah m. |last2=Ellison |first2=Nicole B. |doi-access=free }}</ref> A more recent paper from 2015<ref name="SMDefinition" /> reviewed the prominent literature in the area and identified four common features unique to then-current social media services:

# [[User-generated content]] (UGC) is the lifeblood of the social media organism.<ref name="SMDefinition" /><ref name=Kaplan />
# Users create service-specific profiles for the site or app that are designed and maintained by the social media organization.<ref name="SMDefinition" /><ref name="boydEllison" /> 
# Social media facilitate the development of online [[social network]]s by connecting a user's profile with those of other individuals or groups.<ref name="SMDefinition" /><ref name="boydEllison" />

===Mobile social media===
[[File:Young people texting on smartphones using thumbs.JPG|thumb|The heavy usage of smartphones among young people relates to the significant percentage of social media users who are from this demographic.]]
''Mobile social media'' refer to the use of social media on mobile devices such as [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s. Mobile social media are a useful application of [[mobile marketing]] because the creation, exchange, and circulation of user-generated content can assist companies with marketing research, communication, and relationship development.<ref name='mobileKaplan'>{{cite journal |last=Kaplan |first=Andreas M. |title=If you love something, let it go mobile: Mobile marketing and mobile social media 4x4 |journal=Business Horizons |date=March–April 2012 |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=129–139 |doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2011.10.009}}</ref> Mobile social media differ from others because they incorporate the current location of the user (location-sensitivity) or the time delay between sending and receiving messages (time-sensitivity). According to [[Andreas Kaplan]], mobile social media applications can be differentiated among four types:<ref name='mobileKaplan' />

# ''Space-timers'' (location and time-sensitive): Exchange of messages with relevance mostly for one specific location at one specific point in time (e.g. [[Facebook Places]] [[WhatsApp]]; [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]])
# ''Space-locators'' (only location sensitive): Exchange of messages, with relevance for one specific location, which is tagged to a certain place and read later by others (e.g. [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]]; [[Qype]], [[Tumblr]], [[Fishbrain]])
# ''Quick-timers'' (only time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media [[mobile apps]] to increase immediacy (e.g. posting [[Twitter]] messages or [[Facebook]] status updates)
# ''Slow-timers'' (neither location nor time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media applications to [[mobile devices]] (e.g. watching a [[YouTube]] video or reading/editing a [[Wikipedia]] article)

==Elements and function==

===Viral content===
Some social media sites have the potential for content posted there to spread ''[[Viral phenomenon|virally]]'' over social networks. The term is an analogy to the concept of [[viral infections]], which can spread rapidly from person to person. In a social media context, content or websites that are "viral" (or which "go viral") are those with a greater likelihood that users will reshare content posted (by another user) to their social network, leading to further sharing. In some cases, posts containing popular content or fast-breaking news have been rapidly shared and reshared by a huge number of users. Many social media sites provide specific functionality to help users reshare content, such as [[Twitter]]'s retweet button, [[Pinterest]]'s pin function, [[Facebook]]'s share option, or [[Tumblr]]'s reblog function. [[Business]]es have a particular interest in [[viral marketing]] tactics because a viral campaign can achieve widespread advertising coverage (particularly if the viral reposting itself makes the news) for a fraction of the cost of a traditional marketing campaign, which typically uses printed materials, like newspapers, [[magazine]]s, mailings, and billboards, and television and radio commercials. [[Nonprofit organization]]s and [[activist]]s may have similar interests in posting content on social media sites with the aim of it going viral. A popular component and feature of Twitter is retweeting. Twitter allows other people to keep up with important events, stay connected with their peers, and can contribute in various ways throughout social media.<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint=1106.0346 |title=Entropy-based Classification of 'Retweeting' Activity on Twitter |last=Ghosh |first=Rumi |date=June 2011 |class=cs.SI}}</ref> When certain posts become popular, they start to get [[retweet]]ed over and over again, becoming viral. Hashtags can be used in tweets, and can also be used to take count of how many people have used that hashtag.

There has been rapid growth in the number of U.S. patent applications that cover new technologies related to social media, and the number of them that are published has been growing rapidly over the past five years. There are now over 2000 published patent applications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&r=0&p=1&f=S&l=50&Query=spec%2F%22social+media%22&d=PG01 |title=USPTO search on published patent applications mentioning "social media" |publisher=Appft.uspto.gov |access-date=2012-04-24}}</ref> As many as 7000 applications may be currently on file including those that haven't been published yet.

===Usage===
According to a survey conducted by Pew Research in 2018, Facebook and YouTube dominated the social media landscape, as notable majorities of U.S. adults used each of these sites. At the same time, younger Americans (especially those ages 18 to 24) stood out for embracing a variety of platforms and using them frequently. Some 78% of 18-24-year-old youngsters used Snapchat, and a sizeable majority of these users (71%) visited the platform multiple times per day. Similarly, 71% of Americans in this age group used Instagram and close to half (45%) were Twitter users. However, Facebook remained the primary platform for most American adults. Roughly two-thirds of U.S. adults (68%) reported that they were Facebook users, and roughly three-quarters of those users accessed Facebook on a daily basis. With the exception of those 65 and older, a majority of Americans across a wide range of demographic groups used Facebook.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/03/01/social-media-use-in-2018/ |title=Social Media Use 2018: Demographics and Statistics &#124; Pew Research Center |access-date=2018-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024183540/http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/03/01/social-media-use-in-2018/ |archive-date=2018-10-24 |url-status=dead |date=March 2018 }}</ref> However, after Facebook's rapid growth in the United States over the years, the number of new U.S. Facebook accounts created has plateaued, with not much observable growth in the 2016-18 period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2018/3/1/17063208/facebook-us-growth-pew-research-users|title=Facebook is not getting any bigger in the United States|last=Wagner|first=Kurt|date=March 1, 2018|website=Recode|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref>

A study from 2009 suggests that there may be individual differences that help explain who uses social media and who does not: Extraversion and openness have a positive relationship with social media, while emotional stability has a negative sloping relationship with social media.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Correa|first1=Teresa|last2=Hinsley|first2=Amber W.|date=October 2009|title=Who Interacts on the Web?: The Intersection of Users' Personality and Social Media Use|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563209001472|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=26|issue=2|pages=247–253|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2009.09.003}}</ref> A different study from 2015 found that people with a higher social comparison orientation appear to use social media more heavily than people with low social comparison orientation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vogel|first1=Erin A.|last2=Rose|first2=Jason P.|last3=Okdie|first3=Bradley M.|last4=Eckles|first4=Katheryn|last5=Franz|first5=Brittany|year=2015|title=Who compares and despairs?

There is data to suggest from Common Sense Media that children under the age of 13 in the United States use [[social networking service]]s.

However, the median age of starting to use social media was 14-years-old.

In June 2020 during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]], a nationally representative survey by Cartoon Network and the Cyberbullying Research Center surveyed Americans ages 9-12 found that the most popular social media site/app was YouTube (used by 67% of 9- to 12-year-old Americans in the past year).<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|last1=Patchin|first1=Justin W.|last2=Hinduja|first2=Sameer|date=2020|title=Tween cyberbullying in 2020|url=https://www.cartoonnetwork.com/stop-bullying/resources.html|website=Cartoon Network}}</ref>

Companies are increasingly{{quantify|date=April 2019}} using [[social media monitoring|social-media monitoring]] tools to monitor, track, and analyze online conversations on the Web about their brand or products or about related topics of interest. This can prove useful in [[public-relations|public relations]] management and [[advertising campaign|advertising-campaign]] tracking, allowing analysts to measure [[return on investment]] for their social media ad spending, competitor-auditing, and for [[public engagement]]. Tools range from free, basic applications to subscription-based, more in-depth tools.

Financial industries utilize the power of social media as a tool for analyzing the sentiment of financial markets.

===Use in hiring===
{{Main|Social media use in hiring}}Some employers examine job applicants' social media profiles as part of the hiring assessment. This issue raises many ethical questions that some consider an employer's right and others consider [[discrimination]]. Many Western European countries have already implemented laws that restrict the regulation of social media in the workplace. States including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin have passed legislation that protects potential employees and current employees from employers that demand that they provide their usernames and/or passwords for any social media accounts.<ref name="Marche2012">{{cite web |author=Marche, S. |year=2012 |title=Is Facebook Making Us Lonely? |publisher=The Atlantic |access-date=2013-07-12 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/is-facebook-making-us-lonely/308930/}}</ref> Use of social media by young people has caused significant problems for some applicants who are active on social media when they try to enter the job market. A survey of 17,000 young people in six countries in 2013 found that 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of online comments they made on social media websites.<ref>{{cite web |first=Elaine |last=Burke for Silicon Republic |date=May 30, 2013 |url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/item/32880-1-in-10-young-people-losing |title=1 in 10 young people losing out on jobs because of pics and comments on social media}}</ref>

{{main|Social media marketing}}
Social media marketing is the use of social media platforms and websites to promote a product or service and also to establish a connection with its customers. Although the terms e-marketing and digital marketing are still dominant in academia, social media marketing is becoming more popular for both practitioners and researchers. Social media marketing has increased due to the growing active user rates on social media sites. For example, [[Facebook]] currently has 2.2 billion users, [[Twitter]] has 330 million active users and [[Instagram]] has 800 million users.<ref>{{cite web|title=Most famous social network sites worldwide as of January 2018, ranked by number of active users (in millions)|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/|website=Statista|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref> One of the main uses is to interact with audiences to create awareness of their brand or service, with the main idea of creating a two-way communication system where the audience and/or customers can interact back; providing feedback as just one example.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chaffey|first1=Dave|last2=Ellis-Chadwick|first2=Fiona|title=Digital Marketing|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-273-74610-2|pages=30–31|edition=5th}}</ref> Social media can be used to advertise; placing an advert on Facebook's Newsfeed, for example, can allow a vast number of people to see it or targeting specific audiences from their usage to encourage awareness of the product or brand.

In many ways, mainstream [[journalist]]s have maintained an authoritative voice as the storytellers of the American past. Their documentary style narratives, detailed exposes, and their positions in the present make them prime sources for public memory. Specifically, news media journalists have shaped collective memory on nearly every major national event – from the deaths of social and political figures to the progression of political hopefuls. Journalists provide elaborate descriptions of commemorative events in U.S. history and contemporary popular cultural sensations. Many Americans learn the significance of historical events and political issues through news media, as they are presented on popular news stations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pajala |first1=Mary |year=2012 |title=Television as an Archive of Memory? |journal=Critical Studies in Television |volume=5 |issue=2|pages=133–145 |doi=10.7227/cst.5.2.16|s2cid=156717273 }}</ref> However, journalistic influence is growing less important, whereas social networking sites such as [[Facebook]], YouTube and [[Twitter]], provide a constant supply of alternative news sources for users.

As [[social networking]] becomes more popular among older and younger generations, sites such as Facebook and YouTube, gradually undermine the traditionally authoritative voices of news media. For example, American citizens contest media coverage of various social and political events as they see fit, inserting their voices into the narratives about America's past and present and shaping their own collective memories.<ref>Motti Neiger, Oren Meyers, and Eyal Zandberg. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7mKJDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22social%20media%22&f=false On Media Memory: Collective Memory in a New Media Age]. New York : Palgrave MacMillan, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Barnhurst |first1=Kevin |last2=Wartella |first2=Ellen |year=1998 |title=Young Citizens, American TV Newscasts and the Collective Memory |journal=Critical Studies in Mass Media |volume=15 |issue=3|pages=279–305 |doi=10.1080/15295039809367049}}</ref> An example of this is the public explosion of the [[Trayvon Martin]] shooting in Sanford, Florida. News media coverage of the incident was minimal until social media users made the story recognizable through their constant discussion of the case. Approximately one month after the fatal shooting of [[Trayvon Martin]], its online coverage by everyday Americans garnered national attention from mainstream media journalists, in turn exemplifying [[media activism]]. In some ways, the spread of this tragic event through alternative news sources parallels that of [[Emmett Till]] – whose murder by lynching in 1955 became a national story after it was circulated in African-American and Communist newspapers.

[[Sherry Turkle]] explores this topic in her book ''Alone Together'' as she discusses how people confuse social media usage with authentic communication.<ref name="Turkle2012" /> She posits that people tend to act differently online and are less afraid to hurt each other's feelings. Additionally, Some online behaviors can cause stress and anxiety, due to the permanence of online posts, the fear of being hacked, or of universities and employers exploring social media pages. Turkle also speculates that people are beginning to prefer texting to face-to-face communication, which can contribute to feelings of loneliness.<ref name="Turkle2012">{{cite book |author=Turkle, S. |year=2012 |title=Alone together: Why we expect more from technology and less from each other |location=New York, NY |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-03146-7}}</ref> Nationally representative surveys from 2019 have found this to be the case with teens in the United States<ref name=":9" /> and Mexico.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Robb|first1=Michael B.|last2=Bay|first2=Willow|last3=Vennegaard|first3=Tina|date=2019|title=The New Normal: Parents, Teens, and Mobile Devices in Mexico|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/the-new-normal-parents-teens-and-devices-around-the-world|website=Common Sense Media}}</ref> Some researchers have also found that exchanges that involved direct communication and reciprocation of messages correlated with fewer feelings of loneliness.<ref name="Burke2011">{{Cite book |last1=Burke |first1=Moira |last2=Kraut |first2=Robert |last3=Marlow |first3=Cameron |s2cid=8060040 |year=2011 |title=Social capital on Facebook: Differentiating uses and users |journal=Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems |volume=7–9 |pages=571–580 |doi=10.1145/1978942.1979023 |isbn=978-1-4503-0228-9 |url=http://www.cameronmarlow.com/media/burke-2011-social.pdf |access-date=2016-03-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129071100/http://www.cameronmarlow.com/media/burke-2011-social.pdf |archive-date=2015-11-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, that same study showed that passively using social media without sending or receiving messages does not make people feel less lonely unless they were lonely to begin with.

The term social media "stalking" or "creeping" have been popularized over the years, and this refers to looking at the person's "timeline, status updates, tweets, and online bios" to find information about them and their activities.<ref name="Walker">{{cite web |url= https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-creeping-mean-2655280|title=The Ins and Outs of Facebook Creeping|last=Walker |first=Leslie |date=October 23, 2016 |website=www.lifewire.com |publisher=Lifewire |access-date=2018-11-12 }}</ref> While social media creeping is common, it is considered to be poor form to admit to a new acquaintance or new date that you have looked through his or her social media posts, particularly older posts, as this will indicate that you were going through their old history.<ref name="Walker" /> A sub-category of creeping is creeping ex-partners' social media posts after a breakup to investigate if there is a new partner or new dating; this can lead to preoccupation with the ex, rumination, and negative feelings, all of which postpone recovery and increase feelings of loss.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/better-living-technology/201402/why-exes-arent-so-ex-anymore |title=Why Exes Aren't So "Ex" Anymore |last=Fox |first=Jesse |date=February 26, 2014 |website=www.psychologytoday.com |publisher=Psychology Today |access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>

[[Catfishing]] has become more prevalent since the advent of social media. Relationships formed with catfish can lead to actions such as supporting them with money and catfish will typically make excuses as to why they cannot meet up or be viewed on camera.<ref>{{cite book|title=Choices & Connections|last1=McCormack|first1=Steven|last2=Ortiz|first2=Joseph|date=2017|edition=second}}</ref>

However, users may feel pressure to gain their peers' acceptance of their self-presentation. For example, in a 2016 peer-reviewed article by Trudy Hui Hui Chua and Leanne Chang, the authors found that teenage girls manipulate their self-presentation on social media to achieve a sense of beauty that is projected by their peers.<ref name="Chua 190–197">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2015.09.011 |title=Follow me and like my beautiful selfies: Singapore teenage girls' engagement in self-presentation and peer comparison on social media |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |volume=55 |pages=190–7 |year=2016 |last1=Chua |first1=Trudy Hui Hui |last2=Chang |first2=Leanne }}</ref> These authors also discovered that teenage girls compare themselves to their peers on social media and present themselves in certain ways in an effort to earn regard and acceptance. However, when users do not feel like they reached this regard and acceptance, this can actually lead to problems with self-confidence and self-satisfaction.<ref name="Chua 190–197" /> A nationally representative survey of American teens ages 13-17 by Common Sense Media found that 45% said getting “likes” on posts is at least somewhat important, and 26% at least somewhat agreed that they feel bad about themselves is nobody comments on or “likes” their photos.<ref name=":9" /> Some evidence suggests that perceived rejection may lead to feeling emotional pain,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Gina Masullo|year=2015|title=Losing Face on Social Media|journal=Communication Research|volume=42|issue=6|pages=819–38|doi=10.1177/0093650213510937|s2cid=28015890}}</ref> and some may partake in online retaliation such as online bullying.<ref>Kowalski, Robin M, Sue Limber, and Patricia W Agatston.

Literature suggests that social media can breed a negative feedback loop of viewing and uploading photos, self-comparison, feelings of disappointment when perceived social success is not achieved, and disordered body perception.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Holland, G.|author2=Tiggerman, M.|date=2016|title=A systematic review of the impact of the use of social networking sites on body image and disordered eating outcomes|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298794212|journal=Body Image|volume=17|pages=101–109|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2016.02.008|pmid=26995158}}</ref> In fact, one study shows that the microblogging platform, Pinterest is directly associated with disordered dieting behavior, indicating that for those who frequently look at exercise or dieting "pins" there is a greater chance that they will engage in extreme weight-loss and dieting behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lewallen|first1=Jennifer|last2=Behm-Morawitz|first2=Elizabeth|date=March 30, 2016|title=Pinterest or Thinterest?: Social Comparison and Body Image on Social Media|journal=Social Media + Society|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|page=205630511664055|doi=10.1177/2056305116640559|doi-access=free}}</ref> 

===As a health behavior change and reinforcement tool===
Social media can also function as a supportive system for adolescents' health, because by using social media, adolescents are able to mobilize around health issues that they themselves deem relevant.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Patton |first1=George C. |last2=Sawyer |first2=Susan M. |last3=Santelli |first3=John S. |last4=Ross |first4=David A. |last5=Afifi |first5=Rima |last6=Allen |first6=Nicholas B. |last7=Arora |first7=Monika |last8=Azzopardi |first8=Peter |last9=Baldwin |first9=Wendy |date=June 2016 |title=Our future: a Lancet commission on adolescent health and wellbeing |journal=The Lancet |volume=387 |issue=10036 |pages=2423–2478 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(16)00579-1 |issn=0140-6736 |pmc=5832967 |pmid=27174304}}</ref> For example, in a clinical study among adolescent patients undergoing treatment for [[obesity]], the participants' expressed that through social media, they could find personalized [[weight-loss]] content as well as social support among other adolescents with obesity<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/1460458218759699|pmid = 29499615|title = Health literacy in a complex digital media landscape: Pediatric obesity patients' experiences with online weight, food, and health information|journal = Health Informatics Journal|volume = 25|issue = 4|pages = 1343–1357|year = 2018|last1 = Holmberg|first1 = Christopher|last2 = Berg|first2 = Christina|last3 = Dahlgren|first3 = Jovanna|last4 = Lissner|first4 = Lauren|last5 = Chaplin|first5 = John Eric|s2cid = 3687773}}</ref> The same authors also found that as with other types of online information, the adolescents need to possess necessary skills to evaluate and identify reliable health information, competencies commonly known as [[health literacy]].

=== Negative interpersonal interactions and effects ===
{{Further|Cyberbullying}}
Social media use sometimes involves negative interactions between users.<ref>[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3517813 The Joys & Ills of Social Media: A Review.] ''Information Systems: Behavioral & Social Methods eJournal.'' SSSRN. Accessed 12 February 2020.</ref> Angry or emotional conversations can lead to real-world interactions outside of the Internet, which can get users into dangerous situations. Some users have experienced threats of violence online and have feared these threats manifesting themselves offline. Related issues include [[cyberbullying]], online [[harassment]], and "[[Internet troll|trolling]]". According to cyberbullying statistics from the i-Safe Foundation, over half of adolescents and teens have been bullied online, and about the same number have engaged in cyberbullying.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/cyber-bullying-statistics.html | title=Cyber Bullying Statistics| date=July 7, 2015}}</ref> Both the bully and the victim are negatively affected, and the intensity, duration, and frequency of bullying are the three aspects that increase the negative effects on both of them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peebles|first=E|date=2014|title=Cyberbullying: Hiding behind the screen.|journal=Paediatrics & Child Health|volume=19|issue=10|pages=527–528|doi=10.1093/pch/19.10.527|pmid=25587229|pmc=4276384}}</ref> 

=== Social comparison and effects ===
One phenomenon that is commonly studied with social media is the issue of [[Social comparison theory|social comparison]]. People compare their own lives to the lives of their friends through their friends' posts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Because people are motivated to portray themselves in a way that is appropriate to the situation and serves their best interests,<ref name="Chua 190–197" /> often the things posted online are the positive aspects of people's lives, making other people question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling. One study in 2017 found that problematic social media use (i.e., feeling addicted to social media) was related to lower life satisfaction and self-esteem scores; the authors speculate that users may feel if their life is not exciting enough to put online it is not as good as their friends or family.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hawi | first1 = N.S. | last2 = Samaha | first2 = M. | s2cid = 64367207 | year = 2017 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306048463 |title=The Relations Among Social Media Addiction, Self-Esteem, and Life Satisfaction in University Students]| journal = Social Science Computer Review | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 576–586 | doi = 10.1177/0894439316660340 }}</ref>

Studies have shown that self-comparison on social media can have dire effects on physical and mental health because they give us the ability to seek approval and compare ourselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Stefanone, M.A. |author2=Lackaff, D. |author3=Rosen, D. |date=2011 |title=Contingencies of Self-Worth and Social-Networking-Site Behavior |url=http://www.buffalo.edu/content/dam/cas/communication/files/Stefanone/Stefanone_cyberpsych.2011.pdf |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=14 |issue=1–2 |pages=41–9 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2010.0049 |pmid=21329442 |hdl=2152/41152 }}</ref> In one study, women reported that social media are the most influential sources of their body image satisfaction; while men reported them as the second most impacting factor.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blackford |first1=Meghan |title=#bodypositive: A Look at Body Image & Social Media |url=https://fherehab.com/news/bodypositive/ |website=FHE Health |access-date=5 October 2020}}</ref>

=== Sleep disturbance ===
According to a study released in 2017 by researchers from the [[University of Pittsburgh]], the link between sleep disturbance and the use of social media was clear. It concluded that blue light had a part to play—and how often they logged on, rather than time spent on social media sites, was a higher predictor of disturbed sleep, suggesting "an obsessive 'checking'".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180104-is-social-media-bad-for-you-the-evidence-and-the-unknowns|title=Is social media bad for you?

In a recent study, we have learned that people in the highest quartile for social media use per week report the most sleep disturbance.

===Emotional effects===
One studied emotional effect is "Facebook depression", which is a type of depression that affects adolescents who spend too much of their free time engaging with social media sites.<ref name=":16" /> This may lead to problems such as reclusiveness which can negatively damage one's health by creating feelings of loneliness and low self-esteem among young people.<ref name=":16">O’Keefe Schurgen, Gwenn.

A second emotional effect is social media burnout, which is defined by Bo Han as ambivalence, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Han|first1=Bo|year=2018|title=Social Media Burnout: Definition, Measurement Instrument, and Why We Care|journal=Journal of Computer Information Systems|volume=58|issue=2|pages=1–9|doi=10.1080/08874417.2016.1208064|s2cid=67791822}}</ref> Ambivalence refers to a user's confusion about the benefits she can get from using a social media site. Emotional exhaustion refers to the stress a user has when using a social media site. Depersonalization refers to the emotional detachment from a social media site a user experiences. The three burnout factors can all negatively influence the user's social media continuance. This study provides an instrument to measure the burnout a user can experience when his or her social media "friends" are generating an overwhelming amount of useless information (e.g., "what I had for dinner", "where I am now").

A third emotional effect is the "[[fear of missing out]]" (FOMO), which is defined as the "pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent".<ref name="Przybylski, Andrew K. 2013">{{cite journal|last1=Przybylski|first1=Andrew K.|last2=Murayama|first2=Kou|last3=DeHaan|first3=Cody R.|last4=Gladwell|first4=Valerie|year=2013|title=Motivational, emotional, and behavioral correlates of fear of missing out|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=29|issue=4|pages=1841–1848|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.02.014}}</ref> FOMO has been classified by some as a form of social [[anxiety]].<ref name="JWT2012">{{Cite web|date=March 2012|title=Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)|url=http://www.jwtintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/F_JWT_FOMO-update_3.21.12.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626125816/http://www.jwtintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/F_JWT_FOMO-update_3.21.12.pdf|archive-date=2015-06-26|website=[[J.

He also voices concern over the trend that finds social utilities operating in a quasi-[[Libertarianism|libertarian]] global environment of oligopoly that requires users in economically challenged nations to spend high percentages of annual income to pay for devices and services to participate in the social media lifestyle. [[Neil Postman]] also contends that social media will increase an information disparity between "winners" – who are able to use the social media actively – and "losers" – who are not familiar with modern technologies or who do not have access to them. People with high social media skills may have better access to information about job opportunities, potential new friends, and social activities in their area, which may enable them to improve their standard of living and their [[quality of life]].

===Political polarization===
According to the Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans at least occasionally receive news from social media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.journalism.org/2018/09/10/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2018/|title=News Use Across Social Media Platforms 2018 |work=Pew Research Center|date=September 10, 2018|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref> Because of [[algorithm]]s on social media which filter and display news content which are likely to match their users’ political preferences, a potential impact of receiving news from social media includes an increase in [[Polarization (politics)|political polarization]] due to [[Selective exposure theory|selective exposure.]]<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Hayat|first1=Tsahi|last2=Samuel-Azran|first2=Tal|s2cid=148973729|date=April 3, 2017|title="You too, Second Screeners?"

Selective exposure occurs when an individual favors information that supports their beliefs and avoids information that conflicts with their beliefs. A study by Hayat and Samuel-Azran conducted during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 U.S. presidential election]] observed an "[[Echo chamber (media)|echo chamber]]" effect of selective exposure among 27,811 Twitter users following the content of cable news shows.<ref name=":0" /> The Twitter users observed in the study were found to have little interaction with users and content whose beliefs were different from their own, possibly heightening polarization effects.<ref name=":0" /><ref>[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3546890 A Critical Appraisal of the Twitterverse.] ''Information Systems: Behavioral & Social Methods eJournal.''

===Stereotyping===
Recent research has demonstrated that social media, and media in general, have the power to increase the scope of stereotypes not only in children but people of all ages.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Díaz-Fernández|first1=Antonio M.|last2=del-Real-Castrillo|first2=Cristina|date=July 1, 2018|title=Spies and security: Assessing the impact of animated videos on intelligence services in school children|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=26|issue=56|pages=81–89|doi=10.3916/c56-2018-08|issn=1134-3478|doi-access=free}}</ref> Three researchers at Blanquerna University, Spain, examined how adolescents interact with social media and specifically Facebook. They suggest that interactions on the website encourage representing oneself in the traditional gender constructs, which helps maintain gender stereotypes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Basow |first1=susan A. |title=Gender : stereotypes and roles . |date=1992 |publisher=Thomson Brooks/ Cole Publishing Co. |location=Belmont CA. U.S |page=447 |edition=3rd |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-97754-000}}</ref> The authors noted that girls generally show more emotion in their posts and more frequently change their profile pictures, which according to some psychologists can lead to self-objectification.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oberst |first1=Ursala |last2=Chamarro |first2=Andres |last3=Renau |first3=Vanessa |title=Gender Stereotypes 2.0: Self-Representations of Adolescents on Facebook |journal= Comunicar|volume=24 |issue=48 |pages=81–89 |doi=10.3916/c48-2016-08|year=2016 |doi-access=free }}</ref> On the other hand, the researchers found that boys prefer to portray themselves as strong, independent, and powerful.<ref>{{cite journal |last2=Peter |first2=J |title=Women on Display: The Effect of Portraying the Self Online on Women's Self-objectification |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=1,483–1489 |last1=De Vies |first1=D|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.01.015 |year=2013}}</ref> For example, men often post pictures of objects and not themselves, and rarely change their profile pictures; using the pages more for entertainment and pragmatic reasons. In contrast, girls generally post more images that include themselves, friends and things they have emotional ties to, which the researchers attributed that to the higher emotional intelligence of girls at a younger age. The authors sampled over 632 girls and boys from the ages of 12–16 from Spain in an effort to confirm their beliefs. The researchers concluded that masculinity is more commonly associated with positive psychological well-being, while femininity displays less psychological well-being.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Facebook Involvement, Objectified Body Consciousness, Body Shame, and Sexual Assertiveness in College Women and Men |journal=Sex Roles |volume=72 |issue=1–2 |doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0441-1 |year=2014 |pages=1–14 | last1 = Manago | first1 = Adriana M. | last2 = Ward | first2 = L.

Users of Facebook generally use their profiles to reflect that they are a "normal" person. Social media was found to uphold gender stereotypes both feminine and masculine. The researchers also noted that traditional stereotypes are often upheld by boys more so than girls. The authors described how neither stereotype was entirely positive, but most people viewed masculine values as more positive.

===Effects on youth communication===
Social media has allowed for mass cultural exchange and intercultural communication. As different cultures have different [[Value (ethics)|value systems]], cultural themes, grammar, and world views, they also communicate differently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/ampu/crosscult.html|title=AMPU Guide: Common Cross-cultural Communication Challenges|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> The emergence of social media platforms fused together different cultures and their communication methods, blending together various cultural thinking patterns and expression styles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311535510|title=The Impact of Social Media on Intercultural Communication|last=Prakapienė|first=Dalia|website=Research Gate|access-date=3 December 2019}}</ref>{{Better source|date=December 2019}}

Social media has affected the way youth communicate, by introducing new forms of language. Abbreviations have been introduced to cut down on the time it takes to respond online. The commonly known "[[LOL]]" has become globally recognized as the abbreviation for "laugh out loud" thanks to social media.

Another trend that influences the way youth communicates is (through) the use of hashtags. With the introduction of social media platforms such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]], the hashtag was created to easily organize and search for information. Hashtags can be used when people want to advocate for a movement, store content or tweets from a movement for future use, and allow other social media users to contribute to a discussion about a certain movement by using existing hashtags. Using hashtags as a way to advocate for something online makes it easier and more accessible for more people to acknowledge it around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Saxton|first1=Gregory D.|last2=Niyirora|first2=Jerome N.|last3=Guo|first3=Chao|last4=Waters|first4=Richard D.|date=Spring 2015|title=#AdvocatingForChange: The Strategic Use of Hashtags in Social Media Advocacy|journal=Advances in Social Work|volume=16|pages=154–169|doi=10.18060/17952|doi-access=free}}</ref> As hashtags such as #tbt ("[[throwback Thursday]]") become a part of online communication, it influenced the way in which youth share and communicate in their daily lives. Because of these changes in linguistics and communication etiquette, researchers of media semiotics{{who|date=November 2018}} have found that this has altered youth's communications habits and more.{{vague|date=November 2018}}{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Social media has offered a new platform for [[peer pressure]] with both positive and negative communication. From Facebook comments to likes on Instagram, how the youth communicate, and what is socially acceptable is now heavily based on social media.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Anderson |first1=Monica |last2=Jiang |first2=Jingjing |title=1.

Their actions focused on gaining massive numbers of followers, include use of advanced scripts and manipulation techniques that distort the prime idea of social media by abusing human trustfulness.<ref>{{cite web |last=Trimarchi |first=Maria |title=5 Myths About Twitter |url=https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/tech-myths/5-myths-about-twitter.htm |publisher=Howstuffworks |access-date=2017-10-22|date=July 24, 2009 }}</ref>  British-American entrepreneur and author [[Andrew Keen]] criticizes social media in his book ''[[The Cult of the Amateur]]'', writing, "Out of this anarchy, it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the Internet was the law of digital Darwinism, the survival of the loudest and most opinionated. Under these rules, the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Keen |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Keen |title=The Cult of the Amateur |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-385-52081-2 |page=15|year=2007 }}</ref>
This is also relative to the issue "justice" in the social network. For example, the phenomenon "[[Human flesh search engine]]" in Asia raised the discussion of "private-law" brought by social network platform. Comparative media professor [[José van Dijck]] contends in her book ''[[The Culture of Connectivity]]'' (2013) that to understand the full weight of social media, their technological dimensions should be connected to the social and the cultural. She critically describes six social media platforms. One of her findings is the way Facebook had been successful in framing the term 'sharing' in such a way that third party use of user data is neglected in favor of intra-user connectedness.

[[Essena O'Neill]] attracted international coverage when she explicitly left social media.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jo Sales|first1=Nancy|title=American Girls: Social Media and the Secret Lives of Teenagers|date=Feb 23, 2016|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-35392-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/americangirlssoc0000sale}}</ref>

===Trustworthiness and reliability===
There has been speculation{{by whom|date=May 2019}} that social media has become perceived as a trustworthy source of information by a large number of people.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Westerman|first1=David|last2=Spence|first2=Patric R.|last3=Van Der Heide|first3=Brandon|date=2014-01-01|title=Social Media as Information Source: Recency of Updates and Credibility of Information|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/19/2/171/4067516|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=171–183|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12041|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263768278_Undergraduates'_Use_of_Social_Media_as_Information_Sources]</ref> The continuous interpersonal connectivity on social media, for example, may lead to people regarding peer recommendations as indicators of the reliability of information sources.

The trustworthiness of information can be improved by [[fact-checking]]. Some social media has started to employ this.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-partnership-reuters/facebook-starts-fact-checking-partnership-with-reuters-idUSKBN2062K4 Facebook starts fact-checking partnership with Reuters]</ref><ref>[https://www.wired.com/story/trump-speech-twitter-fact-check/ After Trump's Speech, Twitter Fact-Checks the Fact-Checkers]</ref><ref>[https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9229632?hl=en See fact checks in YouTube search results]</ref>

[[Evgeny Morozov]], a 2009–2010 [[Yahoo]] fellow at [[Georgetown University]], contended that information uploaded to Twitter may have little relevance to the masses of people who do not use Twitter. In an article for the magazine ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]'' titled "Iran: Downside to the 'Twitter Revolution'", Morozov wrote:
{{blockquote |[B]y its very design Twitter only adds to the noise: it's simply impossible to pack much context into its 140 characters. All other biases are present as well: in a country like Iran it's mostly pro-Western, technology-friendly and iPod-carrying young people who are the natural and most frequent users of Twitter. They are a tiny and, most important, extremely untypical segment of the Iranian population (the number of Twitter users in Iran — a country of more than seventy million people — was estimated at less than twenty thousand before the protests).<ref name=Morozov>{{cite journal |last1=Morozov |first=Evgeny |s2cid=143473583 |title=Iran: Downside to the 'Twitter Revolution' |journal=[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]] |date=Fall 2009 |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=10–14 |doi=10.1353/dss.0.0092 |url=https://www.evgenymorozov.com/morozov_twitter_dissent.pdf }}</ref>}}

In contrast, in the United States (where Twitter originated), the social network had 306 million accounts {{as of|2012|lc=y}}.<ref>''Media Bistro'' (2012).</ref>

Professor [[Matthew Auer]] of [[Bates College]] casts doubt on the conventional wisdom that social media are open and participatory. He also speculates on the emergence of "anti-social media" used as "instruments of pure control".<ref name=Auer2001>{{cite journal |last=Auer |first=Matthew R. |s2cid=153590593 |year=2011 |title=The Policy Sciences of Social Media |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=709–736 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00428.x |ssrn=1974080 }}</ref>

====Criticism of data harvesting and data mining====
{{Further|Social media mining}}
Social media "mining" is a type of [[data mining]], a technique of [[data analysis|analyzing data]] to detect patterns. Social media mining is a process of representing, analyzing, and extracting actionable patterns from data collected from people's activities on social media. Google mines data in many ways including using an [[algorithm]] in [[Gmail]] to analyze information in emails. This use of the information will then affect the type of advertisements shown to the user when they use Gmail. Facebook has partnered with many data mining companies such as [[Datalogix]] and [[BlueKai]] to use customer information for [[targeted advertising]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Leaver|first=Tama|date=May 2013|title=The Social Media Contradiction: Data Mining and Digital Death|url=http://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/viewArticle/625|journal=M/C Journal|volume=16|issue=2|doi=10.5204/mcj.625|access-date=2018-06-20}}</ref> Massive amounts of data from social platforms allows scientists and [[machine learning]] researchers to extract insights and build product features.<ref name=":15">Sumbaly, R., Kreps, J., & Shah, S.

In Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data (pp. 1125-1134). ACM.]</ref>

Ethical questions of the extent to which a company should be able to utilize a user's information have been called "[[big data]]".<ref name=":2" /> Users tend to click through Terms of Use agreements when signing up on social media platforms, and they do not know how their information will be used by companies. This leads to questions of privacy and surveillance when user data is recorded. Some social media outlets have added capture time and [[Geotagged|Geotagging]] that helps provide information about the context of the data as well as making their data more accurate.

On April 10, 2018, in a hearing held in response to revelations of data harvesting by [[Cambridge Analytica]], Mark Zuckerberg, the [[Facebook]] chief executive, faced questions from senators on a variety of issues, from privacy to the company's business model and the company's mishandling of data. This was Mr. Zuckerberg's first appearance before Congress, prompted by the revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm linked to the Trump campaign, harvested the data of an estimated 87&nbsp;million Facebook users to psychologically profile voters during the 2016 election. Zuckerberg was pressed to account for how third-party partners could take data without users’ knowledge. Lawmakers grilled the 33-year-old executive on the proliferation of so-called fake news on Facebook, Russian interference during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] and censorship of conservative media.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-testimony.html|title=Mark Zuckerberg Testimony: Senators Question Facebook's Commitment to Privacy|last=Times|first=The New York|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}</ref>

===Critique of activism===
For [[Malcolm Gladwell]], the role of social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, in revolutions and protests is overstated.<ref name="Gladwell 2010-10-04">{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/04/small-change-3 |author=Malcolm Gladwell |title=Small Changes – Why the revolution will not be tweeted |date=October 4, 2010 |access-date=2012-11-15}}</ref> On one hand, social media makes it easier for individuals, and in this case activists, to express themselves. On the other hand, it is harder for that expression to have an impact.<ref name="Gladwell 2010-10-04"/> Gladwell distinguishes between social media activism and high-risk activism, which brings real changes. Activism and especially high-risk activism involves strong-tie relationships, hierarchies, coordination, motivation, exposing oneself to high risks, making sacrifices.<ref name="Gladwell 2010-10-04"/> Gladwell discusses that social media are built around weak ties and he argues that "social networks are effective at increasing participation — by lessening the level of motivation that participation requires".<ref name="Gladwell 2010-10-04"/> According to him "Facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice, but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice".<ref name="Gladwell 2010-10-04"/>

Disputing Gladwell's theory, in the study "Perceptions of Social Media for Politics: Testing the Slacktivism Hypothesis", Kwak and colleagues conducted a survey which found that people who are politically expressive on social media are also more likely to participate in offline political activity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kwak|first1=Nojin|last2=Lane|first2=Daniel S|last3=Weeks|first3=Brian E|last4=Kim|first4=Dam Hee|last5=Lee|first5=Slgi S|last6=Bachleda|first6=Sarah|date=April 1, 2018|title=Perceptions of Social Media for Politics: Testing the Slacktivism Hypothesis|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=44|issue=2|pages=197–221|doi=10.1093/hcr/hqx008|issn=0360-3989}}</ref>

===Ownership of content===
Social media content is generated through social media interactions done by users through the site. There has always been a huge debate on the ownership of the content on social media platforms because it is generated by the users and hosted by the company. Added to this is the danger to the security of information, which can be leaked to third parties with economic interests in the platform, or parasites who comb the data for their own databases.<ref name=Jones>{{cite web |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall05-papers/facebook.pdf |last1=Jones |first1=Harvey |last2=Soltren |first2=José Hiram |title=Facebook: Threats to Privacy |publisher=MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab |year= 2005 |access-date=2018-04-04 }}</ref>

===Privacy===
{{main|Privacy concerns with social networking services}}
Privacy rights advocates warn users on social media about the collection of their personal data. Some information is captured without the user's knowledge or [[consent]] through electronic tracking and third party applications. Data may also be collected for law enforcement and governmental purposes,<ref name=Auer2001/> by [[social media intelligence]] using [[data mining]] techniques.<ref name=Jones/> Data and information may also be collected for third party use. When information is shared on social media, that information is no longer private. There have been many cases in which young persons especially, share personal information, which can attract predators. It is very important to monitor what you share and to be aware of who you could potentially be sharing that information with. Teens especially share significantly more information on the internet now than they have in the past. Teens are much more likely to share their personal information, such as email address, phone number, and school names.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy |last=Madden |first=Mary |display-authors=etal |date=May 21, 2013 |website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science & Tech |access-date=2016-11-29 }}</ref> Studies suggest that teens are not aware of what they are posting and how much of that information can be accessed by third parties.

There are arguments that "privacy is dead" and that with social media growing more and more, some heavy social media users appear to have become quite unconcerned with privacy. Others argue, however, that people are still very concerned about their privacy, but are being ignored by the companies running these social networks, who can sometimes make a profit off of sharing someone's personal information. There is also a disconnect between social media user's words and their actions. Studies suggest that surveys show that people want to keep their lives private, but their actions on social media suggest otherwise. Everyone leaves a trail when they use social media. Every time someone creates a new social media account, they provide personal information that can include their name, birthdate, geographic location, and personal interests. In addition, companies collect data on user behaviors. All of this data is stored and leveraged by companies to better target advertising to their users.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Social Media Privacy Issues for 2020: Threats & Risks|url=https://sopa.tulane.edu/blog/key-social-media-privacy-issues-2020|access-date=2020-11-12|website=sopa.tulane.edu}}</ref>  

Another factor is ignorance of how accessible social media posts are. Some social media users who have been criticized for inappropriate comments stated that they did not realize that anyone outside their circle of friends would read their posts; in fact, on some social media sites, unless a user selects higher privacy settings, their content is shared with a wide audience.

According to a 2016 article diving into the topic of sharing privately and the effect social media has on expectations of privacy, "1.18 billion people will log into their [[Facebook]] accounts, 500 million tweets will be sent, and there will be 95 million photos and videos posted on [[Instagram]]" in a day. Much of the privacy concerns individuals face stem from their own posts on a form of a social network. Users have the choice to share voluntarily and have been ingrained into society as routine and normative. Social media are a snapshot of our lives; a community we have created on the behaviors of sharing, posting, liking, and communicating. Sharing has become a phenomenon which social media and networks have uprooted and introduced to the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/sunday-review/we-want-privacy-but-cant-stop-sharing.html|title=We Want Privacy, but Can't Stop Sharing|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=October 4, 2014|work=The New York Times}}</ref> The idea of privacy is redundant; once something is posted, its accessibility remains constant even if we select who is potentially able to view it. People desire privacy in some shape or form, yet also contribute to social media, which makes it difficult to maintain privacy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=Max|s2cid=151703849|title=Sharing Privately|journal=Journal of Media Law|volume=9|pages=45–71|doi=10.1080/17577632.2016.1272235|year=2017}}</ref> Mills offers options for reform which include copyright and the application of the law of confidence; more radically, a change to the concept of privacy itself.

A 2014 [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that 91% of Americans "agree" or "strongly agree" that people have lost control over how personal information is collected and used by all kinds of entities. Some 80% of social media users said they were concerned about advertisers and businesses accessing the data they share on social media platforms, and 64% said the government should do more to regulate advertisers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/27/americans-complicated-feelings-about-social-media-in-an-era-of-privacy-concerns/|title=Americans' complicated feelings about social media in an era of privacy concerns|date=March 27, 2018|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}</ref>

According to the wall street journal published on February 17, 2019, According to UK law, Facebook did not protect certain aspects of the user data.<ref>Stephen Fidler and Georgia Wells,[https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-committee-rebukes-facebook-in-call-for-social-media-regulation-11550448060#comments_sector “U.K.Lawmakers Rebuke Facebook in Call for Social-Media Regulation"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', February 17, 2019</ref>

It is important to note that each social media platform<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-03-08|title=Social Media Accounts After a Loved One Dies|url=https://beyond.life/help-centre/admin-legal/social-media-accounts-loved-one-dies/|access-date=2020-11-28|website=Beyond|language=en-GB}}</ref> has created different guidelines<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-03-08|title=Social Media Accounts After a Loved One Dies|url=https://beyond.life/help-centre/admin-legal/social-media-accounts-loved-one-dies/|access-date=2020-11-27|website=Beyond|language=en-GB}}</ref> for people whom have died. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Pinterest all have different guidelines when it comes to deleting and/or deactivating someone's social media account(s) once someone has died. It is important to examine one's options on social media once someone has died. 

For Twitter,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-03-08|title=Social Media Accounts After a Loved One Dies|url=https://beyond.life/help-centre/admin-legal/social-media-accounts-loved-one-dies/|access-date=2020-11-28|website=Beyond|language=en-GB}}</ref> if the user has died, the company will work with an immediate family member to deactivate<ref>{{Cite web|title=How to contact Twitter about a deceased family member's account|url=https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/contact-twitter-about-a-deceased-family-members-account|access-date=2020-11-28|website=help.twitter.com|language=en}}</ref> the account. Additionally, Twitter will not give the account to any person(s), regardless of the relationship. 

For Facebook,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-03-08|title=Social Media Accounts After a Loved One Dies|url=https://beyond.life/help-centre/admin-legal/social-media-accounts-loved-one-dies/|access-date=2020-11-28|website=Beyond|language=en-GB}}</ref> the company added a new setting last year that gives users the option of having their account permanently deleted when one dies. There is also an option for 'legacy contact' which means that the Facebook user can have a family and/or friend take over the account once the person has died. The 'legacy contact' option is under the security tab at the bottom of the page. 

For Instagram, there are two options for people who have died.

Ultimately, it is up to the person who has created the accounts to decide what one wants to do with one's social media account once one has died. 

===Criticism of commercialization===

The commercial development of social media has been criticized as the actions of consumers in these settings have become increasingly value-creating, for example when consumers contribute to the marketing and branding of specific products by posting positive reviews. As such, value-creating activities also increase the value of a specific product, which could, according to the marketing professors Bernad Cova and Daniele Dalli, lead to what they refer to as "double exploitation".<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Cova |first1=Bernard |last2=Dalli |first2=Daniele |s2cid=54610246 |date=2009 |title=Working consumers: the next step in marketing theory?  |journal=Marketing Theory |doi=10.1177/1470593109338144 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=315–339|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/36717/1/MPRA_paper_36717.pdf }}</ref> Companies are getting consumers to create content for the companies' websites for which the consumers are not paid.

As social media usage has become increasingly widespread, social media has to a large extent come to be subjected to [[commercialization]] by [[marketing companies]] and advertising agencies.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/27913/1/gupea_2077_27913_1.pdf |title=Marketing fads and fashions – exploring digital marketing practices and emerging organisational fields |last=Pihl |first=Christofer |publisher=Gothenburg University |year=2011 |location=Gothenburg }}</ref> Christofer Laurell, a digital marketing researcher, suggested that the social media landscape currently consists of three types of places because of this development: consumer-dominated places, professionally dominated places and places undergoing commercialization.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:682055/FULLTEXT01.pdf |title=Commercialising social media: a study of fashion (blogo)spheres |last=Laurell |first=Christofer |publisher=Stockholm University |year=2014 }}</ref> As social media becomes commercialized, this process have been shown to create novel forms of value networks stretching between consumer and producer<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Pihl |first=Christofer |s2cid=167869913 |date=2013 |title=When customers create the ad and sell it –a value network approach |journal=Journal of Global Scholars of Marketing Science |doi=10.1080/21639159.2013.763487|volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=127–143}}</ref> in which a combination of personal, private and commercial contents are created.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Pihl |first1=Christofer |last2=Sandström |first2=Christian |date=2013 |title=Value creation and appropriation in social media –the case of fashion bloggers in Sweden  |journal=International Journal of Technology Management |doi=10.1504/IJTM.2013.052673 |volume=61 |issue=3/4 |page=309}}</ref>

===Debate over addiction===
{{Main|Problematic social media use}}
As one of the biggest preoccupations among adolescents is social media usage, researchers have begun using the term "F.A.D.", or "Facebook addiction disorder", a form of [[internet addiction disorder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/facebook-addiction-disorder-the-6-symptoms-of-f-a-d/ |title=Facebook Addiction Disorder — The 6 Symptoms of F.A.D. |work=adweek.com |date=May 2, 2011 |access-date=2011-05-02}}</ref> FAD is characterized by compulsive use of the social networking site Facebook, which generally results in physical or psychological complications. The disorder, although not classified in the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) or by the World Health Organization, has been the subject of several studies focusing on the negative effects on the psyche. One German study, published in 2017, investigated a correlation between extensive use of the social networking site and narcissism; the results were published in the journal PLoS One. According to the findings: "FAD was significantly positively related to the personality trait narcissism and to negative mental health variables (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms)."<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brailovskaia | first1 = J | year = 2017 | title = Facebook Addiction Disorder (FAD) among German students—A longitudinal approach | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 12 | issue = 12| pages = 2423–2478 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0189719 | pmid = 29240823 | pmc = 5730190 | bibcode = 2017PLoSO..1289719B }}</ref> While these issues regarding social media addiction are continuous and increasing, there are ways to help reduce and curb one's social media obsessions. Turning off notifications (temporary or long-term) is one solution that is deemed beneficial in attempts to lessen social media addiction by resolving issues of distraction, for those who struggle with the habit of constantly refreshing social media platforms and checking for new notifications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/blog/portion-control-in-social-media-how-limiting-time-increases-well-being/|title=Portion-Control in Social Media?

===Debate over use in academic settings===
{{Main|Use of social media in education|Social media in education}}
Having social media in the classroom was a controversial topic in the 2010s. Many parents and educators have been fearful of the repercussions of having social media in the classroom.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kist |first=W. |year=2012 |title=Class get ready to tweet: Social media in the classroom. Our children |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ991339.pdf |website=files.eric.ed.gov}}</ref> There are concerns that social media tools can be misused for [[cyberbullying]] or sharing inappropriate content. As result, cell phones have been banned from some classrooms, and some schools have blocked many popular social media websites. Many schools have realized that they need to loosen restrictions, teach digital citizenship skills, and even incorporate these tools into classrooms. Some schools permit students to use [[smartphone]]s or [[tablet computer]]s in class, as long as the students are using these devices for academic purposes, such as doing research. Using Facebook in class allows for the integration of multimodal content such as student-created photographs and video and URLs to other texts, in a platform that many students are already familiar with. Twitter can be used to enhance communication building and critical thinking and it provides students with an informal "[[back channel]]"), and extend discussion outside of class time.

===Censorship by governments{{anchor|Censorship_incidents}}===

Social media often features in political struggles to control public perception and online activity. In some countries, [[Internet police]] or [[secret police]] monitor or control citizens' use of social media. For example, in 2013 some social media was banned in [[Turkey]] after the Taksim [[Gezi Park protests]]. Both Twitter and YouTube were temporarily suspended in the country by a court's decision. A new law, passed by [[Turkish Parliament]], has granted immunity to Telecommunications Directorate (TİB) personnel. The TİB was also given the authority to block access to specific websites without the need for a court order.<ref>{{cite web|author=Salih Sarıkaya |title=Social Media Ban In Turkey: What Does It Mean? by Salih Sarıkaya |url=http://www.salihsarikaya.com/en/social-media-ban-in-turkey-what-does-it-mean-by-salih-sarikaya/ |date=October 30, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006012638/http://www.salihsarikaya.com/en/social-media-ban-in-turkey-what-does-it-mean-by-salih-sarikaya/ |archive-date=2014-10-06 }}</ref> Yet TİB's 2014 blocking of Twitter was ruled by the constitutional court to violate free speech.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-twitter-ban-idUSBREA311BF20140402 |title=Turkey's Twitter ban violates free speech: constitutional court |work=Reuters |date=April 2, 2014 }}</ref> More recently, in the [[2014 Thai coup d'état]], the public was explicitly instructed not to 'share' or 'like' dissenting views on social media or face prison. In July of that same year, in response to [[WikiLeaks]]' release of a secret suppression order made by the [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Victorian Supreme Court]], media lawyers were quoted in the [[Australia]]n media to the effect that "anyone who tweets a link to the WikiLeaks report, posts it on Facebook, or shares it in any way online could also face charges".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/social-media-users-could-be-charged-for-sharing-wikileaks-story-20140730-zye0b.html |title=Social media users could be charged for sharing WikiLeaks story |author=Mex Cooper |publisher=[[Brisbane Times]] |date=July 30, 2014}}</ref> On 27 July 2020, in Egypt, two women were sentenced to two years of imprisonment for posting [[TikTok]] videos, which the government claims are “violating family values”.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/world/middleeast/egypt-women-tiktok-prison.html|title=Egypt Sentences Women to 2 Years in Prison for TikTok Videos|access-date=28 July 2020|website=The New York Times}}</ref>

===Decentralization and open standards===
[[Mastodon (software)|Mastodon]], [[GNU social]], [[Diaspora (social network)|Diaspora]], [[Friendica]] and other compatible software packages operate as a loose federation of mostly volunteer-operated servers, called the [[Fediverse]], which connect with each other through the open source protocol [[ActivityPub]]. In early 2019, Mastodon successfully blocked the spread of violent right-wing extremism when the Twitter alternative [[Gab (social network)|Gab]] tried to associate with Mastodon, and their independent servers quickly contained its dissemination.<ref>Kan, M. (December 2019). [https://www.pcmag.com/news/372488/twitter-wants-social-media-to-be-more-like-email "Twitter Wants Social Media to Be More Like Email"]. ''pcmag.com''. Retrieved 14 December 2019.</ref>

In December 2019, Twitter CEO [[Jack Dorsey]] made a similar suggestion, stating that efforts would be taken to achieve an "open and decentralized standard for social media". Rather than "deplatforming", such standards would allow a more scalable, and customizable approach to content moderation and censorship, and involve a number of companies, in the way that e-mail servers work.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

===Deplatforming===
{{Main|Deplatforming|Twitter suspensions}}
[[Deplatforming]] is a form of Internet censorship in which controversial speakers or speech are suspended, banned, or otherwise shut down by social media platforms and other service providers that normally provide a venue for free expression.<ref name=Reynolds/> These kinds of actions are similar to alternative dispute resolution.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2020-04-01|title=Federal Rules of Platform Procedure|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/905|journal=Faculty Scholarship}}</ref>{{rp|4}}  As early as 2015, platforms such as [[Reddit]] began to enforce selective bans based, for example, on [[terms of service]] that prohibit "[[hate speech]]".<ref name=ACM>{{cite journal |title=You Can't Stay Here: The Efficacy of Reddit's 2015 Ban Examined Through Hate Speech |first1=Eshwar |last1=Chandrasekharan |first2=Umashanti |last2=Pavalanathan |s2cid=22713682 |display-authors=etal |journal=Proc.

Law professor [[Glenn Reynolds]] dubbed 2018 the "Year of Deplatforming", in an August 2018 article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref name=Reynolds/> According to Reynolds, in 2018 "the internet giants decided to slam the gates on a number of people and ideas they don't like. If you rely on someone else's platform to express unpopular ideas, especially ideas on the right, you're now at risk."<ref name=Reynolds>{{cite news |title=When Digital Platforms Become Censors |first=Glenn Harlan |last=Reynolds |date=August 18, 2018 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-digital-platforms-become-censors-1534514122?mod=rsswn |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330045941/https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-digital-platforms-become-censors-1534514122?mod=rsswn |archive-date=2019-03-30 }}</ref> Reynolds cited [[Alex Jones]], [[Gavin McInnes]] and [[Dennis Prager]] as prominent 2018 victims of deplatforming based on their political views, noting, "Extremists and controversialists on the left have been relatively safe from deplatforming."<ref name=Reynolds/>

Most people see social media platforms as censoring objectionable political views.<ref>https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/08/19/most-americans-think-social-media-sites-censor-political-viewpoints/</ref>

=== Reproduction of class distinctions ===
According to [[Danah Boyd]]’s, "White Flight in Networked Publics? How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and Facebook", the media plays a large role in shaping people's perceptions of specific [[social networking service]]s. When looking at the site [[Myspace|MySpace]], after adults started to realize how popular the site was becoming with teens, news media became heavily concerned with teen participation and the potential dangers they faced using the site. As a result, teens avoided joining the site because of the associated risks (e.g. child predators and lack of control), and parents began to publicly denounce the site. Ultimately, the site was labeled as dangerous, and many were detracted from interacting with the site. As Boyd also describes, when [[Facebook]] initially launched in 2004, it solely targeted college students and access was intentionally limited. Facebook started as a [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-only [[social networking service]] before expanding to all other [[Ivy League]] schools. It then made its way to other top universities and ultimately to a wider range of schools. Because of its origins, some saw Facebook as an "elite" [[social networking service]]. While it was very open and accepting to some, it seemed to outlaw and shun out most others who didn't fit that "elite" categorization. These narratives propagated by the media influenced the large movement of teenage users from one [[social networking service]] to another.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race After the Internet|last=boyd |first=danah| publisher=Routledge|year=2011|editor-last=Nakamura| editor-first=Lisa|pages=203–222|chapter=White Flight in Networked Publics?
