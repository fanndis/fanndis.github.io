'''Vote.org''', formerly '''Long Distance Voter''', is a nonpartisan<ref>https://www.vote.org/about/</ref> [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit  organization founded in January 2008 in the [[United States]] by a group of professional investigators and voter advocates that initially sought to provide greater access to [[absentee voting]] information online.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/long-distance-voter-goes-the-d |title=Long Distance Voter Goes the Distance |work=[[Teen Vogue]] |date=2008-10-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511182528/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/long-distance-voter-goes-the-d |archivedate=2018-05-11 |accessdate=2018-05-11}}</ref><ref name="vetter"/> Long Distance Voter was volunteer-led, but Vote.org employs full time staff.

In June 2020, Vote.org filed suit against Maine, in partnership with two citizens and the Alliance for Retired Americans, citing its inaccessible and out-of-date voting system. The organization claimed that the state was doing more to deter people from voting than encourage them. Some of the most prominent issues that Vote.org flagged in Maine’s voting system were few voter registration options, a lack of prepaid postage, ballot collection hurdles, an Election Day receipt deadline, and rejection of absentee ballots that had technical defects—to name a few.<ref>https://www.popsugar.com/news/voteorg-is-suing-maine-47631286</ref>
