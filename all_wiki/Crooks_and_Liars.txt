The blog first appeared on the Internet in August 2004. It was one of the first political blogs to feature [[vlogs]] (video blogs) causing Amato to be referred to as "The Vlogfather".{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. The site contains an audio and video archive of various political events, television, and radio shows. Originally it only retransmitted audio and video of these events; however, in late 2005 it began to cover breaking news stories and distribute their own original audio interviews.

Along with a variety of clips from television news media, the site frequently features clips from [[Cable television|cable]] programs such as ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)]],  and ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]''.
