==History and profile==
[[File:Good Housekeeping masthead Vol I No 1 (1885).png|left|thumb|Masthead for the first issue of ''Good Housekeeping'' as it appeared on May 2, 1885]]
On {{start date and age|1885|5|2|paren=y}}, [[Clark W. Bryan]] founded ''Good Housekeeping'' in [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]] as a fortnightly magazine.<ref name="founding">{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sWoaAAAAIBAJ&pg=5113,4715939|title=Good Housekeeping's Seal Stamps Its Approval | last = Belkin | first = Lisa |work=[[Milwaukee Journal]] |date= June 15, 1985 |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Top 100 U.S. Magazines by Circulation | date = n.d. |url=http://www.psaresearch.com/images/TOPMAGAZINES.pdf |work=PSA Research Center |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128021733/http://www.psaresearch.com/images/TOPMAGAZINES.pdf|archive-date=January 28, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>  The magazine became a monthly publication in 1891.<ref name="Encyclopedia.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/media/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/good-housekeeping|title=Good Housekeeping | work = Encyclopedia.com | date = July 23, 2020 |access-date= August 2, 2020}}</ref>

The magazine achieved a circulation of 300,000 by 1911, at which time it was bought by the [[Hearst Corporation]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Magda | last = Ibrahim |title=Magazines ABCs: Women's monthlies led by Good Housekeeping |url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/article/1333610/magazines-abcs-womens-monthlies-led-good-housekeeping |accessdate=April 24, 2016 |work=MediaWeek |date=February 12, 2015}}</ref> It topped one million in the mid-1920s, and continued to rise, even during the [[Great Depression]] and its aftermath.  In 1938, a year in which the magazine advertising dropped 22 percent, ''Good Housekeeping'' showed an operating profit of $2,583,202, more than three times the profit of Hearst's other eight magazines combined,<ref>''Printer's Ink'', Vol. 186, March 16, 1939, pg. 16.</ref> and probably the most profitable monthly of its time.  Circulation topped 2,500,000 in 1943, 3,500,000 in the mid-1950s, 5,000,000 in 1962, and 5,500,000 per month in 1966.  1959 profits were more than $11 million.<ref>{{cite book | last = Mott | first = Frank Luther | title = A History of American Magazines | year = 1968 | publisher = Harvard University Press | pages = 140–143}}</ref>

''Good Housekeeping'' is one of the "[[Seven Sisters (magazines)|Seven Sisters]]", a group of women's service magazines.<ref name="Encyclopedia.com" />

In 1922, the Hearst Corporation created a [[United Kingdom|British]] edition along the same lines, named ''British Good Housekeeping''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/11178322/Good-Housekeeping-Institute.html |title=Good Housekeeping Institute: meet the team testing every item in your home |last=Hart |first=Carolyn |date=October 24, 2014 |access-date= December 4, 2019 |language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

In 1900, the  "Experiment Station", the predecessor to the Good Housekeeping Research Institute (GHRI), was founded. In 1902, the magazine was calling this "An Inflexible Contract Between the Publisher and Each Subscriber."  The formal opening of the headquarters of GHRI – the Model Kitchen, Testing Station for Household Devices, and Domestic Science Laboratory – occurred in January 1910.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/products/100-anniversary-GHRI-1001 |title=The 100th Anniversary of the Good Housekeeping Research Institute |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104213915/http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/products/100-anniversary-GHRI-1001 |archive-date=January 4, 2008 |work =Good Housekeeping | publisher = Hearst Communications, Inc. |accessdate=January 12, 2008}}</ref>

In 1909, the magazine established the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. Products advertised in the magazine that bear the seal are tested by GHRI and are backed by a two-year limited warranty. About 5,000 products have been given the seal.<ref name="WP2008">{{cite news | first = Walter | last = Nicholls | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/01/AR2008010100642_pf.html | title = Surviving the Test of Time: At Good Housekeeping, A Modern Makeover And Old-Fashioned Appeal | date = January 2, 2008 | work = Washington Post}}</ref>

In April 1912, a year after Hearst bought the magazine, [[Harvey W. Wiley]], the first commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (1907–1912), became head of GHRI and a contributing editor whose "Question Box" feature ran for decades.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F06EEDA1F31E233A25755C2A9629C946396D6CF | title = Dr. Wiley's Debut as Editor; He Says He Will Be a Watchdog for the Nation's Housekeepers | work = The New York Times | date = April 26, 1912 | page = 9}}</ref> Beginning with a "Beauty Clinic" in 1932, departments were added to the Institute, including a "Baby's Center", "Foods and Cookery", and a "Needlework Room".  Some functioned as testing laboratories, while others were designed to produce editorial copy.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

After the passage of the [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] in 1938, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture Rexford Tugwell sought to promote a government grading system.  The Hearst Corporation opposed the policy in spirit, and began publishing a monthly tabloid attacking federal oversight.  In 1939, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] filed a complaint against ''Good Housekeeping'' for "misleading and deceptive" guarantees including its Seal of Approval, and "exaggerated and false" claims in its advertisements.  The publisher fought the proceedings for two years, during which time competing editors from the ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'' and ''[[McCall's]]'' testified against ''Good Housekeeping''.  The FTC's ultimate ruling was against the magazine, forcing it to remove some claims and phraseology from its ad pages.  The words "Tested and Approved" were dropped from the Seal of Approval.  But the magazine's popularity was unaffected, steadily rising in circulation and profitability. In 1962, the wording of the Seal was changed to a guarantee of "Product or Performance", while dropping its endorsement of rhetorical promises made by the advertisers. In its varying forms, the Seal of Approval became inextricably associated with the magazine, and many others (e.g., ''McCall's'', ''[[Parents Magazine]]'', and ''[[Better Homes and Gardens (magazine)|Better Homes and Gardens]]'') mimicked the practice.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 2012, the test kitchen of the Good Housekeeping Research Institute was implemented into a new instructional cooking, nutrition, and exercise TV show on the [[Cooking Channel]], entitled ''Drop 5 lbs with Good Housekeeping''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.poptower.com/news-38939/not-my-mamas-meals-drop-5-lbs-with-good-housekeeping-premiere.htm | title = Cooking Channel Serves Up Fresh Series | date = December 7, 2011 | location = New York, New York | work = Pop Tower | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160326022142/http://www.poptower.com/news-38939/not-my-mamas-meals-drop-5-lbs-with-good-housekeeping-premiere.htm | archive-date = March 26, 2016}}</ref>

==International editions==
''Good Housekeeping'' began to be published in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1922.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ping Shaw|title=Internationalization of the women's magazine industry in Taiwan context, process and influence|journal=Asian Journal of Communication|date=1999|volume=9|issue=2|pages=17–38|doi=10.1080/01292989909359623}}</ref> [[William Randolph Hearst]] appointed [[Alice Maud Head]] initially as assistant editor. Head rose to be the Managing Director, as well as purportedly being the highest paid woman in Europe. As Hearst's deputy, Head would make decisions on his behalf about not just editing, but also buying for him [[St Donat's Castle]], expensive art objects, and three giraffes for his zoo. Head remained head until 1939.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | author-link = Martin Pugh (author) | first = Martin | last = Pugh | title = Head, Alice Maud (1886–1981) | encyclopedia = [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 2004 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50062 | access-date = April 20, 2017}}</ref>

In Latin America, the magazine was known as ''Buenhogar''. It was published in the United States and Latin America by [[Televisa|Editorial América]].
