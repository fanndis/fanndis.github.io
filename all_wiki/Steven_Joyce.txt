===First term, 2008–2011===
On 8 November 2008, Joyce was elected as a [[Electoral system of New&nbsp;Zealand|list-only candidate]] (ranked 16th on the [[party list]]) at the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008&nbsp;election]] in the [[Fifth National Government of New&nbsp;Zealand]] of the [[49th New Zealand Parliament|49th Parliament of New Zealand]] representing the [[New Zealand National Party]].

As a first term member of parliament, Joyce was appointed to the office of the [[Minister of Transport (New Zealand)|Minister of Transport]] and the office of the [[Minister for Communications and Information (New Zealand)|Communications and Information Technology]].<ref>"Appointment of Ministers" (21 November 2008), 179 [http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/8155efb9e8df9c7ecc25750f0047784d!OpenDocument ''New Zealand Gazette''], pg. 4635.</ref> Joyce was also appointed as a member of the [[Executive Council of New Zealand|Executive Council]]<ref>"Members of Executive Council Appointed" (21 November 2008), 179 [http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/f0b26c54c2b6dd0ecc25750f00477759!OpenDocument ''New Zealand Gazette''], pg. 4634.</ref> and was titled as [[The Honourable#New Zealand|The Honourable]] [[Member of parliament|Steven Leonard Joyce, MP]]. During his tenure as Minister of Transport a number of changes were introduced. In November 2009 a ban on using cellphones while driving came into effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/2750905/Cellphone-ban-comes-with-fines|title=Cellphone ban comes with fines|last=Williams|first=David|date=14 August 2009|work=[[The Press]]|accessdate=10 March 2010}}</ref>

In 2010, New Zealand's unique right-hand rule at intersections was reversed. The minimum driving age was also raised from 15 to 16.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10629628&pnum=0|title=NZ's right-hand rule set for change|date=3 March 2010|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=10 March 2010}}</ref> Both measures were subject to cabinet approval and public consultation, and eventually passed into law.<ref name="first actions">{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.govt.nz/saferjourneys/Documents/Safer%20Journeys%20First%20Actions.pdf|title=Safer Journeys, First Actions|date=March 2010|publisher=Ministry of Transport|accessdate=11 March 2010|location=Wellington}}</ref>

This minimum driving age proposal was criticised by the editorial board of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' for being too hesitant after experts and the public had favoured raising the driving age as high as 18 and in the opinion of the newspaper, Joyce "had not shown the resolve to follow the recommendations".<ref name="EDIT">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10629519|title=Editorial: Cabinet keeps to slow lane on driving age|date=3 March 2010|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=10 March 2010}}</ref>

He helped create [[Auckland Transport]] as a [[council-controlled organisation]] for [[Auckland Council|Auckland]]. Joyce stated that "Auckland will need a good agency focused on delivering the projects that have been agreed by council" and noting that Council had a number of ways of ensuring that the entity was accountable.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10631260|title=Joyce adamant on city transport giant|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=11 March 2010|first=Bernard|last=Orsman}}</ref>

Joyce was also appointed to the Office of [https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2016-go2994 Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment]<ref>"Appointment of Ministers" (27 January 2010) 5 [http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/658bf950ed55760ccc256ce40072801f/e6113ed4e16f69d9cc2576bb00005bcb!OpenDocument ''New Zealand Gazette''], pg. 221.</ref> replacing Anne Tolley, effective 27 January 2010.

In the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 election]] for the [[50th New Zealand Parliament]] Joyce retained his seat in Parliament (as a list candidate, now rated 13th on the party list) and was appointed to the office of Minister for [[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)|Economic Development]].<ref>"Vice Regal: Appointment of Ministers" (15 December 2011) 193 [http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/70c282b39a4e2bb2cc2579670056d474!OpenDocument ''New Zealand Gazette''], pg. 5651; accessed 25 January 2016.</ref> in the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand]].

===Third term, 2014–2017===
In what became known as the [[Waitangi dildo incident]], a rubber sex toy was thrown at Joyce during an anti-[[Trans-Pacific Partnership|TPPA]] protest at the 2016 Waitangi Day celebrations while he was speaking to media. The protester responsible, Josie Butler, a nurse from Christchurch, shouted "That’s for raping our sovereignty". She claimed she was protesting against the TPPA. She was taken away by police, but not charged.<ref>{{cite news|author=Elle Hunt|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/16/new-zealand-mp-dildo-baggins-cops-sex-toy-in-the-face-and-takes-ribbing-on-the-chin|title=New Zealand MP 'Dildo Baggins' cops sex toy in the face and takes ribbing on the chin|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref>

During the 2017 election, Joyce stood on the National Party list and was re-elected.<ref>{{cite web|title=2017 General Election – Successful candidates|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/successful-candidates.html|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=23 November 2017}}</ref> National won 44% of the popular vote and 56 seats; maintaining its plurality in the New Zealand House of Representatives.<ref>{{cite web|title=2017 General Election – Official Results|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/|publisher=Electoral Commission|accessdate=23 November 2017}}</ref> However, National fell short of the majority needed to govern alone.
