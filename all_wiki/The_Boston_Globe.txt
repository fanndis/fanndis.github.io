The first issue was published on March 4, 1872, and sold for four cents ({{Inflation|US|0.04|1872|r=2|fmt=eq}}). Originally a morning daily, it began a Sunday edition in 1877, which absorbed the rival '''''Boston Weekly Globe''''' in 1892.<ref name="loc">{{cite news |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024522/ |access-date=November 9, 2015 |title=About the Boston Weekly Globe |website=Chronicling America |publisher=[[The Library of Congress]]}}</ref> In 1878, ''The Boston Globe'' started an afternoon edition called '''''The Boston Evening Globe''''', which ceased publication in 1979.

In 1912, the ''Globe'' was one of a cooperative of four newspapers, including the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'', ''[[The New York Globe]]'', and the ''[[Philadelphia Bulletin]]'', to form the [[Associated Newspapers (U.S.)|Associated Newspapers]] syndicate.

In 1965, [[Thomas Winship]] succeeded his father, Larry Winship, as editor. The younger Winship transformed ''The Globe'' from a mediocre local paper into a regional paper of national distinction. He served as editor until 1984, during which time the paper won a dozen [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, the first in the paper's history.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/15/us/thomas-winship-ex-editor-of-boston-globe-dies-at-81.html|title=Thomas Winship, Ex-Editor of Boston Globe, Dies at 81|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=March 15, 2002|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=January 13, 2017}}</ref>

''The Boston Globe'' was a private company until 1973 when it went public under the name '''Affiliated Publications'''. It continued to be managed by the descendants of Charles H. Taylor.

The president responded with a tweet accusing the media of collusion. ''The Globe'' later received several phone threats with at least one threat mentioning an afternoon bomb.

==Reporter fabrications and plagiarism==

In 1998, columnist [[Patricia Smith (poet)|Patricia Smith]] was forced to resign after it was discovered that she had fabricated people and quotations in several of her columns.<ref>{{cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=Sinéad|date=September 1998|title=Secrets And Lies|journal=[[American Journalism Review]]|url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=648}}</ref> In August of that year, columnist [[Mike Barnicle]] was discovered to have copied material for a column from a [[George Carlin]] book, ''[[Brain Droppings]]''. He was suspended for this offense, and his past columns were reviewed. ''The Boston Globe'' editors found that Barnicle had fabricated a story about two cancer patients, and Barnicle was forced to resign.<ref>{{cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=Sinéad|date=September 1998|title=For Barnicle, One Controversy Too Many|journal=[[American Journalism Review]]|url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=192}}</ref>

In the spring of 2005, ''The Boston Globe'' retracted a story describing the events of a seal hunt near [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] that took place on April 12, 2005. Written by freelancer Barbara Stewart, a former ''[[The New York Times]]'' staffer, the article described the specific number of boats involved in the hunt and graphically described the killing of seals and the protests that accompanied it. In reality, weather had delayed the hunt, which had not yet begun the day the story had been filed, proving that the details were fabricated.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kurtz|first=Howard|author-link=Howard Kurtz|date=April 16, 2005|title=Boston Globe Admits Freelancer's Story Included Fabrications|journal=[[The Washington Post]]|pages=C01|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57908-2005Apr15.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/04/15/for_the_record/|title=For the record|author=The Boston Globe|work=The Boston Globe|date=April 15, 2005}}</ref>

==Other controversies==
In 2004, the ''Globe'' apologized for printing graphic photographs that the article represented as showing U.S. soldiers raping Iraqi women during the [[Iraq War]] from a city councilor's presentation before they were verified. The photos had already been found by other news organizations to be from an internet pornography site.<ref>{{cite news|title=Councilor takes up Iraq issue – Turner releases purported images of rape by soldiers |journal=The Boston Globe |url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2004/05/12/2_cite_photos_purported_to_show_abuse/ |first=Donovan |last=Slack |date=May 12, 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311051009/http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2004/05/12/2_cite_photos_purported_to_show_abuse/ |archive-date=March 11, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=A series of errors on lewd images|journal=The Boston Globe|url=https://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/05/14/a_series_of_errors_on_lewd_images//|first=Christine|last=Chinlund|date=May 14, 2004}}</ref>

==Websites==
''The Boston Globe'' maintains two distinct major websites: BostonGlobe.com is a subscriber-supported site with a [[paywall]] and content from the printed paper; and [[Boston.com]], one of the first regional news portals,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Globe launches on-line service|date=October 30, 1995|work=The Boston Globe}}</ref> is supported by advertising. Between September 2011 and March 2014, the ''Globe'' gradually withdrew stories written by ''Globe'' journalists from Boston.com, making the sites more and more separated.<ref name=nieman-unbundle>{{cite web|title=Embrace the unbundling: ''The Boston Globe'' is betting it'll be stronger split up than unified|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/03/embrace-the-unbundling-the-boston-globe-is-betting-itll-be-stronger-split-up-than-unified/ |publisher=Nieman Journalism Lab|access-date=April 30, 2014|author=Justin Ellis}}</ref> BostonGlobe.com was designed to emphasize a premium experience focusing on content and emulating the visual appearance of ''The Boston Globe'' newspaper; the site was one of the first major websites to use a [[Responsive web design|responsive design]] which automatically adapts its layout to a device's screen size. Boston.com followed suit in 2014. The two sites are aimed towards different readers; while Boston.com became targeted towards "casual" readers and local content, the new ''Boston Globe'' website is targeted towards the audience of the paper itself.<ref name=paidcontent-bostonglobesite>{{cite web|title=BostonGlobe.Com Launches Today; Shifts To Paying Subscribers Only Oct. 1 |url=http://paidcontent.org/2011/09/12/419-bostonglobe-com-launches-today-shifts-to-subscribers-only-oct-1/ |work=PaidContent |access-date=August 5, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920022227/http://paidcontent.org/2011/09/12/419-bostonglobe-com-launches-today-shifts-to-subscribers-only-oct-1/ |archive-date=September 20, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=dotnet-responsive>{{cite web|title=Behind Boston Globe's responsive layout|url=http://www.netmagazine.com/news/behind-boston-globes-responsive-layout-111400|work=.net magazine|access-date=August 5, 2013}}</ref><ref name=poynter-globesite>{{cite web|title=Paywalled BostonGlobe.com launches, while Boston.com remains free|url=http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/145687/subscription-only-bostonglobe-com-launches-with-boston-com-free/|work=Poynter|access-date=August 5, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803093828/http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/145687/subscription-only-bostonglobe-com-launches-with-boston-com-free/|archive-date=August 3, 2013}}</ref>

=== Digital subscriptions ===

In December 2016, the ''Globe'' reported a total of 72,889 "restricted digital access" subscriptions and this grew to 90,440 by the end of June in 2017. In a memo to the ''Globe'' staff on New Year's Eve of 2017, editor Brian McGrory said the newspaper was closing in on 95,000 digital subscribers and would pass the 100,000 mark in the first half of 2018.

== Globe Grant (charity program) ==
''The Boston Globe'' started the GRANT ('''G'''lobe '''R'''eaders '''A'''nd '''N'''on-profits '''T'''ogether) in 2013 as a way to give back to the New England community. All ''Boston Globe'' subscribers receive a GRANT voucher during February, ranging from $25 to $125 of GRANT dollars. The amount depends on length of tenure as a subscriber; the longer one has been subscribed to the ''Globe'', the more GRANT dollars are received. Anyone who wishes to take part in this program can enter their respective subscriber number online and choose their favorite New England non-profit. The GRANT dollars earned by every non-profit can be redeemed for free advertising space in ''The Boston Globe''. Organizations usually utilize this advertising space to promote events, fundraise, or simply advertise. Every year, more and more non-profits are recognized and given the opportunity to earn free advertising space. In only three years, ''The Boston Globe'' donated over $3{{nbsp}}million of advertising space.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://manage.bostonglobe.com/grant/|title=Globe Readers And Non-profits Together|website=manage.bostonglobe.com|access-date=January 13, 2017}}</ref>
