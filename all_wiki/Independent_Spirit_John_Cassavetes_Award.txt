The '''Independent Spirit John Cassavetes Award''' is presented to the creative team of a film budgeted at less than $500,000 by the [[Independent Spirit Awards|Film Independent]], a non-profit organization dedicated to independent film and independent filmmakers. It is named after [[actor]]/[[screenwriter]]/[[film director|director]] [[John Cassavetes]], a pioneer of American independent film.

Created for the [[15th Independent Spirit Awards]], it was originally called the '''Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature (Under $500,000)'''. After that, the rules changed so that any feature film budgeted under $500,000 could be eligible (regardless of how many films the director has made), hence the new name.
