'''Orchard House''' is a [[historic house museum]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], US, opened to the public on 27 May 1912.<ref>https://patch.com/massachusetts/concord/history-of-orchard-house-and-the-united-women-s-club-of-concord</ref> It was the longtime home of [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] (1799–1888) and his family, including his daughter [[Louisa May Alcott]] (1832–1888), who wrote and set her novel ''[[Little Women]]'' (1868–69) there.

The four daughters - [[Anna Alcott Pratt|Anna]] (the oldest), [[Louisa May Alcott|Louisa]] (one year younger), [[Elizabeth Sewall Alcott|Elizabeth]] (three years younger than Louisa), and [[Abigail May Alcott|Abigail]] (the youngest, five years younger than Elizabeth) - lived in Orchard House from 1858-1877.

==History==
The Alcotts had first moved to Concord in 1840, although they left in 1843 to start [[Fruitlands (transcendental center)|Fruitlands]],<ref name="concord" >[http://www.alcott.net/frame.html Amos Bronson Alcott Network] - Concord</ref> a [[utopia]]n [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] in nearby [[Harvard, Massachusetts|Harvard]]. The family returned in 1845 and purchased a house named "Hillside,"<ref>[http://www.louisamayalcott.org/louisamaytext.html Louisa May] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113164340/http://www.louisamayalcott.org/louisamaytext.html |date=2016-01-13 }} at the official site</ref> but left again in 1852, selling to [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], who renamed it [[The Wayside]].

The Alcotts returned to Concord once again in 1857.<ref name="concord"/> They moved into Orchard House - which was then a two-story clapboard farmhouse - in the spring of 1858.<ref name=Saxton218>Saxton, Martha. ''Louisa May Alcott: A Modern Biography''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1995: 218. {{ISBN|0-374-52460-2}}</ref> At the time of purchase the site included two early eighteenth-century houses on a 12-acre (49,000m<sup>2</sup>) apple orchard.<ref name="refsheet" /> Consequently, the Alcotts named the property "Orchard House."<ref name="refsheet" /> Initially, Orchard house was too dilapidated for them to move in immediately. The Alcotts' stayed in a house on Bedford Street while repairs were being made.<ref>Alcott, Louisa May (November 2, 2015). The Annotated Little Women. Manhattan, NY: W. W. Norton & Company. p. 44. {{ISBN|978-0393072198}}.</ref> "'Tis a pretty retreat," Bronson Alcott wrote soon after moving in, "and ''ours''; a family mansion to take pride in, rescued as it is from deformity and disgrace."<ref name=Saxton218 />

Bronson Alcott made significant changes to the building. He installed alcoves for busts retrieved from his failed [[Temple School (Massachusetts)|Temple School]], repaired the staircase, installed bookcases, constructed a back studio for his youngest daughter May's artwork, and installed a rustic fence around the property.<ref name=Saxton218 /> He also moved a smaller tenant house to adjoin the rear of the main house, making a single larger structure.<ref name="refsheet" /> While the home was being renovated, the family rented rooms next door at The Wayside while the Hawthornes were living in England.<ref>Matteson, John. ''Eden's Outcasts: The Story of Louisa May Alcott and Her Father''. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2007: 238. {{ISBN|978-0-393-33359-6}}</ref> Later, [[Lydia Maria Child]] visited the house and recorded her thoughts: "The result is a house full of queer nooks and corners and all manner of juttings in and out. It seems as if the spirit of some old architect had brought it from the Middle Ages and dropped it down in Concord...The whole house leaves a general impression of harmony, of a medieval sort."<ref>Saxton, Martha. ''Louisa May Alcott: A Modern Biography''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1995: 337. {{ISBN|0-374-52460-2}}</ref>

Orchard House is adjacent to The Wayside on the historic "American Mile" roadway toward [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], and is less than a half-mile from [[Ralph Waldo Emerson House|Bush]], the home of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]],<ref>[http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=399+lexington+rd+concord+ma&daddr=28+Cambridge+Turnpike&geocode=&hl=en&mra=ls&sll=42.458315,-71.34064&sspn=0.00828,0.01339&ie=UTF8&ll=42.458516,-71.338563&spn=0.008279,0.01339&t=h&z=16 Lexington Rd, Google Maps]</ref> where [[Henry David Thoreau]] and the Alcotts were frequent visitors.

==The Alcotts in Residence==
Orchard House was the most permanent home of the Alcotts, with the family in residence from 1858 to 1877.<ref name="refsheet" /> During this period, the family included [[Amos Bronson Alcott|Bronson]], his wife [[Abby May|Abigail May]], and their daughters [[Anna Alcott Pratt|Anna]], [[Louisa May Alcott|Louisa]], and [[Abigail May Alcott Nieriker|May]].<ref name="refsheet" /> [[Elizabeth Sewall Alcott|Elizabeth]], the model for [[Little Women#Characters|Beth March]], had died in March 1858, just weeks before the family moved in.<ref name="refsheet" />

The Alcott girls befriended the Hawthorne children, who lived next door, though Nathaniel Hawthorne himself was elusive. Bronson Alcott was disappointed, and recorded: "Nobody gets a chance to speak with him unless by accident." However, he added, "Still he has a tender kindly side, and a voice that a woman might own, the hesitance is so taking, and the tones so remote from what you expected."<ref>Saxton, Martha. ''Louisa May Alcott: A Modern Biography''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1995: 237–238. {{ISBN|0-374-52460-2}}</ref>

The Alcotts were [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]], and harvested fruits and vegetables from the gardens and orchard on the property.<ref name="dr">[http://www.louisamayalcott.org/diningroom.html The Dining Room] at the official site</ref> Conversations about [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], [[women's suffrage]], and [[social reform]] were often held around the dining room table.<ref name="dr" /> The family performed [[theatricals]] using the dining room as their stage while guests watched from the adjoining [[parlor]].<ref name="dr" />

The parlor was a formal room with arched niches built by Bronson to display [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] of his favorite philosophers, [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]].<ref name="parlor">[http://www.louisamayalcott.org/parlor.html The Parlor] at the official site</ref> On May 23, 1860, Anna married John Bridge Pratt in this room.<ref name="parlor" />

The youngest daughter, May, was a talented [[artist]].<ref>[http://www.louisamayalcott.org/maytext.html May] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207205218/http://www.louisamayalcott.org/maytext.html |date=2016-12-07 }} at the official site</ref> Her bedroom contains sketches of [[angel]]ic, [[mythological]], and [[biblical]] figures on the [[woodwork]] and doors.<ref>[http://www.louisamayalcott.org/mayroom.html May's Room] at the official site</ref> In Louisa's room, May painted a [[panel painting|panel]] of [[Zantedeschia aethiopica|calla lilies]] as well as an owl on the fireplace.<ref>[http://www.louisamayalcott.org/louisaroom.html Louisa's Room] at the official site</ref> Copies of [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] landscapes by May adorn various rooms in Orchard House.

In 1868, Louisa May Alcott wrote her beloved classic novel, ''[[Little Women]],'' in her room on a special "shelf desk" built by her father.<ref name="refsheet" /> Set within the house,<ref name="refsheet" /> its characters are based on members of her family, with the plot loosely based on the family's earlier years and events that transpired at The Wayside. Also written in the house were Bronson Alcott's ''Ralph Waldo Emerson'' (1865; published 1882), ''Tablets'' (1868), ''Concord Days'' (1872), and ''Table Talk'' (1877).<ref name="concord" />

On the grounds to the west of the house is a structure designed and built by Bronson Alcott originally known as "Hillside Chapel," and later as "[[The Concord School of Philosophy]]." Operating from 1879 to 1888, the School was one of the first highly successful [[adult education]] centers in the country.

In 1877, Louisa May Alcott bought [[Thoreau-Alcott House|a home on Main Street]] for her sister Anna. After Mrs. Alcott's death in the same year, Louisa and her father moved into the home as well. The Alcott family were officially moved out of Orchard House by November 14th.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Alcott|first=Louisa May|title=The Annotated Little Women|publisher=W. W.

The exterior looks much as it did in the Alcotts' day. Care has been taken to keep extensive structural preservation work invisible. All of the furnishings are original to the mid-nineteenth century - with roughly 75% belonging to the Alcott family - and the rooms look very much as they did when the Alcotts were in residence.<ref name="refsheet" />

Orchard House has continued the tradition of Mr. Alcott's Concord School of Philosophy by hosting "The Summer Conversational Series" since 1977, and has recently added a "Teacher Institute" component. The Hillside Chapel is also used for youth programs, poetry readings, [[historical reenactment]]s, and other special events.
