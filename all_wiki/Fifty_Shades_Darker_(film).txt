==Plot==
<!-- A plot summary is usually 400-700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT. -->
After Anastasia Steele leaves Christian Grey, he has nightmares about his abusive childhood. Meanwhile, Ana begins a new job as an assistant to Jack Hyde, an editor at Seattle Independent Publishing (SIP) whose previous three assistants all quit within the last 18 months. Ana unexpectedly runs into Christian at the opening of her friend Jose Rodriguez's photography exhibit. She is dismayed that Christian bought all of Jose's portraits of Ana. Christian wants Ana back and agrees to her no rules, no punishments, and no more secret terms. Christian also tells Ana that his birth mother was a crack-addicted prostitute.

As Jack and Ana head for an after-work drink, Ana is approached on the street by a young woman resembling her. Christian arrives at the bar and acts coolly towards Jack, then quickly departs with Ana in tow. Ana dismisses Christian's warning about Jack's reputation. She is annoyed that Christian is considering buying SIP. Jack tells Ana he expects her to accompany him on a New York book expo trip, but after speaking with Christian, she agrees not to attend.

Shortly after, Ana again notices the same woman observing her and Christian from a distance. Christian deflects Ana's inquiry about the woman's identity, but later admits she is Leila Williams, a former submissive. After their contract ended, Leila wanted more, but Christian ended the relationship. Leila married a man who later died, causing Leila to have a mental breakdown. She has been stalking Ana and Christian ever since.

Prior to the Grey family's annual charity ball, Christian takes Ana to Escala, a beauty salon owned by Elena Lincoln. Elena, a family friend, is also Christian's former dominant who introduced him to the [[BDSM]] lifestyle by seducing him when he was younger. Ana is furious that Christian took her there and that Elena and Christian are business partners. At the ball, Christian's sister Mia mentions that her brother was expelled from four different schools for brawling. Christian tells Ana that his mother committed suicide. He was alone with her body for three days before being taken to the hospital where Grace Trevelyan Grey worked; she cared for and later adopted the young boy. During the ball, Ana rebuffs Elena's demand that she leave Christian and warns Elena to stay away. Arriving home, she and Christian discover Leila has vandalized Ana's car.

When Ana tells Jack she won't be attending the expo with him, he attempts to seduce her while they are alone at work, but she evades him and escapes. Christian exerts his influence to have Jack fired, and Ana is promoted to acting editor in Jack's place. Christian asks Ana to move in with him and she agrees.

At Ana's apartment, Leila threatens her with a gun. Christian and his driver/bodyguard, Jason Taylor, enter and Christian controls Leila by becoming her dominant. Ana, seeing Christian's need to be dominant, leaves, returning hours later. Christian is furious but Ana needs time to consider their relationship. Christian submissively drops to his knees and confesses that he is not a dominant, but a sadist who enjoys hurting women who looked like his birth mother. He insists he wants to change. Christian later proposes but Ana needs time before accepting.

Christian leaves on a business trip, piloting his own helicopter. An engine failure occurs over Mt. St. Helens, forcing him to ditch the craft in a heavily forested area. A massive search and rescue ensues. As Ana fearfully awaits news, Christian arrives home safely. Ana, realizing she loves him, accepts his marriage proposal.

At Christian's birthday party, Elena accuses Ana of being a gold digger. Ana orders her to stop interfering. Christian overhears and dismissively tells Elena that she taught him "how to fuck" <!-- Do not change or remove this part. Wikipedia is not censored (see WP:CENSORED) and this part is essential to the film and book series. Please take it to the talk page if you have concerns. --> while Ana taught him "how to love". Grace overhears the conversation and demands Elena leave for good; Christian also cuts all ties with Elena. Later that evening, Christian proposes to Ana, this time with a ring, and she accepts. As fireworks erupt in the sky, Jack Hyde watches the festivities from afar, silently swearing revenge against Christian and Ana.

In the United States and Canada, ''Fifty Shades Darker'' opened alongside two other sequels, ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' and ''[[John Wick: Chapter 2]]'', and was projected to gross $32–40 million in its opening weekend.<ref name="DEADproj">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/01/fifty-shades-darker-lego-batman-box-office-projection-1201894855/|title=‘Fifty Shades Darker’ Poised To Submit To ‘Lego Batman’: Pre-Valentine’s Day Weekend B.O.

===Critical response===
Much like its predecessor, ''Fifty Shades Darker'' received negative reviews from critics, who criticized its screenplay, narrative and Dornan's and Johnson's performance.<ref name=reviews>{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/02/10/fifty_shades_darker_review_roundup_critics_deliver_a_brutal_flogging_plus.html |title=Here's What Critics Have to Say About Fifty Shades Darker |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|access-date=February 10, 2017}}</ref> On [[review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 12% based on 197 reviews, with an average rating of 3.23/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Lacking enough chemistry heat or narrative friction to satisfy, the limp ''Fifty Shades Darker'' wants to be kinky but only serves as its own form of punishment."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fifty_shades_darker |title=Fifty Shades Darker (2017)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=May 5, 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 33 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/fifty-shades-darker |title=Fifty Shades Darker Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|access-date=May 5, 2020}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, an improvement over the "C+" earned by its predecessor, while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it an 82% overall positive score and a 68% "definite recommend".<ref name=weekend/>

[[Richard Roeper]] gave the film two out of four stars, saying: "This is one good-looking, occasionally titillating, mostly soapy and dull snooze-fest."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/fifty-shades-darker-a-little-better-but-still-dull-dumb/ |title='Fifty Shades Darker' a little better but still dull, dumb |website=Chicago Sun Times |access-date=February 10, 2017}}</ref> Vince Mancini of ''[[Uproxx]]'' acknowledged the film's flaws, but said watching the film was enjoyable, noting, "Narrative sloppiness aside, as an outsider, sitting through ''Fifty Shades Darker'' was a reasonably diverting experience, odd, dumb fun made even more fun by an audience that whooped and shouted at the screen during sex scenes. I didn't really get it, but I enjoyed the feeling of them having fun, though at two hours plus, it's a bit of a slog."<ref>{{cite web |last=Mancini|first=Vince|url=http://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/fifty-shades-darker-review/3/ |title=An Outsider Attempts To Understand 'Fifty Shades Darker' |website=Uproxx |date=February 9, 2017|access-date=February 10, 2017}}</ref>

[[Manohla Dargis]] writing for ''The New York Times'' expressed similar ambiguous opinions regarding the content of the film, stating:

<blockquote>I was still rooting for Ms. Johnson in ''Fifty Shades Darker'', even if it proved tough going. Once again, the story involves the on-and-off, tie-her-up, tie-her-down romance between Anastasia Steele (Ms. Johnson) and her billionaire boyfriend, Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), a guy with sculptured muscles, expensive playthings and dreary issues. Stuff and kink happens: A gun is fired, a would-be rapist is punished and Anastasia is bound hand and foot. Mostly, she advances and retreats (repeat), mewls and moans, and registers surprise each time Christian tries to dominate her outside the bedroom, evincing the kind of stalkerlike behavior that usually leads to restraining orders.<ref>Manohla Dargis. The New York Times, Feb 9, 2017. [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/movies/review-fifty-shades-darker-dakota-johnson.html?_r=0].</ref>
</blockquote>

Richard Brody of ''The New Yorker'' described the film as inferior to the first, and found fault in the change in directors, stating:

<blockquote>Some of the greatest Hollywood melodramas (such as [[Douglas Sirk]]'s [[Magnificent Obsession (1954 film)|''Magnificent Obsession'']]) featured plotlines of an even more extravagant absurdity than that of ''Fifty Shades Darker''. Their extreme artifice became a framework for extreme ideas and extreme emotions, even in an era of extreme public reticence about what goes on in the bedroom. The freedom of the current age of sexual explicitness invites realms of characterization—and of intimate imagination—that the first film in the ''Fifty Shades'' series hints at and the second one utterly ignores. ''Fifty Shades Darker''{{'}}s indifference to its characters' identities, conflicts, and desires is matched by its indifference to its own cinematic substance. The film's bland impersonality is grotesque; its element of pornography isn't in its depiction of sex but in its depiction of people, of relationships, of situations that, for all their unusualness, bear a strong psychological and societal resonance. There's nothing wrong with ''Fifty Shades Darker'' that a good director couldn't fix.<ref>Richard Brody, ''The New Yorker'', Feb 9, 2017.
