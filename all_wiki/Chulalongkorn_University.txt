Chulalongkorn University is one of the National Research Universities and supported by the Office of Nation Education Standards and Quality Assessment of Thailand. Moreover, CU is the only Thai university which is a member of [[Association of Pacific Rim Universities]] (APRU).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apru.org/members/member-universities|title=Association of Pacific Rim Universities - Member Universities|website=apru.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904181952/http://apru.org/members/member-universities|archive-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Admission to CU is highly selective, and applicants are required to have high test scores. Applicants ranking in the top 10 national scores are chosen for study at CU.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chula.ac.th/en/archive/857|title=Top Admission Score Students Apply to Chulalongkorn University|access-date=2017-09-19}}</ref>

[[File:Chulalongkorn University Auditorium High View.JPG|250px|thumb|Chulalongkorn University]]

CU is composed of nineteen faculties, a School of Agriculture, three colleges, ten institutes and two other schools. Its campus occupies a vast area in downtown [[Bangkok]]. Graduates customarily receive their diplomas from the [[Monarchy of Thailand|King of Thailand]], a tradition begun by King [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII).

==Budget==
Thailand's national budget for [[Fiscal year|FY2019]] allocated 5,535 million [[Thai baht|baht]] to the university.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thailand's Budget in Brief Fiscal Year 2019 |url=http://www.bb.go.th/en/topic-detail.php?id=8562&mid=456&catID=0 |website=Bureau of the Budget|page=92 |date=20 December 2018|access-date=28 November 2019 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:King Chulalongkorn as Field Marshal.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The university was named after King Chulalongkorn]]
[[File:CUMonument56.JPG|thumbnail|right|200px|Statues of King Chulalongkorn and King Vajiravudh]]

King Chulalongkorn's reforms, aimed at transforming Thai society into a modern state demanded trained officials specialized in various fields. In 1899, the King founded the "Civil Service Training School"<ref>{{lang-th|โรงเรียนสำหรับฝึกหัดวิชาข้าราชการฝ่ายพลเรือน}}</ref> near the north gate of the [[Grand Palace, Bangkok|Royal Palace]]. Those who graduated from the school would become royal pages. As royal pages, they learned how to manage organizations by working closely with the king, which was a traditional way to enter the Siamese bureaucracy. After serving as royal pages, they would then serve in the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Mahattai Ministry]] or other government ministries.

On 1 April 1902 the King renamed the school. It became the "Royal Pages School" ({{lang-th|โรงเรียนมหาดเล็ก}}).<ref>ราชกิจจานุเบกษา, [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2445/001/16.PDF พระบรมราชโองการประกาศตั้งโรงเรียนมหาดเล็ก]. เล่ม ๑๙, ตอน ๑, ๖ เมษายน พ.ศ.๒๔๔๕, หน้า ๑๖ (Royal Order to establish Royal Page School)</ref> On 1 January 1911, King Vajiravudh changed the name to "Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn" ({{lang-th|โรงเรียนข้าราชการพลเรือนของพระบาทสมเด็จพระจุลจอมเกล้าเจ้าอยู่หัว}}) as a memorial to his father and moved the school to [[Windsor Palace (Thailand)|Windsor Palace]] ({{lang-th|วังวินด์เซอร์ หรือวังใหม่}}) in the Pathumwan District.<ref>ราชกิจจานุเบกษา, [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2453/A/123.PDF พระบรมราชโองการประกาศตั้งโรงเรียนข้าราชการพลเรือนฯ ], เล่ม ๒๗, ตอน ก, ๑๑ มกราคม พ.ศ.๒๔๕๔, หน้า ๑๒๓ (Royal Order to establish the Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn)</ref>

The King subsidized the construction of a university campus and organized various schools around the city into Chulalongkorn. The college offered eight majors taught by five schools including;

* School of International Relations in the Royal Palace
* [[Faculty of Education, Chulalongkorn University|School of Teacher Training at Baan Somdet Chao Phraya]]
* [[Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University|Royal Medical College]] at Siriraj Hospital
* School of Legal Studies
* School of Mechanical Sciences at Windsor Palace

[[File:Main auditorium of Chulalongkorn University IMG 0338.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Chulalongkorn University Auditorium]]

King Rama VI realized that education should be provided not only to bureaucrats, but to all people. On 26 March 1917, the college was upgraded to "Chulalongkorn University" ({{lang-th|จุฬาลงกรณ์มหาวิทยาลัย}}),<ref>ราชกิจจานุเบกษา, [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2460/A/20.PDF พระบรมราชโองการ ประกาศประดิษฐานโรงเรียนข้าราชการพลเรือนของพระบาทสมเด็จพระจุลจอมเกล้าเจ้าอยู่หัวขึ้นเป็นโรงเรียนข้าราชการพลเรือน], เล่ม ๒๗, ตอน ก, ๑๕ เมษายน พ.ศ.๒๔๖๐ (ประกาศเมื่อวันที่ ๒๖ มีนาคม พ.ศ.๒๔๖๐, หน้า ๑๒๓ (Royal Order to establish the Civil Service College of King Chulalongkorn.)</ref> and the schools were transformed into four faculties: Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Faculty of Public Administration, Faculty of Engineering, and Faculty of Medicine.

The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] reorganized the curriculum of the Faculty of Medicine. In 1923, the Faculty of Medicine became the first faculty to accept secondary school ([[Mattayom]]) graduates. The remaining faculties then followed suit. After the [[Siamese Revolution of 1932|1932 Revolution]], the [[Khana Ratsadon|People's Party]] wanted legal and political studies to be independent of "royalists" so they moved the Faculty of Law and Political Science to the new [[Thammasat University]] in 1933.

In 1938, Chulalongkorn University's Preparatory School was founded to provide pre-collegiate education to students. Those who managed to enter the university had to spend two years in the [[University-preparatory school|Preparatory School]] before going on to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The Preparatory School, however, ceased to be a university-owned preparatory school in 1947 and became the independent [[Triam Udom Suksa School]]. Later, the university established Chulalongkorn University Demonstration School (CUD) as a laboratory school for primary and secondary education for the Faculty of Education.

== Symbols ==
===Phra Kiao===
{{main|Phra Kiao}}
[[File:Prakiow.jpg|thumbnail|280px|Pra Kiao model, CU Museum]]
Since the establishment of the Royal Pages School, the former name of the university, King Chulalongkorn authorized the use of his personal emblem as a school emblem.<ref>[http://www.chula.ac.th/about/symbol_prakew/index.htm About Phra Kiao by Chulalongkorn Memorial Hall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607024401/http://www.chula.ac.th/about/symbol_prakew/index.htm |date=June 7, 2011 }}</ref> The emblem is called ''Phra Kiao'', a Thai [[coronet]], royal headgear for young princes and princesses. As the school was transformed into the university, the King authorized the use of ''phra kiao''. Today, ''phra kiao'' appears not only in formal letters and transcripts, but also on souvenirs made by the university as well as student uniforms.

===Student uniform===
Undergraduates are required to wear a uniform when studying, taking examinations, or contacting the university in person. Male graduate students wear a collared or polo shirt and dark trousers. Women wear a plain blouse with long skirt.

Originally, the university uniform was adapted from a uniform worn by Chulalongkorn's heirs.<ref>[http://www.discipline.studentaffairs.chula.ac.th/nisit_intro.html History about CU uniform.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520023903/http://www.discipline.studentaffairs.chula.ac.th/nisit_intro.html |date=20 May 2010 }}</ref> The uniform was later updated, but the original is reserved as a formal uniform. The formal uniform is usually worn by student leaders and graduates.

Today, the ordinary uniform for male undergraduate students consists of a plain white shirt with long or short sleeves and black (or dark blue) trousers. Wearing a dark blue necktie with colored ''phra kiao'' engraved on its front is mandatory for first-year students but optional for higher years. However, a black tie with a silver ''phra kiao'' pin is usually used by upperclass student in some faculties. Female students are required to wear a short-sleeved blouse with a fold along the spine. The buttons must be made of metal, and a small ''phra kiao'' emblem must be pinned on the right breast. A dark blue or black pleated skirt with any black, white, or brown shoes are worn. For female first-year students, white leather shoes are mandatory.<ref>ราชกิจจานุเบกษา, [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2553/E/052/25.PDF ข้อบังคับจุฬาฯ ว่าด้วยเครื่องแบบ เครื่องหมาย และเครื่องแต่งกายนิสิต พ.ศ.๒๕๕๓], เล่ม ๑๒๗, ตอนพิเศษ ๕๒ ง, ๒๖ เมษายน พ.ศ.๒๕๕๓ (The university regulation on uniform and dress codes, 2010)</ref> Chulalongkorn University's uniforms have long been the template of many uniforms used in other universities in Thailand.

=== Academic dress ===
{{main|Suea khrui|Academic dress of Chulalongkorn University}}

The [[academic dress]] of Chulalongkorn University is based on ceremonial attire called ''suea krui'', which is long-sleeved robe made of very fine mesh. Like dresses worn in [[Academic dress in the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], the robe is open-fronted and calf-length. [[Square academic cap|Cap]] and hood, however, are omitted. A colored [[felt]] strip decorated with gold-colored ribbons is attached to the margin of the gown including elbow and wrist. Bachelors and masters students wear a black strip, while [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]] and pink are for PhDs (including honorary degrees recipients) and lecturers. A yellow strip is specially used for the king of Thailand.<ref>ราชกิจจานุเบกษา.[http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2473/A/92.PDF พระราชกำหนดเสื้อครุยบัณฑิตของจุฬาลงกรณ์มหาวิทยาลัย พ.ศ.๒๔๗๓]. เล่ม ๔๗, ๖ กรกฎาคม ๒๔๗๓. (Regulation on Chulalongkorn University Graduation Gown, 1930)</ref>

In addition, the colored yarn (bachelor) or ribbon (master and doctor) is added to the center of the strip longitudinally, according to degree-granting faculty.<ref>ราชกิจจานุเบกษา.[http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2553/E/052/20.PDF ข้อบังคับจุฬาฯ ว่าด้วยการกำหนดปริญญาในสาขาวิชา อักษรย่อสำหรับสาขาวิชา ครุยวิทยฐานะ เข็มวิทยฐานะ และครุยประจำตำแหน่ง พ.ศ.๒๕๕๓].เล่ม ๑๒๗ ตอนพิเศษ ๕๒ ง, ๒๖ เมษายน ๒๕๕๓.

===Rain Trees===
[[File:RaintreeCU.JPG|150px|thumbnail|Rain Tree near CU Auditorium]]

[[Albizia saman|Rain tree]]s are common on the university campus. They are associated with the cycle of student life. Fresh green leaves at beginning of the term represent the freshmen's naivete. As the tree produces slimy pods and sheds leaves, the ground beneath it becomes slippery, thus alerting students to prepare for examinations. If they walk carefully, they will not slip (pass examinations). If they walk heedlessly, they will slip and fall (fail examinations).<ref>[http://www.chula.ac.th/about/symbol_prakew/relatelink/symbol_chamjuree/index.htm Rain Tree-The Symbol of Chulalongkorn University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607083703/http://www.chula.ac.th/about/symbol_prakew/relatelink/symbol_chamjuree/index.htm |date=June 7, 2011 }}</ref>

From 1937–1957, many rain trees were cut down to free space for new buildings. King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] noticed the dramatic decrease in the number of rain trees. On 15 January 1962, he brought five trees from [[Hua Hin]] and planted them in front of the university auditorium, proclaiming: "...I give these five trees as an eternal memorial." ({{Lang-th|จึงขอฝากต้นไม้ไว้ห้าต้นให้เป็นเครื่องเตือนใจตลอดกาล}}).

Chulalongkorn University consists of 19 faculties, three colleges, one school and many institutes which function as teaching and research units.<ref name="fac1">ราชกิจจานุเบกษา, [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2553/E/016/70.PDF ประกาศจุฬาลงกรณ์มหาวิทยาลัย เรื่อง ส่วนงานของมหาวิทยาลัย พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๒], เล่ม ๑๒๗, ตอนพิเศษ ๑๖ ง, ๑ กุมภาพันธ์ พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๓, หน้า ๗๐ (University notification (rather command) on academic units, 2008)</ref><ref name="fac2">ราชกิจจานุเบกษา, [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2557/E/049/2.PDF ประกาศจุฬาลงกรณ์มหาวิทยาลัย เรื่อง ส่วนงานของมหาวิทยาลัย (ฉบับที่ ๒) พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๗], เล่ม ๑๓๑, ตอนพิเศษ ๔๙ ง, ๑๘ มีนาคม พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๗, หน้า ๓ (Amendment to 2008 regulation, ratified 2014)</ref>

In 1917, the university had four faculties: Arts and Sciences, Public Administration, Engineering, and Medicine. The Faculty of Law was established in 1933 as part of the Faculty of Law and Political Science.<ref>[http://www.law.chula.ac.th www.law.chula.ac.th] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829065254/http://www.law.chula.ac.th/ |date=August 29, 2011 }}</ref> From the 1930s to the 1950s it expanded to various fields including Pharmacy (1934), Veterinary Science (1935), Architecture (1939), Dentistry (1940), and Commerce and Accountancy (1943). In 1943, the regency government under General [[Phibun]] separated the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Veterinary Science to become the University of Medical Sciences, now [[Mahidol University]]. In 1948, the Faculty of Political Science was re-established. The Faculty of Education was established in 1957 from the School of Teacher Training at Baan Somdet Chao Phraya ({{lang-th|โรงเรียนฝึกหัดครู บ้านสมเด็จเจ้าพระยา}}).<ref>[http://www.edu.chula.ac.th/ Faculty of Education, Chulalongkorn University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904113033/http://www.edu.chula.ac.th/ |date=September 4, 2011 }}</ref> In 1967, the Faculty of Veterinary Science was returned from [[Kasetsart University]] and the [[Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University|Faculty of Medicine]] at [[King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital|Chulalongkorn Hospital]] was moved from [[Mahidol University|University of Medical Sciences]] to Chulalongkorn University. In 1972, the Faculty of Dentistry and Faculty of Pharmacy were reinstated.

The Office of the Commission on Agricultural Resource Education (OCARE) was established in 2009.<ref>[http://www.ocare.chula.ac.th/index.php/about-us/history.html Principles and history of establishing OCARE.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305193816/http://www.ocare.chula.ac.th/index.php/about-us/history.html |date=March 5, 2011 }}</ref> It is not an administrative office, but a school in which teaching and research are carried out. It admits students from two groups: one from northern Thai provinces ([[Nan Province|Nan]], [[Phayao Province|Phayao]], [[Phrae Province|Phrae]], [[Uttaradit Province|Uttaradit]]) and another from the rest of country. It was upgraded to the School of Agricultural Resources with full degree-granting power on 5 March 2014.<ref name="fac2"/> In 2014 it became the School of Agriculture, Chulalongkorn University (SAR).
