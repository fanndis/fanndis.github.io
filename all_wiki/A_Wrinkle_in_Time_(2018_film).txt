==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->
Thirteen-year-old [[Meg Murry]] struggles to adjust at school, four years after the disappearance of her father Alex, a renowned [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]]. Meg and her [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] younger brother [[Charles Wallace Murry|Charles Wallace]] are sent to the principal after Charles scolds a pair of gossiping teachers, and Meg retaliates against Veronica, her bullying next-door neighbor. Meg and her mother Kate discover Charles with an unusual visitor, Mrs. Whatsit, who claims that the tesseract – a method of space travel Alex was studying – is real.

Meg and Charles meet her classmate [[Calvin O'Keefe]], who joins them at the house of Mrs. Who, another strange friend of Charles who speaks only in quotations. Calvin has dinner with the Murrys, and Kate remembers Alex’s commitment to their research despite public ridicule. In the backyard, Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Who appear with Mrs. Which, revealing themselves as astral travelers. Explaining that they have come to help find Alex, who has transported himself across the universe, the Misses lead Meg, Calvin, and Charles through a tesseract to the distant planet Uriel.

The planet’s sentient flowers confirm that Alex visited Uriel, and Mrs. Whatsit transforms into a flying creature, carrying the children into the sky. Calvin nearly falls to his death after noticing a dark planet that Mrs. Which identifies as Camazotz, home to an evil energy known as “the IT”. They [[teleportation|tesser]] to the planet Orion to seek the help of a seer named Happy Medium. Mrs. Which reveals that the IT spreads negativity throughout the universe, including on Earth: Charles’ gossiping teachers were jealous of the principal’s promotion; Veronica judges herself for her weight; the Murrys’ kindly neighbor is mugged; and Calvin’s father is an abusive [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]].

Happy Medium helps Meg overcome her self-doubt, and they learn that her father tessered to Uriel, then Ixchel, but was trapped on Camazotz. The Misses insist they regroup on Earth, but Meg’s determination to save her father overrides the tesseract, unintentionally redirecting them to Camazotz. Unable to stay, as Camazotz's evil is stronger than their light, the Misses bestow gifts before departing: Mrs. Who gives Meg her glasses to see what is really there, Mrs. Whatsit gives Meg the knowledge of her faults, and Mrs. Which gives the children the command to never separate.

A forest appears, separating Meg and Calvin from Charles, and they are pursued by a tornado-like storm. Meg uses the storm’s own force to [[gravity assist|slingshot]] her and Calvin atop a cliff wall, where they reunite with Charles. They find themselves in a neighborhood of look-alike homes, children, and mothers; one woman invites them inside but Meg declines, reminding Calvin and Charles not to trust anyone. Their surroundings transform into a crowded beach, where a man introduces himself as Red, assuring them Alex is safe, and offers them food. When Charles says it tastes like sand, Red hypnotizes him and reveals himself to be a puppet of the IT.

Meg and Calvin pursue Red and Charles through the crowd, but are trapped in a seemingly empty, spherical room. Red deactivates while Charles, his mind taken over by the IT, taunts Meg and Calvin. Using Mrs. Who's glasses, Meg finds an invisible staircase to another room where her father is imprisoned. After a tearful reunion, they are dragged by Charles to meet his master. As Calvin and Meg fall under the IT's power, Alex opens a tesseract to escape with the two of them. Refusing to abandon Charles, Meg projects back to Camazotz and confronts the IT in its malevolent, [[neuron]]-like form.

Charles and the IT try to force Meg to give in to darkness, menacing her with an idealized version of herself, but Meg embraces her own imperfections and uses her love for her brother to free him. The IT dissipates as the Misses reappear, congratulating Meg and Charles on becoming “warriors of light”, and Meg tessers them home. Alex is reunited with his family, and Calvin leaves to confront his father, as Meg looks to the sky, thanking the Misses.

In October 2010, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] retained the film rights for the 1962 novel ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]'', by [[Madeleine L'Engle]], which had previously been made as a [[A Wrinkle in Time (2003 film)|2003 television film]]. Following the financial success of [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (2010), Disney hired Jeff Stockwell to write the screenplay for [[Cary Granat]] and his new [[Bedrock Studios]].

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 42% based on 331 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 5.31/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''A Wrinkle in Time'' is visually gorgeous, big-hearted, and occasionally quite moving; unfortunately, it's also wildly ambitious to a fault, and often less than the sum of its classic parts."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_wrinkle_in_time_2018|title=A Wrinkle in Time (2018)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=August 25, 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film earned a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-wrinkle-in-time|title=A Wrinkle in Time Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|access-date=April 4, 2018}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it a 75% overall positive score; audience members under age 18 gave it an average grade of "A-" and a positive score of 89%.<ref name="opening" />

[[Alonso Duralde]] of ''[[TheWrap]]'' praised the film's visuals and performances, writing, "Awash in bold colors, bright patterns and ebullient kids, director Ava DuVernay's new take on 'A Wrinkle in Time' dazzles its way across time and space even if it doesn't quite stick the landing."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/a-wrinkle-in-time-film-review-oprah-winfrey-ava-duvernay-2018/|title='A Wrinkle in Time' Film Review: Oprah Hitchhikes the Galaxy in Trippy Kiddie Treat|first=Alonso|last=Durande|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=March 7, 2018|access-date=March 7, 2018}}</ref> David Ehrlich of [[IndieWire]] gave the film a "C+" and praised what he described as its ambition, saying: "It almost doesn't matter that the movie is too emotionally prescriptive to have any real power, or too high on imagination to leave any room for wonder; DuVernay evinces such faith in who she is and what she's doing that 'A Wrinkle in Time' remains true to itself even when everything on screen reads false."<ref>{{cite web |last=Ehrlich |first=David |date=March 7, 2018|title='A Wrinkle in Time' Review: Ava DuVernay's Eye-Popping Spectacle Proves that a Little Imagination Can Go a Long Way|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/03/a-wrinkle-in-time-review-ava-duvernay-oprah-1201936784/|website=[[IndieWire]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|access-date=March 7, 2018}}</ref> [[Jamie Broadnax]], a freelance writer and member of the ''Critic's Choice Awards,'' tweeted that after seeing the film for the second time, she still was unable to conceptualize and take in the visuals displayed throughout the film and the numerous performances from various characters.<ref name=":0">Katz, Brandon.

Vince Mancini of ''[[Uproxx]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying, "...if anything, the trouble with 'Wrinkle' is that you never really get a sense of DuVernay's personal touch. In fact, it feels a lot like [[Brad Bird]]'s big-budget, equally smarmy 2015 Disney film ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]''.
