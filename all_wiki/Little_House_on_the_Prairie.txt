{{italic title}}
'''''The "Little House" Books''''' is a series of American children's novels written by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], based on her childhood and adolescence in the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]] (Wisconsin, Kansas, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Missouri) between 1870 and 1894.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prairie Fires|last=Fraser|first=Caroline|publisher=Metropolitan Book|year=2017|isbn=9781627792769|location=New York|pages=2}}</ref> Eight of the novels were completed by Wilder, and published by [[Harper & Brothers]]. The appellation "Little House" books comes from the first and third novels in the series of eight published in her lifetime.  The second novel was about her husband's childhood.  The first draft of a ninth novel was published posthumously in 1971 and is commonly included in the series.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Laura Ingalls Wilder: A Biography|last=Anderson|first=William|publisher=Harper Trophy|year=1992|isbn=978-0-06-020113-5|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780060201142/page/13 13]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780060201142|url-access=registration}}</ref>

The ''Little House'' books have been adapted for stage or screen more than once, most successfully as the American television series ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', which ran from 1974 to 1983.<ref name=":5">{{Citation|title=Little House on the Prairie|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071007/|others=Melissa Gilbert, Michael Landon, Karen Grassle|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}</ref> As well as an [[Laura, the Prairie Girl|anime]] and many spin-off books, there are cookbooks and various other licensed products representative of the books.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prairie Fires|last=Fraser|first=Caroline|publisher=Metropolitan Books|year=2017|isbn=|location=New York|pages=4}}</ref>

A tenth book, the non-fiction ''[[On the Way Home]]'', is Laura Ingalls Wilder's diary of the years after 1894, when she, her husband and their daughter moved from [[De Smet, South Dakota]] to [[Mansfield, Missouri]], where they settled permanently.  It was published in 1962 and includes commentary by Rose Wilder Lane.

Before writing the ''Little House'' series Laura Ingalls Wilder was a columnist in a farm journal.<ref name=":1" /> Her daughter, [[Rose Wilder Lane]], was the motivator behind Wilder's writing and publishing of the first book.<ref name=":0" /> Since the first book, there have been around 60 million ''Little House'' books sold.<ref name=":0" /> There are 9 books that fall under the ''Little House'' books umbrella.<ref>Wilder, Laura Ingalls. ''The Little House Books.'' U.S.A. : Harper & Row Publishers Inc., 1971.</ref>

Rose Wilder Lane had a heavy hand in the editing of the books, though Laura Ingalls Wilder's voice is still strong.<ref name=":1" />  It is contested the amount of influence that Lane had on the books, especially regarding any political themes, but views that align with hers are very visible within the books.<ref name=":0" />  Regardless, Rose Wilder Lane was a large part in the publishing and form of the books.  Lane also had a hand in giving the rights to [[Roger MacBride|Roger Lea MacBride]], who then led to the creation of the television show entitled ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]''.<ref name=":0" />

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' ranks the ''Little House'' series as 22 out of 100 of the "100 Best Young Adult Books of All Time."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/100-best-young-adult-books/|title=The 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time|website=TIME.com|access-date=April 11, 2018}}</ref>  They are considered classics of American [[children's literature]] and remain widely read. In a 2012 survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]'', a monthly with primarily U.S. audience, ''Little House in the Big Woods'' was ranked number 19 among all-time best children's novels, and two of its sequels were ranked among the top 100.<ref name="SLJChapter2012">{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/07/top-100-chapter-book-poll-results |title= Top 100 Chapter Book Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth |department= A Fuse #8 Production Blog (blog.schoollibraryjournal.com) |work= [[School Library Journal]] |date= July 7, 2012 |accessdate= October 31, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120713031015/http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/07/top-100-chapter-book-poll-results |archive-date= July 13, 2012 |url-status= dead }}</ref>  Five of the ''Little House'' book have been Honor Books for the [[Newbery Medal]].

===Depiction of minorities===
The ''Little House'' books include people from ethnic minorities, mainly [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].  There have been criticisms of the ''Little House'' books because of portrayals of Native Americans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/little-house-prairie-was-built-native-american-land-180962020/|title=The Little House on the Prairie Was Built on Native American Land|last=Eschner|first=Kat|work=Smithsonian|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en}}</ref>  Much of the criticism relates to the negative stereotyping as well as a view of them as less than human.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Smulders|first=Sharon|date=January 1, 2002|title='The Only Good Indian': History, Race, and Representation in Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House on the Prairie|url=|journal=Children's Literature Review Quarterly|volume=27| issue =  4|pages=191–202|via=}}</ref>  There has also been criticism of the ignorance present in the books of the illegality of the Ingalls' occupation of land they did not have the right to occupy.<ref name=":2" />  Wilder presents the land as "uninhabited," which it was not.<ref name=":1" />

An important moment concerning Wilder's depiction of Native Americans occurred in 1998, when an eight-year-old girl read ''Little House on the Prairie'' in her elementary school class.  The book contains the line, "The only good Indian is a dead Indian." The girl's mother, Waziyatawin Angela Cavender Wilson, a member of the Wahpetunwan Dakota nation, challenged the school on its use of the book in the classroom.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/yes-little-house-on-the-prairie-is-racially-insensitive--but-we-should-still-read-it/2018/03/12/8e021422-1e40-11e8-9de1-147dd2df3829_story.html|title=Perspective {{!}} Yes, 'Little House on the Prairie' is racially insensitive — but we should still read it|last=Fraser|first=Caroline|date=March 13, 2018|work=The Washington Post|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>  This action prompted the [[American Library Association]] to investigate and ultimately change the name of the [[Laura Ingalls Wilder Award|Wilder Award]] to the Children's Literature Legacy Award.<ref name=":3" />  This award is given to books that have made a large impact on children's literature in America.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/wildermedal|title=Welcome to the (Laura Ingalls) Wilder Award home page!|last=admin|date=November 30, 1999|publisher=Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC)|access-date=April 11, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

===Accuracy to history===
Laura Ingalls Wilder's work is [[autobiographical fiction]] and Wilder employed [[artistic licence]], including creating composite characters based on multiple real individuals<ref name=":2" />  and presenting a subjective view of her family's experiences.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Tharp|first=Julie|last2=Kleiman|first2=Jeff|date=2000|title="Little House on the Prairie" and the Myth of Self-Reliance|jstor=43587224|journal=Transformations: The Journal of Inclusive Scholarship and Pedagogy|volume=11|issue=1|pages=55–64}}</ref> It has been criticized regarding the history of the government's involvement in homesteading,<ref name=":4" /> and its effect upon Native American people,<ref name=":2" /> including her family's occupation of land which was still recognized by the United States government as the [[Osage Nation]]'s territory.<ref name=":2" />

====Connections with politics====
While Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote the ''Little House'' books, it was [[Rose Wilder Lane]] who edited them and it was Lane who had the rights after Wilder's death.  Rose was an "outspoken antigovernment polemicist and is called one of the grandmothers of the libertarian movement."<ref name=":0" />  Lane's views were supported by her mother.<ref name=":1" />  Despite her mother's support of her political views, Lane went against her mother and what was written in her will by leaving the rights of the ''Little House'' books to [[Roger MacBride|Roger Lea MacBride]] after her own death.<ref name=":1" />  Roger Lea MacBride has strong connections to politics, being a once [[List of third party performances in United States presidential elections|libertarian presidential candidate]], and a member of the [[Republican Liberty Caucus]].<ref name=":0" />  He gained the rights to the books not only from Lane's will but also through a legal battle with the library that Wilder wrote in her will should gain the rights after Lane's death.<ref name=":0" /> It was MacBride who allowed the [[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|television show]] to be made and who talked about Laura's books, and through the rights he made a great deal of money.<ref name=":0" />

Another political issue raised by the practice of homesteading as described in the ''Little House'' books is [[John Locke]]'s [[Labor theory of property|Labor Theory of Property]], which is the idea that if someone improves the land with their own labor that they then have rights to that land.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Lawrence C.|date=1976|title=The Labor Theory of Property Acquisition|jstor=2025823|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=73|issue=18|pages=653–664|doi=10.2307/2025823}}</ref>  

====Depiction of the United States Government====
Anti-governmental political views, such as those held by Rose Wilder Lane, have been attributed to the ''Little House'' books. In her article, "''Little House on the Prairie'' and the Truth About the American West", historian [[Patricia Nelson Limerick]] connects Wilder's apparent and Lane's outright distaste for the government as a way to blame the government for their father's failure at homesteading.<ref name=":1" />  The books show the Wilder family to be entrepreneurs and show a form of hero worship of Laura Ingalls Wilder's parents.<ref name=":4" /> In "''Little House on the Prairie'' and the Myth of Self Reliance", Julie Tharp and Jeff Kleiman say that the idea of the settlers' self-reliance, which they consider to be a myth, has contributed to conservative rhetoric, and that the ''Little House'' books are full of this myth.<ref name=":4" />

===''Little House in the Big Woods''===
{{main|Little House in the Big Woods}}
[[Image:1932-LittleHouseInTheBigWoods.jpg|thumb|right|150px| Front hardcover, first ed. of the first vol. (1932) <!-- book article displays dustjacket -->]]

Little House in the Big Woods was published in 1932. Written by Laura Ingalls Wilder, the book is autobiographical, though some parts of the story were embellished or changed to appeal more to an audience, such as Laura’s age. In the book, Laura herself turns five years old, when the real-life author had only been three during the events of the book.  According to a letter from her daughter, Rose, to biographer William Anderson, the publisher had Laura change her age in the book because it seemed unrealistic for a three-year-old to have specific memories such as she wrote about.<ref>Anderson, ''Laura Ingalls Wilder: The Iowa  Story'', pp. 1–2.</ref> The story of ''Little House in the Big Woods'', revolves around the life of the Ingalls family. The family includes mother Caroline Ingalls, father Charles Ingalls, elder daughter [[Mary Ingalls|Mary Amelia Ingalls]], and younger daughter (and protagonist), Laura Ingalls Wilder.<ref>Gormley, ''Laura Ingalls Wilder: Young Pioneer'', p. 36.</ref> Also in the story, though not yet born historically, is Laura's baby sister Carrie.

The setting of this book is different from the rest of the series, as the story takes place in the Ingall’s small cabin in the state of Wisconsin, near a town called Pepin''. Little House in the Big Woods'' describes the homesteading skills Laura observed and began to practice during her fifth year. The cousins come for Christmas that year, and Laura receives a doll, which she names Charlotte. Later that winter, the family goes to Grandma Ingalls’s and has a “sugaring off,” when they harvest sap and make [[maple syrup]]. They return home with buckets of syrup, enough to last the year. Laura remembered that sugaring off, and the dance that followed, for the rest of her life.<ref name=":6">{{Cite book|title=Little House in the Big Woods|last=Wilder|first=Laura Ingalls|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1932|isbn=0-06-440003-4|location=New York|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/farmerboy00wild_0}}</ref>

The book also describes other farm work duties and events, such as the birth of a calf, and the availability of [[milk]], [[butter]] and [[cheese]], gardening, field work, hunting, gathering, and more. Everyday housework is also described in detail. When Pa went into the woods to hunt, he usually came home with a deer then smoked the meat for the coming winter. One day he noticed a bee tree and returned from hunting early to get the wash tub and milk pail to collect the [[honey]]. When Pa returned in the winter evenings, Laura and Mary always begged him to play his [[fiddle]], as he was too tired from farm work to play during the summertime.<ref name=":6" /> Later in the series, the family moves away from Wisconsin to a homestead in Kansas, as territory in the West was being given to settlers, and then to Minnesota. This reflects the time period in the 1800s during which farmers and many others were migrating Westward into the American Frontier.

===''Farmer Boy''===
{{main|Farmer Boy}}''Farmer Boy'' was published in 1933, and is the second Little House book, although its story is unrelated to the first few books in the series. It features a different protagonist named Almanzo Wilder, who later became Laura’s husband. In ''Farmer Boy'', Almanzo is featured from before his ninth birthday until after his tenth. Throughout the novel, Laura recounts the experiences and adventures of Almanzo in his late childhood and adolescence. Living in a successful farm in the state of New York in the late 19th century, Almanzo endures hardships such as the long, {{convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on}} walk to school with his older siblings. Through Farmer Boy, readers catch a glimpse of the daily routine of early farmers, and learn about activities such as candle-making, shearing sheep, threshing wheat, and even making donuts. The story also walks readers through Almanzo’s favorite pastimes, which include sledding, berry picking, swimming, and fishing. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Farmer Boy|last=Wilder|first=Laura Ingalls|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1933|isbn=0-06-440002-6|location=New York|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/littlehouseonpra00wild_0}}</ref>

===''Little House on the Prairie''===
{{main|Little House on the Prairie (novel)}}

''Little House on the Prairie'', published in 1935, is the third book in the Little House series but only the second that features the Ingalls family; it continues directly the story of the inaugural novel, ''Little House in the Big Woods''.

The book tells about the months the Ingalls family spent on the prairie of Kansas, around the town of [[Independence, Kansas]]. At the beginning of this story, [[Charles Ingalls|Pa Ingalls]] decides to sell the house in the Big Woods of [[Wisconsin]], and move the family, via [[covered wagon]] to the [[Indian Territory]] near Independence, Kansas, as there were widely circulating stories that the land (under [[Osage Nation|Osage]] ownership) would be opened to settlement by homesteaders imminently. So Laura, along with Pa and [[Caroline Ingalls|Ma]], [[Mary Ingalls|Mary]], and baby [[Carrie Ingalls|Carrie]], move to [[Kansas]]. Along the way, Pa trades his two horses for two Western [[Mustang (horse)|mustangs]], which Laura and Mary name Pet and Patty.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|title=Little House on the Prairie|last=Wilder|first=Laura Ingalls|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1935|isbn=0-06-440004-2|location=New York|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/onbanksofplumcre00wild_0}}</ref>

[[Image:Caroline&CharlesIngalls.jpg|thumb|right| Caroline and Charles Ingalls]]

When the family reaches Indian Territory, they meet [[Mr. Edwards]], who is extremely polite to Ma, but tells Laura and Mary that he is "a wildcat from [[Tennessee]]." Mr. Edwards is an excellent neighbor, and helps the Ingalls in every way he can, beginning with helping Pa erect their house. Pa builds a roof and a floor for their house and digs a well, and the family is finally settled.<ref name=":7" />

At their new home, unlike their time in the Big Woods, the family meets difficulty and danger. The Ingalls family becomes terribly ill from a disease called at that time "[[malaria|fever 'n' ague]]" (fever with severe chills and shaking) which was later identified as [[malaria]]. Laura comments on the varied ways they believe to have acquired it, with "Ma" believing it came from eating bad watermelon. Mrs. Scott, another neighbor, takes care of the family while they are sick. Around this time,  Mr. Edwards brings Laura and Mary their Christmas presents from Independence, and in the spring, the Ingalls plant the beginnings of a small farm.<ref name=":7" />

Ma's fears about American Indians and Laura's observations at the time of them are contrasted with Pa's liberal view of them, and all these views are shown side by side with the older Laura's objective portrayal of the Osage tribe that lived on that land.<ref name=":2" />

At the end of this book, the family is told that the land must be vacated by settlers as it is not legally open to settlement yet, and in 1870 Pa elects to leave the land and move before the Army forcibly requires him to abandon the land.<ref name=":7" />

===''On the Banks of Plum Creek''===
{{main|On the Banks of Plum Creek}}

''On the Banks of Plum Creek'', published in 1937 and fourth in the series, follows the Ingalls family as they move from [[Pepin, Wisconsin]] to Kansas to an area near [[Walnut Grove, Minnesota]], and settle in a dugout "on the banks of [[Plum Creek (Redwood County, Minnesota)]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hoover.archives.gov/LIW/timeline/timeline.html|title=The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum|work=archives.gov|access-date=October 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025222424/http://www.hoover.archives.gov/LIW/timeline/timeline.html|archive-date=October 25, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Pa trades his horses Pet and Patty to the property owner (a man named Hanson) for the land and crops, but later gets two new horses as Christmas presents for the family, which Laura and her sister [[Mary Ingalls|Mary]] name "Sam" and "David". Pa soon builds a new, above-ground, wooden house for the family. During this story, Laura and Mary go to school for the first time in town where they meet their teacher, Miss Eva Beadle. They also meet [[Nellie Oleson]], who makes fun of Laura and Mary for being "country girls". Laura plays with her bulldog Jack when she is home, and she and Mary are invited to a party at the Olesons' home. Laura and Mary invite all the girls (including Nellie) to a party at their house to reciprocate. The family soon goes through hard times when a plague of [[Rocky Mountain locust]]s decimates their crops. The book ends with Pa returning safely to the house after being unaccounted for during a severe four-day [[blizzard]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilder |first=Laura Ingalls |year=1937 |title=On the Banks of Plum Creek |url=https://archive.org/details/onbanksofplumcre0000wild |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Harper & Row |isbn= |pages=}}</ref>

===''By the Shores of Silver Lake''===
{{main|By the Shores of Silver Lake}}

''By the Shores of Silver Lake'', published in 1939 and fifth in the series.

The story begins when the family is about to leave Plum Creek, shortly after the family has recovered from the [[scarlet fever]] which caused Mary to become blind. The family welcomes a visit from Aunt Docia, whom they had not seen for several years. She suggests that Pa and Ma move west to the rapidly developing Dakota Territory, where Pa could work in Uncle Henry’s railroad camp at very good wages for that era. Ma and Pa agree, since it will allow Pa to look for a homestead while he works. The family has endured many hardships on Plum Creek and Pa especially is anxious for a new start. After selling his land and farm to neighbors, Pa goes ahead with the wagon and team. Mary is still too weak to travel so the rest of the family follows later by train.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|title=On the Shores of Silver Lake|last=Wilder|first=Laura Ingalls|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1939|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>

The day Pa leaves, however, their beloved bulldog Jack is found dead, which saddens Laura greatly. In actuality, the dog upon whom Jack was based was no longer with the family at this point, but the author inserted his death here to serve as a transition between her childhood and her adolescence. Laura also begins to play a more mature role in the family due to Mary's blindness – Pa instructs Laura to "be Mary's eyes" and to assist her in daily life as she learns to cope with her disability. Mary is strong and willing to learn.<ref name=":8" />

The family travels to Dakota Territory by train – this is the children's first train trip and they are excited by the novelty of this new mode of transportation that allows them to travel in one hour the distance it would take a horse and wagon an entire day to cover.<ref name=":8" />

With the family reunited and situated at the railroad camp, Laura meets her cousin Lena, and the two become good friends.<ref name=":8" />

As winter approaches, and the railroad workers take down the cabins and head back East, the family wonders where they might stay for the winter. As luck would have it, the county surveyor needs a house-sitter while he is East for the winter, and Pa signs up. It is a winter of luxury for the Ingalls family as they are given all the provisions they need in the large, comfortable house. They spend a cozy winter with their new friends, Mr. and Mrs. Boast, and both families look forward to starting their new claims in the spring.<ref name=":8" />

But the "Spring Rush" comes early. The large mobilization of pioneers to the Dakotas in early March prompts Pa to leave immediately on the few days' trip to the claims office. The girls are left alone and spend their days and nights boarding and feeding all the pioneers passing through. They charge 25 cents for dinner and boarding, starting a savings account toward sending Mary to the School for the Blind in Vinton, Iowa.<ref name=":8" />

Pa successfully files his claim, with the aid of old friend Mr. Edwards. As the spring flowers bloom and the prairie comes alive with new settlers, the Ingalls family moves to their new piece of land and begins building what will become their permanent home.<ref name=":8" />

===''The Long Winter''===
{{main|The Long Winter (novel)}}

''The Long Winter'', published in 1940 and sixth in the series, covers the shortest timespan of the novels, only an eight-month period.  The winter of 1880–1881 was a notably severe winter in history, sometimes known as "The Snow Winter".<ref>Laskin, David. ''The Children's Blizzard''. New York: HarperCollins, 2004. Pp. 56–57.</ref><ref>Potter, Constance. [https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2003/winter/little-town-in-nara-2.html "Genealogy Notes: De Smet, Dakota Territory, Little Town in the National Archives, Part 2"]. ''Prologue'', Vol. 35, No. 4 (Winter 2003).</ref><ref>Robinson, Doane. ''History of South Dakota'' (1904). Volume I, [http://files.usgwarchives.net/sd/history/robinson/liii.txt Chapter III], pp. 306–09.</ref>

The story begins in Dakota Territory at the Ingalls homestead in South Dakota on a hot September day in 1880 as Laura and her father ("Pa") are haying. Pa tells Laura that he knows the winter is going to be hard because muskrats always build a house with thick walls before a hard winter, and this year, they have built the thickest walls he has ever seen. In mid-October, the Ingalls wake with an unusually early blizzard howling around their poorly insulated claim shanty. Soon afterward, Pa receives another warning from an unexpected source: a dignified old Native American man comes to the general store in town to warn the white settlers that there will be seven months of blizzards. Impressed, Pa decides to move the family into town for the winter.<ref name=":9">{{Cite book|title=The Long Winter|last=Wilder|first=Laura Ingalls|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1940|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>

Laura attends school with her younger sister, Carrie until the weather becomes too severe to permit them to walk to and from the school building. Blizzard after blizzard sweeps through the town over the next few months. Food and fuel become scarce and expensive, as the town depends on the trains to bring supplies but the frequent blizzards prevent the trains from getting through. Eventually, the railroad company suspends all efforts to dig out the train, stranding the town. For weeks, the Ingalls subsist on potatoes and coarse brown bread, using twisted hay for fuel. As even this meager food runs out, Laura's future husband Almanzo Wilder and his friend Cap Garland risk their lives to bring wheat to the starving townspeople – enough to last the rest of the winter.<ref name=":9" />

Laura's age in this book is also accurate. (In 1880, she would have been 13, as she states in the first chapter.) However, Almanzo Wilder's age is misrepresented in this book.  Much is made of the fact that he is 19 pretending to be 21 in order to illegally obtain a homestead claim from the US government.  But in 1880, his true age would have been 23.  Scholar Ann Romines has suggested that Laura made Almanzo younger because it was felt that more modern audiences would be scandalized by the great difference in their ages in light of their young marriage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kuznets|first=Lois R.|date=Spring 2000|title=Wild and Wilder: Gendered Spaces in Narratives for Children and Adults|journal=Michigan Quarterly Review|volume=XXXIX|issue=2|issn=1558-7266|hdl=2027/spo.act2080.0039.226}}</ref>

As predicted, the blizzards continue for seven months. Finally, the trains begin running again, bringing the Ingalls a Christmas barrel full of good things – including a turkey. In the last chapter, they sit down to enjoy their Christmas dinner in May.<ref name=":9" />

===''Little Town on the Prairie''===
{{main|Little Town on the Prairie}}

''Little Town on the Prairie'', published in 1941 and seventh in the series.

The story begins as Laura accepts her first job performing sewing work in order to earn money for Mary to go to a college for the blind in Iowa. Laura's hard work comes to an end by summer when she is let go, and the family begins planning to raise cash crops to pay for Mary's college. After the crops are destroyed by blackbirds, Pa sells a calf to earn the balance of the money needed. When Ma and Pa escort Mary to the college, Laura, Carrie, and Grace are left alone for a week. In order to stave off the loneliness stemming from Mary's departure, Laura, Carrie, and Grace do the fall cleaning. They have several problems, but the house is sparkling when they are done. Ma and Pa come home, and are truly surprised.<ref name=":10">{{Cite book|title=Little Town on the Prairie|last=Wilder|first=Laura Ingalls|publisher=harper & Row|year=1941|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>

In the fall, the Ingalls quickly prepare for a move to town for the winter. Laura and Carrie attend school in town and Laura is reunited with her friends Minnie Johnson and Mary Power and meets a new girl, Ida Brown. There is a new schoolteacher for the winter term: Eliza Jane Wilder, Almanzo’s sister. Nellie Oleson, Laura's nemesis from Plum Creek, has moved to De Smet and is attending the school. Nellie turns the teacher against Laura and Miss Wilder loses control of the school for a time. A visit by the school board restores order; however, Miss Wilder leaves at the end of the fall term, and is eventually replaced by Mr. Clewett and then Mr. Owen, the latter of whom befriends Laura. Through the course of the winter, Laura sets herself to studying, as she only has one year left before she can apply for a teaching certificate.<ref name=":10" />

At the same time, Almanzo Wilder begins escorting Laura home from church. By Christmastime, Almanzo once again sees Laura home, and offers to take her on a sleigh ride after he completes the [[Sled#Other sleds|cutter]] he is building.<ref name=":10" />

At home, Laura is met by Mr. Boast and Mr. Brewster, who ask Laura if she would be interested in a teaching position at a settlement led by Brewster twelve miles (19&nbsp;km) from town. The school superintendent, George Williams, comes and tests Laura (though she is two months too young, he never asks her age), and she is awarded a third-grade teaching certificate.<ref name=":10" />

===''These Happy Golden Years''===
{{main|These Happy Golden Years}}

''These Happy Golden Years'', published in 1943 and eighth in the series, originally ended with a note alone on the last page: "The end of the Little house books."<ref name="LCC1943">[http://lccn.loc.gov/43051065 "These happy golden years"] (first edition). Library of Congress Online Catalog (catalog.loc.gov). Retrieved September 17, 2015.</ref> It takes place between 1882 and 1885. As the story begins, [[Charles Ingalls|Pa]] is taking Laura 12 miles (19&nbsp;km) from home to her first teaching assignment at Brewster settlement. Laura, only 15 and a schoolgirl herself, is apprehensive as this is both the first time she has left home and the first school she has taught. She is determined to complete her assignment and earn $40 to help her sister [[Mary Ingalls|Mary]], who is attending Vinton College for the Blind in Iowa.<ref name=":11">{{Cite book|title=These Happy Golden Years|url=https://archive.org/details/thesehappygolden0000wild|url-access=registration|last=Wilder|first=Laura Ingalls|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1943|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>

This first school proves difficult for her. Laura must board with the Brewsters in their two-room claim shanty, sleeping on their sofa. The Brewsters are an unhappy family and Laura is deeply uncomfortable observing the way husband and wife quarrel. In one particularly unsettling incident, she wakes in the night to see Mrs Brewster standing over her husband with a knife. It is a bitterly cold winter, and neither the claim shanty or the school house can be heated adequately. The children she is teaching, some of whom are older than she is herself, test her skills as a teacher. Laura grows more self-assured through the term, and successfully completes the two-month term.<ref name=":11" />

To Laura's surprise and delight, homesteader [[Almanzo Wilder]] (with whom she became acquainted in ''[[Little Town on the Prairie]]'') appears at the end of her first week of school in his new two-horse cutter to bring her home for the weekend. Already fond of Laura and wanting to ease her homesickness, Almanzo takes it upon himself to bring her home and back to school each weekend.<ref name=":11" />

The relationship continues after the school term ends. Sleigh rides give way to buggy rides in the spring, and Laura impresses Almanzo with her willingness to help break his new and often temperamental horses. Laura's old nemesis, [[Nellie Oleson]], makes a brief appearance during two Sunday buggy rides with Almanzo. Nellie's chatter and flirtatious behavior towards Almanzo annoys Laura. Shortly thereafter, Nellie moves back to New York after her family loses their homestead.<ref name=":11" />

Laura's Uncle Tom (Ma's brother) visits the family and tells of his failed venture with a covered wagon brigade seeking gold in the Black Hills. Laura helps out seamstress Mrs. McKee by staying with her and her daughter on their prairie claim for two months to "hold it down" as required by law. The family enjoys summer visits from Mary.<ref name=":11" />

The family finances have improved to the point that Pa can sell a cow to purchase a sewing machine for [[Caroline Ingalls|Ma]]. Laura continues to teach and work as a seamstress.<ref name=":11" />

Almanzo invites Laura to attend summer "singing school" with him and her classmates. On the last evening of singing school while driving Laura home, Almanzo – who has by now been courting Laura for three years – proposes to Laura. During their next ride, Almanzo presents Laura with a garnet-and-pearl ring and they share their first kiss.<ref name=":11" />

Several months later, after Almanzo has finished building a house on his tree claim, he asks Laura if she would mind getting married within a few days as his sister and mother have their hearts set on a large church wedding, which Pa cannot afford. Laura agrees, and she and Almanzo are married in a simple ceremony by the Reverend Brown. After a wedding dinner with her family, Laura drives away with Almanzo and the newlyweds settle contentedly into their new home.<ref name=":11" />

===''The First Four Years''===
{{main|The First Four Years (novel)}}

''The First Four Years'', published in 1971, is commonly considered the ninth and last book in the original Little House series. It covers the earliest years of Laura and Almanzo's marriage.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book|title=The First Four Years|url=https://archive.org/details/firstfouryear00wild|url-access=registration|last=Wilder|first=Laura Ingalls|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1971|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>

''The First Four Years'' derives its title from a promise Laura made to Almanzo when they became engaged. Laura did not want to be a farm wife, but she consented to try farming for three years. At the end of that time, Laura and Almanzo mutually agreed to continue for one more year, a "year of grace", in Laura's words. The book ends at the close of that fourth year, on a rather optimistic note. In reality, the continually hot, dry Dakota summers, and several other tragic events described in the book eventually drove them from their land, but they later founded a very successful fruit and dairy farm in Missouri, where they lived comfortably until their respective deaths.<ref name=":12" />

{{Main|Little House on the Prairie (TV series)}}

The television series ''Little House on the Prairie'' aired on the [[NBC]] network from 1974 to 1983.

[[Michael Landon]] starred as Charles Ingalls, [[Karen Grassle]] played Caroline Ingalls, [[Melissa Gilbert]] played Laura Ingalls, [[Melissa Sue Anderson]] played Mary Ingalls, and the twins [[Lindsay and Sidney Greenbush]] (credited as Lindsay Sidney Greenbush) played Carrie Ingalls. [[Victor French]] portrayed long-time friend Mr. Edwards. [[Dean Butler (actor)|Dean Butler]] portrayed Laura's husband, [[Almanzo Wilder]]. Some characters were added in the show, such as Albert, played by [[Matthew Laborteaux]], an orphan whom the family adopted.<ref name=":5" />
