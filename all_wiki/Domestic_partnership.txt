A '''domestic partnership''' is an [[interpersonal relationship]] between two individuals who [[cohabitation|live together]] and share a common domestic life, but are not [[marriage|married]] (to each other or to anyone else). People in domestic partnerships receive benefits that guarantee [[right of survivorship]], hospital visitation, and others.

The term is not used consistently, which results in some inter-jurisdictional confusion. Some jurisdictions, such as [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United States|U.S.]] states of [[California]], [[Maine]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]] and for couples over 62 within [[Washington (state)|Washington]] use the term "domestic partnership" to mean what other jurisdictions call [[civil union]], [[civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnership]], or [[registered partnership]].  Other jurisdictions use the term as it was originally coined, to mean an interpersonal status created by local municipal and county governments, which provides an extremely limited range of rights and responsibilities.

Some legislatures have voluntarily established domestic partnership relations by statute instead of being ordered to do so by a court. Although some jurisdictions have instituted domestic partnerships as a way to recognize [[same-sex marriage]], statutes do exist which provide for recognition of opposite-sex domestic partnerships in many jurisdictions.

In some legal jurisdictions, '''domestic partners''' who live together for an extended period of time but are not legally entitled to [[common-law marriage]] may be entitled to legal protection in the form of a domestic partnership. Some domestic partners may enter into '''nonmarital relationship contracts''' in order to agree, either verbally or in writing, to issues involving property ownership, support obligations, and similar issues common to marriage.  (See [[effects of marriage]] and [[palimony]].) Beyond agreements, registration of relationships in '''domestic partnership registries''' allow for the jurisdiction to formally acknowledge domestic partnerships as valid relationships with limited rights.

===Origin of term in Californian municipalities===
In August 1979, [[gay rights]] activist [[Tom Brougham]] proposed a new category of relationship called "domestic partnership".<ref name=history>{{cite web |url=http://www.equalitywithoutmarriage.org/G&LR%20July-Aug%202008.pdf |title=A Brief History of Domestic Partnerships |access-date=July 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116152124/http://www.equalitywithoutmarriage.org/G%26LR%20July-Aug%202008.pdf |archive-date=November 16, 2010 }}</ref>  Initially, the requirements were that only two people who resided together and were qualified to marry except that they were the same gender.  Additional requirements were later added for the partners to maintain mutual financial responsibility and for both to be at least eighteen years old and able to enter into a legal contract.<ref>{{cite web |author=admin, on May 26, 2010% |url=http://divorcelawca.com/category/domestic-partners/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614111314/http://divorcelawca.com/category/domestic-partners/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 14, 2010 |title=Domestic-Partners |publisher=Divorce Law CA |date=May 26, 2010 |access-date=June 11, 2010 }}</ref>

====San Francisco====
In 1982, Brougham's definition was modified by Supervisor [[Harry Britt]], a gay man appointed to replace [[Harvey Milk]].  Britt's version was adopted and passed by the [[San Francisco]] Board of Supervisors, but [[Dianne Feinstein]], mayor of San Francisco at the time, came under intense pressure from the [[Catholic Church]] and vetoed the bill.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/10/us/partnership-law-vetoed-on-coast.html|title=Partnership law vetoed on coast|first=Wallace|last=Turner|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 10, 1982|access-date=February 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524232145/http://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/10/us/partnership-law-vetoed-on-coast.html|archive-date=May 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1989, a domestic partnership law was adopted in San Francisco.<ref>

According to the [[San Francisco Human Rights Commission]], "In 1982, the term 'domestic partner' was first used in a lawsuit filed by [[San Francisco Human Rights Commission]] employee Larry Brinkin. Mr. Brinkin, then an employee of Southern Pacific Railway, had recently suffered the loss of his partner of eleven years. When he was denied the three days of paid bereavement leave given to married employees, he filed suit with the assistance of the ACLU. Mr. Brinkin lost his case. Despite a great deal of evidence to the contrary, the judge agreed with his employer's claim that there was no way to know if his relationship was legitimate."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/sfhumanrights/docs/eb_2yr.pdf |title=Two Year Report on the San Francisco Equal Rights Ordinance |publisher=Sfgov.org |access-date=July 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310235518/http://www.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/sfhumanrights/docs/eb_2yr.pdf |archive-date=March 10, 2008}}</ref>

====Berkeley====
{{main|Domestic Partner Task Force}}
In 1983, the City Council of [[Berkeley, California]], under the leadership of Mayor Gus Newport, ordered their Human Relations and Welfare Commission to develop a domestic partnership proposal.  The Commission appointed its Vice-Chair, Leland Traiman, a gay activist, to head the Domestic Partner Task Force and draft a policy.  Working with Tom Brougham, members of the East Bay Lesbian/Gay Democratic Club, and attorney Matt Coles, the Domestic Partner Task Force drafted what has become the template for domestic partner/civil union policies around the world.  The City of Berkeley's Human Relations and Welfare Commission held a public hearing early in 1984 on "Examining the Use of Marriage to Determine Benefits and Liabilities in Berkeley and the Alternatives". A policy was adopted by the Commission and presented to the City Council. A copy was sent to the Berkeley School Board.  In July 1984 the City Council voted down the proposal citing financial concerns.  On August 1, 1984, the Berkeley School Board enacted the policy by a 4 to 1 vote.  The school board motion was made by board member and community activist Ethel Manheimer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Ethel-Manheimer-Berkeley-activist-dies-4110179.php|title=Ethel Manheimer, Berkeley activist, dies|publisher=SFGate|date=December 12, 2012|first=Joe|last=Garofoli|access-date=December 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121216045010/http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Ethel-Manheimer-Berkeley-activist-dies-4110179.php|archive-date=December 16, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

In November 1984, all the city council members up for election who had voted against the policy lost reelection.  Progressives from the Berkeley Citizens' Action (BCA) slate who replaced them had voiced strong support for a domestic partner policy. The East Bay Lesbian/Gay Democratic Club had worked hard to elect the BCA Slate.  This was the first time domestic partners was a campaign issue.  At the first meeting of the new City Council in December 1984, the Berkeley City Council enacted a policy extending employee benefits to unmarried couples of any [[gender]].  The first couple to file for benefits under Berkeley's sex-neutral policy were Brougham and his partner Barry Warren.

However, the City Council did not create a registry for domestic partners until 1991.  On October 11 of that year, 28 lesbian and gay male couples and one heterosexual couple registered their partnerships. The registry and benefits were also extended to non-resident couples that same year.

====West Hollywood====
In 1985, [[West Hollywood]] city council member [[John Heilman]] successfully introduced domestic partner legislation for city residents and employees that was passed by the city council and created the first ''domestic partnership registry''.<ref name=history />

===Statewide===
====California====
{{Main|Domestic partnership in California}}

California created the first state-level domestic partnership in the United States in 1999. Effective from January 1, 2020, domestic partnerships will be legally available to all couples consisting of any two people, regardless of gender over 18 years old. The California Governor signed the bill SB-30 into law on July 30, 2019.<ref>http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB30</ref><ref>https://www.ktvq.com/cnn-regional/2019/07/31/domestic-partnerships-are-not-just-for-same-sex-couples-anymore-in-california/</ref>

On September 4, 2003 the [[California]] legislature passed an expanded domestic partnership bill, extending all of the state legal rights and responsibilities of marriage to people in state domestic partnerships. California's comprehensive domestic partner legislation was the first same-sex couples policy in the United States created by a legislature without a court order. The legislation became effective January 1, 2005.

Pre-existing municipal and county domestic partnership ordinances remain in force unless repealed by their local governments. Thus, residents of San Francisco, West Hollywood, and a few other locations may choose between a local domestic partnership, a California domestic partnership, or marriage. Nothing in either the 1999 or 2003 domestic partnership legislation applies to any of the municipal or county domestic partnership ordinances, whose scopes are extremely limited and are not portable outside of the jurisdiction that issued them.

The State of California has developed an Online Self-Help Center that provides resources and information to assist domestic partners in many areas, including [https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/domestic-partners-registry/forms-fees/ filing domestic partnerships], [http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp/family/overview/endingdp.htm/ dissolving domestic partnerships], [http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp/family/overview/parentage.htm/ parenting issues], [http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp/family/overview/endingdp.htm#taxes/ tax issues], and more.

====District of Columbia====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia}}
Washington, D.C., has recognized domestic partnerships since 1992. However, Congress prohibited the District from spending any local funds to implement the law. The prohibition was lifted in the federal appropriations act for the District for the 2002 fiscal year. Domestic partnership in the District is open to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. All couples registered as domestic partners are entitled to the same rights as family members to visit their domestic partners in the hospital and to make decisions concerning the treatment of a domestic partner's remains after the partner's death. The measure also grants District of Columbia government employees rights to a number of benefits. Domestic partners are eligible for health care insurance coverage, can use annual leave or unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a dependent child or to care for a domestic partner or a partner's dependents, and can make funeral arrangements for a deceased partner. The Domestic Partnership Equality Amendment Act of 2006, D.C. Law 16-79, came into effect on April 4, 2006. This act provides that in almost all cases a domestic partner will have the same rights as a spouse regarding inheritance, probate, guardianship, and other rights traditionally accorded to spouses.<ref>{{cite web |author=Enter your Company or Top-Level Office |url=http://dchealth.dc.gov/doh/cwp/view,a,3,q,573324,dohNav_GID,1787,dohNav,%7C33110%7C33120%7C33139%7C.asp#6 |title=DOH: Vital Records – Domestic Partnership FAQ |publisher=Dchealth.dc.gov |access-date=July 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206125459/http://dchealth.dc.gov/doh/cwp/view%2Ca%2C3%2Cq%2C573324%2CdohNav_GID%2C1787%2CdohNav%2C%7C33110%7C33120%7C33139%7C.asp#6 |archive-date=February 6, 2010 }}</ref> D.C.

In Nevada domestic partnerships are granted all the benefits, rights, obligations and/or responsibilities of marriage (for any two adults over 18, regardless of gender) and these have become legally available since October 1, 2009. The act specifically excludes requiring any entity to provide health benefits to domestic partners. In addition, due to vagueness in the verbiage of the act, most companies and entities within Nevada refuse to acknowledge or afford any major benefits or rights to registered domestic partners, leaving legal action as the only avenue to garner individual rights.

====New Jersey====
{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in New Jersey}}
Domestic partnerships in New Jersey have been available since July 30, 2004 for same-sex couples, and for opposite-sex couples in which both people are above the age of 62.<ref>https://www.nj.gov/health/forms/reg-d33.pdf</ref> However, on October 25, 2006, the [[Supreme Court of New Jersey]] ruled that under the [[New Jersey]] state constitution, the state could not deny the benefits of marriage to same-sex couples, although the court left it up to the legislature whether to call such relationships marriage or to use a different term.  Complying with the court's ruling, on December 14, 2006, the [[New Jersey Legislature]] passed a bill establishing [[civil union]]s for same-sex couples, which was signed into law by the governor on December 21 and came into effect on February 19, 2007.

==== Oregon ====
{{Main|Domestic partnership in Oregon}}

The governor of Oregon, [[Ted Kulongoski]], signed a domestic partnership bill into law on May 9, 2007. Called the [[Oregon Family Fairness Act]], the law would provide several major rights to same-sex couples that were previously only given to married couples, including the ability to file jointly on insurance forms, hospital visitation rights, and rights relating to the deceased partner. The law's initial implementation was delayed by a federal Court, but the injunction was lifted on February 1, 2008 and the law went into effect on February 4.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Oregon governor signs gay rights bills|url = https://www.nbcnews.com/id/18577612/ns/politics/t/oregon-governor-signs-gay-rights-bills|access-date = July 10, 2015|date = May 9, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150710223436/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18577612/ns/politics/t/oregon-governor-signs-gay-rights-bills|archive-date = July 10, 2015|url-status = live}}</ref>

Wisconsin was the first state in the Midwest to legislatively enact same-sex unions.

On July 23, 2009, three members of Wisconsin Family Action filed a petition for an original action in the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]], seeking a declaration that the domestic partner registry is unconstitutional under the state's [[Wisconsin Referendum 1 (2006)|Marriage Protection Amendment]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=165236 |title=Wisconsin Family Action: Asks State Supreme Court to declare Gov.

June 20, 2011: Dane County Judge Dan Moeser ruled that the domestic partnership registry does not violate the state constitution, finding that the state "does not recognize domestic partnership in a way that even remotely resembles how the state recognizes marriage".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/21/us-wisconsin-gays-idUSTRE75K00A20110621 |title=Judge rules Wisconsin same sex registry is constitutional |access-date=July 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017101913/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/21/us-wisconsin-gays-idUSTRE75K00A20110621 |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Wisconsin ended its domestic partnership registry on April 1, 2018.

====Other states====
{{main|Cohabitation in the United States}}

Many states recognize through their judicial systems [[cohabitation agreement]]s and common law partner agreements concluded between two partners in a relationship. These are de facto domestic partnerships that protect both parties and allow for shared property and court recognition of their relationships.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2012/03/20/pf/prenuptial-agreements/index.htm|title=Prenups aren't just for married couples anymore|last=Dickler|first=Jessica|website=CNNMoney|access-date=April 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308040626/https://money.cnn.com/2012/03/20/pf/prenuptial-agreements/index.htm|archive-date=March 8, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Implementation of the plan was cancelled once the Supreme Court handed down its opinion in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]''.

== In Europe ==
In [[France]] since 1968, article 515-81 of [[Code civil]] defines domestic partnership (in [[French language|French]]: ''concubinage '' or ''concubinage notoire''<ref>The current meaning of the French ''concubinage'' therefore tends to stray away from the polygamous context or from female inferiority context of the English word concubinage ([http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/concubinage?s=t See English definitions on dictionary.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222135806/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/concubinage?s=t |date=December 22, 2015 }})</ref>) as a ''de facto'' union between two persons, of different sex or of same sex, characterised by a stable and continuous cohabitation and partnership. The French fiscal administration takes it into account in the calculation of the [[solidarity tax on wealth]] but not for other purposes. All children enjoy equal right whether within or outside wedlock. Since 1999 French law also provides for a [[civil solidarity pact]] (in [[French language|French]]: ''pacte civil de solidarité'', or ''PACS''), a contractual form of civil union between two adults bringing additional rights and responsibilities, but less so than marriage.

[[Hungary]] has domestic partnerships, whereas most other nations in Europe recognize some form of [[civil union]]s, also called a registered partnership, or civil partnership for same-sex partners, which afford rights similar to marriage to LGBT couples. [[Croatia]] also had domestic partnerships until June 2014 when Croatian parliament passed a law allowing civil partnerships for same-sex couples giving them all rights except adoption rights.

In Hungary, since 1995<ref>{{cite web |url=http://net.jogtar.hu/jr/gen/getdoc2.cgi?dbnum=1&docid=995H0014.AB |title=14/1995. (III. 13.)

In April 2009, the Hungarian Parliament passed a ''Registration Partnership Act 2009'' with a vote of 199–159, which provides a registered partnership for same-sex couples with all the benefits and entitlements of marriage (except for marriage itself, adoption, IVF access, taking a partner's surname, parentage and surrogacy). The law was passed in December 2007 by a vote of 110–78, but the Constitutional Court of Hungary was "deeply concerned" that the law was a duplication of opposite-sex marriage benefits and entitlements, so same-sex couples only registration was chosen. Some politicians of the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] and [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] parties have argued for the introduction of marriage for same-sex couples. The ''Registration Partnership Act 2009'' came into effect from July 1, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/marriage_timeline.htm |title=Gay and Lesbian Marriage, Partnership or Unions Worldwide |publisher=UK Gay News |access-date=July 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615184256/http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/marriage_timeline.htm |archive-date=June 15, 2009 }}</ref>

===New Zealand===
In 2001, the [[Property (Relationships) Act 1976]] was extended to offer partners in unregistered "de facto" relationships similar rights to those of married couples. A de facto relationship is defined as a relationship between two persons living as a couple, who are not married or in a [[Civil union in New Zealand|civil union]]. This applies to both heterosexual and same sex couples.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1976/0166/latest/DLM440945.html |title=Property (Relationships) Act 1976 |publisher=New Zealand Legislation, Parliamentary Counsel Office |date=June 18, 2009 |access-date=June 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213160002/http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1976/0166/latest/DLM440945.html |archive-date=February 13, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Since 2013, [[same-sex marriage]] is legally recognised and performed within New Zealand and still includes unregistered "de facto" relationships similar rights to those of married couples.
