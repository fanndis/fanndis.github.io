{{Politics of England}}
'''North East England''' is one of nine official [[regions of England]] at the [[First-level NUTS of the European Union|first level]] of [[NUTS statistical regions of the United Kingdom|NUTS]] for [[Eurostat|statistical]] purposes. It includes the counties of [[Tyne and Wear]], [[County Durham]], [[Northumberland]] and a small part of [[North Yorkshire]]. The north east is home to three [[conurbation]]s: [[Tyneside]], [[Wearside]], and [[Teesside]], as well as three cities: [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Sunderland]] and [[Durham, England|City of Durham]]. Large towns in the region include [[Darlington]], [[Gateshead]], [[Hartlepool]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[South Shields]], [[Stockton-on-Tees]] and [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]]. The region is home to a number of universities including [[Durham University]] and [[Newcastle University]], both members of the [[Russell Group]].

Due to the [[brexit|2016 vote to exit the EU]], NUTS regions will become unofficial. By the start of 2021, British regulators will be able to adopt or create new statistical divisioning of England.

The region is generally hilly and sparsely populated in the North and West, and urban and arable in the East and South. The highest point in the region is [[The Cheviot]], in the [[Cheviot Hills]], at {{convert|815|m|ft|0}}.

The region contains the urban centres of [[Tyneside]], [[Wearside]] and [[Teesside]], and is noted for the rich natural beauty of its coastline, [[Northumberland National Park]], and the section of the [[Pennines]] that includes [[Teesdale]] and [[Weardale]]. The regions historic importance is displayed by Northumberland's ancient castles, the two [[World Heritage Sites]] of [[Durham Cathedral]] and [[Durham Castle]],<ref>{{cite web|publisher= UNESCO|title= World Heretige List: Durham Cathedral and Castle|url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/370|access-date= 5 April 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090219003730/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/370|archive-date= 19 February 2009|url-status= live}}</ref> and [[Hadrian's Wall]]<ref>{{cite web|publisher= UNESCO|title= World Heretige List: Frontiers of the Roman Empire|url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/430|access-date= 5 April 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170506113424/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/430|archive-date= 6 May 2017|url-status= live}}</ref> one of the frontiers of the [[Roman Empire]].

On 6 June 793 the Vikings arrived on the shores of north-east England with a raiding party from Norway who attacked the monastic settlement on Lindisfarne.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kris|last=Hirst|publisher=About.com Guide|title=Viking Raids: The Early Medieval Practice of Viking Raids|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/vikings/qt/viking_raid.htm|access-date=23 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523072439/http://archaeology.about.com/od/vikings/qt/viking_raid.htm|archive-date=23 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The monks fled or were slaughtered, and Bishop Higbald sought refuge on the mainland. A chronicler recorded: "On the 8th June, the harrying of the heathen miserably destroyed God's church by rapine and slaughter."

==Climate==
North East England has an [[oceanic climate]] with narrower temperature ranges than the south of England. Summers and winters are mild rather than extremely hot or cold, due to the strong maritime influence of the [[North Atlantic Current]] of the [[Gulf Stream]]. The [[Met Office]] operates several weather stations in the region<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate|title=UK climate normals station map|publisher=Met Office|access-date=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190517053458/https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate|archive-date=17 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and are able they show the regional variations in temperature and its relation to the distance from the [[North Sea]]. The warmest summers in the region are found in Stockton-on-Tees and the [[Middlesbrough]] area, with a 1981-2010 July average high of {{convert|20.4|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcxn3ykru|title=Stockton-on-Tees climate normals 1981-2010|publisher=Met Office|access-date=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722055547/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcxn3ykru|archive-date=22 July 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Precipitation is often low by English standards, in spite of the low levels of sunshine, with Stockton-on-Tees averaging only {{convert|574.2|mm|in}} annually, and with the seaside town of Tynemouth (despite its slightly sunnier climate) recording {{convert|597.2|mm|in}} annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcybzz9xh|title=Tynemouth Climate Normals 1981-2010|publisher=Met Office|access-date=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428061242/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcybzz9xh|archive-date=28 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The summers on the northern coastlines are significantly cooler than in the southern and central inland areas: Tynemouth is only just above {{convert|18|C|F}} in July. Further inland, frosts during winter are more common, due to the higher elevations and distance from the sea.

===Elections===
The North East has a strong tendency to vote [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. In the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 election]], 47% of the electorate voted Labour, while 25% voted [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], 17% UKIP, 6% [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] and 4% Green. At the [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2009 European election]], Labour got 25% of the region's vote, the Conservatives 20%, the Liberal Democrats 18%, and [[UK Independence Party]] 15%.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Telegraph|title=European elections 2009: North East region|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/5291337/European-elections-2009-North-East-region.html|access-date=28 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031135712/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/5291337/European-elections-2009-North-East-region.html|archive-date=31 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> However, in recent years, the North East has seen a significant swing away from Labour. In the 2019 election, many constituencies were targeted by the Conservatives and their representation increased to 10 MPs. The region wide vote shares were 43% for Labour and 38% for the Conservatives, with the [[Brexit Party]] a distant third on 8%.

===Population genetics===
North East England, together with Tweeddale, was the ancient British tribal kingdom of [[Bernicia]] (Bryneich) and is notable for providing the stable ancestry of its present indigenous population, which has been identified by DNA analysis to be an offshoot of the group  "Scotland, Cumbria and the North of Ireland", but not so closely related to the other peoples of the UK.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The fine-scale genetic structure of the British population|last = Nature Journal|date = 19 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peopleofthebritishisles.org/nl6.pdf |title=Newsletter Issue 6 - March 2015 |access-date=1 January 2017 |publisher=People of the British Isles |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111723/http://www.peopleofthebritishisles.org/nl6.pdf |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Teenage pregnancy===
The Office for National Statistics in April 2013 report that the estimated number of conceptions to women aged under 18 in England and Wales in 2011 is the lowest since records began in 1969.<ref name="Office for National Statistics">{{cite web|publisher=Office for National Statistics|title=Teenage pregnancies at lowest level since records began|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/conception-statistics--england-and-wales/2011/sty-conception-estimates-2011.html|access-date=23 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915083732/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/conception-statistics--england-and-wales/2011/sty-conception-estimates-2011.html|archive-date=15 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>  Conception statistics include pregnancies that result in either one or more live births or stillbirths or a legal abortion.

A comparison of rates across regions in England shows that the North East had the highest of under 18 conception rates in 2011, with 38.4 per thousand women aged 15–17. The South East had the lowest rate for women aged under 18 in 2011 with 26.1 per thousand women aged 15–17.<ref name="Office for National Statistics"/>

===Social deprivation===
A study into social deprivation was published in 2010 to help the local partners developing a Regional Strategy for the North East better understand the factors influencing deprivation in the region. The study had two main aspects: Firstly to establish if there are different types of deprived neighbourhoods in the Northeast, and if so, how deprived neighbourhoods can be better recognised. Secondly to present a summary of ‘what works' in tackling deprivation in each of these types of area.<ref>{{cite paper|last=Sutherland, McTier,  Macdougall & McGregor|publisher=Glasgow University Training and Employment Research Unit (TERU)|title=Factors Influencing Deprivation in North East England|url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/45807/1/45807.pdf|access-date=23 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427032241/http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/45807/1/45807.pdf|archive-date=27 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The report discusses the factors influencing deprivation and points out that it is a significant problem for the North East with 34% of the regions Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) are amongst England's 20% most deprived in the 2007 [[Indices of deprivation 2007|Indices of Deprivation]](these indices have been [[Indices of deprivation 2010|updated in 2010]]). It takes many years for areas to become deprived, suggesting that the underlying causes of area-based deprivation are long-term such as:

* Major changes in the employment base, which has changed the nature and spatial distribution of jobs in the UK and within specific regions and localities.
* The ‘residential sorting' effects of the public and private housing markets.
Industrial restructuring has disproportionately affected some communities and groups. In particular:
* Job losses in manufacturing and coalmining were most severely felt in the north of England, Scotland and Wales – and particular communities within these areas.
* As a result of the types of jobs that were lost, some demographic groups – particularly older working age males in skilled manual work – were more likely to be affected than others.

The region's most deprived council districts, as measured by the LSOA data<ref>Communities and Local Government. ''[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/576659.pdf The English Indices of deprivation 2007]''</ref> before County Durham and Northumberland became unitary authorities in 2007, are in descending order [[Easington (district)|Easington]] (7th in England), Middlesbrough (9th), Hartlepool (23rd), [[Wear Valley]] (33rd), Sunderland (35th), Newcastle upon Tyne (37th), South Tyneside (38th), Wansbeck (46th), Redcar and Cleveland (50th), Gateshead (52nd), [[Sedgefield (borough)|Sedgefield]] (54th), [[Derwentside]] (73rd), [[Blyth Valley]] (80th), and Stockton on Tees (98th).

The least deprived council districts in 2007 were, in descending order, Tynedale, [[Castle Morpeth]], [[Teesdale (district)|Teesdale]], then [[Alnwick (district)|Alnwick]]. Since the April 2009 abolition of these four districts, Northumberland is the least deprived, followed by North Tyneside.

Unemployment is a severe problem in the North East, where many children grow up in households where no adult works. in 2010 Easington had the highest rate in the country, as 40.3% of its households with children had no working adult, followed by Sedgefield with 34%.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In 2013 the Office for National Statistics report issued the statements highlighted below<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Office for National Statistics|title=Regional Labour Market Statistics, June 2013|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-labour/regional-labour-market-statistics/june-2013/index.html|access-date=23 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117063129/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-labour/regional-labour-market-statistics/june-2013/index.html|archive-date=17 November 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

The latest statistical report from the [[Office for National Statistics]] comparing the Northeast of England to other regions of the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Office for National Statistics|title=Regional Profiles, Economy, North East, May 2012|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-trends/region-and-country-profiles/economy---may-2012/economy---north-east--may-2012.html|access-date=22 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916194319/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-trends/region-and-country-profiles/economy---may-2012/economy---north-east--may-2012.html|archive-date=16 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> dated May 2012, states:

* The North East has the highest value of goods exports relative to the size of its economy, the highest percentage employed in the public sector and lowest gross household income per head of the English regions.
* The North East's exports of goods, expressed as a percentage of gross value added (GVA), were the highest of all the English regions at 29% in 2010, compared with the UK average of 20%. Over half the region's goods exports were to the EU (55%).<ref>{{cite news|first=Rebecca|last=Wearn|publisher=BBC|title=North East leads the way on exports|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19294297|access-date=22 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027094052/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19294297|archive-date=27 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>
* A quarter of employed people in the region worked in the public sector in Q4 2011 (24.6%), the highest proportion among the English regions, down from 26.9% in Q4 2009. In 2010, at local authority level the highest shares of public sector employee jobs were to be found in Newcastle upon Tyne and Middlesbrough (both over 33% of all employee jobs).
* Gross disposable household income (GDHI) of residents in the North East, at £13,300 per head in 2010, was 15% below the UK average and the lowest of the English regions. It ranged from £12,400 in Sunderland to £16,090 in Northumberland.
*The North East region contributed 3% of the UK's [[Gross value added|GVA]]. The region's headline GVA was £41.0 billion in 2010. The latest subregional data (2009) show that Tyneside generated 37% of the region's GVA at £14.6 billion.
*In 2009 manufacturing industries generated 14% of the region's total GVA, which is the largest industry contribution for the region.
* Productivity in 2010 (measured by GVA per hour worked) was 88% of the UK rate: one of the lowest of the English regions. Within the region, Northumberland's productivity was the third lowest in England at 75% of the UK rate in 2009.
* The region's employment rate was the lowest in England at 66.2% for Q4 2011. The latest subregional data for the year ending September 2011 show that North Tyneside had the highest employment rate at 72.6%.
* The North East had the highest rate of economic inactivity of the English regions, 25% of the population aged 16 to 64 in Q4 2011.

The region was created in 1994 and was originally defined as the non-metropolitan counties of [[Northumberland]], [[County Durham]] and [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]], along with the metropolitan county of [[Tyne and Wear]]. A reform of local government abolished Cleveland and created several unitary districts, as detailed in the above table.

===2004 regional assembly referendum===
In November 2004 a [[2004 Northern England devolution referendums|referendum]] on whether a directly elected regional assembly should be set up for North East England resulted in a decisive "no" vote. The number of people who voted against the plans was 696,519 (78%), while 197,310 (22%) voted in favour. John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister at the time, admitted that his plans for regional devolution had suffered an "emphatic defeat". Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative spokesman for the regions, said the vote would mean the end of plans for a North East Assembly. He told the [[BBC]]: "The whole idea of regional government has been blown out of the water by this vote".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3984387.stm | work=BBC News | title=North East votes 'no' to assembly | date=5 November 2004 | access-date=20 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121041029/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3984387.stm | archive-date=21 January 2007 | url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[North East Combined Authority]] was established in 2014 and covers much of the region, except for the [[Tees Valley]] boroughs of Darlington, Hartlepool, Stockton-on-Tees, Redcar & Cleveland, and Middlesbrough. These instead established the [[Tees Valley Combined Authority]] in 2016.

==Industrial heritage==
After more than 2,000 years of industrial activity as a result of abundant minerals such as salt and coal<ref>{{cite web|first=Louise|last=Gwynne-Jones|publisher=NEPIC|title=SEAL SANDS 1000 years of Industry alongside Nature|url=http://www.nepic.co.uk/media_centre/news/details.asp?ntag=1443|access-date=15 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214072333/http://www.nepic.co.uk/media_centre/news/details.asp?ntag=1443|archive-date=14 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|publisher=Current Archaeology|title=Exceeding Greatham Expectations|edition=282|date=5 August 2013}}</ref> the [[chemical industry]] of the Northeast England is today spread across the whole of the region<ref>{{cite web|publisher=NEPIC|title=Members Map|url=http://www.nepic.co.uk/members/themap.asp|access-date=16 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808194126/http://nepic.co.uk/members/themap.asp|archive-date=8 August 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> with [[pharmaceuticals]] being primarily produced in the north of the region, [[Speciality chemicals|speciality]] and [[fine chemicals]] spread across the middle of the region and [[commodity chemicals]] and [[petrochemicals]] on Teesside. These companies are members of the [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] (NEPIC). The early chemical industry in this region, however, was primarily Tyneside based and associated with the manufacture of soap and glass. The most important chemical activity in the 18th and 19th centuries was the manufacture of alkali to make soap, which was when mixed with lime and sand and used to make glass.<ref name="Simpson">{{cite web|first=David|last=Simpson|publisher=David Simpson|title=Chemicals and Glass 1800AD – 1900AD|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/ChemicalsandGlass.html|access-date=15 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313232948/http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/ChemicalsandGlass.html|archive-date=13 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  The effects of the industrial revolution could be seen through an economy dominated by iron and steel, coal mining and shipbuilding.

===Alkali manufacturing===
[[File:Friars Goose Alkali Works Engraving.png|thumb|Friars Goose Alkali Works had the highest chimney in England to disperse hydrochloric acid fumes]]
Before the industrial revolution alkali was mostly used to aid the bleaching process of cloth. As the [[industrial revolution]] took hold, increasing demand for alkali came from higher production of dyestuffs, and bleach. In 1798 John Losh and the Earl of Dundonald took out a lease for a rich supply of brine pumped from a nearby coal mine, the Walker pit, becoming the supplier of raw material for The [[Losh, Wilson & Bell]] Alkali works. The works were established at Walker-on-Tyne in 1807 and bleaching powder manufacture began there in 1830, Losh Brothers soon manufactured half the soda in England. By 1814 the [[Leblanc process]] of making alkali from common salt was introduced to Britain. Alkali works using this process opened at [[Tyne Dock]] 1822, Felling shore [[Tyneside]] 1826, Friars Goose [[Gateshead]] 1828 and again on Felling Shore in 1834. Such works also produced soda, alum and Epsom salts. 
The river frontage at South Shore of the [[River Tyne]] at Gateshead was one of the main locations for the chemical industry such that in the 19th century, which led to a cluster of iron, soap and alkali manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=ISee Gateshead|title=Chemical Works Friars Goose 1851|url=http://isee.gateshead.gov.uk/detail.php?type=related&kv=2522&t=objects|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130829140209/http://isee.gateshead.gov.uk/detail.php?type=related&kv=2522&t=objects|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 August 2013|access-date=29 August 2013}}</ref> By 1828 the alkali works had a large problem controlling emissions of [[hydrochloric acid]] fumes which devastated the neighbouring countryside. One solution was to build tall chimneys to drive the fumes further away and in 1833 the tallest chimney in England was built at the Friars Goose Alkali Works.<ref name="Simpson"/><ref>{{cite paper|first=I. C.|last=Carlton|title=A Short history of gateshead – Chemical Works in Gateshead|url=http://www.gatesheadlocalhistory.org.uk/resources/270920/chemicalworks.pdf|access-date=29 August 2013}}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The passing of the [[Alkali Act]] of 1863 in the UK Parliament brought about a further reduced pollution from these processes and was the first industrial environmental legislation to come into practice globally.

===Teesside chemicals===
Robert Wilson first produced sulphuric acid and fertilisers at Urlay Nook near Egglescliffe in 1833,  becoming [[Teesside|Teesside's]] first great chemical works. In 1859 [[rock salt]] deposits were discovered in Middlesbrough by [[Henry Bolckow]] and Vaughan while boring for water and led to the move of the heavy chemical industry to Teesside. In 1860 William James established an alkali company at Cargo Fleet and in 1869 [[Samuel Sadler]] also set up a factory nearby. Sadler's works produced synthetic aniline and alzarine dyestuffs and distilled tar. The introduction of the [[Solvay Process]] to make alkali in 1872 made the Tyneside alkali industry uneconomic but it was a real boost to Teesside industry which was invigorated by the discovery of further salt deposits at Port Clarence near Seal Sands by Bell Brothers in 1874.<ref name="Simpson"/> Salt extraction for human consumption had taken place at [[Seal Sands]] since Roman times through the use of panning. This continued throughout the 20th century and left caverns which are now used as liquid/gas strorage facilities for the process industry.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=Health & Safety Executive|title=Salt cavity natural gas storage – Consent and operational issues|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/gas/supply/saltcavity.htm|access-date=5 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211150121/http://www.hse.gov.uk/gas/supply/saltcavity.htm|archive-date=11 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===The Brunner Mond Company===
By 1882 a number of salt works were established at Haverton Hill in 1882 by the Bell Brothers. The company became the first firm to begin large scale salt production in Teesside, and necessitated that workers were brought in from Cheshire. The salt-making interests of Bell Brothers were bought by [[Brunner Mond]] & Co of Cheshire in 1890. Brunner Mond became a giant of Teesside chemical-making in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Meanwhile, rationalization of chemical firms in 1891 left only four works on Tyneside.<ref name="Simpson"/>

===Chemicals at Billingham===
The [[Chemical Industry]] was established at [[Billingham]] in 1918 by the Government for the production of synthetic [[ammonia]], with its intended use being the manufacture of munitions during the [[Great War]].<ref>{{cite book|first= W J|last=Reader|publisher =Oxford University Press|title=Imperial Chemical industries A History Volume 1 The Forerunners 1870–1926|year=1970}}</ref> The 700 acre Grange Farm at Billingham was chosen for the site. However, by the time the plant opened the war was over and its manufacturing techniques outdated. It was taken over by Brunner Mond in 1920 and manufactured synthetic ammonia and fertilisers. Brunner Mond merged with other large scale chemical manufacturers in 1926 to form [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI). In 1928 anhydrite was mined from below Billingham for use in the making of [[sulphuric acid]], a necessary component for the manufacture of [[detergents]] and [[fertilizers]].<ref name="Simpson"/>

===Plastics and nylon manufacture===

Manufacturing of plastics commenced at Billingham in 1934.<ref>{{cite book|first= W J|last=Reader|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Imperial Chemical industries A History Volume 2 The First Quarter Century 1926–1952|isbn=0192159445|year=1975}}</ref> This was one of the earliest sites in the world where large-scale manufacture of these materials took place. Another [[chemical plant]] was established the following year to make oil and [[petrol]] from [[creosote]] and [[coal]] by a process called [[hydrogenation]]. In 1946 another large chemical works opened on Teesside at [[Wilton, Redcar and Cleveland|Wilton]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Colin|last=Hurworth|publisher=Falcon Press| title=Wilton the First Fifty Years|isbn=1872339018|year=1999}}</ref> on the south side of the [[River Tees]]. Further lands were purchased by ICI in 1962 at Seal Sands, where land had been reclaimed from the sea, becoming the third large-scale chemical manufacturing site on Teesside.<ref name="Simpson"/> Today all three Teesside chemical sites at Billingham, Wilton, and Seal Sands remain in use for large-scale chemical manufacture by the members of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC), and plastics and polymers continue to be manufactured there by [http://www.lottechemical.co.uk Lotte Chemicals]([[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]]), [[SABIC]]([[Polyethylene|HDPE]]), [[Victrex]]([[PEEK]]) and [[Lucite|Lucite International]]([[Perspex]]). Nylon 66 manufacture ceased on Teesside in 2008 with the closure of the [[Invista]] manufacturing unit.

===Petrochemical production===
[[Coke ovens]] used in the production of chemicals at Billingham were replaced in 1962 by plants using the steam [[naphtha]] process, which enabled the use of crude oil as feedstock for the process known as cracking. This proved to be a much cheaper way to produce [[ethylene]], [[Aromatic chemical compound|aromatics]], petroleum derivatives and other chemicals such as [[ammonia]]. From 1964 to 1969 four large oil refineries were erected at the mouth of the Tees, two by Phillips Petroleum and one each by ICI and Shell. Their main purpose was to supply the Billingham chemical industry.<ref name="Simpson"/> A {{convert|138|mi|adj=on}} pipeline was built in 1968 for the transport of ethylene and linked chemical works on Teesside with chemical plants at Runcorn.<ref>{{cite paper|publisher=United Kingdom Onshore Pipeline Association|title=UK Ethylene System|url=http://www.ukopa.co.uk/pdfs/UKOPA-09-0016.pdf|access-date=17 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030004705/http://www.ukopa.co.uk/pdfs/UKOPA-09-0016.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Today the remaining oil refinery is operated by ConocoPhillips and two biorefineries which produce [[biodiesel]] and [[bioethanol]] as transport fuels, are operated by Ensus and Harvest Energy.

Salt-making in and around [[Greatham, County Durham|Greatham]] (between Hartlepool and Billingham) had been important in Roman and medieval times,<ref>{{cite paper|first=Chris|last=Tolan-Smith|publisher=Archaeological Research Services Ltd|title=North East Rapid Coastal Zone Assessment(NERCZA)|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/nercza-final-report/nerczafinalreportsmall.pdf|date=December 2008|access-date=17 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211064850/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/nercza-final-report/nerczafinalreportsmall.pdf|archive-date=11 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=William|last=Page|title=History of County Durham Volume 3|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42628|year=1928|pages=242–247|access-date=17 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209030631/http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42628|archive-date=9 February 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and salt was also produced on Wearside from the 1580s, but by the 16th century the industry had been eclipsed by South Shields on the Tyne.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Victorian County Archive|title=Sunderland Economy and Society 1600–1719|url=http://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/sites/default/files/work-in-progress/economy_and_society_1600.pdf|access-date=17 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214122636/http://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/sites/default/files/work-in-progress/economy_and_society_1600.pdf|archive-date=14 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1894 the industry returned to Greatham with the establishment of the Greatham Salt and Brine Company by George Weddell. The works was later purchased by the famous salt-making company [[Cerebos]] in 1903. By the mid-20th century, Cerebos was owned by the food conglomerate [[Rank Hovis McDougall]], and the factory closed in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=This is Hartlepool|title=Cerebos Salt Works|url=http://www.thisishartlepool.co.uk/history/cerebos-salt-works.asp|access-date=17 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904020224/http://www.thisishartlepool.co.uk/history/cerebos-salt-works.asp|archive-date=4 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the 20th century the extraction of salt on the north bank of the River Tees by aqueous hydraulic means resulted in a number of underground salt cavities that are completely impervious to gas and liquids. Consequently, these cavities are now used to store both industrial gases and liquids by companies which are members of the [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] (NEPIC). Today the [[Huntsman Corporation|Huntsman]] Tioxide is based close to Greatham, operating one of the world's largest [[chemical plant]]s for the manufacture of [[titanium dioxide]] which is the brilliant white [[pigment]] used in paints, Polo mints{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}, cosmetics, UV sunscreens, plastics, golf balls and sports field line markings.

===Coal mining===
[[File:Wynyard Morris.jpg|thumb|150px| Wynyard Park circa 1880 now a hotel, Wynyard Hall]] 
[[Coal mining]] was one of the first industrial activities in Northeast England because the region was fortunate to have shallow seams of coal near the coast, which meant that material could be transported in and out by sea.<ref name="Mining in Northeast England">{{cite web|publisher=Access to Mineral Heritage|title=Mining in Northeast England|url=http://mininghistory.thehumanjourney.net/edu/NEIntro.shtml|access-date=18 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822015314/http://mininghistory.thehumanjourney.net/edu/NEIntro.shtml|archive-date=22 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> This led to the growth of ports in Sunderland, Newcastle, [[Teesport]] Middlesbrough, [[Seaham]], [[Hartlepool]] and [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]]. The energy from coal underpinned the development of many of the industries around these ports. As discussed in the classic historical review of "Victorian Cities" by [[Asa Briggs]], Middlesbrough was developed as a port downstream of [[Yarm]] and Stockton to take bigger coal ships.<ref>{{cite book|first=Asa|last=Briggs|publisher=University of California Press|title=Victorian Cities|isbn=9780520079229|date=24 March 1993}}</ref> The Northumberland-Durham coalfield was one of the earliest coal mining areas to be worked in the country, with the Romans extracting coal here which caused the area to become an important source of coal in the 13th and 14th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Keys to the Past|title=Northeast England Overview:Industrial|url=http://www.keystothepast.info/Pages/pgOverview.aspx?OVERVIEW=Industrial|access-date=18 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323022723/http://www.keystothepast.info/Pages/pgOverview.aspx?OVERVIEW=Industrial|archive-date=23 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many current towns and villages across the region were originally settlements set up for the coal miners. For example, Seaham is a port community that was developed to handle output of the coal mining interests of Charles William Vane-Tempest-Stewart the 3rd [[Marquis of Londonderry]], a military leader and business man who became one of the UK's richest men due to his coal mining developments.<ref>{{cite web|first=/Jane|last=Hatcher|publisher=Durham in Time|title=Seaham Harbour its history and development Timeline|url=http://www.durhamintime.org.uk/Durham_Miner/Seaham_Harbour_Timeline.pdf|access-date=18 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721235620/http://www.durhamintime.org.uk/durham_miner/seaham_harbour_timeline.pdf|archive-date=21 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Neal, Leo & Neal|publisher=Wynyard Hall Publishing|title=Wynyard Hall|isbn=9780957011403|year=2011|pages=81–89}}</ref> The Marquis built his business interests using the inherited wealth of his wife Francis Anne. The Marquis also built one of the country's finest country houses in the region as a palace for his family and his royal connections. It is called [[Wynyard Park, County Durham|Wynyard Hall]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Neal, Leo & Neal|publisher=Wynyard Hall Publishing|title=Wynyard Hall|isbn=9780957011403|year=2011}}</ref>

London was one of the places which received coal from the area and there are references to shipments of coal being sent to the capital, for example 526 cauldrons of coal from Tyneside to London in 1376 for smiths involved in building Windsor Castle. Before the growth of mining companies the coal from the North East was often sent to London using monks. The coal was often called sea coal because it often washed up from undersea outcrops on the Northumbrian coast. This could explain the name Se-coles Lane in London.<ref name="Mining in Northeast England" /> It also led to the colloquial phrase "[[taking coals to Newcastle]]", meaning why take something to a place that already has an excess of it.

Improvements in technology meant equipment could be built to go deeper than ever before. One example was the High Main seam at Walker Colliery on Tyneside, which became one of the deepest coal mines in the world, thanks to large engine cylinders which helped drain the mine.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Access to Mineral Heritage|title=Minerals and the Industrial Revolution:Coke to iron to mine pumps to railways|url=http://mininghistory.thehumanjourney.net/edu/IndustrialRevolution.shtml|access-date=18 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220170833/http://mininghistory.thehumanjourney.net/edu/IndustrialRevolution.shtml|archive-date=20 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other mining developments from this region include water level and ventilation techniques introduced by John Buddle who also helped to introduce the [[miner's safety lamp]] which was invented here by [[George Stephenson|Stephenson]] and [[Humphry Davy|Davy]].

[[File:Wearmouth Colliery, miners in cage.jpg|thumb|150px|Miners in the cage ready for their descent, Monkwearmouth Colliery, 1993.]]
Sir Humphry Davy, after contemplating a communication he had received from Reverend Dr [[Robert Gray (bishop of Bristol)|Robert Gray]] Rector of [[Bishopwearmouth]] (later Bishop of Bristol) regarding the problem of gas in mines, took up the challenge of solving the problem of providing light in "[[Firedamp|fire-damp]]" ridden collieries. He started the work with several days of discussions with John Buddle, the overseer at Wallsend Colliery, other colliery owners and finally the Reverend John Hodgson, Vicar of Jarrow. Davy also collected samples of "fire-damp" before returning to his laboratory in London. Two designs of his lamps emerged and were tested at the most hazardous pits in the country, then at Newcastle-upon- Tyne and [[Whitehaven]] in [[Cumberland]], and were a resounding success. He later published his paper on "The safety lamp for coal mines and some researches on flame" in 1818, which made underground coal mines much more safe. George Stephenson a colliery engineer at Killingworth Main Colliery also invented a safety lamp which was successfully tested on 21 October 1815. This became known as the "Geordie" lamp. As a result, some in the Northeast then tried to challenge the delivery of some Ceremonial Plate to Davy but the Davy Lamper's won the day and on 25 September 1817 a dinner service as presented to Davy from the coal owners at the Queen's Head in Newcastle. Davy declined to take out a patent on his lamp design effectively giving it to the nation and the world's coal miners.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raymond|last=Lamont-Brow|publisher=Sutton|title=Humphry Davy Life Beyond the Lamp|isbn=0750932317|pages=125–136|year=2004}}</ref>

The moment when the new safety lamp was first tested was recorded by John Buddle in a report from the Select Committee on Accidents in Mines on 4 September 1835 "I first tried the lamp in an explosive mixture on the surface; and then took it to the mine; it is impossible for me to express my feelings at the time when I first suspended the lamp in the mine and saw it red hot. I said to those around me: "We have at last subdued this monster [fire-damp]." With some describing it as one of the most significant moments in the industrialization of the world."<ref>{{cite book|first=Raymond|last=Lamont-Brow|publisher=Sutton|title=Humphry Davy Life Beyond the Lamp|isbn=0750932317|page=131|year=2004}}</ref>

As an example of the many coal mines (colloquially known as pits) that were created in the Northeast's Monkwearmouth Colliery (or Wearmouth Colliery) was a large deep pit that went out under the [[North Sea]]. It was located on the north bank of the [[River Wear]] and was the largest pit in Sunderland and one of the most important in [[County Durham]]. The mine opened in 1835 and was the last to remain operating in the Durham Coalfield, with the last shift leaving the pit on 10 December 1993 and ending over 800 years of commercial underground coal mining in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/colliery/w001.htm|title=Wearmouth Colliery|publisher=Durham Mining Museum|access-date=7 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103140509/http://www.dmm.org.uk/colliery/w001.htm|archive-date=3 January 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Colliery site has been cleared to make way for the Sunderland A.F.C's [[Stadium of Light]] which opened in July 1997. The mine is commemorated by a large sculpture of a miners lamp at the entrance to the stadium.

The [[Durham Coalfield]] remains a national resource for the UK economy today and for the future. Most of the mines in the region were closed during the years of UK Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] (see [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)]]) however several large open cast coal mines are still operational in the region.

Today companies like Five-Quarter are investigating the use of the latest technology for underground [[coal gasification]] to access the Durham Coalfield reserves. Professor Paul Younger of [[Newcastle University]] in 2011 reported<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Sunderland University|title='Coal Exploitation in the North East' Lecture|url=http://www.sunderland.ac.uk/newsevents/events/event/index.php?eid=473|access-date=18 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102074131/http://www.sunderland.ac.uk/newsevents/events/event/index.php?eid=473|archive-date=2 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> that "Around 75 per cent of the coal in the North East is still underground, even though we have been mining it on an industrial scale longer than anyone else in the world. Previously a lot of this coal was too deep for conventional mining, or too far off shore. Even today this resource this could never be exploited by conventional means, but the technology to harness that resource has now become cost effective." Accessing these reserves is of particular importance to the local chemical industry.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steven|last=Hugill|newspaper=Northern Echo|title=Dr Stan Higgins, from Nepic, says fracking could cut energy bills|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/business/news/10512464.Chemical_body_leader_welcomes_Government_shale_gas_plans/|date=27 June 2013|access-date=18 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102083806/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/business/news/10512464.Chemical_body_leader_welcomes_Government_shale_gas_plans/|archive-date=2 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Iron and steel===
[[File:John Marley, mining engineer (1823-1891).jpg|thumb|150px|John Marley, discoverer of the Cleveland Ironstone which led to the enormous growth of the iron industry in the North East of England]]
Before 1846 Walbottle, Elswick, Birtley, Ridsdale, Hareshaw, Wylam, Consett, Stanhope, Crookhall, Tow-Law and Witton Park all had iron works<ref name="This is Middlesbrough">{{cite web|publisher=This is Middlesbrough|title=Iron & Steel in Middlesbrough's History|url=http://www.thisismiddlesbrough.com/history/Iron_Steel_in_Middlesbroughs_History.asp|access-date=20 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613100803/http://www.thisismiddlesbrough.com/history/Iron_Steel_in_Middlesbroughs_History.asp|archive-date=13 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> but the discovery of a rich seam of iron ore to the south of the region gradually drew iron and steel manufacture towards Teesside.
In 1850 iron ore was discovered in the [[Cleveland Hills]] near [[Eston]] to the south of Middlesbrough and Iron gradually replaced coal as the lifeblood of Eston. The ore was discovered by geologist [[John Marley (geologist)|John Marley]] and first utilised by John Vaughan, the principal [[ironmaster]] of Middlesbrough who along with his German business partner Henry Bolckow had already established a small iron foundry and rolling mill using iron stone from Durham and the Yorkshire coast, with the new discovery prompting them to build Teesside's first blast furnace in 1851.<ref name="This is Middlesbrough"/> Many more iron works followed, such as those built in the region by [[Losh, Wilson and Bell]] (see Sir Issac [[Lowthian Bell]]) who in 1853 were operating 5 furnaces in the region.[[File:Bell Ironworks at Port Clarence Teesside watercolour by John Bell (1814-1886).jpg|thumb|150px|Watercolour painting of the Bell Ironworks under construction at [[Port Clarence]], by John Bell, c. 1853]]

The success of John Vaughan and Henry Bolckow's first blast furnace meant that by 1873 Middlesbrough was producing 2 million tonnes of pig iron a year. Iron was in big demand in Britain in the late 19th century, particularly for the rapid expansion of the railways. More and more blast furnaces were opened in the vicinity of Middlesbrough to meet this demand such that by the end of the century Teesside was producing about a third of the nation's iron output.<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|publisher=BBC|title=Where I Live: Jobs threat:strong foundations|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tees/features/steel/history.shtml|access-date=22 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111195815/http://www.bbc.co.uk/tees/features/steel/history.shtml|archive-date=11 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Middlesbrough, which became known by its nickname "[[Ironopolis]]", was visited in 1862 by then prime minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] who said "This remarkable place, the youngest child of England's enterprise, is an infant, but if an infant, an infant Hercules"
By the 1870s steel, a much stronger and more resilient metal, was in big demand and Middlesbrough had to compete with Sheffield as the major producer. In 1875 Bolckow and Vaughan opened the first Bessemer Steel plant in Middlesbrough and the River Tees then become known as  "The Steel River"<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Simpson|publisher=Northern Echo|title=Steel River: Two Thousand Year Journey Along the River Tees|isbn=1899432051|year=1996}}</ref> leaving its old nickname "Ironopolis" behind. In 1881 [[Hugh Reid (Liberal politician)]] described how "The iron of Eston has diffused itself all over the world. it furnishes the railways of the world; it runs by neapolitan and papal dungeons; it startles the bandit in his haunt in cicilia; it crosses over the plains of Africa; it stretches over the plains of India. it has crept out of the Cleveland Hills where it has slept since Roman days, and now like a strong and invincible serpent, coils itself around the world"<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Middlesbrough Council|title=Middlesbrough History|url=http://www.lovemiddlesbrough.com/visitor-info/middlesbrough-history|access-date=20 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812071032/http://lovemiddlesbrough.com/visitor-info/middlesbrough-history|archive-date=12 August 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

By 1929 the great depression began to effect Britain and the famous name of Bolckow-Vaughan merged with neighbour Dorman-Long & Co. who then became Britain's biggest iron and steel maker and employed 33,000 people. In 1954 the post-war boom saw Dorman-Long build a state of the art steelworks at Lackenby and then new blast furnaces at Clay Lane. 1967 saw Dorman-Long become part of the nationalized British Steel Corporation as production boomed in Britain and in 1979 the largest blast furnace in Europe was erected at BSC's new Redcar plant. This plant which was subsequently acquired and operated by Chorus, Tata Steel and then Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI) who are still the plant operating today.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Journal|title=Teesside steelworks boost UK economy|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/business/business-news/teesside-steelworks-boost-uk-output-5262531|date=23 July 2013|access-date=20 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307184749/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/business/business-news/teesside-steelworks-boost-uk-output-5262531|archive-date=7 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====British Steel Industrial Archive====
The British Steel Collection, now housed at [[Teesside University]], contains the records of over forty iron and steel companies based in the Teesside area of the North East of England and covers the period c. 1840–1970. The history of Teesside and its rapid growth during the 19th century is directly linked to the expansion of the railways from Darlington and Stockton towards the mouth of the Tees estuary and the subsequent discovery of ironstone in the Cleveland Hills which attracted iron companies to the area. The British Steel Collection archives the company records of iron and steel companies such as [[Bolckow Vaughan|Bolckow & Vaughan]], [[Bell Brothers]], [[Cochrane & Co. Ltd.]], [[Dorman Long|Dorman, Long & Co. Ltd.]], [[South Durham Steel & Iron Co. Ltd.]], [[Cargo Fleet Iron Company]] and [[Skinningrove Steelworks|Skinningrove Iron Co.

===Shipbuilding===

[[Shipbuilding]] was once one of this region's largest industrial sectors. Ships were built on the [[River Wear]] at Sunderland from at least 1346 and on the [[River Tees]] at Stockton from at least 1470,<ref name="Shipbuilding 1790 to 1899">{{cite web|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/Shipbuilding.html|first=David|last=Simpson|publisher=NortheastEngland.co.uk|title=Shipbuilding 1790 to 1899|access-date=19 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830124025/http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/Shipbuilding.html|archive-date=30 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  with the Northeast of England more generally being the birthplace of some of the world's greatest vessels. This was recognised in 2013 with the regions shipbuilding heritage and global impact being recognized by [[UNESCO]] and placed on their [[Memory of the World Register]], ranking the regions shipbuilding heritage alongside iconic items such as the Domesday Book in terms of historical importance.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tony|last=Henderson|newspaper=Northern Echo|title=North East shipbuilding heritage wins international recognition|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/north-east-shipbuilding-heritage-wins-4888693|date=9 July 2013|access-date=19 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719221039/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/north-east-shipbuilding-heritage-wins-4888693|archive-date=19 July 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Wood to iron and steel====
The early ships were built of wood but in the 19th century there was a move towards building ships of iron then steel.  Ships were built across the region, especially along [[Tyneside]] in Jarrow and [[Wearside]] in Sunderland and also in smaller ports like Blyth, [[Whitby]] and Hartlepool. Sunderland's early development was due to coal but it later transitioned to become the largest shipbuilding town in the world<ref>{{cite book|last=Brett & Clark|publisher=Black Cat Publications|title=Sunderland-the biggest shipbuilding town in the world|isbn=1899560971|date=3 November 2009}}</ref> giving the town its fame. The first recorded shipbuilder was Thomas Menville at [[Hendon, Tyne and Wear|Hendon]] in 1346.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=British Broadcasting Corp|title=Shipbuilding on Wearside|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wear/content/image_galleries/shipbuilding_on_wearside_gallery.shtml?8|access-date=19 August 2013}}</ref> By 1790 Sunderland was building around nineteen ships per year making it the most important shipbuilding centre in the United Kingdom. By 1840 there were 65 shipyards such that over 150 wooden vessels were built at Sunderland in 1850. At this time 2,025 shipwrights worked in the town and some 2,000 others were employed in related industries. Sunderland's first iron ships were built from 1852 and wooden shipbuilding ceased here in 1876. Sunderland shipbuilders included Austin and Son, William Pickersgill and William Doxford.<ref name="Shipbuilding 1790 to 1899"/>

It was between 1790 and 1805 that Thomas Haw of Stockton began building ships for the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Shipbuilding did not begin in Middlesbrough until 1833 when a wooden sailing ship called ''The Middlesbro''' was built. Teesside's first iron ship was built in Thorneby in 1854, it was a screw steamer called ''The Advance'', and Teesside's first steel ship was ''Little Lucy'' built in 1858. One famous Teesside-built ship was the {{convert|377|ft|m|adj=on}} long ''Talpore'', built by Pearse and Co of Stockton in 1860. It was a [[troop ship]] for the River Indus, and was the world's largest river steamer at the time.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Betteney|publisher=Tees Valley Heritage group|title=Shipbuilding in Stockton and Thornaby|isbn=9780954631901|date=1 December 2003}}</ref> An archive of the ships built on Teesside has been created,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Teesside Ship Society|title=Shipbuilding on the River Tees|url=http://www.teesbuiltships.co.uk/|access-date=19 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823143943/http://www.teesbuiltships.co.uk/|archive-date=23 August 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> In Hartlepool Thomas Richardson of Castle Eden and John Parkin of Sunderland established a shipyard at Old Hartlepool in 1835 and built The Castle Eden ship. The shipbuilding company of William Gray was established here in 1862 and Gray became one of the most influential men in the town. He was the first mayor of West Hartlepool in 1887. William Gray shipbuilders won the Blue Ribband prize for maximum output in 1878, 1882, 1888, 1895, 1898 and 1900. The yard closed in 1961.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Hartlepool Mail|title=History of Ship Building in Hartlepool|url=http://www.thisishartlepool.co.uk/ships|access-date=19 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917165614/http://www.thisishartlepool.co.uk/ships|archive-date=17 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>
[[File:Mauritania (ship) (between 1906 and 1914).jpg|thumb|left|RMS ''Mauretania'' on its Tyneside builder's ways before launch in 1906]]
On Tyneside, [[Charles Mark Palmer]], born in [[South Shields]], established a yard at Jarrow in 1851 and built its first iron collier, ''The John Bowes'', in the following year. It was the first ever seagoing screw collier and was built for John Bowes of Barnard Castle for shipping coal to London. Palmer was also famed for building the first rolled armour plates for [[warship]]s in 1854. William Smith and Co launched the 1,600-ton ''Blenheim'' in 1848. W. G. Armstrong, the famous northern engineer, acquired an interest in the Tyneside shipbuilding firm of Mitchells in 1882, and the company of [[W.G. Armstrong|W. G. Armstrong]], Mitchell and Co was formed. The yard built [[battleship]]s as well as a ship called ''Gluckauf'', which was arguably the world's first oil tanker. It was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] by the yard in 1886. Scotsman Charles Mitchell started building ships at Walker-on-Tyne in 1852 and purchased a {{convert|6.5|acre|adj=on}} site at [[Wallsend]] in 1873 to soak up excess orders from his Walker shipyard. The new yard failed financially and was handed to his brother-in-law Charles Swan. Charles and his brother Henry were directors of the Wallsend Slipway Company, a repair yard established by Mitchell in 1871. In 1878 Charles arranged a partnership with Sunderland shipbuilder George Hunter, but in 1879 Charles died after falling overboard from a channel steamer whilst returning from the Continent with his wife. Hunter went into temporary partnership with Swan's wife before becoming Managing Director in 1880. [[Swan Hunter Shipyard|Swan Hunters]] built their first steel ship at Wallsend in 1884 and their first oil tanker in 1889.

Most early ships built at the Swan Hunter yard were smaller, like colliers and barges, but in 1898 it built its first [[ocean liner]], ''Ultonia,'' with a further 21 liners being built between 1898–1903. The most famous ship ever launched there was undoubtedly {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|2}}, a transatlantic ocean liner that launched on 20 September 1906. The ship was {{convert|790|ft|m|adj=on}} long, with a [[Beam (nautical)]] of 88&nbsp;ft (27 m) and a [[gross register tonnage]] of 31,938 tons. It carried 2,000 passengers on its [[maiden voyage]] on 16 November 1907 and won the [[Blue Riband]] for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic, a record held for 22 years.<ref name="Shipbuilding 1790 to 1899"/>

====Maritime innovation====
A major pioneering innovation in marine engineering was the steam turbine, invented by [[Charles Algernon Parsons]]. He patented the first steam turbine on Tyneside in 1884. Parsons, born in Ireland in 1854, was the youngest son of the [[Earl of Rosse]] and a keen inventor, who was a junior partner in the Tyneside engineering firm of Clarke Chapman. In 1894 Parsons' Marine Turbine Company launched {{ship||Turbinia}}, the first ship to be powered by electric turbines. She can be still be seen (and boarded) at the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Tyne & Wear Archives and Museums|title=Discovery Museum Collections Summary|url=http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/discovery/collections.html|access-date=20 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728054722/http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/discovery/collections.html|archive-date=28 July 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

====20th-century decline====
Shipyard closures in the 20th century took place during economic slumps and occurred in two phases, between 1909–1933 and 1960–1993. Early closures included Smiths Dock at [[North Shields]] in 1909, which became a ship repair yard, Armstrongs of Elswick in 1921, Richardson Duck of Stockton (1925), Priestman's of Sunderland (1933) and Palmers of Jarrow and [[Hebburn]] (1933). There were 28 North East closures in this period of which 14 were on the Tyne, 7 on the Wear, 6 on the Tees and 1 at Hartlepool. Six shipyards closed in the 1960s including W.Gray of Hartlepool (1961), Short Brothers of Sunderland (1964) and The Blyth Shipbuiding Company (1966). There were five closures in the region in the 1970s including the Furness yard at Haverton Hill, near Stockton, in 1979.<ref name="Shipbuilding 1790 to 1899"/>

====James Cook====
[[File:Captainjamescookportrait.jpg|thumb|James Cook, portrait by Nathaniel Dance-Holland circa 1775, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.]]
The region was home to [[Captain James Cook]], who sailed his ship ({{HMS|Endeavour}}) from [[Whitby]] to discover and name for the western world the [[Antipodes|antipodean]] continents and islands as well as many islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

====Science and engineering====
The coal and shipbuilding industry that once dominated the North East suffered a marked decline during the second half of the 20th century. [[Tyneside]] is now re-inventing itself as an international centre of art, culture and through [[Centre for Life|The Centre For Life]], [[science|scientific]] [[research]], especially in [[healthcare]] and [[biotechnology]]. [[Newcastle University]] is now a leading institution in the development of [[stem cell]] technology being the first in the United Kingdom and the second institution in Europe to obtain a licence to do such work.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Green light for stem cell clones|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/aug/12/sciencenews.genetics|access-date=22 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212062748/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/aug/12/sciencenews.genetics|archive-date=12 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> As with the rest of the region, Sunderland suffered economic decline during the last century, but is now becoming an important area for [[quaternary industry]], bioscience, computing and [[high technology|high]] tech industries. The economy of Sunderland is now dominated by the [[Nissan Sunderland|Nissan]]'s European car manufacturing facility and supply chain which is also leading that company's development of [[electric vehicles]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Adrian|last=Pearson|publisher=The Journal|title=Nissan plans its expansion of Sunderland plant|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/nissan-plans-expansion-sunderland-plant-5759091|access-date=22 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823054242/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/nissan-plans-expansion-sunderland-plant-5759091|archive-date=23 August 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The economy of Teesside continues to be largely based on the [[petrochemical]], [[commodity chemicals|commodity chemical]] and [[Steel industry|steel industries]] that form a significant part of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC), but newer industries such as offshore engineering and [[digital computing]], particularly in the field of [[Game design]], have emerged from Teesside University.<ref>{{cite news|first=Martin|last=Walker|publisher=BDaily|title=Cash approved for £4.2m Teesside digital centre|url=https://bdaily.co.uk/creative/20-08-2013/cash-approved-for-42m-teesside-digital-centre/|access-date=22 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821075011/https://bdaily.co.uk/creative/20-08-2013/cash-approved-for-42m-teesside-digital-centre/|archive-date=21 August 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Northumberland]], although largely rural and an important tourist location with its castles, beaches, and history has a nationally significant concentration of pharmaceutical manufacturing companies around Cramlington and Prudhoe.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Arch Corporate Holdings|title=Invest in Northumberland – Key sectors|url=http://www.archnorthumberland.co.uk/invest-in-northumberland/key-sectors/|access-date=22 August 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214051736/http://www.archnorthumberland.co.uk/invest-in-northumberland/key-sectors/|archive-date=14 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The county has also seen a huge investment into the creation of the UKs largest reservoir, [[Kielder Water]], enabling the Northeast to attract more industry.

Today, the members of the [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] (NEPIC) represent about one third of the regional industrial economy. The NEPIC is constituted by commodity chemical, [[petrochemical]], [[speciality chemical]], [[pharmaceutical]], [[biotechnology]], [[polymer]], [[renewable material]] and [[renewable energy]] companies and the associated supply chains. The Teesside industry is located on three large chemical sites at [[Wilton, Redcar and Cleveland|Wilton]], [[Billingham]] and [[Seal Sands]] at the mouth of the River Tees and [[Teesport]], the third largest port in the UK and the tenth in Western Europe and is important logistical infrastructure supporting the commodity chemical and steel members of NEPIC. In the 21st century [[PD Ports]], owners of Teesport, have been developing it as a Port Centric Logistical Centre. This strategy has seen a number of significant importing and distribution facilities for the north of the UK being built here, including distribution centres for the distribution operations of Asda/Walmart and Tesco supermarket chains.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=PD Ports|title=PD Ports Aims to Make Logistics More Logical|url=http://www.pdportcentriclogistics.co.uk/pd-ports-aims-to-make-logistics-more-logical/|access-date=22 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714171140/http://www.pdportcentriclogistics.co.uk/pd-ports-aims-to-make-logistics-more-logical/|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

NEPIC has two offices in the region: one in the north in Sunderland, serving the pharmaceutical and speciality chemical industries on Tyneside and in south Northumberland, and one in the south at [[Wilton International|Wilton]] near Redcar, serving the commodity chemical and steel industry of Teesside and operating amongst several process sector and supply chain companies that work out of the process industry research centre, The Wilton Centre, one of Europe's largest technical development laboratory facilities.

===Innovations===
This region has a strong history in technological innovation:

The [[match|friction match]] was invented in Stockton-on-Tees in 1826 by [[John Walker (inventor)|John Walker]].

[[George Stephenson]] (9 June 1781 – 12 August 1848) was an English civil engineer and mechanical engineer who built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use steam locomotives. Renowned as the father of railways<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stocktonteesside.co.uk/history.html|title=History of Stockton on Tees|access-date=27 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230902/http://www.stocktonteesside.co.uk/history.html|archive-date=2 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> George Stephenson was born in Wylam, Northumberland, 9.3 miles (15.0&nbsp;km) west of Newcastle upon Tyne.

[[Joseph Swan|Sir Joseph Wilson Swan]] (31 October 1828 – 27 May 1914) was a British physicist and chemist from Sunderland, County Durham now the (City of Sunderland). He is most famous for inventing an [[incandescent light bulb]] before its invention by the American [[Thomas Edison]]. Swan first demonstrated the light bulb at a lecture the [[Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne|Literary and Philosophical Society]] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20140429234959/https://www.mininginstitute.org.uk/aboutus/ Miners Institute] on [[History of Newcastle upon Tyne|Mosley Street]], Newcastle upon Tyne on 18 December 1878.

[[File:Turbinia At Speed.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''Turbinia '']]

[[Charles Algernon Parsons]] invented the steam turbine in 1884, and having foreseen its potential to power ships he set up the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company with five associates in 1893. To develop this he had the experimental vessel {{ship||Turbinia}} built in a light design of steel by the firm of Brown and Hood, based at [[Wallsend on Tyne]]. He also pioneered in the field of [[electricity generation]], establishing the [[Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company]] in 1889. The company opened the first power station in the world to generate electricity using [[turbo generator]]s in 1890, at [[Forth Banks Power Station|Forth Banks]] in Newcastle.

[[William George Armstrong]], 1st Baron Armstrong, CB, FRS (26 November 1810 – 27 December 1900) was an effective Tyneside industrialist who founded the Armstrong Whitworth manufacturing empire. He was responsible for the development of the hydraulic crane and many military armaments. His house at [[Cragside]], Northumberland was the first in the world to be lit by [[hydro-electricity]], using [[incandescent lamps]] provided by the inventor [[Joseph Swan]].

In 1936 the first commercially viable production of acrylic safety glass, [[Perspex]], began by ICI Acrylics and the material is still manufactured in the region by [[Lucite|Lucite International]] now part of [[Mitsubishi Corporation]]. During the Second World War acrylic glass was used for submarine periscopes, windshields, canopies, and gun turrets for airplanes.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=eNotes|title=Acrylic Plastics|url=http://www.enotes.com/acrylic-plastic-reference/acrylic-plastic|access-date=26 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520121541/http://www.enotes.com/acrylic-plastic-reference/acrylic-plastic|archive-date=20 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Shortages in raw materials and price pressures have led to innovation by Lucite who developed their patented Alpha Technology in this region. This technology is now the leading technology used in the manufacture of acrylics around the world. It uses new feedstock's and has a cost advantage of 40% over conventional processing methods.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Chemsystems|title=PERP Program – Methyl Methacrylate|url=http://www.chemsystems.com/about/cs/news/items/0004.cfm|access-date=26 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820180723/http://www.chemsystems.com/about/cs/news/items/0004.cfm|archive-date=20 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Newcastle University]] was the first in the UK and the second in Europe to receive a licence to perform research on stem cells and is a leading centre for such research today. Dr [[Karim Nayernia]] was the first to isolate spermatagonial stem cells at this University. Many new healthcare developments have arisen from this stem cell expertise in the region.

Today the region has five universities with a number of research departments:
[[Durham University]], Newcastle University, [[Northumbria University]], [[University of Sunderland]] and Teesside University, which have a portfolio of many innovative businesses that have spun out of their research and teaching departments.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=spinouts UK|title=University Listings|url=http://www.spinoutsuk.co.uk/listings/university-listings/|access-date=29 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504115124/http://www.spinoutsuk.co.uk/listings/university-listings/|archive-date=4 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Tees ===
[[File:Industrial Teesside - geograph.org.uk - 1709361.jpg|thumb|[[The BOC Group|BOC]] plant on Teesside]]
[[Teesport]] on the River Tees is the third biggest port in the country in terms of tonnage shipped, largely due to the local steel and chemical industries. [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) operated here until the late 1990s on three chemical sites at Wilton, Billingham and Seal Sands. ICI was broken up, and its many chemical manufacturing units are now operated by a large number of companies that have acquired its assets. The Centre for Process Innovation (CPI), a national innovation catapult{{clarify|date=June 2017}}, is based at the Wilton Centre, the former corporate headquarters of ICI, which has become a multi-company research and development centre: along with CPI there are now some 60 other companies, including the cluster body NEPIC, using these R&D and business development facilities. This centre is now one of Europe's largest R&D facilities focusing on developments in the chemistry-based process industries. The area is a chemicals processing area, but recently it has diversified to become the UK's leading site for renewable [[Biofuel in the United Kingdom|biofuel]] research. This industrial activity is taking place in a collaborative environment facilitated by the economic cluster body, the North East of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC).

Hartlepool has a [[Hartlepool nuclear power station|nuclear power station]], and there is a conventional [[Wilton Power Station|CHP power station]] and a biomass power station operated by [[Sembcorp]] on the Wilton chemical site.[https://web.archive.org/web/20130731173915/http://hfg.heerema.com/content/yards/heerema-hartlepool-uk/ Hereema Fabrication Group] make North Sea platforms at the A1048/[[A179 road|A179]] roundabout in Hartlepool.

Darlington formed in 1861 (re-formed 1883 and in 2012) and West Hartlepool of 1881 became [[Hartlepool United]] in 1908. In 1888 Sunderland and Middlesbrough were troubled by rival break-away teams called Sunderland Albion and Middlesbrough Ironopolis, both of which were lost before the 20th century began. Sunderland won the league championship three times in the 1890s and Newcastle United were first division champions three times in the early 1900s, reaching the FA Cup Final three times before winning it at the fourth attempt in 1910.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Simpson|title=Sport in the North East 1700 to 1999|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/Sport.html|access-date=21 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209010448/http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/Sport.html|archive-date=9 February 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>
Today top quality professional football remains in the northeast of England. In 2017 - 18 season Newcastle United is a [[Premier League]] team, whilst Middlesbrough and Sunderland are in the [[Football League Championship]], Hartlepool and [[Gateshead FC]] compete in the [[National League (division)|National League]]. [[St James' Park]] in Newcastle, the [[Stadium of Light]] in Sunderland and [[Riverside Stadium|The Riverside Stadium]] in Middlesbrough are all first class football venues often used for international games at all levels.

====First "world cup" winners and influential amateurs====
Amateur and semi-professional football clubs like [[Bishop Auckland F.C.|Bishop Auckland]] and [[Blyth Spartans A.F.C.]] have had success and public attention through [[FA Cup|Football Association Cup]] runs, but the most famous achievement was by [[West Auckland Town FC]] in 1910: they were invited to take part in a competition in Italy to compete for what was then labelled the soccer World Cup. West Auckland won the competition against some of Europe's biggest sides; they defeated the mighty [[Juventus]] 2-0 in the final. They even successfully defended the title the following year. The first world cup trophy played for in these tournaments, [[Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy]], has an interesting history of its own. In January 1994 the trophy, which was being held in West Auckland Working Men's Club, was stolen and never recovered. An exact replica of the original trophy was commissioned and is now held by West Auckland FC. The story of West Auckland's success was made into a film called "A Captain's Tale", starring actor [[Dennis Waterman]] as club captain Jones.

Players from some of the region's minor league teams have gone on to influence football on the world stage. [[Jack Greenwell]] (John Richard Greenwell), an ex-coal miner who played non-league football for [[Crook Town A.F.C.]] from 1901 to 1912, went to Spain and played 88 games for Barcelona before becoming their manager in 1917. Mr Greenwell's achievements at Barcelona include winning five Catalan championships and two [[Copa del Rey|Copas del Rey]]. He also managed Espanyol, Mallorca and Valencia. On the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he moved to South America to manage the Peruvian and Colombian national teams; he died in 1942 in [[Bogotá]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Duncan|last=Leatherdale|newspaper=Northern Echo|title=Barcelona Jack's granddaughter returns to her roots in Crook|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/10719118.Barcelona_Jack_s_granddaughter_returns_to_her_roots_in_Crook/|date=5 October 2013|access-date=8 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114142502/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/10719118.Barcelona_Jack_s_granddaughter_returns_to_her_roots_in_Crook/|archive-date=14 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Notable footballers associated with the region====
There are many notable footballers from the Northeast of England. Sunderland's [[Alf Common]] became the world's first £1,000 player when he was signed by Middlesbrough in 1905.<ref>{{cite news|first=Keith|last=Proud|newspaper=The Northern Echo|title=The Player with the Common Touch|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/columnists/memories/teesside/3603267.The_player_with_the_Common_touch_/|date=18 August 2013|access-date=7 September 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211095605/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/columnists/memories/teesside/3603267.The_player_with_the_Common_touch_/|archive-date=11 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Other pre Second World War and immediate post war greats were [[Charlie Buchan|Charles Buchan]], who created and edited the iconic magazine "Football Monthly",<ref>{{cite book|first=Charles|last=Buchan|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|title= A lifetime in Football|isbn=9781845966546|year=1956}}</ref> [[George Camsell]], [[Hughie Gallacher]], [[Wilf Mannion]], [[Raich Carter]], [[Bob Gurney]] all of whom are described in a famous book by the "Clown Prince of Football" [[Len Shackleton]].

Great players of the 1980s and 1990s include local born internationals like [[Peter Beardsley]], [[Paul Gascoigne]], [[Chris Waddle]] and [[Alan Shearer]]. Shearer remains the highest scoring player in Premier League history with 260 goals in 441 appearances.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Premier League 2013|title=Player profile: Alan Shearer|url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/players/profile.career-history.html/alan-shearer|access-date=21 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108105549/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/players/profile.career-history.html/alan-shearer|archive-date=8 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In the early 2000s Middlesbrough also joined the top clubs in English Football and played for a number of years in the Premier League and winning the League Cup in 2004. The Brazilian "[[Juninho Paulista]]" was an influential player for Middlesbrough during their time in the top flight, a time when the [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] football academy became famous for producing a number of young top flight players such as [[Stewart Downing]], [[James Morrison (footballer)|James Morrison]], [[Lee Cattermole]], [[Adam Johnson (footballer)|Adam Johnson]]<ref>{{cite news|first= Philip|last= Tallentire|title= Agree with this top 5 graduates from Middlesbrough FC's Rockliffe Park Academy?|publisher= GazetteLive|date= 6 November 2016}}</ref> and, more recently, [[Ben Gibson]].<ref>{{cite news|first= Philip|last= Tallentire|title= 'Be like Ben Gibson': Middlesbrough Academy boss David Parnaby's advice for Dael Fry|publisher= GazetteLive|date= 25 March 2017}}</ref>

===Horse racing===
Early races were mentioned in 1613 at [[Woodham, County Durham|Woodham]] near Aycliffe and were held at Newcastle's Killingworth Moor from 1632 before moving to the Town Moor. The 'Pitmen's Derby' or [[Northumberland Plate]] was held from 1833 and moved to [[Gosforth]] in 1882. Georgian races were held at places like [[Barnard Castle]], [[Bishop Auckland]], [[Blaydon]], [[Chester-le-Street]], [[Darlington]], Durham, Gateshead, [[Hebburn]], [[Heighington, County Durham|Heighington]], [[Lanchester, County Durham|Lanchester]], [[Ryton, Tyne and Wear|Ryton]], Sedgefield, South Shields, Stockton-on-Tees, Sunderland, [[Tanfield, Durham|Tanfield]], [[Whickham]] and [[Witton Gilbert]].

====Blaydon Races====
The [[Blaydon Races]], a popular musical hall song first sung by Geordie Ridley at Balmbra's Music Hall in Newcastle in 1862, gives an idea of some of the characters attending the old meetings. These races were held on an island in the middle of the Tyne and were last held on 2 September 1916. A riot broke out after the winning horse was disqualified, and the event was discontinued. It is remembered in the famous English folk song The Blaydon Races, and the event and its characters are vividly depicted in William Irving's 1903 painting. 'The Blaydon Races – A Study from Life' which is on show at the [[Shipley Art Gallery]] in Gateshead.

===Golf===
Golf is a Scottish import to many countries but it is said to have been played in this region by [[St Cuthbert]] on the dunes of the Northumberland coast.

The North East's main arterial carriageway is the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]], which mirrors the East Coast Main Line's course.  In County Durham this road is of [[motorway]] standard and is known as the [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]], and in March 2018 a section of A1(M) was opened between [[Barton, North Yorkshire|Barton]] and [[Leeming Bar]] in [[North Yorkshire]] providing a continuous link to the motorway network in the rest of England. However, the A1 is still an all-purpose road in Tyne and Wear and Northumberland, and is controversially still single carriageway north of [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]], despite being the main trunk route connecting [[Edinburgh]] and Newcastle upon Tyne and having a terrible safety record.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

A second north-south dual carriageway link is provided by the [[A19 road|A19]] which heads north from [[Thirsk]] (accessed via the A168 from the A1(M) at Dishforth), serving [[Teesside]], [[Peterlee]] and [[Sunderland]] before heading through the [[Tyne Tunnel]] to meet the A1 at [[Seaton Burn]]. The Tyne Tunnel was opened as a single-carriageway in 1967, with a second tunnel opening in February 2011 for dual-ing.

The [[A1 (Newcastle upon Tyne)|course of the A1 through Tyne and Wear]] has changed twice during the late 20th century. Originally passing through the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne then, in 1977, it was re-routed to the east of the city through the Tyne Tunnel. In 1993 a second rerouting occurred, along Newcastle Western Bypass, west of the city. Each of these resulted in standing roads to be renumbered, the A1 [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|forms the boundary]] and roads between beginning with 1 and 6.

The [[A66 road|A66]] (Tees Valley) and [[A68 road|A68]] (often following the [[Roman road]] [[Dere Street]]) are cross-country roads over the [[North Pennines]].  The [[A69 road|A69]] heads west along the Tyne Valley to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] in [[Cumbria]].

The ferry terminal at [[North Shields]] is accessed via the A187 from the Tyne Tunnel. [[DFDS]] operate two ferries a day to [[Amsterdam]] and, formerly, one a day on the [[Stavanger]] – [[Haugesund]] – [[Bergen]] route.

===Air===
The two main airports are [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle Airport]], located north of the city near [[Ponteland]], and [[Teesside International Airport]], located east of Darlington.

The region's population is served by a charitable service known as the [[Great North Air Ambulance]] for those who need rapid transfer to a hospital or medical assistance in difficult or remote locations.

===Transport policy===
{{update section|date=May 2020}}
Long term planning for transport in the region has involved the development of sub regional strategies. This planning also needs to take into account region wide transport schemes such as those carried out by the [[Highways Agency]] and [[Network Rail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gos.gov.uk/gone/transport/rts/?a=42496|title=Regional Transport Strategy: the National Picture|publisher=Government Office for the North East|access-date=7 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809114435/http://www.gos.gov.uk/gone/transport/rts/?a=42496|archive-date=9 August 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> These activities in the United Kingdom now fall into the remit of the [[Local enterprise partnerships|Local Enterprise Partnerships]] (LEPs) which in the Northeast of England are [https://web.archive.org/web/20131002185100/https://www.teesvalleyunlimited.gov.uk/ Tees valley Unlimited] and the [http://www.nelep.co.uk/ North East LEP].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=UK Government|title=Written Statement to Parliament on Local transport body funding allocations|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/local-transport-body-funding-allocations|date=16 July 2013|access-date=23 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901153108/https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/local-transport-body-funding-allocations|archive-date=1 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Bodies such as the Northeast Chamber of Commerce (NECC) and the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) are providers of significant practical insights to policy makers.<ref>{{cite paper|publisher=North East Chamber of Commerce|title=Northeast Business Transport Priorities January 2013|date=January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite paper|publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers|title=State of the Nation 2013, North East Transport|url=http://www.ice.org.uk/getattachment/9acd4612-5e4e-4a29-b95a-ea797d7a5191/State-of-the-Nation-Transport-ICE-North-East.aspx|access-date=23 August 2013}}</ref>

==Education==
{{Main|Lists of schools in England#North East of England}}

===Primary===
There are over 250 nursery/primary schools in the County Durham area of the north east, which range from schools with their own nursery, to schools that are either infant only or junior only.<ref>http://www.ouston-jun.durham.sch.uk/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030062102/http://www.ouston-jun.durham.sch.uk/ |date=30 October 2011 }} Junior schools in North East</ref> Areas such as [[Gosforth]] have first schools which have neither years 5 nor 6, and therefore educate children up to the age of 8 and 9.

===Secondary===
[[File:Hummersknott School, Edinburgh Drive - geograph.org.uk - 137046.jpg|thumb|[[Hummersknott School]] near Darlington]]
The North East education system consists largely of [[comprehensive school]]s, but a number of private and independent schools are found in Newcastle, Sunderland, Durham, Darlington, Stockton and in particular, Northumberland.

in 2014 a number of the regions schools were in the top 20%  of schools as measured by SSAT — the UK organisation for school improvement and collaboration — and have been awarded an SSAT Educational Outcomes Award recognising their successes. These schools are Burnside Business & Enterprise College, in Newcastle, Castle View Enterprise Academy, in Sunderland, Emmanuel College, in Gateshead, Greenfield Community College, in Newton Aycliffe, Northumberland Church of England Academy, in Ashington and The North Durham Academy in Stanley.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ruth|last=Lognonne|title=Region's schools ranked among top 20% in the country by the SSAT|publisher=The Journal|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/ssat-ranks-north-east-schools-7247154|date=11 June 2014|access-date=18 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140614132628/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/ssat-ranks-north-east-schools-7247154|archive-date=14 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The awards, recognised high attainment and outstanding continuous improvement.

The schools in the top 20% for high attainment in GCSE exams were Burnside Business and Enterprise College and Northumberland Church of England Academy

The region's secondary school attendance is the lowest in England at around 125,000, with the next lowest in the [[East Midlands]]. [[Truancy]] at its schools is a mixed picture. It has the second highest overall rate for urban areas, after [[Yorkshire and the Humber]], but the lowest rate in England in its rural areas. Middlesbrough has the region's highest rate with 7.2% persistent truants, which is the second highest rate in England after Manchester (7.3%). Next is Newcastle upon Tyne, with 6.4%, then the former district of [[Wansbeck]], with 6.3%

At [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) level, the region's performance is similar to that of other largely urban areas, although its results are generally below the national average. Middlesbrough tends to perform the worst, and to produce results well below the national average. [[Local education authority|Local education authorities]] (LEAs) in the North East have improved at GCSE in recent years. North Tyneside performed the best in 2011, followed by Gateshead, Northumberland, and Darlington. No LEA in the North-East was above the 2011 national GCSE average. South Tyneside was the lowest for the [[English Baccalaureate]], followed by Middlesbrough and Hartlepool. Gateshead and North Tyneside were the highest, and Gateshead was the only LEA above the national average for this measure.

The region's [[parochial school]]s tend to perform better at GCSE. These include [[St Thomas More Catholic School, Blaydon|St Thomas More Catholic School]] in [[Blaydon]], the selective independent state school [[Emmanuel City Technology College]] in Gateshead, [[All Saints C of E School]] in [[Ingleby Barwick]], [[English Martyrs School and Sixth Form College]] in Hartlepool, [[St Bede's Catholic School and Sixth Form College]] in [[Lanchester, County Durham]], and the [[Carmel RC Technology College]] in Darlington. Other regional schools that perform well include [[Whitley Bay High School]], Marden High School in Cullercoats, the [[Macmillan Academy]] in Middlesbrough, [[Park View School (Chester-le-Street)|Park View School]] in Chester-le Street, and the [[Hurworth School]] near Darlington. Many area schools do not have a sixth form, especially in Teesside, Sunderland and South Tyneside, but all Northumberland schools have a sixth-form along with a [[Three-tier education|three-tier system]] of education. Middlesbrough and Newcastle have the most students who pass no GCSEs.

North East LEAs at A-level are improving, but produce results below those of other areas of England. Sunderland performed the best in 2011, with consistently good results, followed by Hartlepool and Darlington, which are above the national average, and unrepresentative of most areas in the North East. Darlington's [[Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College]] is one of the highest-rated colleges in England. The area's [[Catholic school]]s all do reasonably well at A level. Stockton-on-Tees, Redcar, and Cleveland and Newcastle were also above England's average. Newcastle does significantly better at A-level than at GCSE, with consistent improvement, while Gateshead does much worse at A-level than GCSE, and produced the second lowest A-level results in the region in 2009. The worst results at A-level were from Middlesbrough, Durham, South Tyneside and Gateshead. South Tyneside had in previous years been consistently the region's worst performing LEA at A-level.

[[Dame Allan's Schools]], [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle|Royal Grammar School]] (NRGS), [[Barnard Castle School]] and [[Durham School]] are all members of [[The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]]. The [[Central Newcastle High School]] and the Royal Grammar School were named as among the nation's top 100 independent schools in 2006. Durham School is considered to be one of the oldest schools in the UK, and its Old Boys were the founding members of the original [[Newcastle Falcons]] Rugby club. [[Mowden Hall School]], a selective day and boarding [[Preparatory school (UK)|prep school]] in Northumberland, is another independent school. In the region, school children from Northumberland are most likely to attend university, followed by Stockton on Tees and North Tyneside.

===College===
[[File:QESFC.jpg|thumb|left|[[Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College|QE Sixth Form College]] in Darlington]]
There are sixteen further education colleges in the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skillsnortheast.co.uk |title=North East Skills – The Skills, Trades and Expertise from Leeds to Newcastle |publisher=Skillsnortheast.co.uk |access-date=7 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525210844/http://skillsnortheast.co.uk/ |archive-date=25 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The main such colleges are [[East Durham College]], [[Newcastle College]], [[New College Durham]], [[Darlington College]], [[Gateshead College]], [[Bishop Auckland College]], [[Stockton Riverside College]], [[Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College]], [[Hartlepool College of Further Education]], [[Middlesbrough College]], Cleveland College of Art and Design and [[Sunderland College]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===University===
[[File:Old Quad, Newcastle University, 5 September 2013.jpg|alt=|thumb|Newcastle University]]
At the [[higher education]] level the North East contains a number of universities. This includes [[Durham University]], which is the third oldest in England and is often ranked among the ten leading UK universities, [[Newcastle University]], a member of the [[Russell Group]] and a leading research university, and the newer universities of [[Northumbria University]], [[University of Sunderland]] and [[Teesside University]], which was voted Best University in the United Kingdom at the 2009 Times Higher Education awards.

Over 50% of the region's students come from the region, and around 35% are from other regions. At first degree level, around 55% are from the North of England, and about 30% are from the North East. More students come from elsewhere than leave the North East for other regions. Of students native to the region, 80% study in the North of England, with [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] more popular than the [[North West England|North West]], and around 55% study in the North East. The region has a higher proportion of students from so-called low participation neighbourhoods, as compared to elsewhere in England. Durham University has the least from these neighbourhoods. Northumbria University has the most students, followed by Teesside University.

Almost 60% of graduates stay in the region, while 10% go to Yorkshire and another 10% go to London. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence}} Both areas are accessible via the [[East Coast Main Line]].
