==History==

===Founding===
The House of Dior was established on 16 December 1946 <ref>[https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/christian-dior "Christian Dior"], by Bibby Sowray, ''Vogue'' magazine, April 5, 2012</ref> <ref name="dior">[http://www.dior-finance.com/en/historique.asp Company History at Dior's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107025618/http://www.dior-finance.com/en/historique.asp |date=7 November 2008 }}</ref> at 30 [[Avenue Montaigne]] in Paris. However, the current Dior corporation celebrates "1947" as the opening year.<ref name="dior"/> Dior was financially backed by wealthy businessman [[Marcel Boussac]].<ref name="dior"/><ref name="funding">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Christian-Dior-SA-Company-History.html|title=History of Christian Dior S.A.|work=fundinguniverse.com|access-date=18 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017050509/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Christian-Dior-SA-Company-History.html|archive-date=17 October 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> Boussac had originally invited Dior to design for [[Philippe et Gaston]], but Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather than reviving an old brand.<ref name=pochna>{{cite book |last1=Pochna |first1=Marie-France |last2=Savill|first2=Joanna (translator) |title=Christian Dior : the man who made the world look new |date=1996 |publisher=Arcade Pub.

Nevertheless, Dior was allowed a then-unusual great part in his namesake label (legal leadership, a non-controlling stake in the firm, and one-third of pretax profits) despite Boussac's reputation as a "control freak". Dior's creativity also negotiated him a good salary.<ref name="funding"/>

On 12 February 1947, Christian Dior launched his first fashion collection for Spring–Summer 1947.

The silhouette was characterised by a small, nipped-in waist and a full skirt falling below mid-calf length, which emphasised the bust and hips, as epitomized by the 'Bar' suit from the first collection.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Golden Age of Couture – Exhibition Highlights: 'Bar' Suit & Hat – Christian Dior|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/1486_couture/exhibHighBarSuit.php|publisher=Victoria & Albert Museum|accessdate=13 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125061114/http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/1486_couture/exhibHighBarSuit.php|archive-date=25 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>"Christian Dior: "Bar" suit" (C.I.58.34.30_C.I.69.40) In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History .

The New Look became extremely popular, its full-skirted silhouette influencing other fashion designers well into the 1950s, and Dior gained a number of prominent clients from Hollywood, the United States, and the European aristocracy. As a result, Paris, which had fallen from its position as the capital of the fashion world after WWII, regained its preeminence.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/events/how-haute-couture-rescued-war-torn-paris/ |title=How Haute Couture rescued war torn Paris |first=Anne |last=Sebba |date=29 June 2016 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=11 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212091359/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/events/how-haute-couture-rescued-war-torn-paris/ |archive-date=12 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="hcn">{{cite news |url=http://www.hautecouturenews.com/2015/story/christian-dior/ | title=Revolutions in Fashion: Christian Dior |first=Lucy |last=Zotoff |publisher=Haute Couture News |date=25 December 2015 |accessdate=11 February 2017}}</ref> The New Look was welcomed in western Europe as a refreshing antidote to the austerity of wartime and de-feminizing uniforms, and was embraced by stylish women such as [[Princess Margaret]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orderofsplendor.blogspot.com/2012/02/flashback-friday-fabulous-princess.html|title=The Royal Order of Sartorial Splendor: Flashback Friday: The Fabulous Princess Margaret|work=orderofsplendor.blogspot.com|access-date=10 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302080813/http://orderofsplendor.blogspot.com/2012/02/flashback-friday-fabulous-princess.html|archive-date=2 March 2012|url-status=live|date=10 February 2012}}</ref> According to [[Harold Koda]], Dior credited [[Charles James (designer)|Charles James]] with inspiring The New Look.<ref name="The Costume Institute Previews 'Charles James: Beyond Fashion'">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/the-costume-institute-previews-charles-james-beyond-fashion-7437029?src=n/newsAlert/20140211-3 |title=The Costume Institute Previews 'Charles James: Beyond Fashion' |publisher=WWD |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=12 February 2014 |author=Feitelberg, Rosemary |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226054834/http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/the-costume-institute-previews-charles-james-beyond-fashion-7437029?src=n%2FnewsAlert%2F20140211-3 |archive-date=26 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Dior's designs from the "New Look" did not only affect the designers in the 1950s, but also more recent designers in the 2000s, including Thom Browne, Miuccia Prada, and Vivienne Westwood.

Not everyone was pleased with the New Look, however.

Available references contradict themselves whether ''[[Christian Dior Parfums]]'' was established in 1947 or 1948. The Dior corporation itself lists the founding of Christian Dior Parfums as 1947, with the launch of its first perfume, ''Miss Dior''.<ref name="dior"/> Dior revolutionized the perfumery industry with the launch of the highly popular ''Miss Dior parfum'', which was named after Catherine Dior (Christian Dior's sister).<ref name="dior"/> Christian Dior Ltd owned 25%, manager of Coty perfumes held 35%, and Boussac owned 40% of the perfume business, headed by Serge Heftler Louiche.<ref name="dior"/> [[Pierre Cardin]] was made head of the Dior workshop from 1947 until 1950.

===Expansion, and death of Dior===
[[File:Buenos Aires - Eva Perón de gala en fundación del Teatro Colón.jpeg|right|thumb|upright=.91|[[Eva Perón]], the [[First Lady of Argentina]] and one of Dior's muses, wears a custom [[evening gown]] at the [[Teatro Colón]], 1949.]]
Expansion from France began by the end of 1949 with the opening of a Christian Dior boutique in New York City. By the end of the year, Dior fashions made up 75% of Paris's fashion exports and 5% of France's total export revenue.<ref name="funding"/>

In 1949, Douglas Cox from Melbourne, Australia, travelled to Paris to meet with Christian Dior to discuss the possibility of having Dior pieces made for the Australian market. Christian Dior and Douglas Cox signed a contract for Dior to produce original designs and for Douglas Cox to create them in his Flinders Lane workshop.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&dat=19490304&id=ErITAAAAIBAJ&pg=6152,4920691&hl=en|title=The Age – Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref> A young Jill Walker, still in her mid teens, was one of the many workers for Douglas Cox, a couture label now in the headlines in Australian newspapers almost daily. Jill would go onto forming a couture legacy in Melbourne with popular labels such as Jinoel and Marti with husband Noel Kemelfield.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/photographer-in-race-to-document-living-history-of-melbourne-fashions-of-the-1950s-20160601-gp92qu.html|title=Photographer in race to document 'living history' of Melbourne fashions of the 1950s|first=Melissa|last=Singer|date=4 June 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=28 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129010220/https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/photographer-in-race-to-document-living-history-of-melbourne-fashions-of-the-1950s-20160601-gp92qu.html|archive-date=29 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The agreement between Dior and Douglas Cox really put Australian dressmaking on the global stage, yet ultimately the 60 Dior models proved to be too avant-garde for the conservative Australian taste. Douglas Cox was unable to continue the contract beyond the single 1949 season making these Dior-Cox couture pieces some of the most rare collectors items in Australian couture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19490501&id=OB0QAAAAIBAJ&pg=7309,197990&hl=en|title=The Sydney Morning Herald – Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>

In 1950, Jacques Rouët, the general manager of Dior Ltd, devised a licensing program to place the now-renowned name of "Christian Dior" visibly on a variety of [[luxury goods]].<ref name="funding"/> It was placed first on neckties<ref name="dior"/> and soon was applied to hosiery, furs, hats, gloves, handbags, jewelry, lingerie, and scarves.<ref name="funding"/> Members of the [[French Chamber of Couture]] denounced it as a degrading action for the [[Haute couture|haute-couture]] image. Nevertheless, licensing became a profitable move and began a trend to continue "for decades to come",<ref name="funding"/> which all couture houses followed.<ref name="dior"/>

Also in 1950, Christian Dior was the exclusive designer of [[Marlene Dietrich]]'s dresses in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]''. In 1951, Dior released his first book, ''Je Suis Couturier'' (''I am a Couturier'') through publishers Editions du Conquistador. Despite the company's strong European following, more than half of its revenue was generated in the United States by this time.<ref name="funding"/> Christian Dior Models Limited was created in London in 1952.<ref name="dior"/> An agreement was made between the Sydney label [[House of Youth]] for Christian Dior New York models.<ref name="dior"/> [[Los Gobelinos]] in [[Santiago, Chile]], made an agreement with Dior for Christian Dior Paris Haute Couture.<ref name="dior"/> The first Dior shoe line was launched in 1953 with the aid of Roger Vivier. The company operated firmly established locations in Mexico, Cuba, Canada, and Italy by the end of 1953.<ref name="funding"/> As popularity of Dior goods grew, so did [[counterfeit]]ing.<ref name="funding"/> This illegal business was supported by women who could not afford the luxury goods.

By the mid-1950s, the House of Dior operated a well-respected fashion empire.<ref name="funding"/> The first Dior boutique was established in 1954 at 9 [[Counduit Street]]. In honour of [[Princess Margaret]] and the [[Frances Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Duchess of Marlborough]], a Dior fashion show was held at the Blemhein Palace in 1954 as well.

===Dior without Christian Dior: 1957 through the 1970s===
The death of the head designer left the House of Dior in chaos, and general manager Jacques Rouët considered shutting down operation worldwide. This possibility was not received graciously by Dior licensees and the French fashion industry; the Maison Dior was too important to the financial stability of the industry to allow such an action. To bring the label back on its feet, Rouët promoted the 21-year-old [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] to Artistic Director the same year.<ref name="funding"/> Laurent had joined the House's family in 1955 after being picked out by the original designer himself for the position of the first ever and only Head Assistant.<ref name="dior"/><ref name="funding"/> Laurent initially proved to have been the most appropriate choice after the debut of his first collection for Dior (the mention of ''Dior'' from this moment on refers to the company) in 1958.<ref name="funding"/> The clothes were as meticulously made and perfectly proportioned as Dior's in the same exquisite fabrics, but their young designer made them softer, lighter and easier to wear. Saint Laurent was hailed as a national hero. Emboldened by his success, his designs became more daring, culminating in the 1960 [[Beat poetry|Beat]] Look inspired by the [[existentialists]] in the [[Saint-Germain des Près]] cafés and jazz clubs. His 1960 [[bohemian]] look was harshly criticized, and even more in ''Women's Wear Daily''.<ref name="funding"/> Marcel Boussac was furious, and in the spring, when Saint Laurent was called up to join the French army—which forced him to leave the House of Dior—the Dior management raised no objection. Saint-Laurent left after the completion of six Dior collections.<ref name="dior"/>

Laurent was replaced at Dior by designer [[Marc Bohan]] in late 1960. Bohan instilled his conservative style on the collections. He was credited by Rebecca Arnold as the man who kept the Dior label "at the forefront of fashion while still producing wearable, elegant clothes," and Women's Wear Daily, not surprisingly, claimed that he "rescued the firm."<ref name="funding"/> Bohan's designs were very well esteemed by prominent social figures. Actress [[Elizabeth Taylor]] ordered twelve Dior dresses from Bohan's Spring-Summer 1961 collection featuring the "Slim Look". The Dior perfume "Diorling" was released in 1963 and the men's fragrance "[[Eau Sauvage]]" was released in 1966.<ref name="dior"/> Bohan's assistant Philippe Guibourgé launches the first French [[ready-to-wear]] collection "Miss Dior" in 1967. This is not to be confused with the already existing New York Ready-to-Wear store established in 1948. Designed by Bohan, "Baby Dior" opens its first boutique in 1967 at 28 Avenue Montaigne. The Christian Dior Coordinated Knit line is released in 1968 and management of the Fashion Furs Department of Christian Dior is taken by Frédéric Castet.<ref name="dior"/> This year as well, Dior Parfums was sold to [[LVMH|Moët-Hennessy]] (which would itself become [[LVMH]]) due to Boussac's ailing textile company (the still-owner of Dior).<ref name="dior"/><ref name="funding"/> This, however, had no effect on the House of Dior operations, and so the ''Christian Dior Cosmetics'' business was born in 1969 with the creation of an exclusive line.

Following this, Bohan launched the first ''Christian [[Dior Homme]]'' clothing line in 1970. A new Dior boutique at Parly II was decorated by Gae Aulenti and the "Diorella" perfume was released in 1972. Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Fur Collection was created in France in 1973, and then manufactured under license in the United States, Canada, and Japan.<ref name="dior"/> The first Dior watch "Black Moon" was released in 1975 in collaboration with licensee Benedom. Dior haute-couture graced the bodies of [[Princess Grace of Monaco]], Nicaraguan First Lady [[Hope Portocarrero]], [[Princess Alexandria of Yugoslavia]], and [[Lady Pamela Hicks]] ([[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]]'s younger daughter) for the wedding of [[The Prince of Wales]] and [[Lady Diana Spencer]]. In 1978, the Boussac Group filed for bankruptcy and so its assets (including those of Christian Dior) were purchased by the Willot Group under the permission of the [[Paris Trade Court]].<ref name="dior"/> The perfume "Dioressence" was released in 1979.<ref name="dior"/>

===Arrival of businessman Arnault===
[[File:DiorBohan1.JPG|right|thumb|upright=.69|A simple Dior Haute Couture evening gown designed by [[Marc Bohan]], from the Spring 1983 collection]]
In 1980, Dior released the men's fragrance "Jules".<ref name="dior"/> After the Willot Group went into bankruptcy in 1981, [[Bernard Arnault]] and his investment group purchased it for "one symbolic franc" in December 1984.<ref name="dior"/><ref name="funding"/> The Dior perfume "Poison" was launched in 1985. That same year, Arnault became chairman, chief executive officer, and managing director of the company.<ref name="dior"/> On assuming leadership, Arnault did away with the company's mediocre textile operations, to focus on the Bon Marché department store and Christian Dior Couture. Operations for Christian Dior drastically changed for the better under Arnault. He repositioned it as the [[holding company]] Christian Dior S.A. of the Dior Couture fashion business.<ref name="funding"/> On the 40th anniversary of Dior's first collection, the [[Paris Fashion Museum]] dedicated an exhibition to Christian Dior.<ref name="dior"/> In 1988, Arnault's Christian Dior S.A.'s took a 32% equity stake into the share capital of [[LVMH|Moët-Hennessy • Louis Vuitton]] through its subsidiary [[Jacques Rober]], creating what would become one of the leading and most influential [[luxury good]]s companies in the world. Under this milestone merger, the operations of Christian Dior Couture and Christian Dior Parfums were once again united. Italian-born [[Gianfranco Ferré]] replaced Bohan as head designer in 1989.<ref name="funding"/> The first such non-[[Frenchmen|Frenchman]], Ferré left behind traditional Dior associations of flirtation and romance, and introduced concepts and a style described as "refined, sober and strict."<ref name="funding"/> Ferré headed design for Haute Couture, Haute Fourrure, Women's Ready-to-Wear, Ready-to-Wear Furs and Women's Accessories collections. His first collection was awarded the [[Dé d'Or]] in 1989.<ref name="dior"/> That year, a boutique was opened in Hawaii and the LVMH stake by Jacques Rober rose to 44%.<ref name="dior"/>

Further Dior boutiques were opened in 1990 in upscale New York City, Los Angeles, and Tokyo shopping districts. The stake in LVMH rose again, to 46%.<ref name="dior"/> Another collection of watches named "Bagheera"&nbsp;– inspired by the round design of the "Black Moon" watches&nbsp;– was also released in 1990. Having fired the company's managing executive Beatrice Bongbault in December 1990, Arnault took up that position until September 1991, when he placed former Bon Marché president Phillipe Vindry at the post.<ref name="funding"/> In 1991, Christian Dior was listed on the spot market and then on the [[Paris Stock Exchange]]'s monthly settlement market, and the perfume "Dune" was launched.<ref name="dior"/> Vindry dropped ready-to-wear prices by 10%. Still, a wool suit from Dior would come with a price label of USD 1,500.<ref name="funding"/> 1990 revenue for Dior was USD 129.3&nbsp;million, with a net income of $22&nbsp;million.<ref name="funding"/> Dior was now reorganized into three categories: 1) women's ready-to-wear, lingerie, and children's wear 2) accessories and jewelry 3) menswear. Licensees and franchised boutiques were starting to be reduced, to increase the company's control over brand product. Licensing was in fact reduced by nearly half because Arnault and Vindry opted "for quality and exclusivity over quantity and accessibility."<ref name="funding"/> Wholly company-owned boutiques now opened in Hong Kong, Singapore, [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Cannes]], and [[Waikiki]], adding to its core stores located in New York City, Hawaii, Paris and [[Geneva]]. This held a potential to increase direct sales and profit margins while maintaining high-profile locations."<ref name="funding"/> In 1992, Dior Homme was placed under the artistic direction of Patrick Lavoix, and the "Miss Dior" perfume was relaunched.<ref name="dior"/> Francois Baufume succeeded Vindry in 1993 and continued to reduce licenses of the Dior name.<ref name="funding"/>
[[File:Grey leather and fur gloves by Christian Dior in box.jpg|left|thumbnail|Leather gloves by Christian Dior]]

The production of Dior Haute Couture was spun off into a subsidiary named ''Christian Dior Couture'' in 1995.<ref name="dior"/> Also, the "La Parisienne" watch model was released – embodied in the watch "Parisian Chic". By that year, revenue for the label rose to USD 177 million, with a net income of USD 26.9&nbsp;million.<ref name="funding"/> Under the influence of Anna Wintour, editor and chief of Vogue, CEO Arnault appointed British designer [[John Galliano]] to replace [[Gianfranco Ferré]] in 1997 (Galliano on [[CBS News]]: "without Anna Wintour I would certainly not be at the house of Dior").<ref name="dior"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/05/14/60minutes/main5013905.shtml | publisher=[[CBS News]] | title=Anna Wintour, Behind The Shades | date=14 May 2009 | access-date=4 November 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114061328/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/05/14/60minutes/main5013905.shtml | archive-date=14 November 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref> This choice of a British designer, once again instead of a French one, is said to have "ruffled some French feathers". Arnault himself stated that he "would have preferred a Frenchman", but that "talent has no nationality".<ref name="funding"/> He even compared Galliano to Christian Dior himself, noting that "Galliano has a creative talent very close to that of Christian Dior. He has the same extraordinary mixture of romanticism, feminism, and modernity that symbolised Monsieur Dior. In all of his creations – his suits, his dresses – one finds similarities to the Dior style."<ref name="funding"/> Galliano sparked further interest in Dior with somewhat controversial fashion shows, such as "Homeless Show" (models dressed in newspapers and paper bags) or "S&M Show".<ref name="funding"/> Meanwhile, Dior licenses were being reduced further by new president and CEO Sidney Toledano.<ref name="funding"/> On 15 October 1997, the Dior headquarters store on Avenue Montaigne was reopened&nbsp;–it had been closed and remodeled by [[Peter Marino]]&nbsp;– in a celebrity-studded event including [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Demi Moore]] and [[Jacques Chirac]]. That year, Christian Dior Couture also took over all thirteen boutique franchises from Japan's Kanebo.<ref name="dior"/>

In May 1998, another Dior boutique was opened in Paris. This time the store opened its doors on the Left Bank, Place Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Also this year, Victoire de Castellane became lead designer of ''Dior Fine Jewellery'' and the first Dior Fine Jewellery boutique opened in New York City. Paris itself would witness the opening of the first Parisian Dior Fine Jewellery boutique the following year, at 28 Avenue Montaigne.<ref name="dior"/> The perfume "[[J'Adore (fragrance)|J'adore]]" was released in 1999,<ref name="dior"/> and on 5 October 1999, Galliano released the Dior Spring-Summer 2000 ready-to-wear fashion show, debuting the new Saddle bag. In the same year, Dior's long watch partner Benedom joined the [[LVMH]] group. In 2000, Galliano's leadership was extended to Ready to wear, accessories, advertising and communications. The first campaign under his leadership was photographed by Nick Knight and featured two women simulating intercourse.

While other brands in the late 1990s, notably Gucci,<ref>[http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/2003-02/030227-toms-pubic-ad-avoids-ban.aspx Tom Ford's latest Gucci shocker is approved by the Advertising Standards Authority (Vogue.com UK)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611121641/http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/2003-02/030227-toms-pubic-ad-avoids-ban.aspx |date=11 June 2011 }}.

On 17 July 2000, [[Dior Homme]] lead designer [[Patrick Lavoix]] was replaced by [[Hedi Slimane]]. Notable Dior releases that year were watches such as the distinctive "Malice", which features bracelets made of "CD" links, as well as the "Riva". Hedi left Dior Homme in 2007 and replaced by [[Kris Van Assche]].

===21st century===
In 2001, the Dior Homme boutique on 30 Avenue Montaigne reopened with a new "contemporary masculine concept" instilled by its designer Hedi Slimane. Slimane used this concept in the creation of his first Dior Homme collection.<ref name="dior"/> Soon, Dior Homme gained prominent male clientele including [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Mick Jagger]].<ref name="funding"/>

John Galliano then began to release his own Dior watches in 2001, beginning with the "Chris 47 Aluminum" line, marking a new era in Dior watch design. Next, the "Malice" and "Riva" watches were redesigned with precious stones to create the "Malice Sparkling" and "Riva Sparkling" spin-off collections. Inspired by the Spring-Summer 2002 Ready-to-Wear collection, Dior released the "Dior 66" watch, breaking many feminine traditional expectations in design.

The men's fragrance "Higher" was released in 2001, followed by the perfume "Addict" in 2002. The company then opened [[Milan]]'s first Dior Homme boutique on 20 February 2002. By 2002, 130 locations were in full operation.<ref name="funding"/> On 3 June 2002, Slimane was presented with the "International Designer of the Year" award by the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America|CFDA]]. Until 2002, [[Kanebo]] was the Christian Dior [[ready-to-wear]] license holder in Japan and, when the license expired, Christian Dior was able to profitable directly sell its [[ready-to-wear]] and accessories in its own boutiques.<ref name="Luxury">{{cite book | title=Luxury Brand Management | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | author=Chevalier, Michel | year=2012 | location=Singapore | isbn=978-1-118-17176-9}}</ref> The "Chris 47 Steel" watch was released in 2003 as a cousin of the original "Chris 47 Aluminum". Bernard Arnault, [[Hélène Mercier-Arnault]], and [[Sidney Toledano]] witnessed the opening of the Dior flagship boutique in the [[Omotesandō]] district of Tokyo on 7 December 2003. The second Dior flagship store was opened in the upscale [[Ginza]] shopping district of Tokyo in 2004.<ref name="dior"/> An exclusive Dior Homme boutique was opened also that year in Paris on [[Rue Royale]], and it presented the entire Dior Homme collection. A second Dior Fine Jewelry boutique in Paris was opened at 8 Place Vendôme.<ref name="dior"/> A Christian Dior boutique was opened in Moscow after the company took control of licensed operations of its Moscow agent.<ref name="dior"/>

The designer of Dior Fine Jewelry Victoire de Castellane launched her own watch named "Le D de Dior" (French: "The D of Dior"). signifying the entrance of Dior watches into its collection of fine Jewelry. This watch was designed for women but made use of many design features which are typically thought of as masculine. Slimane next released a watch for the Dior Homme collection called "Chiffre Rouge." This special watch included the signature look of Dior Homme: "Watch design and technology match each other inseparably, to create the perfect expression of Dior Homme’s artistic excellence and to increase the watchmaking legitimacy of Dior timepieces." De Castellane then launched her second line of watches called "La Baby de Dior". The design for this line was meant to be more feminine with more of a "jewelry look."

The "Miss Dior Chérie" perfume and the "Dior Homme" fragrance were released in 2005.<ref name="dior"/> Galliano released his "Dior Christal" watches in which he combined steel and blue sapphires to create a "creative and innovative collection." Christian Dior S.A. then celebrated the 13th anniversary of Dior Watches in 2005, and, in April of that year, its "Chiffre Rouge" collection was recognized by the World Watches and Jewelry Show in [[Basel, Switzerland]]. Also in the year, the fashion house also celebrated the 100th anniversary of the birthday of designer Christian Dior.<ref name="dior"/> An exhibition, "Christian Dior: Man of the Century," was held in the Dior Museum in [[Granville, Normandy]].

In 2006, the Dior watch booth was dedicated to the Dior [[caneworking|Canework]]. This pattern was made by designer Christian Dior and based on the [[Napoleon III style|Napoleon III]] chairs used in his fashion shows.

In 2007, Kris Van Assche was appointed as the new artistic director of Dior Homme. Van Assche presented his first collection later that year.<ref name="dior"/> The 60th Anniversary of the founding of the Maison Dior was officially celebrated in 2007 as well.<ref name="dior"/>

By February 2011, the House of Dior was in scandal after accusations of John Galliano making anti-Semitic remarks made international headlines: the company found itself in a "public relations nightmare."<ref name="NYTjuly2"/> Galliano was fired in March and the scheduled presentation of his Fall-Winter 2011/2012 ready-to-wear collection went ahead without him, amid the controversy, on 4 March.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/04/dior-show-john-galliano_n_831290.html#248916|title=Dior Autumn/Winter 2011 Show Goes on Without John Galliano (PHOTOS)|date=4 March 2011|accessdate=7 July 2012|work=Huffington Post|first=Hilary|last=Moss|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823145047/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/04/dior-show-john-galliano_n_831290.html#248916|archive-date=23 August 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Before the start of the show, chief executive Sydney Toledano gave a sentimental speech on the values of Christian Dior and alluded to the family's ties to the [[Holocaust]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG8362214/Sidney-Toledanos-emotional-speech-at-Christian-Dior-show.html|title=Sidney Toledano's emotional speech at Christian Dior show|date=4 March 2011|accessdate=7 July 2012|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707172401/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG8362214/Sidney-Toledanos-emotional-speech-at-Christian-Dior-show.html|archive-date=7 July 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The show closed with the staff of the atelier coming out to accept applause in the absence of their artistic director.

=== Celebrity Ambassadors===

Dior has created strong partnerships with Hollywood celebrities and social media influencers, working closely with these individuals to reach more demographics and re-establish its identity as a new, modern brand, despite the fact that it has been around for a while.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Gucci's Digital Strategy Is Working|url=https://centricdigital.com/blog/digital-trends/why-guccis-digital-strategy-is-working/|website=Centric Digital|accessdate=15 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315134336/https://centricdigital.com/blog/digital-trends/why-guccis-digital-strategy-is-working/|archive-date=15 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> This has allowed the brand to portray a more populist image and attract a wider audience.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Mark|title=Luxury Brands and the Social Campaign|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/fashion/luxury-brands-and-the-social-campaign.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=18 March 2018|date=1 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730021507/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/fashion/luxury-brands-and-the-social-campaign.html|archive-date=30 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The brand has worked with and dressed contemporary style icons like [[Jennifer Lawrence]] and [[Lupita Nyong'o]], who may resonate with millennials.<ref>{{cite web|title=Red Carpet Retrospective: Dior|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/were-all-wearing-dior|website=Vogue|accessdate=16 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316214635/http://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/were-all-wearing-dior|archive-date=16 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Dior has effectively implemented social media into their marketing communication strategy, in which images and videos from campaigns are shared on both the official Dior profile, and on the celebrity ambassadors' social media pages.

An example of this success is seen in the Secret Garden campaign featuring [[Rihanna]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Here's Your First Look at Rihanna's Groundbreaking Dior Campaign|url=http://www.instyle.com/news/rihanna-christian-dior-secret-garden-campaign|website=InStyle.com|accessdate=18 March 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318120850/http://www.instyle.com/news/rihanna-christian-dior-secret-garden-campaign|archive-date=18 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In this campaign, Rihanna is seen dancing to a song from her album (''Only If For a Night'') through a hall of mirrors.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Iredale|first1=Jessica|title=Rihanna's 'Secret Garden' Campaign for Dior Set to Debut|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/rihanna-dior-secret-garden-campaign-10128811/|website=WWD|accessdate=18 March 2018|date=13 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318182814/http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/rihanna-dior-secret-garden-campaign-10128811/|archive-date=18 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> By being associated with Rihanna's song, the company created a sense of association with her brand, which was beneficial to the company as she was ranked as the most marketable celebrity in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Rihanna became the most brand savvy celebrity|url=https://www.wgsn.com/blogs/how-rihanna-became-the-most-brand-savvy-celebrity/#|website=wgsn.com/blogs|accessdate=18 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217201305/https://www.wgsn.com/blogs/how-rihanna-became-the-most-brand-savvy-celebrity/|archive-date=17 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite the reach not being completely suitable to the Dior target audience, collaborating with the likes of Rihanna allows the company to engage with more of the market, as Rihanna's social media following is four times larger than that of the fashion house.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

==Criticism==

In 2000, Galliano's collection inspired by homeless people drew criticism, but also attention, to the house of Dior.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/23/opinion/liberties-haute-homeless.html | work=The New York Times | first=Maureen | last=Dowd | title=Liberties; Haute Homeless | date=23 January 2000 | accessdate=8 March 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217040018/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/23/opinion/liberties-haute-homeless.html | archive-date=17 February 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref>

In early 2011, scandal arose when [[John Galliano]] was accused of making [[anti-semitic]] comments after drinking in Paris. Footage was released of the designer under the influence of alcohol saying "I love Hitler" and "People like you would be dead today. Your mothers, your forefathers would be fucking gassed and dead" to a Jewish woman.<ref name="nydailynews1">[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/02/28/2011-02-28_john_galliano_antisemitic_rant_caught_on_video_nicole_kidman_wore_dior_by_gallia.html John Galliano anti-Semitic rant caught on video; Slurs on camera 'I love Hitler'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302055230/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/02/28/2011-02-28_john_galliano_antisemitic_rant_caught_on_video_nicole_kidman_wore_dior_by_gallia.html |date=2 March 2011 }}.
