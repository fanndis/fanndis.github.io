'''Thomas Phillip''' "'''Tip'''" '''O'Neill Jr.''' (December 9, 1912&nbsp; – January 5, 1994) was an American politician who served as the [[List of Speakers of the United States House of Representatives|47th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] from 1977 to 1987, representing northern [[Boston, Massachusetts]], as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from 1953 to 1987. The only Speaker to serve for five complete consecutive Congresses, he is the third longest-serving Speaker in [[United States History|American history]] after [[Sam Rayburn]] and [[Henry Clay]] in terms of total tenure and longest-serving in terms of continuous tenure (Rayburn and Clay served multiple terms in the Speakership).

Born in [[North Cambridge, Massachusetts]], O'Neill began campaigning at a young age, volunteering for [[Al Smith]]'s campaign in the [[1928 United States presidential election|1928 presidential election]]. After graduating from [[Boston College]], O'Neill won election to the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]], where he became a strong advocate of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] policies. He became Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1949 and won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1952 to the seat vacated by [[John F. Kennedy]].

In the House, O'Neill became a protege of fellow Massachusetts Representative [[John William McCormack]]. O'Neill broke with President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on the [[Vietnam War]] in 1967 and called for [[Richard Nixon]]'s resignation in light of the [[Watergate scandal]]. He quickly moved up the leadership ranks in the 1970s, becoming House Majority Whip in 1971, House Majority Leader in 1973, and Speaker of the House in 1977. With the election of President [[Jimmy Carter]], O'Neill hoped to establish a [[Universal health care|universal health care system]] and a guaranteed jobs program. However, relations between Carter and Congress collapsed, and the Democrats lost control of the presidency in the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential election]]. O'Neill became a leading opponent of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s conservative domestic policies. O'Neill and Reagan found more common ground in foreign policy, fostering the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] and implementing the [[Reagan Doctrine]] (despite considerable opposition to Reagan's support for the [[Contras|Contras in Nicaragua]]) in the [[Soviet–Afghan War]].

O'Neill retired from Congress in 1987 but remained active in public life. He published a best-selling autobiography and appeared in several commercials and other media. He died of cardiac arrest in 1994.

==Early life and education==
O'Neill was the third of three children born to Thomas Phillip O'Neill and Rose Ann (née Tolan) O'Neill in the [[Irish-Americans|Irish]] middle-class area of [[North Cambridge, Massachusetts]], known at the time as "Old Dublin." His mother died when he was nine months old, and he was raised largely by a French-Canadian housekeeper until his father remarried when he was eight. O'Neill Sr. started out as a bricklayer, but later won a seat on the [[Cambridge City Council, Massachusetts#Government|Cambridge City Council]] and was appointed Superintendent of Sewers. During his childhood, O'Neill received the nickname "Tip" after the [[Canadian]] baseball player [[Tip O'Neill (baseball)|James "Tip" O'Neill]].<ref>Hodgson, G. (7 January 1994). [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-thomas-p-oneill-1405199.html Obituary: Thomas P. O'Neill]. ''[[The Independent]] (London)'', pp. 14.</ref> He was educated in [[Roman Catholic]] schools, graduating in 1931 from the now defunct St. John High School in Cambridge, where he was captain of the basketball team; he was a lifelong parishioner at the school's affiliated parish church [[St. John the Evangelist Church (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|St. John the Evangelist Church]]. From there he went to [[Boston College]], from which he graduated in 1936.

==Entry into politics==
{{see also|1949–1950 Massachusetts legislature}}
O'Neill first became active in politics at 15, campaigning for [[Al Smith]] in his [[1928 United States presidential election|1928 presidential campaign]]. Four years later, he helped campaign for [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. As a senior at [[Boston College]], O'Neill ran for a seat on the Cambridge City Council, but lost; his first race and only electoral defeat. The campaign taught him the lesson that became his best-known quote: "[[All politics is local]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/ulib/oneill_findingaid2.html |title=Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. Papers Biographical Note &#124; John J.

After graduating in 1936, O'Neill was elected at the age of 24 to the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]], aided by tough economic times among his constituents; the experience made him a strong advocate of the [[New Deal]] policies of Roosevelt, which were just then coming to an end. His biographer [[John Aloysius Farrell]] said his background in [[Great Depression in the United States|Depression-era]] working-class Boston, and his interpretation of his Catholic faith, led O'Neill to view the role of government as intervening to cure social ailments. O'Neill was "an absolute, unrepentant, unreconstructed New Deal Democrat," Farrell wrote.<ref name=last>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/03/11/reviews/010311.11cuomot.html|title=The Last Liberal|author=Cuomo, Mario|work=New York Times|date=11 March 2001|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref>

In 1949, he became the first Democratic [[Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives]] in its history. He remained in that post until 1952, when he ran for the United States House of Representatives from his home district.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
[[File:The Calvert Woodley.JPG|thumb|left|O'Neill's Washington, D.C. residence from 1964 to 1978]]

O'Neill was elected to the congressional seat vacated by [[United States Senator|Senator-elect]] [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1952. He would be reelected 16 more times, never facing serious opposition.  His district, centered around the northern half of Boston, was originally numbered as the 11th District, but became the 8th District in 1963.

During his second term in the House, O'Neill was selected to the [[United States House Committee on Rules|House Rules Committee]] where he proved a crucial asset for the Democratic leadership, particularly his mentor, fellow Boston congressman and later Speaker, [[John William McCormack]].<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1209.html |title=Thomas P.

After wrestling with the issues surrounding the [[Vietnam War]], in 1967 O'Neill broke with President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and came out in opposition to America's involvement.<ref name=last/> O'Neill wrote in his autobiography that he also became convinced that the conflict in Vietnam was a civil war and that US involvement was morally wrong. While the decision cost O'Neill some support among older voters in his home district, he benefited from new support among students and faculty members at the many colleges and universities there. In the House of Representatives itself, O'Neill picked up the trust and support of younger House members who shared his antiwar views, and they became important friends who contributed to O'Neill's rise through the ranks in the House.<ref name=nyt/>

In 1971, O'Neill was appointed [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Whip]] in the House, the number three position for the Democratic Party in the House. Two years later, in 1973, he was elected [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]], following the disappearance of a small plane carrying Majority Leader [[Hale Boggs]] and Congressman [[Nick Begich]] in Alaska. As Majority Leader, O'Neill was the most prominent Democrat in the House to call for the [[impeachment]] of President [[Richard M. Nixon]] in light of the [[Watergate scandal]].

==Speaker of the House==
[[Image:Gerald Ford and Tip O'Neill (cropped) - USNWR.jpg|thumb|left|O'Neill with President [[Gerald Ford]], 1976]]

As a result of the [[Tongsun Park]] influence-peddling scandal, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Carl Albert]] retired from Congress and O'Neill was elected Speaker in 1977, the same year [[Jimmy Carter]] became [[President of the United States|President]].

===Nursing home scandal===
Tongsun Park had not directly paid O'Neill, although Park's parties in his honor and a new scandal involving a nursing home O'Neill invested $5,000 in during a small business loan in violation of Federal law raised questions of impropriety, but did not prevent his re-election.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/09/archives/oneills-business-dealings-raise-questions-of-conflict-and-candor.html?th&emc=th | work=The New York Times | title=O'Neill's Business Dealings Raise Questions of Conflict and Candor | first=Wendell | last=Rawls | date=April 9, 1978 | accessdate=February 10, 2020}}</ref>

===Carter administration===
With substantial majorities in both houses of Congress and control of the White House, O'Neill hoped that Democrats would be able to implement Democratic-favored legislation, including [[universal health care]] and guaranteed jobs programs. The Democrats, however, lacked [[party discipline]], and while the Carter administration and O'Neill started out strong with the passage of ethics and energy packages in 1977, there were major stumbles. Troubles began with Carter's threats to [[presidential veto|veto]] a water projects bill, a pet project of many members of Congress. O'Neill and other Democratic leaders were also upset by Carter's appointments of a number of his fellow Georgians, whom O'Neill considered arrogant and parochial, to federal offices and White House staff.

O'Neill was also put off by Carter's frugal behavior in cutting executive staff and reducing the scale of White House entertaining. Carter, a Southern Baptist, even ended the practice of serving [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] other than beer and wine at the White House. As Carter's term began in early 1977, Democratic leaders on [[Capitol Hill]] were invited to the White House for a breakfast with the new President, where Carter served them sugar cookies and coffee. O'Neill, a man of expansive appetite, expected the until-then-traditional eggs and sausage. He looked across the table at Carter and said, "Mr. President... you know, we won the election." Carter was a reform-minded executive who often clashed with O'Neill on legislation. The Speaker wanted to reward loyal Democrats with rewarding projects at a time when Carter wanted to reduce government spending. A continuing weak economy and the [[Iran hostage crisis]] made prospects bleak for Carter and the Democrats in the 1980 [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1980|congressional]] and [[1980 United States presidential election|presidential]] elections.

===Reagan administration===
[[File:SpeakerO'Neill.jpg|thumb|Painting of O'Neill done in 1986]]
O'Neill was a leading opponent of the [[Reagan administration]]'s domestic and defense policies. Following the 1980 election, with the [[U.S. Senate]] controlled by Republicans, O'Neill became the leader of the congressional opposition. O'Neill even went as far as calling [[Ronald Reagan]] "the most ignorant man who had ever occupied the White House".<ref name=nyt/> O'Neill also said that Reagan was "[[Herbert Hoover]] with a smile" and "a cheerleader for selfishness." He also said that Reagan's policies meant that his presidency was "one big Christmas party for the rich." Privately, O'Neill and Reagan were always on cordial terms, or as Reagan himself put it in his memoirs, they were friends "after 6PM". O'Neill in that same memoir when questioned by Reagan regarding a personal attack against the President that made the paper, explained that "before 6PM it's all politics".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/29/washington/29rivals.html?th&emc=th | work=The New York Times | title=2008 May Test Clinton's Bond With McCain | first=Anne E. | last=Kornblut | date=July 29, 2006 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref> Reagan once compared O'Neill to the classic arcade game ''[[Pac-Man]]'' in a speech, saying that he was "a round thing that gobbles up money". He also once joked he had received a [[Valentine's Day|valentine card]] from O'Neill: "I knew it was from Tip, because the [[wikt:bleeding-heart|heart was bleeding]]."

O'Neill, however, gave tacit approval to Democratic Congressman [[Charlie Nesbitt Wilson]] to implement the [[Reagan Doctrine]] in the [[Soviet-Afghan war]]. Wilson's position on the appropriations committees, and his close relations with CIA officer [[Gust Avrakotos]], allowed him to steer billions of dollars to the [[Mujahideen]] through the CIA and [[Zia ul-Haq]]'s [[Inter Services Intelligence|ISI]].<ref name=crile>[[Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History]], [[George Crile III|George Crile]], 2003, Grove/Atlantic.</ref>

There was some contention about [[Amendment XXV of the United States Constitution|constitutional order of succession]], which involved O'Neill, when [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|Reagan was shot]] in March 1981. Then-Secretary of State [[Alexander Haig]] famously said he was "in control here," in response to a question as to who was in charge (with the president under anesthesia and Vice President [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush]] traveling), but it was later pointed out that O'Neill was next in line after Bush. Reagan was only under for a few hours, and no formal invocation of the line of succession took place.

===Northern Ireland===
One of O'Neill's greatest accomplishments as Speaker involved [[Northern Ireland]]. O'Neill worked with fellow Irish-American politicians [[New York Governor]] [[Hugh Carey]], [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Edward&nbsp;Kennedy]], and Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] to craft a peace accord between the warring factions. Beginning with the "[[Saint Patrick's Day]] declaration" in 1977, denouncing violence in Northern Ireland and culminating with the Irish aid package upon the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] in 1985, the "Four Horsemen" as they were called, convinced both Carter and Reagan to press the [[United Kingdom|British]] government on the subject.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/aia/exhibits/0501_hunger/support/genpro.htm | work = Irish People | title = Thatcher Attacks INA | date = 24 October 1981 | accessdate = 29 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Former-Gov-Hugh-Carey-of-New-York-passes-at-age-92--127219838.html | work = Irish Central | title = Former Gov.

==Post-speakership==
[[Image:Pelosi O'Neill.jpg|225px|thumb|O'Neill with Congresswoman (and future two-time Speaker) [[Nancy Pelosi]]]]

After retiring from Congress in 1987, O'Neill published his autobiography, ''Man of the House''. It was well received by critics, and became a national best-seller. The book also helped turn the former Speaker into a national icon, and O'Neill starred in a number of commercials, including ones for [[Trump Shuttle]], [[Commodore International|Commodore Computers]], Quality International Budget Hotels, and one for [[Miller Lite]], starring in one with [[Bob Uecker]].

In 1987 he received the [[Four Freedoms Award#Freedom Medal|Freedom Medal]].

On November 18, 1991, O'Neill was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>[http://bushlibrary.tamu.edu/research/public_papers.php?id=3642& Remarks on Presenting the Presidential Medal of Freedom Awards], George H. W. Bush. 18 November 1991.</ref>

Later on in retirement, O'Neill, who suffered from [[colon cancer]], made public service advertisements about cancer in which he joined athletes and movie stars in talking candidly about having the disease.

==In popular culture==
O'Neill's emergence as a cultural figure was not restricted to commercials. Four years before his retirement, he had a cameo role in the February 17, 1983, episode of ''[[Cheers]]'' entitled "No Contest", which featured him ducking into the bar to escape Diane Chambers who pestered him on the street about his political ideals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0539812/ |title=No Contest |website=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_96Wf-DZKHg |title=Cheers - Tip O'Neil |via=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref> The show, which was ranked 60th in the [[Nielsen ratings]] at that time, jumped 20 places the following week. He appeared in an  episode of the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Silver Spoons]]'', which featured him delivering a mock press conference praising recurring character Freddy Lippincottleman's efforts on behalf of the homeless.<ref>{{cite episode| title= Three Musketeers | date= December 15, 1985| season= 4 | number= 12| series= [[Silver Spoons]]| publisher= NBC}}</ref> O'Neill also made a brief appearance in the 1993 film ''[[Dave (film)|Dave]]'' as himself, assessing the work of the fictional American President in the movie. He also did narration for a segment of the [[Ken Burns]] series ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'' in which O'Neill, a lifelong [[Red Sox]] fan, read ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' from the day the Red Sox won the 1918 [[World Series]].

In the comic strip ''[[Shoe (comic strip)|Shoe]]'', the character Sen. Batson D. Belfry is modelled after O'Neill.

==Personal life==
O'Neill resided on 26 Russell Street in North Cambridge, although he had lived as a child around the corner on Orchard St. He had a vacation home on Woodland Rd. near Bank Street Beach in [[Harwich Port, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/ulib/oneill_findingaid2.html|title=Biographical Note &#124; Thomas P.

They had five children. His oldest son and namesake, [[Thomas P. O'Neill III]], a former [[Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts]], works in public relations in Boston. Another son, Christopher, is a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] lawyer. His third son, Michael, is deceased; daughter Susan has a business in Washington DC, and  the other daughter, Rosemary, is a political officer for the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].

In 1980, he was awarded the [[Laetare Medal]] by the [[university of Notre Dame]], considered the most prestigious award for [[American Catholics]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher= University of Notre Dame |url=https://laetare.nd.edu/recipients/#info1980 |title=Recipients {{!}} The Laetare Medal |accessdate=31 July 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

===Death and legacy===
[[File:Thomas Philip O'Neill Jr's grave.jpg|thumb|right|O'Neill's [[cenotaph]] at the [[Congressional Cemetery]], Washington D.C.]]

O'Neill died of [[cardiac arrest]] on January 5, 1994, survived by his wife and their children. At his passing, President [[Bill Clinton]] said: "Tip O'Neill was the nation's most prominent, powerful and loyal champion of working people... He loved politics and government because he saw that politics and government could make a difference in people's lives. And he loved people most of all." Millie died in 2003 and is buried near her husband, at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in [[Harwich Port, Massachusetts]].
