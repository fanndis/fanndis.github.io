{{ElectionsNY}}
In the [[United States Senate]] election held in the [[New York (state)|State of New York]] on November 7, 2000, [[Hillary Clinton]], then [[First Lady of the United States]] and the first First Lady to run for political office, defeated [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Rick Lazio]]. The general election coincided with the [[2000 United States presidential election|U.S. presidential election]].

The race began in November 1998 when four-term incumbent Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] announced his retirement. Both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] sought high-profile candidates to compete for the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and [[Mayor of New York City]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] were the likely respective nominees. Clinton and her husband, President [[Bill Clinton]], purchased a house in [[Chappaqua, New York]], in September 1999; she thereby became eligible for the election, although she faced characterizations of [[Carpetbagger|carpetbagging]] since she had never resided in the state before. The lead in statewide polls swung from Clinton to Giuliani and back to Clinton as the campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani's medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawal from the race on May 19.

The Republicans chose lesser-known U.S. Representative Rick Lazio to replace him. The election included a record $90&nbsp;million in campaign expenditures between Clinton, Lazio, and Giuliani and national visibility. Clinton showed strength in normally Republican upstate areas and a debate blunder by Lazio solidified Clinton's previously shaky support among women. Clinton won the election in November 2000 with 55&nbsp;percent of the vote to Lazio's 43&nbsp;percent. As of 2020, this is the last time a Republican earned more than forty percent of the vote in a New York Senate election.

=== Campaign ===
The contest drew considerable national attention and both candidates were well-funded. By the end of the race, Democrat Clinton and Republicans Lazio and Giuliani had spent a combined $90&nbsp;million,<ref name="nyt121300">{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E1DB133FF930A25751C1A9669C8B63 | title= Lazio Sets Spending Mark for a Losing Senate Bid | author=Clifford J.

While Clinton had a solid base of support in New York City, candidates and observers expected the race to be decided in upstate New York where 45 percent of the state's voters lived. During the campaign, Clinton vowed to improve the economic picture in upstate New York, promising that her plan would deliver 200,000 New York jobs over six years. Her plan included specific tax credits with the purpose of rewarding job creation and encouraging business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for targeted personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.<ref name="cnn110700">{{cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/07/senate.ny/ | title=Hillary Rodham Clinton scores historic win in New York | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | date=November 8, 2000 | access-date=December 17, 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212204213/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/07/senate.ny/ | archive-date=February 12, 2007 }}</ref>
Lazio faced a unique tactical problem campaigning upstate. The major issue there was the persistently weak local economy, which Lazio hoped to link to his opponent's husband's tenure in office. Attacks on the state of the upstate economy were frequently interpreted as criticism of incumbent Republican governor [[George Pataki]], however, limiting the effect of this line of attack.

In July 2000, the release of ''State of a Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton'' by author [[Jerry Oppenheimer]] led to reports that Clinton had called someone a "fucking Jew bastard" in 1974.<ref name="guard-fray">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/18/uselections2000.usa | title=Hillary faces voters' wrath for alleged ethnic slur | first=Michael | last=Ellison | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=July 17, 2000 | access-date=July 31, 2019}}</ref> The report, which received international media coverage, "rocked" Clinton's campaign, with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' describing the campaign as having "mounted a frantic damage limitation exercise after details of the alleged incident were leaked".<ref name="tele-fray">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1349202/Clinton-leaps-to-Hillarys-defence-over-Jewish-slur.html | title=Clinton leaps to Hillary's defence over 'Jewish slur' | first=Toby | last=Harnden | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=July 18, 2000 | access-date=July 31, 2019}}</ref> Clinton had reportedly screamed the insult at Paul Fray, who managed Bill Clinton's unsuccessful 1974 congressional campaign.<ref name="guard-fray"/> Fray, his wife, and another campaign staffer stated that they had heard Clinton's outburst, while both Clintons adamantly denied that she had referenced Fray's heritage<ref name="tele-fray"/> (while Oppenheimer wrote that Fray's father was Jewish,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/06/books/for-better-or-worse.html?searchResultPosition=5 | title=For Better or Worse | first=Emily | last=Eakin | work=[[The New York Times Book Review]] | date=August 8, 2000 | page=26 | access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref> in reality Fray was a Southern Baptist whose closest Jewish ancestor was a paternal great-grandmother).<ref name="guard-fray"/><ref name="nyt-fray"/>  Bill Clinton did allow that Hillary might have simply called Fray a "bastard".<ref name="guard-fray"/>  In media interviews, Fray and his wife acknowledged several factors that tended to undermine his credibility:  he had lost his license to practice law for altering court records; he had made false accusations against the Clintons in the past; and he had suffered a brain hemorrhage with some resultant losses of memory.<ref name="nyt-fray">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/20/nyregion/first-lady-s-aide-asked-help-on-slur-claim.html | title=First Lady's Aide Asked Help on Slur Claim | first=Randal C. | last=Archibold | newspaper=The New York Times | date=July 20, 2000 | page=B4 | access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref>

Opponents continued to make the carpetbagging issue a focal point throughout the race and during debates.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D9103CF93AA35753C1A9669C8B63 | title=Excerpts From Second Debate Between Mrs. Clinton and Lazio | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 9, 2000 | access-date=February 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Talk radio]] hammered on this, with New York-based [[Sean Hannity]] issuing a daily mantra, "Name me three things Hillary Clinton has ever done for the people of New York!"  Clinton's supporters pointed out that the state was receptive to national leaders, such as [[Robert F. Kennedy]] who was [[United States Senate election in New York, 1964|elected to the Senate in 1964]] despite similar accusations. In the end, according to exit polls conducted in the race, a majority of the voters dismissed the carpetbagging issue as unimportant.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/08/senate.wrap/index.html | title=Ashcroft concedes as GOP clings to Senate lead | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | date=November 8, 2000 | access-date=February 17, 2008 }}{{dead link | date=May 2016 | bot=medic}}{{cbignore | bot=medic}}</ref>

A September 13, 2000 debate between Lazio and Clinton proved important.  Lazio was on the warpath against [[soft money]] and the amounts of it coming from the [[Democratic National Committee]] into Clinton's campaign, and challenged Clinton to agree to ban soft money from both campaigns.

Late in the campaign Lazio criticised Clinton for accepting campaign donations from various Arab groups in the wake of the [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]].  The Lazio campaign orchestrated a wave of telephone calls to voters using this attack.<ref name="nyt-analysis"/>  This issue caused former New York Mayor [[Ed Koch]] to take out ads telling Lazio to "stop with the sleaze already,"<ref name="gvn-212"/> and did not change the dynamic of the race.  Some of Lazio's campaign strategists would later say that the ''Cole''-based attack had backfired and became the campaign's biggest blunder.<ref name="nyt-analysis"/>

Clinton won the election on November 7 with 55 percent of the vote to Lazio's 43 percent,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/2000senate.htm#NY | title=Federal Elections 2000: U.S. Senate results | publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]] | access-date=December 17, 2007}}</ref> a difference larger than most observers had expected.<ref name="nyt-analysis">{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E7D71638F93AA35752C1A9669C8B63 | title=First Lady Emerges From Shadow And Begins to Cast Her Own | author=[[Elisabeth Bumiller]], Dean E.

She won 13 of 61 counties, with surprising victories in Upstate counties, such as [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga]], [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer]], and [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]].  Overall, she lost Upstate to Lazio by only 3 percentage points, to which her win has been attributed.<ref name="nyt-analysis"/>

In comparison with other results, this 12 percentage point general election margin was smaller than Gore's 25 point margin over Bush in the [[United States presidential election in New York, 2000|state Presidential contest]], was slightly larger than the 10 point margin by which fellow New York senator [[Charles Schumer]] defeated incumbent Republican [[Al D'Amato]] in the hotly contested [[1998 United States Senate election in New York|1998 race]], but was considerably smaller than the 47 point margin by which Senator Schumer won reelection in [[2004 United States Senate election in New York|2004 race]] against little-known Republican challenger [[Howard Mills]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/1998/states/NY/S/index.html | title=Election Night 1998: New York | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | date=November 4, 1998 | access-date=December 17, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/vote2004/ny.htm | title=Kerry, Schumer win in New York | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[USA Today]] | date=November 3, 2004 | access-date=December 17, 2007}}</ref> The victory of a Democrat in the Senate election was not assured, because in recent decades the Republicans had won about half the elections for governor and senator.

New Square had voted almost unanimously for Hillary Rodham Clinton in the New York Senate race.

=== Hollywood fundraiser ===
[[file:Hillary Clinton and her largest donor Peter Paul.jpg|thumb|146px|right|Hillary Clinton with her largest 2000 contributor, Peter Paul, at the [[Gala Hollywood Farewell Salute to President Clinton]].]]

Hillary Clinton's former finance director, [[David Rosen (politics)|David Rosen]], was indicted on January 7, 2005 on campaign finance charges related to a fund-raising event produced by [[Peter F. Paul]].  Paul, a convicted drug dealer who would soon after be convicted on stock fraud charges after being extradited from Brazil, stated that he spent $1.2&nbsp;million to produce the August 12, 2000 [[Hollywood Gala Salute to President William Jefferson Clinton]] event, which was both a tribute to honor President Clinton and a fundraiser for the First Lady's 2000 Senate campaign. The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] indictment charged Rosen with filing false reports with the [[Federal Election Commission]] by reporting only $400,000 in contributions. On May 27, 2005, the jury acquitted Rosen on all counts.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050527/ap_on_re_us/clinton_fundraising_probe | title=~ Clinton Fundraising Probe | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher= [[Yahoo!

Peter Paul also filed a civil suit in this matter, ''[[Paul v. Clinton]]''.  On April 10, 2006, the judge in charge of the case removed Hillary Clinton as a defendant, citing a lack of evidence, but leaving open the possibility that she might still be called to testify as a witness in the case.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nysun.com/article/30698?access=709915 | title=Judge Drops Senator Clinton From Lawsuit | author=Josh Gerstein | newspaper=[[The New York Sun]] | date=April 10, 2006 | access-date=December 17, 2007}}</ref>  The removal was upheld by the [[California Courts of Appeal#Second District|California Second District Court of Appeal]] on October 16, 2007.<ref name="ap101607">{{cite news | url=http://www.wtop.com/?nid=213&sid=1270070 | title=Court Says Clinton Should Not Be in Suit | author=Greg Risling | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher= [[WTOP-FM|WTOP]] | date=October 16, 2007 | access-date=November 1, 2007}}</ref>

Meanwhile, by the time of [[Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign]], a 13-minute video produced by Paul and describing his various allegations against Hillary Clinton had become quite popular on the Internet, gaining 1.4&nbsp;million hits on [[Google Video]] and about 350,000 on [[YouTube]] in a single week in October 2007.<ref name="ap102907">{{cite news | url=http://www.sddt.com/News/article.cfm?SourceCode=20071030ft#.UJZh_YYpC_Q | title=Anti-Hillary Clinton video finding a niche on the Internet | author=Jim Kuhnhenn | agency=[[Associated Press]] | date=October 30, 2007 | access-date=November 4, 2012 | newspaper=[[San Diego Daily Transcript]]}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
Clinton's victory would establish her as an effective campaigner and an electoral force on her own, able to capture Republican and independent votes and overcome her polarizing image.<ref name="nyt110900an"/>  She would [[United States Senate election in New York, 2006|easily win re-election in 2006]], and in 2007 began [[Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|her presidential campaign for 2008]].

Lazio gave up his House seat to run for Senate.  Following his defeat, which set a record for the most money spent in a losing Senate effort,<ref name="nyt121300"/> he took positions in the corporate world and avoided electoral politics until becoming a candidate in [[New York gubernatorial election, 2010|New York's 2010 gubernatorial election]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://capitalnews9.com/region12content/top_stories/482987/lazio-expected-to-announce-candidacy-for-governor/ | title=Lazio announces candidacy for governor | publisher=[[Capital News 9]] | date=September 21, 2009 | access-date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>  However, he was defeated by a wide margin in the Republican primary.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/nyregion/28lazio.html | title=Lazio Leaves Race, Giving Reluctant Aid to a Rival | author=Halbfinger, David M. | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 27, 2010 | access-date=September 28, 2010}}</ref>

Giuliani would undergo treatment for his cancer and eventually recover; he would also divorce Donna Hanover and eventually marry Judith Nathan.  After his campaign withdrawal, his political future looked uncertain at best.<ref name="salon112707"/>  But less than a year after the senate general election, the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] took place, with Giuliani still mayor.  Giuliani's performance in the aftermath of September 11 earned him many accolades and resurrected his political prospects.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/11/08/skills_at_ready_when_crisis_struck/?page=full | author=Mooney, Brian C. | title=Skills at ready when crisis struck | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=November 8, 2007 | access-date=February 18, 2008}}</ref>  After a successful stint in the private sector, in 2007 he also began [[Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign, 2008|his presidential campaign for 2008]].

Throughout much of 2007, Clinton and Giuliani led in national polls for their parties' respective nominations, and media reports often looked back to the 2000 "race that wasn't" as a preview of what might lie in wait for the entire nation in 2008.<ref name="salon112707"/><ref name="nyt112807"/>  Such extrapolating ended with the Giuliani campaign's precipitous decline and January 2008 withdrawal. Clinton as well failed to gain the 2008 nomination and, in June 2008, she finished in a close second place to Illinois Senator [[Barack Obama]].

In December 2008, Lowey would have another chance at the Senate seat, when Clinton was nominated for [[U.S. Secretary of State]] by President-elect Obama and Lowey was considered a front-runner to be named as her appointed replacement.<ref name="pol120108">{{cite news | url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/1208/Lowey_doesnt_want_Clintons_Senate_seat.html | title=Lowey withdraws from race to replace Clinton | author=Thrush, Glenn | newspaper=[[The Politico]] | date=December 1, 2008 | access-date=December 5, 2008}}</ref>  But Lowey withdrew from consideration, as in the intervening years she had gained enough seniority to become one of the powerful "cardinals" on the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]] and did not want to relinquish that position.<ref name="pol120108"/>  When [[Caroline Kennedy]] announced her interest in the vacancy, comparisons were drawn to Clinton in 2000, with both being famous people seeking to hold elective office for the first time.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/18/caroline-kennedy-senate-profile | title=Caroline Kennedy: Born survivor makes Senate bid | author=Goldenberg, Suzanne | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=December 18, 2008 | access-date=March 21, 2009 | location=London}}</ref>  Others pointed out that Clinton had won election to the office while Kennedy would first be appointed.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2008/12/16/kennedy_clinton/ | title=Why Caroline Kennedy is not Hillary Clinton | author=Koppelman, Alex | magazine=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] | date=December 16, 2008 | access-date=March 21, 2009}}</ref>  In any case, Kennedy's effort soon faltered, in part due to not having the same desire or willingness to work for the seat as Clinton had had,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/choice-of-kennedy-for-senate-no-longer-seems-inevitable | title=Choice of Kennedy for Senate No Longer Seems Inevitable | author=Lee, Jennifer 8. | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 31, 2008 | access-date=March 21, 2009}}</ref> and she soon withdrew as abruptly as she had entered.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/choice-of-kennedy-for-senate-no-longer-seems-inevitable | title=Caroline Kennedy officially withdraws from race for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's Senate seat | author=Lovett, Kenneth | newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] | date=January 22, 2009 | access-date=March 21, 2009}}</ref>
