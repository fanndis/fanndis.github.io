The '''New York Film Festival''' ('''NYFF''') is a [[film festival]] held every autumn in [[New York City]], presented by the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] ('''FSLC'''). Founded in 1963 by [[Richard Roud]] and [[Amos Vogel]] with the support of [[Lincoln Center]] president [[William Schuman]], it is one of the longest-running and most prestigious film festivals in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New York Film Festival Gold|editor-last1=Kern|editor-first1=Laura|editor-last2=Koch|editor-first2=Joanne|editor-last3=Peña|editor-first3=Richard |publisher=The Film Society of Lincoln Center, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=978-0-615-66360-9|location=United States|pages=16–18}}</ref> The non-competitive festival is centered on a “Main Slate” of typically 20–30 feature films, with sidebars for experimental cinema and retrospectives, and recently introduced documentary and trans-media sections. Programming is led by a rotating selection committee, chaired by the director of the New York Film Festival, with many committee members remaining from year to year. Separate committees and individuals program the short film, experimental, and trans-media sections.

Kent Jones was the festival director from 2013 to 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/film-society-names-new-heads-1118059205|title=Film Society names new heads|last=Cox|first=Gordon|work=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref> His successor has not been named yet. As of 2018, the main selection committee included Jones (chair); Dennis Lim, FSLC Director of Programming; and Florence Almozini, FSLC Associate Director of Programming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmlinc.org/daily/56th-new-york-film-festival-main-slate-announced/|title=56th New York Film Festival Main Slate Announced|website=Film Society of Lincoln Center|access-date=2018-09-12}}</ref>

== Sections ==
As of 2018, the festival program is divided into the following sections:

=== Main Slate ===
The Main Slate is the Festival’s primary section, a program typically featuring 25-30 feature-length films, intending to reflect the current state of cinema. The program is a mix of major international art house films from the festival circuit, new discoveries, and studio releases targeting awards season. The studio films are often selected as Opening Night, Centerpiece, and Closing Night presentations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2016/sections/main-slate/|title=Main Slate {{!}} New York Film Festival|website=Film Society of Lincoln Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>

=== Spotlight on Documentary ===
First distinguished from the general Special Events category as a series of three individually-titled programs in 2013, the non-fiction sidebar has been a single program under the name “Spotlight on Documentary” since 2014. The section includes 10-15 feature-length films.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/87253-nyff-announces-spotlight-on-documentary-selections-including-films-from-maysles-blank-scorsese/|title=NYFF Announces Spotlight on Documentary Selections|last=Salovaara|first=Sarah|work=Filmmaker Magazine|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2016/sections/spotlight-on-documentary/|title=Spotlight on Documentary {{!}} New York Film Festival|website=Film Society of Lincoln Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>

=== Projections ===
Previously named “Views From the Avant-Garde”, Projections is the Festival’s experimental showcase, presenting many programs of short and feature-length work. Initiated in 1997 by co-programmers Mark McElhatten and Gavin Smith, the section was re-titled in 2014 following McElhatten’s departure. It has since been curated by Dennis Lim and Aily Nash, along with Smith through 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/nyff-2014-first-projections|title=NYFF 2014.

=== Revivals and Retrospectives ===
The Revivals section, previously called "Masterworks", screens new restorations or rereleases of classic films without any unifying theme. Retrospective programs are centered around specific filmmakers. Recent retrospective subjects include Jean-Luc Godard, Nathaniel Dorsky & Jerome Hiller, Bertrand Tavernier, and Robert Mitchum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2016/sections/revivals/|title=Revivals {{!}} New York Film Festival|website=Film Society of Lincoln Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2016/sections/retrospective/|title=Retrospective {{!}} New York Film Festival|website=Film Society of Lincoln Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>

== History ==
{{see also|List of films shown at the New York Film Festival}}

===Founding the Festival and Richard Roud===

The NYFF's first programmer, [[Richard Roud]], was recruited by Lincoln Center President [[William Schuman]] in 1962. Boston-born Roud was 33 years old at the time and based in London where he worked as a film critic for ''[[The Guardian]]'' and programmed the [[London Film Festival]]. Though Roud maintained his home base in London, he recruited Amos Vogel of the legendary [[Cinema 16]] film club as his New York-based co-programmer. The first edition of the festival opened on September 10, 1963 with [[Luis Buñuel]]'s ''[[The Exterminating Angel (film)|The Exterminating Angel]]''. In 1966, Roud and Vogel formed the festival's first selection committee, consisting of Arthur Knight and [[Andrew Sarris]]; [[Susan Sontag]] was added the next year. Vogel resigned from his position as Festival Director in 1968. Though Roud was previously designated Program Director, he presided over the festival from 1969 to 1987.

Roud's 25 years at the festival were characterized by a focus on the European art cinema of the postwar years and the rise of auteurism.<ref>Smith, Gavin (September/October 2012). "Breaking the Waves". Film Comment.</ref>

===The Richard Peña era===

Richard Peña, then 34, took over as lead programmer in 1988. The Queens native was already an accomplished film historian, academic, and programmer. Prior to his work with NYFF, he worked at the Film Center of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Peña came to NYFF as a seasoned festival-goer who held Roud in high esteem. During his stint as programmer (which also listed 25 years), Peña honored the festival's traditions and unique character - retaining the selection committee process, the non-competitive format, the post-screening director Q&As, and the festival's strict selectivity - while also working to expand NYFF's somewhat Eurocentric focus. Filmmakers like [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]], [[Manoel de Oliveira]], [[Leos Carax]], [[Raúl Ruiz (director)|Raúl Ruiz]], and [[Krzystof Kieslowski]] were introduced to NYFF audiences during the Roud era, and became regulars under Peña. After 25 years as Program Director and head of the NYFF selection committee, Peña led his final year at NYFF in 2012, during the festival's 50th presentation.<ref>Smith, Gavin (September/October 2012). "Breaking the Waves". Film Comment.</ref>

===NYFF today===

After Richard Peña's departure, Robert Koehler briefly took over year-round programming duties, while Kent Jones, who left The [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] in 2009 to serve as Executive Director of the [[World Cinema Foundation]], returned to lead NYFF. Jones began his programming career at Film Forum and the Rotterdam Film Festival, before joining The Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1998 as Associate Director of Programming and a member of the NYFF programming committee.
