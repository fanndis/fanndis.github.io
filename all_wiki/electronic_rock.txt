'''Electronic rock''' is a [[music genre]] that involves a combination of [[rock music]] and [[electronic music]], featuring instruments typically found within both genres. It originates from the late 1960s, when rock bands began incorporating [[electronic instrument]]ation into their music. Electronic rock acts usually fuse elements from other music styles, including [[punk rock]], [[industrial rock]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[techno]], and [[synth-pop]], which has helped spur subgenres such as [[indietronica]], [[dance-punk]], and [[electroclash]].

==Overview==
Being a fusion of rock and electronic, electronic rock features instruments found in both genres, such as [[synthesizer]]s, [[mellotron]]s, [[tape music]] techniques, [[electric guitar]]s and [[drum kit|drums]]. Some electronic rock artists, however, often eschew guitar<ref name=Oxford/> in favor of using technology to emulate a rock sound. Vocals are typically mellow or upbeat,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jxrtek_vttEC&q=electronic+rock+rock&pg=PT172|title=Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture|first=Edward|last=Macan|date=November 24, 1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195098877|accessdate=November 24, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref> but instrumentals are also common in the genre.<ref name=SonicScoop>{{cite web|url=https://sonicscoop.com/2013/11/19/the-abcs-ofelectronic-rock-in-the-studio-the-doors-to-depeche-mode-lcd-soundsystem/|title=The ABC's of…Electronic Rock in the Studio: The Doors to Depeche Mode & LCD Soundsystem - SonicScoop|date= November 19, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}</ref>

A trend of rock bands that incorporated electronic sounds began during the late 1960s. According to critic [[Simon Reynolds]], examples included [[the United States of America (band)|the United States of America]], [[White Noise (band)|White Noise]], and [[Gong (band)|Gong]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=King of the Cosmos |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/apr/22/features.musicmonthly7 |website=[[The Observer]] |accessdate=4 January 2020}}</ref> Other early acts to blend [[synthesizer]]s and [[musique concrète]]'s [[tape music]] techniques with rock instrumentation included [[Silver Apples]], [[Fifty Foot Hose]], [[Syrinx (band)|Syrinx]], [[Lothar and the Hand People]], [[Beaver & Krause]] and [[Tonto's Expanding Head Band]].<ref name="Reynolds">{{cite web |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=Synthedelia: Psychedelic Electronic Music in the 1960s |url=https://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2018/05/synthedelia |website=[[Red Bull Music Academy]] |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref> Many such 1960s acts blended [[psychedelic rock]] with [[avant-garde]] academic or underground influences.<ref name="Reynolds"/>

In the 1970s, German "[[krautrock]]" bands such as [[Neu!]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[Can (band)|Can]], and [[Amon Düül]] challenged rock boundaries by incorporating electronic instrumentation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Demby |first1=Eric |title=OLD NEU!

==Subgenres and other terms==
The term "[[progressive rock]]" (or "prog rock") was originally coined in the 1960s for music that would otherwise be described as "electronic rock,"<ref name="SonicScoop" /> but the definition of "prog" later narrowed into a specific set of musical conventions - as opposed to a sensibility involving forward-thinking or experimental approaches.<ref>{{cite book|page=117|last=Robinson|first=Emily|title=The Language of Progressive Politics in Modern Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAYbDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA223|year=2017|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-137-50664-1}}</ref>

Electronic rock is also associated with [[industrial rock]], [[synth-pop]], [[dance-punk]], [[indietronica]], and [[new wave music|new wave]],<ref name="SonicScoop" /> with [[electroclash]], [[new rave]], [[post-punk revival]], [[post-rock]], considered as subgenres.<ref name="Oxford" /> Sometimes, certain other electronic subgenres are fused with rock, like [[trance music|trance]] and [[techno]], leading to the use of the terms trance rock and techno rock, respectively.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fie47qSuTsoC&q=%22Trance+rock+rock%22&pg=PA1780|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|first=Peter|last=Buckley|date=24 November 2017|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=9781858284576|accessdate=24 November 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9-n6keDGDMC&q=%22Techno+rock+rock%22&pg=PA333|title=Year of Prophecy|first1=Elizabeth Clare|last1=Prophet|first2=Summit University|last2=Press|date=November 24, 1989|publisher=Summit University Press|isbn=9780916766962|accessdate=November 24, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>

[[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]], a major subgenre of rock, is sometimes mixed with electronic and its subgenres, inspiring terms such as electronic metal, [[synth-metal]], electronic dance metal, trance metal and techno metal. <ref name="MetalInjection">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/lists/10-current-artists-who-effortlessly-blend-metal-with-other-genres/2|title=10 Current Artists That Effortlessly Blend Metal With Other Genres - Page 2 of 2 - Metal Injection|date=November 2, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/09/19/is-electronic-dance-metal-the-next-big-thing/|title=IS ELECTRONIC DANCE METAL THE NEXT BIG THING??? - MetalSucks|date=September 19, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/12012-30-second-guide-to-trance-metal.html|title=30 Second guide to: Trance Metal|publisher=|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}</ref><ref name="MetalUnderground">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=78347|title=Unearthing The Electronic Metal Underground|publisher=|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}</ref>{{text-source inline|date=September 2018}}
