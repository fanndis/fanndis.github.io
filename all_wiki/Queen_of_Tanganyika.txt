From 1961 to 1962, [[Tanganyika]] was an independent [[sovereign state]] with [[Elizabeth II]] as its queen. The Queen was formal [[head of state]] and was represented in Tanganyika by the [[Governor-General of Tanganyika|Governor-General]].<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Mangasini Atanasi Katundu and Neema Penance Kumburu|title=Tanzania's Constitutional Reform Predicament and the Survival of the Tanganyika and Zanzibar Union|journal=The Journal of Pan African Studies|volume=8|issue=3|date=August 2015|pages=104–118|url=http://www.jpanafrican.org/docs/vol8no3/8.3-10-Katundu.pdf}}</ref> Tanganyika shared the Sovereign with the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, including the [[United Kingdom]].

The monarchy was created by the [[Tanganyika Independence Act 1961]] which transformed the [[United Nations trust territories|United Nations trust territory]] of [[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]] into an independent sovereign [[constitutional monarchy]]. The monarchy was abolished in 1962, when Tanganyika became a [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|republic within the Commonwealth]] with the [[President of Tanganyika]] as [[head of state]]. ''[[The Round Table: The Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs]]'' wrote:
{{quote|On December 9, 1961, when Tanganyika became independent, it suddenly became a monarchy with the monarch as Queen of Tanganyika. But the British monarchy was regarded as a foreign institution and the new position increased the sense of alienation from the Crown. It is made clear, however, that the proposal to become a republic does not imply any disrespect towards the person of the Queen, whose position as Head of the Commonwealth is readily acknowledged&nbsp;... The chief, as the leader of the tribe, still holds a position of great importance in most areas&nbsp;... by and large the chiefs have retained the affection and loyalty of their people and since it is a monarchical system, it might be thought that the idea of monarchy was acceptable to the people and that in some areas it was strongly entrenched. There is, however, a difference between the monarchical idea of chieftainship and that of an alien monarch who is a European and who lives thousands of miles away and is never seen. The days have gone when the English sovereign can be expected to command the personal loyalty of African subjects in the same way as people of British origin.<ref>{{cite journal|date=1962|title=The Republic of Tanganyika: A Break with the Colonial Past|journal=The Round Table: The Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs|volume=52|issue=208|pages=339–347|doi=10.1080/00358536208452388}}</ref> }}

Tanganyika merged with [[Sultanate of Zanzibar|Zanzibar]] in 1964 after the [[Zanzibar Revolution]] to form [[Tanzania]]. The Queen visited Tanzania on 19–22 July 1979, visiting [[Arusha]], [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Zanzibar]], and [[Kilimanjaro]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/RoyalVisits/Commonwealthvisitssince1952.aspx|title=Commonwealth visits since 1952|publisher=Royal Household|work=Official website of the British monarchy|accessdate=8 November 2015}}</ref>
