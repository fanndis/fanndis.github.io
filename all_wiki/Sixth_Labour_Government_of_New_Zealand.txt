The '''Sixth Labour Government''' has [[New Zealand Government|governed New Zealand]] since 26 October 2017. It is headed by [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] leader and [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Jacinda Ardern]].

Following the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]] held on 23 September 2017, the [[New Zealand First]] party held the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] between the sitting centre-right [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] government, and the left bloc of the Labour and [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green]] parties.

On 18 November, Associate Housing Minister Kris Faafoi announced that the Government would be amending the [[Residential Tenancies Act 1986]]. Proposed changes have included limited rent increases to once every twelve months, banning rental bidding, ending "no cause" evictions, extending the notice period that landlords have to give tenants for selling rental property from 42 days to 63–90 days, and letting tenants make minor fittings, and anonymising complaints to the tenancy tribunal. Andrew King of the NZ Property Investors Federation and National Party leader Simon Bridges claimed that these changes would make it more difficult to evict "troublesome" tenants and would do little to address the housing shortage. By contrast, the Green Party and tenancy advocacy group Renters United have welcomed these changes as a win for tenants' rights.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Junn |first1=Jihee |title=Cheat sheet: Big changes for rental laws announced |url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/17-11-2019/cheat-sheet-big-changes-for-rental-laws-announced/ |access-date=19 November 2019 |work=[[The Spinoff]] |date=17 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=McCulloch |first1=Craig |title=Rental law changes will hamper eviction of bad tenants - landlords |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/403503/rental-law-changes-will-hamper-eviction-of-bad-tenants-landlords |access-date=19 November 2019 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=18 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Gibson |first1=Anne |title=Now and then: Landlord/tenant law overhaul, how 1.5m lives could change |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=12286075 |access-date=19 November 2019 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=18 November 2019}}</ref>

On 23 November 2019, the Justice Minister Andrew Little announced that the Government would be amending the Electoral Amendment Bill to allow prisoners who had been sentenced to less than three years in prison to vote in time for the [[2020 New Zealand general election]]; reversing the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]]'s decision to strip all prisoners of their voting rights in 2010. Little argued that restoring prisoners' voting rights would aid their reintegration into society. The Government's policy shift had been preceded by a successful legal challenge mounted by prisoners advocate [[Arthur William Taylor]] in 2013 and a [[Waitangi Tribunal]] report that the voting ban on prisoners disproportionately affected Māori prisoners. While Little's announcement was welcomed by Green MP Ghahraman, National Party leader Bridges accused the Government of being "soft on crime."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Christian |first1=Harrison |title=Prisoner voting rights to be restored ahead of 2020 election |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/117658836/prisoner-voting-rights-to-be-restored-ahead-of-2020-election |access-date=24 November 2019 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=23 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Justice Minister announces prisoners serving less than three years in jail will have voting rights restored |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/403954/justice-minister-announces-prisoners-serving-less-than-three-years-in-jail-will-have-voting-rights-restored |access-date=24 November 2019 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=23 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Sherman |first1=Maki |title=Exclusive: Government to restore prisoner voting rights in time for 2020 Election |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/exclusive-government-restore-prisoner-voting-rights-in-time-2020-election |access-date=24 November 2019 |work=[[1 News]] |date=23 November 2019}}</ref>

===2018 Labour Party youth camp sexual assaults===
On 12 March 2018 allegations of multiple sexual assaults at the [[New Zealand Young Labour|Young Labour]] Summer School at Waitawheta Camp in [[Waihi]] emerged. It was alleged that a 20-year-old man put his hands down the pants of four sixteen-year-olds on the second night of the camp, which occurred a month earlier. It was reported that there were "mountains of alcohol" present at the camp, and that people under the legal drinking age of eighteen were consuming alcohol. Prime Minister [[Jacinda Ardern]] was not informed of the allegations by party leadership, despite them knowing a month earlier. Support had not been offered to the victims, something Ardern said she was "deeply sorry" for.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jennings |first1=Mark |title=Sexual misconduct alleged at boozy Labour Party camp |url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2018/03/12/96033/labour-summer-school-claims |access-date=28 December 2018 |publisher=[[Newsroom (website)|Newsroom]] |date=12 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Walters |first1=Laura |title=Arrest after alleged sexual assaults at Labour Party youth camp |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/105003464/labour-youth-camp-arrest |access-date=28 December 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=26 June 2018}}</ref> Ardern did not fire any of her party staffers who failed to act on information of the allegations and inform her.

On 11 September, Haworth resigned as Labour Party President following criticism of his handling of the complaints about the male staffer from several Labour Party members including bullying, harassment, and sexual assault.

That same day, the National Party's deputy leader [[Paula Bennett]] claimed under [[parliamentary privilege]] that several of the Prime Minister's senior staff members and a Cabinet minister including Ardern's former chief of staff Mike Munro, current chief press secretary Andrew Campbell, and the director of the Labour leader's office Rob Salmond were aware of the sexual allegations.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bennett names Labour figures she says knew of sexual assault allegations |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/398584/bennett-names-labour-figures-she-says-knew-of-sexual-assault-allegations |access-date=12 September 2019 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=11 September 2019}}</ref>

On 12 September, the male Labour staffer accused of bullying and sexual assault resigned.

Simon Mitchell, the lawyer tasked with leading Labour's investigation into the misconduct, stated that he was unaware of the sexual assault allegations until they were first reported by the media.

On 18 December, Labour Party President Claire Szabo released the report by Maria Drew QC. While Drew's report found insufficient evidence to support allegations of sexual assault and harassment,  it found that the former Labour Party staffer had shown "overbearing and aggressive" behaviour on five occasions. Drew recommended a letter cautioning the former staffer and that he write a letter of apology and participate in a restorative justice process with the victim.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jancic |first1=Boris |title=Labour Party sexual assault review: Maria Dew's findings can't substantiate allegation |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12294999 |access-date=18 December 2019 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=18 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Whyte |first1=Anna |title=Labour Party report finds 'insufficient evidence' that former staffer sexually assaulted woman |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/labour-party-report-finds-insufficient-evidence-former-staffer-sexually-assaulted-woman |access-date=18 December 2019 |work=[[1 News]] |date=18 December 2019}}</ref>

===David Clark===
In early April 2020, Health Minister [[David Clark (New Zealand politician)|David Clark]] drew widespread criticism when he flouted the [[COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand#Alert level system|level four lockdown]] restrictions during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand]] on two occasions. This included driving two kilometres away from his home in [[Dunedin]] to ride a mountain bike trail and later driving his family 20 kilometres to a Dunedin beach for a family outing during the first week of the lockdown. After admitting to the two incidents on separate occasions, Clark offered his resignation as Health Minister to Prime Minister Ardern. Ardern declined to accept his resignation but stripped him of his Associate Finance Ministerial portfolio and demoted him to the bottom of Labour's Cabinet list.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Manch |first1=Thomas |last2=Cooke |first2=Henry |title=Health Minister drives to local park to ride his mountain bike, amid coronavirus lockdown |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/120780372/health-minister-drives-to-local-park-to-ride-his-mountain-bike-amid-coronavirus-lockdown |access-date=4 April 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=2 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Coronavirus Covid 19: David Clark apologises to PM for flouting his own Government's lockdown advice |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12322301 |access-date=4 April 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=3 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Sachdeva |first1=Sam |title=Clark's biking calamity a sign of wider confusion |url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2020/04/04/1114021/clarks-cycle-calamity-a-sign-of-wider-confusion |access-date=4 April 2020 |work=[[Newsroom]] |date=4 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=David Clark offers to resign after revealing he took a trip to beach during Covid-19 lockdown |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/413617/david-clark-offers-to-resign-after-revealing-he-took-a-trip-to-beach-during-covid-19-lockdown |access-date=7 April 2020 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=7 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407052511/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/413617/david-clark-offers-to-resign-after-revealing-he-took-a-trip-to-beach-during-covid-19-lockdown|archive-date=7 April 2020}}</ref>
