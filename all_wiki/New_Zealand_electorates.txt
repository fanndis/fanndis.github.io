An '''electorate''' or '''electoral district''' ({{lang-mi|[[rohe]] pōti}}), or informally, a '''seat''',{{efn|More technically a "seat" refers to an elected member's place in Parliament. Historically, the only way to gain a seat was to win an electorate, but under the present [[Electoral system of New Zealand#MMP in New Zealand|MMP system]], now  [[list MP]]s are able to gain seats without representing an electorate.|name=|group=}} is a [[electoral district|geographical constituency]] used for electing members (MPs) to the [[New Zealand Parliament]].<ref name="Electoral Act">{{cite web|title=Electoral Act 1993 No 87 (as at 01 July 2016), Public Act Contents|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM307519.html|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|publisher=New Zealand Legislation|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en-NZ}}</ref> The size of electorates is determined such that all electorates have approximately the same population.

Before 1996, all MPs were directly chosen for office by the voters of an electorate. In [[Electoral system of New Zealand|New Zealand's electoral system]], 72 of the usually 120 seats in Parliament are filled by electorate members, with the remainder being filled from [[party list]]s in order to achieve [[proportional representation]] among parties. The 72 electorates are made up from 65 general and seven [[Māori electorates]]. The number of electorates increases periodically in line with national population growth; the number was increased from 71 to 72 starting at the [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020 general election]].

{{As of|2018}} the Representation Commission determines electorate boundaries.<ref name="commission">{{cite web|title= Representation Commission|url= http://www.elections.org.nz/voting-system/electorates/electorate-boundaries-and-review/representation-commission|website= elections.org.nz|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)]]|accessdate= 9 February 2017|language= en|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190122024506/https://www.elections.org.nz/voting-system/electorates/electorate-boundaries-and-review/representation-commission|archive-date= 22 January 2019|url-status= dead}}</ref> The Commission consists of:
* Four government officials—the Government Statistician, the Surveyor-General, the Chief Electoral Officer, and the Chairperson of the Local Government Commission.
* A representative of the governing party or coalition, and a representative of the opposition bloc.
* A chairperson (often a judge) nominated by the other members (with the exception of Chairperson of the Local Government Commission).<ref name="commission" />

The Representation Commission reviews electorate boundaries after each [[New Zealand census]], which normally occurs every five years.<ref name="Electoral Act" /> The [[South Island]] is guaranteed to have 16 general seats, and dividing the number of persons in the South Island's general electoral population by 16 determines the ''South Island Quota'' which is then used to help calculate the number of [[Māori electorates]] and to determine the number of [[North Island]] electorates. The number of Māori electorates is influenced by the ''Māori Electoral Option'' where Māori voters can opt to be in either a Māori electorate or a general electorate. The percentage of Māori voters opting for the Māori roll determines the percentage of the whole Māori population (of persons claiming Māori ancestry at the previous census) which is then divided by the South Island Quota to calculate the number of Māori seats. South Island Māori opting for the general roll are included in the population on which the South Island Quota is established. The North Island population (including Māori opting for the general roll) is divided into electorates, each of approximately the same population as the South Island ones.<ref>{{cite web |title= Calculating future Māori and General Electorates |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2013-electorate-boundary-review/calculating-future-maori-and-general-electorates |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)]] |accessdate= 2 October 2013 |date= 1 October 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131005022643/http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2013-electorate-boundary-review/calculating-future-maori-and-general-electorates |archive-date= 5 October 2013 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Electorates may vary by no more than 5% of the average population size.<ref name="Electoral Act" /> This has caused the number of list seats in Parliament to decline as the population is experiencing "northern drift" (i.e. the population of the North Island, especially around [[Auckland]], is growing faster than that of the South Island) due both to internal migration and to immigration.<ref>{{cite web|title= Proportion of electorate seats to list seats|url= http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/Proportionality_submissions.pdf|website= elections.org.nz|publisher=Electoral Commission|accessdate= 9 February 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190125034625/https://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/Proportionality_submissions.pdf|archive-date= 25 January 2019|url-status= dead}}</ref>

Although the New Zealand Parliament is intended to have 120 members,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} recent iterations have exceeded this quantity. Due to some parties winning more electorate seats than their proportion of the party vote suggests, [[overhang seat]]s have been awarded{{by whom|date=October 2018}}. In [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005]] and [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011]], 121 members were elected; 122 members were elected in [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]].<ref>{{cite web

=== History ===
Originally, electorates were drawn up{{by whom|date=October 2018}} based on political and social links, with little consideration for differences in population. Elections for the New Zealand House of Representatives in the 1850s modelled the electoral procedures used for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]], which at that time featured both single-member electorates (electorates returning just one MP) and multi-member electorates (electorates returning more than one MP).<ref name="Roberts2012">{{cite web|last1= Roberts|first1= Nigel S.|title= Electoral systems - Turning votes into seats|url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/electoral-systems/page-1|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate= 9 February 2017|date= 20 June 2012}}</ref> Each electorate was allocated a different number of MPs (up to three) in order to balance population differences. All electorates used a [[plurality voting system]].<ref>{{cite web|last1= Roberts|first1= Nigel S.|title= Electoral systems - Turning votes into seats|url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/electoral-systems/page-1|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate= 16 October 2018|date= 17 February 2015 | quote = Both the single-member and the multi-member districts were instances of plurality voting systems, because candidates did not need a majority of the votes (more than half) to be elected. They required only a plurality – more votes than any of the other candidates – to win.}}</ref> From 1881, a special [[country quota]] meant that rural seats could contain fewer people than urban seats, preserving improportionality by over-representing farmers.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Atkinson|first1= Neill|title= Adventures in democracy: a history of the vote in New Zealand|date= 2003|publisher=University of Otago Press|location= Dunedin|page= 76 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_CG4AAAAIAAJ}}</ref>{{qn|date=October 2018}} For the [[1905 New Zealand general election|1905 election]] the multi-member electorates were abolished. The quota system persisted until 1945.<ref name="Roberts2012" />

Because of the increasing North Island population, the Representation Commission awarded the North Island an additional electoral seat beginning in the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]].<ref name="2007changes">{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/2007%20Representation%20Commission%20Report.pdf |title= Report of the Representation Commission, 2007 |date= 2007 |website= elections.org.nz |publisher=Representation Commission |page= 4 |accessdate= 3 September 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190123193826/https://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/2007%20Representation%20Commission%20Report.pdf |archive-date= 23 January 2019 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Another new North Island seat was added for the [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014 general election]].<ref name="2014changes">{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/events/electorate-boundary-review/final-electorate-boundaries/2014-electorate-boundaries-key-changes |title= 2014 Electorate Boundaries - Key Changes |date= 17 April 2014 |website= elections.org.nz |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate= 3 September 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190126021123/https://www.elections.org.nz/events/electorate-boundary-review/final-electorate-boundaries/2014-electorate-boundaries-key-changes |archive-date= 26 January 2019 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Each time, the need for an extra seat was determined from the results of the most recent [[New Zealand census]], with the seat coming out of the total number of list seats. The total number of list seats has thus declined from 55 to 49 since the introduction of mixed-mmber proportional voting in 1996.

==Naming==
The Representation Commission determines the names of each electorate following the most recent census.<ref name="commission" /> An electorate may be named after a geographic region, landmark (e.g. a mountain) or main population centre. The Commission adopts [[Cardinal direction|compass point]] names when there is not a more suitable name. The compass point reference usually follows the name of the main population centre, e.g. [[Hamilton East (New Zealand electorate)|Hamilton East]].

==Special electorates==
{{details|topic=the historic qualifications required to vote|History of voting in New Zealand}}

Over the years, there have been two types of "special" electorates created for particular communities. The first were special [[Gold Fields (New Zealand electorate)|goldminers' electorates]], created for participants in the [[Central Otago Gold Rush|Otago Goldrush]]—goldminers did not usually meet the residency and property requirements in the electorate they were prospecting in, but were numerous enough to warrant political representation. Two goldminers' electorates existed, the first began in 1863 and both ended in 1870.

=== Māori electorates ===
Much more durable have been the [[Māori electorates]], created in 1867 to give separate representation to [[Māori people|Māori]] citizens. Although originally intended to be temporary, they came to function as [[reserved political positions|reserved positions]] for Māori until 1967, ensuring that there would always be a Māori voice in Parliament.  In 1967 the reserved status of the Maori seats was removed, allowing non-Maori to stand in the Maori electorates, thus removing any guarantee that Maori would be elected to Parliament. Until 1993 the number of Māori electorates was fixed at four, significantly under-representing Māori in Parliament. In 1975 the definition of who could opt to register on either the general or the māori roll was expanded to include all persons of Māori descent.<ref name="1975 Act">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/eaa19751975n28210/ |title= Electoral Amendment Act 1975 |accessdate= 10 March 2014}}</ref> Previously all persons of more than 50% Māori ancestry were on the Māori roll while persons of less than 50% Māori ancestry were required to enrol on the then European roll. Only persons presumed to have equal Māori and European ancestry (so-called half-castes) had a choice of roll.<ref name="1956 Act">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/ea19561956n107130/ |title= Electoral Act, 1956 |accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref> Since the introduction of [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]], the number of seats can change with the number of Māori voters who choose to go on the Māori roll rather than the general roll.

== Electorates in the 53rd Parliament ==

Electoral districts in the [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020 general election]] for the [[53rd New Zealand Parliament|53rd Parliament]] reflect changes made in the Representation Commission’s 2019/2020 boundary review. As well as new boundaries for many districts, the names of ten electorates have been changed, and one new electorate ([[Takanini (New Zealand electorate)|Takanini]]) has been created.<ref>{{Cite web|date=17 April 2020|title=Boundary Review 2019/20|url=https://elections.nz/democracy-in-nz/historical-events/boundary-review-2019-2020/|access-date=2020-09-06|website=Elections|publisher=Electoral Commission New Zealand|language=en-NZ}}</ref> While some changes were made to the boundaries of the Māori electorates, their names and general area remain the same as in the 52nd Parliament.
