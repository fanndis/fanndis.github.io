=== Critical reception ===
The show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. [[HitFix]] television columnist [[Alan Sepinwall]] commented, "It ran on and on and on and on so much that when host Neil Patrick Harris finally got around to paying off a running gag about his Oscar predictions being locked in a box on stage left, he had to stop to explain the bit to us all over again." In addition, he observed, "Either the production consumed Harris, the writing failed him, or he picked a very strange night to go off-brand."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-bloated-oscar-telecast-gets-in-way-of-terrific-oscar-ceremony#7mCjR0p5UUIp5zfO.99" |title=Bloated Oscar telecast gets in way of terrific Oscar ceremony—Bad jokes, too many musical numbers, but lots of great speeches |website=HitFix |date=February 23, 2015 |accessdate=February 26, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225223147/http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-bloated-oscar-telecast-gets-in-way-of-terrific-oscar-ceremony |archivedate=February 25, 2015}}</ref> Hal Boedeker of the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' wrote, "Harris headlined a blah production number to start the show. His running shtick about Oscar predictions grew tiresome." He concluded his review saying, "The music saved this Oscar telecast, but it was still a long, tedious show. The highlight reel will make it look better than it was."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Boedeker |first1=Hal |title=Oscars: Best, worst moments |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/tv/tv-guy/os-oscars-best-worst-moments-20150223-post.html |work=Orlando Sentinel  |date=February 23, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133414/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/tv/tv-guy/os-oscars-best-worst-moments-20150223-post.html |archivedate=April 2, 2015}}</ref> Television critic [[Alessandra Stanley]] from ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Oscar nights almost always drag on too long, but this one was a slog almost from the very beginning."

Other media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Television critic Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' commented, "Neil Patrick Harris was very Neil Patrick Harrisy Sunday night in his first round as Oscars host. He was calm and cheerful and vanilla as usual, always ready with a lightly snarky joke and always eager to jump into a big production number involving old-timey choreography. He’s a pro at hosting, after his Tony and Emmy gigs, and it showed during the ABC telecast in his endlessly relaxed and open energy." He also wrote despite several production gaffes and an uneven pace, the show moved along "with a minimum of pain."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gilbert |first1=Matthew |title=Harris turns on the charm, takes off his pants |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2015/02/23/harris-turns-charm-takes-off-his-pants/iWFpMMMPbqLrPxtItMsfIK/story.html |accessdate=March 28, 2015 |work=The Boston Globe  |date=February 23, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328055253/http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2015/02/23/harris-turns-charm-takes-off-his-pants/iWFpMMMPbqLrPxtItMsfIK/story.html |archivedate=March 28, 2015}}</ref> ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'' columnist Dave Walker wrote, "Harris played it like he was basically born to do it—light on his feet working the crowd or at center stage without his pants, winkingly self-deprecating, moving-right-along when his prepared material didn't land (which was too often)—and he now may have a job for life if he wants it."
