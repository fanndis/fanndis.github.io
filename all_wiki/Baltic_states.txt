The '''Baltic states''' ({{lang-et|Balti riigid, Baltimaad}}; {{lang-lv|Baltijas valstis}}; {{lang-lt|Baltijos valstybės}}), also known as the '''Baltic countries''', '''Baltic republics''', '''Baltic nations''', or simply the '''Baltics''', is a geopolitical term, typically used to group the three [[Sovereign state|sovereign states]] in [[Northern Europe]] on the eastern coast of the [[Baltic Sea]]: [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]]. The term is not used in the context of [[Cultural area|cultural areas]], [[national identity]], or [[Languages of Europe|language]], because while the majority of people in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] are [[Baltic people]], the majority in [[Estonia]] are [[Baltic Finns|Finnic]]. The three countries do not form an official union, but engage in intergovernmental and parliamentary cooperation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vm.ee/en/baltic-cooperation|title = Baltic Cooperation {{!}} Ministry of Foreign Affairs|website=vm.ee|access-date=28 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506193534/http://www.vm.ee/en/baltic-cooperation|archive-date=6 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The most important areas of cooperation among the three countries are foreign and security policy, defence, energy, and transportation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vm.ee/en/baltic-cooperation|title = Baltic Cooperation &#124; Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}</ref>

All three countries are members of [[NATO]], the [[eurozone]], the [[OECD]], and the [[European Union]]. [[Estonia]] is also a non-permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. All three are classified as [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economies]] by the [[World Bank]] and maintain a very high [[Human Development Index]].<ref name="Lithuania OECD" />

The term ''Baltic states'' was, until the early 20th century, used in the context of countries neighbouring the [[Baltic Sea]]: Sweden and Denmark, sometimes also Germany and the Russian Empire. With the advent of [[Foreningen Norden]] (the Nordic Associations), the term was no longer used for Sweden and Denmark.<ref>{{Cite book

==History==

===Summary===
{{see also|History of Estonia|History of Latvia|History of Lithuania}}
After the [[World War I|First World War]] the term "Baltic states" came to refer to countries by the Baltic Sea that had gained independence from the Russian Empire. The term includes [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], and originally also included [[Finland]], which later became grouped among the [[Nordic countries]].<ref>{{Cite book

The areas of the Baltic states have seen different regional and imperial affiliations during their existence. They were first included under the same political entity when the [[Russian Empire]] expanded in the 18th century. The territories of Estonia and Latvia were joined into the Russian Empire at the end of the [[Great Northern War]] in 1721, while the territory of Lithuania came under the Russian rule after the [[Third Partition of Poland]] in 1795. The territories of the Baltic states were ruled by the Russian Empire until the end of the World War I when Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania gained their sovereignty. They remained independent until the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupation and annexation]] by the [[Soviet Union]] and briefly, [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]], before the Soviets regained the control of the Baltic states. [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet rule ended]] when the three countries declared the occupation illegal and culminated with the restoration of independence to their pre-war status in 1990–1991 when the [[Revolutions of 1989|communist rule collapsed in Eastern Europe]].

===Wars of Independence===
[[File:Soomusrong nr 2 Valgas 1919.jpg|thumb|right|An [[armoured train]] used in the Estonian War of Independence against the [[Soviet Union]], 1919]]
See also: [[Estonian War of Independence]], [[Latvian War of Independence]], [[Lithuanian Wars of Independence]]

As World War I came to a close, [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|Lithuania declared independence]] and [[Latvian Provisional Government|Latvia formed a provisional government]]. Estonia had already [[Autonomous Governorate of Estonia|obtained autonomy from tsarist Russia]] in 1917, but was subsequently occupied by the German Empire; they fought [[Estonian War of Independence|an independence war]] against [[Soviet Russia]] and [[Baltic nobility]] before gaining true independence [[History of Estonia (1920–39)|from 1920 to 1939]]. Latvia and Lithuanians followed a similar process, until the [[Latvian War of Independence]] and [[Lithuanian Wars of Independence]] were extinguished in 1920.

During the [[interwar period]] these countries were sometimes referred to as ''[[limitrophe states]]'' between the two World Wars, from the French, indicating their collectively forming a rim along Bolshevik Russia's, later the Soviet Union's, western border. They were also part of what Clemenceau considered a strategic [[Cordon sanitaire (politics)|cordon sanitaire]], the entire territory from Finland in the north to Romania in the south, standing between Western Europe and potential Bolshevik territorial ambitions.<ref name="Smele">{{cite book

Prior to [[World War II]] Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania each experienced an authoritarian head of state who had come to power after a bloodless coup: [[Antanas Smetona]] in Lithuania ([[1926 Lithuanian coup d'état|December 1926]]), [[Konstantin Päts]] in Estonia ([[Era of Silence|March 1934]]), and [[Kārlis Ulmanis]] in Latvia ([[1934 Latvian coup d'état|May 1934]]). Some note that the events in Lithuania differed from its two more northerly neighbors, with Smetona having different motivations as well as securing power 8 years before any such events in Latvia or Estonia took place. Despite considerable political turmoil in Finland no such events took place there. Finland did however get embroiled in a [[Finnish Civil War|bloody civil war]], something that did not happen in the Baltics.<ref>{{cite web

| quote = as [Lithuania] is a distinct case from the other two Baltic countries. Not only was an authoritarian regime set up in 1926, eight years before those of Estonia and Latvia, but it was also formed not to counter a threat from the right, but through a military coup d'etat against a leftist government. (...) The hostility between socialists and non-socialists in Finland had been amplified by a bloody civil war
}}</ref> Some controversy surrounds the Baltic authoritarian régimes – due to the general stability and rapid economic growth of the period (even if brief), some commenters avoid the label "authoritarian"; others, however, condemn such an "apologetic" attitude, for example in [[Kārlis Ulmanis#Later assessments|later assessments of Kārlis Ulmanis]].

===Soviet and German occupations===
{{Main articles|German occupation of the Baltic states during World War II}}
In accordance with a secret protocol within the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939 that divided Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence, the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] [[Soviet invasion of Poland|entered eastern Poland]] in September 1939, and then coerced Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into mutual assistance treaties which granted them the right to establish military bases in these countries. In June 1940, the Red Army [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupied all of the territory of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania]], and installed new, pro-Soviet governments in all three countries. Following elections (in which only pro-communist candidates were allowed to run), the newly elected parliaments of the three countries formally applied to join the Soviet Union in August 1940 and were incorporated into it as the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian]], [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvian]], and [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]]s.

Repressions, executions and [[mass deportation]]s followed after that in the Baltics.<ref>{{Cite web

The Soviet control of the Baltic states was interrupted by [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] invasion of this region in 1941. Initially, many Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians considered the Germans as liberators. The Baltic countries hoped for the restoration of independence, but instead the Germans established a civil administration, known as the ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]''.{{cn|date=September 2020}} During the occupation the Germans carried out [[Nazi ghettos|ghettoisation]]s and mass killings of the countries' Jewish populations.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Over 190,000 [[Lithuanian Jews]], nearly 95% of Lithuania's pre-war Jewish community, and 66,000 [[Latvian Jews]] were murdered. The German occupation lasted until late 1944 (in [[Courland]], until early 1945), when the countries were reoccupied by the Red Army and Soviet rule was re-established, with the passive agreement of the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] (see [[Yalta Conference]] and [[Potsdam Agreement]]).

The forced collectivisation of agriculture began in 1947, and was completed after the mass deportation in March 1949 (see [[Operation Priboi]]). Private farms were confiscated, and farmers were made to join the collective farms. In all three countries, Baltic [[partisan (military)|partisans]], known colloquially as the [[Forest Brothers]], [[Latvian national partisans]], and [[Lithuanian partisans]], waged unsuccessful guerrilla warfare against the Soviet occupation for the next eight years in a bid to regain their nations' independence. The armed resistance of the anti-Soviet partisans lasted up to 1953. Although the armed resistance was defeated, the population remained anti-Soviet.

===Restoration of independence===
In the late 1980s a massive campaign of [[civil resistance]] against Soviet rule, known as the [[Singing revolution]], began. On 23 August 1989, the [[Baltic Way]], a two-million-strong human chain, stretched for 600&nbsp;km from [[Tallinn]] to [[Vilnius]]. In the wake of this campaign [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev's]] government had privately concluded that the departure of the Baltic republics had become "inevitable".<ref name="Beissinger">{{cite book

All three are today [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]], with [[unicameral]] parliaments elected by popular vote for four-year terms: [[Riigikogu]] in Estonia, [[Saeima]] in Latvia and [[Seimas]] in Lithuania. In Latvia and Estonia, the president is elected by parliament, while Lithuania has a semi-presidential system whereby the president is elected by popular vote. All are members of the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO).

Each of the three countries has declared itself to be the restoration of the sovereign nation that had existed from 1918 to 1940, emphasizing their contention that [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|Soviet domination over the Baltic nations]] during the [[Cold War]] period had been an illegal occupation and annexation.

The same legal interpretation is shared by the United States, the United Kingdom, and most other Western democracies,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} who held the forcible incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the Soviet Union to be illegal. At least formally, most Western democracies never considered the three Baltic states to be constituent parts of the Soviet Union. Australia was a brief exception to this support of Baltic independence: in 1974, the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of Australia did recognize Soviet dominion, but this decision was reversed by the next [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]].<ref>{{Cite journal

After the Baltic states had [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|restored their independence]], integration with Western Europe became a major strategic goal. In 2002, the Baltic nations applied for membership of NATO and the EU. All three became NATO members on 29 March 2004, and joined the EU on 1 May 2004. The Baltic states are currently the only [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet states]] to have joined either organization.

During the Baltic struggle for independence 1989–1992, a personal friendship developed between the (at that time unrecognized) Baltic ministers of foreign affairs and the Nordic ministers of foreign affairs. This friendship led to the creation of the [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]] in 1992, and the [[EuroFaculty]] in 1993.<ref>{{Cite book

Between 1994 and 2004, the [[Free trade areas in Europe#BAFTA|BAFTA]] free trade agreement was established to help prepare the countries for their accession to the EU, rather than out of the Baltic states' desire to trade among themselves. The Baltic countries were more interested in gaining access to the rest of the European market.

Currently, the governments of the Baltic states cooperate in multiple ways, including cooperation among presidents, parliament speakers, heads of government, and foreign ministers. On 8 November 1991, the [[Baltic Assembly]], which includes 15 to 20 MPs from each parliament, was established to facilitate inter-parliamentary cooperation. The [[Baltic Council of Ministers]] was established on 13 June 1994 to facilitate intergovernmental cooperation. Since 2003, there is coordination between the two organizations.<ref>{{Cite web

Compared with other regional groupings in Europe, such as [[Nordic council]] or [[Visegrad Four]], Baltic cooperation is rather limited. Possible explanations include the short history of restored sovereignty and fear of losing it again, along with an orientation toward Nordic countries and Baltic-Nordic cooperation in [[NB8|The Nordic-Baltic Eight]]. Estonia especially has attempted to construct a [[Nordic Estonia|Nordic identity]] for itself and denounced Baltic identity, despite still seeking to preserve close relationship with other countries in the region.<ref name="Ilvess">{{cite news

==Energy security of Baltic states==
Usually the concept of [[Energy security and renewable technology|energy security]] is related to the uninterruptible supply, sufficient energy storage, advanced technological development of energy sector and environmental regulations.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Zeng|first1=Shouzhen|last2=Streimikiene|first2=Dalia|last3=Baležentis|first3=Tomas|date=September 2017|title=Review of and comparative assessment of energy security in Baltic States|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=76|pages=185–192|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.037|issn=1364-0321}}</ref> Other studies add other indicators to this list: diversification of energy suppliers, energy import dependence and vulnerability of political system.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kisel|first1=Einari|last2=Hamburg|first2=Arvi|last3=Härm|first3=Mihkel|last4=Leppiman|first4=Ando|last5=Ots|first5=Märt|date=August 2016|title=Concept for Energy Security Matrix|journal=Energy Policy|volume=95|pages=1–9|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2016.04.034}}</ref>

Even now being a part of the European Union, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are still considered as the most vulnerable EU member states in the energy sphere.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Molis|first=Arūnas|date=September 2011|title=Building methodology, assessing the risks: the case of energy security in the Baltic States|journal=Baltic Journal of Economics|volume=11|issue=2|pages=59–80|doi=10.1080/1406099x.2011.10840501|issn=1406-099X|doi-access=free}}</ref> Due to their Soviet past, Baltic states have several gas pipelines on their territories coming from Russia. Moreover, several routes of oil delivery also have been sustained from Soviet times: These are ports in Ventspils, Butinge and Tallinn.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Mauring|first=Liina|date=2006|title=The Effects of the Russian Energy Sector on the Security of the Baltic States|journal=Baltic Security & Defence Review|volume=8|pages=66–80|issn=2382-9230}}</ref> Therefore, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania play a significant role not only in consuming, but also in distribution of Russian energy fuels extracting transaction fees.<ref name=":2" /> So, the overall EU dependence on the Russia's energy supplies from the one hand and the need of Baltic states to import energy fuels from their closer hydrocarbon-rich neighbor creates a tension that could jeopardize the energy security of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.<ref name=":2" />

As a part of the EU from 2004, Baltic states must comply with the EU's regulations in energy, environmental and security spheres. One of the most important documents that the EU applied to improve the energy security stance of the Baltic states are [[European Union climate and energy package]], including the Climate and Energy Strategy 2020, that aims to reduce the greenhouse emissions to 20%, increase the energy production from renewables for 20% in overall share and 20% energy efficiency development.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=da Graça Carvalho|first=Maria|date=April 2012|title=EU energy and climate change strategy|journal=Energy|volume=40|issue=1|pages=19–22|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2012.01.012}}</ref>

===Assessment===
The calculations take into account not only economic, but also technological and energy-related factors: Energy and carbon intensity of transport and households, trade balance of total energy, energy import dependency, diversification of energy mix, etc.<ref name=":0" /> It was stated that from 2008, Baltic states experiences a positive change in their energy security score. They diversified their oil import suppliers due to shutdown of Druzhba gas pipeline in 2006 and increased the share of renewable sources in total energy production with the help of the EU policies.<ref name=":0" />

Estonia usually was the best performing country in terms of energy security, but new assessment shows that even though Estonia has the highest share of renewables in the energy production, its energy economy has been still characterized by high rates of carbon intensity. Lithuania, in contrast, achieved the best results on carbon intensity of economy but its energy dependence level is still very high. Latvia performed the best according to all indicators. Especially, the high share of renewables were introduced to the energy production of Latvia, that can be explained by the state's geographical location and favorable natural conditions.<ref name=":0" />

===Possible threats to energy security===
Firstly, there is a major risk of energy supply disruption. Even if there are several electricity interconnectors that connect the area with electricity-rich states ([[Estlink|Estonia-Finland interconnector]], [[LitPol Link|Lithuania-Poland interconnector]], [[NordBalt|Lithuania-Sweden interconnector]]), the pipeline supply of natural gas and tanker supply of oil are unreliable without modernization of energy infrastructure.<ref name=":1" />

Secondly, the dependence on single supplier – Russia – is not healthy both for economics and politics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nader|first=Philippe Bou|date=1 June 2017|title=The Baltic states should adopt the self-defence pinpricks doctrine: the "accumulation of events" threshold as a deterrent to Russian hybrid warfare|journal=Journal on Baltic Security|volume=3|issue=1|pages=11–24|doi=10.1515/jobs-2017-0003|issn=2382-9230|doi-access=free}}</ref> As it was in 2009 during the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute, when states of Eastern Europe were deprived from access to the natural gas deliveries, the reoccurrence of the situation may again lead to economic, political and social crisis. Therefore, the diversification of suppliers is needed.<ref name=":1" />

Finally, the low technological enhancement results in slow adaptation of new technologies, such as construction and use of renewable sources of energy. This also poses a threat to energy security of the Baltic states, because slows down the renewable energy consumption and lead to low rates of energy efficiency.<ref name=":1" />

==Economies==
{{Main|Baltic Tiger}}Economically, parallel with the political changes, and the democratic transition, – as a rule of law states – the previous command economies were transformed via the legislation into market economies, and set up or renewed the major macroeconomic factors: budgetary rules, national audit, national currency and central bank. Generally, they shortly encountered the following problems: high inflation, high unemployment, low economic growth and high government debt. The inflation rate, in the examined area, relatively quickly dropped to below 5% by 2000. Meanwhile, these economies were stabilised, and in 2004 [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|all of them joined]] the European Union. New macroeconomic requirements have arisen for them; the [[Maastricht criteria]] became obligatory and later the [[Stability and Growth Pact]] set stricter rules through national legislation by implementing the regulations and directives of the Sixpack, because the financial crisis was a shocking milestone.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vértesy|first=László|title=Macroeconomic Legal Trends in the EU11 Countries|url=http://www.dialogcampus.hu/users/default/dialogcampus/uploads/elektronikus_konyvek/pga2018_01_09_vertesy.pdf|journal=Public Governance, Administration and Finances Law Review|volume= 3|number=1|date=2018}}</ref>

==Culture==

{{legend|#0F00CD |[[Finnic languages|Finnic]] (Finland, Estonia)}}
{{legend|#0EDDA8 |[[Baltic languages|Baltic]] (Latvia, Lithuania)}}]]
[[Estonians]] are [[Baltic Finns|Finnic people]], together with the nearby [[Finland|Finns]]. The [[Latvians]] and [[Lithuanians]], linguistically and culturally related to each other, are [[Balts|Baltic]] and [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] people. The peoples in the Baltic states have together inhabited the eastern coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] for millennia, although not always peacefully in ancient times, over which period their populations, Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian, have remained remarkably stable within the approximate territorial boundaries of the current Baltic states. While separate peoples with their own customs and traditions, historical factors have introduced cultural commonalities across and differences within them.

The populations of each Baltic country belong to several Christian denominations, a reflection of historical circumstances. Both Western and Eastern Christianity had been introduced by the end of the first millennium. The current divide between [[Lutheranism]] to the north and Catholicism to the south is the remnant of [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] and [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish]] hegemony, respectively, with [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] remaining the dominant faith among Russian and other East Slavic minorities.

The Baltic states have historically been in many different spheres of influence, from Danish over Swedish and [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian]], to German ([[Hanseatic League|Hansa]] and [[Holy Roman Empire]]), and before independence in the Russian sphere of influence.

The Baltic states have a considerable [[Slavs|Slavic]] minority: in Latvia: 33.0% (including 25.4% [[Russians in Latvia|Russian]], 3.3% [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], 2.2% [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], and 2.1% [[Polish language|Polish]]),<ref>{{cite web

The Soviet Union conducted a policy of Russification by encouraging Russians and other Russian-speaking ethnic groups of the Soviet Union to settle in the Baltic Republics. Today, ethnic [[Baltic Russians|Russian immigrants]] from the former Soviet Union and their descendants make up a sizable minority in the Baltic states, particularly in Latvia (about one-quarter of the total population and close to one-half in the capital Riga) and Estonia (one-quarter of the population).

Because the three Baltic states were independent states prior to their [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupation]] by the Soviet Union, there was a strong feeling of national identity (often labeled "bourgeois nationalism" by Soviets) and popular resentment towards the imposed Soviet rule in the three countries, in combination with Soviet cultural policy, which employed superficial multiculturalism (in order for the Soviet Union to appear as a multinational union based on free will of peoples) in limits allowed by the Communist "internationalist" (but in effect pro-[[Russification]]) ideology and under tight control of the Communist Party (those of the Baltic nationals who crossed the line were called "bourgeois nationalists" and repressed). This let Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians preserve a high degree of Europe-oriented national identity.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

}}</ref> In Soviet times this made them appear as the "West" of the Soviet Union in the cultural and political sense, thus as close to emigration a Russian could get without leaving the Soviet Union.

===Languages===
The languages of Baltic nations belong to two distinct language families. The [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] languages belong to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]] and are the only extant members of the [[Baltic languages|Baltic language group]] (or more specifically, Eastern Baltic subgroup of Baltic).

The [[Estonian language]] is a [[Finnic language]], together with neighboring Finland's [[Finnish language]].

[[File:Vilnius University Great Courtyard 1, Vilnius, Lithuania - Diliff.jpg|thumb|upright|Catholic [[Church of St. Johns, Vilnius|Church of St. Johns]], [[Vilnius]], Lithuania]]
Apart from the indigenous languages, German was the dominant language in Estonia and Latvia in academics, professional life, and upper society from the 13th century until World War I. [[Polish language|Polish]] served a similar function in Lithuania. Numerous [[Swedish language|Swedish]] loanwords have made it into the Estonian language; it was under the Swedish rule that schools were established and education propagated in the 17th century. Swedish remains spoken in Estonia, particularly the [[Estonian Swedish]] dialect of the [[Estonian Swedes]] of [[Aiboland|northern Estonia and the islands]] (though many fled to Sweden as the [[Soviet Union]] [[Baltic Offensive|invaded]] and [[Occupation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1944)|re-occupied]] Estonia in 1944). There is also significant proficiency in Finnish in Estonia owing to its closeness to the native Estonian and also the widespread practice of listening to Finnish broadcasts during the Soviet era. Russian also achieved significant usage, particularly in commerce.

Russian was the most commonly studied foreign language at all levels of schooling during the Soviet era. Despite schooling available and administration conducted in local languages, Russian settlers were neither encouraged nor motivated to learn the official local languages, so knowledge of Russian became a practical necessity in daily life. Even to this day, the majority of the population of the Baltic states profess to be proficient in Russian, especially those who lived during Soviet rule. Meanwhile, the minority of Russian origin generally do not speak the national language. The question of their assimilation is a major factor in social and diplomatic affairs.<ref>{{cite book

===Sports===
[[Basketball]] is a notable sport across the Baltic states. Teams from the three countries compete in the respective national championships and the [[Baltic Basketball League]]. The Lithuanian teams have been the strongest, with the [[BC Žalgiris]] winning the 1999 [[FIBA Euroleague]].

The [[Lithuania men's national basketball team]] has won the [[EuroBasket]] on three occasions and has claimed third place at the 2010 World Cup and three Olympic tournaments. Meanwhile, the [[Latvian national basketball team|Latvia men's national basketball team]] won the 1935 Eurobasket and finished second in 1939, but has performed poorly since the 1990s. Lithuania hosted the Eurobasket in 1939 and 2011, whereas Latvia was one of the hosts in 2015. The historic Lithuanian basketball team [[Kauno Žalgiris]] won the [[Euroleague]] in 1999. However, the [[Latvia women's national basketball team]] finished fourth at the 2007 Eurobasket.

[[Ice hockey]] is also popular in Latvia. [[Dinamo Riga]] is the country's strongest hockey club, playing in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]]. The [[2006 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships]] were held in Latvia.

[[Association football]] is popular in the Baltic states, but the only appearance of a Baltic team in a major international competition was [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]]'s qualification for [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]]. The national teams of the three states have played in the [[Baltic Cup (football)|Baltic Cup]] since 1928.

Estonian and Soviet chess grandmaster [[Paul Keres]] was among the world's top players from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s. He narrowly missed a chance at a World Chess Championship match on five occasions.

Estonian [[Markko Märtin]] was successful in the [[World Rally Championship]] in the early 2000s, where he got five wins and 18 podiums, as well as a third place in the [[2004 World Rally Championship|2004 drivers' championship]].

[[Ott Tänak]] of Estonia won the 2019 World Rally Championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fia.com/events/world-rally-championship/season-2019/standings|title=Standings|date=22 January 2015|website=Federation Internationale de l'Automobile|language=en|access-date=5 December 2019}}</ref>

Latvian tennis player [[Jeļena Ostapenko]] won the [[2017 French Open]], another Latvian tennis player [[Ernests Gulbis]] was a semi-finalist at the 2010 Rome Masters and 2014 French Open.
