'''Hamas''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: حماس ''Ḥamās'', an [[acronym]] of حركة المقاومة الاسلامية ''Ḥarakat al-Muqāwamah al-ʾIslāmiyyah'' [Islamic Resistance Movement]) is a [[Palestinian Territories|Palestinian]] [[Sunni]]-[[Islam]]ic [[fundamentalist]]{{efn|"Hamas is a radical Islamic fundamentalist organization that has stated that its highest priority is a Jihad (holy war) for the liberation of Palestine."{{sfn|Cordesman|2002|p=243}}}} but [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]],{{efn|"In fundamentalist movements, support is usually gained at the price of conformity, by publicly renouncing any tactic that could offset the group'sw normative values.

Hizbullah in Lebanon is a political party, and it also has its militant organisations. The [[Mujahideen]], who were the leading militants in Afghanistan, have joined the political process in their country after more that 20 years of war. Being a militant and joining the political platform is not a sin. If we leave the Middle East and look at Sinn Fein, for example, in Northern Ireland, this group was fighting the British government and then, through engagement and direct negotiation, extremist influence was marginalised, and Sinn Fein found an opportunity to moderate itself."{{sfn|Zweiri|2006|p=681}}}}{{efn|"The idea of a militant movement like Hamas possessing both political and military personas simultaneously is not especially new, with the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]]/[[Sinn Féin]] and the Lebanese movement [[Hezbollah]] being two often cited examples.

This offer was first made by Sheikh Yassin in the mid-1990s, and is regularly repeated by Hamas leaders in an effort to demonstrate that the movement can adapt to circumstances. 'We are with a state on the 1967 borders, based on a long-term truce,' said Khaled Meshaal, the head of Hamas's Political Bureau, in Damascus in May 2009. Meshaal assumed leadership of the movement after Israel assassinated Sheikh Yassin, but steadfastly refused to recognize Israel and loaded his offer with conditions. Defining 'long-term' as ten years, he said the proposed state must include 'East Jerusalem, the dismantling of settlements and the right of return of the Palestinian refugees'."{{sfn|Milton-Edwards|Farrell|2013|pp=7-8}}}}

In the January 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections, Hamas won a majority in the Palestinian Parliament,{{sfn|Hueston|Pierpaoli|Zahar|2014|p=67}} defeating the PLO-affiliated [[Fatah]] party. After the elections, the [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]] (the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States) made future foreign assistance to the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA) conditional upon the PNA's commitment to nonviolence, recognition of the state of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements.

==Etymology==
''Hamas'' is an [[acronym]] of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase حركة المقاومة الاسلامية or ''Harakat al-Muqāwama al-Islāmiyya'', meaning "Islamic Resistance Movement". This acronym, HMS, was later glossed in the [[Hamas Covenant]]{{sfn|Jefferis|2016|p=119}} by the Arabic word 'hamas' (حماس) which itself means "zeal", "strength," "bravery".{{sfn|Herzog|2006|p=84}} In Hebrew, there is a similar-sounding word, ''ḥāmās'' (חמס) connoting 'violence' and it has been suggested that the phonemic resemblance between the two terms may have conduced to abetting acrimonious relations between Israel and this Palestinian movement.{{sfn|Ahmed|2007|p=170}}

==Aims==
Hamas, as its name (Islamic Resistance Movement) implies, aims to liberate Palestine from the Israeli occupation, and transform the country into an Islamic state. Which of these two objectives is the primary goal is disputed.{{sfn|Dalacoura|2011|p=67}} The movement's original charter committed it to waging an armed struggle to destroy the state of Israel.{{sfn|O'Malley|2015|p=118}}

==Leadership and structure==
[[File:Hamasleadership.png|thumb|Map of key Hamas leadership nodes. 2010]]
[[File:Khaled Meshaal 01.jpg|thumb|Longtime leader, [[Khaled Meshaal]]]]
Hamas inherited from its predecessor a tripartite structure that consisted in the provision of social services, of religious training and military operations under a Shura Council. Traditionally it had four distinct functions: (a) a charitable social welfare division (''dawah''); (b) a military division for procuring weapons and undertaking operations (''al-Mujahideen al Filastinun''); (c) a security service (''Jehaz Aman''); and (d) a media branch (''A'alam'').{{sfn|Levitt|2006|pp=10-11}} Hamas has both an internal leadership within the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and an external leadership, split between a Gaza group directed by [[Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook]] from his exile first in Damascus and then in Egypt, and a Kuwaiti group (''Kuwaidia'') under [[Khaled Mashal]].{{sfn|Levitt|2006|pp=11-12}} The Kuwaiti group of Palestinian exiles began to receive extensive funding from the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf States]] after its leader Mashal broke with [[Yasser Arafat]]'s decision to side with [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Invasion of Kuwait]], with Mashal insisting that Iraq withdraw.{{sfn|Roy|2013|p=30}} On May 6, 2017, [[Majlis al-Shura|Hamas' Shura Council]] chose [[Ismail Haniya]] to become the new leader, to replace Mashal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/06/middleeast/hamas-leadership-ismail-haniya/index.html|title=Ismail Haniya elected new Hamas leader|author=Andrew Carey and Joe Sterling|website=CNN}}</ref>

The exact nature of the organization is unclear, secrecy being maintained for fear of Israeli assassinations and to conceal operational activities. Formally, Hamas maintains the wings are separate and independent. Matthew Levitt maintains this is a public myth. Davis argues that they are both separate and combined for reasons of internal and external political necessity. Communication between the political and military wings of Hamas is difficult, owing to the thoroughness of Israeli intelligence surveillance and the existence of an extensive base of informants. After the assassination of [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi]] the occasional political direction of the militant wing diminished, with field commanders given discretional autonomy on operations.{{sfn|Davis|2016|pp=44-45}}

===Consultative councils===
The governing body is the [[Majlis al-Shura]]. The principle behind the council is based on the [[Qur'an]]ic concept of consultation and popular assembly (''[[shura]]''), which Hamas leaders argue provides for democracy within an Islamic framework.<ref>A. Hovdenak, 'Hamas in Transition:The Failure of Sanctions,' in Michelle Pace, Peter Seeberg (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=RgLcAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA64 ''The European Union's Democratization Agenda in the Mediterranean,''] Routledge, 2013 pp. 50–79 [64].</ref> As the organization grew more complex and Israeli pressure increased it needed a broader base for decisions, the Shura Council was renamed the 'General Consultative Council', elected from members of local council groups and this in turn elected a 15-member [[Politburo]] (''al-Maktab al-Siyasi'')<ref>Peter Mandaville,[https://books.google.com/books?id=2bvcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA282 ''Islam and Politics,''] Routledge, 2014 Rev.ed, p. 282.</ref> that made decisions at the highest level. Representatives come from Gaza, the West Bank, leaders in exile and [[Administrative detention|Israeli prisons]].<ref name="Berti" >Benedetta Berti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EUcDAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA88 ''Armed Political Organizations: From Conflict to Integration,''] JHU Press, 2013 p. 88.</ref> This organ was located in [[Damascus]] until the [[Syrian Civil War]] led it to transfer to [[Qatar]] in January 2012, when Hamas sided with the civil opposition against the regime of [[Bashar al-Assad]].<ref name="Berti" /><ref>Mohammed Ayoob, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ph6eAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT47 ''Will the Middle East Implode?,''] John Wiley & Sons, 2014 p. 47.</ref>

===Social services wing===
Hamas developed its social welfare programme by replicating the model established by Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood. For them, charity and the development of one's community are prescribed by religion, and, at the same time, are to be understood as forms of resistance.{{sfn|Dunning|2016|p=136}} In Islamic tradition ''dawah'' (lit.'the call to God') obliges the faithful to reach out to others by both proselytising and by charitable works, and typically the latter centre on the mosques which make use of both [[waqf]] endowment resources and charitable donations ([[zakat|zakat, one of the five pillars of Islam]]) to fund grassroots services like nurseries, schools, orphanages, soup kitchens, women's activities, library services and even sporting clubs within a larger context of preaching and political discussions.{{sfn|Levitt|2006|pp=16-23}} In the 1990s, some 85% of its budget was allocated to the provision of social services.{{sfn|Phillips|2011|p=78}} It has been called perhaps the most significant social services actor in Palestine. By 2000 it or its affiliated charities ran roughly 40% of the social institutions in the West Bank and Gaza and, with other Islamic charities, by 2005 was supporting 120,000 individuals with monthly financial support in Gaza.{{sfn|Shitrit|2015|p=71}} Part of the appeal of these institutions is that they fill a vacuum in the administration by the PLO of the Palestinian territories, which had failed to cater to the demand for jobs and broad social services, and is widely viewed as corrupt.{{sfn|Phillips|2011|p=75}} As late as 2005, the budget of Hamas, drawing on global charity contributions, was mostly tied up in covering running expenses for its social programmes, which extended from the supply of housing, food and water for the needy to more general functions like financial aid, medical assistance, educational development and religious instruction. A certain accounting flexibility allowed these funds to cover both charitable causes and military operations, permitting transfer from one to the other.{{sfn|Davis|2016|pp=47ff}}

The ''dawah'' infrastructure itself was understood, within the Palestinian context, as providing the soil from which a militant opposition to the occupation would flower.{{efn|'In a 1995 lecture, Sheikh Jamil Hamami, a party to the foundation of Hamas and a senior member of its West Bank leadership, expounded the importance of Hamas' dawa infrastructure as the soil from which militancy would flower.'{{sfn|Levitt|2006|p=23}}}} In this regard it differs from the rival [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] which lacks any social welfare network, and relies on spectacular terrorist attacks to recruit adherents.{{sfn|Levitt|2006|pp=25-26}} In 2007, through funding from Iran, Hamas managed to allocate at a cost of $60&nbsp;million, monthly stipends of $100 for 100,000 workers, and a similar sum for 3,000 fishermen [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip#Effect on the fishing industry|laid idle by Israel's imposition of restrictions]] on fishing offshore, plus grants totalling $45&nbsp;million to detainees and their families.<ref>Mohsen Saleh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LGVkCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 ''The Palestinian Strategic Report 2006,''] Al Manhal, 2007 p. 198.</ref> [[Matthew Levitt]] argues that Hamas grants to people are subject to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis of how beneficiaries will support Hamas, with those linked to terrorist activities receiving more than others.<ref>James J.F. Forrest, 'Conclusion', in James Dingley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CVJ_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA290 ''Combating Terrorism in Northern Ireland,''] Routledge, 2008 pp. 280–300 [290].</ref> Israel holds the families of suicide bombers accountable and bulldozes their homes, whereas the families of Hamas activists who have been killed or wounded during militant operations are given an initial, one-time grant varying between $500–$5,000, together with a $100 monthly allowance. Rent assistance is also given to families whose homes have been destroyed by Israeli bombing though families unaffiliated with Hamas are said to receive less.{{sfn|Phillips|2011|p=81}}{{sfn|Levitt|2006|pp=122-123}}

Until 2007, these activities extended to the West Bank, but, after a PLO crackdown, now continue exclusively in the Gaza Strip.{{sfn|Davis|2016|p=48}} After the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état]] deposed the elected Muslim Brotherhood government of [[Mohamed Morsi]] in 2013, Hamas found itself in a financial straitjacket and has since endeavoured to throw the burden of responsibility for public works infrastructure in the Gaza Strip back onto the Palestinian National Authority, but without success.{{sfn|Davis|2016|pp=48-49}}

===Military wing===
{{main|Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades}}
[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Weapons Found in a Mosque During Cast Lead (2).jpg|thumb|Weapons found in a mosque during [[Operation Cast Lead]], according to the IDF]]

The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades is Hamas's military wing. By the time of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Hamas's laboratories had devised a primitive form of rocketry, the Qassam 1, which they first launched in October 2000, carrying a 500 gram warhead with a throw range of 4 kilometres. Both propellant and the explosive were manufactured from chemical fertilizers, though TNT was also tried.{{sfn|Sabry|2015|p=65}} Over the next five years of the conflict, a 3-kilogram-warhead-armed version with a strike range of 6–8 kilometres, the Qassam 2, was also produced{{sfn|Najib|Friedrich|2007|p=107}} and in an incremental rise, these rocket types were fired towards Israeli settlements along the Gaza Strip: 4 in 2001, 35 in 2002, 155 in 2003, 281 in 2004, and 179 in 2005. By 2005, the Qassam 3 had been engineered with a 12–14 kilometre range and a 15 kilo warhead. By 2006, 942 such rockets were launched into southern Israel.{{sfn|Sabry|2015|p=67}} During the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|War with Israel in 2008–2009]], Hamas deployed [[BM-21 Grad|122-mm Grad rocketry]] with a 20–40 kilometre range and a 30 kilogram warhead and a variety of guided [[9M133 Kornet|Kornet]] antitank missiles.{{sfn|Sabry|2015|p=73}} By 2012 Hamas had engineered a version of the [[Fajr-5]] rocket, which was capable of reaching as far as [[Tel Aviv]], as was shown after the assassination of [[Ahmed Jabari]] in that year. In the 2014 war its advanced rocketry reached Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and [[Haifa]].{{sfn|Jefferis|2016|p=119}}

While the number of members is known only to the Brigades leadership, Israel estimates the Brigades have a core of several hundred members who receive [[Military training|military style training]], including training in Iran and in [[Syria]] (before the Syrian Civil War).{{sfn|Guidère|2012|p=173}} Additionally, the brigades have an estimated 10,000–17,000 operatives,.{{sfn|Shitrit|2015|p=71}}{{sfn|Najib|Friedrich|2007|p=106}}forming a backup force whenever circumstances call for reinforcements for the Brigade. Recruitment training lasts for two years.{{sfn|Guidère|2012|p=173}} The group's ideology outlines its aim as the liberation of Palestine and the restoration of Palestinian rights under the dispensations set forth in the Qur'an, and this translates into three policy priorities:

<blockquote>To evoke the spirit of Jihad (Resistance) among Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims; to defend Palestinians and their land against the Zionist occupation and its manifestations; to liberate Palestinians and their land that was usurped by the Zionist occupation forces and settlers.{{sfn|Najib|Friedrich|2007|p=105}}</blockquote>

According to its official stipulations, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades' military operations are to be restricted to operating only inside Palestine, engaging with Israeli soldiers,{{efn|'Consistent attacks on army units by Hamas activists are as new as the use of anti-tank missiles against civilian homes by the Israeli military.'{{sfn|Roy|1993|p=21}}}} and in exercising the right of self-defense against armed settlers. They are to avoid civilian targets, to respect the enemy's humanity by refraining from mutilation, defacement or excessive killing, and to avoid targeting Westerners either in the occupied zones or beyond.{{sfn|Najib|Friedrich|2007|pp=105-106}}

Down to 2007, the Brigades are estimated to have lost some 800 operatives in conflicts with Israeli forces. The leadership has been consistently undermined by targeted assassinations. Aside from [[Yahya Ayyash]] (January 5, 1996), it has lost [[Emad Akel]] (November 24, 1993) [[Salah Shehade]], (July 23, 2002), [[Ibrahim al-Makadmeh]], (March 8, 2003) [[Ismail Abu Shanab]], (August 21, 2003) [[Ahmed Yassin]] (March 22, 2004) and [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi]],( April 17, 2004).,{{sfn|Najib|Friedrich|2007|p=107}}{{sfn|Hueston|Pierpaoli|Zahar|2014|p=67}}

The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades groups its fighters in 4–5 man cells, which in turn are integrated into companies and battalions. Unlike the political section, which is split between an internal and external structure, the Brigades are under a local Palestinian leadership, and disobedience with the decisions taken by the political leadership have been relatively rare.{{sfn|Najib|Friedrich|2007|pp=107-108}}

Although the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades are an integral part of Hamas, the exact nature of the relationship is hotly debated. They appear to operate at times independently of Hamas, exercising a certain autonomy.{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=100}}{{sfn|Herrick|2011|p=?}}<ref>Mandaville, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2bvcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA282 p. 282].</ref>{{sfn|Levitt|2008|pp=89ff.}} <ref>John L.Esposito, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SlhxoTHLxeMC&pg=PA231 ''Islam and Violence,''] [[Syracuse University Press]] 1998 p. 231.</ref> Some cells have independent links with the external leadership, enabling them to bypass the hierarchical command chain and political leadership in Gaza.{{sfn|Gunning|2007|pp=123-155|ps=: p. 134}} Ilana Kass and Bard O'Neill, likening Hamas's relationship with the Brigades to the political party [[Sinn Féin]]'s relationship to the military arm of the [[Irish Republican Army]]. quote a senior Hamas official as stating: "The Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigade is a separate armed military wing, which has its own leaders who do not take their orders from Hamas and do not tell us of their plans in advance."{{sfn|Kass|O'Neill|1997|p=267}}{{efn|[[Matthew Levitt]] on the other hand claims that Hamas's welfare institutions act as a mere façade or front for the financing of terrorism, and dismisses the idea of two wings as a 'myth'.{{sfn|Herrick|2011|p=179}} He cites Ahmad Yassin stating in 1998: "We can not separate the wing from the body.

==Finances and funding==
Hamas, like its predecessor the Muslim Brotherhood, assumed the administration of Gaza's waqf properties, endowments which extend over 10% of all real estate in the Gaza Strip, with 2,000 acres of agricultural land held in religious trusts, together with numerous shops, rentable apartments and public buildings.{{sfn|Abu Amr|1993|p=8}}
  
In the first five years of the Ist Intifada, the Gaza economy, 50% of which depended on external sources of income, plummeted by 30–50% as Israel closed its labour market and remittances from the [[Palestinian diaspora|Palestinian expatriates]] in the Gulf countries dried up following the 1991-1992 [[Gulf War]].{{sfn|Roy|1993|p=21}} At the 1993 Philadelphia conference, Hamas leaders' statements indicated that they read [[George H. W. Bush]]'s outline of a [[New world order (politics)|New World Order]] as embodying a [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|tacit aim]] to destroy Islam, and that therefore funding should focus on enhancing the Islamic roots of Palestinian society and promoting jihad, which also means zeal for social justice, in the occupied territories.{{sfn|Levitt|2006|p=148}} Hamas became particularly fastidious about maintaining separate resourcing for its respective branches of activity—military, political and social services.{{sfn|Vittori|2011|p=72}} It has had a holding company in East Jerusalem (''Beit al-Mal''), a 20% stake in Al Aqsa International Bank which served as its financial arm, the Sunuqrut Global Group and al-Ajouli money-changing firm.{{sfn|Vittori|2011|p=73}}

By 2011, Hamas's budget, calculated to be roughly US$70&nbsp;million, derived even more substantially (85%) from foreign, rather than internal Palestinian, sources.{{sfn|Vittori|2011|p=73}} Only two Israeli-Palestinian sources figure in a list seized in 2004, while the other contributors were donor bodies located in Jordan, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Britain, Germany, the United States, United Arab Emirates, Italy and France. Much of the money raised comes from sources that direct their assistance to what Hamas describes as its charitable work for Palestinians, but investments in support of its ideological position are also relevant, with Persian Gulf States and Saudi Arabia prominent in the latter. Matthew Levitt claims that Hamas also taps money from corporations, criminal organizations and financial networks that support terror.{{sfn|Levitt|2006|pp=143-144}} It is also alleged that it engages in cigarette and drug smuggling, multimedia copyright infringement and credit card fraud.{{sfn|Vittori|2011|p=73}} The United States, Israel and the EU have shut down many charities and organs that channel money to Hamas, such as the Holy Land Foundation for Relief.{{sfn|Clarke|2015|p=97}} Between 1992 and 2001, this group is said to have provided $6.8&nbsp;million to Palestinian charities of the $57&nbsp;million collected. By 2001, it was alleged to have given Hamas $13&nbsp;million, and was shut down shortly afterwards.<ref>Interpal and Development and the Al-Aqsa Charitable Foundation Fund. pp.&nbsp;146, 154–59.</ref>

After 2009, [[sanctions on Iran]] made funding difficult, forcing Hamas to rely on religious donations by individuals in the West Bank, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Funds amounting to tens of millions of dollars raised in the Gulf states were transferred through the [[Rafah Border Crossing]]. These were not sufficient to cover the costs of governing the Strip and running the al Qassam Brigades, and when tensions arose with Iran over support of President Assad in Syria, Iran dropped its financial assistance to the government, restricting its funding to the military wing, which meant a drop from $150&nbsp;million in 2012 to $60&nbsp;million the following year. A further drop occurred in 2015 when Hamas expressed its criticisms of Iran's role in the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|Yemeni Civil War]].<ref>Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA173 p. 173].</ref>

In 2017, the PA government imposed its own sanctions against Gaza, including, among other things, cutting off salaries to thousands of PA employees, as well as financial assistance to hundreds of families in the Gaza Strip. The PA initially said it would stop paying for the electricity and fuel that Israel supplies to the Gaza Strip, but after a year partially backtracked.<ref>[https://m.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Palestinian-Authority-rejects-Israeli-US-ideas-to-help-Gaza-560921 PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY REJECTS ISRAELI, U.S. IDEAS TO HELP GAZA]</ref> The Israeli government has allowed millions of dollars from [[Qatar]] to be funneled on a regular basis through Israel to Hamas, to replace the millions of dollars the PA had stopped transferring to Hamas.

==History==
{{Main|History of Hamas}}

=== Origins ===
Hamas origins can be traced to the foundation of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Egypt in 1928.{{sfn|Kabahā|2014|p=322}} The Muslim Brotherhood arose as an attempt to have Islamic values extend beyond the mosque into the secular sphere, where it challenged the core assumptions, social, political, ideological, nationalist and economic of the existing ruling order.{{sfn|Milton-Edwards|2015|p=6}} In 1935 it established  contacts in [[Mandatory Palestine]] and in 1945 inaugurated its first branch in Jerusalem.{{sfn|Abu Amr|1993|p=6}} Following the Nakba in 1948, which shattered Palestinian society, the Muslim Brotherhood was one of the first organizations to reestablish itself among the Palestinians.{{sfn|Kabahā|2014|p=322}}

When Israel occupied the Palestinian territories in 1967, the Muslim Brotherhood members did not take active part in the resistance, preferring to focus on social-religious reform and on restoring Islamic values.{{sfn|Kabahā|2014|pp=322-323}} This outlook changed in the early 1980s and Islamic organizations became more involved in Palestinian politics.{{sfn|Kabahā|2014|pp=323}} The driving force behind this transformation was Ahmed Yassin, a Palestinian refugee from [[Al-Jura]].{{sfn|Kabahā|2014|pp=323}} Of humble origins and [[quadriplegic]],{{sfn|Kabahā|2014|pp=323}} he persevered to become one the Muslim Brotherhood's leaders in Gaza. His charisma and conviction brought him a loyal group of followers, who he, as a [[quadriplegic]], depended on for everything - from feeding him, to transporting him to and from events, and to communicate his strategy to the public.{{sfn|Jefferis|2016|pp=50-51}}

In 1973, Yassin founded the social-religious charity ''[[al-Mujama al-Islamiya]]'' ("Islamic center") in Gaza as an offshoot to the Muslim Brotherhood.{{sfn|Abu Amr|1994|p=16}}{{sfn|Singh|2013|p=153}} The Israeli authorities encouraged Yassin's charity to expand as they saw it as a useful counterbalance to the secular [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].{{sfn|Levitt|2006|p=24}}{{sfn|Mattar|2005|p=195}}{{sfn|Hassan|2014|p=80}}{{sfn|Abu Amr|1994|p=31}} Yitzhak Segev, who was the Israeli military governor of Gaza at the time, recalled that they even funded his charity: "The Israeli government gave me a budget, and the military government gives to the mosques".{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=47}} Israel's religious affairs official in Gaza, [[Avner Cohen]], later regretfully concluded that Hamas was created by Israel. He claimed to have warned his superiors not to back the Islamists.{{sfn|Higgins|2009}}

In 1984 Yassin was arrested after the Israelis found out that his group collected arms,{{sfn|Higgins|2009}} but released in May 1985 as part of a [[Jibril Agreement|prisoner exchange]].{{sfn|Levitt|2006|p=35}}{{sfn|Mannes|2004|p=114}} He continued to expand the reach of his charity in Gaza.{{sfn|Higgins|2009}} Following his release, he set up ''al-Majd'' (an acronym for Munazamat al-Jihad wa al-Da'wa), headed by former student leader [[Yahya Sinwar]] and [[Rawhi Mushtaha]], tasked with handling internal security and hunting local informants for the Israeli intelligence services.{{sfn|Mishal|Sela|2006|p=34}}{{sfn|Milton-Edwards|Farrell|2013|p=116}} At about the same time, he ordered former student leader [[Salah Shehade]] to set up ''al-Mujahidun al-Filastiniun'' (Palestinian fighters), but its militants were quickly rounded up by Israeli authorities and had their arms confiscated.{{sfn|Najib|Friedrich|2007|p=103}}{{efn|It is unclear whether these groups were set up in 1985 or 1986.}}

The idea of Hamas began to take form on December 10, 1987,  when several members of the Brotherhood{{efn|Abu Amr states the following people who attended that day: Dr. 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Rantisi (40), a physician residing in [[Khan Yunis]]; Dr. Ibrahim al-Yazuri (45), a pharmacist residing in Gaza city; Shaykh Salih Shehada (40), a University instructor from [[Beit Hanoun]]; 'Isa al-Nashshar (35), an engineer in [[Rafah]]; Muhammad Sham'a (50), a teacher in [[Al-Shati Camp|al-Shati refugee camp]] and 'Abd al-Fattah Dukhan ( 50), a school principal at [[Nuseirat Camp|al-Nusayrat refugee camp]].{{sfn|Abu Amr|1993|p=10}}}}  convened  the day after an incident in which an Israeli army truck had crashed into a car at a [[Israeli checkpoint|Gaza checkpoint]] killing 4 Palestinian day-workers. They met at Yassin's house and decided that they too needed to react in some manner as the protest riots sparking the [[First Intifada]] erupted.{{sfn|Hueston|Pierpaoli|Zahar|2014|p=67}} A leaflet issued on the 14 December calling for resistance is considered to mark their first public intervention, though the name Hamas itself was not used until January 1988.{{sfn|Abu Amr|1993|p=10}}  Yassin was not directly connected to the organization but he gave it his blessing.{{sfn|Hueston|Pierpaoli|Zahar|2014|p=67}} In a meeting with the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood in February 1988, it too gave its approval.{{sfn|Hueston|Pierpaoli|Zahar|2014|p=68}} To many Palestinians it appeared to engage more authentically with their national expectations, since it merely provided an Islamic version of what had been the PLO's original goals, armed struggle to liberate all of Palestine, rather than the territorial compromise the PLO acquiesced in - a small fragment of Mandatory Palestine.{{sfn|Mishal|Sela|2006|pp=14-15}}

Creating Hamas as an entity distinct from the Muslim Brotherhood was a matter of practicality; the Muslim Brotherhood refused to engage in violence against Israel,{{sfn|AFPC|2014|p=272-278}} but without participating in the intifada, the Islamists tied to it feared they would lose support to their rivals the [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] and the [[PLO]]. They also hoped that by keeping its militant activities separate, Israel would not interfere with its social work.{{efn|'In truth, the creation of Hamas as a separate entity from the Muslim Brotherhood was done precisely to prevent Israeli authorities from targeting the organizations' greater activities, in the hopes that it would leave them relatively immune. Moreover, Hamas was created essentially because the Islamicists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood feared that without their direct participation in the first Intifada, they would lose supporters to both the PIJ and the PLO, the latter of which was anxious to reassert itself in the Palestinian territories after being marginalized following its expulsion from Lebanon. As authors Mishal and Sela, explain, "The Mujamma's decision to adopt a 'jihad now' policy against 'enemies of Allah' (through the creation of Hamas) was thus largely a matter of survival.'{{sfn|Mishal|Sela|2006|p=35}}{{sfn|Gleis|Berti|2012|p=119}}}}

Hamas published its charter in August 1988, wherein it defined itself as a chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood and its desire to establish "an Islamic state throughout Palestine" (for details on the charter see [[Hamas#Hamas Charter (1988)|Hamas Charter (1988)]]).{{sfn|Kabahā|2014|p=324}}

Co-founder Yassin was convinced that Israel was endeavouring to destroy Islam, and concluded that loyal Muslims had a religious obligation to destroy Israel.{{sfn|Neack|2008|p=101}} The short-term goal of Hamas was to liberate [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], including modern-day Israel, from [[Israeli occupation]]. The long-term aim sought to establish an [[Islamic republic|Islamic state]] from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, remarkably similar to, and perhaps derived from, the Zionist notion of the same area under a Jewish majority.{{efn|In nutshell, the notion of "Palestine from the river to the sea" is nothing but the boundaries of [[Eretz Israel]] as imagined by the first Zionists. The notion was enshrined in the founding charter of the ruling Likud party, which states that "between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty." One can thus entertain the chilling irony that Hamas owes its cherished slogan to the Zionists. After all, what is "free Palestine from the river to the sea" but a utopian parody of "Greater Israel"? {{sfn|Assi|2018}}}}

=== First Intifada ===
{{See also|First Intifada}}

Hamas first strike against Israel came in the spring 1989 as it [[Killing of Avi Sasportas and Ilan Saadon|abducted and killed Avi Sasportas and Ilan Saadon]], two Israeli soldiers.{{sfn|Holtmann|2009|p=13}} At the time, Shehade and Sinwar served time in Israeli prisons and Hamas had set up a new group, Unit 101, headed by [[Mahmoud al-Mabhouh]], whose objective was to abduct soldiers.{{sfn|Filiu|2014|pp=206-207}} The discovery of Sasportas' body triggered, in the words of [[Jean-Pierre Filiu]], 'an extremely violent Israeli response': hundreds of Hamas leaders and activists, among them Yassin, who was sentenced to life in prison, were arrested,{{sfn|Filiu|2014|p=207}} and Hamas was outlawed.{{sfn|Mannes|2004|p=114}} This mass detention of activists, together with a further wave of arrests in 1990, effectively dismantled Hamas and, devastated, it was forced to adapt;{{sfn|Byman|2011|p=99}}{{sfn|Filiu|2014|p=207}} its command system became regionalized to make its operative structure more diffuse,{{sfn|Phillips|2011|p=75}} and to minimize the chances of being detected.{{sfn|Gunning|2007|p=135}}

Anger following the [[1990 Temple Mount riots|al-Aqsa massacre]] in October 1990 in which Muslim worshippers had tried to prevent Orthodox Jews from placing a foundation stone for the Third Temple on the [[Temple Mount]] and Israeli police fired into the al-Aqsa mosque, killing 17, caused Hamas to intensify its campaign of abductions. Hamas declared every Israeli soldier a target{{sfn|Van Engeland|2015|p=319}} and called for a "jihad against the Zionist enemy everywhere, in all fronts and every means."{{sfn|Slater|2020|p=280}}

Hamas reorganized its units from ''al-Majd'' and ''al-Mujahidun al-Filastiniun'' into a military wing called the ''Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades'' led by [[Yahya Ayyash]] in the summer of 1991 or 1992.{{sfn|Davis|2016|p=68}}{{efn|Davis, de Búrca, and Dalacoura write that the Brigades were formed in 1991,{{sfn|Davis|2016|p=83}}{{sfn|de Búrca|2014|pp=100-102}}{{sfn|Dalacoura|2011|p=71}} Najib & Friedrich write that they were formed in the summer of 1991,{{sfn|Najib|Friedrich|2007|p=103}} and O'Malley that they were formed in 1992.{{sfn|O'Malley|2015|p=118}}}} The name comes from the [[Palestinian nationalism|militant Palestinian nationalist]] leader Sheikh [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]] who fought against the British and whose death in 1935 sparked the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]].{{sfn|Guidère|2012|p=173}} Though its members sometimes referred to themselves as "Students of Ayyash", "Students of the Engineer", or "Yahya Ayyash Units".{{sfn|Van Engeland|2015|p=319}} At the outset, weapons were hard to come by, and the organization began to resort to intermittent kidnappings of soldiers to secure arms and munitions.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Ayyash, an engineering graduate from [[Birzeit University]], was a skillful bomb maker and greatly improved Hamas' striking capability,{{sfn|Davis|2016|p=89}} earning him the nickname ''al-Muhandis'' ("the Engineer"). He is thought to have been one of the driving forces in Hamas' use of suicide bombings, arguing that "we paid a high price when we only used slingshots and stones. We need to exert more pressure, make the cost of the occupation that much more expensive in human lives, that much more unbearable".{{sfn|de Búrca|2014|p=109}} Until his assassination by Shin Bet in 1996,{{sfn|Van Engeland|2015|p=319}} almost all bombs used on suicide missions were constructed by him.{{sfn|Davis|2016|p=90}}

In December 1992 Israel responded to the killing of a border police officer by exiling 415 members of Hamas and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] to Southern Lebanon, at the time occupied by Israel.{{sfn|Dalacoura|2011|pp=71-72}} There Hamas established contacts with [[Hezbollah]], Palestinians living in refugee camps, and learnt how to construct suicide and car bombs.{{sfn|Mannes|2004|p=115}}{{sfn|Dalacoura|2011|pp=71-72}} Israel accompanied the deportations by the imposition of a two-week curfew on the Strip, causing an income shortfall for its economy of $1,810,000 per diem.{{sfn|Roy|1993|p=22}} The deportees were allowed to return nine months later.{{sfn|Mannes|2004|p=115}} The deportation provoked international condemnation and a unanimous UN Security Council resolution condemning the action.{{sfn|Platt|2010}}{{sfn|Chehab|2007|p=115}} Hamas ordered two car bombs in retaliation for the deportation.{{sfn|Slater|2020|p=280}}

Hamas first [[suicide attack|suicide bombing]] took place at [[Mehola Junction bombing|Mehola Junction]] in the West Bank in April 1993 using a car parked between two buses,{{sfn|Levitt|2006|pp=11-12}} carrying soldiers.{{sfn|Davis|2016|p=102}} Aside from the bomber, the blast killed a Palestinian that worked in a nearby settlement.{{sfn|Levitt|2006|pp=11-12}} The bomb design was flawed but Hamas would soon learn how to manufacture more lethal bombs.{{sfn|Byman|2011|p=100}}

==== Collaborators ====
In the first years of the Intifada, Hamas violence was restricted to Palestinians; [[Collaborationism|collaborators]] with Israel and individuals it defined as "moral deviants," that is, drug dealers and prostitutes known to enjoy ties with Israeli criminal networks,{{sfn|Swedenburg|2003|p=196}} or for engaging in loose behavior, in practice es defined as ''isqat'',{{efn|Islah Jad writes: "The Arabic word ''isqat'' has various literal meanings, most pertinently to 'tumble' or 'fall,' as into a trap. In the Palestinian context, it refers specifically to the methods used by the Israelis to manipulate or seduce victims and force them to work against their people's national interests."{{sfn|Jad|2018|p=132}}}} such as seducing women in hairdressing salons with alcohol, behaviour Hamas considered was encouraged by Israeli agents. Hamas leaders likened their rooting out of collaborators to what the [[French resistance]] did with Nazi collaborators in WW2. In 1992 alone they executed more than 150.{{sfn|Milton-Edwards|Farrell|2013|pp=118-120}} Details of the methods were published in  [[The New York Times]] in 1993. {{efn|'Our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into collaboration in the first place. ...There's another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators. I regard the "isqat"  of a single person as a greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, then it is our religious duty to execute him. A third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the Security Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.{{sfn|NYT|1993}}}} In Western media this was reported as typical "intercommunal strife" among Arabs.{{sfn|Swedenburg|2003|p=196}}

Hamas's actions  in the First Intifada expanded its popularity. In 1989 fewer than three percent of the Palestinians in Gaza supported Hamas.{{sfn|Byman|2011|p=99}} By October 1993 this figure had increased to 13.3%, a number that still paled in comparison to Fatah which enjoyed the support of 45% of the Palestinians in the occupied territories.{{sfn|Davis|2016|p=86}}

=== Oslo years ===
In February 1994, [[Baruch Goldstein]], a Jewish settler in military fatigues, [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre|massacred]] 29 Muslims at prayer in the [[Ibrahimi Mosque]] in [[Hebron]] in the [[West Bank]] during the month of [[Ramadan]]. An additional 19 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in the ensuing riots.{{sfn|Dunning|2016|p=34}} Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] condemned the massacre but fearing a confrontation with Hebron's violent settler community, he refused to withdraw them,{{sfn|Slater|2020|p=280}} and Hamas swore to avenge the deaths. In a communique it announced that if Israel didn't discriminate between "fighters and civilians" then it would be "forced ... to treat the Zionists in the same manner. Treating like with like is a universal principle."{{sfn|Milton-Edwards|Farrell|2013|p=92}}

At the end of the 40-day mourning period for Goldstein's victims, on April 6,{{sfn|Stork|Kane|2002|p=66}}{{sfn|Dunning|2016|p=34}} a suicide bomber [[Afula bus suicide bombing|blew up his car]] at a crowded bus stop in [[Afula]], killing eight Israelis and injuring 34.{{sfn|Stork|Kane|2002|p=66}} An additional five Israelis were killed and 30 injured as a [[Hadera bus station suicide bombing|Palestinian detonated himself]] on a bus in [[Hadera]] a week later.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} Hamas claimed responsibility for both attacks which were the first suicide bombings in Israel.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} The attacks may have been timed to disrupt negotiations between Israel and PLO on the implementation of the [[Oslo I Accord]].{{sfn|Stork|Kane|2002|p=66}}

A [[Dizengoff Street bus bombing|bomb on a bus]] in downtown [[Tel Aviv]] in October, killing 22 and injuring 45, was Hamas first successful attack in the city.{{sfn|Rubin|2009|p=133}}

In late December 1995, Hamas promised the [[Palestinian Authority]] (PA) to cease military operations. But it was not to be as [[Shin Bet]] assassinated Ayyash, the 29-year-old leader of the al-Qassam Brigades on January 5, 1996 using a booby-trapped cellphone given to Ayyash by his uncle who worked as an informer.{{sfn|Martin|2011|p=81}} Nearly 100,000 Gazans, about 11% of the total population, marched in his funeral.{{sfn|Martin|2011|p=81}} Hamas resumed its campaign of suicide bombings which had been dormant for a good part of 1995 to retaliate the assassination.{{sfn|Kimmerling|2009|pp=372-373}}

In September 1997, Israel's Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] ordered the assassination of Hamas leader [[Khaled Mashal]] who lived in Jordan.{{sfn|Johnson|2007|p=65}} Two Mossad agents entered Jordan on false Canadian passports and sprayed Mashal with a nerve agent on a street in Amman.{{sfn|Johnson|2007|p=65}} They were caught however and King Hussein threatened to put the agents on trial unless Israel provided Mashal with an antidote and released Yassin.{{sfn|Johnson|2007|p=65}} Israel obliged and the antidote saved Mashal's life.{{sfn|Johnson|2007|p=65}} Yassin was returned to Gaza where he was given a hero's welcome with banners calling him the "sheikh of the Intifada". Yassin's release temporarily boosted Hamas' popularity and at a press conference Yassin declared: "There will be no halt to armed operations until the end of the occupation ... we are peace-seekers. We love peace. And we call on them [the Israelis] to maintain peace with us and to help us in order to restore our rights by peace."{{sfn|Milton-Edwards|Farrell|2013|p=98}}

Although the suicide attacks by the al-Qassam Brigades and other groups violated the 1993 [[Oslo accords]] (which Hamas opposed{{sfn|Goerzig|2010|p=57}}), Arafat was reluctant to pursue the attackers and may have had inadequate means to do so.{{sfn|Kimmerling|2009|pp=372-373}}

==== Impact of the Hebron massacre ====

The Hebron massacre had a profound effect on Hamas' militancy. For its first seven years, it attacked only what it saw as "legitimate military targets," Israeli soldiers and military installations.{{sfn|Najib|Friedrich|2007|p=106}} But following the massacre, it felt that it no longer had to distinguish between military and civilian targets. The leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in the West Bank, Sheikh Ahmed Haj Ali, later argued that "had there not been the 1994 Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, there would have been no suicide bombings." Al-Rantisi in an interview in 1998 stated that the suicide attacks "began after the massacre committed by the terrorist Baruch Goldstein and intensified after the assassination of Yahya Ayyash."{{sfn|Caridi|2012|p=282}} Musa Abu Marzouk put the blame for the escalation on the Israelis: "We were against targeting civilians ... After the Hebron massacre we determined that it was time to kill Israel's civilians ... we offered to stop if Israel would, but they rejected that offer."{{sfn|Milton-Edwards|Farrell|2013|p=93}}

According to Matti Steinberg, former advisor to Shin Bet and one of Israel's leading experts on Hamas, the massacre laid to rest an internal debate within Hamas on the usefulness of indiscriminate violence: "In the Hamas writings there is an explicit prohibition against indiscriminate harm to helpless people. The massacre at the mosque released them from this taboo and introduced a dimension of measure for measure, based on citations from the Koran."{{sfn|Slater|2020|p=280}}

==== Expulsion from Jordan ====
In 1999 Hamas was banned in [[Jordan]], reportedly in part at the request of the United States, Israel, and the [[Palestinian Authority]].{{sfn|Hirst|1999}} Jordan's King Abdullah feared the activities of Hamas and its Jordanian allies would jeopardize peace negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, and accused Hamas of engaging in illegitimate activities within Jordan.{{sfn|Maddy-Weitzman|2002|pp=352-353}} In mid-September 1999, authorities arrested Hamas leaders Khaled Mashal and Ibrahim Ghosheh on their return from a visit to Iran, and charged them with being members of an illegal organization, storing weapons, conducting military exercises, and using Jordan as a training base.{{sfn|Maddy-Weitzman|2002|pp=352-353}}{{sfn|Levitt|2006|p=45}} The Hamas leaders denied the charges.{{sfn|Maddy-Weitzman|2002|p=353}} Mashal was exiled and eventually settled in Damascus in Syria in 2001.{{sfn|Tucker|2019|p=808}} As a result of the [[Syrian civil war]] he distanced himself from Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2012 and moved to Qatar.{{sfn|Tucker|2019|p=808}}

==== Popular support ====
While the Palestinians were used to the idea that their young was willing to die for the struggle, the idea that they would strap explosives to their bodies and blow themselves up was a new and not well-supported development.{{sfn|Milton-Edwards|Farrell|2013|p=93}} A poll taken in 1996 after the wave of suicide bombings Hamas carried out to retaliate Israel's assassination of Ayyash showed that most 70% opposed the tactic and 59% called for Arafat to take action to prevent further attacks.{{sfn|Cragin|2006|p=1998}}

In the political arena Hamas continued to trail far behind its rival Fatah; 41% trusted Arafat in 1996 but only 3.2% trusted Yasssin.{{sfn|Milton-Edwards|Farrell|2013|p=96}}

===Second Intifada===
{{main|Second Intifada}}
In contrast to the preceding uprising, the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada|Al-Aqsa or Second Intifada]] began violently, with mass demonstrations and lethal Israeli counter-insurgency tactics. Prior to the incidents surrounding [[Ariel Sharon]]'s visit to the [[Temple Mount]], Palestinian support for violence against Israelis and for Hamas had been gauged to be 51.6% and 10.3%, respectively. By July of the following year, after almost a year of savage conflict, polling indicated that 85.9% of Palestinians endorsed violence against Israelis and support for Hamas had risen to 16.7%.{{sfn|Davis|2016|p=105}}

The al-Qassam Brigades were among the many militant groups that launched both military-style attacks and suicide bombings against Israeli civilian and military targets in this period. In the ensuing years almost 5000 Palestinians and over 1100 Israelis were killed.{{sfn|Fouberg|Murphy|2020|p=215}} While there was a large number of Palestinian attacks against Israelis, the Palestinians' most effective form of violence were suicide attacks; in the first five years of the intifada a little more than half of all Israeli deaths were victims of suicide attacks. Hamas was responsible for about 40% of the 135 suicide attacks in the period.{{sfn| Benmelech|Berrebi|2007|pp=223–238}}

Whatever the immediate circumstances triggering the uprising, a more general cause, writes U.S. political science professor Jeremy Pressman, was "popular Palestinian discontent [that] grew during the Oslo peace process because the reality on the ground did not match the expectations created by the peace agreements".{{sfn|Pressman|2006|p=114}} Hamas would be the beneficiary of this growing discontent in the 2006 Palestinian Authority legislative elections.

According to Tristan Dunning, Israel has never responded to repeated offers by Hamas over subsequent years for a ''quid pro quo'' moratorium on attacks against civilians'.{{sfn|Dunning|2016|p=61}} It has engaged in several ''tadi'a'' (periods of calm), and proposed a number of ceasefires.{{sfn|Dunning|2016|p=61}} In January 2004, Hamas leader [[Ahmed Yassin]], prior to his assassination, said that the group would end armed resistance against Israel for a 10-year ''[[hudna]]''.{{efn|Hamas' former spokesman and Deputy Foreign Minister in Gaza, Ahmed Yousef, explained in a New York Times op-ed what this meant juridically. (A ''hudna'') 'typically cover(s) 10 years and (is) recognized in Islamic jurisprudence as a legitimate and binding contract. A ''hudna'' extends beyond the Western concept of a ceasefire and obliges parties to use the period to seek a permanent, non-violent resolution to their differences'.{{sfn|Dunning|2016|p=179}}}} in exchange for a Palestinian state in the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip]], and [[East Jerusalem]], and that restoring Palestinians' "historical rights" (relating to the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]]) "would be left for future generations". His views were quickly echoed by senior Hamas official [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi]], who added that Hamas envisaged a "phased liberation".{{sfn|Amayreh|2004}} Israel's response was to assassinate Yassin in March in a [[targeted Israeli air strike]], and then al-Rantisi in a similar air strike in April.{{sfn|Kimmerling|2010|p=268}}

===2006 presidential and legislative elections===

[[File:03-03-2020 Ismail Haniyeh.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ismail Haniyeh]] became the prime minister of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] in 2006.]]
Hamas boycotted the [[1996 Palestinian general election]] and the [[2005 Palestinian presidential election]], but decided to participate in the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election]], the first to take place after the death of [[Yassir Arafat]]. The [[EU]] figured prominently in the proposal that democratic elections be held in the territories.{{sfn|Bouris|2014|p=54}} In the run-up to the polling day, the [[2004 United States presidential election|US administration]]'s [[Condoleezza Rice]], Israel's [[Tzipi Livni]] and British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] all expressed reservations about allowing Hamas to compete in a democratic process.{{sfn|Zweiri|2006|p=680}} Hamas ran on a platform of clean government, a thorough overhaul of the corrupt administrative system, and the issue of rampant lawlessness.{{sfn|Dunning|2016|p=115}}{{sfn|Zweiri|2006|p=677}} The PA, notoriously riddled with corruption, chose to run [[Marwan Barghouti]] as its leading candidate, who was serving five life sentences in Israel. The US donated two million dollars to the [[Palestinian National Authority|PA]] to improve its media image. Israel also assisted the PA by allowing Barghouti to be interviewed in prison by Arab television and by permitting 100,000 Palestinians in [[East Jerusalem]] to vote.{{sfn|Zweiri|2006|p=677}}

Crucially, the election took place shortly after Israel had [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|evacuated its settlements in Gaza]].{{sfn|Zweiri|2006|p=675}} The evacuation, executed without consulting [[Fatah]], gave currency to Hamas' view that resistance had compelled Israel to leave Gaza.{{sfn|Zweiri|2006|p=679}} In a statement Hamas portrayed it as a vindication of their strategy of armed resistance ("Four years of resistance surpassed 10 years of bargaining") and Muhammed Deif attributed "the Liberation of Gaza" to his comrades "love of martyrdom".{{sfn|Brym|Araj|2006|p=1980}}

Hamas, intent on displaying its power through a [[plebiscite]] rather than by violence, announcing that it would refrain from attacks on Israel if Israel were to desist from its offensive against Palestinian towns and villages.{{sfn|Zweiri|2006|pp=676-677}} Its election manifesto dropped the Islamic agenda, spoke of sovereignty for the [[Palestinian territories]], including Jerusalem (an implicit endorsement of the [[two-state solution]]), while conceding nothing about its claims to all of Palestine. It mentioned "armed resistance" twice and affirmed in article 3.6 that it was a right to resist the "terrorism of occupation".{{sfn|Dunning|2016|p=115}} A [[Palestinian Christian]] figured on its candidate list.{{sfn|Zweiri|2006|p=686, n.21}}

Hamas won 76 seats, excluding four won by independents supporting Hamas, and Fatah only 43.{{sfn|Zweiri|2006|p=675}} The election was judged by international observers to have been "competitive and genuinely democratic". The EU said that they had been run better than elections in some members countries of the union, and promised to maintain its financial support.{{sfn|Bouris|2014|p=54}} [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Qatar]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] urged the US to give Hamas a chance, and that it was inadvisable to punish Palestinians for their choice, a position also endorsed by the [[Arab League]] a month later.{{sfn|Zweiri|2006|p=682}} The EU's promise was short-lived; three months later, in violating of its core principles regarding free elections, it abruptly froze financial assistance to the Hamas-led government, following the example set by the US and Canada. It undertook to instead channel funds directly to people and projects, and pay salaries only to Fatah members, employed or otherwise.{{sfn|Bouris|2014|p=55}}

Hamas assumed the administration of Gaza following its electoral victory and introduced radical changes. It inherited a chaotic situation of lawlessness, since the economic sanctions imposed by Israel, the US and the Quartet had crippled the PA's administrative resources, leading to the emergence of numerous mafia-style gangs and [[Al-Qaeda|terror cells modeled after Al Qaeda]].{{sfn|Tocci|2013|p=42}} Writing in [[Foreign Affairs]], [[Daniel Byman]] later stated:
<blockquote>After it took over the Gaza Strip Hamas revamped the police and security forces, cutting them 50,000 members (on paper, at least) under Fatah to smaller, efficient forces of just over 10,000, which then cracked down on crime and gangs. No longer did groups openly carry weapons or steal with impunity. People paid their taxes and electric bills, and in return authorities picked up garbage and put criminals in jail. Gaza-neglected under Egyptian and then Israeli control, and misgoverned by Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and his successors-finally has a real government.'{{sfn|Byman|2010|p=52}}{{efn|"Aside from Hamas' stated goal to 'serve the people', this desire for security reform, again, perhaps is unsurprising given that Hamas was frequently the target of these apparatuses as an opposition movement. Hamas' security apparatus in the Gaza Strip is presently politicized as well, but it has managed to institute the rule of law and order which had eluded the previous Fatah-led forces, despite the Hamas government employing only a fraction of the resources and personnel. Indeed, Hamas streamlined the security forces, reducing the number of personnel from 56,887 prior to its armed seizure of the Gaza Strip in June 2007 to around 15,000 today. In contrast to its West Bank counterparts, moreover, the Hamas security sector is unambiguously under civilian control in line with Western modes of governance, and is thus, according to Sayigh, more accountable."{{sfn|Dunning|2016|p=117}}}}</blockquote>

<!--What is this? What body published it? ;Electoral Platform for Change and Reform
The Change and Reform List adopts a set of principles stemming from the Islamic tradition that we embrace. We see these principles as agreed upon not only by our Palestinian people, but also by our Arab and Islamic nation as a whole. These principles are:{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

# True Islam with its civilized achievements and political, economic, social, and legal aspects is our frame of reference and our way of life.
# Historic Palestine is part of the Arab and Islamic land and its ownership by the Palestinian people is a right that does not diminish over time. No military or legal measures will change that right.
# The Palestinian people, wherever they reside, constitute a single and united people and form an integral part of the Arab and Muslim nation ... [Quranic verse]. Our Palestinian people are still living a phase of national liberation, and thus they have the right to strive to recover their own rights and end the occupation using all means, including armed struggle. We have to make all our resources available to support our people and defeat the occupation and establish a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
# The right of return of all Palestinian refugees and displaced persons to their land and properties, and the right to self-determination and all other national rights, are inalienable and cannot be bargained away for any [[concession (politics)|political concessions]].
# We uphold the indigenous and inalienable rights of our people to our land, Jerusalem, our holy places, our water resources, borders, and a fully sovereign independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
# Reinforcing and protecting Palestinian national unity is one of the priorities of the Palestinian national action.
# The issue of the prisoners is at the top of the Palestinian agenda.<ref name="palestine-studies2006">{{cite journal|url=http://www.palestine-studies.org/journals.aspx?id=7087&jid=1&href=fulltext|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918090220/http://palestine-studies.org/journals.aspx?id=7087&jid=1&href=fulltext|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-09-18|title=A 'New Hamas' through Its New Documents|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|date=Summer 2006|volume=35|issue=4|accessdate=May 30, 2011|doi=10.1525/jps.2006.35.4.6}}</ref>-->

===Hamas–Fatah conflict===
{{Main|Fatah–Hamas conflict|Battle of Gaza (2007)}}
[[File:Bethlehem-hamasrally.JPG|thumb|Hamas rally in [[Bethlehem]]]]After the formation of the Hamas-led cabinet on March 20, 2006, tensions between Fatah and Hamas militants progressively rose in the Gaza strip as Fatah commanders refused to take orders from the government while the Palestinian Authority initiated a campaign of demonstrations, assassinations and abductions against Hamas, which led to Hamas responding.{{sfn|Rose|2008}} Israeli intelligence warned Mahmoud Abbas that Hamas had planned to kill him at his office in Gaza. According to a Palestinian source close to Abbas, Hamas considers president Abbas to be a barrier to its complete control over the Palestinian Authority and decided to kill him.

On July 8, 2014 Israel launched [[Operation Protective Edge]] to counter increased Hamas rocket fire from Gaza. The conflict ended with a permanent cease-fire after 7 weeks, and more than 2,200 dead. 64 of the dead were Israeli soldiers, 7 were civilians in Israel (from rocket attacks), and 2,101 were killed in Gaza, of which according to [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|UN OCHA]] at least 1,460 were civilians. Israel says 1,000 of the dead were militants. Following the conflict, [[Mahmoud Abbas]] president of the Palestinian Authority, accused Hamas of needlessly extending the fighting in the Gaza Strip, contributing to the high death toll, of running a "shadow government" in Gaza, and of illegally executing scores of Palestinians.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/world/middleeast/gaza-strip-palestinian-leader-assails-hamas-calling-unity-pact-into-question.html?_r=0 Palestinian Leader Assails Hamas, Calling Unity Pact Into Question].

In May 2017, Hamas unveiled its new charter, in an attempt to moderate its image. The charter no longer calls for Israel's destruction, but still calls for liberation of Palestine and to 'confront the Zionist project'. It also confirms acceptance of the 1967 borders as the basis for establishing a Palestinian state as well as not being an offshoot of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hamas-charter-1637794876|title=Hamas in 2017: The document in full|website=MiddleEastEye.net|access-date=January 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/whats-behind-hamas-new-charter|title=What's behind Hamas' new charter?|first=Ali|last=Abunimah|date=May 2, 2017|website=ElectronicIntifada.net|access-date=January 6, 2018}}</ref>

In October 2017, Fatah and Hamas signed yet another reconciliation agreement. The partial agreement addresses civil and administrative matters involving Gaza and the West Bank. Other contentious issues such as national elections, reform of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and possible demilitarization of Hamas were to be discussed in the next meeting in November 2017, due to a new step-by-step approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/10/hamas-fatah-reconciliation-deal-succeed-171013064803703.html|title=Will Hamas-Fatah reconciliation deal succeed?|first=Jonathan|last=Cook|website=www.AlJazeera.com|access-date=January 6, 2018}}</ref>

''Al-Fateh'' ("the conqueror") is the Hamas children's magazine, published biweekly in London, and also posted in an online website. It began publication in September 2002, and its 108th issue was released in mid-September 2007. The magazine features stories, poems, riddles, and puzzles, and states it is for "the young builders of the future".<ref name="OnlineTerrorists">{{cite web |url=http://globalpolitician.com/24252-terror |title=Online Terrorists Prey on the Vulnerable |publisher=Globalpolitician.com |access-date=August 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720001052/http://globalpolitician.com/24252-terror |archivedate=July 20, 2011}}</ref>

According to [[MEMRI]] (three of whose seven founding staff had formerly served in the IDF), the magazine includes incitement to jihad and martyrdom and glorification of terrorist operations and of their planners and perpetrators. as well as characterizations of Jews as "murderers of the prophets" and laudatory descriptions of parents who encourage their sons to kill Jews. In each issue, a regular feature titled "The Story of a Martyr" presents the "heroic deeds" of a [[mujahid]] from one of the organizations who died in a suicide operation, including operations against civilians, or who was killed by the IDF. MEMRI also noted that the magazine includes illustrations of figures, including child warriors, who embody the ethos of jihad and martyrdom, presenting them as role models. These include the magazine's titular character, Al-Fateh ("The Conqueror")&nbsp;– a small boy on a horse brandishing a drawn scimitar&nbsp;– as well as children carrying guns, and photos of Hamas fighters launching Qassam rockets.<ref name="memri.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&Area=ia&ID=IA39307 |title=Hamas Children's Magazine Al-Fateh Encourages Terrorism, Glorifies Martyrdom |publisher=Memri.org |access-date=August 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805080903/http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&Area=ia&ID=IA39307 |archivedate=August 5, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/main_Terrorism/al_fateh_hamas.htm |title=Hamas Magazine for Kids Promotes Martyrdom and Hatred |publisher=Adl.org |access-date=August 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804222805/http://www.adl.org/main_Terrorism/al_fateh_hamas.htm |archivedate=August 4, 2011}}</ref>

==Hamas Charter (1988)==
{{main|Hamas Covenant}}
The foundational document of Hamas, the [[Hamas Charter]] (''mīthāq ḥarakat''), was, according to [[Khaled Hroub]] written by a single individual and made public without going through the usual prior consultation process. {{efn|'The Charter was written in early 1988 by one individual and was made public without appropriate general Hamas consultation, revision or consensus, to the regret of Hamas's leaders in later years. The author of the Charter was one of the 'old guard' of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Gaza Strip, completely cut off from the outside world. All kinds of confusions and conflations between Judaism and Zionism found their way into the Charter, to the disservice of Hamas ever since, as this document has managed to brand it with charges of 'anti-Semitism' and a naïve world-view' Hamas leaders and spokespeople have rarely referred to the Charter or quoted from it, evidence that it has come to be seen as a burden rather than an intellectual platform that embraces the movement's principles.'{{sfn|Hroub|2006|p=33}}}} It was then signed on August 18, 1988.

[[Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook|Mousa Marzook]] said in 2007 that the charter could not be altered because it would look like a compromise not acceptable to the 'street' and risk fracturing the party's unity. Hamas leader [[Khaled Meshaal]] has stated that the Charter is "a piece of history and no longer relevant, but cannot be changed for internal reasons". [[Ahmed Yousef]], senior adviser to [[Ismail Haniyeh]], added in 2011 that it reflected the views of the Elders in the face of a 'relentless occupation.'

In March 2006, Hamas released its official legislative program. The document clearly signaled that Hamas could refer the issue of recognizing Israel to a national referendum. Under the heading "Recognition of Israel," it stated simply (AFP, 3/11/06): "The question of recognizing Israel is not the jurisdiction of one faction, nor the government, but a decision for the Palestinian people." This was a major shift away from their 1988 charter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2974|title=Nixed Signals|author=Seth Ackerman|date=September–October 2006|work=Extra!|publisher=[[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]]|access-date=March 18, 2012}}</ref> A few months later, via [[University of Maryland]]'s Jerome Segal, the group sent a letter to U.S. President [[George W.

==Islamization efforts==
===In the Gaza Strip===
{{Main|Islamization of the Gaza Strip}}
The gender ideology outlined in the Hamas charter, the importance of women in the religious-nationalist project of liberation is asserted as no lesser than that of males. Their role was defined primarily as one of manufacturing males and caring for their upbringing and rearing, though the charter recognized they could fight for liberation without obtaining their husband's permission and in 2002 their participation in jihad was permitted.{{sfn|Davis|2017|=55}} The doctrinal emphasis on childbearing and rearing as woman's primary duty is not so different from Fatah's view of women in the First Intifada and it also resembles the outlook of Jewish settlers, and over time it has been subjected to change.{{sfn|Shitrit|2015|pp=73-74}}{{sfn|Phillips|2011|p=81}}

In 1989, during the First Intifada, a small number of Hamas followers {{sfn|Shitrit|2015|p= 74}} campaigned for the wearing of the [[hijab]], which is not a part of traditional women's attire in Palestine,<ref>Gerber p. 27.</ref> for polygamy, and also insisted women stay at home and be segregated from men. In the course of this campaign, women who chose not to wear the hijab were verbally and physically harassed, with the result that the hijab was being worn 'just to avoid problems on the streets'.{{sfn|Rubenberg|2001|pp=230-231}} The harassment dropped drastically when, after 18 months [[Unified National Leadership of the Uprising|UNLU]] condemned it,{{sfn|Gerner|2007|p=27}} though similar campaigns reoccurred.

Since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, some of its members have attempted to impose Islamic dress or the [[hijab]] head covering on women.<ref name="ReferenceB">[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/world/middleeast/06gaza.html Hamas Fights Over Gaza's Islamist Identity] ''The New York Times'', September 5, 2009</ref><ref name="xinhua">{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/03/content_12748559.htm |title=Hamas encourages Gaza women to follow Islamic code _English_Xinhua |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=January 3, 2010 |access-date=August 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514030330/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/03/content_12748559.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2011}}</ref> Also, the government's "Islamic Endowment Ministry" has deployed Virtue Committee members to warn citizens of the dangers of immodest dress, card playing, and dating.<ref name="bloomberg">[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aB2RfynNbLmk Hamas Bans Women Dancers, Scooter Riders in Gaza Push] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118123632/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aB2RfynNbLmk |date=November 18, 2015}} By Daniel Williams, Bloomberg, November 30, 2009</ref> However, there are no government laws imposing dress and other moral standards, and the Hamas education ministry reversed one effort to impose Islamic dress on students.<ref name="ReferenceB" /> There has also been successful resistance to attempts by local Hamas officials to impose Islamic dress on women.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/18/hamas-gaza-islamist-dress-code Hamas patrols beaches in Gaza to enforce conservative dress code] ''The Guardian'' (UK), October 18, 2009</ref>

They also cited examples of leniency by Hamas authorities, such as allowing widowed women to keep custody of their children so long as they did not remarry, and other relaxations in the enforcement of Shariah law. One woman noted that the environment was "not as bad" as during the First Intifada, when women were subject to public criticism and stonings for failure to obey conservative Islamic standards of dress. One woman complained that women were not free to speak their minds or travel alone, and added: "Hamas want to force themselves onto the people. They want the people to submit to them, this is their cover. They destroyed the reputation of Islam, by saying we're doing this because it is religion.

===Tayyip Erdoğan's Turkey as a role model===
Some Hamas members stated that the model of Islamic government that Hamas seeks to emulate is that of Turkey under the rule of [[Tayyip Erdoğan]].

==Antisemitism and anti-Zionism==
{{See also|Racism in the Palestinian territories}}

According to academic Esther Webman, antisemitism is not the main tenet of Hamas ideology, although antisemitic rhetoric is frequent and intense in Hamas leaflets. The leaflets generally do not differentiate between Jews and Zionists. In other Hamas publications and interviews with its leaders, attempts at this differentiation have been made.<ref name=Webman1994>Webman, Esther.

Hamas has made conflicting statements about its readiness to recognize Israel. In 2006 a spokesman signaled readiness to recognize Israel within the 1967 borders.

{{Main|Hamas Covenant}}
* Article 7 of the Hamas Covenant provides the following quotation, attributed to [[Muhammad]]:

<blockquote>The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.

<blockquote>You may speak as much as you want about regional and world wars.

They obtained the Balfour Declaration, formed the League of Nations through which they could rule the world. They were behind World War II, through which they made huge financial gains by trading in armaments, and paved the way for the establishment of their state.

===Statements on the Holocaust===
Hamas has been explicit in its [[Holocaust denial]]. In reaction to the Stockholm conference on [[The Holocaust|the Jewish Holocaust]], held in late January 2000, Hamas issued a press release that it published on its official website, containing the following statements from a senior leader:

<blockquote>This conference bears a clear Zionist goal, aimed at forging history by hiding the truth about the so-called Holocaust, which is an alleged and invented story with no basis. (...) The invention of these grand illusions of an alleged crime that never occurred, ignoring the millions of dead European victims of Nazism during the war, clearly reveals the racist Zionist face, which believes in the superiority of the Jewish race over the rest of the nations. (...) By these methods, the Jews in the world flout scientific methods of research whenever that research contradicts their racist interests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=1946 |title=Palestinian Holocaust Denial |publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy |date=2000-04-21 |access-date=2013-01-06}}</ref></blockquote>

In August 2003, senior Hamas official Dr Abd Al-Aziz Al-Rantisi wrote in the Hamas newspaper ''Al-Risala'' that the Zionists encouraged murder of Jews by the Nazis with the aim of forcing them to immigrate to Palestine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajn.com.au/pages/archives/feature/feature-03a.html|title=Holocaust Denial|publisher=www.ajn.com.au|access-date=September 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207040823/http://www.ajn.com.au/pages/archives/feature/feature-03a.html |archive-date=February 7, 2006}}</ref>

==Violence and terrorism==
{{Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel}}
Hamas has used both political activities and violence in pursuit of its goals.

===Attacks on civilians===
[[File:HAMAS suicide bombing in Jerusalem on 25 February (DoS Publication 10321).png|upright|thumb|Aftermath of 1996 [[Jaffa Road bus bombings]] in which 26 people were killed]]

Hamas has attacked Israeli civilians. Hamas most deadly suicide bombing was an attack on a [[Netanya]] hotel on March 27, 2002, in which 30 people were killed and 140 were wounded. The attack has also been referred to as the [[Netanya suicide attack|Passover massacre]] since it took place on the first night of the Jewish festival of [[Passover]] at a [[Passover Seder|Seder]].

Hamas has defended suicide attacks as a legitimate aspect of its [[asymmetric warfare]] against Israel. In 2003, according to Stephen Atkins, Hamas resumed suicide bombings in Israel as a retaliatory measure after the failure of peace talks and an Israeli campaign targeting members of the upper echelon of the Hamas leadership.{{efn|'This ceasefire ended when Israel started targeting Hamas leaders for assassination in July 2003. Hamas retaliated with a suicide bombing in Israel on August 19, 2003, that killed 20 people, including 6 children.

Hamas suicide attacks on Israeli civilians have largely disappeared since 2005; this has coincided with an increase in rocket attacks. One analysis suggests that the decline in suicide attacks is not motivated by any lack of supplies or volunteers to carry out such operations, by enhanced Israeli security measures such as the [[West Bank barrier]] (if Israeli actions were the reason, one would expect to see an equal decline in suicide attacks by all Palestinian factions, which is not observed), or by a newfound desire for reconciliation with Israel on the part of Hamas. Rather, suicide bombings provoked targeted killings that decimated the leadership of Hamas, whereas rocket attacks have elicited weaker Israeli reprisals that have tended to harm the Palestinian population as a whole more than Hamas (such as the [[blockade of the Gaza Strip]])&nbsp;– thereby paradoxically increasing Hamas's popular support.<ref name="Where?">{{cite web|last=Toronto|first=Nathan W.|url=https://www.ict.org.il/Article.aspx?ID=1031|title=Where Have All the Bombers Gone?|work=[[Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya]]|date=2008-04-20|access-date=2016-09-23}}</ref>

===Rocket attacks on Israel===
Rocket attacks by Hamas have been condemned by Human rights organizations as [[war crime]]s, both because they usually take aim at civilians and because the weapons' inaccuracy would disproportionately endanger civilians even if military targets were chosen. After Operation Pillar of Defense, [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that armed Palestinian groups fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli cities, violating international humanitarian law, and that statements by Palestinian groups that they deliberately targeted Israeli civilians demonstrated an "intent to commit war crimes". HRW's Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson said that Palestinian groups made clear that "harming civilians was their aim" and said that launching rockets at populated areas had no legal justification. International humanitarian law prohibits deliberate attacks on civilians and intentional violations can be war crimes.<ref name="HRWHamas"/>

According to Human Rights Watch, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups have launched thousands of rockets into Israel since 2001, killing 15 civilians, wounding many more, and posing an ongoing threat to the nearly 800,000 Israeli civilians who live and work in the weapons' range. Hamas officials have said that the rockets were aimed only at military targets, saying that civilian casualties were the "accidental result" of the weapons' poor quality. According to Human Rights Watch, statements by Hamas leaders suggest that the purpose of the rocket attacks was indeed to strike civilians and civilian objects. From January 2009, following [[Operation Cast Lead]], Hamas largely stopped launching rocket attacks on Israel and has on at least two occasions arrested members of other groups who have launched rockets, "showing that it has the ability to impose the law when it wants".<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/en/node/89574/section/3 HRW report] April 11, 2010</ref> In February 2010, Hamas issued a statement regretting any harm that may have befallen Israeli civilians as a result of Palestinian rocket attacks during the Gaza war. It maintained that its rocket attacks had been aimed at Israeli military targets but lacked accuracy and hence sometimes hit civilian areas. Israel responded that Hamas had boasted repeatedly of targeting and murdering civilians in the media.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Al-Mughrabi, Nidal|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKLDE6141LC|title=Hamas "regrets" civilian deaths, Israel unmoved|work=[[Reuters]]|date=February 5, 2010}}</ref>

According to one report, commenting on the 2014 conflict, "nearly all the 2,500–3,000 rockets and mortars Hamas has fired at Israel since the start of the war seem to have been aimed at towns", including an attack on "a kibbutz collective farm close to the Gaza border", in which an Israeli child was killed.<ref name="Training Manual">{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Luke|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/24/us-mideast-gaza-hamas-document-idUSKBN0GO0D120140824|title=Israel says it found Hamas training manual in Gaza|work=Reuters|date=August 24, 2014|access-date=August 25, 2014}}</ref> Former Israeli Lt.

===Attempts to derail 2010 peace talks===
{{see also|2010 Palestinian militancy campaign}}

In 2010, Hamas, who have been actively sidelined from the peace talks by Israel, spearheaded a coordinated effort by 13 [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] militant groups, in attempt to derail the stalled [[Direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in 2010|peace talks]] between Israel and [[Mahmoud Abbas]], President of the [[Palestinian Authority]]. According to the Israeli [[Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories]] Major Gen. Eitan Dangot, Israel seeks to work with [[Salam Fayyad]], to help revive the Palestinian economy, and hopes to ease restrictions on the Gaza Strip further, "while somehow preventing the Islamic militants who rule it from getting credit for any progress". According to Dangot, Hamas must not be seen as ruling successfully or be allowed to "get credit for a policy that would improve the lives of people".<ref>{{cite news |title=IDF general lays out plan for reviving Gaza economy |agency=The Associated Press |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/idf-general-lays-out-plan-for-reviving-gaza-economy-1.321256 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=October 26, 2010 |access-date=June 7, 2013}}</ref> The campaign consists of attacks against Israelis in which, according to a Hamas declaration in early September, "all options are open".<ref name=Weiss>{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/0904/1224278203442.html|title=Islamist groups attempt to derail Middle East talks|author=Weiss, Mark|date=September 4, 2010|newspaper=Irish Times}}</ref><ref name=Mitnick>[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0831/Hamas-targets-Israeli-Palestinian-talks-by-killing-four-Israelis "Hamas targets Israeli-Palestinian talks by killing four Israelis; Hamas took responsibility for the fatal shooting of four Israeli settlers outside Hebron today, on the eve of Israeli-Palestinian talks in Washington,"] Joshua Mitnick, August 31, 2010, ''Christian Science Monitor''.</ref><ref name=jerusalempoststaff>{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=186963|title=Hamas to launch 'more effective attacks' on Israel|date=September 3, 2010|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post}}</ref><ref name=excathedraeditorial>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/07/AR2010090705977.html|title=The Shadow of Hamas|date=September 8, 2010|work=The Washington Post|access-date=September 7, 2013}}</ref> The participating groups also include [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]], the [[Popular Resistance Committees]] and an unnamed splinter group of [[Fatah]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6811J620100902 Gaza militants vow wave of attacks against Israel], Reuters September 2, 2010</ref>

===Themes of martyrdom===
{{See also|Martyrdom in Islam}}

According to a translation by Palestinian Media Watch, in 2008, Fathi Hamad, a member of the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]], stated on [[Al-Aqsa TV]], "For the Palestinian people death became an industry, at which women excel and so do all people on this land: the elderly excel, the Jihad fighters excel, and the children excel. Accordingly (Palestinians) created a human shield of women, children, the elderly and the Jihad fighters against the Zionist bombing machine, as if they were saying to the Zionist enemy: 'We desire death as you desire life.'"<ref>[http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=582&doc_id=507 "Hamas explains using civilians as human shields"], ''[[Palestinian Media Watch]]'', (December 28, 2008).</ref>

In 2010, Hamas speaker Ahmad Bahr praised the virtues of martyrdom and Jihad, and said that 2.5&nbsp;million black-eyed virgins were waiting in the [[Garden of Eden]], which could be entered only by prophets, by the righteous, and by martyrs. He continued by saying that nobody on Earth "will be able to confront the resistance, or to confront the mujahideen, those who worship Allah and seek martyrdom".<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Middle East Research Institute |url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4600.htm|title=Hamas PLC Speaker Ahmad Bahr: 2.5 Million Virgins Await the Prophets, the Righteous, and the Martyrs in a Single Palace in the Garden of Eden|date= September 13, 2010|access-date=September 7, 2013}}</ref>

===Guerrilla warfare===

Hamas has used [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] and [[anti-tank rocket]]s against the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] in Gaza. The latter include standard [[RPG-7]] warheads and home-made rockets such as the [[Al-Bana]], Al-[[Batar]] and Al-[[Yasin (RPG)|Yasin]].

==International views of Hamas==
According to Tobias Buck, Hamas is "listed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, but few dare to treat it that way now" and in the Arab and Muslim world it has lost its pariah status and its emissaries are welcomed in capitals of Islamic countries.<ref>{{cite news |last=Buck |first=Tobias |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/80ce6306-348e-11e2-8986-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Cyoz9WeU |title=Five lessons from the Gaza conflict |work=Financial Times|date=November 22, 2012 |access-date=January 6, 2013}}</ref> While Hamas is considered a terrorist group by several governments and some academics, others regard Hamas as a complex organization, with [[terrorism]] as only one component.<ref>Krista Wiegand, [https://books.google.com/books?id=H96cqNJ0fTAC&pg=PA124 ''Bombs and Ballots: Governance by Islamist Terrorist and Guerrilla Groups,''] [[Ashgate Publishing]], Revised edition 2013 p. 124. "Officially, Hamas is considered by American and Israeli policymakers and some academics as the epitome of a terrorist group. [...] Due to the gravity and consequences of Hamas's use of terrorism as a tactic, all other aspects of Hamas, including its extensive social services programs and its role as a political party are overshadowed and often ignored by policy makers.

=== Children as combatants ===
{{See also|Children in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict}}
In the early intifada period, children in Gaza and the West Bank were instilled by Hamas with Islamic and military values. Evidence from 2001 shows that kindergarten children attended ceremonies where they wore emblematic uniforms and bore mock rifles. Some were dressed up as suicide bombers, whose readiness to die for the cause was held up as a model to be imitated. The preschoolers would swear an oath 'to pursue jihad, resistance and intifada.'

Although Hamas admits to sponsoring summer schools to train teenagers in handling weapons they condemn attacks by children.

On August 2, 2012, the [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) accused Hamas of harassing elected officials belong to the Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate (PJS) in Gaza. The IFJ said that journalists' leaders in Gaza have faced a campaign of intimidation, as well as threats designed to force them to stop their union work. Some of these journalists are now facing charges of illegal activities and a travel ban, due to their refusal "to give in to pressure". The IFJ said that these accusations are "malicious" and "should be dropped immediately". The IFJ explained that the campaign against PJS members began in March 2012, after their election, and included a raid organized by Hamas supporters who took over the PJS offices in Gaza with the help of the security forces, and subsequently evicted the staff and elected officials. Other harassment includes the targeting of individuals who were bullied into stopping union work. The IFJ backed the PJS and called on Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh to intervene to stop "his officials' unwarranted interference in journalists' affairs".<ref name="IFJ August">{{cite web | url=http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/ifj-condemns-hamas-meddling-in-gaza-journalists-affairs | title=IFJ Condemns Hamas Meddling in Gaza Journalists' Affairs | publisher=International Federation of Journalists | date=August 2, 2012 | access-date=August 8, 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815125329/http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/ifj-condemns-hamas-meddling-in-gaza-journalists-affairs | archivedate=August 15, 2012 | df=mdy-all}}</ref> In November 2012, two Gazan journalists were prevented from leaving Gaza by Hamas.

=== Human rights abuses ===
In June 2011, the Independent Commission for Human Rights based in [[Ramallah]] published a report whose findings included that the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were subjected in 2010 to an "almost systematic campaign" of human rights abuses by the [[Palestinian Authority]] and Hamas, as well as by Israeli authorities, with the security forces belonging to the PA and Hamas being responsible for torture, arrests and arbitrary detentions.<ref>{{cite news |last=Liel |first=Alon |url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=224143 |title=PA bans journalists from reporting human rights abuses |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |access-date=August 1, 2011}}</ref>

In 2012, the [[Human Rights Watch]] presented a 43-page long list of human rights violations committed by Hamas. Among actions attributed to Hamas, the HRW report mentions beatings with metal clubs and rubber hoses, hanging of alleged collaborationists with Israel, and torture of 102 individuals. According to the report, Hamas also tortured civil society activists and peaceful protesters. Reflecting on the captivity of [[Gilad Shalit]], the HRW report described it as "cruel and inhuman". The report also slams Hamas for harassment of people based on so-called morality offenses and for media censorship.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4288204,00.html |title=Rights group: Hamas abusing Palestinians in Gaza|publisher=Ynetnews.com |access-date=January 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-israeloccupied-palestinian-territories |title=World Report 2012: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=January 22, 2012 |access-date=January 6, 2013}}</ref> In a public statement [[Joe Stork]], the deputy Middle East director of HRW claimed, "after five years of Hamas rule in Gaza, its criminal justice system reeks of injustice, routinely violates detainees' rights and grants impunity to abusive security services."

On May 26, 2015, Amnesty International released a report saying that Hamas carried out extrajudicial killings, abductions and arrests of Palestinians and used the Al-Shifa Hospital to detain, interrogate and torture suspects during the Israel–Gaza conflict in 2014. It details the executions of at least 23 Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel and torture of dozens of others, many victims of torture were members of the rival Palestinian movement, Fatah.<ref>{{cite web|title=Palestine (State of): 'Strangling Necks' Abductions, torture and summary killings of Palestinians by Hamas forces during the 2014 Gaza/Israel conflict|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/mde2116432015eng.pdf|website=amnesty.org|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|access-date=May 27, 2015|location=United Kingdom|date=May 26, 2015}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Gaza Palestinians tortured, summarily killed by Hamas forces during 2014 conflict|url=https://www.amnesty.org/press-releases/2015/05/gaza-palestinians-tortured-summarily-killed-by-hamas-forces-during-2014-conflict/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150527024539/https://www.amnesty.org/press-releases/2015/05/gaza-palestinians-tortured-summarily-killed-by-hamas-forces-during-2014-conflict/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 27, 2015|access-date=May 27, 2015|work=[[Amnesty International]]|date=May 27, 2015}}</ref>

In 2019, Osama Qawassmeh, a [[Fatah]] spokesman in the West Bank, accused Hamas of “kidnapping and brutally torturing Fatah members in a way that no Palestinian can imagine.” Qawassmeh accused Hamas of kidnapping and torturing 100 Fatah members in Gaza. The torture allegedly included the practice called "shabah" – the painful binding of the hands and feet to a chair. Also in 2019, Fatah activist from Gaza Raed Abu al-Hassin was beaten and had his two legs broken by Hamas security officers. Al-Hassin was taken into custody by Hamas after he participated in a pro-Abbas demonstration in the Gaza Strip.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Fatah-Hamas-brutally-torturing-our-men-in-Gaza-582225|title=Fatah: Hamas brutally torturing our men in Gaza – Middle East – Jerusalem Post|website=www.jpost.com|access-date=2019-07-05}}</ref>

== International support ==
Hamas has always maintained leadership abroad. The movement is deliberately fragmented to ensure that Israel cannot kill its top political and military leaders.<ref name="theatlantic.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/06/how-hamas-lost-the-arab-spring/277102/|title=How Hamas Lost the Arab Spring|first=Jonathan|last=Schanzer|publisher=}}</ref> Hamas used to be strongly allied with both Iran and Syria. Iran gave Hamas an estimated $13–15&nbsp;million in 2011 as well as access to long-range missiles. Hamas's political bureau was once located in the Syrian capital of Damascus before the start of the Syrian civil war. Relations between Hamas, Iran, and Syria began to turn cold when Hamas refused to back the government of Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]]. Instead, Hamas backed the Sunni rebels fighting against Assad. As a result, Iran cut funding to Hamas, and Iranian ally Hezbollah ordered Hamas members out of Lebanon.<ref name="time.com">{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3033681/hamas-gaza-palestine-israel-egypt/|title=Hamas Still Has Some Friends Left|publisher=}}</ref> Hamas was then forced out of Syria.

From 2012 to 2013, under the leadership of [[Muslim Brotherhood]] President [[Mohamed Morsi]], Hamas had the support of Egypt. However, when Morsi was removed from office, his replacement [[Abdul Fattah al-Sisi]] outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood and destroyed the tunnels Hamas built into Egypt. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are likewise hostile to Hamas. Like Egypt, they designated the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization and Hamas was viewed as its Palestinian equivalent.<ref name="time.com"/>

=== Qatar and Turkey ===
According to Middle East experts, now Hamas has two firm allies: [[Qatar]] and [[Turkey]]. Both give Hamas public and financial assistance estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Shashank Joshi, senior research fellow at the [[Royal United Services Institute]], says that "Qatar also hosts Hamas's political bureau which includes Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal." Meshaal also visits Turkey frequently to meet with Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].<ref name="time.com"/> Erdogan has dedicated himself to breaking Hamas out of its political and economic seclusion. On U.S. television, Erdogan said in 2012 that "I don't see Hamas as a terror organization. Hamas is a political party."<ref name="theatlantic.com"/>

In 2007, Qatar was, with Turkey, the only country to back Hamas after the group ousted the Palestinian Authority from the Gaza Strip.<ref name="time.com"/> The relationship between Hamas and Qatar strengthened in 2008 and 2009 when Khaled Meshaal was invited to attend the Doha Summit where he was seated next to the then Qatari Emir [[Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani]], who pledged $250&nbsp;million to repair the damage caused by Israel in the Israeli war on Gaza.<ref name="al-monitor.com"/> These events caused Qatar to become the main player in the "Palestinian issue". Qatar called Gaza's blockade unjust and immoral, which prompted the Hamas government in Gaza, including former Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, to thank Qatar for their "unconditional" support. Qatar then began regularly handing out political, material, humanitarian and charitable support for Hamas.<ref name="al-monitor.com"/>

In 2012, Qatar's former Emir, Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, became the first head of state to visit Gaza under Hamas rule. He pledged to raise $400&nbsp;million for reconstruction. Some have argued that the money Qatar gives to reconstruct Palestine is an excuse to pour even more money into Hamas.<ref name="stopterrorfinance.org"/> Qatar's reason for funding Hamas, which is shared by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is alleged that Islamist groups are growing and will eventually play a role in the region; thus it is important for Qatar (and Turkey) to maintain ties. During the Arab Spring, for example, Qatar backed the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Islamist group whose offshoot is Hamas.<ref name="jta.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2014/09/14/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/why-does-qatar-support-hamas|title=Why does Qatar support Hamas?|date=September 14, 2014|publisher=}}</ref> Other sources say that advocating for Hamas is politically beneficial to Turkey and Qatar because the Palestinian cause draws popular support amongst their citizens at home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/06/world/meast/mideast-hamas-support/index.html|title=Which Mideast power brokers support Hamas? |first=Josh |last=Levs|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

Some began to label Qatar a terrorist haven in part because it is harboring Hamas leader Meshaal.<ref name="jta.org"/> They also harbor Husam Badran, former leader of Hamas's military wing in the northern West Bank.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} [[Husam Badran]], current media spokesman for Hamas, was the instigator of several of the deadliest suicide bombings of the [[Second Intifada|second intifada]], including the [[Dolphinarium discotheque massacre|Dolphinarium discotheque bombing]] in Tel Aviv, which killed 21 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2011/10/18/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/murderers-row-who-are-the-terrorists-being-freed-in-the-shalit-deal|title=Murderers' Row: Who are the terrorists being freed in the Shalit deal?|date=October 18, 2011|publisher=}}</ref> Turkey has also been criticized for housing terrorists including [[Saleh al-Arouri]], the senior Hamas official, known for his ability to mastermind attacks from abroad.

Speaking in reference to Qatar's support for Hamas, during a 2015 visit to Palestine, Qatari official Mohammad al-Emadi, said Qatar is using the money not to help Hamas but rather the Palestinian people as a whole. He acknowledges however that giving to the Palestinian people means using Hamas as the local contact. Emadi said, "You have to support them. You don't like them, don't like them. But they control the country, you know."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/06/18/414693807/why-israel-lets-qatar-give-millions-to-hamas|title=Why Israel Lets Qatar Give Millions To Hamas|publisher=}}</ref> Some argue that Hamas's relations with Qatar are putting Hamas in an awkward position because Qatar has become part of the regional Arab problem. However, Hamas claims that having contacts with various Arab countries establishes positive relations which will encourage Arab countries to do their duty toward the Palestinians and support their cause by influencing public opinion in the Arab world.<ref name="al-monitor.com"/> In March 2015, Hamas has announced its support of the [[Saudi Arabia]]n-led [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|military intervention in Yemen]] against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Houthis]] and forces loyal to former President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]].<ref>[http://www.arabnews.com/saudi-arabia/news/725241 Hamas supports military operation for political legitimacy in Yemen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807021350/http://www.arabnews.com/saudi-arabia/news/725241 |date=August 7, 2016}}.

In May 2018, [[Turkish president]] Recep Tayyip Erdoğan [[tweeted]] to the [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] that Hamas is not a terrorist organization but a resistance movement that defends the Palestinian homeland against an occupying power.

In 2014, Chinese Foreign Minister [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi]] called on Israel to lift its blockade and advised both Israel and Hamas to cease fighting.

Prior to 2006, Hamas was well regarded by Palestinians for its efficiency and perceived lack of corruption compared to Fatah.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Rising Popularity Poses a Dilemma for Hamas|work=Time|date=January 23, 2006|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1151969,00.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hamas leader: You can't get rid of us|work=Haaretz|date=April 14, 2005|author=Danny Rubinstein|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/hamas-leader-you-can-t-get-rid-of-us-1.155935}}</ref> Public opinions of Hamas have deteriorated after it took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007. Prior to the takeover, 62% of Palestinians had held a favorable view of the group, while a third had negative views. According to a 2014 Pew Research just prior to the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], only about a third had positive opinions and more than half viewed Hamas negatively. Furthermore, 68% of Israeli Arabs viewed Hamas negatively.<ref name="pew2014">[http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/ Concerns about Islamic Extremism on the Rise in Middle East].

Hamas popularity surged after the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|war in 2014]] with polls reporting that 81 percent of Palestinians felt that Hamas had "won" that war.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hamas popularity 'surges after Gaza war'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/09/hamas-popularity-surges-after-gaza-war-20149215723979443.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|date=2 Sep 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Poll: Hamas popularity surges after war with Israel|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/09/02/poll-hamas-popularity-surges-after-war-with-israel/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 2, 2014}}</ref>

===In the United States===
The [[charitable trust]] [[Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development]] was accused in December 2001 of funding Hamas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/po837.htm |title=PO-837: Secretary O'Neill – Statement on the Blocking of Hamas Financiers' Assets |publisher=Ustreas.gov |date=December 4, 2001 |access-date=May 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829234312/http://ustreas.gov/press/releases/po837.htm |archivedate=29 August 2009}}</ref><ref>Bush Freezes Financial Assets of Three Groups Linked to Hamas", White House News Conference, December 4, 2001.

The case first ended in a [[Mistrials|mistrial]], in which jurors acquitted on some counts and were deadlocked on charges ranging from tax violations to [[providing material support for terrorists]]. In a retrial, on November 24, 2008, the five leaders of the Foundation were convicted on 108 counts.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/us/25charity.html| title=Five Convicted in Terrorism Financing Trial| access-date=December 29, 2008| author=Kovach, Gretel C.| date=November 24, 2008| newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>

Several U.S. organizations were either shut down or held liable for financing Hamas in early 2001, groups that have origins from the mid-1990s, among them the [[Holy Land Foundation]] (HLF), [[Islamic Association for Palestine]] (IAP), and Kind Hearts. The U.S. Treasury Department specially designated the HLF in 2001 for terror ties because from 1995 to 2001 the HLF transferred "approximately $12.4 million outside of the United States with the intent to contribute funds, goods, and services to Hamas." According to the Treasury Department, Khaled Meshal identified one of HLF's officers, Mohammed El-Mezain as "the Hamas leader for the U.S." In 2003, IAP was found liable for financially supporting Hamas, and in 2006, Kind Hearts had their assets frozen for supporting Hamas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetower.org/3260oc-former-treasury-official-same-network-that-funded-hamas-in-u-s-backs-boycotts-of-israel/|title=Former Treasury Official: Same Network That Funded Hamas in U.S. Backs Boycotts of Israel|publisher=}}</ref>
