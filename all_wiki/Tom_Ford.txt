== Fashion career ==
=== Early career ===
When interviewing for jobs after graduation, Ford said that he had attended [[The New School]]'s Parsons division, but concealed that he graduated in architecture,<ref name=gale /> and that his work at Chloé was a low-level public relations position. Despite his lack of experience in fashion, Ford called American designer Cathy Hardwick every day for a month in hopes of securing a job at her sportswear company. Hardwick eventually agreed to interview him. She later recalled the incident: "I had every intention of giving him no hope. I asked him who his favorite European designers were. He said, '[[Armani]] and [[Chanel]].' Months later I asked him why he said that, and he said, 'Because you were wearing something Armani.' Is it any wonder he got the job?" Ford worked as a design assistant for Hardwick for two years.<ref name=gale />

In 1988, Ford moved to [[Perry Ellis (brand)|Perry Ellis]],<ref name=gale /> where he knew both Robert McDonald, the company's president, and [[Marc Jacobs]], its designer, socially. He worked at the company for two years, but grew tired of working in American fashion. In a later interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', he commented, "If I was ever going to become a good designer, I had to leave America. My own culture was inhibiting me. Too much style in America is tacky. It's looked down upon to be too stylish. Europeans, however, appreciate style."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fashionone.com/news/2014/09/29/touch-innuendo-tom-ford-springsummer-2015/ |title=A Touch of Innuendo at Tom Ford Spring/Summer 2015 |date=September 29, 2014 |website=[[Fashion One]] |access-date=April 8, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Parker |first=Ashley Joy |date=August 27, 2013 |title=This Week In Fashion History: The Rise And Rise Of Tom Ford's Empire |url=http://www.fashiontimes.com/articles/595/20130827/week-fashion-history-rise-tom-fords-empire.htm |website=Fashion Times |publisher=[[IBT Media]] |access-date=April 18, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426014328/http://www.fashiontimes.com/articles/595/20130827/week-fashion-history-rise-tom-fords-empire.htm |archive-date=April 26, 2016 }}</ref>

At the time, Italian fashion house [[Gucci]] was struggling financially and was seeking to strengthen its women's ready-to-wear presence as a part of a brand overhaul. The company's creative director, [[Dawn Mello]] said, "no one would dream of wearing Gucci". In 1990, Mello hired Ford as the brand's chief women's ready-to-wear designer and Ford moved to [[Milan]].<ref name=gale /> "I was talking to a lot of people, and most didn't want the job," Mello said. "For an American designer to move to Italy to join a company that was far from being a brand would have been pretty risky." Ford and his longtime partner, fashion journalist Richard Buckley, relocated to Milan that September.<ref name=gale />

Ford's role at Gucci rapidly expanded; he was designing [[Suit (clothing)|menswear]] within six months, and shoes soon after that. When Richard Lambertson left as design director in 1992, Ford took over his position,<ref name=gale /> heading the brand's ready-to-wear, [[Aroma compound|fragrances]], image, [[advertising]], and store design. In 1993, when he was in charge of designing eleven product lines, Ford worked eighteen-hour days. During these years, there were creative tensions between Ford and Maurizio Gucci, the company's chairman and 50% owner. According to Mello, "Maurizio always wanted everything to be round and brown, and Tom wanted to make it square and black." Though Maurizio Gucci wanted to fire Ford, [[Domenico De Sole]] insisted that he remain.<ref name=gale /> Nonetheless, Ford's work during the early 1990s was primarily behind the scenes; his contributions to Gucci were overshadowed by those of Mello, who was the company's public face.

=== Creative Director of Gucci and Saint Laurent ===

In 1994, Ford was promoted to Creative Director of [[Gucci]]. In his first year at the helm, he introduced [[Halston]]-style velvet [[Low-rise (fashion)|hipsters]], skinny [[satin]] shirts and car-finish metallic patent boots.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gucci – Fall 1995 Ready-to-Wear|url=https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-1995-ready-to-wear/gucci#collection|website=vogue.com|access-date=September 21, 2017}}</ref> In 1995, he brought in French [[Wardrobe stylist|stylist]] [[Carine Roitfeld]] and photographer [[Mario Testino]] to create a series of new ad campaigns for the company.<ref>{{cite news |last=Horyn |first=Cathy |date=April 20, 2015 |title=Tom Ford Gets Candid About His Years at Gucci |url=https://nymag.com/thecut/2015/04/tom-ford-gets-candid-about-his-years-at-gucci.html |work=[[New York (magazine)|The Cut]] |access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref> Between 1995 and 1996, sales at [[Gucci]] increased by 90%. At one point, Ford was the largest individual [[shareholder]] of Gucci stock and options. By 1999, the house, which had been almost bankrupt when Ford joined, was valued at more than $4&nbsp;billion.<ref name=bof>{{cite news |last=Amed |first=Imran |date=September 26, 2013 |title=The Business of Being Tom Ford, Part I |url=http://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/people/the-business-of-being-tom-ford-part-i |work=[[The Business of Fashion]] |access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref>

When Gucci acquired the house of [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]] (YSL) in 1999, Ford was named Creative Director of that label as well.<ref name=time>{{cite news |last=Foxman |first=Ariel |date=February 11, 2016 |title=Tom Ford Wants to Change the Way We Shop |url=http://time.com/4217076/tom-ford-fashion-design/ |magazine=[[TIME]] |access-date=March 5, 2016}}</ref> [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Saint Laurent]] did not hide his displeasure with Ford's designs, stating "The poor man does what he can."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/02/fashion/02laurent.html |work=The New York Times |first=Anne-Marie |last=Schiro |title=Yves Saint Laurent, Giant of Couture, Dies at 71 |date=June 2, 2008}}</ref> During his time as creative director for YSL, Ford nonetheless won numerous [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]] Awards.

In April 2004, Ford parted ways with the Gucci group after he and [[CEO]] Domenico de Sole, who is credited as Ford's partner in Gucci's success, failed to agree with Pinault Printemps Redoute's boss over control of the Group.<ref name=bof /><ref name=racked>{{Cite news |last=Schreyer |first=Natalie |date=January 15, 2015 |title=Only One Man Belongs at Gucci, and His Name is Tom Ford |url=http://www.racked.com/2015/1/15/7560789/tom-ford-gucci |work=Racked |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |access-date=April 8, 2016}}</ref> He has since referred to this experience as "devastating" and as a "midlife crisis" because he had "put everything into that for fifteen years".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://the-talks.com/interview/tom-ford/ |title=Tom Ford: "I am really a loner after all" |date=July 20, 2011 |website=The Talks |access-date=March 5, 2016}}</ref> When Ford left in 2004, [[Gucci Group]] was valued at $10&nbsp;billion.<ref name=racked /> Four people were hired to split the work Ford had done.<ref>{{cite news |last=Moran |first=Terry <!-- |date=March 12 year unknown – source gives month-day, but not year.

=== Controversies ===
Ford has been criticized for using naked women in various ad campaigns. Various journalists asserted that the ads were vulgar, sexist, or objectified women. One ad featured a nude woman holding a bottle of the perfume between her legs. Another featured a naked woman ironing a man's pants while he read a newspaper.
