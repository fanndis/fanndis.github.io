'''King's House''' (also known as '''Government House''') is the [[official residence]] of the [[Governor-General of Jamaica]], who represents the [[Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Jamaican Monarch]], and [[head of state]]. It is located in the part of [[St Andrew Parish]] that is considered part of the City of Kingston.

By the year 1690, the first official residence in Jamaica (for use by the [[List of Governors of Jamaica|Governors of Jamaica]]) was in [[Port Royal]]. Another was constructed in [[Spanish Town]] in 1762. When [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] became the capital of Jamaica in 1872, a new official residence (called King's House) was constructed at the former home of the Anglican Lord Bishop of the [[Anglican Diocese of Jamaica|Diocese of Jamaica]]. This house was destroyed by [[1907 Kingston earthquake|an earthquake in 1907]].

Soon after, [[Sir Charles Nicholson, 2nd Baronet|Sir Charles Nicholson]], a British architect supervised the rebuilding and restoration of King's House. Despite a major fire in 1908, the present King's House is structurally similar to the reconstruction of 1907.

Today, King's House is still used as the office of the Governor-General of Jamaica. It is also the venue for state and ceremonial functions, including the swearing in of Ministers of Government and Judges of the High Court.
