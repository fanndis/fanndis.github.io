UK membership ended on 31 January 2020, and the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. (see talk) --> the [[Withdrawal from the European Union|withdrawal]] of the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) from the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (EAEC or Euratom) on 31 January 2020. The UK is to date the first and only country to formally leave the EU after 47 years of membership and cautious integration within the bloc after it first joined its predecessor, the [[European Communities]] (EC), on 1 January 1973. It is also thought to be the first country to voluntarily withdraw from an [[Economic and monetary union|economic and monetary union of countries]] (although the UK never adopted the [[euro]]). Currently{{update after|2020|12|31}} it continues to participate in the [[European Union Customs Union]] and [[European Single Market]] during a transition period that will end on 31 December 2020.

Following a UK-wide [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum in June 2016]], in which 52% voted in favour of leaving the EU and 48% voted to remain a member, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] resigned. On 29 March 2017, the new [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] led by [[Theresa May]] formally notified the EU of the country's intention to withdraw, beginning the [[Brexit negotiations|Brexit process]]. The withdrawal was originally scheduled for 29 March 2019. It was delayed by [[Parliamentary votes on Brexit|deadlock in the UK Parliament]] after the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|June 2017 general election]], which resulted in a [[hung parliament]] in which the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] lost their majority but remained the largest party. This deadlock led to three extensions of the [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50]] process. 

The deadlock was resolved after a [[2019 United Kingdom general election|subsequent general election was held in December 2019]]. In that election, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] who campaigned in support of a "revised" withdrawal agreement led by [[Boris Johnson]] won an overall majority of 80 seats. After the December 2019 election, the UK Parliament [[European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020|finally ratified]] the [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|withdrawal agreement]]. The UK left the EU at 11&nbsp;p.m. [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on 31 January 2020. This began a transition period that is set to end on 31 December 2020, during which the UK and EU are negotiating their future relationship.<ref name="Bennett">{{Cite news|title=How will the Brexit transition period work?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/brexit-2020-transition-period/|newspaper=Telegraph|date=27 January 2020|author=Asa Bennett|access-date=28 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128044559/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/brexit-2020-transition-period/|archive-date=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> During the transition, the UK remains subject to [[European Union law|EU law]] and remains part of the EU [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]] and [[European Single Market|single market]].

Withdrawal was advocated by [[Euroscepticism#Hard Euroscepticism|hard Eurosceptics]] and opposed by [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-Europeanists]] and [[Euroscepticism#Soft Euroscepticism|soft Eurosceptics]], with both sides of the argument spanning the political spectrum. The UK [[Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities|joined]] the [[European Communities]] (EC) – principally the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) – in 1973, and its continued membership was endorsed in the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, withdrawal from the EC was advocated mainly by the political left, e.g. in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s 1983 election manifesto. The 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]] founded the EU, was [[European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993 |ratified by the UK Parliament in 1993]] but was not put to a referendum. The Eurosceptic wing of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] led a [[Maastricht Rebels|rebellion]] over ratification of the treaty and, with the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) and the cross-party [[People's Pledge|People's Pledge campaign]] then led a collective campaign particularly after the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was also [[European Union (Amendment) Act 2008|ratified by the UK Parliament in 2008]] without being put to a referendum following a previous promise to hold a [[European Union Bill 2004–2005|referendum]] on ratifying the abandoned [[European Constitution]] was never held eventually pressured the Conservative [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] [[David Cameron]] to hold a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum]] on continued EU membership, which was held in June 2016. Cameron, who had campaigned to remain, resigned after the result and was succeeded by [[Theresa May]].

On 29 March 2017, the UK government formally began the withdrawal process by [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|invoking Article 50]] of the [[Treaty on European Union]] with [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017|permission from Parliament]]. May called a [[2017 United Kingdom general election|snap general election]] in June 2017, which resulted in a Conservative minority government [[Confidence and supply|supported]] by the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). UK–EU [[Brexit negotiations|withdrawal negotiations]] began later that month. The UK negotiated to leave the EU customs union and single market. This resulted in the November 2018 [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|withdrawal agreement]], but the British parliament [[Parliamentary votes on Brexit|voted against ratifying it]] three times. The Labour Party wanted any agreement to maintain a customs union, while many Conservatives opposed the agreement's [[Brexit divorce bill|financial settlement]], as well as the "[[Irish backstop]]" designed to prevent border controls between [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), and others sought to reverse Brexit through a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|proposed second referendum]].

On 14 March 2019, the UK Parliament voted for May to ask the EU to delay Brexit until June, and then later October.<ref name="Parliament UK">{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2019/march/house-of-commons-to-vote-on-article-50-extension/|title=House of Commons votes to seek Article 50 extension|date=14 March 2019|access-date=11 May 2020}}</ref> Having failed to get her agreement approved, May resigned as Prime Minister in July and was succeeded by [[Boris Johnson]].

Many [[Impact of Brexit|effects of Brexit]] depend on how closely the UK will be tied to the EU, or whether the transition period ends without terms being agreed (a "[[no-deal Brexit]]").<ref name=Edgington/> The broad consensus among economists is that Brexit will likely harm the UK's economy and reduce its real [[per capita income]] in the long term, and that the referendum itself damaged the economy.{{#tag:ref|See:<ref name="NYT Feel Good">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/business/international/brexit-referendum-eu-economy.html|title='Brexit,' a Feel-Good Vote That Could Sink Britain's Economy|last=Goodman|first=Peter S.|date=20 May 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=28 November 2017|issn=0362-4331|quote=finding economists who say they believe that a Brexit will spur the British economy is like looking for a doctor who thinks forswearing vegetables is the key to a long life|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201044816/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/business/international/brexit-referendum-eu-economy.html|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":3" /><ref name="auto8">{{cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/content/brexit-beckons-thinking-ahead-leading-economists|title=Brexit Beckons: Thinking ahead by leading economists|last=Baldwin|first=Richard|date=31 July 2016|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=22 November 2017|quote=On 23 June 2016, 52% of British voters decided that being the first country to leave the EU was a price worth paying for 'taking back control', despite advice from economists clearly showing that Brexit would make the UK 'permanently poorer' (HM Treasury 2016).

The 1955 [[Messina Conference]] deemed that the ECSC was a success, and resolved to extend the concept further, thereby leading to the 1957 [[Treaties of Rome]] establishing the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom).

In accordance with [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitutional convention]], specifically that of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], ratification in the UK was not subject to approval by referendum. Despite this, British constitutional historian [[Vernon Bogdanor]] wrote that there was "a clear constitutional rationale for requiring a referendum" because although MPs are entrusted with legislative power by the electorate, they are not given authority to transfer that power (the UK's previous three referendums all concerned this). Further, as the ratification of the treaty was in the manifestos of the three major political parties, voters opposed to ratification had no way to express it. For Bogdanor, while the ratification by the House of Commons might be legal, it would not be legitimate—which requires popular consent. The way in which the treaty was ratified, he judged, was "likely to have fundamental consequences both for British politics and for Britain's relationship with the [EC]."<ref>Bogdanor also quotes [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government|The Second Treatise of Government]]'': 'The Legislative cannot transfer the power of making laws to any other hands. For it being but a delegated power from the People, they who have it cannot pass it to others.' – Bogdanor, Vernon (8 June 1993).

In December 2015, opinion polls showed a clear majority in favour of remaining in the EU; they also showed support would drop if Cameron did not negotiate adequate safeguards{{Definition needed|What kind of 'safeguards'?|date=April 2019}} for non-eurozone member states, and restrictions on benefits for non-British EU citizens.<ref>[http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/new-open-europecomres-poll-failure-to-win-key-reforms-could-swing-uks-eu-referendum-vote ''New Open Europe/ComRes poll: Failure to win key reforms could swing UK's EU referendum vote''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615190602/https://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/new-open-europecomres-poll-failure-to-win-key-reforms-could-swing-uks-eu-referendum-vote/ |date=15 June 2018 }} openeurope.org, 16 December 2015.</ref>

The outcome of the renegotiations was revealed in February 2016. Some limits to in-work benefits for new EU immigrants were agreed, but before they could be applied, a member state such as the UK would have to get permission from the [[European Commission]] and then from the [[European Council]], which is composed of the heads of government of every member state.<ref name="FF1">{{cite web|url=https://fullfact.org/europe/explaining-eu-deal-emergency-brake|first=Eleanore|last=Spaventa|title=Explaining the EU deal: the "emergency brake"|access-date=25 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329183814/https://fullfact.org/europe/explaining-eu-deal-emergency-brake/|archive-date=29 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Voter demographics and trends===
{{further|Causes of the vote in favour of Brexit}}

A 2017 study published in ''[[Economic Policy (journal)|Economic Policy]]'' showed that the Leave vote tended to be greater in areas which had lower incomes and high [[unemployment]], a strong tradition of [[manufacturing]] employment, and in which the population had fewer [[Qualification types in the United Kingdom|qualifications]]. It also tended to be greater where there was a large flow of Eastern European migrants (mainly low-skilled workers) into areas with a large share of native low-skilled workers.<ref name="Becker-Fetzer-Novy">Sascha O Becker, Thiemo Fetzer, Dennis Novy. [[doi:10.1093/epolic/eix012|"Who voted for Brexit? A comprehensive district-level analysis"]]. ''Economic Policy'', Volume 32, Issue 92, 1 October 2017, pp. 601–650. Quotes: "We find that fundamental characteristics of the voting population were key drivers of the Vote Leave share, in particular, their education profiles, their historical dependence on manufacturing employment as well as low income and high unemployment. At the much finer level of wards within cities, we find that areas with deprivation in terms of education, income and employment were more likely to vote Leave. [...] A larger flow of migrants from Eastern Europe reaching a local authority area with a larger share of unqualified people or a larger share of manufacturing workers is also associated with a larger Vote Leave share".</ref> Those in lower [[NRS social grade|social grades]] (especially the '[[working class]]') were more likely to vote Leave, while those in higher social grades (especially the '[[upper middle class]]') more likely to vote Remain.<ref>Noel Dempsey & Neil Johnston.

Opinion polls found that Leave voters believed leaving the EU was "more likely to bring about a better immigration system, improved border controls, a fairer welfare system, better quality of life, and the ability to control our own laws", while Remain voters believed EU membership "would be better for the economy, international investment, and the UK's influence in the world". Polls found that the main reasons people voted Leave were "the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK", and that leaving "offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders". The main reason people voted Remain was that "the risks of voting to leave the EU looked too great when it came to things like the economy, jobs and prices".<ref>[http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/ "How the United Kingdom voted on Thursday{{nbsp}}... and why"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401203252/http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/ |date=1 April 2019 }}.

In December 2018, the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) ruled that the UK could unilaterally revoke its notification of withdrawal, as long as it was still a member and had not agreed a withdrawal agreement.

===March and April extensions===
On 20 March 2019, the Prime Minister wrote to European Council President Tusk requesting that Brexit be postponed until 30 June 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47647515|title=Brexit: 'Tired' public needs a decision, says Theresa May|work=BBC News|date=20 March 2019|access-date=21 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321015120/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47647515|archive-date=21 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On 21 March 2019, May presented her case to a European Council summit meeting in Brussels. After May left the meeting, a discussion amongst the remaining EU leaders resulted in the rejection of 30 June date and offered instead a choice of two new alternative Brexit dates. On 22 March 2019, the extension options were agreed between the UK government and the European Council.<ref name=SI2019-03-28a/> The first alternative offered was that if MPs rejected May's deal in the next week, Brexit would be due to occur by 12 April 2019, with, or without, a deal—or alternatively another extension be asked for and a commitment to participate in the [[2019 European Parliament election]]s given. The second alternative offered was that if MPs approved May's deal, Brexit would be due to occur on 22 May 2019.

Following the failure of the UK Parliament to approve the Withdrawal Agreement by 29 March, the UK was required to leave the EU on 12 April 2019. On 10 April 2019, late-night talks in Brussels resulted in a further extension, to 31 October 2019; Theresa May had again requested an extension only until 30 June. Under the terms of this new extension, if the Withdrawal Agreement were to be passed before October, Brexit would occur on the first day of the subsequent month. The UK would then be obligated to hold European Parliament elections in May, or leave the EU on 1 June without a deal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47889404|title=New Brexit deadline set for 31&nbsp;October|date=11 April 2019|access-date=11 April 2019|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411015652/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47889404|archive-date=11 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/39042/10-euco-art50-conclusions-en.pdf|title=Special meeting of the European Council (Art. 50) (10&nbsp;April 2019) – Conclusions|last=European Council|date=10 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411085340/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/39042/10-euco-art50-conclusions-en.pdf|archive-date=11 April 2019|url-status=live|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref>

===Revised withdrawal agreement===

===Domestic legislation after Article 50 notification===

====European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018====
{{Main|European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018}}

In October 2016, Theresa May promised a "Great Repeal Bill", which would repeal the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] and restate in UK law all enactments previously in force under EU law. Subsequently renamed the European Union (Withdrawal) bill, it was introduced to the House of Commons on 13 July 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2017-19/europeanunionwithdrawal.html|title=European Union (Withdrawal) Bill 2017–19 – UK Parliament|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|access-date=23 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725141501/https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2017-19/europeanunionwithdrawal.html|archive-date=25 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 12 September 2017, the bill passed its first vote and second reading by a margin of 326 votes to 290 votes in the House of Commons.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41235522|title=EU repeal bill wins first Commons vote|date=12 September 2017|access-date=1 November 2017|work=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727155411/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41235522|archive-date=27 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The bill was further amended on a series of votes in both Houses. After the Act became law on 26 June 2018, the European Council decided on 29 June to renew its call on Member States and Union institutions to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/35966/29-euco-art50-conclusions-en.pdf|title=Conclusions adopted by the European Council (Art. 50), 29&nbsp;June 2018|website=europa.eu|access-date=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214172737/https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/35966/29-euco-art50-conclusions-en.pdf|archive-date=14 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Withdrawal Act fixed the period ending 21 January 2019 for the government to decide on how to proceed if the negotiations have not reached agreement in principle on both the withdrawal arrangements and the framework for the future relationship between the UK and EU; while, alternatively, making future ratification of the withdrawal agreement as a treaty between the UK and EU depend upon the prior enactment of another act of Parliament for approving the final terms of withdrawal when the current [[Brexit negotiations]] are completed. In any event, the act does not alter the two-year period for negotiating allowed by Article 50 that ends at the latest on 29 March 2019 if the UK has not by then ratified a withdrawal agreement or agreed a prolongation of the negotiating period.<ref name=ExitDay01a/>

The Withdrawal Act which became law in June 2018 allows for various outcomes including no negotiated settlement. It authorises the government to bring into force, by [[Statutory instrument (UK)|order]] made under section 25, the provisions that fix "exit day" and the repeal of the European Communities Act 1972, but exit day must be the same day and time as when the EU Treaties are to cease to apply to the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/brexit/negotiations/what-is-exit-day-dispelling-misconceptions-about-the-extension-of-article-50/|title=What is "exit day"?

=====Nuclear Safeguards Act 2018=====
The [[Nuclear Safeguards Act 2018]], relating to withdrawal from Euratom, was presented to Parliament in October 2017. The act makes provision about nuclear safeguards, and for connected
purposes. The Secretary of State may by regulations ("nuclear safeguards regulations") make provision for the purpose of — (a) ensuring that qualifying nuclear material, facilities or
equipment are available only for use for civil activities (whether in the UK or elsewhere), or (b) giving effect to provisions of a relevant international agreement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/15/pdfs/ukpga_20180015_en.pdf|title=Nuclear Safeguards Act 2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=3 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214033335/https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/15/pdfs/ukpga_20180015_en.pdf|archive-date=14 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== 2019 British general election ===
In the run-up to the general election on 12 December 2019 the Conservative Party pledged to leave the EU with the withdrawal agreement negotiated in October 2019. Labour promised to renegotiate aforementioned deal and hold a referendum, letting voters choose between the renegotiated deal and remain. The Liberal Democrats vowed to revoke Article 50, while the SNP intended to hold a second referendum, however, revoking Article 50 if the alternative was a no-deal exit. The DUP supported Brexit, but would seek to change parts related to Northern Ireland it was dissatisfied with. [[Plaid Cymru]] and the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] backed a second referendum, believing the UK should stay in the EU. The [[Brexit Party]] was the only major party running for election which wanted the UK to leave the EU without a deal.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Where do the parties stand on Brexit?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48027580|access-date=13 September 2020|website=BBC News|language=en}}</ref>

On 2 June 2020, Chancellor of Germany [[Angela Merkel]] stated that the [[European Union]] must prepare for the possible failure of Brexit trade talks with the [[UK]]. She added that negotiations were being accelerated to try and reach a deal that could be ratified by the end of the year. Her warning came as the deadline for extending talks passed away, with negotiations expected to end on 31 December with or without a deal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-no-deal-eu-merkel-germany-trade-talks-boris-johnson-a9595511.html|title=Brexit: EU must prepare for no-deal, Merkel warns|access-date=2 June 2020|website=Independent}}</ref>

===Litigation===
There has been litigation to explore the constitutional footings on which Brexit stands after ''[[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]]'' (simply known as the "Miller case") and the 2017 Notification Act:
* In ''R. (Webster) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union'', a [[Divisional court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] of [[Peter Gross (judge)|Gross LJ]] and [[Nicholas Green (judge)|Green MR]] determined that the substantive decision to leave the EU that was notified on 29 March 2017 was in fact the executive decision of the Prime Minister using a statutory power of decision found to have been delegated to her by the Notification Act: this is confirmed by the [[House of Commons Library]] commentary on the case.<ref name="Miller">{{Cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Vaughne|last2=Mars|first2=Sylvia de|date=1 November 2019|title=Brexit questions in national and EU courts|url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8415|access-date=4 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200119084822/https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8415|archive-date=19 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The case was appealed to the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/a50-chall-her-e50/|title=Article 50 Challenge|work=CrowdJustice|access-date=20 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522112547/https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/a50-chall-her-e50/|archive-date=22 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and paragraph 15 of the judgement, along with the citable nature of the decision were upheld.  While the case was criticised academically by Robert Craig, who lectures in jurisprudence at the London School of Economics, <ref>{{cite news|url=https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2018/06/26/robert-craig-new-article-50-case-resoundingly-rejected-by-the-divisional-court/|title=Robert Craig: New Article 50 Case Resoundingly Rejected by the Divisional Court|date=26 June 2018|work=UK Constitutional Law Association|access-date=20 November 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708132234/https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2018/06/26/robert-craig-new-article-50-case-resoundingly-rejected-by-the-divisional-court/|archive-date=8 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> aspects of the case's analysis were supported by the [[UK Supreme Court]] in [[R (Miller) v The Prime Minister and Cherry v Advocate General for Scotland|Miller 2]] at paragraph 57, which confirmed that:

:<blockquote>Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the democratically elected representatives of the people, has a right to have a voice in how that change comes about is indisputable.</blockquote>

* This confirmation that the decision was an executive act was part of the basis of [[R (Wilson) v Prime Minister|''R.'' (''Wilson) v.

==Impact==
{{Main|Impact of Brexit}}

Many effects of Brexit depended on whether the UK left with a [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|withdrawal agreement]], or before an agreement was ratified ([[No-deal Brexit|"no-deal" Brexit]]).<ref name="What is a 'no deal' Brexit?">{{cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/brexit/no-deal-brexit-what-meaning-uk-leave-uk-consequences/|title=What is a no-deal Brexit?

This includes multilateral agreements based on consensus, where Britain must re-approach 132 separate parties. Around 110 separate opt-in accords at the UN and World Trade Organization are excluded from the estimates, as are narrow agreements on the environment, health, research and science. Some additional UK bilateral deals, outside the EU framework, may also need to be revised because they make reference to EU law. Some of the 759 are so essential that it would be unthinkable to operate without them. Air services agreements allow British aeroplanes to land in America, Canada or Israel; nuclear accords permit the trade in spare parts and fuel for Britain's power stations. Both these sectors are excluded from trade negotiations and must be addressed separately.|url-access=subscription|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531162500/https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e|archive-date=31 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Economists expect that Brexit will have damaging [[Economic effects of Brexit|immediate and longer term effects]] on the economies of the UK and at least part of the EU27.
