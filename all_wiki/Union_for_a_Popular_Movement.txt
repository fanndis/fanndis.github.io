The '''Union for a Popular Movement''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Union pour un mouvement populaire}} {{IPA-fr|ynjɔ̃ puʁ œ̃ muvmɑ̃ pɔpylɛʁ}}; '''UMP''' {{IPA-fr|y.ɛmpe}}) was a [[centre-right]]<ref name="centreright"/> [[List of political parties in France|political party in France]] that was one of the two [[major party|major]] contemporary political parties in France along with the centre-left [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS). The UMP was formed in 2002 as a merger of several centre-right parties under the leadership of President [[Jacques Chirac]]. In May 2015, the party was renamed and succeeded by [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] (''{{Lang|fr|Les Républicains}}'').<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/boost-for-sarkozy-as-ump-party-changes-its-name-to-the-republicans-10286171.html|title = Nicolas Sarkozy changes UMP party's name to The Republicans ahead of political comeback|date = 30 May 2015|access-date = 30 May 2015|website = [[The Independent]]|last = Bolton|first = Doug|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150530140105/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/boost-for-sarkozy-as-ump-party-changes-its-name-to-the-republicans-10286171.html|archive-date = 30 May 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="yahoo1">{{cite web|url = https://news.yahoo.com/frances-sarkozy-renames-ump-party-republicans-211542144.html|title = France's Sarkozy renames UMP party 'The Republicans'|date = 29 May 2015|access-date = 1 June 2015|website = [[Yahoo News]]|last = AFP|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151115170317/http://news.yahoo.com/frances-sarkozy-renames-ump-party-republicans-211542144.html|archive-date = 15 November 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

[[Nicolas Sarkozy]], then the president of the UMP, was elected [[President of France]] in the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]], but was defeated by PS candidate [[François Hollande]] in a run-off [[2012 French presidential election|five years later]]. After the November 2012 party congress, the UMP experienced internal fractioning and was plagued by monetary scandals which forced its president, [[Jean-François Copé]], to resign. After his re-election as UMP president in November 2014, Sarkozy put forward an amendment to change the name of the party into The Republicans, which was approved and came into effect on 30 May 2015.<ref name=":0"/><ref name="yahoo1"/>

The UMP enjoyed an [[absolute majority]] in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] from 2002 to 2012 and was a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP), the [[Centrist Democrat International]] (CDI) and the [[International Democrat Union]] (IDU).

==History==

===Background===
Since the 1980s, the political groups of the parliamentary right have joined forces around the values of [[economic liberalism]] and the [[European integration|building of Europe]]. Their rivalries had contributed to their defeat in the [[1981 French legislative election|1981]] and [[1988 French legislative election|1988]] legislative elections.

Before the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative election]], the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR) and the centrist [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF) formed an electoral alliance, the [[Union for France]] (UPF). However, in the [[1995 French presidential election|1995 presidential campaign]] they were both divided between followers of [[Jacques Chirac]], who was eventually elected, and supporters of Prime Minister [[Edouard Balladur]]. After their defeat in the [[1997 French legislative election|1997 legislative election]], the RPR and UDF created the [[Alliance for France]] in order to coordinate the actions of their parliamentary groups.

===Foundation and early years===
Before the [[2002 French presidential election|2002 presidential campaign]], the supporters of President [[Jacques Chirac]], divided in three centre-right parliamentary parties, founded an association named '''Union on the Move''' (''Union en mouvement'').<ref name="ump-history">{{cite web|url= http://www.france-politique.fr/histoire-ump.htm|publisher= France politique|title= chronologie UMP|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090619070817/http://www.france-politique.fr/histoire-ump.htm|archive-date= 19 June 2009|df= dmy-all}}</ref> After Chirac's re-election, in order to contest the [[2002 French legislative election|legislative election]] jointly, the '''Union for the Presidential Majority''' (''Union pour la majorité présidentielle'') was created. It was renamed "Union for a Popular Movement" and as such established as a permanent organisation.<ref name="ump-history"/>

The UMP was the merger of the Gaullist-conservative [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR), the [[conservative liberalism|conservative-liberal]] party [[Liberal Democracy (France)|Liberal Democracy]] (DL), a sizeable portion of the [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF),<ref name="EthridgeHandelman2009">{{cite book|author1=Marcus E. Ethridge|author2=Howard Handelman|title=Politics in a Changing World: A Comparative Introduction to Political Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RkLVlONHyUC&pg=PA144|access-date=19 August 2012|date=16 January 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57048-6|page=144}}</ref> more precisely the UDF's Christian Democrats (such as [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]] and [[Jacques Barrot]]), the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] and the centrist [[Popular Party for French Democracy]] (both associate parties of the UDF until 2002). In the UMP four major French political families were thus represented: [[Gaullism]], [[republicanism]] (the kind of liberalism put forward by parties like the [[Democratic Republican Alliance]] or the [[Republican Party (France)|PR]], heir of DL), [[Christian democracy]] (''[[Popolarismo|Popularism]]'') and [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]].

Chirac's close ally [[Alain Juppé]] became the party's first president at the party's founding congress at the [[Le Bourget (Seine-Saint-Denis)|Bourget]] in November 2002. Juppé won 79.42% of the vote, defeating [[Nicolas Dupont-Aignan]], the leader of the party's Eurosceptic [[Arise the Republic]] faction, and three other candidates.<ref name="ump-history"/> During the party's earlier years, it was marked by tensions and rivalries between Juppé and other ''chiraquiens'' and supporters of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], the then-[[Ministry of Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]].

In the [[2004 French regional elections|2004 regional elections]] the UMP suffered a heavy blow, winning the presidencies of only 2 out of 22 regions in metropolitan France ([[Alsace]] and [[Corsica]]) and only half of the departments (the right had previously won numerous departmental presidencies) in the simultaneous [[2004 French cantonal elections|2004 cantonal elections]]. In the [[2004 European Parliament election in France|2004 European Parliament election]] on 13 June 2004, the UMP also suffered another heavy blow, winning 16.6% of the vote, far behind the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS), and only 16 seats.

===Nicolas Sarkozy (2004–2012)===
Juppé resigned the party's presidency on 15 July 2004 after being found guilty in a [[political corruption|corruption scandal]] in January of the same year. Nicolas Sarkozy rapidly announced that he would take over the presidency of the UMP and resign his position as [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|finance minister]], ending months of speculation. On 28 November 2004, Sarkozy was elected to the party's presidency with 85.09% of the votes against 9.1% for Dupont-Aignan and 5.82% for [[Christine Boutin]], the leader of the [[Forum of Social Republicans|UMP's social conservatives]].<ref name="ump-history"/><ref>{{cite web|author=e-TF1|url=http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/france/2004/0,,3187726,00-sacre-sarkozy-.html|title=Info et Actualité en direct – Toutes les actualités et infos – MYTF1News|publisher=Tf1.lci.fr|language=fr|access-date=30 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023174053/http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/france/2004/0,,3187726,00-sacre-sarkozy-.html|archive-date=23 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Having gained control of what had been Chirac's party, Sarkozy focused the party machinery and his energies on the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]].

The failure of the [[2005 French European Constitution referendum|referendum on the European Constitution]] on 25 May 2005 led to the fall of the [[Raffarin Government|government of Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] and to the formation of a new cabinet, presided by another UMP politician, [[Dominique de Villepin]]. However, during this time, the UMP under Sarkozy gained a record number of new members and rejuvenated itself in preparation of the 2007 election. On 14 January 2007, Sarkozy was nominated unopposed as the UMP's presidential candidate for the 2007 election.

On the issues, the party under Sarkozy publicly disapproved of [[Turkey]]'s proposed membership in the European Union, which Chirac had previously endorsed several times publicly, and generally took a more right-wing position.

On 22 April 2007 [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] won the plurality of votes in the first round of the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]]. On 6 May he faced the Socialist Party candidate [[Ségolène Royal]] in the second round and won, taking 53.06% of the vote. As a consequence, he resigned from the presidency of the UMP on 14 May 2007, two days before becoming President of the French Republic. [[François Fillon]] was appointed Prime Minister. On 17 June 2007, at a [[2007 French legislative election|2007 legislative election]], the UMP gained a majority in the National Assembly with 313 out of 577 seats.

Following Sarkozy's election to the presidency, interim leader [[Jean-Claude Gaudin]] prevented a leadership struggle between [[Patrick Devedjian]] and [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] by announcing that the UMP should have a collegial leadership while Sarkozy was President of the Republic.<ref>[https://archive.today/20070521032939/http://www.lexpress.fr/info/quotidien/actu.asp?id=12318 Devedjian-Raffarin: une direction à deux têtes pour l'UMP], ''[[L'Express]]'', 26 June 2007</ref> In July, the UMP's national council approved an amendment to the party's statute allowing for a collegial leadership around three vice-presidents (Jean-Pierre Raffarin, Jean-Claude Gaudin and [[Pierre Méhaignerie]]) and a secretary-general ([[Patrick Devedjian]]) and two associate secretary-generals.

In 9 March 2008 [[2008 French municipal elections|municipal]] and [[2008 French cantonal elections|cantonal]] elections, the party performed quite poorly, losing numerous cities, such as [[Toulouse]] and [[Strasbourg]], as well as eight departmental presidencies to the left. [[Xavier Bertrand]] was selected as secretary-general of the party in late 2008 to replace [[Patrick Devedjian]], who resigned to take up a cabinet position.<ref>[http://www.lalibre.be/actu/international/article/477212/xavier-bertrand-elu-secretaire-general-de-l-ump.html Xavier Bertrand, Secrétaire Général de l’UMP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611095628/http://www.lalibre.be/actu/international/article/477212/xavier-bertrand-elu-secretaire-general-de-l-ump.html |date=11 June 2011 }}, ''[[La Libre Belgique]]'' 8 December 2008</ref>

In the [[2009 European Parliament election in France|2009 European Parliament election]] on 7 June 2009, the UMP ran common lists with its junior allies including [[Jean-Louis Borloo]]'s [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]], the [[New Centre]] and [[Modern Left]]. The UMP list won 27.9%, a remarkably good result for a governing party in off-year "mid-term" elections, and elected 29 MEPs, significantly improving on the UMP's poor result in the 2004 European election – also an off-year election. However, in the [[2010 French regional elections|2010 regional elections]] on 14 and 21 March 2010, the UMP obtained a very poor result with only 26%. While it lost Corsica, it retained Alsace but also defeated the left in ''[[La Réunion]]'' and [[French Guiana]].

In a cabinet reshuffle in November 2010, which disappointed centrists within and outside the UMP, François Fillon was confirmed Prime Minister and [[Alain Juppé]] re-joined the government. Among those who resigned from the cabinet were [[Bernard Kouchner]], [[Hervé Morin]] and, above all, [[Jean-Louis Borloo]]. Xavier Bertrand, who re-joined the government, was replaced as general-secretary of the UMP by [[Jean-François Copé]] on 17 November 2010.<ref>{{cite web|author=lefigaro.fr|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2010/11/14/01002-20101114ARTFIG00213-remaniement-le-gouvernement-fillon-iii-ancre-a-droite-pour-2012.php|title=Le Figaro – Politique : Remaniement : le gouvernement Fillon III ancré à droite pour 2012|work=Le Figaro|location=France|access-date=21 April 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303012108/http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2010/11/14/01002-20101114ARTFIG00213-remaniement-le-gouvernement-fillon-iii-ancre-a-droite-pour-2012.php|archive-date=3 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=lefigaro.fr|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2010/11/15/01002-20101115ARTFIG00554-borloo-et-morin-sonnent-la-revolte-des-centristes.php|title=Le Figaro – Politique : Borloo et Morin sonnent la révolte des centristes|work=Le Figaro|location=France|date=16 November 2010|access-date=21 April 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123123541/http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2010/11/15/01002-20101115ARTFIG00554-borloo-et-morin-sonnent-la-revolte-des-centristes.php|archive-date=23 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The party suffered another major electoral defeat in the [[2011 French cantonal elections|2011 cantonal elections]] held on 20 and 27 March 2011, and in September, the centre-right lost control of the [[French Senate]] for the first time in the history of the Fifth Republic.

In May 2011, during a party congress, the Radical Party, led by Borloo, decided to leave the UMP and launch [[The Alliance (France)|The Alliance]], a new [[centrism|centrist]] coalition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualite/politique/20110514.OBS3117/le-parti-radical-vote-son-independance-vis-a-vis-de-l-ump.html/ |title=Le Parti radical vote son indépendance vis-à-vis de l'UMP |publisher=Le Nouvel Observateur |language=fr |date=14 May 2011 |access-date=30 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517103319/http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualite/politique/20110514.OBS3117/le-parti-radical-vote-son-independance-vis-a-vis-de-l-ump.html/ |archive-date=17 May 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.germain-isern.com/2011/05/maurice-leroy-croit-en-une-grande.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516121628/http://www.germain-isern.com/2011/05/maurice-leroy-croit-en-une-grande.html |archive-date=16 May 2013 }}</ref><ref>http://www.partiradical.net/images/stories/evenement/invitationlancementdelalliance.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Six 'motions' (declarations of principles) were submitted to party voters; under the new statutes, motions which won over 10% of the vote at the congress would be recognised as "movements" by the UMP leadership, granted financial autonomy and receive positions in the party structures.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

====Resolution====
Both rivals reached an agreement at the end of December 2012,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/ump-l-accord-cope-fillon-adopte-a-l-unanimite-par-le-bureau-politique_1200751.html |title=UMP: l'accord Copé-Fillon adopté à l'unanimité par le bureau politique |publisher=L'EXPRESS |access-date=30 November 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203101400/http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/ump-l-accord-cope-fillon-adopte-a-l-unanimite-par-le-bureau-politique_1200751.html |archive-date=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> with Copé agreeing to the organisation of a new election and a modification of party statutes while Fillon agreed to dissolve his parliamentary group.

The party's leadership was reorganized in January 2013 to accommodate Copé and Fillon's supporters: [[Laurent Wauquiez]] and [[Valérie Pécresse]] joined [[Luc Chatel]] and [[Michèle Tabarot]] as vice-president and secretary-general respectively. [[Christian Estrosi]], [[Gérard Longuet]], [[Henri de Raincourt]] (pro-Fillon), [[Jean-Claude Gaudin]], [[Brice Hortefeux]] and [[Roger Karoutchi]] (pro-Copé) also became vice-presidents.

==== Bygmalion Scandal====
Several spending scandals appeared in 2014. In early 2014, the Bygmalion scandal ([[:fr:Bygmalion#Affaire UMP-Bygmalion|fr]]) pushed the party's leader [[Jean-François Copé]] to resign. In early July, [[Sarkozy]] got held in custody due to possible spying and active corruption of the judiciary system. On 8 July 2014, the UMP was discovered to have a hidden debt of €79.1&nbsp;million for the year 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2014/07/08/que-deviendrait-la-dette-de-l-ump-si-le-parti-disparaissait_4453316_4355770.html|title=Que deviendrait la dette de l'UMP si le parti disparaissait ?|website=Le Monde.fr}}</ref>

===Name change and dissolution===
After the election of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], the former [[President of France]] (2007–2012), as president of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) in November 2014, he put forward a request to the party's general committee to change its name to the Republicans as well as the statutes of the party. With the name already chosen [[Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet]], vice president of the UMP, presented [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and the party's political bureau a project of new statutes. The proposed statutes provided for, among others, the election of the presidents of the departmental federations by direct suffrage, the end of the political currents and consulting members on election nominations.<ref>{{cite web |language=fr |author1=Anne-Laëtitia Béraud |title=L'UMP se dote des statuts du nouveau parti baptisé "Les Républicains |work=[[20 minutes (France)|20minutes.fr]] |date=14 April 2015 |url=http://www.20minutes.fr/politique/1586487-20150414-ump-dote-statuts-future-formation-republicains |access-date=18 April 2015}}</ref>

Critics of Sarkozy claimed it was illegal for him to name the party "Republicans" because every French person is a republican in that they support the values and ideals of the [[France|French Republic]] that emanated from the [[French Revolution]], and as such the term is above party politics.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/france-sarkozy-les-republicains-ump-socialists|title = France: judges clear way for Sarkozy to rename UMP party Les Républicains|date = 26 May 2015|access-date = 1 June 2015|website = [[The Guardian]]|last = Chrisafis|first = Angelique|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150531074927/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/france-sarkozy-les-republicains-ump-socialists|archive-date = 31 May 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> The new name was adopted by the bureau on 5 May 2015 and approved by the party membership on 28 May by an online '''yes''' vote of 83.28% on a 45.74% participation after a court ruling in favor of Sarkozy.<ref name="LP3052015">Pauline Théveniaud (avec Olivier Beaumont), [http://m.leparisien.fr/politique/les-republicains-reunis-a-paris-pour-leur-congres-fondateur-30-05-2015-4817071.php Congrès des «Républicains» : «Un jour de renaissance», pour Sarkozy] ''Le Parisien'', 30 mai 2015</ref> Similarly the new party statutes are adopted by 96.34% of voters and the composition of the new party's political bureau by 94.77%.
[[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] thus became the legal successor of the UMP as the leading centre-right party in France.<ref name="yahoo1"/>

==Ideology==
The UMP was a [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] party and was created to represent the various families of the French right, uniting the traditions of [[Gaullism]], [[Christian democracy]], conservatism and liberalism. As such, it officially adopted fairly vague policy statements which emphasize consensual common values.

The UMP believed that each individual's [[destiny]] must be unencumbered and it rejects political systems which "stifle economic freedom". It said that work, merit, innovation and personal initiative must be encouraged to reduce unemployment and boost economic growth; but at the same time, it maintained that adherence to the rule of law and the authority of the state is necessary. In a [[Gaullist]] tradition, the UMP supported solidarity, with the state guaranteeing social protection of less fortunate individuals. But in a more liberal vein, the party always denounced ''l'assistanat'', a French term which can refer to "welfare [[handouts]]".

The party took more nationalist positions at times, and often adopted tough stances against immigration and [[illegal immigration]]. It strongly supported the integration and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of immigrants into French society and always denounced [[communitarianism]] as a danger to the French [[nation-state]]. However, the UMP traditionally was a strong proponent of [[European integration]] and the [[European Union]], albeit sometimes with a hint of traditional Gaullist [[souverainism]].<ref>[http://www.u-m-p.org/notre-parti/nos-valeurs Nos valeurs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424005425/http://www.u-m-p.org/notre-parti/nos-valeurs |date=24 April 2013 }} UMP website, consulted 15 March 2013</ref>

Under [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]'s leadership, the UMP adopted a liberal and security-oriented platform. His platform in the [[2007 French presidential election|2007]] and [[2012 French presidential election|2012]] presidential elections emphasized the ideas of personal responsibility and individual initiative. He developed the idea of "working more to earn more", promising that [[overtime]] hours would not be taxed and employers exonerated from [[non-wage labour costs]].<ref name="BrechonPierre">{{Citation |first1=Bréchon |last1=Pierre|title=Les partis politiques français |publisher=La documentation française |year=2011 |pages=62–65}}</ref> Under his presidency, the government's short-lived [[tax cap]] for high-income earners was denounced by the left but also several centrist and centre-right politicians within or outside the UMP.

Having gained his popularity as a 'hardliner' [[Ministry of the Interior (France)|Interior minister]], Sarkozy's policies also carried a strong law-and-order and tough on crime orientation. He supported tougher sentences for criminals and [[Recidivism|repeat offenders]].<ref name="BrechonPierre"/> As candidate and President, he placed heavy emphasis on immigration and [[national identity]], presenting immigration as a danger to French identity and as source of increased criminality. As President, he imposed stricter limits on [[family reunification]], created a [[French Ministry of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Codevelopment|Ministry of Immigration, and National Identity]] for three years between 2007 and 2010, launched a controversial national dialogue on national identity and [[French Roma expulsion|expelled thousands]] of [[Romani people|Roma]] from illegal camps.<ref name="BrechonPierre"/>

Critics of the right-wing government denounced what they felt was a rapprochement with the controversial far-right [[National Front (France)|National Front]] (FN). While several members of the UMP's right-wing have indicated that they would favour local alliances with the FN and prefer to vote for a FN candidate over a [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] or left-wing candidate in runoff elections between the left and the FN; the party's official position continues to reject alliances with the FN at any level but also opposes so-called "republican fronts" with the left against the FN.<ref>[http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/2012/06/11/ni-fn-ni-front-republicain-l-ump-choisit-de-ne-pas-choisir_825481 Ni FN ni front républicain: l'UMP choisit de ne pas choisir] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306052808/http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/2012/06/11/ni-fn-ni-front-republicain-l-ump-choisit-de-ne-pas-choisir_825481 |date=6 March 2013 }} ''[[Libération]]'', 11 June 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.slate.fr/story/57663/droite-ump-fn-convergence UMP/FN: La recomposition des droites, hypothèse crédible ou fantasme mariniste] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521163748/http://www.slate.fr/story/57663/droite-ump-fn-convergence |date=21 May 2013 }} ''Slate'', 17 June 2012</ref>

==Factions==
The UMP's original statutes in 2002 allowed for the organisation of formal factions or movements within the party, to represent the various political families of which it was made up. However, fearing leadership rivalries and divisions, Juppé, Chirac and later Sarkozy 'postponed' the creation of such organised movements indefinitely. Nevertheless, prior to the organisations of formal "movements" in November 2012, there existed informal groupings of like-minded members, either through associations, political clubs, associated political parties or even informal factions.

[[Jean-François Copé]] allowed for the organisation of formal movements within the party following the November 2012 congress. According to the party's statutes, motions backed by at least 10 parliamentarians from 10 departmental federations and which obtain at least 10% support from members at a congress are recognised as movements. They are granted financial autonomy by way of a fixed grant and additional funding in proportion to the votes they obtained; but the sum of funds transferred by the party to its movements can be no larger than 30% of the annual public subsidies the UMP receives from the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-m-p-44.org/IMG/pdf/statuts_nationaux-2.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418045144/http://www.u-m-p-44.org/IMG/pdf/statuts_nationaux-2.pdf |archive-date=18 April 2012 }} Articles 15 à 18 des statuts de l'UMP</ref>

===Official movement and factions===
Six motions representing various ideological tendencies within the party ran to be recognised as official movements following the [[2012 Union for a Popular Movement leadership election|November 2012 congress]]. Five of these motions met the conditions to be recognised as such, and their leaders have since integrated the UMP's leadership structure:

===Associate parties===
The [[Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition]], the [[Christian Democratic Party (France)|Christian Democratic Party]], the [[Rally for France]] and [[The Progressives]] are associate parties of the UMP. By adhering to these parties, members also adhered to the UMP and could participate in the UMP's inner organisation. The [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] was associated with the UMP from 2002 through 2011.

Overseas parties associated with the UMP included [[O Porinetia To Tatou Ai'a]] in [[French Polynesia]] and [[The Rally–UMP]] in [[New Caledonia]].

===2012 leadership election===
The aforementioned [[2012 Union for a Popular Movement leadership election|November 2012 congress]] saw the division of the party between the two candidates who sought the party's presidency, [[François Fillon]] and [[Jean-François Copé]] – the ''fillonistes'' and ''copéistes''.

==Popular support==
The UMP's electoral base reflects that of the old [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR) and, in some cases, that of the [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF). In the 2007 presidential election, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] performed best in the east of France – particularly [[Alsace]] (36.2%); [[Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur]] (37.0%) – the wealthy coastal [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] (43.6%) was his best department in France; [[Champagne-Ardenne]] (32.7%) and [[Rhône-Alpes]] (32.7%). These areas were among [[National Front (France)|National Front]] candidate [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s best regions in 2002 and are conservative on issues such as immigration. Sarkozy received a lot of votes from voters who had supported the far-right in April 2002. For example, in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]], Sarkozy performed 21.6% better than Chirac did in 2002 while Le Pen lost 12.6% in five years.<ref name="ifop">{{cite web|url= http://www.ifop.com/?option=com_publication&type=publication&id=31|title= IFOP analysis|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090711092834/http://www.ifop.com/?option=com_publication&type=publication&id=31|archive-date= 11 July 2009|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Sarkozy also appealed more than average to [[blue-collar]] workers in regions such as northern [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]] and the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]], although most of these regions, despite his gains, remain reliably left-wing.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://cdsp.sciences-po.fr/AE.php|title= Results|publisher= CDSP website|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://archive.today/20120604090721/http://cdsp.sciences-po.fr/AE.php|archive-date= 4 June 2012|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The party is also strong in every election in very wealthy suburban or coastal (and, in some cases, urban) areas such as [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] (72.6% for Sarkozy in the first round),<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/053/035/5335.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090718013732/http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/053/035/5335.html|archive-date= 18 July 2009|df= dmy-all}}</ref> [[Saint-Tropez]] (54.79%),<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/093/083/83119.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page|url-status= live|archive-url= http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223235757/http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/093/083/83119.html|archive-date= 23 February 2011|df= dmy-all}}</ref> [[Cannes]] (48.19%)<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/093/006/06029.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090309064124/http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/093/006/06029.html|archive-date= 9 March 2009|df= dmy-all}}</ref> or [[Marcq-en-Barœul]] (47.35%).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/031/059/59378.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page}}</ref> It is strong in most rural areas, like most conservative parties in the world, but this does not extend to the rural areas of the south of France, areas which are old strongholds of [[republicanism|republican]] and secular ideals. However, in old "clerical" Catholic rural areas, such as parts of [[Lozère]] or [[Cantal]], it is very strong, as was the UDF during its hey day.

However, the UMP does poorly in one of the UDF's best regions, [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]], where the decline of religious practice, a moderate electorate and urbanisation has hurt the UMP and also the UDF. Nicolas Sarkozy performed relatively poorly in departments with a large share of moderate Christian democratic (often centrist or centre-right) voters, such as [[Lozère]] where the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] candidate [[Ségolène Royal]] performed better (44.3%) than [[François Mitterrand]] had in his 1988 left-wing landslide (43.1%). While former President [[Jacques Chirac]], the right's strongman in normally left-wing [[Corrèze]] had always done very well in Corrèze and the surrounding departments, Sarkozy did very poorly and actually lost the department in the 2007 runoff. However, in the [[2009 European Parliament election in France|2009 European election]], the UMP's results in those departments were superior to Sarkozy's first round result (nationally, they were 4% lower).<ref name="ifop" />
