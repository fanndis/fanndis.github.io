The HD3 subchannel [[simulcast]]s the [[Contemporary Christian]] format heard on [[KTLF]] in [[Colorado Springs]].

== History ==
===KFML-FM and KIMN-FM===
The station [[sign on|signed on]] the air on December 1, 1953 as '''KFML-FM'''.<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1956/Radio-AL-MT-1956-BC-YB.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1956 page 96]</ref>  It was owned by Everett A. Bancker, Jr. and was the FM counterpart to [[AM 1390]] KFML (now [[KGNU]]).  Because the AM station was a [[daytimer]], listeners could continue to hear its programming after sunset on KFML-FM.

Following the sale of the station to [[Lincoln Financial Media|Jefferson-Pilot Broadcasting]] in 1974, the station took the '''KIMN-FM''' [[call sign]].  (The [[KIMN]] currently reside at 100.3 FM in Denver, though that station is owned by [[Kroenke Sports & Entertainment]].)

At first, KIMN-FM aired a softer [[album-oriented rock|album rock]] format while [[AM 950]] KIMN (now [[KKSE (AM)|KKSE]]) had a [[contemporary hit radio|Top 40]] format.  KIMN-FM later started playing Top 40 music, similar to its AM [[sister station]].  In the 1970s, there were a couple of country & western AM stations in Denver, though the music was not heard on FM, even though country was making inroads on FM stations in other cities.

===Switch to KYGO Country===
On June 1, 1979, 98.5 switched its call letters to '''KYGO''' and later that year changed from contemporary hits to country music.<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1980/C-1%20Radio%20Broadcasting%20Yearbook%201980.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page C-34]</ref>  Bob Call, previously with country-formatted [[WSOC-FM]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], supervised the change.  When he started at WSOC-FM, he said he knew little about country music, but learned fast. In 2006, as part of [[Lincoln Financial Media]]'s acquisition of Jefferson-Pilot (including the J-P media properties), KYGO became a Lincoln Financial Media station.

On April 26, 1988, the station slightly changed its call letters to '''KYGO-FM'''.  At the same time, AM 950 switched its call sign to KYGO, and began airing a [[classic country]] format, to be a companion to FM 98.5's more contemporary country sound.
  
In 2007, KYGO-FM was named "Country Music Station of the Year" in a top 25 market by ''[[Radio & Records]]'' magazine.  Other nominees included [[WUSN]] [[Chicago]], [[WYCD]] [[Detroit]], [[KEEY-FM]] [[Minneapolis]], [[WXTU]] [[Philadelphia]], and [[KSON-FM]] [[San Diego]].<ref name='randrawards'>{{cite news|title=2007 Industry Achievement Awards |date=September 28, 2008 |url=http://www.radioandrecords.com/Conventions/con2007/awards/indexFinal.asp |work=Radio and Records |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511170136/http://www.radioandrecords.com/Conventions/con2007/awards/indexFinal.asp |archivedate=May 11, 2008 }}</ref>

===Change in ownership===
On December 8, 2014, [[Entercom]] announced it would purchase [[Lincoln Financial Group]]'s entire 15-station lineup (including KYGO) in a $106.5 million deal.  It operated the outlets under a [[local marketing agreement]] (LMA).  On December 22, 2014, Entercom confirmed it would retain KYGO and its country format.<ref>[http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/91146/entercom-acquires-lincoln-financial-media/#comment-19809 "Entercom Acquires Lincoln Financial Media"] from Radio Insight (December 8, 2014)</ref> The FCC approved the deal on June 26, 2015.<ref>[http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/142887/fcc-oks-lincoln-financial-entercom-deal "FCC OKs Lincoln Financial-Entercom Deal"] from All Access (June 26, 2015)</ref>

However, on July 14, 2015, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] ruled that Entercom had too many stations in the Denver market.  Entercom decided to spin off KYGO, [[KOSI-FM|KOSI]], [[KKFN]] and [[KEPN]] to [[Bonneville International]] in exchange for Bonneville's [[Los Angeles]] station KSWD (now [[KKLQ (FM)|KKLQ]]) to meet ownership limits. Both Bonneville and Entercom began operating their new clusters via Time Brokerage Agreements on July 17, 2015.  The transaction was consummated on November 24, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/93470/fcc-approves-entercom-acquisition-of-lincoln-financial-media/|title=Entercom Settles DOJ Investigation; Swaps For 100.3 The Sound Los Angeles|date=16 July 2015|publisher=}}</ref>

=== Taylor Swift incident ===
KYGO hired David Mueller as a [[disc jockey|DJ]] in January 2013.<ref name=Timeline /> Mueller co-hosted the ''Ryno and Jackson'' morning show.<ref name=Before>{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/08/10/taylor-swift-trial-david-mueller-job/|title=Before alleged Taylor Swift groping, radio host David Mueller’s bosses were unsatisfied with his work|last=McGhee|first=Tom|work=[[Denver Post]]|date=11 August 2017|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> On June 2, 2013, Mueller attended a meet-and-greet event before a [[Taylor Swift]] concert at the [[Pepsi Center]]. While having her photograph taken with Mueller, Swift alleged that he reached under her skirt and groped her. Though Mueller denied touching Swift inappropriately, KYGO-FM General Manager Robert Call fired him on June 4.

Mueller sued Swift in September 2015 for loss of income, alleging that her allegation had led to his wrongful termination.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/12/entertainment/taylor-swift-lawsuit/index.html|title=Colorado DJ sues Taylor Swift over accusation |first=Mayra |last=Cuevas|work=CNN|access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref> Swift sued Mueller the next month.
