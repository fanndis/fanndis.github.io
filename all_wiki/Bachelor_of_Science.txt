A '''Bachelor of Science''' ('''BS''', '''BSc''', '''SB''', or '''ScB'''; from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|baccalaureus scientiae}}'' or ''{{lang|la|scientiae baccalaureus}}'')<ref>{{cite web |title=Degree Abbreviations |url=http://www.harvard.edu/degree-abbreviations |website=Harvard University |accessdate=27 June 2014 }}</ref> is a [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for programs that generally last three to five years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bachelor|title=bachelor &#124; Definition of bachelor in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries &#124; English|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref> 

The first university to admit a student to the degree of Bachelor of Science was the [[University of London]] in 1860.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOd3N6291CQC&pg=PA5|title=The University of London, 1858–1900: The Politics of Senate and Convocation|author=Francis Michael Glenn Willson|date=2004|publisher=Boydell Press|page=5|isbn=9781843830658}}</ref>

Whether Bachelor of Science or [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees are awarded in particular subjects varies between universities. For example, an economics student may graduate as a Bachelor of Arts in one university but as a Bachelor of Science in another, and occasionally, both options are offered.<ref>E.g., West Virginia University BS in Economics http://www.be.wvu.edu/econ/index.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024220036/http://www.be.wvu.edu/econ/index.htm |date=2016-10-24 }} ; WVU BA in economics http://majors.wvu.edu/home/details/26</ref> Some universities follow the Oxford and Cambridge tradition that even graduates in math and the sciences become Bachelors of Arts,<ref>E.g., Wesleyan University http://www.wesleyan.edu/registrar/academic_regulations/degree_requirements.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704065440/http://www.wesleyan.edu/registrar/academic_regulations/degree_requirements.html|date=2015-07-04}}</ref> while other institutions offer only the Bachelor of Science degree, even in [[non-science]] fields.<ref>E.g., Georgia Institute of Technology's BS degrees in International Affairs and Modern Languages and in Applied Languages and Intercultural studies http://www.gatech.edu/academics/bachelors-degree-programs</ref>

At universities that offer both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in the same [[Academic discipline|discipline]], the Bachelor of Science degree is usually more focused on that particular discipline and is targeted toward students intending to pursue [[graduate school]] or a profession in that discipline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://math.uiowa.edu/undergraduate-program/majors-minor|title=Majors & Minor &#124; Department of Mathematics &#124; College of Liberal Arts & Sciences &#124; The University of Iowa|website=math.uiowa.edu|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.phys.ufl.edu/wp/index.php/undergraduate/degrees-offered/</ref>

==International differences==
{{More citations needed section|date=January 2020}}

[[Georgetown University]]'s [[School of Foreign Service]] awards Bachelor of Science degrees in Foreign Service to all of its undergraduates, although many students major in humanities-oriented fields such as international history or culture and politics. The [[London School of Economics]] offers BSc degrees in practically all subject areas, even those normally associated with the arts, while the [[Oxbridge]] universities almost exclusively award the BA as a first degree. In both instances, there are historical and traditional reasons. [[Northwestern University]]'s [[Northwestern University School of Communication|School of Communication]] grants BSc degrees in all of its programs of study, including theater, dance, and radio/television/film. [[University of California, Berkeley]] grants a BS degree in Environmental Economics and Policy at the [[UC Berkeley College of Natural Resources|College of Natural Resources]] (CNR), a BS degree in Business Administration at [[Haas School of Business]], and a BA degree in Environmental Economics and Policy at the [[UC Berkeley College of Letters and Science|College of Letters and Science]] (L&S). [[Cornell University]] offers a BS degree in Computer Science from its [[Cornell University College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] and a BA degree in Computer Science from its [[Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]].

=== Argentina ===
In [[Argentina]] most university degrees are given as a license in a discipline. They are specific to a field and awarded to students upon completion of a course of study which usually lasts five years. 
In most cases, at the end of a course and as a mandatory condition for its completion (and ultimately, to obtain a degree), students are compelled to work on an original research project related to their field. This project is called a [[thesis]] and is usually presented in front of a group of people, including university professors who will evaluate it and let the student know whether they passed or not on the same day, shortly after the presentation.

===Australia, New Zealand and South Africa===

In Australia, the BSc is generally a three to four-year degree. An honours year or a Master of Science (MSc) degree is required to progress on to the stage of [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD).

In New Zealand, in some cases, the [[honours degree]] comprises an additional [[postgraduate]] qualification. In other cases, students with strong performance in their second or third year, are invited to extend their degree to an additional year, with a focus on research, granting access to doctoral programs.

In South Africa, the BSc is taken over three years, while the postgraduate BSc (Hons) entails an additional year of study. Admission to the honours degree is on the basis of a sufficiently high average in the BSc major; an honours degree is required for MSc level study, and admission to a doctorate is via the MSc.

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], a Bachelor of Science degree is an undergraduate academic degree and is equivalent to a BSc (Hons). It could take from 4 to 6 years (8 to 12 periods) to complete, is also more specific and could be applied for Scientific Arts courses (like Engineering, Maths, Physics, etc.), somewhat is called Human Art courses in Brazil (like History, Portuguese and Literature and Lawyer studies for example) as well as for Health Arts (like Medicine, Nursery, Zootechnique, Veterinary and Biology for example). To be able to start the bachelor's degree in Brazil the candidate must prove to be proficient in different disciplines and have at least the accumulated Preliminary, Medium and High School degrees accomplished with the minimum merit of 60% to 70% of the degrees and a correspondent study period that can vary from 10 to 12 years minimum. The Bachelor of Science courses in Brazilian Universities normally have the first 1 to 2 years (first 2 to 4 periods) of basic fundamental disciplines (like for example Calculus I, II, III and IV for some engineering courses, Geometry basics and advanced, Analytical Laboratories experiments in Mechanics, Optics, Magnetism, etc.) and the last 2 to 3 years disciplines more related to the professional fields of that Bachelor of Science (for example Units Operations, Thermodynamics, Chemical Reactors, Industrial Processes, Kinetics for Chemical Engineering for example). Some disciplines are prerequisite to others and in some universities, the student is not allowed to course any discipline for the entire next period if he was unsuccessful in just one prerequisite discipline of the present period. Usually, the Bachelor of Science courses demand a one-year mandatory probation period by the end of the course (internship in the specific professional area, like a training period), followed by relatively elaborate written and oral evaluations. To get the certification as BSc, most universities require that the students achieve the accomplishment of 60% to 70% in all the "obligatory disciplines", plus the supervisioned and approved training period (like a supervisioned internship period), the final thesis of the course, and in some BSc programs, the final exam test. The final exam also is required so far. To be a professor, a Bachelor of Sciences is required to get a Licenciature degree, which lasts on top of the periods already studied until getting the BSc (Hons), plus 2 to 3 periods (1 to 1.5 years). With a master's degree (MSc) is also possible, which takes 3 to 5 periods more (1.5 to 2.5 years more).

===Britain and Ireland===
Commonly in [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] countries and Ireland [[wiktionary:graduands|graduands]] are admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Science after having completed a programme in one or more of the sciences. These programmes may take different lengths of time to complete.

A Bachelor of Science receives the designation BSc for an ordinary degree and BSc (Hons) for an [[honours degree]]. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland an honours degree is typically completed over a three-year period, though there are a few intensified two-year courses (with less vacation time). Bachelor's degrees (without honours) were typically completed in two years for most of the twentieth century. In Scotland, where access to university is possible after one less year of secondary education, degree courses have a foundation year making the total course length four years.

In Ireland, the former BS was changed to BSc (Hons), which is awarded after four years. The BSc (Ord) is awarded after three years.<ref>Britain's Scientific and Technological Manpower by George Louis Payne</ref> Formerly at the [[University of Oxford]], the degree of BSc was a postgraduate degree; this former degree, still actively granted, has since been renamed MSc.

===Chile===
In [[Chile]], the completion of a university program leads to an academic degree as well as a professional title. The academic degree equivalent to Bachelor of Science is "''Licenciado en Ciencias''", which can be obtained as a result of completing a 4–6 year program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inf.utfsm.cl/~contrera/competencias/documentos/Estudio_ingenieria.pdf|title=ESTUDIO SOBRE LA OFERTA DE CARRERAS DE INGENIERÍA EN CHILE|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> However, in most cases, 4-year programs will grant a [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] (Spanish: ''"Licenciatura en Ciencias Aplicadas"'') degree, while other 4-year programs will not grant to an academic degree.

===Continental Europe===
Many universities in Europe are changing their systems into the BA/MA system and in doing so also offering the full equivalent of a BSc or MSc (see [[Bologna Process]]).

===Czech Republic===
Universities in the Czech Republic are changing their systems into the Bachelor of Science/Master of Science system and in doing so also offering the full equivalent of a BSc (Bc.) or MSc (Mgr./Ing.).

===Germany===
In Germany, there are two kinds of universities: ''Universitäten'' and ''Fachhochschulen'' (which are also called University of Applied Sciences). ''Universitäten'' and ''Fachhochschulen''&nbsp;– both also called ''Hochschulen'' - are legally equal, but ''Fachhochschulen'' have the reputation of being more related to practice and have no legal right to offer PhD programmes.

The BSc in Germany is equivalent to the BSc(Hons) in the United Kingdom. Many universities in German-speaking countries are changing their systems to the BA/MA system and in doing so also offering the full equivalent of a BSc.

In Germany the BA normally lasts between three and four years (six to eight semesters) and between 180 and 240 [[ECTS-credits|ECTS]] must be earned.

===India===
The Indian interpretation is similar to the British system. In India, B.Sc is generally a three-year course, however at some places, it is integrated with another short term course, certification or 'honours', making it a four-year course.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bachelorsportal.com/countries/degrees/538640397/bachelor-of-science-in-india.html|title=34 Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) Bachelor's degrees in India - BachelorsPortal.com|website=www.bachelorsportal.com}}</ref> After passing the 12th standard (of 10+2 system in India, junior college in US), also known as 'intermediate' in Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and/or Biology) from a recognized board (central board or state board) school, a student can apply to a college for a B.Sc degree. It is an undergraduate course, which could either be offered in annual examination system (3 years) or semester system (6 semesters, odd semester typically lasts from July/August to December, and even semester typically lasts from January to May). All the major colleges and universities offer this course.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collegedunia.com/courses/bsc|title=Top B.Sc Courses In 2019 &#124; Science Courses After Class 12th|website=collegedunia.com}}</ref>
After getting a B.Sc. Degree, the students can choose to either continue their education and pursue post-graduation (M.Sc.), or leave the college and take up a relevant job.

===North America===
In Canada, Mexico, and the United States, it is generally a four-year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nspe.org/resources/pdfs/blog/ASEE-Credit-Data1998-2010Summary.pdf|title=PE|last=Strickland|first=Jodie|work=Required Credits: Civil, Environmental, Chemical, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering As Reported on the American Society for Engineering Education Website|publisher=NSPE|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110115739/http://www.nspe.org/resources/pdfs/blog/ASEE-Credit-Data1998-2010Summary.pdf|archivedate=2011-11-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[undergraduate degree]] typically used in [[engineering]], [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[economics]], [[finance]], [[business]], and the [[natural sciences]].

Some colleges and universities however only require three years especially in [[Quebec]] and to a less extent in other areas.
