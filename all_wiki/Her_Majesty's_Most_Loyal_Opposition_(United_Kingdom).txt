'''Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition''', or the '''Official Opposition''', in the [[United Kingdom]] is led by the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]].  This is usually the [[political party]] with the second-largest number of seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], as the largest party will usually form [[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government]]. Since [[2010 United Kingdom general election|May 2010]], the Official Opposition has been the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led by [[Sir Keir Starmer|Keir Starmer]] since 2020.

==Origins==
The phrase ''His Majesty's Opposition'' was coined in 1826, before the advent of the modern [[two-party system]], when Parliament consisted more of interests, relationships and factions rather than the highly coherent political parties of today (although the [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]] and [[British Tory Party|Tories]] were the two main parties). The phrase was originally coined in jest; in attacking [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[George Canning]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]],{{sfn|Kleinig (2014)}} [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|John Hobhouse]] said jokingly, "It is said to be hard on His Majesty's Ministers to raise objections of this character but it is more hard on His Majesty's Opposition to compel them to take this course."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/3t945q81n?locale=en#toc|title=His Majesty's Opposition, 1714-1830|last=Foord|first=Archibald S|publisher=Oxford: Clarendon Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hansard|title=Salary To The President Of The Board Of Trade|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1826-04-10/debates/dacf0765-a1d5-4850-8ad3-5d147eb2ab81/SalaryToThePresidentOfTheBoardOfTrade|house=House of Commons|date=10 April 1826|column=135|speaker=[[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|John Hobhouse]]|volume=15}}</ref>

==Opposition days==
Whilst most days in the House of Commons are set aside for government business, twenty days in each [[Parliamentary session|session]] are set aside for opposition debates.  Of these days, seventeen are at the disposal of the [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]] and three can be used by the leader of the smaller, or Tertiary, opposition party (for most recent history this has been the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], but since the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 General Election]] has been the [[Scottish National Party]]).<ref name="Parlnote1">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090618162621/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-03910.pdf Standard Note:SN/PC/3910] UK Parliament, 8 February 2006, accessed 5 May 2010 {{dead link|date=April 2017}}</ref>

Although the Opposition has no more formal powers in setting the Parliamentary agenda, in reality they have a certain influence through a process known as the [[usual channels]].<ref name="Parlnote1"/>

==Leader of the Opposition==
{{Main|Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)}}

The Leader of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition is often seen as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]-in-waiting; as well as his salary as an MP, he or she receives a statutory salary and perquisites like those of a [[cabinet minister]], including appointment as a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]].  Since 1915, the Leader of the Opposition has, like the Prime Minister, always been a member of the House of Commons.  Before that a member of the House of Lords sometimes took on the role, although often there was no overall Leader of the Opposition.

Although there has never been a dispute as to who holds the position, under the Ministerial and other Salaries Act 1975, the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker’s]] decision on the identity of the Leader of the Opposition is final.<ref name="Parlnote1"/>

As of 4 April 2020, the current Leader of the Opposition is Sir [[Keir Starmer]] who is also Leader of the Labour Party. He was elected on 2 April 2020 replacing [[Jeremy Corbyn]] who had been the leader since 2015.

==Ministers' Questions==
===Prime Minister's Questions===
{{Main|Prime Minister's Questions}}

The most public parliamentary function of the Leader of the Opposition is Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs), currently a 30-minute session held on Wednesday at noon when Parliament is sitting. The Leader of the Opposition has six questions, which they sometimes split into two sets. [[backbencher|Backbench]] opposition MPs and [[Official Opposition frontbench|frontbench]] opposition MPs that are not in the Shadow Cabinet also have the right to question the Prime Minister; they are selected either through a ballot, or by "catching the Speaker's eye".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/catching-the-speakers-eye/|title=Catching the Speaker's eye|website=www.parliament.uk|access-date=14 June 2017}}</ref> By convention, other [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] members do not question the Prime Minister at PMQs, except when standing in for the Leader.

===Questions to other ministers===
Every government department is subjected to questions in the House of Commons and the [[House of Lords]]. As with PMQs, the official opposition spokespersons are allocated a number of questions, and in addition backbench MPs are free to ask questions.  In the House of Lords, opposition spokespersons also question the government.  This is one of the reasons why every government department has at least one Member of Parliament and one [[peerage|peer]] in it.

==Seating==
As is usual with [[Westminster system]]s, and other statutory assemblies and councils in the UK, the government and its supporters sit to the Speaker's right, whilst the opposition parties sit to their left.{{sfn|''BBC News''|2008}} Currently, members from the Conservative Party sit to the Speaker's right, and members from the Labour Party sit on the main left bench, which is where the main opposition party sits. The second main opposition bench is where the third largest party sits, in this case the [[Scottish National Party]]. The back of this bench is where other minor parties sit, such as [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|the Liberal Democrats]], [[Democratic Unionist Party|the DUP]], [[Plaid Cymru]], [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]], [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance]], [[Green Party of England and Wales|the Greens]] and one [[Independent politician|Independent]].
