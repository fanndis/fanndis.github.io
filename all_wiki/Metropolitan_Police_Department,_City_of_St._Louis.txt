==Departmental History==

The Metropolitan Police Department was established in 1808, five years after St. Louis became part of the United States. The department was created with only four officers, who received no pay. Able-bodied men age 18 and older were required to patrol for four months of the year. This was the only police system for the next 10 years. Refusal to serve on patrol carried a fine of $1.<ref>{{cite web|title=Department History|website=SLMPD.org|url=http://www.slmpd.org/images/Updated%20History%20for%20Website.pdf}}</ref>

In 2013, CALEA recognized the Metropolitan Police Department with it distinguished Tri-Arc Award.

The '''Force Investigative Unit''' (FIU) was established in September 2014 as the entity responsible for

The FIU investigates all officer-involved shootings occurring within the City of St. Louis involving commissioned officers of the Metropolitan Police Department, as well as commissioned officers of any other jurisdiction. Before the initiation of the FIU, the department researched and visited several other police departments to ensure the best policies and practices were implemented. The FIU consists of a lieutenant and four detectives dedicated solely to investigating officer-involved shootings. The team responses directly to the scene of each incident, allowing detectives to conduct a thorough investigation of the case. Under the new policies, once the FIU's investigation concludes, the case is then turned over to the Circuit Attorney's Office for review.<ref>{{cite web|title=Department Force Investigative Unit|website=SLMPD.org|url=http://www.slmpd.org/images/2014AnnualReport_D.pdf}}</ref>
