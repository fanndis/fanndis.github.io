'''Catherine of Aragon''' ({{Lang-es|Catalina}}; 16 December 1485&nbsp;– 7 January 1536) was [[List of English consorts|Queen of England]] from June 1509 until May 1533 as the [[Wives of Henry VIII|first wife]] of [[King Henry VIII]]; she was previously [[Princess of Wales]] as the wife of Henry's elder brother, [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]].

The daughter of [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], Catherine was three years old when she was betrothed to [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], [[heir apparent]] to the English throne. They married in 1501, but Arthur died five months later. She held the position of ambassador of the Aragonese Crown to England in 1507, the first known female ambassador in European history.{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=59}} Catherine subsequently married Arthur's younger brother, the recently ascended Henry VIII, in 1509. For six months in 1513, she served as [[regent]] of England while Henry&nbsp;VIII was in France. During that time the English crushed and defeated the Scottish at the [[Battle of Flodden]], an event in which Catherine played an important part with an emotional speech about English courage.{{sfn|Catherine of Aragon, Queen of England}}

By 1525, Henry VIII was infatuated with [[Anne Boleyn]] and dissatisfied that his marriage to Catherine had produced no surviving sons, leaving their daughter, the future [[Mary&nbsp;I of England]], as [[heir presumptive]] at a time when there was no established precedent for a woman on the throne. He sought to have their marriage [[Annulment|annulled]], setting in motion a chain of events that led to England's schism with the Catholic Church. When [[Pope Clement&nbsp;VII]] refused to annul the marriage, Henry defied him by [[Acts of Supremacy|assuming supremacy]] over religious matters. In 1533 their marriage was consequently declared invalid and Henry married Anne on the judgement of clergy in England, without reference to the Pope. Catherine refused to accept Henry as Supreme Head of the Church in England and considered herself the King's rightful wife and queen, attracting much popular sympathy.{{sfn|Catherine of Aragon (1485–1536)}} Despite this, she was acknowledged only as Dowager Princess of Wales by Henry. After being banished from court by Henry, she lived out the remainder of her life at [[Kimbolton Castle]], and died there on 7 January 1536 of cancer. The English people held Catherine in high esteem, and her death set off tremendous mourning.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=295}}

''[[The Education of a Christian Woman]]'' by [[Juan Luis Vives]], controversial at its release for promoting that women have the right to an education, was commissioned by and dedicated to her in 1523. Such was Catherine's impression on people that even her enemy, [[Thomas Cromwell]], said of her, "If not for her sex, she could have defied all the heroes of History."{{sfn|Chapuys|1533|p=737}} She successfully appealed for the lives of the rebels involved in the [[Evil May Day]], for the sake of their families.{{sfn|Deutscher & Bietenholz|1987|p=283}} Catherine also won widespread admiration by starting an extensive programme for the relief of the poor.{{sfn|Catherine of Aragon Biography}}{{sfn|Deutscher & Bietenholz|1987|p=283}} She was a patron of [[Renaissance humanism]], and a friend of the great scholars [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Thomas More]].{{sfn|Catherine of Aragon Biography}}

==Early life==
[[File:Juan de Flandes 002.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Juan de Flandes]] thought to be of 11-year-old Catherine. She resembles her sister [[Joanna of Castile]].]]
Catherine was born at the [[Archbishop's Palace of Alcalá de Henares]] near Madrid, on the night of 16 December 1485. She was the youngest surviving child of King [[Ferdinand&nbsp;II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella&nbsp;I of Castile]].{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=283}} Catherine was quite short in stature{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=24}} with long red hair, wide blue eyes, a round face, and a fair complexion.{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=15}} She was descended, on her maternal side, from the [[House of Lancaster]], an English royal house; her great-grandmother [[Catherine of Lancaster]], after whom she was named, and her great-great-grandmother [[Philippa of Lancaster]] were both daughters of [[John of Gaunt]] and granddaughters of [[Edward&nbsp;III of England]]. Consequently, she was third cousin of her father-in-law, [[Henry VII of England]],{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=284}} and fourth cousin of her mother-in-law [[Elizabeth of York]].

Catherine was educated by a tutor, [[Alessandro Geraldini]], who was a clerk in Holy Orders. She studied arithmetic, canon and civil law, classical literature, genealogy and heraldry, history, philosophy, religion, and theology.  She had a strong religious upbringing and developed her Roman Catholic faith that would play a major role in later life.{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=12}} She learned to speak, read and write in Spanish and Latin, and spoke French and Greek. She was also taught domestic skills, such as cooking, dancing, drawing, embroidery, good manners, lace-making, music, needlepoint, sewing, spinning, and weaving.{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=20}} Scholar [[Erasmus]] later said that Catherine "loved good literature which she had studied with success since childhood".{{sfn|Dowling|1986|p=17}}

At an early age, Catherine was considered a suitable wife for [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], heir apparent to the English throne, due to the English ancestry she inherited from her mother. By means of her mother, Catherine had a stronger legitimate claim to the English throne than King Henry VII himself through the first two wives of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]]: [[Blanche of Lancaster]] and [[Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster|Constance of Castile]]. In contrast, Henry VII was the descendant of Gaunt's third marriage to [[Katherine Swynford]], whose children were born out of wedlock and only legitimised after the death of Constance and the marriage of John to Katherine. The children of John and Katherine, while legitimised, were barred from inheriting the English throne, a stricture that was ignored in later generations. Because of Henry's descent through illegitimate children barred from succession to the English throne, the Tudor monarchy was not accepted by all European kingdoms. At the time, the [[House of Trastámara]] was the most prestigious in Europe,{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=284}} due to the rule of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], so the alliance of Catherine and Arthur validated the House of Tudor in the eyes of European royalty and strengthened the Tudor claim to the English throne via Catherine of Aragon's ancestry. It would have given a male heir an indisputable claim to the throne. The two were [[married by proxy]] on 19 May 1499 and corresponded in Latin until Arthur turned fifteen, when it was decided that they were old enough to be married.{{sfn|Sanders & Low|1910|p=235}}

Catherine was accompanied to England by the ambassadors [[Diego Fernández de Córdoba y Mendoza]], 3rd Count of Cabra, [[Alonso de Fonseca y Acevedo|Alonso de Fonseca]], archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, and [[Antonio de Rojas Manrique]], bishop of Mallorca.<ref>{{citation |url=http://dbe.rah.es/biografias/22792/diego-fernandez-de-cordoba-y-mendoza |access-date=11 August 2019 |language=es |last=Molina Recio |first=Raúl |title=Diego Fernández de Córdoba y Mendoza |publisher=Real Academia de la Historia |year=2018}}</ref>
She brought a group of her African attendants with her, including one identified as the trumpeter [[John Blanke]].{{sfn|John Blanke}} They are the first Africans recorded to have arrived in London at the time, and were considered luxury servants. They caused a great impression about the princess and the power of her family.{{sfn|Goodwin|2008|p=166}} Her Spanish retinue was supervised by her [[duenna]], [[Elvira Manuel]].

==As wife and widow of Arthur==

Then-15-year-old Catherine departed from [[A Coruña]] on 17 August 1501 and met Arthur on 4 November at [[Dogmersfield]] in Hampshire.{{sfn|Starkey|2003|pp=45–46}}{{sfn|Tremlett|2010|p=73}}{{sfn|Cahill Marrón|2012|}} Little is known about their first impressions of each other, but Arthur did write to his parents-in-law that he would be "a true and loving husband" and told his parents that he was immensely happy to "behold the face of his lovely bride". The couple had corresponded in Latin, but found that they could not understand each other's spoken conversation, because they had learned different Latin pronunciations.{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=25}} Ten days later, on 14 November 1501, they were married at [[Old St. Paul's Cathedral]].{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=284}} A dowry of 200,000 ducats had been agreed, and half was paid shortly after the marriage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyonthenet.com/Chronology/timelinecatherine.htm |title=Catherine of Aragon Timeline |publisher=Historyonthenet.com |date=15 October 2010 |access-date=16 September 2013}}</ref>

Once married, Arthur was sent to [[Ludlow Castle]] on the borders of Wales to preside over the [[Council of Wales and the Marches]], as was his duty as Prince of Wales, and his bride accompanied him. The couple stayed at [[Castle Lodge, Ludlow]]. A few months later, they both became ill, possibly with the [[sweating sickness]], which was sweeping the area. Arthur died on 2 April 1502; 16-year-old Catherine recovered to find herself a widow.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=285}}

At this point, Henry VII faced the challenge of avoiding the obligation to return her 200,000 [[ducat]] dowry, half of which he had not yet received, to her father, as required by her marriage contract should she return home.<ref>{{cite book|author=Maria Elizabeth Budden|title=True Stories from English History. Chronologically Arranged from the Invasion of the Romans to the Present Time.

Madison Davis|title=The Shakespeare Name and Place Dictionary|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=T0rcp9hNj28C}}|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-64035-3|page=266}}</ref> To settle the matter, it was agreed that Catherine would marry Henry VII's second son, Henry, Duke of York, who was five years younger than she was. The death of Catherine's mother, however, meant that her "value" in the marriage market decreased. Castile was a much larger kingdom than Aragon, and it was inherited by Catherine's elder sister, [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]]. Ostensibly, the marriage was delayed until Henry was old enough, but Ferdinand II procrastinated so much over payment of the remainder of Catherine's dowry that it became doubtful that the marriage would take place. She lived as a virtual prisoner at [[Durham House (London)|Durham House]] in London.{{sfn|Williams|1971|p=15}} Some of the letters she wrote to her father complaining of her treatment have survived. In one of these letters she tells him that "I choose what I believe, and say nothing. For I am not as simple as I may seem." She had little money and struggled to cope, as she had to support her ladies-in-waiting as well as herself. In 1507 she served as the Spanish [[ambassador]] to England, the first female ambassador in European history.{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=59}} While Henry VII and his councillors expected her to be easily manipulated, Catherine went on to prove them wrong.{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=59}}

Marriage to Arthur's brother depended on the Pope granting a [[Papal dispensation|dispensation]] because [[canon law]] forbade a man to [[Affinity (canon law)|marry his brother's widow]] ([[Leviticus 18|Lev. 18]]:16{{efn|[[Canon law]] took this verse out of context,{{cn|date=March 2020}} and [[Deuteronomy 25]]:5–10 required [[levirate marriage]].}}). Catherine testified that her marriage to Arthur was never [[Consummation|consummated]] as, also according to canon law, a marriage was dissoluble unless consummated.{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=34}}{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=290}}

==Queenship==

===Wedding===
Catherine's second wedding took place on 11 June 1509,{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=287}} seven years after Prince Arthur's death. She married [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], who had only just acceded to the throne, in a private ceremony in the church of the Observant Friars outside [[Palace of Placentia|Greenwich Palace]]. She was 23 years of age.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=287}}{{sfn|Eagles|2002|p=194}}

===Coronation===
On Saturday 23 June 1509, the traditional eve-of-coronation procession to Westminster was greeted by a large and enthusiastic crowd. As was the custom, the couple spent the night before their [[coronation]] at the [[Tower of London]]. On Midsummer's Day, Sunday, {{Nowrap|24 June}} 1509, Henry VIII and Catherine were [[Anointing|anointed]] and [[coronation|crowned]] together by the Archbishop of Canterbury at a lavish ceremony at [[Westminster Abbey]]. The coronation was followed by a banquet in [[Westminster Hall]]. Many new [[Knights of the Bath]] were created in honour of the coronation.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=287}}
In that month that followed, many social occasions presented the new Queen to the English public. She made a fine impression and was well received by the people of [[England]].{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=285}}

===Pregnancies and children===
[[File:Catharineofaragonengland.jpg|thumb|Catherine watching Henry jousting in her honour after giving birth to a son. Henry's horse mantle is emblazoned with Catherine's initial letter, 'K.']]
Catherine was pregnant six times altogether:<ref>{{cite journal|at=p. 52–53|pmc = 1139382|year = 1984|last1 = Dewhurst|first1 = J.|title = The alleged miscarriages of Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn|journal = Medical History|volume = 28|issue = 1|doi = 10.1017/s0025727300035316|pmid = 6387336}}</ref>
* In August 1509, two months after the wedding, Catherine's first pregnancy was announced. On 31 January 1510, she delivered a stillborn girl. According to David Starkey in his docu-drama, ''The Six Wives of Henry VIII (2001)'', Catherine miscarried at five months gestation, was told she was pregnant with twins and the other child still lived, and went into confinement only for the swelling of her belly, probably an "infection", to recede, revealing she was, in fact, ''not'' still pregnant.
* In May 1510, four months after the loss of her first child, Catherine announced her second pregnancy. A son, [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], was born on 1 January 1511. In his honour, guns were fired from the Tower of London and the city bells were rung, beacons were lit and free wine was distributed to all the population. Five days after his birth, on 6 January 1511, the prince was christened at Richmond Palace, his godparents being the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Earl of Surrey and the Countess of Devon. On 22 February 1511, after only 52 days of life, the young prince died suddenly.
* By early 1513, Catherine was pregnant again.{{sfn|Rymer|1741|p=48}} On 30 June 1513, Catherine, at approximately five months gestation, was left as regent in England when Henry VIII went to fight in France. On 17 September 1513, she went into labour prematurely and gave birth to a boy who died shortly after birth.<ref>According to ''Calendar of state papers and manuscripts relating to English affairs existing in the archives and collections of Venice (CSP Venice), edited by Rawdon Brown, vol. II, item 329, p. 140'', the Spanish Ambassador - at the time Ambassador Mendoza - wrote that "a male heir was born to the King of England and will inherit the Crown, the other son having died.", which suggests the child was born alive.</ref> According to David Starkey in his docu-drama, ''The Six Wives of Henry VIII (2001)'', Catherine did ''not'' miscarry the child until after Henry's return in October 1513.
* In June 1514, Catherine announced her fourth pregnancy. In November 1514, she gave birth to a short lived boy.<ref>According to Dewhurst, the Venetian ambassador wrote to his senate in November that “The Queen has been delivered of a stillborn male child of eight months to the very great grief of the whole court”, Holinshed, the chronicler,  reported that “in November the Queen was delivered of a prince which lived not long after”, and John Stow wrote “in the meantime, to Whit, the month of November, the Q was delivered of a prince which lived not long after”.</ref>
* In the summer of 1515, Catherine announced her fifth pregnancy; however, less hope was placed on an heir following her previous failed pregnancies. On 18 February 1516, Catherine delivered a healthy girl at 4 a.m. at Greenwich Palace, Kent.{{sfn|Eagles|2002|p=195}} She was named [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and christened three days later (21 February) with great ceremony at the Church of [[Franciscan|Observant Friars]]. Despite his evident disappointment, Henry VIII said that if it were a girl this time then surely boys would follow.
* In July 1518, Catherine announced her sixth and final pregnancy,<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139382/?page=5 The alleged miscarriages of Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn: Page 52 and 53 by Sir John Dewhurst]: Her sixth and last confinement was announced by Henry in a personal letter to Cardinal Wolsey on 1 July 1518: "Two things there be which so secret that they cause me at this time to write to you myself; the one is that I trust the Queen my wife to be with child."</ref> and she visited Merton College, Oxford, and also made a pilgrimage to the shrine of St Frideswide, asking for a healthy son. On 10 November 1518 she gave birth to a daughter at 8 months gestation, but the child was weak and lived only a few hours.

Various other children are suggested by other authors and historians; J. J. Scarisbrick in his book, (''Henry VIII'', 1968) suggests that Catherine had "several miscarriages, three infants who were either stillborn or died immediately after birth (two of them males), two infants who died within weeks of birth (one of them a boy) and one girl, Princess Mary", which amounts to a total of nine pregnancies, since "several miscarriages" can hardly be regarded as referring to less than three; Hester W. Chapman in her book (''Anne Boleyn'', 1974) gives the total of pregnancies as seven, with "one live child and six that ended either in miscarriages or stillbirths."; Neville Williams in his book (''Henry VIII and his court'', 1971) is imprecise about the number of pregnancies but notes that, as early as 1511, Henry was "mindful of prior miscarriages". Referring to 1517, A. F. Pollard in his book (''Henry VIII'', 1925) suggests that "it is probable that about this time the Queen had various miscarriages". Various, like several, can hardly refer to less than three. 

However, John Bowle (''Henry VIII'', 1964), rejects the 1517 miscarriages as "inventions" of Pollard and Sir John E. Neale agrees, describing the invention of the 1517 miscarriage as "mischievous". Both writers reject a son born in 1514, who was "no sooner christened than dead". Bowle, Chamberlain and Neale all agree as to six pregnancies for Catherine, ending with Mary in 1516, rejecting other pregnancies due to "insufficient evidence." Dewhurst rejects another miscarriage stated by Pollard in June 1514 as "impossible" due to Catherine being eight months pregnant in August<ref>{{cite journal|at=p. 52–53|pmc = 1139382|year = 1984|last1 = Dewhurst|first1 = J.|title = The alleged miscarriages of Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn|journal = Medical History|volume = 28|issue = 1|doi = 10.1017/s0025727300035316|pmid = 6387336}}</ref> - he too is partially incorrect however, as Catherine was already at eight months pregnant in September, something not possible if she was eight months pregnant a month earlier.

===Influence===
[[File:Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547) by English School.jpg|thumb|Henry VIII at the time of their marriage.]]

On 11 June 1513, Henry appointed Catherine Regent in England with the titles "Governor of the Realm and Captain General," while he went to France on a [[Battle of Guinegate (1513)|military campaign]].<ref>[[Thomas Rymer]], [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_puq9VL1_2O8C/page/n385/mode/2up ''Foedera'', vol. 13 (London, 1712), p. 370] Catherine was appointed "Rectrix" and "Gubernatrix" of England.</ref>
When [[Louis I d'Orléans, duc de Longueville|Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Longueville]], was captured at [[Battle of the Spurs|Thérouanne]], Henry sent him to stay in Catherine's household. She wrote to Wolsey that she and her council would prefer the Duke to stay in the [[Tower of London]] as the Scots were "so busy as they now be" and she added her prayers for "God to sende us as good lukke against the Scotts, as the King hath ther."{{sfn|Ellis|1846|p=152–154}} The war with Scotland occupied her subjects, and she was "horrible busy with making standards, banners, and badges" at [[Richmond Palace]]. The Scots invaded and on 3 September 1513, she ordered [[Thomas Lovell]] to raise an army in the midland counties.{{sfn|Rymer|1741|p=49}}<ref>Sean Cunningham, [https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/katherine-of-aragon-and-an-army-for-the-north-in-1513/ 'Katherine of Aragon and an army for the North in 1513', TNA Research]</ref>

Catherine rode north in full armour to address the troops, despite being heavily pregnant at the time.  Her fine speech was reported to the historian [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]] in [[Valladolid]] within a fortnight.<ref>Letters & Papers vol. 1 (London, 1920), no. 2299: Catherine was issued with banners at Richmond on 8 September, Letters & Papers, vol. 1 (London, 1920), no. 2243.</ref> Although an Italian newsletter said she was {{convert|100|mi}} north of London when news of the victory at [[Battle of Flodden Field]] reached her, she was near [[Buckingham]].<ref>''Letters & Papers Henry VIII'', vol. 1 (London, 1920) no. 2278: ''Calendar State Papers Venice'', vol. 2, no. 340: Hall, Edward, ''Chronicle'' (London, 1809), p. 564.</ref>  From [[Woburn Abbey]] she sent a letter to Henry along with a piece of the bloodied coat of King [[James IV of Scotland]], who died in the battle, for Henry to use as a banner at the siege of [[Tournai]].{{sfn|Ellis|1846|p=82–84, 88–89}}

Catherine's religious dedication increased as she became older, as did her interest in academics. She continued to broaden her knowledge and provide training for her daughter, Mary. Education among women became fashionable, partly because of Catherine's influence, and she donated large sums of money to several colleges. Henry, however, still considered a male heir essential. The [[Tudor dynasty]] was new, and its legitimacy might still be tested.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=288–289}} [[The Anarchy|A long civil war]] (1135–54) had been fought the last time a woman ([[Empress Matilda]]) had inherited the throne. The disasters of civil war were still fresh in living memory from the [[Wars of the Roses]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2009|p=70}}

In 1520, Catherine's nephew, the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]],{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=291}} paid a state visit to England, and she urged Henry to enter an alliance with Charles rather than with France. Immediately after his departure, she accompanied Henry to France on the celebrated visit to [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]]. Within two years, war was declared against France and the Emperor was once again welcome in England, where plans were afoot to betroth him to Catherine's daughter Mary.

==The King's great matter==
[[File:Catherine Aragon Henri VIII by Henry Nelson ONeil.jpg|thumb|left|''The Trial of Queen Catherine of Aragon'', by [[Henry Nelson O'Neil]] (1846–48, [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery|Birmingham Museums]])]]

In 1525, Henry VIII became enamoured of [[Anne Boleyn]], a lady-in-waiting to Queen Catherine; Anne was between ten and seventeen years younger than Henry, being born between 1501 and 1507. Henry began pursuing her;{{sfn|Scarisbrick|1997|p=154}} Catherine was no longer able to bear children by this time. Henry began to believe that his marriage was cursed and sought confirmation from the Bible, which he interpreted to say that if a man marries his brother's wife, the couple will be childless.<ref>Leviticus 20:21.</ref>{{sfn|Catherine of Aragon Biography}} Even if her marriage to Arthur had not been consummated (and Catherine would insist to her dying day that she had come to Henry's bed a virgin), Henry's interpretation of that biblical passage meant that their marriage had been wrong in the eyes of God.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=290}} Whether the pope at the time of Henry and Catherine's marriage had the right to overrule Henry's claimed scriptural impediment would become a hot topic in Henry's campaign to wrest an annulment from the present pope.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=290}} It is possible that the idea of annulment had been suggested to Henry much earlier than this, and is highly probable that it was motivated by his desire for a son. Before Henry's father ascended the throne, England was beset by [[Wars of the Roses|civil warfare]] over rival claims to the English crown, and Henry may have wanted to avoid a similar uncertainty over the succession.{{sfn|Lacey|1972|p=70}}

It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's desires to secure an annulment.{{sfn|Brigden|2000|p=114}} Catherine was defiant when it was suggested that she quietly retire to a nunnery, saying: "God never called me to a nunnery. I am the King's true and legitimate wife."{{sfn|Farquhar|2001|p=61}} He set his hopes upon an appeal to the [[Holy See]], acting independently of Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]], whom he told nothing of his plans. [[William Knight (bishop)|William Knight]], the King's secretary, was sent to [[Pope Clement VII]] to sue for an annulment, on the grounds that the dispensing [[papal bull|bull]] of [[Pope Julius II]] was obtained by false pretenses.

As the Pope was, at that time, the prisoner of Catherine's nephew [[Emperor Charles V]] following the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in May 1527, Knight had difficulty in obtaining access to him. In the end, Henry's envoy had to return without accomplishing much. Henry now had no choice but to put this great matter into the hands of Wolsey, who did all he could to secure a decision in Henry's favour.<ref name="cehen">{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Henry VIII}}</ref>
[[File:Mary I by Master John.jpg|thumb|Catherine and Henry's daughter Mary]]  Wolsey went so far as to convene an ecclesiastical court in England with a representative of the Pope presiding, and Henry and Catherine herself in attendance. The Pope had no intention of allowing a decision to be reached in England, and his legate was recalled. (How far the pope was influenced by Charles V is difficult to say, but it is clear Henry saw that the Pope was unlikely to annul his marriage to the Emperor's aunt.{{sfn|Morris|1998|p=166}}) The Pope forbade Henry to marry again before a decision was given in Rome. Wolsey had failed and was dismissed from public office in 1529. Wolsey then began a secret plot to have Anne Boleyn forced into exile and began communicating with the Pope to that end. When this was discovered, Henry ordered Wolsey's arrest and, had he not been [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] and died in 1530, he might have been executed for [[treason]].{{sfn|Haigh|1993|p=92}} A year later, Catherine was banished from court, and her old rooms were given to Anne Boleyn. Catherine wrote in a letter to Charles V in 1531:<blockquote>My tribulations are so great, my life so disturbed by the plans daily invented to further the King's wicked intention, the surprises which the King gives me, with certain persons of his council, are so mortal, and my treatment is what God knows, that it is enough to shorten ten lives, much more mine.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=FiXjKTkR0QYC|page=32}}|title=Jane Seymour: Henry VIII's True Love|last=Norton|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Amberly Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781848681026|location=Gloucestershire|pages=32}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=SS8skdljd44C|page=223}}|title=In Triumph's Wake: Royal Mothers, Tragic Daughters, and the Price They Paid for Glory|last=Gelardi|first=Julia P.|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2009|isbn=9781466823686|location=New York|author-link=Julia P.

When Henry decided to annul his marriage to Catherine, [[John Fisher]] became her most trusted counsellor and one of her chief supporters. He appeared in the legates' court on her behalf, where he shocked people with the directness of his language, and by declaring that, like [[John the Baptist]], he was ready to die on behalf of the indissolubility of marriage. Henry was so enraged by this that he wrote a long Latin address to the legates in answer to Fisher's speech. Fisher's copy of this still exists, with his manuscript annotations in the margin which show how little he feared Henry's anger. The removal of the cause to Rome ended Fisher's role in the matter, but Henry never forgave him.{{sfn|Jestice|2004|p=277}}{{sfn|Rex|2003|p=27}} Other people who supported Catherine's case included [[Thomas More]]; Henry's own sister [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France]] (though as a member of the Tudor family and of royal blood, she was safe from any punishment and execution, not to mention miles away in the country at Bradgate Park); [[María de Salinas]]; Holy Roman Emperor Charles V; [[Pope Paul III]]; and Protestant Reformers [[Martin Luther]]{{sfn|Brecht|1994|p=44}} and [[William Tyndale]].{{sfn|Rees|2006|p=77}} Despite his sister's disapproval and her support of Catherine, it seems that Mary's husband, Charles Brandon, and their three surviving children were never in danger from Henry's wrath like others were.

==Banishment and death==

Upon returning to [[Dover]] from a meeting with King [[Francis I of France]] in [[Calais]], Henry married Anne Boleyn in a secret ceremony.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=292}} Some sources speculate that Anne was already pregnant at the time (and Henry did not want to risk a son being born illegitimate) but others testify that Anne (who had seen her sister [[Mary Boleyn]] taken up as the king's mistress and summarily cast aside) refused to sleep with Henry until they were married. Henry defended the legality of their union by pointing out that Catherine had previously been married. If she and Arthur had consummated their marriage, Henry by canon law had the right to remarry.{{sfn|Starkey|2003|pp=462–464}} On 23 May 1533, Cranmer, sitting in judgement at a special court convened at [[Dunstable Priory]] to rule on the validity of Henry's marriage to Catherine, declared the marriage illegal, even though Catherine testified she and Arthur had never had physical relations. Cranmer ruled Henry and Anne's marriage valid five days later, on 28 May 1533.{{sfn|Williams|1971|p=124}}

Until the end of her life, Catherine would refer to herself as Henry's only lawful wedded wife and England's only rightful queen, and her servants continued to address her by that title. Henry refused her the right to any title but "[[Dowager]] Princess of Wales" in recognition of her position as his brother's widow.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=292}}

Catherine went to live at [[The More]] castle late in 1531.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=293}} After that she was successively moved to the Royal Palace of Hatfield, (May to September, 1532), [[Elsyng Palace]], Enfield (September 1532 to February 1533), [[Ampthill]] Castle (February to July, 1533) and [[Buckden Towers]] (July 1533 to May 1534). She was then finally transferred to [[Kimbolton Castle]] where, she confined herself to one room (which she left only to attend Mass), dressed only in the [[hair shirt]] of the Order of St. Francis, and fasted continuously.{{cn|date=March 2020}} While she was permitted to receive occasional visitors, she was forbidden to see her daughter Mary. They were also forbidden to communicate in writing, but sympathizers discreetly ferried letters between the two. Henry offered both mother and daughter better quarters and permission to see each other if they would acknowledge Anne Boleyn as the new queen. Both refused.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=293}}

In late December 1535, sensing her death was near, Catherine made her [[will (law)|will]], and wrote to her nephew, the Emperor Charles V, asking him to protect her daughter. It has been alleged that she then penned one final letter to Henry, her "most dear lord and husband":<ref>Sharon Turner, ''The History of England from the Earliest Period to the Death of Elizabeth'' (Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green,1828)</ref>
{{quotation|My most dear lord, king and husband,

The hour of my death now drawing on, the tender love I owe you forceth me, my case being such, to commend myself to you, and to put you in remembrance with a few words of the health and safeguard of your soul which you ought to prefer before all worldly matters, and before the care and pampering of your body, for the which you have cast me into many calamities and yourself into many troubles. For my part, I pardon you everything, and I wish to devoutly pray God that He will pardon you also. For the rest, I commend unto you our daughter Mary, beseeching you to be a good father unto her, as I have heretofore desired. I entreat you also, on behalf of my maids, to give them marriage portions, which is not much, they being but three. For all my other servants I solicit the wages due them, and a year more, lest they be unprovided for. Lastly, I make this vow, that mine eyes desire you above all things.<br />
Katharine the Quene.
}}

The authenticity of the letter itself has been questioned, but not Catherine's attitude in its wording, which has been reported with variations in different sources.<ref>[[Giles Tremlett]] 2010 in ''Catherine of Aragon, Henry VIII's Spanish Queen'' {{ISBN|978-0-571-23511-7}} p. 422.</ref>

Catherine died at [[Kimbolton Castle]] on {{Nowrap|7 January}} 1536.{{sfn|Eagles|2002|p=202}} The following day, news of her death reached the king. At the time there were rumours that she was poisoned,<ref>''Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII'', vol. X, no. 190.</ref><ref>''Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII'', vol. X, no. 59.</ref><ref>Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, vol. X, no. 230.</ref> possibly by [[Gregory di Casale]].<ref>Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, vol. X, no. 200.</ref> According to the chronicler [[Edward Hall]], Anne Boleyn wore yellow for the mourning, which has been interpreted in various ways; [[Polydore Vergil]] interpreted this to mean that Anne did not mourn.{{sfn|Warnicke|1991|p=187}} Chapuys reported that it was King Henry who decked himself in yellow, celebrating the news and making a great show of his and Anne's daughter, Elizabeth, to his courtiers.{{sfn|Warnicke|1991|p=188}} This was seen as distasteful and vulgar by many. Another theory is that the dressing in yellow was out of respect for Catherine as yellow was said to be the Spanish colour of mourning. Certainly, later in the day it is reported that Henry and Anne both individually and privately wept for her death. On the day of Catherine's funeral, Anne Boleyn [[miscarriage|miscarried]] a boy. Rumours then circulated that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry, or both. The rumours were born after the apparent discovery during her embalming that there was a black growth on her heart that might have been caused by poisoning.{{sfn|Lofts|1979|p=139}} Modern medical experts are in agreement that her heart's discolouration was due not to poisoning, but to [[heart cancer|cancer]], something which was not understood at the time.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=294}}

Catherine was buried in [[Peterborough Cathedral]] with the ceremony due to her position as a Dowager [[Princess of Wales]], and not a queen. Henry did not attend the funeral and forbade Mary to attend.{{sfn|Lehman|2011|p=294}}

[[File:Catherine of Aragon as Mary Magdalene. jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael Sittow]], ''[[Mary Magdalene]]'', probably using Catherine as model]]
Catherine was a member of the [[Third Order of Saint Francis]] and she was punctilious in her religious obligations in the Order, integrating without demur her necessary duties as queen with her personal piety. After her divorce, she was quoted "I would rather be a poor beggar’s wife and be sure of heaven, than queen of all the world and stand in doubt thereof by reason of my own consent."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bent|first1=Samuel Arthur|title=Familiar Short Sayings of Great Men|date=1887|publisher=Ticknor & Co.|location=Boston|edition=Sixth|url=http://bartleby.com/344/83.html|access-date=25 November 2014}}</ref>

The outward celebration of saints and holy [[relic]]s formed no major part of her personal devotions,<ref name=ODNB/> which she rather expressed in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], prayer, [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and [[penance]]. Privately, however, she was aware of what she identified as the shortcomings of the papacy and church officialdom.<ref name=ODNB>{{Citation|last1=Davies|first1=C. S. L. |last2=Edwards|first2=John|title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|date=January 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=Katherine (1485–1536)|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891}}</ref> Her doubts about Church improprieties certainly did not extend so far as to support the allegations of corruption made public by [[Martin Luther]] in Wittenberg in 1517, which were soon to have such far-reaching consequences in initiating the [[Protestant Reformation]].

In 1523 Alfonso de Villa Sancta, a learned [[friar]] of the Observant (reform) branch of the [[Franciscan|Friars Minor]] and friend of the king's old advisor [[Erasmus]], dedicated to the queen his book ''De Liberio Arbitrio adversus Melanchthonem'' denouncing [[Philip Melanchthon]], a supporter of Luther. Acting as her [[confessor]], he was able to nominate her for the title of "[[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]]" for denying Luther's arguments.{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=95}}

==Appearance==
Catherine was of a very fair complexion, had blue eyes, and had a hair colour that was between [[red hair|reddish]]-blonde and [[auburn hair|auburn]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} In her youth she was described as "the most beautiful creature in the world"{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=81}} and that there was "nothing lacking in her that the most beautiful girl should have".{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=24}} [[Thomas More]] and Lord Herbert would reflect later in her lifetime that in regard to her appearance "there were few women who could compete with the Queen [Catherine] in her prime."{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=104}}{{sfn|Strickland|p=493}}

==Legacy, memory, and historiography==
[[File:Alcalá de Henares, Monumento a Catalina de Aragón (M. Peinado 24-05-2008).jpg|thumb|Statue of Catherine at [[Alcalá de Henares]]]]

The controversial book "The Education of Christian Women" by [[Juan Luis Vives]], which claimed women have the right to an education, was dedicated to and commissioned by her. Such was Catherine's impression on people, that even her enemy, [[Thomas Cromwell]], said of her "If not for her sex, she could have defied all the heroes of History."{{sfn|Chapuys|1533|p=737}} She successfully appealed for the lives of the rebels involved in the [[Evil May Day]] for the sake of their families.{{sfn|Deutscher & Bietenholz|1987|p=283}} Furthermore, Catherine won widespread admiration by starting an extensive programme for the relief of the poor.{{sfn|Deutscher & Bietenholz|1987|p=283}} She was also a patron of [[Renaissance humanism]], and a friend of the great scholars [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Saint Thomas More]]. Some saw her as a martyr.<ref>Letters and Papers of Henry VIII, vol. X, no. 212.</ref><ref>Letters and Papers of Henry VIII, vol. X, no. 232.</ref>

In the reign of her daughter [[Mary I of England]], her marriage to Henry VIII was declared "good and valid". Her daughter Queen Mary also had several portraits commissioned of Catherine, and it would not by any means be the last time she was painted. After her death, numerous portraits were painted of her, particularly of her speech at the Legatine Trial, a moment accurately rendered in Shakespeare's play about Henry VIII.

Her tomb in [[Peterborough Cathedral]]{{sfn|Froude|1891|p=389}} can be seen and there is hardly ever a time when it is not decorated with flowers or pomegranates, her heraldic symbol. It bears the title ''Katharine Queen of England''.

In the 20th century, [[George V]]'s wife, [[Mary of Teck]], had her grave upgraded and there are now banners there denoting Catherine as a Queen of England. Every year at Peterborough Cathedral there is a service in her memory. There are processions, prayers, and various events in the Cathedral including processions to Catherine's grave in which candles, pomegranates, flowers and other offerings are placed on her grave. On the service commemorating the 470th anniversary of her death, the Spanish Ambassador to the United Kingdom attended. During the 2010 service a rendition of Catherine of Aragon's speech before the Legatine court was read by [[Jane Lapotaire]].  There is a statue of her in her birthplace of [[Alcalá de Henares]], as a young woman holding a book and a rose.<ref>{{cite web|author=cubamagica |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/29250286@N08/3206379232/ |title=Catalina de Aragon on Flickr – Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr.com |date=18 January 2009 |access-date=16 September 2013}}</ref>

Catherine has remained a popular biographical subject to the present day. The American historian [[Garrett Mattingly]] was the author of a popular biography ''Katherine of Aragon'' in 1942. In 1966, Catherine and her many supporters at court were the subjects of ''Catherine of Aragon and her Friends'', a biography by John E. Paul. In 1967, Mary M. Luke wrote the first book of her Tudor trilogy, ''Catherine the Queen'' which portrayed her and the tumultuous era of English history through which she lived.
[[File:Peterborough Katherine of Aragon.JPG|thumb|Grave of Catherine of Aragon in [[Peterborough Cathedral]]]] In recent years, the historian [[Alison Weir]] covered her life extensively in her biography ''[[The Six Wives of Henry&nbsp;VIII (book)|The Six Wives of Henry&nbsp;VIII]]'', first published in 1991. [[Antonia Fraser]] did the same in her own 1992 biography of the same title; as did the British historian [[David Starkey]] in his 2003 book ''Six Wives: The Queens of Henry&nbsp;VIII''.{{sfn|Starkey|2003|p=1}}{{sfn|Weir|1991|p=1}}{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=1}} [[Giles Tremlett]]'s biography ''Catherine of Aragon: The Spanish Queen of Henry&nbsp;VIII'' came out in 2010, and [[Julia Fox (author)|Julia Fox]]'s 2011 dual biography ''Sister Queens: The Noble, Tragic Lives of Katherine of Aragon and Juana, Queen of Castile''.

===Places and statues===
* In [[Alcalá de Henares]], the place of Catherine's birth, a statue of Catherine as a young woman holding a rose and a book can be seen in the Archbishop's Palace.
* [[Peterborough]] is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with the Spanish city of Alcalá de Henares, located in the wider Community of Madrid. Children from schools in the two places have learned about each other as part of the twinning venture, and artists have even come over from Alcalá de Henares to paint Catherine's tombstone.
* Many places in [[Ampthill]] are named after Catherine. Also in Ampthill there is a cross in Ampthill Great Park named "Queen Catherine's Cross" in her honour. It is on the site of the castle where she was sent during her divorce from the King.
* [[Kimbolton School]]'s science and mathematics block is called the QKB, or Queen Katherine Building.

===Spelling of her name===
Her baptismal name was "Catalina", but "Katherine" was soon the accepted form in England after her marriage to Arthur.<ref name="ODNB" /> Catherine herself signed her name "Katherine", "Katherina", "Katharine" and sometimes "Katharina". In a letter to her, Arthur, her husband, addressed her as "Princess Katerine". Her daughter Queen Mary&nbsp;I called her "Quene Kateryn", in her will. Rarely were names, particularly first names, written in an exact manner during the sixteenth century and it is evident from Catherine's own letters that she endorsed different variations.{{efn|Catherine's endorsement of different spellings can be identified in numerous letters, signing herself as 'Katharine the Quene' in a letter to Wolsey in 1513 and as 'Katharine' in her final letter to Henry VIII dating to {{Nowrap|Jan 1536}}.}}
Loveknots built into his various palaces by her husband, Henry&nbsp;VIII, display the initials "H&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;K",{{efn|As Latin inscriptions were used in structures, a "C" represented the [[Roman numeral|numeral 100]], so a "K" was used instead. The same was applied during the time of [[Henry II of France|Henri II]] and his wife [[Catherine de' Medici|Catherine]] during her state entry in Paris on 18 June 1549.}} as do other items belonging to Henry and Catherine, including gold goblets, a gold salt cellar, basins of gold, and candlesticks. Her tomb in [[Peterborough Cathedral]] is marked "Katharine Queen of England".{{sfn|Fraser|1992|pp=57–58}}<ref name=grave>{{cite web |url = http://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/looking-for-a-queen-of-england-in-peterborough-57132 |title = Looking for a Queen of England in Peterborough|publisher=Royal Central |date=6 March 2016 |access-date = 11 June 2019|author=Elizabeth Jane Timms }}</ref>
