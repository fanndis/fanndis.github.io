The '''Hypo Real Estate Holding [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]''' is a [[holding company]] based in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] which comprises a number of [[real estate]] financing [[bank]]s. The company's activities span three sectors of the real estate market: [[commercial property]], [[infrastructure]] and [[public finance]], and [[capital market]]s and [[asset management]]. Hypo Real Estate is the second largest commercial property lender in Germany.<ref name=fails>{{cite news | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27023960/ns/business-stocks_and_economy/t/deal-save-germanys-hypo-real-estate-fails/ | title=Deal to save Germany's Hypo Real Estate fails | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[NBC News]] | date=4 October 2008}}</ref>

The bank originated in 2003 from the [[real estate]] financing business of [[HypoVereinsbank]]. It employs about 2,000 people and was one of the 30 members of the [[DAX]] [[stock market index]] of the largest German companies between December 2005 and December 2008, before the shares were demoted to the [[MDAX]]. Its shares were further demoted to the [[SDAX]] in September 2009. In 2007 it acquired public finance company [[Depfa Bank]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/09/28/afx4166997.html|title=Hypo Real Estate buy of Depfa cleared by EU | work=[[AFX News]] |publisher=[[Forbes]] | date=29 August 2007}}</ref> The company remains a legal entity as a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] of the Hypo Real Estate Group.

The firm received a [[bailout]] from the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] and other German banks in October 2008 in the midst of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], before approving a complete [[nationalization]] a year later.

==Financial difficulties==

===Crisis summits===
Hypo Real Estate encountered financial difficulties during the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], principally due to the heavy debt burden of its [[Depfa Bank]] [[subsidiary]].<ref name=tumble>{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/germanys-hypo-real-estate-gets-thrown-a-lifeline-shares-drop | title=Hypo Real Estate's shares tumble after rescue | last=Kennedy | first=Simon | work=[[MarketWatch]] | date=29 September 2008}}</ref> On 29 September 2008, [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Finance Minister of Germany]] [[Peer Steinbrück]] announced that a [[Euro|€]]35 billion [[line of credit]] would be extended to Hypo Real Estate from the [[Government of Germany]] and a [[consortium]] of German banks.<ref name=tumble/>

After the first crisis summit, the [[supervisory board]] members independent from and unaffiliated to [[JC Flowers]] and Grove International Partners LLP resigned from the office. As successors, Michael Endres (chairman), Bernd Knobloch, Edgar Meister, Sigmar Mosdorf, Hans Jörg Vetter, Bernhard Walter and Manfred Zaß were appointed to the board.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://home.nestor.minsk.by/build/news/2008/11/2006.html | title=Changes to the Supervisory Board of Hypo Real Estate Holding AG | date=November 17, 2008}}</ref>

The deal fell apart on 4 October 2008 after the banking consortium involved pulled out.<ref name=fails/> A second proposed bailout was agreed on 6 October, with German banks to contribute €30 billion and the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] €20 billion to a credit line.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.propertyweek.com/news/hypo-real-gets-eu50-billion-government-led-bailout-/3124283.article | title=Hypo Real Gets EU50 Billion Government-Led Bailout | last1=Parkin | first1=Brian | last2=Suess | first2=Oliver | agency=[[Bloomberg News]] | publisher=[[Property Week]] |date=October 6, 2008}}</ref>

After the second crisis, summit some politicians demanded that HRE's top management resign, among them Federal Minister of Finance [[Peer Steinbrück]] who stated that he had been kept in the dark<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/14/business/worldbusiness/14bank.html | title=German Bank Receives Its Third Bailout | first=Carter | last=Dougherty | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 14, 2008 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> and that it was "unthinkable" to keep dealing with them, especially after they had used lawyers against the government to attempt to evade responsibilities.<ref>{{cite news | work=[[Deutsche Welle]] | url=https://www.dw.com/en/german-government-under-pressure-to-deliver-on-crisis-promise/a-3694172 | title=German Government Under Pressure to Deliver on Crisis Promise | date=October 6, 2008}}</ref> CEO Georg Funke subsequently stepped down, replaced by [[Axel Wieandt]] on 31 October 2008.

===Further guarantees===
Via several steps, Hypo Real Estate was granted further framework guarantees by the German Financial Markets Stabilisation Fund ([[SoFFin]]) in February 2009, taking its total state funding to €52 billion.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/hyporealestate-guarantees/update-2-troubled-hypo-takes-more-help-from-german-govt-idUSLB10301220090211 | title=Troubled Hypo takes more help from German govt |work=[[Reuters]] | date=11 February 2009}}</ref>

===SoFFin takeover offer===
On 17 April 2009, SoFFin tendered an offer to take over Hypo Real Estate by buying and creating shares that would raise its equity stake to 90%. On 24 April 2009 the HRE governing boards recommended that shareholders approve the offer by the rescue agency.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.hyporealestate.com/eng/pdf/042409_PI-Stellungnahme_Endfassung_Engl.pdf |title=Hypo Real Estate Holding AG issues Statement regarding the Takeover Offer by SoFFin |date=2009-04-25 |publisher=Hypo Real Estate Group |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712234038/http://www.hyporealestate.com/eng/pdf/042409_PI-Stellungnahme_Endfassung_Engl.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-12 }}</ref> By that date, government support for the company had reached €102 billion. Under a law passed in March, the government could force the sale if shareholders reject it.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.dw.com/en/german-government-to-take-control-of-hypo-real-estate/a-4204982 | title=German government to take control of Hypo Real Estate | work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=April 24, 2009}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the German parliament formed a committee to investigate the HRE bailout. Opposition parties from the left and right spurred creation of the committee, while the governing centrist coalition abstained.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.dw.com/en/inquiry-into-hypo-real-estate-rescue-enters-final-phase/a-4560231 | title=Inquiry into Hypo Real Estate rescue enters final phase | work=[[Deutsche Welle]] | date=August 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hyporealestate-timeline-sb/timeline-hypo-real-estates-path-to-nationalization-idUSTRE5381WB20090409 | title=TIMELINE: Hypo Real Estate's path to nationalization | first=Marilyn | last=Gerlach | work=[[Reuters]] | date=April 9, 2009}}</ref>

===Nationalisation===
With the German state (via SoFFin) already owning 90% of HRE, an [[extraordinary general meeting]] on 5 October 2009 approved a €1.30 per share [[squeeze out]] of the remaining private shareholders,<ref name=squeeze>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/hyporealestate/update-3-hypo-real-shareholders-howl-at-berlins-squeeze-out-idUSL566426820091006?sp=true | title=Hypo Real shareholders howl at Berlin's squeeze-out | last=Maushagen | first=Peter | work=[[Reuters]] | date=5 October 2009}}</ref> including J.C. Flowers (which a year earlier had taken a 25% stake at €22.50 per share).<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/sppage012-l16304596-oisbn/jc-flowers-taking-stake-in-battered-hypo-real-estate-idUSL1630459620080417 | title=JC Flowers taking stake in battered Hypo Real Estate | last1=Halstrick | first1=Philipp | last2=Nann | first2=Patricia | work=[[Reuters]] | date=17 April 2008}}</ref> The decision resulted in the complete [[nationalization]] of the firm<ref name=squeeze/> within a year of it having been a [[DAX]] constituent.
