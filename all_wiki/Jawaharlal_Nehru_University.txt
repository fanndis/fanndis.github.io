Jawaharlal Nehru University was established in 1969 by an act of [[Parliament of India|parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jawaharlal Nehru University Act 1966|url=http://www.jnu.ac.in/RTI/Act%20&%20Statutes/ACT.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> It was named after [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], India's first [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]].

C. Chagla]]. During the discussion that followed, Bhushan Gupta, member of parliament, voiced the opinion that this should not be yet another university. New faculties should be created, including [[scientific socialism]], and one thing that this university should ensure was to keep noble ideas in mind and provide accessibility to students from weaker sections of society. The JNU Bill was passed in [[Lok Sabha]] on 16 November 1966 and the JNU Act came into force on 22 April 1969.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jawaharlal Nehru University Vision|url=http://www.jnu.ac.in/AboutJNU/vision.asp|accessdate=7 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129014251/http://www.jnu.ac.in/AboutJNU/vision.asp|archive-date=29 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===International Student's Association===
The International Student's Association (ISA) is an official Jawaharlal Nehru University body. It was instituted in 1985 with a view to promoting friendly relations and cultural exchange. The ISA has a constitution and elected executive, cultural, advisory and financial committees. All foreign students of JNU are also members of the FSA. The university has 133 [[international student]]s.<ref name=Stats>{{cite web|title=Statistical Data of Central Universities – Jawaharlal Nehru University|url=http://www.jnu.ac.in/DataFactSheet/default.htm|accessdate=12 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815115009/http://www.jnu.ac.in/DataFactSheet/default.htm|archive-date=15 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Activism and controversy===
The JNU is infused with an intense [[political life]] on campus. Students that leave campus are said to acquire a "permanently changed outlook on life" as a result of the student politics. The politicisation of campus life has led to a refusal to brush under the carpet social issues such as [[Feminism in India|feminism]], [[minority rights]], social and economic justice. All such issues are debated fiercely in formal and informal gatherings.{{sfn|Roy Chowdhury|2013|p=225}}

The JNU student politics is [[Left-wing politics|left-of-centre]] even though, in recent years, [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] student groups have also entered the field. Political involvement is "celebratory in spirit." The [[Students' union|student union elections]] are preceded by days of debates and meetings, keeping all students involved. The JNU has the reputation of an "unruly bastion of [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolution."  However, the student activists deny the charge, stating that the politics at JNU is issue-based and intellectual.{{sfn|Roy Chowdhury|2013|p=225}}
[[File:Statue of Jawaharlal Nehru Ji at JNU, Delhi.jpg|thumb|Iconic statue of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru at administrative block of JNU]]
The university is known for its alumni who now occupy important political and [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] positions (see Notable alumni below). In part, this is because of the prevalence of Left-Centric student politics and the existence of a written constitution for the university to which noted [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|Communist Party of India]] leader [[Prakash Karat]] contributed exhaustively during his education at JNU.<ref>[http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/-difficult-to-adapt-to-life-outside-jnu-/1055487/ The Indian Express, ''‘Difficult to adapt to life outside JNU’'']</ref>

==== 2010 Operation Green Hunt Controversy ====

In 2010 a "JNU Forum Against War on People" was organised "to oppose [[Operation Green Hunt]] launched by the government."<ref name="Gohain 2010" /> According to the NSUI national general secretary, Shaikh Shahnawaz, the meeting was organised by the [[Democratic Students' Union]] (DSU) and [[All India Students Association]] (AISA) to "celebrate the [[April 2010 Maoist attack in Dantewada|killing of 76 CRPF personnel]] in Chhattisgarh."<ref name="Gohain 2010" /> Shaikh Shahnawaz also stated that "they were even shouting slogans like 'India murdabad, Maovad zindabad'."<ref name="Gohain 2010" />{{refn|group=note|"Death to India",<ref name="murdabad_dict">{{cite web|title=murdabad|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/murdabad|website=Collins English Dictionary|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=23 February 2016}}</ref> "long live Maoism"<ref name="zindabad_dict">{{cite web|title=zindabad|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/zindabad|website=Collins English Dictionary|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=23 February 2016}}</ref>}} NSUI and ABVP activists undertook a march against this meeting,<ref name="Gohain 2010" /> "which was seen as an attempt to support the [[Naxalite]]s and celebrate the massacre,"<ref name="IBNLive 2016">{{cite web | title=Dantewada ambush celebrations spark protest | website=IBNLive | date=2016-02-15 | url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/politics/jnu-naxal-jnu-sots-336466.html | accessdate=2016-02-15}}</ref> whereafter the various parties clashed.<ref name="Gohain 2010">{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Pitched-battle-over-peoples-war-at-JNU/articleshow/5783093.cms|title=Pitched battle over 'people's war' at JNU|last=Gohain|first=Manash Pratim|date=2010-04-11|website=The Times of India|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117010849/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Pitched-battle-over-peoples-war-at-JNU/articleshow/5783093.cms|archive-date=17 November 2018|url-status=live|accessdate=2016-02-15}}</ref> The organisers of the forum said that "the event had nothing to do with the killings in Dantewada"<ref name="NDTV.com 2010">{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/dantewada-aftershocks-at-jnu-415103|title=Dantewada aftershocks at JNU|date=2010-04-12|website=NDTV.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711060143/https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/dantewada-aftershocks-at-jnu-415103|archive-date=11 July 2018|url-status=live|accessdate=2016-02-15}}</ref>

==== 2015 Opposition to Saffronisation ====

In 2015, the JNU Students' Union and the [[All India Students Association]] objected to efforts to create instruction on Indian culture. Opposition to such courses was on the basis that such instruction was an attempt to saffronise education.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/course-on-indian-culture-is-saffronisation-jnu-students/article7745245.ece | title= Course on Indian culture is 'saffronisation': JNU students | work=The Hindu | date=10 October 2015 | accessdate=28 February 2016 | author=Sebastian, Kritika Sharma}}</ref> [[Saffronisation]] refers to right-wing efforts to glorify ancient Hindu culture. The proposed courses were successfully opposed and were, thus, "rolled back." A former student of JNU and a former student union member, Albeena Shakil, claimed that BJP officials in government were responsible for proposing the controversial courses.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kanhaiyas-predecessors-where-they-are-what-they-do/ | title= Kanhaiya's predecessors: Where they are, what they do | work=The Indian Express | date=22 February 2016 | accessdate=28 February 2016 | author=Iqbal, Naveed }}</ref>
