"'''Aura'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Lady Gaga]] for her third [[studio album]], ''[[Artpop]]'' (2013). She co-wrote and co-produced the track with [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and the [[psychedelic trance]] duo [[Infected Mushroom]]. Initially entitled "Burqa", an Infected Mushroom demo is the song's backbone. "Aura", which explores different facets of the singer, is a [[mariachi]] and EDM song with Western guitar and Middle Eastern musical influences and a dance production. Lyrically, it equates the life of a celebrity and stardom with religious oppression and subjugation.

[[Music journalism|Music critics]] were divided about the song. Reviewers praised its production and innovative composition but criticized its lyrics, which used the word "[[burqa]]" in a sexual manner. "Aura" was first performed live during Gaga's headlining [[iTunes Festival]], and it was used in the trailer for [[Robert Rodriguez]]'s ''[[Machete Kills]]'' (in which the singer co-stars). It was also part of the setlist of [[ArtRave: The Artpop Ball]] tour, and Gaga's Las Vegas reisdency, [[Lady Gaga Enigma|Enigma]]. The song entered the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Dance/Electronic Songs]] chart based on streaming activity.

==Background and development==
[[File:Infected Mushroom in Russia.jpg|thumb|"Aura" was based on a demo by Israeli musicians [[Infected Mushroom]], who later were given co-writer and producer credits on the song|alt=Infected Mushroom playing at a DJ booth]]

Development of Gaga's third studio album, ''[[Artpop]]'', began shortly after the release of ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' (2011); by the following year, its concepts were "beginning to flourish" as Gaga collaborated with producers [[Fernando Garibay]] and [[DJ White Shadow]].<ref name=":1">{{cite news|last=Shewey|first=Don|date=July 30, 2013|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eight-things-we-know-about-lady-gagas-artpop-20130730|title=Lady Gaga's 'ARTPOP': What We Know So Far|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=February 21, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127124958/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eight-things-we-know-about-lady-gagas-artpop-20130730|archivedate=November 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name="DJWS">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1675019/lady-gaga-next-album-tour/|title=Lady Gaga 'Doing Prep' for Tour, Next Album|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=November 28, 2011|accessdate=January 17, 2012|publisher=[[MTV News]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211093036/http://www.mtv.com/news/1675019/lady-gaga-next-album-tour/|archivedate=December 11, 2014}}</ref><ref name="albumname">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1675458/lady-gaga-next-album/|title=Lady Gaga Says Next Album Is 'Beginning to Flourish'|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=December 6, 2011|accessdate=January 17, 2012|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507183044/http://www.mtv.com/news/1675458/lady-gaga-next-album/|archivedate=May 7, 2014}}</ref> As the singer embarked on her [[Born This Way Ball]] tour, she began collaborating with disc jockey [[Zedd]]. In October 2012, when asked by DJ [[Calvin Harris]] about her work with Zedd, Gaga sent a cryptic [[Twitter]] message: "Were all good [Zedd] miss you buddy been listening to **rq* all day". The abbreviated word was assumed to refer to a song title. About a year later, a [[demo (music)|demo]] from Gaga's ''Artpop'' sessions leaked with the song, entitled "Burqa"; however, it was presumed to have a two-part title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dancingastronaut.com/2013/08/lady-gagas-burqa-aura-surfaces-with-production-from-zedd-and-infected-mushroom/|title=Lady Gaga's 'Burqa / Aura' surfaces with production from Zedd and Infected Mushroom|last=Farella|first=Dylan|date=August 7, 2013|accessdate=February 3, 2016|work=Dancing Astronaut|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104222928/http://www.dancingastronaut.com/2013/08/lady-gagas-burqa-aura-surfaces-with-production-from-zedd-and-infected-mushroom/|archivedate=November 4, 2015}}</ref>

The song's real name was revealed as "Aura", originating from a demo by the Israeli [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] musical duo [[Infected Mushroom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youredm.com/2013/08/06/track-from-lady-gagas-artpop-leaks/|title=Track From Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Leaks|last=Marmor|first=Jacob|date=August 6, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2016|work=Your EDM|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220031906/http://www.youredm.com/2013/08/06/track-from-lady-gagas-artpop-leaks/|archivedate=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Get-infected-451105|title=Get Infected|last=Hochner|first=Hannah|date=April 13, 2016|accessdate=December 3, 2016|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220031128/http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Get-infected-451105|archivedate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> In an interview with the Israeli weekly newspaper ''[[B'Sheva]]'', the duo detailed the song's conception. Gaga had reportedly visited Zedd's studio while he was working on music with Infected Mushroom. She liked the first demo she heard, which was for "Aura". Zedd later called the duo, saying that Gaga wanted the song for ''Artpop''. They deliberated for some time, torn between maintaining their artistic integrity by not collaborating with mainstream artists and the possibility of a "lifelong pension" from the track's royalties. Infected Mushroom decided to give it to Gaga, but wanted to be credited under an alias. The singer was opposed, and wanted the group's real name in the credits.<ref>{{cite news|title=ראיון אינפקטד מאשרום: ליידי גאגא ומוסיקה הם אוהבים|date=October 6, 2013|work=[[B'Sheva]]|oclc=52088674|last=Mushroom|first=Infected|trans-title=Infected Mushroom on music}}</ref> According to Gaga, she wrote the song as an accompaniment to an [[Mobile app|app]] being developed for ''Artpop'' and it was inspired by her different facets:<ref name="tbt">{{cite web|url=http://www.newnownext.com/lady-gaga-explains-artpop-track-by-track-listen/12/2013/|title=Lady Gaga Explains 'ARTPOP' Track-by-Track: Listen|last=Shorey|first=Eric|date=December 12, 2013|accessdate=November 23, 2016|publisher=[[Logo TV]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205111425/http://www.newnownext.com/lady-gaga-explains-artpop-track-by-track-listen/12/2013/|archivedate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>
<blockquote>
So this song is about me basically saying that just because all of those things are there [it] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath. And then, also that these veils, they are really just protecting me from the thing that I held the most sacred, which is my creativity ... My Aura is the way that I deal with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.<ref name="tbt"/></blockquote>

To promote the 2013 American action-comedy film ''[[Machete Kills]]'' (in which Gaga appeared as La Chameleón), its producers used the song in a commercial and created a [[lyric video]] which was uploaded on [[Vevo]] and [[YouTube]] on October 9, 2013.

[[File:Zedd at the 2012 SXSW cropped 2.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Zedd]] co-wrote, produced and mixed the track.|alt=Zedd in a white T-shirt, looking to his right and smiling]]

After recording began, Zedd was not pleased with the initial songs and suggested that Gaga redo the whole process. Gaga, not content with creating a staple radio hit, wanted to record creatively. Zedd explained to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that they did not "try to make an [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] album—but, at the same time, we didn't try not to make an EDM album. I've done a lot of stuff that's really outside of what I usually do".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1710460/lady-gaga-artpop/|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP: What We Know So Far|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=June 12, 2013|accessdate=March 22, 2014|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113193941/http://www.mtv.com/news/1710460/lady-gaga-artpop/|archivedate=January 13, 2015}}</ref> "Aura" distributes songwriting and production credit among Gaga, Zedd and Infected Mushroom.

Rick Pearl did [[Programming (music)|additional programming]] and Gene Grimaldi the [[audio mastering]] at Oasis Mastering Studios in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name="liner" /> According to Zedd, "Aura" was the most interesting track on ''Artpop'' because its combination of oriental music, guitars and an electronic beat enabled it to "cross over" musical genres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1715344/zedd-lady-gaga-aura-artpop/|title=Lady Gaga's 'Aura': Zedd Takes Us Inside The 'Unique Electronic|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=November 10, 2013|accessdate=March 22, 2014|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205145646/http://www.mtv.com/news/1715344/zedd-lady-gaga-aura-artpop/|archivedate=December 5, 2014}}</ref>

A [[mariachi]] and EDM song,<ref name=10things/> "Aura" begins with Gaga's filtered vocal against a Western-style guitar: "I killed my former and left her in the trunk on highway ten", followed by dissonant laughter.<ref name=spin/> Sam Lansky of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] called it a "terrible [[Nancy Sinatra]] affectation". A big-sounding [[electronic dance music|EDM]] production follows the laughter, its beat reminiscent of Gaga's 2011 "[[Government Hooker]]" and its vocal "garbled".<ref name=idol/> As the track reaches a crescendo, Gaga sings its hook: "Do you wanna see me naked, lover? Do you wanna peek underneath the cover? Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?" against a spare accompaniment.<ref name=spin/><ref name=idol>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7475609/lady-gaga-burqa-leak-new-song|title=Lady Gaga's New 'ARTPOP' Song 'Aura' Has Leaked: Listen|last=Lansky|first=Sam|date=August 10, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2016|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225115744/http://www.idolator.com/7475609/lady-gaga-burqa-leak-new-song|archivedate=December 25, 2016}}</ref> The song, written in [[common time]] in the key of [[F major]], has a tempo of 120 beats per minute.

According to James Montgomery of [[MTV News]], "Aura{{"'}}s lyrics equate celebrity and stardom with religious oppression and subjugation. The beginning of the song, implying that the singer destroyed her old self to become Gaga the artist, examines the loss of a private life and constant media scrutiny (noting that they are by choice). The track's central metaphor is a [[burqa]] as a "veil of fame", sexualizing it with the line "Do you wanna see me naked, lover?" Montgomery said that criticism of Gaga's use of the word "burqa" is countered in the lyrics, when she sings "Enigma popstar is fun, she wears burqa for fashion". "Aura" expresses Gaga's solidarity with what she considers her sisterhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1715386/lady-gaga-aura-lyric-video-gif/|title=Lady Gaga's 'Aura' Analysis: From Burqas To Bondage|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=October 10, 2013|accessdate=December 3, 2016|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117004935/http://www.mtv.com/news/1715386/lady-gaga-aura-lyric-video-gif/|archivedate=November 17, 2016}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
[[Music journalism|Music critics]] were divided in their reviews of "Aura". Sal Cinquemani of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' gave the song a positive review, preferring it to the album's lead single ("[[Applause (Lady Gaga song)|Applause]]"); "Aura" is "everything we've come to expect from Gaga: messy, self-absorbed, overly ambitious, and downright weird—while still being undeniably infectious".<ref name="Slant">{{cite web|title=Single Review: Lady Gaga, "Applause"|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2013/12/single-review-lady-gaga-applause|first=Sal|last=Cinquemani|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=August 12, 2013|accessdate=August 12, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814163829/http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2013/12/single-review-lady-gaga-applause|archivedate=August 14, 2013}}</ref> According to Jason Lipshutz of ''Billboard'', the track positioned the album as a whole "with ambitious ideas and breakneck electronic passages".<ref name="bbrev">{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga, 'ARTPOP': Track-By-Track Review|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/5778227/lady-gaga-artpop-track-by-track-review|first=Jason|last=Lipshutz|work=Billboard|date=November 5, 2013|accessdate=December 4, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117021029/http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/5778227/lady-gaga-artpop-track-by-track-review|archivedate=November 17, 2013}}</ref> Three years later, in another ''Billboard'' article ("Lady Gaga's Top 10 Most Daring Songs"), Dan Weiss called "Aura" the singer's "boldest moment particularly as an album opener ...

<blockquote>
"Aura", this set's opener, manages to be a multitude of songs at once, jumping from nosebleed bass to [[Middle East|(Middle) Eastern]]-coloured tones, a [[Spaghetti Western]] monologue to a stars-bound middle-eight, from quite-deliberately provocative talk of slavery and the meaning of the [[burqa]] to mindless cosmic love waffle. "Do you want to see the girl who lives behind the aura?" Lady Gaga asks us. Sure.

Lansky was disappointed with the track, and wrote in his Idolator article that "Aura" consisted of all "the best and worst things about Lady Gaga amplified"; it was "weird and frustrating and great and terrible and brilliant and a failure all at once".<ref name=idol/> Umema Aimem of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' criticized the song's lyrics: "The song actually started out well ... but then you lost me when you proceeded to turn such a sacred symbol of [Islam] into an exotic costume".<ref name="Washington"/> Mark Hogan of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' called it "a grasping EDM mess" and "all over the place"; he disliked the burqa lyrics, "along with plenty of moments that bring to mind all the 'blog house' producers following in the path of [[Crystal Castles (band)|Crystal Castles]] or [[Simian Mobile Disco]] circa 2007".<ref name=spin>{{cite news|url=http://www.spin.com/2013/08/lady-gaga-aura-leak-artpop-burqa/|title=Lady Gaga's 'Aura' Leak, if Real, Is a Grasping EDM Mess|last=Hogan|first=Mark|date=August 6, 2013|accessdate=December 4, 2016|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031100245/http://www.spin.com/2013/08/lady-gaga-aura-leak-artpop-burqa/|archivedate=October 31, 2015}}</ref> Max Kessler of ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'' gave "Aura" a lukewarm review; the song had "all the classic Gaga attributes", including "controversial and mildly clever lyrics set to a throbbing, almost-grating dance beat that's at times great and at times horrible".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.papermag.com/2013/08/lady_gagas_new_song_is_about_b.php|title=Lady Gaga's New Song Is About Burqas and Dancing (Of Course)|last=Kessler|first=Max|date=August 6, 2013|accessdate=December 4, 2016|work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101095240/http://www.papermag.com/2013/08/lady_gagas_new_song_is_about_b.php|archivedate=November 1, 2014}}</ref> Its lyrics were controversial, with some [[Muslim]]s accusing Gaga of degrading the burqa by sexualizing it.
