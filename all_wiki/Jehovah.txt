'''Jehovah''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ɪ|ˈ|h|oʊ|v|ə}}) is a [[Romanization|Latinization]] of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{hebrew|יְהֹוָה}}, one [[Tiberian vocalization|vocalization]] of the [[Tetragrammaton]] {{hebrew|יהוה}} (YHWH), the proper name of the [[God in Judaism|God of Israel]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]<ref>The Imperial Bible-Dictionary, Volume 1, p. 856. "Jehovah, on the other hand, the personality of the Supreme is more distinctly expressed. It is every where a proper name, denoting the personal God and him only; whereas Elohim partakes more of the character of a common noun, denoting usually, indeed, but not necessarily nor uniformly, the Supreme. Elohim may be grammatically defined by the article, or by having a suffix attached to it, or by being in construction with a following noun. The Hebrew may say the Elohim, the true God, in opposition to all false gods; but he never says the Jehovah, for Jehovah is the name of the true God only. He says again and again my  God; but never my Jehovah, for when he says my God, he means Jehovah. He speaks of the God of Israel, but never of the Jehovah of Israel, for there is no other Jehovah. He speaks of the living God, but never of the living Jehovah, for he cannot conceive of Jehovah as other than living. It is obvious, therefore, that the name Elohim is the name of more general import, seeing that it admits of definition and limitation in these various ways; whereas Jehovah is the more specific and personal name, altogether incapable of limitation."</ref> and one of the [[Names of God in Judaism#Seven Names of God|seven names of God in Judaism]].

The consensus among scholars is that the historical vocalization of the Tetragrammaton at the time of the [[redaction]] of the [[Torah]] (6th century BCE) is most likely [[Yahweh]]. The historical vocalization was lost because in [[Second Temple Judaism]], during the 3rd to 2nd centuries BCE, the pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton came to be avoided, being substituted with [[Adonai]] ("my Lord"). The Hebrew vowel points of ''Adonai'' were added to the Tetragrammaton by the [[Masoretes]], and the resulting form was transliterated around the 12th century as ''Yehowah''.<ref name=Schaff>Schaff, Philip -[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc12/Page_470.html Yahweh] ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge Volume XII'', Paper Book House, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 1950, page 480.</ref> The derived forms ''Iehouah'' and ''Jehovah'' first appeared in the 16th century.

''Jehovah'' was first introduced by [[William Tyndale]] in his translation of Exodus&nbsp;6:3, and appears in some other early English translations including the [[Geneva Bible]] and the [[King James Version]].<ref name=Driver>In the 7th paragraph of ''Introduction to the Old Testament of the New English Bible'', [http://www.bible-researcher.com/driver1.html Sir Godfrey Driver wrote], "The early translators generally substituted 'Lord' for [YHWH]. [...] The Reformers preferred Jehovah, which first appeared as ''Iehouah'' in 1530 A.D., in Tyndale's translation of the Pentateuch (Exodus 6.3), from which it passed into other Protestant Bibles."</ref> The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] states that in order to pronounce the Tetragrammaton "it is necessary to introduce vowels that alter the written and spoken forms of the name (i.e. "Yahweh" or "Jehovah")."<ref name="USCCB2008">{{cite web |title=The Name of God in the Liturgy |url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/the-mass/frequently-asked-questions/the-name-of-god-in-the-liturgy.cfm |publisher=[[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] |language=English |year=2008}}</ref> ''Jehovah'' appears in the Old Testament of some widely used translations including the [[American Standard Version]] (1901) and [[Young's Literal Translation]] (1862, 1899); the [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|New World Translation]] (1961, 2013) uses ''Jehovah'' in both the Old and New Testaments. ''Jehovah'' does not appear in most mainstream English translations, some of which use [[Yahweh]] but most continue to use "Lord" or "{{LORD}}" to represent the [[Tetragrammaton]].<ref name="ESVpreface"/><ref name="NRSVpreface"/>

According to a Jewish tradition developed during the 3rd to 2nd centuries BCE, the Tetragrammaton is written but not pronounced. When read, substitute terms replace the divine name where {{hebrew|יְהֹוָה}} ''Yəhōwāh'' appears in the text. It is widely assumed, as proposed by the 19th-century Hebrew scholar [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]], that the vowels of the substitutes of the name—''Adonai'' (Lord) and ''Elohim'' ([[God]])—were inserted by the [[Masoretes]] to indicate that these substitutes were to be used.<ref>"{{hebrew|יְהֹוָה}} Jehovah, pr[oper] name of the supreme God amongst the Hebrews. The later Hebrews, for some centuries before the time of Christ, either misled by a false interpretation of certain laws (Ex. 20:7; Lev. 24:11), or else following some old superstition, regarded this name as so very holy, that it might not even be pronounced (see Philo, Vit. Mosis t.iii. p.519, 529). Whenever, therefore, this ''nomen tetragrammaton'' occurred in the sacred text, they were accustomed to substitute for it {{hebrew|אֲדֹנָי}}, and thus the vowels of the noun {{hebrew|אֲדֹנָי}} are in the Masoretic text placed under the four letters יהוה, but with this difference, that the initial Yod receives a simple and not a compound Sh’va ({{hebrew|יְהֹוָה}} [Y'''ə'''hōvāh], not ({{hebrew|יֲהֹוָה}} [Y'''á'''hōvāh]); prefixes, however, receive the same points as if they were followed by {{hebrew|אֲדֹנָי}} [...] This custom was already in vogue in the days of the [[Septuagint|LXX. translators]]; and thus it is that they everywhere translated {{hebrew|יְהֹוָה}} by ὁ Κύριος ({{hebrew|אֲדֹנָי}})."

The most widespread theory is that the Hebrew term {{hebrew|יְהֹוָה}} has the [[niqqud|vowel points]] of {{hebrew|אֲדֹנָי}} (''adonai'').<ref name=Jouon>Paul Joüon and T. Muraoka.

When the two names, {{lang|he|יהוה}} and {{lang|he|אדני}}, occur together, the former is pointed with a ''hataf segol'' {{hebrew|ֱ}} under the ''yod'' {{lang|he|י}} and a ''hiriq'' {{hebrew|ִ}} under the second ''he'' {{lang|he|ה}}, giving {{hebrew|יֱהֹוִה}}, to indicate that it is to be read as (''elohim'') in order to avoid ''adonai'' being repeated.<ref name=Jouon/><ref name=JewishEncycloJehovah/>

{{hebrew|יְהֹוָה}} appears 6,518 times in the traditional [[Masoretic Text]], in addition to 305 instances of {{hebrew|יֱהֹוִה}} (''Jehovih''). The pronunciation ''Jehovah'' is believed to have arisen through the introduction of vowels of the ''[[qere]]''—the marginal notation used by the Masoretes. In places where the consonants of the text to be read (the ''qere'') differed from the consonants of the written text (the ''[[kethib]]''), they wrote the ''qere'' in the margin to indicate that the ''kethib'' was read using the vowels of the ''qere''. For a few very frequent words the marginal note was omitted, referred to as ''[[q're perpetuum]]''.<ref name=JewishEncycloName/> One of these frequent cases was God's name, which was not to be pronounced in fear of profaning the "ineffable name". Instead, wherever {{lang|he|יהוה}} (''YHWH'') appears in the ''kethib'' of the biblical and [[liturgical book]]s, it was to be read as {{hebrew|אֲדֹנָי}} (''adonai'', "My Lord [plural of majesty]"), or as {{hebrew|אֱלֹהִים}} (''elohim'', "God") if ''adonai'' appears next to it.<ref name="askdefinebeta - vowel points of Jehovah">[http://jehovah.askdefinebeta.com/ The vowel points of Jehovah] – Jehovah.

Scholars are not in total agreement as to why {{hebrew|יְהֹוָה}} does not have precisely the same vowel points as ''adonai''.<ref name="askdefinebeta - vowel points of Jehovah"/> The use of the composite ''hataf segol'' {{hebrew|ֱ}} in cases where the name is to be read, "''elohim''", has led to the opinion that the composite ''hataf patah'' {{hebrew|ֲ}} ought to have been used to indicate the reading, "''adonai''".

The difference between the vowel points of ''’ǎdônây'' and ''YHWH'' is explained by the rules of Hebrew [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[phonetics]]. ''Sheva'' and ''hataf-patah'' were [[allophone]]s of the same [[phoneme]] used in different situations: ''hataf-patah'' on glottal consonants including ''aleph'' (such as the first letter in ''Adonai''), and simple ''sheva'' on other consonants (such as the ''Y'' in ''YHWH'').<ref name=JewishEncycloJehovah/>

===Introduction into English===
[[File:Hutchinson, Roger 1550 JEHOVAH.png|thumb|The "peculiar, special, honorable and most blessed name of God" '''Iehoua''',<br>an older English form of Jehovah<br>(Roger Hutchinson, ''The image of God'', 1550)]]
The earliest available [[Latin]] text to use a vocalization similar to ''Jehovah'' dates from the 13th century.<ref>''Pugio fidei'' by [[Raymund Martin]], written in about 1270</ref> The ''Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon'' suggested that the pronunciation ''Jehovah'' was unknown until 1520 when it was introduced by [[Galatinus]], who defended its use.

In English it appeared in [[William Tyndale]]'s translation of the [[Pentateuch]] ("The Five Books of Moses") published in 1530 in Germany, where Tyndale had studied since 1524, possibly in one or more of the universities at [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|Wittenberg]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Marburg University|Marburg]], where Hebrew was taught.<ref>Dahlia M. Karpman  "Tyndale's Response to the Hebraic Tradition"  in ''Studies in the Renaissance'', Vol. 14 (1967)), pp. 113, 118, 119. Note: Westcott, in his survey of the English Bible, wrote that Tyndale "felt by a happy instinct the potential affinity between Hebrew and English idioms, and enriched our language and thought for ever with the characteristics of the Semitic mind."</ref> The spelling used by Tyndale was "Iehouah"; at that time, "I" was not distinguished from [[J]], and [[U]] was not distinguished from [[V]].<ref>The first English-language book to make a clear distinction between ''I'' and ''J'' was published in 1634. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=CCvMbntWth8C ''The Cambridge History of the English Language''], Richard M. Hogg,  ([[Cambridge University Press]] 1992 {{ISBN|0-521-26476-6}}, p. 39). It was also only by the mid-1500s that ''V'' was used to represent the [[consonant]] and ''U'' the vowel sound, while capital ''U'' was not accepted as a distinct letter until many years later ([https://books.google.com/books?id=63Qnbt2CMiMC&pg=PA124 ''Letter by Letter: An Alphabetical Miscellany''], Laurent Pflughaupt,  (Princeton Architectural Press {{ISBN|978-1-56898-737-8}}) pp. 123–124).</ref> The original 1611 printing of the [[Authorized King James Version]] used "Iehouah". Tyndale wrote about the divine name: "IEHOUAH [Jehovah], is God's name; neither is any creature so called; and it is as much to say as, One that is of himself, and dependeth of nothing. Moreover, as oft as thou seest {{LORD}} in great letters (except there be any error in the printing), it is in Hebrew ''Iehouah'', Thou that art; or, He that is."<ref>William Tyndale, ''Doctrinal Treatises'', ed. [[Henry Walter (antiquary)|Henry Walter]] (Cambridge, 1848), p. 408.</ref> The name is also found in a 1651 edition of [[Ramón Martí]]'s ''Pugio fidei''.<ref>{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia |wstitle=Jehovah |display=Jehovah (Yahweh) |volume=8 |first=Anthony John |last=Maas}}</ref>

The name ''Jehovah'' (initially as ''Iehouah'') appeared in all early Protestant Bibles in English, except [[Myles Coverdale|Coverdale]]'s translation in 1535.<ref name=Driver/> The Roman Catholic [[Douay-Rheims Bible]] used "the Lord", corresponding to the Latin [[Vulgate]]'s use of "Dominus" (Latin for "Adonai", "Lord") to represent the Tetragrammaton. The ''[[Authorized King James Version]]'', which used "{{Smallcaps|Jehovah}}" in a few places, most frequently gave "the {{LORD}}" as the equivalent of the Tetragrammaton. The form ''Iehouah'' appeared in John Rogers' ''[[Matthew Bible]]'' in 1537, the ''[[Great Bible]]'' of 1539, the ''[[Geneva Bible]]'' of 1560, ''[[Bishop's Bible]]'' of 1568 and the ''[[King James Version]]'' of 1611. More recently, ''Jehovah'' has been used in the ''[[Revised Version]]'' of 1885, the ''[[American Standard Version]]'' in 1901, and the ''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'' of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] in 1961.

==Hebrew vowel points==
Modern guides to biblical Hebrew grammar, such as Duane A Garrett's ''A Modern Grammar for Classical Hebrew''<ref>Duane A. Garrett, A Modern Grammar for Classical Hebrew (Broadman & Holman 2002 {{ISBN|0-8054-2159-9}}), p. 13</ref> state that the Hebrew vowel points now found in printed Hebrew Bibles were invented in the second half of the first millennium AD, long after the texts were written. This is indicated in the authoritative ''Hebrew Grammar'' of Gesenius,<ref>[[s:Page:Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar (1910 Kautzsch-Cowley edition).djvu/62|Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar (1910 Kautzsch-Cowley edition), p. 38]]</ref><ref>Christo H.

"Jehovist" scholars, largely earlier than the 20th century, who believe {{IPAc-en|dʒ|ə|ˈ|h|oʊ|v|ə}} to be the original pronunciation of the divine name, argue that the Hebraic vowel-points and accents were known to writers of the scriptures in antiquity and that both Scripture and history argue in favor of their ''[[:wikt:ab origine|ab origine]]'' status to the Hebrew language.

Jehovist writers such as Nehemia Gordon, who helped make a translation of the "Dead Sea Scrolls", have acknowledged the general agreement among scholars that the original pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton was probably ''Yahweh'', and that the vowel points now attached to the Tetragrammaton were added to indicate that ''Adonai'' was to be read instead, as seen in the alteration of those points after prefixes.

18th-century theologian [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]] puts forward the arguments of 17th-century [[Johannes Buxtorf II]] and others in his writing, ''A Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language, Letters, Vowel-Points and Accents''.<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1778}}</ref> He argued for an extreme antiquity of their use,<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1778|pp=499–560}}</ref> rejecting the idea that the vowel points were invented by the Masoretes. Gill presented writings, including passages of scripture, that he interpreted as supportive of his "Jehovist" viewpoint that the Old Testament must have included vowel-points and accents.<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1778|pp=549–560}}</ref> He claimed that the use of Hebrew vowel points of {{hebrew|יְהֹוָה}}, and therefore of the name ''Jehovah'' {{IPAc-en|j|ə|ˈ|h|oʊ|v|ə}}, is documented from before 200 BCE, and even back to [[Adam]], citing Jewish tradition that Hebrew was the first language. He argued that throughout this history the Masoretes did not invent the vowel points and accents, but that they were delivered to Moses by God at Sinai, citing<ref name="books.google.com">{{harvnb|Gill|1778|pp=538–542}}</ref> [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] authorities<ref>''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/11539822/Awe-11 In Awe of Thy Word], G.A.

Gill quoted [[Elia Levita]], who said, "There is no syllable without a point, and there is no word without an accent," as showing that the vowel points and the accents found in printed Hebrew Bibles have a dependence on each other, and so Gill attributed the same antiquity to the accents as to the vowel points.<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1778|p=499}}</ref> Gill acknowledged that Levita, "first asserted the vowel points were invented by "[[Masoretic Text#The Age of the Masoretes|the men of Tiberias]]", but made reference to his condition that "if anyone could convince him that his opinion was contrary to the book of Zohar, he should be content to have it rejected." Gill then alludes to the book of Zohar, stating that rabbis declared it older than the Masoretes, and that it attests to the vowel-points and accents.<ref name="Gill 1778 531"/>

Gill's view that the Hebrew vowel points were in use at the time of Ezra or even since the origin of the Hebrew language is stated in an early 19th-century study in opposition to "the opinion of most learned men in modern times", according to whom the vowel points had been "invented since the time of Christ".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vW0SAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145&dq=hebrew+vowel+points&source=bl&ots=sjD0nYBUnF&sig=6ZVpuca4WqPu6j1EN-1RGlV7NKM&hl=en&ei=wQzHStqRG-HajQfuhoRI&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5#v=onepage&q=hebrew%20vowel%20points&f=false Godfrey Higgins, On the Vowel Points of the Hebrew Language, in ''The Classical Journal'' for March and June 1826], p. 145</ref> The study presented the following considerations:
* The argument that vowel points are necessary for learning to read Hebrew is refuted by the fact that the [[Samaritan]] text of the Bible is read without them and that several other Semitic languages, kindred to Hebrew, are written without any indications of the vowels.
* The books used in synagogue worship have always been without vowel points, which, unlike the letters, have thus never been treated as sacred.
* The Qere Kethib marginal notes give variant readings only of the letters, never of the points, an indication either that these were added later or that, if they already existed, they were seen as not so important.
* The [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]] drew their mysteries only from the letters and completely disregarded the points, if there were any.
* In several cases, ancient translations from the Hebrew Bible ([[Septuagint]], [[Targum]], [[Aquila of Sinope]], [[Symmachus the Ebionite|Symmachus]], [[Theodotion]], [[Jerome]]) read the letters with vowels different from those indicated by the points, an indication that the texts from which they were translating were without points. The same holds for [[Origen]]'s transliteration of the Hebrew text into Greek letters. Jerome expressly speaks of a word in Habakkuk 3:5, which in the present [[Masoretic Text]] has three consonant letters and two vowel points, as being of three letters and no vowel whatever.
* Neither the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] nor the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (in all their recounting of Rabbinical disputes about the meaning of words), nor [[Philo]] nor [[Josephus]], nor any Christian writer for several centuries after Christ make any reference to vowel points.<ref>Higgins, pp. 146–149</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v1ga4m9vIhYC&pg=PA619&lpg=PA619 Augustin Calmet, Dictionary of the Bible], pp. 618–619</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vancepublications.com/cr/cr6ex.pdf|title=B.

In ''A Dictionary of the Bible'' (1863), [[William Robertson Smith]] summarized these discourses, concluding that "whatever, therefore, be the true pronunciation of the word, there can be little doubt that it is not ''Jehovah''".<ref>Smith commented, "In the decade of dissertations collected by Reland, Fuller, Gataker, and Leusden do battle for the pronunciation Jehovah, against such formidable antagonists as Drusius, Amama, Cappellus, Buxtorf, and Altingius, who, it is scarcely necessary to say, fairly beat their opponents out of the field; "the only argument of any weight, which is employed by the advocates of the pronunciation of the word as it is written being that derived from the form in which it appears in proper names, such as Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, &c. [...] Their antagonists make a strong point of the fact that, as has been noticed above, two different sets of vowel points are applied to the same consonants under certain circumstances. To this Leusden, of all the champions on his side, but feebly replies. [...] The same may be said of the argument derived from the fact that the letters מוכלב, when prefixed to יהוה, take, not the vowels which they would regularly receive were the present pronunciation true, but those with which they would be written if {{hebrew|אֲדֹנָי}}, ''adonai'', were the reading; and that the letters ordinarily taking ''dagesh lene'' when following יהוה would, according to the rules of the Hebrew points, be written without dagesh, whereas it is uniformly inserted."</ref> Despite this, he consistently uses the name ''Jehovah'' throughout his dictionary and when translating Hebrew names. Some examples include ''Isaiah'' [''Jehovah's help or salvation''], ''Jehoshua'' [''Jehovah a helper''], ''Jehu'' [''Jehovah is He'']. In the entry, ''Jehovah'', Smith writes: "JEHOVAH ({{hebrew|יְהֹוָה}}, usually with the vowel points of {{hebrew|אֲדֹנָי}}; but when the two occur together, the former is pointed {{hebrew|יֱהֹוִה}}, that is with the vowels of {{hebrew|אֱלֹהִים}}, as in Obad. i. 1, Hab. iii. 19:"<ref>[http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2003-7/264290/JehovahSmithsBibleDictionary.jpg Image] of it.</ref> This practice is also observed in many modern publications, such as the ''New Compact Bible Dictionary'' (Special Crusade Edition) of 1967 and ''Peloubet's Bible Dictionary'' of 1947.

Various Messianic Jewish Bible translations use ''Adonai'' ([[Messianic Bible translations|Complete Jewish Bible]] (1998), [[Messianic Bible translations|Tree of Life Version]] (2014) or ''Hashem'' ([[Messianic Bible translations|Orthodox Jewish Bible]] (2002)).

A few sacred name Bibles use the [[Tetragrammaton]] instead of a generic title (e.g., the LORD) or a conjectural transliteration (e.g., Yahweh or Jehovah):
* [[Sacred Name Bibles|The Scriptures (ISR) Version]] (1993, 1998, 2009)
* [[Sacred Name Bibles|Sacred Name King James Bible]] (2005).
* [[Sacred Name Bibles|HalleluYah Scriptures]] (2009, 2015).
* [[Literal English Version]] (2014)

Most modern translations exclusively use ''Lord'' or ''{{LORD}}'', generally indicating that the corresponding Hebrew is ''[[Yahweh]]'' or ''[[YHWH]]'' (not ''JHVH''), and in some cases saying that this name is "traditionally" transliterated as ''Jehovah'':<ref name=ESVpreface>English Standard Version Translation Oversight Committee [http://about.esvbible.org/about/preface/ Preface to the English Standard Version] Quote: "When the vowels of the word adonai are placed with the consonants of YHWH, this results in the familiar word Jehovah that was used in some earlier English Bible translations.

Following the [[Middle Ages]], before and after the [[Protestant Reformation]] some churches and public buildings across Europe were decorated with variants and cognates of "Jehovah". For example, the [[Coat of Arms]] of [[Plymouth#City Council|Plymouth]] (UK) City Council bears the Latin inscription, ''Turris fortissima est nomen Jehova''<ref>See [http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/cornwall_wessex.html#plymouth%20 CivicHeraldry.co.uk -Plymouth ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205725/http://civicheraldry.co.uk/cornwall_wessex.html#plymouth%20 |date=2016-11-20 }} and here [http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/plymouth.JPG].

Some lyrics of some Christian hymns<ref>e.g. [http://www.hymnsite.com/lyrics/umh127.sht "Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah"] (1771)</ref> include "Jehovah".

In [[Mormonism]], "Jehovah" is thought to be the name by which Jesus was known prior to his birth; references to "the {{LORD}}" in the KJV Old Testament are therefore understood to be references to the pre-mortal Jesus, whereas [[God the Father]], who is regarded as a separate individual, is sometimes referred to as "[[Elohim]]". "Jehovah" is twice rendered in the [[Book of Mormon]], in 2 Nephi 22:2 and Moroni 10:34.
