'''Section 28''' or '''Clause 28'''<ref group=note>While going through Parliament, the amendment was constantly relabelled with a variety of clause numbers as other amendments were added to or deleted from the [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]], but by the final version of the Bill, which received [[Royal Assent]], it had become Section 28.

The law's existence caused many groups to close or limit their activities or self-censor. For example, a number of [[LGBT|lesbian, gay and bisexual]] student support groups in schools and colleges across Britain were closed owing to fears by council legal staff that they could breach the act.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk/gleanings2889.html |title=Knitting Circle 1989 Section 28 gleanings |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818063344/http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk/gleanings2889.html |archivedate=18 August 2007}} on the site of [[South Bank University]].

==History==
===Background===
Section 28 originated in the transition in British society from homosexuality being illegal to legal but still discriminated against, following debate in the 1950s and the 1967 decriminalisation of [[gay sex]] for those over the age of 21 in the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]].<ref>[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1186262 Sexual Offences Act 1967 (c.60)], 1 November 2009</ref>

The 1980s was the era in which [[HIV/AIDS]] was first reported.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gallo RC|title=A reflection on HIV/AIDS research after 25 years|journal= Retrovirology|volume=3|page=72|year=2006|pmid=17054781|doi=10.1186/1742-4690-3-72|pmc=1629027|issue=1}}</ref>  The first recorded victims of the disease were a group of gay men,<ref name=MMWR2>{{Cite journal

Rising negative sentiments towards homosexuality peaked in 1987, the year before the legislation was enacted. According to the [[British Social Attitudes Survey]], 75% of the population said that homosexual activity was "always or mostly wrong", with just 11% believing it to be never wrong. Five years prior to the enactment, a similar BSAS poll had found that 61% of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and 67% of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] voters believed homosexual activity to be "always or mostly wrong".<ref name="Homosexuality ">{{cite web|publisher=BSAS|title=Homosexuality|url=http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-30/personal-relationships/homosexuality.aspx | accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>
The precursor was the publication in 1979 of LEA Arrangements for the School Curriculum, which required local authorities to publish their curriculum policies. Following the legalisation of homosexuality proposals for Scotland (added as an amendment to the 1980 criminal justice bill by Labour MP Robin Cook), guidance was published indicating that schools should not teach homosexuality as part of sex education lessons. This was part of a deal to ensure government support for legalisation of homosexuality in Scotland.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

This was followed, two years later, by the School Curriculum (25 March 1981), in which the secretaries of state (for Education and Wales) said they had decided to 'set out in some detail the approach to the school curriculum which they consider should now be followed in the years ahead'. Every local education authority was expected to frame policies for the school curriculum consistent with the government's 'recommended approach' (DES 1981a:5) which required teaching of only [[heterosexual]] [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] in schools.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) directly started funding LGBT groups, and between 1981 and 1984 grants totalling at least £292,548 were given by the GLC to a variety of small gay groups. Another £751,000 was committed towards the setting up of the ''London Lesbian and Gay Community Centre'' in Islington.<ref>Tingle,Rachel "Gay Lessons", Pickwick Books, 1986, p.8 and pp.44–45</ref> About ten of the 32 local authorities in London, most prominently Islington and Haringey were also funding gay groups at that time, one report estimating that these boroughs and the GLC together donated more than £600,000 to gay projects and groups during 1984.<ref>Sunday Telegraph, 6 October 1985.</ref>

In 1983, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that a copy of a book entitled ''[[Jenny lives with Eric and Martin]]'', portraying a young girl who lives with her father and his male partner, was provided in a school library run by the Labour-controlled [[Inner London Education Authority]]. More and more councils began to adopt wide-ranging anti-discrimination policies (particularly [[Ealing]], [[Haringey]], [[Islington]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] and [[Manchester]] who employed officers to counter homophobia).<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=200041&documentID=398&pageNumber=2|title=LGBT History: Real problems for real people|publisher=Manchester City Council|page=2|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611051241/http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=200041&documentID=398&pageNumber=2|archivedate=11 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The attention to this, and the alliances between LGBT and labour unions (including the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers (NUM)]]) – formed by activist groups such as [[Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners]] and [[Lesbians Against Pit Closures]] – led to the adoption at the Labour Party Annual Conference in 1985 of a resolution to criminalise discrimination against lesbian, gay and bisexual people. This legislation was supported by block voting from the NUM.<ref name=solidarity>[http://hwj.oxfordjournals.org/content/77/1/240.full?keytype=ref&ijkey=2vyGTx8tdxTUlMp "Solidarity and Sexuality: Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners 1984–5"].

But it was not until 1986 that major controversy arose and widespread protest demonstrations made a major contribution towards the subsequent passing of Section 28.<ref group=note>In autumn 1986 a group of parents in the north-east [[London Borough of Haringey]] began making complaints about a book that was available to school children. What started out as a request for the removal of one book, turned into a series of demonstrations (both for and against) on the streets of Wood Green and Tottenham and eventually on the streets of cities across the nation,.<br />Susanne Bosche [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/childrenandteens/story/0,6000,130836,00.html Jenny, Eric, Martin ... and me], ''The Guardian'', 31 January 2000.

During the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 election campaign]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] (under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]]) issued attack posters claiming that the Labour Party wanted the book ''[[Young, Gay and Proud]]'' to be read in schools, as well as ''Police: Out of School'', ''The Playbook for Kids about Sex'',<ref group=note>Authored by [[Joani Blank]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Sue|last2=Spraggs|first2=Gill|title=SECTION 28 AND EDUCATION|url=http://www.schools-out.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Section-28-and-Education-Sue-Sanders-Gillian-Spragg-1989.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Booth, Janine|title=The story of Section 28|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/node/1531|publisher=Workers' Liberty|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=December 1997}}</ref> and ''The Milkman's on his Way'',<ref group=note>Authored by [[David Rees (author)|David Rees]]</ref> which, according to the [[Monday Club]]'s [[Jill Knight]] [[Member of parliament|MP]] – who introduced Section 28 and later campaigned against [[same-sex marriage]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Baroness Knight: Parliament can't help blind people see, so can't help "artistic" gays get married|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/06/03/baroness-knight-parliament-cant-help-blind-people-see-so-cant-help-artistic-gays-get-married/|accessdate=24 May 2015|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|date=3 June 2013}}</ref> – were being taught to "little children as young as five and six", which contained "brightly coloured pictures of little stick men showed all about homosexuality and how it was done", and "explicitly described homosexual intercourse and, indeed, glorified it, encouraging youngsters to believe that it was better than any other sexual way of life".<ref name=Hansard1 />

{{quote|Why did I bother to go on with it and run such a dangerous gauntlet? ... I was contacted by parents who strongly objected to their children at school being encouraged into homosexuality and being taught that a normal family with mummy and daddy was outdated. To add insult to their injury, they were infuriated that it was their money, paid over as council tax, which was being used for this. This all happened after pressure from the Gay Liberation Front. At that time I took the trouble to refer to their manifesto, which clearly stated: "We fight for something more than reform. We must aim for the abolition of the family". That was the motivation for what was going on, and was precisely what Section 28 stopped.<ref name=Hansard1>Quoted in [[Hansard]], {{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo991206/text/91206-10.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930012922/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo991206/text/91206-10.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}, 6 December 1999, Column 1102.</ref>}}

===Legislation===
As a consequence of the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|DPP]] deciding that the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] could not prosecute the publishers of the ''Playbook for Kids about Sex'', and the start of local government spending on support groups for LGBT people, papers and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] backbench members of Parliament became concerned that left-wing councils or schools would provide children with pro-homosexual material or commend homosexuality to children,<ref group=note>See [[loony left]] and [[homosexual recruitment]]</ref> both described by parliamentarians backing the bill as morally wrong<ref group=note>See [[Mischief rule]]</ref> but which could be carefully policed by judges in applying a narrow sense to the meaning of the word ''promote''. In 1986 [[John Anthony Hardinge Giffard, 3rd Earl of Halsbury|Lord Halsbury]] first tabled the Local Government Act 1986 (Amendment) Bill,<ref name=hs/> whose [[long title]] was ''An act to refrain local authorities from promoting homosexuality'', in the [[House of Lords]], drafted for him by [[Alan Campbell, Baron Campbell of Alloway|Lord Campbell of Alloway]]. At the time, the incumbent Conservative government considered Halsbury's bill to be too misleading and risky. The bill successfully passed the House of Lords and Conservative MP [[Jill Knight|Dame Jill Knight]] had the bill pass the first stage in the Commons. However, impeded by the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], this Bill, commonly called the Earl of Halsbury's Bill failed.  Its provisions were not reintroduced by the government on its re-election.

Instead, on 2 December 1987 in committee, Conservative MP [[David Wilshire]] proposed an amendment to the new Local Government Bill, as not yet passed, debated as ''Clause 27'' and later as ''Clause 28'', intended to be equivalent to the Earl of Halsbury's Bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2000/rp00-047.pdf |title=The ''Local Government Bill'' [HL]: the 'section 28' debate |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128052721/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2000/rp00-047.pdf |archivedate=28 November 2007 }}</ref> The government agreed to support the tabling of the amendment in exchange for Knight forgoing her place on the [[Health and Medicines Act 1988|Health and Medicines Bill]] [[Public bill committee|standing committee]];<ref>{{cite news |title=The Diary |first=John |last=Street |newspaper=[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]] |date=25 December 1987 }}</ref> the amendment received the support of the Ministers for Local Government, [[Michael Howard (politician)|Michael Howard]] and [[Michael Portillo]]. On being tabled, a compromise amendment was introduced by [[Simon Hughes]] on 8 December 1987 that was debated in the House on 15 December 1987 and which was defeated by a majority of 87,<ref name=hs>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1987/dec/15/prohibition-on-promoting-homosexuality|title=PROHIBITION ON PROMOTING HOMOSEXUALITY BY TEACHING OR BY PUBLISHING MATERIAL|author=|date=|work=millbanksystems.com|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref> and the bill was approved on its first Commons debate that day.  The bill was read a first time in the Lords two days later.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1987/dec/17/local-government-bill Hansard from Millbank Systems Archive] 17 December 1987 col 906</ref>

[[Lord McIntosh of Haringey]] took up the mantle of Simon Hughes' amendments in the Lords' second reading, furthered by the [[Bishop of Manchester]], [[Stanley Booth-Clibborn]]:

{{quote|I should regret it if this Bill were to go through with this clause unamended. If it were to do so, I think it should certainly be confined to schools because otherwise there would be a real danger that some organisations which do good work in helping those with homosexual orientation, psychologically and in other ways, would be very much impeded.}}

A spectrum of literature across the ages was cited (in support of these compromise amendments) by [[Maurice Peston, Baron Peston|Lord Peston]]. Nonetheless the Bill passed second reading in the Lords before going to a whole house committee.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1988/jan/11/local-government-bill Hansard from Millbank Systems Archive] Second reading debate in Lords col 966</ref>

In that debate [[John Boyd-Carpenter, Baron Boyd-Carpenter|Lord Boyd-Carpenter]] cited a book display, and proposals for "gay books" to be present in a children's home and a gay pride week to be permissible in schools by named London councils. However, on questioning, he said, "of course, 'promotion' can be treated in different ways. If the clause becomes law it will be a matter for the courts to interpret in the sensible way in which the courts do interpret the law." The SDP peer [[Lucius Cary, 15th Viscount Falkland|Viscount Falkland]] with [[Peter Henderson, Baron Henderson of Brompton|Lord Henderson of Brompton]] proposed another compromise amendment, the so-called "Arts Council" amendment, and remarked "There is a suggestion in the clause that in no way can a homosexual have a loving, caring or responsible relationship".

[[Baron Somers|Lord Somers]] countered:

{{quote|One has only to look through the entire animal world to realise that it is abnormal. In any case, the clause as it stands does not prohibit homosexuality in any form; it merely discourages the teaching of it. When one is young at school one is very impressionable and may just as easily pick up bad habits as good habits.}}

The narrowing amendment failed by a majority of 55 voting against it; and the Lords voted the clause through the following day by a majority of 80.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1988/feb/01/local-government-bill Hansard from Millbank Systems Archive] Lords 1 February 1988 col 865–890</ref><ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1988/feb/02/local-government-bill Hansard from Millbank Systems Archive] Lords 2 February 1988 col 865–890</ref>

[[Michael Colvin]] MP thus on 8 March asked whether the minister, [[Christopher Chope]], would discuss with the Association of London Authorities the level of expenditure by local authorities in London on support for gay and lesbian groups to which he replied:

{{quote|No. Clause 28 of the Local Government Bill will ensure that expenditure by local authorities for the purpose of promoting homosexuality will no longer be permitted.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1988/mar/08/gay-and-lesbian-groups Hansard from Millbank Systems Archive] 8 March 1988 – House of Commons</ref>}}

The following day [[Tony Benn]] said during a debate in the House of Commons:

{{quote|...&nbsp;if the sense of the word "promote" can be read across from "describe", every murder play promotes murder, every war play promotes war, every drama involving the eternal triangle promotes adultery; and Mr. Richard Branson's condom campaign promotes fornication.

Mr Wilshire added that "there is an awful lot more promotion of homosexuality going on by local government outside classrooms", and the tempering amendments of that day's final debate were defeated by 53 votes.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1988/mar/09/business-of-the-house Hansard from Millbank Systems Archive] Lengthy debates of 9 March – House of Commons</ref>

Section 28 became law on 24 May 1988. The night before, several protests were staged by lesbian women, including [[abseiling]] into Parliament and an invasion of the [[BBC1]]'s ''[[BBC News at Six|Six O'Clock News]]'',<ref name="4letter">{{cite news |publisher=BBC |title=When gay became a four-letter word |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/611704.stm | date=20 January 2000 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> during which one woman managed to chain herself to [[Sue Lawley]]'s desk and was sat on by the newsreader [[Nicholas Witchell]].<ref>{{cite web|year=1998 |publisher=BBC |title=Nicholas Witchell |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/news/nicholaswitchell.shtml |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031011113338/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/news/nicholaswitchell.shtml |archivedate=11 October 2003 }}</ref>

===Controversy over applicability===
After Section 28 was passed, there was some debate as to whether it actually applied in schools or whether it applied only to local authorities. Whilst head teachers and Boards of Governors were specifically exempt, schools and teachers became confused as to what was actually permitted and tended to err on the side of caution.<!-- See below  for citations -->

A [[National Union of Teachers]] (NUT) statement remarked that "While Section 28 applies to local authorities and not to schools, many teachers believe, albeit wrongly, that it imposes constraints in respect of the advice and counselling they give to pupils. Professional judgement is therefore influenced by the perceived prospect of prosecution", and that it "limits the ability of local authorities to support schools in respect of learning and educating for equality. The effect of Section 28, therefore, is to inhibit anti discrimination initiatives and make it difficult for schools to prevent or address the serious problems that arise from homophobic bullying".<ref>{{cite web|title=NUT campaign to repeal Section 28|url=http://www.teachers.org.uk/story.php?id=2320|website=teachers.org.uk|publisher=National Union of Teachers|accessdate=24 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041225065954/http://www.teachers.org.uk/story.php?id=2320|archivedate=25 December 2004|date=5 April 2003|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Similarly, the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Science]] said that "Section 28 does not affect the activities of school governors, nor of teachers ... It will not prevent the objective discussion of homosexuality in the classroom, nor the counselling of pupils concerned about their sexuality",<ref name="briandeer.com" /> to which Knight responded by saying that "This has got to be a mistake. The major point of it was to protect children in schools from having homosexuality thrust upon them".<ref name="briandeer.com">Brian Deer, [http://briandeer.com/social/clause-28.htm Schools escape clause 28 in 'gay ban' fiasco] (Sunday Times).</ref> In response to these criticisms, supporters of the bill claimed that the NUT and Department of Education were mistaken, and the section did affect schools.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Some local authorities continued to deliver training to their staff in their education system on how to deliver their services without discrimination against gay people; [[Manchester City Council]] continued to sustain four officer posts directly involved in policy making and implementation, contributing to the 1992 report ''Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988: a Guide for Workers in the Education Service, produced by Manchester City Council, May 1992'', which proved that Section 28 did not prevent this work.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Before its repeal, Section 28 was already largely redundant: [[sex education]] in [[England and Wales]] has been regulated solely by the [[Secretary of State for Education]] since the [[Learning and Skills Act 2000]] and the [[Education Act 1996]]. Nevertheless, many campaigners still saw abolishing Section 28 as a "a symbolic measure against intolerance", and campaigned for its repeal.<ref name="BBC OVERVIEW">{{cite news|title=Section 28: An overview|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/848699.stm|accessdate=24 May 2015|work=BBC News|date=25 July 2000}}</ref>

The introduction of Section 28 served to galvanise the disparate British [[gay rights]] movement into action.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gillan|first1=Audrey|title=Section 28 gone ... but not forgotten|url=http://gu.com/p/qyv7/stw|accessdate=10 February 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 November 2003}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite news|last1=Godfrey|first1=Chris|title=Section 28 protesters 30 years on|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/27/section-28-protesters-30-years-on-we-were-arrested-and-put-in-a-cell-up-by-big-ben|accessdate=31 March 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 March 2018}}</ref> The resulting protest saw the rise of now famous groups like [[Stonewall (UK)|Stonewall]],<ref name="4letter" /> started by, amongst other people, [[Ian McKellen]] and [[Michael Cashman]], and [[OutRage!]].<ref name="4letter" /> ''Schools Out'' was formed in 1974 (as ''The Gay Teachers Association'')<ref name=SO1>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.schools-out.org.uk/?page_id=59|publisher=Schools Out|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> and campaigned against the act, as well as supporting teachers on how to counter homophobia in schools.<ref name=SO1 /> Many other groups not directly associated with LGBT rights also wanted the legislation removed, such as [[Gingerbread (charity)|Gingerbread]] (a charity for single mothers), the [[Family Planning Association]] and the [[Terrence Higgins Trust]].<ref name="BBC OVERVIEW" /> Many in the labour movement and trade unions also opposed the legislation.<ref name=solidarity />

===Repeal===
On 7 February 2000, the first attempted legislation to repeal Section 28 was introduced by the Labour Government as part of the Local Government Act 2000, but was defeated by a House of Lords campaign led by [[Janet Young, Baroness Young|Baroness Young]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Langdon|first1=Julia|title=Obituary: Lady Young of Farnworth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/07/guardianobituaries.obituaries|accessdate=22 May 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 September 2002}}</ref> The then [[Shadow Secretary of State for Education|Shadow Education Secretary]] and future [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Theresa May]] called the defeat "a victory for commonsense".<ref>{{cite news|title=Ministers back down on gay ban|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/850113.stm|work=BBC News|date=25 July 2000}}</ref>

Despite the previous reversals of the House of Commons by the House of Lords, backbench MPs introduced a fresh amendment to repeal Section 28 in England and [[Wales]] as part of another Local Government Bill in early 2003. In response to a further amendment tabled by Conservative MPs, that would have sent the matter to local referendums throughout the country, [[Edward Davey]] said "In a liberal democracy, the need to protect minorities properly sometimes means that protection cannot be achieved through the ballot box and that some things are not appropriate for a vote."<ref>{{cite web|title=Local Government Bill|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/a/st030213/am/30213s08.htm|publisher=www.parliament.uk|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> After a backlash over the party leadership's attitude to gay rights, the Conservative Party allowed its MPs and peers a free vote on the repeal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2664163.stm|title=Section 28 compromise avoids a crisis|date=16 January 2003|work=BBC News}}</ref> The amendment was supported by the government and was passed by the Commons in March, by 368 to 76.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2003-03-10&number=109|title=Local Government Bill – Repeal of prohibition on promotion of homosexuality|date=10 March 2003|publisher=[[Public Whip]]}}</ref> With organised opposition in the Lords weakened by the death of Baroness Young, peers finally voted in favour of repeal by 180 to 130 in July.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3120924.stm|title=Section 28 to be repealed|date=18 September 2003|work=BBC News}}</ref>

Newspapers that strongly supported Section 28 included ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

In Scotland the most visible supporters of Section 28 were [[Brian Souter]] and the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' newspaper.

The main argument in support of Section 28 was to protect children from "predatory homosexuals" and advocates seeking to "indoctrinate" vulnerable young people into homosexuality.<ref group=note>See [[Homosexual recruitment]]</ref> Various other arguments were also used in support of Section 28 which are summarised as follows:

* That promotion of homosexuality in schools undermines marriage.
* That Section 28 prohibited only the promotion, not legitimate discussion of homosexuality.
* That Section 28 did not prevent the counselling of pupils who are being bullied.
* Proponents pointed to various polls in an attempt to demonstrate that public opinion favoured keeping Section 28.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christian.org.uk/briefingpapers/section28.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010628201551/http://www.christian.org.uk/briefingpapers/section28.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 June 2001 |title=Apologetics - Section 28 |work=christian.org.uk |accessdate=29 September 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yougov.com/archives/pdf/TEL020101008.pdf|title=YouGov - What the world thinks|author=|date=|work=yougov.com|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mori.com/polls/2000/m000127.shtml|title=mori|work=mori.com|accessdate=29 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724020118/http://www.mori.com/polls/2000/m000127.shtml|archivedate=24 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/polls/2000/sh000121.shtml|title=Public Attitudes (In Scotland) To Section 28|last=Braunholtz|first=Simon|date=21 January 2000|work=Ipsos MORI|publisher=Sunday Herald|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123085225/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/polls/2000/sh000121.shtml|archivedate=23 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/mrr/2000/c000211.shtml|title=Section 28|first=Roger|last=Mortimore|date=11 February 2000|work=Ipsos MORI|publisher=Ipsos MORI|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123085208/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/mrr/2000/c000211.shtml|archivedate=23 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2000/rp00-047.pdf The Local Government Bill [HL&#x5D;: the 'Section 28' debate [Bill 87 of 1999–2000&#x5D;<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128052721/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2000/rp00-047.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}</ref>

[[Gay rights]] advocates, such as [[Stonewall (UK)|Stonewall]], [[OutRage!]], ''[[Capital Gay]]'', ''The [[Pink Paper]]'' and the ''[[Gay Times]]'' formed the major opposition to Section 28 and led the campaign for its repeal. Prominent individuals who spoke out for the repeal of Section 28 included [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], [[Michael Cashman]], [[Ivan Massow]], [[Mo Mowlam]], [[Simon Callow]], [[Annette Crosbie]], [[Michael Grade]], [[Jane Horrocks]], [[Michael Mansfield QC]], [[Helen Mirren]], [[Claire Rayner]], [[Ned Sherrin]] and [[Alan Moore]].<ref name="auto"/>

A packed benefit held at the [[Piccadilly Theatre]] on 5 June 1988 called "Before the Act" mustered over 60 performers, among them [[Timothy West]], [[Michael Cashman]], [[Simon Rattle]], [[Paul Eddington]], [[Maureen Lipman]], the [[Medici Quartet]], the [[Pet Shop Boys]], Maggie Ford, [[Sheila Hancock]], [[Jill Bennett (British actress)|Jill Bennett]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Richard Griffiths]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Joan Plowright]], [[Anthony Sher]], Ned Sherrin and Ian McKellen.

A coalition of comic book creators, including Alan Moore, [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], [[Robert Crumb]], [[Art Spiegelman]], [[Neil Gaiman]], and many others, produced a comic anthology called ''[[AARGH (Artists Against Rampant Government Homophobia)|AARGH]]'' and raised at least £17,000 to contribute to the fight against the legislation, according to Moore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blather.net/articles/amoore/brought-to-light2.html|title=Blather: The Alan Moore Interview: Brought to Light - deep politics / AARGH|author=|date=|work=blather.net|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref> [[Boy George]] wrote a song opposed to Section 28, entitled "No Clause 28". The band [[Chumbawamba]] recorded a single entitled "[[Smash Clause 28! Fight the Alton Bill!]]" which was an attack on Clause/Section 28 and a benefit for a gay rights group; it also featured 12 pages of hand printed notes relating to gay rights. The legislation was also opposed by some religious groups and leaders, such as [[Richard Harries]], [[Bishop of Oxford]]. Newspapers that came out in opposition included ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The Daily Mirror]]''.

Political parties that were opposed to Section 28 included the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]]. In the House of Lords the campaign for repeal was led by openly gay peer [[Waheed Alli]]. Perhaps the most famous act of opposition to Section 28 came when [[Shaun Woodward]], a Conservative MP with a transgender sister, defected from the Conservative Party and his seat and joined the ruling Labour Party in opposition to the Conservatives' continued support of Section 28.

The main point of argument claimed by opponents of Section 28 was the complaint that it discriminated against homosexuals and bisexuals, and hence was an [[Toleration|intolerant]] and unjust law. Various other arguments were also used against Section 28 which are summarised as follows:

* That, by excluding homosexual support groups and appearing to prevent teachers from protecting victims of [[homophobia|homophobic]] bullying, Section 28 was actually endangering vulnerable children.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
* The claim that Section 28 made the assumption that homosexuals were inherently dangerous to children, implying an association between homosexuality, bisexuality and [[pedophilia|paedophilia]], as obvious from the "predatory homosexuals" argument of the supporters of the law.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
* Not only did Section 28 prevent the active promotion of homosexuality but also it appeared to give a legal reason to oppose it in schools and other forums if necessary.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
* The claim that Section 28 was a law which gave an impression to the public that the government sanctioned homophobia.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
* The idea that homosexuality could be "promoted" implied that homosexuality was a choice which people could be persuaded to make, in contrast to the Section's opponents' view that homosexuality is biologically determined.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
* It was no longer relevant due to the Learning and Skills Act 2000 and the Education Act 1996.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==In retrospect==
Some prominent MPs who supported the bill when it was first introduced have since either expressed regret over their support, changed their stance due to different circumstances which have evolved over time, or have argued that the legislation is no longer necessary.

In an interview with gay magazine [[Attitude (magazine)|''Attitude'']] at the time of the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], [[Michael Howard]], then-[[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]], commented: "[Section 28] was brought in to deal with what was seen to be a specific problem at the time. The problem was the kind of literature that was being used in some schools and distributed to very young children that was seen to promote homosexuality... I thought, rightly or wrongly, that there was a problem in those days. That problem simply doesn't exist now. Nobody's fussed about those issues any more. It's not a problem, so the law shouldn't be hanging around on the statute book".<ref>[http://www.johannhari.com/archive/article.php?id=629 Johann Hari – Archive<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317054430/http://www.johannhari.com/archive/article.php?id=629 |date=17 March 2006 }}</ref>

In February 2006, then-[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Chairman [[Francis Maude]] told Pinknews.co.uk that the policy, which he had voted for, was wrong and a mistake.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC |title=Tories' gay stance 'was wrong' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4696236.stm | date=9 February 2006 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref>

In 2000, one year prior to his election to the House of Commons, Conservative Party member [[David Cameron]] repeatedly attacked the [[First Blair ministry|Labour Government]]'s plans to abolish Section 28, publicly criticising then-[[UK Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] as being "anti-family" and accusing him of wanting the "promotion of homosexuality in schools".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/dispatches/cameron+toff+at+the+top/328047|title=Channel 4 - News - Dispatches - Cameron: Toff At The Top|author=|date=|work=channel4.com|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref> At the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], Cameron was elected as the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Witney (UK Parliament constituency)|Witney]]; he continued to support Section 28, voting against its repeal in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jul/02/david-cameron-gay-pride-apology|title=David Cameron apologises to gay people for section 28|author=Patrick Wintour|date=|work=the Guardian|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref> The Labour Government were determined to repeal Section 28, and Cameron voted in favour of a Conservative amendment that retained certain aspects of the clause, which gay rights campaigners described as "Section 28 by the back door".<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/04/conservatives2006.conservatives1</ref> The Conservative amendment was unsuccessful, and Section 28 was repealed by the Labour Government without concession, with Cameron absent for the vote on its eventual repeal.

However, in June 2009, Cameron, then-Leader of the Conservative Party, formally apologised for his party's introduction of the law, stating that it was a mistake and had been offensive to gay people.<ref name=apology>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-sorry-for-section-28-1728003.html|title=Cameron sorry for Section 28|publisher=}}</ref> He restated this belief in January 2010, proposing to alter Conservative Party policy to reflect his belief that equality should be "embedded" in British schools.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jan/28/david-cameron-gay-equality | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Teaching about gay equality should be 'embedded' in schooling, says David Cameron | first=Nicholas | last=Watt | date=28 January 2010 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref>

In 2012, when the Conservative Party launched its consultation into legalising same-sex marriages, Harrow East MP [[Bob Blackman (politician)|Bob Blackman]] suggested that David Cameron should resurrect Section 28, stating that he strongly believed that "Section 28 was the right rules to have in school so that we should not promote in any way shape or form promote same-sex relationships" and said he would be "very opposed" to seeing teachers being forced to say same-sex relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships. Shortly after, Blackman's Labour predecessor [[Tony McNulty]] branded him a "complete idiot" on [[Twitter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/12/07/tory-mp-bob-blackman-cameron-should-be-re-introducing-section-28-not-letting-gays-marry/|title=Tory MP Bob Blackman: Cameron should be re-introducing Section 28 not letting gays marry|publisher=}}</ref>

In 2015, ''[[Pink News]]'' accused the [[Evangelical Alliance]]'s report to the [[Women and Equalities Committee|Women and Equalities Select Committee]]'s transgender inquiry, which said in part that "children should be protected from having to sort through [questions regarding sex or gender] before they reach an appropriate age" as reminiscent of Section 28.<ref>{{cite news|last1=O'Toole|first1=Michelle|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/10/14/parliament-told-to-make-new-section-28-to-prevent-kids-learning-about-trans-people/ |title=Parliament told to make 'new Section 28' to prevent kids learning about trans people|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=Pink News|date=14 October 2015}}</ref>

==Academies==
Section 28 received renewed attention in late 2011, when [[Michael Gove]], in Clause 28 of the Model Funding Agreement for [[Academy (English school)|academies]] and [[Free school (England)|free schools]], added the stipulation that the benefits of marriage be taught in schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/typesofschools/freeschools/a0074737/free-schools-model-funding-agreement|title=Opening a free school|author=|date=|work=education.gov.uk|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref> Although the clause does not explicitly mention sexual orientation, with same-sex marriage not being legal at the time, it prompted ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (traditionally supportive of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]) to draw comparisons between the two clauses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8933237/Free-schools-and-academies-must-promote-marriage.html|title=Free schools and academies must promote marriage|author=|date=3 December 2011|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref>

Academies and the Department for Education came under greater scrutiny in August 2013, when LGBT activists, in co-ordination with the [[British Humanist Association]] (BHA), identified over forty schools whose policies either replicated the language of Section 28 in their sex and relationship education (SRE) policies or were "unhelpfully vague" on the issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-return-of-section-28-schools-and-academies-practising-homophobic-policy-that-was-outlawed-under-tony-blair-8775249.html|title=The return of Section 28: Schools and academies practising homophobic|author=Nigel Morris|date=19 August 2013|work=The Independent|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref> Several of the schools highlighted by the BHA included the [[Evelyn Grace Academy]] chain of faith schools – which opened after the repeal of Section 28, [[Tasker-Milward V.C. School]], whose SRE policy, dating from 2008, implied the clause was still in force, and [[The Northumberland Church of England Academy]], who was listed as a School Champion by LGBT rights charity [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]] and whose staff spoke at Stonewall's 2013 Education for All Conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/2013/08/19/bha-identifies-44-schools-that-continue-to-have-section-28-like-policies/|title=BHA identifies 45 schools that continue to have section 28-like policies|author=|date=|work=British Humanist Association|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref> In light of the media coverage, the Welsh Government announced an investigation into the Tasker-Milward School,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/tasker-milward-section-28-investigation-5757914|title=Tasker Milward section 28 investigation - Wales Online|author=Simon Gaskell|date=20 August 2013|work=walesonline|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref> and the Department for Education, announcing its own investigation, stated that schools were prohibited under DfE guidance<!--and the Equality Act?--> from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/08/19/uk-government-no-schools-should-be-reintroducing-section-28/|title=UK Government: No schools should be reintroducing Section 28|author=|date=|work=PinkNews|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref>

''Next Lesson'' (2015) is a comedy drama written by Chris Woodley which explores Section 28 in a fictional South East London school from 1988 to 2006. The play was first performed at The [[Pleasance Islington|Pleasance Theatre]], London in 2015. To mark the thirty-year anniversary of Section 28 a new production was staged at [[Above The Stag Theatre]] London in August 2018. A staged reading was also performed in The [[House of Lords]] by The [[BRIT School]] in June 2018.

[[Russell T. Davies]] included a scene in the TV series ''[[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' with a classmate of the gay schoolboy Nathan stopping a teacher discussing an author's sexuality with "Section 28 says you can't talk about that, sir."{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
