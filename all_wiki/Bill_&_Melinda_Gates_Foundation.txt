[[File:B&M Gates Complex.jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters complex in Seattle as seen from the [[Space Needle]]]]

In 1994, the foundation was formed as the William H. Gates Foundation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are/General-Information/Leadership/Executive-Leadership-Team/William-H-Gates-Sr |title=William H Gates Sr |website=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation |language=en|access-date=April 17, 2018}}</ref> During the foundation's following years, funding grew to $2 billion. On June 15, 2006, Gates announced his plans to transition out of a day-to-day role with [[Microsoft]], effective July 31, 2008,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-15CorpNewsPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Announces Plans for July 2008 Transition for Bill Gates |publisher=Microsoft PressPass |date=June 15, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619230935/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-15CorpNewsPR.mspx |archive-date=June 19, 2006 }}</ref> to allow him to devote more time to working with the foundation. The first CEO of the foundation, until she stepped down in 2008, was [[Patty Stonesifer]].<ref name="test">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/07/us/07charity.html |title=Gates Foundation Head to Leave Longtime Post |date=February 7, 2008 |author=Stephanie Strom |accessdate=June 9, 2017 |via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

In 2005, [[Bill Gates|Bill]] and [[Melinda Gates]], along with the Irish rock musician [[Bono]], were named by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Persons of the Year 2005]] for their outstanding charitable work.<ref>{{Cite web |title=TIME names Bono, Bill and Melinda Gates Persons of Year - CNN.com |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/12/18/time.poy/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |website=www.cnn.com|access-date = February 5, 2016}}</ref> In the case of Bill and Melinda Gates, the work referenced was that of this foundation.

In April 2010, Gates was invited to visit and speak at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where he asked the students to take on the hard problems of the world in their futures. He also explained the nature and philosophy of his philanthropic endeavors.<ref>Guo, Jeff; McQueen, Rob,

(video & transcript). "After he spoke at Kresge Auditorium, Bill Gates sat down with The Tech to talk more about his college tour, his philanthropy, and the philosophy behind it."</ref>

In 2010, the foundation's founders started the Commission on Education of Health Professionals for the 21st Century, entitled "Transforming education to strengthen health systems in an interdependent world."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publichealthglobal.org/index.php?option=com_myblog&show=Providing-Affordable-Healthcare-Education.html&Itemid=92 |title=Public Health Global Watch |accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref>

A 2011 survey of grantees found that many believed the foundation did not make its goals and strategies clear and sometimes did not understand those of the grantees; that the foundation's decision- and grantmaking procedures were too opaque; and that its communications could be more consistent and responsive. The foundation's response was to improve the clarity of its explanations, make "orientation calls" to grantees upon awarding grants, tell grantees who their foundation contact is, give timely feedback when they receive a grantee report, and establish a way for grantees to provide anonymous or attributed feedback to the foundation.<ref>[http://www.gatesfoundation.org/learning/Pages/GranteeProgressReport2012.aspx Improving our Work with You: A Progress Report - Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127163816/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/learning/Pages/GranteeProgressReport2012.aspx |date=January 27, 2013 }}.

===Warren Buffett donation===
On June 25, 2006, [[Warren Buffett]] (then the world's richest person, estimated worth of $62 billion as of April 16, 2008) pledged to give the foundation approximately 10 million [[Berkshire Hathaway]] Class B [[share (finance)|shares]] (then valued at $3,071 each, before a 50-1 [[stock split]] in 2010) spread over multiple years through annual contributions, with the first year's donation of 500,000 shares being worth approximately $1.5 billion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Warren Buffett gives away his fortune |url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/06/25/magazines/fortune/charity1.fortune/index.htm |date=March 5, 2008 |work=Fortune |publisher=Time Warner via CNNMoney.com |accessdate=December 10, 2007 |first=Carol J. |last=Loomis |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128090517/https://money.cnn.com/2006/06/25/magazines/fortune/charity1.fortune/index.htm |archive-date=November 28, 2007| url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/34973846 |title=Berkshire Hathaway 'B' Shares Soar After Split |date=January 21, 2010}}</ref> Buffett set conditions so that these contributions do not simply increase the foundation's endowment, but effectively work as a matching contribution, doubling the foundation's annual giving. [[Bloomberg News]] noted, "Buffett's gift came with three conditions for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: Bill or Melinda Gates must be alive and active in its administration; it must continue to qualify as a charity; and each year it must give away an amount equal to the previous year's Berkshire gift, plus an additional amount equal to 5 percent of net [[asset]]s.

==Financials==
The foundation explains on its website that its trustees divided the organization into two entities: the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. The foundation section, based in Seattle, US, "focuses on improving health and alleviating extreme poverty", and its trustees are Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. The trust section manages "the investment assets and transfer proceeds to the foundation as necessary to achieve the foundation's charitable goals"—it holds the assets of Bill and Melinda Gates, who are the sole trustees, and receives contributions from Buffett.<ref name="Fin">{{cite web |title=Who We Are - Financials |url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are/General-Information/Financials |work=Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation |publisher=Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |year=2014}}</ref>

The foundation posts its audited financial statements and [[Form 990#Fiduciary reporting|990-PF]] forms on the "Financials" section of its website as they become available. At the end of 2012, the foundation registered a cash sum of $4,998,000, down from $10,810,000 at the end of 2011. Unrestricted net assets at the end of 2012 were worth $31,950,613,000, while total assets were worth $37,176,777,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION Consolidated Financial Statements |url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/~/media/GFO/Who%20We%20Are/Financials/12GatesFoundation_FS.pdf |publisher=KPMG |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |date=December 31, 2012}}</ref>

In March 2006, the foundation announced a $5 million grant for the [[International Justice Mission]] (IJM), a human rights organization based in Washington, D.C., US to work in the area of [[sex trafficking]]. The official announcement explained that the grant would allow the IJM to "create a replicable model for combating sex trafficking and slavery" that would involve the opening of an office in a region with high rates of sex trafficking, following research. The office was opened for three years for the following purposes: "conducting undercover investigations, training law enforcement, rescuing victims, ensuring appropriate aftercare, and seeking perpetrator accountability".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gates Foundation Awards $5 Million to Fight Sex Trafficking |url=http://www.philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/gates-foundation-awards-5-million-to-fight-sex-trafficking |work=Philanthropy News Digest |publisher=Foundation Center |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |date=March 21, 2006}}</ref>

The IJM used the grant money to found "Project Lantern" and established an office in the [[Philippines]] city of [[Cebu]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/gates-foundation-awards-5-million-to-fight-sex-trafficking |title=Gates Foundation Awards $5 Million to Fight Sex Trafficking |last=Center |first=Foundation |work=Philanthropy News Digest (PND)|access-date=January 4, 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/beyond-rescue/ |title=Beyond Rescue |last=Thrupkaew |first=Noy |date=October 8, 2009 |work=The Nation|access-date=January 4, 2018 |issn=0027-8378}}</ref> In 2010, the results of the project were published, in which the IJM stated that Project Lantern had led to "an increase in law enforcement activity in sex trafficking cases, an increase in commitment to resolving sex trafficking cases among law enforcement officers trained through the project, and an increase in services – like shelter, counseling and career training – provided to trafficking survivors". At the time that the results were released, the IJM was exploring opportunities to replicate the model in other regions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Project Lantern: Game-Changing Results in the Fight Against Trafficking |url=http://www.ijm.org/projectlantern |work=IJM |publisher=IJM |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |year=2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407080609/http://www.ijm.org/projectlantern|archive-date=April 7, 2014|url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Gates Cambridge Scholarships===
In October 2000, William Gates established the [[Gates Cambridge Scholarships]] which allow students and scholars from the U.S. and around the world to study at [[Cambridge University]], one of the top universities in the world. The Gates Cambridge Scholarship has often been compared to the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], given its similarly international scope and substantial endowment. In 2000, the Gates Foundation endowed the scholarship trust with $210 million to help outstanding graduate students outside of the [[United Kingdom]] study at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.gatescambridge.org/about |title=About |last=alex.corr |date=October 20, 2014 |work=Gates Cambridge|access-date=January 4, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The Gates Foundation has continued to contribute funds to expand the scholarship, making it one of the largest and best-endowed scholarships in the world. The Gates Cambridge Scholarship accepts less than 0.3% of applicants and remains extremely competitive. Each year, approximately 100 new graduate students from around the world receive funding to study at [[Cambridge University]].

The Water, Sanitation and Hygiene ([[WASH]]) program of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was launched in mid-2005 as a "Learning Initiative", and became a full-fledged program under the Global Development Division in early 2010.<ref name=":8"/> The foundation has since 2005 undertaken a wide range of efforts in the WASH sector involving research, experimentation, reflection, [[advocacy]], and field implementation. In 2009, the foundation decided to refocus its WASH effort mainly on [[sustainable sanitation]] services for the poor, using non-piped sanitation services (i.e. without the use of [[Sanitary sewer|sewers]]),<ref name=":8"/> and less on [[water supply]]. This was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other [[Official development assistance|donors]] and from governments, and because the foundation believed it had the potential to make a real difference through strategic investments.

In mid 2011, the foundation announced in its new "Water, Sanitation, Hygiene Strategy Overview" that its funding now focuses primarily on sanitation, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, because access to [[improved sanitation]] is lowest in those regions.<ref name=":0">BMGF (2011).

In mid 2011, the foundation stated that they had committed more than $265 million to the water, sanitation, and hygiene sector over the past five years, i.e. since about 2006.<ref name=":0" /> For the time period of about 2008 to mid-2015, all grants awarded to water, sanitation and hygiene projects totaled a value of around $650 million, according to the publicly available grant database.<ref name=":7" />

Since the launch of the "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge", more than a dozen research teams, mainly at universities in the U.S., Europe, India, China and South Africa, have received grants to develop innovative on-site and off-site waste treatment solutions for the urban poor. The grants were in the order of $400,000 for their first phase, followed by typically $1 million – 3 million for their second phase; many of them investigated resource recovery or processing technologies for [[excreta]] or [[fecal sludge]].<ref>Elisabeth von Muench, Dorothee Spuhler, Trevor Surridge, Nelson Ekane, Kim Andersson, Emine Goekce Fidan, Arno Rosemarin (2013) [http://www.susana.org/_resources/documents/default/2-2042-ssp-17okt20134-10-about-the-gates-sanitation-grants-on-forum.pdf Sustainable Sanitation Alliance members take a closer look at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's sanitation grants], Sustainable Sanitation Practice Journal, Issue 17, p. 4-10</ref>

The "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge" is focused on "reinventing the [[flush toilet]]". The aim was to create a toilet that not only removes [[pathogen]]s from human [[excreta]], but also [[resource recovery|recovers resources]] such as energy, clean water, and [[nutrient]]s (a concept also known as [[reuse of excreta]]). It should operate "[[off-the-grid]]" without connections to water, sewer, or electrical networks. Finally, it should costs less than 5 cents per user per day.<ref name=":5" /><ref name="Shaw" />

High-tech toilets for tackling the growing public health problem of [[human waste]] are gaining increasing attention, but this focus on a "technology fix" has also been criticized by many in the sector.<ref name=":4" /> However, low-tech solutions may be more practical in poor countries, and research is also funded by the foundation for such toilets.<ref name="Shaw">{{cite book |url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1993 |title=A Collection of Contemporary Toilet Designs |date=2014 |publisher=EOOS and WEDC, Loughborough University, UK |isbn=978-1-84380-155-9 |pages=40 |last1=Shaw |first1=R.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Reinventing the toilet for 2.5 billion in need |doi=10.2471/BLT.14.020714 |pmid=25110370 |last=Humphreys |first=Gary |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=92 |issue=7 |pages=470–471 |publisher=Bull World Health Organ 2014;92:470–471 |year=2014 |pmc=4121873}}</ref>

The Reinvent the Toilet Challenge is a long-term research and development effort to develop a hygienic, stand-alone toilet. This challenge is being complemented by another investment program to develop new technologies for improved [[Fecal sludge management|pit latrine emptying]] (called by the foundation the "Omni-Ingestor"<ref>Frederick, R., Gurski, T. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1718 Synapse Dewatering Investigation Report - Omni-Ingestor Phase 2, Milestone 1]. Consultancy report by Synapse (USA) commissioned by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, USA</ref>) and [[Septage|fecal sludge]] processing (called "[[Omni-Processor]]"). The aim of the "Omni Processor" is to convert [[excreta]] (for example [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]]) into beneficial products such as energy and soil nutrients with the potential to develop local business and revenue.<ref>Kuchenrither, R.

==United States division==
Under President [[Allan Golston]], the United States Program has made grants such as the following:

===Donation to Planned Parenthood===
Up to 2013, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided $71 million to [[Planned Parenthood]] and affiliated organizations. In 2014, Melinda Gates has stated that the foundation "has decided not to fund abortion", focusing instead on family planning and contraception in order to avoid conflation of abortion and family planning.<ref name="melindablog"/> In response to questions about this decision, Gates stated in a June 2014 blog post that "[she], like everyone else, struggle[s] with the issue" and that "the emotional and personal debate about abortion is threatening to get in the way of the lifesaving consensus regarding basic family planning".<ref name="melindablog">{{cite web |title=Reflections on My Recent Travels |first=Melinda |last=Gates |publisher=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation |date=June 2, 2014 |url=http://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2014/06/Reflections-on-My-Trip-to-Toronto |accessdate=June 15, 2014}}</ref> Since this time, their endeavors have shifted to a more global perspective, focusing on voluntary family planning and maternal and newborn health.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Family-Planning |title=Family Planning |website=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation |language=en|access-date=July 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/Maternal-Newborn-and-Child-Health-Discovery-and-Tools |title=Maternal, Newborn & Child Health Discovery & Tools |website=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation |language=en|access-date=July 20, 2018}}</ref>

===Libraries===
In 1997, the charity introduced a U.S. Libraries initiative with a goal of "ensuring that if you can get to a public library, you can reach the internet". Only 35% of the world's population has access to the Internet.<ref name="Bill 2014">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. (2014). "What We Do: Global Libraries Strategy Overview." The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Retrieved from http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Global-Libraries</ref> The foundation has given grants, installed computers and software, and provided training and technical support in partnership with public libraries nationwide in an effort to increase access and knowledge.<ref name="Bill 2014"/> Helping provide access and training for these resources, this foundation helps move public libraries into the digital age.<ref name="Bill 2014"/>

Most recently, the foundation gave a $12.2 million grant to the [[Southeastern Library Network]] (SOLINET) to assist libraries in Louisiana and Mississippi on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], many of which were damaged or destroyed by [[Hurricane Katrina|Hurricanes Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]].

===Education===
A key aspect of the Gates Foundation's U.S. efforts involves an overhaul of the country's education policies at both the K-12 and college levels, including support for teacher evaluations and charter schools and opposition to seniority-based layoffs and other aspects of the education system that are typically backed by teachers' unions.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/education/22gates.html |title=Behind Grass-Roots School Advocacy, Bill Gates |date=May 22, 2011 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 17, 2016}}</ref> It spent $373 million on education in 2009.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> It has also donated to the two largest national teachers' unions.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> The foundation was the biggest early backer of the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]].<ref name="nytimes.com"/> In October 2017 it was announced that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation would spend more than $1.7 billion over five years to pay for new initiatives in public education.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/10/19/bill-gates-has-another-plan-for-k-12-public-education-the-others-didnt-go-so-well/ |title=Analysis {{!}} Bill Gates has a(nother) billion-dollar plan for K-12 public education.

One of the foundation's goals is to lower poverty by increasing the number of college graduates in the United States, and the organization has funded "Reimagining Aid Design and Delivery" grants to think tanks and advocacy organizations to produce white papers on ideas for changing the current system of federal financial aid for college students, with a goal of increasing graduation rates.<ref name="chronicle.com">{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Gates-Effect/140323/ |title=Marc Parry, Kelly Field, & Beckie Supiano, "The Gates Effect", The Chronicle of Higher Education, July 13, 2014 |newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Reimagining Financial Aid |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/03/14/look-all-15-reimagining-aid-design-and-delivery-reports-gates-foundation |website=Inside Higher Education |accessdate=December 21, 2014 |date=March 24, 2013 |author=Libby A.

As part of its education-related initiatives, the foundation has funded journalists, think tanks, lobbying organizations and governments. Millions of dollars of grants to news organizations have funded reporting on education and higher education, including more than $1.4 million to the Education Writers Association to fund training for journalists who cover education.<ref name="shape conversation">{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.com/article/To-Shape-the-National/140297/ |title=Jennifer Ruark, "To Shape the National Conversation, Gates and Lumina Support Journalism," The Chronicle of Higher Education, July 14, 2013 |newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}</ref>

Some of the foundation's educational initiatives have included:
* [[Gates Cambridge Scholarships]]: In 2000, the Gates Foundation donated $210 million to help outstanding graduate students from the U.S. and around the world to study at the prestigious [[University of Cambridge]]. The Gates Cambridge Scholarship has often been compared to the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] given its international scope and substantial endowment, The scholar remains extremely competitive with just 0.3% of applicants being selected. Each year, approximately 100 new graduate students from around the world receive funding to attend [[Cambridge University]]. Several buildings at the [[University of Cambridge]] also bear the name of William and Melinda Gates after sizable contributions to their construction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gates.scholarships.cam.ac.uk/ |title=gates.scholarships.cam.ac.uk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509054021/http://www.gates.scholarships.cam.ac.uk/ |archive-date=May 9, 2015}}</ref>

==Reception and reforms==
===Education programs===

Some critics fear that the foundation directs the conversation on education or pushing its point of view through news coverage. The foundation has said it lists all its grants publicly and does not enforce any rules for content among its grantees, who have editorial independence.<ref name="nytimes.com"/><ref name="shape conversation"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Storytelling Matters: A Look at the Gates Foundation's Media Grantmaking |url=http://www.impatientoptimists.org/Posts/2012/02/Storytelling-Matters-A-Look-at-the-Gates-Foundations-Media-Grantmaking |publisher=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation |accessdate=December 21, 2014 |date=February 21, 2012}}</ref> Union activists in Chicago have accused Gates Foundation grantee Teach Plus, which was founded by new teachers and advocates against seniority-based layoffs, of "[[astroturfing]]".<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

The K-12 and higher education reform programs of the Gates Foundation have been criticized by some education professionals, parents, and researchers because they have driven the conversation on education reform to such an extent that they may marginalize researchers who do not support Gates' predetermined policy preferences.<ref name="chronicle.com"/> Several Gates-backed policies such as small schools, charter schools, and increasing class sizes have been expensive and disruptive, but some studies indicate they have not improved educational outcomes and may have caused harm.<ref name="dissent">{{cite web |url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/got-dough-how-billionaires-rule-our-schools |title=Joanne Barkan, Got Dough? How Billionaires Rule Our Schools, Dissent Magazine, Winter 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/10/08/an-educator-challenges-the-gates-foundation/ |title=Valerie Strauss, An educator challenges the Gates Foundation, The Washington Post, Oct. 8, 2014 |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>

Examples of some of the K-12 reforms advocated by the foundation include closing ineffective neighborhood schools in favor of privately run [[Charter schools in the United States|charter schools]]; extensively using standardized test scores to evaluate the progress of students, teachers, and schools; and merit pay for teachers based on student test scores. Critics also believe that the Gates Foundation exerts too much influence over public education policy without being accountable to voters or taxpayers.

===Global health division===
A 2007 investigation by ''The [[Los Angeles Times]]''<ref name="LA"/> claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundation's allocation of aid towards the fight against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. First, sub-Saharan Africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the Gates Foundation, but "by pouring most contributions into the fight against such high-profile killers as AIDS, Gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained, higher-paid clinicians, diverting staff from basic care" in sub-Saharan Africa. This "brain drain" adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers. Second, "the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation".<ref name="LA" /> Third, "Gates-funded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations cannot prevent".<ref name="LA" />

In response, the Gates Foundation has said that African governments need to spend more of their budgets on public health than on wars, that the foundation has donated at least $70 million to help improve nutrition and [[agriculture]] in Africa, in addition to its disease-related initiatives and that it is studying ways to improve the delivery of health care in Africa.<ref name="LA"/>

Both insiders and external critics have suggested that there is too much deference to Bill Gates's personal views within the Gates Foundation, insufficient internal debate, and pervasive "group think."<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/12/bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation |title=Inside the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 12, 2010 |first=Andy |last=Beckett}}</ref> Critics also complain that Gates Foundation grants are often awarded based on social connections and ideological allegiances rather than based on formal external review processes or technical competence.<ref name="theguardian.com"/>

Critics have suggested that Gates' approach to Global Health and Agriculture favors the interests of large pharmaceutical and agribusiness companies (in which Gates invests) over the interests of the people of developing countries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ghwatch.org/sites/www.ghwatch.org/files/d1.3.pdf |title=The Gates Foundation |website=Global Health Watch|access-date=January 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://newint.org/features/2012/04/01/bill-gates-charitable-giving-ethics/ |title=The flip side to Bill Gates' charity billions -- New Internationalist |first=Andrew |last=Bowman |date=April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/cbertini/Media/Kristi_Heim.pdf |title=Professor Catherine Bertini |accessdate=December 17, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.humanosphere.org/social-business/2014/10/critics-say-gates-foundations-agriculture-program-wont-help-poor-farmers/ |title=Critics say Gates Foundation's agriculture program won't help poor farmers |author=Guest |work=Humanosphere |date=October 13, 2014}}</ref>

===AGRA and Monsanto===
The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) is a development aid organization founded in 2006 by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the Rockefeller Foundation with a focus on Africa. Criticism is expressed of the personnel links between the BMGF's Executive Board and Monsanto.<ref>https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Bill-Gates-zwischen-Schein-und-Sein-3378037.html</ref> AGRA's economic connection to groups such as Monsanto, Cargill, DuPont, Dow Chemical, BASF and Bayer together with the fact that the BMGF holds a significant proportion of the company's shares lead to criticism. In particular the promotion of the use of chemical fertilizers and hybrid seeds leading to the destruction of grown [[smallholding|smallholder]] structures and an increase in Africa’s dependence on large corporations is being criticized.<ref>https://www.welt-ernaehrung.de/2013/08/19/bill-gates-in-afrika/</ref> 

===Modi Goalkeepers Award===
On September 24, 2019, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave its [[Goalkeepers (Gates Foundation)|Goalkeepers]] Global Goals award to Indian prime minister [[Narendra Modi]]. The decision to award Modi was widely criticized by academics, Nobel Prize laureates, and human rights activists from all over the world.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/23/dismay-at-gates-foundation-prize-for-narendra-modi |title=Dismay at Gates Foundation prize for Narendra Modi &#124; Letters |date=September 23, 2019 |via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/commentisfree/2019/sep/24/narendra-modi-gates-foundation-award-donald-trump |title=The Gates Foundation shouldn't legitimise Narendra Modi &#124; Gloria Steinem and Akeel Bilgrami |first1=Gloria |last1=Steinem |first2=Akeel |last2=Bilgrami |date=September 24, 2019 |via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49738605 |title='Toilet trouble' for Narendra Modi and Bill Gates |first=Aparna |last=Alluri |date=September 23, 2019 |via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> A petition signed by over 100,000 people also demanded that the Gates Foundation rescind the award.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.stopgenocide.org/ |title=Don't reward fascism.

===Poverty and education policy===
Critics say the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has overlooked the links between poverty and poor academic achievement and has unfairly demonized teachers for poor achievement by underprivileged students. They contend that the Gates Foundation should be embracing anti-poverty and living wage policies rather than pursuing untested and empirically unsupported education reforms.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/04/21/how-bill-gates-and-fellow-billionaires-can-actually-help-public-education/ |title=Valerie Strauss, How Bill Gates and fellow billionaires can actually help public education, The Washington Post, April 21, 2014 |work=Washington Post}}</ref>

Critics say that Gates-backed reforms such as increasing the use of technology in education may financially benefit Microsoft and the Gates family.<ref name="chronicle.com"/><ref>Lyndsey Layton, How Bill Gates pulled off the swift Common Core revolution, Washington Post, June 7, 2014</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bill-gates-pulled-off-the-swift-common-core-revolution/2014/06/07/a830e32e-ec34-11e3-9f5c-9075d5508f0a_story.html?hpid=z1 |title=Mark Walsh, The Washington Post's 'Tense' Talk With Bill Gates on Common Core, June 8, 2014 |work=Washington Post}}</ref>

As a result, its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries where the foundation is attempting to relieve poverty.<ref name=":6" /><ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2007/1/9/report_gates_foundation_causing_harm_with Report: Gates Foundation Causing Harm With the Same Money It Uses To Do Good], Democracy Now!, January 9, 2007</ref> These include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gatesx07jan07,0,6827615.story Dark cloud over good works of Gates Foundation], Los Angeles Times, January 7, 2007</ref>
In response to press criticism, the foundation announced in 2007 a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003517601_gatesinvest10.html Gates Foundation to review investments] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516015458/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003517601_gatesinvest10.html |date=May 16, 2007 }}, The Seattle Times, January 10, 2007</ref> It subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.<ref>[Gates Foundation to maintain its investment plan], The Austin Statesman, January 14, 2007</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/181342/how-gates-foundations-investments-are-undermining-its-own-good-works |title=How the Gates Foundation's Investments Are Undermining Its Own Good Works }}</ref>

Critics have called on the Gates Foundation to [[Financial endowment#Divestment campaigns and impact investing|divest]] from the [[GEO Group]], the second-largest private prison corporation in the United States. A large part of the prison's work involves incarcerating and detaining migrants that have been detained by the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] and now the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]].<ref name="prisonlegalnews.org">Joe Watson, "Demonstrators Protest Gates Foundation's $2.2 Million Investment in GEO Group," "Prison Legal News," July 2016 https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2016/jul/6/demonstrators-protest-gates-foundations-22-million-investment-geo-group/</ref><ref>2012 tax return uploaded to this web page: http://www.iamawake.co/revealed-bill-gates-invests-billions-in-fast-food-private-prison-and-oil-companies/</ref><ref>Madison Pauly, "A Brief History of America's Private Prison Industry," "Mother Jones," July/August 2016 https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/history-of-americas-private-prison-industry-timeline/</ref> In spring 2014 the Gates Foundation acknowledged its $2.2 million investment in the prison corporation.<ref>Lael Henterly, "Gates Foundation resists pressure to pull private prison investment," "The Seattle Globalist," May 8, 2014 http://www.seattleglobalist.com/2014/05/08/gates-foundation-private-prison-investments-geo-nwdc/24430</ref> It has more recently rebuffed critics' request that it sever investment ties with the prison corporation.

==Lifespan==
In October 2006, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was split into two entities: the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, which manages the endowment assets and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which "...&nbsp;conducts all operations and grantmaking work, and it is the entity from which all grants are made".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.philanthropy.com/free/update/2006/11/2006112901.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220226/http://www.philanthropy.com/free/update/2006/11/2006112901.htm|url-status=dead |title=Gates Foundation Announces That It Doesn't Plan to Operate Forever |archive-date=September 27, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/Announcements/Announce-061129.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815085113/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/Announcements/Announce-061129.htm|url-status=dead |title=About the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust |archive-date=August 15, 2008}}</ref> Also announced was the decision to spend all of the foundation's resources within 50 years after Bill's and Melinda's deaths.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/Announcements/Announce-061129.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815085113/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/Announcements/Announce-061129.htm|url-status=dead |title=Announcements - Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation<!-- Bot generated title --> |archive-date=August 15, 2008}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://philanthropy.com/article/Gates-Foundation-Announces/55464/ |title=The Chronicle, 11/29/2006: Gates Foundation Announces That It Doesn't Plan to Operate Forever |work=The Chronicle of Philanthropy}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation sets lifespan |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gates-foundation/bill-melinda-gates-foundation-sets-lifespan-idUSN0125394420061201 |work=Reuters |date=December 1, 2006 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116493514082937519?mod=home_whats_news_us |title=Gates Foundation Sets Its Lifespan |first=Sally |last=Beatty |date=December 1, 2006 |work=WSJ}}</ref> This was later lowered to within 20 years of their death.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBHJ-8Bch4E |title=Interview with Bill Gates September 21, 2013 (Video 33:52) |work=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Foundation Trust |url=https://www.gatesfoundation.org/who-we-are/general-information/financials/foundation-trust |website=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation |language=en}}</ref> This would close the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust and effectively end the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In the 2006 announcement, it was reiterated that [[Warren Buffett]] "...&nbsp;has stipulated that the proceeds from the Berkshire Hathaway shares he still owns at death are to be used for philanthropic purposes within 10 years after his estate has been settled".<ref name="autogenerated2" />

The plan to close the Foundation Trust is in contrast to most large charitable foundations that have no set closure date. This is intended to lower administrative costs over the years of the Foundation Trust's life and ensure that the Foundation Trust not fall into a situation where the vast majority of its expenditures are on administrative costs, including salaries, with only token amounts contributed to charitable causes.<ref name="autogenerated1" />
