{{History of private equity and venture capital}}
'''Venture capital''' ('''VC''') is a form of [[private equity]] [[financing]] that is provided by venture capital firms or [[funds]] to [[start-up company|startups, early-stage, and emerging companies]] that have been deemed to have high growth potential or which have demonstrated high growth (in terms of number of employees, annual revenue, scale of operations, etc). Venture capital firms or funds invest in these early-stage companies in exchange for [[Equity (finance)|equity]], or an ownership stake. Venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky [[Startup company|start-ups]] in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful. Because [[Startup company|startups]] face high uncertainty,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Schmitt|first1=Antje|last2=Rosing|first2=Kathrin|last3=Zhang|first3=Stephen X.|last4=Leatherbee|first4=Michael|date=2017-09-21|title=A Dynamic Model of Entrepreneurial Uncertainty and Business Opportunity Identification: Exploration as a Mediator and Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy as a Moderator|journal=Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice|volume=42|issue=6|language=en|pages=835–859|doi=10.1177/1042258717721482|issn=1042-2587}}</ref> VC investments have high rates of failure. The start-ups are usually based on an [[innovation|innovative technology]] or [[business model]] and they are usually from the [[high technology]] industries, such as [[information technology]] (IT), [[clean technology]] or [[biotechnology]].
[[File:Startup Financing Cycle.png|thumb|right|400px|A financing diagram illustrating how [[start-up company|start-up companies]] are typically financed. First, the new firm seeks out "[[seed capital]]" and funding from "[[angel investor]]s" and [[Seed accelerator|accelerators]]. Then, if the firm can survive through the "[[:wikt:valley of death|valley of death]]"–the period where the firm is trying to develop on a "shoestring" budget–the firm can seek venture capital financing.]]

The typical venture capital investment occurs after an initial "[[seed funding]]" round. The first round of institutional venture capital to fund growth is called the [[Series A round]]. Venture capitalists provide this financing in the interest of generating a [[Profit (economics)|return]] through an eventual "exit" event, such as the company selling shares to the public for the first time in an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) or doing a [[mergers and acquisitions|merger and acquisition]] (also known as a "trade sale") of the company. Alternatively, an exit may come about via the [[private equity secondary market]].

In addition to [[angel investing]], [[equity crowdfunding]] and other [[seed funding]] options, venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise [[capital (economics)|capital]] in the [[financial market|public market]]s and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a [[loan|bank loan]] or complete a [[debt|debt offering]]. In exchange for the high [[Financial risk|risk]] that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and early-stage companies, venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions, in addition to a significant portion of the companies' ownership (and consequently value). Start-ups like [[Uber]], [[Airbnb]], [[Flipkart]], [[Xiaomi]] & [[Didi Chuxing]] are highly valued startups, commonly known as "Unicorns", where venture capitalists contribute more than financing to these early-stage firms; they also often provide strategic advice to the firm's executives on its [[business model]] and marketing strategies.

Venture capital is also a way in which the [[Private sector|private]] and [[public sector]]s can construct an institution that systematically creates [[business network]]s for the new firms and industries so that they can progress and develop. This institution helps identify promising new firms and provide them with finance, technical expertise, [[mentoring]], talent acquisition, strategic partnership, marketing "know-how", and [[business model]]s. Once integrated into the business network, these firms are more likely to succeed, as they become "nodes" in the search networks for designing and building products in their domain.<ref>Article: The New Argonauts, Global Search And Local Institution Building.  Author : Saxeninan and Sabel</ref> However, venture capitalists' decisions are often biased, exhibiting for instance overconfidence and illusion of control, much like entrepreneurial decisions in general.<ref>{{cite journal |author= S.X.

==History==
===Origins of modern venture capital===
Before [[World War II]] (1939–1945) venture capital was primarily the domain of wealthy individuals and families. [[JP Morgan]], the [[Wallenberg family|Wallenbergs]], the [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]], the [[Whitney family|Whitneys]], the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], and the [[Warburg family|Warburgs]] were notable investors in private companies. In 1938, [[Laurance S. Rockefeller]] helped finance the creation of both [[Eastern Air Lines]] and [[Douglas Aircraft]], and the Rockefeller family had vast holdings in a variety of companies. [[Eric M. Warburg]] founded [[E.M. Warburg & Co.]] in 1938, which would ultimately become [[Warburg Pincus]], with investments in both [[leveraged buyouts]] and venture capital. The [[Wallenberg family]] started [[Investor AB]] in 1916 in Sweden and were early investors in several Swedish companies such as [[ABB]], [[Atlas Copco]], and [[Ericsson]] in the first half of the 20th century. ([[History of private equity and venture capital|History of venture capital]])

Only after 1945 did "true" venture capital investment firms begin to emerge, notably with the founding of [[American Research and Development Corporation]] (ARDC) and [[J.H. Whitney & Company]] in 1946.<ref>

[[Georges Doriot]], the "father of venture capitalism",<ref>

ARDC became the first institutional private-equity investment firm to raise capital from sources other than wealthy families. Unlike most present-day venture capital firms, ARDC was a publicly-traded company. ARDC's most successful investment was its 1957 funding of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC), which would later be valued at more than $355 million after its initial public offering in 1968. This represented a return of over 1200 times its investment and an [[internal rate of return|annualized rate of return]] of 101% to ARDC.<ref>Ante, Spencer E.. Creative capital: Georges Doriot and the birth of venture capital. Boston, Harvard Business Press, 2008.</ref>

Former employees of ARDC went on to establish several prominent venture capital firms including [[Greylock Partners]], founded in 1965 by Charlie Waite and Bill Elfers; Morgan, Holland Ventures, the predecessor of Flagship Ventures, founded in 1982 by James Morgan; Fidelity Ventures, now [[Volition Capital]], founded in 1969 by Henry Hoagland; and [[Charles River Ventures]], founded in 1970 by Richard Burnes.<ref>

</ref> ARDC continued investing until 1971, when Doriot retired. In 1972 Doriot merged ARDC with [[Textron]] after having invested in over 150 companies.

[[John Hay Whitney]] (1904–1982) and his partner [[Benno C. Schmidt, Sr.|Benno Schmidt]] (1913–1999) founded [[J.H. Whitney & Company]] in 1946. Whitney had been investing since the 1930s, founding [[Pioneer Pictures]] in 1933 and acquiring a 15% interest in [[Technicolor Corporation]] with his cousin [[Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney]]. Florida Foods Corporation proved Whitney's most famous investment. The company developed an innovative method for delivering nutrition to American soldiers, later known as [[Minute Maid]] orange juice and was sold to [[The Coca-Cola Company]] in 1960. [[J.H. Whitney & Company]] continued to make investments in [[leveraged buyout]] transactions and raised $750 million for its sixth [[institutional investor|institutional]] [[private equity fund]] in 2005.

One of the first steps toward a professionally managed venture capital industry was the passage of the [[Small Business Investment Act of 1958]]. The 1958 Act officially allowed the U.S. [[Small Business Administration]] (SBA) to license private "Small Business Investment Companies" (SBICs) to help the financing and management of the small entrepreneurial businesses in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/inv/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-18 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218180213/http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/inv/index.html |archive-date=December 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }} Small Business Administration Investment Division (SBIC)</ref> The Small Business Investment Act of 1958 provided tax breaks that helped contribute to the rise of private equity firms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dilger |first1=Robert J. |title=SBA Small Business Investment CompanyProgram |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41456.pdf |website=Congressional Research Service |accessdate=8 July 2019 |page=1 |date=4 April 2019}}</ref>

During the 1950s, putting a venture capital deal together may have required the help of two or three other organizations to complete the transaction. It was a business that was growing very rapidly, and as the business grew, the transactions grew exponentially.<ref>Lea, Charles. “Tape 4- Charles Lea”. Interview by Charles Rudnick. ''National Venture Capital Association Venture Capital Oral History Project Funded by Charles W. Newhall III''. September 18, 2008.</ref>

During the 1960s and 1970s, venture capital firms focused their investment activity primarily on starting and expanding companies. More often than not, these companies were exploiting breakthroughs in electronic, medical, or data-processing technology. As a result, venture capital came to be almost synonymous with technology finance. An early West Coast venture capital company was Draper and Johnson Investment Company, formed in 1962<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.draperco.com/history.html |title = www.draperco.com |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002093836/http://www.draperco.com/history.html |archive-date=October 2, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> by [[William Henry Draper III]] and Franklin P. Johnson, Jr. In 1965, [[Sutter Hill Ventures]] acquired the portfolio of Draper and Johnson as a founding action. Bill Draper and Paul Wythes were the founders, and Pitch Johnson formed Asset Management Company at that time.

It was also in the 1960s that the common form of [[private equity fund]], still in use today, emerged. [[Private equity firm]]s organized [[limited partnership]]s to hold investments in which the investment professionals served as [[general partner]] and the investors, who were passive [[limited partners]], put up the capital. The compensation structure, still in use today, also emerged with limited partners paying an annual management fee of 1.0–2.5% and a [[carried interest]] typically representing up to 20% of the profits of the partnership.

The growth of the venture capital industry was fueled by the emergence of the independent investment firms on [[Sand Hill Road]], beginning with [[Kleiner Perkins]] and [[Sequoia Capital]] in 1972. Located in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park, CA]], Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia and later venture capital firms would have access to the many [[semiconductor]] companies based in the [[Santa Clara Valley]] as well as early [[computer]] firms using their devices and programming and service companies.{{NoteTag|In 1971, a series of articles entitled "Silicon Valley USA" were published in the [[Electronic News]], a weekly trade publication, giving rise to the use of the term [[Silicon Valley]].}}

Throughout the 1970s, a group of private equity firms, focused primarily on venture capital investments, would be founded that would become the model for later leveraged buyout and venture capital investment firms. In 1973, with the number of new venture capital firms increasing, leading venture capitalists formed the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). The NVCA was to serve as the [[industry trade group]] for the venture capital industry.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nvca.org/ |title = Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-30 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080730052236/http://www.nvca.org/ |archive-date=July 30, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} Official website of the National Venture Capital Association, the largest trade association for the venture capital industry.</ref> Venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in 1974, when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund.

It was not until 1978 that venture capital experienced its first major fundraising year, as the industry raised approximately $750 million. With the passage of the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA) in 1974, corporate pension funds were prohibited from holding certain risky investments including many investments in [[privately held]] companies. In 1978, the [[United States Department of Labor|US Labor Department]] relaxed certain restrictions of the ERISA, under the "[[prudent man rule]]"{{NoteTag|The "prudent man rule" is a [[fiduciary responsibility]] of investment managers under ERISA. Under the original application, each investment was expected to adhere to risk standards on its own merits, limiting the ability of investment managers to make any investments deemed potentially risky.  Under the revised 1978 interpretation, the concept of portfolio diversification of risk, measuring risk at the aggregate portfolio level rather than the investment level to satisfy fiduciary standards would also be accepted.}}, thus allowing corporate pension funds to invest in the asset class and providing a major source of capital available to venture capitalists.

===1980s===
The public successes of the venture capital industry in the 1970s and early 1980s (e.g., [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Genentech]]) gave rise to a major proliferation of venture capital investment firms. From just a few dozen firms at the start of the decade, there were over 650 firms by the end of the 1980s, each searching for the next major "home run".  The number of firms multiplied, and the capital managed by these firms increased from $3 billion to $31 billion over the course of the decade.<ref name=VCVigor>POLLACK, ANDREW.  "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D61E3CF93BA35753C1A96F948260 Venture Capital Loses Its Vigor]."  [[New York Times]], October 8, 1989.</ref>

The growth of the industry was hampered by sharply declining returns, and certain venture firms began posting losses for the first time.  In addition to the increased competition among firms, several other factors affected returns. The market for initial public offerings cooled in the mid-1980s before collapsing after the stock market crash in 1987, and foreign corporations, particularly from [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], flooded early-stage companies with capital.<ref name="VCVigor"/>

In response to the changing conditions, corporations that had sponsored in-house venture investment arms, including [[General Electric]] and [[Paine Webber]] either sold off or closed these venture capital units.  Additionally, venture capital units within [[Chemical Banking|Chemical Bank]] and [[Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company|Continental Illinois National Bank]], among others, began shifting their focus from funding early stage companies toward investments in more mature companies. Even industry founders [[J.H. Whitney & Company]] and [[Warburg Pincus]] began to transition toward [[leveraged buyouts]] and [[growth capital]] investments.<ref name="VCVigor"/><ref>Kurtzman, Joel.

[[New York Times]], February 6, 1987.</ref>

===Venture capital boom and the Internet Bubble===
By the end of the 1980s, venture capital returns were relatively low, particularly in comparison with their emerging [[leveraged buyout]] cousins, due in part to the competition for hot startups, excess supply of IPOs and the inexperience of many venture capital fund managers. Growth in the venture capital industry remained limited throughout the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, increasing from $3 billion in 1983 to just over $4 billion more than a decade later in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reactionwheel.net/2015/01/80s-vc.html |title=Heat Death: Venture Capital in the 1980s |last=Neumann |first=Jerry |date=January 8, 2015 |website=Reaction Wheel |access-date=May 5, 2020}}</ref>

The advent of the [[World Wide Web]] in the early 1990s reinvigorated venture capital as investors saw companies with huge potential being formed. [[Netscape]] and [[Amazon (company)]] were founded in 1994, and [[Yahoo!]] in 1995. All were funded by venture capital. [[Internet]] IPOs—AOL in 1992; Netcom in 1994; UUNet, Spyglass and Netscape in 1995; Lycos, Excite, Yahoo!, CompuServe, Infoseek, C/NET, and E*Trade in 1996; and Amazon, ONSALE, Go2Net, N2K, NextLink, and SportsLine in 1997—generated enormous returns for their venture capital investors. These returns, and the performance of the companies post-IPO, caused a rush of money into venture capital, increasing the number of venture capital funds raised from about 40 in 1991 to more than 400 in 2000, and the amount of money committed to the sector from $1.5 billion in 1991 to more than $90 billion in 2000.<ref>National Science Foundation, “Science and Engineering Indicators–2002″</ref>

The bursting of the [[Dot-com bubble]] in 2000 caused many venture capital firms to fail and financial results in the sector to decline.

===Private equity crash===
[[File:Nasdaq2.png|thumb|280px|The technology-heavy [[NASDAQ Composite]] index peaked at 5,048 in March 2000 reflecting the high point of the dot-com bubble.]]
The [[Nasdaq]] crash and technology slump that started in March 2000 shook virtually the entire venture capital industry as valuations for startup technology companies collapsed. Over the next two years, many venture firms had been forced to write-off large proportions of their investments, and many funds were significantly "[[Under water (loan)|under water]]" (the values of the fund's investments were below the amount of capital invested). Venture capital investors sought to reduce the size of commitments they had made to venture capital funds, and, in numerous instances, investors sought to unload existing commitments for cents on the dollar in the [[private equity secondary market|secondary market]]. By mid-2003, the venture capital industry had shriveled to about half its 2001 capacity. Nevertheless, [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PricewaterhouseCoopers']] MoneyTree Survey<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.pwcmoneytree.com/moneytree/index.jsp |title = MoneyTree Survey |publisher = Pwcmoneytree.com |date = February 21, 2007 |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070614161950/http://www.pwcmoneytree.com/moneytree/index.jsp |archive-date = June 14, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> shows that total venture capital investments held steady at 2003 levels through the second quarter of 2005.

Although the post-boom years represent just a small fraction of the peak levels of venture investment reached in 2000, they still represent an increase over the levels of investment from 1980 through 1995. As a percentage of GDP, venture investment was 0.058% in 1994, peaked at 1.087% (nearly 19 times the 1994 level) in 2000 and ranged from 0.164% to 0.182% in 2003 and 2004. The revival of an [[Internet]]-driven environment in 2004 through 2007 helped to revive the venture capital environment. However, as a percentage of the overall private equity market, venture capital has still not reached its mid-1990s level, let alone its peak in 2000.

Venture capital funds, which were responsible for much of the fundraising volume in 2000 (the height of the [[dot-com bubble]]), raised only $25.1 billion in 2006, a 2% decline from 2005 and a significant decline from its peak.<ref>Dow Jones Private Equity Analyst as referenced in Taub, Stephen.  {{cite web |url=http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/8537972/c_8519925?f=home_todayinfinance |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614003624/http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/8537972/c_8519925?f=home_todayinfinance |archive-date=June 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} Record Year for Private Equity Fundraising.

==Funding==
Obtaining venture capital is substantially different from raising debt or a loan. Lenders have a legal right to interest on a loan and repayment of the capital irrespective of the success or failure of a business. Venture capital is invested in exchange for an equity stake in the business. The return of the venture capitalist as a shareholder depends on the growth and profitability of the business. This return is generally earned when the venture capitalist "exits" by selling its shareholdings when the business is sold to another owner.

Venture capitalists are typically very selective in deciding what to invest in, with a Stanford survey of venture capitalists revealing that 100 companies were considered for every company receiving financing.
<ref>{{Cite news|title=How Do Venture Capitalists Make Decisions?|work=Stanford University Graduate School of Business Research Paper|df=mdy-all|ssrn = 2801385}}</ref> Ventures receiving financing must demonstrate an excellent management team, a large potential market, and most importantly high growth potential, as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing financial returns and a successful exit within the required time frame (typically 3–7 years) that venture capitalists expect.

Because investments are [[Market liquidity|illiquid]] and require the extended time frame to harvest, venture capitalists are expected to carry out detailed [[due diligence]] prior to investment. Venture capitalists also are expected to nurture the companies in which they invest, in order to increase the likelihood of reaching an [[Initial public offering|IPO]] stage when [[Valuation (finance)|valuations]] are favourable. Venture capitalists typically assist at four stages in the company's development:<ref>[http://www.banknetindia.com/finance/vcapital.htm Investment philosophy of VCs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612195436/http://www.banknetindia.com/finance/vcapital.htm |date=June 12, 2008 }}.</ref>

* [[Exit strategy#In business|Exit]]

Because there are no public exchanges listing their securities, private companies meet venture capital firms and other private equity investors in several ways, including warm referrals from the investors' trusted sources and other business contacts; investor conferences and symposia; and summits where companies pitch directly to investor groups in face-to-face meetings, including a variant known as "Speed Venturing", which is akin to speed-dating for capital, where the investor decides within 10 minutes whether he wants a follow-up meeting. In addition, some new private online networks are emerging to provide additional opportunities for meeting investors.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/10100885.stm Cash-strapped entrepreneurs get creative, BBC News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521154619/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/10100885.stm |date=May 21, 2010 }}.</ref>

This need for high returns makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies, and most suitable for businesses having large up-front [[capital requirement]]s, which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt. That is most commonly the case for intangible assets such as software, and other intellectual property, whose value is unproven. In turn, this explains why venture capital is most prevalent in the fast-growing [[high tech|technology]] and [[life sciences]] or [[biotechnology]] fields.

If a company does have the qualities venture capitalists seek including a solid business plan, a good management team, investment and passion from the founders, a good potential to exit the investment before the end of their funding cycle, and target minimum returns in excess of 40% per year, it will find it easier to raise venture capital.

===Financing stages===
There are typically six stages of [[venture round]] financing offered in Venture Capital, that roughly correspond to these stages of a company's development.<ref>''Corporate Finance'', 8th Edition.  Ross, Westerfield, Jaffe. McGraw-Hill publishing, 2008.</ref>
* [[Seed money|Seed funding]]: The earliest round of financing needed to prove a new idea, often provided by [[angel investor]]s. [[Equity crowdfunding]] is also emerging as an option for seed funding.
* Start-up: Early stage firms that need funding for expenses associated with marketing and product development
* Growth  ([[Series A round]]): Early sales and manufacturing funds. This is typically where VCs come in. Series A can be thought of as the first institutional round. Subsequent investment rounds are called Series B, Series C and so on. This is where most companies will have the most growth.
* Second-Round: [[Working capital]] for early stage companies that are selling product, but not yet turning a profit. This can also be called Series B round and so on.
* Expansion: Also called [[Mezzanine capital|Mezzanine financing]], this is expansion money for a newly profitable company
* Exit of venture capitalist: VCs can exit through secondary sale or an IPO or an acquisition. Early stage VCs may exit in later rounds when new investors (VCs or Private Equity investors) buy the shares of existing investors. Sometimes a company very close to an IPO may allow some VCs to exit and instead new investors may come in hoping to profit from the IPO.
* Bridge Financing is when a startup seeks funding in between full VC rounds. The objective is to raise a smaller amount of money instead of a full round and usually the existing investors participate.

Between the first round and the fourth round, venture-backed companies may also seek to take [[venture debt]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://bootlaw.com/2010/06/14/up-up-and-away-should-you-be-thinking-about-venture-debt/ |title = Bootlaw&nbsp;– Essential law for startups and emerging tech businesses&nbsp;– Up, Up and Away.

==Firms and funds==

===Venture capitalist===
A '''venture capitalist''', or sometimes simply '''capitalist''', is a person who makes capital investments in companies in exchange for an [[Equity (finance)|equity stake]].  The venture capitalist is often expected to bring managerial and technical expertise, as well as capital, to their investments. A '''venture capital fund''' refers to a [[Investment fund|pooled investment]] vehicle (in the United States, often an [[Limited partnership|LP]] or [[Limited liability company|LLC]]) that primarily invests the [[financial capital]] of third-party investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard [[capital market]]s or [[loan|bank loans]]. These funds are typically managed by a '''venture capital firm''', which often employs individuals with technology backgrounds (scientists, researchers), business training and/or deep industry experience.

A core skill within VC is the ability to identify novel or disruptive technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage. By definition, VCs also take a role in managing entrepreneurial companies at an early stage, thus adding skills as well as capital, thereby differentiating VC from buy-out private equity, which typically invest in companies with proven revenue, and thereby potentially realizing much higher rates of returns. Inherent in realizing abnormally high rates of returns is the risk of losing all of one's investment in a given startup company. As a consequence, most venture capital investments are done in a pool format, where several investors combine their investments into one large fund that invests in many different startup companies. By investing in the pool format, the investors are spreading out their risk to many different investments instead of taking the chance of putting all of their money in one start up firm.
[[File:Venture Capital Fund Diagram.png|500px|thumb|right|Diagram of the structure of a generic venture capital fund]]

===Structure===
Venture capital firms are typically structured as [[partnerships]], the [[general partners]] of which serve as the managers of the firm and will serve as investment advisors to the venture capital funds raised. Venture capital firms in the United States may also be structured as [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]], in which case the firm's managers are known as managing members.  Investors in venture capital funds are known as [[limited partner]]s. This constituency comprises both high-net-worth individuals and institutions with large amounts of available capital, such as state and private [[pension fund]]s, university [[financial endowment]]s, foundations, [[insurance]] companies, and [[Collective investment scheme|pooled investment]] vehicles, called [[Fund of funds|funds of funds]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280083626|title=The interplay of track record and trustworthiness in venture capital fundraising|author=Andreas Kuckertz|date=December 1, 2015|work=ResearchGate|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927114350/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/280083626_The_interplay_of_track_record_and_trustworthiness_in_venture_capital_fundraising|archive-date=September 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Types===
Venture capitalist firms differ in their motivations<ref>Röhm, P., Köhn, A., Kuckertz, A. and Dehnen, H. S. (2017)  [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314070583_A_world_of_difference_The_impact_of_corporate_venture_capitalists%27_investment_motivation_on_startup_valuation''A world of difference?

Journal of Business Economics. [[doi:10.1007/s11573-017-0857-5]]</ref> and approaches. There are multiple factors, and each firm is different.

Venture capital funds are generally three in types:
1. Angel investors 
2. Financial VCs 
3. Strategic VCs

Some of the factors that influence VC decisions include:
* Business situation: Some VCs tend to invest in new, disruptive ideas, or fledgling companies. Others prefer investing in established companies that need support to go public or grow.
* Some invest solely in certain industries.
* Some prefer operating locally while others will operate nationwide or even globally.
* VC expectations can often vary. Some may want a quicker public sale of the company or expect fast growth. The amount of help a VC provides can vary from one firm to the next.

===Roles===
Within the venture capital industry, the general partners and other investment professionals of the venture capital firm are often referred to as "venture capitalists" or "VCs".  Typical career backgrounds vary, but, broadly speaking, venture capitalists come from either an operational or a finance background.  Venture capitalists with an operational background ([[operating partner]]) tend to be former founders or executives of companies similar to those which the partnership finances or will have served as management consultants.  Venture capitalists with finance backgrounds tend to have [[investment banking]] or other [[corporate finance]] experience.

Although the titles are not entirely uniform from firm to firm, other positions at venture capital firms include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Position
!Role
|-
|General Partners or GPs
|They run the Venture Capital firm and make the investment decisions on behalf of the fund. GPs typically put in personal capital up to 1-2% of the VC Fund size to show their commitment to the LPs.
|-
|Venture partners
|Venture partners are expected to source potential investment opportunities ("bring in deals") and typically are compensated only for those deals with which they are involved.
|-
|Principal
|This is a mid-level investment professional position, and often considered a "partner-track" position.  Principals will have been promoted from a senior associate position or who have commensurate experience in another field, such as [[investment banking]], [[management consulting]], or a market of particular interest to the strategy of the venture capital firm.
|-
|Associate
|This is typically the most junior apprentice position within a venture capital firm.  After a few successful years, an associate may move up to the "senior associate" position and potentially principal and beyond.  Associates will often have worked for 1–2 years in another field, such as [[investment banking]] or [[management consulting]].
|-
|Analyst
|In some cases, a venture capital firm may offer an analyst role for fresh graduates who have no prior relevant experience. 
|-
|Entrepreneur-in-residence
|Entrepreneurs-in-residence (EIRs) are experts in a particular industry sector (e.g., biotechnology or social media) and perform [[due diligence]] on potential deals. EIRs are hired by venture capital firms temporarily (six to 18 months) and are expected to develop and pitch startup ideas to their host firm, although neither party is bound to work with each other. Some EIRs move on to executive positions within a portfolio company.

===Structure of the funds===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}
Most [[private equity fund|venture capital funds]] have a fixed life of 10 years, with the possibility of a few years of extensions to allow for private companies still seeking liquidity.  The investing cycle for most funds is generally three to five years, after which the focus is managing and making follow-on investments in an existing portfolio.  This model was pioneered by successful funds in [[Silicon Valley]] through the 1980s to invest in technological trends broadly but only during their period of ascendance, and to cut exposure to management and marketing risks of any individual firm or its product.

In such a fund, the investors have a fixed commitment to the fund that is initially unfunded and subsequently "called down" by the venture capital fund over time as the fund makes its investments. There are substantial penalties for a limited partner (or investor) that fails to participate in a [[capital call]].

It can take anywhere from a month or so to several years for venture capitalists to raise money from limited partners for their fund. At the time when all of the money has been raised, the fund is said to be closed, and the 10-year lifetime begins.  Some funds have partial closes when one half (or some other amount) of the fund has been raised. The [[vintage year]] generally refers to the year in which the fund was closed and may serve as a means to stratify VC funds for comparison.

From investors' point of view, funds can be: (1) [[private equity fund|traditional]]—where all the investors invest with equal terms; or (2) [[asymmetric fund|asymmetric]]—where different investors have different terms. Typically the asymmetry is seen in cases where there's an investor that has other interests such as tax income in case of public investors.

===Compensation===
{{Main|Carried interest}}
Venture capitalists are compensated through a combination of management fees and [[carried interest]] (often referred to as a "two and 20" arrangement):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Payment
!Implementation
|-
|Management fees
|an annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the fund's manager to pay for the private equity firm's investment operations.<ref name=calpersdictionary>[http://www.calpers.ca.gov/index.jsp?bc=/investments/assets/equities/aim/pe-glossary.xml Private equity industry dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505124540/http://www.calpers.ca.gov/index.jsp?bc=%2Finvestments%2Fassets%2Fequities%2Faim%2Fpe-glossary.xml |date=May 5, 2008 }}. [[CalPERS]] Alternative Investment Program</ref>  In a typical venture capital fund, the general partners receive an annual management fee equal to up to 2% of the committed capital.
|-
|Carried interest
|a share of the profits of the fund (typically 20%), paid to the private equity fund's management company as a performance incentive.  The remaining 80% of the profits are paid to the fund's investors<ref name="calpersdictionary"/>  Strong limited partner interest in top-tier venture firms has led to a general trend toward terms more favorable to the venture partnership, and certain groups are able to command carried interest of 25–30% on their funds.
|}

Because a fund may run out of capital prior to the end of its life, larger venture capital firms usually have several overlapping funds at the same time; doing so lets the larger firm keep specialists in all stages of the development of firms almost constantly engaged.  Smaller firms tend to thrive or fail with their initial industry contacts; by the time the fund cashes out, an entirely new generation of technologies and people is ascending, whom the general partners may not know well, and so it is prudent to reassess and shift industries or personnel rather than attempt to simply invest more in the industry or people the partners already know.

===Alternatives===
Because of the strict requirements venture capitalists have for potential investments, many entrepreneurs seek [[seed funding]] from [[angel investors]], who may be more willing to invest in highly speculative opportunities, or may have a prior relationship with the entrepreneur. Additionally, entrepreneurs may seek alternative financing, such as [[revenue-based financing]], to avoid giving up equity ownership in the business.

Furthermore, many venture capital firms will only seriously evaluate an investment in a [[start-up company]] otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove at least some of its claims about the technology and/or market potential for its product or services. To achieve this, or even just to avoid the dilutive effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven, many start-ups seek to self-finance [[sweat equity]] until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or [[angel investors]]. This practice is called "[[bootstrapping (business)|bootstrapping]]".

[[Equity crowdfunding]] is emerging as an alternative to traditional venture capital. Traditional [[crowdfunding]] is an approach to raising the capital required for a new project or enterprise by appealing to large numbers of ordinary people for small donations. While such an approach has long precedents in the sphere of charity, it is receiving renewed attention from entrepreneurs, now that social media and online communities make it possible to reach out to a group of potentially interested supporters at very low cost. Some [[equity crowdfunding]] models are also being applied specifically for startup funding, such as those listed at [[Comparison of crowd funding services]]. One of the reasons to look for alternatives to venture capital is the problem of the traditional VC model. The traditional VCs are shifting their focus to later-stage investments, and [[return on investment]] of many VC funds have been low or negative.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/><ref>{{cite web |url = https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/15/grow-vc-launches-aiming-to-become-the-kiva-for-tech-startups/ |title = Grow VC launches, aiming to become the Kiva for tech startups |publisher = Eu.techcrunch.com |date = February 15, 2010 |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120530064252/http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/15/grow-vc-launches-aiming-to-become-the-kiva-for-tech-startups/ |archive-date = May 30, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

In Europe and India, [[Media for equity]] is a partial alternative to venture capital funding. Media for equity investors are able to supply start-ups with often significant advertising campaigns in return for equity. In Europe, an investment advisory firm offers young ventures the option to exchange equity for services investment; their aim is to guide ventures through the development stage to arrive at a significant funding, mergers and acquisition, or other exit strategy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sollertis-strategy.com/index.html|title=Sollertis Strategy - Adventure Capitalist and Consulting Organisation|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229162850/http://www.sollertis-strategy.com/index.html|archive-date=December 29, 2014|df=mdy-all|access-date=December 29, 2014}}</ref>

In industries where assets can be [[Securitization|securitized]] effectively because they reliably generate future revenue streams or have a good potential for resale in case of [[foreclosure]], businesses may more cheaply be able to raise debt to finance their growth. Good examples would include asset-intensive extractive industries such as mining, or manufacturing industries. Offshore funding is provided via specialist venture capital trusts, which seek to use securitization in structuring hybrid multi-market transactions via an SPV ([[special purpose vehicle]]): a corporate entity that is designed solely for the purpose of the financing.

In addition to traditional venture capital and angel networks, groups have emerged, which allow groups of small investors or entrepreneurs themselves to compete in a privatized business plan competition where the group itself serves as the investor through a democratic process.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://growvc.com |title = Grow Venture Community |publisher = Growvc.com |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100209014634/http://www.growvc.com/ |archive-date = February 9, 2010 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Law firms are also increasingly acting as an intermediary between clients seeking venture capital and the firms providing it.<ref>{{cite web |last = Austin |first = Scott |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703453804575479650072184066 |title = "Law Firms Offer Discounts, Play Matchmaker," The Wall Street Journal, Sept. 9, 2010 |publisher = Online.wsj.com |date = September 9, 2010 |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150115040929/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703453804575479650072184066 |archive-date = January 15, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Other forms include [[venture resources]] that seek to provide non-monetary support to launch a new venture.

==Societal impact==

Venture capital is also associated with job creation (accounting for 2% of US GDP),<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nvca.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=255&Itemid=103 |title = Venture Impact: The Economic Importance of Venture-Backed Companies to the U.S. Economy |publisher = National Venture Capital Association |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140630170428/http://www.nvca.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=255&Itemid=103 |archive-date = June 30, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> the [[knowledge economy]], and used as a proxy measure of [[innovation]] within an economic sector or geography.

[[Babson College]]'s Diana Report found that the number of women [[partner (business rank)|partner]]s in VC firms decreased from 10% in 1999 to 6% in 2014. The report also found that 97% of VC-funded businesses had male [[chief executive]]s, and that businesses with all-male teams were more than four times as likely to receive VC funding compared to teams with at least one woman.<ref name="diana-report">{{cite web|url=http://www.babson.edu/Academics/centers/blank-center/global-research/diana/Documents/diana-project-executive-summary-2014.pdf|title=Diana Report|first=Candida|last=Brush|publisher=Women Entrepreneurs 2014|year=2014|accessdate=2016-01-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122183718/http://www.babson.edu/Academics/centers/blank-center/global-research/diana/Documents/diana-project-executive-summary-2014.pdf|archive-date=January 22, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Geographical differences==
Venture capital, as an industry, originated in the United States, and American firms have traditionally been the largest participants in venture deals with the bulk of venture capital being deployed in American companies.  However, increasingly, non-US venture investment is growing, and the number and size of non-US venture capitalists have been expanding.

Venture capital has been used as a tool for [[economic development]] in a variety of developing regions. In many of these regions, with less developed financial sectors, venture capital plays a role in facilitating [[access to finance]] for [[small and medium enterprises]] (SMEs), which in most cases would not qualify for receiving bank loans.

In the year of 2008, while VC funding were still majorly dominated by U.S. money ($28.8 billion invested in over 2550 deals in 2008), compared to international fund investments ($13.4 billion invested elsewhere), there has been an average 5% growth in the venture capital deals outside the US, mainly in [[China]] and [[Europe]].<ref name="venturebeat.com">{{cite news |url = https://venturebeat.com/2009/02/18/international-venture-funding-rose-15-percent-in-2008/ |title = International venture funding rose 5 percent in 2008 |work = VentureBeat |date = February 18, 2009 |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120714021930/http://venturebeat.com/2009/02/18/international-venture-funding-rose-15-percent-in-2008/ |archive-date = July 14, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Geographical differences can be significant.

{{Main|Venture capital in Israel}}
In Israel, high-tech entrepreneurship and venture capital have flourished well beyond the country's relative size. As it has very little natural resources and, historically has been forced to build its economy on knowledge-based industries, its VC industry has rapidly developed, and nowadays has about 70 active venture capital funds, of which 14 international VCs with Israeli offices, and additional 220 international funds which actively invest in Israel. In addition, as of 2010, Israel led the world in venture capital invested per capita.  Israel attracted $170 per person compared to $75 in the USA.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/21543151 What next for the start-up nation?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725154615/http://www.economist.com/node/21543151 |date=July 25, 2017 }}, [[The Economist]], January 21, 2012</ref>  About two thirds of the funds invested were from foreign sources, and the rest domestic.

===Canada===
Canadian technology companies have attracted interest from the global venture capital community partially as a result of generous tax incentive through the [[Scientific Research and Experimental Development Tax Credit Program|Scientific Research and Experimental Development]] (SR&ED) investment tax credit program.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The basic incentive available to any Canadian corporation performing R&D is a refundable tax credit that is equal to 20% of "qualifying" R&D expenditures (labour, material, R&D contracts, and R&D equipment). An enhanced 35% refundable tax credit of available to certain (i.e. small) Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs). Because the CCPC rules require a minimum of 50% Canadian ownership in the company performing R&D, foreign investors who would like to benefit from the larger 35% tax credit must accept minority position in the company, which might not be desirable. The SR&ED program does not restrict the export of any technology or intellectual property that may have been developed with the benefit of SR&ED tax incentives.

Canada also has a fairly unusual form of venture capital generation in its [[Labour-sponsored venture capital corporation|labour-sponsored venture capital corporations (LSVCC)]]. These funds, also known as Retail Venture Capital or Labour Sponsored Investment Funds (LSIF), are generally sponsored by labor unions and offer [[tax break]]s from government to encourage retail investors to purchase the funds. Generally, these Retail Venture Capital funds only invest in companies where the majority of employees are in Canada. However, innovative structures have been developed to permit LSVCCs to direct in Canadian subsidiaries of corporations incorporated in jurisdictions outside of Canada.

===Switzerland===
Many Swiss start-ups are university spin-offs, in particular from its federal institutes of technology in [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|Lausanne]] and [[ETH Zurich|Zurich]].<ref name=investiere.ch>{{cite web |url = https://www.investiere.ch/sites/default/files/u954/SwissBusiness_ausgabe%20_6-2011_p40-41.pdf |title = Bright sparks!

=== Poland ===
{{Main|Venture capital in Poland}}
As of March 2019, there are 130 active VC firms in [[Poland]] which have invested locally in over 750 companies, an average of 9 companies per portfolio. Since 2016, new legal institutions have been established for entities implementing investments in enterprises in the seed or startup phase. In 2018, venture capital funds invested {{Euro|178M}} in Polish startups (0.033% of GDP). As of March 2019, total assets managed by VC companies operating in Poland are estimated at {{Euro|2.6B}}.

===Asia===

[[India]] is fast catching up with the West in the field of venture capital and a number of venture capital funds have a presence in the country ([[Indian Venture Capital Association|IVCA]]). In 2006, the total amount of private equity and venture capital in India reached $7.5&nbsp;billion across 299 deals.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.indiavca.org/IVCA%20Presentation_October2007.pdf |title = Venture Capital & Private Equity in India (October 2007) |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111030028/http://indiavca.org/IVCA%20Presentation_October2007.pdf |archive-date = January 11, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> In the Indian context, venture capital consists of investing in equity, quasi-equity, or conditional loans in order to promote unlisted, high-risk, or high-tech firms driven by technically or professionally qualified entrepreneurs. It is also used to refer to investors "providing seed", "start-up and first-stage financing",<ref>{{cite web |title = Venture Capital And Private Equity in India |url = http://www.indiavca.org/IVCA%20Presentation_October2007.pdf |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111030028/http://indiavca.org/IVCA%20Presentation_October2007.pdf |archive-date = January 11, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> or financing companies that have demonstrated extraordinary business potential. Venture capital refers to capital investment; equity and debt ;both of which carry indubitable risk. The risk anticipated is very high. The venture capital industry follows the concept of "high risk, high return", innovative entrepreneurship, knowledge-based ideas and human capital intensive enterprises have taken the front seat as venture capitalists invest in risky finance to encourage innovation.<ref>{{cite web |title = Venture Capital:An Impetus to Indian Economy |url = http://www.indiajuris.com/halsbury.pdf |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111124235327/http://www.indiajuris.com/halsbury.pdf |archive-date = November 24, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

[[China]] is also starting to develop a venture capital industry ([[China Venture Capital Association|CVCA]]).

[[Vietnam]] is experiencing its first foreign venture capitals, including IDG Venture Vietnam ($100&nbsp;million) and DFJ Vinacapital ($35&nbsp;million)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://idgvv.com.vn/en/press/media/lets-open-the-100-million-dollar-door |title = Let's Open the 100&nbsp;Million Dollar Door &#124; IDG Ventures Vietnam&nbsp;– Official Website |publisher = IDG Venture Vietnam |accessdate = May 18, 2012 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120322053729/http://idgvv.com.vn/en/press/media/lets-open-the-100-million-dollar-door |archive-date = March 22, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

[[Singapore]] is widely recognized and featured as one of the hottest places to both start up and invest, mainly due to its healthy ecosystem, its strategic location and connectedness to foreign markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/what-you-need-to-know-about-starting-up-in-singapore.html|title=4 Reasons Why Singapore Is a Global Hot Spot for Entrepreneurship|date=October 15, 2015|website=inc.com|accessdate=May 6, 2018}}</ref> With 100 deals valued at US$3.5 billion, Singapore saw a record value of PE and VC investments in 2016. The number of PE and VC investments increased substantially over the last 5 years: In 2015, Singapore recorded 81 investments with an aggregate value of US$2.2 billion while in 2014 and 2013, PE and VC deal values came to US$2.4 billion and US$0.9 billion respectively. With 53 percent, tech investments account for the majority of deal volume. Moreover, Singapore is home to two of South-East Asia's largest unicorns. [[Garena]] is reportedly the highest-valued unicorn in the region with a US$3.5 billion price tag, while [[Grab (application)|Grab]] is the highest-funded, having raised a total of US$1.43 billion since its incorporation in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/technology/tech-behind-record-pe-vc-deals-in-2016|title=Tech behind record PE, VC deals in 2016|first=Jacquelyn|last=Cheok|website=businesstimes.com.sg|accessdate=May 6, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012165055/http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/technology/tech-behind-record-pe-vc-deals-in-2016|archive-date=October 12, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
Start-ups and small businesses in Singapore receive support from policymakers and the local government fosters the role VCs play to support entrepreneurship in Singapore and the region. For instance, in 2016, Singapore's [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)#National Research Foundation|National Research Foundation (NRF)]] has given out grants up to around $30 million to four large local enterprises for investments in startups in the city-state. This first of its kind partnership NRF has entered into is designed to encourage these enterprises to source for new technologies and innovative business models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/41135-41135/|title=Singapore's NRF awards $30m to CapitaLand, DeClout, Wilmar, YCH to invest in local startups - DealStreetAsia|website=www.dealstreetasia.com|accessdate=May 6, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813150352/http://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/41135-41135/|archive-date=August 13, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
Currently, the rules governing VC firms are being reviewed by the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore|Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)]] to make it easier to set up funds and increase funding opportunities for start-ups. This mainly includes simplifying and shortening the authorization process for new venture capital managers and to study whether existing incentives that have attracted traditional asset managers here will be suitable for the VC sector. A public consultation on the proposals was held in January 2017 with changes expected to be introduced by July.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/simplify-rules-to-boost-venture-capital-activity-mas-review |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213002355/http://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/simplify-rules-to-boost-venture-capital-activity-mas-review |archive-date=February 13, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Middle East and North Africa===
The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) venture capital industry is an early stage of development but growing. According to ''[https://magnitt.com/research/49638/h1-2019-mena-venture-investment-report H1 2019 MENA Venture Investment Report]'' by MAGNiTT, 238 startup investment deals have taken place in the region in the first half of 2019, totaling in $471 million in investments. Compared to 2018’s H1 report, this represents an increase of 66% in total funding and 28% in number of deals.

According to the report, the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] is the most active ecosystem in the region with 26% of the deals made in H1, followed by [[Egypt]] at 21%, and [[Lebanon]] at 13%. In terms of deals by sector, fintech remains the most active industry with 17% of the deals made, followed by e-commerce at 12%, and delivery and transport at 8%.

The report also notes that a total of 130 institutions invested in MENA-based startups in H1 2019, 30% of which were headquartered outside the MENA, demonstrating international appetite for investments in the region. 15 startup exits have been recorded in H1 2019, with [[Careem]]’s $3.1 billion acquisition by [[Uber]] being the first unicorn exit in the region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gulfnews.com/business/banking/careem-proves-unicorns-grow-in-deserts-too-1.62947464|title=Careem proves unicorns grow in deserts too|website=gulfnews.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref> Other notable exits include Souq.com exit to [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] in 2017 for $650 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/amazon-to-acquire-souq-a-middle-east-clone-once-valued-at-1b-for-650m/|title=Amazon to acquire Souq, a Middle East clone once valued at $1B, for $650M|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref>

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
{{see also|Economy of Africa#Entrepreneurship}}
The Southern African venture capital industry is developing. The South African Government and Revenue Service is following the international trend of using tax-efficient vehicles to propel economic growth and job creation through venture capital. Section 12 J of the ''Income Tax Act'' was updated to include venture capital. Companies are allowed to use a tax-efficient structure similar to VCTs in the UK.  Despite the above structure, the government needs to adjust its regulation around [[intellectual property]], exchange control and other legislation to ensure that Venture capital succeeds.

Currently, there are not many venture capital funds in operation and it is a small community; however, the number of venture funds are steadily increasing with new incentives slowly coming in from government. Funds are difficult to come by and due to the limited funding, companies are more likely to receive funding if they can demonstrate initial sales or traction and the potential for significant growth.  The majority of the venture capital in Sub-Saharan Africa is centered on South Africa and Kenya.

Entrepreneurship is a key to growth. Governments will need to ensure business friendly regulatory environments in order to help foster innovation. In 2019, venture capital startup funding grew to 1.3 billion dollars, increasing rapidly. The causes are as of yet unclear, but education is certainly a factor.<ref>The Economist, "The African century", March 28th 2020.</ref>

==Confidential information==
Unlike [[public company|public companies]], information regarding an entrepreneur's business is typically confidential and proprietary.  As part of the [[due diligence]] process, most venture capitalists will require significant detail with respect to a company's business plan.  Entrepreneurs must remain vigilant about sharing information with venture capitalists that are investors in their competitors.  Most venture capitalists treat information confidentially, but as a matter of business practice, they do not typically enter into [[Non Disclosure Agreement]]s because of the potential liability issues those agreements entail.  Entrepreneurs are typically well advised to protect truly proprietary intellectual property.

[[Limited partners]] of venture capital firms typically have access only to limited amounts of information with respect to the individual portfolio companies in which they are invested and are typically bound by confidentiality provisions in the fund's [[limited partnership|limited partnership agreement]].

==Governmental regulations==
There are several strict guidelines regulating those that deal in venture capital.  Namely, they are not allowed to advertise or solicit business in any form as per the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] guidelines.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/general-solicitation-small-entity-compliance-guide.htm |title = Eliminating the Prohibition Against General Solicitation and General Advertising in Rule 506 and Rule 144A Offerings |publisher = [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] |accessdate = August 20, 2014 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140925115247/http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/general-solicitation-small-entity-compliance-guide.htm |archive-date = September 25, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>
