The '''business cycle''', also known as the '''economic cycle''' or '''trade cycle''', are the fluctuations of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) around its long-term growth trend.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Madhani|first1=P. M.|s2cid=154281029|year=2010|title=Rebalancing Fixed and Variable Pay in a Sales Organization: A Business Cycle Perspective|journal=[[Compensation & Benefits Review]]|volume=42|issue=3|pages=179–189|doi=10.1177/0886368709359668}}</ref> The length of a business cycle is the period of time containing a single boom and contraction in sequence. These fluctuations typically involve shifts over time between periods of relatively rapid economic growth ([[Economic expansion|expansions]] or booms) and periods of relative stagnation or decline (contractions or [[recession]]s).

Business cycles are usually measured by considering the growth rate of [[Value (economics)|real]] gross domestic product. Despite the often-applied term [[wikt:cycle|cycles]], these fluctuations in economic activity do not exhibit uniform or predictable periodicity. The common or popular usage '''boom-and-bust cycle''' refers to fluctuations in which the expansion is rapid and the contraction severe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boom-and-bust-cycle.asp|title=Boom And Bust Cycle|last=Kenton|first=Will|website=Investopedia|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>

The current view of mainstream economics is that business cycles are essentially the summation of purely random shocks to the economy and thus are not, in fact, cycles, despite appearing to be so. However, certain heterodox schools propose alternative theories suggesting that cycles do in fact exist due to endogenous causes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/economic-insights/2019/q1/eiq119-predicting-recessions.pdf?la=en#:~:text=Economists%20cannot%20predict%20the%20timing,forecasting%20business%20cycles%20is%20hard.&text=Most%20economists%20view%20business%20cycle,or%20mistakes%2C%20as%20Bernstein%20writes.|title=Why Are Recessions So Hard to Predict?

The first systematic exposition of [[economic crises]], in opposition to the existing theory of [[economic equilibrium]], was the 1819 ''Nouveaux Principes d'économie politique'' by [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]].<ref>[http://www.economictheories.org/2008/11/over-production-and-under-consumption.html "Over Production and Under Consumption"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425055556/http://www.economictheories.org/2008/11/over-production-and-under-consumption.html |date=2009-04-25 }}, ScarLett, History Of Economic Theory and Thought</ref> Prior to that point [[classical economics]] had either denied the existence of business cycles,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Economics in Crisis: Severe and Logical Contradictions of Classical, Keynesian, and Popular Trade Models |last=Batra |first=R. |year=2002}}</ref> blamed them on external factors, notably war,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/classical-economists-good-or-bad/|title=Classical Economists, Good or Bad?|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091002020124/http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/classical-economists-good-or-bad/|archive-date=2009-10-02}}</ref> or only studied the long term. Sismondi found vindication in the [[Panic of 1825]], which was the first unarguably international economic crisis, occurring in peacetime.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Sismondi and his contemporary [[Robert Owen]], who expressed similar but less systematic thoughts in 1817 ''Report to the Committee of the Association for the Relief of the Manufacturing Poor,'' both identified the cause of economic cycles as [[overproduction]] and [[underconsumption]], caused in particular by [[wealth inequality]]. They advocated [[government intervention]] and [[socialism]], respectively, as the solution. This work did not generate interest among classical economists, though underconsumption theory developed as a heterodox branch in economics until being systematized in [[Keynesian economics]] in the 1930s.

Sismondi's theory of periodic crises was developed into a theory of alternating ''cycles'' by [[Charles Dunoyer]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Benkemoune | first1 = Rabah | year = 2009 | title = Charles Dunoyer and the Emergence of the Idea of an Economic Cycle | journal = History of Political Economy | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 271–295 | doi = 10.1215/00182702-2009-003 }}</ref> and similar theories, showing signs of influence by Sismondi, were developed by [[Johann Karl Rodbertus]]. Periodic crises in capitalism formed the basis of the theory of [[Karl Marx]], who further claimed that these crises were increasing in severity and, on the basis of which, he predicted a [[communist revolution]]. Though only passing references in ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867) refer to crises, they were extensively discussed in Marx's posthumously published books, particularly in ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]''. In ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' (1879), [[Henry George]] focused on [[land (economics)|land]]'s role in crises – particularly [[land speculation]] – and proposed a [[land value tax|single tax on land]] as a solution.

=== Classification by periods ===
[[File:The Forces of the Business Cycle, 1922.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Business cycle with it specific forces in four stages according to [[Malcolm C. Rorty]], 1922]]
In 1860 French economist [[Clément Juglar]] first identified economic cycles 7 to 11 years long, although he cautiously did not claim any rigid regularity.<ref>
M. W. Lee, ''Economic fluctuations''. Homewood, IL, Richard D. Irwin, 1955</ref> Later{{when|date=January 2014}}, economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] argued that a [[Juglar cycle]] has four stages:
# [[Economic expansion|Expansion]] (increase in production and prices, low interest rates)
# [[Economic crisis|Crisis]] (stock exchanges crash and multiple bankruptcies of firms occur)
# [[Recession]] (drops in prices and in output, high interest-rates)
# [[Economic recovery|Recovery]] (stocks recover because of the fall in prices and incomes)

Schumpeter's Juglar model associates recovery and prosperity with increases in productivity, [[consumer confidence]], [[aggregate demand]], and prices.

In the 20th century, Schumpeter and others proposed a typology of business cycles according to their periodicity, so that a number of particular cycles were named after their discoverers or proposers:<ref>

Some say interest in the different typologies of cycles has waned since the development of modern [[macroeconomics]], which gives little support to the idea of regular periodic cycles.<ref>

Others, such as [[Dmitry Orlov (writer)|Dmitry Orlov]], argue that simple compound interest mandates the cycling of monetary systems. Since 1960, World GDP has increased by fifty-nine times, and these multiples have not even kept up with annual inflation over the same period. [[Social Contract]] (freedoms and absence of social problems) collapses may be observed in nations where incomes are not kept in balance with cost-of-living over the timeline of the monetary system cycle.

The [[Bible]] (760 BCE) and [[Hammurabi]]'s Code (1763 BCE) both explain economic remediations for cyclic sixty-year recurring great depressions, via fiftieth-year [[Jubilee (biblical)]] debt and wealth resets{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}.

Over the period since the Industrial Revolution, technological progress has had a much larger effect on the economy than any fluctuations in credit or debt, the primary exception being the Great Depression, which caused a multi-year steep economic decline.  The effect of technological progress can be seen by the purchasing power of an average hour's work, which has grown from $3 in 1900 to $22 in 1990, measured in 2010 dollars.<ref name="Legergott1993">{{cite book |title= Pursuing Happiness: American Consumers in the Twentieth Century |last= Lebergott |first= Stanley |year= 1993 |publisher= Princeton University Press |location= Princeton, NJ |isbn= 978-0691043227 |pages= a:Adapted from Fig. 9.1 |url= https://archive.org/details/pursuinghappines0000lebe |url-access= registration }}</ref>  There were similar increases in real wages during the 19th century.

There were frequent crises in Europe and America in the 19th and first half of the 20th century, specifically the period 1815–1939. This period started from the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]] in 1815, which was immediately followed by the [[Post-Napoleonic depression]] in the [[United Kingdom]] (1815–30), and culminated in the [[Great Depression]] of 1929–39, which led into [[World War II]]. See [[Financial crisis#19th century|Financial crisis: 19th century]] for listing and details. The first of these crises not associated with a war was the [[Panic of 1825]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shallat|first=Todd|date=February 2004|title=The Rhine: An Eco-Biography, 1815–2000|journal=The Public Historian|volume=26|issue=1|pages=163–164|doi=10.1525/tph.2004.26.1.163|issn=0272-3433}}</ref>

Business cycles in [[OECD]] countries after World War II were generally more restrained than the earlier business cycles. This was particularly true during the [[Golden Age of Capitalism]] (1945/50–1970s), and the period 1945–2008 did not experience a global downturn until the [[Late-2000s recession]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ici.org/pdf/per02-02.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-08-01 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313190606/http://ici.org/pdf/per02-02.pdf |archive-date=2013-03-13 }} Stock Market Cycles 1942–1995</ref>   Economic stabilization policy using [[fiscal policy]] and [[monetary policy]] appeared to have dampened the worst excesses of business cycles, and [[automatic stabilization]] due to the aspects of the [[government]]'s [[budget]] also helped mitigate the cycle even without conscious action by policy-makers.<ref>{{Citation|title=Business Cycles versus Boom-and-Bust Cycles|work=Economic and Financial Crises|year=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|doi=10.1057/9781137461902.0009|isbn=978-1-137-46190-2}}</ref>

In this period, the economic cycle – at least the problem of depressions – was twice declared dead. The first declaration was in the late 1960s, when the [[Phillips curve]] was seen as being able to steer the economy. However, this was followed by [[stagflation]] in the 1970s, which discredited the theory.  The second declaration was in the early 2000s, following the stability and growth in the 1980s and 1990s in what came to be known as [[The Great Moderation]]. Notably, in 2003, [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], in his presidential address to the [[American Economic Association]], declared that the "central problem of depression-prevention [has] been solved, for all practical purposes."<ref>Fighting Off Depression, New York Times, {{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/opinion/05krugman.html |title=Opinion &#124; Fighting off Depression |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 January 2009 |access-date=2009-08-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430040012/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/opinion/05krugman.html |archive-date=2011-04-30 |last1=Krugman |first1=Paul }}</ref>  Unfortunately, this was followed by the [[2008–2012 global recession]].

Various regions have experienced prolonged [[depression (economics)|depressions]], most dramatically the economic crisis in former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries following the end of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991.  For several of these countries the period 1989–2010 has been an ongoing depression, with real income still lower than in 1989.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Adrian|last2=Swain|first2=Adam|s2cid=154302466|date=January 2010|title=The Global Economic Crisis, Eastern Europe, and the Former Soviet Union: Models of Development and the Contradictions of Internationalization|journal=Eurasian Geography and Economics|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1–34|doi=10.2747/1539-7216.51.1.1|issn=1538-7216}}</ref>  This has been attributed not to a cyclical pattern, but to a mismanaged transition from [[command economies]] to [[market economies]].

In 1946, economists [[Arthur F. Burns]] and [[Wesley Clair Mitchell|Wesley C. Mitchell]] provided the now standard definition of business cycles in their book ''Measuring Business Cycles'':<ref>A. F. Burns and W. C. Mitchell, ''Measuring business cycles'', New York, National Bureau of Economic Research, 1946.</ref>
{{quote|sign=|source=|Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate economic activity of nations that organize their work mainly in business enterprises: a cycle consists of expansions occurring at about the same time in many economic activities, followed by similarly general recessions, contractions, and revivals which merge into the expansion phase of the next cycle; in duration, business cycles vary from more than one year to ten or twelve years; they are not divisible into shorter cycles of similar characteristics with amplitudes approximating their own.}}

According to A. F. Burns:<ref>A. F. Burns, Introduction. In: Wesley C. Mitchell, ''What happens during business cycles: A progress report''. New York, National Bureau of Economic Research, 1951</ref>
{{quote|Business cycles are not merely fluctuations in aggregate economic activity. The critical feature that distinguishes them from the commercial convulsions of earlier centuries or from the seasonal and other short term variations of our own age is that the fluctuations are widely diffused over the economy – its industry, its commercial dealings, and its tangles of finance. The economy of the western world is a system of closely interrelated parts. He who would understand business cycles must master the workings of an economic system organized largely in a network of free enterprises searching for profit. The problem of how business cycles come about is therefore inseparable from the problem of how a capitalist economy functions.}}

In the United States, it is generally accepted that the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER) is the final arbiter of the dates of the peaks and troughs of the business cycle. An expansion is the period from a trough to a peak and a recession as the period from a peak to a trough. The NBER identifies a recession as "a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production".<ref name="NBER">{{cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |title=US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions |publisher=NBER |access-date=2009-02-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219215409/https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |archive-date=February 19, 2009 }}</ref>

=== Upper turning points of business cycle, commodity prices and freight rates ===
There is often a close timing relationship between the upper turning points of the business cycle, commodity prices and freight rates, which is shown to be particularly tight in the grand peak years of 1873, 1889, 1900 and 1912.<ref>Jan Tore Klovland {{cite web |url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeexehis/v_3a46_3ay_3a2009_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a266-284.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-30 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222133500/http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeexehis/v_3a46_3ay_3a2009_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a266-284.htm |archive-date=2014-02-22 }}</ref>

===Recurrence quantification analysis===
[[Recurrence quantification analysis]] has been employed to detect the characteristic of business cycles and [[economic development]]. To this end, Orlando et al.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Orlando |first1=Giuseppe |last2=Zimatore |first2=Giovanna |title=RQA correlations on real business cycles time series |journal=Indian Academy of Sciences – Conference Series |date=18 December 2017 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=35–41 |doi=10.29195/iascs.01.01.0009|doi-access=free }}</ref> developed the so-called recurrence quantification correlation index to test correlations of RQA on a sample signal and then investigated the application to business time series.

=== Cycles or fluctuations? ===

The Business Cycle follows changes in stock prices which are mostly caused by external factors such as socioeconomic conditions, inflation, exchange rates. [[Intellectual capital]] does not affect a company stock's current earnings. [[Intellectual capital]] contributes to a stock's return growth.<ref>copied from Wikipedia article [[Intellectual capital]] [https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.652.9595&rep=rep1&type=pdf] The Impact of Intellectual Capital on a Firm’s Stock Return | Evidence from Indonesia | Ari Barkah Djamil, Dominique Razafindrambinina, Caroline Tandeans | Journal of Business Studies Quarterly 2013, Volume 5, Number 2</ref>

In recent years economic theory has moved towards the study of ''economic fluctuation'' rather than a "business cycle"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mankiw |first1=Gregory |year=1989 |title=Real Business Cycles: A New Keynesian Perspective |journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=79–90 |issn=0895-3309 |jstor=1942761 |doi=10.1257/jep.3.3.79|doi-access=free }}</ref> – though some economists use the phrase 'business cycle' as a convenient shorthand. For example, [[Milton Friedman]] said that calling the business cycle a "cycle" is a [[misnomer]], because of its non-cyclical nature. Friedman believed that for the most part, excluding very large supply shocks, business declines are more of a monetary phenomenon.<ref>{{cite book|title=Money in Historical Perspective|last=Schwartz|first=Anna J.|year=1987 |publisher= University of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226742281 |pages=24–77 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w2DFBgAAQBAJ&pg=PR4 }}</ref>

== Proposed explanations ==
The explanation of fluctuations in aggregate economic activity is one of the primary concerns of [[macroeconomics]] and a variety of theories have been proposed to explain them.

=== Exogenous vs. endogenous ===
Within economics, it has been debated as to whether or not the fluctuations of a business cycle are attributable to external (exogenous) versus internal (endogenous) causes. In the first case shocks are stochastic, in the second case shocks are deterministically chaotic and embedded in the economic system.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Orlando |first1=Giuseppe |last2=Zimatore |first2=Giovanna |title=Business cycle modeling between financial crises and black swans: Ornstein–Uhlenbeck stochastic process vs Kaldor deterministic chaotic model |journal=Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science |date=August 2020 |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=083129 |doi=10.1063/5.0015916}}</ref> The classical school (now neo-classical) argues for exogenous causes and the [[underconsumptionist]] (now Keynesian) school argues for endogenous causes. These may also broadly be classed as "supply-side" and "demand-side" explanations: supply-side explanations may be styled, following [[Say's law]], as arguing that "[[supply creates its own demand]]", while demand-side explanations argue that [[effective demand]] may fall short of supply, yielding a recession or depression.

This debate has important policy consequences: proponents of exogenous causes of crises such as neoclassicals largely argue for minimal government policy or regulation ([[laissez faire]]), as absent these external shocks, the market functions, while proponents of endogenous causes of crises such as Keynesians largely argue for larger government policy and regulation, as absent regulation, the market will move from crisis to crisis. This division is not absolute – some classicals (including Say) argued for government policy to mitigate the damage of economic cycles, despite believing in external causes, while [[Austrian School]] economists argue against government involvement as only worsening crises, despite believing in internal causes.

The view of the economic cycle as caused exogenously dates to [[Say's law]], and much debate on endogeneity or exogeneity of causes of the economic cycle is framed in terms of refuting or supporting Say's law; this is also referred to as the "[[general glut]]" (supply in relation to demand) debate.

Until the [[Keynesian revolution]] in mainstream economics in the wake of the [[Great Depression]], classical and neoclassical explanations (exogenous causes) were the mainstream explanation of economic cycles; following the Keynesian revolution, neoclassical macroeconomics was largely rejected. There has been some resurgence of neoclassical approaches in the form of [[real business cycle]] (RBC) theory.  The debate between Keynesians and neo-classical advocates was reawakened following the recession of 2007.

Mainstream economists working in the [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] tradition, as opposed to the Keynesian tradition, have usually viewed the departures of the harmonic working of the market economy as due to exogenous influences, such as the State or its regulations, labor unions, business monopolies, or shocks due to technology or natural causes.

Contrarily, in the heterodox tradition of [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]], [[Clément Juglar]], and [[Crisis theory|Marx]] the recurrent upturns and downturns of the market system are an endogenous characteristic of it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Mary S. |author-link=Mary S. Morgan |title=The History of Econometric Ideas |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0521373982 |pages=15–130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUpDzJM9lq0C&pg=PA15 }}</ref>

The 19th-century school of underconsumptionism also posited endogenous causes for the business cycle, notably the [[paradox of thrift]], and today this previously heterodox school has entered the mainstream in the form of [[Keynesian economics]] via the [[Keynesian revolution]].

=== Mainstream Economics ===
Mainstream economics views business cycles as essentially "the random summation of random causes". In 1927, [[Eugen Slutzky]] observed that summing random numbers, such as the last digits of the Russian state lottery, could generate patterns akin to that we see in business cycles, an observation that has since been repeated many times. This caused economists to move away from viewing business cycles as a cycle that needed to be explained and instead viewing their apparently cyclical nature as a methodological artefact. This means that what appear to be cyclical phenomena can actually be explained as just random events that are fed into a simple linear model. Thus business cycles are essentially random shocks that average out over time. Mainstream economists have built models of business cycles based the idea that they are caused by random shocks.<ref>Drautzburg, Thorsten. "Why Are Recessions So Hard to Predict? Random Shocks and Business Cycles." Economic Insights 4, no. 1 (2019): 1-8.</ref><ref>Slutzky, Eugen. "The summation of random causes as the source of cyclic processes."

Business Review 3 (2000): 27-37.</ref> Due to this inherent randomness, recessions can sometimes not occur for decades; for example, Australia, as of 2018, has not experienced a recession since 1991.<ref>Greg O’Brien, [https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BriefingBook46p/LastRecession 27 years and counting since Australia’s last recession], Parliament of Australia, 10.12.18</ref> 

While economists have found it difficult to forecast recessions or determine their likely severity, research indicates that longer expansions do not cause following recessions to be more severe.<ref>Tasci, Murat, and Nicholas Zevanove. "Do Longer Expansions Lead to More Severe Recessions?." Economic Commentary 2019-02 (2019).</ref>

=== Keynesian ===
According to [[Keynesian economics]], fluctuations in [[aggregate demand]] cause the economy to come to short run equilibrium at levels that are different from the full employment rate of output. These fluctuations express themselves as the observed business cycles. Keynesian models do not necessarily imply periodic business cycles. However, simple Keynesian models involving the interaction of the Keynesian multiplier and accelerator give rise to cyclical responses to initial shocks. [[Paul Samuelson]]'s "oscillator model"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Samuelson | first1 = P. A. | year = 1939 | title = Interactions between the multiplier analysis and the principle of acceleration | journal = Review of Economic Statistics | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 75–78 | doi=10.2307/1927758| jstor = 1927758 }}</ref> is supposed to account for business cycles thanks to the multiplier and the accelerator. The amplitude of the variations in economic output depends on the level of the investment, for investment determines the level of aggregate output (multiplier), and is determined by aggregate demand (accelerator).

In the Keynesian tradition, [[Richard M. Goodwin|Richard Goodwin]]<ref>R. M. Goodwin (1967) "A Growth Cycle", in C.H. Feinstein, editor, ''Socialism, Capitalism and Economic Growth''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press</ref> accounts for cycles in output by the distribution of income between business profits and workers' wages. The fluctuations in wages are almost the same as in the level of employment (wage cycle lags one period behind the employment cycle), for when the economy is at high employment, workers are able to demand rises in wages, whereas in periods of high unemployment, wages tend to fall. According to Goodwin, when unemployment and business profits rise, the output rises.

=== Credit/debt cycle ===
{{main|Credit cycle|Debt deflation}}
One alternative theory is that the primary cause of economic cycles is due to the [[credit cycle]]: the net expansion of credit (increase in private credit, equivalently debt, as a percentage of GDP) yields economic expansions, while the net contraction causes recessions, and if it persists, depressions. In particular, the bursting of [[speculative bubble]]s is seen as the proximate cause of depressions, and this theory places finance and banks at the center of the business cycle.

A primary theory in this vein is the [[debt deflation]] theory of [[Irving Fisher]], which he proposed to explain the [[Great Depression]]. A more recent complementary theory is the [[Financial Instability Hypothesis]] of [[Hyman Minsky]], and the credit theory of economic cycles is often associated with [[Post-Keynesian economics]] such as [[Steve Keen]].

[[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian]] economist [[Hyman Minsky]] has proposed an explanation of cycles founded on fluctuations in credit, interest rates and financial frailty, called the [[Financial Instability Hypothesis]]. In an expansion period, interest rates are low and companies easily borrow money from banks to invest. Banks are not reluctant to grant them loans, because expanding economic activity allows business increasing cash flows and therefore they will be able to easily pay back the loans. This process leads to firms becoming excessively indebted, so that they stop investing, and the economy goes into recession.

While credit causes have not been a primary theory of the economic cycle within the mainstream, they have gained occasional mention, such as {{Harv|Eckstein|Sinai|1986}}, cited approvingly by {{Harv|Summers|1986}}.

=== Real business-cycle theory ===
{{main|Real business-cycle theory}}
Within mainstream economics, Keynesian views have been challenged by [[real business cycle]] models in which fluctuations are due to random changes in the total productivity factor (which are caused by changes in technology as well as the legal and regulatory environment). This theory is most associated with [[Finn E. Kydland]] and [[Edward C. Prescott]], and more generally the [[Chicago school of economics]] ([[freshwater economics]]). They consider that economic crisis and fluctuations cannot stem from a [[monetary shock]], only from an external shock, such as an innovation.<ref>Drautzburg, Thorsten. "Why Are Recessions So Hard to Predict? Random Shocks and Business Cycles." Economic Insights 4, no. 1 (2019): 1-8.</ref>

=== Product based theory of economic cycles ===
[[File:Product based theory of economic cycles.png|thumb|International product life cycle]]
This theory explains the nature and causes of economic cycles from the viewpoint of life-cycle of marketable goods.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vernon | first1 = R. | year = 1966 | title = International Investment and International Trade in the Product Cycle | url = http://rcin.org.pl/Content/56666| journal = Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 22–26 | doi= 10.2307/1880689| jstor = 1880689 }}</ref> The theory originates from the work of  [[Raymond Vernon]], who described the development of international trade in terms of product life-cycle –  a period of time during which the product circulates in the market. Vernon stated that some countries specialize in the production and export of technologically new products, while others specialize in the production of already known products. The most developed countries are able to invest large amounts of money in the technological innovations and produce new products, thus obtaining a dynamic comparative advantage over developing countries.

Recent research by Georgiy Revyakin proved initial Vernon theory and showed economic cycles in developed countries overran economic cycles in developing countries.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Revyakin | first1 = G. | year = 2017 | title = A new approach to the nature of economic cycles and their analysis in the global context | journal = Eureka: Social and Humanities | volume = 5 | pages = 27–37 | doi = 10.21303/2504-5571.2017.00425 | doi-access = free }}</ref>He also presumed economic cycles with different periodicity can be compared to the products with various life-cycles. In case of [[Kondratiev waves]] such products correlate with fundamental discoveries implemented in production (inventions which form the [[technological paradigm]]: Richard Arkwright's machines, steam engines, industrial use of electricity, computer invention, etc.);  [[Kuznets swing|Kuznets cycles]] describe such products as infrastructural components (roadways, transport, utilities, etc.); [[Juglar cycles]] may go in parallel with enterprise fixed capital (equipment, machinery, etc.), and  [[Kitchin cycle]]s are characterized by change in the society preferences (tastes) for [[consumer goods]], and time, which is necessary to start the production.

Highly competitive market conditions would determine simultaneous technological updates of all economic agents (as a result, cycle formation): in case if a manufacturing technology at an enterprise does not meet the current technological environment, – such company loses its competitiveness and eventually goes bankrupt.

=== Political business cycle ===
Another set of models tries to derive the business cycle from political decisions. The political business cycle theory is strongly linked to the name of [[Michał Kalecki]] who discussed "the reluctance of the 'captains of industry' to accept government intervention in the matter of employment".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kalecki|first=Michal|title=Political Aspects of Full Employment|date=January 1970|url=http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2010/kalecki220510.html|access-date=2 May 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407014237/http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2010/kalecki220510.html|archive-date=7 April 2012}}</ref>  Persistent [[full employment]] would mean increasing workers' bargaining power to raise wages and to avoid doing unpaid labor, potentially hurting profitability. However, he did not see this theory as applying under [[fascism]], which would use direct force to destroy labor's power.

In recent years, proponents of the "electoral business cycle" theory have argued that incumbent politicians encourage prosperity before elections in order to ensure re-election – and make the citizens pay for it with recessions afterwards.<ref>{{Cite document | url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w1838 |doi = 10.3386/w1838|title = Elections and Macroeconomic Policy Cycles|year = 1986|last1 = Rogoff|first1 = Kenneth|last2 = Sibert|first2 = Anne}}</ref> The political business cycle is an alternative theory stating that when an administration of any hue is elected, it initially adopts a contractionary policy to reduce inflation and gain a reputation for economic competence. It then adopts an expansionary policy in the lead up to the next election, hoping to achieve simultaneously low inflation and unemployment on election day.<ref>• Allan Drazen, 2008.

The ''partisan business cycle'' suggests that cycles result from the successive elections of administrations with different policy regimes. Regime A adopts expansionary policies, resulting in growth and inflation, but is voted out of office when inflation becomes unacceptably high. The replacement, Regime B, adopts contractionary policies reducing inflation and growth, and the downwards swing of the cycle. It is voted out of office when unemployment is too high, being replaced by Party A.

=== Marxian economics ===
For Marx, the economy based on production of commodities to be sold in the market is intrinsically prone to [[Crisis (Marxian)|crisis]]. In the [[Heterodox economics|heterodox]] Marxian view, profit is the major engine of the market economy, but business (capital) profitability has a [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall|tendency to fall]] that recurrently creates crises in which mass unemployment occurs, businesses fail, remaining capital is centralized and concentrated and profitability is recovered. In the long run, these crises tend to be more severe and the system will eventually fail.<ref>Henryk Grossmann ''Das Akkumulations – und Zusammenbruchsgesetz des kapitalistischen Systems (Zugleich eine Krisentheorie)'', Hirschfeld, Leipzig, 1929</ref>

Some Marxist authors such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]] viewed the lack of purchasing power of workers as a cause of a tendency of supply to be larger than demand, creating crisis, in a model that has similarities with the Keynesian one. Indeed, a number of modern authors have tried to combine Marx's and Keynes's views. [[Henryk Grossman]]<ref>Grossman, Henryk The Law of Accumulation and Breakdown of the Capitalist System. Pluto</ref> reviewed the debates and the counteracting tendencies and [[Paul Mattick]] subsequently emphasized the basic differences between the Marxian and the Keynesian perspective. While Keynes saw capitalism as a system worth maintaining and susceptible to efficient regulation, Marx viewed capitalism as a historically doomed system that cannot be put under societal control.<ref>Paul Mattick, ''Marx and Keynes: The Limits of Mixed Economy'', Boston, Porter Sargent, 1969</ref>

The American mathematician and economist [[Richard M. Goodwin]] formalised a Marxist model of business cycles known as the [[Goodwin Model]] in which recession was caused by increased bargaining power of workers (a result of high employment in boom periods) pushing up the wage share of national income, suppressing profits and leading to a breakdown in [[capital accumulation]]. Later theorists applying variants of the Goodwin model have identified both short and long period profit-led growth and distribution cycles in the United States and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barbosa-Filho | first1 = Nelson H. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Lance | year = 2006 | title = Distributive and Demand Cycles in the US Economy – A Structuralist Goodwin Model | journal = Metroeconomica | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 389–411 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-999x.2006.00250.x}}</ref><ref>Peter Flaschel, G.

=== Austrian School ===
{{main|Austrian business cycle theory}}
Economists of the heterodox [[Austrian School]] argue that business cycles are caused by excessive issuance of credit by banks in [[fractional reserve banking]] systems. According to Austrian economists, excessive issuance of bank credit may be exacerbated if [[central bank]] monetary policy sets interest rates too low, and the resulting expansion of the money supply causes a "boom" in which resources are misallocated or [[malinvestment|"malinvested"]] because of artificially low interest rates. Eventually, the boom cannot be sustained and is followed by a "bust" in which the malinvestments are liquidated  (sold for less than their original cost) and the money supply contracts.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Block|first1=Walter|last2=Garschina|first2=Kenneth|title=Hayek, Business Cycles and Fractional Reserve Banking: Continuing the De-Homogenization Process|url=https://mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/rae9_1_3.pdf|website=www.mises.org|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|access-date=28 July 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910205248/http://mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/RAE9_1_3.pdf|archive-date=10 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Shostak|first1=Dr. Frank|title=Fractional Reserve banking and boom-bust cycles|url=https://mises.org/journals/scholar/shostak2.pdf|website=www.mises.org|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|access-date=28 July 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714030329/http://mises.org/journals/scholar/shostak2.pdf|archive-date=14 July 2012}}</ref>

One of the criticisms of the [[Austrian business cycle theory#Criticisms|Austrian business cycle theory]] is based on the observation that the [[United States]] suffered recurrent economic crises in the 19th century, notably the [[Panic of 1873]], which occurred prior to the establishment of a U.S. central bank in 1913.  Adherents of the [[Austrian School]], such as the historian [[Thomas Woods]], argue that these earlier financial crises were prompted by government and bankers' efforts to expand credit despite restraints imposed by the prevailing gold standard, and are thus consistent with [[Austrian Business Cycle Theory]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Woods Jr.|first1=Thomas|title=Can We Live Without the Fed?|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/woods/woods219.html|website=www.lewrockwell.com|publisher=Lew Rockwell|access-date=27 July 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313212821/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/woods/woods219.html|archive-date=13 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Woods Jr.|first1=Thomas|title=Economic Cycles Before the Fed|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxcjT8T3EGU|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=Mises Media|access-date=27 July 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912194610/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxcjT8T3EGU|archive-date=12 September 2014}}</ref>

The Austrian explanation of the business cycle differs significantly from the [[mainstream economics|mainstream]] understanding of business cycles and is generally rejected by mainstream economists.

An inverted yield curve is often a harbinger of [[recession]].  A positively sloped yield curve is often a harbinger of [[inflation]]ary growth.  Work by Arturo Estrella and Tobias Adrian has established the predictive power of an inverted yield curve to signal a recession.  Their models show that when the difference between short-term interest rates (they use 3-month T-bills) and long-term interest rates (10-year Treasury bonds) at the end of a federal reserve tightening cycle is negative or less than 93 basis points positive that a rise in unemployment usually occurs.<ref>Arturo Estrella and Tobias Adrian, ''[http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr397.pdf FRB of New York Staff Report No. 397] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906031016/http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr397.pdf |date=2015-09-06 }}'', 2009</ref>  The [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York|New York Fed]] publishes a [http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/capital_markets/ycfaq.html monthly recession probability prediction] derived from the yield curve and based on Estrella's work.

All the recessions in the [[United States]] since 1970 (up through 2017) have been preceded by an inverted yield curve (10-year vs. 3-month).

Estrella and others have postulated that the yield curve affects the business cycle via the balance sheet of banks (or [[Shadow banking system|bank-like financial institutions]]).<ref>Arturo Estrella, ''[https://ssrn.com/abstract=1532309 FRB of New York Staff Report No. 421] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061128/https://ssrn.com/abstract=1532309 |date=2013-09-21 }}'', 2010</ref>  When the yield curve is inverted banks are often caught paying more on short-term deposits (or [[Repurchase agreement|other forms]] of short-term wholesale funding) than they are making on long-term loans leading to a loss of profitability and reluctance to lend resulting in a [[credit crunch]].  When the yield curve is upward sloping, banks can profitably take-in short term deposits and make long-term loans so they are eager to supply credit to borrowers. This eventually leads to a [[Economic bubble|credit bubble]].

Many social indicators, such as mental health, crimes, and suicides, worsen during economic recessions (though general mortality tends to fall, and it is in expansions when it tends to increase).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ruhm | first1 = C | s2cid = 51729569 | year = 2000 | title = Are Recessions Good for Your Health? | url = http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/C_Ruhm_Are_2000.pdf| journal = Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume = 115 | issue = 2| pages = 617–650 | doi=10.1162/003355300554872}}</ref> As periods of economic stagnation are painful for the many who lose their jobs, there is often political pressure for governments to mitigate recessions. Since the 1940s, following the [[Keynesian revolution]], most governments of developed nations have seen the mitigation of the business cycle as part of the responsibility of government, under the rubric of [[stabilization policy]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perez|first=Carlota|date=March 2013|title=Unleashing a golden age after the financial collapse: Drawing lessons from history|journal=Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions|volume=6|pages=9–23|doi=10.1016/j.eist.2012.12.004|issn=2210-4224}}</ref>

Since in the Keynesian view, recessions are caused by inadequate aggregate demand, when a recession occurs the government should increase the amount of aggregate demand and bring the economy back into equilibrium.  This the government can do in two ways, firstly by increasing the money supply (expansionary [[monetary policy]]) and secondly by increasing government spending or cutting taxes (expansionary fiscal policy).

By contrast, some economists, notably [[New classical economics|New classical economist]] [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], argue that the [[welfare cost of business cycles]] are very small to negligible, and that governments should focus on long-term growth instead of stabilization.

However, even according to [[Keynesian theory]], managing [[economic policy]] to smooth out the cycle is a difficult task in a society with a complex economy. Some theorists, notably those who believe in [[Marxian economics]], believe that this difficulty is insurmountable. [[Karl Marx]] claimed that recurrent [[Crises (economic)|business cycle crises]] were an inevitable result of the operations of the [[capitalism|capitalistic system]]. In this view, all that the government can do is to change the ''timing'' of economic crises. The crisis could also show up in a different ''form'', for example as severe [[inflation]] or a steadily increasing [[deficit spending|government deficit]]. Worse, by delaying a crisis, government policy is seen as making it ''more dramatic'' and thus more painful.

Additionally, since the 1960s [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]] have played down the ability of Keynesian policies to manage an economy.  Since the 1960s, economists like Nobel Laureates [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Edmund Phelps]] have made ground in their arguments that inflationary expectations negate the [[Phillips curve]] in the long run.  The [[1973–75 recession|stagflation of the 1970s]] provided striking support for their theories while proving a dilemma for Keynesian policies, which appeared to necessitate both expansionary policies to mitigate recession and contractionary policies to reduce inflation.
Friedman has gone so far as to argue that all the [[central bank]] of a country should do is to avoid making large mistakes, as he believes they did by contracting the money supply very rapidly in the face of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], in which they made what would have been a recession into the [[Great Depression]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
