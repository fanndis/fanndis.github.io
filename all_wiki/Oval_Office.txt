The '''Oval Office''' is the formal, working [[office]] space of the [[President of the United States]]. It is located in the [[West Wing]] of the [[White House]], in [[Washington, D.C.]], part of the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]]

The oval-shaped room features three large south-facing windows behind the president's desk, and a fireplace at the north end. It has four doors: the east door opens to the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]]; the west door leads to a [[Oval Office Study|private study]] and dining room; the northwest door opens onto the main corridor of the West Wing; and the northeast door opens to the office of the president's secretary.

Presidents generally decorate the office to suit their personal taste, choosing new furniture, new drapery, and designing their own oval-shaped carpet to cover most of the floor. Artwork is selected from the White House's own collection, or borrowed from museums for the president's term in office.

President Theodore Roosevelt built the West Wing in 1902, but his Executive Office was not oval-shaped. The '''Taft Oval Office''' was built as part of the West Wing's 1909 expansion, and was centered on the building's south façade&mdash;like the oval rooms of the White House residence, such as the [[Yellow Oval Room]]. It served Presidents Taft through Franklin Roosevelt, but suffered a major fire in 1929, and was demolished in 1933. President Franklin Roosevelt built the '''modern Oval Office''' in 1934, as part of an addition to the West Wing's east facade.

==Cultural history==
The Oval Office has become associated in Americans' minds with the presidency itself through memorable images, such as a young [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]] peering through the front panel of his father's desk, President [[Richard Nixon]] speaking by telephone with the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts during their moonwalk, and [[Amy Carter]] bringing her [[Siamese cat]] Misty Malarky Ying Yang to brighten her father President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s day. Several presidents have [[Oval Office address|addressed the nation from the Oval Office]] on occasion. Examples include Kennedy presenting news of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (1962), Nixon [[SP 3-125: Richard Nixon's address announcing his intention to resign the presidency|announcing his resignation from office]] (1974),<ref>{{cite news|last1=Herbers|first1=John|title=The 37th President Is First to Quit Post|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/990808onthisday_big.html#article|accessdate=6 February 2017|work=The New York Times|issue=9 August 1974}}</ref> [[Ronald Reagan]] following the [[Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] (1986),<ref>{{cite web|title=Address to the Nation on the Explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger|url=https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/address-nation-explosion-space-shuttle-challenger|website=reaganlibrary.gov|accessdate=11 October 2020}}</ref>, and [[George W.

===Washington's Bow Window===
[[George Washington]] never occupied the [[White House]]. He spent most of his presidency in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], which served as the temporary national capital for 10 years, 1790–1800, while [[Washington, D.C.]] was under construction.

In 1790, Washington built a large, two-story, semi-circular addition to the rear of the [[President's House (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|President's House in Philadelphia]], creating a ceremonial space in which the public would meet the president.<ref>[https://www.whitehousehistory.org/questions/why-is-the-oval-office-oval Why is the Oval Office oval?] from White House Historical Association.</ref> Standing before the three windows of this Bow Window, he formally received guests for his Tuesday afternoon [[audience (meeting)|audiences]], delegations from Congress and foreign dignitaries, and the general public at open houses on [[New Year's Day]], the [[Fourth of July]], and his birthday.

<blockquote>Washington received his guests, standing between the windows in his back drawing-room. The company, entering a front room and passing through an unfolding door, made their salutations to the President, and turning off, stood on one side.<ref>"Recollections of Judge John B. Wallace," ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'', vol. 2 (1878), p. 175.</ref></blockquote>

President [[John Adams]] occupied the Philadelphia mansion beginning in March 1797, and used the Bow Window in the same manner as his predecessor.<ref>David McCullough, ''[[John Adams (book)|John Adams]]'' (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2001), p. 490.</ref>

Curved foundations of Washington's Bow Window were uncovered during a 2007 archaeological excavation of the [[President's House (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|President's House]] site.<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/news/inq050907.htm A Window with Its Place in History]. ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', May 9, 2007.</ref> They are exhibited under glass at the President's House Commemoration, just north of the [[Liberty Bell Center]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/presidentshouse/plans/digbowwindow.htm|title=Photos of the archaeology.}}</ref>

===White House===
[[File:Yellow Oval Room 1886.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Yellow Oval Room]] as President [[Grover Cleveland]]'s library and study, 1886. Note his use of the [[Resolute Desk|''Resolute'' desk]].]]
Architect [[James Hoban]] visited President Washington in Philadelphia in June 1792 and would have seen the Bow Window.<ref>"There can be little doubt that in Washington's bow can be found the seed that was later to flower in the oval shape of the Blue Room." William Seale, ''The President's House, A History'' (Washington, D. C., 1986), 8.</ref> The following month, he was named winner of the design competition for the White House.

The "elliptic salon" at the center of the White House was the outstanding feature of Hoban's original plan. An oval interior space was a [[Baroque]] concept that was adapted by [[Neoclassicism]]. Oval rooms became common in 18th-century neoclassical architecture.

In November 1800, [[John Adams]] became the first president to occupy the White House. He and his successor, President [[Thomas Jefferson]], used Hoban's oval rooms in the same ceremonial manner that Washington had used the Bow Window, standing before the three windows at the south end to receive guests.<ref>William Seale, "James Hoban: Builder of the White House," in ''White House History no. 22'' (Spring 2008), pp. 8–12.</ref>

During the 19th century, a number of presidents used the White House's second-floor [[Yellow Oval Room (White House)|Yellow Oval Room]] as a private office or library.

===West Wing===
The [[West Wing]] was the idea of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], brought about by his wife's opinion that the second floor of the White House, then shared between bedrooms and offices, should be just a domestic space. Completed in 1902, the one-story Executive Office Building was intended to be a temporary structure, for use until a permanent building was erected on that site or elsewhere.<ref>Architect [[Daniel Burnham]] recommended that it be erected on the opposite side of Pennsylvania Avenue in [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Park]], to assure that it would remain a temporary building. Seale, ''The President's House'', p. 664.</ref> Building it to the west of the White House allowed for the removal of a vast, dilapidated set of pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] greenhouses that had been constructed by President [[James Buchanan]].<ref>The greenhouses were disassembled and relocated.</ref> Roosevelt relocated the offices of the [[executive branch]] to the newly constructed wing in 1902. His workspace was a two-room suite of Executive Office and Cabinet Room, that occupied the eastern third of the building. Its furniture, including the [[Theodore Roosevelt desk|president's desk]], was designed by architect [[Charles Follen McKim]] and executed by [[A. H. Davenport and Company]], of Boston.<ref>William Allman, White House Curator, "Oval Office Tour, December 1, 2008," CSPAN documentary, 14:45.</ref>

==Taft Oval Office: 1909–1933==
[[Image:TaftOval1909.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Taft Oval Office, completed 1909. Nearly identical in size to the modern office, it was damaged by fire in 1929 and demolished in 1933.]]
President [[William Howard Taft]] made the West Wing a permanent building, expanding it southward, doubling its size, and building the first Oval Office.<ref>Seale, ''The President's House'', p. 895.</ref> Designed by [[Nathan C. Wyeth]] and completed in 1909, the office was centered on the south facade of the building, much as the oval rooms in the White House are. Taft intended it to be the hub of his administration, and, by locating it in the center of the West Wing, he could be more involved with the day-to-day operation of his presidency. The Taft Oval Office had simple Georgian Revival trim, and was likely the most colorful in history; the walls were covered with vibrant seagrass green burlap.<ref>"The White House: Inside America's Most Famous Home" – CSPAN Documentary</ref>

On December 24, 1929, during President [[Herbert Hoover]]'s administration, a fire severely damaged the West Wing. Hoover used this as an opportunity to create more space, excavating a partial basement for additional offices. He restored the Oval Office, upgrading the quality of trim and installing air-conditioning. He also replaced the furniture, which had undergone no major changes in twenty years.

==Modern Oval Office: 1934–present==
[[File:White House West Wing - 1st Floor with the Oval Office highlighted.png|thumb|230px|left|Location of the Oval Office in the [[West Wing]].]]
[[File:FDR Oval Office in 1934 LOC37952v cropped.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The newly built Oval Office in 1934.]]
Dissatisfied with the size and layout of the West Wing, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] engaged New York architect [[Eric Gugler]] to redesign it in 1933. To create additional space without increasing the apparent size of the building, Gugler excavated a full basement, added a set of subterranean offices under the adjacent lawn, and built an unobtrusive "penthouse" story. The directive to wring the most office space out of the existing building was responsible for its narrow corridors and cramped staff offices. Gugler's most visible addition was the expansion of the building eastward for a new Cabinet Room and Oval Office.<ref>Seale, ''The President's House'', pp. 946–49.</ref>

The modern Oval Office was built at the West Wing's southeast corner, offering Roosevelt, who was physically disabled and used a [[wheelchair]], more privacy and easier access to the Residence. He and Gugler devised a room architecturally grander than the previous two rooms, with more robust Georgian details: doors topped with substantial pediments, bookcases set into niches, a deep bracketed cornice, and a ceiling medallion of the [[Seal of the President of the United States|Presidential Seal]]. Rather than a chandelier or ceiling fixture, the room is illuminated by light bulbs hidden within the cornice that "wash" the ceiling in light.<ref>Seale, ''The President's House'', p. 948.</ref> In small ways, hints of [[Art Moderne]] can be seen, in the sconces flanking the windows and the representation of the eagle in the ceiling medallion. Roosevelt and Gugler worked closely together, often over breakfast, with Gugler sketching the president's ideas. One notion resulting from these sketches that has become fixed in the layout of the room's furniture, is that of two high back chairs in front of the fireplace. The public sees this most often with the president seated on the left, and a visiting head of state on the right. This allowed Roosevelt to be seated, with his guests at the same level, de-emphasizing his inability to stand. Construction of the modern Oval Office was completed in 1934.

===Decoration===
[[Image:OvalMedallion.jpg|thumb|230px|Plaster ceiling medallion installed in 1934 includes elements of the [[Seal of the President of the United States]].]]
The basic Oval Office furnishings have been a desk in front of the three windows at the south end, a pair of chairs in front of the fireplace at the north end, a pair of sofas, and assorted tables and chairs. The [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] mantel was made for the Taft Oval Office in 1909, and salvaged after the 1929 West Wing fire.<ref>William Allman, White House Curator, "Oval Office Tour, December 1, 2008," CSPAN documentary, 00:45.[http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/282818-1]</ref> A tradition of displaying potted Swedish ivy (''[[Plectranthus verticillatus]]'') atop the [[Fireplace mantel|mantel]] goes back to the administration of [[John F. Kennedy]], and the current plants were rooted from the original plant.

A [[Federal furniture|Federal]] longcase clock, made in Boston by John and Thomas Seymour c. 1795–1805 &ndash; commonly known as the [[Oval Office grandfather clock]] &ndash; was purchased by the White House Historical Association in 1972, and has stood next to the Oval Office's northeast door since 1975.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehousehistory.org/photos/treasures-of-the-white-house-seymour-tall-case-clock|title=Treasures of the White House: Seymour Tall Case Clock|work=WHHA|access-date=2017-06-08|language=en}}</ref>

The carpet of the Oval Office bears the [[Seal of the President of the United States|Seal of the President]]. President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s oval carpet was the first to incorporate the presidential seal. In Truman's carpet, the seal was represented monochromatically through varying depths of the cut pile. His carpet was used in the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Kennedy administrations. Since then, most administrations have created their own rug, working with an interior designer and the [[White House Office of the Curator|Curator of the White House]]. As part of her overall restoration of the White House, Jacqueline Kennedy had a redecoration of the Oval Office begun on November 21, 1963, when she accompanied President John F. Kennedy on a trip to Texas. The next day, November 22, a new carpet was installed just as the Kennedys were making their way through Dallas and the president was assassinated.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brandus|first=Paul|title=Under This Roof The White House and the Presidency—21 Presidents, 21 Rooms, 21 Inside Stories|date=September 2015|publisher=Globe Pequot Press / Lyons Press|isbn=978-1-4930-0834-6|page=208}}</ref>

====Desks====
[[File:Caroline Kennedy Kerry Kennedy Resolute Desk a.jpg|thumb|left|[[Caroline Kennedy]] and [[Kerry Kennedy]] beneath the [[Resolute desk|''Resolute'' desk]] in 1963]]
[[List of Oval Office desks|Six desks]] have been used in the Oval Office by U.S. presidents. The [[Theodore Roosevelt desk]] was used by Roosevelt in his (non-oval) office at the southeast corner of the West Wing. Subsequently, it was used in the Oval Office by seven presidents – most recently by Eisenhower.

Also popular is the [[Resolute Desk|''Resolute'' Desk]], so named because it was made from the timbers of the British frigate [[HMS Resolute (1850)|HMS ''Resolute'']]. The ship had been frozen in [[Arctic]] ice and abandoned but was later found and freed by American seamen. It was refurbished and presented as a gift from the [[United States]] to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1856. When the ship was decommissioned from the [[Royal Navy]] in 1879, Queen Victoria ordered twin desks made from its timbers, keeping one and presenting the other as a gift to President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in 1880. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered a kneehole panel with the [[Seal of the President of the United States|Presidential Seal]] added, but work was not completed until after his 1945 death in office. First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] had the desk restored, and she was the first to place it in the Oval Office. Following the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|1963 assassination of President Kennedy]], the desk toured the country as part of a traveling exhibit for the [[John F. Kennedy Library|Kennedy Presidential Library]] and was then lent to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. President [[Jimmy Carter]] brought the desk back to the Oval Office in the 1970s. Since then, presidents [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], [[Barack Obama]] and [[Donald Trump]] have also used it as their Oval Office desk.

When not in use in the Oval Office, a desk is often placed in the adjacent Oval Office Study, in the White House, or is used by the vice president.

====Artwork====
[[File:Barack Obama with Oval Office art.jpg|thumb|Barack Obama with Oval Office artwork]]
Art may be selected from the White House collection, or may be borrowed from museums or individuals for the length of an administration.

Most presidents have hung a portrait of [[George Washington]] – usually the [[Rembrandt Peale]] "Porthole" portrait or the [[Charles Willson Peale]] three-quarter-length portrait – over the mantel at the north end of the room. A portrait of [[Andrew Jackson]] by [[Thomas Sully]] hung in [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s office, and in Ronald Reagan's, [[George H. W. Bush]]'s and Bill Clinton's. A portrait of [[Abraham Lincoln]] by George Henry Story hung in George W. Bush's office, and continued in Barack Obama's. Three landscapes/cityscapes by minor artists – ''[[City of Washington from Beyond the Navy Yard]]'' by [[George Cooke (painter)|George Cooke]], ''Eastport and Passamaquoddy Bay'' by Victor de Grailly, and ''The President's House'', a copy after [[William Henry Bartlett]] – have adorned the walls in multiple administrations. ''[[The Avenue in the Rain]]'' by [[Childe Hassam]] and ''[[Working on the Statue of Liberty]]'' by [[Norman Rockwell]] flanked the ''Resolute'' Desk in Bill Clinton's office, and did the same in Barack Obama's.

Statuettes, busts, heads, and figurines are frequently displayed in the Oval Office. Abraham Lincoln has been the most common subject, in works by sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]], [[Gutzon Borglum]], [[Adolph Alexander Weinman]], [[Leo Cherne]] and others. Over time, traditional busts of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson or Benjamin Franklin have given way to heads of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman or Dwight Eisenhower. Western bronzes by [[Frederic Remington]] have been frequent choices: Lyndon Johnson displayed ''[[Bronco Buster|The Bronco Buster]]'', as did [[Gerald Ford]], Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Presidents Reagan and Bush added its companion piece, ''[[The Rattlesnake (Remington)|The Rattlesnake]]''. Harry S. Truman displayed Remington's oil painting ''[[Fired On]]''.

President Harry S. Truman displayed works related to his home state of [[Missouri]], illustrations of [[biplanes]], and models of jet-airplanes. He hung a large photograph of the White House portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt, under whom he had served as vice president and who died in office in 1945. President Dwight Eisenhower filled the office walls with landscape paintings, as well as a painting of [[Robert E. Lee]].<ref>{{citation

Kennedy surrounded himself with paintings of naval battles from the [[War of 1812]], photographs of sailboats, and ship models. President Lyndon Johnson installed sconces on either side of the mantel, and added the office's first painting by a woman artist, ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'' by [[Elizabeth Shoumatoff]]. President Richard Nixon tried three different George Washington portraits over the mantel, and hung a copy of ''[[Earthrise]]'' – a photograph of the earth taken from the moon's orbit during the [[Apollo 8]] mission – beside his desk. President Gerald Ford displayed tasteful, conservative works, paintings that remained mostly in place through the administrations of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. President George H. W. Bush added [[Luminism (American art style)|luminist]] landscapes. President Bill Clinton chose the Childe Hassam and Norman Rockwell paintings mentioned above, along with ''[[Waiting for the Hour]]'' by William T. Carlton,<ref>[http://www.virginiamemory.com/online_classroom/shaping_the_constitution/doc/waiting ''Waiting for the Hour''] from Virginia Memory.</ref> a genre painting showing African-Americans gathered in anticipation of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] going into effect. President George W. Bush mixed traditional works with paintings by Texas artists and Western sculptures. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, British [[Tony Blair|Prime Minister Tony Blair]] lent him a [[bust of Winston Churchill (Epstein)|bust of Winston Churchill]], who had guided Great Britain through World War II. President Barack Obama honored Abraham Lincoln with the portrait by Story, a bust by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation. Below the proclamation was a [[bust of Martin Luther King Jr. (Alston)|bust of Martin Luther King Jr.]] by [[Charles Alston]],<ref name="Jet1">{{cite news |title=Clinton announces first image of a Black is on display at the White House |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60377326.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323022029/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60377326.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 23, 2015 |newspaper=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |date=March 14, 2000 |accessdate=July 24, 2013}}</ref> and in the nearby bookcase was a program from the [[March on Washington|August 28, 1963, March on Washington]], at which King gave his "[[I Have a Dream Speech]]."

===Redecoration===
A tradition evolved in the latter part of the twentieth century of each new administration redecorating the office to the president's liking. A new administration usually selects an oval [[carpet]], new [[drapery]], the paintings on the walls, and some furniture. Most incoming presidents continue using the rug of their predecessor until their new one is installed. The retired carpet very often is then moved to the presidential library of the president for whom it was made.

The redecoration of the Oval Office is usually coordinated by the [[First Lady of the United States|first lady's]] office in the [[East Wing]], working with an interior designer and the [[White House Curator|White House curator]].

===Alterations===
[[Image:OvalFloor.jpg|thumb|The Oval Office floor has been replaced several times, most recently during the administration of [[George W. Bush]]. The 2005 installation, based on the original 1933 design by Eric Gugler, features a contrasting cross pattern of [[quarter sawn]] oak and walnut.]]
Since the present Oval Office's construction in 1934 during the administration of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] the room has remained mostly unchanged architecturally.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} More than any president, Roosevelt left an impression on the room and its use. Doors and window frames have been modified slightly.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} A screen door on the east wall was removed after the installation of air conditioning. President Lyndon B. Johnson's row of wire service Teletype machines on the southeast wall required cutting plaster and flooring to accommodate wiring.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The Georgian style plaster ornament has been cleaned to remove accumulated paint, and a series of electrified wall [[sconce (light fixture)|sconces]] have come and gone.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Though some presidents have chosen to do day-to-day work in a smaller study just west of the Oval Office, most use the actual Oval Office for work and meetings. Traffic from the large numbers of staff, visitors, and pets over time takes its toll. There have been four sets of flooring in the Oval Office. The original floor was made of [[cork (material)|cork]] installed over soft wood; however, President Eisenhower was an avid [[golf]]er and damaged the floor with his golf spikes. Johnson had the floor replaced in the mid-1960s with wood-grain [[linoleum]]. In 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] had the floor replaced with quarter sawn oak and walnut, in a cross parquet pattern similar in design to Eric Gugler's 1933 sketch, which had never been installed. In August 2005, the floor was replaced again under President [[George W. Bush]], in exactly the same pattern as the Reagan floor.

===Conservation===
In the late 1980s, a comprehensive assessment of the entire house, including the Oval Office, was made as part of the [[National Park Service]]'s [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] <small>(HABS)</small>.<ref>{{HABS |survey=DC-37 |id=dc0402 |title=White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Northwest, Washington, District of Columbia, DC |photos=599 |color=3 |dwgs=41 |data=8 |cap=35}}</ref> Detailed photographs and measured drawings were made documenting the interior and exterior and showing even slight imperfections. A checklist of materials and methods was generated for future conservation and restoration.

He replaced the leather sofas and chairs with upholstered furniture, and added the 6 cane-back armchairs that are still used in the modern Oval Office.
