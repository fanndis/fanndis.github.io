Bates originally wrote the words as a poem, "'''Pikes Peak'''", first published in the [[Fourth of July]] edition of the church periodical ''The Congregationalist'' in 1895. At that time, the poem was titled "America" for publication. Ward had originally written the music, "Materna", for the hymn "[[O Mother dear, Jerusalem]]" in 1882, though it was not first published until 1892.<ref>{{cite book|last=McKim|first=LindaJo|title=The Presbyterian Hymnal Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kde8yd0INHsC&pg=PA379|page=379|publisher=John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Kentucky|accessdate=2012-06-22|year=1993|isbn=9780664251802}} (McKim notes that Ward mailed a friend a postcard in which he stated the hymn had been composed in 1882, however).</ref> Ward's music combined with the Bates poem was first published in 1910 and titled "America the Beautiful".

==History==
[[File:Americathebeautiful.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Commemoration plaque atop Pikes Peak in July 1999]]

In 1893, at the age of 33, Bates, an English professor at [[Wellesley College]], had taken a train trip to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], Colorado, to teach a short summer school session at [[Colorado College]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/09/news/cl-1924|title=A Stirring Story Behind 'America the Beautiful'|last=Cooney|first=Beth|date=2001-11-09|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-08-21|issn=0458-3035|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125121425/http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/09/news/cl-1924|archivedate=January 25, 2017}}</ref> Several of the sights on her trip inspired her, and they found their way into her poem, including the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]], the "White City" with its promise of the future contained within its gleaming white buildings;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1238.htm|title=No. 1238: 1893 Exhibition|website=www.uh.edu|access-date=2017-08-21|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118033520/http://uh.edu/engines/epi1238.htm|archivedate=January 18, 2017}}</ref> the wheat fields of America's heartland [[Kansas]], through which her train was riding on July 16; and the majestic view of the [[Great Plains]] from high atop [[Pikes Peak]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200000001/|title=America the Beautiful|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2017-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705125158/https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200000001/|archive-date=July 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=FromSeatoShiningSea>{{Cite book |last = Ponder |first = Melinda M. |title = Katharine Lee Bates: From Sea to Shining Sea |publisher=Windy City Publishers |year=2017 |location=Chicago, IL|isbn = 9781941478479}}</ref>

On the pinnacle of that mountain, the words of the poem started to come to her, and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original [[Antlers Hilton Hotel|Antlers Hotel]]. The poem was initially published two years later in ''The Congregationalist'' to commemorate [[Independence Day (United States)|the Fourth of July]]. It quickly caught the public's fancy. An amended version was published in 1904.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Sylvester|s2cid=220810886|date=October 31, 1918|title=America the Beautiful|journal=The Journal of Education|volume=88|issue=16 (2202)|pages=428â€“429|doi=10.1177/002205741808801607|jstor=42767143}}</ref>

The first known melody written for the song was sent in by Silas Pratt when the poem was published in ''The Congregationalist''. By 1900, at least 75 different melodies had been written.<ref name="Collins2009">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SXYDQAAQBAJ|title=Stories Behind the Hymns That Inspire America: Songs That Unite Our Nation|author=Ace Collins|date=30 August 2009|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-86685-5|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508141241/https://books.google.com/books?id=3SXYDQAAQBAJ|archivedate=May 8, 2018}}</ref> A [[hymn tune]] composed in 1882 by [[Samuel A. Ward]], the organist and choir director at [[Grace Church, Newark]], was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Just as Bates had been inspired to write her poem, Ward, too, was inspired. The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from [[Coney Island]] back to his home in [[New York City]] after a leisurely summer day and he immediately wrote it down. He composed the tune for the old hymn "O Mother Dear, Jerusalem", retitling the work "Materna". Ward's music combined with Bates's poem were first published together in 1910 and titled "America the Beautiful".<ref>{{cite book

Ward died in 1903, not knowing the national stature his music would attain. Bates was more fortunate, since the song's popularity was well established by the time of her death in 1929.<ref name="Collins2009" /> It is included in songbooks in many religious congregations in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|title=America the Beautiful|url=http://hymnary.org/o_beautiful_for_spacious_skies/|access-date=2019-09-16|website=Hymnary.org|language=en}}</ref>

At various times in the more than one hundred years that have elapsed since the song was written, particularly during the [[John F. Kennedy]] administration, there have been efforts to give "America the Beautiful" legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to, or in place of, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", but so far this has not succeeded. Proponents prefer "America the Beautiful" for various reasons, saying it is easier to sing, more melodic, and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as "The Star-Spangled Banner". Some prefer "America the Beautiful" over "The Star-Spangled Banner" due to the latter's war-oriented imagery; others prefer "The Star-Spangled Banner" for the same reason. While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem, "America the Beautiful" continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of Americans, and was even being considered before 1931 as a candidate to become the national anthem of the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/america-the-beautiful-p2-2456277 |title=Who Wrote "America the Beautiful"?

O great for halcyon skies,
For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties
Above the enameled plain!
America! America!
God shed His grace on thee,
Till souls wax fair as earth and air
And music-hearted sea!

O great for pilgrim feet
Whose stern, impassioned stress
A thoroughfare for freedom beat
Across the wilderness!
America! America!
God shed His grace on thee
Till paths be wrought through wilds of thought
By pilgrim foot and knee!

O great for glory-tale
Of liberating strife,
When once or twice, for man's avail,
Men lavished precious life!
America! America!
God shed His grace on thee
Till selfish gain no longer stain,
The banner of the free!

O great for patriot dream
That sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam
Undimmed by human tears!
America! America!
God shed His grace on thee
Till nobler men keep once again
Thy whiter jubilee!</poem>

Till all success be nobleness,

[[Bing Crosby]] included the song in a medley on his album ''[[101 Gang Songs]]'' (1961).

[[Frank Sinatra]] recorded the song with [[Nelson Riddle]] during the sessions for ''[[The Concert Sinatra]]'' in February 1963, for a projected 45 single release. The 45 was not commercially issued however, but the song was later added as a bonus track to the enhanced 2012 CD release of ''[[The Concert Sinatra]]''.

In 1976, while the United States celebrated its bicentennial, a soulful version popularized by [[Ray Charles]] peaked at number 98 on the US R&B chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/ray-charles/chart-history/r-b-hip-hop-songs/7|title=Ray Charles Chart History: R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>{{efn|Ray Charles' 1972 recording of this song was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2005.}}

==Idioms==
"From sea to shining sea", originally used in the charters of some of the English Colonies in North America, is an American [[idiom]] meaning "from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]" (or vice versa). Other songs that have used this phrase include the American patriotic song "[[God Bless the U.S.A.]]" and [[Schoolhouse Rock]]'s "Elbow Room". The phrase and the song are also the namesake of the [[Shining Sea Bikeway]], a [[bike path]] in Bates's hometown of [[Falmouth, Massachusetts]]. The phrase is similar to the Latin phrase "''{{Lang|la|[[A Mari Usque Ad Mare]]}}''" ("From sea to sea"), which is the official motto of [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Gary|title=From sea to shining sea|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/from%20sea%20to%20shining%20sea.html|website=Phrases.org|accessdate=24 July 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718031848/http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/from%20sea%20to%20shining%20sea.html|archivedate=July 18, 2014}}</ref>

"Purple mountain majesties" refers to the shade of the [[Pikes Peak]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], which inspired Bates to write the poem.<ref>http://www.americanheritage.org/Elementary_Extraction_15-America_the_Beautiful_TX.pdf {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904222648/http://www.americanheritage.org/Elementary_Extraction_15-America_the_Beautiful_TX.pdf |date=September 4, 2012 }}</ref>

In the 2003 [[Tori Amos]] song "Amber Waves," the "America the Beautiful" lyric "for amber waves of grain" is appropriated to create a [[personification]]; Amos imagines Amber Waves as an exotic dancer, like she by the same name, portrayed by [[Julianne Moore]], in ''[[Boogie Nights]]''.

==Books==
[[Lynn Sherr]]'s 2001 book ''America the Beautiful'' discusses the origins of the song and the backgrounds of its authors in depth. The book points out that the poem has [[Common meter|the same meter]] as that of "[[Auld Lang Syne]]"; the songs can be sung interchangeably. Additionally, Sherr discusses the evolution of the lyrics, for instance, changes to the original third verse written by Bates.<ref name= "Sherr2001">{{cite book |title=America the Beautiful: The Stirring True Story Behind Our Nation's Favorite Song |first=Lynn |last=Sherr |publisher=PublicAffairs |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-58648-085-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HdSmeAv3v-oC&pg=PA78 |page=78 |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref>

Melinda M. Ponder, in her 2017 biography ''Katharine Lee Bates: From Sea to Shining Sea'',<ref name=FromSeatoShiningSea /> draws heavily on Bates's diaries and letters to trace the history of the poem and its place in American culture.
