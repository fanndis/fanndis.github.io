'''Esports''' (also known as '''electronic sports''', '''e-sports''', or '''eSports''') is a form of [[sport]] competition using [[video game]]s.<ref name="whatisesports">{{cite journal |last1=Hamari |first1=Juho |last2=Sjöblom |first2=Max |date=2016 |title=What is eSports and why do people watch it? |ssrn=2686182 |journal=Internet Research |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=211–232 |doi=10.1108/IntR-04-2016-0085}}</ref> Esports often takes the form of organized, [[multiplayer video game]] competitions, particularly between [[professional sports|professional]] players, individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been a part of [[video game culture]], these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through [[live streaming]] saw a large surge in popularity.<ref name=2012Forbes /><ref name=FieldOfStreams /> By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events.

The most common [[video game genres]] associated with esports are [[multiplayer online battle arena]] (MOBA), [[first-person shooter]] (FPS), [[Fighting game|fighting]], [[Digital collectible card game|card]], [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] and [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) games. Popular esport franchises include ''[[League of Legends]]'', ''[[Dota]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', ''[[Street Fighter]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' and ''[[StarCraft]]'', among many others. Tournaments such as the [[League of Legends World Championship|''League of Legends'' World Championship]],  [[The International (Dota 2)|''Dota 2''{{'s}} International]], the fighting game-specific [[Evolution Championship Series]] (EVO) and [[Intel Extreme Masters]] are among the most popular in esports. Many other competitions use a series of league play with sponsored teams, such as the [[Overwatch League]]. Although the legitimacy of esports as a true sporting competition remains in question, they have been featured alongside traditional sports in some multinational events in Asia, with the [[International Olympic Committee]] also having discussed their inclusion into future Olympic events.

By the late 2010s, it was estimated that the total audience of esports would grow to 454 million viewers, with revenue increasing to over {{USD}}1 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-videogames-outlook-idUSKCN1Q11XY|title=Global esports revenues to top $1 billion in 2019: report|date=12 February 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=21 May 2019|language=en}}</ref> The increasing availability of online [[streaming media]] platforms, particularly [[YouTube]] and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], have become central to the growth and promotion of esports competitions.<ref name=FieldOfStreams /> Despite viewership being approximately 85% male and 15% female, with a majority of viewers between the ages of 18 and 34, female gamers have also played professionally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/major-league-gaming-reports-334-percent-growth-in-live-video-6400010 |title=Major League Gaming reports COWS GO MOO 334 percent growth in live video |website=GameSpot |date=14 November 2012 |access-date=8 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngaudiosi/2012/04/28/team-evil-geniuses-manager-anna-prosser-believes-more-female-gamers-will-turn-pro/ |title=Team Evil Geniuses Manager Anna Prosser Believes More Female Gamers Will Turn Pro |magazine=Forbes |author=John Gaudiosi |date=28 April 2012 |access-date=8 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngaudiosi/2012/07/29/taipei-assassins-manager-erica-tseng-talks-growth-of-female-gamers-in-league-of-legends/ |title=Taipei Assassins Manager Erica Tseng Talks Growth Of Female Gamers In League Of Legends |author=John Gaudiosi |date=29 July 2012 |access-date=8 October 2013 |work=Forbes}}</ref> The popularity and recognition of esports first took place in Asia, specifically in China and South Korea, with the latter having licensed professional players since 2000. Despite its large video game industry, esports in Japan is relatively underdeveloped, with this being largely attributed to its broad [[Gambling in Japan|anti-gambling laws]] which prohibit paid professional gaming tournaments.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2036844/why-gamers-in-asia-are-the-worlds-best-esport-athletes.html |title=Why gamers in Asia are the world's best eSport athletes |author=Andrew Groen |magazine=PC World |date=14 May 2013 |access-date=7 October 2013}}</ref><ref name="bloomberg olympics 2024"/> Outside of Asia, esports are also popular in Europe and the Americas, with both regional and international events taking place in those regions.

==History==

===Early history (1972–1989)===
[[File:Space Invaders Championship.jpg|thumb|left|Attendees of the 1981 ''[[Space Invaders]]'' Championships attempt to set the highest score]]

The earliest known video game competition took place on 19 October 1972 at [[Stanford University]] for the game ''[[Spacewar (video game)|Spacewar]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rise of Esports|url=https://www.racergamingchairs.com/blogs/gaming/the-rise-of-esports|website=Racer Gaming Chairs}}</ref> Stanford students were invited to an "Intergalactic spacewar olympics" whose grand prize was a year's subscription for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', with Bruce Baumgart winning the five-man-free-for-all tournament and Tovar and Robert E.

The [[Golden age of arcade video games]] was heralded by [[Taito]]'s ''[[Space Invaders]]'' in 1978, which popularized the use of a persistent [[high score]] for all players. Several video games in the next several years followed suit, adding other means of tracking high scores such with high score tables that included the players' initials in games like ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' in 1979. High score-chasing became a popular activity and a means of competition.<ref name="goldenage arcade esports">{{cite journal | title = Pioneering E-Sport: The Experience Economy and the Marketing of Early 1980s Arcade Gaming Contests | first1 = Michael | last1 = Borowy | first2 = Dal Yong | last2 = Jin | journal = International Journal of Communication | volume = 7 | date = 2013 | pages = 2254–2274 | issn = 1932-8036 }}</ref> The [[Space Invaders#In popular culture|Space Invaders Championship]] held by [[Atari]] in 1980 was the earliest large scale video game competition, attracting more than 10,000 participants across the United States, establishing competitive gaming as a mainstream hobby.<ref name="eg_2_36">{{cite journal |title=Players Guide To Electronic Science Fiction Games |journal=[[Electronic Games]] |date=March 1982 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=35–45 [36] |url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1982-03/Electronic_Games_Issue_02_Vol_01_02_1982_Mar#page/n35/mode/1up |access-date=1 February 2012}}</ref> [[Walter Day]] owner of an arcade in Iowa, had taken it upon himself to travel across the United States to record the high scores on various games in 1980, and on his return, founded [[Twin Galaxies]], a high score record-keeping organization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/walter-day-leaves-twin-galaxies |title=Walter Day leaves Twin Galaxies |date=8 March 2010 |access-date=18 September 2013 |first=Tom |last=Bramwell |work=EuroGamer}}</ref> The organization went on to help promote video games and publicize its records through publications such as the Guinness Book of World Records, and in 1983 it created the [[U.S. National Video Game Team]].

The 1988 game ''[[Netrek]]'' was an [[Internet game]] for up to 16 players, written almost entirely in [[cross-platform]] [[open source software]]. ''Netrek'' was the [[History of online games|third Internet game]], the first Internet game to use [[metaserver]]s to locate open game servers, and the first to have persistent [[user information]]. In 1993 it was credited by ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' as "the first online sports game".<ref>{{cite web |author=Kevin Kelly |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.06/netrek.html |title=The First Online Sports Game |publisher=wired.com |date=Dec 1993 |access-date=1 July 2013}}</ref>

===Growth and online video games (1990–1999)===
The [[fighting game]] ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' (1991) popularized the concept of direct, tournament-level competition between two players.<ref name="egm_influential_sf2">{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Eric L.|title=EGM Feature: The 5 Most Influential Japanese Games Day Four: Street Fighter II|url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/egm-featurethe-5-most-influential-japanese-gamesday-four-street-fighter-ii/|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|access-date=17 April 2012|date=3 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314064721/http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/egm-featurethe-5-most-influential-japanese-gamesday-four-street-fighter-ii/|archive-date=14 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Previously, video games most often relied on [[high score]]s to determine the best player, but this changed with ''Street Fighter II'', where players would instead challenge each other directly, "face-to-face," to determine the best player,<ref name="egm_influential_sf2"/> paving the way for the competitive [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] and [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] modes found in modern [[action game]]s.<ref name="barton_sf2">{{cite book|title=Vintage games: an insider look at the history of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the most influential games of all time|year=2009|publisher=Focal Press/Elsevier|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-240-81146-8|pages=239–255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_bFdsP9L7oC|author=Matt Barton|author2=Bill Loguidice |access-date=17 April 2012}}</ref> The popularity of fighting games such as ''[[Street Fighter]]'' and ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' in the 1990s led to the foundation of the international [[Evolution Championship Series]] (EVO) esports tournament in 1996.

Large esports tournaments in the 1990s include the 1990 [[Nintendo World Championships]], which toured across the United States, and held its finals at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] in California. [[Nintendo]] held a 2nd World Championships in 1994 for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] called the [[Nintendo PowerFest '94]]. There were 132 finalists that played in the finals in [[San Diego]], California.  Mike Iarossi took home 1st prize. [[Blockbuster Video]] also ran their own World Game Championships in the early 1990s, co-hosted by [[GamePro]] magazine.  Citizens from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Chile were eligible to compete.  Games from the 1994 championships included ''[[NBA Jam (1993 video game)|NBA Jam]]'' and ''[[Virtua Racing]]''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Blockbuster Video World Game Championship Guide |publisher=GamePro Magazine |date=June 1994 |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/lampbane/150765934/}}</ref>

Television shows featuring esports during this period included the British shows ''[[GamesMaster]]'' and ''[[Bad Influence!]]'' the Australian game show ''[[A*mazing]]'', where in one round contestants competed in a video game face off, and the Canadian game show ''[[Video & Arcade Top 10]]''.

In the 1990s, many games benefited from increasing [[internet connectivity]], especially [[PC game]]s. Tournaments established in the late 1990s include the [[Cyberathlete Professional League]] (CPL), [[QuakeCon]], and the [[Professional Gamers League]]. PC games played at the CPL included the ''[[Counter-Strike (series)|Counter-Strike]]'' series, ''[[Quake series|Quake]]'' series, ''[[StarCraft (video game)|StarCraft]]'', and ''[[Warcraft (series)|Warcraft]]''.

===Global tournaments (2000–present)===
The growth of esports in South Korea is thought to have been influenced by the mass building of [[broadband Internet]] networks following the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/technology/league-of-legends-south-korea-epicenter-esports.html?_r=0 |title=For South Korea, E-Sports Is National Pastime |last=Mozur |first=Paul |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=19 October 2014 |access-date=13 June 2015}}</ref> It is also thought that the high [[unemployment rate]] at the time caused many people to look for things to do while out of work.<ref>{{cite book |title=Korea's Online Gaming Empire |first=Dal Yong |last=Jin |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |year=2010}}</ref> Instrumental to this growth of esports in South Korea was the prevalence of the Komany-style [[internet café]]/[[LAN gaming center]], known as a [[PC bang]]. The [[Korean e-Sports Association]], an arm of the [[Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism]], was founded in 2000 to promote and regulate esports in the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.e-sports.or.kr/board.php?b_no=9&_module=kespa&_page=view&b_no=9&b_pid=9999989400 |title=History of Korea e-Sports Association 1999–2004 |publisher=KeSPA |access-date=7 October 2013 |language=ko}}</ref>

"[[Evo Moment 37]]", also known as the "Daigo Parry", refers to a portion of a ''[[Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike]]'' semi-final match held at [[Evolution Championship Series 2004]] (Evo 2004) between [[Daigo Umehara]] and [[Justin Wong]]. During this match, Umehara made an unexpected [[Comeback (sports)|comeback]] by parrying 15 consecutive hits of Wong's "Super Art" move while having only one pixel of [[health (gaming)|vitality]]. Umehara subsequently won the match. "Evo Moment #37" is frequently described as the most iconic and memorable moment in the history of competitive video gaming. Being at one point the most-watched competitive gaming moment of all time, it has been compared to sports moments such as [[Babe Ruth's called shot]] and the [[Miracle on Ice]].<ref name=KotakuBook>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/someone-wrote-a-book-about-street-fighters-greatest-mat-1563009143|work=[[Kotaku]]|title=Someone Wrote A Book About Street Fighter's Greatest Match|last=Narcisse|first=Evan|date=14 April 2014}}</ref>

In April 2006 the [[G7 teams]] federation were formed by seven prominent ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' teams. The goal of the organization was to increase stability in the esports world, particularly in standardizing player transfers and working with leagues and organizations. The founding members were [[4Kings]], [[Fnatic]], [[Made in Brazil (esports)|Made in Brazil]], [[Mousesports]], [[NiP]], [[SK-Gaming]], [[Team 3D (esports)|Team 3D]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fnatic.com/content/1155 |title=G7 teams launched |author=G7 Federation |date=20 April 2006 |website=[[Fnatic]] |access-date=12 June 2015}}</ref> The organization only lasted until 2009 before dissolving.<ref name="raising">{{cite book |title=Raising the Stakes: E-Sports and the Professionalization |first=TL |last=Taylor |year=2013}}</ref>

The 2000s was a popular time for televised esports. Television coverage was best established in South Korea, with ''[[StarCraft]]'' and ''[[Warcraft III]]'' competitions regularly televised by dedicated 24-hour cable TV game channels [[Ongamenet]] and [[MBCGame]].<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/11/BUG8SQC59E1.DTL |title=League beginning for video gamers |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=11 June 2007 |access-date=4 June 2012 |first=Ryan |last=Kim}}</ref> Elsewhere, esports television coverage was sporadic.

During the 2010s, esports grew tremendously, incurring a large increase in both viewership and prize money.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=2011: The Year of eSports |magazine=PCWorld |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/214432/2011_the_year_of_esports.html |date=29 December 2010 |author=Patrick Miller |access-date=15 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-201402121100--tms--invideogctnzs-c20140212-20140212,0,643102.story |title='Ender's Game' Blu-ray gets ESports tournament |date=12 February 2014 |access-date=20 February 2014 |first=John |last=Gaudiosi |work=Chicago Tribune |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226233042/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-201402121100--tms--invideogctnzs-c20140212-20140212,0,643102.story |archive-date=26 February 2014 }}</ref> Although large tournaments were founded before the 21st century, the number and scope of tournaments has increased significantly, going from about 10 tournaments in 2000 to about 260 in 2010.<ref name="FieldOfStreams">{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/30/4719766/twitch-raises-20-million-esports-market-booming |title=Field of Streams: How Twitch Made Video Games a Spectator Sport |work=The Verge |author=Ben Popper |date=30 September 2013 |access-date=9 October 2013}}</ref> Many successful tournaments were founded during this period, including the [[World Cyber Games]], the [[Intel Extreme Masters]], and [[Major League Gaming]]. The proliferation of tournaments included experimentation with competitions outside traditional esports genres. For example, the September 2006 [[FUN Technologies]] Worldwide Webgames Championship featured 71 contestants competing in [[casual games]] for a $1 million grand prize.<ref>{{cite web |title=Casual gamer gets serious prize |author=Tim Surette |work =GameSpot |date=11 September 2006 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/puzzle/zumadeluxe/news.html?sid=6157427}}</ref>

The popularity and emergence of [[streaming media|online streaming services]] have helped the growth of esports in this period, and are the most common method of watching tournaments. [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], an online streaming platform launched in 2011, routinely streams popular esports competitions. In 2013, viewers of the platform watched 12 billion minutes of video on the service, with the two most popular Twitch broadcasters being ''[[League of Legends]]'' and ''[[Dota 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/twitch-growth-esports-streaming-mlg-youtube-2013/ |title=Twitch dominated streaming in 2013, and here are the numbers to prove it |work=The Daily Dot |author=Patrick Howell O'Neill |date=16 January 2014 |access-date=9 November 2014}}</ref> During one day of The International, Twitch recorded 4.5 million unique views, with each viewer watching for an average of two hours.<ref name=FieldOfStreams/>

The modern esports boom has also seen a rise in video games companies embracing the esports potential of their products. After many years of ignoring and at times suppressing the esports scene, [[Nintendo]] hosted Wii Games Summer 2010.

To help promote esports as a legitimate sport, several esports events have been run alongside more traditional international sports competitions. The [[2007 Asian Indoor Games]] was the first notable multi-sport competition including esports as an official medal-winning event alongside other traditional sports, and the later editions of the [[Asian Indoor Games]] and its successor the [[Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games]] have always included esports as an official medal event or an exhibition event up to now. Moreover, the [[Asian Games]], which is the Asian top-level multi-sport competition, will also include esports as a medal event at the [[2022 Asian Games|2022 edition]]; esports around games such as ''Hearthstone'', ''Starcraft II'', and ''League of Legends'' were [[Esports at the 2018 Asian Games|presented as an exhibition event]] at the [[2018 Asian Games]] as a lead-in to the 2022 games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://compete.kotaku.com/esports-will-become-a-medal-event-at-the-2022-asian-gam-1794431163 |title=Esports Will Become A Medal Event At The 2022 Asian Games |first=Maddy |last=Myers |date=18 April 2017 |access-date=18 April 2017 |work=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref><ref name="ap 2018 asian games"/> The [[2019 Southeast Asian Games]] included six medal events for esports.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/esports-is-an-official-medal-event-at-the-southeast-asian-games/ | title = Esports is an official medal event at the Southeast Asian Games  |first = Fraser | last =Brown | date = 28 November 2018 | access-date = 28 November 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>

===Olympic Games recognition===
The [[Olympic Games]] are also seen as a potential method to legitimize esports.  A summit held by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in October 2017 acknowledged the growing popularity of esports, concluding that "Competitive 'esports' could be considered as a sporting activity, and the players involved prepare and train with an intensity which may be comparable to athletes in traditional sports" but would require any games used for the Olympics fitting "with the rules and regulations of the Olympic movement".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/e-sports-gets-closer-to-being-part-of-the-olympics-games-2017-10 |title=E-sports just got closer to being part of the Olympics |first=Karolos |last=Grohmann |date=28 October 2017 |access-date=5 November 2017 |work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> Another article by Andy Stout suggests that 106 million people viewed the 2017 Worlds Esports competition.<ref>Stout, A.

The issues around esports have not prevented the IOC from exploring what possibilities there are for incorporation into future Olympics. During July 2018, the IOC and the [[Global Association of International Sports Federations]] (GAISF) held a symposium and inviting major figures in esports, including [[Epic Games]]' [[Mark Rein (software executive)|Mark Rein]], [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s [[Mike Morhaime]], and esports players Dario "TLO" Wünsch, [[Jake (video game player)|Jacob "Jake" Lyon]], and [[Geguri|Se-yeon "Geguri" Kim]], for these organizations "to gain a deeper understanding of esports, their impact and likely future development, so that [they] can jointly consider the ways in which [they] may collaborate to the mutual benefit of all of sport in the years ahead".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://globalnews.ca/news/4340744/esports-in-olympics/ | title = Video gaming as an Olympic sport?

Leaders in Japan are becoming involved to help bring esports to the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] and beyond, given the country's reputation as a major video game industry center. Esports in Japan had not flourished due to the country's anti-gambling laws that also prevent paid professional gaming tournaments, but there were efforts starting in late 2017 to eliminate this issue.<ref name="bloomberg olympics 2024"/> At the suggestion of the [[Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games|Tokyo Olympic Games Committee]] for the [[2020 Summer Olympics]], four esports organizations have worked with Japan's leading [[consumer organization]] to exempt esports tournaments from gambling law restrictions.

{{main|List of esports games}}

A number of games are popular among professional competitors. The tournaments which emerged in the mid-1990s coincided with the popularity of [[fighting game]]s and [[first-person shooter]]s, genres which still maintain a devoted fan base. In the 2000s, [[real-time strategy]] games became overwhelmingly popular in South Korean [[internet café]]s, with crucial influence on the development of esports worldwide. Competitions exist for many titles and genres, though the most popular games as of the late 2010s are ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'', ''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'', ''[[Dota 2]]'', ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]'', ''[[Rocket League]]'', ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'', ''[[Hearthstone (video game)|Hearthstone]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros.

==Video game design==
{{see also|Video game design}}

While it is common for video games to be designed with the experience of the player in game being the only priority, many successful esports games have been designed to be played professionally from the beginning. Developers may decide to add dedicated esports features, or even make design compromises to support high level competition. Games such as ''StarCraft II'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5777029/the-sacrifices-of-starcraft-ii-made-in-the-name-of-esports |title=The Sacrifices of StarCraft II Made In The Name of Sports |publisher=Kotaku |author=Michael McWhertor |date=4 March 2011 |access-date=8 October 2013}}</ref> ''League of Legends'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/leagueoflegends/how-riot-games-are-building-better-league-legends-and-catching-their-own-success |title=How Riot Games are building a better League of Legends, and catching up to their own success |publisher=PC GamesN |author=robzacny |date=24 October 2012 |access-date=8 October 2013}}</ref> and ''Dota 2''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://esportsbusiness.com/valve-show-developers-how-to-support-esports-with-dota-2/ |title=Valve show developers how to support eSports with Dota 2 |publisher=Esports Business |author=Alan LaFleur |date=21 June 2012 |access-date=8 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222120743/http://esportsbusiness.com/valve-show-developers-how-to-support-esports-with-dota-2/ |archive-date=22 December 2013 }}</ref> have all been designed, at least in part, to support professional competition.

===Spectator mode===
In addition to allowing players to participate in a given game, many game developers have added dedicated observing features for the benefit of spectators. This can range from simply allowing players to watch the game unfold from the competing player's point of view, to a highly modified interface that gives spectators access to information even the players may not have.  The state of the game viewed through this mode may tend to be delayed by a certain amount of time in order to prevent either teams in a game from gaining a competitive advantage. Games with these features include ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'', ''[[Call of Duty]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gammagamers.com/black-ops-2-codcaster-system.html#.U67tWLEVCnY |title=Black Ops 2 CoDCaster System |publisher=Gamma Gamers |author=Steve Smith |date=15 August 2012 |access-date=28 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812141220/http://www.gammagamers.com/black-ops-2-codcaster-system.html#.U67tWLEVCnY |archive-date=12 August 2014 }}</ref> ''StarCraft II'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/starcraft/starcraft-2s-new-observer-ui-mod-tool-should-make-better-esports-broadcasts |title=StarCraft 2's new observer UI mod tool should make for better eSports broadcasts |publisher=PC GamesN |author=Jeremy Peel |date=16 January 2013 |access-date=3 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/7/29/4569606/starcraft-2-update-adds-new-esports-features-color-blind-mode |title=StarCraft 2 update adds new eSports features, color blind mode |website=Polygon |author=Michael McWhertor |date=29 July 2013 |access-date=3 November 2013}}</ref> ''Dota 2'',<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/08/17/dota-2-tournament-showcases-valves-e-sports-spectator-package/ |title=Dota 2 tournament showcases Valve's e-sports spectator package |magazine=PC Gamer |author=Tom Senior |date=17 August 2011 |access-date=3 November 2013}}</ref> and ''Counter-Strike''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/the-latest-counter-strike-go-update-is-for-spectators-263441.phtml |title=The latest Counter-Strike: GO update is for spectators |website=Destructoid |author=Jordan Devore |date=10 November 2013 |access-date=3 November 2013}}</ref> ''League of Legends'' includes spectator features, which are restricted to custom game modes.<ref name="Spectator FAQ">{{cite web |title=Spectator FAQ |publisher=Riot Games |url=http://na.leagueoflegends.com/spectator-faq |access-date=22 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/previews/the-full-breakdown-on-league-of-legends-spectator-mode/ |title=The full breakdown on League of Legends' Spectator Mode |magazine=PC Gamer |author=Lucas Sullivan |date=17 June 2011 |access-date=3 November 2013}}</ref>

In response to the release of [[virtual reality headset]]s in 2016, some games, such as ''Dota 2'', were updated to include virtual reality spectating support.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thursten |first1=Chris |title=Dota 2 Battle Pass update adds crazy new VR spectator mode |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/dota-2-battle-pass-update-adds-crazy-new-vr-spectator-mode/ |website=PC Gamer |access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref>

===Online===
A very common method for connection is the [[Internet]]. Game servers are often separated by region, but high quality connections allow players to set up real-time connections across the world. Downsides to online connections include increased difficulty detecting [[Cheating in online games|cheating]] compared to physical events, and greater [[Latency (engineering)|network latency]], which can negatively impact players' performance, especially at high levels of competition. Many competitions take place online, especially for smaller tournaments and [[exhibition game]]s.

Since the 1990s, professional teams or organized [[clan (computer gaming)|clans]] have set up matches via [[Internet Relay Chat]] networks such as [[QuakeNet]]. As esports have developed, it has also become common for players to use automated matchmaking clients built into the games themselves. This was popularized by the 1996 release of [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard's]] [[Battle.net]], which has been integrated into both the ''[[Warcraft (series)|Warcraft]]'' and ''[[StarCraft (series)|StarCraft]]'' series. Automated matchmaking has become commonplace in console gaming as well, with services such as [[Xbox Live]] and the [[PlayStation Network]]. After competitors have contacted each other, the game is often managed by a [[game server]], either remotely to each of the competitors, or running on one of the competitor's machines.

===Local area network===
{{further|LAN Party}}

Additionally, competitions are also often conducted over a [[local area network]] or LAN. The smaller network usually has very little [[lag]] and higher [[Quality of service|quality]]. Because competitors must be physically present, LANs help ensure fair play by allowing direct scrutiny of competitors. This helps prevent many forms of cheating, such as unauthorized hardware or software [[modding]]. The physical presence of competitors helps create a more social atmosphere at LAN events. Many gamers organize [[LAN parties]] or visit [[Internet café]]s, and most major tournaments are conducted over LANs.

Individual games have taken various approaches to LAN support. In contrast to the original ''[[StarCraft]]'',  ''[[StarCraft II]]'' was released without support for LAN play, drawing some strongly negative reactions from players.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why StarCraft II Still Doesn't Support Local Multiplayer |url=http://kotaku.com/5919892/why-starcraft-ii-still-doesnt-support-local-multiplayer |publisher=Kotaku |date=20 June 2012 |access-date=7 September 2013 |author=Jason Schreier}}</ref> ''League of Legends'' was originally released for online play only, but announced in October 2012 that a LAN client was in the works for use in major tournaments.<ref>{{cite web |title=League of Legends LAN version in development at Riot Games, Mac client news coming |url=http://www.polygon.com/2012/10/17/3515164/league-of-legends-lan-version-in-development-at-riot-games-mac-client |date=12 October 2012 |author=Michael McWhertor |website=Polygon |access-date=7 September 2013}}</ref> In September 2013, Valve added general support for LAN play to ''[[Dota 2]]'' in a patch for the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techinasia.com/dota-2-update-lan-feature-worth-excited/ |title=DOTA 2 update: Why the LAN feature is something worth being excited about |author=Xairylle |publisher=TechInAsia |date=20 September 2013 |access-date=23 September 2013}}</ref>

==Players and teams==
Professional gamers, or "pro gamers", are often associated with gaming teams and/or broader gaming associations. Teams like [[FaZe Clan]], [[100 Thieves]], [[Evil Geniuses]], [[Team SoloMid]], [[Cloud9 (eSports)|Cloud9]], [[Fnatic]], [[Mineski-Dota|Mineski]], [[Counter Logic Gaming]], [[SK Telecom T1|T1]], [[G2 Esports]], [[Team Envy]], and [[Natus Vincere]] consist of several professionals. These teams often cover multiple esports games within tournaments and leagues, with various team makeups for each game. They may also represent single players for one-on-one esports games like fighting games within [[Evolution Championship Series]], or ''Hearthstone'' tournaments. In addition to prize money from tournament wins, players in these teams and associations may also be paid a separate team salary. Team sponsorship may cover tournament travel expenses or gaming hardware. Prominent esports sponsors include companies such as [[Logitech]] and [[Razer USA|Razer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esfiworld.com/interview-with-razers-global-e-sports-manager-the-business-behind-sponsoring-teams/ |title=Interview with Razer's global e-sports manager: The business behind sponsoring teams |author=Brent Ruiz |date=3 February 2013 |publisher=ESFI World |access-date=10 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822230651/http://www.esfiworld.com/interview-with-razers-global-e-sports-manager-the-business-behind-sponsoring-teams/ |archive-date=22 August 2013 }}</ref> Teams feature these sponsors on their website, team jerseys<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.customesports.com |title=Custom Esports Jerseys and Apparel }}</ref> and on their social media, in 2016 the biggest teams have social media followings of over a million.<ref>{{Cite web |title=OpTic Gaming™ (@OpTicGaming) {{!}} Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/OpTicGaming|website=twitter.com|access-date=27 January 2016}}</ref> Associations include the [[Korean e-Sports Association]] (KeSPA), the [[International e-Sports Federation]] (IeSF), the [[British eSports Association|British esports Association]], and the [[World eSports Association|World esports Association]] (WESA).

Some traditional sporting athletes have invested in esports, such as [[Rick Fox]]'s ownership of [[Echo Fox]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-18/former-nba-player-rick-fox-buys-esports-team-gravity |title=Former NBA Player Rick Fox Buys eSports Team Gravity |first=Scott |last=Soshnick |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=18 December 2015 |access-date=18 December 2015}}</ref> [[Jeremy Lin]]'s ownership of [[Team VGJ]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Van Allen|first1=Eric|title=Jeremy Lin endorses new Dota 2 team VGJ|url=http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/17579673/jeremy-lin-endorse-new-dota-2-team-vgj|website=ESPN|access-date=5 October 2016}}</ref> [[Shaquille O'Neal]]'s investment in [[NRG Esports]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/17209251/shaq-nrg-esports-pick-overwatch-team |title=Shaq, NRG Esports pick up Overwatch team |publisher=ESPN}}</ref> Some association football teams, such as [[FC Schalke 04]] in Germany,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/esports/story/_/id/15552685/soccer-org-schalke-04-finalizes-league-championship-series-roster-picks-fox |title=Sources: Soccer org Schalke 04 finalizes League Championship Series roster, picks up Fox |work=espn.com}}</ref> [[Paris Saint-Germain eSports|Paris Saint-Germain esports]] in France;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/paris-saint-germain/story/2977336/psg-unveil-first-three-signings-in-ambitious-esports-venture |title=PSG unveil first three signings in ambitious eSports venture |first=Jonathan |last=Johnson |date=20 October 2016 |access-date=5 November 2016 |publisher=ESPN}}</ref> [[Besiktas JK]], [[Fenerbahce S.K.]], and [[Galatasaray]] in Turkey; [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] in Greece either sponsor or have complete ownership in esports teams.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Espor nedir?

While different from the regimens of traditional sports, esports athletes still have extensive training routines. Team Liquid, a professional League of Legends team, practice for a minimum of 50 hours per week and most play the game far more.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/pro-gamers-explain-the-insane-training-regimen-they-use-to-stay-on-top-2015-5|title=Here's the insane training schedule of a 20-something professional gamer|work=Business Insider|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref> In April 2020, researchers from the [[Queensland University of Technology]] found that some of the top esport players showed similar aspects of [[mental toughness]] as [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] athletes.<ref name="QUT-20200611">{{cite news |author=[[Queensland University of Technology]] |title=Elite gamers share mental toughness with top athletes, study finds - The influence of metnal toughness in elite esports |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-06/quot-egs061120.php |date=11 June 2020 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |access-date=11 June 2020 }}</ref><ref name="FIP-20200423">{{cite journal |author=Poulus, Dylan |display-authors=et al. |title=Stress and Coping in Esports and the Influence of Mental Toughness |date=23 April 2020 |journal=[[Frontiers in Psychology]] |volume=11 |page=628 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00628 |pmid=32390900 |pmc=7191198 |doi-access=free }}</ref> This training schedule for players has resulted in many of them retiring an early age.

==Leagues and tournaments==
{{see also|List of esports leagues and tournaments}}

=== Promotion and relegation leagues ===
In most team-based esports, organized play is centered around the use of [[promotion and relegation]] to move sponsored teams between leagues within the competition's organization based on how the team fared in matches; this follows patterns of professional sports in European and Asian countries. Teams will play a number of games across a season as to vie for top positioning in the league by the end of that season. Those that do well, in addition to prize money, may be promoted into a higher-level league, while those that fare poorly can be regulated downward. For example, until 2018 Riot Games runs several ''League of Legends'' series, with the [[League of Legends Championship Series]] being the top-tier series. Teams that did not do well were relegated to the [[League of Legends Challenger Series]], replaced by the better performing teams from that series. This format was discontinued when Riot opted to use the franchise format in mid-2018.

=== Franchised leagues ===
[[File:Fuel_vs_Excelsior_2019_Stage_3.jpg|thumb|right|A match from the second season of the Overwatch League, occurring at Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles]]
With rising interest in viewership of esports, some companies sought to create leagues that followed the franchise approach used in [[Professional sports league organization#Structure of North American leagues (Franchise and minor league system)|North American professional sports]], in which all teams, backed by a major financial sponsor to support the franchise, participate in a regular season of matches to vie for top standing as to participate in the post-season games. This approach is more attractive for larger investors, who would be more willing to back a team that remains playing in the esport's premiere league and not threatened to be relegated to a lower standing.<ref>{{cite web  | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/breaking/ct-spt-overwatch-league-esports-espn-20180726-story.html | title = What's Overwatch?

While there is no team promotion or relegation, players can be signed onto contracts, traded among teams, or let go as free agents, and new players may be pulled from the esports' equivalent [[minor league]].

The first such league to be formed was the [[Overwatch League]], established by [[Blizzard Entertainment]] in 2016 based on its ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' game.<ref name="wired">{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/overwatch-videogame-league-aims-to-become-new-nfl/ | title = The Overwatch Videogame League Aims to Become the New NFL | first = Nathan | last = Hill | date = 7 December 2017 | access-date = 7 December 2017 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> Initially launched in 2018 with 12 teams, the league expanded to twenty teams in 2019. Though the first two seasons were played at [[Blizzard Arena]] in Los Angeles, the Overwatch League's third season in 2020 will implement the typical home/away game format at esports arenas in the teams' various home cities or regions.<ref name="wapost codleague" />

[[Take-Two Interactive]] partnered with the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) to create the [[NBA 2K League]], using the ''[[NBA 2K]]'' game series. It is the first esports league to be operated by a professional sports league, and the NBA sought to have a League team partially sponsored by each of the 30 professional NBA teams. Its inaugural season is set to start May 2018 with 17 teams.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/nba-take-two-to-create-professional-videogame-league-1486616461 | title = NBA, Take-Two to Create Professional Videogame League | first = Sarah | last = Needleman | date = 9 February 2017 | access-date = 14 December 2017 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] }}</ref> Similarly, [[EA Sports]] and [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) established the eMLS in 2018, a league using EA's ''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/12/16880590/fifa-18-esports-world-cup-emls | title = MLS launching esports league for FIFA 18 World Cup | first = Samit | last = Sarkar | date = 12 January 2018 | access-date = 12 January 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>

[[Activision]] launched its 12-team [[Call of Duty League]] in January 2020, following the format of the Overwatch League but based on the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' series.<ref name="wapost codleague">{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/09/25/new-call-duty-esports-league-will-begin-play-home-markets-start-with-teams/ |title=  New Call of Duty esports league will begin play in home markets in 2020, start with 12 teams | first = Mike | last= Hume | date = 25 September 2019 | access-date = 28 September 2019 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}</ref>

Cloud9 and Dignitas, among others, have started development of a franchise-based ''Counter-Strike: Global Offensive'' league, Flashpoint, in February 2020. This will be the first such esports league to be owned by the teams rather than any single organization.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-02-05-team-owned-cs-go-esport-league-launched | title = Major esport organisations launch new team-owned CS:GO league | first = Haydn | last =Taylor | date = 6 February 2020 | access-date = 6 February 2020 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref>

===Tournaments===
[[File:Goście Intel Extreme Masters (8465481816).jpg|thumb|left|Casual players at the 2013 [[Intel Extreme Masters]] in [[Katowice]], [[Poland]]]]

Esports are also frequently played in tournaments, where potential players and teams vie to be placed through qualification matches before entering the tournament. From there, the tournament formats can vary from [[Single-elimination tournament|single]] or [[Double-elimination tournament|double elimination]], sometimes hybridized with [[Round-robin tournament|group stage]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gotfrag.com/portal/story/40273/ |title=GotFrag eSports – All Games News Story – TF2 Referees Wanted |publisher=Gotfrag.com |date=10 October 2007 |access-date=4 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528203921/http://www.gotfrag.com/portal/story/40273 |archive-date=28 May 2012}}</ref> Esports tournaments are almost always physical events in which occur in front of a live audience, with referees or officials to monitor for cheating. The tournament may be part of a larger gathering, such as [[Dreamhack]], or the competition may be the entirety of the event, like the [[World Cyber Games]] or the [[Fortnite World Cup]]. Esport competitions have also become a popular feature at gaming and multi-genre [[Fan convention|conventions]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Although competitions involving video games have long existed, esports underwent a significant transition in the late 1990s. Beginning with the [[Cyberathlete Professional League]] in 1997, tournaments became much larger, and [[sponsor (commercial)|corporate sponsorship]] became more common. Increasing viewership both in person and online brought esports to a wider audience.<ref name="2012Forbes">{{cite magazine |title=2012: The Year of eSports |magazine=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/12/20/2012-the-year-of-esports/ |date=20 December 2012 |first=Paul | last=Tassi |access-date=15 August 2013}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated4">{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0808/p13s01-alsp.html?entryBottomStory |title=Are video games a sport? |publisher=CS Monitor |first=Gloria | last=Goodale |date=8 August 2003 |access-date=4 December 2013}}</ref> Major tournaments include the [[World Cyber Games]], the North American [[Major League Gaming]] league, the France-based [[Electronic Sports World Cup]], and the [[World e-Sports Games]] held in [[Hangzhou, China]].

The average compensation for professional esports players does not compare to those of the top classical sports organizations in the world. According to Julian Krinsky Camps & Programs website, the top Esports player in the world earned around $2.5 million in 2017.<ref name=":0">{{cite web | publisher=Julian Krinsky Camps and Programs | date=5 June 2018 | title=How Much Do Pro Gamers & Esports Players Make? | access-date=29 April 2020 | url=https://info.jkcp.com/blog/professional-gamer-salary-esports/}} {{better source|date=April 2020}}</ref> The highest overall salary by any esports professional at the time was around $3.6 million. While prizes for esports competitions can be very large, the limited number of competitions and large number of competitors ultimately lowers the amount of money one can make in the industry. In the United States, Esports competitions have prizes that can reach $200,000 for a single victory. Dota 2 International hosted a competition where the grand-prize winning team walked home with almost $10.9 million.<ref name=":0" />

For well established games, total prize money can amount to millions of U.S. dollars a year.<ref name="lolprizepool" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.esfiworld.com/news/nasl-s3-finals-push-sc2-earnings-over-5m |title=NASL S3 Finals push SC2 earnings over $5m |first=David | last=Schmidt |date=16 July 2012 |publisher=ESFI World |access-date=22 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212160245/http://archive.esfiworld.com/news/nasl-s3-finals-push-sc2-earnings-over-5m |archive-date=12 December 2013}}</ref> As of 10 September 2016, ''Dota 2'' has awarded approximately US$86 million in prize money within 632 registered tournaments, with 23 players winning over $1 million.

===Collegiate and school leagues===
{{main|College esports in the United States}}

In addition to professional and amateur esports, esports have drawn attention of colleges and high schools since 2008.

Along with the bursting popularity of Esports over the last two decades came a demand for extended opportunities for Esport's athletes. Universities across the world (mostly China and America) began offering scholarship opportunities to incoming freshmen to join their collegiate Esports teams. According to Schaeperkoetter (2017) and others, the potential impact that an eSports program could have on a university, coupled with the growing interest that universities are showing in such a program, combine to make this line of research relevant in sport literature.<ref>Schaeperkoetter, C. C., Mays, J., Hyland, S. T., Wilkerson, Z., Oja, B., Krueger, K., Christian, R., & Bass, J. R. (2017). The "New" Student-Athlete: An Exploratory Examination of Scholarship eSports Players. ''Journal of Intercollegiate Sport'', ''10''(1), 1-21. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1123/jis.2016-0011</nowiki></ref>

As of 2019, over 130 colleges has esports-based variety programs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/21152905/college-esports-list-varsity-esports-programs-north-america|title=List of varsity esports programs spans North America|work=ESPN.com|access-date=31 January 2020|language=en}}</ref>

'''<big>Governing bodies</big>'''

While game publishers or esport broadcasters typically act in oversight roles for specific esports, a number of esport [[sport governing body|governing bodies]] have been established to collectively represent esports on a national, regional or global basis. These governing bodies may have various levels of involvement with the esport, from being part of esports regulation to simply acting more as a [[trade group]] and public face for esports.

The [[International Esports Federation]] (IESF) was one of the first such bodies. Originally formed in 2008 to help promote esports in the southeast Asian region, it has grown to include 56 member countries from across the global. The IESF has managed annual Esport World Championships for teams from its member countries across multiple games.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1076046/seoul-to-host-2019-esports-world-championships | title = Seoul to host 2019 Esports World Championships | first = Mike | last = Rowbottom | date = 28 February 2019 | access-date = 20 December 2019 | work = [[Inside the Games]] }}</ref>

The European Esports Federation was formed in April 2019 and includes UK, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, France, Russia, Slovenia, Serbia, Sweden, Turkey, and Ukraine. This body was designed more to be a managing partner for other esports, working to coordinate event structures and regulations across multiple esports.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://esportsobserver.com/european-esports-federation-formed/ | title = European Esports Federation to Form With 12 National Members | first = Graham | last = Ashton | date= 18 April 2019 | access-date = 20 December 2019 | work = [[The Esports Observer]] }}</ref>

Additionally, trade groups representing video games have also generally acted as governing bodies for esports. Notably, in November 2019, five major national trade organizations - the [[Entertainment Software Association]] in the United States, the [[Entertainment Software Association of Canada]], [[The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment]], [[Interactive Software Federation of Europe]], and the [[Interactive Games and Entertainment Association]] of Australian and New Zealand - issued a joined statement for supporting the promotion and participation of esports to respect player safety and integrity, respect and diversity among players, and enriching game play.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-05-games-industry-international-trade-bodies-unite-on-universal-esports-principles | title = Games industry international trade bodies unite on universal esports principles | first= Rebekah | last = Valentine | date = 5 November 2019 | access-date=  20 December 2019 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref>

==Ethics and legal problems==
{{further|Professional ethics}}

Pro gamers are usually obligated to behave ethically, abiding by both the explicit rules set out by tournaments, associations, and teams, as well as following general expectations of good [[sportsmanship]]. For example, it is common practice and considered good etiquette to chat "gg" (for "good game") when defeated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techhive.com/article/248526/web_jargon_origins_revealed.html |title=Web Jargon Origins Revealed |author=David Daw |publisher=TechHive |date=21 January 2012 |access-date=22 September 2013}}</ref> Many games rely on the fact competitors have limited information about the game state.

There have been serious violations of the rules. In 2010, eleven ''StarCraft: Brood War'' players were found guilty of [[StarCraft professional competition#Match fixing scandal|fixing matches for profit]], and were fined and banned from future competition.

===Performance-enhancing drugs===
Reports of widespread use of [[performance-enhancing drugs]] (PEDs) in esports are not uncommon, with players discussing their own, their teammates' and their competitors' use and officials acknowledging the prevalence of the issue.<ref name="parkin">{{cite web |last1=Parkin |first1=Simon |title=Winners might use drugs |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-08-winners-might-use-drugs |access-date=19 July 2015 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |date=8 April 2015}}</ref><ref name="newscientist">{{cite magazine |last1=Hodson |first1=Hal |title=Esports: Doping is rampant, industry insider claims |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26051-esports-doping-is-rampant-industry-insider-claims#.U-x3KvldU0J |access-date=19 July 2015 |magazine=[[New Scientist]] |date=18 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="summers">{{cite web |last1=Summers |first1=Nick |title=Top 'Counter-Strike' player admits eSports has a doping problem |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/07/17/esports-adderall-doping/ |access-date=19 July 2015 |publisher=[[Engadget]] |date=17 July 2015}}</ref> Players often turn to [[stimulants]] such as [[Ritalin]], [[Adderall]] and [[Vyvanse]], drugs which can significantly boost concentration, improve reaction time and prevent fatigue.<ref name="parkin" /> [[Selegiline]], a drug used to treat [[Parkinson's disease]], is reportedly popular because, like stimulants, it enhances mood and motivation.

The unregulated use of such drugs poses severe risks to competitors' health, including [[addiction]], [[overdose]], [[serotonin syndrome]] and, in the case of stimulants, [[weight loss]].<ref name=parkin /><ref name="newscientist" /> Even over-the-counter [[energy drinks]] which are marketed specifically toward gamers have faced media and regulatory scrutiny due to deaths and hospitalizations.<ref name="fuel">{{cite web |last1=Stout |first1=Hilary |title=Selling the Young on 'Gaming Fuel' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/business/energy-drink-industry-under-scrutiny-looks-to-gamers-to-keep-sales-surging.html |access-date=19 July 2015 |work=The New York Times |date=19 May 2015}}</ref> Accordingly, Adderall and other such stimulants are banned and their use penalized by many professional sporting bodies and leagues, including [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[National Football League]].

They commonly drink caffeinated drinks or use energy pills.


===Player exploitation===
There has been some concern over the quality of life and potential mistreatment of players by organizations, especially in South Korea. Korean organizations have been accused of refusing to pay competitive salaries, leading to a slow exodus of Korean players to other markets. In an interview, ''League of Legends'' player Bae "Dade" Eo-jin said that "Korean players wake up at 1 pm and play until 5 am", and suggested that the 16-hour play schedule was a significant factor in causing [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://na.lolesports.com/articles/koreas-pro-exodus-may-spell-bad-news-games-top-region |title=KOREA'S PRO EXODUS MAY SPELL BAD NEWS FOR THE GAME'S TOP REGION |publisher=Riot Games |author=Frank 'Riot Mirhi' Fields |date=5 November 2014 |access-date=9 November 2014}}</ref> Concerns over the [[mental health]] of players intensified in 2014 when ''League of Legends'' player Cheon "Promise" Min-Ki attempted suicide a week after admitting to [[match fixing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/3/18/5522192/korean-league-of-legends-player-fixed-matches-suicide |title=Top Korean League of Legends player fixed matches before attempting suicide, says eSports league |website=Polygon |author=Owen S.

Players must handle their own treatments and carry their own medical insurance, which is the opposite of the norm with professional sports teams. Since most esports play requires many actions per minute, some players may get [[repetitive strain]] injuries, causing hand or wrist pain.<ref>Luke Winkie (31 May 2016) [http://www.vocativ.com/323427/the-esports-injury-crisis/ The eSports Injury Crisis] Vocativ, Retrieved 3 June 2016.</ref>

All-female esports teams include [[Frag Dolls]] and [[PMS Clan]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Gambling===
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}

Gambling and betting on esport matches have generally been illegal in major markets. The illegality of esport gambling has created a [[black market]] and virtual currency. And since it is not regulated, this may encourage match-fixing by players themselves, and lead to issues with underage gambling due to the draw of video games. A bright example can be represented by [[skin gambling]], where virtual items earned in games are used as a currency, and it let users bet on the outcome of matches.<ref name="wapost betting"/>

Esports gambling in the United States has been illegal under the federal [[Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992]] (PASPA) until May 2018. The Act prevented all but five states from allowing gambling on sporting events.<ref name="wapost betting"/> However, regulation of esports betting still depended on state law. Some betting houses in Nevada, where sports betting has been already exempted under PASPA, classify esports as non-competitive "other events" similar to the selection of the [[Heisman Trophy]] winner or [[NFL Draft]] which are considered as legal.<ref name="wapost betting">{{cite web | title = Esports bookmaking?

With the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]'s ruling in ''[[Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'' in May 2018, PASPA was recognized as unconstitutional, as the Court claimed that the federal government cannot limit states from regulating [[sports betting]]. This created the potential for legalized esports-based betting in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/esports-betting | title = Esports betting may soon become legal in several American states | first = Ali | last= Jones | date = 17 May 2018 | access-date=8 June 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] }}</ref> However, New Jersey, the state at the center of the Supreme Court case, passed its bill to legalize sports gambling but restricted gambling on esports to only international competitions where most players are over 18 years of age.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://compete.kotaku.com/new-jersey-added-a-last-minute-esports-betting-ban-and-1826678155 | title = New Jersey Added A Last-Minute Esports Betting Ban And No One Knows Why | first = Maddy | last= Myers | date = 8 June 2018 | access-date = 8 June 2018 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}</ref> Without PASPA, interstate gambling on esports would be still be limited by the [[Federal Wire Act]], preventing users from betting on national esports events outside of the state.<ref name="wapost betting"/>

In 2019, the countries where esports gambling is legal include the UK, New Zealand, Australia, China, Spain, Canada, South Korea, and Japan, and many of them are the international hosts for gaming tournaments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamopo.com/countries/|title=Esports Betting Laws & Country Restrictions 2019 {{!}} Gamopo Esports Hub|website=Gamopo.com|language=en-US|access-date=5 September 2019}}</ref> Also by the end of 2019, the state of [[New Jersey]] approved esports betting, just in time for the finals of the LoL Worlds Cup 2019 final match, which had over 4.000.000 spectators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esports.net/news/industry/new-jersey-allows-esports-betting-in-time-for-league-of-legends-final/|title=New Jersey Allows Esports Betting in Time for League of Legends Final|date=12 November 2019|website=Esports.net|language=en-US|access-date=31 January 2020}}</ref>

==== The incentives of the industry ====
Just as it happens with traditional sports, [[Bookmaker|bookmarkers]] and gambling companies do their best to attract as many gamblers as possible. Yet, one of the biggest issues with the esports [[gambling industry]] has been its target audience. Thus, as an important part of the esports audience is underage most governments have been a bit skeptical regarding this market's moral view. Nevertheless, a huge synergy has been shown between the esports and gambling industries as online betting houses have been able to aim to younger audiences and experiment with new forms of gambling adapted to each game title and/or tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esportsbets.com/news/esports-the-convergence-of-gaming-and-gambling/|title=Esports: The Convergence of Gaming and Gambling|date=18 November 2019|website=EsportsBets.com|language=en-US|access-date=31 January 2020}}</ref> Furthermore, these industries have got so close that there are even betting houses sponsoring professional esports teams, as happened with the contract between [[Betway]] and [[PSG.LGD]] team ([[Dota 2]]) in August 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/instant-sponsor/betway-partners-with-psg-lgd-and-gains-control-over-team-branding-a447c8abb301|title=Betway Partners With PSG.LGD And Gains Control Over Team Branding|last=Kuchefski|first=Kathryn|date=14 August 2019|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=31 January 2020}}</ref>

==== Types of esports Gambling ====
As far as esports gambling goes, most of the bets move within the same nature as they do with traditional sports. Therefore, most gambling sites offering the booker service allow users to bet based on the outcome of tournaments, matches or special esports titles. On the other hand, due to the nature of esports, there are plenty of innovative ways to bet, which are based on in-game milestones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/03/betting-is-esports-biggest-and-most-underappreciated-opportunity/|title=Betting is esports' biggest and most underappreciated opportunity|date=3 June 2019|website=VentureBeat|language=en-US|access-date=31 January 2020}}</ref> For example, [[League of Legends|League of Legend]] bettors may place their money on which team/champion will take the "First Blood".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lolbettingsites.com/lol-esports-bets/|title=LoL esports bets explained ➠ Best esports advice|website=LoLBettingSites.com|language=en-US|access-date=31 January 2020}}</ref> On the other hand, [[First-person shooter]]s like [[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]] is also open to "First Map" bets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://skrilla.com/en-eu/guides/csgo-esports-betting-skrillas-guide/|title=CS:GO Betting And Prediction Guide|website=skrilla.com|language=en-eu|access-date=31 January 2020}}</ref> Besides, some bookers allow "odds & even" bets which allow players to take chances on whether the final count of a game, mostly in kills, will be an odd or even number. Furthermore, there are different types of betting in esports based on the means of the bet. While an important part of this market is guided by bookers, some games allow bets in their [[in-game currency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/dota-2-now-lets-you-bet-in-game-currency-on-pro-tournam-1833502199|title=Dota 2 Now Lets You Bet In-Game Currency On Pro Tournaments|website=Kotaku|language=en-us|access-date=31 January 2020}}</ref> On the other hand, players may stablish to do in-game or offline transactions to cover personal bets on the matches they participate in.

===Data analytics and machine learning===
With the growing popularity of [[machine learning]] in data analytics,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} esports has been the focus of several software programs that analyze the plethora of game data available. Based on the huge number of matches played on a daily basis globally ([[League of Legends]] alone had a reported 100 million active monthly players worldwide in 2016<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.riftherald.com/2016/9/13/12865314/monthly-lol-players-2016-active-worldwide | title = Number of players of selected eSports games worldwide as of August 2017 (in million) | date = 13 September 2016 | access-date=12 August 2018 | work = [[Rift Herald]] }}</ref> and an average of 27 million League of Legends games played per day reported in 2014<ref>Sheer, Ian (27 January 2014). "Player Tally for 'League of Legends' Surges". Wsj.com. Archived from the original on 30 January 2014. Retrieved 31 January 2014.</ref>), these games can be used for applying big-data machine learning platforms. Several games make their data publicly available, so websites aggregate the data into easy-to-visualize graphs and statistics. In addition, several programs use machine learning tools to predict the win probability of a match based on various factors, such as team composition.<ref>{{cite arXiv | title = Win Prediction in Esports: Mixed-Rank Match Prediction in Multi-player Online Battle Arena Games | date = 17 November 2017 |eprint = 1711.06498|last1 = Hodge|first1 = Victoria|last2 = Devlin|first2 = Sam|last3 = Sephton|first3 = Nick|last4 = Block|first4 = Florian|last5 = Drachen|first5 = Anders|last6 = Cowling|first6 = Peter|class = cs.AI}}</ref> In 2018, the [[DotA]] team [[Team Liquid]] partnered with a software company to allow players and coaches to predict the team's success rate in each match and provide advice on what needs to be changed to improve performance.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/05/10/18/dota-analytics-big-data-meets-e-sports-in-software-giant-deal-with-team-liquid | title = 'DOTA analytics': Big data meets e-sports in software giant deal with Team Liquid | date = 10 May 2018 | access-date=12 August 2018 | work = [[ABC-CBN News]] }}</ref>

===Game cancellations===
As more esport competitions and leagues are run entirely or in portion by the video game publisher or developer for the game, the ongoing viability of that game's esport activities is tied to that company. In December 2018, Blizzard announced that it was reducing resources spent on the development of ''Heroes of the Storm'' and canceling its plans for tournaments in 2019. This caused several professional ''Heroes'' players and coaches recognizing their career was no longer viable, and expressed outrage and disappointment at Blizzard's decision.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/14/blizzard-ends-heroes-of-the-storm-esports/| title=  Blizzard cancels 'Heroes of the Storm' eSports plans | first =Saqid | last = Shah | date = 14 December 2018 | access-date = 16 December 2018 | work = [[Engadget]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/14/18141331/heroes-of-the-storm-canceled-hgc-blizzard-community | title = Heroes of the Storm pros vent sadness, anger after Blizzard kills game's esports future | first = Michael | last= McWhertor | date = 14 December 2018 | access-date = 16 December 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>

==Media coverage==

===News reporting===
The main medium for esports coverage is the [[Internet]]. In the mid-2010s, mainstream sports and news reporting websites, such as ''[[ESPN]]'', ''[[Yahoo!]]'', ''[[Sport1 (Germany)|Sport1]]'', ''[[Kicker (magazine)|Kicker]]'', and ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' started dedicated esports coverage.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dave |first1=Paresh |title=ESPN.com to cover e-sports with same 'rigor' as it does the big leagues |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-espn-esports-20160113-story.html |website=LA Times |access-date=13 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Yahoo Launches New Experience Dedicated to Esports |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-launches-experience-dedicated-esports-050000022.html |website=Yahoo |access-date=13 July 2016}}</ref> esports tournaments commonly use commentators or casters to provide live commentary of games in progress, similar to a traditional [[sports commentator]].

In 2018, the [[Associated Press]]' [[AP Stylebook]] officially began spelling the word as "esports", dropping support for both the capital "S" and the dash between "e" and "sports" styles, similar to how "[[e-mail]]" transformed with common usage to "email".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dotesports.com/culture/ap-style-esports-13789 |title=Goodbye eSports: The 2017 AP Style Guide will settle the esports spelling debate once and for all |publisher=Dot Esports |author=Justin Binkowski |date=25 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://esports.yahoo.com/its-official-the-ap-style-guide-spells-it-esports-not-esports-e-sports-or-esports-233434245.html |title=It's official: The AP Style guide spells it 'esports', not 'eSports', 'e-sports', or 'Esports' |publisher=Yahoo Esports |author=Taylor Cocke |date=24 March 2017}}</ref> Richard Tyler Blevins, better known as "[[Ninja (streamer)|Ninja]]", became the first professional gamer to appear in a cover story for a major sports magazine when he appeared in the September 2018 issue of ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2018/09/18/ninja-espn-magazine-cover/ | title = Fortnite streamer Ninja graces cover of latest ESPN magazine – a first for professional gaming | first = Stephany | last = Nunnelley | date = 18 September 2018 | access-date = 18 September 2018 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref>

===Internet live streaming===
Many esports events are [[streamed]] online to viewers over the internet. With the shutdown of the Own3d streaming service in 2013, [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] is by far the most popular streaming service for esports, competing against other providers such as Hitbox.tv, Azubu, and [[YouTube Gaming]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redbull.com/en/games/stories/1331687386855/hitbox-vs-twitch-which-is-better |title=How Hitbox plans to take on Twitch |author=Jon Partridge |publisher=RedBull |date=29 October 2014 |access-date=29 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamingsoul.com/pcmac/own3d-is-shutting-down-twitch-tv-declared-winner/ |title=Own3D is Shutting Down.

Individual broadcasters can enter an agreement with Twitch or Hitbox in which they receive a portion of the advertisement revenue from commercials which run on the stream they create.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/02/05/talking-livestreams-esports-and-the-future-of-entertainment-with-twitch-tv/ |title=Talking Livestreams, eSports and the Future of Entertainment with Twitch |author=Paul Tassi |magazine=Forbes |date=2 May 2013 |access-date=16 September 2013}}</ref>

Another major streaming platform was [[Major League Gaming]]'s MLG.tv.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.majorleaguegaming.com/ |title=MLG Streaming Platform |publisher=Major League Gaming |access-date=28 July 2014}}</ref> The network, which specializes in ''[[Call of Duty]]'' content but hosts a range of gaming titles, has seen increasing popularity, with 1376% growth in MLG.tv viewership in Q1 of 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/news/nadeshot-joins-mlg-tv-streaming-platform-apps-for-android-and-ios-released |title=1376% Growth in MLG.tv Viewership in Q1 |publisher=Major League Gaming |date=10 April 2014 |access-date=28 June 2013}}</ref> The 2014 ''[[Call of Duty: Ghosts]]'' broadcast at [[Major League Gaming|MLG]]'s X Games event drew over 160,000 unique viewers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esportsmax.com/events/mlg-championship-2014-anaheim-ca |title=MLG Championship 2014 – Anaheim, CA |publisher=Esports Maxl |date=22 June 2014 |access-date=28 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627135654/http://www.esportsmax.com/events/mlg-championship-2014-anaheim-ca |archive-date=27 June 2014 }}</ref> The network, like Twitch, allows users to broadcast themselves playing games, though only select individuals can use the service. For several years, MLG.tv was the primary streaming platform for the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' professional scene; famous players such as [[NaDeSHoT]] and [[Scump]] have signed contracts with the company to use its streaming service exclusively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/news/nadeshot-joins-mlg-tv-streaming-platform-apps-for-android-and-ios-released |title=Video Game Super Star "Nadeshot" Signs Exclusive Deal with Major League Gaming |publisher=Major League Gaming |date=10 April 2014 |access-date=28 June 2013}}</ref> In January 2016, MLG was acquired by [[Activision Blizzard]].<ref name="nyt-mlgbuy" />

===Television===
[[File:Televised Star Craft.jpg|thumb|left|''[[StarCraft]]'' match televised on [[MBCGame]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea]]

Especially since the popularization of streaming in esports, organizations no longer prioritize television coverage, preferring online streaming websites such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]]. [[Ongamenet]] continues to broadcast as an esports channel in South Korea, but [[MBCGame]] was taken off the air in 2012. Riot Games' Dustin Beck stated that "TV's not a priority or a goal",<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danieltack/2013/09/04/riot-games-league-of-legends-and-the-future-of-esports/ |title=Riot Games, 'League of Legends', And The Future Of eSports |magazine=Forbes |author=Daniel Tack |date=4 September 2013 |access-date=8 October 2013}}</ref> and DreamHack's Tomas Hermansson said "esports have [been proven] to be successful on internet streaming [services]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gosugamers.net/starcraft2/news/25446-dreamhack-partners-with-mtg-for-esports-studio-in-stockholm |title=DreamHack partners with MTG for eSports studio in Stockholm |publisher=Gosu Gamers |author=Radoslav "Nydra" Kolev |date=25 September 2013 |access-date=12 November 2013}}</ref>

This was the first time an eSport had ever been broadcast on a major American television network. The broadcast was an attempt to broaden the appeal of esports by reaching viewers who would not normally come across it. However, the broadcast was met with a few complaints. Those living outside of the United States were unable to view the tournament.  Additionally, the tournament could not be viewed online via streams, cutting off a large portion of viewers from the main demographic in the process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/heroes-of-the-dorm-finals-were-a-success-story-for-esports/ |title=Heroes of the Dorm finals were a success story for esports |website=[[PCGamer]] |first=Tom |last=Marks |date=27 April 2015 |access-date=4 May 2015}}</ref>

He felt that higher quality productions, more in line with those of traditional sports telecasts, could help to broaden the appeal of esports to advertisers. Activision Blizzard had hired former ESPN and [[NFL Network]] executive [[Steve Bornstein]] to be CEO of the company's esports division.<ref name="nyt-mlgbuy">{{cite web |title=Activision Buys Major League Gaming to Broaden Role in E-Sports |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/05/technology/activision-buys-major-league-gaming-to-broaden-role-in-e-sports.html?smid=tw-share&_r=1 |website=The New York Times |access-date=5 January 2016}}</ref>
