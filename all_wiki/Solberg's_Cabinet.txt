The '''Solberg Cabinet''' is the incumbent [[List of Norwegian governments|government]] of the [[Norway|Kingdom of Norway]], headed by [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Erna Solberg]] as [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]]. The government was appointed by [[Harald V of Norway|King Harald V]] on 16 October 2013 following the [[2013 Norwegian parliamentary election|parliamentary election on 9 September]], consisting of the Conservative Party and the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] as a [[minority government]]. On 16 December 2015, the cabinet was re-shuffled. The government secured renewed support following the [[2017 Norwegian parliamentary election|2017 parliamentary election]]. It was expanded on 14 January 2018, when an agreement was reached to include the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Norway's Liberals to join Conservative-led government |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-government/norways-liberals-to-join-conservative-led-government-idUSKBN1F30Q4 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=14 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Solberg Solidifies Grip on Norway as Liberals Join Government |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-14/solberg-solidifies-grip-on-norway-as-liberals-join-government |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=14 January 2018}}</ref> and further expanded on 22 January 2019 when the [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democratic Party]] joined the coalition. On 20 January 2020, the Progress Party announced that it would withdraw from the government, citing the decision to bring home the family of a sick child from Syria, which included the child's mother, a norwegian citizen who had volunteered for the Islamic State.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fremskrittspartiet trekker seg fra regjeringen |url=https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/politikk/i/naJ90a/frp-gaar-ut-av-regjeringen-foelg-regjeringens-skjebnedag-direkte-her |work=Aftenposten |date=20 January 2020}}</ref>

''2013-09-30'' [[Aftenposten]] ]</ref> The Liberal Party entered the government in January 2018, and so did the Christian Democratic Party in January 2019. The Progress Party left the coalition, the first Government in which it had participated, in January 2020.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-20/norway-pm-loses-majority-coalition-after-populist-partner-quits Norway PM Loses Majority After Populist Partner Quits. ''2020-01-20'' [[Bloomberg News]]]</ref> From January 2018 to January 2020 the coalition held a majority in the Parliament. The government is the first in Norway since 1986 in which centre-right parties have participated in a major coalition.

== Name ==
By convention, a Norwegian government is usually named after the Prime Minister, in casu the ''Solberg Cabinet''. The Government, however, has officially referred to itself (until the Liberal Party's entering) as the ''Høyre Frp Cabinet''. Informally, it is called the ''Blue Cabinet'' and even the ''Blue Blue Cabinet'', referring to Høyre's light blue and the Progress Party's dark blue party colour, respectively.

== Members ==
On 16 October 2013, [[Erna Solberg]]'s [[cabinet minister]]s were formally appointed by King [[Harald V of Norway|Harald V]].<ref>[http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/smk/aktuelt/offstatsraad/2013/offisielt-fra-statsradet-16-oktober-2013.html?id=742876 Official news release from the Cabinet] 16 October 2013. Retrieved 17 October 2013.</ref>

The Cabinet had 18 ministers; two fewer than the previous Stoltenberg cabinet.
