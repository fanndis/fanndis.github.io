The '''six-party talks''' aimed to find a peaceful resolution to the security concerns as a result of the [[North Korean nuclear weapons program]].
There was a series of meetings with six participating states in [[Beijing]]:<ref>{{cite news|title=The Six-party Talks Kicked off|url=http://www.china-un.org/eng/zt/ch/t25488.htm|publisher=[[Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations]]|date=2003-08-27|accessdate=2017-05-24}}</ref>

These talks were a result of North Korea withdrawing from the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) in 2003. Apparent gains following the fourth and fifth rounds were reversed by outside events.

[[File:Six-party talks.PNG|thumb|right|500px|Members of the six-party nuclear talks]]

The main points of contention were:
* '''Security guarantee''' – this issue has been raised by North Korea since the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] (2001–2009) took office. North Korea labeled the Bush administration as hostile and accused it of planning to overthrow the North Korean government by force. This concern was elevated when [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] named North Korea as part of an "[[axis of evil]]" in his 2002 [[State of the Union Address]].
* '''The construction of [[light water reactor]]s''' – under the 1994 [[U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework|Agreed Framework]] two [[light-water reactor]]s would be built in return for the closure of North Korea's graphite-moderated [[nuclear power plant]] program at [[Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center|Yongbyon]]. This agreement broke down after both sides defaulted, especially since 2002.
* '''Peaceful use of nuclear energy''' – whilst the NPT allows states the right to use nuclear energy for civilian purposes, this was thought to have been used by North Korea as a cover for their nuclear weapons program.
* '''Diplomatic relations''' – North Korea wanted normalization of diplomatic relations as part of the bargain for giving up its nuclear weapons program. The U.S. has at times disagreed and at times agreed to this condition, providing North Korea irreversibly and verifiably disarms its nuclear weapons program.
* '''Financial restrictions / Trade normalization''' – The U.S. placed heavy financial sanctions on North Korea for what they see as an uncooperative attitude and unwillingness to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. In addition, other parties such as China took actions such as the freezing of North Korean assets in foreign bank accounts, such as the US$24 million<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/world/20070129TDY01003.htm |title=The Japan News - Breaking News from Japan by The Yomiuri Shimbun |publisher=Yomiuri.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/SITE/data/html_dir/2007/01/29/200701290004.asp |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120803063018/http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/SITE/data/html_dir/2007/01/29/200701290004.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-08-03 |title=The Nation's No.1 English Newspaper |work=The Korea Herald |date=2010-04-04 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref> in Macau's Banco Delta Asia. With the nuclear test on October 9, 2006, UNSCR 1718 was passed, which included a ban on all luxury goods to North Korea. These funds were unfrozen by the US on March 19, 2007 to reciprocate actions by their North Korean counterparts.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.archives.go.kr/next/search/listSubjectDescription.do?id=010094|title=6자회담|last=|first=|date=2015-11-26|website=국가기록원|language=Korean|trans-title=Six party talk|access-date=2018-05-16}}</ref> The United States removed North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism in October 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. Declares North Korea Off Terror List|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/world/asia/13terror.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 12, 2008|first=Helene|last=Cooper}}</ref> 
* '''Verifiable and Irreversible disarmament''' – Members of the six-party talks disagreed on this. Japan and the U.S. demanded that North Korea completely dismantle its nuclear program so that it may never be restarted, and that it can be verified by the six members of the talks before aid is given. South Korea, China and Russia agreed on a milder, step-by-step solution which involves the members of the six-party talks giving a certain reward (e.g. aid) in return for each step of [[nuclear disarmament]]. North Korea wanted the U.S. to concede some of the conditions first before it will take any action in disarming their weapons program, which they see as the only guarantee to prevent a U.S. attack on their soil.

=== Events between phases 1 and 2 ===
* In April 2006, North Korea offered to resume talks if the U.S. releases recently frozen North Korean financial assets held in a bank in [[Macau]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4905308.stm |title=Asia-Pacific &#124; N Korea offers nuclear talks deal |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-04-13 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref>
** The U.S. treats the nuclear and financial issues as separate; North Korea does not.
* North Korea then announced on October 3, 2006, that it was going to test its first nuclear weapon regardless of the world situation, blaming 'hostile U.S. policy' as the reason for the need for such a deterrent. However, it pledged a no-first-strike policy and to nuclear disarmament only when there is worldwide elimination of such nuclear weapons<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-10/03/content_5167518.htm |title=Xinhua - English |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2006-10-03 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/5402292.stm |title=Asia-Pacific &#124; N Korea statement on nuclear test |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-10-03 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref>
* On October 9, 2006, North Korea announced a [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|successful nuclear test]], verified by the U.S. on October 11.
* In response, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718|Resolution 1718]]<ref name="UN_SPV5551_2006">{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5551 |date=14 October 2006 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=5551 |accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref> unanimously condemning North Korea, as well as passing Chapter VII, Article 41. Sanctions ranged from the economic to the trade of military units, [[Weapons of Mass Destruction|WMD]]-related parts and technology transfer, and a ban on certain luxury goods. Both the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Russian Federation]] were quick to stress that these were not military-enforceable sanctions. The Resolution also gave the right to other nations to inspect any North Korean vessel's cargo, although the [[People's Republic of China]] has held reservations about this move, saying it wanted to avoid any military confrontation with North Korea's navy.
* On 31 October 2006, the Chinese government announced that six-party talks would resume. U.S. negotiator [[Christopher R. Hill|Christopher Hill]] later stated that the resumption could happen in the next month and that North Korea had not set preconditions for the talks. The deadlock was broken by what ''[[BBC News]]'' called "frantic behind-the-scenes negotiations" by Beijing. However, Japan's Foreign Minister [[Taro Aso]] stated that his country was not willing to return to the six-party talks until North Korea had renounced nuclear weapons.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6102092.stm "North Korea talks 'set to resume'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718190405/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6102092.stm |date=July 18, 2016 }}, ''[[BBC News]]'', 31 October 2006</ref>
* On 5 December 2006, the Russian envoy and former chief Russian negotiator for the six-party talks Alexander Alexeyev said that the talks were unlikely to resume before 2007 owing to the slow progress towards the talks and the fact that Christmas was coming up soon.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121104140432/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/05/AR2006120500866.html N.

'''Events during the 5th round, 3rd phase of talks'''
* China drew up a plan that was presented on Friday, 9 February 2007, building on the September 2005 agreement. It proposes that the Yongbyon 5MW(e) nuclear reactor be "suspended, shut down and sealed" within two months in exchange for energy supplies and economic aid by the other five countries to North Korea. It also proposed to establish "four to six" working groups on each of the outstanding issues not agreed on. Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Aso was reported to applaud the draft, hailing it as a breakthrough. However, Japanese chief representative Sasae Kenichiro and U.S. chief representative Christopher Hill were much more cautious, saying it was just a first step in a long process, but at least there was agreement by all parties on the fundamental points. North Korean chief representative Kim Kye-gwan said North Korea was "prepared to discuss initial denuclearization steps" but was "neither optimistic nor pessimistic because there are still a lot of problems to be resolved"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=2862187 |title=ABC News: ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2013-01-19 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21201335-31477,00.html | title=Capital Circle}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-02/09/content_5718339.htm |title=Xinhua - English |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2007-02-09 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref>
* China held one-on-one talks with each of the other five countries on Sunday 11 February 2007. The six countries' chief negotiators then had an hour-long meeting together in the afternoon. They did not announce any end date for this phase of talks after the meeting.<ref name=autogenerated5 />
* China's plan has run into some difficulties regarding the steps North Korea will take to denuclearize in exchange for aid. The Japanese chief representative claimed North Korea was demanding too much compensation in return for denuclearization. South Korea's chief representative Chun Yung-woo said it was "unreasonable" to expect a breakthrough on Sunday 11 February 2007. Russia's chief representative Losyukov said that the chances of reaching a two-page joint statement are slim, and if this does not work out, a Chairman's Statement will be issued.<ref name=autogenerated5 />
* On February 13, 2007, Christopher Hill announced that a tentative deal had been reached between the negotiators, and a "final text" was being circulated to the governments of the six parties for approval. Even before the deal had been approved, it was criticized by [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]], former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who said that it sent "exactly the wrong signal to would-be proliferators around the world".<ref>{{cite news |title='Deal reached' at N Korea talks |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6355681.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=BBC |date=2007-02-13 |accessdate=2007-02-13 }}</ref>
* The Chairman's Statement adopted on February 13, 2007 was the result of 16 hours of grueling negotiations, finalized only at 2 a.m. on February 13, 2007. This was circulated to all six parties, and agreed on at around 3 p.m. that same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-02/13/content_808419.htm |title=Nuclear talks appear to secure breakthrough |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref>

'''Objectives achieved'''
* On March 19, 2007, the US Chief Negotiator Christopher Hill announced that all of the $25 million in funds belonging to the North Koreans in Banco Delta Asia that were frozen before were being unfrozen to reciprocate the positive steps the North Koreans have taken towards freezing their Yongbyon nuclear reactor and readmitting IAEA inspectors, with a future goal towards total nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.<ref name=":0" /> However, this issue was only put on the agenda on the morning of the talks instead of before hand, so the financial transaction ran into some problems in terms of time and being cleared (by the Bank of China) for the North Koreans. The North Koreans, led by Kim Kye-gwan, refused to negotiate further until they received their money. The Americans (Christopher Hill, not Daniel Glaser) denied responsibility for the delay, citing it as a "Chinese matter". The Chinese (Wu Dawei) in turn said "there wasn't enough time to accomplish the transaction". The Bank of China has been hesitant to accept the money as Banco Delta Asia has not been removed from the US' blacklist despite having the funds in question unfrozen. Nevertheless, none of the five other parties see this financial issue as posing any obstruction to the talks. "The resolution of the BDA issue is a question of time, not a question of political will,", Chun Yung-woo, the South Korean Chief Negotiator, said. The talks have been put on recess at the end of the fourth day of talks after progress was not possible after the second day.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&sid=aVWf.4rVYsDQ&refer=japan | work=Bloomberg | title=North Korea Nuclear Talks Recess Amid Transfer Snafu (Update3) | date=22 March 2007}}</ref>
* The US has also admitted that this freezing of funds was a bargaining chip used to pressure North Korea to dismantle.
* The talks were abandoned as North Korea refused to proceed without receiving the $25 million in their hands.
* A South Korean newspaper reported that North Korea had taken steps to shut their Yongbyon 5MW(e) reactor though.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaku |first=Michio |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/17/news/korea.php |title=Images of North Korean reactor hint at progress of talks |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=2012-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref>

'''Events taking place between halt and resumption of 1st phase of the 6th round of talks'''
* The 60-day deadline was obviously not met because of the above, though none of the six parties made much of a hassle about it. The US has urged North Korea to meet its commitments as soon as possible, citing this matter was no longer a US one. Russia, China and South Korea have urged patience. Japan is still pressing for the abduction issue to be resolved. It keeps conditioning its provision of economic incentives to North Korea on the full resolution of the abduction issue.<ref>Hagström, Linus (2009) "Normalizing Japan: Supporter, Nuisance, or Wielder of Power in the North Korean Nuclear Talks," Asian Survey 49 (5): 831–51, {{cite document|title=Archived copy |doi=10.1525/as.2009.49.5.831 }}</ref>

* A deadline was not decided on during the talks until the working groups have a chance to meet. This is likely because the deadlines set in talks earlier in the year were not met.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/7/20/worldupdates/2007-07-20T144737Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-285706-3&sec=Worldupdates |title=North Korea talks end but wrangling to continue |publisher=Thestar.com.my |accessdate=2014-01-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004153922/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F7%2F20%2Fworldupdates%2F2007-07-20T144737Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-285706-3&sec=Worldupdates |archivedate=2012-10-04 }}</ref>

There have been numerous US-DPRK bilateral meetings held in Beijing and Geneva since the end of this phase of this round of talks.

On April 5, 2009, North Korea proceeded with its announced [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2|satellite launch]], despite international pressure not to do so.
