In [[radio]] [[broadcasting]], '''airplay''' is how frequently a [[song]] is being played on [[radio station]]s. A song which is being played several times every day ([[Spin (radio)|spins]]) would have a significant amount of airplay.<ref name="au1">{{cite news |publisher=news.com.au |title=Aussie acts buck airplay snub |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/aussie-acts-buck-airplay-snub/story-e6frfn09-1111116119096 |date=April 21, 2008 |access-date=February 26, 2010}}</ref><ref name="eugene">{{cite news |first=Jay |last=Sharbutt |work=Eugene Register-Guard |agency=Associated Press |title=Sunday's Billboard music awards: Records sales, airplay the key |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GMcTAAAAIBAJ&pg=5872,3370386&dq=airplay&hl=en |date=December 10, 1977 |page=TV9 |access-date=February 26, 2010}}</ref> Music which became very popular on [[jukebox]]es, in [[nightclub]]s and at [[discotheque]]s between the 1940s and 1960s would also have airplay.

A song which was successful in the airplay charts but weak in sales was commonly known as a "[[record player|turntable]] [[hit song|hit]]" when radio stations played only [[vinyl record|vinyl]] [[single (music)|singles]].<ref name="miljo1">{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Posniak |work=The Milwaukee Journal |title=Badger Beat: Wisconsin Bands and Combos |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rd8jAAAAIBAJ&pg=2280,1075755&dq=turntable-hit&hl=en |date=October 2, 1968 |access-date=February 26, 2010 |quote=Consequently, what we ended up with was a turntable hit (so called because it received lots of play on disk jockeys' record turntables).}}</ref>
