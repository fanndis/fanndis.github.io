'''Auckland City Hospital''' is a [[public hospital]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. It is one of the largest hospitals in the country,<ref name="Medical">''[http://www.news-medical.net/?id=2897 Largest hospital in New Zealand...]'' - News-Medical.Net, Tuesday 29 June 2004</ref> as well as one of the oldest medical facilities of the country. It is a publicly funded hospital, run by the [[Auckland District Health Board]] since 2001. Located in the suburb of [[Grafton, New Zealand|Grafton]], east of the CBD, it has 3,500 rooms and provides a total of 1124 beds [https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/certified-providers/public-hospital/auckland-city-hospital]''.

==Importance==
The emergency department alone sees about 47,000 patients annually (over 55,000 as of 2008),<ref name="HER08">''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/location/story.cfm?l_id=117&objectid=10528642 Gridlock on the hospital frontline]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Sunday 24 August 2008</ref> of which 44% are treated as in-patients. Colocated with its emergency department is the children's emergency department, which sees another 30,000 patients annually, making the campus one of the busiest in [[Australasia]].<ref>[http://www.akhdem.co.nz/ Department of Emergency Medicine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712165837/http://www.akhdem.co.nz/ |date=July 12, 2007 }} (from the official department website. Retrieved 2008-08-22.)</ref>

The hospital is a research and teaching facility as well, providing training for future doctors, nurses, midwives and other health professionals. Rare or complex medical conditions from all over New Zealand may get referred here. The hospital is closely associated with [[Starship Children's Health]], a separate subsidiary facility on the same grounds, located just to the northwest of the City Hospital.

To secure the best quality possible around the clock, in 2005 there was commissioned a 3,600&nbsp;kW (3.6 MW) emergency power generation system. This amount for 710 beds is a high one and the hospital can continue all work going on with that much capacity.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==History==
===Previous buildings===
[[File:Auckland Hospital Italianate Style.jpg|thumb|Auckland Hospital, 1910]]
Originally, a timber hospital occupied the Auckland City Hospital site from 1846 to 1877, providing four wards of 10 beds each, and having been designed by [[Frederick Thatcher]], the architect of the [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland#St Mary.27s Church|St Mary's Church]] in [[Parnell, New Zealand|Parnell]]. The hospital treated both Europeans and [[Māori people|Māori]], though the diseases were different, with the Pakeha treated mostly for the effects of alcohol abuse, while the Māori came for [[tuberculosis]] and [[rheuma]] treatment.<ref name="GRAFT"/> [[Thomas Moore Philson]] was superintendent of the hospital from 1859 to 1883.<ref name="DNZB Philson">{{DNZB|last=Erlam|first=H. D.|id=2p16|title=Thomas Moore Philson|accessdate=23 April 2017}}</ref>

In 1877, a new building in an [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]] was constructed for £25,000, designed by Philip Herepath, architect to the provincial government. Administered by T M Philson, the new hospital became known for taking on many charity cases but, partly in response, was also continually understaffed and overcrowded. There were also complaints about the limited training of the staff, which changed only with the hiring of a new matron, Miss Crisp, in 1883. Having trained in the new tradition of [[Florence Nightingale]], she is credited with turning the hospital from an 'old men with alcoholism institution' into a real hospital and instituting real nurse training.<ref name="GRAFT"/>

===Current buildings===
[[File:Auckland City Hospital 02.jpg|thumb|The older part of Auckland City Hospital, now the support building, as seen from the [[Auckland Domain]]. Visible in front is the smokestack of the complex's central heating.]]
The Herepath building was demolished in 1964 to make way for a new structure designed by architects [[Stephenson and Turner|Stephenson & Turner]], which was completed in 1967, and still remains.<ref name="GRAFT">[http://www.grafton.org.nz/grafton-residents-association-auckland-new-zealand/our-community/past/historical-articles/the-history-of-auckland-hospital/ Auckland Hospital] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122111110/http://www.grafton.org.nz/grafton-residents-association-auckland-new-zealand/our-community/past/historical-articles/the-history-of-auckland-hospital/ |date=2016-01-22 }} (from the Grafton Residents Association website)</ref>

During the health reforms of the New Zealand health system in the early 1990s, Auckland Hospital was run as a business - in the model of [[State-Owned Enterprises of New Zealand|state-owned enterprises of New Zealand]], i.e. with the instruction to return a profit. In accordance with this policy, Auckland Hospital was officially known as ''Auckland Crown Health Enterprise''.

The current hospital facility, opened in 2003, is an amalgam of four previously separate hospitals: Auckland Hospital (acute adult care), Starship (acute children's care), Green Lane Hospital (cardio-thoracic care) and National Women's Hospital (maternity, newborn and [[obstetrics and gynecology]]).<ref name="Medical"/>

The hospital is situated in a NZ$180 million building which was built between 2000 and 2003.<ref name="Fletcher">[http://www.fletcherconstruction.co.nz/project/96 Auckland City Hospital] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214121043/http://www.fletcherconstruction.co.nz/project/96 |date=December 14, 2006 }} (from the project database of [[Fletcher Construction]])</ref> It is nine levels high (ten including plant), five levels less than the older part of the hospital, which has now become the support building. The new structure with 75,575 m<sup>2</sup> <ref name="Fletcher"/> is one of New Zealand's largest public buildings. It was designed by [[Jasmax]] in conjunction with McConnel Smith and Johnson Architects Sydney, and built by [[Fletcher Construction]].<ref>[http://www.adhb.govt.nz/ach/ach.htm Auckland City Hospital] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109170333/http://www.adhb.govt.nz/ach/ach.htm |date=January 9, 2007 }} (from the Auckland City Hospital Website)</ref>
