'''The Westminster Schools''' is a Kindergarten –12 [[private school]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], United States, founded in 1951.

==History==
Westminster originated in 1951 as a reorganization of Atlanta's North Avenue [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] School (NAPS), a girls' school and an affiliate of the [[North Avenue Presbyterian Church]]. Dr. William L. Pressly of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]]'s [[McCallie School]] served as Westminster's first president. The school moved to its current campus in 1953 as the result of a land grant by trustee Fritz Orr.

Also in 1953, Washington Seminary, another private school for girls, founded by two of [[George Washington]]'s great-nieces in 1878,<ref>[http://www.westminster.net/academics/archives_collections_ws.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309041342/http://www.westminster.net/academics/archives_collections_ws.asp |date=March 9, 2009 }}</ref>{{third party inline|date=January 2018}} merged with Westminster. The resulting school was [[Mixed-sex education|co-educational]] until the sixth grade, with separate schools for boys and girls continuing through the twelfth grade, a practice that continued until 1986 and provided the basis of Westminster's plural name.

In the mid-1950s, Westminster became a test site for a new advanced studies program that would later become the [[College Board]]'s [[Advanced Placement]] program.  In 1962, the administration building, later named Pressly Hall, was constructed, bringing the number of permanent buildings on campus to four.

In the early 1960s, the school barred black students and only rarely allowed African-Americans on campus.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1aQoXxnENigC|title=White Flight: Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism|last=Kruse|first=Kevin M.|date=2013-07-11|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1400848973|language=en|page=143}}</ref>

In 1965, the school's trustees voted to adopt a non-discriminatory admissions policy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Purdy|first=Michelle A.|date=February 2016|title=Blurring Public and Private: The Pragmatic Desegregation Politics of an Elite Private School in Atlanta|journal=History of Education Quarterly|volume=56|issue=1|pages=61–89|doi=10.1111/hoeq.12149|issn=0018-2680}}</ref>

Until 1978, the school also operated as a [[boarding school]] Using Tull hall as a Dormitory.

In 2006 the school ran a campaign attempting to raise $100 million to further increase its endowment size. The campaign was at the time the third-largest ever for an independent school in the United States.<ref>"Teaching For Tomorrow Assures Excellence for Today." Adams, Abby. ''The Westminster Bi-Line'', December 8, 2006. pg. 3.</ref>{{third party inline|date=January 2018}}

==Campus==
[[File:The Westminster Schools campus.jpg|thumb|The quadrangle located on Westminster's campus.]]
Westminster is situated on a wooded campus of {{convert|180|acre|km2}} in the [[Buckhead (Atlanta)|Buckhead]] community of Atlanta. A new campus road, completed in June 2004, rerouted traffic away from central campus.  In addition to a new junior high facility, completed in August 2005, Westminster has five main high school academic buildings – Campbell Hall (1952), Askew Hall (1951), and [[J. Mack Robinson|Robinson]] Hall (1992), Broyles Hall (1987), and Pressly Hall (1962). Pressly Hall houses administrative offices, the Malone Dining Hall, and McCain Chapel. Turner Gymnasium underwent major construction and expansion completed in 2000. Broyles Arts Center houses the orchestra, band, theater, and art programs, and also the Campus Center, an area for students to socialize during free time that includes a concession stand. The recently renovated Scott Hall (2013), once nearly obsolete after the construction of the Junior High School building, now houses the campus bookstore and technology department. Love Hall (1995) serves as the elementary school. Tull Hall, which was once the dorm rooms for boarding students now serves as a preschool.

The campus hosted the [[Atlanta Marathon]] from 1964 until 1980.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsUUXBoXWUAC&q=atlanta+marathon+westminster&pg=PA7|title=Distance Memories: Reflections of a Life on the Run|last=Ludwig|first=Scott|date=2013-04-30|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781475985771|language=en}}</ref> During the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta Olympics]], the Torch was run through campus. The floor used for the basketball games during the Olympics is now in the school's Lower School gymnasium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.westminster.net/about-us/campus-maps|title=Our Campus – The Westminster Schools|website=www.westminster.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-12}}</ref>

Westminster is currently implementing an extensive campus renovation to enhance teacher-student connection. Campbell Hall is under renovation and a new 28,000-square-foot upper school academic building (Hawkins Hall) is under construction. The football stadium is also being enhanced. A parking garage and a new Wildcat center is also under construction

==Athletics==
Westminster fields 84 [[team sport|athletic teams]], including [[baseball]], [[basketball]] (boys' and girls'), [[cheerleading]] (football and basketball), [[Rowing (sport)|crew]], [[Cross country running|cross country]] (boys' and girls'), [[American football|football]], [[golf]] (boys' and girls'), [[gymnastics]], [[lacrosse]] (boys' and girls'), [[Association football|soccer]] (boys' and girls'), [[softball]], [[Human swimming|swimming]] and [[Diving (sport)|diving]] (boys' and girls'), [[tennis]] (boys' and girls'), [[track and field]] (boys' and girls'), [[volleyball]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], and [[wrestling]].

For the 2012–13 school year, Westminster was named the nation's best overall sports program for its eleven state championships and four second-place finishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maxpreps.com/m/article.aspx?articleid=3ed091d3-ab25-403e-8462-38568c655f20 |title=High School Sports News Articles – MaxPreps – Westminster wins 12–13 MaxPreps Cup |publisher=MaxPreps |date=2013-08-05 |accessdate=2014-03-20}}</ref>

These teams have won 286 state championships since 1951, including seven in the 2016–17 school year. Westminster has received the Georgia Athletic Directors' Association Director's Cup in its respective classification in 17 of the 18 years it has been awarded, 2000–2008 and 2010–2017.<ref>[https://gadaonline.net/Past_Cup_Winners.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126215016/https://gadaonline.net/Past_Cup_Winners.html |date=November 26, 2010 }}</ref> The varsity boys' tennis team won the Georgia State High School AAA State Championship in ten seasons in a row, 1999–2009. The boys' team has yielded many Division 1 [[NCAA]] scholarship tennis players over the years, and it has won several regional tournaments as well. The men's and women's swimming & diving teams have won 34 state championships under former coach Pete Higgins, whose accolades through 51 years of coaching include membership in the Georgia Aquatics Hall of Fame, recognition of January 5, 1990 as Pete Higgins Day by the City of Atlanta, among others. Westminster fields the sole varsity squash team south of [[Woodberry Forest School]] in [[Virginia]] featuring full interscholastic competition; the team placed 16th in the 2004 U.S. National High School Team Championships, held at [[Yale University]], and the Squash Cats also won the title in 2012, 2016, and 2018.

In 2014, Westminster moved up a class from AA to AAA. In 2015, Westminster's football team won the AAA state championship for the first time in 37 years against rival [[Blessed Trinity Catholic High School]] in overtime, with a final score of 38–31. In 2016, Westminster's baseball team won the AAA state championship for the first time in 41 years, also against [[Blessed Trinity Catholic High School]], sweeping the championship series in a pair of one-run victories.
Westminster's boys soccer team has won the most state championships (14) in Georgia High School history. The 2019 Boys team also finished the season ranked #1 in the nation by MaxPreps.

==Extracurricular activities==
Westminster places a great deal of focus on extracurricular clubs and activities, with students and faculty devoting time before, during, and after school to these activities. Among the academic extracurricular pursuits are an academic quiz team, debate team, math team, and math honors society.

Only one year of an art is required, but many extracurricular opportunities in that field are available to students, including a vocal ensemble and men's and women's a cappella groups, as well as a symphonic band, chorus, orchestra, and theater program.

Student publications include ''Lynx'', the annual yearbook, ''The Westminster Bi-Line'', a monthly newspaper publication, ''Crossroads'', a literary magazine in languages other than English, ''Embryo'', an arts, music, and literature magazine, and ''Evolutions,'' a poetry and creative writing periodical.

Religious and cultural groups on campus showcase the diverse heritage of the student body. A student-run Christian Life Committee oversees that aspect of student life, including many Bible studies and a branch of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Other groups of this type include [[Tikkun Olam]], a Jewish fellowship club for junior high students; Nosh, an all-encompassing religious discussion group; and Far Out Far East, a cultural club that explores Eastern cultures and traditions.

Freshman go through a two-week Discovery program, and seniors can be members of Peer Leadership, a guidance and counseling program for freshmen.

WCAT, the school's Internet television station, broadcasts athletic events and school activities. In the 2016–17 school year, more than 45 students from all three divisions helped stream more than 220 events.
