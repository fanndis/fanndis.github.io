In July 2012, Barry was mocked on social media for suggesting during a debate on paid parental leave that [[Jacinda Ardern]] could not speak with authority on the subject because of her (then) childless status.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Trevett |first1=Claire |title=Barry mocked for childless snipe |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10822482 |accessdate=5 July 2020 |work=New Zealand Herald |date=27 July 2012}}</ref>

=== Second term, and promotion to Cabinet ===
On 6 October 2014, Prime Minister [[John Key]] appointed Barry to the portfolios of [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage|Minister for Arts, Culture & Heritage]], [[Minister of Conservation (New Zealand)|Minister of Conservation]], and [[Minister for Seniors|Minister for Senior Citizens]]. She was ranked 20th in [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] under the [[John Key|Key]] Ministry.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ministerial List {{!}} DPMC|url = http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/cabinet/ministers/ministerial-list|website = www.dpmc.govt.nz|accessdate = 6 January 2016}}</ref> After Prime Minister Key's resignation, Prime Minister [[Bill English]] reshuffled the Cabinet.

==== Minister of Arts, Culture, and Heritage ====
World War I 100th anniversary celebrations have been taking place since Barry took office. As Minister she has been in charge of the World War 100 celebrations, which include commemorations within New Zealand and overseas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ww100.govt.nz/activities-and-projects|title=Activities and Projects {{!}} WW100 New Zealand|website=ww100.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=3 March 2017}}</ref> While World War 100 is based within the Arts, Culture, and Heritage Ministry, it relied on support from [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (New Zealand)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]], the [[New Zealand Defence Force]] and the [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of Internal Affairs]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ww100.govt.nz/contact-us|title=Contact Us {{!}} WW100 New Zealand|website=ww100.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=3 March 2017}}</ref>

When Bill English became Leader of the National Party, and subsequently Prime Minister, he disestablished the post of Minister of Broadcasting, absorbing it into Barry's Arts, Culture, and Heritage Portfolio.

==== Minister of Conservation ====
As Minister of Conservation, Barry launched [[Predator Free 2050]], a programme to ensure that New Zealand's native animals were free from being attacked by predators. It looks at controlling predators using community volunteers, private residents, philanthropists and government investment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/predator-free-2050|title=Predator Free 2050: Our work|last=(DOC)|first=corporatename = New Zealand Department of Conservation|website=www.doc.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=3 March 2017}}</ref> With over 80% of New Zealand's birds and reptiles endangered, Predator Free 2050 focuses on protecting these species from rats, stoats, possums, weasels and ferrets.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://predatorfreenz.org/about-us/what-we-do/|title=Predator Free New Zealand – Predator Free NZ|work=Predator Free NZ|access-date=3 March 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2015, Barry urged the SPCA to put down stray cats instead of just neutering and releasing them.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/science/69090791/maggie-barry-urges-spca-to-kill-stray-cats |title=Maggie Barry urges SPCA to kill stray cats |first=Olivia |last=Wannan |work=stuff.co.nz |date=4 June 2015 |accessdate=5 March 2017}}</ref>

==== Minister for Senior Citizens ====
Under Prime Minister [[Bill English]], [[New Zealand National Party|National]] launched a policy to increase the superannuation age from 65 to 67.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/90087663/a-guide-to-nz-superannuation--what-you-need-to-know-and-why|title=A guide to NZ Superannuation – what you need to know, and why|website=Stuff|access-date=6 March 2017}}</ref> As Minister for Seniors much of the groundwork for implementing this policy falls under Barry's portfolio.

During the difficulties with the switch over from senior citizens being able to use their gold card on buses, to having to use an [[AT HOP card]], Barry announced that the [[Ministry of Social Development (New Zealand)|Ministry of Social Development]], in which the Office of Seniors sits, would be assisting with the changeover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/msd-assist-auckland-transport-switch|title=MSD to assist Auckland Transport switch|website=The Beehive|language=en-nz|access-date=6 March 2017}}</ref>

=== Third term ===
After the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], Barry retained her cabinet portfolios as Caretaker Minister. However once [[Winston Peters]] announced that he was to form a coalition with the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], National returned to opposition and Barry lost her government roles. She retained her position in the Party's ranks and her role within the Party as Spokesperson for Conservation.

Barry did retain her electorate seat with a majority of 12,716, down on 16,503 the previous election, despite her personal vote only falling by a few hundred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/electorate-details-33.html|title=E9 Statistics – Electorate Status|last=Commission|first=New Zealand Electoral|website=www.electionresults.govt.nz|access-date=22 October 2017}}</ref> She was elected Deputy Chair of the Environment Select Committee.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/members-of-parliament/barry-maggie/|title=Barry, Maggie|access-date=26 November 2017|language=en}}</ref>

While on the Justice Select Committee Barry voiced her opposition to the End of Life Choice Bill, proposed by ACT's David Seymour, which would allow assisted suicide, a concept Barry had always been opposed to.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.familyfirst.org.nz/2018/05/maggie-barry-dignified-death-yes-but-check-the-detail/|title=Maggie Barry: Dignified death, yes, but check the detail {{!}} Family First NZ|language=en-US|access-date=18 December 2018}}</ref> During the hearings, Barry was accused of bias and being disparaging to submitters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/north-shore-times/106955565/national-mp-maggie-barry-accused-of-bias-during-euthanasia-hearings|title=National MP Maggie Barry accused of bias during euthanasia hearings|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=18 December 2018}}</ref>

The ex staffer who went to the media gave an exclusive interview to Radio New Zealand in which he spoke, under voice disguise, about how Barry treated him and other staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/377515/maggie-barry-bullying-claims-ex-staffer-speaks-out|title=Maggie Barry bullying claims: 'It was Jekyll and Hyde stuff'|date=5 December 2018|website=Radio New Zealand|language=en-nz|access-date=18 December 2018}}</ref> He spoke of how 'It was Jekyll and Hyde stuff', and that another staff member left and took a personal grievance, which he did not know the outcome of.

A complaint was laid to the Auditor-General on 5 December 2018, that Barry had effectively misappropriated public funds for the use of party work by requiring Parliamentary Services staff to do Party work during Parliamentary hours, she was later cleared of any wrongdoing in a report released by Parliamentary Services in July 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12171791|title=Complaint laid with Auditor General over Maggie Barry allegations|last=kirsty.johnston@nzherald.co.nz @kirsty_johnston|first=Kirsty Johnston Kirsty Johnston is an investigative reporter at the New Zealand Herald|date=5 December 2018|work=NZ Herald|access-date=18 December 2018|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/media/5903/report-into-the-use-of-vote-parliamentary-service-funding-within-the-office-of-maggie-barry.pdf|title=USE OF VOTE PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE FUNDING WITHIN THE OFFICE OF THE MEMBER FOR NORTH SHORE, HON MAGGIE BARRY|website=Parliament New Zealand|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12254919|title=Maggie Barry cleared of accusations she made support staff do National Party work|date=1 August 2019|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref>
