'''Diosdado Pangan Macapagal Sr.''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Gawad Mabini|GCrM]]}} ({{IPA-tl|makapaˈɡal}},<ref>{{cite book |title=Grolier Encyclopedia of Knowledge (Vol. 12) |publisher=Grolier Incorporated |isbn=0-7172-5372-4|page=4}}</ref> September 28, 1910 – April 21, 1997) was the ninth [[President of the Philippines]], serving from 1961 to 1965, and the sixth [[Vice-President of the Philippines|Vice-President]], serving from 1957 to 1961. He also served as a member of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], and headed the [[1970 Philippine Constitutional Convention election|Constitutional Convention of 1970]]. He was the father of [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], who followed his path as President of the Philippines from 2001 to 2010.

A native of [[Lubao, Pampanga]], Macapagal graduated from the [[University of the Philippines Manila|University of the Philippines]] and [[University of Santo Tomas]], both in [[Manila]], after which he worked as a lawyer for the government. He first won election in 1949 to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], representing a district in his home province of [[Pampanga]]. In 1957, he became [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]] under the rule of President [[Carlos P. Garcia]], whom he later defeated in the [[1961 Philippine presidential election|1961 election]].

As President, Macapagal worked to suppress graft and corruption and to stimulate the Philippine economy. He introduced the country's first land reform law, placed the peso on the free currency exchange market, and liberalized foreign exchange and import controls. Many of his reforms, however, were crippled by a Congress dominated by the rival [[Nacionalista Party]]. He is also known for shifting the country's observance of [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Independence Day]] from July 4 to June 12, commemorating the day President [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] unilaterally declared the independence of the [[First Philippine Republic]] from the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1898. He stood for re-election in [[1965 Philippine presidential election|1965]], and was defeated by [[Ferdinand Marcos]], who subsequently ruled for 21 years.

Under Marcos, Macapagal was elected president of the [[1970 Philippine Constitutional Convention election|Constitutional Convention]] which would later draft what became the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1973 Constitution]], though the manner in which the charter was ratified and modified led him to later question its legitimacy. He died of heart failure, [[pneumonia]], and [[renal failure|renal]] complications, in 1997, at the age of 86.

Macapagal was also a reputed poet in the Chinese and Spanish language, though his poetic oeuvre was eclipsed by his political biography.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

==House of Representatives==
On the urging of local political leaders of Pampanga province, President Quirino recalled Macapagal from his position in Washington to run for a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Philippines)|House of Representatives]] representing the [[Legislative districts of Pampanga#1st District|1st District of Pampanga]].<ref name=auto>{{cite web|title=Diosdado Macapagal autobiography |url=http://www.macapagal.com/dm/biography/bio2.html |publisher=The Macapagals |access-date=August 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601225254/http://www.macapagal.com/dm/biography/bio2.html |archive-date=June 1, 2009 }}</ref> The district's incumbent, Representative [[Amado Yuzon]], was a friend of Macapagal, but was opposed by the administration due to his support by communist groups.<ref name=auto/> After a campaign that Macapagal described as cordial and free of personal attacks, he won a landslide victory in the [[1949 Philippine general election|1949 election]].<ref name=auto/> He won re-election in the [[1953 Philippine general election|1953 election]], and served as Representative in the [[2nd Congress of the Philippines|2nd]] and [[3rd Congress of the Philippines|3rd Congress]].

At the start of legislative sessions in 1950, the members of the House of Representatives elected Macapagal as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and he was given several important foreign assignments.<ref name=pte/> He was a Philippine delegate to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] multiple times, notably distinguishing himself in debates over Communist aggression with [[Andrei Vishinsky]] and [[Jacob Malik]] of the Soviet Union.<ref name=pte/> He took part in negotiations for the [[Mutual Defense Treaty (US-Philippines)|U.S.-R.P.

Garcia of the [[Nacionalista Party (Philippines)|Nacionalista Party]], Macapagal was elected vice president in an upset victory, defeating the Nacionalista candidate, [[José Laurel, Jr.|José B. Laurel, Jr.]], by over eight percentage points. A month after the election, he was also chosen as the head of the Liberal Party.<ref name=enc/>

As the first ever Philippine vice president to be elected from a rival party of the president, Macapagal served out his four-year vice presidential term as a leader of the [[opposition (government)|opposition]]. The ruling party refused to give him a [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet position]] in the Garcia administration, which was a break from tradition.<ref name=op/> He was offered a position in the Cabinet only on the condition that he switch allegiance to the ruling Nationalista Party, but he declined the offer and instead played the role of critic to the administration's policies and performance.<ref name=Malaya>{{Cite book|title=So Help Us God: The Presidents of the Philippines and Their Inaugural Addresses |last=Malaya |first=J. Eduardo |author2=Jonathan E.

====Economy====
In his inaugural address, Macapagal promised a socio-economic program anchored on "a return to free and private enterprise", placing economic development in the hands of private entrepreneurs with minimal government interference.<ref name=Malaya/>

Twenty days after the inauguration, exchange controls were lifted and the [[Philippine peso]] was allowed to float on the free currency exchange market. The currency controls were initially adopted by the administration of [[Elpidio Quirino]] as a temporary measure, but continued to be adopted by succeeding administrations. The peso devalued from P2.64 to the U.S. dollar, and stabilized at P3.80 to the dollar, supported by a $300&nbsp;million stabilization fund from the [[International Monetary Fund]].<ref name=Malaya/>

To achieve the national goal of [[economic]] and social progress with prosperity reaching down to the masses, there existed a choice of methods. First, there was the choice between the [[democracy|democratic]] and [[dictator]]ial systems, the latter prevailing in [[Communism|Communist]] countries. On this, the choice was easy as Filipinos had long been committed to the democratic method.<ref name="Diosdado Macapagal">{{cite web|url=http://www.macapagal.com/dm2/biography/tributes.html |title=Diosdado Macapagal |publisher=Macapagal.com |access-date=September 23, 2011}}</ref> With the democratic mechanism, however, the next choice was between [[free enterprise]] and the continuing of the controls system. Macapagal stated the essence of free enterprise in layman parlance in declaring before Congress on January 22, 1962 that "the task of economic development belongs principally to private enterprise and not to the government.<ref name="Diosdado Macapagal"/>

[[File:Macapagal inaugurating masalip dam.jpg|thumb|left|Macapagal inaugurating the [[Masalip Dam]] in [[Tubao, La Union]]]]

Before independence there was free enterprise in the Philippines under Presidents [[Manuel Quezon]], [[Sergio Osmeña]] and [[Manuel Roxas]]. In 1950 President [[Elpidio Quirino]] deviated from free enterprise launching as a temporary emergency measure the system of exchange and import controls. The controls system was carried on by President Magsaysay and Garcia.<ref name="Diosdado Macapagal"/>

The first fundamental decision Macapagal had to make was whether to continue the system of exchange controls of Quirino, Magsaysay and Garcia or to return to the free enterprise of Quezon, Osmena and Roxas.<ref name="Diosdado Macapagal"/> It had been his view since he was a Congressman for eight years that the suitable economic system for Filipinos was free enterprise. So on January 21, 1962 after working for 20 straight hours he signed a Central Bank decree abolishing exchange controls and returning the country to free enterprise.<ref name="Diosdado Macapagal"/>

During the 20 days available to make a decision on choice between controls and free enterprise, between his inauguration as president and before the opening of [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]], Macapagal's main adviser was Governor Andres Castillo of the [[Central Bank of the Philippines|Central Bank]].

Further reform efforts by Macapagal were blocked by the Nacionalistas, who dominated the House of Representatives and the Senate at that time. Nonetheless, Macapagal was able to achieve steady economic progress, and annual GDP growth averaged at 5.53% for 1962–65.<ref name=Malaya/>

====Socio-economic program====
The removal of controls and the restoration of free enterprise was intended to provide only the fundamental setting in which Macapagal could work out economic and social progress.<ref name="Diosdado Macapagal"/> A specific and periodic program for the guidance of both the private sector and the government was an essential instrument to attain the economic and social development that constituted the goal of his labors.<ref name="Diosdado Macapagal"/>

Such a program for his administration was formulated under his authority and direction by a group of able and reputable economic and business leaders the most active and effective of which was Sixto Roxas III. From an examination of the planned targets and requirements of the Five-Year program – formally known as the Five-Year Socio-Economic Integrated Development Program – it could be seen that it aimed at the following objectives.<ref name="Diosdado Macapagal"/>

* immediate restoration of [[economic stability]];
* alleviating the plight of the common man; and
* establishing a dynamic basic for future growth.

Free enterprise was restored with decontrol. The Five-Year Economic Program had been prescribed. Land reform abolishing tenancy had been launched. These were essential foundations for economic and social progress for the greatest number.<ref name="Diosdado Macapagal"/>

The essential foundations having been laid, attention must then be turned to the equally difficult task of building the main [[edifice]] by implementing the economic program. Although the success of Macapagal's Socio-Economic Program in free enterprise inherently depended on the private sector, it would be helpful and necessary for the government to render active assistance in its implementation by the citizens.<ref name="Diosdado Macapagal"/>

Such role of the government in [[free enterprise]], in the view of Macapagal, required it (1) to provide the social overhead like roads, airfields and ports that directly or proximately promote economic growth, (2) to adopt fiscal and monetary policies salutary to investments, and most importantly (3) to serve as an entrepreneur or promote of basic and key private industries, particularly those that require capital too large for businessmen to put up by themselves. Among the enterprises he selected for active government promotion were [[steel mill#Integrated mill|integrated steel]], [[fertilizer]], [[pulp (paper)|pulp]], meat [[canning]] and [[tourism]].<ref name="Diosdado Macapagal"/>

====Land reform====
{{See also|Land reform in the Philippines}}
[[File:Macapagal-Aguinaldo-House.jpg|thumb|Macapagal (left) in front of the Aguinaldo house replica at the [[Quirino Grandstand]], June 12, 1962]]

Like [[Ramon Magsaysay]], President Diosdado Macapagal came from the masses. He savored calling himself the "Poor boy from Lubao".<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010">Manapat, Carlos, et al.'' Economics, Taxation, and Agrarian Reform''. Quezon City: C&E Pub., 2010. Print.</ref> Ironically, he had little popularity among the masses.<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/> This could be attributed to an absence any charismatic appeal owing to his stiff personality.<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/> But despite this, Macapagal had certain achievements.<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/> Foremost of these was the Agricultural Land Reform Code of 1963 (Republic Act No. 3844) which provided for the purchase of private farmlands with the intention of distributing them in small lots to the landless tenants on easy term of payment.<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/> It is a major development in history of [[land reform in the Philippines]],

In comparison with the previous agrarian legislation, the law lowered the retention limit to 75 hectares, whether owned by individuals or corporations. It removed the term "contiguous" and established the [[leasehold]] system.<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/> The share-[[tenancy]] or the ''kasama'' system was prohibited.<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/> It formulated a [[bill of rights]] that assured agricultural workers the right to self-organization and to a [[minimum wage]]. It also created an office that acquired and distributed farmlands and a financing institution for this purpose.<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/> The major flaw of this law was, however, that it had several exemptions, such as ort (big capital [[plantations]] established during the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish]] and [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American]] periods); fishponds, saltbeds, and lands primarily planted to [[citrus]], [[coconuts]], [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]], [[Coffee bean|coffee]], [[durian]], and other similar permanent trees; landholdings converted to [[Residential property|residential]], [[Commercial property|commercial]], [[industrial property|industrial]], or other similar non-agricultural purposes.<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/>

It was viewed that the 75-hectare retention limit was just too high for the growing population density. Moreover, this law merely allowed the transfer of the [[landlord]]ism from one area to another.<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/> This was because landlords were paid in bonds, which he could use to purchase agricultural lands.<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/> Likewise, the farmer was free to choose to be excluded from the [[leasehold]] arrangements if he volunteered to give up the landholdings to the landlord.<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/>

Within two years after the law was implemented, no<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/> land was being purchased under its term and conditions caused by the [[peasant]]s' inability to purchase the land.<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/> Besides, the [[Philippine Government|government]] seemed lacking of strong political will, as shown by the [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]]' allotment of only one million [[Philippine peso]]s for the implementation of this code. At least Php200&nbsp;million was needed within a year from the enactment and implementation of the code, and Php300&nbsp;million in the next three years for the program to be successful. However, by 1972, the code had benefited only 4,500 peasants covering 68 estates, at the cost of Php57&nbsp;million to the government. Consequently, by the 1970s, the farmers ended up tilling less land, with their share in the farm also being less.<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/> They incurred more debts, depending on the [[landlord]], [[creditor]]s, and [[rice|palay]] buyers. Indeed, during the administration of Macapagal, the productivity of the [[farmers]] further declined.<ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/>

====Anti-corruption drive====
One of Macapagal's major campaign pledges had been to clean out the government corruption that had proliferated under former President Garcia.<ref name=stone>{{cite news|title=The Philippines: Smoke in Manila |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873686,00.html |date=August 10, 1962 |work=Time |access-date=August 11, 2009}}</ref> The administration also openly feuded with Filipino businessmen [[Fernando Lopez]] and [[Eugenio Lopez, Sr.|Eugenio Lopez]], brothers who had controlling interests in several large businesses.<ref name=Malaya/> The administration alluded to the brothers as "Filipino Stonehills who build and maintain business empires through political power, including the corruption of politicians and other officials".<ref name=strong>{{cite web|title=Building a Strong Republic |url=http://www.pia.gov.ph/pubs/republic.pdf |year=2003 |publisher=Philippine Information Agency |access-date=August 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027101957/http://pia.gov.ph/pubs/republic.pdf |archive-date=October 27, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> In the [[1965 Philippine general election|1965 election]], the Lopezes threw their support behind Macapagal's rival, [[Ferdinand Marcos]], with Fernando Lopez serving Marcos' running mate.<ref name=strong/>

=====Stonehill controversy=====
{{main|Stonehill scandal}}
The Administration's campaign against corruption was tested by [[Harry Stonehill]], an American expatriate with a $50-million business empire in the Philippines.<ref name=stone/> Macapagal's Secretary of Justice, [[Jose W. Diokno]] investigated Stonehill on charges of tax evasion, smuggling, misdeclaration of imports, and corruption of public officials.<ref name=stone/> Diokno's investigation revealed Stonehill's ties to corruption within the government. Macapagal, however, prevented Diokno from prosecuting Stonehill by deporting the American instead, then dismissing Diokno from the cabinet. Diokno questioned Macapagal's actions, saying, "How can the government now prosecute the corrupted when it has allowed the corrupter to go?"<ref name=stone/> Diokno later served as a [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator of the Republic]].

====Independence Day====
Macapagal appealed to nationalist sentiments by shifting the commemoration of Philippine independence day. On May 12, 1962, he signed a proclamation which declared Tuesday, June 12, 1962, as a special public holiday in commemoration of the declaration of independence from Spain on that date in 1898.<ref name=bibingka-jun12>{{Citation

{{wikisource|Manila Declaration (3 August 1963)|Manila Declaration}}
{{wikisource|Joint Statement by the Philippines, the Federation of Malaya and Indonesia (5 August 1963)|Joint Statement by the governments of Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia}}
In July 1963, President Diosdado Macapagal convened a summit meeting in Manila in which a nonpolitical confederation for Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia, [[Maphilindo]], was proposed as a realization of [[José Rizal]]'s dream of bringing together the Malay peoples, seen as artificially divided by colonial frontiers.<ref name="macapagal.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.macapagal.com/dm2/ |title=Diosdado Macapagal |publisher=Macapagal.com |access-date=September 23, 2011}}</ref>

Maphilindo was described as a regional association that would approach issues of common concern in the spirit of consensus. However, it was also perceived as a tactic on the parts of [[Jakarta]] and [[Manila]] to delay, or even prevent, the formation of the Federation of [[Malaysia]]. Manila had its own claim to [[Sabah]] (formerly [[British North Borneo]]),<ref name="macapagal.com"/> and Jakarta protested the formation of Malaysia as a [[British Empire|British imperialist]] plot. The plan failed when [[Sukarno]] adopted his plan of "[[konfrontasi]]" with Malaysia. The Konfrontasi, or Confrontation basically aimed at preventing Malaysia from attaining independence. The idea was inspired onto President Sukarno by the Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI), or literally the [[Indonesian Communist Party]]. The party convinced President Sukarno that the formation of Malaysia is a form of [[neocolonialism|neo-colonization]] and would affect tranquility in Indonesia. The subsequent development of [[ASEAN]] almost certainly excludes any possibility of the project ever being revived.<ref name="macapagal.com"/>

====Vietnam War====
[[File:LBJ with Diosdado Macapagal.jpg|thumb|left|US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (right) with Macapagal (left) in 1963]]

Before the end of his term in 1965, President Diosdado Macapagal persuaded [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] to send troops to [[South Vietnam]]. However this proposal was blocked by the opposition led by [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] who deserted Macapagal's [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] and defected to the [[Nacionalista Party]].<ref name="historynet.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/the-philippines-allies-during-the-vietnam-war.htm |title=The Philippines: Allies During the Vietnam War |publisher=HistoryNet |access-date=September 23, 2011}}</ref>

The [[United States Government|U.S. government]]'s active interest in bringing other nations into the war had been part of U.S. policy discussions as early as 1961. President [[Lyndon Johnson]] first publicly appealed for other countries to come to the aid of South Vietnam on April 23, 1964–in what was called the "More Flags" program.<ref name="historynet.com"/> Chester Cooper, former director of Asian affairs for the White House, explained why the impetus came from the United States instead of from the Republic of South Vietnam: "The 'More Flags' campaign&nbsp;... required the application of considerable pressure for Washington to elicit any meaningful commitments. One of the more exasperating aspects of the search…was the lassitude&nbsp;…... of the Saigon government. In part&nbsp;... the South Vietnam leaders were preoccupied with political jockeying.&nbsp;... In addition, Saigon appeared to believe that the program was a public relations campaign directed at the American people."<ref name="historynet.com"/>

===1963 midterm election===
{{main|1963 Philippine Senate election}}
The senatorial election was held on November 12, 1963. Macapagal's [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] (LP) won four out of the eight seats up for grabs during the election – thereby increasing the LP's senate seats from eight to ten.

===1965 presidential campaign===
{{main|1965 Philippine presidential election}}

[[File:Ferdinand E. Marcos and Diosdado Macapagal at the Malacañan Palace Music Room.jpg|thumb|President-elect [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] is received by incumbent President Diosdado Macapagal at the Malacañan Palace Music Room, before both proceeded to the inaugural venue, December 30, 1965.]]

Towards the end of his term, Macapagal decided to seek re-election to continue seeking reforms which he claimed were stifled by a "dominant and uncooperative opposition" in Congress.<ref name=Malaya/> With Senate President Ferdinand Marcos, a fellow member of the Liberal Party, unable to win his party's nomination due to Macapagal's re-election bid, Marcos switched allegiance to the rival Nacionalista Party to oppose Macapagal.<ref name=Malaya/>

Among the issues raised against the incumbent administration were graft and corruption, rise in consumer goods, and persisting peace and order issues.<ref name=Malaya/> Macapagal was defeated by Marcos in the [[1965 Philippine general election|November 1965 polls]].

==Post-presidency and death==
[[File:Diosdado macapagal grave.jpg|thumb|Grave of Diosdado Macapagal at the ''Libingan ng mga Bayani''.]]
Macapagal announced his retirement from politics following his 1965 loss to Marcos. In 1971, he was elected president of the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] that drafted what became the 1973 constitution. The manner in which the charter was ratified and later modified led him to later question its legitimacy. In 1979, he formed the National Union for Liberation as a political party to oppose the Marcos regime.

Following the restoration of democracy in 1986, Macapagal took on the role of elder [[Politician|statesman]], and was a member of the [[Philippine Council of State]].<ref name=op/> He also served as honorary chairman of the National Centennial Commission, and chairman of the board of CAP Life, among others.

In his retirement, Macapagal devoted much of his time to reading and writing.<ref name=op/> He published his presidential memoir, authored several books about government and economics, and wrote a weekly column for the ''[[Manila Bulletin]]'' newspaper.

Diosdado Macapagal died of heart failure, [[pneumonia]] and [[renal failure|renal]] complications at the [[Makati Medical Center]] on April 21, 1997. He is buried at the [[Libingan ng mga Bayani]].
